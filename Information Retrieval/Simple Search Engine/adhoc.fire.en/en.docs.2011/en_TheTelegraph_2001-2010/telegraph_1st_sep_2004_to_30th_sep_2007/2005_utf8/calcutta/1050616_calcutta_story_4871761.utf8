 A splash in the clear blue waters could be all you crave right now, but if that isnt feasible, console yourself with some lobster and scampi fare, on offer at Baan Thai, the Thai speciality restaurant at Oberoi Grand. 

 Lobster and scampi belong to the same specie. The main difference is that while lobster is saltwater catch, scampi is a freshwater delicacy.

 Various cooking styles like steaming, grilling, curries and stir-fries have come together to create some new seafood items that will be part of the a la carte menu at the eatery till June 26. 

 Dishes like Kaeng Kari Koong (scampi in yellow curry with coconut milk and red chilli), Koong Phad Nam Prik Phao (stir-fried scampi with chilli paste, spring onion and Thai basil), Choo Chee Koong Mangkorn (stir-fried lobster in red curry paste with tamarind and kaffir lime) and Koong Mangkorn Takrai (grilled lobster marinated with lemon grass, kaffir lime, galangal, onions and garlic) bear a strong resemblance to South Indian cuisine.

 Both Thai and South Indian food are influenced by coastal habits and culture, explained chef George.

 Authenticity is maintained by importing most of the herbs and spices directly from Thailand even as two Thai chefs supervise the cooking at the restaurant. 

 The dishes are priced between Rs 675 and Rs 800.

 Crab crawl

 The cumbersome and often embarrassing exercise of eating crab in public is passe. Enter soft-shell crab that can be savoured with ease ? shell and all.

 Mainland China, the speciality Chinese restaurant on Gurusaday Road, has introduced these crabs that are a rage in Southeast Asia. 

 Six times a year, the crabs shed their hard shells to become soft-shell crabs, which is the only window of opportunity for lovers of this seafood delicacy. 

 These are the usual crabs that are sold during winter. When they shed their shell, they are fished out of the sea and kept in sweet water to lower their salt content before selling them across the globe, explained chef Rajesh Dubey. 

 Easy to cook and easier to eat, the crabs are either saut?ed or steamed and served with minimal spices to help retain the original flavour. In places like Japan, female crabs carrying eggs are a delicacy and are eaten with nothing more than a slight dash of soya, added the chef. 

 Back in Calcutta, the crabs are cooked more to suit the Indian palate. The chef, however, recommends seasoning the light saut?ed crabs with pepper and salt only. One can also choose Chinese sauces to go with the meat.

 One can opt for Hunan, Garlic Butter and Sichuan Chilli sauces that go well with the crabs, advised the chef, who hopes Calcutta will take a step beyond Chilli Chicken and Chowmien when it comes to Chinese fare.

 The crabs, priced at Rs 200 a piece, are small enough to be had by one person. The restaurant has a bank of live crabs for guests to inspect and choose from. 

 While the original menu offers crab claws seasoned with spices, this is a special effort to popularise the soft-shelled variety in the city. We are expecting adventurous foodies of the city to appreciate the endeavour, smiled Dubey.

 Fizz fun

 Sprite is exploding. Not on the shelves, but on the sales charts. Fired by the tremendous growth over the past two to three seasons for the clear lime beverage, Coca-Cola has launched Sprite Ice, a lemon-and-lime variation of it.

 The drink, launched in Europe in 2003, has tasted success there, and the company hopes to capitalise on growth figures that have outstripped even its flagship cola.

 No wonder the company is bullish on extensions in brands as well as on pack variants. 

 We want to give the consumer more choices, says Srinivas G. Krishna, general manager, marketing, eastern region.

 Coca-Cola will soon follow the new brand up with activities aimed at the calorie-conscious crowd. 

 The zero-category was launched three years ago with Diet Coke. Though it is hardly as big in India as in the West where health-consciousness makes it a favoured drink, Diet Coke is picking up steadily here.

 The company has reason to be doubly happy. This brand costs us the least in promotions. We do not use celebrities for Sprite. The message is that it is an unpretentious drink. Most brands promise lifestyle or emotional benefits or try to sell the moon. But this drink has a no-nonsense simple positioning ? bujhaye pyas, baki sab bakwas, adds Krishna.

 Though the national figures are in healthy double digits, the east is particularly rocking on Sprite, having equalled the full year sales volume of 2003 in the first six months of 2005.

 The company is not complaining. Business in Calcutta grew around 10 to 15 per cent in 2004 over 2003. Though the latest figures have not come in, the citys thirst is unlikely to have slaked this summer.

 A nice blend of creativity and charity marks a new line of T-shirts launched at Landmark earlier this week.

 Conceptualised by musician Tanmoy Bose and designed by Net Trek, the T-shirts draw inspiration from the nine emotions of the performing arts as showcased in the 2,000-year-old Natyashastra of Bharat Muni.

 Proceeds from the sale of my CD Navras and the T-shirts will go to the Institute of Child Health. The idea is to cater to as many as possible, as T-shirts are worn by people of all ages, said Tanmoy.

 Adding to the star appeal of the launch were actress Roopa Ganguly and singer Indranil Sen.

 The T-shirts bear inscriptions in Devnagari script and portray roudra, sringar, advootam, bhayanak, bibhatsa, beer, karun and shantam. 

 The motifs have been taken from the illustrations of Nandalal Basu, explained Tanmoy. 

 The tees come in black, red and yellow. Priced at Rs 280 each, they are available at Landmark and Crossword. 

 The launch was marked by Roopa and Indranil singing a verse from Shudhu tomar bani noy go he bondhu and a percussion performance by Tanmoy, Ratul Shankar and others, including a dhaki.

 Feet fashion

 Winters the time to put your best foot forward, what with those lovely leather boots flooding the racks.

 In sync with the shoe style of the season, Khadims on Wednesday unveiled its winter collection at the Lindsay Street showroom.

 The new range is characterised by bright colours and stylish cuts.

 The pick of the collection is Easy-Walk, a range of canvas shoes.

 The demand for covered shoes during the winter months soars considerably. Hence, we have introduced a large number of covered shoes in our latest range, said Siddhartha Roy Burman, director, Khadims.

 The prices start at Rs 110 and go up to Rs 945.

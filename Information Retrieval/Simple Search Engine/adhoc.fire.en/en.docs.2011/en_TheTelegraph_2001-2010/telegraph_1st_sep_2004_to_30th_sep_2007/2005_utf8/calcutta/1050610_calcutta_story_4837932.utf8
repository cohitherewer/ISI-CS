The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hand in hand as Cinderella blossoms 

Win-win for Calcutta

 - CM?s pro-reforms pitch matched mayor?s makeover mission and Calcutta stood to gain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 For long, Calcutta was India?s Cinderella city ? dirty, dusty and downmarket compared to well-heeled Delhi, Mumbai and newfangled Bangalore. Those who wanted to move on in life left it behind. Those who stayed back suffered from a sense of failure. 

 Things started changing over the past five years or so. Almost everyone who visited the city after some time ? foreigners as well as people from elsewhere in India ? noticed the changes. It obviously was the result of the drastic pro-reforms policy changes of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government.

 A makeover of Calcutta was crucial to the change of Bengal?s image. Ironically, although they were political opponents, Bhattacharjee?s vision went hand-in-hand with mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s mission to change the city?s face. 

 True, many of the new things in Calcutta were not the mayor?s ? or the city corporation?s ? work. The flyovers, for example ? these were state projects, funded by Japanese loans and executed by other agencies. Even some of the corporation?s projects ? such as the underground sewerage or drainage overhauls in collaboration with one French and another German firm ? were started by the previous civic board in the late 1990s. But most projects, old and new, picked up pace during the past few years. Most important, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, whose image as a non-performing body was matched only by that of Writers? Buildings, reinvented itself as a proactive, development-driven agency. 

 Mukherjee was the public face of this dramatic change. Even political adversaries, including the chief minister, grudgingly admitted it. All this makes this month?s elections so very important. The city?s renewal is just gaining momentum. The investors? new faith is evident in the unprecedented real estate, shopping, entertainment and other booms. A political threat to this new initiative could be disastrous for the city?s development agenda. 

 So, Bhattacharjee for Bengal and Mukherjee for Calcutta, many people argue, could be the right choices. But politics ensures that this strange-bedfellows-scenario is a difficult proposition. 

 And, ironically, it is Mukherjee who has queered his own pitch. Until February, he had things going his way. At least, he had as good a chance of returning as mayor after the polls as his Left Front contender. Then he broke away from the Trinamul Congress, floated his Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha and allied the new outfit with the Congress. By now, it is no secret why he had to do so. His relations with Mamata Banerjee soured so much that she decided not to make him the mayor again if the Trinamul-BJP combine won the elections. Mukherjee?s call for a Congress-Trinamul alliance was seen by her as a conspiracy scripted by Pranab Mukherjee and his team. 

 So, what does this hold for the polls? The simple answer, of course, is advantage Left. 

 It is not just that the non-Left camp is so divided. There is a geographical division in that camp, so far as Calcutta?s politics goes. After the beating it got in the recent civic polls in the districts, Trinamul may well be reduced to a party of South Calcutta. Its reach in the central and northern parts, always rather insignificant, may get even smaller, as Congress leaders like Somen Mitra will try and do everything to retain their little fiefs. 

 To the east, the traditional CPM vote bank may help the party even more this time because of the disunited Opposition. And, its campaign strategies suggest that the CPM is keen to win over the upper-class people, too, with Bhattacharjee?s pro-reform agenda. The party?s traditional support base among the Muslims (who hold a numerical advantage in 40 of the 141 wards), slum-dwellers and lower middle-class people is thus being sought to be widened. If the party loses some of the traditional support to Trinamul, it can make amends by making new gains with upper-class votes. 

 But, suppose the Congress-Mancha alliance and Trinamul together get more seats than the Left. Mukherjee will then re-emerge the strongest mayoral contender. 

 And, can Mamata still resist him and smoothen the passage for the Left? Even making allowances for the unpredictability that she has come to represent, it is a safe bet that she can?t do anything that will help the Left. For this to happen, voters have to decide if they will give Mukherjee?s men enough votes, despite the fact that he now is a leader without a party. 

 Elections, in Bengal or elsewhere in India, do not suggest that the people?s voting choices are decided by either the popularity of individuals or their work. In the Calcutta elections, too, the people have little choice but to vote for the parties. Hence, the CPM?s advantage. Mukherjee does not have much of a party, the Congress is still afflicted with years of inertia and infighting and Trinamul is badly bruised by the poll-eve wounds inflicted by its own mayor. Hence, the CPM?s advantage. 

 Remember also that in the 2000 Calcutta elections, the difference in seats between the Left and the Trinamul-BJP combine was small and Mukherjee?s civic boat could sail through only because of the defection of some nine Congress councillors over to his side. 

 In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, too, the difference in the vote shares of the Left and the Trinamul-BJP alliance in the corporation areas was a mere 15,000. One thing, though, is certain: no matter who wins or loses the elections, Calcutta?s win-win situation looks all set to continue.

 (From top) A scene from the dance floor at Shisha; DJ Suketu in the act 

 Aadat, Kajra re, Dus bahane, Woh lamhey? Suddenly, youve had enough of this series, night in and night out. Next step? Well, simple. Considering it isnt all that taxing to take those extra steps to the DJs console. Thereafter? Well, simple again. Just ask him to play Drop the Pressure. And then, step back for the reaction. If you think your jobs done, the DJ might think that his jobs badly done (a shrug) or his jobs better done (smile).

 No rocket science involved here, but requesting the change of track, as we see, isnt really about careful whispers exchanged between the club-goer and the DJ.

 In fact, in some countries, it is considered downright offensive to make this rude move towards the melody man. But we, as a developing clubbing destination still have a long, long way to go. At least when it comes to midnight manners.

 Once youve lobbed your request into the DJs court, to-play-or-not-to-play is completely his console call. Song sequences, mood and feel ? these are just a few of the parameters that dictate his next track.

 DJ Girish of Shisha fame says that he complies with a request only if it fits into his running sequence. Secondly, I figure out whether that particular request will match the vibe of my club. For example, I will never play Ande ka funda or Sarkailo khaitya. But if it does fit my set, then I am more than happy to go ahead and readily play it then and there.

 Otherwise, the guests are refused in the best possible manner, failing which anything from tantrums to tears can flow from the petitioner.

 Heres a quick glance at some dos and donts. Straight from the music makers mouth:

 First and foremost, do a self-check on the mood of the club. Requests such as Chunari chunari wont be met in the middle of a psychedelic pulse. Be clever about your pick and youll surely not be disappointed. I never refuse tracks, but all I say is that the request is yours but the time is mine, smiles DJ Anshul of Underground.

 Ladies beware! Going by popular DJ count, six out of 10 requests come in from the womenfolk. Though DJ Girish says that it is far easier to say no to women as opposed to men, they do need to go slow with their long play lists.

 Learn your line. Folks are so tuned into the chorus that sometimes they dont know what number they mean. A common confusion is asking for Pink Floyds Coming Back to Life but insisting they want Where were you! says DJ Austen at Someplace Else. So, know your need before jumping the console.

 Mind your body language. Dont barge in; ask for a can-I-talk-to-you moment. Man or woman, its best to mind the gap, so tip your head slightly and let the DJ meet you halfway. You surely wouldnt want someone almost inside your ear, right?

 Quit playing dumb charades. Its not a good idea to make your disappointment so obvious to the DJ. Making faces just isnt done, says Anshul. Revolving gestures and thumbs down from the dance floor is putting off. Please remember that too many people have to be pleased, adds Girish.

 Write out your request and send it to the console. True, on a crazily busy night it wont help much, but writing your choice normally does the trick, says Anshul.

 Charm your song through. Heres the basic know how sure to make your notes ring out. Begin by complimenting the DJ. Smile and then politely ask if he/she has your pick. Dont be bossy, never be rude because the way Girish sees it, orders are for the bar counter and requests are for the console.

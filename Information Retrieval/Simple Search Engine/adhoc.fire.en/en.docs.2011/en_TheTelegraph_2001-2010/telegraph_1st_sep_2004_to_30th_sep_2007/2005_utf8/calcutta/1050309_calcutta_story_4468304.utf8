 Having failed to run the Kona truck terminal, the state government has decided to hand it over to a private party. 

 An expression of interest from willing companies is set to be floated on Wednesday.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) had started constructing the terminal on a 71-acre plot, off Kona Expressway, three km from Vidyasagar Setu, in the late 1990s. Even after spending nearly Rs 10 crore, the project is not ready.

 The terminal was partially opened, but the response from truck-owners was poor, and the project was all but abandoned.

 Another truck terminal, built by a private party and the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation, was subsequently opened at Dhulagarh, about six km from Kona.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, while inaugurating the state-of-the-art Dhulagarh terminal last July, had praised the private party for taking the initiative.

 Bhattacharjee later directed urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya to hand over the Kona terminal to a private party.

 The chief minister also asked Bhattacharya to first offer it to the builder of the Dhulagarh terminal. 

 ?There are some areas in which entrepreneurs have performed better than the government,?? the chief minister had commented.

 Urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar said that several reasons, including a funds crunch, were responsible for the terminal not being completed.

 Besides, the government did not want to pump in funds when private parties were interested in doing so, he added.

 The private party intending to take over the Kona truck terminal will have to invest funds required to complete the project and take full responsibility to maintain and run it. 

 The company will also have to pay an annual fee to the CMDA.

 The CMDA has drawn up a detailed plan for the development of the terminal and private parties will have to follow the plan while completing the project. The land cannot be used for any other purpose.

 The terminal, once completed, will be able to house at least 1,000 trucks. 

 It will also have warehouses, fuel pumps, emission-test centres, rest houses, eateries, a wholesale trading centre and a commercial complex. 

 A housing complex for drivers and staff will also be built inside the terminal.

 Managing director of the Dhulagarh truck terminal Ram Ratan Chowdhury said the purpose of setting up truck terminals would be fulfilled only if the government could ensure entry of trucks there.

 ?We are finding it difficult to run the Dhulagarh terminal, as thousands of trucks park on the road instead of using the terminal. The practice has to be stopped,? he added.

 A daily labourer in his mid-40s was trapped when a portion of the trench he was digging on Taratala Road gave way, burying him alive around 11.15 am on Thursday.

 A group of eight labourers was digging a trench to lay CESC high-tension cables. Birendra Bhakat was in the middle of the 3-ft deep trench, along with four others, while his other colleagues were at a distance, when suddenly a huge mound of earth crashed on him. 

 Even before he would cry for help and save himself, three other huge mounds came down one after another on him, completely trapping the man. Four others who were working beside Bhakat were injured. By the time others had raised an alarm and the CESC officers came to their rescue along with fire fighters and policemen, Bhakat had succumbed to his injuries. 

 Minutes after the accident, the stretch of Taratala Road connecting Garden Reach Road was cut off, throwing traffic out of gear. Cops from Garden Reach police station cordoned off the stretch of the road for over an hour to facilitate rescue operation. Traffic started moving from 12.20 pm after a police picket was placed near the accident site. 

 ?We are on the lookout for the contractor, as well as the supervisor of the project. A police picket on the spot will ensure that today?s accident is not repeated,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (port).

 Eight labourers from Bihar started digging the road around 10 in the morning to lay cables. They took turns to dig a stretch and then lay a part of the cable before moving ahead. A few officers from the CESC?s distribution wing were present when the work began. 

 ?Around 11.15 am we heard screams for help. We ran to the spot and found a labourer trapped inside, trying to extricate himself. We tried to help him but in vain,? said eyewitness Suren Naskar, a tea-shop owner.

 The CESC said it would probe the accident and work out a compensation package for the victim?s family.

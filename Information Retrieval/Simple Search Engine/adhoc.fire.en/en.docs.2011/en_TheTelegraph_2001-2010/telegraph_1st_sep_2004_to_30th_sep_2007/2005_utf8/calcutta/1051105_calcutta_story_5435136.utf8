 Storm and the redemption

 When infirmity holds one back, nature, books and companionship help fight the war of attrition between body and youthful mind, says Samir Mukerjee

 When one has permanent physical handicaps, it is necessary to come to terms with the infirmities in question and find ways of enjoying life without being held back. I am burdened with a body that does not always obey my instructions. Physical immobility cannot be wished away and might often lead to a feeling of entrapment. Fortunately, there are compensations in my own surroundings, in nature?s largesse and the warm relationship with kindred spirits. As a result, the hours are crowded with glorious life. 

 We are fortunate to have a compound dotted with plants and trees ? a world within a world which has healing powers and can be a source of quiet bliss. The open verandah helps me to get as close to nature as possible. In the early mornings, all the fresh aromas head in my direction. A couple of speckled doves moan away behind the greenery where they can?t always be spotted. The eternal woodpecker strikes away at the tree trunk ? unvarying over the years. Small black and white birds with a shrill whistle flit in and out of the banana leaves. The golden oreole, refined and respectable, adds a touch of dignity to the birdsong we are treated to. 

 When the gardener appears with a broom and a benign smile, he becomes a metaphor for stability and continuity. Wherever there are leaves to be collected, wherever there are seeds to be planted, there will always be a gardener ready to pluck the bel fruits from the overloaded tree and bring down the cluster of bananas to ripen indoors. When he finally lights a monumental bonfire, the halcyon childhood days come back in their innocence. These are the blessings which make life bearable in spite of a slow physical disintegration. 

 Books are ideal companions as they entertain and instruct. They offer glimpses of unknown worlds only to sharpen my perspective. They offer chiselled prose which encourages me to improve my craftsmanship. They probe and dissect characters which offer insights into the working of the human psyche and the frailties that ambush human beings at every step. Authors like Iris Murdoch, Margaret Drabble, Anita Brookner, Evelyn Waugh, Amos Oz, Isabel Allende and Milan Kundera provide the sort of ballast I need in a tottering world. 

 Since my life is more or less house-bound, music comes to my rescue to lift me to heights of ecstasy. I?ve always been fond of Indian classical music so a Darbari Kanara or Malkaus late in the evening, when the street noises begin to subside, can lead to euphoria. It provides the sort of catharsis one needs to be purged of impurities. A well-known musician once told me that all day we work in some capacity or another and our selves get splintered. The Darbari brings a sense of wholeness and helps us regain what we lost in the middle of our distractions during the day. These rapturous moments take care of the daily anxieties and the niggling pains and aches which are constant irritants. 

 I?ve always been fond of reading poetry as a means of clearing the air and breathing more freely. Whenever the body plays up I fall back on Tagore?s long poems like Barsho Shesh, Shah Jehan, Jete Nahi Dibo, Ebar Phirao More, Ashesh and Mrittur Pore. The dead leaves are blown away at once. A benign blue sky with fleecy clouds begins to preside over my destiny. The amplification of life seems within sight. I knew that somewhere else there were cool meadows, flowers and healing waters. That?s where these poems took me. It?s fun to court Pablo Neruda who remained doggedly faithful to his physical senses, the passionate and compassionate acceptance of what is. The welter of the physical world ? natural, human, tangible, livable attracted him. Some of his love poems left a lingering fragrance behind. I quote below some lines which wake us up from our slumber and nourish our sensibilities ?

 ?In this time of the swollen grape

 The wine begins to come to life

 Between the sea and the mountain ranges

 In Chile now, cherries are dancing

 The dark mysterious girls are singing 

 And in guitars, water is shining.? 

 There is a touch of Babette?s Feast here, a celebration of life in which I share. 

 Human companionship can work wonders by way of intelligent conversation, a barrage of badinage, repartees and ripostes, anecdotes, dissection of books, films and plays and last but not least, spontaneous laughter which unshackles us. Every other evening, friends turn up with boxes of pastries and sweets and open smiles. They come from different climates, different cultures, different persuasions.

 Writer Amit Chaudhuri and his equally gifted wife, Rinka, are regular visitors. There is no subject under the sun which we cannot discuss freely with them. An attractive English woman, Charlotte Hayward, is a member of our magic circle. She is no averse to a peripatetic life and has lot to say about the places she visits and the people she meets. She is as interested in Calcutta?s hawkers as she is in Benedictine ashrams somewhere in South India.

 Nandita Das, a frequent visitor, is a versatile actress and social activist. She leads a very productive life where her far-reaching interests and commitments come into full play. She talks eloquently about good cinema, the domestic violence and discrimination our women are subjected to, the needs of underprivileged children and the rationale of feminism in Third World countries. When a beautiful woman is also as sharp as a razor, the combination is explosive. 

 My niece, Paroma Chatterjee, is an infant prodigy. Apart from her command over half a dozen European languages and her intimate knowledge of Western and Oriental art, she is a remarkable raconteur who crosses frontiers with the agility of a gazelle and picks up exciting stories and impressions. Whenever she sat in our drawing room, we were spellbound by her scintillating conversation. In this world, many are called but few are chosen. She belongs to the privileged minority. There are others as well who come and go with their offerings and we get as much as we can out of them. 

 My wife Anita has been a tower of strength right from the time we got married in 1968. Her deep solicitude for my physical and mental welfare has kept me going. Without this unique partnership, the solidity of my life would not have been there.

 The war of attrition between the decaying body and a mind that longs to fresh and young goes on relentlessly. In a changing world, the familiar landmarks disappear. My wife and I inhabit an enclave which enables us to preserve some kind of continuity in our lives. In failing light one?s inner life receives a spurt and every sound, every wafting fragrance, every little change of scene becomes infinitely precious.

 Colour code for the cops

 - Spot an officer by his car

 A STAFF REPORTER 

WHOS WHO 

 Red with blue border: 

Officers-incharge (OCs), additional OCs

 Blue with police logo on the border: Assistant 

commissioners

 Jet Black: Deputy commissioners

From basic blue to blazing red, see the cops in their 

true colours. In an attempt to give the city police a new face, commissioner Prasun 

Mukherjee has decided to introduce colour schemes for cars being used by senior 

officers. 

 While this will not only help identify vehicles, it will also make the officers more visible to the masses. 

 By the new order, all police station officers-in-charge, assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners will have an individual colour code for their vehicles ? a norm that was in place years ago. 

 With 48 police stations across the city, this new code will ensure a new look for over 100 vehicles that are regularly used by officers on the job. 

 ?The days of old jeeps are gone and it?s time to usher in the new. With the new colour code, people will be able to identify almost immediately the presence of a senior officer in a particular zone. This system was in place earlier. I have just decided to revive it,? explained the police commissioner.

 But insiders see something more in this plain logic: it?s a simple way to increase the accountability of officers.

 While the new colour code will not only make the people sit up and take note of the presence of officers, it will also help the superiors keep track of their subordinates. 

 ?If the officer-in-charge of a particular police station arrives late for an case, people will be able to report it to his seniors. The same holds true for other officers, too,? said a senior officer-in-charge of a police station in the central division. 

 His has been one of the first lot of cars that have been sent to conform to the new code. If not the officers, the change in colour schemes has delighted the juniors in the force. Most feel that officers will now think twice before using the car for purposes other than official. 

 Misuse of cars is nothing new in the police force. From markets and malls to theatres and clubs, police cars have been sighted at different places at different times, kicking off a furious cry over the definition of ?office duty?. 

 The top brass believe that part of the misuse can be put under check with the new code in place. ?At least we will save precious fuel,? quipped one.

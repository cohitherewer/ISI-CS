 Rs 80,000 compensation for vision loss

 - Consumer commission holds surgeon guilty of negligence

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed a city-based eye surgeon to pay a compensation of Rs 80,000 to a patient for damaging her eye during an operation. The damage led to loss of vision.

 Sandhya Majumdar, 65, a resident of Picnic Garden, was having eye problems after developing cataract, so she went to eye surgeon M.M. Patra. After examining her and conducting several tests, the doctor recommended surgery.

 During the operation, the surgeon implanted the intra-ocular lens (IOL) in the anterior chamber of the eye, instead of the posterior chamber.

 Majumdar said she was in severe pain after the surgery and consulted Patra, who prescribed a medicine. The pain did not subside even after the medicine was changed several times.

 ?Instead of going away, the pain amplified,? recounted Majumdar. 

 When the medicines failed to work, she contacted another eye clinic. After a check-up, the doctors there issued the following report: ?The left eye showed no posterior capsule. IOL in the anterior chamber touching the iris is causing recurrent iritis. She may need IOL removal if the iritis attacks become frequent or persistent, causing severe pain.?

 The consumer commission said in its order: ??as per the evidence, it is shown that such pain was due to implanting the IOL in the wrong place by the doctor. For the negligence and deficiency on part of the doctor and for this much of suffering undergone by the complainant, we are inclined to hold that both ends of justice will be met if the amount of compensation is fixed at Rs 75,000 in all.? 

 The forum has directed the surgeon to pay an additional Rs 5,000 for compensation of litigation costs.

 Surgeon Patra denied the allegations. ?There might have been post-operation complications, but that was neither due to ignorance nor was it intentional,? he said.

 ?There was no problem during the surgery. Any patient can develop post-operation complications and in this case, they were tackled,? Patra added.

 The doctor said he was speaking to his insurance company in this regard. He claimed that Majumdar?s vision loss was not related to the surgery. ?Anyone can lose vision within five years of a surgery,? Patra pointed out.

 He claimed the IOL was implanted in the anterior chamber since there was a rupture in the posterior chamber.

 The commission, however, found the explanation unsatisfactory. It observed in its order: ?This is certainly an instance of negligence and deficiency on the part of the doctor.?

 Majumdar had further alleged that the surgeon never checked the intra-ocular pressure before the surgery.

 ?In this sphere also, there has been proof of medical negligence on the part of the doctor,? the commission ruled.

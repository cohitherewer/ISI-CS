 Live-ins are in, in reel amp; real life

 - Time, temperament prime movers in trend of unmarried togetherness

 Salaam Namaste and Neal ?n? Nikki: Sharing space sans marriage 

 Nikhil and Ambar did it successfully earlier this year ? so says the box-office ? and Neal plans to do it this December. From Salaam Namaste to Neal ?n? Nikki, Bollywood is learning to live-in. 

 In the real world, the Nikhils and the Neals are doing it quietly, but with growing confidence ? and regularity. Meet 24-year-old Hem and her 26-year-old boyfriend, Vishal, living-in for the past year. They met at their workplace, and moved in together after a brief courtship. And they are two from a growing tribe of young boys and girls taking the live-in route.

 The positives, they say, are plenty: spending time together despite hectic work schedules; putting the relationship to the compatibility test; strengthening bonds before tying the knot; balancing professional and personal lives. 

 The pitfalls, they add, aren?t too few: parents who fret or fume, neighbours who frown, landlords who are reluctant to rent a place, the personal and social consequences of a break-up.

 ?Both of us work late nights, so a live-in adjustment was the best way to spend time together,? says Hem, manager of a popular nightclub in town. 

 If time is the prime mover for some, temperament is the decider for others. For them, it is definitely a look-before-you-leap measure. 

 ?Living together helps to know your partner?s temperament, threshold level and idiosyncrasies. You either re-model yourself accordingly or move on,? says young entrepreneur Kabir, whose two-year live-in relationship didn?t work out.

 Financial independence is a big factor in youngsters taking such a plunge. Anjan Ghosh, faculty, Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, says: ?The trend is catching on amongst the upwardly mobile. The industrial boom is giving the youngsters an opportunity to become independent.?

 But if today?s generation is open to sharing space without marriage, they must first find a space to share. ?We faced a big problem in renting a flat. Even after a year, we have to encounter probing eyes,? admits Hem, who finally found a place on Lake View Road.

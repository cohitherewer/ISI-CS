 In fear of the ?creature?

 - TRAIL OF BANANA TERROR

 Terror has gripped all 10 floors of a building on Shakespeare Sarani. Nobody is quite sure what it is ? some call it a cat, others a mongoose, and it is in all probability a civet ? but the furry little creature is creating havoc in Sukh Sadan, with residents even shutting doors and windows after dark.

 A week ago, when Swati Ray, on the 10th floor, heard her bird screeching at night, she rushed to find the pet hopping around in the cage and ?the animal? attacking it. By the time her husband heard her cries for help, the animal had jumped out of the window and disappeared.

 Her neighbour Farida?s flat on the same floor has been raided thrice, with bananas and apples eaten and left scattered. Afraid for her children, she now shuts all the windows at night. Two floors below, Zeba Rehman had to give away her three-year-old son?s pet chicks to her driver, after they were attacked by ?the creature?.

 ?One morning, when I woke up at 5, my living room, including the furniture, was littered with banana peels. I was terrified. Since then, I keep my windows closed at night, even if it?s hot,? says the mother of two.

 On the same floor, Nahid Arshad has more tales of banana terror to tell. On the fourth floor, the Singh family children often sleep in the living room. One night, they were attacked by ?the creature?.

 When Karan, a teenager, tried to defend himself with a pillow, the animal ?bared its teeth and prepared to attack?. The kids shouted for help and the animal fled out of the window. One resident was, reportedly, attacked on the staircase.

 The residents speculate that the animal lives on a plot of land behind Sukh Sadan, which is overgrown with trees, shrubs and undergrowth. Some have spotted it on the trees, others have seen it lounging on the building?s boundary wall. But most are caught unawares by its presence on their windowsills.

 ?We are all very afraid, because the animal isn?t afraid of us. It attacks and we are scared for our children. But we don?t know what to do. All we want is for some NGO to catch it and take it away,? says Swati Ray.

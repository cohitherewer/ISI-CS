 Marital blues: The 

 court as counsellor 

 The decree of the nation?s highest 

 consumer court that Ruby General Hospital must pay damages 

 of Rs 10 lakh for refusing to provide emergency treatment 

 to an accident victim provides a glimpse of hope for the 

 hapless patients of West Bengal (Damages slap for death, 

 April 28). 

 The court has observed that the doctors and staff in the hospital emergency room threw out a dying Sumanta Mukherjee after minimal treatment for failure to pay Rs 15,000. The 20-year-old died on his way to another hospital. 

 It is impossible to imagine a more heinous crime. The young man lost his life because the rich and merciless medical businessmen hardly care for human lives and are only interested in amassing wealth. But there is no denying that these merchants could not have reaped profits from patients without the implicit support of the doctors and the devious heads of healthcare in the state. 

 Unfortunately, the penalty is not enough to bother the private hospitals, which profit in lakhs on a daily basis from countless vulnerable patients, who often have no choice but to go bankrupt to treat their loved ones at these clinics, thanks to the hellish condition of the affordable state hospitals. 

 There is little reason to believe that the judgment is going to change the attitude of the private clinic owners. 

 Although a doctor has the right to refuse treatment, he is obligated, both legally and ethically, to attend to a patient in an emergency. Section 2.1.1 of the Code of Ethics Regulations, 2002, of the Medical Council of India mandates: ?In case of emergency, a doctor must treat the patient?. A failure to adhere to the rule constitutes ?professional misconduct? for which the delinquent doctor is liable to face disciplinary action. 

 It is ironic that the doctors and medical staff who were actually responsible for Sumanta?s death would go unpunished. Is this justice?

 A judgment should always aim to unite people rather than cause a rift between them (Court sends couple to Puri for patch-up, April 28). The decision to send a warring couple to Puri was obviously intended to break the psychological barrier between them and help them develop a healthy relationship. It is great to see the court play such a positive role in resolving a matrimonial dispute.

 The order of the judges that sent 

 a couple to Puri, eventually helping them to unite was unique 

 and praiseworthy (Couple to stay together, May 3). The judgment 

 should set a precedent. Parents should be legally accountable 

 for their role in breaking up their children?s marriage. 

 Social organisations can also play an important part in 

 helping couples stay together.

 Your coverage of the publication of ICSE and ISC results on May 19 has caused furore among the principals of district schools affiliated to CISCE. Why do you forget that apart from elite city schools like La Martiniere, Welland Gouldsmith and Don Bosco, there are plenty of old and new CISCE schools in Chandernagore, Seoraphuli, Rishra and Liluah whose students produce excellent results, sometimes better than the results of the students of Calcutta schools. The success of the district schools need to be highlighted, too. They are making the best use of what is available to them in terms of teachers, students and amenities/aids. All students of MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth passed this year, with the topper scoring 92.6 per cent.

 Apropos the report ?Killer with a swagger?, April 28, it is really unfortunate that three years were taken by the court to condemn seven persons involved in the attack on American Center. Justice, however, has finally been delivered. 

 Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake. 

 The court has taken far too long 

 to sentence to death the perpetrators of the attack on the 

 American Center. But at least the verdict did not take 14 

 years, like in the case of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was 

 hanged last year.

 Apropos the report ?CMC broom to sweep off cut fruits, fight diarrhoea?, April 28, roadside stalls selling cut fruits, lassi and other drinks mushroom every summer. More often than not the fare served at these stalls is unhygienic. The Corporation and the state health department have so far remained blind to the menace. Let?s hope that they wake up.

 Apropos the report ?Vendor ban in trade hub?, April 30, the court?s ruling that vendors who have encroached footpaths in the business district must be removed is heartening. Besides causing inconvenience, hawkers litter the roads.

 The incident of a 14-year old?s fabrication of self-abduction for money(Teen kidnaps himself, April 30) only goes to show how unrestricted dramatisation of crime in the masala movies and TV shows, are affecting formative minds.

 Apropos ?Next weekend you can be at Galudih?, May 1, the readers have been advised to take a trekker to Galudih from Ghatsila after getting there by Ispat, Steel or Kurla Express. But Kurla Express stops at Galudih.

 The photograph with the article ?Know your jewels better? (Goodlife, May 25) was not taken at Sawansukha Jeweller, on which the write-up is based. The article also states that Sawansukha Jeweller is situated on Ho Chi Minh Sarani, while the correct address is Little Russel Street.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Post-Puja flag-off for four key projects

 - GROWTH QUARTET

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has kicked off four major infrastructure projects in and around the city.

 Work on the Kona logistic hub, Dankuni housing project, Barrackpore-Kalyani Expressway and the flyover at the EM Bypass-Ultadanga crossing will start after the Pujas.

 A host of legal hurdles, including land acquisition problems and a funds crunch, had stood in the way of the projects? implementation. The ball was set rolling after a series of meetings last week. The final bidding took place on August 10, 11 and 12.

 ?The plans will be sent to a committee of secretaries for final scrutiny and work will start by November. Some other projects, too, will kick off around the same time,? said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).

 All the projects will be implemented through public-private partnership.

 For the Kona logistic hub, to come up on 108 acres, two private firms have submitted technical and financial bids. 

 The memorandum of understanding will be signed once the committee of secretaries, headed by the principal secretary of the urban development department, okays the bids.

 Eleven parties have submitted bids for the Dankuni township project, which is likely to be functional, at least partly, by 2011. A committee has been set up to acquire land for the township, which will also have educational and entertainment facilities. Around 1,000 of the 5,010 acres will be developed as an industrial hub.

 The township will be a 20-minute drive from the airport once the second Vivekananda Setu and a connecting expressway are ready.

 Bid documents for the 41-km Barrackpore-Kalyani Expressway, which will be extended by six km to Dum Dum and widened from four to six lanes, were finalised last week. 

 ?The private party implementing the project will also be given the right to collect toll,? a senior urban development official said.

 The bidding for the EM Bypass-Ultadanga flyover will be completed by September. The 1,200-metre flyover from the Bypass-Duttabad crossing to Ultadanga will help motorists to and from the airport avoid the regular congestion at the Ultadanga crossing.

 Plans have also been drawn for planting 20,000 trees on the entire stretch of EM Bypass during the monsoon, Baviskar said. ?A fund of Rs 15 lakh has been provided to the state forest department for this.?

 The public-private partnership for the infrastructure projects, however, has drawn criticism from the CMDA employees? unions. 

 ?Our organisation is engineering-oriented. If private parties handle the projects, our manpower will not be utilised properly,? said P.B. Nag, joint general secretary of Development Employees? Joint Action Committee.

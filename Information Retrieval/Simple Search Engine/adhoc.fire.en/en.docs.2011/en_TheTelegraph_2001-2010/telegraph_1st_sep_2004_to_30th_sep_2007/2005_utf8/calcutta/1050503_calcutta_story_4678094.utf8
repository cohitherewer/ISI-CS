 Firm set on pie upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With small and medium businesses (SMB) across the globe realising the benefits of computerisation and embracing technology for improving efficiency, city-based IT firm Matrix Infosystems is targeting ambitious growth numbers.

 ?The signals are positive as companies are willing to spend on technology. We expect our revenues to cross Rs 16 crore next fiscal,? said Alok Agarwal, managing director, Matrix Infosystems.

 The company, which provides enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions to SMBs, did business worth Rs 10 crore in the last financial year.

 Its product, MatrixERP, is not only popular among Indian companies, but is also used by firms in West Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America, along with Southeast Asia. From payroll and HR to finance and web-based interfaces, the product offers a host of applications.

 ?We are in the international market for the past year and we are targeting over 40 per cent of our revenues from overseas,? said Agarwal, who set up the company before the IT boom, in 1990, with the objective of developing small business applications. 

 But the ERP business started around five years ago and product development took around four years before Matrix hit the market.

 Its list of clients includes Monginis, Rollick Ice cream, Mani Group, Sanjeevani Group, Radio City, besides a host of international clients engaged in food processing, construction and entertainment businesses. 

 ?We have over 20 overseas partners and tie-ups with vendors across India. Selling and servicing is done by using their networks. The model is effective,? said Agarwal, who is bullish about the growth in market size despite competition from Tier I ERP solution providers like SAP, Oracle and PeopleSoft.

 The company has drawn up an aggressive ramping up plan. ?We have around 120 people on our rolls and we will be 200 by the end of the fiscal,? Agarwal added. Besides, the firm is also looking for a facility in Rajarhat and is in touch with the government?s IT department for land.

 Fish figure for funds and fame

Feng Shui Matters 

 Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui rules, showpieces depicting fish and dolphins are best placed in the north, east or south-east of the living room. This enhances business, health and wealth, respectively

Q: We picked up lots of decorative objects recently while on a vacation abroad. These are figures of dolphins, fish, family of birds, white glass doves, windmills, horses, amethyst rocks, crystal mobiles without rods and a beautiful family tree. Please guide me regarding their placement in the house.

 Bindia Jaipuria

 The Solution: Place the white glass doves that are symbolic of peace in the zone of serenity, which is the north-east corner of any room. Dolphins, fish and windmills are best placed in the north, east or south-east of the living room to enhance business, health and wealth respectively. Family of birds, along with the family tree that has photographs of all the members, should be placed in the east of any room. This helps to keep the family well bonded. You can compliment the stable element of earth that rules the south-west area by placing amethyst rocks and crystal mobiles that do not make sound. Figures of running horses that represent the fire element help you gallop away with name, fame and recognition when placed in the south. But do not place the ones that seem to be in an attacking posture or look tired.

 Music mantra

 Q: I am very interested in music since my childhood and want to pursue it as a career. I particularly like to play drums. Please suggest ways in which I can make a successful career in music.

 Arindam Guha

 The Solution: Choose a room in the western part of the house for practising, as this is the creativity sector. Your hidden talents will surface and your performance will improve. Place the drums in the north-west corner of this room to stimulate Chi connected with movement and travel. This will help you move ahead in your career. Place pictures of goddess Saraswati and that of a famous musician who is your mentor in the north-west area of your room. You should always practice your drums facing the north and hang a painting that depicts a person climbing stairs. This picture will work as an inspiration and you should visualise yourself climbing the ladder of success in your chosen profession.

 Kitchen code 

 Q: I have recently bought a spacious flat where the kitchen is in the eastern part. Since the kitchen is very big we would like to have a small island in the centre with a stove and a preparation counter here. The other option is to have a small dining table in the centre. Alternatively, the dining table can be placed in the north-west of the kitchen. Which will be the most Feng Shui-friendly arrangement?

 Sanjana Ghosh

 The Solution: A kitchen in the eastern part of the flat is extremely auspicious. However, I cannot say the same for either of your two options. When an island is built in the sacred centre of the kitchen, its weight blocks the spiritual energy that originates from here and prevents it from radiating throughout the room. Similarly it is not advisable to place the dining table in the centre. When it is placed in the north-west area, the unsteady energy ruling here will make the family rush through the food resulting in bad digestion. The best place for it would be the western part of the kitchen. 

 Balcony basics

 Q: I have a spacious balcony in the east of the flat. Could you please help me with the colours and elements that should be introduced here to enhance the energy of this area?

 Raksha Anand

 The Solution: A balcony facing east receives the blessings of the rising sun. This blesses the entire household with its life-giving force and with it brings new opportunities for the residents. It is a blessing to have windows and balconies in this part of the house. The ruling element is wood that is nourished by the water element and their respective colours are green and blue. You can place a water fountain or a sprinkler here with a well-cut round crystal as a backdrop hanging from the balcony. When the sun?s rays fall on the droplets of water rising and falling from the fountain or a sprinkler, they give the effect of shimmering rainbow colours. Similarly when the light from the sun reflects through the crystal it breaks into seven sparkling rainbow colours and spreads like magic across the house. Adding fresh green plants here further raises the energy level and you must enjoy the environment and absorb wonderful vibrations. The upholstery could have a blend of blue and green hues.

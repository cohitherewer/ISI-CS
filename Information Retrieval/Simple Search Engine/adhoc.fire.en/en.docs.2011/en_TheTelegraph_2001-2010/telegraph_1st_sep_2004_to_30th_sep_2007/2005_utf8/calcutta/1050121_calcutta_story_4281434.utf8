Big step for little ones 

Child rights were firmly in focus when CRY launched 

a unique campaign in Calcutta this week to take the movement to the masses. Sreejita

The seeds of an effort were planted at Millennium 

Park on Thursday. Danseuse Amita Dutta, musician Bikram Ghosh, theatre personality 

Usha Ganguli and actress June were among those who came together from different 

walks of life to pledge support for the Pinwheel Campaign organised by CRY (Child 

Relief and You). 

Millennium Park witnessed the planting of 12,000 pinwheels 

that were gathered in east India over the course of the campaign.

?The campaign was basically organised to celebrate 

25 years of CRY. Instead of having a simple fund-raising concert, we decided to 

take the movement to the masses, quot; explained Mohua Chatterjee of CRY. 

The focus of the campaign was on transferring the 

onus to the citizens. Armed with a Children?s Manifesto, volunteers urged people 

from all walks of life to sign a pinwheel and support the cause of child rights. 

Among others, the manifesto demanded that government 

expenditure on education and health be increased to 10 and 5 per cent, all children 

between six to 18 years be enrolled in formal, full-time schools without discrimination 

and children below six be put in anganwadis. It also sought prohibition 

of child labour across all sectors.

?We chose the pinwheel because it is a childlike and 

universal symbol of freedom. People who pledged support by signing a pinwheel 

also had to pay a sum of Rs 10 and were given badges saying they supported the 

cause. We were initially sceptical about asking for money but then decided it 

was necessary. In this way people were at least making a financial commitment, 

however small,? said Soha Moitra of CRY.

However, the chief strength of the campaign lay in 

the organisation?s effective use of its volunteer base. The awareness campaign 

started with the volunteers.

?The campaign was an eye opener for many of our volunteers. 

Before approaching people they had to make sure that they knew about the existing 

situation of child rights in India themselves,? added Moitra.

The volunteers also got a first-hand taste of the 

disinterest, apathy and complacency of the average man.

?The moment we explained that we were asking for Rs 

10 as a pledge for the cause, people waved us aside,? said D. Beena, a student 

of applied economics at Presidency College and a volunteer with CRY for one-and-a-half 

years. 

?In departmental stores where we had put up stalls, 

people would just not listen. Those who had children with them signed a pinwheel 

on sentimental grounds but weren?t interested to know what the manifesto said,? 

said Aparajita Dasgupta, another student of Presidency College. 

But the campus response of the campaign was considerable. 

?At Calcutta University, I got a platform to speak and the students were genuinely 

interested to know what they could do,? Beena recalled. ?Also, at Calcutta Trade 

Fair, people came up to our stall and asked what they could do to help.?

Neeraj Agarwal, working with PricewaterhouseCoopers 

(PWC) and a volunteer with CRY since his student days at Jadavpur University, 

felt that the lack of exposure was the reason behind the disinterest of most people. 

Neeraj was instrumental in setting up a stall at the PWC canteen which sold 200 

pinwheels in three hours. Other corporates that came forward included TCS and 

IBM.

?The apathy can be turned into concern by going to 

people and speaking to them,? suggests Neeraj.

?What we are trying to do is essentially generate 

awareness about issues,? said CRY?s Moitra. ?But for any movement to be successful, 

everyone needs to chip in.?

 Whats on your mind this 

week 

Dress 

distress

The issue of teachers having a dress code is becoming 

a mountain from a molehill. I don?t know why what teachers wear should be such 

a big problem. The youth are like lumps of clay, moulded according to societal 

specifications. The surrounding environment plays a major role in sculpting the 

mind. The young are constantly exposed to different situations and circumstances. 

So whatever blame is to be thrown at students for not accepting unorthodox attitudes 

and behaviour is partly because of adults. Children are fragile, and can be manipulated. 

Having a dress code for teachers in schools is a bit dicey, because after a certain 

stage, one needs liberty to express ones likes and dislikes. There shouldn?t be 

extremes, but variety is the spice of life.

Sergeant salute

Remember January 1, 2003? It was a day to wish everyone 

a happy and prosperous new year. Instead, the city woke up to headlines of a Calcutta 

traffic police sergeant in hospital after trying to save a girl from molestation. 

Bapi Sen died a few days later. The matter did not end there. It continued ? a 

boy was stabbed to death in Kalyani as he stood up against eve-teasing in a private 

bus, a husband was thrown out of a bus as he protested the molestation of his 

wife, a driver of an MLA was taken out of house, cut to pieces which were dumped 

in front of his house for protesting violence against women. They did not know 

that violence against women is a common feature in this country and protesting 

against it means harassment and death. In neither of the cases did the onlookers 

protest. Its high-profile nature forced the authorities to put behind bars the 

killers of Bapi Sen, a good thing that happened last year. Eve-teasing has gone 

up to such an extent that even the chief minister?s daughter was insulted in Gariahat. 

Tagore said a country can never progress until women get full freedom. Into the 

sixth year of the new millennium, the big question remains ? are the women in 

our country safe and independent? The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind. 

All of us know that time is running out. Something needs to be done now.

Clear the air

The winter air in Calcutta is highly toxic, leaving 

children gasping for breath. Calcuttans are suffering from acute respiratory diseases. 

The West Bengal government, which claims to be conscious and progressive, has 

repeatedly failed the people, despite a high court order to meet deadlines of 

auto-emission norms. The government also made a false promise of setting up 50 

testing centres, upgrading only three so far. I am really at a loss to understand 

how our chief minister can be so indifferent to the condition of people seriously 

affected by air pollution, suffering from diseases and living off inhalers and 

drugs. It proves that the West Bengal government has little concern for the health 

of the people who live in the state. This delay and slackness is condemnable. 

The authorities must now, instead of passing the buck, immediately set up the 

required testing centres to check if vehicles are conforming to the new tailpipe 

emission norms and ban all vehicles over 15 years from plying on the roads. And, 

if this is not done on an emergency basis, air pollution, rampant in Calcutta, 

will soon get out of hand.

Tsunami 

Red ? Not passion but blood 

White ? Not purity but death 

Blue ? Not eternity but poison 

Yellow ? Not smile but rage 

Black ? Not determination but evil 

Life a new persona all together 

Bearing the cachet of rampant destruction. 

The Journey from paradise to necropolis 

It took only a few seconds... 

But it will remain etched in the minds 

Of each witness of the cataclysm 

Water, water everywhere, even more water 

But still there is an unquenched thirst 

A thirst not to live but to survive 

A prayer not for happiness 

But for a few more heartbeats 

But still people say believe in God 

He always does good.

Only I

It is the song in my heart, 

That with which I cannot part. 

The feeling of life, of being, 

Understanding nothing, but seeing. 

The feeling of being someone 

In this wide world, of no one, 

To be, to live, to carry on, 

Draw my life?s sketch with a crayon 

In the colour of the sky ? 

It is nothing but a feeling, 

Nothing but Only I.

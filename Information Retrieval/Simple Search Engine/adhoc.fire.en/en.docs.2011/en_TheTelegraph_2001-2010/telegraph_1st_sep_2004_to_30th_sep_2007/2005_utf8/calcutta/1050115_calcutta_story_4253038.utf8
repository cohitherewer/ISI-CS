The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Luminous faces exempt from dust

Their ways were impeccable, their manners elegant. Samir 

Mukerjee recalls individuals shaped by days of the Raj

Westernized indians have become an extinct species 

now and with them gone, an entire way of life has been obliterated. During British 

rule, the sun shone on them and they never put a foot wrong as far as their own 

values were concerned. 

My mother?s friend Sudhira Bhagat, better known as 

Cissy Bhagat, was one such extraordinary example of a smart, elegant, soign? and 

sophisticated lady who left an indelible imprint on the minds of those who had 

the good fortune of knowing her.

Her house in Ranchi, with the quaint name of Arlosh, 

was like a red-brick English country cottage with an extensive flower garden and 

an attractive gazebo covered with brilliant bougainvilleas. Her lunch parties 

in her Theatre Road flat were a gourmet?s delight. The dishes were carefully chosen, 

the garnishes were meticulously served and the table was impeccably arranged. 

She had a tremendous sense of fun and often derided 

the sort of people who lacked finesse but went on splurges abroad. Good taste 

and culture eluded them and wealth alone was the driving force. Towards the end 

of her life she wrote me some very interesting letters where she kept encouraging 

me to write serious articles and even branch out into short stories. She had read 

some of the letters I wrote for newpapers but wanted me to operate on a bigger 

scale and choose a broader canvas. 

She was steeped in Western classical music, which 

her elder daughter Lolita ultimately took up as her vocation. Educated in a school 

in England, her language was colourful and clipped and the coruscating wit that 

she displayed on occasions made her company that much more exciting. She always 

seemed amused by the pecadilloes of our crude and insular political leaders. She 

found their antics hilarious and extremely annoying at the same time and was ideally 

positioned to observe the juvenile frolics of a nation caught between hoary tradition 

and aggressive modernity.

Her dying of lung cancer was perhaps the unkindest 

cut of all ? how could her natural ebullience be snuffed out by such an outrageous 

assault? The age of connoisseurs will never smile on us again. 

A few years ago a delightful English couple, Catrine 

and John Clay, came to visit us in Calcutta. Catrine?s father and grandfather 

had spent some time in this city during the Raj and she had come to discover if 

her father?s school, La Martiniere for Boys, had any records of their old student. 

Her grandfather was in the Calcutta Police and after a lot of patient enquiries 

she landed up at the Entally thana which he headed in those days. Strangely 

enough, she got a royal reception there by the present incumbents and saw the 

quarters which her grandfather had occupied. She was offered sweets and garlands 

and made to feel quite at home. I wonder what she thought of the seedy and shabby 

police station itself which didn?t have time for a facelift before she came. 

Catrine had done a valuable documentary on the British 

royal family and knew the members moderately well. She knew all about the Queen?s 

culinary preferences and Princess Diana?s capricious habits. She mentioned in 

passing that Diana had a lot of beauty and charm but was often like a loose cannon 

whose movements were difficult to control. Catrine had always nursed a desire 

to explore India which her forbears had spent so much time in. She has also done 

two more documentaries on Sir Thomas More and Mary, Queen of Scots; history would 

remain her lifelong companion. 

Her husband John, was tall and powerful looking, and 

an admirable drawing room companion. He was from the Catholic public school, Downside, 

and later on went to Trinity Hall at Cambridge. There was no topic which he wasn?t 

interested in and wasn?t prepared to talk about. Gentle, patient, understanding 

and terribly discreet, any conversation with him had a luminous quality. 

I remember John telling me that for generations English 

Catholicism had been an inward-looking minority, intent upon its own affairs and 

preserving its own institutions. It welcomed individual converts but presented 

an aloof, wary front to the world at large ? a sort of ghetto mentality. All this 

was changing rapidly under the pressure of circumstances. These snippets of information 

were refreshingly honest and brought echoes from a distant world. One longs to 

have him again for another bout of intelligent exchanges. 

Mary Tenduf-La has been running the Windamere Hotel 

in Darjeeling almost from time immemorial with great eclat. She is an inextricable 

part of the brandy and cigar circuit whose subtle bouquet still lingers in the 

air ? at any rate for me. She isn?t, however, the sort of person who would care 

to spend a long holiday at Estoril or Bordighera. 

Whenever she comes to Calcutta, which is twice a year, 

on her way to Bangalore or Cochin, she drops in for a cup of tea with her female 

Jeeves ? an intelligent, caring, spruced up Nepali woman whose acerbic comments 

on the current crop of Darjeeling?s political leaders are worth their weight in 

gold. 

Mrs Tenduf-La keeps on telling us that the hotel must 

always offer personalised service where each customer?s needs could be looked 

after, leaving no room for any complaints. She is an amazingly resilient and gracious 

old lady. She speaks so gently that its often difficult to pick up the words. 

She exudes the sort of inner repose which people today never seem to be able to 

achieve, no matter how many Art of Living classes they may attend. It might be 

her Buddhist prayers and faith in her religion which impart a sense of restfulness 

to her. She leads a disciplined life where ostentation has no place. Everything 

is measured and carefully timed so that there is no waste of energy.

She is on her way to being 100 years early next year 

and when we met in April this year, she talked about a birthday party she might 

arrange on the occasion of her 100th birthday. Although her vision is poor, her 

fingers stiff and her deafness a formidable irritant, she will never let the iridescence 

be blotted out. Dressed impeccably in a colourful baku with exquisite jewellery 

to match and well manicured hands, an embodiment of old world elegance, Mrs Tenduf-La 

will never be defeated by the ravages of time. She wrote to me regularly in her 

own hand till about a few months ago and her letters were never illegible. 

One of the reasons why she has held her ground for 

so long without cracking up is the fact that she has always avoided complexities 

as far as possible. The messiness of life passed her by and a simple austerity 

helped her retain her sanity. Although she lost two of her children and her husband, 

who was a remarkably sprightly and amusing man, she displayed a strange detachment 

whatever might have been the churnings inside. When the hotel staff struck work 

upsetting the even tenor of her life, she remained composed and sought ways of 

dealing with it without going off the handle. With her, one somehow expects ?some 

brightness to hold in trust, some final innocence exempt from dust?.

 Green belt pools vetoed

 The new regime at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) wants to get rid of the two swimming pools on Southern Avenue.

 The Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya-led board started discussions on the fate of the two boulevard pools, each measuring over 3,000 sq ft, following demands from Left Front councillors, elderly residents of the area, morning-walkers and NGOs to clear the boulevard of encroachments.

 The pools, built at a cost of Rs 90 lakh, were inaugurated a few months ago. According to mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera, the pools have turned major traffic hazards, besides being eyesores.

 He will visit the site with civic engineers to decide whether or not to pull them down. 

 Since a large sum of money has already been spent on the pools, the mayor has advised Bera to explore the possibility of putting these to some other use. But the end is definitely near for the duo.

 ?How can any sane man think of constructing such structures after destroying greenery? There are swimming clubs and rowing clubs in nearby Rabindra Sarobar. So there is no need for more swimming pools here,? said mayor Bhattacharya.

 Two swimming pools, one for women and the other for children, came up on Southern Avenue opposite the CMC?s office of ward 87 last year. The quiet of the area was shattered.

 Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, in whose tenure the pools were built, is still councillor from the ward. ?It is their (the Left Front board?s) property now, and I don?t care whether they demolish it or maintain it,? was how Mukherjee reacted to the CMC move on Wednesday.

 The demand for demolition of the pools is perhaps the only issue in the CMC where the Left Front has found full support from the Trinamul Congress opposition.

 ?I was member (roads) in Mukherjee?s council but no clearance was sought from the roads department before erecting the permanent structures,? said Anup Chatterjee.

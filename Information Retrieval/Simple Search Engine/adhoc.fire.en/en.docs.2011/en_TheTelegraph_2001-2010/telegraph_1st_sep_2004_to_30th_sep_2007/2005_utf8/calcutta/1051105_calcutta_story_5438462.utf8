 Clash fear in Lake ouster

 OUR BUREAU

 The possibility of a major clash between squatters and police looms large as the state and the railways gear up to start eviction along the tracks at Rabindra Sarobar from next week.

 Earlier, Calcutta High Court had directed that the eviction must start by November 10 and end by the 30th.

 The administration?s two previous eviction drives had flopped in the face of stiff opposition from the settlers between Ballygunge and Tollygunge railway stations.

 On March 2, despite the presence of a huge police force, the drive had to be called off after massive agitation at the site. The state administration decided not to go ahead with the eviction ?forcefully?, apprehending bloodshed and law-and-order problems.

 ?This time, however, the squatters will have a tough time, as the high court has issued strict instructions that the apex court?s ouster order be carried out. It doesn?t want to entertain the excuse that eviction may lead to violence,? Eastern Railway?s (ER) counsel Uttam Majumdar said on Friday.

 On the other hand, the squatters are also firm on their stand that they will not leave their ?homes? unless they are assured of alternative accommodation.

 Local MLA of the Trinamul Congress Sougata Roy said: ?Seven days have passed since the ER had set up a camp office in the Gobindapur area. The squatters were invited to collect coupons which would later help them claim land for accommodation. But not a single person has collected the coupon. We will stop the eviction even if we have to shed blood.?

 On November 8, Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjee will hold a rally in the area in support of the squatters. The next day, the settlers will organise a march to Writers? Buildings demanding rehabilitation before execution of the high court order. From November 10, sit-ins on the railway tracks between Dhakuria and Tollygunge are on the cards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Full-up kitty on wannabe frenzy

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 It?s raining jingles and laurels, and everyone?s invited.

 Talent-hunt reality shows have generated mass hysteria and hits like never before. From the fixed-phone line jam for Kaun Banega Crorepati to the phenomenal SMS traffic for Indian Idol to Friday?s Bypass-blocker Fame Gurukul, all messages now lead to ?live? TV madness.

 Says television analyst Anil Wanvari, founder-CEO of Indiantelevision.com: ?Indian television is definitely ready for reality and that?s why so many shows have been so successful. But audiences across the country may not be ready to deal with reality.?

 Sony?s Indian Idol, ?the most successful reality show in the history of Indian television?, not only had aspirants queuing up across the country for auditions but received record votes during the on-air episodes. A few hours of voting would ensure 30 to 40 lakh SMSs while the week-long voting for the final winner registered more than 5 crore SMSs.

 Channel [V]?s Super Singer couldn?t match the Indian Idol TRPs, but also drew thousands of wannabe singers trying to catch Adnan Sami?s ears. ?We invented the game of reality shows in this country with Popstars,? claims Channel [V]?s head honcho Amar K. Deb.

 And they?re here to stay, as ?human emotions are interwoven with shows like these?.

 Wanvari, for one, expects Fame Gurukul (adapted from Spanish TV rage Operacion Triunfo) to tread the success path of Indian Idol. 

 ?Since the show is all about musical makeovers, everyone who believes he or she is a singer would like to be groomed by the best in the business. Now, the channel perhaps needs to be better equipped for crowd control.?

 With hysteria clearly the name of the ratings-and-revenues game, there?s no slowing down on talent hunts and game shows.

 Up next will be STAR?s big-ticket return of Kaun Banega Crorepati with a booty of Rs 2 crore for anyone who gets all 15 questions right. And like Indian Idol, KBC II, which goes on air on August 5, will go wireless with dedicated numbers to message and participate.

 With thousands pouring out to participate and organisers playing the dubious role of whipping up the excitement and then struggling to stem the hysterical tide, the Fame Gurukuls could be the future of Indian TV for a while.

 POLLUTION PROD: The Dhakuria Lakes. A Telegraph picture

 The Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) has stopped renewing the licences of the clubs bordering the Dhakuria Lakes for failing to comply with government orders.

 A three-member committee, comprising an official each from the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the CIT, has been constituted for on-the-spot verification of the activities of the clubs. 

 Utilisation of lands and action taken by the clubs to protect the waterbody and the greenery surrounding it will be put under the scanner.

 ?We have stopped renewing the licences of the clubs as they did not comply with our order. The authorities were asked to furnish details of their waste disposal, sewerage and drainage systems, and the action taken to protect the pollution of the waterbody and the trees. The information was not made available to us,? stated A.K. Ganai, officer-on-special duty of the CIT.

 The clubs also did not deposit the annual fees, despite repeated reminders, he alleged. 

 The CIT will set them a final deadline to clear the dues and submit the performance reports.

 ?We are spending a lot of money to keep the Lakes clean and green. The clubs, on the other hand, are only interested in making money. We have made it clear to the authorities that they will have to shut shop if they don?t follow the directives,? Ganai added.

 According to the CIT officials, 20 clubs dot the Lakes. 

 They operate bars and restaurants and organise sports and cultural events throughout the year. The premises are also rented out for marriage ceremonies and corporate parties.

 The rules require the clubs to develop infrastructure for solid waste management and construct drainage and sewerage lines to ensure that the Lakes remain pollution-free.

 ?We don?t want to interfere with the activities of the clubs or prevent them from earning money. But we must ensure that they following the pollution rules,?? the officer-on-special duty explained.

 The three-member committee will inspect the waste disposal infrastructure of the clubs and speak with the officials. It will submit a report to the CIT within a month.

 ?We will serve closure notices if the club authorities do not submit reports and pay the dues. Besides, action will be taken if the committee detects any breach of rules,? asserted the CIT officials.

 The high court is reportedly pressuring the CIT for an action taken report for the protection of the waterbody.

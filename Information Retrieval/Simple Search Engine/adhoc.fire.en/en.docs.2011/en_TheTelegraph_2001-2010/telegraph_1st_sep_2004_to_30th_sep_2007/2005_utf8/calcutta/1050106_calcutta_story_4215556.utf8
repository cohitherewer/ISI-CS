Bandhni ? the name says it all. Indeed, this spacious 

address at AC 26 Salt Lake specialises in the famous handwork of Gujarat.

From a casual salwar-kurta set to an elaborate 

bridal sari, there is a touch of bandhni in all outfits here.

The fabric ranges from simple cotton to sexy chiffon 

and everything in between. Taking a step away from the conventional, the four-year-old 

style stop has emerged with a new-look autumn collection steering clear of the 

bandhni look.

?Bandhni is our strength, but then we decided 

to tread other areas and give our clients something new,? said Siddharth Daga, 

designer of the line. 

This new collection that has already become a huge 

hit during this wedding season mixes the popular ?bright colour on georgette? 

with some really unconventional and smart designs.

?Since the electric blues and fuschia pinks are in, 

we really could not ignore these colours while creating the saris and lehngas. 

But at the same time, we did want to be different,? explains Siddharth.

Titled Ada, the focus of this collection is the use 

of semi-precious stones that give a rich, almost royal look to the garments. A 

high-point is the Nizam line inspired by the crown of the Nizam of Hyderabad. 

?The look of the crown has been duplicated using aqua-blue stones on the pallu, 

sleeves of the choli and a kamarbandh,? says Daga. The boutique 

also designs costume jewellery to go with the outfits.

Pearl jam

Just in time to dress up the city?s party people to 

usher in the New Year came Gauri Bajoria?s latest line of party clothes. Basically 

in monochromes, the focus of her collection this time is the use of Mother of 

Pearl embellishments in the form of buttons or pieces of the shiny sea-shells 

stitched on the fabric.

?I?ve dyed the Mother of Pearl in various colours 

to give it a dramatic effect that helps to jazz up the outfits,? says Gauri, who 

after her stints in various top-line boutiques including Kimaya and Ogaan is now 

selling out of her own stuido in Alipore.

The stress is on the kurta with big collars 

and handcuffs. ?The look of the outfits is very retro,? explains Gauri. Keeping 

kurtas company are jackets with simple monochrome designs and some texturing.

Jewel jazz

Ten-year-old Jewel Co, housed inside Hotel Hindusthan 

International (HHI), has now reinvented itself with a whole new look. The remodelled 

store and a new line of colourful jewellery were launched on the first day of 

2005. 

?We have a very loyal clientele and we wanted to give 

them an all-new experience in shopping,? said store owner Pratap Lodha, a graduate 

from the Gemmological Institute of New York.

The jewellery is as exclusive as the setting, dominated 

by sleek leather furniture and rimless glass showcases. ?We use a lot of precious 

and semi-precious stones like rubies, emeralds, sapphire and multi-sapphire with 

the diamonds to give the pieces a young and happy look,? explained son Nikunj 

Lodha.

Most of the pendants are large with designs varying 

from well-carved leaves and a bunch of red grapes to some uneven circles studded 

with precious stones and diamonds.

?Our jewellery can be worn with western as well as 

ethnic outfits and for any occasion. It?s the synergy of the east and west in 

one piece that makes them so special,? claimed Pratap.

Trendy picks

For all those on the trail of trendy clothes within 

a budget, Fashion Folks at 10 Wood Street is a good place to go. With a variety 

of items gathered from India and abroad, it?s a one-stop-shop for winter and partywear.

Some sleeveless T-shirts in pinks and whites with 

a sequin-embossed effect and formal, yet chic, tops can be picked up for anything 

between Rs 200 and Rs 500.

Distressed, stretch jeans in blues and whites are 

also affordably priced at Rs 850, while some pin-striped black trousers bear a 

price tag of just Rs 400.

With the motto being stylish clothes with a cheaper 

tag, sweaters, pullovers, jackets and polo-necks don?t even cross the Rs 1,000-mark.

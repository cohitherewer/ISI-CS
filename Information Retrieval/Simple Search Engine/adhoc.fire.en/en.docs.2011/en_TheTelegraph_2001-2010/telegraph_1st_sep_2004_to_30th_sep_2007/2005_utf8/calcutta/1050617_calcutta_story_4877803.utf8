The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hi-tech trams top govt list

 - Buddha meets Japan bank officials to discuss projects

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday said the Elevated Mass Rapid Transit System (EMRTS) is the foremost priority of his government. 

 Bhattacharjee made the announcement after a meeting with officials of the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) at Writers? Buildings on Thursday. 

 ?JBIC officials have come here many times and they want to know which projects are our priority. For us, the priority is the EMRTS,? the chief minister asserted.

 The government has focused on EMRTS after it had to scrap the Rs 5,500-crore East-West Metro project due to lack of funds.

 Chief secretary Ashok Gupta had made it clear that the government was not in a position to partially underwrite the project. 

 The state, however, is willing to share the Rs 2,400-crore bill for the EMRTS project, which is expected to increase the vehicular speed in the city without any damage to the road surface. 

 The government had engaged Consulting Engineering Services to prepare a pre-feasibility report on the project. The feasibility study for the project is being carried out by the Japan Economic Trade Organisation.

 Bhattacharjee?s government has been lobbying in Delhi for the past few months, seeking financial assistance for the EMRTS project, which is one of a number of transport infrastructure projects being taken up in the state. 

 Last week, the Centre made it clear that the state has to choose among the EMRTS, East-West Metro, North-South corridor, Eastern Expressway, Kalyani-Kakdwip green corridor and the Cossipore-Jadavpur elevated road.

 Following discussions, the EMRTS was preferred over the East-West Metro.

 Under the EMRTS, high-speed trams will ply on elevated tracks along three routes, all of them terminating at Esplanade.

 The trams will have three coaches each and will run at 60 kph. The signalling system will be automatic. 

 According to officials, foreign funds for the EMRTS project will come from Japan under Special Terms for Economic Partnership. 

 On Thursday, chief minister Bhattacharjee announced the vehicles would ply along 35 km of tracks. 

 He added that the second-most important project for his government was the Kukrahati bridge.

If crystals, primarily Swarovskis, have always been 

a part of high fashion, this season has seen couturiers using it in liberal doses 

to embellish ensembles. So while everyone around is seen flaunting them on saris 

and lehngas, you can make a statement by sporting crystals on your eyes 

and cheeks. Ace make-up artiste Prabir De shows just how, as model Sharan Mishra 

sits pretty through a makeover session with crystals.

Bare basics

While going for a crystal makeover, keep the basic 

make-up simple so that the sparkle of stones is not offset by loud colours. De 

has used foundation base matching with Sharan?s skin tone, eye-liner, eye-shadow 

and some subtle blush-on. 

Eye enhancer

In the eye zone, crystals are most commonly used on 

the upper lid to line the eyes. Single crystals on the outer corner of the eyes 

also look good. The application is quite simple and can be done at home with the 

help of make-up glue and a pair of tweezers.

De has used deep blue crystals for Sharan and co-ordinated 

the rest of her make-up with it. He has applied a blend of mauve and pink eye-shadow. 

A thin line of eye-liner stretching outwards for the 60s look has been applied 

and the crystals have been arranged along this line. 

Lip lustre

The pout can be made to look prettier with a dash 

of crystals. You can arrange the gems in any pattern you fancy. De has used three 

pink crystals shaped in a triangle for a subtle sparkle. 

Face facts

While the most common zone for applying crystals are 

the eyes, you can also use it to highlight the chin or the cheeks. A single stone 

placed as a nose stud looks elegant too. You can also replace a conventional bindi 

with an elaborate pattern created with crystals.

Tattoo talk

Move over body painting and tattoos. Armed with some 

crystals in various colours, make-up glue and a dash of imagination, you can create 

just about any pattern to embellish your neck, arms, navel or any other body part.

So, get going while the going is good.

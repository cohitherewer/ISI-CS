 If you thought management education was all about finance, marketing and HR, its time to do a rethink. With fashion education becoming as mainstream as it can be, thanks to the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), fashion management is the new career option on the block.

 A two-year Post-graduate Programme in Fashion Management was launched at NIFT Calcutta on Tuesday. The programme aims to impart training in fashion-specific management, marketing and merchandising. The programme is like any other management course with specialisation in fashion. It also includes certain basic things that are taught in a regular MBA course like principles of marketing, consumer behaviour and organisational behaviour, revealed D.K. Batra, chairperson of Fashion Management Studies (FMS), Delhi.

 Director general of NIFT Gouri Kumar was present at the inauguration, which was also attended by D. Mukherjee, director of the state handloom and textiles department, and apparel industry personnel.

 The course was launched in NIFT Delhi in 1997 and subsequently in the Hyderabad and Bangalore centres. Besides Calcutta, it is being launched in Mumbai this year.

 The programme focuses on convergence of domestic and export marketing strategies, change and innovation management, IT-integrated marketing moves, merchandising and management from fibre to apparels, fashion e-business and retail technologies.

 The fashion industry is now changing at a fast pace. To be in tune with the global fashion industry, one needs trained professionals in every aspect. This course aims to do just that; it bridges the gap between designers and entrepreneurs, said Kumar.

 The first year of the course includes subjects like concepts, principles and techniques of marketing and merchandising. Students will also be given industry exposure through an eight-week internship with a garment house.

 In the second year, students are required to choose their area of specialisation ? intellectual property rights, retail management, visual merchandising, global sourcing, export merchandising, supply chain management and so on. While the stress in the second year is on application-based education, in the final semester students get to do industry-sponsored diploma projects.

 We get companies like Madura Garment, Arvind Mills, Levis, Wal-Mart and Tommy Hilfiger to sponsor the projects. These are also the companies which provide employment to fashion managers, added Batra.

 The course was launched in the city with a fair amount of industry feedback, said director NIFT Calcutta, Shantmanu. Calcutta now has a considerable number of designers and the industry needs managers. The course trains human resource for the new vocations that the industry demands, he said.

 Indian Institute of Management Calcutta has assured full support for the course, with two professors on the guest faculty list. We will also have guest faculty from the management department of Calcutta University, added Shantmanu.

 The course will benefit both the weavers of West Bengal as well as the fashion houses, feel industry insiders. NIFT students have already provided the artisans and weavers of Bengal with a lot of professional guidance. This course will further benefit the readymade garment industry, and the handloom and powerloom weavers to a great extent, said Mukherjee.

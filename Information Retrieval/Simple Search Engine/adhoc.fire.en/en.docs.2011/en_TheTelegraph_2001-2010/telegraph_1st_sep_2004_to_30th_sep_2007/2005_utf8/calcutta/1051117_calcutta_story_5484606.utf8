 Revamp drive for canal road twin

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 With work on Canal East Road almost complete, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) has taken up a project to improve Canal South Road.

 The HRBC itself will provide funds for the Rs 3.5-crore project, which includes removal of encroachments, widening of the road, installation of sodium vapour lights, construction of concrete pavements and beautification of the canal bank.

 Canal South Road extends from Gaznavi Bridge, near RG Kar Hospital, where the Circular canal ends, to Ultadanga, where the New Cut canal terminates and the Keshtopur canal originates.

 ?We have taken up the project to help commuters reach Ultadanga without using the congested Maniktala Main Road or CIT Road. The vehicular pressure on these two roads will be reduced once Canal South Road is renovated,? said HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee. 

 ?We have already started the preliminary work and want to begin in earnest as soon as possible,? he added.

 In the next phase, Banerjee stated, a pass will be constructed under the rail bridge near Ultadanga station to connect the stretch with VIP Road. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has already prepared the design and plan.

 ?Once the underpass is ready, people from Beleghata, Sealdah, Maniktala and Shyambazar will be able to take Canal South Road to reach VIP Road,?? Banerjee said.

 Widening of Canal East Road, along the Circular canal, was carried out by the HRBC, with financial assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. 

 The five-km road starts from Chawlpatty, near Beleghata, and terminates at Gaznavi bridge.

 The road had been all but abandoned. It has been renovated to ease the pressure on APC Roy Road.

 According to officials, the transport department and urban development department have taken up a plan to make the roads on both sides of the Circular, Bagjola and Keshtopur canals motorable. 

 The HRBC and CMDA will implement the projects.

 The traffic count on Beleghata Main Road has decreased following the widening of the Chawlpatty Road, along the Eastern Drainage Channel, by the CMDA. 

 The revamped road, which originates at Chingrihata, on EM Bypass, has facilitated the commuters from Salt Lake to Sealdah station. Construction of a road along the Bagjola canal is on the cards.

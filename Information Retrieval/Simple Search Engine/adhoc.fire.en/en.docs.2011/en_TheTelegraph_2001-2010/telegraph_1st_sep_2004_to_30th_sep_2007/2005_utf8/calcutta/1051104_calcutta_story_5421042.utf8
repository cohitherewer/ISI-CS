 Aqua appeal to enhance cash inflow 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, water is akin to wealth. The cash inflow can be enhanced by placing water elements like aquariums or waterfalls. Introducing fresh plants in the aquarium further increases the chi energy. Instead of using plastic decorations, one can also add some green and blue pebbles to liven things up

Q: My husbands business dealings involve hi-tech professional sound and lighting equipment that he hires out to clients for events. Though he gets regular business, for the past two years his clients are not making timely payments. His total dues in the market now amount to around Rs 28 lakh. The dates they promise for payment are never kept and the dues keep adding up. Kindly give me a remedy, so that these people pay up at once.

 THE SOLUTION: Water is akin to wealth in Feng Shui and is highly beneficial when used in the house. Enhance the cash inflow that is stuck with the clients by placing an aquarium with fish in the south-east of your living room. 

 Instead of using plastic decorations, use green or blue coloured pebbles and shells. Fresh plants in the aquarium will add their own chi energy that will help grow your wealth. If this is not possible, place a green or blue bowl filled with water. Refill the water in it each day with water from a tap in the east of the home before any other water is taken from the tap. 

 Colour code 

 Q: I want to paint my house in the right colours. Can you please tell me which part of our house should have which type of colours? We have a large drawing room and two bedrooms with attached bathrooms. We also have a spacious kitchen that is separated from the dining area by a wooden arch. There is also a study area that used to be the verandah earlier.

 THE SOLUTION: Each of the eight directions and its distinctive chi energy is associated with a specific colour. These colours effectively preserve the chi energy when used for painting the walls or in furnishings and d?cor. 

 Emerald green represents the growing tree energy of the south-east and east. It helps to induce stimulating freshness and warmth in the environment. Shades of red, maroon, peach, pink and violet are very close to the fire energy of the south and south-west. These increase sociability and bring passion to a room.

 Soft grey, white, and metallic shades of copper, silver and bronze are closest to the metal energy of the west and northwest that help enhance feelings of dignity and authority. This goes a long way in creating a richer atmosphere.

 Deep blue or cool shades of soft pastel blue are linked with the soothing energy of the north. They help create a relaxing and a comforting atmosphere.

 Quiet shades of beige, cream and off-white are closest to the soil energy of the tranquil north-east zone.

 These help to enhance the feelings of mental stability and increase absorption and the power of concentration.

 Decor dos

 Q: I have a spare room in the north-west of the house. I would like to convert it into an informal living room where we can entertain our friends during the weekends. Please guide me as to the kind of d?cor most suitable here.

 Namrata Seth

 THE SOLUTION: A room in the north-west is ideal for entertaining friends as it is strongly connected with networking and friends.

 Decorate this room with its ruling and nourishing elements, which are metal and earth.

 Metal energy is linked with objects that are round, silver, gold, copper or pure white in colour. So introduce round metal pictures or mirror frames, vases, bowls, chestnuts, wind chimes, silvery balls and sculptures.

 Further, boost the chi of this room with paintings or pictures that depict people dining and dancing in metal rich frames. Other ways of nourishing this place with earth energy is introducing clay sculptures, crystal artefacts, yellow or brown or square plates, frames, yellow sunflowers, checked fabrics and fresh green plants growing in plenty. 

 Work worries

 Q: My husband is moving into a new office. I would like you to guide him with the location of the chamber and the placement of his table and computer. 

 Arti

 THE SOLUTION: Your husband should choose the south-west area for his chamber and also place his table in its south-west corner. The computer should ideally be placed in the north-east of the table along with objects like reading material that is connected with financial forecasts.

 This will encourage him to work harder. He should also keep his organiser in the north-west of the table in order to be more organised.

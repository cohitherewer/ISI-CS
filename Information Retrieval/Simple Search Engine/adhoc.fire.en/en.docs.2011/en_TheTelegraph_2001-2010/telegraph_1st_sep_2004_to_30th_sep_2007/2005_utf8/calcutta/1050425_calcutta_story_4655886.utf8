The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Local killer, foreign face

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The software that was imported by the city police two years ago to produce images of criminals on the run is lying unused in Lalbazar.

 Reason: the detectives found it ineffectual, since the portraits generated by it have Western features rather than Indian ones.

 Sleuths found the software useless during the course of the probe into the Banka twin-murder case at Camac Street.

 In the attempt to obtain an image of the domestic help accused of the murders, the likeness produced was that of a European. 

 ?The software was written by European experts. Thousands of samples of European eyes, noses, ears, hairstyles and faces were fed into it. How can it help us produce a clear image of an Indian criminal?? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police, detective department (I). 

 ?We need a software based on Asian features and there is no such program available,? he lamented.

 Singh is overseeing investigations into the twin murders that occurred in the Shakespeare Sarani police station area.

 The group of 20 detectives engaged to track down the killer of Tara Chand Banka and wife Sarda have no idea what the assassin looks like.

 ?When the software failed to help us, we engaged an artist to draw an image of the domestic help. A portrait was drawn going by the descriptions given by the residents, liftman and the gateman of the apartment,? said an officer of the detective department?s homicide wing

 ?Surprisingly, those who provided the descriptions could not recognise the sketch. They said it bore no resemblance to the accused domestic help. Now, even if the suspect stands right in front of us, we will not be able to recognise him,? he added.

 In 2002, the city police had sought the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the US law-enforcing agency, to create a portrait of an absconding criminal.

 The detective department had written to the FBI asking for a book ? FBI Facial Catalogue ? where information is provided on how to create an image of a fugitive criminal based on descriptions of people who have seen him.

 The book also provided tips on using facial identification software. 

 The idea of using such a software was adopted after a sketch of Sadaquat, one of the three terrorists accused in the American Center shooting case in 2002, failed to convince officers who were present during the incident.

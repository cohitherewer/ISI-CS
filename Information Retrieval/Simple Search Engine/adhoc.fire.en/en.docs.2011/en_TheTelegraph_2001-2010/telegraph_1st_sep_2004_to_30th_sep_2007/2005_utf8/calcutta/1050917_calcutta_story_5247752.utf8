 Hawker ouster ratified

 - For Calcutta?s sake, high court tosses out plea against eviction 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the administration to evict several thousand hawkers from eight arteries in the central business district. 

 This, the court held, would help disperse crowds, apart from checking road accidents and air pollution.

 ?The streets of Calcutta are choked with vehicles, which results in massive air pollution and a rising number of fatal accidents that have become the bane of life in the city,? said a division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly.

 While dismissing a petition from a hawkers? lobby, the judges spelt out the city?s priorities and said they would not entertain any plea for a stay on the drive against hawkers for the sake of the city as a whole. 

 ?We do not think it proper to entertain the hawkers? petition by asking the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and police to refrain from evicting hawkers and encroachers from the eight major roads,? the judges said.

 The bench also observed: ?We do acknowledge the provisions of the National Urban Renewal Policy (NURP) that says removal of hawkers/vendors from the streets should be avoided whenever it is feasible. But let us also not lose sight of the fact that removal of hawkers and unauthorised structures from footpaths would have to be addressed if its serves the interest of Calcutta as a whole.?

 After Friday?s directive, police and the civic authorities have no obstacle to clearing the footpaths of eight major roads ? Strand Road, Brabourne Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, Rabindra Sarani, Netaji Subhas Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kalakar Street and AJC Bose Road.

 Earlier, on May 29, the court, on the basis of a report submitted by a five-member team, headed by former deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Sharma, had directed police and the CMC to conduct a joint drive to clear the pavements of these eight roads.

 Soon after police and the CMC started the eviction drive, a petition was moved by Shaktiman Ghosh, general secretary of the Calcutta Hawkers? Sangram Samity, seeking a modification of the court?s eviction order.

 The petitioner organisation contended that eviction of hawkers from the streets was against the NURP, that has provided a right to hawkers to carry out their businesses on footpaths. ?So, the court should reconsider the order,? the petition had prayed.

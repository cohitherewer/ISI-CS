 Bridal basics

 Getting together all 

 you need to throw that perfect pre-altar party is simple. 

 Ipsita Deb shows you how

 Plan a Party

 DO

 Find a theme thats both 

 personalised and fun 

 Stock up on the cocktail front and keep the grub 

 to a minimum munch

 DON'T

 Get one particular type of 

 music, especially slow numbers

 Splurge on flowers and balloons since theyre 

 so cliched

 Your best friend?s wedding is 

 next week and it?s hard enough having to deal with being 

 the only remaining single member within the group. But now 

 you?ve also been burdened with the responsibility of throwing 

 that one last party before you bid her luck in marital bliss. 

 So many thoughts, plans, ideas 

 and musts, but where on earth do you start and what?s the 

 basic (and often crazy) kit for the perfect bridal shower? 

 Theme team

 Starting off with the usual flowers, 

 balloons and streamers routine is fine if it?s a birthday 

 party, but for a bridal shower ? a once-in-a-lifetime experience 

 ? put on your creative cap.

 Finding a theme is the first step: 

 something personal, yet fun. Taking off from the bride?s 

 taste in music, films or even men makes for a great theme.

 For a Beatles lover, the place 

 can be done up in 60s style, while a Full Monty addict 

 can have her very own no-holds barred show in the confines 

 of the venue. 

 Decor date

 If your best friend loves flowers 

 and all things girlie, use as many of her favourite flowers 

 as the place can hold. Colour co-ordinate types with the 

 decor at hand, but make sure not to overdo it and make it 

 look cliched. 

 Using suggestive items can spruce 

 things up a bit as well. Keep the decor in perfect sync 

 with the theme and keep adding from there. Giant-sized photographs, 

 posters, coasters, mugs... anything goes. Just make sure 

 the props create the necessary ambience. For a Tom Cruise 

 fan, get all the memorabilia possible ? download wallpapers 

 from the Net, recreate his most popular films in different 

 rooms, make everyone wear Raybans and leather jackets, sport 

 some cocktail tricks and cruise along.

 Man made

 While a bridal shower is ideally 

 an all-girls show, tall, dark and handsome strangers of 

 the opposite sex are always welcome.

 What they intend to do in the 

 party, however, is something that can only be left to the 

 imagination. 

 But if going the Full Monty 

 isn?t your style, hire some Flair bartenders to whip 

 up their antics and some exotic spirits. 

 Rhythm right

 Music can rock or kill a party 

 if it doesn?t gel with the crowd. Make sure to keep all 

 kinds of fast tracks on hand ? English chart-toppers as 

 well as popular Bollywood numbers. 

 Even if the decor has surpassed 

 your expectations, lack of variety in music can be a surefire 

 way to slow down a happening do.

 While burning several CDs and 

 compiling the perfect mix is a good idea, hiring one of 

 the city?s many DJs or simply a wannabe is even better. 

 That way, you can escape the blame 

 for not changing the music every now and then. And you can 

 have some fun on the run. 

 Liquid grub

 Good food and wine is ideal for 

 a dinner date, but a bridal shower should be low on solids 

 and high on liquids. 

 Colourful cocktails and the basic 

 white spirits is sure to pull you through, but to ensure 

 the party gets going well past midnight, keep in hand some 

 fiery shooters and shots. 

 After all, there?s nothing like 

 being all muddled about seeing your friend through to the 

 altar. 

 On the food front, tortilla chips 

 and dips, momos and kebabs should hold you in good stead, 

 and see you through heart and head ache.

?Music binds B B together?

 Shankar Ehsaan Loy are the men behind the ldquo;cool desi musical rdquo; Bunty Aur Babli. Shankar Mahadevan speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about adding an urban touch to the rural soundtrack, about Mira Nair rsquo;s offer and Marigold rsquo;s music

 Aur Babli

 What was your briefing for Bunty Aur Babli?

 When we first met Adi (producer Aditya Chopra) and Shaad (director Shaad Ali) they wanted the whole colour of the music to be tangentially different to anything we had done before Bunty Aur Babli. And the briefing was to create our own folk music. They said: ?Go mad and do whatever you want.? The rural flavour was important since all the characters come from small towns. But we have done that in a very subtle way.

 How important is the music to a road film like this?

 Music binds a film together. Bunty Aur Babli is a real fun, happy film with no tension as such in the screenplay. Shaad and Adi finished the script before we started working on the music. Despite being set in small towns and villages, the film has been shot and edited in a very slick way. Our music had to balance the theme and the images. Had it been only rural, the young crowds wouldn?t be interested to watch the film.

 The rap song picturised on Amitabh Bachchan is quite a rage?

 We had the English song narrating the story of Bunty and Babli to connect with the youth. BlaaZe has sung it. Amitji was so thrilled when he heard it that he told us: ?I am petrified. I don?t know how I am going do it but the song is rocking.? Abhishek messaged me saying that he plays the song full blast on his car stereo.

 Why did you get Alisha Chinai to sing a mujra? 

 It?s a very desi mujra with Aishwarya Rai playing the item girl. Any regular voice like Alka Yagnik could have sung the song easily. But we wanted to feature a voice which is least likely to sing such a track. Even Alisha had a heart attack when she heard the song. How in the world will I sing it, she asked. But that was the whole idea. When you hear the song, you can easily make out the strain and the discomfort with which she sings it.

 How?s Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna coming along? 

 We have travelled with Karan Johar for eight or nine days. It?s a romantic film and the tunes are coming along well.

 What else are you working on?

 Mira Nair?s asked us to do the Broadway version of Monsoon Wedding. She?s planning a grand stage musical and although there are many who want to do the music, she wants us to do it. We have had some sittings.

You have also done Willard Caroll?s Marigold?

 Yes, they have finished shooting the songs. There are some songs in Hindi, some in English. Ali Larter, the Hollywood actress opposite Salman Khan in the film, has sung the English songs herself. David Newman is scoring the background music, using our songs as the theme.

 Are you doing Farhan Akhtar?s Don?

 We are slated to do that as well but that?s much later in the year. He still hasn?t finalised the script although it is a complete remake of the Amitabh Bachchan film. We have also committed to Manish Malhotra?s directorial debut.

 And what about Shankar Ehsaan Loy?s private album?

 We have been planning that for the last two years. We were so busy that we haven?t been able to make time for that. We are also looking forward to our spring world tour next year. Then on a personal level, I am working on an album with music great John McLaughlin.

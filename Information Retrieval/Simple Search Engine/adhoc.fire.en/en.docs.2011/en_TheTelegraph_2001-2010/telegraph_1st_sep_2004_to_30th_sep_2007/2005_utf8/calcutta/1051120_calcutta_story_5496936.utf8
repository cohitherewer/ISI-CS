 It was a bedazzling affair at the Hyatt Regency ballroom on Friday evening, as diamond label Orra showcased its latest line of jewellery for the forthcoming wedding season. Organised in association with Sananda, the show titled Abhushan provided glimpses of some exquisite works in diamond, interspersed with precious stones.

 The highlights of the line were neckpieces of every form and size, as was evident in the name of the range ? Neckline Collectibles. The high-drama show revolved round the wedding theme, each sequence portraying one particular function preceding D-day.

 It started off with the introductory round that paired the jewellery with designer Sunipa Samadders rich corsets and flowing skirts. The first wedding sequence started off with the Mangni collection that had models Indrani Dasgupta and Neeraj Surana exchanging diamond engagement rings. Gorgeous saris, lehngas and salwar kameezes by Agnimitra Paul complemented the ornaments.

 The next sequence ? showcasing the Mehndi collection ? found the models parading lime green drapes from Roop Shringar Saris. Diamonds combined with pearls made up the sleek neckpieces and dangling earrings. The sequence ended with the heart-warming beats of Mehndi hai rachne wali from Zubeida.

 The Sangeet collection was up next, with contemporary jewellery designs accessorising Sunipas chic corsets paired with skirts and saris. It ended with the models enacting a traditional sangeet ceremony ? peals of laughter and beats of dholkis.

 The show culminated with the Wedding range ? elaborate pieces with diamonds, rubies and emeralds adorning the necks, ears, foreheads and wrists. Heavy bridal saris from Roop Shringar in vibrant hues completed the look.

 The sequence ended on a dramatic note with Indrani being carried on to the ramp in a palki, where she exchanged garlands with Neeraj. The track of Kawa kawa from Monsoon Wedding accompanied the action and further enhanced the wedding feel.

 The show was punctuated by singer Babul Supriyo belting out hit numbers like Khoya khoya chaand, Tere liye, Hum tum, Sochta hoon uska dil... enough to get the otherwise dour crowd to clap along. 

 Giving Indrani and Neeraj company on the ramp were actresses June, Locket and Rim Jhim and models Sanchita, Tanusree, Devdutta and Pooja, among others. The show was choreographed by The Dream Merchants.

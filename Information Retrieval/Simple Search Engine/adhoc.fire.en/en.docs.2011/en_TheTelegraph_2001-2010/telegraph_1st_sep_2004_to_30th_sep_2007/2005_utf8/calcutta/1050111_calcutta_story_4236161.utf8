KIRAN UTTAM GHOSH tells Goodlife 

about the yacht party that launched the Kingfisher swimsuit calendar, which includes 

one of her creations.

 It?s a calendar I had to keep my date with. On Sunday, I was in Mumbai to celebrate the launch of Kingfisher?s swimsuit special calendar for 2005, over brunch, aboard Vijay Mallya?s yacht, Indian Princess.

 It was a first for me in some ways since I had done a set of swimwear ensembles that were chosen for the calendar that was shot in South Africa.

 Other designers associated with the calendar in the past have been Rohit Bal, Tarun Tahiliani and Rajesh Pratap Singh.

 When the offer came, I had my reservations since I?m not a water baby. Working with lycra isn?t quite up my street and I?m not the kind of person who works with minimal bits of fabric. Breathable natural fabrics have been more ?me? and I hadn?t done swimwear before. But having said that, it was interesting to work with unusual materials. I used aquas and blues with a texture of varied uncut stones and interesting beadwork.

 For the launch, everything, right from the special passes that were required for entry into the port area where the yacht was anchored, could have been straight out of a Bollywood blockbuster set. The permits allowed in a very select list of fashionable people.

 As we stepped on to the yacht, the first impression I had was of the larger-than-life Vijay Mallya, holding court. The first thing that hit me about him was his bling-bling watch, all diamond dazzle and colour, ably supported by rocks on either ear and gold encrusted shades.

 We literally sweated it out while Mallya played perfect and magnanimous host. The glam quotient was high and the sultry women matched the weather. They even beat it since they looked really sexy despite the sweat factor! 

 The food was at its creative best. A.D. Singh of Olive fame, besides keeping us entertained, vouched for that. Oysters and lobsters, goat cheese canapes, strawberry martinis and champagne? It was a great brunch.

 And if I found myself missing my Sunday afternoon siesta, I can?t blame the chef nor the fact that guests like Devika Bhojwani, Ashish Soni, Jackie Shroff and Suneet Varma looked more involved with their cell phones.

 I couldn?t help but think, while posing for a shot with Salman Khan on my left, Mallya on my right, Yana Gupta, Ujjwala Raut, Pia Trivedi, Fardeen Khan and Shilpa Shetty somewhere in the frame, that it doesn?t get better than this, and yet lounging at Tolly with GG (husband Gaurav Ghosh) on Sunday afternoon is tough to beat.

 The afternoon looked straight out of a fashion set from a Hindi movie, from Mallya?s two gun-toting watchdogs to the Ballard Pier Extension and the glamorous, long-legged models draped all over the yacht at strategic places. This was a perfect set for a fashion show, though the security would be a nightmare for so many guests. The calendars are to follow, and the wish list for them is growing.

 impses of the calendar that was unveiled were pretty ?minimal?. If Sunday?s launch was a style check, the calendar promises to make a splash.

 It was fun while it lasted, but it was more fun getting back on the flight home to Calcutta!

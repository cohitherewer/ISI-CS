 Bludgeon death for elderly couple

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man and his wife were found murdered in their ground-floor flat at Narayantala (East), in Baguiati, on the northern fringes of the city, early on Monday.

 Superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar said the two were apparently hit by a blunt object on the head and shoulders.

 No one has been arrested, though police interrogated the couple?s only son and two sons-in-law till late hours. The son?s fingerprints have been sent for forensic tests.

 The sleuths are looking for the couple?s maidservant, Lakshmi Das, a resident of Gouranga Nagar. 

 Senior officers, including deputy inspector-general (Presidency range) Harmanprit Singh visited the flat. A thorough search revealed that the murderers had taken away nothing except Rs 35,000, kept in box in a corner of the couple?s bedroom.

 Narayan Biswas, 59, and wife Nita, 47, lived in the rented flat, in Narayantala?s DE block, with their son Sumanta, a painter. Their two daughters live with their families nearby.

 Flat-owner Gour Kirtania, who lives upstairs, said: ?Narayanbabu had moved in with his family barely 14 months ago. He had told me he had a business in agro products in Behrampore. He paid the rent regularly and was an amiable person, though he kept mostly to himself.?

 Sumanta told police that he was sleeping in a room adjacent to his parents?. He woke up around 4 am and found that the door that led to his parents? room, usually kept open at night as the two were ill, was locked from outside. 

 ?I became suspicious seeing the door closed. I went out through a door in the toilet, which could be accessed directly from my room, and called our landlord,? Sumanta said.

 Kirtania then came down and opened the door of the Biswas?s room, and found the couple lying in a pool of blood. 

 Police suspect the killers had entered and left the two-storeyed building through the roof. ?The attic does not have a door and it is quite easy for anyone familiar with the house to enter without any hindrance,? said an investigating officer.

 ?We are yet to ascertain the motive for the murders, as the criminals had not touched the ornaments or any other valuable item in an almirah in the room. We are interrogating Sumanta and the two sons-in-law,? the official added.

 The sleuths have come to know that the money the killers had taken away was kept for Sumanta, who was scheduled to leave for Gangtok in a couple of days on a business trip. 

 Superintendent of police Kumar said nothing could be said for sure. ?We are waiting for the post-mortem and the forensic reports. We are interrogating everyone and are looking for the maid, who could not be traced.?

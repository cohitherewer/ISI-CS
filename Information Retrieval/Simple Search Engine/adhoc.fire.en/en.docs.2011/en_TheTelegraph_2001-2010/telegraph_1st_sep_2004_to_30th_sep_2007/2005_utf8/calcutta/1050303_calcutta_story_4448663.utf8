The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Born in a bowl of noodles

It?s supposed to be a nostalgic journey in search 

of a woman who once made the most delicious noodles in Calcutta?s Chinatown. But 

what Rafeeq Ellias?s documentary The Legend of Fat Mama really 

narrates is the bittersweet story of the Chinese community in the city.

 In the process, Rafeeq manages to capture thriving street food, disappearing family-run eateries, mah-jong clubs, a Chinese printing press that has closed down, another that hand writes the newspapers every morning, and the first all-woman dragon dance group preparing for the Chinese New Year.

 ?We often think of the Parsees as a minority but the Chinese are even more so,? says the man from Mumbai who is an international award-winning advertising and magazine photographer and has also shot three documentaries as a cinematographer. Legend? is his directorial debut.

 ?Two years ago, I decided to make a film just for myself,? Ellias explains. ?And the tale of this diaspora turned out to be a much bigger story than I thought.?

 Scheduled to air on BBC World on March 5, the documentary was shot in Calcutta and Toronto, to which the Chinese community of India largely migrated. ?We had a seven-member team for the Calcutta shoot which lasted two weeks,? recalls Ellias. The Toronto stint was much shorter, of only two days.

 ?The documentary broadly looks at three things,? explains Ellias. ?The lady who lived in the 60s and 70s in Calcutta?s Chinatown and introduced the city to Chinese food, the Chinese New Year with which the film begins and ends, and also Indo-Chinese relations in general.?

 In the film, Stella, the owner of a Chinese provision store, recalls Fat Mama, how delicious her noodles were and a how a whole bowl would be available ?just for four annas?. Paul, another Chinatown dweller, remembers her for the way she touched each customer not only with her cooking but also with her affectionate personal interest in them.

 The first screening of the film in Calcutta will be at Bengal Club on March 3, but it is Chinatown that the director is most keen on airing the film at. ?Sometimes I?m worried that some of them, who feature in the documentary, may not even be around at the time we show it in Chinatown,? Ellias says. 

 But he is excited about the BBC screening as well. ?It had to be aired on mainstream television and what better way than BBC??

 What next? ?You can?t make a living out of documentaries so I?ll have to go back to photography for now,? admits Ellias, who owns the ad agency Ice Cube Design amp; Films. ?But I?m working towards a feature film. It will be a small, compact and intimate film with a reasonable cast,? he offers, adding that there will be plenty of surprises in it.

 Till then, catch Legend? as a part of BBC World?s China Week at 2 pm on March 5 with a repeat on March 6 at 4 pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Celebration of theatre

 English theatre in our country owes an enduring allegiance to the plays of Shakespeare. Universal in appeal, his works are popular among theatre-goers by virtue of their dramatic intensity, powerful plots and a sheer ability to keep the audience entertained. Presented by Hutch in association with Prithvi Theatre, Perchance to Dream, produced by Footsbarn Travelling Theatre, is a celebration of Shakespearean drama in all its grandeur. A fascinating combination of reality and fantasy, it offers a kaleidoscopic mix of shadow-theatre, masks, silent film, marionettes, mime, music, dance and song from diverse cultures ? reflecting the multi-national, travelling character of the group. It is a play that weaves, echoes and expands upon themes from Shakespearean classics like Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night?s Dream and King Lear. Depicting the ubiquitous human condition, it portrays men in the grip of a plethora of violent emotions: love, jealousy, madness, greed and ambition.

 Event: Play in English, Perchance to Dream, produced by Footsbarn

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

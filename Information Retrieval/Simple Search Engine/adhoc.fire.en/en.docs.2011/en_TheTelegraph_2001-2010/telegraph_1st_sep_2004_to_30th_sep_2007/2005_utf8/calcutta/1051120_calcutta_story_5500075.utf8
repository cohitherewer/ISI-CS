 Melting pot of arts

 Cuisine, culture and crafts ? all from the colourful land of Kutch. For five days from November 24, the city will serve as a melting pot for the indigenous arts and crafts of Gujarat in a novel showcase initiated by its government.

 One of the major attractions in this dance-art-theatre medley ? called Gujarat Darpan ? is Bhavai, a dying folk art form. The calendar of events also includes kathak and Bharatanatyam, Kalamkari art and craft, contemporary paintings, and English and Gujarati theatre.

 Organised by Commissioner of Youth Services and Cultural Activities, Gujarat State Sangeet Natak Academy and Gujarat Lalit Kala Academy with Bhawanipur Education Society as one of the principal backers, the festival will be spread across Swabhumi, EZCC, Weavers Studio, Gallery Sanskriti, GD Birla Sabhagar and Tollygunge Club.

 ?It?s a scheme by the Gujarat government through which it wants to reach the arts and crafts to a wider audience,? says Priti Patel, whose centre for Manipuri Dance, Anjika, is playing city host.

 ?The thrust is equally on tradition and contemporary forms. So, there will be adivasi artisans, folk dancers and also those working on contemporary art and theatre. And for each event, we have local artistes for a cross-cultural interaction,? she adds. 

 The extravaganza starts off with an exhibition of the works of painter Ravi Shankar Rawal at Gallery Sanskriti, to be attended by painter Shuvaprasanna and filmmaker Aparna Sen. Day Two features a display of Kalamkari art and block printing at Weavers Studio.

 The action shifts to Swabhumi on the third day, where folk dance and food along with crafts will hold centre stage.

 In the evening, the stage will be set at Tollygunge Club for Avishkar, the 100-plus-member troupe, to showcase Gujarati folk dance and Bhavai.

 Day Three is also reserved for some English theatre ? Mrs Moorthy will be staged by Diana Raval at GD Birla Sabhagar, where Rudraprasad Sengupta will be chief guest.

 Day Four features kathak recitals by Ishira Parikh and Maulik Shah of Anart Dance Ensemble from Ahmedabad and Bharatanatyam by Rema Shrikant of ECPA Foundation, Vadodara, at GD Birla Sabhagar. Guru Govindan Kutty will be chief guest. Folk dance and Bhavai will travel to EZCC for more performances in the evening. 

 The festival of crafts and cuisine will be at Swabhumi, from noon to night, on November 26 and 27.

 The final day hosts classical dances at EZCC, while Gujarati play Ek Chhabili Panch Chhabila, directed by Raju Shukla, will take the stage at GD Birla Sabhagar in the presence of Chetna Jalan of Padatik.

 Fond Farewell

 From playing a portly librarian in Chokher Bali to being a front runner in the Calcutta Run, Paul Walsh has been there, done that. The city raised a toast to the former deputy head of mission, British Deputy High Commission, on Friday night. Bhaichung Bhutia led a gang of friends to the British Club, but the city surely hasn?t seen the last of Paul.

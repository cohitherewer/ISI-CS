 Sound of music

 An unforgettable acoustic feast awaits connoisseurs of Indian classical music at an evening of recordings of the music maestros, Bismillah Khan (picture, top left) and Vilayat Khan (picture, top right). Hosted by Srijan Listeners? Forum, the programme takes us to the romance and charm of the era of Extended Play (EP) recordings, which have become extinct since the 1960s. Comprising invaluable musical gems from the personal archives of a renowned music lover, it features historical seven-minute recordings of the two great ustads. Listeners can also hear the progression of recorded sounds from cylindrical to flat records of 78 rpm, 45 rpm, EP 45 rpm records, to 33 1/3 rpm ones, analogue and dat recordings. From the shehnai of Bismillah Khan flows a melodious mix of ragas ranging from bilawal, desi, basant, bhimpalasi, to yaman, kedara, khamaj and surmalhar, to chandrakauns, des, hori and chaiti. Vilayat Khan?s sitar weaves an enchanting musical spell with a rare 70-minute live recording of an alaap of gavati and a bhankar presentation. Listeners can also join the ?adda of anecdotes?, where they can share their thoughts about the music and the masters who played them.

 When: Today, 6 pm - 9 pm

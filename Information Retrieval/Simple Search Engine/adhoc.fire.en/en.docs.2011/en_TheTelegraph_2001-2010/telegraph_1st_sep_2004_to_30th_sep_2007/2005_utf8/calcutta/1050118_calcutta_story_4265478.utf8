The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Monday hike in fares

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From January 24, commuters will have to shell out at least 50 paise more whenever they take a bus, minibus or tram. 

 In a taxi, the minimum fare will be Rs 17. 

 The government has hiked bus and minibus fares at all stages, with the minimum for buses going up to Rs 3.50, against Rs 4 for minibuses.

 Taxi fares are up by Rs 1.70 after every subsequent 200 metres. Autorickshaw fares will be hiked, too, after consulting the unions representing them. 

 ?The price of diesel has gone up by about Rs 5 a litre since the last fare hike and bus operators were having to incur additional expenses of Rs 250 every day. The hike has been effected to pass on some of the burden to commuters,? explained transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Monday. 

 The minister said bus operators were dissatisfied over the revised fares. 

 ?I know they are unhappy, since we did not agree to all their demands. But, the decision has been taken after a long deliberation and the government will stand by it,? said Chakraborty. 

 Minimum tram fares have gone up from Rs 3.00 to Rs 3.50 in the first class and from Rs 2.50 to Rs 3.00 in the second class.

 Funds firm ordered to repay defaulter

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 In a significant order, Calcutta High Court on Tuesday asked a city-based finance company to deposit a sum of Rs 3.5 lakh with the lawyer of a customer.

 The customer had bought a truck with a loan from the company, but missed paying three consecutive instalments after the vehicle met with an accident.

 While passing the order, Justice Soumitra Pal asked the court-appointed arbitrator to complete his job within six months and settle the dispute between the buyer and finance company.

 Kabita Baisali, a resident of Kalberia, in Bankura, bought the truck in early 2001 by obtaining a loan from the finance company, which has its office on Ho Chi Minh Sarani, in the Shakespeare Sarani police station area.

 Baisali made a down payment of Rs 1.2 lakh and took a loan of Rs 3.8 lakh.

 According to the agreement, Baisali was to pay 35 monthly instalments of Rs 17, 863 each. She stopped paying the instalments after the vehicle met with a serious accident in January 2002.

 A sum of Rs 1 lakh had to be spent to make the truck fit for plying. Baisali did not pay the instalments for the three months her vehicle was in the repairing garage.

 In July 2003, the finance company, with the help of musclemen, forcibly took away the vehicle while it was parked in front of Baisali?s house.

 She then moved a petition against the company before the city civil court. The court appointed an arbitrator to settle the dispute.

 Failing to receive immediate relief, Baisali moved a petition in the high court through lawyer Lal Mohan Hazra. 

 The lawyer claimed that his client had already paid Rs 5 lakh for the vehicle. 

 Calcutta High Court asked the finance company to keep the vehicle in the custody of Shakespeare Sarani police station till the disposal of the case. 

 The lawyer appearing on behalf of the company informed the court that his client had already sold the vehicle to a third person, for a payment of Rs 3.25 lakh.

 The court expressed dissatisfaction over the company?s act and asked it to deposit a sum of Rs 3.5 lakh with the lawyer of the petitioner.

 ?The lawyer is directed to deposit the amount in a nationalised bank and the arbitrator appointed by the court will have to complete the arbitration within six months,? the court order said. 

 The high court has taken serious exception against companies forcibly taking away cars financed by them, when the buyers defaulted in paying instalments.

 A division bench, presided over by Justice A.K. Mathur, former chief justice of the Calcutta High Court, on the basis of a petition filed by the finance companies, had expressed the desire for framing a set of guidelines for recovering loans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Catching the beauty brigade 

Goodcare, 

the cosmetics counterpart of Baidyanath, was on a hunt for the girl with the prettiest 

face and a great personality. The four-week search ended with finals at City Centre 

on Saturday evening. The roadshow, featuring radio man Jimmy Tangree and singer 

Shayne Hyrapiet, saw six contestants compete for the Goodcare Princess title.

 The contestants preened on the van as Jimmy spun music and Shayne belted out numbers to keep young onlookers happy between question rounds that tested the mettle of the beauties. 

 After two sets of questions from Red FM RJs (judges for the evening), the award went to Tejashwini, a student of NIFT Kanpur on a trip to Calcutta. 

 ?The thrust was on looks but also on being natural and confident,? said Neha Sharma, director, Goodcare.

Glam search

 If the ramp beckons and the arc lights attract you, then this could well be your chance to make things happen. The time has come for the Gladrags Mega Model and Man Hunt, the Calcutta selections of which will take place in the city on January 22.

 The walk-in prelims will be held at Tantra, The Park discotheque, from 11 am on Tuesday with judges from Mumbai (along with Maureen Wadia) who will shortlist the candidates from Calcutta. 

 ?Twenty contestants from across the country in both the male and female model segments will be shortlisted for the finals to be held in Mumbai,? says a spokesperson for the contest.

 The lucky 20 will be flown down to Mauritius for a week?s grooming, mutual interaction and loads of fun before they take the stage on the deciding night. 

 Mixed noodles

 Thai speciality restaurant Baan Thai at The Oberoi Grand has started a food festival titled Asian Noodle. ?Most people feel that noodles are a side dish and can never be a main dish option. This is absolutely false and this festival intends to prove so,? said chef Tripathy. 

 The festival, on till this weekend, is not restricted to the Thai domain, but comprises Hanoi rice noodles, Japanese Udon noodles, Hong Kong-style double fried noodles, Indonesian stir-fried noodles and even Korean stir-fried glass noodles. They are all flavoured with spices, vegetables and meat options.

 Pho Ga is a Hanoi dish flavoured with hot red chillies and coriander and a choice of vegetables, chicken, seafood or pork to complete it. The Udon Noodle Bowl with Prawn Tempura is a delicious soupy dish simmered in dashi stock and served with Prawn Tempura. The Hong Kong Ngau Yuk Si-sor Tsau Min and Indonesian Bakmi Goreng with chicken and prawns are other options worth trying.

 Perhaps the most interesting is the Steam Boat from Northern China ? a simmering stock placed in a fondue pot with meat, seafood, vegetables, noodles and a variety of sauces.

 For the Thai loyalist, there is a choice between the Phad Thai (flat rice noodles with tamarind juice and peanuts) and the Bamee Krapaw (Thai egg noodles and vegetables stir-fried with shallots, hot basil and chillies).

Skin care

 The use of Botox to get rid of those untimely wrinkles or crow claws around the eyes is coming of age in Calcutta. After an exclusive Botox clinic on Sarat Bose Road that was launched last year, it?s the turn of India?s biggest beauty, health and fitness chain VLCC to take the plunge to make Calcutta look younger. The Alipore outlet of VLCC formally launched this beauty technique last week with actress June as special guest for the event. 

 Botox, a natural purified protein, when injected in the affected area relaxes the wrinkles causing the facial muscles to get a rejuvenated and youthful feel. Botox has been proved medically to have almost no side-effects and is not painful. The length of treatment depends on the intensity of the wrinkles. 

 ?It?s always better to start it in the early stages,? suggests centre manager Roshan Chaudhury.

College call

 NRI business tycoon Lord Swraj Paul made an unexpected stop on Saturday. He spent over an hour at Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College, interacting with students and visiting the non-academic departments. ?I was here six years ago and was impressed by the wide range of courses and teaching style. So, I wanted to catch up,? he said.

 Visiting the fashion design department, he was impressed with the dedication of the students. ?The students I?ve met here are very bright,? he said, pausing long enough to share a joke or two. 

 A brief Q amp;A session with the faculty and students concluded the visit. 

 ?I am an old man now. Don?t ever ask an old man for advice,? he smiled.

 Designer Meenakshi Dadoos summer collection is a subtle range of whites with feminine falls and interesting texturing. The NIFT graduate who launched her label over a year ago has definitely matured with her creations. 

 Though texturing remains Meenakshis forte, she has worked on extremely feminine cuts that carve out the contours of the body in this collection. Minimalist embellishments like the ones with copper coins on the hem of outfits add feminity and class.

 The white and off-white mulmul and fine cotton with lazy floral prints are perfect for summer. These can be teamed up with churidar or jeans to get the morning or evening look, says Meenakshi. 

 Also for the woman wanting to don a delicate look is a range of oriental wraps in white and cream georgette textured with intricate embroidery and bright threads. 

 A lot of my creations this time are inspired by Impressionist paintings of various artists, adds Meenakshi.

 Another set of bright uppers inspired by African animal prints is a highlight of the season. These pieces have been textured and tied and dyed in three to four colours ranging from the bright to the subtle. These are to be worn with pathan pants.

 Or pick up a few textured pieces inspired by the Rajasthani jackets that flaunt high collars and front pockets and ooze attitude.

 Selling from stores across the country, in Calcutta Meenakshi has her own outlet and workshop in New Alipore. 

 Sizzling hot

 With the monsoon clouds hanging low and the humidity on a high, La Terrasse at the Oberoi Grand is sizzling it up in anticipation of the rains.

 A veritable range of sizzlers accompanied by a mug of chilled draught beer is what the Fire and Ice festival at the coffee shop is all about, till June 30.

 Meat lovers can choose from the Sampler Satay Platter (chicken, prawn and fish satay on a bed of vegetable noodles with peanut sauce), La Terrasse Mixed Grill (tenderloin tournedos, pork sausage, bacon rashers and chicken liver), Chicken Steak Sizzler (breast of chicken filled with mince and pistachio with red wine pepper jus) and Burger Steak (choice of chicken or tenderloin). 

 An Indian option is the Tandoori Chicken Sizzler (tandoori chicken served with tandoori vegetables, black dal and garlic naan).

 Vegetarians can pick from Cottage Cheese Sizzler (cottage cheese grilled with honey sesame sauce), Tandoori Vegetable Platter (tandoori vegetables served with garlic naan and black dal) or a dish comprising tofu, cashews and stir-fried greens in garlic soya sauce.

 Vegetarian dishes are priced at Rs 400, while non-vegetarian items can set one back by Rs 450 to 500.

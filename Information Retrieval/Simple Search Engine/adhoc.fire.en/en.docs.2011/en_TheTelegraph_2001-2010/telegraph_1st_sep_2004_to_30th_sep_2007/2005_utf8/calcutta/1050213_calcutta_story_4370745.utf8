 The party had not yet begun when Archana checked into The Park. The 22-year-old Calcuttan was back in her hometown, a year after she left for Mumbai with a dream in her eyes and a spring in her steps. She went on to become one of the four winners of Channel [V]?s Get Gorgeous contest.

 ?There I was about to sit for my BA finals. We had come for a party at Tantra when friends made me take part in the auditions that were going on,? recalls Archana. A call-up to Goa for the finals followed. ?We were put through a week of grooming by the best in the business,? she adds. Then on the big day, she had to do her own make-up, style herself, walk on high heels ?for the first time in my life? ? and win the ?gorgeous? crown. 

 Shreya Pande and Priyanka Pandey?s story might take a similar turn if they make it to the final round. They had come to the party on Friday night, one of them unaware that the Get Gorgeous 2 night was on at Tantra. Shreya, a first year BBA student is politician Sadhan Pande?s daughter and she insists that her father is ?okay? about her taking a shot at modelling. ?We did very well in the auditions,? she beamed, walking back to the disc from the adjoining hall with her friend.

 The action had been on since 2.30 pm in that hall. But Rupakshi Roy Chowdhury, 20, had arrived early, by a couple of hours, just in case ?there was a big rush?. She went on to praise her eyes and blame her teeth on camera. 

 Pragya Paromita Dutta, however, awarded herself a perfect 10, on a par with her style icon Bipasha Basu. ?Then what do you want from us?? blurted out an incredulous line producer Sagar, who was running the show and had explained how they were ?not looking for India?s best supermodel but India?s next best supermodel whom we will groom?. Pat came the response: ?Select me!?

 Outside, her mother Sumita was waiting. ?We have relatives in Mumbai. If she gets selected and is taken there, they will look after her.? Would she be coming for the party at night? ?No,? came the frosty monosyllabic answer from the resident of Amherst Street. 

 In the ladies? room, notes were being exchanged between college mates Shireen Khan and Sonam Gurnani. ?Half of Bhawanipur (Gujarati Education Society) is here,? they grinned. And, why not? Archana had visited her alma mater in the morning, urging students to participate in the auditions. ?I came because Archana said size didn?t matter,? said the petite Shireen. 

 This year, only one aspirant will be chosen. And by the time the cast and crew made it to Tantra, Sagar was ?very impressed? with the city. ?Though Delhi (his earlier stop) had more participants, the quality was better in Calcutta,? he said.

 The first smoke bubble over the dance floor burst at 12.15 am. The first glass broke at 12.17 am. The first bhangra song of the night was put on air at 12.34 am. The Get Gorgeous 2 party had only just begun.

 Debut night

 If Bollywood stars shone down on BED during the launch earlier in the month, Virgose ? the dining lounge bar at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) ? lifted its shutters on Friday night with a sprinkling of Tollywood actors and actresses. 

 No Mallika Sherawats or Neha Dhupias here. Instead, our city?s own star brigade comprising Chandrayee, Koneenica, Arunima, Parambrata and Saswata were seen lounging around on the debut night.

 If no grumbles could be heard about the low glam quotient of the crowd, there were complaints galore about the lack of a proper dance floor. 

 ?We?re bored of the existing nightclubs. And the new ones opening are all lounges and not discos. So what happens to young people who want to dance to some commercial music?? rued a party animal. The dinner menu, comprising an Italian, Indian and Oriental spread, and a wide variety of drinks, however, gave the Virgose crowd some cause for cheer.

 Console call

 The brand new party address on Ballygunge Circular Road seemed to be the most wanted destination on Friday night. The reason: party animals desperate to swing to the beats of DJ Aqeel. 

 The ace DJ from Mumbai took to the console at BED and played to a packed house till early on Saturday. 

 His tracks like Superstar, Turn me on, Disco 82, Bin tere sanam and Main hoon na ensured that all feet were glued to the dance floor. And his peppy comments just added to the Friday fun. 

 ?The Calcutta night life has come of age. And the best thing is people here are now willing to experiment with different kinds of music,? Aqeel signed off.

 Showcause slap on college

 - Central Act flout, discrimination cry in institute?s refusal to admit disabled girl

 BARUN GHOSH

 Presidency College is under the scanner for refusing a physically-challenged girl admission to its English honours course.

 The government-run college was slapped with a showcause notice on Monday by Supriya Gupta, commissioner for persons with disabilities, for denying admission to Kamalika (name changed on request), daughter of a city doctor. Kamalika, who passed this year?s ISC examinations in the first division with 83 per cent in English, had applied for admission last month.

 ?She deserves to be admitted in accordance with Section 39 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, which says three per cent seats of new admissions will be reserved for disabled persons in educational institutions. But this was not adhered to,? Gupta told Metro.

 College principal Amitava Chatterjee, however, said Kamalika was not admitted as she failed to obtain the requisite marks in the eligibility test. ?How can I admit the disabled candidate if she does not secure 40 per cent in the admission test? This is our criteria for admission for disabled students,? he said.

 Gupta, however, pointed out that there is no such provision in the Act. ?How could the college principal determine on his own that a disabled student has to secure 40 per cent to get admission?? The government, in fact, issued an order on December 4 asking all state-run educational institutions to make provisions for the reserved seats during admission.

 The girl?s father claims discrimination from the outset. ?When we approached the college for admission, the authorities straightaway refused to allow her to sit for the eligibility test. Permission was given only after the commissioner?s office intervened,? said her father.

 Gupta has informed Sabyasachi Sen, joint secretary, higher education department, that Presidency College published a list of 90 successful candidates against 30 seats on July 6 without Kamalika?s name. Nor did the name of any other student with disability figure on the list.

 Body swap at hospital 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Body swap took on a bizarre dimension on Thursday as a ?wrong dead body? handed over by a leading private hospital was cremated.

 Two patients died at the Apollo Gleneagles Hospital late on Wednesday. The relatives of one were handed over the wrong dead body that they cremated. It was only when the other family came to claim the body that the horrible mix-up was detected and a police complaint was filed.

 ?It was a big mistake. We are conducting an inquiry,? said a spokesperson for the hospital.

 Kanchan Chowbey, 26, of Buxar, Bihar, was admitted 10 days ago with severe burns. Her husband, Sailendra Chowbey, is a trader based in Birbhum. She succumbed to her injuries on Wednesday night and her body was kept in the hospital morgue.

 The body of Manabendra Chakraborty, 60, a resident of Suren Thakur Road, who died of cancer, was also sent to the morgue around the same time.

 In the morning, Chakraborty?s relatives were handed over a body wrapped in plastic that they cremated.

 In the afternoon, Sailendra Chowbey came to claim his wife?s body, only to be handed over the body of an elderly man ? Manabendra Chakraborty. 

 ?We are conducting a probe,? said Javed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division.

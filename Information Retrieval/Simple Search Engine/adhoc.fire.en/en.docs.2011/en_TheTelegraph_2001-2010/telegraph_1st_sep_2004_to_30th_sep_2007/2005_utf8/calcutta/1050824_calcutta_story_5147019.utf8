 Principal, Shyamaprasad College (where a student was recently teased by an outsider)

 The entry of outsiders should, of course, be controlled. But an absolute ban is not possible, where each and everyone is stopped at the gate and identity verified. A college is not a factory. There has to be free movement of ideas. So such mechanical restraint is not desirable either. The way to regulate law and order is having a control on the college environment as a whole. For this, the students have to be disciplined. The students themselves may have links with outsiders. In such cases, it is impossible to control their entry. The onus of maintaining discipline on the campus does not rest only on the authorities. The students and the staffers should shoulder the responsibility as well. The unions also should play their part to stop undesirable incidents.

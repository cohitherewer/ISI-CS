 Cops glare at car blare

 KINSUK BASU

 Don?t let your car stereo blare. It?ll fetch a glare ? and more ? from the traffic sergeant. 

 The same holds for those who are in the habit of talking on the mobile phone while driving or riding two-wheelers without a helmet.

 Police have decided to act tough and impose a fine of up to Rs 100 if anyone is found playing the car stereo in high volume or committing the other two offences. 

 Officers-in-charge of traffic guards and sergeants posted at busy crossings across the city have been briefed about the crackdown.

 If an offender tries to flee, the traffic cop on duty will pass on the vehicle number on the wireless, so that the rap is delivered at the next crossing.

 ?People don?t seem to realise the dangers of distraction,? rued Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 ?Despite repeated warnings, people continue to talk on mobile phones while riding two-wheelers or driving cars. Many also play the car stereo in full volume. This is a cause of concern and we will ensure that people realise the dangers soon,? he added.

 The offences are reported from across the city, but the new rules will initially be enforced in select zones, like schools, where such lapses may lead to a disaster because of the heavy traffic.

 After 11 pm, when traffic cops are withdrawn, officers attached to police stations will take down the vehicle number of the offender, who will be prosecuted later.

 Officers are also planning to involve children in spreading awareness on the issue.

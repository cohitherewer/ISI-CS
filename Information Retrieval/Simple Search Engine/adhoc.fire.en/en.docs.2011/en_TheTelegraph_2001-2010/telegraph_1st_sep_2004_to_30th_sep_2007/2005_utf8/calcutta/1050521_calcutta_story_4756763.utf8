The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

Small Talk

Canned beer, canap?s and Cannes ? recipe for a rollicking 

party. Get the flavour right with the latest from Hollywood and Bollywood as unveiled 

on the sizzling red carpet in the French Riviera?

Cannes cauldron

 Calcutta to Cannes ? the trek isnt as long anymore, 

with media overkill of the most glamorous annual meet in filmdom. So geographical 

distance isnt any excuse in this global village to miss out on the spicy 

shots taken on the red carpet and beyond. Distances are also bridged with a distinct 

Indian flavour in the Cannes cauldron. 

 Nandita Das donning the Indian beauty garb as jury 

member (compare her to the sizzling Salma hanging out Hayek, another 

jury member, if you want), Mallika Sherawat busting The Myth vis-?-vis 

Jackie Chan, Aishwarya Rais stunning Western wardrobe this time as opposed 

to the dress debacle last year, a Penelope Cruz-starrer documentary on Mother 

Teresa... the patriotic preamble is long and winding this year! We sure have come 

a long way since Pather Panchali was first screened at the festival 50 

years ago. Even the Star Wars finale has been likened to The Mahabharata; 

Canne you take that?

Think pink

Cannes cleavages are plunging deeper and deeper (both 

front and back), but the focus this week was on Kylie Minogue, who has been detected 

with early breast cancer. The support from fans all over the world for the Australian 

pop sensation is at Fever pitch. Talk on the Minogue matter could lead 

to the bigger cause of breast cancer, which could afflict one in every nine women 

during their lifetime. A rethink of your current lifestyle as you refrain from 

lighting up the next time couldnt take away too much zing from your party.

Eye of a storm

She gets the eyes at the start of the film and loses 

it by the end of it all. But Nainas plot has sparked a fresh new 

debate thats grabbing eyeballs galore ? to donate or not to donate. With 

ophthalmic societies around the country trying to create facts out of fiction, 

the Urmila Matondkar-starrer can only have more audiences tuning in (case in point: 

a packed Friday morning show at INOX-Forum). Eye-catching all right!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Now, Calcutta as K-stop

 After biggies Yuva, Parineeta and The Namesake, it?s time for the Mumbaiyya small screen to fall in love with Calcutta?s shooting hot spots. Ektaa Kapoor?s Balaji caravan parked itself in the city for the whole of Saturday canning important episodes of Kasautii Zindagii Kay, one of the more popular soaps on STAR Plus.

 And just like the Pradeep Sarkar film, which is still running house-full in town, the K-juggernaut halted at places like the Victoria Memorial, the race course and the Prinsep Ghat. But unlike the elaborate Vidhu Vinod Chopra production, the pace of the Kasautii... shoot was zip, zap, zoom.

 By the time the team arrived at the Prinsep Ghat, a mini-crowd had gathered to catch their favourite small-screen couple, Anurag and Prerna, in live action. Anurag (Cezanne Khan) and Prerna (Shweta Tiwari) have been ruling the airwaves for some time now and their phuchka-eating stint at the Ghat was proof enough of their immense popularity.

 ?I know they love me here,? said Cezanne. ?It?s not the first time I am coming to Calcutta. It may sound cliched but I just love the mishti doi. Don?t go by my size ? I don?t diet and I am a voracious eater.?

 For Shweta, too, the Calcutta leg was something she was looking forward to for a long time, the shoot having been cancelled a couple of times before the date was finalised. After a cursory glance at the script, she went and gorged on the phuchkas even as chants of ?Prerna, Prerna? reverberated across the trolley tracks.

 But it was Ronit ?Rishabh Bajaj? Roy, who was easily the most wanted man of the moment. Ronit fans at the Ghat finally got to see the Jaan Tere Naam star when he appeared for just one shot. He was, however, missing from the Dakshineswar temple shoot later in the evening.

 ?It?s always great to come back to Calcutta but I could only be part of that one shot on the river. Hopefully, I can have a more substantial role in our next leg here,? quipped the man who has made silver-streaked hair a fashion. 

 In the serial, the Dakshineswar scene is the clincher with all the Kasautii... characters coming to Calcutta to be part of a religious gathering as a tribute to Anurag?s father. But the real twist in the tale comes when Bajaj goes into coma and Prerna suffers partial amnesia after a car crash.

 The Calcutta episode, to be telecast this Tuesday, is being used by Team Ektaa to bolster the recharged TRPs of Kasautii..., which were dropping till the soap was extended to Fridays.

 In fact, Kasautii... became the most-watched show on Friday television on its very first Friday with a staggering TRP of 11.97. ?The reason for extending the serial to Friday was the need to strengthen STAR Plus?s weekends for the return of Kaun Banega Crorepati on August 5,? revealed a STAR spokesperson.

 Multiplex moves

 The city?s second multiplex which 

 turned a year old last week is celebrating its birthday 

 with contests and prizes galore.

 89 Cinemas at Swabhumi is offering the Price-Off scheme whereby cine-goers can avail of a ticket worth Rs 89 if they show up on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays with clippings of the multiplex ads appearing in The Telegraph. From Monday to Thursday, the scheme offers two tickets at the same price.

 Movie buffs can also participate in the Theatre Contest which requires one to fill in a form comprising questions on the multiplex before settling down for a show. Right answers win prizes that include gift vouchers from Pizza Hut, KK?s Fusion and Kaya. The goodies are handed out during the intermission. 

 Even more lucrative prizes include free stays at Ffort Radisson, free movie tickets, handy Kenwood Spray Irons and IFB microwaves. 

 For cricket fans, nothing can beat Rahul Dravid?s autographs on items ranging from CD covers to playing cards and coffee mugs. To quench their thirst, cine-goers can buy a lemon ice tea and get a peach ice tea free.

 To make one?s movie experience memorable, Sony booths have been set up where ticket holders can get themselves clicked. All they need to do is drop in their email IDs, so the multiplex authorities can send the pictures across later.

 Those with a flair for photography may check out the special offers on handycams and digital cameras for on-the-spot buying. There?s a bid-and-win on IFB products as well.

 89 Cinemas opened to a lukewarm response last year with the Amitabh Bachchan-Akshay Khanna-starrer Deewar and followed up with Farhan Akhtar?s Lakshya in the second week. Among the Hollywood biggies, there were Troy and Van Helsing.

 ?Though the footfall was low in 

 the beginning, it has increased manifold over the past 12 

 months. Our economically priced tickets have been the strongest 

 motivation,? says 89 Cinemas general manager Prashant Srivastava.

 Presently, blockbusters like Dus and Parineeta are pulling in the crowds at the movie-going destination off EM Bypass.

 Catwalk calling: Swastika?s 

 fling with fashion

 Swastika Mukherjee loves being 

 in front of the camera, but the ramp leaves her a bit jittery. 

 Yet the sweet and svelte actress will do the catwalk at 

 a tribute to make-up artiste Prabir De. ?This will be my 

 second show. When I was on the ramp for the first time, 

 I felt I would fall unconscious,? she laughs. ?It?s a different 

 kind of feeling. But as people know of our occupation, we 

 just need to be ourselves as we walk the ramp,? adds Swastika, 

 who will be dressed in outfits by Snehasish, the man who 

 made those gorgeous saris for the Parineeta women.

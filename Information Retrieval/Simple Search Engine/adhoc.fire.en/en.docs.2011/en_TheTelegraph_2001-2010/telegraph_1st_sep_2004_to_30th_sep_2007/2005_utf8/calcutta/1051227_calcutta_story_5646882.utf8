 Sign-scan expert to unravel 

?kidnap?

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The ?abduction? case of Mini Kanodia has taken an intriguing turn with police exploring the possibility of commissioning a graphologist to ascertain the validity of the signatures on the marriage certificate.

 Mini was allegedly abducted by Mohit Srivastav from Vidyasagar Setu on December 10. The cops found her having tea with Mohit and two of his friends in a garage in Posta the next morning.

 P. Mukherjee, a marriage registrar in Howrah, later said he had presided over the marriage of Mini Kanodia, a resident of 5, Nityadhan Mukherjee Road, with Mohit Srivastav, a resident of the same building, on November 22. The addresses of the ?abduction? accomplices also matched those of the witnesses to the registered marriage.

 The ?abduction? took place five days before Mini was to marry Vikash Khaitan, a resident of Howrah. The 25-year-old was on her fiance?s motorcycle when she was allegedly whisked away in a car by Mohit.

 ?It is most logical to seek the help of a graphologist,? stated N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 ?It seems that without the services of a graphologist, we won?t be able to make any headway in the case. Only an expert can say whether the signature on the marriage registration certificate is Mini?s or not,? pointed out an officer investigating the case.

 Licence row bars import of hilsa

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The hilsa may not be around to spread monsoon magic this year if a deadlock in the import of the Bengali?s favourite fish from Bangladesh is not broken immediately. 

 And as S.A. Maqsood, secretary, Hilsa Fresh Fish Importers Association, pointed out, the mandarins in Delhi will never understand how important the fish is to all Bengalis. ?Some initiative should be taken by the state government so that the Centre clears our no-objection certificates,? he added.

 ?We have stopped importing hilsa from Bangladesh from May 16,? said Maqsood.

 When the association stops importing hilsa from the neighbouring country, it may mean that the fish will disappear from the plates of Bengalis. Maqsood claims 90 per cent of the total hilsa consumed by Calcutta comes from Bangladesh via the association. 

 ?The hilsa produced in India constitutes only 10 per cent of the total fish consumed. If the association stops importing fresh hilsa, the fish will all but vanish from the kitchens of Bengal,? he warned.

 The organisation of 38 hilsa importers from Bangladesh was compelled to take the drastic decision after a Delhi law made it mandatory for all importers of livestock products to have a sanitary import permit issued by the department of animal husbandry and dairy of the Union ministry of agriculture.

 The association, that imports over 5,000 metric tonnes of hilsa from Bangladesh annually, said the Central rule was published in a gazette notification on July 9, 2001. The association then submitted a missive with the department seeking the permit. 

 After receiving the association letter, the department?s eastern regional office of animal quarantine and certification services issued the necessary no-objection certificates, on the basis of which the importers were getting their consignments cleared by the Petrapole Land and Customs Station, on the Indo-Bangla border in Bongaon. 

 ?But recently, the department informed us that the certificates will not be issued afresh. So, from May 16, hilsa imports from Bangladesh have been stopped,? Maqsood said.

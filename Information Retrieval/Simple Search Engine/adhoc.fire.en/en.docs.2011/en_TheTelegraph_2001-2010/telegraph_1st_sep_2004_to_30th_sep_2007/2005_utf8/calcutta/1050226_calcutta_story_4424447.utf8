 Exclusive ethnic store Weavers Studio is organising a unique exhibition with participants from different states of India exhibiting a summer collection of Uppada, Gadhwal, Benarasi, chiffon, georgette and organza saris. There will also be a display of fabrics, dupattas, scarves and stoles in traditional techniques of handblock prints and tie and dye.

 Assam-born textile designer Julie Kagti of the label Sutra incorporates both modern and traditional techniques to create designs and products that are ?aesthetically appealing, contemporary in style and contain a dash of humour?.

 The label Khoj, created by Indore-based Kavita Sanghi, contains woven and printed cotton and silk-blended saris in a variety of colours. Sanghi makes Maheshwari textiles both contemporary and trendy.

 Finally, there is a collection by Women Weave from three handloom centres: Kota, known for its jacquard work, Chanderi with its popular butis and delicate floral borders, and Maheshwar, noted for narrow stripes and checks. 

 It is the initiative of Sally Holkar of Women?s Weave that has made this multi-faceted exhibition possible. ?With a team of dedicated professional women, Holkar intends to contribute significantly to the evolution of handloom weavings into a sustainable industry,? observed a spokesperson. The exhibition is on till March 5.

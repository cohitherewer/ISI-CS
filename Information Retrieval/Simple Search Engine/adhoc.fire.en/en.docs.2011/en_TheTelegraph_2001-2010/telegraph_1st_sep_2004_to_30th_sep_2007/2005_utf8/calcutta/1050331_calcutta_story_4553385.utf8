 Students amp; religion: a question of answers

created the furore 

 It was a book launch. At least it started out that way. 

 The Vedas, Hinduism, Hindutva, the work of three historians at the Centre for Historical Studies of JNU, was to be released at Basanti Devi College. The discussion that followed drew a full house ? of students. 

 The book was written with twin objectives. ?Hindus have no organisation, so neither do they form any community-centric beliefs. This is why even educated Hindus know so little about the religion,? argued Kunal Chakrabarti, one of the three authors. The need to inform the curious has been precipitated by, what Romila Thapar calls in the foreword to the book, ?the political mobilisation of substantial dimension which, under the label of Hindutva, has claimed that the Hindus are a nation, and as the indigenous people of India have primacy in citizenship?. ?It is important to analyse why information is being distorted,? Chakrabarti added.

 Once Nabanita Dev Sen released the book, the panel was open to questions. Copies of the book had already been distributed among schools, and students desirous of raising questions had submitted names.

 It started with the illustrations ? cartoons, that in the words of illustrator Soumik Nandy Majumdar, talked the language of laughter and worked as a parallel text, supplementing the commentary or making independent comments.

 ?Why is devraj Indra shown to sport goggles?? was the second question of the afternoon. As the illustrator started to speak, he was cut short by a more pointed query ? which Purana or Veda describes the god in sunglasses?

 The panelists turned to literature and lore ? Parashuram?s Jabali, Monoranjan Bhattacharya?s Ram-Ravana series, a conversation between super sleuth Byomkesh and Ajit in Saradindu Bandyopadhyay, describing Indra as a debauch and a drunkard. ?This is a mark of affection, not ridicule,? Tania Sarkar, another of the authors, tried to reason.

 Then came a volley? Why do you ridicule only the Hindu deities? Why has Prophet Mohammed been sketched faceless, as is the stipulation? Did you not dare to touch upon aspects like polygamy?

 A sole student voice, throbbing with emotion, rose in protest, as a defender of her faith. 

 ?Do not touch us if you dare not touch them,? seemed to be the message from the majority.

 A non-student member of the audience played peace-keeper, pointing out that reforms have to come from within a community.

 Before reforms, opinions have to be formed and voices educated. For that, someone has to answer a lot of questions, outside the classroom.

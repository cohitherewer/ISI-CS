Singer and the song

After belting out many a chartbuster, SUKHVINDER 

SINGH is all set to slip into the role of music director, writes Pratim D. 

Gupta

From Chhaiyya chhaiyya to Saaki saaki, 

if there?s one singer who has rocked every time he?s held the microphone, it?s 

Sukhvinder Singh. Starting out as just a Rahman-favourite, he has gone on to sing 

for many a music director and even chipped in with his compositions for one-off 

tracks in Bollywood blockbusters. 

?I sing very few songs compared to other mainstream 

singers,? said Sukhvinder, during a whirlwind performance-tour of the city recently. 

?I have to be comfortable with a project and the people associated with it to 

give my best. But four-five good songs like Saaki and Woh Kisna hai 

are better than 150-200 run-of-the-mill songs.?

For Sukhvinder, it is the performance levels that 

matter. ?The only way one can distinguish himself from the rest is by putting 

himself in the song, from the heart. You have to feel the song during the recording 

itself and then perform accordingly.?

The man who has been ?used to doing one song a film? 

is now set to turn full-fledged music director. ?I have scored the music for two 

of Subhash Ghai?s projects, Iqbal, directed by Nagesh Kukunoor, and Chandni 

Chowk, directed by Suhail Tatari. I am also doing the music for Satish Thakur?s 

Amar Joshi Shaheed Ho Gaya, which has an interesting concept of a film 

within a film.?

The new experience hasn?t been easy for the singer-composer. 

?It was very scary,? admitted Sukhvinder. ?I had to be very careful while composing 

songs for the same film but for different situations. Consistency is the key. 

And when I have my name in the credits as music composer, it means I should be 

in complete command. I have tried to make my music very humble, very down-to-earth,? 

he stressed.

While creating songs comes easy to Sukhvinder, he 

finds scoring the background music quite exhausting. ?It is a very time-consuming 

task. It?s also a very creative and interesting process. But for me, the background 

score is not just about a few sounds and stock music, but about creating special 

themes.?

Sukhvinder feels there is a real dearth of music composers 

in the country right now.

?In the 60s and 70s, there were just four or five 

main singers and more than 15-20 composers. Now, we have so many singers but very 

few quality composers. Rahman, Ismail Darbar, Sandeep Chowtha ? these are some 

of the people who like my voice and style and engage me to sing for their projects.?

But a complete foray into Bollywood music doesn?t 

mean curtains for Sukhvinder?s Indipop music career. ?My new album should come 

out in July. I have called it Not For Sale. It has very romantic and very 

simple songs with no experimentation whatsoever,? he said, adding that he wanted 

people to be able to sing the songs. 

?It is not just for the metros and the discos. It 

is targeted towards every person and every place. I want feriwalas and 

doodhwalas to hum my songs as they go about their daily chores,? signed 

off the singer with an attitude.

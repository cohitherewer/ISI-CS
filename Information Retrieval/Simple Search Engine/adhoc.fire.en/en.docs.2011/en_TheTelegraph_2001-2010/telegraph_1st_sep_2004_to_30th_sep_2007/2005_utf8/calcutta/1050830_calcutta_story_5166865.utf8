 The second series of the GoodLife Talk Show began with a bang on Saturday evening to a packed house at Uday Sadan in Golf Green.

 The topic for the evening ? Fit amp; Fabulous ? was an instant hit with the crowd, comprising more men than women!

 Residents were given a chance to put forward their fitness-related queries to the guest of the evening, popular television actress Deboleena Dutta. 

 Setting the Q amp;A ball rolling was anchor Rita Bhimani, as she asked the petite star of Ek Akaasher Niche and Neel Seemana how she managed to keep herself so fit despite such a busy schedule.

 Fitness to me is having the strength to do the work that I want to. Its not about being how thin or fat one is. I dont need to work out to keep fit as I dont have the tendency to put on weight. So, that way I am lucky, smiled the lady in black.

 The first audience question came from 73-year-old P.K. Aich who wanted to know what he could do to keep fit and fine at his age. Deboleena prescribed an early morning walk, coupled with a yoga session under proper guidance. 

 An after-dinner walk could also do wonders to your staying fit. At your age, one should also follow certain dietary restrictions to lead a healthy life, said the actress.

 A young Soumyajit Bhattacharya in his twenties when asked how Deboleena would prefer to keep fit ? through a workout session or by watching her diet. A workout session is any day a better option than dieting of any form, she smiled. 

 What followed next, in the form of a 10-minute break from fitness tips, was an open-house quiz comprising five questions for the audience on The Telegraph, with right answers fetching mementos.

 The next round of questions was kicked off by Abanti Bandyopadhyay, an office-goer who asked Deboleena to prescribe a normal everyday diet for a healthy life. 

 As I said earlier, dietary requirements tend to vary from person to person. But yes, there are certain universal things that can help you stay fit. One should start with a very heavy breakfast comprising high protein amount for non-vegetarians and a lot of greens for vegetarians. Lunch should be half the breakfast and dinner always less than what fills you up. And the surest way to stay healthy is to avoid junk food totally, stressed the actress.

 The flurry of queries from all corners of the packed room then ranged from the minimum number of glasses of water to be downed to dietary requirements for housewives and a solution to remaining fit without either dieting or working out.

 The session, stretching for over and hour, came to a close with Shukla Banerjees question of what the diet for a 45-plus woman should be. Every woman starts facing a series of problems after this age. So, she needs to take special care of her diet and cut down a lot on animal proteins. I would also advise all women of this age to definitely consult a doctor and take in certain calcium and vitamin capsules, said the actress, seconded by Bhimani.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Houseproud 

 GOOD LIFE AT HOME: CLASSY amp; COSTLY

 Not ready was the finding in 2002. 

 Raring to go is the forecast in 2005. A combination of factors 

 ranging from real-estate boom to a spurt in the number of 

 double-income families and a sea change in mindset to skyrocketing 

 disposable income has set the branded furniture and home 

 d?cor market in the city abustle.

 Leading furniture brand Furniturewalla 

 shelved its Calcutta plans after conducting a survey in 

 2002. Things changed enough in less than two years for the 

 ?first furniture brand of the country? to lay store by 6, 

 Hungerford Street in September 2004.

 According to Farhan Furniturewalla, 

 who commissioned the survey to check wallet power and preference 

 for trendy lifestyle furniture among Calcuttans, spending 

 prowess was very much there in 2002, but the house-proud 

 threshold was low ? few were willing to spend a packet on 

 doing up their places.

 Cut to 2005. ?The taste of the 

 consumers in Calcutta has transformed from common to classy. 

 It seems that people have woken up to the fact that comfortable 

 beds and swanky kitchen accessories are now available in 

 their city as well,? observes Farhan.

 Most major players in the furniture, 

 home d?cor and accessories markets have got wind of the 

 cabinet reshuffle ? the Calcuttans? new-found fondness for 

 filling home space with things classy and costly.

 The furniture facts and figures 

 speak for themselves, with 15 premium stores and a host 

 of accessories and home d?cor stops springing up in the 

 past 12 to 18 months.

 The flagship store of the Attitude 

 chain, owned by Universal Specialities Ltd, opened its doors 

 at 7/1A, Loudon Street on Friday. The Attitude basket comprises 

 latest international trends and designs in home improvement 

 products from Tvilum-Scanbirk A/S of Denmark, the ?world?s 

 largest manufacturer of domestic furniture?, which supplies 

 to big global brands like IKEA, Home Depot and B amp;Q.

 From bedroom sets and wardrobes 

 to kitchen solutions and accessories, the Attitude outlet 

 imports all products from Tvilum-Scanbirk?s five fully automated 

 furniture factories in Denmark in knockdown, ready-to-assemble 

 condition. A design centre-cum-room planner is also housed 

 in the store to provide critical inputs to the customer.

 ?I personally believe that Calcutta 

 has huge spending potential, but it lacked options in lifestyle 

 furniture. You need to give them the right product at the 

 right price,? says Gaurav Goenka, CEO amp; customer companion, 

 Universal Specialities Ltd, owners of the Attitude brand.

 Brand building

 This bullish statement reflects 

 the mood in the branded lifestyle furniture segment in the 

 city, which has seen entry of new brands like Furniturewalla, 

 Espania, Style Spa and Cocoon in the past one-and-a-half 

 years. A measure of success: Style Spa?s Camac Street store 

 is the highest-grossing single outlet in the country.

 Demand drivers have contributed 

 greatly to the growth of this segment. From the buyers? 

 point of view, the bigger brand names attract attention 

 and inspire trust. ?These days, people are far more well 

 travelled, aware and house proud. They know of the brands 

 that are trustworthy,? says Vikram Arora of Espania, explaining 

 the trigger behind the sudden spurt in demand for branded 

 furniture.

 From designer beds to dining tables, 

 Calcuttans are buying branded items priced anywhere between 

 Rs 25,000 and Rs 1,50,000.

 Though no one is ready to hazard 

 a guess about the volume of the market, industry insiders 

 say the market is growing fast and there is little to suggest 

 that the growth run will slow down.

 The maturity of the customers 

 is reflected in the buying patterns, with planned purchase 

 ruling over impulse buys. If how to buy involves deliberation 

 and careful decision-making, what to buy is dictated by 

 worldview. ?The purchases here are in sync with global trends 

 as the contemporary range is doing very well. People are 

 going in for lighter and sleeker varieties rather than the 

 heavier pieces,? adds Farhan.

 Ajay Rawla of Cocoon, on Theatre 

 Road, explains the marketing strategy that has helped the 

 sprawling, premium, cool and branded lifestyle zones elbow 

 out the dingy, sawdust-infested and dirt-cheap shops on 

 BB Ganguly Street.

 ?The ambience in a lifestyle furniture 

 store makes people aspire for the same comfort level and 

 d?cor in their houses,? feels Rawla, adding that clever 

 positioning has helped reduce the industry?s dependence 

 on the marriage season for sales.

 Though the marketplace has grown 

 suddenly, there is space for more. ?The rise in competition 

 will create awareness and deepen the market,? feels Farhan.

 D?cor dreams

 Flipping for fine furniture is 

 just half the story, as the city learns to deck up with 

 a host of home d?cor items. From spending the extra thousands 

 to getting fresh flower arrangements to buying the latest 

 crystal collection from Swarovski is the name of the good 

 life game ? all to make it a dream house.

 The annual growth rate in the 

 d?cor market has been more than 25 per cent in the past 

 two years and industry insiders expect it to soon cross 

 the 30-35 per cent mark.

 A case in point is the performance 

 of Swarovski. The two-year-old outlet in Forum is now the 

 highest selling Swarovski outlet in India. ?Earlier, only 

 people from the business class were buying such high-end 

 home d?cor items, but now the client base has broadened,? 

 says Shree Ballabh Daga, franchisee owner of the Forum outlet.

 Tani Lall of Avishkar, the popular 

 point on Park Street, gives credit to the young Calcuttan, 

 who doesn?t mind ?spending a few thousands extra? on home 

 ?beautility?.

 For Krishna Belani, owner of Mahal 

 lamp store, the emergence of ?double-income professionals? 

 as home-builders has been the most significant development 

 in this segment.

 As the expenditure graph soars, 

 basic buying for the home is travelling along exclusive 

 lines. Drapes, for example, sell swift at Rs 1,500 a metre.

 From furniture to flowers, doing 

 up homes is the way to live. When Ferns and Petals, a national 

 flower boutique chain, set up store in Calcutta last December 

 ? after opening at least 30 other shops across the country 

 ? the reason for reluctance was apparent.

 ?Initially, the company didn?t 

 think Calcutta had the right market,? says Indira Agarwal, 

 franchisee of Ferns and Petals in Calcutta. 

 But in the past six months, the 

 average bill on flowers and accessories from regular customers 

 has been vaulting Rs 500 per week.

 ?We charge anything between Rs 

 800 and Rs 1,000 per arrangement of artificial flowers and 

 there are people here who have 15 of these in their homes,? 

 reveals Indira.

 Today, a bed of roses is what 

 the Calcuttan wants to go back home to.

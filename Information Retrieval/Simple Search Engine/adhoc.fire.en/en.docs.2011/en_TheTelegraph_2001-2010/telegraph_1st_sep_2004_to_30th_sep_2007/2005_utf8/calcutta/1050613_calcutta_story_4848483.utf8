The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week 

 without?

 Watching Parineeta

 Those who havent had the privilege of devouring great 

 Bengali classics may be thankful for their screen adaptations. 

 Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyays classic Parineeta 

 has been modified to fit 1962 Calcutta, when the city 

 was known for its vibrant charm. The love story of Shekhar 

 (Saif Ali Khan), a budding musician, and Lolita (Vidya Balan) 

 provides more than period exotica. If that doesnt 

 gear you up to get to the nearest hall, take an interest 

 in Saifs return to his maternal roots and see the 

 Dil Chahta Hai dude take an intense turn for a change.

 Getting jamai in a jam 

 Turn the festival of Jamai Sashthi on its head by taking 

 out the hapless son-in-law and forgetting your wallet at 

 home or getting them to pitch in by taking much too long 

 in the kitchen to fix that traditional feast you promised. 

 A smart sonny is sure to see the humour of it all and take 

 the opportunity to make a politically correct statement 

 by turning the day into more of a family get-together. 

 Doting on Randeep 

 If you have grown weary of watching the same Bollywood crop 

 over and over again, heres a new dish to drool over. 

 Randeep Hooda is sizzling hot, blazing through Ram Gopal 

 Varmas D with a quiet confidence that doesnt 

 only take his rivals by surprise. So what if he is supposed 

 to be Sushs boyfriend, Hoodas looks and a dont-mess-with-me 

 attitude make him everybodys eye candy.

 Having a girls night 

 out

 With city nightclubs suddenly choosing to pamper the gals 

 with free entry and discounts, its time to give the 

 men a royal ditch. Strike out with your pals and make the 

 most of it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Strike cry over bus age bar 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Bengal Bus Syndicate, the largest body of private bus-owners, on Sunday threatened to withdraw its fleet from the city roads if the state government stuck to its decision to scrap vehicles manufactured before 1990.

 The government has issued a notice asking owners of private buses and minibuses to replace pre-1990 vehicles by December 31, 2005, to conform to emission control norms. 

 Nearly 70 per cent of the 7,500 vehicles owned by members of the syndicate were manufactured before 1990.

 Sumantra Chowdhury, secretary of the transport department, said on Sunday that the decision to scrap pre-1990 vehicles was taken after several rounds of meetings with private transport bodies. ?The threat by the transport bodies is nothing but a pressure tactic,? he told Metro. 

 Syndicate president Swarna Kamal Saha asserted that it was the responsibility of transport bodies to ensure that their vehicles conform to emission norms, irrespective of age. ?The decision to scrap the bulk of our fleet on emission grounds is unacceptable.? 

 Saha claimed that catalyst diesel devices and electronic catalyst converters had already been installed in a number of vehicles to control pollution. ?If the emission level of our vehicles is below 65 Hartridge smoke units (HSU), as per norms, why should we replace them?? he asked.

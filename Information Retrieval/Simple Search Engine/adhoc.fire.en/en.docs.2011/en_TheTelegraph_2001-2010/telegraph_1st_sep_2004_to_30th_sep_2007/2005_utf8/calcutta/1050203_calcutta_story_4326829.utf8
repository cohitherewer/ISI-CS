The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Poetry is dead in France?

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 ?C?est tr?s romantique (It is very romantic),? Dominique Fernandez smiles at the flickering light of the candle. The lights had gone out at the Book Fair and the 75-year-old French novelist had just finished an interaction with Bengali writers on love in the semi- darkness.

 Fernandez was hours away from releasing his book The Indian Sentiment at the fair. The launch would be significant as it would be the first time a French author would release his work in India before in France.

 ?The idea of the book came from an Indian journalist when I was in Delhi last year. (Italian filmmaker) Pier Pasolini had written a book on India in 1960. The journalist asked me to take the book as a starting point and add my own views.? 

 The project took Fernandez on a journey across the country ? Mumbai, Calcutta, Goa, Bihar, Jaipur, Sekhawati, Benaras? 

 But his first visit to India was 20 years ago. ?It was the Year of India in France. So many Indian writers went to meet us just as we came to meet them here. I was in Calcutta for 10 days, attending conferences and meeting people.?

 Among them was Satyajit Ray. Fernandez had spent an afternoon with him at his Bishop Lefroy Road residence.

 ?Among the books in his room were many French titles. He said French literature had a major influence on him in his formative years. In France, people know Ray as a great filmmaker. But he is such a great author too.?

 In that moment lit by memories of Ray, one of the seniormost authors in France, crowned by its highest literary award Prix Goncourt, makes a startling comment. ?There are few poets left in France. Poetry is dead there.? 

 Fernandez explains how the poets are increasingly being replaced by singers in the land of Baudelaire. ?They write beautiful lyrics, like Barbara, but they are not poets,? he reflects sadly, having just shared the dais with Sunil Gangopadhyay, Joy Goswami and Tilottama Majumdar. ?Here it seems even the novelists write poetry.?

 Fernandez lays the blame largely on publishers and the media. ?Few books of poetry are printed. Poets are never featured on the television and the radio.?

 But the poets are not above criticism as well. ?Most of them live in intellectual ivory towers. They have become cut off from the people. Neither do they write of simple emotions like love. For that, you have to listen to songs.?

 If the literary change in France makes him sad, Calcutta in his eyes has changed for the better. ?Twenty years ago, there were people dying on the streets. Now there are more cars.And more chaos. That way, it hasn?t changed much,? he smiles again.

 Fernandez, who has been translated in 20 languages, including Russian, Chinese, Korean and Hebrew, feels it is the greatest honour for an author to be translated in a foreign country. ?The more distant the country, the greater the honour. There people judge me by the book, not by any idea of me.?

 Back to the here and now. Having attended most major book fairs in Europe, he admits abroad things are more organised. ?But there would be no surprises. So it is boring. I like this precariousness about the fair as about the city. Remember, I am of Mexican origin,? he says with a twinkle in his eyes.

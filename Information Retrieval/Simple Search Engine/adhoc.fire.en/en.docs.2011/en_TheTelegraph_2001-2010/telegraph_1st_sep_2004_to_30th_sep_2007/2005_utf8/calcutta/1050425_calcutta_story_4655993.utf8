Park Street was Orange Street on Saturday night as the Delhi-based electronic-rock-fusion band stormed Someplace Else as part of the Thank God It Rocks festival. Tired of the same ol? bands playing the same ol? music, the SPE crowd really rose to the new sound largely concocted by an amalgamation of rock guitars, drums, Indian percussion and classical vocals with a strong electronic foundation.

 A very different-sounding electronic version of Another brick in the wall set the ball rolling for the night and largely introduced to the packed Park pub what Orange Street was all about and what was to follow. So the place, largely unreceptive to original tracks, was lapping up new, unheard numbers in no time and even demanding for repeats.

 ?The last time I played in Calcutta was in 1996 at Nazrul Mancha and the experience on both nights was quite similar with the audiences being more understanding than any other place in the country,? said Anirban, founder-member of the band. ?They were pretty fast to figure out that we were not just another rock ?? roll band.?

 Singing largely from their last album (yet to release in India officially), Dharma, Orange Street played tracks like Mirror, Morey piyaa, Parminder, Five points and Harey Rama Harey Krishna. ?Even the response to our three-day-old untitled track was quite unexpected. There were people asking us to play that one again, too,? smiled Anirban.

 Headed for Sweden in July, Orange Street plans to add more songs and release Dharma officially. And the Calcutta experience is something they would like to incorporate in their collection.

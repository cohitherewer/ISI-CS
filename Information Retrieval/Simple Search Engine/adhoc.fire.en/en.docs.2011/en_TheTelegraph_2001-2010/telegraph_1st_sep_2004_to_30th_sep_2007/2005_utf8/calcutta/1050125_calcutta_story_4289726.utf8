The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A touch of drama

Masks make a bold, personal statement that 

can be used to embellish public and private spaces, says Himika Chaudhuri

Glimpses

Masks hang on the wall of the sitting area in Sujata Sarawgi?s Esplanade home.

Masks can also come in table-top variations.

A view of African ?masks of the dead?.

Four years ago, an ad hoc idea turned into a permanent 

one at Taj Bengal. With renovation work on at the coffee shop, a makeshift alternative 

was thrown together in the lobby. With growing popularity, By The Way became more 

than an afterthought, and the dining space was decorated with masks and rechristened 

The Masquerade. Large, imported opera masks in various colours now hang from its 

walls to lend a dramatic touch.

Using masks to jazz up interiors can work just as 

well at home.

?Masks are a very individualistic prop for home decor. 

What might seem artistic to one may seem scary to another,? says Gopa Ray, interior 

designer of the Taj group.

Collecting masks is becoming a hobby for urban homemakers 

and the quality of purchase has changed over the years ? from the earthen santhal 

couple to tribal masks picked up from Africa.

?As the Indian traveller takes to the world, picking 

up masks as souvenirs is becoming a hobby,? says interior designer Anita Mansata, 

who has a collection of African masks herself.

Shop signals

The options are endless. From the makeshift shops 

close to home at Swabhumi to a village in remote Nigeria, let your fancy wander 

as far as your budget.

Eastern India offers a wide collection of masks ? 

from chhau to gambhira, Tibetan wooden masks available across Darjeeling 

to delicate shola pith creations. 

?You can pick up excellent wooden masks from Dinajpur 

and also from Purulia,? says textile designer Sujata Sarawgi. She is also a keen 

mask collector, with a varied range of samples from villages in Africa and Egypt.

?In Egypt, you would not usually find hollow masks. 

They have sculpted faces of Pharaohs in solid wood which can serve as masks,? 

she explains. The African masks, often referred to as the ?mask of the dead?, 

are carved from old wood and painted in various colours.

?Africa is by far the best place to collect masks,? 

adds Anita. But if you are trying to build a collection, state emporiums and Swabhumi 

will do for starters.

Decor diktat 

?I would suggest the use of masks in a neutral place, 

like a lobby or at the entrance,? advises Anita. ?Since masks have various meanings 

and some might feel uncomfortable surrounded by fierce looking ones, it is best 

not to use them in bedrooms,? feels Gopa. 

Sujata on the other hand, has mounted her entire collection 

in the bedroom. ?Though I find these masks very artistic, my family finds them 

depressing. So I have never tried to decorate other rooms with them,? she confesses.

Masks should be allowed to remain a distinct entity 

in the set up of a room, adds Gopa. They can be used, however, in small corners 

or to embellish informal areas like the bar. 

?A small African theme corner in a waiting area is 

a good idea,? suggests Anita. But mix-and-match with caution.

Zonal energy

?Feng Shui believes that everything in a room emits 

some kind of energy. So weird or fierce looking masks hanging from walls can have 

a negative impact on our lives,? says Feng Shui expert Sweety Arora. While the 

mask of a tiger opposite the main door promises protection to the house, a cheerful 

or friendly mask can add happiness.

?One has to be careful while decorating children?s 

rooms with masks. Rough looking masks could impact the child?s personality, making 

them rude and disobedient,? cautions Sweety.

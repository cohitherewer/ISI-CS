 They are beginning to make a name in the fashion circuit and their clothes line d finds a place at some of the better-known fashion outlets in Australia and in Chennai. Now, they have big plans for Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi.

 Designers Navonil Das and Debarghya Bairagi, or Nil and Dev, have so far retailed in the city from their studio in Howrah.

 On September 2, they unveiled their collection at Little India, the Elgin Road boutique, in the presence of Preeti Goenka and Sumedha Saraogi. Models Sanjukta and Emmanuelle draped some of their creations.

 The classics have always been an inspiration and our collection reflects the revival of the classics. Cuts and detailing form an integral part of our designing because a dress must pamper the very essence of feminine grace. It must enhance and complement her contours well, says Nil.

 But a dress should never overshadow ones personality, rather it should define it further. Our collection has been designed keeping in mind the independent woman of today who knows her style and can carry it off with poise, adds Dev.

 The collection offers a medley of Western and ethnic adornments, mostly in muted shades with occasional splashes of bright hues. The fabrics include merino wool, pure silk satin, georgette, organza, crepe and nylon tulle.

 Elegance and sophistication define the whole range of western wear that includes jackets, skirts, corsets, dresses, scarves and gowns.

 The skirts include hand-woven silk ones in white with some intricate zardosi work. Flowing skirts with detailing on the waist come in sober combinations of olives and maroons. The line also features crushed cocktail dresses with innovative texturing and a semi-formal halter neck outfit in muted blue, embellished with intricate arri work.

 The show stealer is the line of jackets with capsule detailing and the ones with interwoven textures of silk, organza and tussars. Also on offer are tops in turquoise, black and earthy shades. The saris come in satins, georgettes and crepes.

 The d line is all about overcoming the barriers of time. We want our clothes to have timeless charm and splendour, smiles Dev.

 Prices start at Rs 1,000.

 Retro rhythm

 Night life in the satellite township is fast catching up with city as Heka, the lounge bar at The Stadel, plays host to Live Retro Nite, a Wednesday evening musical bash, till September 28.

 After slogging the whole day through, this could be the ideal destination for executives to enjoy good music, a few drinks and some great food, claims Anil Bhutoria, director of Stadel. 

 Rudraa promises to take rock lovers down memory lane with covers from Dire Straits, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Deep Purple and Sting. The seven-member band specialising in retro rock has Rijita and Sunny on the vocals, Subho and Sandip on the guitars, Jay the drummer, Amit the bassist and Mahua providing the additional vocals.

 Popular songs played out by the band included Roadhouse Blues, Lover of Mine, Sympathy for the Devil, Highway to Hell and Message in a Bottle, while the originals were named Tears and All in a Dream.

 As audiences enjoyed the cocktails and free test tube shots, beverage guru Irfan Ahmed, in keeping with the party spirit, belted out a number himself.

 Also featuring in the fest is the theme-based fusion food conceptualised by chef Narayan Chatterjee. 

 The vegetarian platter includes delights like Onion Ring Diana (specially marinated onion ring crumb fried and served with chefs special tangy sauce) and Stuffed and Fried Jillapinos (stuffed with cottage cheese, rolled in sliced bread and deep fried). 

 Foodies can enjoy non-vegetarian favourites like Fish in Basket (made from mashed potato filled with a special preparation of fish) and Forced Chicken Kachia Tera (chicken leg stuffed with forced unit cooked in glage).

 The designers have been chosen from a pool showcasing their designs here at the fashion shows that have been hosted in the past few months. The 12 finalists are competing for the title. The winner will be given a scholarship with loads of other opportunities, says Saikat Sarkar, general manager of the Park Street address that bears the name of Team India skipper and Behala boy Sourav Ganguly.

 The fierce competition saw Sudatta Bhattacharya emerge winner of the first leg, but the judges had words of encouragement for all the contestants.

 There can be only one winner but the others should not lose heart. The decision should make them improve on their designs and make them more creative, said Deboleena.

 The contribution of Souravs: The Food Pavilion to the fashion circuit in the city also did not go unnoticed in the countdown to the talent hunt.

 To have such a contest at Souravs should really encourage others to do something on the same lines, said model Sheena Chauhan.

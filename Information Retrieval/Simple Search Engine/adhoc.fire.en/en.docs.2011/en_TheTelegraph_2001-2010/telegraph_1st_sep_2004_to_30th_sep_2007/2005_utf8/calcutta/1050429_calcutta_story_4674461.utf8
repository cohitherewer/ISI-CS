 Tortured father takes life

 - Suicide note by 64-year-old seeks safeguard law

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?Chhele-boumar haate attyacharito hoye aami atmahatya korte baddhya holam (Tortured by my son and daughter-in-law, I am forced to take my life)?. 

 Words of anguish that poured out of Ranjit Chakraborty?s pen minutes before the 64-year-old hanged himself early on Thursday.

 His suicide note went beyond his personal pain and called for a safety net for unlikely victims like him. ?If a housewife is tortured by her husband or in-laws, there is Section 498A in the IPC to save her. But what law is there if a father-in-law is tortured by his son and daughter-in-law?? demanded the resident of Pitambar Ghatak Lane, under Alipore police station.

 ?If there is no law, it is better to frame one to punish the offender,? he wrote. Hours after Chakraborty killed himself, wife Anjali lodged a written complaint with Alipore police station, leading to the arrest of his alleged tormentors.

 ?We have picked up the accused couple, son Partha, 32, and daughter-in-law Litu, 30. They have been booked on charges of abetment to suicide,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 According to police, Chakraborty?s body was found by Anjali hanging in the bathroom around 5.30 am. ?One end of a rope was tied to the shower and another around his neck. When Anjali cried out, Partha, Litu and some neighbours rushed in. Chakraborty was taken to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, where doctors declared him dead,? said Sharma.

 ?Chakraborty and his wife lived on the first floor, while his son and daughter-in-law occupied the ground floor,? said N.D. Pal, officer-in-charge of Alipore police station.

 On going through the suicide note, police detained Partha, an employee of a private firm, and Litu. ?Residents of locality also confirmed that the couple would ill-treat Chakraborty and his wife. Then, of course, the victim?s wife came forward and lodged a formal complaint,? said Pal.

 Police said possession of the house could have been central to the trouble at the Chakraborty home.

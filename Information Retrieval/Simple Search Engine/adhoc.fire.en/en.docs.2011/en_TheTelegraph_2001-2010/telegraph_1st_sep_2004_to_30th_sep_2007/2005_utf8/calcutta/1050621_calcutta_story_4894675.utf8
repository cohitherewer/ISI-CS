 Snag in campus parleys

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The meeting between the five-member inquiry team of Jadavpur University (JU) and faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) on Monday failed to work out a solution to the two-month-long stalemate on the campus. 

 This followed JU?s refusal to allow students of the arts and science departments to remain present at Monday?s discussions between Fetsu leaders and the inquiry team.

 Monday?s meeting could not be held as Fetsu demanded that students from the science and arts departments be permitted to attend the talks.

 The authorities refused to concede this on the plea that the inquiry team had already held three discussion sessions with Fetsu during the past week, during which they had not raised such a demand.

 ?We are ready to meet students, no matter which faculty they belong to. But we need to go by the official procedure,? said Manoj Mitra, dean of engineering and technology department and chairman of the five-member committee. 

 ?When the committee was set up, the students had agreed to the university?s proposal that only Fetsu leaders and their representatives in the university?s court and executive council would attend the discussion sessions with the inquiry committee,? the dean pointed out.

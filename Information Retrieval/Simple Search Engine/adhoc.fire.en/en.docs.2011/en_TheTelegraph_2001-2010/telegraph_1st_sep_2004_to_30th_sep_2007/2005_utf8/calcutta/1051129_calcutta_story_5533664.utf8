 Skilled tips to get stage smart

The King and I is set in Siam of 1862. It is the story 

of how Anna Leonowens goes about educating the children of the ruler and in the 

process endears herself to all in the royal family. Initially the king finds Anna?s 

western customs a trifle annoying, but soon realises the great deal of good she 

has done to his children. Students of Calcutta Girls? High School rehearse for

 Apeejay School recently invited Saoli Mitra to conduct a theatre workshop with its students. After an enthralling skit by Rijita Chatterjee of Class XII, titled Nesha (an addiction), and recitations by Heeya Datta of Class IV and Arijit Roy of Class XI, the interaction with the theatre personality began.

Organised by the school?s Bengali department, the event saw the students putting forth interesting questions on Mitra and her calling. Here are excerpts from the chat:

What inspired you to take to theatre?

 I always had the urge to try on the vibrant attires worn by actors on stage. Eventually, this curiosity developed into an obsession and I decided to venture into theatre.

Tell us about your first stage experience.

 My first performance was that of a child who had to witness a suicide attempt by her mother. But I got so scared onstage that I genuinely began to whimper.

Did your parents, theatre stalwarts Tripti and 

Sambhu Mitra, inspire you?

 My parents never compelled me to choose theatre as my profession. But their support was the key to my success.

What kind of character do you prefer to enact?

 I have no hesitation in performing anomalous roles as we theatre artistes have to be versatile. But I am more inclined towards roles that uphold the Indian women folk. Women in our society never get the respect and importance due to them.

Rights roster

 With the International Human Rights Day drawing near, the Loreto College Alumnae Association tried to spread awareness on the issue through a daylong programme on November 26 on the college campus.

 Dance-drama Maiyyat, staged by Rangakarmee study group and directed by Usha Ganguli, was a skillful evocation of a feudal society ridden with the caste system.

 The second half of the day was reserved for a panel discussion at the college auditorium on ?Human Rights and the Indian Penal Code?.

 After the last speaker for the afternoon, Prof Sujato Bhadro, wrapped up, a short but stimulating question-answer round followed.

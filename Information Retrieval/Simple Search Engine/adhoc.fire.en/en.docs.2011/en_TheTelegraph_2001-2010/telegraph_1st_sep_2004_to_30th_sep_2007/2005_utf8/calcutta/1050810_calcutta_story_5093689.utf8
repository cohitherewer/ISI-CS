 Banning entry of outsiders to campuses might help to solve the law and order problems in colleges. Outsiders sometimes incite students to take in unbecoming activities that cause a lot of problems for the authorities. Therefore, entry of outsiders to colleges should not be allowed without specific orders.

 Indranil Sengupta, 

 Salt Lake

 Banning outsiders from colleges will certainly improve law and order on campuses. But it will not solve the problem totally. It is extremely important for both the students and the administrators to maintain decorum on campus.

Moumita Nandi, 

 Behala

 The responsibility of maintaining law and order on campus lies with the students, teachers and even the non-teaching staff. Recent incidents of student molestation on campuses certainly seem to indicate that the problem can be solved, at least to some extent, by banning the entry of outsiders. In order to implement the ban, the college authorities need to put in place proper security measures. The guardians could be provided with photographed identity cards for more effective policing of the campuses.

Satyanarayan Das, 

 Metiabruz

 Outsiders should be prevented from entering campuses. They have no right to be in the colleges without prior permission from the heads of the institutions. Many shameful incidents have taken place in colleges due to lack of restriction on entry of outsiders. It?s high time that the safety shield is bolstered.

 Vinay Dokania, 

 Shibpur

 Keeping campuses open to outsiders is akin to making borders porous. Problems will inevitably result from such a move. The recent incidents at Presidency College and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee College should be eye-openers for the authorities. Quite often, outsiders indulge in nuisance on the campus, but the blame falls on the students. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane 

 Preventing outsiders from entering campuses is not a foolproof solution to the law and order problems in colleges. Agitating students and staff also disrupt normal activities on campus. Breach of law and order on the campus can also result from personal disputes among students. Having said that, it would be worthwhile not to allow people to saunter into campuses. Students and staff have to play an active role in implementing such a proscription.

 Basudeb Bhattacharya, 

 Salt Lake

 How can outsiders be banned from colleges? Teachers and students from other colleges, parents of the students and people supplying various goods to a college might need to enter it for legitimate purposes. It is preposterous to think of banning the entry of outsiders to campuses when people can walk into important government offices without even an entry pass. Instead, a proctorial board could be constituted in every college, which will have the authority to issue entry passes. Members of the board can conduct surprise checks of the passes/identity cards. The college entrances also need to be manned properly.

 Supriyo Chakraborty,

 Every college needs to enforce its rules and regulations, but it is undesirable to have policemen guarding a college campus. Such a move would take away a lot of enjoyment from college life. 

 Nidhi Dokania,

 Address not given

 All colleges in Calcutta allow entry without any identity check and that is the prime reason behind unwanted incidents on campuses. Intruders who loiter in the college canteens and spend whole days in adda on the campus are a nuisance. Allowing strangers to enter is inviting more trouble. I firmly believe that law and order problems can be solved by preventing outsiders from entering college premises. We must not forget that colleges are not picnic spots but places where education is imparted. 

 Sayan Banerjee,

 Belgachhia Road

 Entry of outsiders into college campuses without permission from the authorities should not be allowed. What business can outsiders have on college campuses? Banning entry of outsiders into colleges is surely one of the steps that should be taken to solve the law and order problems on campuses. 

 Biswajit Guha Roy,

 Haldia 

 Law and order on a college campus depends on how strict the authorities are and to what extent the students adhere to the rules. Problems on college campus are mostly caused by its different student unions.

 Joydeep Chatterjee, 

 Shyambazar

 Colleges are for the students and the staff members. They should not be open to trespassers. Entry into campuses without permission from the authorities should be strictly prohibited. The state government should ensure that all colleges implement the ban.

 Tanima Dey,

 Habra

 I don?t think banning entry of outsiders to colleges can solve the law and order problems on campuses. The students themselves can also create problems. We all know of the ragging menace. It is caused by senior students, and not outsiders. Therefore, putting the blame only on visitors is foolish. However, this does not mean that free entry of outsiders should continue. The ban needs to be combined with effective internal policing.

 Payel Bhattacharyya,

 Diamond Harbour Road

 A ban on the entry of outsiders to campuses would certainly help in solving the law and order problems in colleges. The security of the students, especially girl students, is hampered by intruders. In fact, people loitering on the campus reflect badly on the reputation of colleges. The teachers and students also have a vital role to play in maintaining discipline on college campuses.

 Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan

 Outsiders cannot create law and order problems in colleges, unless they are aided by the people inside. Several long-drawn disputes between college managements and students are testament to the fact that the latter can also be a source of campus disturbance. At the same time, unsolicited entry into colleges amounts to trespassing and such cases should be dealt with sternly. There are college campuses in the city that turn haven for criminals after dusk. Proper vigil on campus at all times is a must.

 Poushali Chakraborty,

 Sodepur

 By banning the entry of outsiders to colleges, the law and order problems could be solved to a certain extent. The students should also remain vigilant as the campus is meant for them. They should be as persistent as the authorities in maintaining a healthy environment.

 Sounak Chakraborty,

 Baranagar

 Only a ban on the entry of outsiders to colleges cannot solve the law and order problems on campuses. Students themselves can preempt the problems by not bringing friends from outside to their colleges. Stringent rules and cooperation by the students can root out the problem. The authorities should employ private agencies to check identity cards and papers of those seeking entry into campuses. Ideally, the office should be located in a separate building. 

 Debasree Mukherjee,

 Salt Lake

 College campuses are increasingly becoming unsafe for girls in most cities and Calcutta is no exception. The authorities should ban the entry of outsiders to protect students from unnecessary harassment.

Sushma Jalan,

 Alipore

 Campuses of schools and colleges should certainly be out of bounds for trespassers. There has recently been a rise in indecent behaviour towards female students in colleges. It is the responsibility of the college authorities to protect the dignity of students. All students and staff members should be provided with identity cards and a strict vigil should be maintained to keep out others. The college office should be built in such a way that the visitors there cannot proceed to the classrooms.

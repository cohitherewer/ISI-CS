 Locker theft discovered

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Former assistant commissioner of police Sujit Mohan Chaudhury has lodged a complaint with Hastings police alleging that valuables, including ornaments, have been stolen from his bank locker. 

 According to police, he discovered the theft on June 30 when he opened the locker. 

 The official complaint with Hastings police was lodged the next day, when Chaudhury claimed two gold necklaces, two bangles, documents, a few medals he had won in school and college, and an Omega wristwatch were missing.

 Chaudhury met city detective chief Gyanwant Singh on June 2 and after preliminary investigations, the anti-fraud department of the detective department was handed over the investigation of the case. 

 This is the second incident in recent times of a bank locker being tampered with in the city. The last such ?tampering? took place at Tollygunge about seven months ago, when a woman opened her bank locker to discover that her ornaments were missing. 

 ?The officer had met me and informed about the incident. Since a list of the items is not available and we have no details, we could not evaluate the lost items. Anyway, officers are on the job,? Singh said.

 According to a senior officer of Hastings police station, Chaudhury had turned up at the bank in the morning with his wife, and after a brief exchange with a senior bank official, decided to have a look at his locker. On opening the locker, he only found some of paper inside. The valuables were all missing. 

 After informing the bank officers about the loss, Chaudhury reportedly returned home to check if anyone else had opened the locker unbeknown to him. 

 When he ascertained that no one else had done so recently, he returned to the police station the next day and lodged a complaint. He and his wife hold a joint account. 

 Hastings police station claimed that the bank had informed it that the locker was last opened in 1996. Since then, the keys have been with the Chaudhurys.

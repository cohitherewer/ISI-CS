 Tuck in

 The city has come up with a rejoinder to Jamai Sashthi meant for daughters-in-law, and in what has become an annual tradition, Trincas hosted a special luncheon on Saturday, June 25, dubbed Boumashtami.

 Ashtami is an auspicious day. It celebrates the victory of Durga over Mahisashura. She is the symbol of shakti and so are todays women, who manage both personal and professional fronts so well. Hence the name Boumashtami, explained Sashi Puri of Trincas. The Park Street restaurant served up a buffet at Rs 200 for the occasion.

 Sharbari Dutta, Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta, Chaiti Ghoshal, Nilanjana Chakraborty, Urmimala Basu and Jagannath Basu and Madhumanti Maitra were among those present to enjoy the music, food and adda session.

 Manchagane Narikatha, a compilation of Bengali theatre songs on women from the late 19th to the late 20th century by Devajit and Riddhi Bandyopadhay set the mood, and some of the guests even stepped on to the dance floor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Ghetto queen

She had a fight with her mother about wearing glasses, and it was all over the Internet gossip sites. She found a man and it was all over the news channels, particularly when the 24-year-old made no bones about the fact that she?d kick ass if anyone messed with him. So who is she? Jessica Alba, star of Sin City and Fantastic Four (releasing this Friday at Globe and the multiplexes), and currently one of Hollywood?s hottest babes.

 The downside of being a sexy siren with a shapely body and a face that turns heads is that the roles coming her way are generally the kind pushed by the testosterone factor. But oodles of attitude and a no-nonsense personality keep her feet firmly on the ground.

 Rumour has it that Tom Cruise wanted to ?audition? the dark beauty as his celebrity girlfriend before he found Katie Holmes. In fact, her comments on the pair have also made headlines, with her characteristic intolerant contempt for their very public love affair and the statement that she doesn?t date stars to get ahead in her career. 

 You might have spotted the actress in the short-lived James Cameron television series Dark Angel, broadcast on STAR World for a while. Soon, you can catch her on the big screen as Sue Storm, the female hero in the action film Fantastic Four.

 But the girl born of a Mexican father and French-Danish mother has been criticised by comic-book fans for being cast in the role of the blonde and fair character of the Invisible Girl. She?s not too bothered, though, confident of her acting skills (but she did dye her hair blonde for the role).

 A tough childhood, she says, taught her all the lessons in life she needed to learn. Parents Mark and Cathy Alba were married as teenagers, with kids by the time they were 20 and 21. Both worked two jobs each to support the family. 

 Jessica started working at 12, as a regular on the American TV show The New Adventures of Flipper. When she met director Cameron at 17, she proclaimed she was right for the role in Dark Angel. In most of her films so far, she has bared more skin than showcased acting talent. But the girl from Beverly Hills is working to change that.

 Counting in her favour is her attitude. Case in point: ?If anyone messed with him, I?d want to cut them. That?s the ghettos side of me? ? about boyfriend Cash Warren, assistant director of Fantastic Four.

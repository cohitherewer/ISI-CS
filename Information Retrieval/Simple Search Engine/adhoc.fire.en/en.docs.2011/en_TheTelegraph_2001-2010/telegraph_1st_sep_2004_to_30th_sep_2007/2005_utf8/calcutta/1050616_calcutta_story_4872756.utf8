 Bollywood booty seized

 - Brother-sister duo stole diamonds, cash from producer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Mumbai police team conducted an extensive raid early on Wednesday at Mathurapur, on the southern fringes of the city, and seized jewellery worth Rs 35 lakh and Rs 30,000 in cash, stolen from the bungalow of a Mumbai film producer. 

 Daud Ali Sardar, landlord of the house where the alleged culprits ? a woman and her brother ? lived was arrested, though police failed to track down the duo who had robbed the producer five days ago.

 After searching the house with the assistance of local police, Mumbai police seized the diamond jewellery, cash and six mobile phones. ?The sister-brother duo stole all these articles from the producer?s house. The accused managed to flee minutes before the police team reached there,? said A.K. Prasad, additional superintendent of police (rural), South 24-Parganas.

 Aklima Bibi and her brother Maqsood are both residents of Purba Ranaghat, in Mathurapur. Maqsood had left for Mumbai a couple of months ago. ?Aklima was employed as a domestic help and Maqsood as a driver at the house of film producer Arpit Kautia at Jogeshwari, in western Mumbai,? said an officer of Mathurapur police station.

 Maqsood had told Kautia that he needed to go on leave for seven days and left Mumbai a week ago. ?His sister Aklima, too, sought leave and Kautia?s family granted it. She left Mumbai on June 9,? said a South 24-Parganas police officer.

 The robbery was detected the day after Aklima left Mumbai. ?The Kautias could not find diamond jewellery and cash in their almirahs. They lodged a complaint with Oshivara police station,? said the officer.

 ?The Kautia family told Mumbai police that the duo was from Mathurapur,? said an officer, adding: ?Before employing the duo, the Kautias had noted down their address and other basic information. This helped police to recover the articles.?

 A team from Oshivara police station reached the city a few days ago. ?Initially, they did not inform us. They went to Mathurapur and traced the rented house where the two lived,? said a Mathurapur police station source.

 The police team contacted senior officers of South 24-Parganas around midnight on Tuesday and sought help. A posse of 10 policemen was sent with them. They surrounded the house of Daud Ali Sardar around 3 am. The Mumbai officers broke open the door of Aklima?s room and found the jewellery and cash in a trunk.

 Hungama time for busy bee

 With three new releases in November, RIMII tells Pratim D. Gupta about her all-action agenda

 There?s something about Rimii. No wonder, she?s doing a Cameron ?Mary? Diaz in the Bollywood version of the Farrelly Brothers comic blockbuster Deewane Huye Paagal. And with the Vikram Bhatt film slotted for the last Friday of November, the Bengali babe is rewriting record books with three of her releases hitting the theatres in the same month ? Garam Masala and Kyon Ki? on November 2 and Deewane Huye Paagal on November 25.

 ?You can?t plan the releases deliberately,? protests Rimii, having dropped the Sen from her name because of the plethora of Sens in the film industry (Sushmita, Riya, Raima, Reema). ?My last film was Dhoom which was a year back and after that I have just signed the films which I have felt are worth doing. It?s a co-incidence that they are all releasing back-to-back.?

 Both Kyon Ki? and Garam Masala have been directed by Priyadarshan, who gave Rimii her first real break in the crazy comedy Hungama. While Garam Masala has her doing a surprise cameo as Akshay Kumar?s fiancee, Kyon Ki? has Rimii in a full-fledged role despite the presence of Kareena Kapoor. 

 ?Right from the start I knew that there was another heroine in the film and I just had a 30-minute role but I still went ahead,? explains Rimii. ?Once you watch the film, you?ll realise why I agreed to do the movie. Kyon Ki? is an emotional drama where everyone?s got a very defined character. Although I didn?t have any scene with Kareena, she was very easy to get along with.?

 Even better was the chemistry between Rimii and the film?s leading man Salman Khan. ?Or shathe kaaj kore khub bhalo laglo?,? she says with a fluency that would do the other Sens proud. ?Despite being such a huge star, he has no tantrums whatsoever. In fact, he made me feel very comfortable by being his bindaas self on the sets.?

 But the real fun happened on the sets of Deewane Huye Paagal which was shot mostly in Dubai. ?Shob kota chhele ? Akshay Kumar, Shahid Kapur, Suniel Shetty ? aamar pechhone daurochhe?? she laughs. ?The film?s got a very funny script and it was lovely to work with such talented people.?

 There?s more comedy for the girl, who shot to fame with one of Aamir Khan?s Coca Cola commercials, once Deewane... releases. ?I am shooting for Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to Hera Pheri,? she says. ?I am opposite Akshay while Bipasha Basu is cast opposite Suniel. Bipasha and I have a great time on the sets and we only talk in Bengali.?

 The packed line-up for the demure damsel doesn?t end there. She?s also signed Sriram Ek Hasina Thi Raghavan?s new film opposite Neel, grandson of singing great Mukesh. And then there?s the Ajay Devgan-starrer Golmaal. 

 But surprisingly Rimii is missing from the Dhoom 2 cast, despite her sexy Shikdum jig in pink nothings creating a rage in the original. ?I have no regrets in not being in the sequel,? Rimii points out. ?I guess my character is not required and I can?t do anything about that.?

 She also cannot do anything about her only Bengali film, Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Swapner Din, not releasing yet. ?Bollywood has always presented me very glamorously and here I was presented in a very realistic way. And that is what made me sign the movie in the first place. But now I don?t have time for Bengali films... I can hardly cope up with my Hindi assignments.?

 Phew!

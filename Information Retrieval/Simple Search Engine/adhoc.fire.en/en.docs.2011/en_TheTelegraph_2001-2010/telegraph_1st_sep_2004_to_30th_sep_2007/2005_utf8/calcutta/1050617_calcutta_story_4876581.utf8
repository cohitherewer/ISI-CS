 English tips and tools

 A STAFF REPORTER

 English is an international language owned by everyone, feels the US-based non-profit educational organisation. And to equip Calcuttans with the tools to communicate more effectively around the world, TEFL International has launched its Indian operations.

 The organisation provides English programmes for children, teenagers and adults on English conversation, business English, corporate English and many more.

 Besides these long-term programmes, TEFL also provides short-term courses, like intensive summer camps for children and preparatory work for university entrance exams.

 In Calcutta, TEFL has already set up three pre-schools at Garia, Phoolbagan and Southern Avenue. Two language schools at Salt Lake and Hindustan Park are scheduled to become operational by July. 

 ?The Queen?s English is not the real English and neither is American English,? says Bruce Veldhuisen, the founder of TEFL. ?It?s rather the international language that is spoken by people around the world.?

 Sanjib Chakraborty, general manager, Asia Pacific, TEFL International, said: ?We plan to open 20 pre-schools and 20 language schools in West Bengal by the year-end, of which 15 pre-schools and five language schools will be in Calcutta. There will also be two teacher-training schools set up in the city at the same time.?

 Besides West Bengal, the organisation has set up pre-schools in Bhubaneswar, and teacher?s training schools in Delhi, Dehra Dun and Chandigarh. Around the world, TEFL has over 100 language schools and pre-schools.

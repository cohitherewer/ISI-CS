 Workshop and tips for projects

 A student demonstrates a model at BITM. Pictures

 Ananda Sur: The museum once had a special section to help students who used to work on scientific projects as a hobby. Do you still run that section?

 The section is still there and we have increased its scope, so that more students can take up scientific modelling as a hobby. If a student wants technical help from us to design a model, we offer our expertise free of cost. Students can use our sophisticated workshop and benefit from skilled professionals who are there to guide them.

 To avail of such assistance, one has to apply to the education officer or the director of the institute and provide a detailed outline of the model. We provide assistance after considering the application.

 We have also started a summer camp for science enthusiasts, especially secondary-level students. The camps are organised during vacations, allowing students to interact with us over experiments they had read about in textbooks.

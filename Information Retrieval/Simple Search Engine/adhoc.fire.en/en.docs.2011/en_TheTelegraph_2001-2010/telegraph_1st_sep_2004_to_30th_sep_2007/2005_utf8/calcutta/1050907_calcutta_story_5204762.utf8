The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Living (in) for the moment

 Saif Ali Khan with Preity Zinta in moments from Salaam Namaste 

 Chaotic, erratic, unpredictable ? the new Saif Ali Khan seems straight out of an Oliver Stone movie. You just can?t guess what?s happening in the man?s head. Striding in with girlfriend Rosa to the Ramji Londonwaley premiere at Fame Adlabs, he opted for No Entry! Setting up a media meet on a certain Monday, he landed up on the Goa beaches, instead. You are not surprised then, when you hear Shah Rukh Khan publicly asking him at the IIFA Awards in Amsterdam: ?Arrey Saif, kabhi phone to kar liya kar?.

 But when it comes to his on-screen image, the actor is putting in a lot of effort and a whole lot of thought. Determined to break his featherweight image after Dil Chahta Hai and Kal Ho Naa Ho, and to some extent Hum Tum (ya, ya he did win the National Award for that Harry Met Sally rehash), he did a Parineeta, even exchanging his role of Girish with Shekhar. 

 And now, before you can label him a period-piece guy, he?s back with his oh-so-cool avatar in Salaam Namaste. What?s more, he?s turned down the role of Bhootnath in the Pritish Nandy-produced Saheb Biwi Aur Ghulam. After all, he?s already said ?yes? to Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Yagna, now called Eklavya. And another purana film is asking for too much for the man hailed as the metrosexual face of Bollywood.

 But doesn?t he look a tad too masculine in Salaam Namaste considering a metrosexual man is supposed to cry and use moisturisers? Saif retorts with a roaring round of laughter: ?The images are always given by the stylist,? he finally answers. ?It?s not me who is there in the film, it?s my character. I had to be like this for this character because it is based in Melbourne, which is a very sporty city.?

 And does the actor in him change when he takes on something so light like Salaam Namaste compared to the more methodical and ?maddening? project like Parineeta? ?Acting is my profession,? pat comes the reply. ?So, I am comfortable doing whatever it needs me to do for my film. Salaam Namaste has me in a fun-loving, very realistic role. I play Nikhil Arora, who hails from Punjab and is the kind of guy today?s youth will easily identify with ? very independent, one who has his own mind.?

 Doesn?t that sound very Saif? The man?s just moved into a new flat in Shastri Nagar behind Fame Adlabs in Andheri with Rosa. So it was kind of a Salaam Namaste d?j? vu. ?I do believe in the theme of the movie (of living together outside marriage),? he admits. ?Our society is changing. There are so many college kids living together to save rent. There are people who want to be sure about the relationship before committing to marriage. The Indian multiplex audience is now the most forward. So the film only reflects what?s happening in our society.?

 Salaam Namaste, which releases this Friday, also has Saif re-uniting with his Kal Ho Naa Ho co-star Preity Zinta, a relationship which goes beyond the sets. ?She is fabulous,? says Saif. ?She has tremendous energy and is very talented. And because she is a very good friend, we always have lots of fun shooting together.?

 Quietly creeping into the big Khan league with back-to-back hits, Saif doesn?t mind working with fresh blood, though. ?I am very comfortable with new directors,? he says. ?Siddharth Anand (director of Salaam Namaste) is enthusiastic, has fresh ideas and is ready to work harder and harder. It was fun working with him. Even Parineeta was Pradeepda?s (Sarkar) first film. He too was a bundle of energy and was already very experienced as an ad film-maker.?

 Heartening for Saif is the fact that the adulation and accolades for his performances have not only come from the audiences but from his very own family. And the admiration is mutual. ?Oh I really loved Mom in Viruddh,? he gushes. ?She is gorgeous in the film. I would love to be cast with her. Let?s see if something really good comes for both of us together.?

 All set for another hit, Saif knows he?s on a winning streak and should make most of the sunshine phase before another dry patch hits him. ?I am working hard and by God?s grace, it is all paying off,? is the Saif secret.

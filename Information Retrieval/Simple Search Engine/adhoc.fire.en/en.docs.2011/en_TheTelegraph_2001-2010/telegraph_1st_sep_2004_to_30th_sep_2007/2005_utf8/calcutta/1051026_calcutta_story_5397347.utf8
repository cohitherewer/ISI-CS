 Art and society

 Just as the progress of society and civilisation depends upon the inclination, attitude and opinion of its people as a whole, likewise art needs the support of peoples collective, positive response to survive and grow. Though an individual may play the leading role, inspiring others to follow his ideal, no effort can bear fruit unless the consciousness of the mass is truly attuned to the common goal. Hence, to enlarge its scope and be an instrument of social progress, theatre also needs acceptance by every member of society. Produced by Barasat Anushilanee, Ek Rasik Doubarik shows how this fundamental condition fails to be achieved in reality. In the play, a collective commitment to preserve and promote good art remains elusive owing to the egotistical nature of one man. Finally, however, group sentiment prevails over celebrity pride, and the strength of art motivates the group to find one amongst their own who will lead them towards the fulfilment of their cause. Written and directed by Romaprasad Banik.

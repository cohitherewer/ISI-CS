The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Clubs alive to Christmas call

A club carnival ushered in Christmas as Calcutta partied 

through 24th night. From RCGC to Tolly, CC amp;FC to Saturday, song and dance, 

sip and bite ruled as thousands invaded the club grounds.

With Calcutta willing to shell out up to a thousand 

for a guest pass just to enter the club gates and then cough up quite a bit for 

F amp;B, it was clear that wishing friends and family Merry Christmas 

on a club green at midnight made it well worth it.

The only grumble: no nip in the air, with the minimum 

temperature stuck at 16.6 ?C.

 GoodLife brings you a glimpse of the action 

that mattered.

 Tollygunge Club 

RCGC

CC amp;FC

Saturday Club

What: Xmas Eve at Tollygunge Club presented 

by McDowells Signature and The Telegraph.

When: 8.30 pm onwards.

Song and dance: DJ A-Myth and Shiva, with Rila 

Banerjee Brien in the spotlight, took turns to rock the crowds with numbers 

old and new, from Roadhouse blues to Dhoom to Right here right 

now. Also, a generous dose of club Bhangra mixes and commercial house. With 

almost no place to move on the makeshift floor, the adjoining green was soon converted 

into an extended dancing ground.

Style statements: Short skirts or tiny dresses 

in black was the standard uniform for women. The men dressed up their suits in 

style, with polka shirts, bright ties and Santa caps (some with battery-operated 

lights).

Sip and bite: Finger food, kebabs, Chinese 

choices and, of course, a very busy bar.

When: 8 pm onwards.

Song and dance: DJ Vicky kept the crowd going 

strong on the dance floor with one peppy number after another. Also in performance 

was dancer Harshada from Mumbai who enthralled the audience with her Deedar 

de act. Prizes went out to the best couple on the dance floor. The Bollywood 

beat dominated and the theme of the nite could well have been Kajra re.

The ambience: Romantic, with floating candles 

and flowers dotting each table.

Sip and bite: An assortment, with food fare 

from the tandoor and the wok. Plus, an overcrowded bar.

What: Xmas Eve at CC amp;FC presented by McDowells 

Signature and The Telegraph.

When: 8 pm onwards.

Song and dance: Skinny Alley kept the crowd 

dancing to numbers like Mysterious girl, Shes got the look and My 

heart goes shala la la before Gary Lawyer bowled em over with Jim Morrison 

and Elvis Presley favourites. Later, it was DJ Moses who kept the dance floor 

busy.

Sip and bite: An assortment of Indian and Chinese 

delights and a wide variety of drinks.

The ambience: Warm and cheerful, with a Christmas 

tree greeting guests and vibrant Santas and snowmen adding colour to the floor.

The crowd: A mixed bag of youngsters and senior 

citizens, all there to have a blast.

What: Xmas Eve at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, 

presented by Royal Challenge and The Telegraph.

 When: 9.30 pm onwards.

Song and dance: First up, the leggy local girl 

VJ Archana, who paired up with DJ Girish of Shisha. Up next, crooner Mou Mukherjee 

who regaled the crowd with hit tracks, present and past. Kaate nahin kat te 

to Deedar de, Its the time to disco to Kajra re...

Hot shot: Finally, it was left to Vaishali, 

a dancer from Mumbai, to kill the chill. The seductress, in itsy-bitsy blue, swayed 

to tracks like Kajra re, Dus bahane and Dilli ki sardi. DJ 

Girish kept the floor crowded with his remixes.

Sip and bite: Kebab and Chicken Lollipop from 

The Astor went down well, as did the Breezers and the cocktails.

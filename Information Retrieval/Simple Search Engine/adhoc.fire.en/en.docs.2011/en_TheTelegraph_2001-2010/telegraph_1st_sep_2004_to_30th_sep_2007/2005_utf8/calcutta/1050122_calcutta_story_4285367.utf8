Screen 

diva Elizabeth Taylor may be among the few lucky women in the world who can boast 

of diamonds by the dozen, but you could well join the dazzling ranks, thanks to 

Vanshi coming to town. The diamond store has promised to start its price point 

at Rs 2,500 for a pendant. 

 The Indian company that retails mainly in the US and has two outlets in India (Surat and Delhi), opened its third outlet in the country in Calcutta on Friday evening. 

 ?Given the retail boom in Calcutta, this is the right time to open up here,? says director Dharmesh Vaghashia of the outlet on 227/2 AJC Bose Road, opposite Minto Park.

However, Vanshi has been making its presence in the 

city for two years now through the counters of leading jewellery stores. This 

is their first flagship store in Calcutta though. 

 ?The designs are chic and wearable unlike heavy sets that end up in the locker most of the time,? said actress June while inaugurating the store launch, flaunting a Vashi jade and diamond neckpiece all the time. 

 A vast collection of pendants, earrings, bracelets and sets at the cosy store promises to be a shopper?s delight. 

 Earrings are priced at Rs 3,000 onwards, while bracelets are priced at Rs 10,000 and above. And surprise, surprise, there are jewels for men as well! ?Ornamental watches for men, priced Rs 25,000 onwards, is a big hit across all our outlets,? says Dharmesh. 

 The brand offers a 90 per cent buy back scheme on all products. ?This allows customers flexibility if they wish to change their mind later,? feels Dharmesh. 

 Next Vanshi stop? Commercial capital of India, Mumbai.

 Skin deep

 If you fancy a spotless skin that is the stuff of television commercials, Marina Beauty Parlour at 33 Beckbagan Row promises to make your dream come true. It recently unveiled an Ultrasonic Skin Scrubber (USS) that works on a direct current, for deep skin care and regeneration of the skin to preserve its elasticity. It is said to be a painless means of removing acne marks, smoothening out wrinkles, removing dead skin and stimulating blood circulation.

 With the city?s pollution levels rising by the day, USS is a great way to get your skin back in shape. According to owner Marina Chang, ?Oily skin is a result of over-active sebaceous glands which shine excessively, break out large pores that form blackheads and acne. Since the skin scrubber is a super deep cleanser, it is very effective for removing these marks.? Apart from environmental pollution and smoking, poor eating habits also damage the skin. With the USS, Chang insists that all skin-related problems can be tackled over a few sittings. Each sitting bears a price tag of Rs 450.

 Season serve

 Bengali speciality restaurant Kewpie?s is celebrating Magh Utsab, till January 27. The menu has been revamped in keeping with the spirit of Sankranti, which includes a wide array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. While most of the usual menu has been retained, several special additions have been made for the season. 

 The Amish (non-vegetarian) platter, priced at Rs 365, has an enticing mix of three non-vegetarian and one vegetarian side dishes. The Mahabhoj Niramish (jumbo veg) platter with four vegetarian items is a steal at Rs 280, with the vast array of exotic Bengali dishes to choose from. 

 Apart from these, there is a Maacher Thala (fish platter) and Mangsher Thala (meat platter) that has been introduced as well. While the former comprises a choice of rui, bekti and chingri, the latter allows an option of fish fry and a choice of chicken or mutton. Chingri Paturi, Koi-er Kosha, Ilish Boneless Paturi and Duck Vindaloo are the non-vegetarian dishes to look out for. Vegetarian delicacies worth a special mention include Navratan Kalia, Phoolkopi-Murir Ghonto, Beguner Vindaloo and Enchor Kaalia. Special winter dishes include Tangra Pyajkoli, Gujralir Dom, Koi-er Kosha and Parshe Roast.

 The most attractive feature of the festival is a whole new snack menu in the Jalkhabar section. Gorge on Mochar Chop, Railway Cutlet, Chingri Kobiraji Cutlet, Moghlai Paratha, Kochuri and Ghoogni, Mutton Chop, to be washed down with Lalu?s Cha during those in-between times. ?I intend to serve these only in the evening, which is the right time for such items,? says Kewpie?s owner Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta. 

 Desserts include seasonal delicacies like Doodh Pooli, Patishapta, Puli Pithe, Gurer Payesh, Komla Kheer and Notun Gurer Sandesh.

 Ever heard of post-marital counselling from a professional match-maker? One new-age matrimonial service in the city is stepping beyond the wedding bash into the heart of relationships.

 Khushi, a matrimonial agency, starts by finding a suitable life partner, but it continues to play a part in the marriages it makes, going as far as to step in if problems arise.

 We want to make sure estranged couples who see no end to their troubled married lives get back together. So, we have set up a team of qualified experts to ascertain the root cause of the problem and offer lifetime solutions thereafter, said a spokesperson for Khushi.

 Another significant aspect of the service is counselling for youngsters who think they have already found their perfect mate. We help analyse the pros and cons of their relationship so they can better understand whether their choice is correct or not, added the spokesperson.

 The New Alipore firm has also set out with the aim to help the physically challenged find a partner.

 The basis of the suggested matches is analysis of personality compatibility. Experts judge the individual first and then the merits of a possible couple. Based upon the readings, solutions are offered on how to carry the relationship forward with the help of a Compatibility Assessment Quotient.

 The process is split into seven steps. First, upon registration, a complete analysis is made of the individual. Likes, dislikes, wants, desires, personality traits, temperament, dreams and ambitions are taken stock of, and used to pick out a suitable match.

 After a pair is put together, the kundlis are compared to adjudge astrological compatibility.

 The third step is an analysis of future possibilities. The youth of today who seem to easily fall in love and get married in haste can come to us with the details of the person they intend to marry and we can tell them whether the decision they are about to take would be beneficial or not, explained the spokesperson.

 The next step involves a detective network specialising in finding out crucial information, usually done to appease concerned parents.

 Medical tests are also undertaken to ensure neither applicant is carrying a transmittable disease.

 Once all the criteria is satisfied, the two families meet on common turf. 

 Finally, the marriage arrangements are made by Khushis marriage management enterprise. The wedding theme is conceptualised keeping in mind the tastes of the couple, their families and social status.

 Right from the engagement ceremony to the honeymoon itinerary, we ensure the perfect match also has the perfect wedding.

 Blisters, as body rejects the skin

 SUBHRO SAHA

 When Saiful Islam noticed a solitary water-filled lesion next to his nose, he wasn?t too concerned. But as the eruptions spread to other parts of the body, he had to seek medical help.

 ?I was in a lot of pain and discomfort. The blisters filled every inch of my body. But I realised the full impact of the disease only when my three-year-old daughter was so horrified, that she refused to come near me. It was a sinking feeling,? recounts Islam.

 Eruptions inside the mouth made it very difficult for him to eat anything solid and he wore a terrible look. Business took a beating and socialising was simply ruled out. Various forms of treatment were tried in his native Bangladesh for over four years, but the condition kept worsening. 

 He decided to seek medical advice across the border and landed up at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, on the EM Bypass.

 ?When he came to us, a dark-coloured fluid filled every part of his body, which burst at the slightest touch,? says Sachin Varma, consultant dermatologist at Apollo Gleneagles, who supervised the treatment. 

 He was diagnosed with Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV), confirmed by biopsy and immuno-florescent study. 

 PV is an auto-immune blistering disorder where the immune system of the body starts rejecting the whole skin. As a result of complex immunological interaction, the skin and mucous membranes suffer from burn-like lesions all over. 

 Some patients can live with the disease for years, while others die a slow, tortuous death, say doctors.

 In this condition, the body literally attacks itself, whereby suspect antibodies target a component of keratinocytes called PVA. ?An early diagnosis often spells the difference between life and death,? stresses Varma, adding that very often, PV lesions are commonly misdiagnosed as simple mouth sores.

 Gum tissue goes through cycles of tearing-healing-tearing-bleeding. An ulcerated sore can multiply rapidly and ravage the insides of the mouth, making it impossible for patients to tolerate solid food, affecting nutritional statistics severely.

 Islam was a serious case of PV and was immediately started on dexomethasone cyclophosphomide pulse therapy with a ?judicious combination? of corticosteroid and cytotoxic preparation. ?We started monthly therapy and the eruptions started to clear,? recollects Varma. Islam came for the last session in September and his lesions have completely cleared.

 The side-effects of steroids are also a constant consideration. ?However, with a multidisciplinary approach, we have successfully treated a handful of PV patients and we feel that with careful titration of the medication and pulse therapy, it is possible to give back a healthy skin to the patients,? the skin specialist declares.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All in the game

 He debuted on the national screen by hosting a game show for kids called Shaka Laka Boom Boom in 2002. Three years later, Calcutta boy Romit Raaj is all set to make his Bollywood debut with the first ever Hindi film revolving around a game show.

 Humdum, a film by Kushan Nandy (Pritish Nandy?s son) that sees Romit in the male lead opposite newcomer Anjana, tells the tale of two strangers who fall in love while participating in a game show. 

 ?The story of Humdum is quite unique. It is a fun love story that has all the ingredients of a family masala movie ? romance, comedy and action. It?s an ideal launch for me,? says Romit. While promos of the film have been on air for the past 15 days, it is scheduled to release next month.

 Sidhant De (Romit?s screen name) likes to chill out and watch triple X films, he wants money without having to slog for it. Things start going wrong in his lazy life and he suddenly needs to dish out a huge sum in a short time and hence decides to participate in a game show with a prize money of Rs 10 crore. 

 The only clause for winning is one can?t fall in love during the whole show. The game is divided into four rounds called Mujhse Dosti Karoge, Yeh Tera Ghar Yeh Mera Ghar, Hum Saath Saath Hain and Akele Hum Akele Tum. 

 ?The format of the film is very different. One would expect that a film on a game show would be shot totally indoors, but that?s not the case. We shot all over Mumbai and Goa and had great fun in the process,? says Romit.

 He started his acting career in Calcutta with a stint in the Bengali tele-serial Protibimbo about five years ago and was also a popular face in print and TV ads. But it was Bollywood that he had firmly set his sights on ?since the age of eight?. 

 ?I wanted to get a hang of facing the camera before I ventured into films. The work I did in Calcutta before moving to Mumbai in 2002 taught me the basics of the industry and has definitely helped me to bag this role,? he says. 

 While in Mumbai he started off with hosting Shaka Laka Boom Boom and also featured in a few ads. ?The producer and director of Humdum were looking for a fresh face and they spotted me in an HDFC ad. They called me for the film?s auditions and I was selected,? recalls the Calcutta lad. 

 While he is eagerly awaiting the release of Humdum, Romit at the same time is gearing up to shoot his next film, this too with Kushan Nandy. The yet-untitled film is a comic thriller with loads of action and is supposed to roll right after the release of Humdum.

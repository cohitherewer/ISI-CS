 Unfit to journey: The government has woken up to the cratered roads too late 

 Apropos ?Potholed path to Puja?, September 16, the condition of roads in many parts of Calcutta is appaling. But the road repair projects are slated to be taken up in all earnest only after the Puja, after the government releases the money it has promised. 

 The Calcutta Tramways Company is presently repairing the tram tracks as a contingency measure. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is also engaged in doing patchwork on an urgent basis. But they are unlikely to find the time to cover all of Calcutta. The net result: those wishing to pandal-hop will have to negotiate the hurdles on the roads. 

 The condition of the roads is likely to worsen as thousands of people and vehicles descend on them during the festival. Even the present miserable condition of the carriageways was not reached in a day or two. Why couldn?t the government take up and complete the repair work before the monsoon set in? 

 Money spent on patchwork hikes the total cost incurred for road repair. The people foot the bill but no one takes the responsibility for the waste of funds. If the repair work was carried out in a planned manner, people would have spent the monsoon and the festive days more comfortably. 

 On top of everything, it is quite shameful that the high court has to often prod the government into doing the work it should do of its own accord. The work would otherwise remain neglected. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Apropos ?Trip tips for agents?, September 9, curbs should be imposed on tour operators and travel agents not just for the benefit of the tourists, but also for the image of the state. The regulations should have been in place much earlier. Due to the absence of norms, many tourists have had to face severe difficulties away from home. 

 Tourists who have had to suffer due to malpractices by tour operators will prefer not to go on conducted tours again. Honest tour operators and travel agents will thus lose business. 

 With the boom in the travel and tourism industry, it is imperative to bring tour operators and travel agents under some administrative control. Registration and clearance certificate from the state tourism authority should be made mandatory to start a tourism business. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 It is essential for the government to address the long-standing grievances of travellers. Many agents engage unemployed youths as tour managers. They, in the middle of a tour, are in the habit of declaring that the money handed to them by their offices has been exhausted. They ask for a loan from the tour party, promising to repay it after returning to base. But the amount is seldom refunded and the companies deny their responsibility. 

 Ajit Kumar Das,

 Apropos ?Bid bye-bye to bridges?, September 12, the state government should do a rethink before dismantling the overbridges. These overbridges are under-utilised because the administration does not impose discipline on the road. If pedestrians frequent the overbridges, the number of lovebirds on them will consequently decrease. 

 However, if indeed, the overbridges are redundant, then the government should have considered the possibility before spending the taxpayers? money. 

 The logic that elderly people are averse to climbing the stairs is a piece of fiction. No one prefers risking his life to opting for a safer option. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, 

 Borehat, Burdwan. 

 Apropos ?Clicks don?t count for books?, September 13, there are sound reasons why price-conscious Calcuttans don?t buy books and music on the Net. No other metro has a homegrown College Street, where almost all the books on offer on the net are available at a greater discount. The same is true for music. Calcuttans find out about an album from the Net, take a look at it at the giant music stores and rush to Esplanade to get a bargain deal on it. 

 Tapan Pal,

 Batanagar. 

 Apropos ?Punitive action planned to realise unpaid property tax?, September 14, who will pay the tax for houses occupied by tenants? Also, more than half the tenants pay their rent to rent control. 

 R.K. Nandy, 

 Lenin Sarani. 

 Apropos ?Thaw sets in at film school?, September 14, it is unfortunate that the students of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute chose to go on strike on the very day Pather Panchali was released 50 years ago. 

 Prantik Sanyal,

 SP Mukherjee Road.

 Apropos ?Clashes close campus?, September 10, the trend of unrest in educational institutions is worrying. The incidents at Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University have painted a sorry picture of the education system in West Bengal. Teachers and students should sort out their problems through discussion. The students must not resort to violence. 

 Rajdeep Guha,

 Panchanantala Road. 

 It is a disheartening sign for higher education in West Bengal that a number of institutions are beset with student-related problems. After Jadavpur University, it is the turn of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, Bengal Engineering and Science University and West Bengal University of Technology to grapple with campus unrest. 

 All three institutes are relatively new, and their problems can perhaps be attributed to a communication gap between the administration and the students. 

 The higher education institutes fuel the economic development of a state. With West Bengal now trying to attract industries, problems at colleges and universities need to be addressed by the authorities at the earliest. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri, 

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane.

 Apropos ?A precious precinct?, September 10, the picture taken with the above mentioned article of one of our buildings at the club does not acknowledge the source. As you are aware, the RCTC Club House campus at Russell Street is a privately owned property. We should therefore be most obliged if you would kindly advise us as to the source of the photograph. 

 Boman Parakh,

 Secretary, Royal Calcutta Turf Club. 

 Metro replies: The photograph of the building in the Royal Calcutta Turf Club compound was obtained from a private source. We are not aware how this source came upon the photograph. We regret any inconvenience caused inadvertently by the publication of the photograph.

A lady devoted

 Saira Banu with Dilip Kumar at a film premiere 

 She is seldom seen without her husband by her side because the world outside hasn?t been able to lure her away from home. Post-retirement from celluloid, the sprightly Anglicised beauty of Padosan had buried herself in social work for years. Only when it started taking a toll on her health did Saira Banu branch out into TV production, on the advice of husband Dilip Kumar and mother Naseem Banu. It has been nine years since Sharp Focus came about and Saira Banu is now ready to produce a Bhojpuri film, preferring to supervise work from her Pali Hill address.

 ?There are times when your family needs you and you want to be there. I would not be happy not knowing what he (Dilipsaab) would have for breakfast? After 35 years of marriage, there?s a whole lot of companionship. You are dependent on each other,? says Saira Banu. The clear lilting voice has become somewhat rasping with age, but there?s no mistaking that gurgling laugh.

 ?Now, my husband and family are my priorities. My profession was precious to me when I used to do around five to six films a year. Then marriage came up. But I remember how sincere and disciplined we were then? You remember that swimming sequence in April Fool? I would wake up at 6 am and get into the cold water to train because I had to match up to the standards of the European girls who were with me. And then I would get ready by 10 am sharp,? says the actress who studied in London before moving to India at age 16. ?I did Junglee during my school holidays and then there was no looking back,? she laughs. 

 Saira Banu seems reluctant to destroy the image of youthful charm her audiences hold so dear. That?s one reason why she has brushed aside offers for so long, while several of her peers (from Waheeda Rehman to Tanuja and Sharmila Tagore) have returned for a second run on screen. 

 ?I am not interested in doing such roles. I am sure I would not like to do them. My fans and people who admire me remember me for Padosan, Shagird, Victoria? To bahut achha lagta hain?,? she says, and then adds after a pause: ?I would like to do a film like Shakti or Baghban. Did you know that Dilipsaab was supposed to do Baghban 15 years ago with BR Chopra??

 The Calcutta connection is still strong despite the decades that have passed. ?I belong to the Subodh Mukherjee school of films, you know?,? reminisces the actress who starred in Tapan Sinha?s Sagina Mahato.

 That was a very long time ago. Now, with Sharp Focus, Saira Banu has several plans. One of them is making a Hindi film before starting one on ?Saab?s scripts?. ?He has written some six scripts of which three or four are after my heart,? says the doting wife.

 Back in Mumbai, she is surrounded by a circle of old screen friends. ?Farida Jalal is a dear friend. I talk to Sadhana over phone some times and often drop into Nanda?s place where I also get to meet Waheedaji (Rehman)?? she trails off.

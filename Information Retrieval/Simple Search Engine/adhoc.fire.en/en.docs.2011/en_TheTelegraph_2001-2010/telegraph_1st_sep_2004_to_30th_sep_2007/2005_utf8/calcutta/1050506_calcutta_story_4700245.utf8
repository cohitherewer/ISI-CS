The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop tips for safety boost at library

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 The National Library managing committee has cleared a proposal to strengthen security on the premises with guidance from the police. The five-member panel met on the Alipore campus on Wednesday.

 Director Sudhendu Mandal said on Thursday that police would be urged to train the library guards in handling the sophisticated electronic equipment that will be installed to beef up security. 

 ?Senior police officers have already inspected Bhasha Bhavan and the main administrative building and taken note of the existing security arrangements,? he added.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee told Metro on Thursday that security at the National Library, Indian Museum and the Victoria Memorial was a big worry for the law-keepers. ?I have already visited the Memorial and asked my men to help the National Library authorities beef up their security,? he added.

 It is learnt that the recent theft of a Buddha head from the Indian Museum has spurred the city police to tighten vigil on important Central government establishments.

 National Library director Mandal said closed-circuit televisions and metal detectors would be installed at all entry points to Bhasha Bhavan, where valuable books and documents are being shifted from other library buildings. 

 Of the 42 sanctioned posts of securitymen, 13 have been lying vacant for months. ?The Centre had sanctioned a post of assistant security officer in October 2004. But the library authorities have not recruited anyone,? complained Saibal Chakraborty, secretary of the National Library Staff Association on Thursday.

 The director, however, claimed that the process to appoint an assistant security officer had been initiated.

 ?We have also engaged 50 private guards, all of whom are ex-servicemen, to guard Bhasha Bhavan round-the-clock. Our own guards are responsible for the security on the rest of the campus,? Mandal said. 

 As part of the beef-up, the authorities have imposed restrictions on morning-walkers. The morning-walkers will be issued identity cards, which they will have to produce before entering the 50-acre campus.

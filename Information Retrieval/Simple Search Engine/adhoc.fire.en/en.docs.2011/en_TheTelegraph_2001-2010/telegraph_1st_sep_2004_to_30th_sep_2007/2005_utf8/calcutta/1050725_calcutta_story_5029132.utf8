The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) should revamp its bus and tram depots at Esplanade. Passengers of Jangipara and Amtola-bound CTC buses suffer the most because of the potholes in a part of the depot which remain waterlogged during monsoon. CTC?s Esplanade depot area should given a get-up similar to the Millennium Park. The small parks adjoining CTC?s Maidan headquarters are also in bad shape. The open spaces have been reduced to garbage dumps. The railings separating the nearby tram tracks are broken and pavement dwellers have even constructed thatched shanties there.

 Budge Budge Natun Bazar post office is cramped for space. Pensioners are often forced to wait for hours like beggars, sitting in the narrow passageway for their payment. The post office should be shifted to a more spacious location.

 Many agreements need to be put down on non-judicial stamp papers worth Rs 10 or more. I learnt that these papers were in short supply in the city for quite some time now. Authorities should make them available at the earliest and ease the inconvenience caused to the general public.

 Prantik Sanyal,

 SP Mukherjee Road.

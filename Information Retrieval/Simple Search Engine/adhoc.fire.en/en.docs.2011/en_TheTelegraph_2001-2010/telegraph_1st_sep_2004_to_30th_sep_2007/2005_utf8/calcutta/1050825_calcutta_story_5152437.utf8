The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CalTel cries foul

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With services to high-profile addresses like the US consulate, the American Center and the British deputy high commission being hit, Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) has filed a police complaint alleging that micro-tunnelling work to lay cables by private players have damaged its optic-fibre cables, causing disruption.

 S.K. Bhaduri, general manager, customer relations, CalTel, said on Wednesday that though both Bharti and the Tatas have been contacted regarding damage to BSNL cables, there has been no response.

 ?The problem has increased in the past few weeks, with major customers being hit,? said Bhaduri. ?But they (the private players) are denying that any such work has been done at the sites of the damaged cables,? he added.

 CalTel is alleging that this is an attempt to malign its image and create discontent among customers.

 CalTel officials had also complained to the Salt Lake police station concerned when connectivity to Sector V was affected due to cables being cut.

 Ballygunge, Shakespeare Sarani, Hungerford Street, Tiretta Bazaar are some of the other areas where BSNL services have been affected.

 ?We have requested them (Bharti and the Tatas) to contact us before laying cables. This will enable us to take necessary precautions. But most of the work is done at night without any prior permission,? said a source in CalTel.

 In May, CalTel had claimed compensation of Rs 7.5 lakh for damages to cable at five sites from Tata Teleservices.

 Sources in the company said: ?Cable-laying work is done by third-party contractors. Since there is no map of the underground pipes and cables, the possibility of damaging an existing cable cannot be ruled out. But whenever there has been damage, we have negotiated the matter and compensated them.?

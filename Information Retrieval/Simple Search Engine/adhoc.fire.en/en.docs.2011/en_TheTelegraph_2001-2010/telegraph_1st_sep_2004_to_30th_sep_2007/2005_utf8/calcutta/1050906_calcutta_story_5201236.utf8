 Not just honeymoon couples and summer holidays, Calcuttans are now headed for the Alps even in winter. To cash in on this travel trend, Switzerland Tourism has come up with exciting offers for all those planning a Swiss holiday.

 Helping the travel plans take off is the interline understanding between Jet Airways and Indian Airlines. Now, all a Calcuttan has to do is go to Mumbai, before hopping on to a Swiss International Airline flight to Zurich and back for just Rs 31,000, a good Rs 7,000-8,000 cheaper than usual.

 ?For years, people had this notion that Switzerland was just a summer destination, but now things are changing and we are getting a lot of Calcuttans who are starting to travel to the various Alpine destinations in winter,? said Sarah Berry, accounts manager, Switzerland Tourism.

 A team from the country?s tourism board is here to promote places like Davos, Zermatt, Saas Fee and St Moritz as winter destinations. ?There is much more than just skiing and ice during Swiss winters, with lots of indoor entertainment at places that most other tourists were not aware of. But now we are receiving a lot of queries,? added Berry.

 Every year, about 5,000 Calcuttans travel to Zurich, Interlaken and other Alpine destinations, but with travel sops tumbling out, the figures are expected to soar. 

 ?It was always dubbed as a summer or honeymoon destination, but that trend is changing fast. We are also making an effort to present Switzerland in its new avatar in Calcutta,? said Aparna Basu Mullick, director of Club 7 Holidays, that sends about 2,000 Calcuttans under various holiday packages to Switzerland every year.

 ?We are also trying to promote more back-packers to travel from Calcutta to the Alps,? quipped Sanjoy Sett, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Association of India. 

 Swiss International Airlines has tied up with Lufthansa, the German airline, to make travel for tourists easier. In fact, members of the Swiss Travel Club and Lufthansa Miles amp; More frequent flyer programmes can collect and spend miles on both partner networks. 

 The features of the two frequent-flyer programmes will be further interlinked in association with Swiss Travel Club?s planned Star Alliance membership in 2006.

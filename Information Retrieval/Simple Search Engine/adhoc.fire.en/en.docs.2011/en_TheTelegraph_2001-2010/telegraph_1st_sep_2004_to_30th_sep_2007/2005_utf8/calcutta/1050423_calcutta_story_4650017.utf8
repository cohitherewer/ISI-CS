 A STAFF REPORTER

 A collection agent of a private bank was robbed of Rs 2.8 lakh on Gurusaday Road on Friday afternoon. According to police, the incident occurred around 1.45 pm, just outside a popular restaurant on the busy stretch.

 Laltu Das, 30, was about to leave on his motorcycle when two youths, in their early thirties, blocked his path.

 ?They pushed him to the ground, picked up his bag and fled. Laltu chased them but the two jumped on a waiting scooter and left the spot,? said an officer of the Ballygunge police station.

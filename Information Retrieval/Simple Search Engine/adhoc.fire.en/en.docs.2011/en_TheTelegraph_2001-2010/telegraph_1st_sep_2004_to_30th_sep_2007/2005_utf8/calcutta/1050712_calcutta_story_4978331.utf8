 Probe into hostel clash

 - Panel of professors to submit report by Wednesday

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A three-member committee will probe into Sunday?s clash between two groups of students in the main hostel of Medical College and Hospital, the college authorities announced on Monday. 

 The committee will comprise the heads of the departments of forensic science and cardio-thoracic surgery, along with a professor of anatomy. It will submit an assessment report to principal Jayshree Mitra by Wednesday, after hearing students from both sides.

 On Sunday afternoon, representatives of the Medical College Democratic Students Association and Students Federation of India (SFI) had clashed in the hostel, on Eden Hospital Road, over bringing newcomers into their respective folds.

 The students, armed with rods and chains, first clashed in a room on the second-floor. They smashed the windowpanes, before moving out and continuing their fight on the premises. The library was ransacked and a few chairs and tables broken in the clash that lasted over 45 minutes, prompting officers from the local Bowbazar police station to rush to the spot. 

 The report on the incident will be discussed at an emergency meeting of the college council on Wednesday. 

 ?The meeting will take up the matter with due urgency and decide on the steps to be taken to ensure that such an incident is not repeated here. Last night, I held a three-hour-long meeting with representatives of both the groups. The council will discuss the entire incident in detail,? principal Mitra said.

 In view of the clash, the college authorities on Monday cancelled a third-year semester examination on pathology to allow students more time to prepare for it.

 ?Since most of them couldn?t concentrate on their preparations on Sunday night, the exam was cancelled. It is an internal exam and can be held later,? Mitra added. 

 Based on complaints by the students? groups, police on Monday stepped up vigil in and around the hostel.

 A large section of the students has reportedly complained that the SFI members were bringing supporters from other medical colleges into the hostel in a show of strength and a repeat of such an incident could result in disaster.

 No outsiders were allowed into the hostel on Monday. The students of the college were also asked not to loiter on the campus and even in the canteen.

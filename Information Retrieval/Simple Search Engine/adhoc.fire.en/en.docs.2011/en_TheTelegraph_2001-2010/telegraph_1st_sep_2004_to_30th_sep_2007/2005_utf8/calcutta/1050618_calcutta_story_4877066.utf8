 Next to the eatery Amantran in the Nandan-Bangla Akademi-Rabindra 

 Sadan complex is a pay-and-use toilet. On the evening of 

 May 20, I spotted a man working in Amantran walk out of 

 its back door and go right behind the pay-and-use toilet 

 to relieve himself near the boundary wall. This, reportedly, 

 is the practice adopted by all those who work at the eatery, 

 as well as those manning the ticket counters. Often, daily 

 wage-earners, electricians, decorators and suppliers are 

 employed for a few days at the cultural centre for repairs 

 or construction of pandals for functions, fairs, etc. Most 

 of them follow the same practice, as their income doesn?t 

 permit them to pay for using the toilet every time. An arrangement 

 should be made for these people.

 I had dropped into Circus Avenue post office in the last 

 week of April and found it overcrowded. Recently, I heard 

 someone say that he had to return the third time without 

 availing of services from a post office as it was overcrowded. 

 The queues are for last-minute payment of telephone bills. 

 A separate counter should be opened specially for telephone 

 subscribers so that the other customers do not suffer.

 Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Bidhannagar General Hospital is the only government-run 

 hospital in Salt Lake. On June 7, I had gone to visit a 

 neighbour who had been admitted there. I was shocked to 

 find that a major portion of the building is in a dilapidated 

 state. Many people, who come to visit patients, spend the 

 night in the open near the building. They risk serious injuries 

 if a portion of the structure collapses on them. The building 

 should either be pulled down or repaired immediately. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 I have been a customer of a reputed foreign bank for several 

 years and regularly use its ATM off Southern Avenue. During 

 change of shift, the securitymen deployed there change clothes 

 inside the small enclosure inconveniencing the customers. 

 Can?t this be stopped? 

 Nisheeth Bijawat, 

 Park Street. 

 June 5 was observed as World Environment Day. Many private 

 organisations and government bodies organised seminars and 

 meetings, and advertised in the dailies to mark the day. 

 Wouldn?t it have been better if part of the money is spent 

 on spreading awareness in the semi-urban and rural areas 

 and in schools in the city? 

 Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park.

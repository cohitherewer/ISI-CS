 Fake car spares seized, sleuths net two

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fake Mercedes-Benz spares, worth at least Rs 1 crore, were seized by Enforcement Branch (EB) officers from two premises late on Thursday. 

 Two persons were arrested on charges of selling and supplying the spares.

 EB sources said the raids were carried out on the basis of specific information provided by Enforcers of Intellectual Property Rights (EIPR) India Ltd. An EB officer said: ?We not only seized the parts, but also the machines used to manufacture them.? 

 EIPR, a spokesman said, had been keeping a tab for the past few days on several manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, who were suspected of being involved in the business of fake auto spares. 

 ?Based on clinching evidence, we zeroed in on a manufacturing unit in Bauria, Howrah. The unit, a small-scale manufacturing facility, was found to be producing spring coils, pads and silencer rings. All these items would be later sold with fake Mercedez-Benz labels,? the spokesman added.

 A team of EB officers from Bhabani Bhavan, accompanied by EIPR representatives, raided the manufacturing unit. 

 ?We seized all the items found there and arrested the unit?s owner, 52-year-old Sheikh Shamsher Ali,? an EB officer said.

 The EB team, led by deputy superintendent of police Sukumar Dey, then headed for a wholesale shop on Strand Road. 

 ?We could trace a direct link between shop-owner Hassan Mulai and Ali. Mulai had placed the order for the items we seized at Ali?s unit,? the officer told Metro.

 The duo was arrested under the Trademarks Act, 1999, and Indian Penal Code. 

 A case (No. 18/05, dated 03.03.2005) has been lodged with Bauria police station.

 According to the sleuths, some of the seized spares had been earlier used. 

 ?Ali and Mulai might have a nexus with Mercedes-Benz repairing centres. They used to collect old spares from the garages and package them afresh,? said another officer.

 The EIPR investigation is on to trace all those involved in selling fake automobile parts. 

 ?A number of rackets are active in and around the city. The business is run through an organised chain, comprising garage-owners, manufacturers and wholesalers,? said an official.

 The EB, too, has activated its source network to gather information about the rackets. 

 ?If necessary, we will check all the places where Mercedes-Benz vehicles are repaired. Car owners, too, have been advised to contact us if they have any doubt about the spares they are buying for their vehicles,? a sleuth added.

 Apart from deputy superintendent Dey, the EB team that raided the premises on Thursday comprised inspectors Nirmal Bhattacharya, Ashim Banerjee and Shiv Kumar Banerjee.

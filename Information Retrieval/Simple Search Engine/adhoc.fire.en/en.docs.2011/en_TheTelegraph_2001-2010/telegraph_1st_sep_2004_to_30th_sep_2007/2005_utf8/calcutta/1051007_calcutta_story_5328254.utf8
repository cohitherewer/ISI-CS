The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New, faster airport road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Reaching the city airport from the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and the Salt Lake end will now take much less time, thanks to a new link road between Salt Lake Bypass and Rajarhat bridge, that opened on Thursday.

 State housing minister and Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) chairman Goutam Deb opened the 825-m-long, 30-m-wide link road, work on which started in April 2004.

 Though it is around seven km longer than the VIP Road route, it will take 20-25 minutes less to reach the airport via the new passage, a Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) engineer said.

 ?The road between the EM Bypass and Salt Lake is in good condition and so is the stretch between Rajarhat bridge and the airport. The stretch between Salt Lake and the bridge needed to be developed,? Deb said at the inauguration.

 ?The road forms a link between Salt Lake and New Town,? said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 Land was purchased from central government organisations and two acres of CMDA land were used for the six-lane link road, on which Rs 7 crore ? shared equally by Hidco and CMDA ? was spent.

 Ancillary work includes widening of both an 800-m road and the 824-m Salt Lake Bypass.

 Bhattacharya said a notification on setting up an industrial township authority for Sector V had been issued. ?We want the well-being of the people as well as industrialisation. So, it?s important to develop Sector V,? he observed.

 A sum of Rs 50 crore was allotted for the development of Salt Lake, South Dum Dum and Dum Dum under the National Urban Renewal Mission for a water treatment plant at Palta, which will supply 10 million gallons to these areas.

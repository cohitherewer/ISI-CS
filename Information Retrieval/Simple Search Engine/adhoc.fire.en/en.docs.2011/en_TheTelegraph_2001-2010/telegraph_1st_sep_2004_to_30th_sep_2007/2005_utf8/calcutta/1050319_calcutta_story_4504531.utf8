 Sachin?s seventh, in cyberspace club

 If Sachin Tendulkar became the fifth batsman to scale the 10,000-run peak on March 16, Amartya Banerjee beat him by exactly a month to become the seventh to enter another special club.

 This club comprises fans who have managed to post their cyber presence in Sachin?s inbox. The count ? now seven ? is kept by the man himself. And with more than 23,000 international runs under his belt, he sure knows how to count.

 ??u r only the seventh fan in my whole career to mail me. But, must tell u that u r the first to mail me so rapidly. It?s a great feeling when I realise I have fans like u?,? Sachin wrote to the South Point cricket captain on February 16.

 Early in February, 18-year-old Amartya stumbled upon the vital link ? the coveted email ID ? in the web world. 

 ?I was searching for Sachin?s picture on the Net to save on my desktop when under one photograph, an email address blinked.? The address vanished when the page opened. It wasn?t there when Amartya returned to the picture two weeks later.

 But the Class XI student grabbed the half-chance. He shot off a hello mail immediately. With no response, Amartya peppered his hero with reminders ? 20 in three days, again by Sachin?s count.

 Then, the Master Blaster opened his account, with a single: ?Thanks for mailing.?

 ?He was thanking me,? the teenager laughs with childlike glee. This encouraged Amartya to write a longer mail ? wishing Sachin luck for the India-Pak series, seeking tips on the crucial start-up years of a budding cricketer.

Sachin then responded in kind: ?? Again I have 

an evidence to prove that calcuttans r absolutely crazy? Anyway I must tell u, 

don?t change urself a bit throughout ur life even if someday u become a big man. 

BE AS SIMPLE AND EXITING AS U R?? .

 Amartya is bowled over by the lines Sachin has dropped him, but with feet firmly on the ground. ?I know I am so very lucky. I like him a lot, though he is not my idol,? says the all-rounder, who likes ?both Sachin and Sourav (Ganguly)?.

 The school team?s cricket captain is busy planning his career on the field and tips from the man who debuted for India at age 16 could prove vital.

 Amartya bats right-handed at number three and bowls left-handed ? ?pace or spin, as the wicket demands?. He has accumulated a healthy 380 runs in his first season of second-division league cricket. ?I had an offer last year, too, but my father wanted me to concentrate on the Board exams.?

 The battle between book and bat (or ball) will hot up with Amartya opting for the science stream. 

 ?Actually, I want to take up physics honours,? he says, a trifle apologetically. His mail-friend, of course, quit the classroom real early to do duty for Team India.

 And Amartya?s final word on Sachin: ?Both of us are cricketers. I want to play beside him.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Schoolboy duo missing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mystery shrouds the disappearance of two brothers from their house in Dum Dum on Sunday. Binoy, 14, and Sonu, 12, students of Class VIII and VI, respectively, of North Calcutta Public School, went out to play on Sunday morning but didn?t return home.

 Police are investigating the claims of Binoy?s classmate, Ekta Lal, of having received a call from Binoy, from a cell phone, late on Sunday night. Binoy reportedly told Ekta that he and his brother were on their way to Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh, respectively. A team of sleuths has left for Uttar Pradesh to locate the missing schoolchildren.

 The brothers ? Binoy, in a checked shirt and trousers, and Sonu, in a T-shirt and jeans ? left their house at 47, Bipin Behari Ganguly Road around 11 am on Sunday.

 ?Binoy wanted to go downstairs and play. My wife allowed him and Sonu also went along. When they failed to return after hours, she grew anxious. After searching for them in the neighbourhood, she informed me in Asansol, where I had gone on business,? said Suraj Kumar Seth, a dealer in auto parts.

 When frantic calls to relatives till late into the night threw up no clues about the children?s whereabouts, Seth lodged a missing persons diary with Dum Dum police station.

 ?On Sunday morning, our neighbours had seen the boys carrying sophisticated mobile phones. We never gave them cell phones,? said the worried father.

 ?Ekta said Binoy had also told her to inform their headmaster and other friends in school about their plans to go to Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh. We have got the mobile number from which Binoy made the call, and it will provide the vital link to solve the case,? said an officer of North 24-Parganas police.

 Police also suspect that the kids might have run away from home or the incident of being the fallout of a family feud. But Seth disagreed: ?They were neither scolded by us nor was there any commotion in the household.?

 Meanwhile, police have also interrogated Ekta and other family members of the missing boys. ?Our investigation is on,? said Praveen Kumar, North 24-Parganas police superintendent.

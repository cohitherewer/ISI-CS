The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cable home count hits a howler

 - Govt census finds only a lakh households, unofficial tally stands at 18 lakh

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 How many cable homes are there in Calcutta? Around 18 lakh, says the unofficial industry count.

 How many cable homes are there in Calcutta? Only a lakh, says the official government count.

 The move to bring some order to the chaotic world of the cable industry has hit a howler ? only 400-odd operators have responded to the state government?s novel cable census, leading to the absurd cable and satellite homes count of a lakh.

 This works out to less than a tenth of the actual figure and around one-third of operators? monthly declaration to broadcasters.

 With the state government?s call to cablemen for voluntary declaration of households falling on deaf ears, the powers-that-be are understandably not keen to talk numbers. ?I cannot tell you the figure that has come up but we are having a meeting this week to assess the situation,? Arun Bhattacharya, principal secretary to the chief minister, told Metro on Monday.

 An official involved with the census, however, admitted: ?The figures are not tallying at all with even a rational assessment.?

 The census was undertaken by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in November 2004 to check under-declaration and end frequent cable spats, often resulting in blackout and viewer discontent.

 ?Several hurdles have to be crossed, including reluctance to declare numbers on the part of a section of operators? We may have to explore other options now,? the official added.

The deadline for the survey - fixed for January 31, 

2005 at the October 15, 2004 meeting between government and cable industry representatives 

where the census move was announced - was first pushed back to February and now 

looks certain to be extended to March, or beyond.

Peeved at the poor response to the disclosure forms 

sent out through local police stations, the government is now contemplating a 

more direct approach to get a fix on the numbers.

 quot;We are thinking of starting a door-to-door sample 

survey, quot; said Bhattacharya. This could be carried out by an accredited market 

research agency. Without putting a date on the completion of the survey, he added: 

 quot;We are trying to speed it up as much as possible. Work has also started 

in four districts. quot;

Industry players, particularly broadcasters, are not 

amused. They were, after all, asked to maintain status quo and not hike subscription 

rates till completion of the survey. quot;We had pinned hoped on the survey to 

clear the mess, quot; said the regional representative of an entertainment bouquet, 

 quot;but like past efforts by the government, this one, too, seems to be headed 

nowhere. quot;

Disputes between broad casters and multi-system operators 

have continued, and the next switch-off may just be around the corner. The double 

jeopardy to guard against: Champions League soccer and the Oscars.

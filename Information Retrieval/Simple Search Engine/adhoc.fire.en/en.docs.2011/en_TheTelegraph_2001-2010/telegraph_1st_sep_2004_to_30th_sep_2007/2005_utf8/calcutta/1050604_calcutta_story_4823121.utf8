The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Manifesto of marginalised children

 - Underprivileged youngsters meet leaders with demand draft

 NISHA LAHIRI

 They may be too young to vote, but these children know more about life?s hardships than most adults. Basic necessities like water, education, electricity and medical treatment are hard won, and cannot be taken for granted by Calcutta?s underprivileged youngsters. And yet, they fight on, hoping to bring their plight to the notice of the men in power.

 Forty-four children from 11 NGOs got together over two days to come up with the manifesto, divided into health, education, infrastructure (roads, water, electricity, etc) and governance (police, councillors, etc). Four of them presented it to Left Front chairman Biman Bose on Thursday. Another group is readying for a similar presentation to the Congress next week.

 Sarfaraz, 12, was one of the four children, under the aegis of Save the Children, UK, and CRY (Child Relief and You), who met Bose at the Alimuddin Street party headquarters.

 A migrant labourer from Bihar, he lives in the tailoring shop where he works. He?s the only earning member of his family, and sends most of his Rs 100-per-week salary back to his family. His father is too old to work, his eldest brother is dead, another brother is blind in one eye and lame, and his sister is soon to be married.

 He wants a playground in school, just so can he play occasionally. He would like education to be free, so he can actually go to school. At the moment, his only source of education is the NGO Mayurbhanj Joint Citizen Centre, in Ekbalpore. His favourite subject is history.

 Sarfaraz presented the education section of the manifesto, which included simple suggestions like ramps in schools to make them disability-friendly, toilets that work, teachers who come on time and teachers who are better trained.

 Shafique Alam, 16, talked about health. Sunita, 13, from a slum in Kalighat, spoke of the infrastructure improvements sorely needed, like more than one toilet and one water tap for about 300-400 residents of slums.

 But the kids left Alimuddin Street disappointed. While Bose was categorical about what couldn?t be done, the rest was relegated to the politically predictable: ?We?ll see what we can do.?

 Sarfaraz was ?hurt? when Bose said ?impossible? to the children?s suggestion of a playground in government schools citing lack of space. But what upset him most is that the CPM leader didn?t give any assurances.

 These children know that promises made before elections are rarely ever kept. So their expectations from the political parties contesting the municipal corporation elections is ?nothing?.

 ?They come and meet us before the elections and promise the world. But never deliver,? Sarfaraz sighs. ?Even the good roads have been dug up now, on the pretence of work. But after they are elected, no one cares.?

 The kids are realistic enough to realise that this time there won?t be any results. They are romantic enough to believe that a start has been made. ?At least we spoke in one voice. Over time, we may be heard,? chorus the child change-makers.

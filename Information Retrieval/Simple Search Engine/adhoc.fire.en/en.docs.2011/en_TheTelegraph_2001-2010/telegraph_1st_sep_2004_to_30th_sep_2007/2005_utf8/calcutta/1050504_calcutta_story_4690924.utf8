 Among all cocktails meant to ease the stifling heat and humidity, wine spritzers are perhaps the easiest to whip up. Primarily a glass of wine with club soda added to it, the drink can be made to sparkle just a bit more with the healthy benefits of fruits. 

 Slices of strawberry, mango, grapes and olives can merge high spirits with nutrients. For added panache, use flavoured sparkling water. 

 This ideal summer drink is best served by the poolside.

 Strawberry Spritzer

 Ingredients: White wine (preferably sweet) 150 ml, soda, strawberries

 Method: Pour the wine in a tall pilsner glass and top it up with soda. Next, dice the fresh strawberries and allow them to mix with the drink for a sip ?? bite experience. 

 Mango Spritzer

 Method: Pour the wine in a pilsner glass and top it up with soda. Mix diced fresh mangoes. 

 Grape Spritzer

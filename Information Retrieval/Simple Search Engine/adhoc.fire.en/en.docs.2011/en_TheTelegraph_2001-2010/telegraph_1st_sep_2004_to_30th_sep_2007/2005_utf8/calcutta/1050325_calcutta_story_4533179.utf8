 Cop coordination after 20 years

 - Sleuth-thana interface to check crime

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They took 20 years to realise the importance of coordination among police stations in curbing crime. In a bid to make up for lost time, the detective department (DD) has decided to restart crime conferences involving police stations across the city. 

 Coordination with police stations, once a regular feature in the mid-80s, will start once again within a day or two. ?Senior officers of the DD will regularly interact with the deputy commissioners of various divisions and officers posted in police stations,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (DC) of police, DD (I).

 An officer of the DD?s anti-rowdy squad said poor coordination with police stations, leading to a collapse in the source network, had prompted the authorities to revive the system. ?Now, officers of police stations hardly share information with us. As a result, the agency is suffering,? he said.

 Coordination meetings were mandatory before the mid-80s. ?The last official meeting was held when H.A. Safwi was chief of the city detectives. After his tenure, no official meeting was organised,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Another senior officer, who was once DC (I), DD, said: ?Two decades ago, sharing information with the DD was mandatory for the officers in police stations. The deputy commissioners of the divisions were bound to follow the instructions of DC (I), DD. But after Safwi?s tenure, the system collapsed. The divisional DCs started ignoring the DD.?

 Citing an example of lack of coordination, another officer, who also worked as city detective chief, said: ?During my tenure, I had learnt that one divisional DC (name withheld on request) had debarred all police stations under his jurisdiction from sharing any information with the DD. There was a clash of egos.?

 An officer added: ?Sometimes, criminals we are looking for take refuge in areas under the jurisdiction of a city police station. Despite being aware of it, the local police do not bother to inform us. They think catching those criminals is entirely our responsibility.?

 Elaborating on his new game plan, Singh said: ?All my officers and myself will meet at the office of the DC (south division). His officers will also be present there. I will go to his office because he is senior to me.? 

 He added: ?The other divisional DCs will go to Lalbazar police headquarters and share information with us.?

 Agreeing with the decision taken by Singh, an officer of the DD said: ?This meeting should have been organised much earlier. These meetings should never have been stopped.?

 An officer of the anti-rowdy squad added: ?Our source network is expected to be back in action once again.?

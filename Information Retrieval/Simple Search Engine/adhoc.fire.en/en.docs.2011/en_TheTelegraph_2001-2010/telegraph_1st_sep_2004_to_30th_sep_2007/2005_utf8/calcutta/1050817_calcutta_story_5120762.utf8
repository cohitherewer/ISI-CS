 The idea that defines art

 - Seven artists in search of concepts

 Only ideas can fuel the creative process. They provide artists with a mental framework, as it were, which they are free to give shape to and bring to life. As in the past, CIMA Gallery has once again invited seven artists from all over the country to exhibit works that are built around a concept.

 While the works of Jaya Ganguly and Samir Aich ? both from Calcutta ? are visibly figurative, the frame of reference of the five other participants is quite different. They belong to the realm of ideas, with the artist striving to body forth what are mainly thoughts struggling to find expression on canvas, paper or whatever surface the artist chooses to work on.

 The concept is central to the works of Yogesh Rawal. Light is the ?fundamental? on which his works are based. They are focused and contemplative works where he borrows ideas from physics and devices means of giving aesthetic expression to these.

 In the diptych inspired by Bhopal architecture, light seems to be the wellspring of life emanating from a red-hot core of energy that dances like fire. He creates a complex surface texture in each work, his medium being paper collage, cellulose and synthetic resins on treated wood.

 Two of his works are quite outstanding. In one, flecks of light flit across a multi-layered black and gray surface. In the other, the light leaves delicate marks on a ground that resembles mottled old leather.

 The goddess Kali used to appear frequently in the works of Jaya Ganguly who lived near her famous temple. While the deity does not put in an appearance any longer, women still play a vital role in her works. They are drowsy-eyed creatures with tentacles ? part night hag, part figures of fun, their oozy reproductive system like dark caverns. Ganguly has made some fine drawings based on this idea.

 Amitava Das had passed out from the College of Art in New Delhi. His interests are diverse and some of his current works with their stark juxtapositions of black and white have been inspired by the names of ragas and opposites such as day and night. 

 Space is divided in vertical strips and he often uses dollops of paint to define his surface. From a distance the canvas appears sequinned or like heavy, glossy silk.

 Although strictly speaking his works are non-figurative, if one examines them carefully enough one can discover forms like the black Nightbird.

 Samir Aich uses the female form innovatively as it transmutes into a musical instrument, Salvador Dali fashion. Unlike the surrealist master Aich uses a thin film of paint in a placid shade but in essence it is form one can expect to see in a waking dream.

 That Baiju Parthan is a professor of ancient civilisation and metaphysics comes across from the images of Krishna and Buddha. Yet his interest in computer graphics is evident from his pixalated image of Krishna and occasional use of windings font.

 Prabhakar Kolte slathers thick paint on his canvases. Another delicately-painted surface peeks from underneath. This is the ?darshan? or revelation that the poet-artist?s works afford.

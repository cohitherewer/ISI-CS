 At the end of Lal Dighi, a vast plot of open land is fast 

 turning into a garbage dump and a cluster of small thatched 

 huts is coming up behind Calcutta Telephone Bhavan. The 

 authorities should immediately demolish the makeshift houses. 

 Also, a construction there, made several years ago for supplying 

 drinking water, is now abandoned and has become an eyesore. 

 This open space should be spruced up and kept clean. The 

 place can be transformed into a beautiful park.

 A very close friend of mine met with a serious accident 

 at Taratala crossing on May 10. He was hit by a taxi and 

 as he fell his right hand was crushed by a speeding private 

 bus. Immediately after the mishap, Moloy Ganguly, officer 

 in charge of New Alipore police station, rushed to my friend?s 

 aid and despite the peak-hour traffic took time out to contact 

 the victim?s relatives. Ganguly also booked the erring taxi 

 driver and bus driver. Policemen like Ganguly are rare to 

 find these days. It is heartening to know that there still 

 exist such police personnel who come to the aid of distressed 

 citizens.

 It is known to all that the Indian Museum has a loophole-ridden 

 security system. Even the maintenance of the exhibits, especially 

 those which are not accommodated in glass enclosures, is 

 far from convincing. The huge skeletons of pre-historic 

 animals have been allowed to be used by over-enthusiastic 

 visitors for scribbling messages. The visitors are officially 

 debarred from touching the exhibits. But instead, it seems 

 that those appointed for cleaning the exhibits have been 

 following the rule.

 I took an SBI Calcutta credit card as one of SBI?s privileged 

 customers in October 2004. I was told that the registration 

 charges for the first year would be waived if I make a purchase 

 of Rs 500 or more with the card immediately. On October 

 24, I purchased products for Rs 560.50 with my card. As 

 per my instruction, the amount was debited from my savings 

 account at SBI Kalyani on November 22, 2004. But surprisingly, 

 SBI Card is claiming that it didn?t get the payment. On 

 my request, SBI Kalyani has even issued a bank statement 

 which shows the deduction from my account. Unless SBI Card 

 received the cheque, how was the money debited from my account 

 at SBI Kalyani? SBI Card is still sending me bills for the 

 initial amount along with the accrued interest ? a total 

 of Rs 2,366 as on May 10, 2005. I even receive calls on 

 my cell phone demanding that I pay up. I have already stopped 

 using the credit card in fear of landing into more trouble. 

 SBI Card has informed that it will keep bombarding me with 

 enhanced bills every month till I pay up. Who do I approach 

 for redress?

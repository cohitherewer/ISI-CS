 Cops oust wrong tenant

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhaya of Calcutta High Court on Monday directed the officer-in-charge of Behala police station to appear before him and produce all documents relating to the eviction of a tenant of a flat whose case is pending in Alipore court.

 The court passed the order after the tenant, Krishna Chakraborty, moved a petition alleging that court officers, in connivance with Behala police and her landlady, had broken open her flat and taken away all her belongings.

 The petitioner told the court that her landlady had filed two separate eviction suits ? one against her and another against the tenant of the adjacent flat in the same building on Behala?s Sourin Roy Road.

 The landlady, Haripriya Nath, obtained an eviction decree against the tenant of the other flat, while the suit against her (Chakraborty) was pending with Alipore court.

 Chakraborty?s lawyer Uttam Majumdar told the court that on November 27, his client and her husband, Asit Adhikari, returned from work and found that a wall had been constructed in front of their flat. 

 Neighbours told them that their landlady had obtained an eviction decree from the court, and police, in the presence of court officers, handed over possession of the flat to the landlady.

 Chakraborty moved high court after Behala police did nothing to right the wrong.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flight boost for Thames traveller

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 The city by the Hooghly seems to have come closer to the city by the Thames, thanks to the launch of Air-India?s (AI) non-stop flights from Calcutta to London. The first flight took off on June 18. 

 The introduction of the flight has improved the average Calcuttan?s prospects of holidaying in London. 

 Like those in Delhi and Mumbai, the residents of the city now have an option of taking a direct flight to the UK capital without having to spend money travelling out of Calcutta. 

 For the airline, ?the increasing affluence? of Calcuttans means a growing market. It is offering attractive introductory fares ? round-trip, economy-class fare, valid till July 31, is Rs 25,810.

 Boeing 777-200 aircraft are being used for the flights. Each of them will offer 272 seats in three classes ? 12 first class, 49 executive class and 211 economy class.

 Jitender Bhargava, director, public relations, AI, said introduction of the flights are part of the airline?s broad policy decision to operate to international destinations from various cities in the country, and not just from Delhi and Mumbai. 

 AI now has a total of 24 flights per week to the UK. Only wide-bodied aircraft ? Boeing 747-400s and Boeing 777-200s ? are used.

 Airline officials said that hopping to London from the city would no longer be a big deal for Calcuttans, with fares set to reduce further in the future. ?An evening at Trafalgar Square or shopping at Marks and Spencer or Harrods need not remain a distant dream now,? an official stated.

 The net profit of AI has, however, come down from Rs 92 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 15 crore in 2004-05. The reduction was attributed to rise in fuel prices by the officials.

 The profit prospects for the current financial year dont seem too bright, either, with Air-India suffering a revenue loss of Rs 340 crore on fuel price and bilateral royalty. 

 ?It is a worrying sign for us, but we are trying to improve on the quality of flying. We are going in for upgrades, like change in menu every week, keeping in mind those who fly frequently,? Amod Sharma, director, in-flight service and corporate affairs, AI said in London.

 The revenue loss has not dampened expectations of the airline brass. ?We anticipate a growth of 20 to 25 per cent in passenger traffic over the next few years,? said Bhargava.

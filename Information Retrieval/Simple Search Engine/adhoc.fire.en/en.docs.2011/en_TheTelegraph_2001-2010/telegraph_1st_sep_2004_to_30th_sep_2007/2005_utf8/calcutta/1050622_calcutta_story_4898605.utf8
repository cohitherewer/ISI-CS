 The few who held their own

 OUR BUREAU

 The CPM had targeted certain wards where workers and leaders had a one-point agenda ? that of ousting the present incumbent and wresting the seat. However, results reveal that even CPM?s formidable election machinery failed to touch these candidates.

 Ward 66: Monday night was a night of celebration for the local CPM leadership in the Tiljala, Colony Bazar, Picnic Garden areas. So certain were they of dislodging their formidable enemy, Javed Ahmed Khan, that 12 hours before the counting, they distributed sweets. CPM candidate Subrata Chakraborty, alias Ladu, was heard saying: ?Don?t worry about Javed, enjoy the sweets?.

 Javed Khan reacted: ?If the electronic voting machines are not faulty or tampered with, my margin will double this time?. In 2000, Javed had won by 5400 votes. 

 On Tuesday, Javed Khan maintained a lead over Ladu in all seven rounds, with a final winning margin of 9,855 votes. 

 This ward was on the CPM wish list and Jyoti Basu, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Biman Bose and Subhas Chakraborty campaigned for the party. Police extended a helping hand to the ruling party candidate.

 Javed?s strength: His personal force of wholetimers, a mai-baap attitude towards the poor, free mixing, even with CPM workers. Clean image as councillor for the past 10 years. 

 Ward 85: Debasis Kumar felt nervous when, like other newspaper subscribers of his locality, he discovered a leaflet inside the morning paper, accusing him of being responsible for the drowning of two boys in his ward in 2001 and 2004. 

 The CPM was angry with Kumar as he had won the 2000 election as an Independent candidate and joined the Trinamul in exchange for post of borough chief. This election, he won by over 2,500 votes.

 Debasis?s strength: Subrata Mukherjee, his own resources, including musclemen, coupled with his hold over slums. Development work. 

 Ward 141: Moyn-ul-Haque Chowdhury. Everyone except Haque Chowdhury was sure he would not manage to retain his ward this time. The CPM mistook him for a soft target.

 After Sunday, the list of probable losers started with his name. On Tuesday, Chowdhury emerged victorious by a margin of 254 votes.

 Haque Chowdhury?s strength: Rustic simplicity, his faith in his tailor community and above all, the CPM?s last-moment decision of not letting one-third of Garden Reach fall into the hands of the powerful Ansari family.

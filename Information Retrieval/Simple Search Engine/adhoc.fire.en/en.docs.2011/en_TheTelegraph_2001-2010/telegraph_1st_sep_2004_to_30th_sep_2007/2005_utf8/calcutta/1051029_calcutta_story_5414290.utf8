 Puja fever seems long gone, giving way to Diwali mania. With malls housing fresh stocks, colourful candles being displayed in every nook and corner, fireworks and exciting offers of Dhanteras, the festive mood seems feverish.

 And why not? This, after all, is the time of the year to give and get gifts. But if you?re still racking your brains over gift options, here?s a guide from GoodLife:

 Tradition treat

 ?Dry fruits are the obvious options during the festival of lights, but it is the packaging that makes all the difference,? says Gagan Bagri of Ramans, a store housing chocolate, dry fruits and other savouries at Forum. Along with the regular cashewnuts, pistachios and raisins, the pack includes an assortment of imported chocolate, juices and even mouth fresheners.

 ?A gift basket of dry fruits should cater to the entire family, rather than focussing on an individual. With such inclusions, you cater to the tastes and preferences of the young and the old,? adds Gagan.

 Apart from the regular cane baskets, you can opt for pretty handmade pinewood cases decorated with mirrors, sequins and colourful ribbons. The sleek metallic ones catch your attention at Ramans. Each holder has dry fruits in bright red batuas. Prices start at Rs 200.

 When it comes to sweets, innovation is the name of the game at Gupta Brothers, with Chocolate Diya, Badam Diya and what not. Handmade chocolates and cookies are on offer at Kookie Jar and Flurys. Those on the lookout for traditional favourites can also check out Bikaram Chandmal amp; Sons.

 Fashion fiesta 

 With almost every store and designer launching a special collection for Diwali, clothes hunting for family members is hardly a headache. ?Bright is the mantra this festive season. Saris are classics that have always been a hit and empire-line kurtas are also in vogue,? explains designer Sucheta Merh.

 Pantaloons and Westside are treasure troves of kurtis in all shapes and sizes. At Shoppers? Stop, smart tops with ethnic touches come in shades like red and black. Belts and scarves are a rage, too. From bright sequinned ones at Shoppers? Stop to cotton-knitted ones in sober shades at Westside, there is a wide variety to choose from. An exhibition Bag It at Darbari offers a wide range of affordable options when it comes to bags.

 Lucrative discounts on making charges of diamond and gold jewellery and a free mehndi session with every purchase at Anjali Jewellers, a discount on making charges and old gold exchange offers at PC Chandra ? all geared to making shopping fun.

 An amalgamation of old and contemporary trends, the collection at DiaGold boasts of an exclusive line of diamond and studded jewellery on gold, silver and white gold. At Jewel Co, a jewellery boutique at HHI, it is the antique-looking sets that are eye-catchers.

 But jewellery doesn?t always mean gold, diamond and platinum, for costume jewellery is quite a rage. At Nik Nish, you have cascading earrings in abstract and floral designs. Tiny jewellery boxes in ceramic on the lines of Victorian designs come in shades of sea green and baby pink. Pantaloons is home to a collection of painted copper earrings and neckpieces from Akkriti.

 Light lustre

 Gel candles in huge pitchers, candles with artificial flowers and wooden chips preserved, and packs that include incense sticks, cute little candles and holders are a big draw at Nik Nish.

 A unique offering at the store is an elephant carrying a plate of earthen lamps and a diya set against a swastika. Imported floating candles at Landmark are available in delicate floral designs.

 Kids? corner

 With some schools still carrying on with their Puja holidays, here?s your chance to keep the little ones busy with books. Not the textbook variety, though. Some stores around town have brought in special books for Diwali that make for good gifts for children.

 Lights For Gita by Rachna Gilmore talks about how Gita, an NRI, celebrates Diwali in the west. Diwali: The Festival Of Lights by Laxmi Jain and Meenal Pandya is a story-cum-activity book that includes recipes, glossary and word-search games relevant to the festival.

 Clothes and chocolate are the most popular gifts for kids. Ghagra cholis and kurtas for tiny tots are available at Westside and Lilliput at Alipore. Instead of the run-of-the-mill chocolates, you can also surprise them with edible diyas from Kookie Jar.

 Decor designs

 Crystal, frosted glass and marble Ganeshas, Krishna and Lakshmi idols at Pantaloons, silver idols at Princess on Sarat Bose Road are apt buys for the occasion. 

 Then there are colourful door decor items called bandanwars embellished with stones and sequins. You can also gift framed clay paintings that look like rangolis. 

 e-shopping

 And just in case you can?t find time to go shop hopping, a click of your mouse opens up a whole world of online gifting options. Puja thalis, innovatively-packed dry fruits, cracker combos, diyas, candles, Lakshmi-Ganesha idols? Sify.com, diwali-gifts.com and diwaliutsav.com are some of the sites you can browse.

 Frames of fear from a realist

 A couple high over the map of Africa. On the ground a bazooka-wielding child dressed in war fatigue. Missiles whizzing around, columns of smoke and deep red gashes on the map. A woman cringing, stark white and naked under the censoring eyes of a couple of dark cyborgs. The calm and endearing eyes of a young AIDS volunteer with a crown of thorns barely visible through his hair?

 These and other haunting images make up the Enki Bilal show opening at the Victoria Memorial Hall this Tuesday.

 Chernobyl, Hiroshima, the young sacrificed in repeated wars, the destructive power of fundamentalists, the rich and the powerful in everyday living ? these comprise the fear of Enki Bilal, one of France?s greatest graphic novelists and directors.

 ?I wish people would use their imagination to fly up really high from where they realise that the planet is a globe,? says Enki Bilal, for whom this visit to India is another opportunity to discover the universality of all cultures.

 On view is a painting dedicated to his memories of India when he came to Mumbai and Goa as a tourist. ?India to me represents a lot of energy and colour,? says this lover of Satyajit Ray films, ?looking forward to seeing the city a bit closer?.

 The visions of terror captured by the powerful strokes of pastel, acrylic, ink and pencil have their origin in the tales told by Bilal?s Bosnian father. ?He was a partisan fighting against the Nazis and Tito was a dictator??

 Bilal?s family fled to Paris when he was 10. In Paris, Bilal was introduced to comics, films and theatre. ?It was a democracy and even as a child I could sense the freedom?.

 Later, during the Yugoslavian civil wars, Bilal was asked by a publisher to go to Sarajevo and write a book but he refused and, instead, produced the graphic novel Dormant Beast. ?To me, the death of Tito had the effect of a sudden thawing of a frozen lake, the beast of Nationalism was released,? recounts Bilal.

 Blood-sucking monsters, robots, masked figures, gizmos of manipulation, reptiles and birds of prey? is the future all black? ?If there is darkness there is also humour because one can?t survive these dangerous times without humour. There is also, behind each narrative, a love story. I would like to be remembered as a realist or an optimist who understood.?

 Bilal is a much-revered comic artist. ?In France and Europe comics are not just for children, they are considered intellectual reflections of the times?. Some of Bilal?s graphic novels have been ?destructured into films? like Tykho Moon, Bunker Palace Hotel and Immortals, of which Immortals (?a strange love story?) will be screened at Nandan III on December 20.

 The show jointly presented by the French Embassy in India and The French Association in Calcutta will continue till January 7.

 Shapes and strokes

 Forms and colours are at the core of any work of art. While form gives structure, meaning and direction, colour animates the work of art, giving it a life of its own. The artists ability to design a composition with forms and colours helps conjure in our minds a vision of the world, as the artist would have us see it. Juxtaposition of forms and colours also possess the power to transform any art object. Whereas a particular combination of colours can create an illusion of space, others give an impression of being constrained; what represents harmony in one can become an image of discord in another. Celebrating the masterful interplay of colours and forms with the artists imagination, Artful Musings, the ongoing exhibition of Indian art and sculpture showcases some of the best works by contemporary artists. Participating artists include Atanu Bhattacharya, Bratin Khan, Sanatan Dinda, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Swapan Das, Subroto Gangopadhyay (one of his works appears above), Suhas Roy and Rintu Roy.

 Colleague shoots cop by accident 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sub-inspector of Cossipore police station was injured on Monday morning after a colleague accidentally fired his service revolver.

 ?Sub-inspector Debabrata Chakraborty had gone to collect the revolver from the file monitor, constable Ashok Choudhury. While Choudhury was issuing the revolver, a bullet went off accidentally, and it pierced Chakraborty on the left side of his lower abdomen,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 ?Constable Choudhury has been suspended for negligence and dereliction of duty,? said Barun Kumar Mullick, deputy commissioner of police (north division), who visited the sub-inspector in hospital.

 Anil Kumar Jana, officer-in-charge of Cossipore police station, rushed sub-inspector Chakraborty to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Chakraborty had just arrived at the police station for the afternoon shift as duty officer. 

 He received preliminary treatment at RG Kar Hospital , before being referred to SSKM Hospital. 

 He was wheeled into the operating theatre around 5.15 pm, and till late in the evening, surgeons were struggling to extract the bullet that had lodged itself deep in his chest.

 ?Precautionary measures are absolutely necessary even in the most routine of jobs. A file monitor?s job at the armoury is to check the weapon after removing all the bullets,? explained a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters. 

 ?The weapon?s barrel should always be pointed upwards at a 45-degree angle, and all our personnel are trained to do this as a basic safety measure. When you are handling firearms, you cannot take any chances. A small mistake can take someone?s life,? added the officer.

 According to him, there is a need to keep changing file monitors at police stations to keep them on their toes.

 ?This incident is the result of utter callousness. When a person gets used to a routine job, he tends to become cocksure and then, turns negligent,? the officer said.

 ?In this kind of a situation, it becomes a question of life and death. It was sub-inspector Chakraborty?s good luck that the injury was not fatal, though he is in a critical condition,? he added.

 Last year, outside the Lalbazar control room, an officer of the detective department was shot while handing over his weapon to a constable.

 The event started in Calcutta five years ago, and has travelled around the country. This year, the finals of the National Science Drama Festival returns to the city.

 Organised by the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), the annual event ropes in schools from different parts of India. The theme for 2005 was Science and Society, with the district, state and zonal level competitions having concluded. September 10 is the final, with two teams from each zone ? north, south, east and west.

 But this is not a competition, clarifies Jayanta Sthanapati, director, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), which organises the event on behalf of NCSM in Calcutta. ?All the teams will be awarded prizes. There will just be an expert panel, with one person each from Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, to watch the plays and give opinions and criticisms,? he added.

 Till the zonal rounds, there were awards for best director and scriptwriter (who were teachers), and best actor and actress (for the students).

 For the finals, there are north zone teams from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, Orissa and Assam from the east, two Maharashtra teams from the west and one each from Kerala and Karnataka from the south. A maximum of eight actors, up to Class X, is allowed for each team, with a teacher as the director. The plays can be in any Indian language, but no longer than 30 minutes.

 The plays include a variety of themes. There?s Vaccination: Prevention is Better Than Cure (UP), Bijoyi Bigyan (Orissa), Vision 3005 (Maharashtra), Aftab (Maharashtra), Book of Life (Kerala), Baba Ka Ashram (Haryana), Parisara Premi Yama (Karnataka) and Abhigyan (Assam).

 On the eve of the finals, Friday saw a daylong theatre workshop involving Shaoli Mitra for all 64 student participants, as well as the eight teachers. The festival will be held at Science City auditorium on Saturday, inaugurated by actor Soumitra Chatterjee.

 A Habib Tanvir play

 Bhulwa Ram, the folk actor from Chhattisgarh and a member of Habib Tanvir?s Naya Theatre, died on August 30, at the age of 80. Bhulwa began his career as a member of the Ringli-Raveli Nacha party that comprised the best singer-actor-dancers of the improvisatory and comic Nacha tradition in Chhattisgarh. Bhulwa was known for his clear and melodious voice and also his astonishing rendition of woman characters in such stock Nacha dramas such as Jamadarin.

 Habib Tanvir spotted him during a Nacha performance in 1958 and, along with five others, brought him to Delhi to be part of the Hindustani Theatre production of Mitti Ki Gadi. Naya Theatre was founded in 1959 under the directorship of Tanvir and Bhulwa was an indispensable member. 

 In Naya Theatre productions, his lucid and liquid voice along with his clarity of diction drew national and international attention. His best-loved role was perhaps as the Guru to the irascible Charan Das in Tanvir?s acknowledged masterpiece Charan Das Chor, though his portrayal of the title role as the tribal leader Hirma in Hirma Ki Amar Kahani was no less powerful. Bhulwa finally retired from Naya Theatre early this year.

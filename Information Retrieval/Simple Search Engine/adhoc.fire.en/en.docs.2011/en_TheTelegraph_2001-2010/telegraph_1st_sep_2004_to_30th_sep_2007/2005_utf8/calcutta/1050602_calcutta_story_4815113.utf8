 Fraud duo flourishes off Lalbazar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two swindlers set up office on RN Mukherjee Road, close to the Lalbazar police headquarters. They cheat a businessman of Rs 5.72 lakh by promising him a bank loan. Before getting away with the money, the duo dupes a nationalised bank by opening an account in the name of the businessman.

 The twin frauds came to light late on Tuesday night, after officers of the detective department arrested the swindlers, Samir Grover and Anil Kumar Bera. 

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department, said Grover was picked up from his Keyatala Lane residence, Ballygunge, and Bera from Shyambazar, in north Calcutta. Grover was the mastermind of the racket.

 Police said Sushanta Banerjee, a realtor in Belghoria, North 24-Parganas, was badly in need of a bank loan. ?He met Grover and Bera last month, and was assured by the two that they would help him obtain the loan against a payment of Rs 1 lakh. Banerjee agreed to pay the amount,? said an officer of the detective department?s anti-fraud section.

 Banerjee handed them all relevant documents, including his trade licence and identity proof. ?In mid-May, Banerjee received a letter from Punjab National Bank?s Old Court House Street branch, stating that he had withdrawn Rs 5.72 lakh from his account. He immediately contacted us and lodged a complaint, saying he had no idea about the money,? the officer said. 

 After conducting an inquiry, the sleuths were convinced that Banerjee was speaking the truth. They went to the office on RN Mukherjee Road, but found it locked. The officers, however, managed to find out the addresses of Grover and Bera and picked them up.

 The two told police that they had approached a finance company, through which the loan amount was disbursed, with fake documents relating to the purchase of a dumper. 

 The company forwarded the papers to the bank and got the loan sanctioned. They were handed over a cheque, which they deposited in the bank after opening an account in Banerjee?s name. ?The duo then withdrew the amount by forging the realtor?s signature,? an officer said.

 The sleuths are yet to recover the money, but deputy commissioner Singh is hopeful that a major part will be recovered. Grover and Bera have been remanded in police custody.

When the screens merge

 Star parade: Ayesha Takia and Fardeen Khan 

in Baa, Bahoo Aur Babytouch me not: Celina Jaitleyface-off: Ruprekha and 

Rex

The screens, big and small, are coming together like 

never before. The latest from the jugalbandi of Vashu Bhagnani and David 

Dhawan, Shaadi No. 1, has gone for an exclusive tie-up with STAR Plus ? 

the film?s stars would appear on the prime-time show Baa, Bahoo Aur Baby.

 The main cast of the crazy comedy will feature in the serial in a lead-up to the Diwali release in the first week of November. And just like in the film, the stars will appear in pairs. Soha Ali Khan and Sharman Joshi will come on the show on October 23, Fardeen Khan and Ayesha Takia on October 28, and finally Zayed Khan and Esha Deol on October 29.

 To make the two storylines collide, the Shaadi No. 1 characters use the house in Baa, Bahoo Aur Baby as their shooting location and naturally hell breaks loose.

 Face-off: Ruprekha and Rex

Rex D?Souza has been saying his prayers, Ruprekha 

Banerjee is consulting her astrologer on what more can be done to make her karma 

better and Qazi Touqueer has been keeping Ramazan despite his hectic schedule. 

With just a couple of days to go for the country?s first Fame Jodi to be announced, 

it?s not surprising that all the three in the fray are refusing to uncross their 

fingers.

 This is also the first time that the country will vote for two of the remaining three at once, rather than just the numero uno. So, people will either be voting for Rex and Ruprekha or Qazi and Ruprekha or Rex and Qazi. Going by the voting trends, it seems the jodis with Qazi in them have a better chance than those with Rex and Ruprekha.

 Voting lines are open and will remain open till 7 am this Thursday. You can still swing things the way you want. To vote for Ruprekha and Qazi SMS ?FJ01? to 2525, for Rex and Ruprekha SMS ?FJ02? to 2525 and for Rex and Qazi SMS ?FJ03? to 2525. You can catch the final episodes of Fame Gurukul on Wednesday and Thursday at 8.30 pm on Sony. 

Chitpur Road with its twists and turns, crowds and 

bazaars, masjids and mandirs, brothels and bookshops and blockmakers of Battala 

is quintessential Calcutta as we have known it over the years. This is the Calcutta 

of the prints of the Daniells, a section of the city that inhabits a space partly 

imaginary, partly mythical.

 Amlan Datta is a young filmmaker who specialised in motion picture photography from FTII, Pune. He made a visually lush, 52-minute-long film titled Everything Remains ? A Film on Chitpur Road in 1998, before the incursion of digital technology. It was screened after a gap of several years at the Max Mueller Bhavan auditorium recently.

 The film does not pretend to tell the history of the road but is more of a montage of impressions of the mired yet fascinating stretch of north Calcutta. Datta is able to convey his sense of awe through some memorable shots of the trams and their overhead wires, the milling crowds, the half shadows in alleys where men toil tirelessly dyeing cloth, the great fruit market, the Nakhoda mosque and the jatra rehearsals. There is nothing ?touristy? or voyeuristic about Amlan?s approach.

 An old, out-of-work prostitute does nothing short of a star turn as she talks at length about better times. The camera wanders into an Armenian church during service and the frame is all light and gold.

 Touch me not: Celina Jaitley

But while the camera captures the mood of the street 

beautifully and also its soundscape, it has been let down by the garbled voice-overs 

and subtitles that are barely grammatical. The background score too does not gel 

at times.

 The structure of the film is somewhat diffuse and occasionally tends to be repetitive. The shots of the dyers and Nakhoda masjid are shown over and over again. Perhaps tighter and ruthless editing would have done the trick. The way it ends is too Ginsbergian, even if it was done unconsciously. Nevertheless, the film does have a magic about it and one forgets the flaws while seeing it in a dark hall.

 If you have read or heard Celina Jaitley screaming 

from every rooftop: ?I was not raped in Bangkok!? incessantly in recent weeks, 

don?t get scared. She hasn?t lost it. Not yet, that is. It?s just that some publications 

in Mumbai got it all wrong. ?I was not even molested,? she clarifies again.

 So why did the hulky bodyguard suddenly pop up at her place?

 ?I am a single lady working in a city like Mumbai and both my parents are working. So it?s only natural that I have someone for security,? Celina explains to Metro.

 Security or no security, Celina is on a signing spree. She herself can?t keep count of all the projects in her kitty. ?There?s the Mughal-e-Azam remake, Tom Dick And Harry, Jawani Diwani, Zinda, two other untitled films and I am forgetting something...,? her voice fades away.

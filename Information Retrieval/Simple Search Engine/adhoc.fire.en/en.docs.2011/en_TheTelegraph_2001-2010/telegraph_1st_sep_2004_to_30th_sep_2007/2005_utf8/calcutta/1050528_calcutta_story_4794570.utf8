 Gemology, aviation hospitality, animation, hotel management ? diverse job options attracting students to The Telegraph Careergraph Live Career Fair 2005 at The Park. By Friday afternoon, the first day of the fair, around 800 visitors had already poured in, taking stock of the variety of career opportunities on offer.

 ?We had students coming to our stall and asking questions around 9.30 am, before the fair had even officially opened. We?ve had quite a few walk-in candidates,? said a spokesperson for Air Hostess Academy. This is the institute?s debut in Calcutta, and the officials were ?satisfied? with the response.

 ?The quality of candidates is about 60:40 ? 60 per cent who will make it as cabin crew, 40 per cent who we can help get jobs in the hospitality industry,? she added. The academy will be launched in Calcutta on June 5.

 While more girls were drawn to the aviation hospitality institutes, jewellery designing drew an equal number of boys. ?We have about 50:50 interest from boys and girls so far,? said a spokesperson at Singem?s stall in Sangam Hall.

 ?We have various courses which attract different types of students. The one where we help them start a small business at home is very popular with young girls. But the gem and jewellery professional diploma, where we provide 100 per cent placement, is popular with men and women,? she added.

 Going abroad for higher education, or studying at a centre affiliated to a foreign institute, is still a favourite, revealed Kusum Bhattacharya of Overseas Consultants. ?We have had a decent response from students. A lot of them are interested in going abroad. We send them to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, etc. Most want to go for courses like MBA and hotel management.?

 Awareness is the key. ?Nowadays, students are much more aware. Earlier, Mumbai and Delhi were the only places where people knew about these professions and were willing to take the opportunities. Now, even Calcutta is moving ahead,? observed the spokesperson for Air Hostess Academy.

 But even if they know less, the youngsters are keen to glean all the information they can get and are willing to experiment. The Arena Multimedia stall had students asking question aplenty on animation and designing courses. Most took down details and promised to drop in at the institute later.

 The fair is on from 9.30 am to 8 pm at The Park till May 29. There will also be seminars on Saturday and Sunday. There are about 30 stalls, including banks providing education loans.

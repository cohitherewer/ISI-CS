 Harry Potter has made youngsters return to reading. But there are others beyond the magic spell cast by the boy wizard. Once you?re through with The Half-Blood Prince, there are more tales of magic and adventure to keep you busy. Young Metro takes a look at some popular children?s sets in print. Grab your copies and get set, go...

 Artemis Fowl

 ?Artemis Fowl had devised a plan? that could topple civilisations and plunge the planet into a cross-species war. He was 12 years old at the time?? Thus began the first Artemis Fowl book, released in 2001. Four years and three more titles later ? The Arctic Incident, The Eternity Code and the latest, Opal Deception, which hit bookshelves in May ? the Fowl series has been one of the few to throw a challenge to Mr Potter in popularity.

 Artemis was born into a wealthy Irish family of criminals. A large part of the fortune was lost when his father was captured by the Russian mafia on a shipping venture. The child prodigy then took it upon himself to regain the fortune. The discovery of a secret world of fairies underground made for the perfect means.

 The Irish creator of the series, 

 Eoin Colfer, was a primary school teacher trying to make 

 it big before the success of Artemis Fowl. The movie 

 adaptation, to be directed by Larry Guterman, has been in 

 limbo for a while with the boy chosen to play Artemis even 

 growing too old for the role.

 His Dark Materials

 This trilogy of children?s novels by British author Philip Pullman appealed to adults at a different level with its multiverse concept where several universes coexist and the characters are able to travel between them.

 The series begins with Lyra, a young girl brought up in a cloistered world of Jordan College in Oxford learning of the existence of a strange elementary particle called Dust. The books ? Northern Lights, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass ? were published between 1995 and 2000 and won numerous awards. 

 Pullman acknowledges as his influences the works of William Blake and John Milton, whose Paradise Lost was the source of the basic ideas of the trilogy. The phrase ?His Dark Materials? also derives from Milton. Pullman?s stated intention was to invert Milton?s story of a war between heaven and hell.

 A film adaptation of Northern 

 Lights is slated for a 2007 release.

 Lemony Snicket

 The man behind A Series of Unfortunate Events may not be pleased to hear this said, but the 11 volumes are delightful in their rather twisted humour. Lemony Snicket, who also appears as a shadowy character in the books, apparently tells the tale of the Baudelaire orphans who fight off the evil intentions of the villainous Count Olaf. But the pen is really wielded by an American by the name of Daniel Handler.

 Starting with The Bad Beginning, the latest release in the line has been The Grim Grotto, with two more apparently to follow.

 The first three books provided 

 the material for the Paramount film called Lemony Snicket?s 

 Series of Unfortunate Events, released in 2004, starring 

 Jim Carrey as Olaf, as well as Meryl Streep and Jude Law.

 The Chronicles of Narnia

 This is an old one. C.S. Lewis?s series of seven fantasy novels was published in the 1950s but have continued to remain a hit with both children and adults. It chronicles the adventures of children who play central roles in unfolding the history of the realm of Narnia, where some animals talk, magic is common and good is fighting evil. 

 The stories also manage to highlight 

 aspects of Christianity in a way accessible to younger children. 

 A film version of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 

 (the first book of the series published in 1950) is in production, 

 directed by Andrew Adamson and being shot in New Zealand.

 Screen saver

 Till date, the first three books have been made into movies with the fourth, Goblet of Fire, in production. Philosopher?s Stone (2001) and Chamber of Secrets (2002) were directed by Chris Columbus, while Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) was by Alfonso Cuaron. All three of the movies were among the top 10 grossing films of their year. 

 Goblet of Fire, directed by Mike Newell, is slated for release in November this year, while Order of the Phoenix, to be directed by David Yates, is expected around spring or fall of 2007.

 Each movie has been followed by a video game, released across various platforms like PlayStation, Xbox, GameCube and the PC. Besides the titles based on the books, there has been another game spun off the series, The Quidditch World Cup.

 While the first two games put the player in Potter?s shoes, the third allowed the gamer to assume the roles of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as well. The game version of Goblet of Fire was announced in April this year. 

 There will be a new spell-casting system allowing collaborative spells and the characters are supposed to resemble their movie counterparts more closely than previous games.

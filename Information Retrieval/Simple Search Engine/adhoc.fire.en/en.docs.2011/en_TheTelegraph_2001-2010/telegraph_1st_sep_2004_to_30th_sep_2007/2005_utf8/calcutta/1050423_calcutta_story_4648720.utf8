 Green gripe brake on build plans 

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Construction of a large housing estate in east Calcutta has come to a halt, adding fuel to the raging debate over the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s decision to allow housing projects on the land of closed industrial units.

 Officials at the West Bengal Pollution Control Board said on Friday that they had stopped construction on April 5 of a high-end housing estate on a large tract earlier owned by the ailing, state-run Tyre Corporation of India, on complaints from influential CPM leaders.

 ?We are surprised at the development, because we purchased the tract, measuring nearly 50 bighas, for building a housing estate, our first in Calcutta,? said S.K. Kothari, a Madhya Pradesh-based developer. 

 Kothari?s firm, Mahakosh Property Developers, bought the land reportedly for Rs 28 crore under an order from the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), which is overseeing the revival of Tyre Corporation. ?Now, we are told to refrain from construction on environmental and other grounds,? Kothari added.

 Dropping the spanner into Mahakosh?s housing plans are influential local CPM leaders like Badal Kar and Snehanshu Roy, who belong to a sizeable chunk of intra-CPM critics of the Bhattacharjee government?s initiative of unlocking land of closed units for housing stocks. 

 ?I do not deny that I am opposed to the housing project,? said Kar, also leader of the Citu-controlled Tyre Corporation Employees? Union. ?I wrote to the government and also to the pollution control board, asking them to stop Kothari from changing the nature of the land, ruining the local economy and killing the greenery,? he admitted.

 The Tyre Corporation impasse and Kar?s intransigence come at a time when the Bhattacharjee government has identified a few thousand acres of unused industrial land in Calcutta, where demand for housing is soaring, forcing developers to knock on the government?s door. But many CPM and Citu leaders want the government to use such land only for the purpose of industrial activity. 

 The pollution control board has asked Kothari not to go ahead with his plans ?without obtaining permission from it and by changing the land character?. 

 Kothari told Metro on Friday that he hoped to obtain the requisite clearances within the next few months.

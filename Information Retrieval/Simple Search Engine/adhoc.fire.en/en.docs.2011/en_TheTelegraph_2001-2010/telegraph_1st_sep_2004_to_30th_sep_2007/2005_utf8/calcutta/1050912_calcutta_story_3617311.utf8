It is a novel effort to promote a new generation of 

young designers, models and choreographers.

 The Westside Lux Body Wash Style Showdown, in association with MTV, travels to eight cities where winners get the opportunity to showcase their talents.

 Creative, vibrant and glamorous, the ensembles defined the dynamic ideas of 20 city colleges participating in the preliminary round of the Calcutta contest at the plush Bhawanipur College auditorium on September 8.

 Fashion photographer Rajesh Gupta and Heena Gorsia, fashion designer-cum-cultural-head of the Bhawanipur group of colleges, were the judges for the day.

 The contest that included rounds like casual wear, club wear, sports and denim was a showcase of talent and innovation.

 Eight colleges were declared winners on the basis of style quotient, choreography, choice of music, hairdo, make-up and overall presentation.

 No matter how strong you are in one aspect, the overall impact has to be impressive. After all, fashion is a combination of creativity and wearability. It is overwhelming to see the artistic perception and insight of colleges not directly related to fashion, quot; smiled Heena.

 The eight short-listed colleges will meet in the final showdown on September 16 at Science City. 

 The panel of judges would include choreographer Achla Sachdev, MTV VJ Rannvijay and a local celebrity.

 Choosing eight from the 20 was difficult. It was a very good effort all together and these budding talents are sure to have a bright future ahead of them, said Rajesh.

 To add to the fun, the event includes Lux Body Wash Style Gurus, where participants design their own T-shirts and the winning design is retailed across all Westside stores of the country.

 And if this is not enough, the MTV Style Makeover will choose four winners from across the country who will be given a makeover by the VJs for the coming episodes of MTV Style Makeover.

 Sparkle time

 It took the world of art by storm during the 1920s and plays an integral part in influencing jewellery patterns associated with ornate styles even today. 

 Art Deco as it called is the latest influence for a collection of exclusive studded jewellery from Mumbai at Diagold.

 The festive mood has already set in and it is time for women to indulge in great buys. Being within the city, I want my customers to enjoy variety and quality, says Varda Goenka of Diagold.

 The collection is an assortment of neckpieces with long cascading pendants, chandelier earrings, chokers and heavy bracelets in gold or white metal with embellishments in precious and semi-precious stones adding to the glitter. 

 The intricate designs draw inspiration from Cartier and Bulgari and are suitable choices for traditional and western wear.

 I have used a lot of fun and colour. Bold designs and wearability on a day-to-day basis are two vital aspects of the collection, claims Priti Patel, designer of the jewellery line. 

 Rings embedded with aquamarines, red rubies, emeralds and pearls are worth a look.

 Todays contemporary woman wants to go in for buys that are not only confined to bank lockers. The collection keeps in mind the fact that accessories should add that spark to your personality and help make personal fashion statements, adds Varda.

 The prices start at Rs 10,000.

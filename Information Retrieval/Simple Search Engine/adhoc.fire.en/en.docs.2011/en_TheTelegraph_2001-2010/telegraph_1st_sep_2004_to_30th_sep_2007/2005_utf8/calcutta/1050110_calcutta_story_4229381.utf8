The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The other side of midnight

 Midnight revellers get into the groove at Shisha. Pictures by Rashbehari Das, Pabitra Das and Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 They are the ones who are meant to make their presence felt without being overbearing, to build a personal rapport with guests while maintaining a professional distance, set the mood for the night and yet not lose themselves to it. They, in fact, are the people who define the place.

Himika Chaudhuri and Zeeshan Jawed go 

nightspot hopping to know the managers who make Calcutta the party place that 

it is. Wait for the rest...

Shisha

Manager: Sovon Mukherjee

Age: 30 

Experience: A hotel management graduate, Sovon?s 

first brush with real-time hospitality began with a four-month stint as industrial 

trainee in Taj Bengal. A five-year job at The Park followed. International exposure 

in the form of assignments across West Asia ? Dubai, Kuwait and Bahrain ? brought 

him back closer home, this time to the biggest Indian restaurant in Bangladesh. 

Sovon joined Grain of Salt in 2002, and became the man behind the launch of the 

first ever hookah bar in the city in September 2003.

USP: His impeccable PR skills. Doesn?t forget 

to check on every guest even on packed New Year?s Eve.

The toughest ask: ?To tackle the difficult 

people who I can?t allow inside the nightclub because they don?t fit the profile, 

but who flaunt ?contacts?. Talking them into leaving the place without being rude 

or causing a commotion is never easy.?

Salaam Calcutta: ?Most of the party people 

of Calcutta are really well-mannered. I have had guests from other cities, and 

in most cases their attitude has been very putting off.?

Red Kitchen and Lounge

Manager: Nitin Kumar Jha

Age: 33

Experience: With 12 years of experience, of 

which 11 years were with the Taj group, Jha decided to take up the challenge of 

running a new place. He joined this plush restaurant and lounge in Alipore six 

months ago and has since been striving to make this a sought-after night address.

USP: Guest is god. ?Once a guest enters my 

place, everyone is equally important to me, a young executive or a Bollywood biggie.?

The toughest ask: ?I enjoy every bit of my 

job, and nothing is difficult.?

Salaam Calcutta: ?The party people of Calcutta 

are bored of the elite style of sophisticated partying; they now want to chill 

out in their home clothes after a hard day?s work. That?s why lounging will be 

the partying style of tomorrow.?

Cloud 9

Manager: Paul Biswas

Age: 35 

Experience: A science graduate, it was an effort 

to give medical studies a miss and come into the hotel industry. 

 Years of working in Kathmandu and three-and-a-half years in Abu Dhabi triggered an urge to get back home. 

 And Cloud 9 happened. Part of the team that rolled out the first resto bar in the city, Paul now is a vital cog in the city?s nightlife wheel.

USP: Never in the forefront but in total control.

The toughest ask: ?To retain guests. With so 

many options available to the party animals, holding their interest is a big challenge.?

Salaam Calcutta: ?The night crowd of the city 

has become younger and less elite. The younger crowd has fleeting interests and 

it?s difficult to transform them into loyal customers, unlike the earlier elite 

set that would stick to a place.?

Big Ben 

Manager: Subir Das

Age: 31

Experience: He joined Kenilworth as an assistant 

trainee steward after completing his hotel management from IIHM.

USP: His cheerful disposition and his height 

make him a hit with his guests.

The toughest ask: ?Though I chose this profession, 

it leaves me with very little time to spend with my family.?

Salaam Calcutta: ?Till a couple of years ago, 

the party crowd was small. You saw the same faces everywhere. The circuit has 

grown immensely since then. And with many more nightclubs and lounges coming up, 

there is place for people of all tastes.?

Prince of Cal

Manager: Subhabrata Dutta

Age: 29

Experience: He was managing Anticlock which 

was the most happening place in town when there were not many options available. 

 He was also there for the Winning Streak start-up and helped set up the first nightclub in Dhaka.

USP: Unflappable.

The toughest ask: ?People have a lot of expectations 

from us because we have a celebrity associated with us. These expectations leave 

very little room for errors. I really have to be on my toes to satisfy people.?

Salaam Calcutta: ?The most encouraging part 

is that people have started coming in with their family and friends.?

Fusion 

Manager: Ramnik Kaur Sabharwal

Experience: She has been around with The Golden 

Park for close to three years now. She was heading the sales and marketing team 

when the idea of opening Fusion came up. 

 She got involved with the planning and execution, and ended up heading the nightclub, too.

USP: Her very matter-of-fact approach

The toughest ask: ?Starting the place is easy? 

But the most difficult part is managing the people who are actively involved in 

the day-to-day running of the place. I really have to be strict with my subordinates 

so that complacency does not creep in.?

Salaam Calcutta: ?The profile of the crowd 

has really deteriorated. You hardly see a family coming in. Anybody who can shell 

out a couple of thousand of rupees can walk into a nightclub and do whatever he 

wants to.?

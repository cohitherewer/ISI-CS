 Contract to kill plus trade hub realty bounty

 - Savoury chain-owner?s unsavoury crime links

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, the owner of Haldiram?s chain of confectioneries, not only issued a supari of Rs 6 lakh to eliminate tea stall-owner Satyanarayan Thakur, but also promised Gopal Tiwari, the contract killer, the go-ahead for constructing three buildings in the Burrabazar-Posta area, police said on Wednesday.

 And Tiwari agreed to carry out the first contract killing in his career because he was desperately trying to come back and settle in the city.

 ?Tiwari left the city and settled in Hyderabad three years ago after police launched a massive hunt for him. He accepted Agarwal?s offer because he wanted to return to his old domain,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of detective department. ?Apart from the cash, the deal of constructing buildings in one of the city?s busiest business zones was a bonus offer for him.?

 During the course of Agarwal?s interrogation at the Lalbazar headquarters, police came to know that Tiwari had visited Agarwal?s apartment on Kalakar Street twice in the third week of March. ?Agarwal knew Tiwari was the gangster who dominated the Burrabazar-Posta area. So, he contacted him through Tiwari?s henchman Arun Khandelwal,? said Singh.

 The final deal was clinched after Satyanarayan turned down Rs 4 lakh that Agarwal had offered him to vacate the house in Jagmohan Mullick Lane, where he planned to construct a highrise. 

 ?Agarwal told Tiwari he wanted a long-term relationship with him,? said a policeman, adding: ?Tiwari assured him help because he wanted to leave Hyderabad and emerge as a realtor in the city.?

 Tiwari gave Agarwal the numbers of his six mobile phones. ?They were in constant touch before and after the attack. After the deal was settled, Agarwal told Tiwari to execute the contract of eliminating Satyanarayan as early as possible,? said the officer.

 Elaborating on Tiwari?s first assignment to kill on March 30, a detective department source said Satyanarayan?s nephew Pramod had a lucky escape for ?in his extortion business, Tiwari was a smooth operator. But in this case, he committed a number of mistakes?. 

 During interrogation, Tiwari said he and his accomplices went on a drinking binge from midnight. ?They then went to a red-light area in north Calcutta and spent the night watching mujra because they did not want to fall asleep. They wanted to strike early in the morning,? an officer quoted Tiwari as saying.

 Around 5 am, Tiwari and two accomplices reached Satyanarayan?s tea stall and dismantled a mosquito net on the pavement, expecting their target to be inside.

 ?Pramod, who was asleep, woke up when Tiwari and his men surrounded him. He tried to flee but could not because a bullet pierced his right thigh,? said an officer. Then, Tiwari and his men fled to their hideout in Liluah.

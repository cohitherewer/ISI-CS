 With the current boom in the airlines industry, job opportunities are flying high. But while it gives students with plenty of choices, the challenge is to provide quality training.

 Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training has been educating cabin crew in over 40 centres in 31 cities across India. Apart from the basic course, it teaches students inside an Airbus A-300. And soon, there will also be in-flight instruction on a major domestic airline.

 The Airbus, leased by Frankfinn in November 2004, is parked in New Delhi, where students from every centre are taken for a five-day period. For six hours a day, the 30-hour module includes training in emergency procedures like ditching an aircraft, life jackets, oxygen masks and escape routes, exposure to passenger service units, door operation and meal service, besides an overview of cockpit and cargo units. 

 The is one module in the 500-hour aviation hospitality and travel management course for cabin crew aspirants at Frankfinn. ?This gives the students a feeling of being there,? explains Rakesh Agarwal, managing director of Frankfinn.

 ?Private airlines provide their crew with training anyway. But with this experience, our students are able to handle it better, because they have an idea of the real thing,? he adds.

 In addition to the Airbus training, the institute has also tied up with a domestic airline for in-flight experience for students. ?That will be towards the end of the course. We haven?t started it yet, but we will send our first batch soon,? says the managing director.

 Trends in the civil aviation industry in India and the rest of the region (West, South and Southeast Asia) prove that it is fast emerging as a hub. As a result of the expansion, the demand for Indian cabin crew, especially air hostesses, has taken off. There is already a ?huge spurt in the demand?.

 Many foreign airlines have made it mandatory to have Indian air hostesses or stewards well-acquainted with Indian and global passengers, says a Frankfinn spokesperson. Some of the airlines asking for Indian women as cabin crew are Malaysia Airlines, Cathay Pacific, the UAE-based Etihad Airways, Yemen Airways, Singapore Airlines and Royal Jordanian. Several have already been recruited by these airlines, with salaries of up to Rs 18 lakh.

 ?We have all at some point come 

 across the glamourous image of an air hostess or flight 

 steward greeting passengers onboard. So powerful is the 

 image that the ever-smiling face of an air hostess has come 

 to represent the epitome of hospitality, glamour and the 

 ultimate fantasy of flying and seeing the world,? said Bindu 

 Ramachandran, senior aviation faculty of Frankfinn.

 Search 

 for the songs

 The songs had only flown, 

 The heavens were not touched 

 By their melodies. 

 Maybe because they lacked desire 

 To break free, 

 And discard those hollow rhythms 

 That beat tunelessly. 

 Some had just conquered the clouds, 

 Others had failed even that 

 Soaked in doubts. 

 Waves of time had finally 

 Swept them away. 

 Our Earth is very jealous, 

 All the true songs 

 She has hidden in her soil, 

 And her lungs. 

 For the lonely poet who longs.

 Kaleidoscope

 What a wonderful world there is, 

 Inside a kaleidoscope! 

 Unfolding the true mysteries of life, 

 Showing the path with a ray of hope. 

 The whirling patterns of VIBGYOR, 

 Inspire us to follow our dreams, 

 The tinsel glasses changing colour, 

 Like the blue-watered flowing stream. 

 See a miracle window open, 

 To check the flow of views. 

 Innocent as the winter rain, 

 And grasses with the silver dew. 

 The eyes see a magnificent sight, 

 Of a future beautifully bright.

 Whats 

 on your mind this week

 Film fancy

 Art 

 is a result of creative expression. There is no denying 

 the popularity of cinema as an agent of art in modern times.The 

 cycle of the world film industry does not reach a completion 

 without the prestigious film festivals that are held around 

 the globe. But it is really disheartening to see the media 

 indulging in the unnecessary details of an actress 

 wardrobe rather than focussing on the films to be screened. 

 A case in point is the recent Cannes Film Festival where 

 people were more interested in speculating upon the clothing 

 worn by Mallika Sherawat and Ashs footwear rather 

 than celebrating the screening of Panther Panchali after 

 50 years. This growing tendency seems to trivialise the 

 true essence of these film festivals and belittles their 

 grandeur. It is high time the media stopped being so nonchalant 

 about the gradual derogation of film festivals from criticism 

 and art to mere vehicles to display accessories and hair 

 colour.

 Foot fault 

 Calcutta football is experiencing an all-time low this 

 season. In the National Football League, defending champion 

 East Bengal could manage only a face-saving third spot, 

 while another former champion, Mohun Bagan, is thanking 

 its lucky stars in shameless elation over barely managing 

 to overcome a relegation threat. Tollygunje Agragami, contrary 

 to its name, is languishing at the bottom of the table. 

 One-time city giant, Mohammedan Sporting, is out of the 

 reckoning. In sharp contrast to the Goa teams, the big names 

 of Bengal, except East Bengal to a certain extent, lack 

 a scientific and professional approach towards the game. 

 They have been giving precedence to sentiment and emotion 

 over a systematic game-plan and the obvious result is near 

 to nil success. The Mohun Bagan boat is caught in the bogs 

 of Bengal. It is too difficult for it to tackle the travails 

 of a voyage through the creeks of corruption. Can we dare 

 to pin our hopes on Everready?

 Tiger travail

 The big cat is fast getting into the list of extinct animals. 

 Government attempts at tiger conservation have come too 

 late. At least 18 of 47 tigers were found missing in Ranthambore. 

 Their complete absence in Sariska Park has awakened the 

 Rajasthan government. Even Madhya Pradesh is getting into 

 the queue. Tourists have been restricted in Ranthambore 

 and Jim Corbett to ensure that there is no big cat hunting. 

 The future of the Royal Bengal tiger is also dubious due 

 to the population increase, resulting in agricultural expansion, 

 new roads and dams. Tigers are being poached for skin, claws, 

 bones and meat. A CBI probe is on. Deforestation may be 

 the root cause. One can visit the zoo to see a tiger, but 

 would it really be wild?

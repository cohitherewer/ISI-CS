 Ramoji Film City: In the Guinness files

 Record setting

 Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad has another feather to add to its fast-filling cap ? it has been certified by the Guinness World Records as the ?largest film studio complex in the world?. Measuring all of 1,666 acres with 47 sound stages, it?s no surprise. Ramoji Film City started up in 1996. Since, many film-makers, Indian and international, have availed of its services. 

 There are pre-production, production and post-production facilities like set construction, properties, costumes, shooting stages, camera and equipment, lights audio and digital FX facilities, film processing lab, accommodation and travel services. Besides, the hills, fountains, gardens and theme parks have also become tourist attractions.

 Grab a camera phone, make a film and become an award-winning cellphone film-maker. Discovery Networks Asia and Nokia are providing a platform for cellphone users to make mobile films. The companies have partnered to launch the Mobile First Time Film-makers Contest 2005, with a grand prize of $10,000. 

 To participate in the contest, send in a photo or a video no longer than nine seconds and a brief description of a favourite icon that best defines the values and hopes of your community, and how this will be presented in a short mobile film. The icon can be anything that highlights the importance of a particular community, such as an old shop in an alley that holds many memories, a vintage car, or even a childhood game ? something that conveys the significance of the community. 

 Contestants can also send in storyboards to support their entries. The contest, which started on August 1, is open to all those aged 18 and above in several countries, including India. 

 For more information, log on to www.mobifilms.net. Entries can be submitted through the website, or through the Mobile Filmmaker mobile gallery that can be downloaded to selected Nokia cellphones (N90, 6680, 6681, 6630, 6670, 7610 and 6600) from www.nokia-asia.com or the nokia. com bookmark on the phone. The last date for submissions is September 4. 

 Fifteen applicants will be shortlisted and flown to Singapore in September to attend a workshop organised by Discovery Networks Asia, where they will learn more about mobile film-making techniques. They will each receive a Nokia N90, to shoot and submit their final entries. But before the workshop, contestants can get tips on mobile film-making via the Mobile Film-maker gallery. 

 Natasha Bedingfield: Shaken, not stirred

 There?s another new Bond girls on the block, but not on the big screen. British singing sensation Natasha Bedingfield has lent her likeness and voice to the game version of From Russia With Love. Electronic Arts has signed her on to make a cameo appearance in the latest James Bond video game, due for worldwide release later this year. 

 The New Zealand-born London-raised singer, who made it big with her debut single These words, will appear as Elizabeth Stark, daughter of England?s Prime Minister. In the game, Miss Stark is kidnapped and must be rescued by James Bond. Bedingfield will appear alongside Sir Sean Connery, who is reprising his role in the game. ?I am thrilled,? was her reaction to the ?honour? of being a Bond girl and featuring alongside Connery.

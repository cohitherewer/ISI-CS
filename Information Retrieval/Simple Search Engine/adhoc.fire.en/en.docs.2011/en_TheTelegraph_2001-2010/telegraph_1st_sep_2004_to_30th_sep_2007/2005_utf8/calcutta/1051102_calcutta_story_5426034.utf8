 Red-light kids have a school

 - BRINGING CHEER TO UNDERPRIVILEGED

 Students of St John?s Diocesan School rehearse with Alokananda Roy for the fundraiser ballet this month-end

 When the world was marking Millennium in 2000, the students of St John?s Diocesan School were raising funds for HIV-positive children in the city. Five years on, girls at the 111-year-old school on 17, Sarat Bose Road, are working hard to put on track another venture that would have done its founders, the Clewer Sisters of the convent of John the Baptist, proud.

 ?We are starting a branch of St John?s Diocesan School-cum-night shelter for children of sex workers in the Sonagachhi area and another branch at Bedford Lane (off Ripon Street) for underprivileged children,? declares principal Rosita Chrestien.

 Start-up funds for the twin projects would be raised through a ballet, She Walked With Jesus ? ?a Gnostic commemoration of Mary Magdalene, a celebration of love and sacrifice?, to be performed by school students on November 30 at the Netaji Indoor Stadium.

 Conceptualised by Chrestien herself, the ballet has been choreographed by noted Odissi exponent Alokananda Roy, with the script written by Soumi Sengupta, an ex-student and now teacher at St John?s Diocesan.

 The Sonagachhi branch, to be flagged off in January 2006 (?This will be our New Year celebration?) in a two-room temporary shelter in the red-light area, will be later shifted to the proposed multi-storeyed market complex that will be built where the dilapidated Allen Market now stands.

 ?We have been assured by local MP Sudhanshu Sil that space for the school-cum-night shelter will be provided inside the new municipal market complex, to come up off Rabindra Sarani,? the principal says. ?However, we want to get started with whatever enrolment we can muster, at least the pre-primary section, in the New Year.?

 Talented girl students from the ?special-service, non-profit? branch in the red-light area will be absorbed in the main school, the management promises. For the Diocesan students now matching steps with Alokananda Roy in rehearsal for the Mary Magdalene show, social service is hardly an alien concept, though.

 ?Members of our Interact Club regularly visit the old-age homes like Mulvany House, St Joseph?s Home, Shanti Niwas, distributing bedsheets, toiletries, night dresses and food items,? says Sengupta, the school spokesperson.

 To bring a little cheer to the lives of children living in the Pyara Bagan slum on Sarat Bose Road on Diwali, the students brought them crackers, sweets and woollens. The Interact Club has also pledged to help the family of the late Bapi Sen and his elder son?s education is being partly funded.

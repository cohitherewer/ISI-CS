 Clear clutter on the table 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui doesn rsquo;t recommend piling up books on the study table as this lowers the energy level of the person and also pressurises the mind for undone work. But in case one has to stack up books on the table, it is advisable to do so on the left side, keeping the centre and the right side clear

Q: I am pursuing my masters right now and hence have to read a lot. I always pile up books on my study table. Is this in accordance with Feng Shui rules? 

 Samanta

 THE SOLUTION: Never pile up books in front of you on your desk. If your desktop is stacked high with books and if you feel lazy to put them back in their respective places, then at least keep the centre and right side of the table clear and pile them on the left.

 Centre is the Tai Chi area from where energy radiates in all directions. While the left is considered to be your past, the right is your future. So, it is best to brighten your future by keeping the right side clear.

 Too many books piled up on the table will not only lower your energy level, but will also pressurise your mind for undone work.

 Fire fiasco

 Q: My husband is in the army and hence we keep shifting from one city to the other. My daughter (DOB July 20, 1990, 7.45 pm) was doing very well before we moved to Calcutta. Earlier she always used to get above 90 per cent marks, but now her marks have slipped into the 70 per cent zone. Her study room is in the south and more towards the south-eastern side. Please suggest ways of improving her grades.

 Sahani

 THE SOLUTION: According to your daughters pillars of destiny, she is a strong fire person and needs to be placated with earth and metal elements. Water is equally important to keep a check on her excessive fire element.

 The southern and the south-eastern part of the house are ruled by fire and wood energy. This further aggravates the fire element in her. So, move her to a room in the north, north-east or west.

 According to her kua number, north-east is connected with her personal development and she must study facing this direction. She should keep a small bowl of salt filled till the brim on the north-east of her study table. This will help absorb negatives that are bringing her grades down.

 Career course

 Q: I am a computer professional and would like to know about my career prospects and my future. My date of birth is June 30, 1979. I do my professional as well as academic work in my study-cum-office where I have kept the computer. What will be the right position for the computer table and the bookshelf? Also, should I keep any animal symbol with me?

 Ritesh Jaiswal

 THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny reveal that you are a strong earth person with two elements of fire to support you. 

 Fire represents educational qualification for you and since you were born in mid-summer when the fire element is at its peak, you should have a very bright academic career.

 Your lifestyle will change from 2007, but you will be at the peak of your career from 2011. 

 You should earn your wealth from media, communication and software designing. 

 Your zodiac animal sign is the ram and you can enhance your intuitive powers by placing a figure of this animal in the north-east of your study table. 

 You should place your computer table in the north or north-east of the room and face north while working. Do up your study in a blend of blue and green to enhance your intelligence, wealth and prosperity.

 Mirror mayhem

 Q: I have heard that two mirrors placed opposite each other in the bedroom create discord between a couple. Is this true according to Feng Shui?

 Name and address withheld

 THE SOLUTION: Mirrors are considered to be very powerful tools in Feng Shui and placing them wrong can work adversely.

 It is best to avoid mirrors in the bedroom and having two mirrors opposite each other only worsens the condition. An arrangement where the bed is sandwiched between two mirrors creates mayhem. 

 This is because the energy that circulates in the room keeps moving between the two mirrors and cannot move further. Such clashing energy has a bad impact on the lives of the residing couple.

 It leads to conflict and misunderstandings that can prove dangerous to marital life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mama mia! 11 days of pure Italy

 SUBHRO SAHA

 A wine-tasting evening, followed by traditional Tuscan cuisine and truffles from Piemont. The magic of Florence or Rome, contemporary couture from Milan and of course soccer wizardry?

 Want to savour a slice of Italy in Calcutta? No problemo. ?Festa Italiana 2005?, an 11-day extravaganza (November 20 to 30) organised by the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry (IICCI), will showcase the Mediterranean nation in all its resplendence.

 To be held simultaneously in Calcutta, Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai and Chennai, the Festa will feature fashion, wine and food, design and architecture, jewellery, art and culture, education, publishing, automotive design, film, travel, business and finance.

 The piece de resistance of the city bouquet will be the AC Milan under-18 side, boosted by their Brazilian star Leonardo, taking on the Bengal under-21 squad in Salt Lake stadium on November 23. 

 ?We are extremely excited, since in Italy, football stars are like gods, they are opinion-makers, just like cricket stars are in India,? Andre Bonardi, secretary-general of the chamber, told Metro from Mumbai.

 As part of the gala, ENIT ? the Italian state tourist board ? will hold a road show (at The Park) in Calcutta on November 28, to be attended by a delegation of 15 Italian tour operators and hoteliers. 

 A seminar, ?Italy ? one jewel, many facets?, will be followed by an interactive workshop with ?80 to 100? Indian operators.

 ?This will ensure mutual promotion of holiday packages and other services offered by Italian operators. We are expecting representatives from Rome, Vicenza, Genoa and Florence, who will focus on the various elements that make Italy a great travel destination for Indians,? said Ianniello Salvatore, ENIT representative in India.

 On the food front, crack chef David will conduct cooking classes and hold a workshop on November 23 at Hyatt Regency, from 11 am, while on November 27, a wine-tasting evening at the same venue will be followed by a wine dinner. 

 Efforts are also on to bring star DJ Andrea Vigna and VJ Roberto Dellosco, according to Pankaj Parekh, IICCI?s eastern region chairman.

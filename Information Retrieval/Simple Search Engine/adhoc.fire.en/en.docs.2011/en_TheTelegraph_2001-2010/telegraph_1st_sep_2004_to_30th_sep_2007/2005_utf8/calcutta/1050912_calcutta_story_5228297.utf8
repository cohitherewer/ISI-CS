The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Feast of fun formula, for a few laughs more

Screen On amp; Off

Slapstick to subtle, adult to adulterous, comedies have 

got Bollywood laughing all the way to the box-office. And this is only the beginning, 

writes Pratim D. Gupta

Entry

When Anil Kapoor said his brother Boney would be able 

to clear off all his debts with just one movie, he knew what he was talking about. 

With better collections than newer releases, the Boney-produced multistarrer No 

Entry is on its way to becoming one of the biggest blockbusters of the year 

and it?s raking in the moolah in the overseas markets, too.

No Entry is the latest addition to a string 

of big Bollywood hits that has made 2005 one of the better years for the film 

industry which has largely been an extended flop show in the preceding years. 

While many feel it?s just law of averages catching up with tinsel town, trade 

pundits are attributing the success to the multiplex crowd?s growing affinity 

towards light, frothy and funny fare.

?Comedy is definitely the flavour of the season,? 

asserts director Sangeeth Sivan, whose Kya Kool Hai Hum started the trend 

earlier this year. ?With so many thrillers, a spate of sex films and action movies 

around, people have found respite in comedies. They just want to be entertained 

but that entertainment should not be mentally stimulating. Also, humour is liked 

by the entire family.?

With families flocking to halls to enjoy a few laughs 

together, the block bookings have translated into big successes in little time. 

This is after the films have opened to a packed first weekend thanks to the stars 

sizzling in the cast and out of the posters. Says No Entry director Anees 

Bazmee, who has written most of David Dhawan?s hit comedies: ?Treatment is the 

most important factor when you are making a comedy. A scene can be funny if handled 

properly but the same can turn out to be flat if you consider other things like 

giving equal footage to stars.?

Bazmee?s No Entry is also part of the comic 

sub-genre that was born in Bollywood with Indra Kumar?s Masti ? straying 

husbands cheating on wives and finally realising the value of the institution 

of marriage. Dhawan?s forthcoming Diwali release Shaadi No. 1 falls in 

the same bracket where three husbands (again!) go fishing beyond wedlock.

Dhawan has already tasted success this year with his 

take on Cactus Flower, Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya, setting the 

cash registers ringing despite leading man Salman Khan?s late-night phone chats. 

In situations rather than plots and jokes rather than scenes, punctuated with 

some phoren naach-gaana, Dhawan has found his new fun formula which brought 

him back in the reckoning last year with Mujhse Shaadi Karoge.

Quite a contrast to this form of humour is the more 

subtle and sophisticated package that producer Aditya Chopra brings to his brand 

of comedy. Starting with the Harry Met Sally rehash Hum Tum last 

year, the Chopras have dished out the record-breaking con-on-the-road comedy Bunty 

Aur Babli in June this year, and now they have given a desi twist to 

Nine Months in Salaam Namaste. Up next from the Yash Raj banner 

is another fun ride, the Arjun Sablok-directed Neil ?N? Nikki, starring 

Uday Chopra and Tanisha.

Equally at ease with slapstick (Hungama and 

Hulchul) and situational (Hera Pheri) comedies is director Priyadarshan, 

who is making another laugh riot in Garam Masala, starring Akshay Kumar 

and John Abraham. Akshay, who?s found a fresh lease of life with his funny bone, 

feels that Indian audiences are finally ready to laugh at subtle humour. ?Hera 

Pheri was not accepted initially but received all the appreciation after a 

few weeks. So apart from good comedies being made, the audience taste is also 

getting refined,? the actor feels.

Like all Bollywood success stories, the comic recipe 

is also being repeated. While Hera Pheri and Awara Pagal Deewana have 

got their own sequels in Phir Hera Pheri and Deewane Huye Pagal, 

directors like Sangeeth Sivan and Indra Kumar are making comedies again. ?Can 

I make anything else now?? asks Sivan, who?s planning a 12-member ensemble comedy 

called Money Money Money for Subhash Ghai?s Mukta Arts. Indra Kumar is 

repeating the Kya Kool Hai Hum cast of Riteish Deshmukh and Tusshar Kapoor 

for his next comedy Dhamaal.

Even the master of the underworld and the badshah 

of horror, Ram Gopal Varma, is producing a comedy in the Antara Mali-penned 

Mr Ya Miss about a man?s mind trapped in a woman?s body. And if you are 

still not convinced that comedy is on song, Sujoy Ghosh?s latest jhankaar beat 

is the 21-song fun rollercoaster Home Delivery.

Keep laughing.

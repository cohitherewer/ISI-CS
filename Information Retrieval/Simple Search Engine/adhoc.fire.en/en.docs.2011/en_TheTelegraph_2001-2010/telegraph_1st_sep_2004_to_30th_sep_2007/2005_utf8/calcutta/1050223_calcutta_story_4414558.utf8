The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Back with Black

Settling down for a chat, you wonder whether Dhritiman 

Chaterji (picture by Reshmi Sengupta) is as arrogant as his screen persona, Mr 

Paul McNaully, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black. He seems withdrawn, even 

a tad snooty perhaps. As the talk meanders from one thing to the other, you realise 

the salt-and-pepper man who debuted as the scrawny, frustrated youth in Satyajit 

Ray?s Pratidwandi some 35 summers ago has actually cut himself off 

from the trappings of showbiz and immersed himself in various creative avenues. 

 Chaterji has pursued advertising, made films for television and now does English theatre in Chennai, which he finds challenging and a pleasure. 

 But wasn?t a promising film career just waiting to take off had he chosen not to swerve towards advertising? ?I have worked in films that I have found interesting. I was never really enamoured of mainstream films; I have always been wary of them,? says the flashy, exuberant youth of Aparna Sen?s 36 Chowringhee Lane, now working for her 15, Park Avenue.

 ?I have seen my contemporaries who chose to make a career in cinema and then had to do all kinds of films, whether they liked them or not. I was also wary of becoming a prisoner, of having to live up to the image of an actor. That would have curtailed my personal freedom,? he explains.

 Though acting was never there on Chaterji?s agenda, Ray cast him in Ganashatru and Agantuk. In between, there were Mrinal Sen?s Padatik and Akaler Sandhane. But both associations go a long way.

 Jogging his memory, Chaterji says: ?We (he and a few friends) were setting up the film society at Delhi University. That was the time when the film society movement had just started. I was trying to get in touch with people like Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen. I met Ray in Calcutta. Sometime later, he was looking for a fresh face for Pratidwandi. A friend of mine who knew him suggested that he take a look at me,? recounts Chaterji, then an economics MA student.

 ?I agreed because I wanted to see Ray at work. My eagerness was not so much to make it as an actor; I was more interested in the film-making process,? he adds, having accompanied Ray to the editing table and the recording studio.

 Even after he shifted base to Chennai 15 years ago, interesting projects have sought Chaterji out. Ashoke Viswanathan?s Shunyo Theke Shuru, Moloy Bhattacharya?s Kahini, Jane Campion?s Holy Smoke (co-starring Kate Winslet), Jagmohan Mundhra?s The Perfumed Garden and The Badger, an adaptation of a Jug Suraiya story... ?The Badger had a South African director and a Spanish editor. It was screened in Los Angeles,? he says.

 But we must thank Mr Bhansali for scooping you out of hibernation, one asks and waits. ?I found Black interesting,? he says. ?Originally, when we talked about the film and I had read the script, it was supposed to be in English. One of the reasons I was drawn to it. For Sanjay, Black was a departure. He wanted to do it with non-Bollywood people. But Black had a very on-the-edge kind of feel; a highly charged mood pervaded the entire film. With Ray and Sen, one had to be more realistic,? Chaterji stresses.

 And how was it working with Amitabh Bachchan? ?In a way, it?s no different than acting with any other good actor,? he retorts, with half a smile.

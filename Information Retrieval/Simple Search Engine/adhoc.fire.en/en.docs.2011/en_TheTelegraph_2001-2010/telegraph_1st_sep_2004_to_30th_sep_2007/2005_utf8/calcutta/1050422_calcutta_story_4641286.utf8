The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Small talk

 The heat is on and there is no ignoring the capital from where the effect is percolating, at least where high-profile events go. The circle is as wide as it can get from diplomacy to design, so you?ll definitely have something to chew on along with your cold beer?

 Dandy diplomacy

 Musharraf?s prominent heart which he unabashedly displayed on his sleeve and his soft and supple approach to the border issue could take some of the zing off the heated paw-paw you were planning to have with buddies this weekend. The change of tune ? and heart ? from the fateful Agra summit and the spate of goodwill measures from the Indian side ? the hype over the Srinagar-Mazzafarabad bus service, the cricket capitulation ? requires you to re-compose your script for the little power lunch speech you had in mind.

 LIFW whispers

 Even if you haven?t been able to gain entry (or haven?t bothered to) to the mecca of Indian fashion, you can?t afford to lose out on the trends emerging in Delhi. You may not want to go in for a wardrobe overhaul, but you have to flutter your eyelids with confidence when you say skirts are in. So what if you haven?t been enthused enough to be glued to the telly to watch every twitch on the ramp? Keeping one lazy eye open will ensure you don?t go gushing unnecessarily about the pretty faces wearing pretty clothes. There is a sad dearth of fresh faces in the modelling industry and you have to learn the art of stifling a yawn at the sight of the same old names strutting their stuff.

 Hot hum

 Turn to good ol? weather if you?ve been too lazy to lap it all up, or too busy fanning yourself dry. If the forecast of normal rainfall released by the Met department is to be believed, we all have about a month-and-a-half of torture treatment before the rains rescue us in June. ?They predicted the same last year as well, but 2004 was such a scorcher,? may be a legitimate gripe, but now they blame it on the El Nino effect. El what, pray? Ok, here?s your geography refresher to help you tide over rough weather: El Nino, the gradual warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific known to adversely affect Indian monsoon behaviour, suddenly appeared in July last year and held sway till December. For the moment, beat the heat with global village banter, air fares falling and what not?

 VAT guard

 And if they try to scare you into panic buying due to yet another traders? strike protesting VAT, tell them to get their facts right. Assure them that the supply of essential commodities won?t be affected as the strike will be limited to only wholesalers.

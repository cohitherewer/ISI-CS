The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Track revamp on 4 roads

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has decided to relay tram tracks on reinforced concrete beds on four more arteries ? Bidhan Sarani, Lenin Sarani, BB Ganguly Street and Mahatma Gandhi Road-Strand Road.

 The phased implementation of the project will be handled by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), which had successfully carried out dereservation and concretisation of the tracks at Esplanade, Gariahat, Park Circus and on Rashbehari Avenue.

 In the first phase, tracks will be relaid on a 10.6-km stretch ? 2.5 km on Mahatma Gandhi Road-Strand Road, 1.6 km on BB Ganguly Street, 1.8 km on Lenin Sarani and 4.7 km on Bidhan Sarani.

 The Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) has sought permission from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), which owns the roads, for the track renewal project. 

 The mayoral council will meet on Friday to clear the proposal.

 ?We will allow the CTC to undertake the renovation work and extend to it all possible help, as trams are Calcutta?s heritage,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya told Metro on Thursday. ?Trams are a disciplined and non-polluting mode of public transport and we need more trams to curb air pollution.?

 Bhattacharya?s predecessor, Subrata Mukherjee, had refused to take the responsibility for upkeep of the tracks, which belong to the CTC. 

 The civic body, he had claimed, was responsible only for the carriageways.

 Several lives were lost in accidents caused by the damaged tracks, that had not been repaired for decades.

 Earlier, renewal of tram tracks meant replacing the rails and giving a fresh coat of bitumin on the patch of road in between.

 The ?at-grade? scheme, funded by the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, has changed that concept. Now, relaying involves placing the new rails on a reinforced concrete bed, which prolongs the longevity of the tracks.

 Mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera said the CPM-led civic board was working on a proposal to concretise several more roads. 

 During the earlier tenure of the Left Front in the CMC (1990-1995), Bera had been instrumental in concretising parts of Strand Road, Tiljala Road and Moti Sil Street.

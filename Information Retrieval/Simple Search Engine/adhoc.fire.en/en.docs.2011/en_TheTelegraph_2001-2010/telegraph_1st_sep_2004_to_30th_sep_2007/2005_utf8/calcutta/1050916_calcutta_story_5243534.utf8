The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Strike off at film school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The students of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) called off their strike on Thursday, ending the three-week campus deadlock. Their decision to rejoin classes came in the wake of Wednesday?s governing council meeting.

 ?The issues raised during the strike can?t be solved in a day or two, but a process to address the problems has been initiated,? said Dhrubaa Ghosh, a student of the outgoing direction batch.

 The governing council meeting ? which addressed issues of academic and financial irregularities in the functioning of the institute ? was attended by Afzal Amanullah, secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting, film-maker Jahanu Barua, council chairman Basu Chatterjee, SRFTI director Abhay Srivastava and Doordarshan Calcutta director Pankaj Saha.

 The governing council has ratified several proposals placed at the academic council meeting on a priority basis. Buying equipment, the lack of which is hampering day-to-day work, is one such proposal.

 ?That apart, an effort has also been made to ensure transparency in the student budgets. We will be receiving some amount of grant,? added Dhrubaa.

 On Thursday, film-maker Barua inspected all the four departments of the institute, before holding a separate meeting with the students of the direction department.

 Academic activity on the campus off the EM Bypass is likely to return to normal by early next week.

 Raj coins found in three jars

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A group of five masons stumbled upon three jars filled with rare silver coins from the Raj on Tuesday afternoon. 

 The masons were engaged in construction work at the site of a demolished building at Panchla, in Howrah, some 40 km from Calcutta.

 A dilapidated building belonging to late Bechuram Kolay was razed last week to allow a new construction. The masons alerted Panchla police station about the discovery. 

 While the Kolays, apparently, were keen to retain possession of the coins, police insisted that they be taken to the thana and examined by experts from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

 Kartick, son of Bechuram, told policemen that his ancestors were not rich enough to possess such silver coins. 

 ?We wonder how the three jars were kept hidden here,? he said. 

 Superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya later disclosed that the coins belong to the British period, as some bear emblems of George V and Queen Victoria.

 Amal Roy, superintendent of archaeology, government of West Bengal, who will visit the site on Wednesday, said similar coins were recovered from a site near Balagarh, in Hooghly, last October. Two coin collections were also unearthed in Bakshi, in Howrah.

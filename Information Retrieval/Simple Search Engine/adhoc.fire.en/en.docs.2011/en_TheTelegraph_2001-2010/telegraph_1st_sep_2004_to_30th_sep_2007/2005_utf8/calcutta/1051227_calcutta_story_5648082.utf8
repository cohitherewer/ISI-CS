 Focus on freedom amp; mass media

 A two-day cultural fest was organised at JU to crown its golden jubilee celebrations. On December 20, former JU physics teacher Soumya Chakraborty and alumnus Sudipto Chatterjee rocked the open-air theatre with soulful renderings of folk songs by Lalan Fakir, as well as from North Bengal and Assam. Ex-student Sugata Nag rsquo;s sitar recital was followed by Tagore rsquo;s play Totakahini by JU students. The next day witnessed a Kavi Sammelan and paintings on poetry at the indoor stadium.This was followed by the release of a commemorative stamp by P.K. Chatterjee, chief postmaster-general (West Bengal circle), and the unveiling of a portrait of Satis Chandra Mukherjee by higher education minister Satya Sadhan Chakraborty. Jadavpurer Gaan, performances by Mamata Shankar and her ballet troupe (pictured above) and instrumental fusion band Indian Blue (picture below), and a fireworks display ended the 50th-year celebrations on December 21.

 Freedom of speech and expression was the focus of Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi?s speech on ?Freedom Of Expression: Whose Freedom? Whose Expression??, at the fifth Pranabesh Sen Memorial Lecture. It was organised by the Pranabesh Sen Memorial Committee and the NGO Sohini, at Sisir Mancha, on December 19. 

 Emphasising the media?s role in segregating free speech from loose talk, the governor highlighted the impact of publications like Young India and Harijan in the Gandhian era. 

 He regretfully pointed out that freedom of expression and freedom of advertising are not synonymous, but today the latter has become a hindrance to the former. Yet, there are also newspapers vocal about the condition of poor farmers, the state of malnutrition among the poor, corruption etc. He talked on topics ranging from the positive impact of NGOs in Sonagachhi and wretched state of bidi workers.

 The special guest for the evening, eminent poet Nirendranath Chakraborty, unveiled three books, Tothyer Odhikar, Aaro Ak Guchchho Sambad Parikrama and Kan Pete Roi, based on the late radio journalist Pranabesh Sen (1935-2000). 

 Particularly inspiring for budding journalists in the audience was Tarun Chakraborty?s reading of Sen?s radio message to Bangladeshis originally broadcast at 10 pm on the eve of erstwhile Pakistan?s surrender in the then East Pakistan.

 Question time

 It was a battle of the physics brains at Birla Industrial amp; Technological Museum on December 16, for the Eastern India Physics Quiz 2005. Held as part of the World Year of Physics 2005 celebrations, it was open to students of classes XI and XII.

 Apart from oral and visual rounds, the students were quizzed on experiments conducted on the spot. The topics included astrophysics, geophysics and biophysics. Twelve teams from West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Sikkim and other states participated. 

 This quiz was first held at the district level, with the winners progressing to the state level earlier this month. The winners made it to the finals in Calcutta. 

 Burdwan CMS High School, represented by Arnab Rudra, Sk Sohel Islam and Hemanta Roy, took the top prize. Aniruddha Phukan, Daisy Rajkhowa and Depankar Deka of Army School, Narangi, Guwahati, were the close runners-up.

 Celebrating Sartre 

 Jean-Paul Sartre?s concept of life and freedom were the focus of the discussion at a seminar to mark the birth centenary of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-80) organised by the English department, CU, on December 21. 

 Chinmoy Guha from the host department argued that Sartre refused the Nobel Prize to ensure that his revolt did not become institutionalised. Talking about ?Sartre?s Self-examinations?, he emphasised the point that in a television interview just 25 days before his death, Sartre stated that he never suffered from loneliness or existential crises. 

 In her paper on ?Sartre?s Novels?, Prof Paromita Das from CU?s French department highlighted the author?s concept of democratisation of Communist politics, as she dwelt on the philosophical unity of his novels. Among those attending the event were poet Sankha Ghosh, drama critic Samik Bandopadhyay, Prof Tapan Ghosh from the Oxford University, and Prof Amiya Deb, former vice-chancellor of Vidyasagar University.

Talking points

 Fests, fun and frolic aside, there have been plenty of busy bees at work on the St Xavier?s College campus. All things environmental were under discussion on December 10 and 11, at the National Seminar on Pollution in Urban Industrial Environment. Convened by Dr Arup Kumar Mitra, reader and head, department of microbiology, the event was attended by participants from India and Nepal, including Assam, Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad.

 Professors spoke on pressing issues like urban pollution monitoring, hazards of arsenic dissolved in water, urban pollution and its control, air pollution and respiratory health and the like. The technical sessions revolved around topics like air pollution and ground water pollution. There were 48 presentations in all, including 16 by undergraduate students and eight by invited lecturers. Cultural programmes added colour to the proceedings.

 Earlier this month, the alumni association officially launched its website, www.sxccaa.org. The website will be help disseminate information about the college, current news, new projects, new developments, fundraising activities, new courses and more. Many alumni work in companies overseas, and are in a position to recruit freshers and professionals. The website could be a platform to advertise job vacancies, with preferences for Xaverians.

 Crack the spelling code

 On December 19, at 9 am, the three of us were hauled out of our classrooms by teacher I. Bhattacharya and taken to Rabindra Sadan, the venue of the Spel Linc competition. We felt strangely relaxed but not completely confident. We decide to leave it to destiny and our grey cells. 

 At around 11.15 am, the first phase began. Anchor Mir regaled us with jokes to relax the nerves. Words like ?cryogenics? and ?beleaguer? were difficult. We were quite sure we hadn?t qualified. With complex emotions churning our insides, we ate our lunches in silence. 

 As the name of our school appeared on screen, we couldn?t believe it! We walked onto the stage, dazed and confused. The other teams to qualify were MP Birla FHS, Ashok Hall, St Patrick?s Asansol, St Xavier?s Collegiate School, Don Bosco Park Circus, St Teresa?s Secondary School and National Gems High School. 

 As an ice-breaker, each team was given an impromptu topic to perform on stage. We had to explain the word ?pneumonoueramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis? in any language apart from English. Then it was the first round of 10 spellings. Round two had 10 anagrams to be solved in two minutes. Round three involved crosswords. The last round was a rapid-fire one, where teams had to choose a representative who would spell the words aloud. 

 The chief guest was Parijoy Saha, who has made it in the Limca Book of Records for making the fastest painting ? in two seconds. He created a beautiful painting on stage in about 10 minutes. As the results were revealed, our tension mounted. When we realised we had won, our faces split into identical ecstatic grins. 

 To sum up: it was an amazing experience, just out of the world. We hope to win again next year.

 Union nod for age bar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The ruling CPM?s trade union wing, Citu, has come out in support of the state government?s stand in phasing out commercial vehicles more than 15 years old from the city streets.

 Citu?s Bengal unit president Shyamal Chakraborty said on Wednesday that the government had no alternative if it were to honour a Supreme Court directive on reducing vehicular pollution.

 The government had earlier announced that commercial vehicles registered before 1990 would not be allowed to ply to conform to emission control norms. The ban is scheduled to come into effect from January 2006.

 ?We welcome the government?s decision to scrap all pre-1990 commercial vehicles if they do not switch to green fuel,? Chakraborty said, while addressing the seventh conference of the Truck Owners? Association of Bengal. 

 According to official figures, around 30,000 trucks will have to be grounded if the directive is implemented. The association wants the government to offer some incentives so that truck operators and owners can replace their old vehicles with new ones.

 ?About 80 per cent of the truck operators cannot buy new vehicles immediately. The government should allow us time to replace our vehicles,? association president Joydeb Ghosh said.

 In a related development, Bengal Bus Syndicate, the largest body of private bus-owners, reiterated on Wednesday that it would withdraw all its vehicles if the government stuck to its stand.

 Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha said he would shortly meet representatives of the Minibus Owners? Coordination Committee and prepare the blueprint of an agitation against the government. 

 ?Nearly 70 per cent of the 7,500-odd vehicles were manufactured before 1990. We cannot replace them overnight,? he pointed out. 

 He asserted that bus operators would instal devices in their vehicles in order to conform to emission rules. ?It is our responsibility to ensure that the vehicles conform to emission norms, irrespective of their age. So, why does the government want to scrap our vehicles?? he asked.

 President of the Minibus Owners? Coordination Committee Abashesh Dawn, too, pleaded for ?some concessions so that special devices could be installed in our vehicles?.

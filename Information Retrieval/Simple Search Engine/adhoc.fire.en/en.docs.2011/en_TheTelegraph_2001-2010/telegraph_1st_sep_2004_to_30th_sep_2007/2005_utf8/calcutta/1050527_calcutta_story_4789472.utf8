 Kidnap son, realise dues

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Biswanath Mondal abducted the son of the man who had borrowed Rs 20,000 from him and was not paying up. 

 The police traced him and finally rescued the boy within 18 hours of his disappearance. Mondal and his driver have been arrested on charges of abduction.

 Mondal went on Wednesday morning to collect the money that his acquaintance Sushanta Manna had borrowed and was refusing to return. So, he decided on abduction. Manna owns a garage.

 While Mondal claims he only wanted to get back the money, police insist that there is more to it. ?We are probing if there is something more than just Rs 20,000 involved in the abduction,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south). 

 Around 9 am on Wednesday, when Mondal turned up at Manna?s garage with his men, he was not there. After some time, he spotted Manna?s son Pulak and inquired about his father. 

 ?Father has gone out and will return soon,? the son replied, asking Mondal to wait for sometime. 

 ?Mondal asked Pulak if he knew where his father had gone. When the son said he did, Mondal asked the boy to step into his Ambassador, so that they could both go there together. Pulak complied,? said an officer of Chetla police station.

 Mondal asked his driver Dilip Karmakar to drive down EM Bypass to Usthi, in South 24-Parganas.

 He took Pulak to Sirakhole, in Usthi, and kept him in his house. 

 Towards the afternoon, Mondal called up Manna?s neighbour and asked for him. With Manna not around, his wife Kabita took the call. 

 Mondal told her that her son was with him and would not be released until her husband paid up. 

 Alarmed, Kabita went to Chetla police station and told the policemen about the phone call. Police traced the call to Usthi.

 A team of officers then grilled Kabita to find out some details about Mondal and left for Usthi.

 When cops raided his residence, Mondal was missing. The team went looking for him at his uncle?s place. 

 During the raid, two officers suddenly spotted Mondal and grabbed hold of him by his shirt. He led the team to one corner of his house, where he had kept Pulak captive.

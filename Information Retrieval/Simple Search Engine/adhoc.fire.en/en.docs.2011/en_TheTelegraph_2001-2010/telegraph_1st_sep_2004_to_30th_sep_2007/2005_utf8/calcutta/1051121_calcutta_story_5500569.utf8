 Unrequited love leads to suicide

 - Girl hangs herself after rebuff from boyfriend?s father

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Unrequited love drove 15-year-old Kakoli Ghosh to end her life by hanging herself from the ceiling of her room at Sonarpur, on the city?s southern fringes, on Saturday night. She had tied her dupatta around her neck

 Police recovered the body on Sunday morning after her parents informed them. A suicide note was seized, in which the girl wrote that she was left with no alternative but to end her life, as the father of the boy she loved since childhood were opposed to their marriage.

 Kakoli, alias Mumpy, a student of Class X, had an affair with a local boy who studies in the same class of a different school in the neighbourhood. Both were candidates for this year?s Madhyamik examinations and they used to meet each other when they went for coaching classes. 

 Superintendent of police S.N.Gupta said an FIR was lodged with Sonarpur police station on the basis of a complaint made by the deceased?s maternal uncle, Swapan Ghosh. ?Those named in the FIR will be rounded up for interrogation and I have given necessary instructions to Sonarpur police on this score,? he added. 

 Ghosh said they were aware of Kakoli?s affair with the boy who had visited her house a number of times. ?But we did not have any idea that the boy?s father was opposed to it. It?s a great loss for us as we never imagined that she would end her life that way,? he added.

 He demanded that those who were responsible for the girl?s death be punished. 

 Subhas Chandra Ghosh, Kakoli?s father, who is yet to recover from the shock, said his daughter was behaving strangely for some time. ?Kakoli was an extrovert but of late, she had become quiet. Even the boy had stopped coming to our place. Only on Friday, she told her mother that she had stopped meeting the boy as his father did not approve of the relationship. But we attached no importance to her words and, instead, asked her to concentrate on her studies as the examinations were drawing near. But we never thought that she would put an end to her life in this manner,? he said in a choked voice, 

 One of her family members said they had come to know only on Sunday that the boy?s father had told Kakoli to stop meeting his son. ?This might have driven the girl to commit suicide,? said an elderly lady.

Life

 Friend forever

 KIRAN'S CALL 

 Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh pens a tribute to the warmth and magnetism of film-maker Ismail Merchant

 Are we going to be friends forever? asked Piglet.

Even longer, Pooh answered

 ? Winnie the Pooh, 

 A.A. Milne

 I never thought Id write about anything but fashion. But as they say, never say never. Specially when the exception is a dear friend, Ismail Merchant.

 When (husband) Gaurav and I heard Ismail Merchant had passed away in a London hospital from a burst ulcer, we sat in shocked silence. This was unexpected news about a soul who had touched our lives briefly and yet deep.

 Ironical that hed just announced he would be producing, with James Ivory as director and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala doing the screenplay, Peter Camerons novel, The City of Your Final Destination.

 Most know of him as a film producer and director who brought up the trio of Merchant Ivory ? a partnership that won six Oscars, and was the winner of several National Awards, and so much more. 

 Fame, glory, awards, we know all about that. That wasnt what our friendship was ? or this piece is ? all about.

 It wasnt that we met Ismail often, but whenever we did, his warmth, his vision, his energy and the odd mix of a well-travelled sophisticate, at heart a basic Mumbaikar, was strangely endearing. Here was a man whos charm was legion, at home anywhere from Mumbai to Hollywood and beyond.

 It was late one Sunday morning during one of my visits to Cochin and Gaurav, to rev the household up. Gaurav mentioned, characteristically nonchalant, that a film director would be dropping in. He needed some help organising a shoot. 

 In walked this man in crisp white kurta pajama, looking more like a north Indian politician than a non-resident Indian director, and handed me a book.

 As I started flipping through Films of Merchant Ivory, more out of politeness than curiosity, I realised, to my horror, who this man I planned to feed leftovers of last nights dinner, was. 

 With hindsight, Im glad he didnt bring me one of his books on cuisine, since he was a great foodie and culinary expertise is definitely not my forte.

 For a couple of months, our sleepy but pretty backwaters of Kerala were entertained by the antics of Ismail, Ivory and their cast and crew.

 We have fond memories of meeting up close some truly credible talents from the international film and theatre world, both known and unknown, courtesy Ismail: Bernardo Bertolucci, Tom Stoppard, Greta Scacchi.

 On one occasion he announced they were all fed up of their hotel food. We invited him over for a casual dinner only to find Ismail on our doorstep that evening with Greta Scacchi and culinary queen Madhur Jaffrey looking for great ghar ka khana. Needless to elaborate on my plight.

 The wicked cast spent the evening in splits trying to get Madhur guessing what pudding she had eaten. She didnt manage. It was a disastrous cheesecake. But they ate it nevertheless. 

 Ismails persuasive powers were legendary, as was his concern for others. Even the redoubtable Sir Vidya Naipaul granted him filming rights for a book (The Mystic Masseur) over the telephone since he had heard of Ismails charm. Naipaul told him he neednt come to meet him as he knew he would capitulate if they were to meet.

 Its sad that he didnt persuade god to give him a little more time to spread some more of his magnetism that came from his belief that film-making is about the heart.

 One day, during the making of Cotton Mary, a 1950s period film, in Cochin, an extra arrived dressed up in a Dubai polyester lungi. The costume team threw a fit and looked to Ismail to have the man removed.

 But Ismail reasoned differently. Let him have his moment in the limelight. Nobodys going to notice this polyester print in the crowd. And so it was. People remember the film, rather than one polyester lungi someone wore in a crowd scene. 

 The heart came first and always, whether it was a leisurely dinner with Satyajit Rays ailing assistant Subrata Mitra, or keeping in touch with the elderly couple who introduced Jennifer to Shashi Kapoor. He never let us feel he was in a hurry.

 Post-production, Ismail got back to Cochin to wrap up last minute shots. He met up with Gaurav for dinner. The next morning, Gaurav received an envelope from the Malabar House Residency. It held an air ticket to Calcutta for that weekend and a note from Ismail saying, Have a great weekend at home with Kiran. 

 A truly thoughtful gesture from the man who made The Householder and is famous for the quote, I am a non-believer of marriage.

 Years later, each time Ismail would come to town, hed call Gaurav ? My friend, Im in your city, ? and include us in whatever he was there for.

 Ismail lived the dictum of true friendship. Like Emerson, he believed the only way to have a friend is to be one.

 Little wonder, then, that the communiqu? from Merchant Ivory Films said, he died surrounded by family and friends.

 Maidens on the trot

 - 11 women, a racehorse and a gallop goal

 When they watch him bolt out of the barriers and come round the bend at the Breeders? Cup in early December, their gallop dream will gather steam and the city?s racing rendezvous will get a welcome leg-up.

 Beyond Barriers is not just another two-year-old thoroughbred. Bought at the auction sale of the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) this March, and being readied for winter action, the racehorse is owned by an all-ladies? team, the Influence Racing Syndicate.

 ?The initial breeze-up was a chance meeting with the stewards of RCTC. However, the main trigger has been the desire to rid the sport of the stigma of gambling and a certain negative lifestyle connotation it carries. We don?t need this baggage from the past,? stresses Swati Gautam, ?chief instigator? in the 11-member syndicate.

 While designer jewellery exporter Sujata Rampuria relishes the chance to participate in ?this spectacular sport in a clean and responsible manner?, for Seema Kanoi, the thought of owning a racehorse was ?always an exciting prospect?, also for her children Rishi and Vidhi. ?It?s a wonderful animal for kids to be associated with!?

 Beyond Barriers, after the ?breaking-in?, is now being trotted in ?bund? school by trainer Bharath Singh, and weaned on a diet of oats, bran and carrots, besides vitamin and calcium supplements. ?This will be a great learning curve for these extremely earnest women, and for the sake of the sport, we hope they stick on and not fizzle out like predecessor Femme Ten Syndicate, which never went beyond its maiden horse, Crimson Rage,? says Singh.

 Romola Bhattacharyya, who along with Hansa Kumari Dev Burman, brings the element of experience to the ladies? ensemble otherwise made up of racing greenhorns, is buoyant on the far stretch, though. ?Once the racing bug bites, it?s difficult to get out,? she says, with a smile.

 And the turf club wouldn?t want them to dismount mid-course either. ?We would encourage women?s syndicates, because they add glamour, and could go a long way in bringing about a rebirth of racing in Calcutta,? feels RCTC steward Sujit Bhattacharyya.

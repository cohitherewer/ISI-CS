Screen On amp; Off

 A moment from Kashmir Princess. Picture by Aranya Sen

 Darkness, music, the drone of an approaching plane. Visual on a small screen: a plane moving through the clouds. Suddenly, out of the blue, a loud bang. The plane explodes in mid-air and the dazzling flare leaps out of the rectangular screen to light up the three-tier stage in red. Then, a brief silence broken by the voice of Ashok Mukhopadhyay. A spotlight seeks him out in the audience as he narrates the history of Kashmir Princess.

 This was theatre director Bibhas Chakraborty?s chosen introduction to Utpal Dutt?s political thriller Turuper Taash (The Trump Card), recently presented as the Kashmir Princess at Girish Mancha, Madhusudan Mancha and Bharatiyam. 

 The play was the latest presentation of the Utpal Dutt Natyotsav sponsored by the state youth welfare department. Four groups ? Theatre Workshop, Sayak, Sohan and Anya Theatre ? had come together as Samabay Prayash for the play.

 ?We were unanimous in our choice of the play and enjoyed ourselves because we have been close friends, and as the director I revelled in a cast of powerful actors like Meghnad Bhattacharya, Ashok Mukhopadhyay, Dolly Basu and others,? said Bibhas.

 The play looks back on April 11, 1955, when Kashmir Princess, the Air India International Super Constellation aircraft, flying to Jakarta, blew up over the Pacific, allegedly due to a bomb placed in the starboard wheel-well. Only three, of the 19 people aboard, survived.

 Investigations indicated this had been a bungled CIA attempt to assassinate Chinese premier Chou-en-Lai, who had been scheduled to travel to the Bandung conference of April 14, 1955. A last-minute change of travel plans had saved him.

 Utpal Dutt?s jatra focussed on the key players of the CIA conspiracy in (then) Bombay ? the US agent working as a trade secretary in the US Consulate, an ICS officer, a history professor, a deputy commissioner of police, a reporter and a politician.

 While adapting it for proscenium theatre, a number of adjustments had to be made. ?The jatra form allows a loose structure and extra characters. Then there was the time lapse; when Utpal Dutt wrote the play in 1976 the incident was still fresh. Fifty years later some amount of documentation was necessary. So we changed the opening, used data and actual stills. The first screen projection also helped us make the direct impact we needed,? said Bibhas.

 The play presents the trials and tribulations of a middle-class family caught up in the conspiracy, with the Kashmir Princess emerging as a symbol of national pride and ideals. And heroine Mitra?s fight becomes every man?s struggle for freedom.

 Kashmir Princess is scheduled for December 2 at Academy of Fine Arts.

 On November 14, Dukhu Ramer Arup Kotha, by the Esho Natak Shikhi group of Kestopur, is going to open the ninth International Theatre Festival for Children.

 Organised by National Institute of Performing Arts (NIPA) at Delhi?s LTG auditorium, near Mandi House, the festival will host 18 groups, including those from West Indies, Germany, South Africa and Norway. 

 Eastern India has a strong presence with troupes from Assam, Orissa, Tripura, Jharkhand and Bengal.

 Dukhu Ramer Arup Kotha, written and directed by Tapas Das, focuses on the bonds between nature and man. Dukhu... has been staged exactly 100 times at various venues in and around Calcutta. ?Eight members, all of them below 10 years old, will be travelling to Delhi,? said Das, who left Nandikar to start the children?s group in 1990. 

 Dukhu... is about a child who has the ability to communicate with plants but when he is asked by a TV channel to display his gift he is unable to do so because the plant put before him is an artificial one.

 ?While most children?s troupes restrict themselves to fairytales, we try to address contemporary themes in as modern a way as possible. Professionals handle the technical aspect of each play. For instance, in our forthcoming play Tatan Aar Shada Payra to premiere on Star TV on December 4, lights, music and sets are being done by the likes of Goutam Haldar and Badhan Das,? Das added.

 Dukhu... features Argha Saha (Dukhu), Dibyasankar Das (Tree), Kaustav Das, Ria Bose, Moitrayani Das, Apurba Roy, Ahana Mazumdar and Archisman Pal.

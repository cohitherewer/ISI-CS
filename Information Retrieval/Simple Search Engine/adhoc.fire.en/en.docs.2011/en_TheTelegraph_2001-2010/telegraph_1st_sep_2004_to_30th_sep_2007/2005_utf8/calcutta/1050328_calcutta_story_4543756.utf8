 A woman?s world

 It?s a film about women, their lives, loves and losses. The lead players are not just accomplished actresses, but also women of substance. And the director is best described as someone who has made her mark as a woman and a film-maker.

 Hysterical Blindness by Mira Nair is not about girl power, but about the daily struggle that is so much a part of life. It?s about happiness and heartbreak, love and friendship, conflicts between mothers and daughters and the inner peace that lies at the core of contentment. The film is about the potholed journey towards that core.

 Starring Uma Thurman, Juliette Lewis and Gena Rowlands, the film was made for HBO in 2002, and is being screened on the Indian feed of the channel soon. 

 It?s a poignant tale of working-class life in New Jersey of the 1980s, portrayed through the lives of Debby (Thurman), Beth (Lewis) and Virginia (Rowlands), who plays Debby?s mother. All three are single women looking for love. Beth is a single mother, while Virginia?s husband, Debbie?s father, left when Debbie was a child.

 They end up in dubious relationships with no assurances in sight. After all, Debbie and Beth go looking for men in a local bar. Ironically, Debbie finds who she thinks is her Mr Right on the same day that she suffers a bout of hysterical blindness at work ? a medical condition which results in temporary blackout.

 The project was conceived by Thurman, who saw the play in New York in 1998 that won good reviews but did not enjoy a long run. She bought the movie rights from playwright Laura Cahill. After discussions and phone calls ? a final one from Thurman to Nair in Mumbai during the making of Monsoon Wedding ? the process began.

Nair said of the film in an HBO interview that it was about ?the fabric of human life?, because ?it is about really ordinary people and our struggles?. And that is ?life that?s not unique?.

 Her reasons for doing the film? ?I found it very honest, very truthful, very unflinching, and sort of the untold story that women don?t speak of often, which is the lengths we go to, to feel desired, to feel loved. And sometimes it?s a not quite loveless universe, but it?s very difficult to love if you have not been loved before in an essential sense.?

 And the Indian-born Harvard-educated director made it all come together in an award-winning way (Thurman won an Emmy).

 ?It was a collection of actors who all loved their parts and who all were there because they loved the writing, and they loved Mira Nair. And that?s the funniest way to come together,? is how Thurman put it.

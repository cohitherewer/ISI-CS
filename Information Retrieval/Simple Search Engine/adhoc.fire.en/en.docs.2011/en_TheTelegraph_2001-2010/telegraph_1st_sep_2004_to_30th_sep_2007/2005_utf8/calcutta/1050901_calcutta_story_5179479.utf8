 Dark distress: City Centre, the hangout under focus. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 lApropos the report ?Fee, pay rein on schools?, August 11, I was surprised to find that the criteria shortlisted by a 12-member committee to grade schools did not include the teacher-student ratio. 

 Parents often pay through their noses to admit their children in schools that have one teacher for a hundred students. According to educationists, the ratio should ideally be 1:25. 

 Several English-medium schools do not bother to provide even basic facilities. Most do not have a playing field or gymnasium, and the libraries and laboratories remain unutilised. 

 In their zest to make their schools marketable, the authorities use the ?pyramid passing criterion?, in which students are given transfer certificates even in Class IX to cut the numbers appearing in the Board finals down to the Board?s ceiling. This, in turn, gives birth to a vicious cycle. 

 The discarded students enrol in lesser-known schools operating from virtual one-room establishments. These schools allow the students to appear for Board examination from an accredited institution, while charging them hefty tution fees for classes they never attended. 

 Teachers in several schools now discourage questions from the students. Many of them teach what they had learnt during their student years, using the same notes. 

 They proudly collaborate with the school authorities to throw out students who, they feel, will not do well in the Board exams, but forget that failures of the students are their failures, too. 

 The lessons taught in these schools are not focussed on the needs of the students. The teachers can make good students do well in the exams, but lack the quality to improve ordinary students. 

 The committee would do well to look into these aspects of English-medium schools rather than go by a set criteria. 

 Gautam Ghosh,

 Rashbehari Avenue. 

 Apropos ?School boys held for eve-tease? (August 8), we have larger houses today, but more broken homes. Our possessions have increased manifold, but our values have taken a nosedive. Parents are making the lives of their children very comfortable, but are not teaching them how to live a life. These social changes are manifested in the behaviour of today?s teens. The loopholes in law further encourage them to indulge in indecent acts like eve-teasing. They know that however grave their crime, their parents would pay for legal eagles, who would shout their guts out in court to prove their clients are innocent. The whole system is to blame for what happened to June and Anindita. 

 Purnima Vasudeva, 

 Rowland Road. 

 I congratulate telefilm director Anindita Sarbadhicary and actress June for showing the courage to promptly inform the police after being harassed by spoilt, rich kids prowling the City Centre grounds. Hundreds of women are teased in Calcutta every day by motorcycle-borne lumpens, but few show the courage to fight back. The media should publish the photographs of the eve-teasers so that they can at least be socially censured. 

 Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore. 

 It is pity that the eve-teasers, who come from moneyed families, could escape scot-free after a token arrest. If this is the way people harassing celebrities are treated, what lies in store for girls coming from ordinary backgrounds? 

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur. 

 It is good to learn that five Class XII students have been arrested for passing lewd comments at actress June and Anindita. Since there has been a spurt in eve-teasing in and around the city, the perpetrators should be dealt with sternly. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 The police did a laudable job by arresting, within 24 hours, five youngsters who harassed two female celebrities. But because of procedural lacunae, they were released on bail a few hours later. Also, would the police have acted as speedily if the victims were not prominent personalities? 

 Gunjeet S. Wadhwa, 

 Rai Bahadur Road. 

 It is disgraceful that five school students were arrested for teasing actress June and a film-director. The comments that the five made betray their upbringing. These brats from affluent families do not even draw the line at teasing housewives. 

 A blatantly consumerist culture and commodification of women are the root causes behind such harassment of women. It?s unfortunate that teenagers in the city seem to be lured by the darker aspects of the American culture, ignoring its good sides. 

 Anjan Chatterjee, 

 Graham Road. 

 Eve-teasing is a problem in all parts of Calcutta. I am a college student and I frequent malls. I have seen girls being harassed not just in City Centre, but on the roads of Salt Lake, in Park Street and almost everywhere else. The police are invariably silent witness to the plight of the victims. 

 Supriyo Chakraborty, 

 Lake Town. 

 Surely, the situation at City Centre is not as bad as the media are potraying it. 

 Suvrajit Saha,

 Address not given. 

 The recent incident of eve-teasing at City Centre is being viewed in isolation and being blown out of proportion. There is hardly any place in the world that does not have its share of troublemongers. Undue attention on the black sheep will only give a bad name to a place that boasts one of the more decent environments for adda. I am a student of a nearby government college and have spent a lot of time at City Centre. I found the atmosphere to be a lot better than at the College Street Coffee House and our chief minister?s favourite haunt Nandan. 

 Subhajit Sengupta, 

 Ramakrishna Sarada Road. 

 The bank has done the right thing by not extending the deadline for completion of three HRBC projects (Japan bank firm on deadline, August 10). The suffering of the public does not inspire the government to complete the projects on time. Hopefully, the prospect of funds being withdrawn will be more effective. 

 G. Raghuram,

 Dr GS Bose Road. 

 In the article ?Stadium duo ready for use?, August 26, it was mentioned that the Calcutta Tourism Fair wiil be held at Netaji Indoor Stadium from September 1 to 3. The 43rd Travel and Tourism Fair will be held at the stadium from September 3 to 5.

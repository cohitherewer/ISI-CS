 An insatiable desire

 Atale of obsessive, inordinate desire, Pancham Vaidics latest production, Chandali, provides an insight into the hidden depths of the human psyche. Trying to uncover reasons for human obsession, it highlights the ruin and devastation that unbridled expression of extreme emotion and passion can bring. In the play, Prakriti, a girl of humble origins, desires the love of Ananda, a Buddhist monk. In spite of being warned by her mother against stepping over the bounds of sinfulness, she urges her mother to use her occult powers in order to win him over. Thus forced, the mother binds and drags the noble monk like a beast to her daughter. Yet, Prakritis desires remain far from being fulfilled. The play culminates with her self-realisation that her restlessness is in vain and her excessive thirst for love is unquenchable. Performed and directed by Saoli Mitra.

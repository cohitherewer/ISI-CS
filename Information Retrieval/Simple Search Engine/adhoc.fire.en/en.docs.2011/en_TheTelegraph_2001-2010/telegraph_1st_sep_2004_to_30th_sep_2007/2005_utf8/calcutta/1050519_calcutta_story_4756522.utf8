 Inked deals flag off leather complex

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Bantala-based Calcutta Leather Complex became operational on Wednesday, with the government, tannery-owners and the project promoters signing a series of agreements. The formal inauguration will be held next month.

 One of the agreements was on the running and upkeep of the common effluent treatment plant, common chrome recovery plant and the solid waste management system in the leather complex. 

 The pact was signed by Sabyasachi Sen, secretary of the commerce and industry department, and Jamil Ahmed, president of the Calcutta Leather Complex Tannery Owners Association.

 The agreement on providing civic amenities ? including water, roads, drainage and street lights ? was signed by tannery owners? association secretary M. Haque and Jagmohan Dalmiya, chairman and managing director of the promoting firm ML Dalmiya and Company.

 These apart, an MoU on setting up leather-based units in the complex was signed between the promoters and the Indian Leather Products Association. 

 The association will set up a 35-acre leather goods park, the first of its kind in the country, with assistance from the Centre and the state government. The park, to house leather goods units and a leather designing centre, is likely to be ready within a year.

 Commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, who was present at the agreement-signing at Manikanchan (Salt Lake), said several foreign firms were keen to invest in the leather sector. ?Some reputed companies from China and Italy have already visited the complex and expressed desire to set up units. We told them to submit their proposals to the government,? Sen said.

 The execution of the leather complex project, the minister admitted, was a challenge to him. ?We were determined to set it up, despite opposition from various corners. Though we are a little late, I am happy that we have done it. We want to make the complex a complete leather hub, the best in the country,? he stressed.

 The infrastructure around the complex will be further improved and the stretch of Basanti Road between Bantala and EM Bypass will be widened and properly maintained. ?A special fund will be sanctioned for the purpose,? he added. 

 Sen urged tannery-owners to start operations immediately. The promoters were urged to look into the problems of the tannery-owners and the employees, so they can work without any hazard.

 Promoting firm managing director Jagmohan Dalmiya said there was immense possibility of investment, trade and employment in the leather sector.

 In the 1,100-acre leather complex, 375 acres have been earmarked for tanneries, where around 500 units will be relocated and 130 new units will be set up.

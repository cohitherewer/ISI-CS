 Nurturing tomorrow?s talents

 As a platform to promote and encourage promising artistes in the field of the performing arts, A Sirkar Jewellers? Jewels of Tomorrow showcases the creative and performing skills of three budding artistes. The programme promises to entertain the audience, at the same time provides meaningful motivation and support to the three new generation performers: Subhas Dey, an immensely gifted, visually impaired actor, writer and director, lends the show a lively start with a brilliant display of his histrionic skills in a solo performance which he himself has directed. Pianist Avijit Kundu, who plays two of his own compositions, sets the tone for an enjoyable musical evening. Kathak danseuse Mitul Sengupta brings down the curtains with an originally-conceived classical fusion dance presentation.

 Event: Jewels of Tomorrow, a programme of theatre, music and dance

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Where: Gyan Manch, 11 Pretoria Street

 Cars on cooking gas worry experts

 - Cheaper fuel, kits make vehicles risky

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after a Maruti Omni burst into flames on Chetla Road, experts sounded a warning on using cooking gas as automobile fuel. The Omni was running on cooking-grade LPG. Fire brigade officials stated that a gas leak from the cylinder had caused the fire.

 More such accidents might occur in future, since several automobiles in the city were being illegally fuelled with cooking gas, held experts. 

 ?For quite some time, we have been informing people that it is illegal to use LPG as motor fuel. Besides, it is totally unsafe. However, a large number of cars in the city are fitted with LPG cylinders, meant for use in the kitchen,? said S. Jhawar, spokesman for the Calcutta Gas Kits Dealers? Forum.

 ?Vehicle-owners opt for cooking gas as it is subsidised. In the process, they turn the four-wheelers into mobile death traps. A major disaster can occur any day,? pointed out Jhawar.

 He added: ?We have brought the matter to the notice of the public vehicles department (PVD) and police a number of times, seeking their intervention to stop the menace. We regret to say that no action has been taken by the administration.?

 Admitting that many cars were plying in the city using cooking gas, PVD officials said it was difficult to identify such vehicles as the cylinders are kept in the trunk and cannot be seen from outside. According to officials in the transport department, at least 200 such cars are plying in Calcutta.

 ?Cooking gas is used as car fuel because it is cheap ? a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder costs Rs 300, while the same volume of auto LPG is priced at Rs 700 ? and the kits also are not expensive,?? elaborated J.S. Khara, owner of a government-approved LPG fitment centre in south Calcutta.

 Automobile experts asserted that auto LPG kits are totally safe and have in-built precautionary mechanisms.

 ?A safety valve and a leak-prevention device is fitted with the gas tank and an indicator is fixed on the dashboard. In case of a gas leak from the tank, the indicator lights up. The flow of gas from the tank is automatically cut off,? Khara stated.

 As per motor vehicles rules, those intending to run cars on LPG need to get a government-approved kit installed at licensed fitment centres. Besides, they must buy the fuel only at government-approved outlets.

 There are 75 registered LPG fitment centres in and around Calcutta.

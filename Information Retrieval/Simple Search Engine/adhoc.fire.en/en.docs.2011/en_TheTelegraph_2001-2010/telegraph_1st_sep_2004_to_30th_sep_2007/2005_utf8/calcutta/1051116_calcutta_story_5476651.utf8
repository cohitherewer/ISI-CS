 Student audience for Buddha

 - Councils at 60 schools and madarsas for redress of problems

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Students at a workshop at the Baguiati school chalk out a plan of action

 Ashish Biswas is a Class X student of a nondescript school in Baguiati. Cooped up in a small room throughout the day, he longs to play football once the classes are over. Unfortunately, he and his fellow students have no right to play in the school playground.

 With no boundary walls protecting the playground, members of local clubs force the students out. They even organise fairs on the plot. After dark, the playground serves as their watering hole. 

 The students have complained several times to the school authorities, but to no avail.

 Now, thanks to an initiative by NGO Prayasam, Ashish and friends can take up their problems with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself. Various government officials will also be at hand to make their school life more pleasant.

 As part of the first-of-its-kind initiative, students of 60 schools and madarsas in the city and some northern suburbs have come together to get their daily problems at school addressed. 

 The students are also forming councils in their schools. Dirty toilets, lack of playground, unhygienic food and pressure of the syllabus are some of the issues that will be discussed by the councils.

 The councils, too, are an initiative of Prayasam, supported by Unicef and the state school education department.

 The students, from schools and madarsas in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Baguiati, Barasat, Barrackpore, Bongaon and other places, will meet the chief minister at Writers? Buildings on November 18. 

 ?Twenty children will be chosen to meet the chief minister and discuss their problems with him,? said Amlan Ganguly of Prayasam. 

 The students will also meet senior officials of the state madarsa board, education, social welfare and health departments, added Ganguly. 

 ?We want to know about AIDS. We will ask the health officers during the meeting to organise awareness programmes at our school,? said one of the students.

 ?Children are in the best position to highlight the problems affecting them. We want to empower them to improve their surroundings. With the help of the councils, the students can achieve their goals,? asserted Sreenath Cheruvari, advocacy and partnership officer of Unicef, Calcutta. 

 The problems are varied. Debashish Mukherjee, a Class IX student of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, complained: ?Drastic changes are being made in the CBSE syllabus and the teachers cannot help it. There is too much stress on social sciences, at the cost of science subjects.? 

 Nargis Parveen, a Class XI student of Hatiara High Madarsa, stated: ?The students? council in our institute meets regularly. A lot of our problems can be solved without bothering the teachers.? 

 ?The toilets in our madarsa are not clean. That is the first issue we want to take up,? she added.

 For Gopa Bannerjee of Belghoria Mahakali Balika Vidyalaya, improving the school library and access to the school?s sports equipment are of prime importance.

 Chandrasekhar Howladar of Jatragachi Pronabananda Uchcha Vidyalaya said small classrooms are a big impediment. ?Seven of us are crammed on to one bench. It sometimes becomes really difficult to concentrate on the lessons,? he held.

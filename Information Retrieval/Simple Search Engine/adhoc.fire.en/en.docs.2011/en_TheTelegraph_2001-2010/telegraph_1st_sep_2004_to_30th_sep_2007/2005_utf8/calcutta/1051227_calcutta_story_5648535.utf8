 Sleaze racket bust nets eight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sleaze racket, which was being run from a massage parlour in Baguiati, was busted on Saturday night. Eight persons, including the owner of the house and four women, were arrested.

 ?Acting on a tip-off, our officers raided a house at Joramandir, under Rajarhat police station, and unearthed the racket,? said S.M.H. Mirza, sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) of Barasat. 

 ?Four women and three clients were found in a compromising position. Several X-rated films, condoms and bottles of liquor were seized from the house,? said Mirza.

 The owner of the house, Debdas Ray, a loner, has three tenants and used to run the racket from two rooms. To attract clients, he had published advertisements for the massage parlour.

 ?A number of touts were in collusion with Debdas. The racket has a strong network in the airport area and other places in the city,? an investigating officer said.

 Debdas had made a fortune from the flesh trade, he added. ?Each client would pay him Rs 4,000 for an hour, of which his share was around half.? 

 Police are not sure how many clients would visit the house daily. ?But the figure is unlikely to be less than 10,? the officer added.

 One of the arrested persons was a businessman from Bangalore. ?He is around 50 and came to the city on a business trip. At the airport, a tout approached him and told him about the racket. He had put up in a hotel in Mechhua and visited Debdas?s house on Christmas eve,? the investigating officer said.

 The husband of one of the arrested women was a criminal. He had been arrested while trying to steal a taxi. 

 ?The names and addresses given to us by the women are being verified. Some of them have already been found to be false,? the officer said.

 ?At least two of the women are from well-to-do families, judging by the way they dressed and talked,? the officer pointed out.

 According to the police, Debdas had been running the racket for the past year. His lifestyle did not match his income. The tenants would pay him Rs 7,000 a month.

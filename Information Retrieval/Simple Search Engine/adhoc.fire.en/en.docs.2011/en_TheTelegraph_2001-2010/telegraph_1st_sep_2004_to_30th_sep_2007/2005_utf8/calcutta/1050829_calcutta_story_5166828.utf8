 Malaria spectre in dengue wake

 OUR BUREAU

 Even as health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra tried to convince the chief minister on Sunday that the dengue situation is under control in Calcutta, another mosquito-borne menace brewed in the city. 

 Findings by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s (CMC) vector control wing have confirmed that the malaria-causing anopheles mosquito, after mutation, has started breeding in dirty water, too. It was believed that the anopheles breeds only in clear water.

 The malaria situation post-monsoon is expected to be complex, civic health officials warned on Sunday.

 According to an officer in the Entally wing of the department, the discovery was made during the bid to identify the breeding grounds of the dengue-causing mosquito, Aedes aegypti. It is believed that the latter breed has mutated similarly.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Sunday held a meeting at Writers? Buildings to take a stock of the dengue situation. The two-hour meeting was attended by minister Mishra, health secretary Kalyan Bagchi, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and CMC commissioner Debashis Som.

 Mishra claimed after the meeting that the disease was under control. ?There has not been an increase in the toll over the past three days. That does not mean we have become complacent. A report was submitted to the chief minister today. The disease is under control,? asserted the health minister.

 Officials of his department, however, said they would prefer to wait before declaring that dengue is under control.

 ?It is true that the toll has not increased beyond nine. But we should wait for another three days before declaring that the outbreak is under control,? reasoned an official.

 The disease had spread the most in south Calcutta. The areas south of Dhakuria and the Lakes were the worst hit.

 ?About 200 people have so far shown symptoms of the disease,? stated health secretary Kalyan Bagchi on Sunday.

 An inter-departmental squabble in the CMC has been the fallout of the outbreak. 

 While the conservancy and drainage departments are critical of the health department for its delayed response to the outbreak, doctors in the department blame the spread of the disease on the drains and vats of the city not being cleared regularly.

 Ode to Ganesha

 Among the gods of the Hindu pantheon, Ganesha has always been a favourite subject with artists, specially because of his elephant?s head, his lovable, pot-bellied figure and his swaying, graceful body. Continuing centuries-old tradition of carving the likeness of the god of health, wealth and prosperity, modern sculptors, too, create images of Ganesha in diverse appearances, inspired by ancient, folk, tribal or even contemporary art forms and styles. Dwideha, the ongoing exhibition of Ganesha sculptures, brings together an exclusive collection by 12 eminent sculptors. On display are aesthetically appealing and elegantly crafted models in bronze, fibre-glass, wood-cut and so on, offering fascinating glimpses into the creative experiences and insights of their creators. Participants: Ramananda Bandyopadhaya, Amitabha Banerjee, Surajit Das, Niranjan Pradhan (one of his sculptures appears above), Manik Talukdar, Shankar Ghosh, Anil Sen, Bimal Kundu, Chandan Bhandari, Ramkumar Manna, Sailen Ghosh and Tapas Sarkar.

 Event: An exhibition of Ganesha sculptures

 When: Till November 1, 4 pm - 8 pm

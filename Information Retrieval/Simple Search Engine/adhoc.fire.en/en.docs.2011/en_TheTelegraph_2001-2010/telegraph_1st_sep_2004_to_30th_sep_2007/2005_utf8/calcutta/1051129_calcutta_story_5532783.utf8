 Share a story, win war on AIDS 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It?s a dreaded disease that?s reaching alarming proportions throughout the world, and India is no exception. But this World AIDS Day, you could do something to make a little difference.

 If you have been affected by HIV/AIDS or are doing something about it, Heyya is urging you to share your story to motivate and inspire others. The mobile content provider is hosting a special section on its website www.heyya.in where visitors can post their tales of courage for everyone to see.

 Heyya is also asking users why they would wear the red ribbon ? the symbol of support for AIDS awareness ? on December 1. The answers can be posted on the site ? along with a photograph ? or sent as an SMS to 8243.

 The site contains loads of information on HIV/AIDS. Five people die every minute and 8,000 every day of AIDS but there are only four ways that it can spread ? through body fluids like blood and semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk.

 The section on safe sex urges the regular use of condoms during intercourse, as it takes a single episode of unprotected sex for the virus to pass on. There are links in this section to other sites offering sexual health advice and more AIDS related information, such as http://www.brook.org.uk and www.playingsafely.co.uk.

 Heyya is hosting AIDS awareness-themed logos and wallpapers ? including a virtual red ribbon ? to download on to the mobile screen. Simply SMS ?hwall 9615? to 8243 for the symbol of support.

 According to a spokesperson for Heyya, the website, launched last month, is witnessing ?2,000 hits? on an average, with ringtone and wallpaper downloads proving to be the most popular sections. 

 ?In the past few months, we have received around 13 lakh SMSs,? the spokesperson added.

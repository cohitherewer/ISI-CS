 Will to win

 Showcasing the works of several renowned city artists, this evenings exhibition of paintings pays a special tribute to the indomitable human spirit. Celebrating the courage, determination and will power of Madhuri Kapur (picture left), a physically challenged artist, it features the gutsy lady painting live before assembled guests. Fittingly titled A Beautiful Mind, the show, hosted by The Oberoi Grand and Spandan, marks a praiseworthy endeavour to highlight, support and encourage the exceptional efforts of those less fortunate. Organised as part of a series of art-shows called Artwalk, Kapur?s painting session will enthrall the audience as she paints, using a head-pointer as a creative tool. Other artists whose works will be on display include Avijit Dutta, Sanatan Dinda, Partha Bhattacharjee, Samir Paul, Partho Dutta, Keshav Roy and Dipanita Das. With a promise to stimulate the heart and soul, lovers of art will surely not miss this unique initiative.

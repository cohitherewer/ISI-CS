The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road-block pandal bar eased for a year

 - 30 pujas will still have to modify structures

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Friday modified its earlier order on traffic-stopper pandals, giving them a breather for Puja 2005.

 The revised order (see graphic) provides an escape route for Durga puja committees found guilty of not toeing the court?s earlier encroachment line ? ?leave at least 50 per cent or 12 ft of road space?.

 A division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly, however, stressed that the modification of the pandal road rules was applicable to this year only.

 ?Considering the religious sentiments of the people and the financial constraints of the organisers, we are modifying our earlier order,? the judges said.

 Despite the relaxation of rules, more than 30 pandals will have to be restructured. In these cases, the organisers have not even left four ft of road space.

 The court order went on to state that puja committees would have to dismantle the pandals ?within 10 days? after the festivities. ?The organisers will have to pay a fine if they fail to do so,? said the bench.

 The decision to modify the earlier directive was taken after advocate-general Balai Ray submitted a report prepared by deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma, in which he pointed out ?some practical difficulties? in implementation of the court order.

 ?This year, 1,125 Sarbojanin pujas are being held, of which 80 pandals have been erected without maintaining the guidelines framed by the police and approved by the high court. Of these, 67 pandals have encroached on most of the road,? said advocate-general Ray.

 Under the relaxed rules, 13 organisers have been given a clean chit, 30 of 67 have been ordered to modify their structures and the rest have been allowed a year.

 As per the earlier order of the court, Anuj Sharma was assigned to visit pandals and prepare a report. ?After doing the rounds, the officer opined that the court should modify its earlier order,? said Ray.

 The advocate-general assured the bench that police would ensure there was no obstruction to free ingress and egress from residences and no inconvenience would be caused to local residents. All residents would have alternative approaches to their doors, Ray added.

 Appearing for a puja committee from Suren Tagore Road, in south Calcutta, Jayanta Mitra told the court that his clients had erected a pandal encroaching the road after taking permission of the people of the locality. He added that if the court did not modify its earlier order, it would be difficult for his clients to hold the puja this year.

 Casablanca (1942)

 Director Michael Curtiz

 Cast Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid

 Plot Rick Blaine (Bogart) owns a nightclub in Casablanca during World War II. Ilsa (Bergman), with whom Rick was once in love, walks into his nightclub. She?s in town with husband Victor Laszlo (Henreid), a resistance leader, with Nazis hot on his trail.

 It was based on the unproduced play Everybody Comes to Rick?s, by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. Even the film?s title was Everybody... before being changed to Casablanca, meaning White House in Spanish.

 In the airport sequence, the aeroplane in the background was, in fact, a cardboard cutout and the people shown working as the flight crew were midgets.

 The character of Sam, the piano player, was almost changed to a female one and actresses like Hazel Scott and Ella Fitzgerald were considered for the role. But Sam stayed male and Doogey Wilson, the only cast member to actually visit the place Casablanca, was picked.

 Herbert Marshall, Dean Jagger and Joseph Cotten were considered for the role of Victor Laszlo before Henreid was cast, who was apprehensive about playing a second lead.

 Bergman was taller than Bogart. To camouflage the difference, Bogart would stand on boxes, sit on pillows and wear platform shoes. In the film, however, the difference in their heights keeps on changing.

 Devdas (2002)

 Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali

 Cast Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai, Jackie Shroff

 Plot Devdas Mukherjee ends up in courtesan Chandramukhi?s haven, having lost his childhood sweetheart Paro to societal pressure. Drinking himself to death in front of Paro?s haveli, Devdas makes his love immortal.

 Bhansali?s Devdas was the eighth screen adaptation of the Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay epic having been made twice in Bengali, twice in Hindi and twice in Telugu and once in the silent era by Nitish Mitra. 

 During the making, there were mishaps galore with deaths on the sets, imprisonment of producer Bharat Shah, Shah Rukh?s bruised back, Aishwarya-Salman face-offs and a Jackie-Bhansali tiff.

 Shah Rukh, who never drank otherwise, used to drink Bacardi every morning on the sets to get into the drunken groove.

 The choreography was first offered to Mamata Shankar but Madhuri?s leaning towards Pandit Birju Maharaj tipped the scales in favour of the Kathak exponent. It was his uncle Pandit Lachchu Maharaj who had choreographed Mughal-e-Azam.

 After the release, Chennai traffic police used the advertising tagline: ?Devdas never drove. Don?t drink and drive.?

 The role of Chunnilal was first offered to Saif Ali Khan and then Govinda before Jackie was approached for the part.

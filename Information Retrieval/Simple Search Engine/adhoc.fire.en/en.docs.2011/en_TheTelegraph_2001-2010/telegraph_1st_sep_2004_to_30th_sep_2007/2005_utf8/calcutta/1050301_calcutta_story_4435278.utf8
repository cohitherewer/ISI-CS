The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Several shades of grey in the colour Black

 Black is beautiful. Undoubtedly. I have received calls from Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai and London asking me why I don?t act in films like Black or think of making one like it. The questions, of course, are rhetorical and answer themselves in the asking. But just in case you think I am hedging away from telling you the truth, let me quickly clarify that first, I am not offered films like it (now, don?t ask me, ?why?) and second, everyone from Sanjeev Goenka to Ramoji Rao run a mile from anything I propose. After having mulled over and chewed upon my proposal for weeks, they eventually spit it out and ask me, politely, to wait till a propitious move of shukra into the house of surya; or was it the other way around? So you might say the stars are against me or you may, like I do, simply resign yourselves to accepting my level of mediocrity ? I?d hate to say incompetence.

 The next problem I face with Black is that everywhere I go these days I am expected to give people a sermon on my take on the film. For some strange reason they all believe that I am in touch with the spirits of Ray and Lean and shall speak, possessed, in their learned voices. Those who know me a little better also know of my association with the blind and mentally challenged and that apparently gives me a significantly better edge and insight into the portrayals they have so admired.

 Rather than fob off any more phone calls, idle curiosity or be hounded by those who think I have no stomach for sour grapes, I thought it best to pen a few observations for you all to criticise, argue about and crucify me for, or replace me on the pedestal that I never wanted or created for myself.

Black is beautiful.

 For those of us, and that is a very large number, who knew Amit in the days when he was a strutter and fretter with the Amateurs, here in Calcutta, we have to admit that he has done us proud. With his English-stage background and his incomparable (in Bollywood) command over Hindi, Amit has given us a performance of a lifetime. I only wish that in the very first scene where he showcased his talents to lip-smacking perfection, the director had given us some idea of what his real qualifications were to take a blind and deaf child under his wing. Eventually, that the actual onset of his Alzheimer?s condition and the progression of the disease was irreverentially handled in the film is a fault of the script, not his. Those of you who have seen A Beautiful Mind will know what I am talking about and there really is no harm comparing one good film with another.

 Chippy Ganjee, who is a very fine actor and who also hails from this fair city, looked constrained and restricted by the director in the scenes where he hands over the Braille books and also where he brings Michelle (Rani) home after a brilliantly conceived, and acted, ice-cream scene.

 Another of our old friends, Sundar (Dhritiman), is the only one in the cast of diamonds whose facets were blurred and dull. How he was never able to tap into the depths of such a character is something that has to have a reason other than just a performance because we all know he can act brilliantly.

 Rani Mukherjee, of course, for all she has achieved up to now, is in the unenviable position of being young and having a lifetime of work ahead of her with only the remotest of chances that she will ever get a part as great as this to showcase her talents. She was great. But yes, as an observant Parsi friend of mine had pointed out, in SLB?s bizarre juxtaposition of a poster of Chaplin?s The Kid with Michelle?s first steps out into the world, Rani was obviously asked, or inspired, to walk like Charlie and that was the only unbearable blemish to an otherwise astounding performance.

 But look at it whichever way you might or judge it any way you want and Shernaz Patel and little Ayesha Kapur both deserve a standing ovation for their incredibly controlled and intense performances. Hats off to them both, and SLB, for achieving it. If SLB has clout within the industry, these two actors will be showered with awards. If they are not, let them receive this public salute from me, in all humility, for performances that I have learned a lot from and that acting schools should show clips of to demonstrate what our profession is all about. No obvious make up, no gimmicks, no walks or talks, just ?thinking? ? the only quality that an actor ever needs to possess.

 Whatever Bhansali may have done to restrict Chippy and Sundar he sure directed Shahnaz and Ayesha extremely well and inspired them to give performances that will be remembered for years to come. Nandana Dev Sen?s (another Calcuttan?) Sarah, was a touching cameo delicately handled by SLB ? her performance in the engagement dinner scene was sensational.

 Criticising Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a mean and ignoble task. His commitment to making good entertaining cinema is beyond reproach. That he knows what it takes to make a great film is obvious in almost every frame. His attention to details (whether you like them or not) is phenomenal. His pictorial visualisation is mesmerising. So then what did I not like about all this? Quite a lot.

 First, subjectively speaking, the overtly ostentatious lifestyle of the Anglo Indian family was uncharacteristic and way, way over the top. Its taste in art from Rembrandts to pathetic sculpture, in furniture from Edwardian to what could easily have been Saharanpurian, was Catholicism taken to an extreme. As for the retinue of servants available to shift all that stuff across corridors and up and down stairs, whew!

 And since we got no hint from either the d?cor or dialogue, what exactly did this multimillionaire individual do that needed him to travel for 20 days away from the hundreds of acres of apple orchards I presume he also owned? And the clich?d Bollywood touch of having a Goan maid, Miss Gomes, was the final pimple in the family?s face. Finally, for the master of such an upper-class home to be as unenlightened as poor Sundar was made out to be, must have been a genetic flaw that the actor, if informed about it, would have played to perfection. 

 Then, neither is blindness nor Alzheimer?s disease dealt with as one sees and understands these handicaps in everyday life. Alzheimer is a tragic condition. Broadly speaking, a person with Alzheimer?s disease is known to suddenly lose it all but, not to the point where, as in the first instance we see it in the film, the patient consciously tells the professor that he does not know how to leave the room. You will understand what I mean when you watch and compare this with the ice-cream sequence where the victim suddenly loses it all and wanders off without direction or purpose ? as actually happens in real life. Sure you will find people with dementia walking aimlessly around a room because they have no idea how to get out but if they had the consciousness to ask for a door, they would find it is what I am getting at.

 Also, if you will forgive my nit-picking at a great film, the 20 days in which the teacher had to prove his worth didn?t have enough progression, substance and meat. A tall demand, undoubtedly, when a film cannot run for three hours, but an area that perhaps leaves us asking for and wanting more. 

 Finally, the visuals. My God, the lighting, framing and camera operations were all simply fantastic from the very first frame to the last. But with an intimate story like Black being set in a mansion with a dinner setting worthy of the house of Windsor and a church wedding that poor Charles and Camilla will be deprived of and an Oxbridgeish college that looks like it was taken out of the pages of a travel brochure, they all led to an unforgivable self-indulgence where the lighting and framing became an orgy of hedonism by a director who obviously loves his visuals.

 Let me end by congratulating Sanjay Leela Bhansali for making a film that has none of the pretensions of ?trying to make a different kind of film?. But it was. And that is what will make Black find its niche among the best Hindi ?commercial? (how I hate that term) films ever made.

 Years ago, at Cannes, my kissing Sathilekha in Tagore?s Ghare Baire was reported in the French media as the ?Kiss of the Festival? and Satyajit Ray called me in London to tell me so. Well, Mr Bhansali, let me tell you that the kiss in your film has left an indelible impression on my psyche; it was brilliantly conceived, brilliantly performed, brilliantly picturised, and one of the finest moments in cinema that it has been my privilege to ever witness.

 That just about sums up my reaction to a great film. Would I see it a second time? Perhaps not. Why? Because everything I have said in this piece would bother me all over again. But if you see me sneak into the theatre, for a kiss, forgive me.

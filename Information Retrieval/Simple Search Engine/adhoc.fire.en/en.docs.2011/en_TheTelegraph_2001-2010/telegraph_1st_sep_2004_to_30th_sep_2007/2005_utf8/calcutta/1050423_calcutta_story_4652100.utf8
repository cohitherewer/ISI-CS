 Ashalata to Sunita

 Raima Sen dons the 60s look with an Abhishek Dutta creation. ldquo;It rsquo;s the Sharmila Tagore look, complete with the bouffant, fringe, dark glasses and red lipstick. It is also similar to what I look like in Parineeta, rdquo; says Raima, in a red georgette fishtail sari embellished with embroidery, Swarovski crystals and a Bengali-style corset with crochet sleeves.

 The demure young girl probably does the least amount of talking among the six characters in Sandip Ray?s Nishijapon, but Suchitra Sen?s granddaughter has grabbed a good share of audience attention from co-actors of the stature of Soumitra Chatterjee, Dipankar De, Sabyasachi Chakraborty and Rituparna Sengupta.

 And Chokher Bali?s Ashalata is relishing her new role of the quintessential soft-spoken Bengali girl Sunita who wanders in her own world and often breaks into a Tagore song. ?After Chokher Bali, Nishijapon is very refreshing because it?s a contemporary Bengali film. And when people still praise me for something I did two years ago, it?s very tiring,? says Raima, who feels Ray?s film will change some of the notions about her.

 ?There is a general idea that I need to be shown what to do in a scene. Rituda would actually show what I am supposed to do. I just had to copy him because he needs what he visualises. That?s a kind of method acting. While shooting for Nishijapon, I would pester Babuda (Sandip Ray) to show me the expressions but he would insist that I do them first. He would intervene when he didn?t like them.?

 Raima recounts having read the Nishijapon script thoroughly while shooting for Parineeta. ?Babuda had written all the expressions he wanted in the script. And he did show me a number of times, but he also gave me a lot of liberty. That instils so much confidence in an actor. I felt I could do it on my own,? says she, lapping up the congratulatory SMSs streaming in from the film industry.

 ?After Chokher Bali, word got around that I can?t speak Bengali and directors didn?t want to cast me. I wasn?t too sure myself when Babuda asked to me to dub for Nishijapon. He stood right behind me at the recording studio and I was repeating him like a parrot. But I am glad I dubbed for myself,? she chirps.

 Back in Bollywood, Raima still has some leftover work to catch up on for Anubhav Sinha?s multi-starrer Dus and Pradeep Sarkar?s Parineeta, which is due for release in June.

 In Parineeta, Raima plays the ?bubbly, loud and na?ve? Koel, an extension of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay?s original Annakali in the novel. ?She is besotted by Girish (Sanjay Dutt) and she is someone I have never played before. I am not like her at all and sometimes she gets on my nerves,? laughs Raima.

 Down south, her Telugu film Deriyam has done average business but Raima is keen to try more of the genre. ?Working in these films helps you learn a lot about acting. They have a different style of functioning altogether,? she feels.

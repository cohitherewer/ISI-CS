The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hamari Amrita, back with a bang

 From ghare to baire, Amrita Singh is back where she belongs ? on screen. After the reams written about her sordid split with Saif, she is now back in print for the right reasons and definitely, in the right frame of mind.

 Ektaa Kapoor is heralding the big comeback with her new serial Kkavyanjali, which will hit STAR Plus from January 25, Monday to Thursday, 9.30 pm. ?I needed a job immediately. I had to support myself. And what better way than Balaji, the best banner on television,? Amrita told Metro.

 But logic says that Amrita would have preferred the celluloid platform and a big banner to go with it for that perfect comeback. ?I did the best I could have done at that moment. Film is of course where my roots are. I have been getting quite a few offers. And I have been turning all of them down. Nothing has really excited me yet. I will only do films again if I can do them on my own terms,? said Amrita.

 For now, the actress, who burst on to the scene with Betaab and then sparkled as Chameli opposite Anil Kapoor in Chameli Ki Shaadi, is happy with just one soap. ?I have two children to take care of. With Kkavyanjali, I can work for 15 days a month and stay with my kids for the other 15 days. For me to do any project, it has to justify leaving my kids and going out to work.?

 In the serial, Amrita plays Nitya, the widow of Mayank and the eldest bahu of the Nanda family. ?Extremely well turned out, well read and smart, Nitya is the saviour of the family who adores her only son Kkavya and is a strong force in his life.? 

 Added the actress: ?It?s something Ektaa has never done before. It?s also something I have never done before and I am really excited about the whole thing. It is a great job I have and I am happy that I have been able to come back to acting at a time when I wanted to. ?

 The promos of the Balaji serial have already created a stir and Amrita?s look has found favour. ?I am not garishly dressed. Very traditionally, in fact. I am a widow but do not wear white khadi saris. I have been trying to add to the character in my own way with whatever experience I have gathered over the years. I hope my look and my character go down well with the audience just like Ektaa?s other characters have.?

 The broken marriage and all the media deliberations over her divorce with the Nawab family shouldn?t act as a mental baggage for her, felt Amrita. ?At the end of the day, I have to support myself. I cannot compete with my past. I have to move on.?

 But what happens to all those who have been hearing and reading about the problems in her personal life? Will they look at Amrita Singh?s Nitya in Kkavyanjali with a diffused vision? ?I think there will be an intrigue value that will be added to my image when everyone sees me in the serial. But that is not something I can bank on for my return. Because it will be temporary.?

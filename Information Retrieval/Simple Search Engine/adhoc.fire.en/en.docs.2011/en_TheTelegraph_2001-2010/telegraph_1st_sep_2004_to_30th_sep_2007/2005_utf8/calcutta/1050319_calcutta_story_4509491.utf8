 It?s state-of-the-art for science theatre

 A clutch of visually-handicapped students listen to environmentalist Arup Chakraborty, a blind bird-lover, as he takes them through varied bird calls to give them a taste of nature, at an event at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM). 

 Perhaps at next year?s programme, they?ll be able to hear the sounds through a state-of-the-art sound system.

 The museum, after a year-long process of getting funds from the government and the required approvals and licences, is in the process of improving it?s auditorium. 

 The improved version, to be ready by May, according to director Jayanta Sthanapati, will be bigger and better. The current seating capacity of 169 will be upped to 210. There will be creative lighting ? moving spotlights, coloured lights, fade-in and fade-out, on and off stage ? as well as better sound systems, with improved acoustics, added Sthanapati.

 ?We wanted a better and bigger facility for our science demonstration lectures, to accommodate more students. Sometimes, several schools sign up at once,? explained the director.

 In addition, there will be a greenroom and VIP room, backstage. ?The stage is very small. We wanted more space for the annual science drama competition, so the students could be comfortable.?

 Besides this, NGOs, working in the field of science, will be allowed free use of the facility. ?We don?t do this at a profit. And there are a lot of NGOs who do good work, but are stuck for funds and space. This will give them an opportunity as well,? Sthanapati signed off.

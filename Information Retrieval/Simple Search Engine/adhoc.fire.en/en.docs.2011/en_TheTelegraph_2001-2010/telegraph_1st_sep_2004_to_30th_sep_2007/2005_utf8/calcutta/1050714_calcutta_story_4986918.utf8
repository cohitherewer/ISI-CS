 State mulls Bill to protect its trees

 OUR BUREAU

 The state government is planning to introduce a Bill to restrict tree-felling in and around Calcutta.

 ?Once the Bill is passed, felling of trees will become punishable by fine as well as imprisonment,? forest minister Jogesh Burman said on Wednesday.

 The Bill, currently being examined by the law department, will be placed in the Assembly during the winter session.

 During the day, mayoral council member Fayaz Khan, in charge of parks and gardens, asserted that outdoor advertising agencies had been informed that they would not be allowed to trim trees to increase the visibility of their billboards. He was reacting to the trimming of 18 trees along AJC Bose Road on Tuesday. An FIR has been lodged at Park Street police station against the incident. 

 President of the association of outdoor advertising agencies Anjan Banerjee said: ?Tuesday?s trimming was carried out by a company that has entered into a joint venture with Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the police to construct 100 police assistance booths all over the city. When a tree diminishes the visibility of a billboard, we don?t trim the tree, but move the billboard. We have recently done just that in Behala and Beleghata,? he added. 

 Engineers of the civic lighting department pointed out that they need to trim trees when foliage obstructs street-lighting or traffic signals. ?Sprucing of trees is essential in the city, but it must be carried out under the supervision of the parks and gardens? wing of the CMC,? an engineer said.

 For better surveillance, the wing has started stocktaking of trees in over 50 city parks. The borough in-charges of parks and gardens have been asked to submit a status report to Khan in two week?s time.

 ?We have no authentic document on the present green coverage status of the city. We need the ground-level study to set a benchmark for future planning,? mayor Bikash Bhattacharya said. 

 According to him, the national standard for green coverage of a city is 15 per cent of the total area. The figure for Calcutta is only nine per cent.

 Mayor Bhattacharya has directed Khan to arrange a hydraulic ramp for trimming trees.

 Meanwhile, it has been decided that about 100,400 saplings will be planted in Calcutta during Aranya Saptaha, to be observed between July 14 and July 20. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate the programme on July 15 by planting trees and opening the herbal garden at Prinsep Ghat. 

 The CMC is expected to plant 30,000 saplings on roadsides, parks and in schools and colleges, while the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will plant 15,000 saplings along the EM Bypass during monsoon. The municipal affairs department has been entrusted with planting 5,000 trees on roadsides. Hidco will plant another 5,000 saplings in Rajarhat.

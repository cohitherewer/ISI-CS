 Defile check on park waterbody

 To protect the waterbody inside Banabitan, in Salt Lake, from pollution, the state forest department has initiated preventive measures.

 Though there is a wall around the park, hundreds of slum-dwellers from the adjoining areas sneak in through a breach near the international bus terminus in Karunamoyee and use the waterbody for bathing, and washing clothes and utensils.

 ?We are constructing a wall in the area near the international bus terminus so that no one can enter Banabitan illegally,? said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests. The forest department has directed guards to keep a close vigil on the breach until the wall is built.

 ?It is difficult to keep a watch on a park spread over 55 acres with the number of security personnel we have. But our department is trying its best to save the waterbody from pollution,? said a senior security official at Banabitan.

 Presently, visitors have to pay Rs 10 to enter the park. The forest department introduced the entry fee five years ago. Slum dwellers, who have been using the waterbody for more than a decade now, do not pay to enter the premises.

 The forest department earns a good amount from anglers as well.

 ?We charge Rs 150 per person for fishing in the waterbody. Over the past few years, we have noticed that the fish count has come down as local people use the water for bathing and washing clothes. The pollution level of the water is on the rise. The situation may soon go out of hand,? Mukherjee explained.

 Apart from taking anti-pollution measures, the Banabitan authorities have started a project to repair the six-km road inside the park before monsoon.

 Morning-walkers have complained to the authorities that the road is unfit for use.

 To boost revenue collection, the park authorities are contemplating introduction of a fee for morning-walkers.

 ?We are planning to collect a fee from morning-walkers. But before we do that, we want to ensure that all the amenities are in place,? said forest minister Jogesh Barman.

 The forest department has installed a music system in the park, exclusively for morning-walkers. 

 ?Speakers have been put up on all the lamp posts. Instrumental and vocal music are played on the music system to entertain people who visit the park for a walk,? signed off Mukherjee.

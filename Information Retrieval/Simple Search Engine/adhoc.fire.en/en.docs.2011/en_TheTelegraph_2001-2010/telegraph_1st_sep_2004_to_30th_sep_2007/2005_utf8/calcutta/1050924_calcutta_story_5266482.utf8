 A grand dining delight

 An assortment of wines from the world over, teamed with the right kind of food ? thats the flavour of a month-long Grande Cru Dining festival at La Terrasse, the multi-speciality restaurant at The Oberoi Grand.

 The range of appetisers is truly global. Take the New World House Salad ? seasonal greens, asparagus, peeled peppers, Kalamata olives, shiitake and straw mushrooms tossed in Mediterranean balsamic and sesame vinaigrette with shavings of Pecorino Romano. 

 Then there is the Refreshing Bean Sprout Salad with scallions, crisp Chinese cabbage, pine nuts and Szechuan preserved vegetables with peanut dressing. An all-time favourite is the Caesar Salad with asiago, anchovies and foccacia croutons topped with Cajun spiced chicken skewer to savour.

 In the soup section you can choose from the Yellow Pumpkin Soup with Coconut Cream and Lime or the Mellow Miso Soup with Shrimps, Soba Noodle, Nori and Silken Tofu Sliver to further boost your appetite.

 You could even try the Asparagus with Bean Thread or the Watermelon Gazpacho with Palm Hearts.

 Waiting for you in the main course is a sumptuous spread. Executive chef George K. Georges favourite from this fare is the Five-Spice-Dusted Duck Breast and Crisp Skin Duck Leg with Natural Unpolished Rice and Apricot Port Wine Reduction. 

 He also recommends the Hoisin and Mint Crusted Rack of Lamb with Preserved Black Bean Polenta and Borlotti Bean Ragu.

 You could round this meal off with Green Tea Cr?me Brulee with Rose Petal Biscotti or have the Chocolate and Grand Marnier Mousse with Champagne Flamb?ed Cr?me Anglaise. 

 There are exquisite wines, both red and white, to accompany this meal. In the white wine section you could choose from Chinkara Chardonnay from Australia or Grover Vineyard Sauvigon Blanc from Bangalore.

 The red wine section offers Kendall Jackson Vinters Reserve Pinot Noir from California, Stags Leap Winery Merlot from Napa Valley of the US and more.

 Its a festival of style ? a combination of the rarest and the best of wines and foods, claims chef George.

 The festival is on for both lunch and dinner and a meal for two, inclusive of taxes and wines (if you opt for them), will cost around Rs 1,500.

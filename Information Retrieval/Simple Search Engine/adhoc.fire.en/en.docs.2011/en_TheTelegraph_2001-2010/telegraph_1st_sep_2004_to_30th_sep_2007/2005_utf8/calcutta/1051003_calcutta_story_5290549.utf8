 Clinics offer helping hand

 - Collaboration proposal with hospital?s cardiology centre

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 In a boost to the state government?s bid to foster private-public partnership in healthcare, Apollo Gleneagles and Suraksha hospitals have offered to collaborate with RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. 

 The private clinics primarily want to provide assistance to the cardiology centre at RG Kar, recently inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The centre is already facing a dearth of surgeons. Collaboration in neurology, nephrology and orthopaedics is also on the cards.

 ?A written proposal has been submitted to the health department. In accordance with the state government?s private-public partnership policy, we have proposed to collaborate in the areas of super-speciality care, treatment and surgery at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The matter will be discussed with the health minister,? said S.N. Reddy, chief executive officer of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. 

 As per the proposal, the hospital will provide the government facility sophisticated equipment like scanning machines, apart from surgeons. Private expertise will also be utilised in tertiary care. 

 ?We are interested in high-profile surgeries, like open-heart surgery, cardio-thoracic surgery and neuro-surgery. The government will provide the basic infrastructure,? added Reddy.

 Suraksha Hospital also wants to collaborate with the cardiology centre at RG Kar. An expression of interest by the private hospital has been sent to the government.

 A team from Suraksha has already visited RG Kar. It surveyed the infrastructure and held talks with Abhjit Banerjee, head of the cardiology department of the hospital.

 The authorities of Suraksha are expected to visit RG Kar in end-October to work out the details of the collaboration. 

 ?We have to decide on a number of things before the proposal materialises. We have expressed our interest regarding the cardiology centre and held talks with the hospital authorities. The infrastructure of the centre is very good. However, there is a dearth of cardiac surgeons and that?s where we come in,? explained Satadal Saha, executive vice-president of Suraksha. 

 The fee structure to be offered to the patients, continuity of care and some other factors are yet to be discussed.

 ?Our doctors will perform the surgeries, but who will provide the care afterwards has not been decided. The fees should be affordable to the general people. There is also the question of responsibility and accountability of the surgeons,? signed off Saha.

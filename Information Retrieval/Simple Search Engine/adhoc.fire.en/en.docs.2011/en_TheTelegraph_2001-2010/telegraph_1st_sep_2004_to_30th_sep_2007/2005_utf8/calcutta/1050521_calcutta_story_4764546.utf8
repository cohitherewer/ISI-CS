 A woman of no importance

 Life has always given women an unfair deal. Throughout history, their feelings and desires have been deliberately trampled upon, wilfully ignored and overlooked, thus relegating them to a position of utter helplessness from where they cannot express themselves or lead meaningful lives. Nabamayukh Nattya Sangstha?s latest production, Urmila Upakhyan, borrows an oft-forgotten episode from the Ramayana to highlight the social pressures on women and the subjugation, dishonour and indignity they must endure all through their lives. In the play, as in the epic, Urmila, Lakshman?s wife, has to bow down to social norms and lead a life of abject misery, although fully conscious of the injustice being meted out to her. She leads a lonely, forsaken life, being neglected by her husband, who follows Rama and Sita to Dandakaranya, totally disregarding her needs. Later, when she clearly sees through the politically-motivated ploys of Kaikayee and Manthara, she raises her voice in protest, only to be imprisoned. Slighted by society, as by her husband, she remains forever, the archetypal figure of the wronged woman. Direction: Rishi Mukherjee.

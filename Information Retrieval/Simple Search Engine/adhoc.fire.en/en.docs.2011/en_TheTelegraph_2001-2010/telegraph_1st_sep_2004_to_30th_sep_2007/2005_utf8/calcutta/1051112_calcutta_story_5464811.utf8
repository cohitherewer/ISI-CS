The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An inward journey

 Portraying the ugly world of incest that lurks behind the shadows of so-called civilised society, 30 Days in September attempts to uncover the causes of complex, even unnatural human psychological needs. It probes into the deep recesses of the human mind, trying to unearth the sources and derive an understanding of incestuous desires. Written by Mahesh Dattani, the play is an intense and gripping tale of love and betrayal, exploring the brutal severance of the unbreakable bond between an adult and a child. In it, a mother (Lillete Dubey) discovers the truth about her daughter (Neha Dubey), which sets them both on a journey of self-discovery about their own lives and their inextricably-linked past. Direction: Lillete Dubey. Presented by Sanskriti Sagar.

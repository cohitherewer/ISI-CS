The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boycott cry on campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The stage is set for another long-drawn battle at Jadavpur University, with faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) on Wednesday declaring that its movement against the authorities will continue for an indefinite period.

 Academic activities remained paralysed, with students of all 16 departments of engineering and technology faculty staying away from classrooms.

 ?We are determined to continue our movement till the authorities respond to our demand,? Fetsu general secretary Amit Chakraborty said. 

 The students have called for measures by the authorities to result in the dropping of all charges by the police against nine students.

 Fetsu had launched the class-boycott on November 9 to protest against issuance of the arrest warrants by Alipore court against the nine students for allegedly assaulting policemen on the night of June 10. The cases had been filed by the South 24-Parganas police.

 ?We are shocked that the authorities are doing nothing, despite being fully aware that the police have framed false charges against us,? said Parag Banerjee, another Fetsu leader.

 University registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay countered: ?As the cases were filed by the police, we have to follow certain formalities. We understand the students? problem, but it is not possible for us to do only as they please.?

 ?There was only a small group of students at the incident site on June 10. The number of cops was much more. Can it be believed that these students, weak after prolonged fasting, could assault so many policemen?? the Fetsu leaders asked.

 Threatening to further intensify their movement, the agitators said: ?We are going to distribute leaflets all across the city, enlisting the events planned as part of our agitation. We will also reveal how we are being harassed by the police.?

 The Fetsu leaders have also decided to visit different educational institutions, like Presidency College and Calcutta University, to garner support for their movement.

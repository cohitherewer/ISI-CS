The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sensitive soliloquies

 Rebuked and condemned for standing up for their rights, women down the ages have, nevertheless, unfailingly raised their voices in protest against atrocities committed on them. Hosted by Oxford Bookstore, Feminine Monologues presents solo enactments of stories about women from different periods of history, celebrating their power, determination and resilience. Comprising four performances by leading actresses of the stage and screen, the programme explores the trials and triumphs of women of all ages and times, sensitively weaving their stories into a contemporary context. Featuring Dolly Basu in Maang (Hindi) written by Jaamal Abroo, Anashua Mazumdar in The Last Flame (English) written by Indrashish Laharry, Sudipa Basu in Tagore?s Rabibare Biva (Bengali) and Renu Roy in The Divorce (English) written by Nag Bodas, the evening promises to be an experience to remember, bringing the four thespians on stage together for the first time, who empower the scene with their strong, individual performances.

 Event: Feminine Monologues, solo enactments by women thespians

 When: Today at 7 pm

 Where: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

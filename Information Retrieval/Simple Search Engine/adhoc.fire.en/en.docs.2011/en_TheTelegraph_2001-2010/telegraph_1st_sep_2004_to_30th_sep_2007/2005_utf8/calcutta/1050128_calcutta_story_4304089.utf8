Chit Ch@t 

A Monsoon of Tears? 

Night

Twinkling stars, 

Monsoon?s rain falls 

Reflections in every tear 

Each one from heaven falling 

To drench me, in blessings here? 

On Earth, 

I see wet 

Pouring down each pipe 

Cleaning dirt of every kind 

Adding hue to black and white 

Searching for more than you can see? 

A blue sky. 

Drying as it pours 

Screaming and whining in pain 

Though it?s called thunder and lightning 

Darkness covering the sky today, haunts me 

Cornered by shadows, as they come my way?

Barkha Sharda, Ashok Hall 

Some Other Place

I stood on the edge of the cliff 

Breathing the misty gale, 

Stood there watching bewildered 

The sunless sky turn pale. 

The ocean before me was calm 

The birds were breathing the balm 

Of the winds, with the fragrance of nature 

Which is nature?s invisible feature. 

The night is fast covering the sky 

Moon still seems to be very high 

Smiling at the countless stars 

Resembling a city street full of cars. 

I painted this scene 

In my mind?s canvas, to 

Adorn with this flower 

My mind?s empty vase.

GD Birla Centre for Education 

 Get Romantic

 A fun-filled fiesta in the Romantic mode. It?s time 

again for the annual inter-college quiz organised by the Centre for Studies in 

Romantic Literature. The ninth edition of the quiz, known to mix text book and 

trivia, will be held on the morning of February 2 at the HL Roy auditorium at 

Jadavpur University. The Centre invites two-member teams of students for what 

promises to cover all aspects of the Romantic age in English literature. 

 But the event is not just about Keats and Coleridge, Byron and the Brontes. The composers and painters of the age and historical facts around the world creep in as well. The curtains come down with a round of dumb charade.

 The quiz is the concluding programme of an eventful two days of academic discussions. Professor Nigel Leask of Glasgow University, a known figure in the literature circuit, will be the visiting speaker from the UK this year. But it is the students who form the bulk of the speakers, holding forth on horror (Frankenstein) and homely village life (Jane Austen).

 For registration, contact the Centre at 2247-6324.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 B-school of Delhi in 2006

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is all set to open its city branch by the end of this financial year. The Delhi-based B-school specialises in conducting management programmes on issues related to international business.

 ?We are awaiting the release of a Rs 2.53-crore government grant to launch our courses in Calcutta by July 2006,? said a spokesperson for the institute. 

 The central government has earmarked around Rs 10 crore for IIFT?s Calcutta plans and the authorities have already held preliminary discussions with the state government for land and other infrastructure support.

 ?Our director, Prabir Sengupta, had met representatives of the state government and we have been told that getting land would not be a problem,? said the spokesperson, adding that the institute is looking for 10 acres to set up a campus. 

 Construction of the building will start once the government releases the remaining Rs 8.5 crore in the next fiscal. So, the institute will begin its Calcutta venture from a rented place, as setting up own infrastructure would take time.

 The activity roster for the first year includes launch of the flagship two-year programme in international business with a batch-size of 60 and the four-month certification programme on export management. IIFT authorities are also planning to conduct around 10 management development programmes.

 IIFT also plans to offer specialised electives like agriculture, textile and automobiles, besides equipping students with education on derivatives, risk management and commodity futures. International trade policy issues will be the other area of academic focus.

 ?While there are institutes in south and west India that teach such courses, there is none in the east and so we decided to open a branch in Calcutta,? added the spokesperson.

Tipple talk

Global eye

The time has come to take your drink seriously. If 

you scoff at what seems to be a tippler?s desperate clutch at company, pay heed 

instead to two indicators too substantial to dismiss.

History?s sanction

If a museum lends a touch of dignity, the cocktail 

is weightier like never before. The Museum of the American Cocktail has opened 

in New Orleans, where drinking tools ? like art deco cocktail shakers and swizzle 

sticks ? are on display, alongside a timeline of the evolution of the American 

cocktail. It starts in the early 19th century, through Prohibition to the days 

of abandoned drinking of the 1930s. According to the founders (highbrow drinkers 

who take their liquor without a pinch of salt), the cocktail was revived in the 

1990s, after decades of neglect.

The museum is still looking for a permanent home to 

display its plethora of antiques and thousands of books to do with drinking and 

mixing beverages tall and short, strong and sweet.

The museum could hardly be complete without a place 

to recreate forgotten pleasures. Ever heard of a whisky swizzle? Well, it shakes 

up a mean combination of rye whiskey, soda, lime juice, sugar and aromatic bitters. 

Or, try a sherry twist, that blends cocktail sherry, orange juice, bourbon, lemon 

juice and Cointreau.

Just in case you aren?t planning a trip to the Big 

Easy any time soon, here is a test sip: the exhibit starts in 1806 with the first 

recorded reference to the term, in a New York newspaper. An editor defined a cocktail 

as ?a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water and bitters?.

Pop permit

Wine was always considered with gravity, and the film 

Sideways (a still above) has given it a pop twist. In the film, 

two friends fanatical about their vintage go for a drive through California?s 

wine country. Actor Paul Giamatti admits he finds the seriousness with which his 

character treats it ?silly?. But the drinking public doesn?t agree. Not only did 

the film?s success push up sales of pinot noir, the favoured variety in the movie, 

but pinot has also popped up as the number one show-business word to influence 

the language last year, according to a Global Language Monitor study.

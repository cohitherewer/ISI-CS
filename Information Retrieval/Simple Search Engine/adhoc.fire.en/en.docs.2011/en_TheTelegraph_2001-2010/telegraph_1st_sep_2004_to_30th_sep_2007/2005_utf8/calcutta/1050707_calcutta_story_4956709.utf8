 Young ?n? fit is new state bus mantra

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to ensure road safety, the transport department has already imposed curbs on issuing driving licences to those who have crossed 50. 

 Now, it intends to replace the drivers and conductors of state buses who have reached that age. ?Most of our drivers are 50-plus and have high minus-powered glasses, signs of poor vision,? said a Calcutta State Transport Corporation official.

 He added: ?Besides, they are not in a position to ply buses on long routes because of various ailments. As a result, we cannot make optimum utilisation of our fleet, causing a sharp drop in revenue. Safety of our passengers will be severely compromised with if drivers with poor vision and age-related ailments are allowed to sit at the wheel.?

 The corporation presently plies around 1,000 vehicles on various routes in the city and employs nearly 4,000 drivers and conductors. Another 200 buses are to join the fleet soon.

 ?A bus that can make five-six trips daily cannot ply more than two or three times, as the driver is unable to bear the load. We will surely exploit our fleet better and earn much more if younger persons sit at the wheel,? the official explained. 

 According to the plan, the corporation will recruit around 1,000 young drivers and conductors, who will be given a fixed remuneration, plus 10 per cent of the proceeds from ticket sales on a particular bus.

 ?The proposal has been sent to the transport department and recruitment will start as soon as we get the approval,? said corporation managing director Ashok Bhattacharya.

 ?The move is aimed at earning more revenue through optimum utilisation of our manpower and vehicles. Our target is to earn Rs 28 lakh daily from ticket sales, and the drivers and conductors will have to play a key role in achieving it. I believe young and fit persons are better placed for the role,? he added.

 The decision comes close on the heels of the observation of the Assembly subject committee on transport, that the corporation should take effective steps in increasing revenue by ensuring optimum utilisation of the fleet and reduction of the staff-vehicle ratio.

 ?The corporation has no alternative, as the government has made it clear that it will not be able to sustain any longer the huge subsidy in the transport sector,? said subject committee chairman Sadhan Pande.

 ?There are enough opportunities for the corporation to increase revenue and become self-dependent,? he added.

 Managing director Bhattacharya said health check-up camps would be held soon for the drivers and conductors to ascertain whether they are fit enough to be on the road. 

 ?The camps will be organised at all our 11 depots in the city. The drivers who will be found physically unfit will not be allowed to sit at the wheel,? he added.

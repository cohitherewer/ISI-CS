The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Touch up for heritage hub

 Shankar Ghosh: Is there any plan to beautify Dalhousie Square? If you are indeed interested in preserving colonial heritage, why don?t we revert back to the original name of the area from BBD Bag?

 The state government, the CMC and other agencies will join hands to beautify Dalhousie Square. The area has already been declared a heritage zone. The CMC?s involvement will be limited to providing a facelift to the pavements, applying a mastic asphalt coat to the roads and replacing the existing lamp posts with those of the Victorian era.

 Benoy, Badal and Dinesh sacrificed their lives by fighting against the colonial rule and they are as much a part of the history of Dalhousie Square as the British.

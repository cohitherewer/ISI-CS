 Dengue test misleads

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 After a few days of fever, 14-year-old Ashok Malakar was taken for a dengue test. The result was positive, but, unusually, platelet and white blood corpuscles counts of the boy were within permissible limits.

 Another test, considered to be more reliable, revealed that Ashok was suffering from Japanese encephalitis, not dengue.

 Difficult to believe, but 25 to 30 per cent dengue-positive cases in private clinics and 50 to 60 per cent in government laboratories are turning out to be false. The common factor in all these cases: the tests were done by the IGG (Immuno-globulin) method.

 The success, or the failure, rate of this method is prompting doctors to advise dengue suspects the IGM (Immuno-globulin higher molecule) test.

 Realising the unreliability of the results of the IGG method, the government has asked all pathological laboratories to list only those dengue-positive cases that have been confirmed through the IGM test.

 ?We have asked all laboratories, government and private, to follow the guideline strictly,? said health services director Prabhakar Chatterjee. 

 ?The IGG method carries the risk of cross-reaction, which causes misleading results,? he explained.

 Following the directive, Tribedi and Roy Diagnostic Laboratories, for instance, had reported only 79 positive cases out of a total of 720 between August 25 and September 16. ?We have seen quite a few cases that had tested positive in the IGG test, but negative in the IGM test,? said Subhendu Roy, director of the laboratory. ?So, to be sure whether a patient is suffering from dengue or not, we are conducting both tests.?

 Elaborating on why the IGG test is throwing up wrong results, Jayati Sengupta, coordinator of the paediatric department of AMRI Hospitals, said the Immuno-globulin antibody often cross-reacts with other similar viruses and produces a ?false positive? result.

 However, there has been the odd occasion of an IGM test, after 15-20 days of fever, producing a negative result, but the patient continues to show all symptoms of dengue. 

 ?We have seen the peculiar trend, where clinical symptoms of dengue are there, the IGM antibody count goes down but the IGG shoots up. This can only happen if the person has been down with fever for more than two weeks. So ideally, both tests must be performed for a conclusive result,? added paediatrician Sengupta.

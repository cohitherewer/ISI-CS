Aparesh Bhattacharya: Opening ticket-booking counters on the terminal platforms of railway stations will help the passengers a great deal. Are the railway authorities thinking about it?

 We have already started setting up ticket-booking counters on the platforms bordering the railway stations, so that passengers entering a station from either side can buy tickets easily. We will shortly inaugurate one such counter at Palta station, near Barrackpore. Moreover, to avoid the piling up of traffic at closed level crossings, we are constructing road overbridges. Several of them have already been built, while a few more are coming up. We have modified the passenger overbridges at Bidhannagar station so that passengers can reach the desired platforms without having to tread over the railway tracks.

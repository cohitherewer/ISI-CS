The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Energy, coal from waste 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A new technique of waste management will be implemented in Salt Lake and New Town, Rajarhat, whereby thermal energy and coal will be produced from bio-degradable garbage.

 The technique has been successfully experimented recently by the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA). 

 It was conducted at Mollar Bheri, the garbage dump of Salt Lake. Of the 40 tonnes of garbage dumped there daily, 15 tonnes are bio-degradable.

 Elaborating on the technique, an official said thermal energy is produced after partially combusting raw waste in a reactor. The partially-burnt garbage is converted into coal.

 ?The experiment was successful and we are planning to generate thermal power from garbage on a large scale,? WBREDA director S.P. Gan Chowdhury said on Monday.

 In Salt Lake, the project will be implemented jointly by WBREDA and Bidhannagar Municipality. 

 ?Initially, we will produce around 100 kg of coal every day. Our target is to generate two tonnes daily,? Gan Chowdhury told Metro. 

 Officials are finalising talks with an entrepreneur to market the technique.

 ?Talks are on about the financial details,? an official said. Representatives from a number of industries had witnessed the experiment. 

 ?We are very happy about the way things are moving. Soon, the garbage disposal problem of the township will be solved and as an additional benefit, power will be generated,? said Dilip Gupta, chairman of the Salt Lake municipality.

 Plans are also afoot to implement the project in New Town. Hidco, the implementing agency of the township, has earmarked a 75-hectare plot for garbage disposal. 

 An estimated 300 tonnes of garbage will be disposed of daily, of which at least 100 tonnes will be bio-degradable. ?We can produce 15 tonnes of coal every day in New Town,? Gan Chowdhury pointed out. 

 WBREDA is also working on a project to produce electricity from methane produced in garbage. ?That will be our next experiment,? the director said.

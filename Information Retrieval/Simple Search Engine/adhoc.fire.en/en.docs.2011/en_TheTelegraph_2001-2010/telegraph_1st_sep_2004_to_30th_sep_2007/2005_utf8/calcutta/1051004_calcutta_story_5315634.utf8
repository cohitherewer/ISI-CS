 A stamp of support on the biggest festival in eastern India. That is what India Post is planning for Puja 2005. And the kudos go to Labony Estate in Salt Lake.

 In what is the 150th year of postal services in India, the puja of 700 families has hit upon the theme of the evolution of communication system in India, tracing the journey of the letter on 16 panels inside the pandal, from messages written in ink on the shaved scalps of slaves via runners and shipmail to email. 

 Enthused at the effort, the postal department is extending its arm of support. For the first in the history of Durga Puja, a special cover is being considered for the occasion. ?We do not usually associate with such events. But since the puja at Labony itself is a salute to the postal system, we have heeded their appeal for a cancellation,? says chief post-master general P.K. Chatterjee. A design for a postmark featuring the Devi has been submitted for approval.

 A stall will also be put up by the philatelic bureau of India Post where commemorative stamps will be sold and various postal services like savings schemes popularised. An audio-visual presentation is being prepared with the narrative in Bengali. ?There are lots of untold stories about the post office. For instance, our dak palki facility could be availed of from the General Post Office in Calcutta to send people to specific places in a palanquin for a charge like letters. Pandal-hoppers will find such stories interesting,? says Chatterjee, who took a tour of the pandal on Saturday. So far, the biggest involvement by the postal department has been bringing out a couple of postal greetings cards some years ago on Vijaya Dashami.

 The puja committee itself is bringing out a picture postcard, featuring the five best images and the best pandal in the 30 years of the Labony puja, says Anupam Sengupta, a member. Lots of souvenirs, therefore, to take home from a pandal-hopping trip.

 The pandal will resemble the post office in the palace of the Maharaja of Cooch Behar. A lifesize model of a runner will greet visitors, as will pigeons, another faithful post-bearer. The idol will be in daaker saaj, a vital link of Durga puja to the postal system, as the foil used for the decoration used to come from Germany by post, giving birth to the name.

 Kalyan Negal, a philatelist whose help the committee has solicited, is putting together an exhibition of stamps. ?Photocopies of significant stamps on 16 topics will be on view at the pandal. Trivia, like C.V. Raman?s tenure as a post office savings bank employee in Calcutta, will be highlighted. An exhibition on actual stamps is also being put up,? Negal says.

 Realities of life

 An extraordinary ability to discover beauty and harmony in scenes from everyday life marks Samir Sarkar as a painter with true poetic vision. Hosted by names-AN.art, the ongoing exhibition of his recent paintings provides an insight into the subtle sensibilities of this immensely gifted artist. His deeply introspective portrayals of the realities of life as borne out in the daily experiences of ordinary people articulates his sensitive understanding of their joys and sorrows, hopes and fears. The figurative human forms, which dominate his works, embody the power, energy and passion that he believes they are vested with. Painted in acrylic on canvas, the works on show are built on themes like unity, relationships and festivities that form the essence of his paintings. Characterised by dark, earthy hues, Sarkar?s imagery, though sometimes mysterious and obscure, lends his compositions a grace and charm, often emphasizing their underlying meaning.

 We Ask You Answer

 Theme for a populist scheme

 Today?s question: Are we reducing Durga puja to mere gimmickry with unconventional idols and themes? More letters will be published next week

rAtan kumar halder,

 Behala

 It would not be an exaggeration to say that the theme pujas have brought joy to a festival mired in tedious tradition. Apart from attracting more people to the pandals, the themes reflect our moral and social values.

p. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur Avenue

 There isn?t an iota of doubt that we have deviated far from the religious representation of the goddess. Puja, nowadays, is more of an artistic event. The people who design and erect pandals are amateurs and hence, fail to impress devotees.

Mahasweta saha, 

 Garia

 I strongly feel that we are reducing Durga puja to mere gimmickry in the bid to make the idols and pandals extraordinary. Almost every puja committee believes that it has to try something novel to attract the crowd and win a prize. The feelings and emotions attached with the Puja, even till a few years back, have disappeared. The pandal-hoppers, too, only want to visit award-winning pujas.

Sourish misra,

 Salt Lake 

 Currently, puja organisers are only interested in using the Puja to show off their financial clout. They attach more importance to pandal decoration than to creating an auspicious ambience. However, I feel that this craze of holding theme pujas will not last long.

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 The economic and social changes have somewhat altered the way we observe religious occasions. The traditional way of celebrating Puja has evolved through the years. The majority of people like the experimentation surrounding Durga puja. Theme pujas are not only helping several artisans earn a living, but are also making the vernal event more aesthetically appealing.

sunil banerjee,

 VIP Road

 There is no denying the fact that we are reducing Durga puja to gimmickry. It is disheartening to see that the traditional idols are giving way to themes and idols of questionable taste. Given the state of things, it seems the only purpose of the pujas is to attract crowds and win awards.

prasit sen,

 Hatiara

 Durga puja has turned into gimmickry because of the rat race among organisers. Their aim is to attract more people with innovative ideas and unconventional d?cor, but in the process they reduce the Puja to an ordinary competition.

R.m. paulmazumdar, 

 shyamnagar

 Change is life itself. What we are considering as traditional has been changing continuously for decades. We should never turn our back on variety.

sukumar ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 We have to find a way to preserve the age-old traditions surrounding Durga puja and observe them with the right attitude. At the moment, lakhs of rupees are wasted on fruitless competitions.

santosh chakrabarty,

 Unique Park

 It is quite pessimistic to assume that creative experimentation can result merely in gimmickry. Durga puja idols and pandals have evolved considerably over the years. A few of them have even been preserved in museums, hotels and galleries. Thanks to ever-changing themes, the pujas are no longer monotonous. 

Naren sen,

 Ramrajatala

 We should not forget that Durga puja is a religious event, even if people from all walks of life are attracted to it due to the festive mood. To draw the masses to pandals, the organisers are currently making a mockery of the Puja..

Sachindra nath Mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane

 It is a crime to spend lakhs of rupees on unconventional idols and themes when there are people in the country who cannot afford to eat two square meals a day.

Chandan ray,

 Sakuntala Park

 It is presumptuous to conclude that unconventional idols and pandals are reducing Durga puja to mere gimmickry. Innovative ideas must be appreciated. They can coexist with traditional concepts.

Susanta kumar bedajna,

 K.B. Sarani

 Devotion is the basis of any puja. However, unconventional idols and pandals do not evoke devotion in the minds of pandal-hoppers and hence, have no place in the Puja. 

Dhananjoy Ghosh,

 Baruipur 

 The Puja is not just a religious festival, but a cultural event as well. Modifications in the idols, grandeur of decoration and innovative themes have made the event more lively. It must also be kept in mind that a large number of people depend on theme pujas for a substantial part of their annual income. From this perspective, Puja is certainly more than mere gimmickry.

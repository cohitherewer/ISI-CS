The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Medicine, the missing link

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 For more then a month, Bela Bose, the principal suspect in the murder of five-year-old Rick Nath, was off medicines for two mental disorders. That, say psychiatrists, could have ?severe adverse effects?, even prompting her to commit suicide or murder.

 With Bela being burnt to death by an enraged mob, no clear motive has emerged for the cold-blooded killing of Rick, early on Friday, in Behala. Her husband Rabindra Nath Bose and son Kaushik have been arrested. Though police believe Bela committed the murder, she was assisted by either her husband or her son or both.

 On September 29, Rabindra Nath had escorted Bela to the Behala chamber of psychiatrist Akhilesh Pal. ?She was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and delusion, both dangerous and capable of driving a person crazy at any point if he or she is off medication for some time. I had advised her medicines for three weeks, but she did not turn up again,? Pal told Metro. Psychiatrists blame the common phenomenon of ?going off medicines? for 90 per cent cases of suicide and killings involving psychiatric patients.

 For such a critical case, Pal had advised selective serotonin uptake inhibitory (anti obsessive) to help Bela gain some control over her OCD.

 ?Such patients develop a compulsive behaviour to do things which he/she would not do otherwise. These unwanted thoughts can even hover around thoughts of killing someone,? explained psychiatrist Prabir Pal. ?If they are off medicines, their condition goes from bad to worse.?

 Added to that was Bela?s state of delusion, a condition that made her suspicious of everything around her. ?Such a patient would believe that somebody was actually out to harm her and could do anything to such a perceived enemy... A person like Bela without medication could be a serious threat to herself and people around her,? explained Akhilesh Pal, who had put her on neuroleptic (anti psychotic) drugs and also begun to counsel her.

 ?When I asked after her, her relatives said she was doing fine,? he added.

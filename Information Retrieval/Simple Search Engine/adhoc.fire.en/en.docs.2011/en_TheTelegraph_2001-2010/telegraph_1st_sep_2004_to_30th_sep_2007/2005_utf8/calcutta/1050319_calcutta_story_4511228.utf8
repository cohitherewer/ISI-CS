 Teacher in torture bar flout

 - Apex court violation cited as doctors debate child injury 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was one doctor?s word against anothers in the Varnika Gupta torture case on Friday. But at the end of the day, one thing was clear: Ruma Pal, nursery teacher of Our Lady Queen of the Missions School in Salt Lake, had violated a Supreme Court directive ? teachers cannot inflict corporal punishment on students.

 Pal may or may not have pulled out a tuft of hair from her five-year-old student?s head, but by the admission of her brother Ashish Ghosh, she had wrung the girl?s ear for not bringing a plastic bag to carry her art work from home.

 Secretary of the Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools D.K. Bhattacharya, who visited the school during the day, said: ?Missionary schools are against corporal punishment and teachers are instructed that if they cannot tackle a situation in class, they must inform the principal.?

 However, he added that he had spoken to parents of other students in Varnika?s class, who said their children had made no mention of a classmate being tortured.

 Later on Friday, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Parveen Kumar said a second medical examination on Varnika, conducted by doctors at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, revealed no injury marks, and suggested that the hair loss could have been caused by a skin disease. ?Medically, the charges against the teacher have not yet been substantiated,? Kumar said. 

 A preliminary report, submitted by Bidhannagar Sub-Divisional Hospital on Thursday, had also suggested this. 

 But the claim has been strongly contested by the Gupta family physician, P.P. Gupta, who was the first to examine Varnika when she returned from school on Wednesday. ?There were blood stains on her scalp when she was brought to me on Wednesday, after her teacher had pulled her hair out,? he reaffirmed. ?How did she sustain this injury if it was not inflicted on her??

 Gupta said he had treated Varnika since her infancy and he had never detected any skin disease on her. ?To suggest that her hair had fallen off due to a skin disease is absurd,? Gupta said. ?On Thursday, her condition had greatly improved by the time she was examined by government doctors. It is possible that her hair was weak and came off easily.?

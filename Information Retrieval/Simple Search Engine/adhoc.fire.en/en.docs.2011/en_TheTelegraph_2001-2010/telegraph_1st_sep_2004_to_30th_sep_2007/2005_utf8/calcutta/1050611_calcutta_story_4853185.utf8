 Pride led to baron downfall

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, owner of the Haldiram?s chain of confectioneries, told police on Friday that he was repeatedly urged by a few close relatives to let Satyanarayan Thakur be.

 Thakur ran a tea stall on the ground floor of a property that Agarwal was developing on Jagmohan Mullick Lane.

 The entrepreneur confessed that he was so concerned with the fa?ade of the building that he could not accept the presence of a tea stall close to it. And it was out of desperation that he had engaged Gopal Tiwari to ensure that Thakur was evicted.

 Agarwal reportedly had plans to set up a sprawling outlet, along the lines of the one he owns on VIP Road, on the ground floor of the Jagmohan Mullick Lane building. 

 ?Agarwal?s pride led to his downfall. He could not digest the fact that a humble tea stall-owner would not move out, even against the payment of a hefty amount,? said city detective chief Gyanwant Singh. 

 Thakur, in his statement to police, had said that he had refused to budge even after being offered Rs 4 lakh by Agarwal. 

 ?Thakur told us that his was one of the most popular tea stalls in the area and three families were dependent on it. If he accepted Agarwal?s offer, he would have had to totally depend on the money. He was not willing to do that,? said a senior officer of the detective department.

 Thakur reportedly doubted that he would be able to set up such a successful business elsewhere.

 In another development, the sleuths have ruled out Agarwal?s involvement in cricket betting.

23 plays in 22nd year

Stage On amp; Off

 The ?To Do? wall chart at the Shyambazar office announces the arrival of the Nandikar National Theatre Festival. So, it?s rush hour for Rudraprasad Sengupta.

 ?The festival has aged and now has many children and grandchildren. We are the oft-acknowledged pioneers, the catalyst of all later festivals from Prithvi to Ganakrishti. In fact, I think it?s time we did something different, maybe next year we will think of another pioneering effort? Maybe a theatre festival for women or children,? muses the veteran actor-director.

 But for now, all theatre-going eyes are on the 22nd edition of the Nandikar festival, with 23 performances in 10 days, all at the Academy of Fine Arts. There?s play, puppetry, music and dance, with teams from Bangladesh, Germany and Sweden, starting December 16.

 Marten Hedman?s Teater of Stockholm will present the puppet show The Cat?s Journey. Flying Fish of Berlin will stage Oscar Wilde?s The Nightingale and the Rose. ?These are all old friends; we have met at various festivals abroad and done workshops together,? says Sengupta.

 The focus this year seems to have shifted from the Calcutta groups to the young and upcoming troupes from all over the country.

 There?s Rangayan from Mysore which will stage Apsare, Dhaka Theatre from Dhaka with Binodini, Panthoibi Natya Mandir?s (Imphal) Hanglai and Natrang?s (Jammu) Dogri play Ghumayee. Calcutta?s Drishyapat will perform Babli.

 ?We had started the festival in 1984 to celebrate our birthday and then decided to make it a meeting point for all kinds of quality theatre. Shreeram Lagoo had called ours the ?festival of fraternity?. We provide a small umbrella under which theatre people can come together and compare notes. It?s also an invitation to all cultural people to bridge the multiple divides of our society,? feels Sengupta.

 The emphasis this time is also on children?s plays ? Rangakishora from Mysore will present Poli Kitti (Kannada), Calcutta?s Swapnasandhani will perform Bhalo Rakshasher Galpo and Awishkar from Mumbai will put up Jungle Me Mangal (based on Shakespeare?s A Midsummer Night?s Dream). That apart, there?s Nandikar?s own Bappaditya and Barda.

 ?Children everywhere belong to the deprived classes. They are captive audiences of everything from MTV to blaring microphones. We have conducted surveys on the exact socio-cultural profile of five districts, and we hold workshops and conduct small festivals throughout the year for the very young,? stresses Sengupta.

 The festival will present an exhibition on some of the survey findings and a display on Indian Theatre Greats. 

 A seminar on Children?s Theatre: Elder?s Responsibility and the publication of Theatre Writings are also on the cards.

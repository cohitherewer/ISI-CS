 Erasing barriers between the arts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A drawing by Pradosh Dasgupta 

 About a month ago, an exhibition was held at Bangiya Sahitya Parishat, where the paintings of Bishnu De were displayed. The poet wanted to express with colours what he could not with words. 

 The exhibition gave an insight into the workings of the poet?s mind and how experimenting in both media gave him a sense of freedom.

 Now, we have a volume on the poetry of painters edited by Debashis Chanda, entitled Chhabi Ankiyeder Kabita, which was released on Friday. This throws light on the minds of artists who are better known for handling paint and brush. It is a slim hardcover and features 24 painter poets, including two women ? Mithu Sen and Eleena Banik ? and four ? Nandalal Bose, Hemendranath Mazumdar, Pradosh Dasgupta and Nikhil Biswas ? who died many years ago. 

 The editor apparently knows more painter poets but, naturally, could not accommodate all of them. The foreword is by Sankha Ghosh, who dwells on creative people for whom no barriers existed between the arts.

 All the painters have contributed their poems, which are accompanied by their sketches. There is a good mix of young and senior artists, although all the contributions are certainly not of the same standard. The Nikhil Biswas sketches are already rarities. The Hemen Mazumdar paintings, however, look banal in black and white. Nothing wrong with black and white, but bathing beauties have become dated. There are some fine drawings by Rabin Mandal and Jogen Chowdhury.

 Ganesh Haloi says it all in his lines on the six aspects of art and the haiku-like dekha, where in exactly four lines he manages to explain his inner vision with enviable clarity. The accompanying sketches are superb. The translations are, however, flawed and needed rigid monitoring.

 However, it is a brave effort by the editor and publisher, Niyogi Offset Pvt Ltd, and should be appreciated as such.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

After the success of Bombaiyer Bombete, SANDIP RAY is 

neck-deep in the post-production of Nishijapon. The director talks to Reshmi 

Sengupta about his dream project, eyeing a Poila Baisakh release

 Rituparna Sengupta, Parambrata Chatterjee, 

Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Sandip Ray and Soumitra Chatterjee at the script-reading 

session of Nishijapon

 Nishijapon is based on a Narayan Gangopadhyay 

story that blends emotions with elements of thrill. What does your film focus 

on?

This is a story of six people stranded in a cottage 

atop a hill. In the beginning, the house hums with activity, as the family is 

very warm and affectionate. There?s the owner Soumitra Chatterjee, a retired widower, 

his elder son Sabyasachi (Chakraborty), younger son Parambrata (Chatterjee), Sabyasachi?s 

wife Rituparna (Sengupta) and her sister Raima (Sen). That apart, there?s Dipankar 

De, a tea planter who comes to visit them.

One day the hanging bridge that connects the house 

with the outer world collapses in a landslide. There?s no power, no water, no 

food and the close-knit family starts to disintegrate in anguish. The film is 

about human relationships and the shape they assume in certain trying situations.

 Finding such a location must have been really 

difficult?

We had a very hurried pre-production schedule. In 

the little time we had, we scoured North Bengal and finally settled on an old 

British cottage in Kalimpong. The hanging bridge had to be built. We also had 

to keep in mind the fact that we had a huge unit that needed accommodation. Then, 

the heavy equipment had to be dragged up. The temperatures were freezing, but 

shooting was over in 26 days flat. Thereafter, we shot in Rangpo, near the Sikkim 

border. 

 How did you decide on this story?

We used to hear a lot of radio plays when we lived 

in our Lake Temple Road house. That was when I got to listen to a play called 

Dhwash. Later, I found out it was based on one of Narayan Gangopadhyay?s 

stories, Nishijapon. I read it and found it very filmable. I was very keen 

on working on it and so bought the rights to the story around 1994-95. I also 

wrote a rough draft but nobody was interested in producing the film. Then, at 

the premiere of Bombaiyer Bombete, I met R.D. Bansal after a long 

time. The Bansals had produced five of Baba?s (Satyajit Ray) films ? Mahanagar, 

Charulata, Nayak, Kapurush Mahapurush and Joy Baba Felunath 

? and were keen on returning to film production. They liked the script of Nishijapon. 

It?s a dream project. 

 The story carries a strong whiff of the Sixties. 

Have you recaptured that era?

No, the period is present day. So, the body language 

and the attitudes of the characters have changed. There were lots of Tagore songs 

in the story. But today?s generation doesn?t break into a Rabindrasangeet every 

now and then. So I have retained only a couple of songs. My main problem was with 

the mobile phones as that might have helped them resolve the crisis, in a way. 

But luckily, you don?t get network in the hilly areas and I have kept it that 

way.

 A moment from Nishijapon

 There is a dream sequence on cannibalism in Gangopadhyay?s 

tale. How did you treat that?

I didn?t bring in the aspect of cannibalism because 

it?s not a disaster film. I wanted to keep it at an intimate level and explore 

what happens to relationships under duress. 

Also, I didn?t want the film to look morbid. And though 

the characters are stranded, relief is reaching them in two-and-a-half days. So, 

the transition period is not that huge. But since they are all affluent people, 

they reveal different shades to their characters when the creature comforts are 

slowly being denied. It?s mostly indoor drama, so I have tried to keep a lot of 

mobility in the span of an hour and 45 minutes.

 How did the cast come about?

Many people asked me why I was repeating my cast in 

Bombaiyer Bombete. But then, why not? Of the rest, Rituparna is a tried-and-tested 

actress of both masala and parallel films. I was a bit apprehensive about 

Raima but she has given a superb performance. People had warned me against her 

Bengali accent, but she was just fine and is dubbing for herself.

 What is your method of work once you have got 

the script ready?

First, there?s a general session where I read out 

the script to all. This I do with some amount of acting. Then I ask the actors 

to think on those lines and come up with their own inputs, if they have any. On 

location, I let them do their thing and intervene when necessary. My method of 

working is like Baba and there?s no waste of time while shooting. My cast knew 

it was a film where they could act and they went all out.

 Varsity eyes course code changeover

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta University (CU) is contemplating the introduction of undergraduate courses directly under it, shifting from a 149-year-old practice of conducting them only through its affiliated colleges.

 The move, according to officials, was prompted by the state government?s recent decision to grant autonomous status to the undergraduate colleges. Once that materialises, the affiliated colleges will be at liberty to run both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The institutions will also enjoy more academic and financial independence.

 CU fears it may then find it difficult to draw high-performing and meritorious graduates to its MA, M.Sc and M.Com courses. The students will continue with the postgraduate courses in the colleges itself.

 ?We will face competition from the undergraduate colleges, particularly in terms of attracting talented students,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), CU.

 Under the existing system, less than a dozen of 200-odd colleges under CU run MA and M.Sc courses. This ensures that meritorious graduates from various colleges queue up to secure a berth in the university?s postgraduate courses.

 However, pro vice-chancellor Das revealed that the proposal for conducting the undergraduate courses directly under CU was at a nascent stage. Discussions at various levels were required before finalising the matter, he pointed out. 

 The University Grants Commission had earlier written to the state government asking it to initiate the process of conferring autonomous status to the colleges.

 CU?s present ?affiliating model? of imparting undergraduate education through colleges was adopted in 1857, in conformity with the system then being practised by London University.

 ?It is strange that we (CU) are still following the model that London University had discarded more than a century ago,? said Shyamapada Pal, member of the CU syndicate and the West Bengal Higher Education Council.

 ?Jadavpur University is an example of how undergraduate courses directly under the varsity can lead to academic excellence at all levels ? graduation, postgraduation and doctoral (research),? an official in the education department said.

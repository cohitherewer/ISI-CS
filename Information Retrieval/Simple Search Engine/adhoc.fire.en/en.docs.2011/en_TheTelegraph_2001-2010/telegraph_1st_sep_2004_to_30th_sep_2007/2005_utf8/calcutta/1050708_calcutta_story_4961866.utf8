 Tax slap on water declared 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Thursday made it clear that a tax would shortly be imposed on the supply of drinking water.

 ?We can no longer supply water to the people free. The operational costs are increasing every day and it has become impossible for us to carry on like this,? urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya declared in the Assembly during the day.

 The previous municipal board, formed by the Trinamul Congress, was against the imposition of water tax. The CPM councillors, however, supported the government move, saying the common people were for the tax.

 ?We will not impose the tax in slums or in places where the residents cannot afford it. But those who can afford to, must start paying a small amount as water tax,? minister Bhattacharya asserted.

 The government spends about Rs 144 crore to maintain the booster and pumping stations, water treatment plants and the pipelines. Only Rs 49 crore is recovered as revenue. 

 ?We have given the matter a long, hard thought and decided that we need to realise at least the cost of water supply,? said Bhattacharya.

 The public health engineering department is currently working out a water tax model for people staying in the non-CMDA areas.

 Over the past few years, the state has been under pressure from foreign funding agencies and the World Bank to recover by way of tax the costs of the water supply projects being pursued on loans.

 According to a senior officer of the ministry, an attempt to recover the project costs will hike up the tax rates.

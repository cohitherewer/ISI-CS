The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Sporting style

Whether you sweat it out for hours or take 

a light walk in the park to stay in shape, the right attire can go a long way 

to inspire your fitness regimen, says Himika Chaudhuri

High-stress lifestyles have today made fitness regimens 

quite mandatory. A jog in the park early in the morning, a game of golf or sweating 

it out at the neighbourhood gym after a hard day?s work are becoming as important 

for the high-flying executive as the middle-aged homemaker suffering from joint 

pains or bouts of gout. 

Even as you decide to take that final plunge into 

the work-out zone, sacrificing your morning sleep or giving your favourite daily 

soap a miss, it?s essential that you feel the urge to head for the gym, the park 

or the tennis court. 

An easy way to inspire yourself is by decking up for 

the occasion. Here is a quick jog through what you ought to pick up on your way 

to getting Anna Kournikova?s curves. 

Gym gear

Very few women striving to reduce weight or stay in 

shape can give the gym a miss. And that?s why gym wear is the most popular gear 

when it comes to sports wear. Be it the 18-year-old college kid or her mom, picking 

up a pair of track bottoms is a must when packing the gym bag. Available as full 

length or three-quarters, these pieces come mostly in dark colours like black 

and grey, making maintenance quite easy.

These can be paired with either a sports bra or a 

body-hugging cut-sleeve T-shirt, which comes with a sports bra. But in case going 

to the gym like the Bollywood babes is not your personal style, a plain branded 

T-shirt is a more sober option. For the funky dresser, off-shoulder tops in soft 

colours are also on sale. 

A head-band to hold back your hair, wrist bands to 

add a dash of style and a pair of comfortable shoes should do the trick for starters.

Both the track bottoms and the uppers are available 

in sizes ranging from small to XL. The track pants are largely in demand even 

for non-sports casual wear and are the largest selling items from all branded 

sports wear outlets.

Keeping the soaring summer temperatures in mind, most 

of the branded pieces come with the dri-fit technology, which helps to keep the 

body dry. 

?The options are plain cotton or a mixed fabric that 

is usually dri-fit,? says Abu Bakar Khan of the Nike showroom in Forum. 

 Available at: all Nike, Adidas and Planet 

Sports outlets. Planet Sports is a multi-brand outlet and stocks Reebok and Puma 

besides Adidas and Nike. Forum is a one stop shop for all these branded outlets.

 Price points: track bottoms Rs 700 onwards 

and uppers Rs 399 onwards.

Run rage

Those who would shun the treadmill and opt for a jog 

to keep fit, can put the tracks back into the wardrobe and take a pair of shorts 

out instead. Team it with a T-shirt and you can take to the greens for a jog in 

the morning or evening. 

?In India, people don?t buy outfits for running separately. 

Most of them make do with track bottoms and a pair of T-shirt,? says Bidesh Chakrabarty 

of Planet Sports in Forum. However, if you are into serious running, you ought 

to get a sipper to carry water along with you. 

 Available at: Nike outlet at Forum. 

 Price points: shorts Rs 600 onwards and sipper 

Rs 800.

Court chic

After Sania Mirza?s recent achievements, one wouldn?t 

be surprised to see some young people taking an active interest in tennis. Unlike 

running, where you can make do with track pants or boxer shorts in various hues, 

on the tennis court the dress code is almost universal ? a white skirt or a pair 

of white shorts. 

The sports wear outlets are all for the white minis, 

which when worn with bright uppers help make a subtle style statement. The skirts 

come in pure cotton or a blend of cotton and synthetic. These can be teamed with 

sports bra, collared T-shirts or plain sleeveless, round-neck body fits.

 Available at: Nike, Planet Fashion at Forum.

 Price points: Rs 599 onwards.

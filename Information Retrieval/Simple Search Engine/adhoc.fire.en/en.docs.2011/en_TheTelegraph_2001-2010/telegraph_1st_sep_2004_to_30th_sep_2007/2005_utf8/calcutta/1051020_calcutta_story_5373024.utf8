 The Kerala Ayurveda special packages provide remedies for sinusitis, migraine, arthritis, stress and more. Some of the treatments are Abhyangam, Shirodhara and Panchkama. Then there are facilities for spa, sauna, steam and jacuzzi.

 One can indulge in the Aroma Therapy and Mud Therapy. Also on offer are Bridal and Pre-bridal packages, colouring, hair care and facials.

 Party proper

 The sudden heavy downpour caught Calcutta unawares on Tuesday evening, with chaos ruling the streets. But it was all calm at The Pala, ITC Sonar Bangla, playing host to the cocktails and dinner party thrown by Vishwambar Saran, honorary-consul for the Republic of Bulgaria, to greet Dragovest Goranov, ambassador of the Republic of Bulgaria to India.

 The party that started at eight in the evening was indeed one of those to be seen at. The guest list included American consul-general Henry V. Jardine, German consul-general Gunter Wehrmann, Italian consul-general Agostino Pinna and honorary consul of Canada in Calcutta Sanjiv Goenka, to name a few.

 Ambassador Dragovest Goranov said: It is a great party. I am getting the chance to interact with so many new people out here.

 The party that continued well into the night gave the guests an option to choose from Indian and Chinese cuisines that included a variety of vegetarian and nonvegetarian dishes.

 Ramp cause

The colour palette ranged from shades of sober pastels to splashy reds.

 Winners of various categories like Best Hairdo, Most Toned Body and Best Streaked Hair walked away with prizes and gift hampers from Kaya, Sindhar Institute of Gemology, Addlife, Red Hot Chilli Pepper and Schwarzkopf.

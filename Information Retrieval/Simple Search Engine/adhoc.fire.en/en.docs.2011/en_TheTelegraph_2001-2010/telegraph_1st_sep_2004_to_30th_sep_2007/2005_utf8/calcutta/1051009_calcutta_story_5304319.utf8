 DI-versity, name of the game

 Calcutta?s quiz capital with a distinctive colonial character, a sprightly arena for sports and a vibrant rendezvous for jazz and blues ? DI is all this and more.

 Now, the grand old institution at 42, Jhowtalla Road has laid out a culinary canvas with options aplenty for its members and guests to refuel when hunger strikes. The brand new on-campus food court at DI has been a lip-smacking hit since it first fired its burners two weeks ago.

 With a choice of six restaurants housed next to the perennially popular swimming pool, the Rs 4.5-lakh food station is a precursor to the more elaborate and sumptuous DI-versity complex, which will kick off construction next year and house 14 to 16 food stalls, besides two fine-dining restaurants.

 ?Most of the city clubs have a colonial hangover, which means the members are more often than not used to being served their food and beverage on the table. We want that custom to change and shift the focus to a self-service scenario,? says DI president Derek O?Brien.

 There were 10 aspirants for setting the table at the food court, from which the club management chose the quartet of Prime Eats, Sher-e-Punjab, Flaming Wok by the Starstruck management and Just Desserts (serving vegetarian fare). These are supplemented by two club outlets ? DI-stillery, the outdoor bar, and kID-Spot for soft drinks, ice-cream and chocolates.

 ?We are honoured to be in such a prestigious club as DI. Our efforts will be geared towards constant upgrade of standards to match the aspiration of members,? says Bunty Sethi of Starstruck. 

 Divya Jalan of Just Desserts, who is impressed by the initial response to the food court, is also keen to make the ?new experience? count.

 While each of the outside occupants will have to fork out Rs 30,000 as annual rental and share 25 per cent of revenue with the club, the DI management is responsible for ?quality and hygiene control?, according to Derek.

 Not just the food court, the club president is also buoyant about medium to long-term development projects DI has taken up. 

 The 60,000-sq ft DI-versity complex, to be developed at a cost of Rs 6 crore, will also house banquets, two party rooms, a salon, four suites and eight guestrooms.

 Work on DI-scovery, the 48,000-sq ft sports complex designed by architect Jayprakash Agrawal, is scheduled to commence soon. The Rs 4-crore, fully air-conditioned integrated sports-cum-leisure facility, will include a squash court, an indoor arena with viewers? gallery for cricket, football, basketball, volleyball, badminton, two rooms for cue sports, a card room, health club and spa.

 ?Ours is basically a family club with a long legacy of keen sportspersons. The new complex will just carry forward that thread and give the sports-minded members enough reasons to come to the club and indulge their favourite passion,? says Russi Jeejeebhoy, former national cricketer and senior vice-president of the club.

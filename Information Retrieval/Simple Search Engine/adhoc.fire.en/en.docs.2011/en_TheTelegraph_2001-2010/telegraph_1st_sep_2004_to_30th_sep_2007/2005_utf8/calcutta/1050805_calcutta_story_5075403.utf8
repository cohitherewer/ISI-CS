The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fake note fallout 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A day after Calcutta High Court came down on a nationalised bank for breaking a locker without informing the customer, a division bench of the same court on Thursday expressed surprise over the State Bank of India (SBI) authorities handing over a customer to police for allegedly depositing two fake Rs 500 notes in the bank.

 The division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra granted the bail prayer of Alauddin Sheikh, a deed writer from Salt Lake, who is an SBI customer.

 Sheikh obtained two separate drafts of Rs 26,000 and Rs 2,000 from the bank on July 7 and July 8 by depositing cash. Thereafter, the bank summoned him to charge him with having deposited two fake Rs 500 notes ? one on July 7 and another on July 8. 

 When Alauddin denied the charges, the bank handed him over to police. He has been in jail since.

 The lawyer appearing for the bank told the court that the branch manager had the authority to hand over a customer to police if he either carried or deposited fake notes. 

 Appearing for Alauddin, Asim Roy argued that the bank had no right to accuse a customer of depositing fake notes once he or she left the bank counter. 

 On Wednesday, a high court judge had passed an order asking an Allahabad Bank branch to file an affidavit stating on what ground it had broken a locker.

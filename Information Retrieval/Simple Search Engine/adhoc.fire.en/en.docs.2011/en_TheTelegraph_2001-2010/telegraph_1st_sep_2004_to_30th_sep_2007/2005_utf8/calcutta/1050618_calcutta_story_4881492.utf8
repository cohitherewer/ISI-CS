The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 In Swiss style

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 She may have given up the big screen on becoming Akshay Kumars bahu, but the Twinkle Khanna name ? and face ? still works its charm.

 Except now, when the Barsaat babe is not making candles with mommy Dimple Kapadia, she concentrates her energy on watches, not film tickets. 

 Twinkle, the brand ambassador 

 for Movado in India, was in town on Friday to unveil the 

 Swiss watch companys new look at the two outlets of 

 Prime Watch World in Forum and City Centre. Dolca, Firo, 

 Luno, Strato and Vivo are the names of its new lines.

 The eastern region is in a very interesting stage of consumerism. People have a lot of disposable income and they have inculcated a taste for all the good things in life, said Arun Malhotra, distributor of Movado in India, at the launch.

 Which means the territory is getting more attention than ever before. Calcutta ? which witnessed the Longines Dolce Vita launch barely a fortnight ago ? is the first city where the new collection is being unveiled.

 The new watches have round dials, and come in black, grey and silver. The analogue watches with chronographs all bear the distinctive Movado dot denoting the position of the sun at high noon.

 The high-end timepieces are studded with diamonds and have golden bodies. The low-end variants are fashioned from stainless steel. The brands selling point is its ease of use and simplicity.

 While Movado, which recently finished a years operations in the city, is yet to sell its most expensive, Rs 3-lakh watch here, Malhotra is hopeful of brisk business in the months to come. 

 They have already tasted some success in the first five years. The company opened shop in India in 2000 with just seven outlets, a number that has since shot up to 24.

 The high-end watches are still to move off the racks in town, but people are quite aware of the name at the entry segment, in which we have been doing good business, revealed Malhotra. The price tag starts at Rs 20,000.

 Dainty, girlie watches are not what Twinkle herself would pick. I prefer big, chunky pieces meant for men. It really goes down well with my tomboyish character, smiled the mother of one, looking stunning in a pair of jeans, red top and a suede jacket.

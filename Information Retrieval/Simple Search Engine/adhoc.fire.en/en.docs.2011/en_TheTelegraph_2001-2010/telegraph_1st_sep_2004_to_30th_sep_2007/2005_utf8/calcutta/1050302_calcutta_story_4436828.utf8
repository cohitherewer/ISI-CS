The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Facility collapse at state hospitals 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The city?s hospitals, which the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is planning to turn into ?centres of excellence?, are reeling under an acute infrastructural crisis, with very little being done to get things back on track.

 Medical equipment worth crores of rupees have broken down or need urgent repairs at the hospitals and the authorities do not seem to care.

 If the laparoscopic machine at SSKM Hospital has been inoperative for months, it is the lack of neurological backup equipment that is forcing patients to avoid National Medical College and Hospital.

 At RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, one can undergo an endoscopy, but the colonoscope is not functioning.

 Left with limited options, several hospital superintendents have written to Writers? Buildings for help. 

 The health department has reportedly washed its hands of the matter, citing lack of funds.

 The critical state of affairs in the city hospitals nearly cost 28-year-old Anju Sarkar her life last week, after her condition worsened following two failed surgeries at NRS Medical College and Hospital.

 She was advised immediate admission to an intensive care unit, which NRS does not have. 

 To make matters worse, the dialysis unit at the hospital had also broken down.

 Anju is now fighting for survival at SSKM Hospital, where the situation is not much better. In the nephrology department, only three of the 10 dialysis machines are functioning.

 ?Normally, we have five machines in working order, but two have broken down. We will get them repaired soon,? said SSKM superintendent Santanu Tripathi.

 The few ventilators that the hospital have are at least 15 years old. 

 The laparoscopic machine is not working either, and there is a serious dearth of cardiac monitors.

 At RG Kar hospital, a patient can undergo endoscopy, but not colonoscopy.

 ?We are hopeful that the machines will be repaired. But is anybody bothered?? asked a senior doctor attached to the hospital.

 That is not all, the blood gas analyser and steriliser have broken down, giving the hospital authorities sleepless nights. 

 Two of the four ventilators are also not functioning. 

 ?We are aware of the problems and are in the process of repairing the machines,? said C.R. Maiti, director of medical education.

 The electromyogram and blood gas analyser are the machines out of order at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.

 Krishna couture

He?s set to debut at the Lakm? India Fashion Week later this month and the collection young designer Shantanu Goenka has put together for the occasion promises to be quite a stunner. For one, the unique stylisation of the line draws inspiration from Lord Krishna, which dictates the title, Krishna Couture ? Spirit of the Blue God.

 ?High-end street combined with funky couture?, is how the designer describes his offering for the most prestigious fashion event in the country. ?Lots of ethnic elements are blended with western silhouettes, and there is an abundance of colours, layering and digital prints,? he says.

 Bejewelled mini skirts that look like ?mini lehngas?, ornate tees, printed and shiny stockings, low-cropped trousers, fluid churidars and sheer blouses shape the line. Digital prints of Krishna are found in abundance. ?Accessories play a very important role in the line, which is targeted at the young and the funky,? says Shantanu.

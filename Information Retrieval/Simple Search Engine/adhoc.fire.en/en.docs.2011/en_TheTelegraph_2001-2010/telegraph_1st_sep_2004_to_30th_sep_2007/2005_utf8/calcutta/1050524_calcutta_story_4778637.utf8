?Benaras changed my perspective towards life?

 After his disastrous debut in Inteha and the hit follow-up in Murder, ASHMIT PATEL has returned to the big screen with the ldquo;Meera movie rdquo;, Nazar. He talks to Pratim D. Gupta about the controversial ldquo;peck on the lips rdquo;, shining in a small role in Silsiilay, sharing the frame with Naseeruddin Shah and the status of his relationship with sister Amisha

 It?s been only Meera in the promotions and trailers of Nazar. Are you feeling left out?

 Not at all. I think it?s an excellent idea as long as it works.

 What is your role in the film?

 I play a police officer attached to the crime branch. He has a past that had him taking a break from his work. Then he is given this special assignment to track down the serial killer who hunts down beer bar dancers. It is, in fact, his junior officer whom he had trained, played by Koel Purie, who coaxes him to return to work. Then, of course, I meet Meera during the investigations and there is a romantic angle between us.

 What was it like working with Meera?

 She is a very sweet, emotional girl. She is vastly experienced in Pakistan but not used to work methods in Bollywood. Ours, of course, is a more advanced film technology here. So there were lots of questions and a lot of curiosity from her side and also loads of cultural exchanges.

 Koel comes from a different school of acting altogether?

 Yes, she has a rich theatre background from the British stage. It?s great to be pitched with actors like her. She is a complete sweetheart and Nazar is her first foray into commercial Bollywood cinema. She has done an excellent job.

 After Vikram Bhatt in Inteha and Anurag Basu in Murder, you?ve worked with a woman director for the first time. How was Soni Razdan?

 She has been a great help. She herself is such a fine actor. Perhaps since she is a woman, she is more sensible and emotional than male film-makers. She is so clear about the character graphs, knowing exactly who goes from where to where. She would even act out a shot if I needed help. She had a big hand in bringing out my character to the fore.

 So many things have been written about the kiss. But no one?s heard your version. You are very much one half of the act, so?

 There?s nothing really to say. I feel it?s much ado about nothing. It?s just a peck on the lips ? nothing to create such a big controversy. It has been deleted to protect Meera?s interests. I think the security of Meera and her family is most important here. If the kiss jeopardises that, it?s not worth it.

 What else after Nazar?

 There?s Khalid Mohamed?s Silsiilay, Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana with Rekha and Mahima Chaudhury, Pankaj Parashar?s Benaras with Urmila and Naseeruddin Shah, Sohail Khan?s home production Fight Club, Ramesh Katkar?s Rokra, Hriday Shetty?s Hum Hain Na and Friends Forever by Soumitra Ranade, the guy who made Jajantaram Mamantaram.

 Benaras is unlike anything you have done till now?

 It?s been a spectacular experience. It was a dream film taking me to a place like Benaras, which is now one of my favourite cities in the world. It completely changed my perspective towards life. The film is about cultures and traditions, philosophy and spirituality. Again, it is a commercial film at the end of it all, with Himesh Reshammiya?s music.

 What is your role in the film?

 I play a sangeetkar who is usually found on the steps of temples. He has been brought up by a low-caste sweeper. He goes on to get a job as professor of music in Benaras Hindu University. Then there?s a romantic angle with Urmila, who plays a mahant?s daughter, coming from a very wealthy, royal family.

 And how was Naseeruddin?

 He plays a guruji who imparts gyan to my character. I was in total awe of him during the shooting. Just kept on observing him. That?s it.

 Most of the other films are multistarrers. Why would you do a bit role in a film like Silsiilay?

 Yes, I play a small role in one of the three stories in the film. I play this rich, spoilt brat who lives every day for the day, chases skirts but has no malice. I thought it was a challenge of sorts to essay a character which has that little screen time and yet make my presence felt in those few scenes. Also, I got to work with the unbelievable Santosh Sivan, who?s the cinematographer of the film.

 What is the status of your troubled relationship with your sister Amisha?

 I am hoping that everything will work out and things can get back to normal sooner than later.

 What about all those raunchy pictures published by a Mumbai tabloid claiming it was you?

 The video, pictures ? everything was cooked up. All made up?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stench amp; filth a way of life

 OUR BUREAU

 A distinctive feature in the predominantly colony areas ? spread across wards 91, 93, 95 and 99 ? is the rapid transformation of small houses into multi-storeyed buildings.

 But despite the sharp rise in the population, allege residents, a host of problems related to civic amenities has not been addressed.

 The Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 93, Ratan Dey, cites the renovation of Dhakuria bridge ? by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) at a cost of Rs 32 lakh ? as proof of the area?s development. ?It was a long-standing demand of the residents and we are proud to have completed the project,? said Dey, who is contesting for the second time.

 But the success seems to wear out as one moves on and enters nearby Gobindapur, which is choked with dirty, dingy and unhygienic khatals.

 Dey, however, argued that of the three khatals in the area, he had been able to remove two. ?As councillor, I cannot be held responsible for the problem. It is the duty of the state milk commissioner to evict khatals,? he pointed out. 

 Kuntal De, a local resident, refused to buy the argument. ?Flat-owners have come here expecting a clean neighbourhood. We had requested the councillor a number of times to have the khatals removed, but to no avail,? he rued.

 The prevailing features in the stretch from Kasba to Bagha Jatin are unhygienic surroundings and lack of a proper garbage disposal system. 

 Take for instance the area behind Jadavpur police station ? the air is thick with the stench from an open vat on Raja SC Mullick Road. ?Residents allege that families of police personnel dump garbage in the vat at all times of the day, instead of at stipulated hours,? councillor Dey said.

 Besides, pedestrians always run the risk of slipping into the huge drains along the footpaths adjacent to the thana, as a number of cement slabs have disappeared. 

 The condition of another garbage dump beside Bagha Jatin State General Hospital is even worse. 

 ?Passersby, patients, doctors and employees of the hospital are being forced to put up with the foul smell,? a resident complained.

 Trinamul councillor of ward 99 Nirmal Das, however, claimed that the area was being cleared regularly, ?though the situation over the past few years had been terrible?. He attributed the problem to the large number of inter-state lorries that come to the market daily. ?We are looking for an alternative dumping space for them.?

 A problem afflicting most areas in Kasba is poor conservancy services. Councillor of ward 91, Left Front?s Dipankar De, said at least 10 posts of conservancy workers were vacant. ?I have informed Rajiv Deb about it, but the problem persists. Naturally, conservancy services are crippled.? 

 Not just Kasba, Gobindapur or Bagha Jatin, even the posh Golf Green cannot boast of all necessary attributes of a good neighbourhood.

 Though the ward has been taken care of ? a fresh coat of bitumen on every road after 20 years, deep tubewells, filtered water from Garden Reach ? there are still no underground sewer lines or mastic asphalt-coated roads. 

 Ward 95?s Trinamul councillor Shyamali Bhadra alleged that ?Subratada had deliberately cheated? her ward by not keeping the promise of laying underground sewer lines.

 Queries regarding partitioning 

 of Hard Disk drives (HDD) and installing multiple Operating 

 Systems (OS) keep pouring in. Here?s the lowdown on these 

 essentials that we care little about till a really urgent 

 need to repartition the Hard Disk or to add another OS to 

 the existing one forces us to.

 Partition why

 Hard Disks need to be partitioned 

 and formatted before they are ready to instal the Operating 

 System and other software, and before they can store data. 

 Partitioning is the process of dividing the physical Hard 

 Disk into many (or even one, in case of small disks) virtual 

 drives, so that each partition can be accessed like a separate 

 disk. Partitioning is also important for defining the Hard 

 Disk structure and affects the proper utilisation of drive 

 space.

 Partition how

 Software utilities within the 

 OS itself help the partition process. The Windows 98 or 

 ME boot disk, for instance, contains FDISK.EXE and FORMAT.COM 

 to partition and format. Besides, you can download HDD installation 

 software like Disk Wizard for Seagate drives or Disk Manager 

 for Samsung drives from the manufacturers? website. Third-party 

 software like Partition Magic or Ontrack Disk Manager can 

 also be used.

 Using disk installation floppy 

 is easy, but would require resetting the BIOS to boot the 

 PC from the floppy drive. The alternative is to use CDROM. 

 Windows 2000, Windows XP and most recent versions of Linux 

 allow partitioning and formatting the HDD during the Operating 

 System installation. Set CDROM as the first boot device 

 in BIOS and boot your computer with the OS installation 

 disk. During boot, you will be instructed to partition the 

 unpartitioned Hard Disk and format the partitions with appropriate 

 file-systems.

 Partition how many

 Up to 67 partitions (3 primary 

 and a secondary, containing up to 64 logical partitions 

 inside) can be created. Some OSs have to be installed in 

 the primary partition or it will not boot up. While allocating 

 the size of the partitions, remember that a partition containing 

 the OS and application software will require a lot of free 

 space for Virtual Memory and future addition of application 

 software. Preferably, use other partitions to store data 

 like music, photos and documents.

 Partition Linux

 Linux partitions can be created 

 during the installation process. All Linux distributions 

 need at least a root partition (/) and a swap partition. 

 The swap partition should either be of the same size as 

 your PC?s memory (RAM) or up to twice that size. You can 

 keep adding more partitions (/usr, /boot, /var etc.) as 

 required. Linux will also instal the boot-loader (Lilo or 

 Grub Install). The Linux installation program usually detects 

 Windows and automatically configures the boot loader (Grub 

 or Lilo) to boot either Linux or Windows.

 Dual boot what

 Many users need more than one 

 Operating System on a single PC, with the option of choosing 

 one of them while starting up. This is called dual (or multiple) 

 boot. With the growing popularity of Linux as a desktop 

 Operating System, dual boot has assumed even greater significance. 

 To make a dual or multi-boot system run smoothly, the OSs 

 must be installed in separate partitions. A boot-loader 

 software also needs to be installed for selecting between 

 OSs during booting.

 Dual boot how

 Instal each OS on a separate drive 

 or disk partition. If you are using two or more versions 

 of Windows, follow this order: Windows 98/ME, Windows 2000, 

 Windows XP.

 In case of dual booting Linux 

 with Windows, instal Windows first. Also, create the disk 

 partitions with the Windows partitioning software, otherwise 

 Windows may not recognise the partitions. If you want to 

 share Windows files from Linux, format the Windows partition 

 with FAT32 file system.

 Look-East pushes Buddha to SE Asia 

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee

 With the Manmohan Singh government in Delhi pursuing a Look-East policy to promote India?s trade ties with the southeast and east Asian countries, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has also stepped up its initiatives for better business bonding with the region. 

 The Bengal chief minister, whose last foreign visit in June 2003 to Italy failed to open a floodgate of foreign investment, has decided to visit Singapore and Indonesia between August 22 and 26 to further the cause of business and industry in the state. 

 ?Inviting overseas companies to explore opportunities in Bengal is the main reason behind the chief minister?s visit,? said industries and commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen, who will accompany Bhattacharjee on his trip. 

 Besides meeting government representatives ? including Singapore?s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his colleagues in the health and education ministries and the minister for trade in Indonesia ? Bhattacharjee will meet representatives of chambers of commerce and hold one-to-one meetings with a select set of industrialists. 

 The delegation from Bengal will include representatives from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), ICICI West Bengal Infrastructure (I-WIN) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee, who is helping set up meetings with key government officials and arranging sessions with industry representatives for the visiting delegation, will also be part of the B-team from Bengal. 

 ?We had suggested to the chief minister to explore the possibility of a visit to the region a few months ago. We will extend all our resources to this investment promotion exercise,? said Rajeev Singh, regional director, CII eastern region. 

 Apparently, Bhattacharjee, who became cautious about foreign trips after his much-hyped trip to Italy, has agreed to the proposal after working out the potential benefits of the mission. Recently, companies from both the countries have shown interest in the state and so, Bhattacharjee is convinced that it is the right time to showcase Bengal?s strength in the region. 

 To draw the maximum out of the trip, the government and its partners ? CII, PwC and I-WIN ? are busy preparing for the proposed trip. While highlighting the opportunities in Bengal will be the main agenda, specific focus will be given to health, education, information technology, automobile, tourism and infrastructure. 

 ?Indonesian company Salim Group is setting up a township and a motorcycle-manufacturing company and a host of Singapore-based companies are keen on setting up joint-venture projects here. We want to extend the scope of association with companies in these two countries,? added Sen.

 The stage adaptation of a short story by Oscar Wilde, The Nightingale and the Rose tells a tale about hope, suffering, true love and longing. Performed by Flying Fish Theatre Company (picture above) of Berlin, Germany, as part of Nandikar?s ongoing 22nd National Theatre Festival, the play?s theme is built around the misunderstandings, disappointments and despair that we experience in our elusive search for love. For years, the little nightingale has sung of true love. Then, when she meets love in the form of a young student, she decides to make him happy at all costs. The tragic love story poignantly expresses how animals and plants can truly sense human thoughts and desires. Yet, men fail to understand nature?s ways. Thus, the student does not realise what pains and sacrifices the nightingale endured to bring him the red rose. Direction: Harald Fuhrmann.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Aged, ill to face Lake bulldozers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ten years ago, a 60-something Dukhi Das was nearly run over by a train near the Dhakuria Lakes. The blind woman hadn?t heard the train approaching. 

 She survived, but her leg was amputated. Five years later, her elder sister Gouri Nath was crossing the same stretch, when she slipped and fell, splintering her arm.

 When the eviction drive by the railways and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) begins on Wednesday, the two women will not move away. 

 The Ballygunge-Tollygunge Rail Colony Sangram Committee, which champions the cause of the settlers along the rail tracks, has plans for them.

 ?These women will be our first line of defence. We will line up our old and handicapped people to face the bulldozers. The authorities will have to run them over before they can proceed any further,? said committee member Sukhdev Halder. 

 ?They will die sooner or later, any way,? he reasoned.

 The drive to evict about 25,000 members of 3,800-odd families from the 3.5-km stretch between Dhakuria Bridge and Lake Gardens begins early on Wednesday.

 With the Calcutta High Court order asking Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government to launch the eviction drive from March 2, top state officers met the chief minister on Tuesday morning at Writers? Buildings to work out eviction strategies. 

 Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said the government will carry out the drive because it was a high court order. 

 Asked about the interests of those writing their Madhyamik, he said: ?There?s nothing we can do about it.?

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Ranvir Kumar said about 1,000 personnel from Calcutta Police and another 500 from West Bengal Police will be posted at the Lakes for the drive, which begins at 6 am. 

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said there was no question of being sympathetic towards the shanty-dwellers. 

 ?They are not refugees but squatters,? he asserted. ?It?s not possible for the state government to rehabilitate 20,000 people living there illegally. Some political parties are, however, turning this into a big issue,? Biswas said. 

 The fate of the shanty-dwellers has been hanging in the balance since 1998, when the high court first ordered them to vacate the railway land. 

After the case went to the Supreme Court in 2002, 

a massive eviction drive was undertaken in May that year, but the operation was 

called off in the face of stiff opposition by Mamata Banerjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trendy troika for all-night chill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 This is not the role call for the latest Bollywood blockbuster. Instead, it is the glamorous guest list inspiring Calcuttans to hit the BED from Wednesday night.

 Bars Entertainment Dining (to be known as BED), opposite Max Mueller Bhavan, is the first in a flurry of three night addresses opening in town in the first fortnight of February. 

 The Starstruck Retro Lounge at Forum and Vergose at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) will follow suit to spice up nightlife, now ruled by the Tantras and Shishas.

 The fact that Calcutta has grown up will be fleshed out on Wednesday by the big boys and girls of Bollywood rocking the dance floor, after Mumbai models like Fleur Xavier, Nina Manuel and Gauhar Khan have romped the ramp. 

 The 7 Ballygunge Circular Road premises houses an open-air Indian food and tandoori counter on a 10,000-sq-ft lawn, a Chinese and Thai cuisine restaurant and a nightclub.

 ?The place will have a complete new-age feel with state-of-the-art DJ consoles. The bar will serve some exotic cocktails and premium wines,? says managing director Megha Vohra. An Arabian spread on the rooftop is also on the cards.

 If BED is determined to be in tune with the times, retro is the route at Starstruck, where the lounge will dish out food and music in flashback mode. 

 ?Music will be strictly from the Seventies and Eighties. We will not play Hindi music. There?s no point in playing lounge music when the place is empty and then switching to bhangra and Indipop when the crowd starts swelling,? says Sonali Sethi, managing director, Absolute Restaurants Private Limited, which owns the latest value addition to the Elgin Road hangout.

 Unlike the other stops, this 1,000-sq-ft lounge tucked in between the Starstruck restaurant and Oh! Calcutta will serve complete Chinese and Indian combo meals, apart from appetisers and snacks. 

 ?The meal system is keeping all those in mind who drop in straight after office,? explains Sethi. A day after a star-studded bash on February 5, the lounge will be thrown open from noon till 2 am.

 Giving the night raiders another option close by will be Vergose at HHI. ?In Delhi and Mumbai, nightclubs are out of fashion. People want to hang out where the food is good, the ambience is posh and the music is rocking. Our idea is to give Calcutta an international experience in dining and partying,? says D.K. Jaiswal, managing director, eyeing a February 12 launch.

 With the dining space bang in the middle and five lounging spots spread around, this hotel stop will serve Mexican, Japanese and Italian fare from seven in the evening till two in the morning. There will also be space enough to shake a leg, as the fibre-LED lights change mood and music.

 ?The more competition we have, the merrier it will be for the nightclub industry. The trick is to manage your business smartly, so that you can enjoy a share of the increasing party population,? feels Anirban Shimlai, director, F amp;B, The Park, which houses Someplace Else and Tantra.

 Lines drawn fine

 - Paintings with the quality of sculpture

 A STAFF REPORTER

ARRESTING IMAGES:(From top) Paintings by 

Manoj Roy on display till March 1. Colour Blind. Breath. Senses 

 Manoj Roy is a graphic designer by profession. Trained at the Government College of Art, Roy, born in 1969, is holding his first one-man show at Genesis gallery, on Middleton Street. 

 These paintings are gouache on rice paper and have little to do with the skills that earn him his bread and butter. Like most products of his alma mater, Roy is well trained in his craft. 

 He draws with confidence and he applies colour, too, with the expected degree of professionalism.

 Simple depictions of faces with a ?primitive? look amid a riot of vegetation or that of a woman in a trance are some of his best works. The modelling of the heads has the quality of sculpture. 

 In the work titled Senses, for example, the bald head could have been the creation of a Bengali wood-carver, one of the many who have left behind countless specimens of their excellent workmanship.

 Having said this, and while there can be no doubt about Roy?s technical finesse, the artist seems not to be equally comfortable handling more complex ideas. 

 One of the best paintings in this exhibition is the one of a cat against a backdrop of sea green and a goldfish with blue behind it. As in Roy?s other works, such as the one of the goldfish in a bottle with a boy taking in a lungful of air, and the construction workers wearing hardhats, this painting, too, seems to be marred by a certain degree of literal-mindedness. The images seem to be straightforward translations of the captions into the language of the visual medium, though the images themselves are arresting enough. 

 Roy says: ?Today the world is too much for us. Trees, parakeets, horses? Our inner space has no room for them. It?s filled with thoughts of computers, CDs, cars.? Yet man survives. He transcends history.

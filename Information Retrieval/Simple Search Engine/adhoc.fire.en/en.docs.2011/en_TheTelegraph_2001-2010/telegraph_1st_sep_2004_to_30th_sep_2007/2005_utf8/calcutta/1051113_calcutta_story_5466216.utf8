Angad, Pritha, Azan: kids who care

PET PASSION - NILANJANAA

 A pavement dweller feeds stray dogs in the 

city. A file picture 

I came across Angad Saraf, a Class XII student of 

La Martiniere for Boys, when he adopted two kittens from the adoption section 

in Pet Passion. Just thanking him seemed like a half-hearted effort. I 

decided to delve a little into the mindset of Angad and ?his kind? who take the 

plunge for animals, shouldering their responsibility readily. Those kittens are 

now a year old and besides securing a strong foothold in Angad?s family, they 

even won certificates at Creation, an inter-school fest.

Angad prefers his desi cats to Persian cats 

and is of the firm belief that love for animals should transcend pedigrees and 

physical features. Restricting your affection for the few privileged ones is as 

good as not caring for any of them. Angad believes that if the state of animals 

has to improve in our country, dissemination of information on animals and their 

rights should be made mandatory in schools.

Hear hear: A lot of people buy caged birds 

and set them free. Actually those same birds are caught again and again to be 

set free. So, no birds are free after all.

Pritha Bhowmick, a student of Class XI at Dolna Day 

School, Kasba, is busy these days taking care of 11 puppies that Kala Chand has 

delivered outside Tripti restaurant near Deshapriya Park. But her only worry is 

that, like always, when these puppies begin to venture out, they would be run 

over by speeding cars.

?One should always check under the car for a stray 

animal before starting. Isn?t that the first lesson they teach at driving schools?? 

she asks rather angrily. I agree readily. Pritha has grown up seeing her parents 

feeding stray dogs, nursing their wounds and giving them shelter at their doorstep. 

So, it was only natural for her to follow in their footsteps. Her aim is to build 

a shelter for stray dogs.

Hear hear: If you happen to drive by Tripti?s 

or the Hanuman Mandir next to it, be doubly sure you don?t run over any stray 

dog because Pritha and her friends are watching you!

Finally, the youngest of them all, and shall I say 

the most enthusiastic too? Azan Piperno, a student of Class VII at La Martiniere 

for Boys, loves waking up to the sound of chirping birds, purring cats at his 

feet and the dogs licking him awake. He spends weekends at his grandmother?s house 

that is an abode for cats, dogs, ducks and all sorts of animal-friendly paraphernalia 

in the form of encyclopedias and movies on animals. His love for animals is laced 

with a moderate dose of responsibility that made him rescue a dying pony in Hastings. 

He was appalled that no one stopped to help the injured pony or even call an ambulance. 

Azan wants to stop people from hunting animals for sport, cosmetics or clothing. 

And he is concerned about the depleting population of tigers in our forests.

Hear hear: ?There?s nothing in the world that 

can stop me from loving animals.?

How in the world can I better that statement of Azan? 

For all these kids, I thank their parents and grandparents for fostering animal-friendly 

and sensitive human beings for the future of our country. Cheers!

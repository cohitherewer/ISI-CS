 Clarity of vision beyond sight

 In his centenary year, an attempt will be made to present Benode Behari as a great artist and educator, Gulam Sheikh and Shiv Kumar tell Soumitra Das

 At a time when most artists were quite content to paint or sculpt in the obscurity of their studios, Benode Behari Mukherjee would teach art at Kala Bhavan in the solitude of Santiniketan. When he lost his vision he taught art history there for about 12 years from 1957. Although a great artist and teacher he was hardly a public figure.

 However, after Satyajit Ray made the documentary Inner Eye, Mukherjee suddenly became a household name. That was way back in 1973. Yet, however famous Mukherjee?s work was neglected. As anybody who has visited the Visva-Bharati campus knows, his well-known murals on an epic scale in Kala Bhavan, Hindi Bhavan and China Bhavan are in grave danger of being obliterated.

 In his centenary year, Visva-Bharati has already organised a small exhibition of Benode Behari?s works. Now the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) will hold a bigger exhibition next year befitting an artist and teacher of his stature. The exhibition will open in Delhi in all probability in March next year. After one and a half months there, it is likely to travel to Birla Academy in Calcutta and then NGMA in Mumbai.

 Artist Gulam Sheikh was in Calcutta from Vadodara for three days from Monday evening along with art historian Shiv Kumar from Santiniketan. 

 Both Gulam Sheikh and Shiv Kumar had already worked on the exhibition for about one-and-a-half years before the Centre sanctioned funds recently. They had sought Rs 28 lakh but only Rs 19 lakh has been sanctioned.

 Gulam Sheikh and Shiv Kumar had come to check the works of Benode Behari at the Academy of Fine Arts.

 Gulam Sheikh said in January 2004 he had received an invitation to curate the artist?s centenary retrospective with Shiv Kumar as co-curator, K.G. Subramanyan as consultant along with Nilima Sheikh and Mrinalini Mukherjee, Benode Behari?s daughter who is herself a sculptor and holds the family collection. Sanjay Mallik, an art historian of Santiniketan will document the exhibition.

 Eighty to 85 per cent of the artist?s work in various collections all over the country has already been documented. Along with Mrinalini they have visited Najeebabad in Uttar Pradesh where the late Jitendra Kumar, a close associate of Benode Behari?s, and his wife Nibedita have a collection of his works. They have also been to Banasthali in Rajasthan where Benode Behari had painted a mural. Devaki Nandan Sharma, who died recently, was the man responsible for its execution.

 Gulam Sheikh says he has written to the Centre as well as the NGMA saying the exhibition should not be held in Delhi alone but should travel to Mumbai and Calcutta, and, if funds permit, to Japan as well.

 Benode Behari, says Gulam Sheikh, spent a year in Japan in 1937 and had held an exhibition there in 1938. This was facilitated by Rashbehari Ghosh and the artists Arai Kampo and Taikan. ?It was the first time that any Indian artist had gone to Japan and held an exhibition there as well. The Japanese would be interested in his work because he had drawn inspiration from the Far Eastern tradition and the Japanese were impressed by both his knowledge and awareness of their art.?

 Gulam Sheikh says he would like to show as many of Benode Behari?s works as possible. ?The concept is to hold a holistic show. I want to put it in the context of Bengal and Santiniketan and present him not only as an artist but also as a great educator of the century. His students still swear by him,? he observes.

 Benode Behari was interested in arts and crafts as well. He had organised the museum in Kathmandu. Long before any interest in textiles and handprinting had developed he had held a workshop at Najeebabad along with Jitendra Kumar and Riten Mazumdar.

 Benode Behari was an important literary writer with works like Chitrakar and Chitrakatha as well Adhunik Shilpa Shiksha on contemporary art to his credit. An effort will be made to recreate the ambience of Santiniketan. All the murals will be documented and exhibited digitally in actual scale. For these works of epic dimension he had made many sketches in Varanasi and studies of real-life characters as well. These will be collected and perhaps marketed in digitised form.

 The vast repertoire of his work ? from scrolls, watercolours and oils, to work on textiles and silk and calligraphy ? will be exhibited.

 Funds will be raised to make another film on the master and multiple publications will be launched. There will be a catalogue with contributions by K.G. Subramanyan, Shiv Kumar, Gulam Sheikh and excerpts from Benode Behari?s own writings. K.G. Subramanyan has translated Chitrakar and Shiv Kumar will write book on his murals. Seagull and Vadhera gallery will be involved in the publishing projects.

 Blueprint to bolster Sarobar security

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Following a directive of the high court, the government has finalised an action plan to beef up security around the Dhakuria Lakes, or Rabindra Sarobar, to protect the waterbody from pollution.

 The urban development department has initially allotted Rs 29 lakh for the purpose.

 The plan envisages construction of an 8-ft high boundary wall around the waterbody, installation of lights inside and outside the complex, and erection of iron gates at three level crossings.

 Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), the agency responsible for maintaining the waterbody, has sought reports from Lake-based clubs regarding their solid and liquid waste disposal systems.

 The high court in its judgment on April 11 had directed the government to construct a boundary wall around the Dhakuria Lakes to protect it. 

 The court had also set a four-month deadline for the government to arrange for security to prevent squatters from entering the lake premises. 

 ?We finalised the action plan after discussing it with senior city police officials. Almost all the formalities in implementing the plan have been completed. We expect to start work within a fortnight with a target to complete the work by the August 11 deadline,?? said A.K. Ganai, officer-on-special duty, CIT.

 There is a 6-ft high boundary wall around Rabindra Sarobar, but squatters have demolished portions of it to gain access to the lake for bathing and washing clothes.

 The three level crossings are, however, unmanned. A large number of the 300 lamp posts on the Lakes premises are either broken or defunct.

 CIT officials said that apart from fluorescent tubes, halogen and mercury vapour lamps would be installed inside the Lakes.

 They sought the assistance of the railway authorities as a number of halogen lamps needed to be installed outside the complex, too.

 Security personnel will also be deployed at the entrance and the level crossings. 

 Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said a security team would soon be formed for deployment at the Lakes.

 ?Senior city police officers have visited Rabindra Sarobar a number of times to prepare a blueprint on guarding it. Protecting a 192-acre waterbody is not easy. We are taking steps to ensure proper security in the complex,?? Deb said.

 The home secretary added that the security personnel would be deployed from the time the wall construction starts to avoid any untoward incident.

 According to the court order, Government Railway Police will guard the outside of the Lakes while city police will be responsible for security on the premises.

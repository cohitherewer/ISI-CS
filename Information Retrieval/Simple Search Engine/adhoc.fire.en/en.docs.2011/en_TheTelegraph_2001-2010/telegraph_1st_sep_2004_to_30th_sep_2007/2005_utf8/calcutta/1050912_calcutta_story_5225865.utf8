The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Solicitor office gutted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An early morning fire on Sunday destroyed a portion of the record room of the solicitor firm, Khaitan amp; Company, on the fourth floor of the Old Post Office Street office, adjacent to Calcutta High Court, under Hare Street police station.

 ?Three fire tenders were pressed into service and the flames were doused by 8.45 am, about 45 minutes after the fire had broken out,? a senior fire brigade officer said. On the face of it, the blaze was caused by a short circuit.

 N.G. Khaitan, senior partner of the firm, expressed his surprise to Metro over the phone from New Delhi. ?I don?t know how a short circuit could have started the fire. That office remains closed most of the time. I cannot comment on how the fire started without taking stock of the situation when I return to Calcutta,? Khaitan said.

 He said some documents might have been damaged, but according to information that he had received, most of the documents are safe and intact. 

 A Grade IV employee of the firm, who lives near the office, said the fire destroyed some documents, 10 chairs, two tables and two computers. 

 ?I was at a tea-stall adjacent to the building when I saw smoke billowing out of a window. I ran up and found a portion of the office engulfed in flames,? he said. 

 ?Our partners will hold a special meeting on Monday,? said Utpal Chakraborty, administrative officer of the firm.

 Trade twist in fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The ?biggest racket involving housing loans in recent times?, busted last week, also involved a rip-off on a number of banks and financial institutions. Crores were swindled on the pretext of setting up industrial units that never came up. 

 The proposed units ranged from computer hardware to garments. While the police are not willing to state the amount involved, insiders peg it at Rs 12 crore. The lion?s share was mopped up from financial institutions through cash-credit loans.

 Monoranjan Roy and Kaushik Nath, said to be the brains behind the racket, have been arrested, along with about half-a-dozen others. Sleuths suspect the loans were obtained in connivance with some bank employees. 

 ?Our investigation is at an early stage. We are yet to get to the bottom of the racket. The manner in which the members went about their job is very intriguing ? getting a fake copy of every single document that was required to be submitted,? claimed Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief.

 Roy and Nath, along with a few other racketeers, went about procuring the cash-credit loans by preparing elaborate proposals for financial institutions, taking care of minute details. Each proposal would have full details about the land where the industry was supposed to be set up, the names of those who would be running the show, their academic qualifications, the marketing details and so on. 

 For collateral security, the racketeers showed inspectors from financial institutions large tracts of land, running into acres, across parts of Diamond Harbour, Barasat and even Baruipur.

 ?The members would initially get hold of the mother deed of a plot and then prepare its duplicate. Next, one of them would pose as the original owner of the deed,? said a detective department officer.

 The two kingpins went about forging documents and papers in an intrepid manner. The PAN cards and the trade licences would be duplicated with advanced software at their office, Dawson Goods Private Limited, in Jadavpur.

 ?To get the groundwork done, the duo paid underlings anything between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000,? the detective department officer disclosed.

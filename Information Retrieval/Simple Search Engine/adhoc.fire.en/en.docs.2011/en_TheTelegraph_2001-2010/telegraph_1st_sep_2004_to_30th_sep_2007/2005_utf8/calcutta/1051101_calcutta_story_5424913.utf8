The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Aishwarya Rai 

You are impatient but straightforward, determined but rarely egocentric. You have control, you?re perceptive and with the right attitude, you?ll endure and succeed. You are conservative in relationships. Try to develop better listening skills. Trouble and challenges keep coming your way, but you?re an excellent disaster manager. ? Kusum Bhandari

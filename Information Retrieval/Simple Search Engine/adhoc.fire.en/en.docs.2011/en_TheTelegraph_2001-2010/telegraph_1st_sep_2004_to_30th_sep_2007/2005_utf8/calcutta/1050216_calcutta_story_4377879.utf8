The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Shyamsundar temple at Rashkhola is not cleaned properly. The terrace and 

the stairs leading to it are soiled with pigeon droppings. The alleys around the 

temple, too, are quite filthy. Overzealous repair work has done more harm than 

good to the temple. The Krishnalila panels put up on the walls are quite hideous. 

After repairs and a fresh coat of paint the basic structure of the Rashmancha 

near the river has changed significantly. I wish those who undertook the job had 

taken a little more care to preserve its original design.

 A number of clubs in Nangi, Batanagar and Maheshtala areas organise lottery 

draws during winter months targeting daily-wage earners. For some strange reasons, 

?progressive? youth organisations, which are otherwise very vocal against online 

lotteries, keep mum or even actively participate in these draws. The club members 

hawk the tickets at busy traffic intersections, creating inconvenience to passers-by. 

It is high time that the local police stations put a stop to such dubious money-spinning 

activities.

 The private transporters are increasing fares pleading losses arising out of 

rise in fuel prices. But on the other hand, Calcutta State Transport Corporation 

(CSTC) buses often keep the engine running even when caught in traffic snarls 

or at a signal. The driver is relieved of the bother of restarting the engine 

but this results in a waste of precious fuel and loss of public money. CSTC should 

train its drivers on fuel efficiency.

 Ruffians often gather in front of girls? schools when they give over and create 

much nuisance. They tease the girls and also pass indecent remarks. While the 

educational institutions are trying their best to provide security on their premises, 

the police should also deploy plainclothesmen to nab these unruly youths. 

 B.N. Bose, Dum Dum. 

 About five decades ago, a Prime Minister of India drew flak for referring to 

Calcutta as a city of processions. Still, the phenomenon of processions has been 

continuing to this day, with many children being made to take part in them. Given 

that children have little knowledge of politics and as such rallies and sit-ins 

are very exhausting, the government should ban participation of children in any 

political procession, rally or sit-in.

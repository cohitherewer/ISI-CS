The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pregnant teenager deserted at station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pratima Pandit, 18, spent all of Friday evening at Sealdah station, scared and alone, waiting for her lover to turn up. Local miscreants zeroed in and molested her. Around midnight, a team from Muchipara police station came to her rescue.

 Pratima?s lover, Subarna Kumar Chatterjee, did not turn up, though she is carrying his child. She has now been handed over to city-based NGO Sanlaap by the Muchipara police and will be produced in a local court on Monday.

 Pratima, from West Devipur, in Raidighi, South 24-Parganas, lost both her parents when she was 10. A local priest, Sri Bhairavi, took pity on the girl, by then a homeless destitute, and sent her over to Chatterjee, then in his mid-twenties and living at Uluberia, Howrah, as a domestic help. 

 Three years ago, Chatterjee landed a job with Bharat Petroleum and moved to Katihar, in Bihar. 

 He took Pratima along with him and over the past three years, as the girl blossomed into a woman, he had a physical relationship with her, promising love, marriage and a rosy future.

 By this time, Pratima discovered that she was expecting his baby.

 Five days ago, Chatterjee suddenly decided to visit his house in Uluberia. He left his cell phone with Pratima, so he could keep in touch with her. A couple of days later, he asked her to come over to Sealdah station.

 ?Don?t worry. I will be there to receive you. We will go somewhere else and begin a new life together,? Chatterjee reportedly assured her over the phone.

 On Friday, after duly receiving Pratima at Sealdah, Chatterjee told her that they would have to put up in a hotel, as his house in Uluberia was locked. 

 But the local hotels refused to let out rooms to the couple. After a day-long hunt, Chatterjee took Pratima to Sealdah station and told her to wait for him there, while he went to hunt for accommodation.

 ?He told me he would return in the evening after finding a decent place to put me up. He promised to come back soon. Little did I know that he had something like this in mind,? Pratima sobbed later to the police. 

 Her wait at the station turned into a nightmare, as there was no sign of Chatterjee all evening.

 Around midnight. a few local miscreants tried taking advantage of her. Luckily, policemen from Muchipara thana on a patrol of the station premises noticed her and came to her help.

 They rescued her, but her molesters managed to give them the slip. 

 Pratima is still in a state of shock. She has been handed over to Sanlaap for safe-keeping. She doesn?t know where to go or who to turn to, after she is produced in court on Monday.

 Since Friday afternoon, there has been no news of Chatterjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Emission order set to bite the dust

 JAYANTA BASU 

 Convert or be scrapped had been the constant message from the state government.

 But yet another deadline on commercial vehicles having to adhere to emission standards looks set to go for a toss.

 In May 2005, the transport department had set a December 31 deadline for all commercial vehicles, such as taxis, buses and trucks, over 15 years old plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, to adhere to Bharat Stage III emission norms, or be taken out of service. 

 The rule, announced via a gazette notification, however, applied to all autorickshaws irrespective of age. Autos ? for which the deadline has already been extended once from September 1 ? have to follow Bharat Stage II standards.

 According to transport department sources, the government is planning to push back the deadline to March 31, 2006. Pre-1990 buses are also being given permit renewals beyond December 31, indicating a softening of stand.

 The main reason: the government has suddenly woken up to the fact that around 90,000 vehicles are on the change-or-chop list and conversion has been done by a only minuscule percentage since the deadline was set.

 ?An extension has always been on the cards. The implementation is impractical,? said Anadi Shaw, secretary of Autorickshaw Workers? Union. A mere 1,700 autos, pointed out sources, use LPG as fuel ? to cut pollution ? out of the 50,000-odd plying on city roads.

 Bus and taxi unions, irrespective of party affiliation, blamed the poor infrastructure and lack of funds for the delay.

 ?We have urged the government to extend the deadline. It?s not possible to convert so many vehicles at such short notice,? asserted Madan Mitra of the Progressive Taximen?s Union. 

 Swarnakamal Saha of Bengal Bus Syndicate, who has moved court challenging the notification, is confident the government will relent.

 But the unions must also share the blame, feel those working on the conversion drive. ?Infrastructure is not a problem. Besides a few autos, we haven?t received any taxis or other commercial vehicles in the past few months,? says Yash Khare of Lovato, which does the majority of the LPG conversions in the city.

 ?The government norm of always extending deadlines for polluting vehicles reflects its lack of concern in curbing pollution,? feels environment activist Subhas Dutta.

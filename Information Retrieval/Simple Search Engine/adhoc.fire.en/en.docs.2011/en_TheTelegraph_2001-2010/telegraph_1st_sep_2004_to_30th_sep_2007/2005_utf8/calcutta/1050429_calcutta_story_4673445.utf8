 French connection for Calcutta roads 

 - Partnerships in urban transport explored 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Imagine a Calcutta without congested and potholed roads and with sleek and efficient modes of transport, and you will be thinking like the French.

 A symposium showcasing French know-how on Calcutta roads and urban transport was organised at a city hotel on Thursday by UBIFrance (the French agency for international business development), the French ministry for infrastructure, transport, spatial planning, tourism amp; sea and the economic mission from Calcutta. 

 The Indian Chamber of Commerce had lent a helping hand to the organisers.

 ?We have been working closely with French companies for quite some time, and they have shown interest in development activities in Calcutta. The symposium was basically an attempt to showcase their technologies and expertise,? said Nazeeb Arif, ICC secretary-general. ?It also served as a platform for liaison with the state transport department to discuss potential public and private partnerships,? he added. 

 The day-long seminar-symposium was inaugurated in the presence of transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and public works minister Amar Choudhury.

 In his speech, Choudhury gave a comprehensive view of socio-economic growth across the state and talked about the pressure on infrastructural components, like transport services. ?There is an urgent need to plan for the future,? he stressed.

 Diana Beaulieu, of the French ministry of infrastructure, spoke on the significance of transport issues in urban planning and stressed the need for innovative planning to enable Calcutta to attain optimal standards in urban transportation and roads.

 The seminar on roads focussed on how the city?s thoroughfares would benefit if cement, instead of mastic asphalt or bitumen, is used in their laying or repair.

 The seminar on urban transport had speakers from top French firms elaborating on all modes of public transport. An interesting feature was a talk on driver training simulators. 

 French firms in the symposium included CGEA Connex, Corys Training and Engineering Support Systems, and Klein Access and Displays.

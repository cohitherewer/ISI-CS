 Kids day out

 RIDDHIMA SEAL

 Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), the worlds largest chicken restaurant chain, is hosting a global customer appreciation fortnight as a recognition of the support from loyal customers all over the world. As part of the celebrations, the Calcutta outlet of KFC at City Centre treated 25 underprivileged children from Child in Need Institute (CINI) to an afternoon full of unlimited fun on Wednesday.

 Lip-smacking food, fun games and interaction with the KFC mascot Chicky formed the entertainment menu of the afternoon.

 Said Partho of the City Centre outlet: Its a delight to be able to bring these children here. Even if short-lived, we have been able to bring a smile to their faces in our own little way.

 As part of the fortnight-long celebrations from September 23 to October 7, the restaurant has a whole lot of goodies lined up for customers. Every child visiting KFC will get to take home tattoos, balloons and much more. To add to the ambience and the kids experience, there will also be magicians and tattoo artistes on designated days.

 Th excitement of dining at KFC during this period is heightened with gifts for winners of the lucky seat contest every hour. Adding to the gifts galore, there are in-store games as well, for both kids and adults.

 On the last day of the revelry, KFC will felicitate its most loyal customer and favourite kid customer, who will receive a years free supply of food from the outlet.

 The celebrations are our way of thanking Calcuttans for their support to our chain. The response we have received has been simply overwhelming, added Partho.

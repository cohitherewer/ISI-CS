 Bangla blasts scar medicare, travel

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Sirajul Haque, 40, a Dhaka resident, has been suffering from tongue cancer and was scheduled to come to Calcutta for an urgent surgery. 

 But the serial blasts in Bangladesh on August 17 and the rise in border tension have forced him to change his plans.

 Like Haque, many Bangladeshis who had planned to visit Calcutta on medical tourism have cancelled their tickets after the blasts and border skirmishes. 

 And feeling the pinch are private hospitals in the city ? that have already seen a 50 per cent dip in the flow of tourists from Bangladesh ? and travel agents.

 ?Several of our planned surgeries and other medical procedures have been cancelled in the past few days,? said Rupak Barua, executive vice-president of Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Institute.

 ?The usual turnout from Bangladesh is around 2,500 per month. But this month, we are not expecting more than 1,500 to 1,600 patients. The losses are monumental,? he added.

 The situation is similar at Ruby General Hospital, which had to cancel 20 surgeries on Bangladeshi patients this week.

 ?We knew the explosions would have an aftershock, but never thought the effect would be as devastating,? said an official of Ruby hospital.

 At Kothari Medical Centre, the number of Bangladeshi patients has gone down to half of the normal daily turnout of around 40. Amit De, chief administrator of Calcutta Medical Research Institute, said: ?The slump at our hospital has been unprecedented, though not quite on the scale faced by Peerless or Ruby.?

 The hospitals, however, are not sitting idle and counting losses. Members of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), a conglomerate of 12 private hospitals in the city, have already met to discuss what could be done to defuse the tension and bring back patients from the neighbouring country.

 ?We are staring at a loss of at least Rs 10 crore in August alone. We can only hope that things would look up soon, possibly by next month? said Sajal Dutta, AHEI president. ?Travel now seems to be the last thing on the minds of terror-stricken Bangladeshis.?

 To make up for the losses, the hospitals have activated agents in Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna and asked them to convince patients that flying to Calcutta is still safe. 

 ?A Rs-400 crore market is slipping away and we cannot but act now to revert the trend,? said an AHEI member. 

 Indications from the hospital and travel industry are that several Bangla nationals are now opting for Southeast Asian destinations, like Bangkok, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

 According to sources, the daily loss of the travel industry in the past five days ? mainly because of cancellation of tickets and accommodation ? has been around Rs 5 lakh.

 ?It has been a jolt for us. Each agent, and there are around 139 in city, used to send at least 20-odd Bangladeshis per day to various Southeast Asian destinations from Calcutta. But for the past few days, they are sending around five each,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

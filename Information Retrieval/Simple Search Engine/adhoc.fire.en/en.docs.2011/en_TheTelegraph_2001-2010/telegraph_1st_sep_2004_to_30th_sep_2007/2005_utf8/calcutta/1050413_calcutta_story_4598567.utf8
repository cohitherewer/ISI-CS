 City butterfly count takes wing

 FLIGHT OF FANCY: A pair of Blue Tiger butterflies go about their business

 The city may be losing out on waterbodies, migratory birds and native trees, but it?s gaining in butterflies. And the colourful, winged creatures are not just increasing in numbers, but in species as well.

 A recent urban bio-diversity study in and around Calcutta, funded by the University Grants Commission (UGC), has revealed that the number of butterfly species has almost doubled since 1991, when a survey by the state government and then Zoological Survey of India director A.K. Ghosh had recorded only 40 species.

 The present count stands at 78. ?The species have been spotted in the region spanning South Sinthee to Joka, and from Nalban to Millennium Park,? principal investigator of the study Suchitra Ghosh said on Monday.

 Ghosh, also a lecturer of zoology at Bangabasi College, was helped in the project by Parthasarathi Ghosh and Sharif Siddique. The report will be submitted next month. For the three-year study, which started in April 2002, the UGC had granted Rs 3.5 lakh.

 Ghosh explained that growing awareness about air pollution, sprawling entertainment parks with flower beds and rooftop gardens ? which have become a trend in modern highrises ? are the reasons for the unprecedented spurt in the number of butterflies in the city proper. 

 She also pointed at the other possibility: that the species have been around for a long time, but the study in 1991 had failed to record them.

 Varieties like the Common Morne, Peacock Pansy, Blue Tiger, Tawny Coster, Red Spot Jezebel, Red Pierrot, Evening Brown and the Lime Butterfly are now often seen fluttering their way through gardens or roadside bushes or settling on flowers for nectar.

 During the study, pointed out Parthasarathi Ghosh, it was found the Agri-Horticulture Society, in Alipore, was the most rich habitat of butterflies ? in number as well as variety. The other favourite haunts are the Alipore zoo, the Victoria Memorial grounds and Millennium Park.

 Nalban, on the other hand, is a place that butterflies shun, thanks to the fishing practice at the waterbody.

 Fishermen at Nalban, Ghosh explained, are in the habit of thrashing the water hyacinth with bamboo poles in search of their prey. This poses a great risk to butterflies and instinctively, they tend to avoid the waterbody. 

 ?The butterfly is a very delicate insect. It is maimed or may lose significant signature marks on its wings if handled roughly,? pointed out Ghosh.

 Butterflies are usually trapped with a net and then placed into a transparent plastic jar for observation and identification of species, she added.

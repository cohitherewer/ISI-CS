 Back track: Kate Hudson

 It?s one film that?s meant to unlock Kate Hudson?s career that hasn?t really flourished after the big breakthrough in Almost Famous. But Skeleton Key, which is running at the city theatres, has not been a big hit abroad despite Fox TV calling it one of the best thrillers of the year.

 Hudson plays an intense young nurse hired to care for a patient (John Hurt) who is rendered speechless by a debilitating stroke. Hudson also finds herself caught in the middle of morbid going-ons in the house ? centred around a group of Voodoo practitioners ? after acquiring a skeleton key that unlocks every door.

 This is Hudson?s first real foray into horror, having mostly dabbled in romantic comedies.

 Back-to-back cartoon classics for a whole week! Kids ? and adults ? are up for a treat with 10 animation movies airing on Disney?s Sabse Bada Film Festival.

 The package of films, celebrating Diwali, includes Jungle Book, Aladdin amp; The King of Thieves, Tarzan, Pocahontas, Atlantis, Return of Jaffar, Lilo amp; Stitch, Mulan, Lion King 2 and Lion King 3. Bollywood actors have lent their voice to the characters for the dubbed Hindi versions. The movies are being aired between October 24 and 28, at 3 pm and 5 pm daily.

 Meanwhile, Toon Disney, Disney?s second channel in India, has just launched Tutenstein, an Emmy award-winning series on the adventures of a talented mummy of an Egyptian boy-king. The series, airing on the daily action-adventure block JETIX, is about the mummy resurrected after 3,000 years. 

 For a few crores more: Sanjay Dutt anchors Mission Ek Crore

 Call him Munnabhai or Parineeta?s Girish, he is one man with shoulders broad enough to fill up the small screen. So you have Sanjay Dutt dangling a moneybag as he anchors Sahara One?s upcoming game show Mission Ek Crore. ?Sanjay is a people?s man and therefore can connect well with the viewers,? Sahara One Television COO Purnendu Bose tells Metro.

 Another Kaun Banega Crorepati? Not really, claims the company. ?Our show will not be Q amp;A based,? Bose says. ?Rather, people will be rewarded for being entertained. There will be money to spend. If a participant spends it well, he will be given more money.?

 The format is an original one marking a departure from the usual practice of buying international formats. ?Fremantle will help us export the format abroad,? Bose adds. The show will debut in ?this financial year?.

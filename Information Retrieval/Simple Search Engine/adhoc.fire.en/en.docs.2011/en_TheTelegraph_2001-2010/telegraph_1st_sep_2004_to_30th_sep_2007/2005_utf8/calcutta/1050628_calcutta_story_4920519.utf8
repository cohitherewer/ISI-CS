The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dredge order ignored

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 If the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) had followed the judiciary?s advice, MV Moni might not have crashed into the underside of Howrah bridge last Friday.

 Three years ago, Calcutta High Court had asked the CPT to dredge the Hooghly immediately, but the directive was ignored, causing silt to accumulate on the river bed, hindering navigation. According to the CPT, 30 lakh cubic metre of silt needs to be removed from the Hooghly annually. 

 On September 27, 2002, a division bench, comprising then Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice Jayanta Kumar Biswas, while disposing of a public interest litigation by a city-based scientist, had asked the Centre to dredge the river with immediate effect.

 ?The Centre will take this matter in right earnest and see there is no delay on the part of the port authorities in looking into the job of dredging and making the river navigable,? the high court order said.

 The division bench expressed the hope that the global tender, invited for the dredging operation, would solve the problem to a great extent.

 ?The Centre will see to it that proper monitoring is done so that there is no further lapse on the part of the CPT and dredging is carried out sincerely, as silting is one of the perennial problems in this river,? the court order added. 

 Litigant Aloke Sanyal, former professor of physics in Jadavpur University, had charged that the CPT had failed to dredge the river and as a result, navigation was difficult.

 The petitioner alleged that the funds (Rs 400 crore annually) allotted for dredging had not been properly utilised, and sought a court order to direct the authorities to furnish the proper accounts of dredging operations. He alleged that the authorities concerned had misused public money and caused a national problem. 

 Three days after the empty barge rammed into the bridge, Sanyal threatened to file a contempt case against the Centre for its failure to carry out the court order.

 He has written to the President and Prime Minister on the issue, he claimed.

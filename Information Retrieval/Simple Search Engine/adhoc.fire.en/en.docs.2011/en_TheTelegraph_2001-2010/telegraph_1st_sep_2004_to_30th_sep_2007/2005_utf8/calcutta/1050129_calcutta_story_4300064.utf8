The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 In many of the passenger sheds at bus stops across the city, chairs have been 

put up by the authorities. These are, I assume, meant for elderly people, children 

and those of failing health. However, this is not what we get to see. Depriving 

the senior citizens and children, able-bodied young men are often seen occupying 

the chairs. Students also occupy these chairs for impromptu adda sessions. 

The authorities should put up display boards at the sheds or paint ?reserved for 

senior citizens/children/physically challenged? on the chairs. 

 Chandan Ray, Shakuntala Park. 

 Shops and makeshift motorcycle repair shops have choked the sidewalks on Kyd 

Street. This, despite the fact that some Central and state government buildings 

are also located in this area. Corporation?s garbage trucks also clog the narrow 

road near the gate of the Indian Museum. Where will pedestrians go if the stretch 

is in such condition? Foreign tourists, who put up in the hotels in the area, 

often find it very hard to even cross Kyd Street. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, Collin Lane. 

 I dropped in at the recently-renovated Flurys with my family one afternoon 

to get a whiff of the old aroma in a new bottle. However, our order ? of vegetable 

toasts and omelettes ? was taken after a long wait. Again we were kept waiting 

for the food as we settled into the warm setting and beautiful upholstery. One 

of the attendants came up to us and politely suggested that we start with some 

ready desserts. I request the management of the shop to pump more professionalism 

into the daily running of the shop. If that is not done soon enough, the legendary 

Flurys might lose its charm. 

 Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street. 

 It?s almost a decade since the construction of Shivam cinema in DD block of 

Salt Lake was started. But the work was subsequently stalled for unknown reasons. 

The hall hasn?t opened to public yet. Middle class people cannot afford to frequent 

the multiplexes in and around the area. So, most are forced to go all the way 

to the cinemas in the main city. Can?t the Bidhannagar Municipality complete the 

construction of Shivam for its residents? 

 Madhabi Ghosh, Salt Lake. 

 The Palm Avenue area, where our chief minister also resides, very dirty. The 

roads there should be cleaned regularly as is done in Camac Street, Theatre Road 

and Loudon Street. 

 S.S. Almal, Lower Rawdon Street.

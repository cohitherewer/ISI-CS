The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Roles are now written for me

(From top to bottom) Rajpal Yadav with Antara Mali 

in Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, with Rituparna Sengupta in Main Meri 

Patni Aur Woh, and with Hungama co-stars Aftab Shivdasani and Akshaye Khanna

 You are all over the small screen with your new cola commercial opposite Aishwarya Rai. How was it?

 Bahut mazaa aaya. It had a very different storyboard and working with Aishwarya Rai for the first time was a delightful experience. The script was fantastic and the response I have received to the ad has been just amazing. All credit should go to the director Ram Madhvani, who had directed the digital film Let?s Talk.

 You have also shot for an item number in Ram Gopal Varma?s new film D. How was that?

 That was kind of a new achievement for me. You can call it my debut item number. I don?t feature in the film, just the song. I had a real blast doing it.

 Why did you turn down Rakesh Roshan?s Krrish? starring Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra?

 The role was not satisfactory enough. It?s not that I refused him or something. It?s just that I didn?t like the role he offered me. So I told him that we will work for some other project in the future.

 From one-shot appearances you are now playing lead roles in movies. How do you feel when you look back?

 I have done more than 30 films till date ? small, big, medium, all types. Everything from one scene to two scenes to 10 scenes. My first break came in the form of a villainous role. After winning some awards as a villain, I moved on to comedy. When I did my first comedy, I thought that will be my only comedy. But then I kept doing comic roles. Finally Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon happened...

 How did things change after Main Madhuri??

 Uske baad comedy stamp jo tha mere upar, woh chala gaya. Everything happened for Ramuji, who could entrust me with such a big responsibility. After Main Madhuri?, I have got five to six lead roles, four to five supporting leads and even two to three guest appearances. Whatever happens, that one film will remain closest to my heart.

 But Main Madhuri? got noticed only after its premiere on television...

 Yes, when it released at the theatres, we couldn?t communicate properly with the audience and people didn?t come to see the film at the cinemas. But when it was shown on Zee TV, many people saw the film and called me up congratulating me for the performance. Yes, I would have loved it had the film done better during its big-screen release but then again, it has done a lot for me. It?s how I choose to see it ? glass adha bhara hai ki adha khali hai?

 So, now you have stopped taking on those small cameos?

 Nothing like that. One scene will still do for me provided it touches my heart and that of the audience coming in to see the film. The motivation has to be there for me to do that small role.

 Which forthcoming films would we see you in?

 I am playing the lead in Chandan Arora?s new film Main Meri Patni Aur Woh. Then, there?s a main role in another Ramuji production, whose script is being written now. I am doing David Dhawan?s film starring Salman Khan. I am also slated to do a Yash Chopra production. 

 I have received a lot of love from this industry. And no one usually calls me these days for those andu-pandu roles. Sab mein 100 per cent dum hai. In fact, roles are being written for me. Writers and directors are planning films with me in mind ? is role ke liye Rajpal ko lenge. Yeh bahut khushi wali baat hai?

 What was it like working with Rituparna Sengupta, Tollywood?s biggest female star, in Main Meri Patni Aur Woh?

 You can?t imagine how we vibed on the sets. Aisi chemistry hai hum dono ki, ki poochho mat. And the height difference only makes it better. She is tall aur main chhota hoon. It never felt like we were working together for the first time. She is a very sincere actress and a very nice human being. Once you see the film, you will know how well we clicked. 

 So, on screen at least, you are the Bengali jamai?

 (Laughs). Zaroor. And she is a big part of the film. If the patni is bad, the film can?t work.

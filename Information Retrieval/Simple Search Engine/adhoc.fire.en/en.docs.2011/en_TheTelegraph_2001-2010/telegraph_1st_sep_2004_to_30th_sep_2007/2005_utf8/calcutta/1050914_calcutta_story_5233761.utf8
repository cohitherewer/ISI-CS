The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Reopen buzz on campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Undergraduate classes at Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, suspended since September 9 after a clash among students, will resume from September 15.

 The authorities of the Shibpur campus decided on resuming classes after the students ?unanimously condemned the clash? and promised not to resort to violence in future, registrar Indra K. Sinha said on Tuesday.

 As a fallout of the clash between supporters of the Students? Federation of India and Independent Consolidation on the night of September 8, classes were suspended, hostels were vacated and placement interviews relocated off campus.

 ?Students can return to the hostels from Wednesday afternoon and classes will resume the next day. The curb on job interviews, too, has been withdrawn,? the registrar said.

 According to Sinha, what paved the way for a resolution to the crisis was a letter the students sent to A.K. Ghosh, professor-in-charge of students? affairs, on Monday. ?In the letter, the students unanimously condemned the clash, promised to abide by the code of conduct and not to allow such incidents in future,? Sinha said.

 The decision to lift the curbs was finally taken at a meeting of the four deans, registrar, hostel superintendents, director of schools, controller of examinations and the finance officer of the university.

 In the kitchen, a woman is busy preparing a formula recipe for the little one busy playing outside with Bam Bam, the deer, and Buddy the dog. The formula is a mixture of milk powder and crushed meat. ?We call it the tiger milk shake,? she smiles, pushing the jaws open and watching the tiny teeth vigorously chew the nipple of the bottle. Tiger Creek park director Teri Werner?s ?child? Sarge is a months-old tiger cub. 

 In a country that has raised a billion children, how many of us have had the experience of rearing four-legged creatures of the wild? That is why seeing them being fed and cuddled by human hands is an awesome experience. 

 Growing up Wild, beaming at 10 pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, has been one of Animal Planet?s enduring favourite shows that explores the first year in the life of a wild animal, raised by human parents. Abandoned and orphaned, these animals are given a chance at survival as human care-givers step in to provide them with medical attention and parental affection. 

 ?They are passionate crusaders who raise them for a year and then take them back to their natural habitat,? said Rajiv Bakshi, manager, corporate communications, Discovery Networks India.

 At a private screening on Friday, viewers were treated to vignettes from the first 365 days of two tigers, four lions, an elephant and a couple of rhinos.

 The journey of Max, for instance, is beamed from before his birth, with the care-giver team at Riddle?s Elephant Sanctuary in Arkansas monitoring the changing position of the 300 lb foetus through the eight-foot long birth canal and then being on the ready as his mother starts writhing in labour pain after 22 months of carriage.

 Rex was not that lucky. The two-month-old lion cub received help only after he suffered a bad limb due to calcium deficiency. Even more touching was the story of Tundi, rejected by her mother at a South African national park. His adoptive parents at Wildcare gave the baby rhino the Zulu name, meaning hope.

 ?In a world torn asunder by conflict, witnessing such real-life instances of humane conduct fills the heart with hope about the future,? mused Siddhartha Ray, frontman of Cactus, who was present at the screening with his bandmates.

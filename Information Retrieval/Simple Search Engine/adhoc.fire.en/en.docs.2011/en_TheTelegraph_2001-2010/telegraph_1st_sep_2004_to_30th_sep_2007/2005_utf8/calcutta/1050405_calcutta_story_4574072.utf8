Behind the bar

Even if you swear by your peg of whiskey or mug of 

beer, the sweet and creamy taste of an Irish Cream or a Kahlua is hard to resist 

for most with a sweet tooth. While liqueurs are catching on in a big way in the 

city (with more and more off-shops stocking them), few of us really know the composition 

of our favourite variety. 

 Here?s a factfile of some of the more popular liqueurs:

 Amaretto: almond-flavoured liqueur

 Campari: The Italian red liqueur that tastes 

very much like tonic water

 Chambord: Black raspberry-flavoured liqueur 

from France

made from artificial bananas

based liqueur, comes in white or dark

in green or white

 Curacao: Orange-flavoured liqueur, comes in 

blue or orange

 Drambuie: Scotch and honey-flavoured liqueur

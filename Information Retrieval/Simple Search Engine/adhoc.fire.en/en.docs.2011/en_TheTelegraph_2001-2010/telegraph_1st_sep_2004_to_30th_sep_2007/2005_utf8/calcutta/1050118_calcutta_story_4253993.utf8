The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Cosying up in the chill

It is here at long last, what you would call a real winter, fog cover and all. 

If you have already roasted your barbecue brown to black in anticipation, opt 

for a pyjama party now. Cuddle up under a quilt or warm up with a sizzling gossip 

or two, the nip in the air is bound to generate.

Throwing a space capsule party

Just the right week to organise one for science fiction freaks. If you call yourself 

one, there is no excuse for missing out on two celestial phenomena, one on the 

heels of the other. After the Saturn sighting on Thursday, Friday was the day 

to check out a dark spot on the sun. Anyway, the least you can do is lead the 

gang to a gravity-defying dance in space suits. Wouldn?t you say pretension is 

better than crave?

 Watching the big man on the small screen

Mogambo is no more. But you can return to that killer voice and those deadly eyes 

on your VCDs and DVDs. From Reshma Aur Shera to Hulchul, you can 

trace the incredible versatility of Amrish Puri on the small screen. For that 

change of mood, there?s always a Chachi 420 or a Gardish to latch 

on to. And if it is celluloid which beckons you, then just wait this week for 

Subhash Ghai?s Kisna to hit the theatres and say salaam, Puri saab.

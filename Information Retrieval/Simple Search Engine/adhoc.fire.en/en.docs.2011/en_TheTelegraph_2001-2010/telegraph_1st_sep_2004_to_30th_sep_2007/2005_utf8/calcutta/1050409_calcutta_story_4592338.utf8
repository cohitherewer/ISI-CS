 Theft tag hounds jobless teenager

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Everyone who knows him swears by his innocence. His school headmaster, Sheikh Kamaluddin, thinks he could never have committed such heinous crimes. But in a matter of days, 18-year-old Bappa Haldar has been turned into a hardened criminal.

 On Friday, his neighbours and local councillors blocked the entrance of Eastern Railway?s officers? quarters at New Alipore, under Behala police station, protesting the ?framing of an innocent boy by railway officer Anil Choudhary?. 

 From 8 am to 2 pm, they blocked the main gate, demanding that Bappa be compensated and offered the job Choudhary had promised him.

 Choudhary was not available for comment as neither he nor his family is in town. 

 Bappa had passed Higher Secondary in 2003, and was looking for a job. Luckily, neighbour Anil Choudhary, deputy chief engineer (civil), Eastern Railway, asked him to move into the outhouse of the Eastern Railway quarters at New Alipore, where he lived. 

 ?He promised my brother a job, and said for now, he will have to run small errands. So we all moved in,? Bappa?s sister Ratna recalled. 

 With no job in sight, Bappa reminded Choudhary of his promise. He was soon in trouble. On March 30, there was a theft in the Choudhary home, police said. 

 Choudhary alleged Bappa?s involvement in it. City police, along with sniffer dogs, and railway police invaded the outhouse. The teenager and his family were grilled. Behala police, too, turned up. Nothing was found.

 Next morning, Bappa was taken to Behala police station and arrested for this crime. On April 4, he was produced in Alipore court, and granted bail. A shocked and shaken Bappa was taken home. But the worst was yet to come. 

 Early on April 7, police went to the outhouse again, and took Bappa away, this time to Thakurpukur thana. He was produced on Thursday in the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, charged with theft, dacoity, trafficking of women and snatching. 

 When Bappa was produced in court on Thursday to pray for bail, the judge observed: ?How can a boy of such tender age commit such crimes in three days?? He was granted bail.

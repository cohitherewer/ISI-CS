 Wall drove wedge 

 - Possible motives for lynching

 Once the best of friends, Rabindra Nath Bose and Samar Nath fought over a wall on a patch of land and turned sworn enemies.

 Neighbours recall that the friendship blossomed more than four decades ago, when Bose, manager of a small-scale unit in Chanditala, and his family moved into a thatched house owned by Nath.

 The three-cottah plot, on which the house stood, on Sadhan Hari Mukherjee Road, off James Long Sarani, in Behala, was one of the several properties of Nath. 

 In 1983, Nath sold the plot to Bimal Guha Roy and by the end of the year, Bose purchased 1.2 cottahs, on which the thatched structure stood, from Guha Roy. 

 There was a vacant plot, also owned by Nath, adjacent to the land. In the 1990s, Nath had built a temple there.

 According to neighbours, the relationship between the heads of the two families was cordial then. 

 Trouble started soon after, when Bose and his son Kaushik, a group D employee of Mahestala municipality, decided to build a house on their small piece of land.

 Nath had erected a wall dividing the temple and the house. Bose had asked Nath to shift the wall, so that he could follow the norm of leaving a certain part of the plot vacant after building the house. He told Nath that if the wall stood where it was erected, he would be able to construct only one room.

 But Nath did not pay heed to Bose?s plea. Ultimately, when the house came up, there was no vacant space as required by rules. 

 ?Bose held a grouse against Nath for this and the relationship between the two families deteriorated fast and turned into enmity,? said Ramen Adhikary, a neighbour.

 There was another reason, too, for the bad blood, neighbours feel. Nath?s two sons ? Surajit (Rick?s father) and Sourav ? were doing well in business, stoking envy in Bose and his family. They started off with a motor garage in their house and later went on to set up a two-wheeler showroom.

 ?Bose could not digest the growing solvency of the Naths,? said another neighbour.

 A third factor was the reputation of Bose?s wife Bela in the neighbourhood. ?She used to steal items from the households she visited and was shunned by our womenfolk,? said Biswanath Das, a neighbour.

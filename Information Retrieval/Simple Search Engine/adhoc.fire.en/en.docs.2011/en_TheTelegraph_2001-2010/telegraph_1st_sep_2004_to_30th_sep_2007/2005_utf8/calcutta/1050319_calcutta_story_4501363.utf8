The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?I?d love to come back and shoot a film here?

On a breeze through India, the superstar director of the US 

blockbuster Hitch, Andy Tennant, talks to Pratim D. Gupta about tackling 

the wonderful problem named love, directing the whirlwind called Will Smith, returning 

to the romance of Rajasthan and more

Fools Rush In, Sweet Home Alabama and 

now Hitch ? you have become a master of romantic comedy. What draws you 

to this genre?

I find love immensely fascinating. I think love is 

a wonderful problem that we never solve. Throughout history we have had so many 

writers ? Shakespeare, Chekov, Moliere, Euripedes ? writing about love in a comic 

way or in a dramatic way. And I believe I have handled both the forms but yes, 

I love the comedy way of showing love.

 Do you play with small comic situations or look 

at the bigger picture?

Once I have the script, I try to explore a particular 

theme. Like in Hitch, there is a lot of self-esteem and self-image involved. 

The theme should be worthy of a movie, of course. Also, there should be the attempt 

to try and find your own voice through the film.

 You have a thorough grounding in theatre. Does 

it help when you make your movies?

Yes, I think it does. When I studied theatre, I studied 

the history of the art form. Why drama works. Why comedy works. When you do the 

Chekovs and the Shakespeares, you get to know so much more about things like characterisation 

and blocking. You know the difference between a French farce and a Greek comedy. 

I know some of my colleagues who have come from film schools, they know only about 

the history of cinema. That?s not bad but I believe I have a broader sense because 

of my theatre schooling. It also helps in sharing emotions on screen.

 Coming to Hitch, how did you feel with 

Will Smith inviting you to direct the film?

That?s the great thing about Hollywood. I know the 

exact day because it changed my whole year. It was November 5, 2003, when my son 

said Will Smith?s on the phone. On November 6, I found myself in New York planning 

Hitch.

 What was it like directing him?

It?s like anything. Will is a force to be reckoned 

with. He enjoys being Will Smith. With him, it?s like being stuck in a whirlwind. 

It?s just great fun. He likes to laugh and make others laugh as well.

Hitch?s leading lady is Eva Mendes who is 

Latino. From the Mexican Salma Hayek in Fools Rush In to the Hong Kong 

star Chow Yun Fat in Anna And The King to now Eva, you have worked with 

big international names. Was it difficult adapting to the different schools of 

acting?

Not really. It is important to me that I got to work 

with terrific actors of different cultures ? Salma, Chow Yun, Eva, even Anjelica 

Huston, who is Irish. Also I shot my films in such culturally different countries 

like Malaysia, France, USA?

You have been into theatre, done such great television 

work and now scored big with cinema. Which medium are you most at home with?

I like my gypsy style of making movies. This whole 

camaraderie that is involved in the process. A new film in a new city. Starting 

from absolute scratch. Living that life. Then after finishing the film, doing 

it all over again with a different group of people. In television, if you are 

lucky you may be stuck with the same set of people for five to six years.

Your television work, Wonder Years and Parker 

Lewis Can?t Lose, have been such big hits. What is the recipe of sustained 

small screen success?

Television serials are all about writing. This may 

sound and read cliched but for a television serial to work every week, it has 

to have compelling writing; some great stories. You have to keep your viewers 

completely hooked on to the serial ? that?s a great part of TV.

 Do you act out scenes to your actors or just let 

them do their own thing? 

Coming from theatre, I get to block scenes. As I write 

and rewrite scenes, however relaxed and natural they may look, they are all very 

scripted.

 Have you seen any Indian film?

Not really, but I am looking forward to watching Bride 

 amp; Prejudice. I have been touring with the Hitch team for the last 

few weeks and before that I was making the film. So I haven?t had the time to 

watch any film, not even the Oscar-nominated ones. And when I am not busy I am 

with my children watching films like The Incredibles, Shrek 2 and 

Shark Tale.

 What is the status of your scheduled thriller 

with Julia Roberts?

It was supposed to start this year but with her getting 

the twins, it will take a couple of years to take off. I was very excited about 

the film because it was to be shot in Spain.

 Locations play a huge role in your choice of films?

Oh yes! I am a big location whore. I pick movies depending 

solely on the location. My family gets to go to these places. It?s another culture 

altogether. 

 So are you impressed by India enough to shoot 

a film here?

I just came after touring Rajasthan. And yes, I am 

trying to find a way to come here and make a movie. I had these guides telling 

me great stories about the places. It was too much to digest all at once. Jaipur, 

Udaipur ? it was fascinating. I used to get back to my hotel room, then visit 

the book stores and go through all the pictures. I wanted to become a student 

all over again. I?d love to come back and shoot a film here. I have a bit of an 

idea, too.

 What now?

Go back home and be daddy for the next three-four 

months.

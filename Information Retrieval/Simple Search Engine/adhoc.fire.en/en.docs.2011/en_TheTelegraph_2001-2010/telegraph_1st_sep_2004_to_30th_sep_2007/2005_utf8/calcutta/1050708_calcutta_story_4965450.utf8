 Looking at Locarno

 She had returned from the picturesque Swiss town of Locarno three summers ago with two prizes for her Mr amp; Mrs Iyer. This August, she will be back at the Grande Piazza to decide on the fate of films competing for the Golden Leopard and other prizes from across the world.

 Film-maker Aparna Sen has been chosen as a member of the International Competition Jury for the 58th Locarno International Film Festival, slated for August 3 to 13. Besides Sen, the five-member panel represents film and cultural personalities from Italy, Yugoslavia, Iran and Taiwan.

 The Locarno event is recognised by the world film producers? association, FIAPF, as a ?non-specialised competitive film festival?, alongside Cannes, Berlin and Venice. The highlights this year are a retrospective on Orson Welles and the Leopard of Honour to be bestowed on film-makers Wim Wenders, Abbas Kiarostami and Terry Gilliam.

 ?I have been a jury member at film festivals like Moscow, Hawaii and Cairo. I had taken Konkona along with me at the Cairo film festival and we had great fun,? recalls Sen, who has travelled with her films to international festivals on several occasions. At the 55th Locarno Film Festival in 2002, Mr amp; Mrs Iyer had fetched Sen the Junior Jury second prize for best director and the Netpac Jury prize for her courage in raising an issue of relevance in a work of cinematic density.

 ?I became a jury member for the first time in 1976 at the International Film Festival of India in Delhi. I was very young then and very surprised when asked to participate. There were people like Satyajit Ray, Frank Capra and Oshima on the panel,? Sen reminisces.

 Before leaving for Locarno, she will be winding up the leftover post-production of her forthcoming film 15, Park Avenue in Mumbai. The English feature boasting a star cast of Shabana Azmi, Waheeda Rehman, Konkona Sen Sharma, Rahul Bose and Soumitra Chatterjee will probably see a year-end release.

 The 58th edition of Locarno has Rituparno Ghosh?s Bengali period piece Antarmahal, starring Abhishek Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, Soha Ali Khan and Rupa Ganguly, as one of the entries in the competition section. ?But as a jury member I will be completely impartial and unbiased?,? stresses Sen, who will be accompanied by professor husband Kalyan Ray. ?I like the people of Locarno. It?s a lovely little town,? she adds, also drawing up plans for a vacation in Rome.

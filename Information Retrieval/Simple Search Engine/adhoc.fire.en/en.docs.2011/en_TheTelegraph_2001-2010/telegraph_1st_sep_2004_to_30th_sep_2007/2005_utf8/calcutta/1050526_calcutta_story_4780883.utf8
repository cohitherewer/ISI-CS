 Caution code in drug label debut

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Bowing to intense pressure from the government and the drug control directorate, drug manufacturers in the city and elsewhere in the country have decided to mention the ?risk factors? on labels of paediatric medicines.

 To begin with, Dr Reddy?s Laboratories (DRL) has already put up labels on the suspension variety of nimesulide, stating that it is ?not recommended for children below three (03) years of age?.

 Use of nimesulide is linked to serious liver damage in children and the drug is banned in several countries. However, in India, the government has not yet enforced a ban, though it has recognised the ill-effects of the drug and enforced some restrictions on its use.

 The decision to put up labels on bottles of paediatric suspensions follows persistent demands by healthcare lobbies, which want the government to enforce a ban on all varieties of drugs that are harmful for children but are freely available in the market.

 ?The drug manufacturers have realised that no cost of manufacturing is too high if it concerns the health of the people. Putting up labels stating the risks on paediatric formulations will not solve all the problems, but it?s definitely a change for the better,? said deputy drug controller Abhijit Chakraborty.

 Apart from DRL, other drug manufacturers like Glaxo Smithkline-India have also changed the hologram on paediatric suspensions and introduced explicit dosage information on the labels.

 ?What we are trying to convey is that paediatric drugs are not only safe, but their labels also contain the necessary information that parents need before administering the medicine to children,? said a Glaxo representative.

 However, there still are quite a few manufacturers of paediatric formulations like Panacea Biotec, Alembic and Alkem who are yet to follow DRL?s example in trying to set a benchmark for paediatric formulations.

 The Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association (BCDA), too, has taken note of the development and has decided to send circulars to all its members, requesting them to ensure that the adverse effects of drugs are explained to parents when they come to buy medicines for children.

 ?We have often found that people do not read the labels. They have no idea that the labels have statutory warnings which they must know,? said BCDA secretary Samir Ranjan Das.

 BCDA officials have also instructed all its member retailers to be extra careful while selling paediatric formulations that may have side-effects.

 ?Unless the doctors also play a big role and avoid prescribing drugs that might have adverse side-effects, nothing can be done. Patients believe in magic remedies and tend to forget that the drugs might have toxicity,? added Das.

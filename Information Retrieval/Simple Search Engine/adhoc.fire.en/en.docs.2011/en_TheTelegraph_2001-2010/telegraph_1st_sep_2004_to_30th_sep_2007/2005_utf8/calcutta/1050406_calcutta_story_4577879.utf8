 A group of agitated protestors smashed a truck, beat up a traffic sergeant, set his motorcycle on fire and battled the police after the goods carrier crushed a woman to death in Baranagar on Tuesday morning.

 As on every other day, Aparna Dutta, 45, a resident of Bihari Pal Street, under Baranagar police station, was being dropped by her son Saurav, 18, on his cycle to the bus stop around 8.45 pm. She used to work in an office on Ripon Street. 

 When the cycle reached the Baranagar market area, under Cossipore police station, it came in line of a truck carrying steel plates and headed in the opposite direction on Cossipore Road. In trying to avoid the truck, Saurav lost control of the cycle, which skidded and tilted to one side. The son fell on the pavement, but the mother fell on the road. 

 The truck crushed her under its rear wheels. She died on the spot. Aparna was carried to RG Kar Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, and later to NRS Hospital for post-mortem.

 Immediately after the accident, the driver and the cleaner of the truck bolted.

?They are absconding. We have launched a manhunt. 

A case was registered with Cossipore police station,? said Barun Mullick, deputy 

commissioner of police (north).

 Local people alleged that police illegally allow heavy vehicles to ply on the narrow Cossipore Road. ?Three persons, including two women, have been killed here in road mishaps in the past month. But this figure belies the potential danger we live in. There are at least 10 schools on the stretch. We are lucky that we don?t lose one person every day,? said Gautam Das, a neighbour of the victim.

 Immediately after the accident, local people went on the rampage. They smashed the windscreen of the truck.

 Hearing the hue and cry, Debarshi Pande, a traffic sergeant with Shyambazar traffic control, who was passing by, arrived at the spot. He was manhandled by the mob and his motorcycle was set on fire. 

 A huge police contingent rushed to the spot and two fire tenders were pressed into service. 

 Protestors attacked the police poss? as well. But, after initially hitting back, police finally brought the situation under control.

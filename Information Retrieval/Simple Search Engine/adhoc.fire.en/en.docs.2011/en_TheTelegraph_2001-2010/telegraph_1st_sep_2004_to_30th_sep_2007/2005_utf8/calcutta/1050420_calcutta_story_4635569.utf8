 Couple killer by false name

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Tara Chand Banka of Mansarovar building would have a vendor deliver flowers every dawn at his door for his morning prayers. On Tuesday, the vendor came as usual, and left behind the packet, unaware that Banka and his wife had been bludgeoned to death the morning before. Picture by Amit Datta

 A preliminary post-mortem report, coupled with circumstantial evidence, suggest that Tara Chand Banka and wife Sarda were bludgeoned to death by more than one person, including the domestic help.

 Police claimed on Tuesday that the prime accused, servant Pancham, had concealed his true identity when he was employed. He had even lied about his native place. Contrary to Monday?s findings, police on Tuesday realised that the 24-year-old youth was not new to Mansarovar building. He had worked at the Bubnas? in the building a few months ago. 

 ?It appears that everything the youth said about himself was false. So, our primary job now is to ascertain the identity of the person who worked at the Bankas? and hunt him down. We have found certain leads, but it would not be right to comment on them now,? said Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief. Police said while no one has been arrested so far, 10 persons have been detained for interrogation. 

 Officers of the detective department on Tuesday claimed that Banka and his wife were killed early on Monday by two or more persons. 

 While there is no physical evidence of this, officers point at the preliminary findings of the post-mortem of the two bodies, that suggest that there were three killer weapons. Of them, two were sharp and the other blunt, possibly a frying pan. The post-mortem report even suggests that one of the victims suffered a bone fracture, indicating that the pan was used with great force and at a particular angle to cause maximum damage. 

 ?It appears that Banka would get up early in the morning, and after picking up the milk packets and flowers, doze off once again on a divan in the drawing room. The assailants first murdered him and then moved into the bedroom to kill Sarda,? said an officer of the detective department.

 Sources close to Pancham claimed that his actual name is Mahesh and he is from Jasidih, in Jharkhand. Police said on Monday he was a native of Deogarh. Pancham was introduced to the Bankas? by Paras, the Mansarovar liftman, who got to know about him from Ramu, a 25-year-old youth working as a domestic help on Wood Street for the past eight years. Senior police officers on Tuesday grilled Ramu and his four brothers, all domestic helps, Paras and the driver of the family Ramu serves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Adda and eats after browse-and-buy experience

ZEESHAN JAWED

The food court Hangout at City Centre is the latest 

chill spot in Salt Lake

What?s window shopping without a light bite, what?s hanging out without a healthy appetite? Food courts are an integral part of malls as the browse-and-buy experience is incomplete without some adda and eats.

 ?The purpose of a food court is to give a five-star restaurant feel and treatment under one roof at a nominal price,? says Manish Pandey, manager, F amp;B, Ambuja Hospitality Division.

 If the ambience is right up there, the range is rivetting. Popular street picks like jhalmuri, rolls and juices find their way to the mixed menu alongside diverse dishes in a swank setting.

 With eateries big and small courting the food court, Goodlife drops into Hangout to, well, hang out?

 Destination

 Hangout, the food court in City Centre.

 Map mark

 DC Block, Salt Lake

 Birth date

 October 16, 2004.

 Open doors 

 11.30 am to 10.30 pm.

 Building basics 

 The Hangout is divided into two parts ? the 

indoor area is 7,000 sq ft, the outdoor area is 4,500 sq ft. The total seating 

capacity is 200.

 Ambience appeal 

 The indoor area is tastefully done in vibrant 

hues and bright lights. But if you are a ?natural?, just grab a seat on the outside. 

The place comes alive in the evening when the lights come on and Calcuttans queue 

up in front of counters.

 Grub club

 The idea behind any food court is to lay out 

a spread and serve it swift. ?Having a meal outside becomes time consuming. But 

in a food court you can have a quality meal in lesser time,? says Manish Pandey.

 The platter here includes Thai, Chinese, Burmese, Sri Lankan, Lebanese, Mexican and Indian.

 Head to Dakshini for a South Indian spread. Biryani, Rava Dosa, Chicken Chettinad and South Indian coffee are hot here. Prices range between Rs 20 and Rs 90.

 Dig into Indian delights at Gourmet Calcutta for Mutton Morabba, Fish Kalia and Cabbage Kofta Curry. Price range: Rs 25 to Rs 80.

 The Lemon counter offers culinary delights in the form of Chicken Rings, Crispy Fried Chicken, Moroccan Chicken... Vegetarian delights include Moroccan Risotto Florentine and Cheese Balls. Prices range between Rs 55 and Rs 125.

 Bombay Shiv Sagar is calling all veggies, with good ol? Pav Bhaji, Dahi Puri, Bhel Puri and Papri Chaat.

 Liquid loot

 Wash it all down with fruit juices and milkshakes 

at Bombay Shiv Sagar. The favoured flavours are chiku, mango, vanilla and 

strawberry. Each glass is priced between Rs 30 and Rs 50.

 Desserts desire 

 Do not forget to pamper your sweet tooth at 

Just Asian. Polish off Zuccotta Black Forest, Caramel Custard, Sizzling Brownies, 

Sizzling Crepes, Apple Pie, Mud Pie, Baked Alaska and Pineapple Alaska, all priced 

between Rs 25 and Rs 65. The Special Kesar and Royal-flavoured Faloodas at Bombay 

Shiv Sagar are equally mouth-watering. The strawberry cream, pineapple cream, 

mango cream and lychee cream are also ripe for the picking at the same venue, 

bearing a price tag of Rs 60.

 Just jewellery

 On your way out, pause to pick up some junk 

jewellery from the vendor outside Hangout. Oxidised earrings, necklaces, rings?

 Last word 

 ?Hangout at City Centre is home to a diverse range of national and international cuisine. Moreover, the plush ambience and the seating arrangement make it a perfect hangout? ? Manish Pandey.

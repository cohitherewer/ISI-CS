The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Old friends, new strains

I feel addicted to Calcutta and it?s really great 

to be back,? announces Jonas Hellborg. The Swedish bass virtuoso, who has collaborated 

with McLaughlin on Mahavishnu and also with the likes of Lane, Satriani 

and Shrieve, has clearly developed a comfort level with the city that draws him 

to it.

 Is it any different this time? ?It?s both same and different. Same, because I get to catch up with the friends I made during the last two trips and different because I?m here with a different set of friends to perform with.? And Jonas? friends on this, his third touchdown in town, are very special.

 Steve Topping, one of the masters of the modern guitar and a favourite of fretboard guru Allan Holdsworth (?he has this unbelievable control of space?), and Gary Husband, who plays the piano and drums with equal elan, round off the nuclear rhythm ensemble.

 ?It?s a coming together of jazz-rock artistes of rare calibre and Calcutta has been the first to hear this fantastic trio, not New York,? points out Souvik Dutta of abstractlogix.com, the portal that made the Topping-Hellborg-Husband tour possible, along with The Park.

 While Jonas had already struck a chord in Calcutta, first in those two special gigs with the late Shawn Lane and then with percussionist Selvaganesh, for Steve, to whom Indian classical music is ?something of a mystery?, and Gary, this is a first in many ways.

 ?Yes, the initial chemistry seems to be good, although we are still discovering each other,? says Steve. Once he and Gary, who share a long-standing partnership, get ?more acquainted? with Jonas? style, a studio project is a distinct possibility, where Steve would ?surely love to compose?.

 For the city gigs, at a private do and at Someplace Else, there was only a loose structure, ?just a take-off point from where we tried to scale a specific cliff?, says Jonas, who is excited at the possibilities of this coalition. The Swede, who admits Calcutta has subconsciously seeped into his music, is all for breaking barriers.

 Gary, who calls himself ?a compulsive improviser?, and has straddled genres from bebop to experimental jazz to blues, is equally bullish: ?I?m happy playing both the drums and the piano. It gives me lots of options and I have a feeling this Calcutta sojourn is the beginning of something very meaningful.?

 Steve, the English axeman who hopes to do an Indian number in his next album, couldn?t agree more: ?Yes, Calcutta could kick off something special.?

 Prophetic words, if the response to the strains at Someplace Else late on Friday was any indication. It was a night for the jazz trio to set the packed pub alight with their sound. 

 The three starred in a laid-back but engrossing performance that brought in a brand of music for night-outers that was refreshingly different than the usual nights.

 The trio had reserved the evening for the Remember Shakti concert, which pushed back the starting time to well past the 11 pm mark. Most of the crowd was also high on the Shakti concert, trooping in along with Hellborg and company to round off a musical date to remember.

 ?More? was the only chant from Someplace Else faithfuls and many more.

With special effects gaining rapid ground in Bollywood ? cases in hi-tech point being Lakshya and Koi... Mil Gaya ? skilled supply is now scrambling to catch up with on-screen demand.

 To give animation enthusiasts of the city hands-on training in the craft, Digital Academy was launched with a seminar on animation, special effects and editing on Sunday. A branch of the main institute in Mumbai, Digital Academy will start with two courses on non-linear editing, and special effects and 3-D animation, stretching between three and six months. There will be separate modules for beginners and professionals. The institute is located in Everest House on JL Nehru Road.

 At Vidya Mandir on Sunday, the panel comprising institute faculty Zafar Khan, S. Tripathy and Keya Banerjee went behind the scenes of show-stealing sequences in many a blockbuster. 

 ?The job of a special effects supervisor begins with the storyboard, which entails dividing the shots. Then, you need to keep in constant touch with the director to minimise errors on location, and also interact with the camera and the lighting departments,? said Keya, the petite younger daughter of Victor Banerjee, who made a mark as a special effects supervisor in Farhan Akhtar?s Lakshya.

 A visiting teacher at the Mumbai institute, Keya spiced up her talk with a slide show ? with clips showing the difference between the original and modified versions of Hrithik Roshan?s rock-climbing scene which was actually shot on a 60 ft by 100 ft peak erected on the sets. ?Supervision was very important in Lakshya. I had to ensure that the cables and wires didn?t stick out, which made my job very difficult,? she added.

 Discussing the flourishing career prospects of special effects and animation in India and abroad, faculty member Zafar Khan said: ?Hollywood wants to outsource post-production work to India, because it is dirt cheap here. Many new production houses are mushrooming. Besides, TV, films and the broadband are opening more doors.?

As opposed to linear editing, non-linear editing provides 

the scope for digitising the film and then selecting the shots, said faculty member 

S. Tripathy. ?Our Mumbai branch will provide support in terms of placement,? he 

promised.

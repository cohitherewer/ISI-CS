 Squatters to quit by 

Dec. 15

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The squatters of Rabindra Sarobar have at last complied with the legal order and assured the high court that they will leave the Lakes by December 15.

 After receiving the squatters? undertaking, the high court issued a fresh order on Wednesday.

 According to the order, the settlers will have to form a society by December 4. The state government, after receiving documents about the formation of the society, will hand over the land (at Nonadanga, near EM Bypass) to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) by December 24. 

 The CMC will have to complete the process of handing over the land by January 1, 2006. Both the state government and the CMC will have to furnish a compliance report to the court when it reopens after Christmas.

 ?This rehabilitation scheme, if successful, will create a unique example in the world. So, our humble request to both the government and squatters is: please keep faith in each other,? said the division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly.

 In accordance with the court?s earlier directive, L.C. Behani, lawyer representing the Dhakuria?Tollygunge Rail Colony Sangram Committee, an organisation of the squatters, placed undertakings by 1,956 of the 2,738 settlers, declaring that they were ready to vacate the area.

 ?The rest will also submit similar undertakings within a couple of days. The squatters will leave the spot only after allotment of land by the government,? Behani said.

 But the division bench, after hearing Behani?s submission, reacted sharply. 

 It said: ?You are not in a position to impose any condition to leave the spot. Your clients will have to leave the spot today or tomorrow. Keep in mind that we are trying to rehabilitate them on humanitarian grounds only.? 

 Trinamul Congress leader and local MLA Sougata Roy was present in the court and he was seen whispering to Behani. The chief justice told Behani to seek advice elsewhere. Behani and Roy stepped outside. After 10 minutes, Behani returned and said: ?We are not imposing any condition. The squatters will leave the spot on their own. Please give them 20 days? time.? 

 The court gave them 15 days, instead.

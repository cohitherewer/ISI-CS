 He was part of the team that was the first to complete one of the most difficult treks to a Himalayan peak, and lived to tell the tale. Fifty years later, he?s back on a nostalgia trip. 

 What Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay are to Mt Everest, George Band, Joe Brown, Tony Sheather and Norman Hardie are to Kanchenjunga. They were the first men to scale India?s highest peak, the third tallest in the world.

 On May 25, 1955, George Band and Joe Brown made it to the top of the mighty Kanchenjunga. But in a deference to the wish of the Sikkimese people, who believe the summit to be sacred, the team stopped just a little short of the peak. At the 50th anniversary celebrations of the event by the Himalayan Club, some members of the original team are touring India.

 On Tuesday, both George Band and Norman Hardie spoke to the gathering at Ashutosh Birth Centenary Hall about their climb. 

 The slides ? all in colour, with some spectacular scenery from the peak ? were from that trek, photographs clicked by the team to record history in the making. On Tuesday, the two old but sprightly men were flooded with requests for photographs and autographs by Calcutta mountain-lovers.

 ?It has been wonderful,? smiled Band, during a short break in the daylong seminar. The visitors ? who have come with their wives ? first stopped in Mumbai for celebrations there, and even took time out to go on a walk through the Western Ghats. 

 The septuagenarian was also the youngest member of the 1953 Everest summit trek, at age 24, led by Norgay and Hillary. But the Kanchenjunga climb remains his most memorable. The peak stands at a height of 8,586 m (28,169 ft) and is technically a tougher trek than Everest. 

 On Wednesday, the intrepid group will be off to Darjeeling, for a three-day sojourn. Climbing the peak is not on the cards ? ?I?m too old to do it now? ? but ?if the weather is good, which it usually is at this time of year, then we should be able to get some spectacular views of Kanchenjunga?, he added.

 The seminar was all about reliving memories, the good and the bad, of the climb. There were scary moments, and sadness, when a sherpa died at the base camp. An oxygen cylinder that ran out was a cause for concern, as was staying too long at the top, before sunlight ran out.

 Band, who returned to Calcutta after 50 years ? ?we only passed through on our way to Kanchenjunga in 1955? ? has plans of returning to the region, in Nepal, on May 25, the day he scaled it half-a-century ago, ?the political situation permitting?.

 At 76, he runs a trekking company and still goes trekking. K2 and Patagonia, in Spain, are his two unexplored regrets. ?But as long as I can, I will continue to do this,? he laughs.

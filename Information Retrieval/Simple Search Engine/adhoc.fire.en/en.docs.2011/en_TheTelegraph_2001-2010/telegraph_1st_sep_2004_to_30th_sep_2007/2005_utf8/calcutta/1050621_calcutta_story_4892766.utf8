 In its second year, the annual celebrations of World Music Day paint a bigger picture in the city with a daylong extravaganza concentrated in and around Park Street. 

 Roping in some of the city?s well-known musical acts, along with newer outfits and experimental liaisons, formed especially for the day, the summer solstice promises to be the longest day in the musical calendar as well.

 What started off in France way back in 1982 to enjoy pleasant weather on the longest day of the year, has come to be celebrated in over 150 countries round the world today, with live music and impromptu gigs paving major streets and outdoor arenas. 

 Though still an indoor concept in this part of the world, the pioneering efforts of The French Association, the cultural wing of the French Embassy, has marked the Calcutta calendar with a special treat for music-lovers.

 ?It?s not difficult to find good young musicians in Calcutta, but many of them don?t have much opportunity to perform and often end up doing free shows for publicity. We hope our effort will help open up new avenues for musicians in the city. Last year, we organised eight concerts in five different venues and this year, we have managed to line up 10,? says Emmanuelle De Decker, deputy director, cultural affairs, The French Association.

 Calcutta?s music fraternity and some overseas talent promise to treat audiences on Tuesday to a wide repertoire that spans veteran acts like Paul Mullick on saxophone to young outfits like Light Side, comprising Rahul Guha Roy and John Bose. While Mullick will bring alive the 60s-to-80s? sound at Flurys, Light Side proposes to regale with acoustic versions of contemporary music by groups like Creed, The Calling, REM, Lifehouse and Nirvana, apart from some originals and classics as well at Barista, Park Street. 

 Between the two ends of the spectrum lie experimental endeavours like Talking Drums. It seeks to ?tell the story of two drummers, one from Africa and another from India, about how they communicate with each other through music?, with Kesivan Naidoo from South Africa on jazz drums, Angshubha Banerjee on tabla, Ananda Sen on bass and Indraudh Bose on violin.

 The sole Latin band in the country, Orient Express, has also chosen the occasion to chart new territories in dance music. Jamming live with French DJ Loopkin in Tantra, Orient Express proposes to present a unique medley of traditional South American beats and an electronic sound.

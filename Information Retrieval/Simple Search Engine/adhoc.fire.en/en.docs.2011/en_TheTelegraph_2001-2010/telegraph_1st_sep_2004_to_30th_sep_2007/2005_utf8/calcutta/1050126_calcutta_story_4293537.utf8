 Go global on Republic Day

 IPSITA DEB

 Be a good global citizen and celebrate Australian Day along with Republic Day. Helping you enjoy a cross-cultural fare, Kenilworth has lined up a barbecue and beer spread in association with Foster?s till January 30. And celebrating the Down Under national day is as good an excuse as any. 

 Everything, starting from the d?cor to the menu, screams Australia at Sanjha Chulha, the Indian speciality restaurant at the hotel. There?s an abundance of blue satin, kangaroo cutouts, balloons and posters of celebrated Australian cricketers. Even the stewards don cowboy costumes for extra authenticity.

 It all gels well with the a-la-carte menu on offer, which includes dishes like Sirloin of Beef, Lamb Ribs with Apple Sauce, Honey and Chilly Glazed Fish and Prawn on Skewer. There is a wide assortment for veggies as well, starting from Charcoal-Grilled Broccoli Corn and Asparagus Barbecue to Cottage Cheese dipped in Mint Sauce and Barbecue Jacket Potatoes with Capsicum.

 Those who prefer their tandoor to the barbecue pit should try out the Gosht Boti Kebab, Mahi Pudina Kebab, Jardalu Tangri Kebab and Grilled Chicken. Every dish comes with a refreshing Honey Raspberry Iced Tea, an assortment of bread and cheese, Broccoli Salad and a special Aussie Salad. All this with a complementary pint of Foster?s beer. 

 Add to it the latest hits belted out by local band 5th Dimension and you can happily put your Australia trip on hold for a while.

 Bistro bash

 The Bistro at 224A Purna Das Road is celebrating its anniversary with a revamped Continental menu as a birthday treat.

 While a bistro denotes an informal restaurant, this one offers much more in an ambience that is cosy and cool.

 The split-level restaurant has mezzanine flooring and comfortable furniture with a smart mocktail bar and a homely kitchen.

 ?Proper dining at its informal best is our USP and we pay special attention to hygiene,? says owner Binnoo Chaddha. He claims that every dish is cooked in mineral water and the kitchen is kept spick and span, with the restaurant kept shut on Mondays for fumigation.

 The hot favourites at the eatery, recommended by the chef, are Bistro Special Chicken Stroganoff, Chicken Steak, Bistro Cordon Bleau Cheese Steak (where you can choose from a variety of sauces ? mushroom, pepper or herb sauce), Chicken Primavera (chicken cooked with cauliflower, broccoli, mushroom, pepper and served on a bed of tri-coloured fettucini), apart from a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian pastas. 

 There are Mumbai-style street food options like Vada Pao and other Burmese, Mexican and Lebanese items like Khao Sueys, Quesadillas and Lebanese Wraps, as well.

 For die-hard Chinese food fans there are momos, chilli chicken, drums of heaven and countless other snacks.

 To cap off the sinful sojourn are chocolate goodies like Chocolately Yours served in a champagne flute with butterscotch, truffle and coffee flavours. Even the ice-cream sandwich is served with hot chocolate sauce.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The rising mercury in freezing Amsterdam 

 The IIFA Awards night on Dutch turf 

 saw the best of Bollywood blokes and bombshells setting the 

 Amsterdam Arena on fire. Here are some glimpses...

 BACHCHAN Vs BACHCHAN: 

 It wasnt part of the script, but once the 

 senior Bachchan stepped on to the stage, the crowds 

 knew who was the only Adam of the new tulip in 

 town. No wonder Abhishek tried his best to cling 

 on to his Madam, whose Kajrare kajrare 

 moves had the Dutch audience in a frenzy

 THREE TO TANGO: 

 The lissome threesome Malaika Arora Khan, 

 Lara Dutta and Esha Deol got rocking, yet 

 again, to the Kaal numbers Nassa 

 nassa, Tauba tauba and Kaal dhamaal. 

 While all three sizzled during the show, it was 

 Malaika who got the maximum hoots and whistles

 DEEP amp; DARK: 

 The Chocolate team, comprising Anil Kapoor, 

 Arshad Warsi, Irrfan, Emraan Hashmi, Sushma Reddy 

 and Tanushree Datta, showcased the Vivek Agnihotri 

 directorial debut 

 SEXY MAMMA: 

 While Bombay Rockers did Rock tha party, 

 it was Isha Sarvanis pelvic thrusts which 

 commanded all eyes

 IN YOUR EYES: 

 From Pehla nasha to Balle balle, 

 Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor portrayed filmi 

 love through the decades

 JUST CHILL: 

 Salman Khan didnt take off his T-shirt, 

 but his full-throttle performance to numbers from 

 Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Maine Pyar 

 Kyun Kiya had Katrina Kaif jumping up and 

 down in her seat

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Alliance for clean water

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A water park is all about water. That?s the point Calcutta?s oldest amusement park sought to underline while announcing a strategic alliance on Thursday. 

 As reported in March by Metro, a giant water park is coming up at Nicco Park on five acres behind the bowling alley. The Rs 6-crore mega ride, which promises to be eastern India?s biggest wave pool, will have its water managed by Ion Exchange Services. 

 ?We have taken a policy decision to supply the best quality of water at the park. Samples will be checked twice a day and the results will be put up on a board so that people are aware what state the water is in when they step into the pool,? said Nicco chairman Rajive Kaul.

 The water will be filtered every two hours, in accordance with WHO standards, park president Arijit Sengupta added. ?Clubs feel chlorinating the water is good enough. But excess chlorine just ends in itching of skin and clotting of hair,? pointed out M.P. Patni of Ion Exchange. So, filtration and disinfection will take place simultaneously.

 The two firms have also entered an agreement to market the services in India and abroad. quot;Recently, we created an amusement park near Dhaka, called Nandan Park, that comprises both dry and water parks. With burgeoning incomes, the amusement park sector in India is also expected to grow,? Kaul added.

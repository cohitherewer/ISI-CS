 Safety sieve at showpiece 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have taken measures to curb crime, but rape, dacoity, abduction, burglary, snatching and eve-teasing continue to vex Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s showpiece township.

 The vulnerability of Salt Lake lay exposed once again on Sunday when a gang of four robbers ran amok in GC block, breaking into three houses and allegedly raping a 14-year-old.

 The incident has sent shockwaves across the township, home to former chief minister Jyoti Basu and several important ministers of the present cabinet. Residents stressed that police patrols and vigil by private security agencies in individual blocks were not adequate protection. 

 ?The incident proves that the so-called security network in Salt Lake is non-existent,? said Sudeb Roy, secretary of Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association, the central body of residents. 

 ?We have been speaking to police over the years on the fragile security system,? said Ramen Das, vice-president of the organisation. He said another meeting with the police would be held in a day or two. ?After each such incident, police become hyperactive and arrest people and then things revert to the same lawlessness,? he said. 

 According to police, most of the securitymen were always too busy guarding VIPs. Sources said 110 men, along with reinforcements, are involved in keeping VIPs safe. To guard Jyoti Basu?s house alone, 57 personnel are posted. Eleven protect Asim Dasgupta?s residence. 

 However, police denied there was any lack of security in the township. ?We man all the blocks with patrol vans and keep a vigil on parks and playgrounds round-the-clock,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. 

 However, residents are not buying the argument. Dacoits broke into one house after another all night, but police were clueless till morning. 

 ?There is one patrol van of Bidhannagar (South) police station which is supposed to vigil the block at night. But every night, the van makes a round and vanishes,? said Rahul Roy, a resident of GC block.

 According to residents, there are six securitymen of a private agency deployed by the block committee. But on Sunday night, only four were on duty. ?In our annual general meeting today, we informally discussed this. I have recommended that the agency be changed immediately,? said Madan Gopal Basak, secretary of GC block association.

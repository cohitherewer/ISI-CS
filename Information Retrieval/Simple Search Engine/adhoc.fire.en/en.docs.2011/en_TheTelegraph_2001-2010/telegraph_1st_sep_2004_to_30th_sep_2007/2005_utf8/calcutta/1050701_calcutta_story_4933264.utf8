The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

Small Talk 

Throw a party to remember. When the most glamorous 

people in the country are holding on to their purse strings for dear life, put 

them to shame by organising a gala that combines the right elements of philanthropy 

and page 3 shimmer!

Star cross

 So our stars dont shine so bright after all, 

he he. Did you see them in their stingy rags! Poor greedy things, I wish I could 

lend them the paltry amount to put an end to all the hullabaloo, oh what a ridiculous 

racket! The more you have the more you want! Between the sniggers and snide remarks, 

educate the few starstruck teenyboppers at the bash about how the proposed star 

tax of 0.25 per cent stamp duty on monetary contracts valued above Rs 1 

lakh that performing artistes will have to sign has got the entire Bollywood brigade 

up in arms. They are crooning the black and white money cry in the wake of the 

new tax, which is apparently meant to fleece the industry that everybody 

tends to treat as a cash cow. 

Well, if paying Rs 25,000 per crore to the state exchequer 

is getting fleeced, we should probably take pity on them and donate part of our 

income tax to the industry that is already reeling under sundry other 

taxes! Probably thats the reason the poverty-ridden industry keeps recycling 

the same old formula of entertainment year after year, yawn! No silly, its 

all about principles. Just as they are protesting the tax being levied on a service 

(usually paid on a contract for transfer of physical property), they are probably 

training to be environment preservation mascots in the future.

Di vs DNA

And the royal soup never stops cooking either. Harry 

from Hewitt? Thats the question lashing London at the moment as it has been 

disclosed that the younger prince had to undergo a DNA test to prove his parentage. 

You cannot really blame poor charmless Charles on this one, considering Diana 

gave him a lowly one out of 10 between the sheets in the book Diana: The Last 

Word, whereas the dishy John F. Kennedy Jr got a full 10. James Hewitt, the 

army officer with whom she confessed to having an affair with and who was believed 

to be Harrys father, got no less than nine!

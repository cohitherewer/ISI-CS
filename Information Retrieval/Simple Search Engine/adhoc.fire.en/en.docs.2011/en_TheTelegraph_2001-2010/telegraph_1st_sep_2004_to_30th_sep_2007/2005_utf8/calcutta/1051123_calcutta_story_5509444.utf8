 Ant-bite slap on nurses

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government will initiate departmental proceedings against six nurses at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital for their negligence in the ant-bite case.

 Fifty-year-old Gouri Rani Chakraborty died last Tuesday morning at the hospital after black ants had nibbled on her eyelid through Sunday night.

 ?As per the post-mortem report, though the eyeball was intact, around 1 inch-by-1.5 inch of her eyelid was full of abrasions due to ant bites. This indicates that many ants must have bitten the patient over a long time. Though the patient ultimately died of diabetic coma, the nurses present in the ward cannot shirk responsibility,? health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said on Tuesday. 

 Six nurses, including those on night and morning shifts, will be showcaused. The nurses will have to reply to the showcause and on their response, responsibility for the incident will be fixed. 

 ?Exemplary punishment will be meted out to the guilty, so that an incident like this does not recur. If a patient is unconscious, nurses attending to him or her are expected to look after them. In this case, it seems the nurses didn?t attend to the patient all night,? said Mishra.

 After Chakraborty?s death, the hospital authorities and the victim?s family had come up with varying versions of the cause of demise.

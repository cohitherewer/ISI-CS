The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Straight from the heart

for the tsunami cause starring world music biggies and matinee idols

Bands and musicians getting together in Calcutta to 

raise funds for tsunami victims may be finding it difficult to make people dig 

deep into their pockets. But their big brothers in the West seem to be faring 

better. Are we surprised?

In the UK, a concert at the Millennium Stadium in 

Cardiff to raise money for tsunami victims sold out in three days. According to 

reports, the demand has been overwhelming, with 20,000 of the 60,000 tickets snapped 

up within an hour of opening.

The line-up of the gig includes British pop and rock 

stars, both veterans and upcoming. Topping the list of those who have already 

confirmed participation at the January 22 concert are Eric Clapton, Keane, Charlotte 

Church, Craig David, Manic Street Preachers, Badly Drawn Boy, Jools Holland, Lemar, 

Aled Jones, former M People singer Heather Small, Liberty X, Feeder, Snow Patrol 

and Embrace.

New names are being added almost every day for the 

event aiming to raise one million pounds in aid. It has already been dubbed Live 

Aid II, with reference to the Bob Geldof-promoted legendary Live Aid concerts 

in 1985 that raised millions of dollars for famine victims in Ethiopia.

On a more classical note, stars from West End musicals, 

as well as singers from the Royal Opera House, are to appear at a concert entitled 

A New World on January 23 to raise funds for the tsunami appeal. 

Crossing over to the other side of the Atlantic, musicians 

and Hollywood stars got together to do their bit. On Saturday, television network 

NBC aired A Concert of Hope, featuring Madonna, Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, Elton 

John, Diana Ross, Maroon 5, Mary J. Blige and Nelly. Proceeds from the show went 

to the American Red Cross.

Madonna and company joined Usher, John Mayer, Lenny 

Kravitz, Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan, Gloria Estefan, Norah Jones and more. Hollywood 

stars including George Clooney, Clint Eastwood, Robert de Niro, Halle Berry, Meg 

Ryan, Morgan Freeman and others manned phonelines and appealed to viewers to contribute. 

But the show wasn?t without its share of controversy. 

Fox TV commentator Bill ?Reilly doubted if all the money raised would actually 

reach the victims. George Clooney, one of the organisers, hit back saying comments 

such as these would only discourage people from contributing to the cause. Reilly, 

later, put in a brief appearance at the show. 

Other individual efforts include one by Virgin Megastores, 

which is planning to launch 100 Acts of Support ? The Concerts for Banda Aceh. 

This will feature a full day of 100 live performances in its 20 outlets on January 

20.

Rock act Linkin Park?s Music for Relief project has 

seen a growing list of artistes including Jay-Z, Hoobastank, Michelle Branch, 

Korn and Staind donate money.

Sting has also announced that he will donate 100 per 

cent of the proceeds from his February 10 show at Perth to tsunami victims.

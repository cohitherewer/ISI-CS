The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Awards for drug crusade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city police rounded off a four-day awareness programme on drug abuse on Sunday, International Anti-Drug Day, by felicitating organisations and doctors fighting the problem for years. It was the first such programme organised by the city police.

 Over the past four days, people were provided with expert advice and printed matter on drug abuse from kiosks set up in each police station area. 

 Three youths, associated with an NGO, also covered the 48 police station areas in the city on bicycles to spread awareness among the common people.

 The drive culminated in a programme at Nazrul Mancha. Schoolchildren participated in essay, slogan and poster competitions on drug abuse at the venue. They were awarded prizes, along with representatives of 12 NGOs and doctors.

 Among those felicitated were Joba Guha and Ramdas Gupta of Kripa Foundation, a city-based rehabilitation centre for drug addicts; K.L. Narayan of Antara, owner of Calcutta Samaritan; Vijayan Pawamani and D.P. Mullick.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said in his speech that doing drugs used to be a preserve of the rich. 

 ?It has reached the grassroots now.,? he rued. ?When a woman finds that her husband and son are not asking for food for over eight hours after taking a drug that costs between Rs 10 and Rs 25, she heaves a sigh of relief. At least, she would not have to arrange for food. The state of things is pathetic. We are doing our best to cure youths of the bad habit,? he added.

 Commissioner Mukherjee invited more NGOs to come forward and work against drug abuse. ?The task will become easier if more organisations join the effort.?

 Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (special), detective department, described how the city police were working to bring drug addicts back to the mainstream.

 ?We have plans to visit schools and inform children about the bad effects of drugs,? she said.

 Members of the NGOs also spoke about their activities during the programme.

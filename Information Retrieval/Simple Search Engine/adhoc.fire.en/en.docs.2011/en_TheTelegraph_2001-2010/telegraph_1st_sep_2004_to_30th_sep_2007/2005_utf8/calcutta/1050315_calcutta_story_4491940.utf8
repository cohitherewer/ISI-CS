 Water tanker keels over, kills woman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 50-year-old woman was killed and a 26-year-old man seriously injured when a water tanker skidded and overturned near the Park Circus seven-point crossing on Monday morning.

 The woman was trapped under the vehicle. The man was rushed to National Medical College and Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical. The driver of the tanker fled.

 Residents of the area blocked traffic to protest the accident. The blockade was lifted after senior police officers assured protesters that action would be taken against the driver of the tanker.

 The accident occurred around 8 am on the Park Circus-EM Bypass connector, police said. The victim, identified as Begum Bibi, and the injured, Sarafat Ali Mandal, were crossing the connector.

 ?The driver of the tanker, which was headed towards the Bypass, lost control of the vehicle after crossing the seven-point intersection. It first skidded off the road and then overturned,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The woman, a resident of Roy Charan Ghosh Lane, in Park Circus, was hit by the tanker from behind. The vehicle overturned on her after she slumped on the road.

 ?Mandal had a narrow escape, as he fell on the pavement after being hit by the vehicle,? said a traffic department officer.

 ?We could not start rescue operations immediately as we could not move the tanker. The crane arrived after 15 minutes,? added the officer.

 Another officer at Lalbazar police headquarters said: ?Begum was dead by the time we removed the vehicle. Her head was smashed. We have sent the body for post-mortem.? 

 Sarafat, a resident of Sonarpur, who lost consciousness after being hit by the tanker, received injuries on his head and chest. ?His condition is critical and we have kept him under observation,? said a doctor at National Medical College and Hospital.

 Traffic near the seven-point crossing was affected for over half-an-hour because of the accident. ?The accident was a result of rash driving. Traffic sergeants are deployed at the crossing, but they are seen sitting on their motorcycles most of the time, instead of regulating traffic and taking action against reckless drivers,? alleged Sheikh Raju, a local resident.

 Armaan and Jassi: Back together

 Having won many a heart across the nation, Indian Idol Abhijeet Sawant has now lent his voice to Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin. In the popular show on Sony, destiny has finally brought Armaan and Jassi together after a long separation, a gruelling court case and an attempted murder. With millions watching the long-awaited unison with bated breath, the addition of Abhijeet in the scheme of things certainly makes the whole set-up more spicy.

 Composed by Raju Singh and choreographed by Bosco amp; Ceaser, the special romantic music video featuring Armaan (Apurva Agnihotri) and Jassi (Mona Singh) will be a treat to the eyes and ears. To be launched by Sony BMG in association with the Sony channel, the video will be exclusively showcased on Monday, June 6 at 9.30 pm on Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin.

 The album titled Top 7 songs from Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin will also feature Kailash Kher and Shaan apart from Abhijeet Sawant. Speaking on the launch of the video, Gursheel Walia, creative director of Sony, said: ?Armaan has always been Jassi?s first love and the man of her dreams. Eventually, fate decides to bring them together, hence we present the romantic couple in their first ever exclusive music video sung by our very own Indian Idol, Abhijeet Sawant.?

 If you were always keen on knowing the red carpet fashion of the Oscars, well, it?s time you looked closer home. The IIFA Awards, arguably the biggest awards show of Bollywood, is planning to inculcate every aspect of the Academy Awards glitz and glamour.

 To be held in Amsterdam this year on June 11, the IIFA Awards has got ace fashion designer Manish Malhotra to specially design clothes for the stars as they make their red carpet arrivals before the ceremony gets underway. Speaking to Metro, Manish says: ?I?m planning to incorporate some interesting aspects in the dresses. Our actresses have the tendency to go for saris on such occasions. I want to do something different from that.?

 So will it mean gowns, Cannes style? ?Why so?? asks Manish. ?IIFA is trying to formulate its own identity. So the designs should be different too, not like the Oscars or the Golden Globes. I want to make the dresses unique with a character of their own.?

 Apart from designing the outfits of Kareena Kapoor and Urmila Matondkar, Manish is slated to design the performance dress for Kareena, who will be accompanied by Shahid Kapur on stage.

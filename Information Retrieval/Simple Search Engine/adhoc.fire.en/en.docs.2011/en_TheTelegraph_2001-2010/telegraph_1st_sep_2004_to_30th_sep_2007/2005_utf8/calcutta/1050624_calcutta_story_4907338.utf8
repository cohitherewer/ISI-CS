The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of college wear and dare 

Dressed for the campus

 - Each campus has its own code of sartorial self-censorship

 The jeans aren?t low-slung enough to offend, the miniskirts aren?t short enough to raise eyebrows and the necklines don?t plunge deep enough to spell trouble. As Mumbai universities stare at a hem-waist-neckline clampdown, sartorial self-censorship seems to be the norm on the Calcutta campus.

 Youngsters confident of sticking to norms of decency in class feel three-quarter pants and shorts should be ?banned? for boys, and too much skin, with skimpy outfits, are not suitable for girls. Apart from that, anything goes.

 ?You have to put the issue in the cultural context,? says Father P.C. Mathew, principal, St Xavier?s College. ?Calcutta is still traditional. It hasn?t reached the levels of Mumbai or Delhi. We don?t need a dress code in our college, because students don?t step out of line.? 

 While Xaviers has basic guidelines governing what not to wear on campus (?objectionable clothes, too much make-up??) there are no official don?ts at Bhawanipur College.

 Although there are a large number of fashion design students who frequently experiment with clothes and styles, there has never been any ?untoward? incident, says honorary general secretary of the college, Heena Gorsia.

 ?A dress code is required for every situation and every place. Dressing appropriately is the key. There are unwritten and unspoken rules that the youngsters respect? There is no point in imposing anything,? she adds.

 Students and teachers agree that what is modest for one person might be outrageous for another. It?s all about ?perception?. The students of fashion designing at Bhawanipur are happy to let college corridors double as ramps and ?draw reactions? from the peer group.

 Talk of a dress code ? on the lines of what is being proposed at Mumbai University, with the vice-chancellor feeling that students are ?crossing the limits of decency? ? draws a frown.

 ?Imposition of a dress code goes against the very essence of our campus where everyone is accepted for who he or she is,? feels Madhumita Das of Jadavpur University, rubbishing efforts by Mumbai University officials to blame ?scantily-clad girls? for the rising cases of rape and molestation.

 Some sort of discipline, but not harsh, is what 25-year-old Ritu Bajaj, pursuing a course in fashion designing, advocates. ?A certain independence is needed, but within limits. For example, girls can?t wear to class things they?d don for a night out.?

 Comfort married to an inherent conservatism seems to be the defining dress code on even the most happening campuses in town. As 20-year-old Priyanka Sharma puts it: ?Some discipline is needed. After all, we are students.?

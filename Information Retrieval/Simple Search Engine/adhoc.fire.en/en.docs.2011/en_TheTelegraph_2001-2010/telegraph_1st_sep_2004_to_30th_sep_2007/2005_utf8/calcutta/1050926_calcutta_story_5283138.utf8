 Hi-tech lightning guard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A state-of-the-art system will soon protect city skyscrapers and vital research facilities from lightning strikes. 

 Duval Messien, a French multinational that manufactures Satelit-3, the lightning protection system, has tied up with Macmet India to make the devices available in Calcutta.

 ?We have already held talks with power distributors, research laboratories and public sector units regarding installation of the device,? said Sanjib Banerjee, chief executive officer (engineering) of Duval Messien.

 ?The response has been encouraging from the government institutes that conduct research in key areas and the manufacturing companies,? said V.N. Varma, director of Macmet India.

 According to sources, talks are at the final stages with some government institutes. 

 A conventional lightning protection system consists of a receptor (a metallic piece of copper) installed at the highest point of a building, a down conductor (a thin strip of copper or galvanised steel) connecting the receptor to the ground and an earthing arrangement underneath. 

 ?In large establishments, such arrangements have to be replicated every 30 m, around the periphery of the structures, and interconnected to form a grid,? explained Banerjee.

 The new system uses an electronic device called Early Steamer Emission Lightning Conductor (ESE). The ESE is also set up on the highest point of buildings and connected with the down conductor.

 The earthing system of the new device has been modified to improve its effectiveness. A singe ESE system will be adequate to protect buildings upto 120 km away, Banerjee claimed.

 ?The new device does not wait for the lightning to strike. It is pro-active; an in-built sensor detects changes in the electrostatic field during storms,? he added. ?The system also has built-in self-check circuits that constantly check its efficacy. The condition of its health is transmitted every 90 seconds through radio signals that can be received by a hand-held remote control tele-tester device,? Banerjee signed off.

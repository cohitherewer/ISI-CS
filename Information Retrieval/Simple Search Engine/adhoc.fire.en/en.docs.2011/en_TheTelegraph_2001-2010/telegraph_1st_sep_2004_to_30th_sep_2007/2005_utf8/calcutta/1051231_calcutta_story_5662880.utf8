 Souvik Gupta is the second in a family of four brothers, thalassaemia patients all. One of his younger brothers died early this week of the disease, but that hasn?t stopped the chirpy Class V student from taking the stage to play the lead in Alap Bilaper Ichhetoru. Not just that, the pint-sized actor has also dragged his elder brother Sagnik to dabble in theatre.

 Alap Bilaper Ichhetoru kicked off the Fifth Shuvam Natyamela hosted by Beadon Street Shuvam at Bijon theatre on Thursday. Unveiled by Bibhas Chakraborty, the children?s group theatre festival is dishing out a six-play spread ? five by children and one by their parents.

 Formed 21 years ago on the pavement of Umesh Dutta Lane, the theatre troupe has been working with children from the lower-income group since then. Some come from red-light areas; a few have been victims of sexual abuse. But most of them live in and around Umesh Dutta Lane, Ahiritola and Hedua.

 Around 40 children attend the workshops and weekend acting classes held by Shuvam at the nearby Chaitanya Library. ?I have wanted to act since childhood. We have so many friends here and we have a lot of fun. My brother and I look forward to the classes on Saturdays and Sundays,? smiles Souvik, as his co-actors Vivek De, Puja Mondal, Binay Dolui, Paramita Dolui and Akash Patra huddle around him in the make-up room.

 ?This play came about while we were playing,? smiles 10-year-old Binay, as his sister Paramita prances about in an all-pink dress. A 12-year-old girl, who developed speech problems after being sexually assaulted, has been training with Shuvam for three years. Now, she loves to sing and dance on stage and dreams of becoming a teacher.

 ?We have had six-month rehearsals before putting them on stage. We had to teach them the movements through a lot of games,? says Susanta Dutta, director of Alap Bilaper Ichhetoru. The other five plays are Panch Chashi, Jatiner Juto, Chhinath Bohurupee, Jakhon Dakghar Achhe Amal Nei and Arajokata.

 The play by the parents, Arajokata, is an effort to bring the elders into the theatre fold. ?There are autorickshaw drivers, thonga-makers and some who make wrappers for incense sticks, as well as schoolteachers in the cast. Making them a part of the process encourages them to send in their children,? says a spokesperson for Shuvam.

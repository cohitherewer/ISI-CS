 Holi hungama

IPSITA DEB

With the day reserved for a riot of colours, you would 

have thought the city was gearing up to party all day and night. But perhaps a 

preview of how the clouds were piling up in the sky prompted party places to go 

easy on Friday. With rain playing spoilsport and wet, wet, wet being the order 

of the pre-Holi days ? without buckets or balloons ? Goodlife goes through 

the few happy Holi zones keeping the festive flag flying: 

 TANTRA, THE PARK 

 A special Holi night on Saturday titled Is Raat Ki Subah Nahi features Nilofer Khan and Gladrags model Zabyn Khan in a high octave night of drama, music and entertainment. The alcoholic thandai festival at this nightclub is worth a gulp, too!

 BED

 Mast Friday Call of the Pichkari day organised by BED, but not in BED. From 10 am on Holi, at Tikmani Baganbari off the state highway 33, some four km from Science City, the private party intends to rock till late evening. With entry being by invitation only and food and beverages being on the house, like-minded party people are bound to have their spirits kept high all day long.

 NALBAN

 Holi music masti live from 10 am to 2 pm. Traditional dhol and dhup performances by Ramesh Goenka and troupe. The boating complex is bound to get hotter, too, with a mud area, Go-Get-Wet zone and plenty of coloured water sprinklers and gulal. 

KOOKIE JAR

This confectionery has come out with a host of Holi 

delicacies in the form of pichkari-shaped cookies, cakes and pastries with 

colour splashes and brownie bars with Holi greetings and colours (picture left). 

Priced between Rs 25 and Rs 1,000, these baked goodies are great gifts. 

THE KENILWORTH 

 The hotel hosts the Guzre Hue y Yaadein food festival celebrating three decades of the Marble Room Menu. In celebrating the festivities of Holi, a special menu has been lined up that comprises an assortment of food in colours from different parts of India. Be it the Mutton Burra Kebab, Goan Prawn Curry or Aloo Jodhpuri, there?s something to suit every palate.

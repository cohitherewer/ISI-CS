The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

One has just started off, while another one is about 

to come to an end. I am talking about calendar years. The financial year has just 

come to an end, accompanied by the last-minute rush for tax-saving attempts! On 

the other hand, the Bengali year of 1411 draws to an end. In another week, 1412 

will be upon us. The weather is also undergoing a transition, with the last vestiges 

of the morning chill finally giving way to the city?s typically oppressive summer 

heat and humidity.

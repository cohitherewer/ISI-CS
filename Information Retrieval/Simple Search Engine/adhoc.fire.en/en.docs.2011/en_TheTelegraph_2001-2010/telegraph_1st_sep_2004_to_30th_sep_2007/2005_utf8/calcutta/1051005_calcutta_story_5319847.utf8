The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gizmo sales music to the ears

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The latest smart phone or a portable gaming console or the slimmest laptop? Technology is giving tradition a nudge in the rush for gifts this festive season.

 And, the hottest thing going off the tech racks is the Apple iPod.

 At exclusive Apple dealers or standalone music stores and general shopping malls, the portable music player is the pop pick to be seen with.

 ?We?re selling three to four iPods a day and around 100 a month,? says Sanjay Chordia, an Apple dealer in central Calcutta. ?Now, we don?t ask the customer whether he has an iPod or not. Instead, we ask him how many he has.?

 That, for a product priced between Rs 6,500 and Rs 30,000 and considered niche, audiophile-only even a while ago.

 And now, enter Nano. The launch of the latest version of the iPod, super-slim and feature-stuffed, has added another reason to make a dash for the world?s best-selling music player.

 ?The Nano arrived only last week and we?ve already had bookings for around 10 units,? says Chordia. ?We are looking at it as the main sales driver.?

 Other models ? the Photo, Mini and Shuffle ? are also doing well.

 ?For an expensive product like the iPod, sales are very good? We are moving around 30 units per month,? says Chetan Arora of MusicWorld, that has been stocking the players for the past three months.

 According to estimates, around 400 iPods are sold over the counter every month in the city. Add the grey market to this and Calcutta would struggle to fit the gadget-unfriendly bill.

 The boundary lines between buyers are getting more and more blurred. Teenagers pick it up for its cool factor, young executives fancy it as the perfect jogging companion, the elderly go for it as the perfect gift for GeneratioNext.

 ?We had a father picking up a couple of iPods for his son and daughter, while a wife got one as a gift to her husband on their anniversary,? says Gautam Jatia of Landmark.

 The Durga puja and Diwali demand is music to the ears of dealers, as the iPod fast emerges as the preferred gadget gift. ?We have people coming in with credit cards and asking for delivery to companies within 24 hours,? says Chordia.

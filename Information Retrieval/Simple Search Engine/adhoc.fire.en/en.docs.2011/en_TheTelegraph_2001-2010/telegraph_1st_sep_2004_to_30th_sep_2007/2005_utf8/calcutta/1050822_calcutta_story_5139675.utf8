The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Garbage bane in growth spurt

 BISWAJIBAN MAJUMDAR, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality, met readers of The Telegraph in his office to answer their queries. Participants included Reba Dutta, Rathin Kumar Saha, Bula Mukherjee, Bijit Chowdhury, Dilip Kumar Das, Dinesh Chandra Poddar and Tapas Sengupta

Bijit Chowdhury: With growth in population, Salt Lake is becoming dirtier by the day. Plastic bags are scattered everywhere, the markets are in bad shape and people commit nuisance in public. Can?t the municipality be stricter against the dirtying of the township?

 The population of Salt Lake has been increasing by leaps and bounds. Buildings have rapidly come up on vacant plots in the last 10 years. This spurt has had some fallouts, one of them being the litter.

 Recently, we took up a project to clean the drainage and sewerage lines in the township. In the process we realised that plastic bags are causing serious damage to the system. Sacks and bricks are also choking the drains quite frequently. Even rubble generated during building construction is being disposed of in the waste channels.

 There is serious need to make the residents more aware of proper garbage disposal. They should realise that the township and its infrastructure are their own properties and the onus is on them to keep Salt Lake clean.

 To stop people from committing nuisance in public, we have plans to set up public toilets in collaboration with a voluntary organisation. Once that?s done, we can strictly implement the rule.

Bula Mukherjee: What are your plans regarding the choked sewer lines? 

 Funds crunch was a major hindrance in solving the problem. Recently, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta asked the urban development department to purchase a jet pumping machine, worth Rs 4 lakh, to clear the choked lines. However, several factors have caused an alignment problem in the sewer lines of Salt Lake. Our engineers are working on a solution.

Dilip Kumar Das: The outdoor patient department of Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital is in shambles. The lifts are not working and Matri Sadan, the maternity hospital, is perpetually deserted. Even the doctors are almost never available.

 The sub-divisional hospital is not under our control. Nevertheless, we have requested the authorities to improve conditions there. Matri Sadan is a World Bank project and is mainly for the people of the added area.

Tapas Sengupta: Are you planning to take steps to legalise land transfer in Salt Lake?

 A large section of the state ministers want freehold land in Salt Lake. The municipality feels the same way. If the government seeks our opinion, we will support such a move.

Bijit Chowdhury: Water wastage is rampant in Salt Lake. Taps are needlessly kept running in many a household, leading to a water crisis. 

 There is a misconception that Salt Lake suffers from water crisis. Per head water supply in the township is double the supply in an average locality in Chennai or Delhi. The demand for water in Salt Lake is four million gallon per day. We get two million gallon from Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The rest of the supply comes from our deep tubewell. Water crisis in Salt Lake is limited to localities and due to technical problems. But the residents definitely need to become conscious about water wastage. 

Dinesh Chandra Poddar: Several blocks in Karunamoyee housing complex suffer from severe water problems. The reservoirs are not even filled to half their capacity. Will the municipality do something about the problem?

 I am aware of the problem. The crisis exists mainly in phase I, which is the oldest. The new phases get adequate water supply. We have decided to set up a pump house for phase I. 

 Concluded

Floral force for mind matters

 Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, placing a picture of flowers 

or fresh flowers floating in water in a blue ceramic bowl in your auspicious direction 

on the study table can energise your learning ability and memory

Q: I am a student of Class XII. My 

DOB is 12.12.85. I occupy a room in the north-east corner of my house and face 

east while studying. I am below average in academics. What can I do to get better 

results?

Neha

The Solution: You belong to the east group 

and your auspicious directions are east, south-east, north and south. The north-east 

room that you are occupying is the best room in general for education. You are 

doing the wisest thing by facing east while studying, which is your Sheng Chi 

direction. But remember to protect yourself from negative Chi in the form of beams, 

pillars and sharp edges. Use wood elements in the east of the room and the study 

table. Place a picture of flowers here or some fresh flowers floating in a blue 

ceramic bowl to energise your learning ability and memory.

Q: Our flat is U-shaped, where two 

flats are connected through a narrow passage running from the west side. My husband, 

children, in-laws and I do not enjoy good health. Could the shape of the flat 

be responsible for our problem? 

Suvidha

The Solution: In a U-shaped flat, the centre 

of the house known as the Tai Chi area falls outside the house. Moreover, when 

the flat is connected from the west side, a big cut is formed in the east of the 

house. Both these areas are primarily connected with the health of the occupants. 

You should install a large mirror on the eastern side of the passage to create 

an illusion of space and depth. This will bring the centre and the eastern side 

back into the house. You can also paint the eastern wall in a light green shade 

and keep the passage well lit.

Q: I will be appearing for the Joint 

Entrance in April. My actual date of birth is 27.11.85 but officially, it is 10.08.86. 

What is my auspicious direction and number?

GG

The Solution: The actual date and time of your 

birth should only be considered for assessing your auspicious directions and number. 

Not knowing your gender is a problem, but if you are a male, your Kua number is 

six and your auspicious directions are west, north-east, south-west and north-west. 

If you are a female, your Kua number is nine and auspicious directions are east, 

south-east, north and south.

Q: I am a girl born on 27.02.87 and 

will appear for my board exams next year. How can I get good results? What are 

my academic prospects? Also, what are my favourable colours, elements and directions?

S. Talukdar

The Solution: You are a strong fire person 

with lot of wood elements to support you. Wood represents education for you and 

this means that you will be highly qualified. You are going through your favourable 

earth period, which represents intelligence and will bring out the best of talent 

and potential. To maximise your luck, surround yourself with earthy, metallic 

and water elements and their colours like beige, cream, yellow, white and blue. 

North-east, west, north-west and south-west are your auspicious directions.

Q: I had built my house in 1998 but 

have not seen any kind of prosperity since the day we moved in. Can renovations 

in the form of adding another floor to the existing structure bring good luck?

Javed

The Solution: According to Flying Stars method, 

the period eight began on February 4, 2004 and will last for next 20 years. The 

change of period signifies a major change in the energies around us and with major 

renovations, auspicious energy can be invited into the house that will bring with 

it abundance for the next two decades. Adding a floor gives a new roof that brings 

with it new heaven energy. Changing the flooring could also work to bring in new 

earth energy. Repositioning the main door to a position where good stars exist 

also helps avoid bad luck.

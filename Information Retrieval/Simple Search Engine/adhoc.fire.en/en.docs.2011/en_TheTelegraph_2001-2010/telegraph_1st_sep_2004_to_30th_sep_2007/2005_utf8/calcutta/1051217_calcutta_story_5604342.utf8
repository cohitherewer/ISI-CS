 Be it the chaat counters lining Lindsay Street or the phuchkawallahs dotting the Vivekananda Park, if you are a true-blue Calcuttan, chances are you swear by some street food stop or the other.

 But between December 14 and 21, you can give your regular roadside destinations a miss and head for Oh! Calcutta, instead.

 For, the swank eatery at Forum is hosting a Calcutta Street Food Festival.

 Cooked up by Chef Joy, the delicacies served include classics such as Hinger Kochuree and Aloor Dum, Maangsher Ghoogni, Telebhaja, Chicken Cutlet, Dimer Devil, Vegetable Chop, Chicken Chop, Mughlai Paratha and Keema Mughlai Paratha. And theres the Chicken Roll, Fish Roll, Jhaal Muri and, of course, phuchka. 

 We have drawn up the menu in such a way that the entire family can enjoy a meal together. While the elderly can go for some nostalgia bites, the younger ones can opt for stuff like jhaal muri and phuchka, says Joy. 

 The street food spread ? in air-conditioned comfort ? costs around Rs 150, for a meal for two.

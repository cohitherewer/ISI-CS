 Mayor rules out hawker eviction

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hawkers will remain on Calcutta?s roads, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya declared on Tuesday.

 ?Lots of people depend on the hawkers and their eviction will affect thousands of innocent members of their families,? Bhattacharya reasoned. ?Hawking is not a problem unique to this city. The dilemma vexes administrations of all countries on this planet. Hawkers can?t be evicted.?

 The mayor acknowledged that the hawkers have almost choked sections of the city, and offered: ?They will be shifted to less-congested places. But evicting them will be unfair to the thousands of people who cannot afford to visit shopping malls and depend mostly on the hawkers.? 

 According to the mayor, those who peddle their wares on busy roads will be given an option to shift elsewhere. 

 ?We will ask the hawkers to move to places earmarked for them so that common people are not inconvenienced by their plying a trade.?

 The mayor made the observations during an interaction with the media, organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

 The ICC proposed seven measures for a facelift for the city. ?The mayor agreed to almost all our proposals and consented to form a joint workgroup,? said Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, ICC. 

 Foremost among the proposals is the beautification of the riverfront. ?Calcutta is one of the few cities that have rivers running through them. All over the world, such cities have made the riverfronts hubs of entertainment, shopping and culture. Why shouldn?t we do the same?? asked Arif. 

 The ICC had submitted a proposal of riverfront beautification to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation 30 years ago. On Tuesday, a modified version of the proposal was handed over to the mayor. 

 If there is scope of private sector participation in the riverfront beautification, the ICC will try to organise investments, promised Arif. 

 ?There is a need to first formulate a masterplan. Otherwise, it will be difficult to secure investment,? the ICC secretary-general added.

 ?Here, riverfront beautification is being conducted in a phased manner. This is not conducive for procuring investment. The investors must know the entire plan before they can think about putting in money,? Arif signed off.

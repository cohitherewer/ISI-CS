 The boon of birth register

 - Certificates for the asking

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 It?s proof of age, but most people don?t bother to collect the birth certificates of their children from the local civic body. 

 Though the certificate is a must while taking admission to school or applying for a passport, parents ? out of ignorance or lethargy ? either do not register the births of their children or fail to obtain the certificate even after registration.

 Starting July 11, World Population Day, the government will run a special drive to spread awareness on the necessity of birth certificates and issue the documents to children below 10 years whose parents have not collected these.

 ?The drive is a step towards our goal ? a hundred per cent registration of births and deaths. According to a national policy, the target is to be achieved by 2010,? a senior state health department official said on Thursday.

 The drive is the second phase of a national campaign on the importance of birth certificates. The first phase ended in December 2004.

 The upcoming drive will target:

 Children below 10 years whose births have been registered, but the certificates have not been issued 

 Children whose births have been registered without a name

 Children whose births have not been registered.

 In many cases, a birth may have been registered but the certificate has not been collected by the family. At times, a birth is registered simply as a ?female baby? or a ?male baby? on the basis of information from the hospital or nursing home. The family concerned, thereafter, takes no initiative to include the name and collect the certificate.

 ?We will tell people that we are conducting a special drive and will issue the certificates within a brief period. We will also ask the civic bodies to get the work done at their end. People should realise the significance of the drive and hurry up,? the health department official said. 

 The officials are now in the process of sending instructions to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and various district magistrates. The government has asked the civic authorities to scan records and identify all unregistered births in the past 10 years.

 The civic bodies and the district magistrates have also been asked to promptly issue the certificates to those whose births have been registered in the past 10 years.

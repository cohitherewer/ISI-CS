 Student shot dead for dues

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A youth, identified as Mohammad Shariff, has been arrested on charges of masterminding the murder of Arfatun Jaman, a 21-year-old ITI student, in Barasat on Wednesday evening. 

 The motorcyle that Shariff allegedly rode while committing the murder has been impounded. 

 Preliminary probe suggests that Shariff had engaged his brother-in-law, Babu, for killing Arfatun.

 ?Arfatun had bought a motorcycle from Shariff two months ago and agreed to pay Rs 33,500,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). ?He had made an initial payment of Rs 10,000, but Shariff refused to hand over the vehicle?s papers unless the balance was cleared.? 

 Shariff had allegedly planned to kill Arfatun, take the money from him and the motorcycle as well, the officer added. 

 According to police, Shariff went to Arfatun?s house on Wednesday afternoon and asked him to take the money to the Hridaypur branch of a private bank at 3 pm.

 When both reached the bank, Shariff asked Arfatun to accompany him to his house, as he had left behind an ?important document?, without which the transaction could not be completed.

 Arfatun followed Shariff, both riding on separate motorcycles. 

 When they reached a playground at Chandanpur, Babu fired at Arfatun, killing him on the spot, an investigating officer said. 

 Shariff asked one of his neighbours to keep Arfatun?s motorcycle for a few days, as ?his house was not spacious enough? for two vehicles.

 ?The neighbour saw blood stains on the vehicle and became suspicious. He called up Shariff, asking him to take it back, and also informed us about the matter,? said an officer of Barasat police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Centre prod for gender sensitivity

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Alarmed by the growing evidence of female infanticide in this city, the Centre has shot off a letter to the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government asking it to act fast. 

 The evidence: the child sex ratio in Calcutta is lower than the overall figure in West Bengal. 

 The child sex ratio in the city is 923 females for every 1,000 males, against the overall child sex ratio in the state (963), according to the 2001 census.

 The situation began to worsen about a decade ago, when there were 955 female per 1,000 male children (aged between zero and six years) in the city, against 967 female per 1,000 male children in the state.

 ?We have received the letter from the Centre and have taken serious note of it. The matter will be taken up with the school education department so that curricula are made gender-sensitive,? social welfare secretary S.N. Haque told Metro on Sunday. 

 Reva Nayyar, secretary of the department of women and child development, under the Union ministry of human resource development, wrote in the letter: ?Declining female sex ratio, particularly in the age group 0-6 years, is a disturbing factor and the main reason for the decline in the overall sex ratio in the country.?

 For this, the Centre has asked the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to ensure that revised textbooks and curricula for schools contain information on child rights and the textbooks are made gender sensitive. 

 The state government has also been told that special emphasis should be laid on awareness of the rights of the girl child.

 The Centre also feels it is important for teachers themselves to be sensitive about gender issues, and, therefore, has asked the Bhattacharjee government to see to it that similar changes in curricula are made in teacher?s training and education. 

 ?This is a very important element, because if teachers are themselves biased and sexist, there is no way they can ask their students to be gender-sensitive. Neither can they teach their students these issues well enough,? a senior state government officer said.

 According to the letter, female infanticide and female foeticide in some parts of the country have contributed to a ?major drop in the girl?s share of the population?. 

 This, the letter explains, leads to further sex-related crimes against the girls, ?when there are few and fewer women available for the men to marry?.

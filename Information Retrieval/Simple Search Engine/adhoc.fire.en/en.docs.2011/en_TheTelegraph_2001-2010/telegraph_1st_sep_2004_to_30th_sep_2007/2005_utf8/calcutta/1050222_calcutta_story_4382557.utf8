Crowning glory

Sangita Sultania G. Roy finds out 

the rules of creating a sylvan lair of luxury on the terrace

Chances are, your growing kid will be able to identify 

shades of grey faster than those of green. As sprawling bungalows fringed by lush 

green lawns and a well-tended garden increasingly become extinct with highrises 

likely to win the battle for survival in the jungle of concrete, a refreshing 

patch of green stands to become a rare sight. 

Die-hards may try to make amends by tending to bonsai 

for ages before they bear a single fruit or flower, but any nature freak will 

tell you that pots and pans look best in a kitchen. But before you turn to the 

last resort of painting your walls green, spare a thought for a terrace garden. 

This option is of course open only to folks blessed 

with a top-floor apartment with a terrace to call their own. But if you do belong 

to this lucky brigade, it?s about time you put the divine open space to better 

use than drying your laundry. Imagine lolling on a soft thick carpet of green 

amid fragrant blossoms and the sound of trickling water? 

It costs quite a packet and the expert advice of a 

?landscapist? to create such an oasis. But if you are willing to postpone your 

Europe tour for a while, here?s how things are likely to look. 

Spadework 

As you walk on the velvet cover of green in a terrace 

garden, it is hard to fathom about seven inches of spadework underneath, not to 

mention months of hard work. One first needs to ascertain the load the building 

structure is capable of taking, get the plan approved by the civic authorities, 

freeze on the design and then get down to waterproofing. 

There are various waterproofing solutions available 

in the market, but here again, it?s best to enlist the help of professionals in 

the field. Then you need to install a spread of three-inch perforated PVC pipes, 

connected to the main drainage system, to ensure there is no stagnation of water. 

A two-and-a-half-inch layer of iron foundry residue 

or jhama is dumped next, which is also a draining agent. For extra protection, 

a fine mesh of nylon net covering is spread throughout the length and breadth 

of the garden area with adequate skirting using the same material. This keeps 

the soil from stagnating. 

Two-and-a-half to three inches of coarse sand filling 

follows. Finally it?s time to lay in the soil compost, which has been pre-treated 

with pesticides, insecticides and fungicides. Apart from the farmyard manure, 

the soil compost consists of loam and leaf mould. The soil has to be given a couple 

of months to settle down before it is time to plant the grass, which has to be 

given various lawn treatments thereafter. 

Flower power

It is finally time to smell the flowers, and you are 

bombarded with a baffling range of choices here. ?Nature is bountiful and you 

can pick and choose your way through a riot of colours,? says landscape artist 

Deepa Choudhury, who has designed terrace gardens in quite a few houses in Ballygunge 

and Alipore (pictures by Rashbehari Das). She cautions against choosing varieties 

that have deep percolating roots and goes on to name endless varieties of shrubs 

and flowering plants one can pick. 

Apart from ?low maintenance? creepers like bougainvillaea, 

which add a lot a colour, one can plant shrubs like bottlebrush, radhachura, 

aromatic creepers like juhi and chameli, golden duranta, varieties 

of hibiscus, shiuli, chanpa, song of India, togor, gardenia, 

seasonal flowers like petunia, pointsetia, various kinds of grass and asparagus, 

to name a few. 

Says interior designer Manjari Sahay, who has done 

up quite a few terrace gardens in the city: ?We have a common roof-top garden 

in the apartment building we stay in New Alipore. Throughout the year we keep 

on planting seasonal flowers. Also, we have palms, bougainvillaea and other creepers 

growing all the time.? 

If you want to add utility to beauty, you can treat 

a section as a kitchen garden and grow seasonal fruits and vegetables as well. 

Clusters of low shrubbery used as ground cover complete the look as far as flora 

go, helping to bring out colour and depth.

Fountainhead

A fountain or a waterfall here, a couple of rocks 

thrown there, stone artefacts and split-levels make all the difference between 

a green patch and a designer garden. While you are free to give imagination a 

free reign here, ?balance and harmony? has to be maintained while designing your 

garden, says Choudhury. You can add stone or rock benches as a restive corner 

or just plonk on a big boulder.

?We have cement seats in our garden that resemble 

tree-trunks. A small waterfall on one side with ferns surrounding it enhances 

the beauty,? says Sahay.

You will get a variety of stones and slates in the 

market that make perfect natural accessories, in tune with the concept. 

?The placement of rocks should look natural and casual. 

Overdoing it might ruin the whole effect,? explains Choudhury. Complete the look 

with a concrete pathway, preferably in steps.

Party zone

What is a terrace garden without a rocking party or 

two? A few thoughtful additions at the conception stage ensure life-long fun. 

A clear patch of elevation or a split-level landscaping in the scheme of things 

can be treated as a mini stage to be taken by the neighbourhood guitar player 

or an acoustic band to enliven a gathering. 

There must be adequate electrical fittings to ensure 

enough light and sound fury. Spot lights, underwater lights and pedestal lights 

are some of the options that suit a terrace landscape. While it goes without saying 

that the lighting should be muted, one can add to the entire romantic charm by 

installing antique pedestal light fittings, preferably of iron and glass variety 

or terracotta-look stone ones. And if you have a wee bit of extra space to spare, 

there?s nothing like having a live kitchen counter on your terrace. ?We have lots 

of parties on the terrace and hence the garden has fixed food and bar counters. 

There is also a separate area for live music,? adds Sahay.

Prune perfect

If you plan to take up gardening after retirement, 

a terrace garden is a perfect investment. ?There is more wear and tear in a terrace 

garden as opposed to one on the ground, as the sun is closer home,? cautions Choudhury. 

The ground cover and a variety of shrubbery needs regular pruning for a neat and 

trim look. 

This apart, regular manuring and application of insecticides 

and pesticides is a must. So until you feel confident enough to handle the hoe 

yourself, it is best to enlist the services of a professional gardener.

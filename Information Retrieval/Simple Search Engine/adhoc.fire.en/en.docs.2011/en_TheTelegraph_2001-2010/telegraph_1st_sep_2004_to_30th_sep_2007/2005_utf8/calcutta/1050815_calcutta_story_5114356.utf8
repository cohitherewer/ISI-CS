 Thefts by servants take a dip

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Thefts and robberies in the city involving domestic helps have reduced by nearly 50 per cent against last year, claims Calcutta Police. The credit, cops say, goes to an awareness drive for employers initiated by the law-enforcers last year.

 ?The incidence of robbery and theft involving domestic servants has almost halved,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department.

 According to police records, 76 thefts and 73 robberies by domestics were registered between January and July last year. The same period this year saw the figures scale down to 49 and 33, respectively.

 Elaborating on the dipping theft and robbery graph, a detective department officer said: ?We had initiated a massive awareness drive to acquaint Calcuttans with our guidelines before recruiting domestic helps. The effort is still on and the current statistics are proof that our drive has been effective.?

 Sleuths also feel that since the launch of the campaign, servants employed at households are also wary. 

 ?We request people to provide us with details about their servants and encourage them to use identity cards issued by the local police stations. Result: the servants now fear that they will be tracked down if they commit a crime,? said another officer of the department.

 ?A study has revealed that domestics are involved, directly or indirectly, in most robberies in the city,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rail ring links in place

 - Twin projects will help train commuters skip break journey

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Commuting within Calcutta and between the city and its rim areas will be faster and qualitatively better from June, thanks to the commissioning of two Circular Railway link projects ? one between Prinsep Ghat and Majherhat, and the other between Dum Dum Cantonment and the airport. The project cost: Rs 230 crore.

 ?The Prinsep Ghat-Majherhat project will be ready this month, and the Dum Dum Cantonment-airport link next month,? a senior Metro Railway official said on Sunday. Metro Railway is the implementing agency of the project.

 The twin projects will complete the ring of railway lines around the city.

 After its completion in May, the Prinsep Ghat-Majherhat project will be handed over to Eastern Railway. ?We will take over the project and operations will start soon. But dates for handover of the Dum Dum-airport line have not been finalised yet,? an Eastern Railway official said. 

 According to Metro officers, 99 per cent of the work on the first project is over, while that for the second one has progressed 90 per cent. Once operative, the Majherhat-Prinsep Ghat project will make it easier for commuters from the southern fringes to travel directly to the city?s hub.

 ?We are drawing up plans to start local suburban train services between the southern and northern suburbs of the city. This will help commuters from the north and south to travel without a break in the journey,? the official pointed out. 

 The line from Prinsep Ghat will cross Tolly?s Nullah and is connected to Majherhat, covering a distance of 5.8 km. There are two stops ? Kidderpore and Remount Road ? between the two termini. 

 The Dum Dum Cantonment-Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport project will help passengers to and from the airport to directly avail of Eastern Railway?s EMU services. The 3.8-km track, of which 2.8 km is elevated, has one station ? Jessore Road ? between Dum Dum Cantonment and the airport. 

 From Dum Dum Cantonment, passengers can reach their destination at Sealdah and can also avail of Metro services from Dum Dum junction.

 The Prinsep Ghat-Majherhat Circular Railway project was deferred by nearly a year owing to initial problems of land acquisition from the army. Railway officials said things were sorted out later after discussions between then railway minister Nitish Kumar and defence minister George Fernandes.

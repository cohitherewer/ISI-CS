 Like many of the finer things in life, this is not meant for everybody and is blended for the more educated palate. A select few in the city got lucky and had a taste of Johnnie Walker Blue Label scotch, a blend of some of the rarest whiskies in the world, at the Oberoi banquets on Tuesday evening.

 Conducted by master blender Ian Williams from The Home of Johnnie Walker in Scotland, a whisky appreciation session saw the Calcutta cr?me partake of the blend that was awarded the prestigious gold medal for the Best Blended Whiskey at the International Wine amp; Spirit Competition.

 Recently enrolled as a Keeper of the Quaich, named after a traditional two-handed Scottish drinking cup (also known as the cup of friendship), Williams advocated drinking Blue Label from a wide-rimmed brandy balloon or a wine or claret glass. ?This helps capture the whisky?s aromas, releasing its warm, dark-gold hue into the glass,? explained Williams.

 Though he himself prefers drinking Johnnie Walker Red Label with cola, Williams insisted that Blue Label be drunk on the rocks, ?the best way to appreciate its rich, viscous flavour?.

 Bartenders at hand were directed to serve a glass of iced water on each table laid out for the silver serve dinner to follow. The water was to cleanse the palate after each sip of the scotch, blended from a choice of seven million casks of whiskies.

 Those who found its peaty, smoky flavour too much to take, however, were allowed to mix a little water with their drink, which ?helps open up the flavour of the whisky further?. Yet others not familiar with the ?acquired taste? of the drink were put at ease by Williams who urged the guests to go as they like, ?for whisky is not a thing to argue about, it should just bring happiness?. 

 Folks eager to down their drink also had to bear with the blender with over three decades experience who insisted that one first nose the whisky to get the full aroma.

 Then one was to take a small sip, roll it around the mouth and let it trickle down the throat ?ever so slowly, the secret behind enjoying a really old whisky?.

 A Johnnie Walker Blue Label bottle, however, does not state any age. ?We blend very old whisky with some fantastic new ones. The age label on a bottle states the youngest whisky in the blend. Age is not a guarantee of quality in whisky, really. It?s all about achieving a delicate balance between some rare old and new whisky,? explained Williams.

 The result is an ?extremely rich whisky that is wonderfully moist and leaves a viscous coating in the mouth?. The taste of a Johnnie Walker Blue Label can be likened to that of ?a unique blend of figs and Christmas pudding along with a woody and smoky flavour?.

 The smokiness is, in fact, the signature of the brand, said Williams, while adding in the same breath that two people drinking from the same bottle may not get the same taste. ?It?s a very personal thing and the taste grows on you with time,? he observed. 

 Differences also lie in scotch drinking habits in various cultures. ?Americans, for example, love their whisky on the rocks, while in Scotland we take it with a dash of water,? revealed Williams.

 Cultural differences apart, the taste of whisky has changed over the years. ?While the roots are the same, we are drinking lighter whisky today, at least flavour-wise,? felt Williams. 

 Duty free is a big market for the brand and sells best in countries like Korea and the US. Priced at Rs 19,055 per litre, Blue Label still forms a nascent category in India, revealed a UDV India spokesperson, the company in charge of marketing the brand in India. 

 On Tuesday, though, it was on the house to go with an elaborate four-course dinner comprising a choice between Chartreuse of prawn tails and a light mousse of crayfish tails with shellfish bisque foam or Roast Provencal vegetable quiche with mixed salad and tomato fondue for starters.

 This was followed by a Genovese Minestrone with parmesan chips soup. For the main course one was offered a non-vegetarian option of Chicken Roulade filled with chicken mousseline, saut?ed greens, mashed potato and creamy porcini mushroom sauce.

 The vegetarian counterpart was Vegetable-filled Ravioli, slow-poached tomato and asparagus served with sage and butter sauce. Dessert included some sinful chilled chocolate mousse and cats tongue on a pineapple and grand marnier sauce.

 Those who thought that was the last and the best, had not listened carefully to Williams? verdict of Blue Label being a fabulous after-dinner drink. But the guests who did take the sage advice to heart were rewarded with some mellow music by Don Saigal and his band to go along with the tipple talk over candlelight and under dim chandeliers.

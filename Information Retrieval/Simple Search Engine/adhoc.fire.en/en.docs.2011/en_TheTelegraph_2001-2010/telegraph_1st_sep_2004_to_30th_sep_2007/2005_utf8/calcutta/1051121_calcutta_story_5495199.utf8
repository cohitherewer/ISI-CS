 The Raffles, Singapore; Royalton, New York; Costes, Paris; The Park, Calcutta? The trend, which started in 1984 with the Morgans Hotel in Manhattan, today has a global tenor to it, and The Park property in town, named the best boutique hotel in the country by the department of tourism in 2003-04, is a proud member of the boutique bandwagon.

 The Park Hotels is Indias first and only collection of boutique hotels, declares Salmoli Mukerji, director, public relations. The term boutique hotel refers to hospitality addresses designed with the same attention to detail that one would find in a specialised store or boutique that offers customised services and products. It is usually small, luxurious and very intimate. 

 The boutique-ness of the place, besides the element of style, lies also in the warmth of human interaction, according to Anirban Simlai, director, food and beverage.

 Its the bond between those rendering service and those enjoying it that matters. We have always believed in breaking the prim--proper mould of star addresses and laying out a very relaxed ambience, he stresses.

 This cosy, flexible, chill-out mood permeates through the corridors ? and extends to food presentation and styling, another highlight on the roster of boutique hotels. 

 From the Open Samosa and Mishti Doi Mousse at Saffron to the Infusion Vodka at Roxy and the Red Snapper and Pork Chops, plus the 14 different kinds of coffee at The Atrium, its a culinary trek in contemporary style and setting.

 Resident chefs like Yvonnick Jegat Denaiu (French), Nut Kunlert (Thai) and Thierry Thonnate (French), and visiting chefs like Antonio Carluccio (Italian, rated among the top 10 in the world) have enriched the cuisine canvas at the Park Street address.

 Be it the Aqua in Delhi, the Leather Bar in Chennai or the I-Talia in Bangalore, we have always believed in creating de-stress destinations with a difference, says Salmoli.

 And The Park Calcutta, the groups flagship property, has constantly managed to keep pole position in the entertainment grid.

 Someplace Else, which set out to revive the lost glory of Calcuttas live music scene, managed to create a niche and its success story is even a case study at IIM, Calcutta. 

 We had started with just one band, Nondon (Bagchi) and gang, and people were extremely sceptical then. Well, the rest is history, as they say, and today, there are even a 100-odd SPE members chatting on the Net, smiles Anirban.

 Tantra, too, played its part, being largely responsible for triggering the nightclub revolution sweeping the city. And now, Roxy has been positioned as a cocktail bar that blends the traditional with the contemporary and sets out to revive the laidback, intimate feel of old Calcutta bars of the swinging Sixties.

 Training is an important aspect in the development of the young management team at The Park Hotels. We run our own management training programme and operational training programme and every year, our managers are sent to top international training institutes like the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, London Business School, Harvard Business School and Ecole Hoteliere De Lausanne, Switzerland, says Salmoli.

 The Park also has an intimate connect with local art and culture. An art tour at the hotel covers 60-70 original pieces, while kantha and terracotta are extensively used in the interiors. 

 The hotel has a tie-up with NGO Action Research for Conservation of Heritage for a heritage walk of the citys central business district and the old brick quarters of north Calcutta.

 The Park, Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai and New Delhi are members of Design Hotels?, the only group in India to enjoy this association, according to Salmoli.

 Design Hotels Inc represents and markets an international collection of design-oriented city hotels and exceptional leisure resorts under the brand Design Hotels?.

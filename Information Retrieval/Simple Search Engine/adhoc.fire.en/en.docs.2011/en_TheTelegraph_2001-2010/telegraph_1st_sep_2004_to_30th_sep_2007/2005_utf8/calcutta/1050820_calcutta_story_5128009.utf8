 Fashions favourite blues

 The all-season, all-occasion garment that rsquo;s always scored top marks on the style charts just got hotter this season. Ipsita Deb takes a look

 The blue denim is a fashion classic and (above) embellishments and prints on jeans are hot right now

 Its perhaps the most versatile piece of clothing hanging in your closet, giving you comfort through the years and never fading out of style. Blue denims are a classic like very few other items in the world of fashion.

 College-goers, party animals or celebrities, the garment finds favour with people of all profiles and age groups. For girls especially, theres nothing more stylish than a pair of blue jeans. Its a silhouette every fashionable woman must have in her wardrobe, insists designer Nikhil Mehra.

 Be it flared, boot-cut, straight-leg, low-waist or slim fit, a pair of jeans is popular in all its forms. Whats more, even if its not ironed, worn out and faded beyond recognition, it can still help make a style statement. 

 The versatility of denim is what I like most about the garment. It can be a very utilitarian style for getting your hands grimy, a baggy fit for relaxing at home, a low-rise or stretch fit to team with feminine tops or a fancy embellished or distressed pair for clubbing. My favourites are the darker denims that look great on any evening out, says actress Raima Sen.

 However classic and eternal, denims too are subject to fashion trends and a cut thats popular one season might be totally out the next. Goodlife checks out some hot cuts, colours and styles doing the rounds right now.

 Colour caper

 When it comes to colour, especially with the denim fabric, its all about extremes ? very dark or very pale. Popular colours range from dark indigo and black to light grey and pale blue. 

 Nowadays the denim brands offer every conceivable shade from bottle greens to flaming reds, but the eternal favourite still remains the classic blue. 

 The most sought-after colour in the Calcutta market is distressed blue, a shade thats dynamic, unisex and extremely viable for all occasions, says Schumone Jay Chatterjee, director, Levis India.

 According to Nikhil, dual-tones, as opposed to monochromes, are becoming increasingly popular. Enzyme washes, resulting in dual shades of ash grey and dark blue, are quite a hit, he says.

 Slim silhouette 

 Forget flares ? the hottest thing on the block is the slim fit, with straight or pencil legs. This silhouette has a lengthening effect ? making short legs look longer and long legs endless. Levis capitalised on this trend, or rather catapulted it in India, with a striking Bipasha Basu campaign, where the latter emerged looking slimmer than ever before.

 Slim fit is right now in focus. While jeans are going lower from the navel, theyre getting shorter from the ankle as well. Be it slim capri fits or turn-ups, the sportier the better is the mantra. These look great with high-heeled shoes, adds Nikhil. 

 Pocket pick

 Pocket stitching and pockets placed just below the waist are the hit styles on the jeans brigade, while button-fly jeans still remains number one on the popularity charts. 

 Globally, the the 501s ? the original button-fly jeans that were launched way back in 1873?have remained the most popular variety. Of the 200 million pairs of Levis jeans sold per year, 40 to 50 million pairs are 501s, informs Schumone. 

 Pattern perfect 

 Stripes, checks, florals or studded? embellished denim is another global trend. Be it classic stitching across the pockets, embroidered butterflies or simply a torn effect, patterns and prints on denim are the disco divas best friend. Merging denim with other fabrics also lends a stylish appeal. The most common is linen with denim, which looks absolutely stunning, says Nikhil.

 Faded feel 

 Another way of playing up denim is through bleached or stone-washed looks. Bleaching adds a sense of texture and alters the colour of denim for a worn-in look, as does stone-washing. Frayed edges and torn knees add to the lived-in look.

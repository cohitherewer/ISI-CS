The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon appetease

Victor Banerjee

Lord Outram lends his name to a filthy bathing ghat 

that quietly blends sewage with chemical pollutants that would have killed Vidyasagar 

if it existed when he swam across the Hooghly to visit his ailing mother and thereby 

deprived future generations of elementary education and a beautiful bridge.

Then there is a street suspended between Shakespeare 

and someone forgotten called Short and houses a rather boisterous club of people 

whose lifestyles only emerge after dark, cheek-by-jowl beside the soundless and 

cloistered Carmelite Church whose nuns never appear at all. 

That concludes my research into the life of Lieutenant 

General Outram who came to Calcutta to be sent to Lucknow to persuade our last 

independent ruler, the Nawab of Oudh, to come to the land where Tipu lived at 

the Tollygunge Club and whom, Outram that is, the British honoured by erecting 

two statues; one in England and one that lies hidden on a rearing horse at the 

Victoria Memorial.

The fact is Outram has as little to do in any of our 

lives as Amitabh Bachchan has in the lives of farmers in Hunan and I in your partner?s 

experiments in the kitchen. But when you want to get from Camac Street to New 

Market at 2 pm and make a left at Shantiniketan, you go past an arterially blocked 

cardiac centre beside an Iskcon temple and turn left at a massage parlour to confront 

busloads of schoolchildren. You then flee past Uttam Kumar?s old residence, past 

ambulances going both ways to Belle Vue and hit Rawdon Street to be forced to 

reverse up a one-way system to dive into Auckland Square and weave past an art 

gallery and finish up near Harsh Neotia?s exclusive Conclave with flags limply 

proclaiming exclusivity. And that is when you realise you are once again a victim 

of central Calcutta?s maze of one-way streets that change directions at 2 pm amidst 

Chaplinesque chaos as none of the police sergeants? watches synchronise, and it?s 

easier to walk. 

That is how I ended up on Outram Street one afternoon. 

Lost and misdirected and in search of a way out that only the Carmelite church 

reveals to weary and depressed wayfarers who have no means of accessing channels 

on television that bombard you with astrological solutions to all our problems. 

And for those with chronic problems that neither the 

nuns nor stars can cure, there are doctor channels with Dickensian apothecaries 

who will cure every phobia and paranoia besides the fear of an ordinary man?s 

everyday existence.

As I stepped out of Mt Carmel, I looked up to heaven 

to see if relief was on its way and noticed an elflike chap in a chef?s hat, with 

his head stuck out of a first-floor window, looking down on a world of hungry 

souls whose plaintive cries for salvation had gone unheard. A closer look and 

I recognised a familiar moustache under the top hat that reminded me of some of 

the best meals I had had at the Chambers in the Taj Bengal. But that little bird 

had flown its coup years ago, to I knew not where. 

Chef Basu was always a demure gentleman in a white 

smock, with a bird-like voice that loftily chirped the cadences of continental 

cuisine to his ravenous guests. The trill of canap?s and the full-throated call 

of entr?es followed by the twitter of desserts that began while we were sipping 

Chardonnay that numbed the exorbitant prices that would come home to roost after 

Chef Basu had finished, made a meal under his supervision a gastronomic delight. 

He waved to me to come up. As I walked up the stairs 

to a place called Tangerine, I had never dreamed that Outram Street, of all places, 

would have such a cosy and comfortable restaurant run by someone who really knew 

his onions, garlic, oregano and poisson and pastries to perfection. His 

apple tarts were to die for. Chef saw I was a trifle hysterical. He sat me by 

the window and served up a chilled cocktail that ran through my heated cylinders 

like a coolant. And as I looked out on a dead street, I reminisced on XXX and 

that is the recipe I shall give you.

Hang the absurd one-way system; I have now been garrotted 

by two flyovers. The first that deceptively takes me from the openness of the 

Royal Turf and dumps me into the gridlock of a seven-point crossing in Park Circus 

that is followed by the chicken neck of the No. 4 bridge and the second that whizzes 

me over Mother Teresa?s Nehruvian mess and dumps me into the gaseous intersection 

of Esplanade to be followed by the tram and bus and cart crossing on Lenin?s sarani. 

As consolations, the first lands you close to my favourite restaurant Zeeshan 

and the second close to Anadi Cabin whose dhakkai parothas inspired the 

Japanese investors to end the flyovers where us bhog bilasi (gluttonous) 

Bengalis would never object.

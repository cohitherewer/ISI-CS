The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Question mark on return

 - Police refuse to buy missing groom?s abduction tale

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rajiv Bhattacharya may have surfaced in Mughalsarai on Friday, but his reappearance remains as shrouded in mystery as his disappearance from Ultadanga two days ago.

 The London-based IBM employee had come to the city on May 29 to get married on Friday. He was last seen at Ultadanga, in front of an HSBC branch, on Wednesday morning.

 Bhattacharya has told police in Uttar Pradesh that he had been kidnapped, but police in Calcutta remain unconvinced, insisting that there are too many loose ends.

 ?We have spoken to our counterparts in Mughalsarai a number of times and collected Rajiv?s statement. After going through it, we are still not clear about a number of points,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division), who is overseeing the probe.

 The unanswered factors are:

 Rajiv told Mughalsarai police that he was whisked away by 

 four persons in Ultadanga and dragged into a car, in which 

 he had fallen unconscious after being beaten up and drugged. 

 When he came around, he found himself in the compartment 

 of a long-distance train. 

 Police say they found no witnesses 

 to the incident that supposedly occurred at 11 am in crowded 

 Ultadanga. They insist he could not have been abducted undetected.

 The Government Railway Police and the Railway Protection 

 Force in Mughalsarai said a search team had found Bhattacharya 

 in a compartment of the Mumbai Mail stationed at platform 

 no. 3. He was cowering in a sleeper coach of the train and 

 police recognised him from a photograph that had been circulated 

 by Calcutta Police.

 However, Shamim said in Calcutta that no such thing had occurred and that Bhattacharya himself had stepped off the train just as it was leaving and reported at the GRP office, requesting that he be sent back to Calcutta. 

 Bhattacharya told police that his abductors kept a close 

 watch on him and would beat him up severely, asking for 

 his Salt Lake residence telephone number. How is it that 

 no one on the train noticed anything untoward?

 Bhattacharya has told police that he did part with his residence 

 phone number and the abductors apparently made calls after 

 that. However, the police in Calcutta, as well as Bhattacharya?s 

 family members, insist that there was no ransom call. So, 

 what was the point of beating up Bhattacharya to extract 

 his phone number from him?

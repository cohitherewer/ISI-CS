 Yes, he did it one more time. Presenting one of the most applauded and high-voltage sequences and the most unique bridal line seen at the three-day fashion gala at Bridal Asia 2005 was none other than our very own Sabyasachi Mukherjee. Showcasing at the grand finale of the wedding extravaganza in Delhi on Thursday night, the young designer bowled over the discerning audience at The Grand with his collection inspired by the beats of the song Kajra re.

 The models paraded on the ramp to the Madhuri Dixit-made-famous Channe ke khet mein number, swirling their lehngas and the Mughal-e-Azam-look kameezes. The line, based on ladies sangeet, also comprised saris and short kurtas with Patialas. The Sabyasachi signature was visible in the subdued palette and prints, as well as the liberal use of layering. 

 While travelling sometime back, I was listening to Kajra re and the beat of the song hit me. I havent seen the movie and so the look of my collection is not inspired by Aishwarya Rais outfit in the Bunty Aur Babli number. Its the sounds of the song that evoked my interest in that particular kind of music. I started listening to qawalis, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khans tracks and Sufi music. The collection draws from all these, explained Sabyasachi. He added that his ensembles are not hardcore bridals, but meant for the sangeet function.

 Earlier on, the evening commenced with a stunning collection by another style stalwart ? Hemant Trevedi, participating for the first time in the event. The man best known for his work at Miss India pageants showcased on the Delhi ramp after a 15-year sabbatical. 

 A gamut of rich Indian colours, the traditional ornate wedding look with a modern touch, detailed workmanship and jewelled embellishments define one of the most opulent collections showcased at the bridal affair. I wanted to show the diverse possibilities of bridal wear. Ive used a wide palette as well as varied cuts so that there is something for every bride ? from the demure to the adventurous, said the designer. And true to his words, the gorgeous line offered the most traditional ghagras with cholis, as well as chic saris draped as skirts.

 Next on the ramp was an amalgam of ethnic wedding wear and western cuts by Bhairavi Jaikishen from Mumbai. Cocktail saris and trendy lehngas worked with heavy sequinned embroidery came in pastel hues of pink, nude, blue, lime green and yellow, as well as brighter reds, rosy pinks and gold.

 The penultimate show of the evening had a special model walking the ramp. Bare-dare actress Pooja Bedi donned a whole new avatar, as she walked the ramp draped in a red and gold sari teamed with a gold coin-embellished bustier by Priya Awasthy. 

 The goddess exists in every woman. Priyas collection with gold coins is a tribute to the Lakshmi in every woman, said Pooja, before opening the show. 

 The lehngas high on surface ornamentation ? sequins, beads, chikankari, kantha, zardosi and crystals ? were teamed with bustiers and cholis made of gold coins.

 The luxurious look on the ramp was in sync with the theme of the evening ? Royal Mirage. Red lanterns with white candles and roses in hues of burgundy and white created an Arabian aura, enhancing the opulent appeal.

 The fashion fiesta over with, its now time for the real action at the bridal fair, with a three-day exhibition at Taj Palace in Delhi between October 8 and 10.

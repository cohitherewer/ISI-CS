 Move afoot to keep Class I entry open

 - All-year admission plan to be put forward to private schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Suresh and Rima, a couple from Shyambazar, had a tough time before they could manage a seat in Class I of a private English-medium school in their locality for daughter Abhirupa, five-and-a-half years old.

 The child was supposed to join the school on April 2. But she refused on the very first day, and held her own in the face of all the persuasive powers of her parents. 

 And if the couple fail to coax the child to attend school even after the ongoing summer vacation, Abhirupa?s admission may stand cancelled. 

 The parents will have to wait for another year to get their child enrolled again, as normally, all schools close admission on the fifth month of the academic year.

 Abhirupa?s problem is not unique ? several children, along with their parents, face a similar ordeal in the initial days of their academic career. Some are forced to lose a year.

 The state government has come to the rescue of the harried parents: it is considering a move to keep admissions to Class I open all year.

 ?We have already made it compulsory for all state-aided primary schools to keep admissions open till October. We are now contemplating if the rule can be extended throughout the year,? said school education minister Kanti Biswas.

 Under the previous system ? followed for the past several years in state-aided schools ? students could enrol themselves till July in Classes I to X.

 The government is also considering requesting private schools ? including those affiliated to the state boards, as well as to the CBSE, ICSE and the ISC ? to switch to the new system.

 ?The issue of admissions to private schools is an internal matter and government rules do not allow any forced intervention regarding admission,? said a senior official of the school education department.

 ?But we are definitely keen to place our proposal before the 500-odd private schools in the city and will request them to accept it. We are sure they will not disappoint us,? the official added.

 A sumptuous spread of skewers, wraps and rolls is reason enough to head for a food festival at Pan Asian, the Oriental restaurant at ITC Sonar Bangla cooking up crispy bites to provide peppy options during the rains. The live fare, dished out by chefs Pramod and Francis, is on display at a crackling barbecue. 

 For skewers, one can choose from Dragon Fire (a blend of Indonesian and Chinese satays), Korean Skewers, Prawn Skewers and Honey Chicken Skewers that come with delicious sauces and spices. The wraps ? deep-fried envelopes ? can be found on the menu as Mushroom or Chicken Pouches, Kampsung (wanton basket with chicken or vegetables), Wothib (dimsums) or Money Bags (dumplings stuffed with veggies).

 The deep-fried rolls come with an assortment of fillings. The varieties here include Jade Rolls, Chinese Spring Rolls, Onion Pancakes and Hoisin Duck Rolls.

 On the desserts front, one can try the Crescent-shaped Dumplings, a three-layered wanton laid on a bed of caramel.

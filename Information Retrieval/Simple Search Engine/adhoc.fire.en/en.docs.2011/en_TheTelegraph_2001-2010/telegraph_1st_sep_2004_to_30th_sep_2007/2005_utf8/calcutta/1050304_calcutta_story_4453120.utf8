Notes from the margin

Kalighat bazaar was the unlikely venue chosen by two 

NGOs to showcase their success in spreading the wealth of words among marginalised 

youth

An unique evening of poetry, drama and dance was organised 

in front of Kalighat bazaar on Monday by The Daywalka Foundation, a US-based NGO, 

and Diksha, an organisation working with underprivileged youth. 

 Twelve adolescent members of Diksha read their poems on the evening as part of a programme called ?Kalam: Margins Write?. The poetry reading was followed by a play and dance performances. 

 The play was conceived and directed by the same group, which also choreographed the dance performances. 

 The evening was the culmination of 20 creative writing workshops organised by the NGO and Diksha over six months.

 While The Daywalka Foundation collaborates with local organisations in promoting human rights, Diksha, an acronym for ?discovering inner knowledge and sexual health awareness?, aims to create a safe space for adolescents and children to explore themselves and understand their rights.

 The performers came from diverse educational and occupational backgrounds, including domestic helps and shop assistants.

 ?Other people are always talking about these youths. But only they have the right to speak about their lives. We wanted to spread the culture of words among the adolescents so that they could say what they want about themselves,? said Sahar Romani, programme coordinator of The Daywalka Foundation.

 The programme was started with 15 youths, three of whom dropped out. But the overall response was encouraging enough for the foundation to spread the programme to members of three more organisations.

 ?Everyone discouraged us. We were told that these children would never be interested in poetry. Even the youths said that they did not write or read poetry. From that kind of a beginning to have 12 children stand up and say ?we are writers? is a success,? signed off Romani.

What?s on your mind this week

 Nobody?s 

baby

My first reaction after reading the report about the 

unwanted baby that was devoured by dogs was anger. In my mind, I said bad things 

to the ?70-year-old? man and the old lady who watched the baby being eaten by 

dogs from her window.

 Then I asked myself what would I have done had I been there? I am not old, but would I have acted?

 I came to the revolting conclusion that I would not have. I would have stood there petrified or probably ran away.

 I am ashamed of myself, but I am thankful that the circumstances made me learn something about myself.

 Now that I know my weakness, I will try to improve. May be, if I face such a situation in future, I will be able to muster courage and act.

 Happiness hour

Happiness grows at our own firesides,/And is not 

to be picked in stranger?s garden. 

 Douglas Jerrold 

 Nobody can define happiness. Different people find the essence of happiness in different things.

 Some think that money can buy all the happiness, but are proved wrong. Others find happiness in the company of people. Some among them seek happiness in the company of a particular person. They think love is the root of all happiness.

 The jury is still out on that. Given the rates of divorce, marriage, if not love, is often found to be the source of great misery.

 A pertinent question is how important is happiness in human life? Wouldn?t we become complacent and lazy if we were happy? Also, can one be happy in our country, where people are starving, fighting diseases, illiteracy and corruption? Perhaps, no. 

 I read that people living in Norway are the happiest because of the rate of growth of GDP and literacy coupled with low birth rate.

 Happiness eludes easy comprehension. It lies within us and yet, depends on our circumstances. 

 One thing is sure, for most of us, happiness is the ultimate goal.

 Study time

After the lovely Valentine?s week, it is the time 

to study, study and study. Board examinations are knocking at the door and it 

is high time for students to forget everything else and concentrate on studies.

 I wish all Madhyamik, ICSE, HS, ISC and CBSE examinees best of luck. Study hard and do well.

Fund waste

There is massive misuse of electricity in the government 

offices of Calcutta. Is there any need to install four air-conditioners in a minister?s 

office, when one is sufficient? It is even more surprising that officials are 

leaving no stone unturned to instal air-conditioners in their offices, even if 

they are not eligible to do that.

 Worse, they do not bother to switch off the cooling machines, fans and lights when they leave their offices for the day. The officials go to the extent of using heaters to make tea and cook food in offices.

 It is high time for the government to take up the issue of power wastage at government offices seriously and take prompt action against errant officials and ministers, especially when the state is not in a position to implement several development projects due to paucity of funds.

 A 

Tree

Please don?t hurt, 

Even though I am tall and strong, 

I?ve been people?s inspiration, and 

A part of many a song. 

I?ve been here for many years, 

Giving shelter to one and all, 

I am happy as I am, 

I don?t want to fall.

I give people oxygen, 

And prevent soil erosion, 

Cutting me down, 

Would be a terrible sin.

Leave me as I am,

Please don?t hurt me, 

For I am God sent,

I am a tree...

 The Rainbow

The rainbow is a memory, 

Of all the days gone by... 

It treasures legends of the past, 

Whose souls enchant the sky!

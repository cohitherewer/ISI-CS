 Nodal agency to tackle bird flu

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 The state animal husbandry department, along with its Central ministry, has set up a nodal agency in Salt Lake to monitor any possible outbreak of the orthomyxoviridae virus, commonly termed the bird flu virus.

 The agency will help provide information and training to officers of the forest department and zoological parks in 11 eastern and northeastern states in case of an outbreak, since most migratory birds come here in winter. 

 ?So far, not a single positive case of avian flu has been reported from our state. But, seven birds had died in a sanctuary in North Dinajpur early this week,? said S.K. Dasgupta, director of state animal husbandry department.

 ?We have tested the birds in our laboratory in Salt Lake but no virus was found. For more details on the cause of the birds? death, we have sent the carcasses to Central Testing Laboratory at Bhopal,? he added.

 To disseminate information on the disease, an 11-member team from the Union animal husbandry ministry, along with the Centre?s regional disease diagnostic laboratory, organised a training session for officers of the forest department and zoo authorities on Friday at Salt Lake. 

 ?Representatives from Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar, Assam, Mizoram, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar participated in the programme and they were briefed on tackling an emergency arising out of a flu case,? said Nita Chowdhury, joint secretary in the animal husbandry department.

 According to officers, there are only two ways by which the flu can spread here to poultry and humans. ?One is through infected poultry birds and other through the migratory birds. We are worried over the second mode of transmission,? said J.L. Chakrabarty, a senior research official of the department. 

 Bengal has 15 sanctuaries, 19 wetlands and five national parks, which a few thousand migratory birds visit at the onset of winter.

 Joint secretary Chowdhury said the chance of transmission through chicken is least possible as the government has already banned import of poultry and related products from flu-hit countries.

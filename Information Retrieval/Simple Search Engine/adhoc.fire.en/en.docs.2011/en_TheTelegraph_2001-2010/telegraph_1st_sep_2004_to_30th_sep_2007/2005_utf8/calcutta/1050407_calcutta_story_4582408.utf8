 Come monsoon, the landscape around the race course will undergo a change for the better, as the forest department and the army will undertake a massive tree-plantation drive on one of the most scenic stretches in the city. 

 A team, comprising representatives of the forest department and the army, inspected the race course and the Maidan to work out the programme details.

 But is the drive being planned under the shadow of a controversy a year ago, when hundreds of saplings planted on the Maidan were trampled by visitors to the Book Fair? 

 An army officer asserted: ?That incident has not dampened our spirits and we have decided to undertake a series of plantations this year. We have erected barbed wires in some pockets to protect the saplings.?

 The project at the race course is part of the state government?s drive to wrap the city in green by planting 100,000 saplings during the monsoon. 

 Following Tuesday?s inspection, the officials decided to plant at least 2,000 to 3,000 saplings along the race course periphery.

 An official of the forest department?s urban and recreational forestry wing said around 2,000 trees would be planted on the race course grounds and a few hundred on the outer periphery, off the Maidan. 

 Stretches along Pranabananda Sarani, the tents and clubs on the Maidan and the outer edge of the Shahid Minar grounds will be brought within the scheme. 

 The drive will also extend to the vacant land on the approach to Vidyasagar Setu.

 ?We have decided to plant medium-sized ornamental and flowering trees on the race course periphery, as they take comparatively less time to grow. For the inner circle, surrounded by racing tracks, we have chosen medium-sized shrubs, measuring around five feet. This area is now almost overrun by weeds and tall grass,? the official told Metro.

 By 2007, officials promise, tall trees will border the racing grounds.

 The trees shortlisted by the forest department for the drive include drooping deodar, spathodia, amaltash and bakul. ?Another barren patch, measuring five acres, has been identified near Prinsep Ghat, where a good number of trees can be planted,? the official added.

 Commenting on the role of the forest department in the drive, an official said: ?We will extend technical support and also provide the army with saplings.? 

 The department has also decided to plant another 250 saplings in the Fort William stadium.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Destination for a facelift

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta is fast emerging as a healthcare provider of international standards, and fuelling the boom are the quality, yet cheap, cosmetic surgeries performed here. People flocking to the city?s cosmetic surgery clinics are from as far away as Auckland, London, Johannesburg and Durban. 

 Michael Ellis, a New Zealander, is one such patient who has just undergone a series of cosmetic surgical procedures at a clinic on Loudon Street. 

 He is all praise for the arrangement: ?I am mighty pleased with what I have seen. The quality of healthcare is definitely very good and the techniques are excellent.?

 He had read about the clinic on the Net and contacted the management for a hair transplant, facelift and a rhinoplasty. ?We have completed the procedures and he will fly back soon,? plastic surgeon Manoj Khanna told Metro. 

 The 52-year-old developer from Auckland had even taken time off for Diwali shopping.

 The procedures most foreigners ? around 50 of them come down to the city every month for the purpose ? are interested in are facelifts, breast enlargements, liposuction, hair transplants and rhinoplasties.

 One reason for the foreigners making a beeline to city clinics is cost: a surgery is 70-80 per cent cheaper here, even after factoring in travel and hotel expenses. A procedure that costs around $20,000 in the US or other advanced countries can be performed here, without compromising on quality, for just $4,000-$8,000.

 ?Cosmetic surgeries are very expensive in the West, as they are not covered by insurance companies,? said plastic surgeon Anupam Golash.

 Just a few weeks ago, Bryan Adams, a Londoner, had flown to the city for a facelift. 

 Trish Robinson, a resident of Johannesburg, had heard about the city?s healthcare and planned to check out face-tightening and liposuction procedures performed here. 

 Satisfied with what she saw, Robinson, 46, went through them a week ago. ?It was great to be here and I would love to come back,? she said, before leaving for London to meet her son.

 Geena Andrews is 69, but that has not sapped her zeal to be shipshape. ?Apart from a facelift, she underwent breast enlargement,? added Khanna.

 Charles Williamson (of London) and Alex Rashen (of Durban) said they had saved up to 80 per cent by opting for surgeries here. 

 ?The trend is picking up and the city is poised to become a major destination for medical tourists,? said Sajal Dutta, president of Association of Hospitals of Eastern India.

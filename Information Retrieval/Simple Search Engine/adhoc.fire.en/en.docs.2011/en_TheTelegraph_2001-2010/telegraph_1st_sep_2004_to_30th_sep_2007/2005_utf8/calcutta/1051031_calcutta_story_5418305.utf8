 Roadhog promoters bane of motorists 

 Sandip Banerjee: Most roads in ward 67 are narrow. The promoters make them narrower by dumping construction material on the sides, causing much harassment and inconvenience to the motorists.

 It is illegal to keep construction material on the road. I have already asked some promoters to store the material on the ground floor of the buildings under construction. The civic conservancy department sometimes impounds building material stored on roads.

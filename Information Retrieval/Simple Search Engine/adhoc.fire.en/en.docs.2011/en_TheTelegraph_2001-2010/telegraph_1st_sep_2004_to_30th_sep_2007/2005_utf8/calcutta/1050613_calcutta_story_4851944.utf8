 Its time to ditch your diet. Atriums lunch buffet is a bargain worth bingeing on.

 The coffee shop of The Park is laying out a range of popular and exclusive Continental dishes every day for lunch.

 We wanted to treat Calcuttans to some French and other European dishes, says executive chef Yvonnick Jegat Deniau. The Frenchman is the latest name on the five-stars list of culinary experts.

 Sample everything from Italian pasta to Smoked Salmon and Broccoli Salad, or French Potato au Gratin and Blanquette of Bekti.

 The buffet is priced at a reasonable Rs 499, all inclusive. Start with a variety of salads and soup, move on to the main course, featuring some Indian regional dishes as well, and end it with a sinful spread of desserts dished out by chef Shaun Kenworthy.

 We have also included an option of a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, a juice or a cold drink with the meal, adds Anirban Simlai, director, food and beverage. On Sundays, there is great news for tipplers, as the drink quota is unlimited. 

 If you are looking for a lighter bite or if your sweet tooth asserts itself, there are all-day options on offer. A soup-and-salad buffet priced at Rs 299 and a dessert-and-coffee buffet at Rs 199 are available from 11 am till midnight.

 Tuck in

 Down the street from The Park, Marco Polo in China has also started an extensive afternoon buffet, designed for the business executives of the locality.

 The afternoon buffet is an elaborate spread aimed at providing variety to frequent customers. We are targeting the business executive, with a large number of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, says Tapash Sengupta, manager, Marco Polo in China.

 The soups include Tom Yum Soup, Sweet Corn Soup, Vegetarian Coriander Soup and Chicken Coriander Soup. For starters, Vegetarian Suimai, Chicken Suimai, Dry Chilli Chicken, Spring Chicken, Cheese and Spinach Roll and Mushroom Pepper Salt are some of the alternatives. Moving on to the main course, sample Vegetarian Coins in a number of different sauces, Tofu in Black Bean Sauce, Chinese Greens, Chilli Crab, Prawn in Oyster Sauce and Hunan Chicken.

 The spread comes for Rs 250, and is available from 12.30 pm to 3 pm.

 Retro remix

 Bulla ki jaana followed by Bin tere sanam, Oye oye after Yaar bina chain kahan re. Party-hoppers at Red Kitchen and Lounge in Alipore were treated to a swinging mix of songs through the decades on Saturday night.

 DJ Kiran started belting out one hit number after the other as the crowd started trickling into the lounge bar post-dinner to hear the 2002 War of the DJs winner and the holder of Mumbais Swing Master 2003 title.

 There is nothing as exciting as making people dance to your tune. That is the reason I decided to become a DJ, he explained.

 In Mumbai, DJ Aqeel has been of great help. I will be remixing a song for the new label he is launching, said Kiran, changing tracks at the console. DJ Kiran is the resident DJ at Athena, a party hotspot in Mumbai.

 New kid

 Avenue 84 is the newest eating-out option in south Calcutta. Located on the bustling Rashbehari Avenue, the stylish interiors and the cool environs are a total contrast to the location of this multi-cuisine restaurant.

 People of this locality were deprived of a decent eatery serving good food. They had to travel a long distance to other parts of the city. So I thought opening a restaurant here would be a good idea, said owner Sanjib Poddar at the June 10 opening.

 The 90-cover restaurant serves Indian and Chinese cuisine. The menu is a good mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.

 The Indian section includes Paneer Irani, Dahi Kebab, Babri Aloo, Chicken Reshmi, Chicken Tikka, Mutton Rogan Josh and Palak Gosht.

 The Chinese spread includes Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken, Gold Fried Prawn, Chicken Gold Coin, Shanghai Mixed Vegetables and Manchurian Paneer.

 Prices are between Rs 35 and Rs 260.

 Cotton corner

 If you want to lay your hands on some cool fabric at economical prices, check out Materials at 82A Shambhunath Pandit Street, which is selling cotton dress material at throwaway rates.

 The 100-per cent-cotton range is between Rs 50 and Rs 250 per metre. We have our own cotton mill in Maharashtra. We supply cotton fabric to designers and shops at markets and malls through the city who sell the finished products at 10 times the actual rates, says Yashwant Kanoria, owner of Materials.

 So, the companys standalone store keeps margins down and stocks mouse cotton, handloom linen, flex cotton, jute cotton jacquards and tapsa cotton in floral and abstract patterns, stripes and self designs.

 Bday bonanza

 RJ hunt, talent search, free tickets, cookery classes? Its celebration time at INOX City Centre from Monday.

 The multiplex just turned a year old and is all set to keep the Salt Lake mall abuzz with activity.

 The fun fiesta includes a hunt for the perfect radio voice, being conducted by Red FM, which kicked off on Sunday evening. For kids between the ages of five and 14 years, painting, dance and music contests are on at the venue for the next four days.

 A special cookery session will also be conducted by chef Shaun Kenworthy on June 14.

 Garden of Eden still out of bounds

 - STATE WILL WAIT FOR DEFENCE MINISTRY NOD

 The Burmese Pagoda at the Eden Gardens: Quite a draw. A Telegraph picture

 Elliot Park is fine. So is Victoria Memorial or the brand new Citizen?s Park, opposite Rabindra Sadan. However, if you are planning a trip to the garden of Eden, think again.

 Months since the gates were closed, there is still no hope of the park reopening to the public.

 In response to an army proposal that the gates of the Eden Gardens be kept open till the dispute regarding entry fees is resolved, the forest department has said it will wait for the defence ministry?s nod before deciding on the contentious issue.

 The impasse dates back to April, when the army objected to the state government?s decision to impose an entry fee of Rs 2 on visitors to the park. While the state maintained that the money would be spent on maintenance, the army claimed that collecting entry fees would amount to engaging in commercial activities, which is prohibited in the Blue Zone (maintained by the armed forces).

 ?It has been quite some time that the gates have been closed. I have requested the authorities to keep the park open for the public till the dispute is resolved,? said Major-General Z.U. Shah, GOC, Bengal area.

 But the forest department is not ready to accept the officer?s argument. Peeved over the army?s opposition to an entry fee, senior officials of the department are wondering how to maintain the park without any financial support.

 ?You need to have a steady flow of funds for regular maintenance of a park. If Elliot Park can charge an entry fee, why can?t we?? asked an official.

 Following the army?s statement that it cannot allow an entry fee for Eden Gardens, the state government has written to the defence ministry for its opinion.

 ?How can we throw open the gates before the ministry conveys its stand to us? We will have to wait for the ministry?s response before deciding on the issue,? said R.K. Tripathy, principal secretary in the forest department.

 Elaborating on how the park has been transformed from a sprawling patch of unkempt green to a centre of attraction, the state has argued that it had not indulged in any profit-making business by introducing the entry fee.

 ?The park presently houses two rose gardens, three nurseries, a cactus house, a lake for boating, a children?s enclosure, a bandstand and, of course, the Burmese pagoda, which has been here since 1854,? said Somenath Mukherjee, deputy conservator in the forest department?s urban and recreational forestry division.

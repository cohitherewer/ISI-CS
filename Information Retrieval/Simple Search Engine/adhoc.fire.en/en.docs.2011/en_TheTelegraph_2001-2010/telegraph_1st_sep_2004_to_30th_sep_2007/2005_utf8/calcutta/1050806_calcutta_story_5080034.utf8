 Diamond gives away girl 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Sonam Parveen is a shopaholic who would not touch anything but the best. But the 20-year-old is also a shoplifter. Her luck ran out on Thursday night, when she was arrested for trying to steal a diamond ring from a jewellery shop on Park Street.

 While police are yet to give the lowdown on her, preliminary inquiries reveal that Sonam ? alias Nisha Begum ? had lifted several gold ornaments from jewellery shops in the past, posing as a customer. 

 It?s just that on every earlier occasion, she had managed to get away with it. 

 ?In the past few months, there has been a string of thefts in jewellery shops across Park Street, Camac Street and Loudon Street, leaving the cops stumped. We tried our best but there was no way we could detect the thief. It now appears that this girl had a role. It?s too early, but we will grill her to find out more about her previous thefts,? said N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 On Thursday evening, Sonam walked into a jewellery shop on Park Street looking for gold ornaments. The moment she walked in, the staff identified her as the woman who had lifted a gold necklace in March. 

 Despite the CCTV grabs, there was no way they could challenge Sonam, even though they knew for sure she had stolen an ornament. But the staff remembered her face. 

 ?The moment she lifted a diamond ring and decided to walk out, they challenged her,? said Gana Nath Mukherjee, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station. Initially, she put on a brave front but when the staff persisted, she admitted to her crime.

 A resident of Sheriff Lane, off Park Street, Sonam is married to a broker dealing in raw leather. While relatives claim she is mentally unstable, police refuse to buy that story.

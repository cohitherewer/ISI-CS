 ?Between me and the smallest animal the difference is only in manifestation. As a principle he is the same as I am and he is my brother? ? Swami Vivekananda.

 Cattle: Animals on the streets of India are a sorry sight. One spots emaciated cows and bulls on the streets searching for food, most of them left to wander by dairy owners. Because there are no grazing grounds in the city, cattle wander into marketplaces looking for edibles and get chased out. When you see cows with burn marks, usually on their rumps, near a fruit or vegetable market, it is quite probable that the vegetable sellers have thrown acid to drive them away.

 In the rains the cattle have to make do with torn sacks on their backs and finally when they get old they are abandoned on the streets or loaded on to trucks without ramps and taken to slaughterhouses.

 There are as many as 40,000 cows wandering the streets of Delhi. Since they are a growing problem on the streets and pose a traffic hazard, Delhi High Court has ordered South Delhi authorities to pay Rs 2,000 to anyone delivering a stray cow to them.

 The captured cows would be taken to a cow shelter and the authorities would raise the reward money by auctioning the animals. No sooner was the news of the reward out that pictures of stick-wielding men herding cows and bulls on the streets of Delhi were splashed across our television screens and newspapers. Miserable, the state of these animals and pathetic, the attempt on part of these officials to get stray cattle off the streets!

 Donkeys: It was the month of May. I was in school then in Mumbai. There was a dhobi ghaat nearby where various atrocities were committed on donkeys. Very often I saw donkeys break down totally exhausted under the load of clothes and the heat. The dhobis used them as carriers to the washing place. Sometimes, they would ride on them. They were left to wander as the dhobis washed clothes. To prevent stealing, they branded (with hot iron tongs) the donkeys with names. Not to forget the street urchins who harassed the animals and beat them up. During Diwali, people often threw firecrackers at the donkeys and the poor animals would go berserk. And when these animals grew old, they were left to live off the garbage on the streets.

 Dogs: There are still so many people who mistreat dogs ? throw stones at them or feed them poisoned meat.

 What you can do: The plight of these animals doesn?t vex anyone very much. But I am sure there are some people who care about abandoned, stray and ill-treated animals.

 For those people, whenever you see an animal being hit or stoned, be sure to inform the law enforcers. Should they persist, register an FIR against them at the closest police station. Do not be discouraged if the police do not, at first, take you seriously. In most cases they do not know the animal protection laws. You will be doing a dual service ? punishing cruelty to a helpless animal, as well as educating police on animal protection laws.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Two passenger sheds near the Parama island, on EM Bypass, have been constructed 

by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation ? one with good lighting which passengers 

don?t use and where buses don?t stop and the other used only during the day by 

passengers waiting for Basanti-bound buses. The rest of the passengers do not 

use a shed at all. They crowd on the road itself, inviting vehicles to ram into 

them. Also, there are no public toilets in the vicinity and no seating arrangements 

at the sheds for senior citizens and the physically challenged. Nor is a public 

telephone booth anywhere in sight. It is high time that these amenities be provided 

at this busy junction.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd is not being able to provide connectivity to CellOne postpaid and prepaid users inside Metro Railway stations. While there is no such problem with Hutch and Airtel connections even underground, why should CellOne suffer such loss of connectivity? The government should conduct an inquiry into the matter.

 During a recent visit to Millennium Park I was shocked to see the circular 

railway track, running parallel to the park, in a pitiable condition. It is full 

of weeds and overgrown bushes that spoil the beauty of the sylvan surroundings. 

Also, the footpath is dimly-lit and uneven, causing much inconvenience to visitors.

 On March 11, I attended the hearing of a dacoity case at a city court. It seemed 

that all the accused were non-Bengalis and were not conversant with the local 

language. As a result, they were not being able to comprehend when the honourable 

judge stated the charges against them. Would it be right if an innocent person 

misinterprets the charges read out to him in an alien language and pleads guilty?

 The Bangur Avenue-Dum Dum Park area has been dug up for quite some time now. 

A portion of the bridge over the canal has also been dug up and is always occupied 

by vehicles of the construction company. The students of nearby colleges and schools 

suffer the most because of the bad condition of the roads.

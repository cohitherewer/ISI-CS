 Collaged choreography

 Performing arts have a special social responsibility in forging harmony among different cultures and people through the spontaneous expression of thoughts and emotions. Represented in an attractive manner, they convey their missive effectively without appearing to be didactic or moralistic. Presented by choreographer Sukalyan Bhattacharya and his entourage, Nritya Malika, the dance collage, reaches out to the heart with its theme of peace, universal brotherhood and love. Based on Indian classical, semi-classical and contemporary dance styles, the fusion of forms serves as a structural metaphor for the essential oneness of humankind. Choreographed in Bhattacharya?s signature style, the compositions combine the power and energy of Indian classical dances with the vigorous, dynamic movements of contemporary forms to provide a delightful visual treat to the aesthetically inclined. Direction: Sukalyan Bhattacharya and Arnab Bandyopadhyay.

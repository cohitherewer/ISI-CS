 Cable call to talks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the muddle, yet another meeting to untangle the cable mess. With the state government?s ?cable census? failing to take off, broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSOs) have been summoned on Thursday by principal secretary to the chief minister, Arun Bhattacharya, to plan the way ahead.

 ?It?s just a follow-up to the survey we are conducting,? was all that Bhattacharya would say, ?till we actually sit for the meeting?.

 According to sources, while the progress of the cable census will be reviewed at the meeting, the state may also look at implementing an addressable system, like conditional access system (CAS), on its own.

 This is in light of the growing discord among broadcasters and MSOs regarding the ?second bouquet? of channels. 

 Broadcasters usually group their channels in two bouquets ? popular and niche channels. 

 Trai had directed earlier this year that channels debuting after January 1, 2005, be dealt with separately from the existing bouquet of channels. Broadcasters then started including the new channels in their second bouquet.

 The government may propose that the second bouquet be transmitted through a set-top box as a value-add.

 Titillation talkathon

 Churni Ganguly and Koushik Sen on the sets of Shunya e Buke

 The teaser campaign of an upcoming Bengali film ? popping out of alleys, bus stands, road dividers and buildings ? had obviously caught my eye. One could only read between the line, Bhora buk na bukbhora bhalobasha, and wonder what it meant. So, when a friend asked me to accompany her to an open session on the issue, I readily agreed.

 The session, it turned out, was a promotional ploy for Kaushik Ganguly?s Shunya e Buke, for which the principal cast of Koushik Sen, Churni Ganguly and Tota Roy Chowdhury had gathered at the table. Also on the panel were singer Shilajeet, journalist Ranjan Bandopadhyay and writer Taslima Nasreen.

 The film is supposedly a sensitive portrayal of male fantasy and female identity revolving around the discovery by the protagonist on his wedding night that his beloved is flat-chested.

 The talk was meant to be a meaningful debate on love and lust. The talk turned out to be, at best, cheap titillation and at worse, deeply offensive. Some of the speakers seemed to take it as an excuse to gloat over ?rounded female breasts?. One of them even went to the extent of narrating personal sexual encounters, ostensibly to flesh out his argument on the subject.

 I guess, if I protest what was a pathetic parody of a potential intellectual debate, I will be labelled a prude. But then, so be it.

 The first speaker Ranjan Bandopadhyay started off by zeroing in on the Bengali man?s alleged diffidence to admit a fascination for the well-endowed woman. As the audience (including women from 16 to 60) alternately cringed and giggled, he latched on to literature for legitimacy. 

 And who better to bust a myth than Rabindranath Tagore? Quoting Victoria Ocampo where the lady discusses how the poet had reacted to her leaning over him, Bandopadhyay rammed home his point.

 ?All men fantasise about well-rounded breasts, as these are symbolic of a woman?s beauty. So, long live the breast,? declared Bandopadhyay.

 But sir, do we need all that titillating talk to prove a point? Leave alone what the writers had to say, wouldn?t you have rather talked about whether one physical attribute is the only parameter by which a woman must be judged even today?

 The worst was yet to come. Jagannath Guha, a TV personality of considerable repute, took the microphone, not to lend any sensitivity to the topic on the table but to embark on a graphic recreation of his encounter with a prostitute, interspersed with Bengali gutterspeak. ?But the prostitute refused to let me touch her nipple and she should be applauded for that,? he concluded.

 If Guha was disgusting, Taslima Nasreen was disappointing. Forget about intervening when the discussion took such a vulgar turn, the controversial author went on about how ?men have always exploited women for pleasure with love hardly mattering?. 

 Couldn?t Kaushik Ganguly and company find any other route to get their message across? Couldn?t they have been bold without being offensive, vocal without being vulgar?

 Or, do we just get what we deserve as no one raises a voice?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Smasher called Padukone

 She was touted as one of the hottest ramp walkers at the recently-held India Fashion Week. Her latest ad campaign for Limca has been creating waves on the small screen. And her face has been quite a hit in print ads of late.

 Deepika Padukone, daughter of former badminton champion Prakash Padukone, has already achieved a feat that very few Indian models have managed so far. The versatile lady has proved her expertise in all three fields of modelling, each of which comes with its own specific requirements.

 ?I?ve got the height that?s required for ramp modelling and my face has got that fresh feel that print and television ads look for. That?s what I think gives me the versatility in modelling,? smiles Deepika, in Calcutta earlier this week to inaugurate a jewellery exhibition by PC Chandra called Swarna Mrigaya.

 The svelte beauty has been in the circuit for just a year and she?s already busy with a host of shows and ad campaigns, including one for a footwear brand in Singapore. But her sights are set firmly on Bollywood, and it?s just a matter of time before she takes the plunge into filmdom. 

 ?I?m not ready as an actress right now, though good offers have been coming my way. I don?t want to get into movies yet and just look good on screen. I have to be fully prepared with my acting skills first,? says Deepika. And the preparation includes a three-month course in acting in Mumbai that she?s currently undergoing.

 ?I hope to be ready next year and after that I will await the right role. Till then, I?ll concentrate on modelling.?

 While the Bangalore babe has always been attracted to the glamour world, she has dabbled in her father?s forte, too. A state-level badminton player while in school, Deepika quit the sport just before her Board exams, after which the world of modelling won game, set and match.

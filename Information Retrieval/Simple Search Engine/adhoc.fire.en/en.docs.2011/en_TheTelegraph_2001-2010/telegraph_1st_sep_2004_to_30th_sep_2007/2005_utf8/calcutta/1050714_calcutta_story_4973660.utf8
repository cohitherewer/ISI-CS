The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hooghly and a bit of MIT 

For river, a bit of urban branding

 - US institute eyes studio to activate the waterfront, help Calcutta celebrate its river

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is keen to come to our waterfront. Not to set up classrooms, but to conduct a studio.

 After steering the revitalisation of the waterfront in Washington DC, the premier institute is keen to play the role of catalyst in creating ?a riverfront vista of a new Calcutta which not only respects its colonial past, but also takes off in a new direction to deliver a destination?.

 Faculty and students at MIT?s School of Architecture and Planning have discussed the possibility of doing a studio by the Hooghly as part of the Joint Program in City Design and Development (CDD).

 An accord between the departments of urban studies amp; planning and architecture at MIT, the joint programme focuses on ?interpreting and shaping built and natural environment? of cities and regions.

 ?We need to activate the waterfront and celebrate our river. We can do that only by creating mixed-use development with day-night impact,? says architect-planner Ayan Sen, an MIT grad who has worked on both the Washington DC and Pittsburgh waterfront projects.

 The ?envoy of MIT? feels Calcutta can draw significantly from the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative in Washington DC, where he was part of the CDD students? team assisting senior faculty members Julian Beinart, John de Monchaux, Eran Ben-Joseph and Charles Correa.

 ?Last summer, I discussed the possibilities of doing a studio by the river here with Biswapriya Sanyal, dean, department of urban studies amp; planning, MIT, and he was extremely keen, as was Charles (Correa) himself,? says Sen.

 Correa, who has been vocal about the need to tap the potential of Calcutta?s riverfront, is already acting as an adviser to the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s initiative to foster integrated development on both banks involving all stakeholders, with architect Partha Ranjan Das as local pivot.

 And now, MIT wants to home in on the Hooghly.

 ?MIT has vast experience in waterfront projects and we can use the critical inputs. But the context in a developing country is very different and we must guard against anything too lavish to sustain,? says Das.

 CDD studios and workshops investigate city design issues in a dynamic setting. Tackling growth pressures in Cambridge, preservation and development alternatives for the ancient neighbourhood near Beijing?s famous Summer Palace and conserving the traditional building styles of Thimpu are some of the notable CDD studio projects.

 The essence of the guidelines 

 for a Calcutta studio that emerged through brainstorming 

 sessions at MIT is a combination of public institutions 

 to celebrate the city?s heritage and synergies created through 

 contemporary inputs.

 The MIT planning project that could serve as a close reference point for the Hooghly riverbank is ?the DC waterfront studio?, feels Sen, back in town to practice post-MIT. 

 ?Calcutta can derive urban branding from its river, just like Washington did,? says the 32-year-old.

 CDD students have developed comprehensive plans for new infrastructure, housing, educational, recreational and waterfront development to revitalise the area and bring it back into the mainstream of city life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ban hurts right to protest

 PANKAJ BANERJEE, general secretary of the Trinamul Congress, met the readers of The Telegraph at his office on Thursday to answer their queries. 

Participants included Atmaram Saraogi, Sandip Banerjee, Dipali Das, Sabita Biswas, Sukanta Hazra, S.S. Dey and Bimal Bhattacharya

Sukanta Hazra: There are often complaints that 

your party behaves irresponsibly while tackling important political issues.

We are open to criticism and we learn from it. But 

it is not true that we behave in an irresponsible manner while tackling public 

or political issues. When you put up any kind of resistance it is going to ruffle 

a few feathers. When we go against the wishes of an influential section of society, 

our protest is branded as irresponsible. We are ready to be slapped with such 

labels as long as it serves the interest of the common people.

Sandip Banerjee: You differ with the CPM on every 

issue, but how could you join hands with them in the all-party meet to evolve 

a consensus on calling bandhs?

Calling a bandh is a fundamental issue that needs 

to be tackled in an organised manner by all like-minded political parties. It 

has to be kept in mind that the ban on bandhs was effected by the judiciary rather 

than the government.

 We feel the ban is going to hurt our political and democratic right to protest oppression. When all other parties, including the CPM, felt the same, they called us. Since we, too, were thinking along the same lines, we joined them at the all-party meeting.

 This does not in any way imply that we have joined hands with the CPM.

Sabita Biswas: My son died mysteriously inside 

the RG Kar Medical College hostel three years ago. He was a fourth-year student 

then. The administration is not being serious in dealing with the case. Though 

pending for two years, the case has not come up for hearing at Calcutta High Court. 

We are aware of the case and have raised the issue 

many times in the Assembly. When the incident occurred, a section of the media 

had reported that it might be a case of murder. We had demanded an inquiry and 

even asked the chief minister to issue a statement. I had spoken with the law 

minister, too.

 It seems the government is trying to hush up the case. However, I will see to it that the government does not get away so easily. As far as the court?s hearing is concerned, I cannot comment on it. 

Atmaram Saraogi: What reasons can you give for 

calling a bandh on December 3 when other political parties had called two bandhs 

on the same issue. Have you managed to achieve anything by observing the bandh?

We had called the bandh on an issue that affected 

the common people: the rise in the prices of petroleum products. People often 

criticise us for calling bandhs, but they never fail to reap the benefits.

 Everyone should have protested the price hike by taking to the streets. The Centre would then have understood that the common people were not in favour of the hike. Strangely, it became the sole responsibility of the Opposition parties to take up the issue.

 Can you please tell us what pleasure our activists get by being beaten up by police while leading rallies? It has become the norm to criticise such incidents of protest over a cup of tea or coffee. 

 But we won?t be deterred by such criticism. We felt the decision of the central government to hike the price of petroleum products was not correct, so we raised our voice in protest. We will repeat such actions if the situation compels us to do so.

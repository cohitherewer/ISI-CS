 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five youths lodged separate complaints between July 20 and August 13 with Rajarhat police station against Dipankar Shome, who allegedly duped them of over Rs 7 lakh. 

 The accused and his wife, who lived in Teghoria, are absconding.

 The complainants ? residents of Rajarhat and Baguiati ? alleged that Shome had introduced himself as a senior sales manager of a leading hatchery in the city and promised them jobs in his firm and a reputed city hotel.

 In return, he asked them for huge sums of money. The youths obliged and paid him a few lakhs.

 ?He made us pay his mobile phone bills and also used our parents? credit cards. We did not mind, as we believed him and also because he promised us good jobs. But on learning the amount he transacted through the cards, we realised he was a fraud,? said Amitava Sengupta, one of the complainants.

 Rajib Sarkar, another victim, alleged that Shome was threatening him on the phone with dire consequences. 

 Officer-in-charge of Baguiati police outpost Gautam Mitra said on Sunday: ?We have started a case. We are trying to trace Shome.? 

 Police said Shome worked in the hatchery, where he promised to recruit the youths, till December. He was suspended for allegedly misappropriating funds.

 Want to see the blueprint, 20 times over

film

 In true Hollywood tradition of actors playing actors, Martin Scorsese?s The Aviator features a who?s who of modern Hollywood playing a who?s who of classic Hollywood. Leonardo DiCaprio is the legendary Howard Hughes, Cate Blanchett is Katherine Hepburn, Gwen Stefani is Jean Harlow and Kate Beckinsale is Ava Gardner. 

 Leonardo DiCaprio had to bring his own sense to the portrayal of Hughes, since there were few definite research materials available. ?As an actor, you?re constantly searching for that great character,? DiCaprio said. ?I came across a book of Howard Hughes and he was set up basically as the most multi-dimensional character I could ever come across. He was one of the most complicated men of the last century. And so I got this book, brought it to (producer) Michael Mann and (writer) John Logan came on board and really came up with the concept of saying, ?You can do 10 different movies about Howard Hughes. Let?s focus on his younger years. [He was] the first American billionaire who had all the resources in the world but was somehow unable to find any sense of peace or happiness.? It?s that great see-saw act in the movie that goes on. On one side, he?s having all the successes in the world and on the other side the tiny microbes and germs are the things that are taking him downwards because of his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and being a germaphobe.? 

 In-depth research involved not only studying books and interviewing those who knew Hughes, but going into the psychology community as well. ?The real research began after we committed to the movie, Marty (Scorsese) and I. It was a year of preparation. I got to meet a couple of people who actually worked with Howard, who knew Howard. When you read a script and you read two pages of a man repeating the same line over and over again, you say, ?How in the hell am I gonna say this? What is the driving force behind repeating something (?I want to see the blueprint?) 20 times in a row and why the hell is he doing it?? 

 So that brought me to work with Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz of UCLA who is the leading physician on OCD. He really explained to me what OCD is, the brain mechanism that goes into it and the sticky gear shift that happens when your mind obsesses on one thing and you don?t listen to the other part of your brain that tells you you?re being ridiculous.? 

 Kate Beckinsale was not only interested in Ava Gardner, but all of the talent involved in telling the Howard Hughes story. ?I didn?t hear about Ava Gardner without Marty and Leo already being attached to it,? Beckinsale said. ?But she had a very unique spirit and I really found that appealing. She was a very feisty, fiery, warm, deeply feminine tough person.? 

 Since Gardner was in front of the camera much more than Hughes, Beckinsale had a lot to draw from. ?Marty was very categorical about the fact that he didnt want us in prosthetic chins and fake eyeballs. He didn?t want a Saturday Night Live skit of Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. The most important thing really to capture was the spirit and that?s what we were all aiming to do.?

 Having directed several biographies, from Raging Bull and Goodfellas to Casino and Kundun, Martin Scorsese realised that each person?s life needs a different approach. ?It?s very different for each one, and I must say now that the approach on this material really, really comes from John Logan, the writer,? Scorsese said. ?Why I say that is that I?ve approached biographical material over the years. We hit it one way with Raging Bull. And then Henry Hill in Goodfellas. 

 ?What I liked about this particular version was that I had stayed clear of the Howard Hughes story for two reasons. One, I was interested in the sense that I only knew him as an eccentric guy living at the top of the Desert Inn, a very mysterious figure, watching movies in the middle of the night. I had not really understood what the aviators were doing in the 20s and 30s. But I also knew that major Hollywood film-makers like Warren Beatty and Stephen Spielberg had wanted for many years to make a Hughes picture.

?And they said, ?He did all this and then he was building the Hercules, and then he started to lose his mind. He was involved with Watergate.? This was a great mysterious figure like an ancient king from Greece. And I thought, ?Well, where do you start and where do you end?? I wouldn?t know where to begin. And so I thought it was more or less their territory until I read the script by John Logan. They didn?t tell me what it was, they just gave me the script.? 

 DiCaprio was already attached when Scorsese got the script, but in choosing Hughes? leading ladies, he said, ?I thought of Cate, we were starting to shoot our film sooner and she was on The Missing for Ron Howard. But ultimately things worked out beautifully. We just had one meeting for like three hours talking about it. 

 ?She had looked at some stills of Katharine Hepburn. Katharine Hepburn is a touchy area. There are three levels there. The older people who really know Katharine Hepburn, who may have been alive in the 1930s. There?s the mid-range, which is me. I?m 62 but I was 10 years old when I saw her movies. Then there?s the other element which may be many people who don?t know who she is at all. And because of that, I felt yes, let us try to do Katharine Hepburn in a film. Cate had the gesture, the body lines, the look of Katharine Hepburn. It was a matter of really working ultimately on the level of accent.

 ?Kate Beckinsale came in and was the first to audition for Ava Gardner,? Scorsese continued. ?I thought she was terrific. She asked what she should do before the audition, and I told her to just watch Mogambo, John Ford?s version of Red Dust with Clark Gable and Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner playing Honey Bear. Because I thought the attitude of Ava Gardner in that film was all she really had to know. All she had to know was that swagger, that wise-guy attitude, like a guy in a way.

 ?Gwen Stefani is just literally Jean Harlow. I would have liked Gwen to be in the film more. I would have liked Jean Harlow to be more of a character. But again, that?s what?s so interesting about the script. Logan only showed you certain things and it?s what?s not there that has the resonance in the scenes that are there.? 

 DiCaprio reflected on his leading ladies. ?My two Kates,? he called them. ?Well, for the Katharine Hepburn character there was really only one person that could play that role in the world. There is the female version of Daniel Day-Lewis, and that is Cate Blanchett. To be able to take on the persona and one of the most iconic female voices of the 20th Century, in Katharine Hepburn, and being from Australia as well. Taking on that, you have to be a true chameleon and genius. 

 ?As soon as Kate Beckinsale stepped into the meeting with us we knew we had our Ava. She represented the class, had the strength, had the attitude, and it was a joy to work with both of them.? 

 For Beckinsale, playing a real person is almost an unwinnable enterprise. ?It?s always unnerving because I think there will be inevitably a certain percentage of people who will be just offended by the fact that you?ve been cast at all and you don?t evoke her in their heart as maybe somebody else might,? she said. ?You?re the authority on the character?s emotional life and when it?s a real person, there is actually a blueprint that you?re trying to hit without being able to actually speak to the person if they?ve passed away. At some point you have to approach it in a sort of open-hearted creative actress playing a part.?

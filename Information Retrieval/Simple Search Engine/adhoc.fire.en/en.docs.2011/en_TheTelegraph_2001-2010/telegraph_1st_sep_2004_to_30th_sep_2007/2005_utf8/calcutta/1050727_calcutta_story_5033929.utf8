 Harry Potter finally has competition ? not from the Dark Lord, but from a spinning top! It?s called the Beyblade and it?s the favourite toy for boys to have fun with, at home or in school.

 Inspired by the animation series on Cartoon Network featuring four boys who come together and form the Blade Breakers, the customised top has launchers that set the Beyblades in motion and knock opponents down.

 The top of the toy is like a space shuttle and ganging up for battle at the stadium (a plastic tray with an uneven surface) is keeping hundreds of boys busy these days. The cost of the fantasy fight: Rs 149 to Rs 349.

 ?Beyblade is a collectible item for boys, but they can actually play with it. There are more than 26 varieties of Beyblades targeted at children in the five-to-14 age group,? says Sagarnil Ganguly, senior sales executive, Funskool.

 And how many Beyblade runners are there in Calcutta? ?Till now, more than 4,500 pieces have been sold and there is a booking for more than 15,000 pieces,? says Ganguly. That pushes demand past the craze count for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (initial supply of 9,500, followed by another 3,500).

 All because of Blade Breakers like Kabir Guha. The seven-year-old had been calling up Crossword every day to ask whether fresh stocks had arrived. 

 On Monday evening, he was finally clutching on to his prized possession and planning stadium strategy for the lunchtime showdown in school.

 ?All my classmates have Beyblades and they have a match during break-time. I?ll join them from tomorrow. I have bought a Danzer because I do not want anybody to survive in front of me,? Kabir told Metro.

 In the world of Beyblades, if Dranzer gives bursting power early in the battle for those who want to go for the kill, Wolberg provides a balance of attack and defence, Draciel has defence rings for those who want to play it safe?

 Crossword and Landmark are playing it safe when out of stock, as they struggle to meet and beat the desperate demand of Beyblade boys.

 At the Lord Sinha Road store, a consignment of 124 pieces on June 25 was sold out in a day. With Funskool, importers of the toy into India, failing to cope, the second consignment of 480 pieces arrived only on July 23, only for most to fly off the racks.

 At Crossword, three instalments of 30-odd pieces were lapped up in no time, forcing the Elgin Road store to bring in 220 pieces on July 25 and give them away to pre-booked Beybladers, on a first-come-first-grab basis.

 ?We do not have a single piece on display because all of them have been booked. Nobody had anticipated such a phenomenal demand from this toy ever since the series started coming on Cartoon Network. There are numerous calls from kids and their parents every day to inquire if the new consignment of Beyblades has arrived,? smiles Sidharth Pansari of Crossword.

 For Gautam Jatia of Landmark, pester power for Beyblades began at home. 

 ?It was through my nine-year-old son that I came to know how Beyblades had caught the fancy of youngsters. Without even seeing the toy, we placed an order for 124 pieces and the entire consignment was sold out in less than two days. It is a huge hit, considering that Harry Potter is also on the racks,? says Jatia.

 Landmark is planning a host of Beyblade events in the coming months, with Jatia expecting this toy story to last till the end of the year.

 - TRAINING DEAL INKED

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 Two employees of the National Library will visit Malaysia every year to be trained in modern library management. The training, under Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme, will be imparted by the personnel of the National Library of Malaysia.

 The arrangement was sealed at a conference of the Directors of National Libraries, held in Malaysia in May. Representatives from the libraries of India, Australia, Korea, Bhutan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, among others, attended the meet.

 ?It is, indeed, a great achievement and will go a long way in developing the National Library, especially the management system, according to international standards,? said director Sudhendu Mondol.

 ?We had forwarded the training proposal to our Malaysian counterpart, among others, during the conference. We are happy that the project has received the green signal. The details are yet to be worked out,? he added.

 The return journey of the professionals, who will be below 35, and their stay and transportation in Malaysia will be sponsored by the National Library of Malaysia.

 The training will include various facets of library administration ? computerisation with advance data-filing system, day-to-day functioning, speedy access to books and utilisation of available resources. 

 Along with theoretical classes, the trainees will work for some time at the National Library there.

 ?The programme is different from the usual cultural exchange programmes and will not in any way hamper our ties with libraries of other countries. The training programme in Malaysia will run parallel to the exchange programmes,? said director Mondol.

 The library runs exchange programmes with 90 countries. Scholars and professionals from these countries regularly visit the library. Similarly, the library, too, sends researchers and professionals to these countries.

 Recently, two women from Damascus and Syria had visited the library under an exchange programme.

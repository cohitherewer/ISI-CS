 Fresh sounds, fashion haunt

 After Crystal Grass and Jack Rabbit, it was the turn of another young and promising band to take the Someplace Else stage on Wednesday night.

 The first two were the winner and runners-up of Boom-Bass-Stick: The Band Hunt. Camouflage was the second runner-up in the closely fought battle of bands.

 The mid-week performance found the group rocking the pub at The Park with its blend of covers and original compositions.

 The line-up of Rajarshi Roy, Avik Sarkar, Soumitra Rakshit, Suvodeep Guha and Premjeet Dutta plugged in around 9 pm, starting off with Pink Floyds Wall.

 From there, it was a rocking ride through Bryan Adams, Maroon5, Keane, Travis and more.

 Dire Straits was a particular favourite, with both the staple Sultans of Swing and the lesser-performed On Every Street on offer.

 Original tracks included Hysterical Blindness and Revolution (which had been performed at the auditions of Boom-Bass-Stick). The Doors Break on Through was the final song of the night, a little after 10.30 pm.

 The only problem we had was with the cold. We didnt think the air-conditioning would be so strong and our fingers froze on the guitar frets, admitted Avik after the show, adding that the band was a little disappointed with its performance. We had really practised hard.

 Formed early this year, Camouflage comprises mostly college students, with only the drummer being a full-time musician. Alternative music is how it defines its musical preference.

 Next up for the boys is a go at MTVs Rock Idols contest next month.

 Sari style

 A brand new style stop for the ladies of north Calcutta opened its doors on Saturday afternoon. Senses Sarees, the store at P-50, C.I.T Road in Kankurgachhi, was inaugurated by small-screen actress Surveen Chawla (Kasak of Kasautii Zindagii Kay fame), looking pretty in a pale pink salwar suit.

 With the opening of this showroom, women in this part of the city do not have to trek all the way to Park Street for sari purchases. We offer the latest designs and the prices are very competitive, claims proprietor Mukesh Goyal.

 The store houses a wide variety of georgettes, crepes, chiffons and printed drapes. Apart from intricate detailing with sequins, mirror and threadwork, there are saris with floral embellishments in coloured leather.

 The show-stealers are the butterfly-cut saris with thin pallu and the ghagra choli saris with heavy work on the pleats, resembling the fall of a ghagra. Then you have drapes where the aanchal is put across your shoulders, giving an interesting V-shaped neckline.

 Prices start at Rs 1,500 and go up to Rs 40,000.

 Solitude whiff in woman?s death 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Thursday recovered the decomposed body of Rama Chakraborty, 60, from her apartment in Salt Lake?s Karunamoyee, where she used to live alone.

 ?Going by the state of the body we suspect she had died at least three days ago,? said an officer of Bidhannagar (North) thana.

 ?There were no injury marks or signs that could raise suspicion. Still, the body has been sent for post-mortem,? the officer added.

 Police were informed by neighbours, who were alerted by the stench emanating from the apartment. The cops had to break open the door, as it was locked from inside.

 Chakraborty, a retired state government employee, was single. She had moved into the apartment with her parents in 1980. ?But after their death, she became very lonely,? said a neighbour. 

 Though she rarely mixed with them, neighbours could sense that loneliness had given rise to depression since her retirement from service. The depression, they suspect, caused her early death.

 A year ago, an aged man had died at home in CA block, alone. The body was recovered after several days. His wife had gone to visit their son.

 Alarmed at the incidents, Salt Lake Senior Citizens? Association secretary Ajit Chatterjee said: ?Loneliness and depression leading to death is a growing problem here. Most aged people feel they are unwanted and develop frustration.?

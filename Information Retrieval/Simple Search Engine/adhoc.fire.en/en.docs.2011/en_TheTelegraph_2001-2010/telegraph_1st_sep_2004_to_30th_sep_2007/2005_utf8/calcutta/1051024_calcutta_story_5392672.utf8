 Cool call: Rajyavardhan Rathore in the Coca Cola 

commercial

 Mumbai was witness to a spectacular shooting scene a week-and-a-half ago. The city, home to the continent?s biggest film industry, is no stranger to cameras rolling in public places. But it was the first time that the lens zoomed in on an Olympic medallist taking aim.

 Rajyavardhan Rathore was going great guns at BPCL stadium. ?There were people thronging the roofs and the balconies in the surrounding buildings. It was quite exciting,? the champion told Metro.

 The occasion was special for Rathore as well, for it was the first time that he was facing the camera. ?As a government employee, I could not engage in any commercial activity. So, although I have been receiving offers ever since Athens 2004, I did not take them up as I wanted to honour the discipline of the army,? says the 35-year-old armyman. 

 Once the go-ahead was given (at the behest of army chief General J.J. Singh), soft drink major Coca Cola wasted no time in signing him up to add fizz to its new theme campaign Piyo Sar Utha Ke. ?He is a real winner standing for integrity, honesty and commitment ? values that we associate with Coke,? explains Prasoon Joshi, national creative director of McCann-Erickson. Mona ?Jassi? Singh features in a sister ad.

 The commercial required the champion to shoot objects thrown up in the air with his shotgun. ?As the actual machine is very heavy, they used hand-held launchers. But it was not dangerous for the watchers as the maximum range of my gun was 70 to 80 m.? This was a far cry from the actual double trap event where he has to aim at objects flying at 90 km/hour, with two of them flying simultaneously. ?I have to shoot at 200 such targets at the tournaments. But here the objects were much slower.?

 So was the shooting a cakewalk for him? Rathore?s laughter leads to an admission: ?What was not a cakewalk was trying to do the emotions. Now I have even more admiration for the actors who emote so well.? 

 The commercial debuted on the small screen on Saturday but till the afternoon, Rathore had not managed to see it. ?I am caught in my own world since 7.30 am ? training on the range and then the gym.? He has reason to keep himself in peak condition, what with the National Shooting Championships coming up in Hyderabad followed by a spate of major international tournaments.

 But there will be more of the armyman on TV. He has signed another deal with an automobile company.

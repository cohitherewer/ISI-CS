The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 During a recent visit to Nehru Children?s Museum with my grandchildren, I was 

shocked to find the exhibits in such a pitiful state. The decade-old Ramayana 

and Mahabharata clay models have lost their sheen; some are also broken. The lights 

at some of the exhibits are missing. On the third floor, a section has been closed 

to visitors. A signboard reading ?Not working? has been put up nearby. The museum 

charges an entry fee of Rs 5 per head. But if the present trend continues, it 

will soon not be worth visiting even free of cost. 

 Banwari Lal Pareek, Kalakar Street. 

 It is learnt that November 2, 3 and 4 have been fixed for immersion of Kali 

idols in the city. However, many marketplaces in Garden Reach and Metiabruz, close 

to Bichali Ghat, remain overcrowded because of Id shopping. The roads are very 

congested and it will be difficult for Matadors and trucks carrying Kali idols 

for immersion to pass the area on the evening of Id. The local administration 

should extend the date of immersion by a day in these areas so that the rush can 

be avoided. 

 Javed Hossain, Garden Reach. 

 On October 24, the street lights on parts of MG Road and JM Sengupta Road were 

kept on till 2 pm. Whose money is the civic body wasting so recklessly? 

 Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge.

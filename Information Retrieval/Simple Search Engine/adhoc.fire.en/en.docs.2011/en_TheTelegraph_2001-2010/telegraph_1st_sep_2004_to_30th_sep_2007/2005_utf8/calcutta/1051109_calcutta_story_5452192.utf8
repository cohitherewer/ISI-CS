 Managing director, 

 Shringar Cinemas (management of Fame multiplex chain)

 The multiplexes are drawing audiences that had stopped coming to the cinema hall. We are expanding the base of film consumers, not eating into the consumer base of singlescreen theatres. In fact, the single-screen theatres are sitting on a pot of gold, only they do not realise it. They have recovered their costs long back. If they spend Rs 50-70 lakh on renovation, they can give multiplexes a run for their money, just like the old hotels like Oberoi Grand and The Park are doing. Look at how a well-maintained hall like Priya is doing great business. Location and low price are the trumpcards of the single screens. Even if we reduce prices, that is for barely five to seven per cent of the seats.

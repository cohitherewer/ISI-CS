 Another hat to handle

 It?s another hat on her pretty, silver head. But going by her recent run, it could well turn out to be another crown of thorns. Nafisa Ali Sodhi, recently appointed Children?s Film Society of India (CFSI) chairperson, was in town on Friday to click open painter-actress-model Piu Sarkar?s exhibition of 17 self-portraits titled In Disguise, at The Park banquets. A percentage of the proceeds will go to Nafisa?s AIDS awareness project in New Delhi, Action India.

 While Piu and her passion were on display ? ?I?ve many faces but one mind? was her standard line for the evening ? but all the right noises were made by Nafisa.

 ?I think I have made my place under the sun and it is my commitment to so many different ventures that has given me another chance,? she said with a sparkling smile reminiscent of her Water Baby days. ?The Children?s Film Society is a huge platform and it?s a platform worth standing on.?

 But wouldn?t she turn out to be another Raveena Tandon, who had to resign from the chairperson?s post owing to shortage of time? ?She has a small baby? my kids have grown up,? pat came the reply from Nafisa, almost pre-meditated.

 Shoestring budgets and low-priced tickets have been spelling doomsday for children?s movies for quite some time now and Nafisa did seem aware of that. ?There are problems but I have my friends in politics. I stood for the Congress and they are running the government now. So I think I should be able to bring about a change. Indian films have to change and the CFSI should play a major role in that change.?

 Before she goes on to help capture the ?fantasy world? for kids, Nafisa is working hard on her AIDS project. ?HIV has to be understood because the disease is very confusing to the patient. They don?t know what?s next. There may not be a solution to the disease but there is care for people suffering from AIDS. Now that I have lost the election, I am back to the work I have always done,? she said.

 Her work includes stirring up a fresh formula to squash the dormant dogma dictating children?s films in the country. While the junoon to do something filmi for the little ones has definitely dawned upon Nafisa, she is not willing to put on the greasepaint easily. ?Maybe I can play a naani in one of the films,? signed off the lady whose last screen appearance was as Mrs Bachchan in Major Saab.

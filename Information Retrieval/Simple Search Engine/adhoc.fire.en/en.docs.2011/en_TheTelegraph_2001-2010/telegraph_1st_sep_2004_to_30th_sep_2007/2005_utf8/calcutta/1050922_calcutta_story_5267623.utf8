 As the action on the Netaji Indoor Stadium courts hot up with every passing shot, the glamour element of Sunfeast Open 2005 extended beyond the field and on to the ramp on Tuesday evening.

 There were strokes of style and aces of attitude presented by international tennis stars ? many of whom can give our professional models a run for their ramp money with their heights and hot bods ? at a fashion show at the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton and Towers on Day II of the WTA tournament.

 The Sunfeast Open Players Party, as the event was titled, opened with a catwalk that saw tennis players like Anastasia Myskina, Elena Likhovtseva, Sunita Rao, Karolina Sprem, Antonella Serra Zanetti, Melinda Czink and Arantxa Parra Santonja parading outfits by Wills Lifestyle.

 Giving them company on the ramp were some of the countrys top models like Jesse Randhawa, Carol Gracious, Diandra Soares, Candice Pinto, Sunalika Oberoi, Tapur Chatterjee, Tupur Chatterjee, Inder Sudan (who stole the show among the men), Pravin, Rajnish Dugal and Zulfi Sayed.

 Tennis has always been a game of great style and glamour. So tonight we decided to look at this aspect of the sport with a unique fusion of tennis and fashion, said Ravi Naware, chief executive of ITCs food division.

 The catwalk unveiled a specially-crafted collection of sporty and trendy garments inspired by on-court fashion.

 For women the line comprised knitwear uppers with sporty detailing, fitted short skirts, capris and trousers.

 For men there were vibrant shirts, tees, bold sportswear knits, cargoes and shorts. 

 The colour story developed from soft hues like sky blue, lime green and pale pink to vibrant orange, red and navy blue, combined with a dominant dose of white, in line with the game.

 The patterns too were subtle and sporty, restricted mainly to solids and horizontal stripes.

 The brief ramp affair, well-choreographed by Marc Robinson, lasted all of 25 minutes, but ensured that the audience had its share of fun as long as it did.

 The show was punctuated with performances by singer and musician Raghav Sachar, famed for his ability to play 24 instruments, who blended his music with the fashion sequences.

 The much-awaited show got over in less than half-an- hour, but the fun continued at the party, the highlight of which was a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance by Sania Mirza. 

 The tennis heartthrob, who gave the ramp the miss, slipped into the party dressed in a hot pink skirt and black top (with a pink spaghetti peeping out), her trademark accessories in place.

 As soon as the Sania mania began (within 60 seconds, that is), she was whisked away by Shewta Bhupathi, Maheshs model wife, to a collective groan from men and mediapersons.

 The soothing strains of a guitar, the melody of a piano, the rhythm of drum beats? Wish you had learnt an instrument, or had the means to buy one?

 Well, if music is in your blood, then the tools are there to help you make music ? all in one, and at lower cost than putting together a band. Just plug in the computer, switch it on and compose away to your heart?s content.

 That?s what M-Audio?s Reason program allows the user. The hardware and software are a combination of instruments and studio audio equipment. Easy enough for non-professional musicians, non-computer geeks and even youngsters to use, once they learn how.

 Sound loops, interfaces, monitors, FireWire? Not Greek and Latin, but the code words to make virtual music in the digital age. In town on Monday to explain the workings of Reason was Chris Adams, director, international sales, M-Audio. After Hyderabad and then Calcutta, Adams is off to Mumbai and Chennai.

 The workshop was attended by eight students, as well as a few professionals, including Usha Uthup, Gyan and Jayashree Singh and Amyt Datta from Skinny Alley and Chandrani and Bikramjit from Krosswindz. Most tried a hand at the system, even as Adams took Uthup through the steps. 

 ?Places like Latin America and India are cheap markets, where people don?t have too much money to spend, but there?s plenty of talent. They need the basic equipment,? explained Adams. 

 ?Even five years ago, the quality of digital software available wasn?t good enough and it was not easily accessible. Now, it?s getting cheaper and the quality, better. So it?s a viable alternative for artistes. It is gaining in popularity around the world,? he added.

 For beginners, there?s the studio classroom, with virtual lessons. 

 Once the ABC of Reason is in grip, there are very few limits. There are interfaces for individual instruments like drums, guitar and keyboards, as well as sound loops. 

 Make your own music on separate instruments and combine them, or string sound loops together ? all at the click of a mouse or the press of a key. 

 Sound loops can even be downloaded off the Net, and played around with. A DJ?s dream, a beginner?s basics and a professional?s paradise.

 Connect the monitors ? essentially speakers but which allow sound to be recorded, unlike in-built sound cards in computers which only allow playback ? and hook up microphones to make sweet music. It?s a marriage between science and the arts, of technology and creativity.

 Formerly known as Midiman, the company was started in 1988. It was merged with Avid last year. M-Audio has several artistes on its list, including Black Eyed Peas, Groove Armada and Dirty Vegas, all of whom use the varied mobile digital music-making programmes, anytime, anywhere.

 So if you have been waiting for the right moment to put together a demo tape to blow away music industry bosses, here?s your chance.

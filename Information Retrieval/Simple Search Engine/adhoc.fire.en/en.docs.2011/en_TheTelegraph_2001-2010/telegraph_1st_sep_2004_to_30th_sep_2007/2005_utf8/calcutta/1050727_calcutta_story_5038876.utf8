The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It is close to four months since a consortium of six channels, The West Bengal Association for Better Television Broadcast, had promised to purge their beam of ?unscientific? content. But astrologers continue to take calls on people?s crises and hold out remedial measures for all problems, existing and non-existing. 

 Says Tapan Roy, director, ATN: ?Earlier, we used to have astrology programmes for two-three hours every day. Since April 15, we have stopped beaming these shows, as promised. All sorts of people are turning astrologers. The government had talked of a legislation to curb this practice. But nothing has materialised.?

 Taaza is another channel that has kept its word. ?We are predominantly a news channel and had shown astrology for barely two months. Even then, we used to control the phone lines for the live dial-in programmes as the astrologers deployed lots of dummy callers,? says Pawan Bajaj, of Taaza.

 But these two are in the minority when it comes to the ground (cable) channels. There are at least half a dozen channels ? Spandan, Srishti, Channel Vision etc ? giving a platform to astrologers. While not all are totally dependent for content on astrology like Fortune Channel is, the financial dependence is definitely there.?When CTVN started the trend, we did not initially join in. But the commercial factor has forced our hand. The four MSOs charge too much as carriage fee to show our channel. We have to depend on the money these paid slots bring us in the face of tremendous competition for advertisements,? says Rajsekhar Biswas, co-ordinator of Aamar Channel, adding that the astrology programmes are hugely popular. 

 According to Dibyajyoti Basu of Khoj Khabor, the news magazine that had earlier this year ?exposed? Satyananda who had his show on CTVN, people will remain vulnerable in today?s stressful life. ?But it is wrong of the media to highlight astrologers.?

 After his brush with the law, Satyananda, incidentally, is back on beam ? on Aamar and Srishti. Taaza is also unsure how long it can keep away from astrology if other channels continue to rake in the moolah.

 A lyrical remembrance

 Tagore dedicated almost all the works of his early youth to his sister-in-law, Kadambari Devi. Her artistic talent, which blossomed and flourished within the exalted ambience of the Tagore household, inspired some of Tagore?s most immortal compositions. Remembering Kadambari Devi on her birth and wedding anniversary, Sravasti hosts Shrimati Hey, an evening of songs, reading and recitation from Tagore. Participants include Aniruddha Singha, Agnimitra Ghosh, Satyakam Sen, Rohini Roychowdhuri, Ritocheta Goswami, Chandreyee Ghosh and KeyaChaitali. Guest: Sankha Ghosh. The evening?s cultural programme precedes the inauguration of a two-day exhibition showcasing the exclusive sartorial styles and trends of the members of the Tagore family. Designed by KeyaChaitali.

 Event: Shrimati Hey, a programme of songs, reading and recitation

 When: Today at 6 pm

 Shake-up time for facilitator

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Low-yielding investments, ad hoc decision-making and lackadaisical approach in collection of user charges will soon become a thing of the past at West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBIIDC), the government agency in-charge of creating infrastructure for the industry. 

 ?We are in the process of setting up a working group to set things right in the organisation,? said Atri Bhattacharya, chief executive officer of the 30-year-old organisation, which has been incurring losses since inception.

 But after a complete overhauling of the board ? with the state industries and commerce minister Nirupam Sen at the helm of affairs ? the agency is planning professionally and is drawing up plans to emerge as a competitive agency. 

 ?The board has given its go-ahead to a proposal of corporate deposit with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), which will result in higher interest earning of around Rs 60 to Rs 90 lakh a year,? said Bhattacharya, who is also the executive director of WBIDC. 

 According to him, this will be a ?win-win? arrangement, as it will also help in resource mobilisation for WBIDC. 

 Besides efficient utilisation of funds, WBIIDC ? responsible for development and maintenance of facilities in 12 industrial parks in the state ? has decided to focus on collection of user charges from the industrial estates. 

 As part of its revenue augmentation drive, the agency has plans to leverage its engineering capabilities by extending services to other government departments. Developing a part of its prime landholdings ? out of the 1,860 acres across the state ? for commercial purposes is also on the agenda. 

 Being prudent with costs will be another important focus as WBIIDC has decided to study viability of investments before committing resources for industrial estates. The board has also agreed to outsource delivery of services at the industrial estates.

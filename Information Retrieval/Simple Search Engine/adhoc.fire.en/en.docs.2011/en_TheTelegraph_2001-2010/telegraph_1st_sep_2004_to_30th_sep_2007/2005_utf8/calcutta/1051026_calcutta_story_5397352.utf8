 Jewellery house Diagold is hosting an exhibition of its new festive line of ornaments till October 26. 

 On at Sumangal apartments, 4, Lee Road, the exhibition showcases designer Varda Goenkas Diwali collection.

 The line boasts a diverse range of diamond and stone-studded jewellery in gold, silver and white gold, which would be on display at the two other Diagold outlets in City Centre and Metro Plaza after the exhibition. 

 While Varda has always focussed on trendy western jewellery for the modern woman who loves to experiment with western and Indo-western attires, this collection is more a shift towards tradition, mainly in diamonds. 

 For this Diwali, I have consciously focussed on diamond jewellery keeping in mind that people these days spend a lot during Dhanteras. Apart from heavy diamond kundan and jadau sets, there is an array of lighter ornaments that makes for great gift options during the festival, says Varda.

 The collection comprises chandelier earrings and stunning neckpieces in diamond and jadau. Also seen are long cascading pendants, necklaces, cocktail rings and so on.

 Other attractions at the exhibition are diamond-studded watches and braided meshes delicately crafted in intricate designs.

 Large multifaceted stones in a variety of hues ? cappuccino, champagne, cognac browns, peachy pinks, ruby reds, murky maroons, emerald greens, golden topazes, aqua blues, peridots and tourmalines ? have been cut to precision to create a wide range of regular and occasional wear jewellery this Diwali. 

 Adding to the festive extravaganza is a lucky draw on the last day of the exhibition where buyers get a chance to win designer wear.

 Health hub

 Health Shoppe, an alternative health product store, opened its counter at 2 Rowland Road on Tuesday afternoon. 

 The first over-the-counter alternative health store stocks products ranging from lactose-free edibles (for those allergic to milk) to magnetic strips for all parts of the body.

 Rushing to the nearest clinic is not the only solution anymore and people have realised that. The products here are anything but drug-based. The Calcutta shop is our launch pad, said Amit Mohta, chief operatinig officer, Nantra Retailing and Distribution Limited, which owns the Rowland Road address.

 I have seen nothing like this in India. Calcuttans who go abroad and shop for these products would now find them within easy reach, Russi Mody said at the inauguration.

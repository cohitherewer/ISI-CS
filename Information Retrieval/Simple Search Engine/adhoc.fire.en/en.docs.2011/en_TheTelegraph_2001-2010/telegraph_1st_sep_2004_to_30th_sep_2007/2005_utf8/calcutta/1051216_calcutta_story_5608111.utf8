The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Here?s catching up with Konkona

 She?s back home after a while for:

 Friendship and films. First in line is a friend?s wedding. ?She?s a childhood friend? I will put on mehndi now,? chirps Konkona Sen Sharma. The second reason behind her 10-day stay is a 10-minute film, her fillm for the Kala Ghoda Festival in Mumbai.

 ?The Festival has asked four women to make 10-minute films and I am one of them,? says Konkona, gearing up for her first steps in the film-making footsteps of mother Aparna Sen.

 Her film features:

 Actress sisters Sudipta and Bidipta Chakraborty. ?It?s fiction I am working on and we will shoot it on digital? I don?t know what will happen. I have no idea. But there are people to help me out,? she laughs, planning to shoot on location next week.

 The actress awaits:

 Dosar, directed by Rituparno Ghosh, will be in the theatres by January. The film revolving around marital infidelity features Konkona as Prosenjit?s wife.

 Mixed Doubles by Rajat Kapoor (who made Raghu Romeo) should release in February. Konkona stars alongside Koel Purie, Ranvir Shorey and Rajat Kapoor himself in this film about upper-middle-class married couples.

 She has finished work on:

 Naseeruddin Shah?s directorial debut Yun Hota To Kya Hota, co-starring Irrfan, Ayesha Takia, Jimmy Shergill and Paresh Rawal. ?There are four stories and they are related by one event,? explains Konkona.

 Meridian by debutante Vinny Mitra, featuring Irrfan, Abhay Deol, Arjun Rampal and Raima Sen. ?It was an ensemble cast and the film is about karma and fate.?

 Looking forward to:

 The release of Aparna Sen?s 15, Park Avenue, on December 30. ?I am so excited and also very anxious about it. I hope people receive it well,? says Konkona, who plays the schizophrenic sister of Shabana Azmi.

 In the pipeline:

 Her mother?s Hindi film based on Goynar Baksho, co-starring Sharmila Tagore, Soha Ali Khan, Govinda and Paresh Rawal. ?But I am not shooting any film right now,? she stresses.

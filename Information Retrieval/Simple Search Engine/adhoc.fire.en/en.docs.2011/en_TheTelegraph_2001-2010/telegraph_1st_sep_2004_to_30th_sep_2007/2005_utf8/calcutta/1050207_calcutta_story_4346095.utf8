The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Record rush wraps up book fair 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The 30th Calcutta Book Fair came to a close on Sunday, with the organisers claiming record footfall and sales.

 ?This year, the fair was spread over 12 days. Despite the rain on January 28, and the consequent closure of the fair on January 29, more than 18 million people had visited the fair by Thursday,? said Tridib Kumar Chatterjee, honorary general secretary of the Publishers and Booksellers? Guild, which organised the fair. 

 ?In other words, on the ninth day of the fair, we broke last year?s record of total visitors,? he elaborated.

 ?On Saturday alone, more than 2.2 million people visited the fair. We are still counting how many people dropped in on Sunday,? he added.

 According to Chattrejee, though the exact figures have not been tabulated yet, last year?s sales figure of Rs 30 lakh was crossed on Saturday.

 ?This year?s theme country was France, and we had 35 French delegates with us through the fair. The famous structure off the Louvre was recreated at the French pavilion,? said Kalyan Shah, president of the Publishers and Booksellers? Guild. 

 ?Our guest-of-honour country was Spain. We are hoping to make it the theme country next year,? he added.

 Shah explained that the organisers had adopted the strategy of having a guest-of-honour country to give it a taste of Calcutta Book Fair, so that it agrees to become the theme country in future.

 ?The speciality of this year was the celebration of 30 years of the fair, apart from three seminars that elicited great response. We had a lot of interactions and debates among authors, budding writers, intellectuals, scholars and readers,? Chatterjee said. 

 ?I believe that bringing forward the entry time from 2 pm to noon for the last week allowed a lot of students, teachers and librarians to visit the fair. Besides, a lot of elderly people, who do not like crowds, came in early,? he added.

 The fair?s ground convener Sudhangshu Dey said: ?I personally inspect the area after the fair closes every day. By morning, our sweepers make sure that all the rubbish is cleared away. After the fair is over, there is a joint inspection with the police and the army to make sure we clean up before we vacate the grounds.?

 Asked if the venue of the fair would be shifted next year, Chatterjee said: ?We definitely want the fair to be held here, but it is not for us to decide.?

 According to him, the proposed fair ground off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass is not large enough to host the book fair.

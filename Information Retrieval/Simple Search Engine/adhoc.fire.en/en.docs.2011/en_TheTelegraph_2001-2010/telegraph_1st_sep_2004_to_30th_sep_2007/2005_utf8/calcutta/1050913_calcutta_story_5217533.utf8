 The d?cor of your room can never ever be complete without them. Coming in a variety of hues and textures, they have everything in them to make even the dullest of rooms come alive. Yes, its curtain call time this week.

 With city furnishing stores filling up the racks with new and vibrant designs, you can give your room a completely different look, mixing and matching the latest line of window drapes.

 Says interior designer Anita Mansata: Gone are the days when French pleats in curtains would be the only choice. Today, people are beginning to experiment with curtains and the results are just remarkable.

 She adds a note of caution: Keep in mind the size of your room, the furniture and the colour of your walls while choosing curtains.

 GoodLife checks out some common varieties and the look they can lend your home.

 Silk touch

 Silk and satin curtains, feel most interior designers, are apt choices for living rooms. And pale colours like whites, off-whites and silver rule as they complement bright-coloured carpets and sofas.

 Though not very popular, bolder shades of these fabrics can also be used to do up the bedroom. 

 While satin curtains are priced around Rs 100 a metre, silks, particularly the embroidered ones, can cost around Rs 495 a metre. 

 A good way of doing up the living room in style is to use a combination of curtains and scaleps.

 No matter how traditional they look, the appeal is eternal, particularly if you have a large drawing room.

 Sheer style

 One of the latest additions to the curtain family, sheers are a complete sell-out, with a large number of people preferring the double curtain system.

 The speciality of the variety is that when pulled during daytime it gives you a view of all thats happening outside, without allowing people outside to see into the room.

 It also allows adequate lighting, without sacrificing your privacy.

 Polyester pick

 This variety, in vibrant shades and prints, is a favourite for kids rooms. With hues like red, blue and yellow and a host of printed cartoons on them, the vibrancy of a childs room is best brought out with polyester curtains, says Anita. Prices start at around Rs 75 a metre.

 Cool cottons

 Readymade loop curtain in cotton is the in thing, particularly for bedrooms and studio apartments. And the one-stop shop for these is FabIndia at Hindusthan Park, with a wide array of styles and colours for both doors and windows.

 To begin with, you can choose from the range of mul curtains available in a variety of checks in natural and light colours. While the large pieces come for Rs 326, the smaller ones cost around Rs 264.

 ock-printed and Shibori curtains are also some of FabIndias specialities. These come in bright hues like yellow and orange and are great for lending an ethnic look to your bedroom.

 They are priced between Rs 383 and Rs 484.

 Also on offer at the store are organza curtains with Mughal prints, priced at Rs 658 each.

 Says Sujata Apsar of FabIndia: The latest trend in curtains is to go for a lot of mixing and matching. Combining different types of cotton curtains in the right shades lends a dash of freshness and style to any room.

 To complement bright-coloured walls, you can pick from the range of white khari curtains. This variety also works wonders for the drawing room, where paler colours form the preferred palette.

 While heavy cotton curtains are available at almost all furnishing stores, FabIndia offers a unique range of ribbed ones. These are just right for drawing rooms, as are the reversible curtains.

 Blind spot

 While curtains are the common choice of drapes for windows, you can opt for a different look with blinds, especially for the den or the verandah.

 These come in a range of colour combinations and prints and can pep up the d?cor quite easily.

 Says Anita: Blinds are fashionable and happening now. These are suitable for lending a cosy look to your private space.

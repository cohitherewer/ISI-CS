 Insider help for rookie abductors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Roma Jhawar?s abduction was planned by people who had never committed a crime of this nature before. Also, those who had executed it had no earlier experience of carrying out an operation on this scale. 

 Their combined inexperience enabled the police to crack the case within 48 hours of the kidnapping.

 ?The first phase ? abducting Roma from Salt Lake?s CA island, 50 m from her residence ? was neatly carried out. And it happened only because of the involvement of someone close to the Jhawar family,? said an officer on the case.

 ?The abductors fled without leaving a single clue that might have helped us start preliminary investigations. But leads started coming after half an hour, when the process of demanding ransom started,? the officer added. 

 ?We found out the whereabouts of Roma and her abductors only because they used her cell phone to make the calls.?

 The leads provided by Roma?s mobile phone brought about the breakthrough within 48 hours of the incident. 

 ?The next 10 hours will be crucial for us, because we are expecting more arrests, including that of the mastermind and the person close to her family,? claimed the Criminal Investigation Department.

 Police say a person close to the family had helped the criminals in carrying out the abduction. ?The abductors had all the details of the Jhawar family. On the day of the incident, they were waiting there with specific information,? said an officer.

 Inspector-general of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee confirmed this, saying: ?The man close to Roma?s family played a key role in the incident. He is still at large.?

 After interrogating the eight arrested men, police came to know the mastermind?s identity, who had planned the abduction a month before. His name has been withheld for the sake of investigation. 

 ?They contacted the person who had easy access to the Jhawars and started collecting information about Roma?s movements from him,? said another officer on the case.

 The abductors were waiting from 8 am on the road leading to City Centre from CA island, the spot where the abduction took place. 

 ?They took up position on the road, 100 m from the island, from where Roma?s house and the main gate was clearly visible. They knew the colour of Roma?s vehicle, the exact time of her departure and the route by which she reached college,? the officer added.

 Cradle for IAS ready to close 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 For years, the centre had offered specialised training for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) aspirants. 

 But now, with hardly anybody interested in the administrative services from this region, the time has come to stop the training once and for all.

 Started in 1994, the training centre, under the aegis of the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), will be shut down later this year, because the authorities say Calcuttans are fast losing interest in the administrative service.

 ?We had noticed that the number of aspirants has been decreasing sharply in the past few years. This year, the number became so low (less then 10) that we cannot afford either to manage or continue our training classes for the aspirants,? said R.N. Muhuri, coordinator of the IAS centre of the institute.

 The institute was charging Rs 10,000 to train candidates before they took the two (preliminary and main) exams. But the performance of candidates from Calcutta and rest of Bengal has been dismal in the high-profile examination.

 For the record, only 21 candidates from Bengal had successfully cleared the IAS exams between 1997 and 2005. 

 In 2005, only two students cleared IAS, indicating why the institute lost faith in training students.

 A high-powered state government committee, comprising chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, his predecessor Ashok Gupta and several other senior officers, including some from the IISWBM, last March tried to find out the reasons behind Bengal?s failure. 

 ?This is one the most prestigious centres in Calcutta and the oldest. We must find out ways to improve it,? Ashok Gupta had said then.

 However, all attempts to improve matters failed. ?Classes are not held regularly. The institute does not have infrastructural support staff and the quality of the faculty is not good either. I would rather go for a more professional institute than this one,? said Anubhav Saha, an IAS aspirant, who had tried his luck at the centre on College Street.

 ?These days, Calcuttans seem to be opting for other professions like information technology and even education,? said Jyotirmoyee Pal Choudhury, former coordinator of the centre. 

 ?The failure rate is so high among IAS aspirants that the authorities should also run a motivational course parallel to the main training courses,? added Pal Choudhury, who also runs the Bose Academy of Career Advancement, providing training to students planning to sit for administrative exams.

 ?We have told the students to shift elsewhere, as we will close down,? U.K. Banerjee, the registrar of the institute said.

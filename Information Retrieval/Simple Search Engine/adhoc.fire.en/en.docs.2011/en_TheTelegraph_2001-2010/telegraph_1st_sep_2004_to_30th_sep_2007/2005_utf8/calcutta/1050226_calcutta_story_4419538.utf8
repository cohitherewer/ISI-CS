 School tips on stream options

 - ARTS, COMMERCE amp; PARENTAL BIAS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The principal of a reputed English-medium school in north Calcutta was shocked when he received a letter from a Class XI student, who was denied promotion. 

 ?Sir, I have lost a year studying science at the insistence of my parents. I should have taken your advice last year when you told me and my parents that I would do well if I studied commerce. Sir, please don?t listen to my parents and allow me to switch over to commerce so that I don?t fail again next year.?

 The student was allowed to switch streams, but he is still suffering from depression.

 After psychiatrists cautioned guardians not to ruin the academic careers of their wards by forcing them to study science in the Plus II level, English-medium schools have decided to launch a campaign among parents on job opportunities emerging from commerce and humanities.

 Heads of Anglo-Indian schools are alarmed at the rise in the number of Plus II students suffering from mental disorders ? depression, disinterest in studies and even a violent attitude in reaction to parental pressure. 

 The heads have undertaken a measure to convince the parents that their children can land top-notch jobs even if they don?t study science.

 The schools will organise a series of workshops and interactive sessions with guardians, where experts from management institutes will deliver lectures on job opportunities for commerce and humanities students.

 Parents will be asked to seriously consider the observation of teachers and heads of schools before pressuring the school to allow a child to opt for science.

 ?Hundreds of students are ruining their careers by dreaming false dreams of becoming doctors and engineers,? rued J.K.Sen, principal, Julien Day School, Ganganagar, and general secretary, Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools.

 ?Guardians must be made aware that the future of their wards is not in science alone. Brighter opportunities are now opening in commerce and humanities,? he added. 

 The list of new career openings in commerce and humanities are:

hospitality management

travel and tourism 

insurance and risk management 

mass communication and media science. 

 Jobs are opening for girls opting for home science.

 Several Anglo-Indian schools had introduced career counselling for students over the past two years. ?We plan to include parents, too, in the discussions,? said Terence Ireland, principal, St James School. 

 According to Ireland, more than 20 students in his institution, who had opted for science, switched to commerce after realising that science was not their thing. 

 ?Parents must realise that schoolteachers, who guide a child for years, can best decide which stream he or she should opt for. The school?s opinion must be taken into consideration,? stressed C.R. Gasper, principal, St Augustine?s Day School.

 The Royal Challenge The Telegraph Merchants Cup held at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) came to an end on Friday. The tournament that kicked off on Tuesday had 75 teams from various corporate houses across the eastern region teeing off.

 Come Friday evening and it was time to shower accolades and awards on the winners at the Oberoi Grand ballroom. This was followed up with a high-profile party and a performance by Dhwani. 

 But first, the 101-year-old tournament and its winners in 2005.

 In a slight change in the format of the play, provision has been made for companies who do not have golf-playing personnel but who still want to make their presence felt in the tourney. 

 Traditionally, there is a team comprising a minimum of three members. So only companies with at least three golf-playing executives would participate. There were a lot of grievances from companies who did not have enough executives playing the game. Hence, the slight change in format, says Brandon D Souza, managing director of Tiger Sports and emcee for the awards night.

 The bottomline is to involve more and more companies and increase camaraderie and sporting spirit amongst them, says A.K.M.A. Shamsuddin, president, Shaw Wallace Distilleries Ltd, UB Group.

 The flexi format to allow non-executives a place to putt resulted in more than 30 applications for the concurrent The Telegraph Challenge Cup, which was ultimately won by Sudsons who totalled 215.6. Flex Alloys with 216.6 came a close second.

 As for the real thing, Williamson Magor A won The Telegraph Merchants Cup for a record eighth time. The winning total: 221. 

 Carritt Moran was a distant second with 310. Aditya Khaitan, part of the winning combination of Williamson Magor A, with 72 under par, won the Best Gross Merchants Cup (Individual). 

 After the greens of RCGC, the action shifted to the dance floor at the Oberoi Grand. The party started at 8 pm and continued till midnight.

 If you thought that plagiarism was only synonymous to Anu Malik, Dhwani had a few phoren beans to spill. The band strummed out how from Panchamda to Shankar Jaikishan, Rajesh Roshan to Rahman, all music directors were more than just inspired by western melodies. 

 The presentations over, the band immediately switched to Woh Lamhes and Kaho na Kahos to keep golfers and non-golfers going.

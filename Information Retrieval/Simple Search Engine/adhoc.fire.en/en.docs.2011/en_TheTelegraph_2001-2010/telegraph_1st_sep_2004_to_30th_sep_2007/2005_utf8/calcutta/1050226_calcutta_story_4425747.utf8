Today?s fashion-conscious Calcutta reflects the upbeat 

spirit of the city and is proof of the traditional mastery of its craftsmen

 whenever people are surprised that dowdy old Calcutta is suddenly in fashion focus, I keep reminding them that this image of the city that we ourselves have nurtured within ourselves, has been dictated by its more recent phase of urban decay. And if you do find yourself confronted by a lively revival, count it as another inspiring example of how life bounced back. Our city has its own heritage of fashion consciousness, and within its short three-centuries-old history, has its own landmarks. At the risk of being accused of constantly harking back to the past, I like to remind my friends that a city expresses itself in many ways, and each way is the reflection of a state of mind. Today?s fashion-conscious Calcutta reflects today?s upbeat Calcutta.

Yesterday?s fashion-conscious Calcutta has its own 

legends, like Prince Dwarkanath Tagore, who once had a diamond fixed to his flip-flop 

slippers, so that it would glitter unexpectedly as he crossed his legs on the 

dais, and dangled the required foot during a meeting at the Town Hall. The women 

of the Tagore family of Jorasanko created a major breakthrough when they added 

the blouse for the first time in the thousands of years of the sari?s history. 

Look back at old portraits, and look ahead at sari-clad women throughout the subcontinent 

today, and you will realise what a tremendous sartorial revolution began on the 

narrow by-lane off Chitpur Road. It was adapted from the upper part of the Western 

gown, and since then it has been ? and surely will continue to be for the foreseeable 

future ? a challenge to all our designers. The babus of Calcutta were famous for 

their elegance, and tailors came from all corners of the country to show their 

skills in a market that appreciated excellence, and certainly paid handsomely 

for it.

 Think for a moment about the skill that arrived in Metiabruz in the 19th century, and continues to flourish even in the 21st. Consider the zardozi that comes from ari-workers across the river to our market. Think of the block-makers of Garaanhata who make your exquisite hand-printed saris possible. Incidentally, they also make the moulds for our sandesh. It is no surprise that a Ritu Kumar was born here, and discovered what is now an internationally acclaimed style and its celebrated craftsmen. ?I began with hand-block printers and two tables in a small village near Calcutta,? she reminisces, ?and in the past 28 years, my team of dedicated workers have progressed to produce some of the country?s most exquisite garments and accessories in cotton, silk and leather. These ranges embrace both traditional textile crafts and the lineage of Indian design?. Lose yourself in the narrow lanes around Chitpur or Kumartuli, and you will discover in how many ways our city has still managed to protect its tradition of skills. And it is this tradition that translates itself through the vision and the enterprise of a Ritu Kumar, Sharbari Datta, Anamika Khanna or a Sabyasachi Mukherjee. When the workmanship of the faceless craftsman arrives in Milan from Metiabruz, Calcutta will have travelled a long distance. With skills that can make dreams possible, it is possible to dream. 

 Sharbari Datta proudly asserts that she is a ?revivalist designer? who has been inspired by heritage, and has taken the traditional sherwani, the kurta, and even the dhoti to unexplored heights in style statement. The idea of Bangla calligraphy as design was pathbreaking, but deeply rooted in the Islamic tradition. The audacity of challenging the purity of Bangla poetry thereafter on your kurta was her own hold. It does take that magic of individual talent to make tradition come alive. Datta takes great pride in the fact that ?Calcutta has excelled in politics, art, literature, theatre, dance, music?.? Even when she admits, ?it has been the backyard of fashion?. But there can be no doubt that things have most definitely changed. ?Today, fashion has come a long way, achieved an international profile, created global markets, gained creative recognition. I am proud to be a Calcuttan, for our city is finally on the national and international map?. It is no surprise that artists like Bikash Bhattacharjee, Ganesh Pyne, Paresh Maity, Paritosh Sen, Manjit Bawa and the style guru M.F. Hussain wear her clothes. 

 All that is for men. For the utterly feminine, Calcutta has another tradition to offer through the bridal collection of Anamika Khanna. Today, she clothes young women at their romantic height throughout the world. The fact that she was the only designer to be invited to Pakistan is a reminder of the heritage that we share throughout the subcontinent, from Peshawar to our beloved city ? the beginning and end of the Grand Trunk Road, the beginning and end of many things.

 Tradition has many ways of showing itself. Often it may not contribute directly, but it certainly creates an atmosphere in which creativity flourishes. In the case of fashion, it creates the support teams of craftsmen who can transform a vision into reality. Where would a Kiran Uttam Ghosh or a Sabyasachi Mukerjee be without Calcutta?s consummate abilities with the needle and thread? Even the great sculptors of the world needed the talents of their craftsmen when they cast their creations into bronze. Even though she trained after Jasper Conran in London, what is it that made Kiran Uttam Ghosh set up shop in Calcutta to establish a line that is winning accolades? Apart from the personal reasons, I am sure there must be professional ones too. 

 Like her, Sabyasachi Mukerjee cannot exactly be termed tradition, but he is the new face of Calcutta. A city that inspires thousands of poets who make their presence felt every year at the Book Fair, also inspires the new name on the national marquee. Is it ironic that the designer for Black is the child of a city dedicated to the Black Goddess? If his rise has been quick, certainly the surprise quality of his work has something to do with it. Even its strongest detractors will admit that Calcutta always has, and always will, think differently, whether it is on the Maidan with a flag in your hand or a slim volume of verse, or with scissors and measuring tape. Like a Joy Goswami, a Sabyasachi Mukerjee too certainly inspires the younger generation. Do we not have reason enough to be enthusiastic about the future? 

 I often wonder whether fashion ends with gladrags for the rich and the famous, till Sharbari Datta reminds me of another reality. ?We have mobilised so many talented workers at the grassroots level, and I am happy to have made an effort to upgrade their lives and create earning opportunities. This social responsibility is most meaningful for me ? and that is my fashion statement. Fashion is not only about models and arc lights and profit ?? And in that context I think as well of Bibi Russell, the Dhaka designer who has ushered in a sea-change in the lives of countless Bangladeshi weavers, and craftswomen. She has taught us how to look for beauty not even next door, but within our own homes. In the larger sense, Bibi is as much part of Calcutta as Taslima Nasreen is. And officialese will never have anything to do with it. 

 I am sure that there are many other names I may have missed, many who have already arrived, and many more waiting in the wings. I, for one, welcome them, because they alone will sustain the wave that is sweeping through old dowdy Calcutta. The ramp will increasingly will be a happening space tomorrow, just as it is already today, and Calcutta will continue to make its very own statement in fashion events like Haridra on February 27 where our own designers will let their creativity flow. 

 Like poetry on the Maidan ?.

 Hues of Browns and Black have seldom spun a more vibrant yarn than they have done in the life of our city?s star designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee. After his creations hit the windows of one of the most important addresses in London?s fashion high street last month, the stylist is now riding high on the success of Black, which marks his design debut in films. 

 A visibly elated Sabyasachi spoke at length on his recent achievements and various other fashion-related issues at a Ladies Study Group (LSG) show at the award-winning garden of Bangur House on Friday afternoon.

 The theme for the show was Flower Power and everything from the attire of the audience and the ensembles flaunted on the ramp to even the 12 varieties of roses in Bangur?s garden shouted it out loud. 

 What distinguished the fashion show from any other are the models on the ramp. For, it was some of the members of LSG who did the catwalking, draped in Sabyasachi?s ensembles. 

 Prominent women of various ages paraded in some exquisite saris, salwars and skirts from collections created by the couturier over the years. Women from different walks of life including Sumangala Birla, Padma Jalan, Lee Alison Sibley, Nilu Parekh, Neetu Chauhan, Lovey Burman, vice-president of LSG Anamika Lodha and president Vandana Khaitan, were seen on stage.

 ?All my life I have worked with professional models. So, putting together this show was a stressful task with a lot of nervousness among the participants. But it was a great experience since these are the ladies who represent Calcutta,? felt Sabyasachi.

 The show over with, it was time for the designer to face a volley of questions from the women, led by Rita Bhimani. The topics discussed ranged from Sabyasachi?s Black experience, his international presence and his jewellery designing skills to larger issues like fashion forecasting, trend spotting and the fake designer market.

 Basking in the glory of the resounding success of Black, the designer revealed that the film happened to him ?by fluke?. ?Sanjay Leela Bhansali had seen my work at India Fashion Week and he wanted me to design the costumes for a film called Bajirao Mastani. But that got stalled due to some problems and he just gave me the script of Black and asked me to do the costumes,? he explained. 

 ?At first I was scared because the clothes that I had to do for Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, and the rest of the cast was not at all the kind of work I do normally,? confessed the ace stylist. ?The colour palette here is very muted and the clothes are very subtle. So there was no chance of working with the vibrant colours and embroidery that I usually do. But I decided to go ahead and in a sense, Black was a sabbatical from my regular work.?

 If Black has been his ticket to Bollywood, Browns has opened up more international vistas for Sabyasachi. ?I have been approached by a few agents in Paris and I might even participate in the Paris Fashion Week this year,? he revealed. The designer also faced a rapid fire round of questions from Rita.

 At the end of the show, two lucky ladies ? Padma Jalan and Heena Suraiya ? bagged Sabyasachi saris after they were judged the most elegant on the ramp and the best-dressed member off-stage respectively. The jury comprised actress June, Rita and Sabyasachi himself.

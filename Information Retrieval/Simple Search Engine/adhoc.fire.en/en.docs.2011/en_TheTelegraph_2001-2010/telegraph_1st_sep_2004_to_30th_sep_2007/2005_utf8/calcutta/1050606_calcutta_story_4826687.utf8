 The art of nature

 Focusing on ideas and interpretive imagery rather than on naturalism, the paintings of Amit Banerjee bear the distinctive mark of an artist who seeks to connect life and art in the domain of intellectual perception. Underscoring form, structure and definition in his paintings, the ongoing exhibition of his works, done mainly in oil and acrylic on canvas, is an expression of his innate understanding that mankind is a child of nature. Landscapes, both real and imagined, define his conception of nature as omnipotent on the one hand, and gentle and nurturing on the other. What is interesting about his paintings on nature is that they depict both its order and chaos, its calmness and vibrancy, achieving a fine balance wherein the viewer is encouraged to make his own judgement on nature?s relationship with man.

 It's Your Birthday So...

 If there?s anything close to perfection, it?s probably you. You?re a serious worker once you feel for a cause. Your emotional stability and intellectual capacity give you the competitive edge. Your powerful personality can motivate people. Try to let others learn from their mistakes, rather than guiding them at all times. Taking time off at regular intervals is a good idea. ? Kusum Bhandari

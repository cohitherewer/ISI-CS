 lsquo;I have never done a typical role rsquo;

 You have been raving about Water and its response at the Toronto Film Festival?

 Yes, Water caters to a very different audience than the films we are used to. The movie was loved there at the festival. The Canadians really liked it. Even the film fraternity that was there was appreciative. We have got some great reviews?

 Was it your first major international festival?

 Absolutely. And only when I arrived there did I realise the size and importance of the festival. For Water to actually open a festival as big as the Toronto International Film Festival is a huge achievement in itself. On the day of the screening, I was very curious as an audience (member) and found the film to be beautiful? an example of great, provocative cinema.

 Did you have to unlearn the Bollywood acting style to fit into an international film like Water?

 Not really. Even in Bollywood, I have never done a typical role. I have been called in only when the makers have wanted to try something different. Yash Raj films had never made a film like Dhoom. Dharma Productions have never made a film like Kaal. Look at Jism and Paap ? they, too, are firsts of their kinds. We have never had a negative hero throughout a film like I played in Aetbaar, Karam and Madhoshi. So I have always been in a different category altogether, in terms of acting and intensity. But, of course, in terms of film-making style, Water has been different. Deepa (Mehta) is an extremely sensitive film-maker.

 And she?s cast you in her next international project, too?

 Oh yes, I have got this brilliant role in Komagata Maru. It?s very heroic, almost like Pirates of the Caribbean. I will keep my mouth shut on who will come on board as the producers of the film. But once the deal is finalised, everyone will come to know how big the film will turn out to be.

 Back home, you are spicing up things with Garam Masala?

 I am a complete rock star in Garam Masala. Without sounding like I am promoting the film, let me tell you that this is one really funny film. When I was dubbing for the movie, I used to see these staff people watching portions of Garam Masala whenever they were getting bored. And my chemistry with Akshay Kumar is mindblowing. This is my first time in comedy. People have only known me as a brooding John. Now they will see my funny side. It?s been a very honest performance.

 What was the experience of being on Kaun Banega Crorepati (to be shown on Dussehra)?

 Very nice. Bipasha (Basu) and me were on the episode not to show our intellectual capacity, but for charity. I would go on to say that I went on the show selfishly. It doesn?t matter whether we won 25 lakh or 1 crore or 2 crore. What matters is the fact that the money is going for charity. Honestly, I can demand or command something only when it?s for charity.

 Any plans of celebrating Durga puja with Bipasha?

 I would have loved to but I would be in Ladakh during that time shooting for Kabul Express. I am very excited about the film that is very much like a No Man?s Land. It has a Pakistani actor, an American actress and Arshad Warsi with me, and is being directed by Kabir Khan. The film uses lots of languages like Hindi, American English and even Punjabi Pasthuni.

 You have hordes of releases coming up?

 After Garam Masala, I have two other releases ready ? Milan Luthria?s Taxi No 9211 and Sanjay Gupta?s Zinda. Then there?s Ravi Chopra?s Babul, Kabul Express and also director Shriram (Ek Hasina Thi) Raghavan?s next film.

 Are you playing Bhootnath in Rituparno Ghosh?s Saheb, Biwi Aur Ghulam?

 Rituparno, producer Pritish Nandy and me have mutually consented to me doing the film. But it can turn out to be a logistic problem as my dates have to be matched with the other two actors in the film ? Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra.

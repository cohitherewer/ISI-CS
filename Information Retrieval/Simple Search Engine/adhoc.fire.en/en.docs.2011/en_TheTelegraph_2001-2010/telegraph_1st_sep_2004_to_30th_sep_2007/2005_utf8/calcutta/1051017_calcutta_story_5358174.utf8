 Haute touch to hair styles

 If you thought your style statement was all about just the right kind of clothes and accessories, think again. Be it Bollywood films or models on the ramp, innovation in hair styling for that complete look is the buzzword.

 From frizzy locks to the straight-haired look and from burgundy and blondes to purple hues, experimentation is easily the name of the game, with hair designing fast replacing hairdressing.

 The number of exclusive ramp shows displaying hair trends are fast increasing too. Cases in point: international hair shows like the LOreal Professional Colour Trophy, held earlier this month in Mumbai, and the upcoming Organisation Mondiale Coiffure (OMC) Asia Cup to be held in the same city for the first time on October 18. 

 Being dubbed Hair Olympics, the Asia Cup will be the biggest hairdressing event of the country. It will provide professional hair designers in India the opportunity to showcase their creativiity and match tresses with leading hair designers from all over Asia.

 Hair and beauty expert Blossom Kochhar, who is also the director of OMC India, was in Calcutta recently to talk about this emerging industry. Hair designing is a vital part of the fashion industry today, said Blossom.

 She added: Having travelled the world over to judge and observe many international competitions, I have found that Indian hairdressers and aestheticians have huge talent and capability. They need the right exposure and consciousness.

 No look is complete without proper accesorisation and how you do up your hair can change the way you look, feels Blossom. Just like you mix and match colours in your wardrobe, it is important that you complement your clothes with the right hairdo.

 We see fashion designers trying to complement their clothes with the right kind of hair styles at ramp shows. But that it is more about hairdressing as everything happens backstage. These kind of exclusive hair shows are providing very good platforms to tress experts to showcase their creativity, said the lady of the locks before going on to trend talk.

 Bi-level hair cuts ? long towards the back and short in the front ? is the style of the moment. And though people are going for the straight look, curls and volumes are the rage.

 In terms of colours, purples, burgundy and copper are the hot hues. A note of caution from the expert: it is important that you keep in mind the colour of your skin and eyes before you colour your hair.

 While more and more women are getting adventurous with hair cuts, styles and tones, Blossom is disappointed that most Indian men still prefer to stick to the short, cropped look.

 Itll be a long time before Indian men can be convinced about innovations in terms of hairdos. It is very surprising how despite so many male designers in this field, men are so conscious about the length and cut of their hair, said Blossom, adding on a lighter note: It might actually have something to do with their machismo, which they think diminishes with innovative hair cuts and colours.

 The lady who has been a beauty adviser to many international cosmetic labels feels Calcutta has a lot to offer in the field of hair designing. This is one city where creativity can be found even in the bylanes. But lack of right exposure and initiative often sees the city lagging behind and thats the case even with hair designing. I have, however, seen some of their works and they are really good.

 She singles out Raman Bhardwaj of AN John Hair Studio as the best among the current crop of hair designers. And, of course, there are old-timers like June Tomkyns who will be part of the jury for the OMC finals.

 Indias position, vis-?-vis the global scenario in terms of hair designing, may still be insignificant, but Blossom is hopeful.

 In a few years from now, hair designing will take the country by storm. Through these hair shows, we have already made a beginning and the future looks very very bright.

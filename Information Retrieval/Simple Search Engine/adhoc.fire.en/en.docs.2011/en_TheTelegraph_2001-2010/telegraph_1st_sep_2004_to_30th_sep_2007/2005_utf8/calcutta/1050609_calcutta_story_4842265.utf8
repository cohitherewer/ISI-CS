 A sprinkling of stardust

 Show-stoppers: Malaika Arora Khan with Zayed Khan on stage

 It was an award ceremony for stars, by the people. STAR?s Sabsey Favourite Kaun show at Hyatt, Mumbai, on Sunday was a mix of glitter and glamour. Pratim D. Gupta catches the action?

 Not reel time, not role strength. Sheer star power. That?s the mantra of the annual Sabsey Favourite Kaun awards night, organised by STAR India. So an Aamir Khan is pitted against Shah Rukh Khan in the favourite hero category, although one hasn?t had a release and the other had three blockbusters in 2004. But the star turnout was shining brighter than most prestigious award dos in the country.

 ?The idea is to find out which star is the most popular amongst audiences through votes by SMS and phone calls,? said Peter Mukerjea, CEO, STAR India. ?Last year we received 500,000 votes. This time, the figure has doubled.?

 Before you catch the show on STAR Gold on June 12 at 8 pm, here are some peeks into what went on during the bash.

 The sizzlers

 The mood of the evening was set by singer-turned-actor Kamaal Khan?s medley of songs including Just chill and Laga prem rog from the forthcoming David Dhawan comedy Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya.

 But it was the ladies who struck gold with some stunning acts. The talented Isha Sharvani led the way with a fusion dance to the dulcet melodies of the Kisna soundtrack.

 Bengali beauty Koena Mitra slipped into the smooth satins of Parveen Babi as she paid a fitting tribute to the late actress. Swivelling to songs from Shaan to Namak Halal, Koena took the audience back in time when Parveen?s passion ruled the screen.

 But the show-stopper was the dancing jugalbandi by Malaika Arora Khan and Zayed Khan. In their Vikram Phadnis designer creations, the twosome pranced around to their own hit numbers before causing some dhamaal with the Kaal title track.

 The winners

 There were few categories but many fighting for them. Apart from the top prizes of favourite hero and favourite heroine, three other fiercely-contested categories included favourite naya hero, favourite nayi heroine and favourite comedian.

 Despite stiff opposition from Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani, Paresh Rawal had the last laugh even though he wasn?t present to receive the award. Wife Swaroop Sampat did the honours.

 The naya hero also saw stiff competition between Shahid Kapur and Zayed Khan with the Main Hoon Na dude finally edging out the Fida guy.

 The favourite nayi heroine name went to Ayesha Takia, one of the most sought after young actresses in the industry. The Preitys and Aishwaryas were no match for Bengal?s own Rani Mukherjee, who picked up the favourite heroine award.

 The Salman Khan juggernaut almost dislodged King Khan from the favourite hero slot but Shah Rukh held his ground. A new category, fast rising star, predictably went to Abhishek Bachchan for his on-screen dhoom dhadakas last year.

 Sound byte

 After receiving the award, Rani Mukherjee said: ?I want to thank all my co-stars, especially Shah Rukh and Anil (Kapoor), for teaching me so much and not Abhishek at all because I teach him.?

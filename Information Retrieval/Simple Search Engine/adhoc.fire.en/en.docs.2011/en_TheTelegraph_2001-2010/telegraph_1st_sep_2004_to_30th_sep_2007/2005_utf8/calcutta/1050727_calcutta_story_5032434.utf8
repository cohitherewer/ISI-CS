 Play it safe

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Your little one might be spending hours playing with his or her favourite piece of toy, but have you ever spared a thought to how safe it is? Lovable and attractive, they might hardly be suitable for teething babies to chew on for hours. Even bigger children are not safe from potential toy hazards.

 Toys are an important part of a childs development. They essentially help develop the senses of vision, sound, recognition and hand-eye co-ordination. But care must be taken while shopping for toys. Not only should a childs age always be kept in mind, there are certain other things to watch out for, advises Jayanta Kumar Chakraborty, consultant paediatrician and neonatologist with several city hospitals.

 Toxic trouble

 The first thing that one should look for while toy hunting is non-toxic material. Often toys are made of synthetic materials laced with toxic chemicals. 

 For instance, PVC plastic is very widely used to make toys as their flexible nature lends itself to be moulded into any shape. But the softeners or phthalates present in it can damage the kidney and liver, warn doctors. 

 Chemicals like alkylphenols and organotins present in certain materials can disrupt hormonal functions. Often, paints from toys are transferred to the hands or even mouth of the child. This can lead to poisoning, manifested by frequent vomiting, diarrhoea and other diseases, adds Chakraborty. 

 Certain plastics have dangerous levels of lead and cadmium. While lead damages the nervous system, cadmium can even cause cancer. Licking, sucking or even inhaling could spell danger for your precious one. 

 So, its essential to check that the material is non-toxic before you hand over plastic playthings to your bundle of joy.

 Most reputed toy brands subject their stuff to a series of tests like drop, bite and pull to ensure safety. So its best to go for known brands while buying toys. International labels like Funskool and Fisher-Price offer a host of non-toxic toys. 

 From rattles and teethers for babies to dolls, building blocks, pull-along animals, aeroplanes to big activity tables, the range of non-toxic plastic toys offered by these companies is endless.

 Part peril

 The other major hazard potential lies in detachable small parts. Toys of most big brands come with the warning of removing small parts before handing over the piece to the child.

 Eyes and noses of dolls and stuffed toys, little detachable parts in larger toys and marbles could even prove fatal, say doctors. 

 Small removable parts can cause choking. This could also be the issue with a toy that could break once the child chews on it. Accidents often occur when children put tiny parts in their ears or nose, explains Chakraborty.

 Plus...

 While the above two are the most common causes for toy-related accidents, there are certain other toy troubles to watch out for.

 For instance, one should avoid toys with sharp edges that can cause cuts and scratches. Long strings and chords used mostly in pull-along toys could cause strangulation.

 Propelled objects or flying toys can pose a danger to the childs eyes. Toys with loud noises damage the eardrum. In musical toys from reliable brands, the maximum decibel level is controlled. But the roadside paper trumpets are certainly not suitable for babies.

 Similarly, buying battery-operated toys from roadside vendors is not a good idea since the chemicals present in batteries can prove dangerous if the child licks it. The established brands take care that the child cant reach the batteries easily.

 Do amp; dont

 Next time you go toy shopping, pay close attention to labels reading washable, non toxic, not recommendable for children under three months and so on. Look out for labels in electrical toys that ensure that the electrical parts have been tested for safety. 

 Inspect toys from time to time to determine whether they are broken, or have developed sharp edges. 

 Keep toys of older children away from younger ones. Try and ensure a separate playing space for your kid while indoors.

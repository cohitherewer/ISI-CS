 We might talk a lot about Calcutta?s rising fashion graph, but when it comes to dishing out moolah, cricket and art still score over fashion.

 An auction in aid of tsunami victims, organised by Steve Waugh and Calcutta Foundation at the Oberoi Grand on Thursday evening, established this preference all over again.

 While a stunning Ritu Kumar bridal lehnga managed to fetch only Rs 60,000 (and that too from a Sydney-based Australian), a cricket bat featuring Australian aboriginal art and signed by cricketers from Down Under, was picked up by quiz master Derek ?Brien for Rs 1 lakh, no less. And a similar one followed close at Rs 95,000.

 The evening at the Oberoi Ballroom started off with the lady behind Calcutta Foundation, Shamlu Dudeja, introducing Waugh as ?a cricketer and a friend of the deprived?. She went on to reveal the former Australian skipper?s new role as management guru. This was followed by some management talk from Waugh, in which he highlighted the need for proper management ?to be successful in both business and cricket?. 

 Waugh touched upon various subjects, from larger issues like corporate social responsibility to personal tid bits like the ?favourite red handkerchief? he has been carrying for the past 20 years. Fans were also treated to an audio-visual presentation of his cricketing career. 

 The ball soon rolled from cricket to music when Usha Uthup took over with her group to belt out a few songs she had composed on the tsunami disaster. Apart from soulful numbers like We believe in now, A smile is just a few tears away and Ashbe khushir jowar, what made the rendition special was the coming together of members from various local bands on one platform. The group comprised musicians like Nondon Bagchi, Shayne Hyrapiet, Neel Adhikari and members of Dhwani, Paras Pathar and Fossils, among others.

 The much-awaited auction started quite late, but Barry ?Brien, who donned the auctioneer?s cap for the evening, ensured a speedy affair. The items auctioned included seven bats signed by Australian cricketers, four designer ensembles by Ritu Kumar, Anamika Khanna, Kiran Uttam Ghosh and Shamlu Dudeja, and a host of paintings by artists Paritosh Sen, Suvaprasanna, Sunil Das, Wasim Kapoor, Subrata Gangopadhyaya, Tinku Das and Babita Das.

 Saris designed by Shamlu, Anamika and Kiran, flaunted by actress June, went under the hammer for anything between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000, while the canvases fetched upto Rs 75,000. Apart from the two special bats featuring the aboriginal art, the others were given away at Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000.

 l added up, the auction, along with some donations from Waugh and a few other Australians, managed to garner a little over Rs 30 lakh.

 ?Right after I came to know about the effects of tsunami on December 27 and realised the need for massive aid, the first SMS I sent asking for support was to Steve. I have known him for the past eight years and he has never said ?no? whenever I have asked him to come to the aid of the underprivileged. And like always, this time too he responded with all eagerness,? said Shamlu.

 The eagerness was quite visible on Thursday too, when Waugh strode on to the charity pitch, going to every table showing one of the bats being auctioned and urging the audience to be forthcoming with aid.

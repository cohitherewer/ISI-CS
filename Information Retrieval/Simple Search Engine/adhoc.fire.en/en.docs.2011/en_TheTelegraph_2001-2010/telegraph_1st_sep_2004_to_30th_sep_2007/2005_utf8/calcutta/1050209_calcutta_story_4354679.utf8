 Teenager rescued in Pune

 - Red-light bust yields wife of undertrial facing rape charge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 15-year-old girl was rescued from a red-light area in Pune and brought back to the city on Tuesday by the officials of the detective department. 

 The sleuths from the missing persons squad, who went to Pune to follow up a complaint, also rescued a 32-year-old woman, who is the wife of an undertrial facing a rape charge.

 During the probe, police came to know that the teenager, Mandira Patra, was sold by a woman she had met at Sealdah station in September 2004. ?We are looking for the woman and have asked our plainclothesmen to keep an eye out,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Mandira, a labourer?s daughter from Sonarpur, in South 24-Parganas, had come to Sealdah with her father Dulal on September 27, on her way to a Narkeldanga garment unit, from where she used to take home clothes for sewing. ?Father and daughter parted ways on the platform of the South section,? said an officer.

 A woman in her late 30s, with a child in her lap, came up to her. She asked Mandira to hold the baby while she went to buy a packet of biscuits. In the conversation that followed, Mandira told the woman that she earned barely Rs 150 a week. ?The woman suggested that I join the unit where she worked and assured me an extra Rs 50 per week,? Mandira told police.

 The woman then offered her a glass of lassi from a roadside eatery. ?The lassi was laced. When Mandira regained consciousness, she found herself in the compartment of a long-distance train, surrounded by unknown faces,? said an officer of the missing persons squad.

 According to deputy commissioner Pandey: ?Mandira was taken to a building in Pune. Its nameplate read Juna Welcome. For two weeks, she was tortured and then forced to join the flesh trade.?

 The police put out Mandira?s photographs on the TV. ?The first tip came two weeks ago. Pappu, a circus employee, who was in the city and had met Mandira, called on Anil Mandal, Mandira?s landlord in Sonarpur, and revealed the address of the building where she was confined,? said an officer. ?The second lead came a few days ago from a Pune-based hotel manager.?

 A team rushed to Pune. ?Mandira told us about the another woman, Mabuda Gazi of Joynagar, in South 24-Parganas, who was also in the trade. Mabuda?s husband, Siraj Sardar, is in Alipore jail on a rape charge,? said a sleuth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Calcutta boasts of several new shopping malls now. But a lot of people still 

love to go to markets like Shree Ram Arcade, Treasure Island and AC Market. The 

toilets at Shree Ram Arcade have been in a terrible condition for a while. Not 

only do they stink, the walls and the floors are also extremely dirty. There are 

betel stains on the watercoolers near the toilets. It?s almost shocking that a 

market that does so much to attract customers does not maintain its toilets. I 

wonder why the concerned authorities are turning a blind eye to the problem. 

 Saima Afreen, Topsia. 

 Some of Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s projects defy logic. Three bus passenger 

sheds have been constructed on one side of Elgin Road recently. More are being 

constructed on the other side. However, very few privates buses ply on this road, 

and nor are there that many passengers who use the passenger sheds. It seems that 

the civic body has a major communication gap with the police, public and transport 

operators. 

 Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Mahatma Gandhi Road, right from Burrabazar to Sealdah, is in a deplorable condition. 

The stretch of the road around the College Street intersection is riddled with 

potholes. When the traffic is heavy, serious accidents can happen on this stretch 

any time. The authorities are requested to undertake repair work on a war footing. 

If Calcutta Municipal Corporation or the Public Works Department does not have 

enough manpower to take on the work, they should hand over the responsibility 

to private contractors.

 Naren Sen, Santragachhi. 

 Raja Rammohun Roy was one of the prominent leaders of the Bengal renaissance. 

His statue, that was put up on the Maidan in 1983, is in a pitiable state with 

its boundary walls crumbling in several places. Besides, the streetlights in the 

area do not work, making it impossible for the statue to be seen after dusk. The 

authorities should look into the matter. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia. 

 Even a few years ago, several buses used to ply to Barasat from Shyambazar 

through Jessore Road. Nowadays, 79B is the only regular bus. Buses on routes 79 

and 79C are too few, while those on route DN-18 ply only on a portion of the stretch. 

The transport department should look into the matter, considering the plight of 

the poor and the aged people in the area. 

 Biman Saha, Lake Town.

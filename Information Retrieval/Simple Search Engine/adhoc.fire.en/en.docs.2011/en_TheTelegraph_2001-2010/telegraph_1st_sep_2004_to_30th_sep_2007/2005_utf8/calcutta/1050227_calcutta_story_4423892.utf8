The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of women, for women

 Men are unconcerned. Men are ignorant. 

 Men are not the key target group for the lady in red

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This 

 time i have gone too far. I must confess that I have been 

 fortunate to have a nice guy as my editor. He has been generous 

 enough to allow me to write on anything that even remotely 

 has anything to do with consumers. This column has survived 

 the better part of a full year by sticking to this loose 

 brief. On the 41st Sunday, the inevitable has happened. 

 I have taken on a topic that runs the risk of getting me 

 into trouble. The fact that you are reading these words 

 may indicate that editorial censure has been avoided. But 

 do keep an eye on tomorrow?s obituary column. You never 

 know about women.

 That precisely is the point. Didn?t 

 someone warn many moons ago ? Striyascharitram deba na 

 jananti kuta manushya. My English is bad, my Sanskrit 

 is worse, but someone did tell me that this means ? Gods 

 have not been able to fathom the traits of women, men should 

 not even try. I should have listened.

 This is what started it all. Last 

 Sunday, we were invited to a wedding reception. In the evening 

 I had already worn my dhoti punjabi and was watching 

 the last few scenes of an old Uttam-Suchitra movie. At this 

 juncture, I was asked what turned out to be a crucial question. 

 Should she wear this necklace or the other one? I gave both 

 a glance and made a choice in a few nanoseconds. This is 

 where I made the mistake.

 All hell broke loose. The one 

 I preferred was actually an imitation piece worth a few 

 hundred and the one I rejected not only cost thousands but 

 was bought from a well-advertised jeweller. The next quarter 

 of an hour of Dhishum Dhishum (a la the Pepsodent ad) was 

 the breeding ground of my thoughts and this column.

 The million-rupee question was, 

 why do women wear gold jewellery? Traditional wisdom suggests 

 that it gives her a feeling of security and it makes her 

 look beautiful. This business of security is however debatable. 

 Gold has not been a very encouraging investment for some 

 years now. In any case, gone are the days when gold was 

 the only option of personal asset building for women. Most 

 importantly, the sense of security has to originate from 

 ownership of gold jewellery, not from the flaunting. So 

 the feeling of security cannot be the real reason for wearing.

 That leaves us with the motive 

 of beautification. This is where the confusion starts. Beauty, 

 they say, lies in the eyes of the beholder. Who is the beholder? 

 In marketing terms, does a woman know who her target group 

 is? Shouldn?t she be concerned about how she looks in the 

 eyes of her target group? What is the preference pattern 

 of that target group? Is she positioning herself keeping 

 such preferences in mind? Or is this whole thing an exercise 

 in narcissism? I am not much of a believer of this theory 

 of narcissism. I sincerely believe that this dressing up 

 is for others. I am not prudish enough to suggest that this 

 significant other for women will have to be only the husband 

 ? current, would be or could be. It can justifiably be men 

 in general.

 It can be. But is it? Men are 

 ignorant. Men are unconcerned. Men do not notice. Men are 

 happier with imitation jewellery. And women still wear heavy 

 expensive and obnoxious gold jewellery. QED: men are not 

 the key target group for them. I think women are the target 

 group for women. Ergo, most women are interested in most 

 women.

 This is the conclusion I had shared 

 with her last Sunday. I had to cook my own dinner. And eat 

 it alone. I told you, men are not the target group.

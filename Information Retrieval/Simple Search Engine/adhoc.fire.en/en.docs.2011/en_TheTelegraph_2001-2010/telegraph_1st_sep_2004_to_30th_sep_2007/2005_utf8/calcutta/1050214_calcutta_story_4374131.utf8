 Sandip Banerjee: There are many popular hangout spots like the Maidan, Park Street, Victoria Memorial sand Eden Gardens in the area under your jurisdiction. Visitors to these places are often disturbed by criminals and prostitutes, especially after sundown. Are you doing anything to counter the problem?

 We are aware of criminal activities at popular hangouts and have started patrolling the areas on bicycles to check the problem. We also patrol such spots on motorcycles and jeeps. Besides, personnel manning our mobile outposts keep an eye on the sensitive areas. In case you face any trouble at these spots, inform the police immediately by dialling 100 and specify your location. We will inform the nearest patrolling officer, so that he can assist you. In order to curb harassment of people at bus stops by sex workers, we have stepped up cycle patrolling in the Park Street and adjoining areas.

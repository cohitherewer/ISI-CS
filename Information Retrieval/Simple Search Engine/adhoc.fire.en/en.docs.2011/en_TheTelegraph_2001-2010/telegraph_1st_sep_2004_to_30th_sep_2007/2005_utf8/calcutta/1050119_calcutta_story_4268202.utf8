 Mayor mulls Manila-model slum supply

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 About two million gallons of filtered water, valued at over Rs 10,000, flow down the drain every day in over 5,000 slums in the city. 

 Reason: 98 per cent of the roadside water outlets (stand-posts, in the civic parlance) are nothing but open-end pipes.

 Slum-dwellers had broken the taps almost immediately after they were installed to ensure round-the-clock supply. 

 And this rampant waste of water takes place with the active backing of a section of councillors, who insist on installation of more such outlets and stymie any effort to levy user charges. 

 According to a civic estimate, ward 14 has the maximum number of stand-posts (402) in the city proper, followed by wards 14 (402), 91 (332) and 69 (330). 

 In the added areas, ward 108 ranks first, with 300 stand-posts, followed by wards 139 (291) and 140 (282).

 With the civic polls only four months away, a section of councillors from both the ruling Trinamul Congress and the Opposition CPM are demanding door-to-door supply of water in the slums. 

 But mayor Subrata Mukherjee, instead, is considering an experiment with the Manila model. 

 It will provide the civic body with an opportunity to earn revenue by selling water and extend support to the poor.

 Under the model, some of the stand-posts in the slums will be distributed among widows and those who are extremely poor or incapable of working. They will sell water through ?flexible pipes? to households applying for direct supply. 

 The rate will be fixed by the civic authorities and the vendor, or the individual operating a stand-post, will get a commission from the daily collection of water charges.

 The vendor?s duty will be to connect a ?flexible pipeline? to the nearest stand-post and disconnect it after an interval.

 ?Several slum-dwelling families are now capable of paying for water,? said chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury. ?A civic survey reveals that over 80 per cent of the families have cable TV connections and fans.? 

 Roychaudhury blamed the excessive number of stand-posts in the slums for the poor supply of filtered water to households that regularly pay taxes to the civic body.

 ?The wastage would not have taken place if the stand-post taps had not been dismantled or if people had bothered to close the tap after collecting water,? said mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee.

 ?Technically, a stand-post means a puncture in the water main, causing a fall in pressure in the supply network. Hence, 17,000 stand-posts mean as many punctures in the water mains,? said a water supply engineer.

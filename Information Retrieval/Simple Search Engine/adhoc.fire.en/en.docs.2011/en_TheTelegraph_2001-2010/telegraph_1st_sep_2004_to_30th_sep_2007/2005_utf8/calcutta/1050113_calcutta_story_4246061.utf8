The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Surgeon with fake marksheet held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The fake marksheet scandal took a medical turn on Wednesday with the arrest of a practising ?doctor? accused of joining the profession with false academic credentials.

 ?Mohammad Salamat Ali, 36, was arrested at his NS Road residence in Behala this morning,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (I), detective department.

 According to a senior officer of the detective department, Ali had been working at a private nursing home in the Entally police station area for the past year.

 He had secured the job after submitting copies of his MBBS and MS (Master of Surgery) certificates, which were later found to have been forged.

 On several occasions, Ali had assisted senior surgeons in the operating theatre of the nursing home. During surgery, his behaviour and actions had led some of his colleagues to suspect his credentials as a doctor.

 When the nursing home authorities were alerted about Ali?s deviations from surgical procedure, his track record was put under the scanner.

 It turned out that Ali had earlier worked in a reputed private hospital in south Calcutta, apart from having quite a private practice around town.

 The authorities then took a closer look at the photocopies of the documents Ali had submitted to prove his credentials.

 Smelling a rat ? or rather, a racket ? the hospital authorities wrote to Calcutta University, seeking a check and confirmation of whether Ali had, indeed, passed his MBBS and MS examinations from National Medical College, as his documents showed.

 A letter was also sent to the Medical Council of India. 

 Both the apex bodies wrote back saying they had no record of Ali having been enrolled with any of the MBBS or MS courses offered by recognised institutions.

 Calcutta University registrar Ujjwal Kumar Basu lodged a formal complaint with the detective department at Lalbazar on January 8, on the basis of which Ali was apprehended on Wednesday.

 He was produced in Sealdah court, and subsequently remanded in police custody till January 18.

 During interrogation, Ali confessed that his MS certificate was forged, but stuck to his claim that he had cleared the MBBS examination from National Medical College.

 ?We are conducting a thorough probe to ascertain whether there is any truth in Ali?s claim,? deputy commissioner Pandey said.

 The fake marksheet racket is like the metaphorical closet, with one skeleton after the other tumbling out. A sizeable number of beneficiaries of such fake documents are successfully engaged in various professional fields.

 Recently, 20 lawyers found themselves in a spot for practising as legal counsel with fake bar council certificates. A detective department officer said separate FIRs had been lodged against eight of them during the probe.

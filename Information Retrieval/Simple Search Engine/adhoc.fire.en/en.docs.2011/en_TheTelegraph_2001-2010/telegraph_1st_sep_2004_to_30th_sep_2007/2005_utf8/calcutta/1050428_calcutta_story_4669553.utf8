 Whose road is it anyway: A tram track in 

disrepair 

 The indefinite ceasework by employees of the Shibpur 

Botanical Gardens is most unfortunate (Indefinite strike cripples garden, April 

9). 

 The state government is trying its best to improve work culture in West Bengal. It wants employees to be settle their problems across the table. But those taking part in the ceasework, including employees belonging to the trade union wings of Left Front parties, do not seem believe in this theory. 

 While people are desperately trying to save trees and plant more saplings, the ceasework might have a ruinous effect on the tree population. 

 Not watering plants is definitely harmful for them, especially for the ones in the nurseries. Suspension of work of this nature is tantamount to the murder of the trees. Shouldn?t this work be regarded as essential service? 

 It is, however, true that for proper care and protection of the trees in the garden, shifting duties will be more helpful. 

 The trees need to be watered in the morning and evening. So 10 am is not a suitable time to start work for those engaged in watering plants. A morning shift is necessary. Employees in the day shift may look after the plants in the evening. 

 Proper vigilance is needed at night to ensure that the trees in the garden are not cut or stolen by outsiders. The authorities need to consider the demand for shifting duties carefully. But before that, negotiations need to be started and the ceasework withdrawn at the earliest. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

Apropos the report ?Killer tracks take a toll?, April 4, the stand-off between the government and Calcutta Municipal Corporation over the repair of tram tracks defies belief. As the perilous condition of the roads causes one fatal accident after another, the government and the civic body are remaining mute spectators. Both are morally responsible for the deaths due to lack of maintenance of city roads. Have the authorities lost all human virtues? It is really sad that the elected representatives of the people are evading their responsibilities on one pretext or another. 

Rabindra Nath Kar,

Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

The government is selectively ignoring roads when 

it comes to repairs, and the whole of north Calcutta sadly falls in the overlooked 

territory. Important roads in College Street, Sealdah, Chitpur and Rabindra Sarani 

are in a state of disrepair. Light vehicles are forced to avoid these roads for 

fear of damage, thus causing traffic snarls elsewhere. It seems that the lives 

of common are of no value to ministers. What if a tram rams into a minister?s 

car on one of these roads? May God forbid that, but hopefully the civic body will 

then sit up and take notice. 

Sharmi Adhikary, 

Gorachand Road. 

The report ?Rs 5 lakh for loss of limb?, April 7, is an indicator of the sorry state of healthcare in West Bengal. Earning money has become the sole aim of doctors. The verdict will force doctors to be more careful and attentive to patients in future. My sister is a victim of wrong treatment. She lost her speech in the 70s due to the negligence of her doctor. We were not aware of our rights, so the culprit got away. It is wonderful that people have become conscious of their rights. Harsher laws are needed to prevent doctors from toying with the lives of patients. 

Debyani Basu, 

Birati 

The slap of a Rs 5 lakh fine on a orthopedic surgeon 

for ?medical negligence? might be the ?first? such blow to the hitherto untouchable 

medical community in West Bengal, but it must not be overlooked that the process 

took more than a decade. Make no mistake, given the state of the Indian consumer 

courts, another decade and more may pass through appeal and re-appeal by the wealthy 

physician before the Roy family sees a rupee of this five lakh. But for the convicted 

surgeon, life is likely to continue as before. Is this justice? 

Dr Kunal Saha, 

Ohio, USA.

Apropos the report ?Realtor bleeds, goons rule?, April 8, such incidents have become commonplace. It appears that it is sheer stupidity to go to police or approach the administration for protection. They are corrupt at all levels. 

Hemanta Kumar Datta,

Shibpur.

Apropos the report ?Build below to rise above?, April 5, the dream project of mayor Subrata Mukherjee is overdue. The New Market face-lift would help the city of joy shed its image of squalor. Let?s hope that the project sees the light of day. 

Rajdeep Guha,

Howrah. 

Apropos the report ?Frauds held at Sealdah?, April 8, the authorities should investigate who among the employees were hand in glove with the frauds. The employees are tarnishing the image of the railway. 

Sourish Misra,

Salt Lake. 

Apropos the report ?119 posts of judges filled in law leap?, April 7, the decision would help in clearing some of the pending cases. So far, the state government had maintained a lackadaisical attitude in this regard. 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road.

It is shameful that such an incident took place in Soumendranath Tagore?s house (Takeover Tagore school seeks CM help, April 8). 

Anil Kumar Sen, 

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.

Apropos ?Time not ripe for terminal?, March 24, no reporter spoke to us. Subhas Ranjan Thakur, who has been quoted, is no longer the chief operations manager of Eastern Railway. The information that Rs 100 crore has already been spent on the development of Chitpur terminal is wrong. The total cost of the project is Rs 90.54 crore and to date, about Rs 16 crore has been spent. We hope to complete Phase I by October 2005. 

S. Majumdar, 

Chief Public Relations Officer, 

Eastern Railway.

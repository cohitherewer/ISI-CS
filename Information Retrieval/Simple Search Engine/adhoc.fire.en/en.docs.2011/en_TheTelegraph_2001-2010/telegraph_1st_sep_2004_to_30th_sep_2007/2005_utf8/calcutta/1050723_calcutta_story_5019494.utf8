The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Big worry for the little ones

Away in Islamabad, south Asia united for a cause ? to 

save its children from violence, says Brendan MacCarthaigh

Three days dedicated entirely to efforts for improving 

the lots of our children. We, that is delegates from the whole of south Asia ? 

Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka 

? had converged on Pakistan for the Islamabad Consultation on Violence against 

Children, south Asia region under the umbrella of Unicef.

Five NGOs from India were invited to participate in 

this international consultation from May 19 to 21 in Islamabad. Other than myself 

from Serve, there were representatives from ICCW, Chennai, Adwait Foundation, 

Mumbai, HAQ, Delhi and India Alliance For Child Rights, Delhi. The meet was part 

of Unicef?s preparation for a world report for and from the UN in 2006. Though 

human resources minister Arjun Singh did not make it, the government of India 

had also sent a strong delegation. Rita Panicker, director of Batterfly, and Prof 

Madhava Menon, director of National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, were there as resource 

persons. So, we made a team of about 20. 

It was uplifting to encounter so many people deeply 

concerned about, and involved in responding to the evils that necessitated this 

consultation. But it was daunting to encounter the dimensions of the task ahead. 

SERVE?s presence was testimony to the recognition that our system of education 

is an important response to one aspect of this painful scenario ? the suffering 

of children in classrooms throughout south Asia. 

In India, we inaugurate functions by lighting the 

diya, an act of worship in itself. In Islamic countries, appropriate verses from 

the Quran are intoned. For our Consultation, this was done by a blind boy 

of 10, who paused after each phrase and gave every impression of interiorising 

each of them, and allowing those who understood Arabic to interiorise them also. 

Even for me, not understanding the words, it was moving. 

It was moving also to have present there children 

from all the South Asian region ? except India. The other children drew attention 

to this, and in the full session expressed disappointment. We had egg on our faces. 

Those children had plenty to say, and had good ideas that were welcomed and tabled 

among the resolutions to which the central body would later give more detailed 

attention. 

At one micro-session one of the Pakistani girls ? 

of about 12 ? asked her companion to translate into Urdu whatever I was saying. 

So, to help out, I spoke in my rather lame Hindi. She congratulated me on my Urdu! 

The earlier sessions of the gathering trod familiar 

territory ? the sort of violence our children suffer. It happens that I am also 

a member of International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, 

and have been working in CINI Asha among street children, platform children and 

child labourers. So much of the presentations in the area of anti-child violence 

was wearily familiar territory to me. I do not mean boring, but only saddening. 

When it came to each country making its own presentation, the India picture came 

across as rather rosy ? nothing was really wrong in the state of Denmark. But 

as a grass-roots worker myself, I found I could not endorse the opinion of the 

speaker. Of course, in a multinational setting I did not air those misgivings, 

but I did quietly mention to our team leader a piece in a Delhi paper of May 16, 

to the effect that of all the children in India joining school, more than 90 per 

cent drop out before reaching Class X. I do not think she was convinced. 

Indeed, it must be admitted that we have as a country 

done a great deal at the level of legislation and administration to counteract 

the violence to which our children are subjected. On the ground, those laws and 

administrative injunctions seem not to be known. Nor observed. 

The topic was subdivided into family violence, child 

labour, streetchildren violence, child trafficking, sexual violence, school violence, 

institutional violence (foster-homes, detention centres and the like), and children 

in conflict situations (delinquency and its offshoots). The whole topic of corporal 

punishment came under withering fire. Case histories emerged of parents endorsing 

corporal punishment within their own homes (?it?s ok as long as no bones are broken?, 

one father of a girl insisted), and teachers in school (caning, belting, kicking 

and bruising while the rest of the class sat, mute). 

The issue of child labour is an old one, and provoked 

a few sighs of ?this again!? from a number of the delegates ? myself included. 

Not because we thought it irrelevant ? no way ? but because we wondered when would 

this issue be resolved. 

I have seen Calcutta kids with twisted thumbs because 

the scissors they used to cut the rubber chappals was simply too heavy for their 

little hands; kids with weakened eyesight because the carbon from the batteries 

they break all day to make a living keeps getting in their eyes; and so on. On 

the one hand, you want to say ?Stop this!?, but on the other hand, the few rupees 

the child gets contributes towards the household upkeep. There are a thousand 

such stories within our own West Bengal society, to go no farther afield.

The first law is survival, and streetchildren develop 

violent streaks in order to protect themselves against one another and against 

their most consistent oppressors, the police. I feel sad to write this, because 

there are many in the police who actually work for the kids ? but they?re a minority. 

Others extort money, sexual favours, and pursue the sheer pleasure of sadism in 

torturing our street kids when they?ve nothing more interesting to do. 

Statistically, child trafficking has become a more 

and more serious problem in our country. We do hear of successes ? children taken 

back from brothels, from camel-rider sales, from pornography centres ? but alas, 

the proportion is minimal compared with the market. And while we might on the 

one hand excoriate the parents of children for actually selling them for a thousand 

or less rupees, one must also see that the parents are at their wit?s end as to 

how to support the children in the event of terrible poverty. 

All this was detailed, bemoaned, and thrown back to 

us at the Islamabad Consultation as items to be worked at, to be improved, if 

our children are to be rescued from horror.

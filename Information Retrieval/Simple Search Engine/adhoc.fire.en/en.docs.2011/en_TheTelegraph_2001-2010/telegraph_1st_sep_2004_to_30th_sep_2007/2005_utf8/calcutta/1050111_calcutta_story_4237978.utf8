The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CSTC on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) has lined up a series of measures this year to remodel the structure and the working of the body.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told Metro that efforts are on to overhaul the ?ailing corporation?. 

 ?We have already taken some measures to improve the work culture in the corporation,? he added. 

 Controller of legal metrology Ashok Bhattacharya, of WBCS 1979 batch, will take over as CSTC managing director next month, replacing Sukumar Bhattacharya. Officials at Writers? Buildings said Sukumar Bhattacharya, who has been promoted to the rank of IAS, will join as joint secretary in the land and land reforms department.

 Ashok Bhattacharya, busy in his office on Monday clearing pending files, held out an assurance that 200 new buses will hit city roads by March. 

 ?We have been granted Rs 27 crore by Allahabad Bank for five years to purchase 280 buses, of which 80 are already plying,? he added. 

 At present, the corporation plies around 800 buses, including 260 long-distance buses, in the city and in the districts. 

 ?Though it involves a huge expenditure, we have started renovating old cars so that they can conform to Euro II norms,? he said.

 Meanwhile, Calcutta State Transport Employees? Union, controlled by the CPM?s labour arm Citu, has decided to go on an agitation on Tuesday demanding employment of 600 drivers and conductors to man the new buses. 

 Union general secretary Narayan Saha complained that the management is delaying purchase of the buses, though a bank loan has already been sanctioned.

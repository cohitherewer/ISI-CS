 The pain from the past

 Chile to Mizoram is a long journey for a story to evolve. With Northeast unrest and peace agreements on the canvas, Dansh carries only a whiff of Ariel Dorfman?s Death and the Maiden or Roman Polanski?s adaptation of the play. Yet, the link trails Dansh, its debutant director Kanika Verma and writer-producer Anish.

 As a theatre artiste, Anish had worked on the play before toying with the idea of setting the screenplay in Mizoram. His familiarity with the Northeast milieu ? Anish had been a Guwahati-based journalist before he moved to Delhi to do theatre ? prompted him to explore Mizoram and weave in its political context. 

 ?It is the only state that has transitioned to peace from militancy. But with Mizoram as the backdrop, the characters changed and so did the situations. Now, it?s a story of personal revenge and social peace... Dansh means the pain that recurs from an old wound,? said Anish.

 Set against the backdrop of militancy and the 1986 peace accord in Mizoram, the Talking Pictures film revolves around revolutionaries Mathew (Kay Kay), his wife Maria (Sonali Kulkarni) and a doctor (Aditya Shrivastava) who Maria thinks had raped her in the army camp. ?I wanted to see the psychological impact of the peace accord in the three main characters. It?s not a political film, per se; it has the undercurrents of politics. It?s more about human relationships,? says Kanika about her debut feature film.

 Literally meaning ?sting?, Dansh is slated to release on September 2. The film was shown at Osian Cinefan festival in Delhi, Palm Springs Film Festival and Bangkok Film Festival.

 Shades of darkness

 With Dil Chahta Hai, Agnivarsha and Bride amp; Prejudice, Sonali Kulkarni has shown enough versatility. Yet, the role of the rape victim and revolutionary wasn?t something she could do without some homework. ?Playing Maria was tricky for me. I had to make sure that the character didn?t get monotonous. I didn?t want her to be vengeful because she is a sensible girl. I had discussions with Kanika which helped me maintain a degree of dignity in Maria,? said Sonali.

 Thanks to the Sony TV serial CID, Aditya Shrivastava brings home his screen image of a sharp sleuth on the trail of criminals. The majority of his film roles, often with the hint of the negative ? from Satya to Deewar and Ek Hasina Thi ? have only accentuated his ?intense? image. Adding one more dark shade to his career profile is the doctor?s character in Dansh. ?I think my personality suits such roles. For me, the length is not so important. What matters is the script. Dansh is a compact one-night story,? says Aditya, with a background in amateur theatre.

 Musical note

 Though the shutterbugs were trained at Sonali, the crowd at Crossword on Wednesday evening swung towards Kailash Kher, who got singing with Fazal Qureishi on the tabla. 

 ?I was born in Mumbai three years ago as a playback singer,? smiled Kher, before rendering a track from Dansh and following it up with Allah ke bande and Mangala Mangala. For Dansh, Qureishi, the youngest son of Ustad Alla Rakha, has set Nida Fazli?s lyrics to tune while assimilating the tone of the place and the people.

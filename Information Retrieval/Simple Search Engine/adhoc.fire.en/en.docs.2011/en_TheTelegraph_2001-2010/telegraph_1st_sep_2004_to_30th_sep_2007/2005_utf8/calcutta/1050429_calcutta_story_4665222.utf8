 Doctors in face-off 

over new institute

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Weeks before the showdown between physicians Sukumar Mukherjee and Kunal Saha gets underway in the Supreme Court, the two doctors are involved in a confrontation over a new medical institute, headed by Mukherjee.

 Saha, who had charged Mukherjee with negligence leading to the death of his wife Anuradha over a decade ago, has approached the Medical Council of India (MCI) with another complaint against the veteran doctor.

 The NRI doctor ? founder and president of People for Better Treatment, an organisation that fights medical negligence ? has alleged that the newly-formed Indian Institute for Medical Technology (IIMT) does not have the necessary permission from the MCI. 

 ?There is no denying that there is legal as well as moral obligation for any new medical institute to obtain permission from the appropriate division of the MCI before offering any course or training module for doctors. However, IIMT never obtained the required permission from the MCI before opening or offering medical courses for doctors,? Saha has stated in his complaint to the medical council. 

 He also said in his complaint that since Mukherjee will stand trial in the apex court, he must be removed as president of IIMT.

 The high court had earlier acquitted the veteran doctor in the negligence case.

 C.K. Chatterjee, secretary and convener of IIMT, said the institute was started after clearing all legal hurdles.

 ?Kunal Saha spoke to me from the US. I told him that we would not remove Mukherjee or ask him to resign. Saha might not know that permission from the MCI is not mandatory for starting a certificate course for doctors. We are not awarding any degree or diploma,? Chatterjee added.

 ?We got in touch with the government and there does not seem to be a problem on the legal front,? he continued.

 IIMT, which is located in Joka, offers a three-month certificate course for doctors in handling of medical equipment.

 Recently, a mannequin was brought to the institute from the National Medical College and Hospital for practical classes.

 ?Our focus is to show doctors, especially the younger group, better ways to handle crisis and improve healthcare, especially in critical situations,? said Chatterjee.

 The course teaches doctors the correct ways to handle ECG, multi-parameter monitor, pulse oxymeter, defibrillator and ventilator, among a host of other equipment.

 The faculty of IIMT comprises heads of departments of various hospitals.

 ?We have tried to rope in the best available doctors for the course. We simulate critical situations to help doctors deal with them better in real life,? Chatterjee signed off.

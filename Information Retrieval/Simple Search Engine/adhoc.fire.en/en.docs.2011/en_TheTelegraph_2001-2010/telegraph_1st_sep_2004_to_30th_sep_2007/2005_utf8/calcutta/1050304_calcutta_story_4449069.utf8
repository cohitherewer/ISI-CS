 Water bill to square off dues

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 In an attempt to ward off pressure from the state government to square up dues worth Rs 390 crore to the Garden Reach waterworks, the city civic authorities on Thursday announced their decision to charge money for supplying filtered surface water to six municipalities. 

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) supplies filtered water to North Barrackpore, Baranagar, Cantonment, Salt Lake and Dum Dum and, unofficially, to Mahestala municipalities. 

 The CMC gets a daily supply of 70 million gallons from the Garden Reach waterworks, run by the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA). The CMWSA has recently slapped a bill of Rs 378 crore on the CMC as price for the filtered water.

 Excepting North Barrackpore municipality, the CMC has never charged any municipality for supplying water.

 Around four years ago, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had decided to charge Rs 3 for every kilolitre of filtered water supplied to North Barrackpore municipality, after it demanded Rs 9 lakh as property tax from the CMC for setting up its waterworks at Palta. 

 After the municipal authority appealed to the CMC to charge less for the filtered water, the CMC stopped paying property tax to the North Barrackpore municipality. 

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said: ?The mayor had promised to cough up at least Rs 50 crore from the money he collected through the waiver-of-interest scheme. In the two waivers, the CMC had earned a total of Rs 280 crore.?

 Mayor Mukherjee, however, described the state government and the CMWSA?s demand as unethical and politically motivated.

 He said: ?The CMC never promised to pay for the supply from the Garden Reach waterworks.?

 He stressed: ?I will not pay a paisa till the state government gives the CMC its annual share of Rs 300 crore from the collection of motor vehicles tax.?

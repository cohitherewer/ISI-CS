 Wise ways for workout zone

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui principles, a gym 

 should be located in the west or north-west sectors 

 of a building since these are the directions ruled by 

 the metal Chi. The north-east should be specifically 

 avoided since this is a peaceful and serene zone and 

 hence a gym with heavy metallic equipment will disturb 

 the tranquility of this area 

 Q: I own a call centre 

 and the work in my office goes on round the clock. I would 

 like to provide my employees with some means of de-stressing 

 that will energise them. I have a vacant room in the north-east 

 and would like to set up a gym here. Please let me know 

 if this is in accordance with Feng Shui rules. 

 S. Dutt

 The 

 Solution: The workforce in an office that has lots 

 of computers is always under stress as the machines emit 

 unhealthy electromagnetic radiation. Setting up a gym is 

 a good idea, but a north-east room is the storehouse of 

 cosmic Chi and spiritual power and hence a very peaceful 

 and serene zone. A gym with heavy metallic equipment in 

 this area will disturb the tranquillity of this calm zone. 

 I would suggest that instead of a gym, you should convert 

 this room into a meditation corner, which will not only 

 de-stress your employees, but also help them stay focused 

 and stable. However, if you are very keen on a gym, go for 

 the west or north-west sections that are ruled by metal 

 Chi.

 Office space

 Q: Our office has a 

 very large boardroom. Previously, the entry was from the 

 south-east and the chairmans seat was in the south, 

 close to the entrance. Due to renovations in the office, 

 the door had to be shifted to the north-east. However, we 

 have not yet changed the chairmans position and he 

 has to walk the entire length of the boardroom, from the 

 north-east entrance to the southern corner, to reach his 

 seat. 

 We are planning to rearrange 

 his chair near the north-east entrance to make him more 

 comfortable. However, he is a little apprehensive about 

 the new arrangement because his decisions taken from the 

 present position have done wonders for the company. Please 

 advise.

 Sanjukta Poddar

 The 

 Solution: Dont shift his chair from the present 

 location at any cost. In the current arrangement, the chairman 

 faces the north, which is favourable for attracting business. 

 Also, dont change the entrance from the north-east 

 since divine energy flows from this direction. If his chair 

 is repositioned in the north, he will have his back towards 

 the north-east entrance and that will be very harmful for 

 him. He will have his back turned away from the blessings 

 of god and, secondly, he will face a lot of back-stabbing 

 since he has his back towards the entrance.

 Welcome note

 Q: I have redesigned 

 all the rooms of my house according to Feng Shui principles. 

 Only the guestroom is left. I would like to know how I should 

 go about doing up this room. It is in the north-west section 

 of the house and right now is in bad shape with most of 

 the clutter of the house dumped here.

 Beena Bhardwaj

 The 

 Solution: North-west is the best location for a guestroom. 

 This room should not be in a projected part of the house, 

 which will give the guests a feeling of seclusion. It is 

 often seen that the guest bedroom gets the leftover furniture 

 and house discards. This should be strictly avoided and 

 this room should be done up with the same amount of love 

 and interest that you have taken to decorate the rest of 

 your house. Lend a feeling of warmth by placing fresh flowers 

 and a chocolate hamper in the north-west sector of your 

 guestroom just before the guests arrive. You can also place 

 a welcome note or card that expresses sweet sentiments. 

 Your guests will pleasantly remember this extra bit from 

 your side.

 Luck lustre

 Q: I am a chemical engineer 

 (DOB August 24, 1972) and am currently employed in a large 

 multinational IT organisation. I have 14 lucky bamboo plants 

 growing in a vase in the southern part of my house, a crystal 

 hanging from the window in the south-east and a toad in 

 the north-east. Do I have to add anything to the collection 

 or alter the positions?

 Sanjib Manna

 The 

 Solution: If you want to add more bamboo shoots in 

 your house, they can be placed in the east, south-east and 

 south-west for luck in health, wealth and marriage respectively. 

 Crystals can be hung from any window that gets direct sunlight 

 to magnify the energy entering your house. Toads, symbolic 

 of prosperity, are usually placed near the entrance, facing 

 into the house. You can also place a figure of a rat in 

 the north-east to increase your intuitive powers.

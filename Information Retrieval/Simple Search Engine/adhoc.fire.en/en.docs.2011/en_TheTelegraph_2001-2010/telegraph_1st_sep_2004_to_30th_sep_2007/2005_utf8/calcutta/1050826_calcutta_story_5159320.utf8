 The great divide

 While some kids have the joy of celebrating festivals, others don rsquo;t even know what childhood means, nor do they get the basic necessities of life

 What?s on your mind this week

 TT trouble

 Indian football is like a stream, searching for its source. Yet, efforts on the part of the officials are constantly on to improve standards, at least on paper. But although table tennis is a game in which India (especially Bengal) produces a host of talents every year, it is neglected. The recently concluded Patterson Trophy (an inter-school tournament) bears testimony to this fact. A galaxy of young stars emerged from the tournament. But this resurgence of fresh talent will fade, like every year. The table tennis officials spend less time thinking about the game and more time on court cases. These youngsters will play for Bengal in the national championship. But it will be quite impossible for them to represent India, despite having the talents to do so. The Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA) organises tournaments and selects the Bengal team. But to represent India from Bengal, one has to take coaching under Sports Authority of India?s (SAI?s) Centre for Excellence, which has a link with the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI). However, the selection of the national TT team is not always honest. As a result, we lack good performances at the international level. Since the BTTA normally does not allow SAI trainees to represent Bengal, the state team rarely performs well. What is the reason behind this conflict? A senior source from SAI told me: ?We believe the BTTA executes its projects dishonestly. So we want to establish the paramount authority in Bengal table tennis.? Gopinath Ghosh, secretary of the BTTA, countered: ?It?s they who believe in unfair activities. We are the parent body in Bengal for over three decades. You cannot change history.? Hearing the opinions of the two bodies, Diptimoy Mukherjee, Bengal coach and former national coach, said: ?The impact of this conflict is immense on Bengal and Indian table tennis. We the players and the coaches are the suffering lot.? It is the players? achievements that make us proud of our country. But what will they do in the midst of this chaos and anarchy?

 Admission alarm

 The first day of college is special for every student. For a friend of mine, Neha Agarwal, the first day of her college career at a prominent south Calcutta college was not one to cherish. It was one of the first colleges in the city to declare its admission lists, and Neha got in. But when she walked into class for the first lecture, she was called to the office and told that her admission was being cancelled. There had been some error in the procedure and they had only just noticed that she did not have the proper subject combination in her HS that the college required for her honours course. Neha?s arguments and pleas fell on deaf ears. By this time, all colleges had completed their admissions and most had started classes. It would be virtually impossible for her to make it into another good college. When her parents went to speak to the principal the next day, they were not entertained and the officials demanded that her marksheet be produced on which they would stamp ?admission cancelled? following which she would be refunded the admission fees. After much persuasion, the principal met them. She said the college was in no position to help, and even refused to transfer Neha to another course since admission was over. After much pleading, she promised to recommend Neha to another college, which she still hasn?t done. Neha is still searching.

The dependency of love and hate

 Hate can conquered by love only 

 Love only can be conquered by hate. 

 Every head held high 

 Is towards a darkened night sky. 

 Every obstacle overcome 

 May have little secrets undone. 

 Fear overpowered 

 But shivering stars. 

 In darkness I see sparks 

 But a handful of stars. 

 In brilliance of art, 

 Reds rule, blacks reign. 

 Great poetry too 

 Talks of un-nice, of pain. 

 Wars over, victories won, 

 Mutilated bodies, lives undone. 

 I quiver with pain, 

 As ink falls on paper. 

 Bitter words though, 

 I hold ?em close to my heart?

 Juvenile justice

 The sight was terrible and utterly disgusting. It was 9 am on August 24. A boy of nine years was fastened to the railing of the park at Kashi Dutta Street. To add insult to injury, he was naked. People flocked around him, shouted abuses and threatened him, while the child looked around helplessly. The parar lok insulted his parents and they remained confined to their home, shedding tears of agony and pain. 

 This is how the people of ward 20 punished Vicky, whose father is a cycle-van driver. He was allegedly caught red-handed stealing a cassette player from an auto-rickshaw. 

 The owner of the property showed no interest in the matter. But members of the club Tarun Milan Sangha and a few others decided to teach the child a lesson. The bhadralok of the locality didn?t have the courage to protest. Some gathered around pointing fingers at the child and discussing the gravity of his crime. 

 I was preparing for my next day?s maths exams when I was informed. I rushed to the site with my father. Later, my father had a very bitter argument with the gang that stood there and prevented us from getting the boy down. The giggles and remarks of the people made the boy stare blankly. He was too embarrassed to weep or speak. 

 I informed the nearby Nagorik Committee. But one of them calmly explained that it would be foolish to hand over the child to the police who may treat him more cruelly. This man, like the others, thought the para people were the best candidates to dispense justice. I desperately hunted for a camera to capture the truth, but found none. 

 After two hours of torture, the gang decided it was enough and let the boy (still naked) go home. It?s ironic that the men who acted as judge and jury cannot produce clear moral certificates themselves. Their hobbies include consuming alcohol every evening and thrashing their wives and children when they are intoxicated. 

 Whether they were successful in making the child repent or provoked him to indulge in bigger crimes only time will tell.

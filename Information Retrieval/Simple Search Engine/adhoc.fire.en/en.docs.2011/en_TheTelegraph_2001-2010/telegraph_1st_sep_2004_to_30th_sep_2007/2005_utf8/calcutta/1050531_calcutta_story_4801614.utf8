The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Go-green plans at grassroots

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Environment will not remain the sole concern of the Centre or the state government. Urban local bodies, too, will be drafted in to fight pollution.

 Forty civic bodies in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area ? excluding the Calcutta Municipal Corporation ? will soon have to prepare environment action plans, detailing what needs to be done in the next five years in their respective areas to preserve the environment.

 The project ? Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor, funded by the British government?s Department for International Development ? covers the municipal corporations of Howrah and Chandernagore. 

 The municipalities within its purview include Bally, Bidhannagar, Barasat, Barrackpore, Budge Budge, Dum Dum, New Barrackpore, North Barrackpore, South Dum Dum and North Dum Dum.

 To execute the action plans, the civic bodies will be assisted by a professional consultant and the state pollution control board.

 ?The urban local bodies have been asked to prepare the five-year plans, which will be integrated into the overall development plan,? said a senior official overseeing the project. 

 ?The idea is to take the planning for environment preservation to the grassroots and to make civic bodies accountable for any lapse in this regard. We want the local authorities to come up with a plan on fighting pollution,? he added.

 Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary of the state pollution control board, said: ?We have started discussing the matter. A number of details are yet to be sorted out.? 

 The action plans will deal with air, water and noise pollution, as well as land use. The consulting agency will conduct a study on various aspects of the environment and submit a report, based on which the municipalities will prepare their action plans.

 ?The planning must not be Utopian. It has to take into account the availability of resources and also make a realistic assessment of raising additional resources,? the official pointed out.

 The Rs 700-crore Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor project, spanning over eight years, covers slum infrastructure development, water supply, sanitation and drainage, and solid waste management. 

 It also focuses on filling up gaps in the overall network of basic water supply and sanitation.

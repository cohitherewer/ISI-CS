 All the street?s a stage for them

 Veterans meet child actors on a common public platform to protest social ills and make a difference, says Sebanti Sarkar

 What makes a street play so engrossing? What pulls people to the roadside in large numbers? Why do actors continue to stage plays of protest in public places despite attacks on their lives? The answers blew in the December wind, in street corners and on open grounds. If Nandan witnessed fiery presentations hosted by Panchali, Swabhumi saw a burst of young talent with Bol Jamoore, the street theatre festival organised by CRY. 

 The play: Naya Theatre?s Ponga Pandit at Nandan. Directed by Habib Tanvir, the play is a farce aimed at the caste system and superstitions. Uses minimal props and costumes.

 The purpose: ?Plays written for the street should have the ability to catch the eye and ear instantly. Dialogue delivery and body movement also vary. The scripts focus on something of immediate and general concern. Here, one can leave nothing unsaid. Answers must be given at the end. Street theatre can accommodate large audiences,? says Tanvir.

 The play: Rangkarmee?s Maiyat at Nandan. Director Usha Ganguly uses props, costumes and music.

 The purpose: ?Street theatre has a different power. It makes for direct interaction with the crowd, which comes up to us with questions. There are many groups working in Chennai, Kerala, Delhi, Patna and Imphal. Scarcity of funds and auditoriums may have given a fresh impetus to this kind of play. Street theatre is more challenging as we are at an arm?s length from the audience,? says Ganguly.

 The play: Jana Natya Manch?s Akhri Julus (on the rights of a worker) and Yeh Bhi Himsa Hai (on abuse of women) at Nandan. Director Mala Hashmi uses uniform costumes.

 The purpose: ?No, (husband) Safdar?s murder does not make me feel intimidated working on the streets of Delhi. With the kind of theatre we do we must expect threats. We do around 200 shows a year across the country. The acting style is the same as proscenium but we cut down on props and costumes. Our plays grow out of discussions or are adapted from existing texts. They can be played both on stage and street. At the end of each show, we place a gamchha before the viewers for donations which keep us going,? says Hashmi.

 The play: Pathasena?s Raktakarabi at Nandan. The Tagore play adapted by Badal Sircar for outdoor staging uses basic lights, minimal costumes and symbolic props.

 The purpose: ?We are accessible to everyone... We ensure that our plays can all be packed into a suitcase,? says troupe member Dipankar Banerjee.

 The plays: Presentations on child rights, illiteracy and sexual abuse, staged by students of Mahadevi Birla, Presidency College, Lady Brabourne, Loreto College, Calcutta Law College, Bhawanipur Education Society and NGOs Margam, Udbhash, Jabala, Diksha and Nabadisha.

 The purpose: The Bol Jamoore Street Theatre Festival, launched in Mumbai by CRY in 1996 to raise social awareness, travelled to Swabhumi this year. If Mahadevi Birla and Loreto College touched upon gender discrimination and child abuse, Lady Brabourne presented the vicious cycle of poverty and human rights violation. Presidency dedicated its play to the victims of the Delhi bomb blasts and Kashmir earthquake, while Bhawanipur Education Society protested rape, child abuse and trafficking. But the showstealers were the young actors from NGOs. If Margam focussed on a child?s right to survival, Diksha dwelt on child labour and exploitation. ?We don?t need scripts because we just have to recreate the agonies we have experienced ourselves,? sums up a child actor.

 The Centre for Archaeological Studies and Training, Eastern India, which marks each anniversary with a national seminar on archaeology, has selected ?History of Archaeology in India? as the theme for its 10th anniversary. 

 Between November 6 and 8, reputed and upcoming scholars from various universities and organisations in India and abroad will present papers at the centre?s auditorium at 4, Camac Street. 

 The aim, according to secretary Gautam Sengupta, who has headed the centre over the past 10 years, is not to focus on a narrative account of the Indian archaeological history, but to situate archaeology within the broad intellectual and social framework of 19th and 20th century India.

 At the inaugural seminar on Saturday, M.C. Joshi, former director-general of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), delved into the achievements of his predecessors, starting from post-Independence years. Beyond the names and landmarks, his speech gave a glimpse of a nation slowly realising its responsibilities and equipping itself to meet new challenges. 

 From the time when no specific qualifications were needed to become an archaeologist and the water dripping from Taj Mahal?s dome was left unchecked as it was supposed to be Mumtaz Mahal?s tears, we certainly seem to have come a long way.

 But we are still lagging and there are many other areas that remain totally unexplored, said K. Paddayya, director, Deccan College, Pune. There is, for instance, very little research done on the history of archaeological study in ancient India. Is there no evidence even in vernacular literature to suggest that the study of antiquarian science existed in pre-colonial times? Paddayya also called for a study of the contributions of the princely states like Mysore, which had their own recording systems.

 His main thrust was on the lack of public involvement in archaeological research. Taking the public into confidence was important.

 ?Even the illiterate in India are eager to know if they are told that they live beside a site thousands of years old. They can handle it easily because they are brought up on myths that transcend several yugas. Knowing about the heritage makes them feel enlightened and proud. The objects also earn their concern. I have known situations when funds for protecting sites and finds were not forthcoming from the government, but common farmers and panchayat elders made personal donations to buy showcases and storage facilities. So, like the environment movement, which has succeeded through growing public awareness, we must have an archaeological movement,? said Paddayya. 

 Jadavpur University vice-chancellor A.N. Basu also called for more open dialogue, a multidisciplinary approach and the spread of archaeological education among school children. 

 K.K. Chakravarty, secretary, government of India, lauded the centre?s achievements and said that the eastern region has stopped ?lagging behind? in archaeological research. 

 Sengupta, however, expressed his dissatisfaction with the current situation. ?Unless institutional archaeology (as supported by the government) develops a sense of direction and converges with academic archaeology, there is no hope,? he said.

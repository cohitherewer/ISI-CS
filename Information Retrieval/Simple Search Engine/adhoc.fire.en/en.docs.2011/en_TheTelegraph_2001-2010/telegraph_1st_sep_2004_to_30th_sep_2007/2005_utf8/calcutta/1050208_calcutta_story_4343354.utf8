It was the first step, but a confident and enjoyable one. The First Annual Bengal Club Quiz, presented in association with The Telegraph, saw veteran quizzers off all ages battle it out with a clap and a cheer from eminent Calcuttans in the crowd.

 Around 32 two-member teams registered for the quiz, held on the club premises on Saturday evening and hosted by Siddharth Basu. Six emerged from the prelims to take their place under the spotlight on stage. The mood of the competition was set from the very beginning, when three teams had to break a deadlock for the sixth spot.

 After a welcome address from club president S. B. Ganguly, the battle began in earnest.

 The names of the teams were as colourful as their members. Jeet and Malavika formed Gameplan, Jayshree and Soumyadip curiously called themselves Octet, Suvam and Sudip chose Southern Districts, Avishek and Anil?s was Call Me A Cab (!), Shishir and Vikash were the Irregulars, while Souvik and Phillip stuck to Dalhousie Institute.

 Those in the audience included Russi Mody, Chuni Goswami, Saugata Roy and more, who were kept busy by the on-stage action and in vying for the numerous audience prizes. The teams went neck-and-neck in the initial rounds with Octet managing a slim lead.

 A sample of the questions on offer: Pepsi recently sued the makers of the movie Dil Mange More for copyright infringement. Which pop band did Mattel sue in 1997? Aqua.

 And: what is the official designation of the McDonald?s clown? Chief happiness officer.

 And another: who directed the famous eclipse television commercial featuring Aishwarya Rai? Tarsem Singh.

 The ones that got the teams stumped were lapped up by the audience. Prizes included chocolates, gift vouchers and more. A touch of Tollywood was lent to the occasion with actors Arindam Sil and June asking some of the audience questions.

 The fortunes of the teams swung with each round, be it innovative ones like selecting six right answers from a set of nine, or more straightforward ones like rapid-fire rounds.

 The final round was the decider that saw Call Me A Cab (115 points) sail past Octet (95 points), with Dalhousie Institute emerging third with 80 points.

 Anil Kumar and Avishek Pal, the winners ? both students of IIM Calcutta ? were elated, to say the least, winning 21-inch television sets. Others got DVD players and gift hampers.

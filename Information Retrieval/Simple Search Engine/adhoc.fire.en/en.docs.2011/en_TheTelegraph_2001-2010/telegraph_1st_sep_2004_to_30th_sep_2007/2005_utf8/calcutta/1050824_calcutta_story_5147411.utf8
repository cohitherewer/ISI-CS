Frozen cocktails are cool concoctions that are easy 

to whip up, convenient and refreshing. These require little more than a blender, 

ice, juice, liquor and liqueur. 

The recipes often specify an amount of ice, but you 

can add as much or as little ice as you need to achieve the desired consistency. 

These are often served in Parfait glasses, but any tall drink glass like Collins 

or Highball will do.

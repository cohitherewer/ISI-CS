 In several towns of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, artisans are using eco-friendly material to decorate the clay idols of gods and goddesses. When immersed, these do not pollute the waterbodies. In Calcutta, more than 2,500 Durga idols are immersed every year in the Hooghly. The chemical-based colours used on the idols and the non-bio-degradable decorative items play havoc with the riverine ecosystem. It is high time that the artisans in our state also adopt eco-friendly materials for the idols. Otherwise, a day will come when in order to save the river we might have to do away with the annual festival altogether.

 The footbridge over Kestopur canal, connecting the Lake Town crossing with Salt Lake, is very narrow. It is difficult for three people to move side by side comfortably on the bridge. Despite its strategic importance , the administration has never bothered to construct a concrete or iron-frame footbridge on the spot.

 In the past, the College Street Coffee House was the favourite haunt of the city?s intelligentsia. Gradually it started losing its charm. Now, it has become a meeting place for ruffians. They talk very loudly, pass comments at other visitors and vitiate the environment of the place. The authorities should ensure that such disturbing elements are not allowed to enter the Coffee House and create a nuisance.

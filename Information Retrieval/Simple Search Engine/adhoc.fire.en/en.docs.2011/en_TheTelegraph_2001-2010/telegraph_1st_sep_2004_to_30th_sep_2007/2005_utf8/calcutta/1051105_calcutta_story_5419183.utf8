 Shiva has 108 names, according to the texts. But the 52 judges and 12,000 lawyers of Calcutta High Court and the city civil court, most of whom are believers, have given him another ? Sri Sri Baba Highcourteswar Nath Mahadev.

 Those who practice here regularly pay homage and pronami to a small temple of Highcourteswar adjacent to the city civil court on Kiran Shankar Roy Road.

 The pronami is used to maintain the temple, said its priest Balaram Panda, who took charge about 50 years ago. He is over 80 now and is a direct disciple of Jagadish Chandra Giri, a sadhu from Orissa, who established the temple and lived to be 110. ?Lawyers are generally believers. On the days of major hearings, many of them fast in the morning and offer puja and pronami at the temple before entering their courts,? said Uttam Majumdar, former secretary of the Calcutta Bar Association.

 Panda said it all began about 100 years ago, when Giri found a Shivalinga under a tree in front of the high court and set it up on the pavement beside the city civil court. Later in 1956, a temple was built around the Shivalinga.

 ?When my guru found the Shivalinga and set it up on Kiran Shankar Roy Road, there was a passage adjacent to it that led to the high court,? added Panda.

 The five-ft-high white temple became popular among the judges, lawyers and litigants, being adjacent to high court. 

 On a black stone beside the entrance of the temple are engraved the words: Sri Sri Baba Highcourteswar Mahadev.

 Ever since its establishment, judges, lawyers and litigants have offered prayers at the temple before entering and leaving court. Leading lawyer and executive chairman of Legal Aid Services, West Bengal, Gitanath Ganguli, gives subscription to the temple during Shivratri. 

 ?Yes I do that. I have never offered pronami myself. But I know many lawyers and judges who do that,? he said.

 The daily collections are about Rs 500. During Shivratri, around Rs 50,000 is collected.

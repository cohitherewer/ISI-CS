 What?s a night out without the right tunes to keep the tempo and the temperature up? Whether it?s a disco, pub or private party, music is what makes the mood magical. 

 Here is looking at five DJs from The Park who have made quite an impression on the city party circuit, each specialising in a different genre. Goodlife takes a look at the sultans of spin...

DJ Vishal

 Name: Vishal Sinha

 Age: 23

 Profile: Fashion TV gig at The Oberoi Grand (2003), Tito?s, Goa (2002), Winning Streak (2002-2004), Tantra (from 2004)

 Music genre: Commercial, specialising in electronica. I don?t believe in any particular genre of music, as I believe that music should do what it?s meant to do ? bring people out of their shell, be it on the dance floor, or while lounging

 Audience: I play for the masses. My preferred crowd is one with an open mind about all kinds of music

Playing in Calcutta means: Calcutta has a lot 

of exposure and, contradictory to popular opinion, there is a great partying crowd 

here. You can do your own thing, and the crowd generally picks up on new tracks 

and beats pretty fast

DJ Oblix

 Name: Sushant Sethi

 Age: 22 

 Profile: Started his career with Tantra in 2003 and has played in numerous clubs and private parties since

 Music genre: Commercial, dance music

 Audience: The Gen-X yuppie crowd? ?and the more girls the better!? He loves to see people hitting the floor, as lounging around is not really his style

 Playing in Calcutta means: I belong to the city, and I relate to the people, who in turn relate to my music! And of course the prettiest girls in India (thankfully) stay here!

DJ Sammy

 Name: Samuel Biswas

 Age: 25 

 Profile: Tantra and club nights mainly at CC amp;FC and Tollygunge Club

 Music genre: Hip hop, R amp;B, gangster rap, retro, as well as Bollywood remixes

 Audience: No preference. I love music? I just like to play to packed houses. I love a large dance floor as then I can really see the fruits of my work!

 Playing in Calcutta means: I know the crowds so well, and they relate brilliantly to my music. International sounds are fast creating a monopoly in the Calcutta market, just as Indian beats are taking over the international market. India is a great place to be a DJ now and I?m loving every second of it!

DJ Sanjay

 Name: Sanjay Dutta 

 Age: 35 

 Profile: With a career that started at Someplace Else, he?s been on a never-ending roll since. Bangkok ? Narcissus, Hom Trance club, Lucille. Mumbai ? Vie, Rock Bottom, Circus Circus. Delhi ? Someplace Else, Lizard Lounge, Mojo. Bangalore ? I-Bar, Zero G, The Club. Chennai ? Pasha, Sparks. Pune ? 10 Downing Street, Ivo?s. Hyderabad ? Touch, 10 Downing Street, Durgam Cherevu

 Music genre: All genres of house ? techno, progressive and tribal house. Euro trance is another hot favourite

 Audience: I just require an open-minded audience that is open to alternative sounds

 Playing in Calcutta means: I?ve played in all the best clubs in India, but it?s always like coming back home here

DJ Austin

 Name: Austin Smith

 Age: 45

 Profile: He started his career at Someplace Else in Calcutta in 1994. At the time ?the city was one of the most happening places in the world?.

 Music genre: He?s one of the few DJs around who can play any genre of music, be it 60s classics, Hindi, hip hop and even the odd touch of Bangla! ?It all depends on the crowd and what they want.?

 Audience: Any audience. ?As long as they make a big noise on the floor!?

 Playing in Calcutta means: Like playing at home. I love Calcutta and it?ll always be the most comfortable place in the world for me. Even though my career has taken me to various places, I still maintain that Calcuttans rock the most!

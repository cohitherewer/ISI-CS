The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The coy mistress

 Reminiscent of the satirical comedies of Ben Jonson, Mrs. Soriano is a burlesque on romance and true love. The Bengali adaptation of Eduardo de Filippos Filumena Marturano, it clearly exposes male hypocrisy in matters of love and marriage, at the same time making a wry comment on a society that leaves women with little means to lead their lives independently and with dignity. Through the medium of humour and laughter, the play unfolds the story of Filumena, mistress and housekeeper of the wealthy Domenico Soriano. Having served him loyally for 25 years, she feels shocked and betrayed when she learns that Soriano intends to marry a young, attractive and socially acceptable girl. Filumena tricks him into marrying her by pretending that she is dying. Soon after the ceremony is over, startling revelations, one after another, leave both Mr. and Mrs. Soriano totally dumbfounded. Despite the play?s obvious ironies, the spirit of humanity and moral optimism shines through it, ultimately glorifying a life in which love prevails. Acting, direction and music: Dolly Basu.

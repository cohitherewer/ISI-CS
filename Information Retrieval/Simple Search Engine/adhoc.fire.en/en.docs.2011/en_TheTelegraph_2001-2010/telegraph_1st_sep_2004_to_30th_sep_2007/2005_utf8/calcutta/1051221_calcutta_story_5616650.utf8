 Camp hope for polio stricken

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Priyanka Bhattacharya, a final-year BA student, is afflicted with polio. She had to change her college from Jogmaya Devi to Netaji Nagar. ?I found it impossible to climb the stairs of Jogmaya Devi College,? she says. 

 Dolly Baidya, a Class XII student of Hooghly Girls? High School and another polio patient, might have to give her Higher Secondary examinations a miss next year and visit south India for surgery.

 A corrective surgery camp promises to make the lives of Priyanka, Dolly and thousands of others like them a little easier.

 It has been organised by Lions Club of Calcutta North and Lions Club of Calcutta Greater, in association with Sri Balaji Institute of Surgery, Research and Rehabilitation for Disabled, Tirupati.The venue of the camp, which started last week, is Lions Orthopaedics Hospital and Research Centre at Regent Park. It will be on till Thursday. 

 The camp has been organised every year since 1994. This year, the organisers are targeting 300 surgeries.

 ?We are also planning to refer more than 400 patients to Tirupati for critical operations,? said Subhas Murarka, chairman, publicity committee of the camp. 

 The club members are raising awareness about the camp by distributing pamphlets, putting up banners and through ads on cable channels. ?Increasing the awareness level is the best way to fight polio, and that?s what we are trying to do,? added Murarka.

 The camp is meant for those over 10 and have missed their polio vaccine doses. ?A number of patients have undergone two or more surgeries at the camp. They have come back for annual check-up,? Murarka stated.

 The surgeries are being performed by doctors from both Tirupati and the city, under the supervision of D. Jagadesh of Sri Balaji institute.

 ?Initially, the patients were only from the state. Now, we have a good number of them from Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa,? said Subir Sen, president, Lions Club of Calcutta North.

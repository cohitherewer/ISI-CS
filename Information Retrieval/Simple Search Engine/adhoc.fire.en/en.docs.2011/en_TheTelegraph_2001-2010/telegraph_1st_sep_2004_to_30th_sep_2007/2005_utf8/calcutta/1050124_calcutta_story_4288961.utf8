The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Counters few for tax-payer count

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to cater to the ?rush? of those who wish to avail of the waiver-of-interest scheme, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Gariahat office is neglecting house-owners eager to pay their current and arrear property taxes.

 On any working day, just two counters struggle to serve more than a thousand tax-payers at this office. 

 Office-goers and businessmen find it very difficult to queue up behind 50 to 60 people for over two hours to pay their dues. 

 ?It is my second attempt today,? said Kamalika Roy, of Ballygunge Place, standing at the tail-end of a 105-head-long queue at noon on Saturday. 

 ?The counter will close at 1 pm and I think will have to come back some other day,? she rued.

 ?It is better to be a defaulter because both the state government and the civic authorities are more obliging to the defaulters through the waiver-of-interest scheme,? an elderly Satyendranath Banerjee of the Lake Market area said. 

 In order to avoid the long queues, representatives from big commercial houses or those of infirm health inevitably crowd near the third-floor office of Soumen Maulik, the assessor and collector, hoping to convince him to take their dues right away. ?I have requested municipal commissioner Debashis Som to open more counters,? said Maulik.

 Deputy municipal commissioner (revenue) Nandan Roy, however, is not ready to accept that there is a shortage of counters at the CMC?s Gariahat office. 

 Instead, he says, two counters have been added to the six existing collection windows.

 Admitting that two counters have been kept closed on the second floor, treasurer of the Gariahat office Biplab Roy said: ?We are trying to open them as soon as possible.? He pointed out that of the total eight counters, six are functional. 

 Two have been engaged to manage the rush of the waiver-of-interest scheme. ?After the term of the scheme expires, we will be able to open two more counters for the tax-payers,? treasurer Roy added.

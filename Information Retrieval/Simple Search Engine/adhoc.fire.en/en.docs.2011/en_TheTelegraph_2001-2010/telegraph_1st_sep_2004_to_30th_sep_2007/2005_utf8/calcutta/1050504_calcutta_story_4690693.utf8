 A blaze broke out at the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) office early on Tuesday and destroyed, among other things, a large number of labour documents, some as old as 125 years.

 The office is on the third floor of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry building (a heritage structure), at 6, Netaji Subhas Road. 

 A sweeper who came to open the office around 7.30 am found the industrial relations and labour department on fire.

 ?On Monday, we had left around 6.45 pm. I returned at 7.45 am on Tuesday and saw flames leaping out of the windows overlooking Rana Pratap Sarani. I tried to run upstairs, but couldn?t go beyond the second floor because of the heat and smoke,? said Bipin Kumar Rao, an IJMA employee.

 Rao and others immediately alerted the fire brigade. Six tenders from the Nimtala, CR Avenue and Lalbazar stations rushed to the spot. 

 Around 50 fire-fighters struggled for two hours and brought the blaze under control around 10.15 am.

 ?Fortunately, the fire did not spread to the adjoining rooms or buildings,? said a fire brigade officer.

 ?There were five cooking-gas cylinders in the kitchen of an eatery on the same floor. The kitchen is barely 20 metres from the room that caught fire and shares a corridor with it,? said IJMA accountant Pradip Kumar Mookerjee.

 Around 1,935 sq ft on the east wing of the IJMA office, spread across 4,792 sq ft, have been gutted. A number of ceiling fans have melted and the thick iron beams in the ceiling have cracked. Wooden cupboards containing labour documents of the past 125 years were reduced to ashes.

 ?The extent of damage is yet to be assessed, but the destruction of the documents is a severe loss for us,? said administrative officer Dipak Kumar Banerjee.

 Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said after inspecting the building that the forensic department would conduct a probe to ascertain the cause of the fire. ?This is a major blaze. The chief minister will have to be informed about it,? he added.

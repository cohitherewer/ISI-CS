 Ei Gopal, chinta chhar. 

 Ei ne, biri kha. (Hey Gopal, stop worrying. Come, here?s 

 a fag)?. The men sit in a semi-circle outside the labour 

 room. A wail is heard and one of them beats an aluminium 

 plate in celebration. The door opens and the midwife says 

 drily: ?Meye.?

 What happens next is an encounter with rural India of the future that plunges in bestiality when it runs out of women. When it spies one, she is married off to all five brothers in a family, with even the father-in-law claiming conjugal rights.

 Calcutta had a glimpse of Matrubhoomi: A nation without women at 89 Cinemas on Friday. It is due for release in the first week of July. The cast and crew were in town to seek support against female infanticide that is wiping women off villages in northern India?

 All for a cause

 ?I came all the way from Mumbai just to introduce the film because it means so much to me. This film is very disturbing. When I saw it, I could not get myself up for a long time. Being a cosmopolitan girl, I was hit hard by such a brutal face of rural India,? said Sushmita Sen. 

 ?It is not a fictional film, it is futuristic. We say how women are going to the space and becoming Prime Ministers. Yet here we kill baby girls. Trafficking is happening even in Bengal and Bangladesh because girls are less in number. You can?t have Adam without Eve. Ami khushi je ami ei cinema take amar bari antey perechhi. Kalki is just as much a victim of suppression as my character Basanti in the film Chingari. I feel blessed to be part of this film fraternity that could make such an incredibly brave film. I will put Manish under lock and key until we do a film together.?

 Director?s cut

 ?When we were auditioning, Pankaj introduced me to Tulip (Joshi). I had absolutely no idea what she had done. People come for auditions with a fa?ade ? a face all made-up, speaking a strange English? Tulip came as her natural self. I knew she would fit the bill as Kalki. The film ends with a question ? when a girl child is born to her, will society accept it and redeem itself or would it repeat the same mistake it makes in the beginning of the film?? said director Manish Jha.

 The main man

 ?When they showed me the script, I thought this is too far-fetched. But they told me about the villages in India which had no women. Then there are these rape cases in the newspapers ? of three-year to 80-year-olds. We are not talking of equality in the film. Let us first learn to accept a female child,? said Sushant Singh, who plays the youngest brother Suraj, the only man who shows some respect to Kalki.

 Market mechanics

 ?The film has no graphic violence against women, no nudity. We decided that the men in the audience should not lust for Kalki yet every woman should feel abused,? said producer Pankaj Kharbanda. 

 ?When Shabana (Azmi) saw it, she said, ?Take whatever cuts the censors give, but just get the film released?. Some people asked why we didn?t make it softer. But killing a child is barbaric. We wanted to hit at the solar plexus. In Paris, the film ran for eight weeks. The Europe edition of Time Magazine placed it in the Top 10 list,? he added.

 Reaching out

 ?We have dubbed the film in five languages from Hindi ? Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Bhojpuri and Gujarati ? so that it reaches the grassroots. We will propose tax exemption to the government so that ticket prices stay low. We do not have the infrastructure to hold free shows in rural India. But the government can order any number of prints and show it,? said Boney Kapoor, who presents the film along with wife Sridevi.

 ?There is a problem in Bengal over the release of the Bengali version. We will take up the issue. We have not made the film to make money out of it. The profit from exhibiting the Bengali Matrubhoomi will go to some NGO dealing with women?s problems.?

 Bengal block

 ?The dubbed Bengali version cannot 

 release here till we give a go-ahead. This is to protect 

 the local industry. We allow inter-dubbing only between 

 the eastern Indian languages. Otherwise every film has to 

 use double shots for the Bengali version,? said Arijit Dutta 

 of Eastern India Motion Picture Association.

 After playing second, or third, 

 fiddle in Dil Maange More, Tulip Joshi is back with 

 a more meaningful film, Matrubhoomi. I took 

 the experience of shooting as a 9-to-5 job. If I took it 

 personally, I would have gone mad, says Tulip, who 

 shot to fame as the eye candy in Yash Raj Films Mere 

 Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, from Mumbai. In this film, she plays 

 Kalki, the last surviving woman.

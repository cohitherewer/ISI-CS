 Ethnic extravaganza

 The Indian lehnga gets a western twist at Vanya, a designer studio on Lower Rawdon Street. Its latest collection titled Skirt-Lehnga 2005 is designed to give the wearer a semi-formal look. Patchwork combined with intricate embroidery lends an ethnic edge to the ensembles.

 Fabrics like cotton, silk, printed khadi, brocade and multi-coloured tissue have been used to create the feeling of luxury and flow. Hand-embroidery techniques like resham, aari and zardosi give the western silhouettes a traditional look, while semi-precious stones and metal coins add the opulent feel.

 Embroidery on crepe with a contrast knife-and-box-pleat border, polka dots, geometric prints, diagonal multi-coloured patches and tassels with zari add an almost-African touch to the pieces. 

 This collection draws on a variety of Indian and western cuts, colours and looks. Its targeted at the young and the bold, says designer Vandana Jain. A variety of tops with necklines like scallops, squares and low-cuts and sleeves with intricate cut-work throw up stylish matches for the skirts. 

 Prices start at Rs 1,500. 

 Garment gala

 With the festive season knocking on the door, its time to give your ethnic wardrobe a boost. And while youre out looking for traditional garments, an exhibition-cum-sale at Genesis Art Gallery on August 5 and 6 promises to be a good hunting ground.

 Specialising in hand-painted saris, shawls, dupattas and unstitched dress materials, Delhi-based designer Kiran Singh has been organising annual exhibitions in Calcutta for the last few years. Retailing under her label Buglis Creations, the designer has already hosted 91 exhibitions of her creations all over India and Dubai in the last 13 years.

 The collection to be displayed over the next two days includes her trademark hand-painted saris, dress materials, dupattas, shawls and stoles enhanced with sequins, beads and discharge printing. Mainly floral motifs adorn the cottons, crepes, georgettes and chiffons in colours both bright and pastel. 

 The exhibition at the gallery in Gitanjali Apartments at 8B, Middleton Street will be open from 10.30 am.

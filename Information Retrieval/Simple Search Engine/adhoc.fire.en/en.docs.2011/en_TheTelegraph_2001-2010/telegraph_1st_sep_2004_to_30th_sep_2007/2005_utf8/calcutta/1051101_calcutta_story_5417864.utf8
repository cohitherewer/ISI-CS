 If the detective department sleuths are to be believed, Khurshida Begum, Mariyamma and several others ? all neatly dressed and armed with knives ? are out on the prowl. And during Diwali and Dhanteras, they could be lurking in the crowd, waiting to lift your gold necklace or even the new jewellery you have just bought for the festival of lights. 

 According to officers of the detective department?s watch section, some are regular faces. But the officers admit that the threat lies with a few newcomers, who are young but have learnt the ropes of the trade fast. 

 ?The younger lot is very smart, dressed for the occasion. Out in the crowd or even at the counters of shops or shopping malls, you won?t be able to make them out. Apart from carrying themselves very smartly, they work at lightning speed and lift valuables with catching victims unaware,? says an officer of the detective department.

 Police came to know about the latest entrants in the trade following the recent arrests of two lifters in the city. Shefali Mondal, alias Buri, and Mantu Mullick, alias Shukuli, were arrested a few days ago in the Gariahat market by the officers of the watch section. 

 The two seasoned lifters, from Kudghat and Santoshpur, have told police during interrogation about the entrants, who have sent the cops into a tizzy on Dhanteras-eve but whom the department has not been able to identify.

 While the young ones are flashy, the seniors go about their work in a somewhat different manner.

 Insiders claim that most of them target handbags, which they slit through in a way that the victims wake up to the theft only after returning home. 

 Police point to Mariyamma, a 39-year-old Malayalee woman from Titagarh, on the northern fringes of the city, to prove the point. Held on several occasions, the woman managed to be out on bail, only to return to the trade every time. 

 ?Forget about the old and new faces. We would like to call upon all planning to go out for post-Dhanteras and Diwali shopping to be extra alert. In the frenzy of shopping items, people tend to be inattentive about their bags and do not bother much about the surroundings. Our advice to shoppers and revellers is that always be cautious about your belongings,? says Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 It is in keeping with this that cops this year have thrown a special security cover across certain parts of the city, where the Dhanteras crowd is expected to throng. Apart from the usual hangouts on Camac Street, Shakespeare Sarani or in the Bhowanipore and Gariahat areas, police have stepped up deployment in Posta, Burrabazar and Bowbazar.

 ?Since most traders turn up in these areas in the central business district, we have heightened security there,? the detective chief adds.

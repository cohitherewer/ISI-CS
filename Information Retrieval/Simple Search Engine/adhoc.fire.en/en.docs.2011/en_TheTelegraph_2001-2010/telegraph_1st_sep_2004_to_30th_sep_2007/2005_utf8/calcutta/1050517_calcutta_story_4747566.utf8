 Classmate wins court sop

 - 14-day notice ordered before arrest of girl in murder case

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Monday directed the police to serve a 14-day notice before arresting electronics engineer Antara Chakraborty for her alleged involvement in the murder of Bikram Behera, a former classmate.

 A division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A. Talukdar, passed the order while disposing of an anticipatory bail plea by Chakraborty. 

 A sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Midnapore had issued a warrant of arrest against the Regent Park resident. She moved an anticipatory bail petition before the sessions judge of East Midnapore, but her plea was refused.

 Twenty-two-year-old Chakraborty completed her electronics and telecommunications engineering course from Bhadrak Institute of Engineering and Technology, in Orissa, last year. After completing other professional courses, she landed a job with a software firm, and is set to join in August.

 Police recovered the body of Behera from a railway track in Kharagpur in July 2004. On the basis of a complaint by Behera?s mother with Bhadrak thana, police registered a case against Chakraborty. Behera?s mother complained that some of his classmates had conspired and killed her son. 

 ?During her study at Bhadrak Institute, one of her classmates, Bikram Behera, used to tease her. He had even proposed marriage to her. He also said he could not imagine living without her,? Joymalya Bagchi, counsel for Chakraborty, told the court. 

 He added that his client had no affection for ?that ill-tempered and foul-mouthed man and she refused to accept Bikram?s proposal?.

 Bagchi informed the court that on July 3 last year, when Chakraborty was returning to Calcutta on the Dhauli Express, Bikram had boarded the same train, following her. He repeatedly asked Chakraborty to accept his proposal. ?My client last saw him on the train at Kharagpur station.?

 Bagchi told the court that a few months ago, police asked Chakraborty to come to Kharagpur. ?It was my client who identified Bikram?s decomposed body,? Bagchi said. ?She has an excellent career ahead. Her future will be at stake if the police are allowed to arrest her.?

 Appearing for the state, additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said the investigating officer of the case did not find it necessary to interrogate Chakraborty.

 After hearing both sides, the court ordered the police to serve a notice before arresting Chakraborty, so that she had the opportunity to move another anticipatory bail plea before the court.

 School agog over fee hike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sudden and preposterous hike in monthly tuition fees and alleged deficiencies of the management triggered an agitation on Sunday by guardians of students of an English-medium school in Howrah?s Belur. 

 A few weeks ago, the authorities of Sunrise (Eng. Med.) School, at 9, Tara Chand Ganguly Street, in Belur, had announced an increase in fees. 

 On March 5, R. Prasad, secretary of the school, announced the new fees for students of all classes from Lower Nursery up to Class XII. 

 The hike ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 1,870. The new fees for Lower Nursery II jumped from Rs 700 to Rs 1,200, whereas in the case of Class XI science (computer), the fees climbed from Rs 1,180 to Rs 3,050. 

 ?Last Monday, we contacted the school authorities. The management had assured us then that it will hold talks with us. The authorities fixed today as the date for discussions. But yesterday, they told us through our children that there will be no talks,? said Ramen Roy, an agitating guardian.

 More than 500 guardians congregated at the main entrance of the school during the day and staged an agitation. 

 A huge police force set up pickets both inside and outside the school. ?More than 50 policemen were pressed into action. Personnel of the reserve force from Shibpur police lines, too, were sent,? said a district police officer.

 Tension prevailed in the school, with the main entrance swarming with agitated guardians and a large number of policemen. Reserved armed police from Shibpur police lines guarded the entrance, armed with automatic weapons and teargas. 

 ?At one point, the guardians tried to break the gate. But we quickly brought the situation under control,? said police.

 After the failure of talks with a forum of parents on Sunday, the school authorities decided to hold talks with guardians on March 22. 

 Guardians agreed to it, but requested the management not to declare results before the discussion.

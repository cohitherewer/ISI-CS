 Sagar biche swarg sa sundar apan samajwa/ Pardes mein bhi dekha bhojpuriyan ke raj wa. 

 A Bhojpuri film is, indeed, ruling the theatres in Bihar and spreading wings in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Flush with the success, producer Udit Narayan is now looking towards Bengal.

 The singer, who has recently picked up a National Award for the Yeh tara woh tara number in Swades, was in Calcutta for the premiere of Kab hoi Gaona Hamar in the city. ?This is my tribute to my native state. My next film will be in Bengali. Everything will be finalised in the next couple of months and work will start next year,? he announced. That would be his ?salute to my sasural?. Wife Deepa is a Darjeeling girl who spent her college life in Jadavpur, studying at City College.

 The Bhojpuri film is Udit Narayan?s first effort as a producer. ?The film was released on Holi and is still running to packed halls. Chhobi onek hit hoye gechhey,? he said. Five prints have been released in Calcutta ? at Liberty, Chetna, Mayur, Kalika and Lakshmi, in Titagarh. Along with Deepa, whose name appears in the credits as producer and story-writer, Udit toured every hall where the film released. 

 ?Gaona refers to the first coming of the bride to the in-laws? house. In this film, the gaona gets delayed as Birju, the hero, falls in the net of frauds and lands in Mauritius, leaving his bride back at her home in Chhapra village.? 

 Kab hoi Gaona Hamar is based on the lives of workers from UP and Bihar who were sent to the island to work in sugarcane factories during British rule. ?When we went to Mauritius for a show a couple of years ago, it seemed like a mini Hindustan, the way all festivals are celebrated there. That inspired me to write the story,? Deepa said. 

 The film, starring top local hero Ravi Kishen and Divya Desai, is the first Bhojpuri film to have been shot abroad. ?The budget was more than Rs 1 crore,? Udit said, while adding mischievously: ?I sing to earn the money; as my wife, she makes films to spend it.? The film will next be released in Mauritius.

 The man, who started life as a folk singer in Radio Nepal, feels he is living a dream in picking up his third National Award. ?My father is a farmer. I do not hide my background. He did not want me to pursue singing as a career. But today, he is proud of me,? he says emotionally.

 Udit Narayan had made it big after 10 years of struggle with the chart-busting teenage romance Qayamat se Qayamat Tak in 1988 and has been on a steady platform ever since. ?But music today is more quantity than quality unlike the earlier decades,? he rues. As for the current crop of singers, ?let them survive in the industry for five-six years. Only then can one pass a comment on how good they are,? says the melody man.

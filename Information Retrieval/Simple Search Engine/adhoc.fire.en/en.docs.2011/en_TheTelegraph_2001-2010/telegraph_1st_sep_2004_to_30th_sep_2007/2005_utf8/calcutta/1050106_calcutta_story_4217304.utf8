 Cops punch holes in safety drill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 One man to count 10,000 exhibits in five galleries twice a day, every day. Impossible as it may sound, that?s the job assigned to a single officer of the Indian Museum every day.

 This fact was brought to light by city police investigating the theft of the fifth century Buddha head from the Archaeology Long gallery on December 29.

 So, the police have raised doubts about the date when the theft is supposed to have taken place. Of late, the Central Bureau of Investigation has taken over the probe.

 Shakti Kali Basu, director of the museum, said: ?There are 35 galleries in the museum. To look after the exhibits, both displayed and non-displayed, we have seven technical assistants.? He, however, reserved comment on whether it was possible for a single person to count so many exhibits twice every day.

 Police interrogated the officer, D. Das, assigned to look after the particular gallery, and four others. ?According to Das? regular job schedule, after coming to work, he has to count all the displayed and non-displayed exhibits of five galleries. And before leaving office, he has to repeat that and mention in the record book that everything is in place,? said a detective. ?So, we find the timing of the theft suspicious.?

 Elaborating on why they smelt a rat, an official said: ?First of all, appointing one person to take stock of 10,000 exhibits twice a day is an absurd idea. If a person spends 10 seconds on a single exhibit, the time he or she will need is 27 hours. But the duty hours are not more than 10 to 12 hours. So, we are doubtful if all the exhibits used to be counted on a regular basis or not.?

 On the first day, when the theft came to light, the museum authorities told the detectives that the object was stolen between 12.30 pm and 1.15 pm. 

 ?The head was last seen at 12.30 pm. But we are not ready to accept that. When the stock-taking system is full of lapses, how can they say the head was not stolen on the previous day or any other day?? asked a senior officer of the detective department. 

 ?The authorities are busy hiding the lacunae in the security system,? he added.

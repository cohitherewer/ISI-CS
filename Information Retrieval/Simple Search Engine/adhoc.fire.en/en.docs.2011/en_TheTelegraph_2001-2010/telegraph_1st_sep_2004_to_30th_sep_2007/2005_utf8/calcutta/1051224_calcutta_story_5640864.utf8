An annual treat

 Natrang stages Ghumayee

 Twenty-two years and a thousand associations, bonds across time and space, and repeated proof of the overwhelming thirst for theatre would summarise Nandikar?s annual theatre festival, on till Sunday at Academy of Fine Arts. For theatre lovers it is a wonderful opportunity to sample the variety of work happening in different parts of India and abroad.

 Take the inaugural item, The Cat?s Journey, presented jointly by Marten Hedman?s Teater, Dockteatern Tittut of Sweden and some actors and musicians of Nandikar. The Cat?s Journey is a very different kind of puppet show based on a popular, century-old tale by Swedish writer/illustrator Ivar Arosenius. Lisa Kjellgreu and co-actor and co-narrator David Meliu have long been members of Dockteatern Tittut, a 28-year-old group committed to doing plays for children. Marten Hedman, also formerly of Tittut, broke away to do plays for children and adults. ?There are hundreds of groups doing different things in Stockholm. Tittut often plays in schools before groups of children who sit at arm?s length and often butt into the performance with questions and suggestions,? said Lisa. 

 Marten too believes in the importance of exposing children to traditional art forms and theatre. ?Children in Sweden hardly get a chance to hear live music, which is why all my plays involve live musicians and traditional instruments,? stressed Marten, now working on a puppet show based on The Ugly Duckling.

 The plays Bapu and Samrat on Day 5, however, deliberately trod a familiar line. Aaj Theatre Co, a 21-year-old group, was performing these two plays outside Delhi for the first time. ?The script and treatment obviously call for a rethink but we intend to continue doing these two plays together because they underline the power of non-violence as a weapon,? said director Bhanu Bharti.

 If Cadaverous by Calcutta group Sanskriti tried with somewhat childish crudity to rip off the social, cultural and political hypocrisies of our times, Ghumayee, a Dogri play by Natrang of Jammu, was a stylishly choreographed presentation. Ghumayee (The Wail) written and directed by Balwant Thakur uses an ancient folk tale to blast social conventions and stress the significance of human relationships, harping on the plight of women in society. Natrang, a pioneering theatre group of the region, has been active for over 22 years, doing powerful, poignant and experimental plays in and out of Jammu.

 This is the group that was assaulted by hoodlums on the way to Nandikar?s festival two years ago but continues to travel undeterred around the country with its repertoire. Natrang, too, has started an annual theatre festival, a tradition of regular Sunday theatre, a children?s wing and given Jammu its second auditorium, the Natrang Studio Theatre.

 ?There are insurgents, violence, earthquakes, restrictions on time, etc, but people do turn up for our shows,? said Neeraj Kant of Natrang.

 Did someone say the stage was dead?

 What began as a small establishment way back in 1945 is now a jewellery house to reckon with. And the journey continues with MP Jewellers launching yet another showroom at 99, Vivekananda Road on Friday. 

 This is the fifth showroom in the city and the sixth in all. Over the years we have branched out to reach closer to our customers, says group chairman Biplabankur Roychowdhury. A showroom at Burdwan will be inaugurated soon.

 To mark the launch of the north Calcutta store, the jewellery house unveiled a special ornament range for the trendy urban woman. The line comprises sleek and sophisticated designs of neckpieces, earrings and wristwear.

 Brand ambassador Nicolette Bird handed over prizes to the winners of a treasure hunt on the occasion. 

 The store houses jewellery in gold, platinum and diamond. Novelties in silver are mostly puja items. Also available are astral gemstones. Prices of the jewellery start at Rs 2,500.

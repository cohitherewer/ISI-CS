The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Most of the autorickshaws in the city do not have proper headlights and a sturdy 

body. Add to that, rash driving. On most routes, these three-wheelers ply till 

late into the evening. With dim or defunct street lights in many areas, drivers 

of other vehicles are often unable to spot the autorickshaw from a distance. The 

authorities concerned should set certain standards for autorickshaw bodies like 

those for private buses. 

 Rimli Datta, 

Salt Lake. 

 I was witness to an accident that took place around 7 am on July 10 at the 

Rawdon Street-Park Street crossing. A young man, probably in his thirties, rammed 

his car into a scooter. Though the driver and another youth seated in the car 

clearly saw that the scooterist had lost consciousness, they sped off. A doctor 

who was passing by made a note of the car?s licence number, shifted the middle-aged 

man to Assembly of God Church hospital and also informed the police. On July 11, 

the victim underwent a major brain surgery in another hospital. He died a day 

later. The men in the killer car are family members of the owner of a sari shop 

on Theatre Road. The tragedy has robbed a woman of her husband and two innocent 

children of their father. Will the conscience of the two men ever let them live 

in peace?

 Many statues of British bureaucrats and governors were dumped in Barrackpore 

by the Left Front government when it came to power. I came upon 12 of the statues 

in a pitiable condition in the governor?s house in Barrackpore?s Lat Bagan area. 

Now, the government is busy wooing British entrepreneurs to invest in the state. 

Wouldn?t it be proper to reinstall the statues in the city, not for their historical 

connection but for their artistic value?

 There is general apathy and ignorance among people when it comes to tending 

to injured stray animals. I availed of People for Animal?s emergency service recently 

when I chanced upon an injured puppy in my locality. The ambulance picked up the 

animal, nursed it back to health and even returned it to the same area as per 

my instructions. I urge Calcuttans to contact such NGOs whenever they find a stray 

animal in need of help. 

 Nasreen Hashim, 

Salt Lake. 

 Many Metro stations do not have escalators at one or more of their entry/exit 

points. Elderly persons find the steep stairs very tiring. Can?t the authorities 

come up with a solution?

Heysham Row.

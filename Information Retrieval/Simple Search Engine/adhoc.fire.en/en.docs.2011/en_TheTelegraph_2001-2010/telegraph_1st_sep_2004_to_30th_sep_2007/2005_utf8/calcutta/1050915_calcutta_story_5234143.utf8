 ?Son-like? Buddha fails to deliver

 - WIDOW WAITS 43 YEARS FOR DUES

 Bela Bhattacharya at home when she was better

 Exactly a year ago, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had handed her a cheque for Rs 110,364 as the salary dues of her dead husband.

 The chief minister had then apologised to Bela Bhattacharya for the delay ? the dues were being paid to her 42 years after her husband was suspended as assistant secretary in the agriculture department. Bhattacharjee had promised to the widow, now in her 80s, that the rest of the dues ? another Rs 4 lakh as gratuity, pension and family pension ? would be paid ?very soon?.

 On Tuesday, a year later, a severely ill Bhattacharya was lying on a bed at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, wondering how soon the ?very soon? would materialise. She has given up all hopes of getting her dues.

 ?I don?t have the strength to pursue the dues any longer. I fail to understand what has gone wrong where. Why is it taking the government so long to pay me what is rightfully mine?? she asked, summoning all the strength her frail frame would allow.

 Husband Amulya Chandra, resident of Uma Kanta Sen Lane, in Paikpara, was suspended in 1962 over a misplaced cheque. A criminal case was filed against him the following year. He retired in 1973, still under suspension. The case was disposed of in 1992 and he was acquitted. 

 But till his death in 1993, he had been receiving only Rs 142 a month as ?provisional pension?. And more than a decade had passed till his widow received the salary dues.

 Last year, officials told Bhattacharya that the personnel department was working on the dues related to her husband?s gratuity, pension and family pension. ?Very soon, you will get your pension,? an official had said.

 Nothing has happened yet. 

 ?According to our calculations, my mother should get at least Rs 4-5 lakh more. However, the total amount has not been revealed to us, and we were told by an official that the calculations are being carried out by the office of the accountant-general (Bengal),? said Bhattacharya?s son, Tarun. 

 ?Had she received the money, we could have arranged for better treatment for her,? he regretted.

 R.N. Das, joint secretary in the state personnel and administrative reforms department, told Metro: ?We had sent two reminders to the accountant-general?s office to speed up work. An update on this has been sent to Bela Bhattacharya. I don?t know about the rest.?

 Bhattacharya had written to the chief minister last year, addressing him ?tumi amar chheler moto (you are like my son)? and requesting him to see to it that her dues were paid. The letter did not go unnoticed at Writers? Buildings and the matter was followed up, resulting in the payment of the salary dues and the promise that the rest would be paid soon.

 But now, the woman ? bleeding constantly for the past few days, writhing in pain, paralysed below the waist and a syringe pierced into her left arm for saline ?does not have the strength to write to the chief minister one more time. 

 ?For years, my husband got only two-thirds of his salary because of the suspension. He would have to tutor children to run the family and get our two daughters married. He lived in great distress till his death. My fate is similar? What kind of a punishment is this?? she asked, tears welling up in the eyes. ?The worst part is that I am still hoping to get the money before I die??

 Daughter Krishna Chakraborty said: ?We fear her days are numbered. Our only regret is that she will die without getting what she had been expecting for the past 42 years. This is the worst kind of injustice.?

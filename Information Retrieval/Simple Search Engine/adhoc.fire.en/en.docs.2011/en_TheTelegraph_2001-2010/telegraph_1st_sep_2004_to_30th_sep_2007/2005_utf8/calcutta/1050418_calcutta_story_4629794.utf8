The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Multistarrer with madness as method

Director Sangeeth Sivan and stars Ishaa Koppikar and 

Tusshar Kapoor were in town as part of the 10-city promotional tour of Kyaa Kool 

Hai Hum. They spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about the naughty comedy and their 

future plans, with Neha Dhupia joining in from Mumbai

 Sangeeth Sivan

SANGEETH SIVAN

I have directed eight Malayalam films, mostly with 

actor Mohanlal in the lead. Kyaa Kool Hai Hum (K2H2) is my fourth 

Hindi film and this is the first time I am doing comedy. Zor addressed 

a social problem, Sandhya was a horror film and Chura Liya Hai Tumne 

a romantic thriller. Sandhya, of course, never released due to a financial 

mess although we believed in the film strongly.

I am the first director outside the Balaji camp to 

direct a film for producer Ektaa Kapoor. I have heard about her overruling directors 

midway into projects and was apprehensive of working with her. So we had an understanding 

right at the outset ? she can be part of all the scripting discussions but once 

the script is locked, I go and shoot the film and come back. 

But then again, not all producers are as creative 

as Ektaa and have such strong convictions about their concepts. It was her idea 

to get a second hero ? before that K2H2 was a single-hero project. And 

good that we did, since Riteysh?s (Deshmukh) character has turned out to be the 

funniest of the lot. 

I felt very insecure in the beginning. In a film like 

this, technique becomes meaningless, the script becomes the king and the stress 

is on timing and language. Also, since I am from the south, I cannot speak fluent 

Hindi. But once the shooting started, the bonding within the team and the chemistry 

amongst the cast set the ball rolling.

Ektaa and I are planning another comedy but nothing?s 

finalised as of now and a lot depends on the fate of K2H2, which releases 

on May 6.

ISHAA KOPPIKAR 

As my director says, I have the most difficult role 

in the film of a tough paan-chewing Maharashtrian cop named Urmila Martodkar. 

I am supposed to monitor the madness of the two main characters played by Tusshar 

and Riteysh. The film?s largely about how I control the two as they go on this 

crazy trip to become rich and famous.

I do not exactly have an item song in the film but 

there is a dance number picturised on me called Chaska. Can?t really call 

it an item track since it adds to the script. It?s not that I don?t like to feature 

in item numbers since I can never forget that it was Khallas and Ishq 

Samundar which made me. Jad ko kaise bhool sakti hoon? After those 

two songs every actress and wannabe actress wanted to do item numbers.

I am the only common element of Company and 

its forthcoming prequel D. Here, I have a full-fledged role of a bar dancer 

in the film and not just a dance number. It feels great because it shows Ramuji?s 

growing confidence in me as an actress. I have also been cast in another Ram Gopal 

Varma film, Darwaza Bandh Rakho, to be directed by Chakravarthy, who had 

played the title role in Satya.

TUSSHAR KAPOOR 

K2H2 is a naughty situational comedy. Although 

I have done a little bit of comedy before in my earlier films, this is the first 

time I?m doing an out-and-out comedy. It was difficult to get into the character. 

I had to be very free in my body language. In fact Riteysh and I did a workshop 

before the film and once we got together again on the sets, we both warmed to 

our characters. Comedy?s easy if you really enjoy it.

Sangeeth Sivan deserves the tag of cool more than 

anybody else in the team. He is clear about what he wants, very tech-savvy and 

essentially a young-at-heart person. He?s more like a friend and doesn?t scare 

you. Neha is a bold North Indian kind of a person, always planning something after 

pack-up. Ishaa is a very hardworking actress and kind of tomboyish, always advising 

us about what to do.

In a home production, there are pluses and minuses. 

The plus: you feel a lot more free, as if you are at home. But it also means that 

you are not just an actor, you have the added burden of so many other departments. 

There?s the added pressure of how the film is looking, how everything is going. 

That our earlier home productions didn?t do well means that there was this added 

drive of making it work this time. It was challenging and enjoyable.

After K2H2, I am talking to a lot of directors 

about a lot of projects but nothing?s finalised as of now. There?s an offer from 

Suneel Darshan. I am also slated to do Manish Malhotra?s film and there?s also 

a project with Satish Kaushik. Subhash Ghai wants to repeat the same duo of Riteysh 

and me in one of his forthcoming productions.

NEHA DHUPIA 

The Balaji team members are great people to work with. 

I have no complaints. People say that they are tough taskmasters but I didn?t 

face any such problem. I never felt I was working with someone who is the producer?s 

brother. None of that. All of us were treated equally. 

I have worked with Ishaa before. As for the others, 

we worked like a bunch of friends. I didn?t even feel that I was working. 

It doesn?t matter that K2H2 is a multistarrer 

and has more than one heroine. It was never like she is doing better than me or 

I have to impress more than her. The production has to be good ? that?s the modesty 

that comes with a quality project.

Director Sivan is just excellent. He is like a mad 

scientist since he treats comedy like science. As for me, comedy is all about 

timing. It is the result of a good action-reaction pair. Both Tusshar and Riteysh 

are good at it and so the reaction comes easy. In fact, the film is all madness 

and I was brought in to provide method to the madness.

Sheesha?s failure doesn?t matter to me that 

much since a star?s track record isn?t about the number of hits and flops but 

all about how she?s performed in the particular film. Also, one has to move on 

and learn from past mistakes. 

After K2H2, I have Harry Baweja?s Mute, 

Guddu Dhanoa?s Siskiyan and Punjabi Bahu.

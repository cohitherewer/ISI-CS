 Whisk-away near school

 - Rs 20-lakh demand on phone for release of Class IX student

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three days after the disturbing disappearance and return of Behala?s 16-year-old Utsab Manna, a 14-year-old boy was allegedly kidnapped near his school in Baruipur.

 On Wednesday morning, Amit Parbat, a Class IX student of Baruipur High School, was whisked away by armed men on the southern fringes of the city. Soon after, Amit?s father received a ransom call for Rs 20 lakh, in his Salt Lake office.

 Police have been alerted and night-long raids planned to try to trace the boy in South 24-Parganas and its adjoining districts.

 Amit left home around 10.30 am to appear for his Bengali exam in school, around six km away. Father Anil Parbat, a senior employee with the water resources department, received a call around 11 am from Amit, who sounded very nervous.

 ?Some people forcibly pushed me into an auto. They are threatening me with dire consequences. Please rescue me from their clutches,? said Amit, before the mobile phone from which the teenager was calling was disconnected.

 Parbat called up home to speak to his wife and found out when Amit had left home. The next call, to the school, confirmed his worst fears, as the authorities there said Amit had not reached.

 Around 12.15 pm, another call, this time from one of the alleged kidnappers, came through to one of Parbat?s office colleagues.

 ?Hand over Rs 20 lakh in cash within 48 hours and we will set Amit free. Or else, you might not see him alive again,? the kidnapper warned in Bengali. ?Keep the money ready and we will tell you where to deliver it,? he added, before hanging up.

 Parbat then rushed to Bidhannagar (North) police station and requested them to take up the matter.

 But Bidhannagar police toed the territorial line and diverted Parbat?s plea to Baruipur police station, under whose jurisdiction the kidnap case apparently fell.

 ?But the calls were all made here, not in Baruipur. Why can?t you do anything?? demanded Parbat, but in vain.

 Parbat then went to Baruipur police station and lodged a missing diary, before turning to acting police superintendent Chanchal Dutta for help.

 Dutta took up the matter and advised Parbat to keep Bhageesh Mishra, inspector general of police (South Bengal) posted.

 ?We are doing whatever is required to save the boy as well as flush out the kidnappers. At the moment, we cannot reveal anything else,? said Dutta, late on Wednesday.

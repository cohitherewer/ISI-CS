 After retailing from her Ballygunge home for the past three years, designer Jyoti Khaitan finally launched her exclusive showroom called dstudio on Loudon Street last week.

 It has always been a dream to launch my own studio. In fact, three years ago, I had resolved that Id either open my own boutique in the next three years or quit designing. Im really glad my dream has finally come true, smiled the young designer.

 And the plush 3,000 sq ft studio was inaugurated by none other than actress and anchor Mandira Bedi, who came down to Calcutta on Friday to light the inaugural lamp.

 The swank and sprawling showroom, done up in a combination of glass and wood, has different sections displaying mens and womens wear, as well as a lounge area where customers can make up their mind at leisure.

 The racks house opulent and ornate couture saris and lehngas as well as stylish westerns and Indo-westerns. The line of saris and lehngas currently on show features intricate embroidery embedded with lots of stones, crystals and metallic embellishments.

 Jytois saris are exquisite. They are very opulent and great as Indian occasion wear. I just love the fancy blouses, smiled Mandira, mingling with the guests.

 The inauguration was attended by Patton chief Sanjay Budhia, actress Koneenica Banerjee, model Riya Mitra and theatre personality Renu Roy among others.

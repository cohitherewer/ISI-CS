The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Land scan for Lake squatters

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a renewed bid to find a solution to the relocation of over 25,000 shanty-dwellers on railway land along the Rabindra Sarobar, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government said on Wednesday it would urge the railway ministry to find land for the project.

 ?I have written to the Union railway minister, asking for land out of the vast pool at the disposal of the railways,? urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Wednesday.

 The eviction of the 1,200-odd families from land on either side of railway tracks behind Rabindra Sarobar was stalled on March 2 in the face of stiff resistance put up by the settlers, with strong support from Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress. 

 The government twice failed to carry out court orders to evict the squatters, fearing large-scale violence.

 Bhattacharjee had criticised the railways for ignoring their responsibility towards these people. He had also said the government could not evict them forcefully. 

 ?We cannot be irresponsible even if the railways are ignoring their responsibility,? the chief minister had said after the drive was called off by the state government.

 In his letter to the railway minister, the urban development minister has said that alternative accommodation could be arranged for squatters with funds from the Centre-sponsored Valmiki Ambedkar Avasan Yojana .

 ?I have already spoken to Union minister for urban employment and poverty alleviation Kumari Selja on this issue,? Bhattacharya said.

 ?While half the money for the project will come from the Yojana, the other half will have to be paid by the interested parties. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has committed Rs 1 crore, while local MP Mamata Banerjee has promised to contribute another Rs 50 lakh,? the minister elaborated.

 Bhattacharya said the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will also contribute Rs 2 crore for the project, in addition to providing infrastructure development at the project site.

 ?However, the balance will have to be paid by those who will benefit from the project,? the minister maintained.

 The CMDA has identified unutilised land at Majherhat and Howrah, which can be used for the project.

 ?The chief minister is very keen to see that these people are rehabilitated elsewhere,? he added.

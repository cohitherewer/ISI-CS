The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The road-washing programme undertaken by Calcutta Municipal Corporation is 

commendable. However, the timing of the washing needs to be changed. Quite often, 

the road-washing vehicles are seen blocking busy roads during office time causing 

traffic snarls. Also, the temporary accumulation of water on the roads causes 

inconvenience to pedestrians, who are drenched by passing cars. The car-washing 

vehicles even violate traffic rules and regulations. The mayor needs to pay attention 

to the problems. 

 Sumant Poddar, 

Kyd Street. 

 The train journey between Sealdah and Gede, under the Sealdah division, is 

more than three hours in duration. Since the local train compartments do not have 

toilets, commuters, especially the aged and children, have to face great discomfort 

during the journey. I have seen many children urinating inside the compartments, 

and I can?t blame them. I request the railway minister to consider installing 

toilets in local train compartments.

 I recently noticed labourers cleaning manholes on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. This 

system of using human beings to clean sewers is in vogue in the city for many 

years. Cities like Mumbai and Delhi have, however, moved on. Automatic suction 

vans are used there to clean manholes. I request the authorities to take steps 

to introduce similar vans in Calcutta.

Pollock Street. 

 The rise in prices of petrol and diesel almost always leads to hike in bus 

fares. Even if there is a marginal increase in petrol and diesel prices, the private 

bus fares are instantly revised upwards. However, when fuel prices come down, 

the bus fares are not proportionately decreased. Unfortunately, despite regular 

increase in ticket prices, travelling in private buses is a hazard. The seats 

are in a deplorable condition and do not have proper backrest. Elderly people 

and children have to suffer the most due to the infrastructural deficiencies. 

The operators are requested pay more attention to the problems faced by passengers. 

 Rimli Datta, 

Salt Lake. 

 The Calcutta State Transport Corporation bus terminus on the maidan is in a 

bad shape. The walls are dirty, the loud speakers have broken down, number plates 

at the ticket counters are missing and the boards displaying the bus timings are 

illegible.

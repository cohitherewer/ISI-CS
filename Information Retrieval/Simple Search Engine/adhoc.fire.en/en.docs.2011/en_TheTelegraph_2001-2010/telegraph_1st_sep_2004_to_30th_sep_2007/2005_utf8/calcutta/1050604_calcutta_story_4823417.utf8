The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Heat wave in ease-away mode

 - Day temperature drops as strong southerly winds begin to blow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The heat wave that hit Calcutta and the districts on Thursday started showing signs of remission on Friday, with the weatherman holding out the assurance that there was little chance of the mercury shooting up in the immediate future.

 The maximum temperature scaled down from a sizzling 40.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday to 38.2 degrees, three degrees above normal, on Friday. It is likely to hover around the 38-degree mark on Saturday, too. 

 However, the Met office has not withdrawn its heat wave warning for Calcutta and the districts, except for Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. 

 The day temperature touched 35.6 degrees at 11.30 am, and Calcuttans continued to suffocate in Friday?s stifling heat. 

 ?Despite a three-degree drop in the maximum temperature, we have not withdrawn the (heat wave) warning. We will take a decision on this score after a review at noon tomorrow,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section of the regional meteorological centre in Alipore. 

 He held out no hope of a shower in the next 24 hours. 

 Officers said a change in the wind patterns had effected the lowering of temperature. ?Yesterday, we had strong hot and dry winds from the central Indian plains across Bihar and Jharkhand and very little wind from the Bay of Bengal. This resulted in the steep rise in the day temperature. Today, a strong southerly wind has started blowing in from the sea at about 20 kph and the level of humidity has gone up,? signed off director Debnath.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State acquires clout to scrap vehicles 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Cabinet on Tuesday conferred on itself the power to decide an age-limit for commercial vehicles. The state can now prevent old commercial vehicles from plying on the road.

 The government?s efforts to phase out vehicles manufactured before 1975 were quashed by Calcutta High Court last year. The court had ruled that the government did not have the power to bar vehicles from the road, since the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules didn?t have such a provision.

 The state transport department had set December 31, 2004, as the deadline for owners of commercial vehicles manufactured before 1975 to remove them from roads in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. 

 ?The idea is to have newer vehicles, which are less polluting and more road-worthy. Our objective is to cut down on automobile emission to a large extent. In other metros like Mumbai and Delhi, the cut-off age for phasing out vehicles is 15 to 20 years,? a department official said.

 A section of owners challenged the government?s authority to phase out old vehicles in court, which ruled in the petitioners? favour. 

 This time, the transport department is proceeding methodically.

 On January 10, the department amended the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules, inserting a Section 88 A, which gives powers to ?the state government to impose special conditions on permit plying of transport vehicles (passenger as well as goods) beyond a particular age and in any particular area of the state?. 

 ?We were required to have this power by the court before phasing out ?old? vehicles. The Cabinet today approved the move to confer on us the power to decide on the age-limit of vehicles,? said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Writers? Buildings on Tuesday evening.

 According to transport department officials, the cut-off date for phase-out of vehicles is likely to be 1985. Department officials, however, are pitching for 1990. The matter is likely to be decided at the highest level.

 ?In all likelihood, it will be a political decision, since it concerns the transport lobby,? said a department official.

 A survey by the department has shown only 15 per cent of the vehicles on the road have been manufactured before 1985.

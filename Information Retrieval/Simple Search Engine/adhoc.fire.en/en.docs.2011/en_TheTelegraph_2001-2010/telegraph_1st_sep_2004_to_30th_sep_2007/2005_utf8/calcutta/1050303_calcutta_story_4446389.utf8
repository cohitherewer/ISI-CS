 Experts? team on underground toilet

 BY A STAFF REPORTER

 The high court on Wednesday ordered the formation of an experts? committee to study the feasibility of the proposal that the proposed toilet and the pump-house in the green park, off Victoria Memorial, be constructed underground.

 The proposal was submitted to the court by environment activist Subhas Dutta. 

 The division bench of Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutta issued the order after examining the report of the public works department (PWD) and hearing out all the parties concerned. 

 The three-member committee will comprise director-general (civil) of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, PWD executive engineer and the CPWD executive engineer. 

 The panel will have to submit its report within two weeks.

 Dutta had moved the high court green bench, alleging that air pollution in the area surrounding Victoria Memorial was damaging the white marble of the monument. 

 A study conducted 10 years ago by the National Institute of Research on Environment Engineering, too, had indicated that the marble was slowly degrading. 

 The green bench had set up a committee of 13 experts to study the effect of air pollution on the marble and prepare a report. 

 The experts had suggested a number of measures, the most important of which was to impose a ban on fairs on the grounds adjacent to Victoria Memorial. 

 The court suggested that a green park be developed to act as a ?buffer zone? and protect the monument from pollution.

 The civic body and the city police took up the responsibility of building the park, work on which is in progress. 

 Green activist Dutta?s current petition was filed when the authorities decided to construct a toilet and a pump-house within the park.

 Dutta has claimed that the facilities would add to the air pollution of the pocket.

 Visual diary of travels with friend

 When they hold exhibitions, photographers usually clamour for space and more space to offset their work. 

 Dayanita Singh reverses this trend. Her current exhibition of 31 small black-and-white photographs at Max Mueller Bhavan occupies not more space than what a largish ruler that engineers use would.

 They are arranged like playing cards being shuffled and placed inside a case of protective glass. 

 It is an intimate format, which forces viewers to stick their eyeballs into the glass casing to catch the details of each photograph. 

 One photograph of a press conference at Max Mueller Bhavan is so tiny it looks like a crowd of pinheads. Because of the size of the photographs, even sights that we see everyday look unfamiliar in spite of the sense of d?j? vu. 

 She chose this format because the photographs are meant to be something of a visual diary that she kept while travelling with ?a friend or sometimes, even while just thinking of a friend,? she explains in a footnote to the exhibition. This began in 2001.

 By the next year, she had composed ?little books as a private letter to the person I made the journey with.? Their ?accordion? style made it possible to pack in and juxtapose unlikely images that one often sees in a family album. 

 In a way, the format allows her to display more photographs all together at the same time than hanging individual pictures would ever have.

 In January, when G?nter Grass visited Calcutta, her publisher Gerhard Steidl, who also brings out Grass? works, invited Singh to accompany them. The exhibition is the outcome of that encounter in a city that she says she cannot resist visiting.

 So, along with them, she does the rounds of spots that no discerning visitor can afford to miss, such as College Street, Coffee House, the book-binders, Kumartuli and Grand Hotel, where the great German author stayed during his sojourn, and the Aphrodite of Singhee Park.

 In spite of the novel format, the photographs themselves are remarkable ? notwithstanding the impact created by Durga?s oversized foot in the foreground, the defamiliarised driveway of the famous hotel and the car wearing a plastic cover parked next to a cow in the backyard of a bookbinder?s workshop?

 This reviewer thinks not in spite of the occasional sparks ? like the one of Gerhard Steidl smiling at the goat he faces and the electric moonshine in a photographer?s. Perhaps because of their size, they lack the disquieting quality that made her series on interiors of Calcutta homes so outstanding.

 Perhaps that is why she chose not to blow these up.

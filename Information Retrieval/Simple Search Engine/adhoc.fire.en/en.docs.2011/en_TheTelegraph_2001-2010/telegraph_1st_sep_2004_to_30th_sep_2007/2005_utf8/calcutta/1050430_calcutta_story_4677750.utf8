 Teen kidnaps himself

 - 14-year-old in self-abduction drama full of loopholes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A staged disappearance, a self-inflicted injury and a ransom call home, demanding all of Rs 10,000. That was the plan hatched ? and botched ? by a 14-year-old boy.

 On Thursday, the student of Class VIII played out his own abduction drama full of amateur loopholes.

 The victim was caught playing villain just as he was about to make the third ?ransom? call to his own father.

 The boy?s father had lodged a complaint with the West Port police station, fearing his son had really been abducted.

 The boy had left home for school in the West Port area around 10.30 am. The first ransom call was received by his father, owner of a brick kiln, around 2 pm.

 ?The caller was using abusive language. ?Jodi chheleke jibito pete chan, Rs 10,000 ready rakhben (If you want your son back alive, keep Rs 10,000 ready)?. The caller disconnected without saying where the money should be dropped off,? the boy?s father explained to police. The boy had disguised his voice, so the father was unable to recognise it.

 The distraught parent dialled the cops around 4 pm, when the second call came. This time, too, the caller spoke in the same way. He asked whether the money was ready or not.

 But the content of the call didn?t ring true to the cops. ?The demand was for only Rs 10,000. It was enough to make us suspect whether it was a real abduction or not,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (port division).

 Both calls had been made from telephone booths near the Hooghly Jute Mill, in the port division.

 Police also learnt that the boy?s mother had asked him to book a cooking-gas cylinder before he had left for school. The boy did book the cylinder around 3 pm, an hour after the first ?ransom? call. He had also skipped three papers of his final exams.

 Armed with the boy?s photograph, police kept a close eye on the telephone booths near the jute mill. ?He was soon spotted entering a booth. We surrounded him and picked him up. Before bringing him to the police station, we took him to RG Kar Hospital, where doctors confirmed his injuries ?scratches on the hands and a bruise on the face ? were self-inflicted,? explained police.

 The boy was sent back home, at Akra Fatak, in the Rabindranagar police station area, after his father withdrew the complaint, said Ranade. The boy confessed to the plot during interrogation.

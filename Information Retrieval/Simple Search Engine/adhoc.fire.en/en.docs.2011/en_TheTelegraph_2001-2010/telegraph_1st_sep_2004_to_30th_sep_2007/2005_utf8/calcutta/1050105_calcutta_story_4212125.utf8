 Robbers of bank held, thrashed 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four armed dacoits stormed a Golf Green bank on Tuesday afternoon and pulled off a daring heist. But while leaving, two of them were overpowered by local residents, along with a substantial part of the loot.

 The duo was severely beaten up and is now in hospital. ?One of them, Nageswar Paswan, had masterminded the robbery,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. ?He had got out of jail barely three months ago and had been involved in a string of dacoities.? 

 The other told police he had joined the gang because he needed money for his daughter?s forthcoming Higher Secondary examination.?

 The duo?s interrogation has established the identity of the other two who escaped, as well as that of the driver of the taxi in which they came to the bank. Reconstructing the botched heist, police said the gang arrived in front of the UCO Bank branch around 2.20 pm.

 While the driver remained in the vehicle, the four entered the bank brandishing revolvers and sharp weapons. 

 They ordered the 20-odd people inside to kneel down and remain silent.

 One went over to the teller counter and another to the vault. Both started stuffing money into their bags. After a neat clean-up of Rs 1.5 lakh, the gang decided to flee.

 But as they were leaving, one of the employees shouted for help. His cries drew the attention of next-door resident Rabi Shankar Bal.

 Bal ran out and on spotting the dacoits, starting hurling bricks at them. Police constable Swapan De, who was among the customers, came out next and grabbed one of them. 

 Alarmed, the other two hurled bombs, jumped into the taxi and fled. By this time, the crowd that had gathered in front of the bank started assaulting the other two. Police later admitted them to hospital.

 Local residents Bal and Tushar Haldar and a third, yet unidentified, were injured in the explosions. ?We recovered Rs 99,000 of the booty. Constable De was rewarded with Rs 3,000 by the director-general of police for bravery,? police superintendent Gupta said.

 According to branch assistant manager Shivaji Mitra, the bank has neither a security guard nor a safety alarm mechanism.

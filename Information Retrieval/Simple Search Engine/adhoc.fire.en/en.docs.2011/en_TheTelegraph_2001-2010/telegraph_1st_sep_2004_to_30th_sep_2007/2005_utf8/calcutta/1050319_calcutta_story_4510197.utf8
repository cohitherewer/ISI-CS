 Entry fee suit shift to Delhi 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Victoria Memorial Hall authorities will move the Supreme Court against the high court?s order on introduction of an entry fee for morning walkers.

 This was stated by the Memorial?s lawyer in the high court on Friday, during the hearing of a case relating to the environment of the areas surrounding the monument.

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutt asked the lawyer to file an affidavit stating the decision of his client. 

 The lawyer?s statement was in response to a question by the bench, asking why the Memorial authorities had not, despite orders from the high court, imposed the entry fee from February 1. The bench was informed about the violation by the petitioner, green activist Subhas Dutta. 

 Sources said the state government had asked the Memorial not to introduce the entry fee, as it would create problems for morning walkers. 

 ?The authorities do not want any confrontation with the government on the issue,? an official said.

 During the hearing, government pleader Rabilal Moitra asked the petitioner: ?Why are you so keen on an entry fee?? 

 He submitted that Dutta, being the petitioner, had no right to demand the introduction of an entry fee on the Memorial premises. 

 Dutta told the court that the monument could not be saved from degradation unless the entry of visitors was restricted. ?It is a court-appointed expert committee that had recommended the imposition of an entry fee,? he said. 

 Another court-appointed committee submitted its report on Friday, stating that the construction of an underground toilet and pump house in the proposed park near the Memorial was not feasible.

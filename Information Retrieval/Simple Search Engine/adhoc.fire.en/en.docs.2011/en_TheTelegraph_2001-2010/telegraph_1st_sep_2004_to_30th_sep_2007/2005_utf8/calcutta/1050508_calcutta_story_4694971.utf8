 A thought or three for friends furry

 I get swamped with queries on how to handle cats. Here are answers to some of the basic things most of you need to know.

 My cat enjoys milk and I give her a small amount two or three times a week. I?ve read somewhere that milk is not good for cats. 

 Generally speaking, milk is not recommended for adult cats as many of them are lactose-intolerant and have problems digesting it. However, if she?s not throwing up or suffering from diarrhoea, she?s probably okay with it. 

 How do I clean my cat?s ears? 

 Mites leave black, sticky gunk. You may need to clean your cat?s ears in order to administer medication or just as a part of regular grooming. Warm olive oil or ear cleaner to body temperature. Put one to two drops of the liquid into the round opening of the ear canal and massage the base of the ear for at least a minute. Leave your cat alone for five minutes. A lot of head shaking will dislodge the dirt and move it into the outer ear canal. Use clean cotton balls to wipe it away.

 Both my husband and I are working. Our cat starts playing in the middle of the night, turning the house upside down. What should I do?

 It can be annoying when your cat behaves in this way. But actually, the night is the prime hunting time for cats in the wild. Jumping over furniture and knocking over everything in his path may be his way of looking for ?prey?. Another reason for cats behaving this way is when their human families are away all day. The cat sleeps so it can be awake and active when his human family is home. Spend time with your cat. Before going to bed, wear him out with interactive toys so that he gets to spend time with you, yet gets tired just before you go to bed. 

 What is declawing and why is it not recommended for cats with a destructive scratching habit?

 Declawing is the surgical removal of the claws in which the entire first joint of each of the cat?s ?toes? is amputated. A declawed cat?s toe stubs will be severely painful for days or weeks after the surgery, and ?phantom limb pain? may be a lifelong issue. Some litterbox contents are very painful for the cat?s tender paws and he may avoid the litterbox entirely because of its association with pain. A cat?s claws are his primary defence, without which he may turn to biting. Many become withdrawn and depressed. Pain in the toes can also cause changes in their normal gait, which eventually causes stiffness and pain in legs, hips and spine.

 Cats need to scratch as it is an ingrained need to help maintain their primary source of defence and to develop strong muscles and connective tissue. Scratching won?t be a problem if you recognise this need and provide alternatives in the form of scratch posts. This is essential for exercise, stress relief and claw management, and will also save your furniture. Scratch posts are available in pet shops. You can get cardboard pieces which cats love to scratch. You can also trim your cat?s nails. If you are unsure, ask your vet to do it. You can use a double-sided tape on the arms/sides of furniture to discourage scratching. Cats dislike the sticky feel.

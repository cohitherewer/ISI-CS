 An elephantine affair

 Sundarams comic satire Operation Bhomragarh exposes through the medium of laughter, the misuse and desecration of public funds and the violation of people?s freedom by the state. The play begins with the kidnapping of Alhadi, the pet white elephant of King Bhramarchandra of Bhomragarh, by Brindaban, a notorious jungle bandit. A dreamer by nature, the king is bankrupt and fails to pay up the ransom for the elephant?s release. The people of his kingdom also refuse to help their unworthy king. Meanwhile, the Rajabahadur of the neighbouring Mayurhati sees in the situation an opportunity to fulfil his monumental mission of ridding the world of all terrorists and criminals. He immediately enters the scene equipped with missiles, tanks, helicopters and other impressive, modern weapons, only to bring more disaster and calamity upon an already beleaguered people. It is finally left to a young snake charmer to come to the rescue, his enchanted flute bringing an end to Brindaban and to the evil designs of the emperor of Mayurhati. Drama and direction: Manoj Mitra.

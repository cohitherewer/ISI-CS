The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Romancing the written word

 In a dreary world where cryptic messages 

 rule over letters, Samir Mukerjee reflects on his adventures 

 as a writer

 I can?t remember when I started 

 toying with the idea of writing. A mild desire lurked in 

 the shadows without knowing how to come out into the open. 

 This probably happened when I joined office and found the 

 work less then inspiring. 

 In the early Seventies, my wife 

 and I chanced upon the poet, Pritish Nandy, who was then 

 working at Guest Keen Williams. At that time he used to 

 publish a magazine, Dialogue India, which contained 

 translations of poems from different regional languages 

 and some original poems in English as well. 

 In those days Leftist poetry was 

 all the rage and Pritish suggested that I should translate 

 as many poems as I could from Sukanta Bhattacharya?s Chharpatra. 

 Needless to say he was an avid Communist poet who died too 

 young. 

 I approached the job with a good 

 deal of trepidation but the process of translation proved 

 less formidable that I thought it would be. That was the 

 first time I wielded a pen and succeeded in overcoming my 

 diffidence. Once Pritish set out for greener pastures elsewhere 

 Dialogue India folded up. This was my first encounter 

 with poems with a social message. 

 It?s quite extraordinary that 

 I should meet the uncompromising and scrupulously honest 

 journalist, Samar Sen, shortly after this. His days as a 

 poet were over but he was running the hard left magazine 

 Frontier with a good deal of success. He told me 

 he was looking for someone to review Bengali plays which 

 had reached their peak then and were storming the public 

 halls. The sheer abundance of such plays was a unique phenomenon. 

 He wanted me as a critic for his magazine and I took up 

 this assignment with all the enthusiasm I could summon up. 

 My wife and I were at the Academy of Fine Arts every week 

 and sometimes it used to be Muktangan at South Calcutta 

 where Souvanik staged their plays regularly. 

 I was exposed to a much larger 

 world than I had ever expected to be in. Imbued with some 

 sort of passion I wrote my reviews with a flourish. Names 

 like Dwijen Bandopadhyay, Kumar Roy, Bibhash Chakravarty, 

 Utpal Dutt, Asoke Mukherjee, Nilkantha Sengupta, Manoj Mitra 

 and Jochhan Dastidar meant something to me at last. The 

 burning issues of the day found their expression on the 

 stage and raised the consciousness of an audience which 

 was becoming a victim of a pervasive cynicism. 

 My amateurish efforts were appreciated 

 by a number of directors and I learnt a lot about the world 

 of drama as I went along. Between inflammatory political 

 and satirical plays my world was in a state of flux. I was 

 educating myself at every step. In such a situation it was 

 difficult to be politically neutral. There was this fascination 

 with the political workings underlying events. 

 When the Emergency was declared 

 in mid 1975, the Frontier suddenly became a subversive 

 magazine and censors were using their scissors liberally. 

 As they did their job ineptly, they became objects of ridicule. 

 They encroached on my reviews as well. 

 One thing led to another. A lively 

 young man with literary pretensions, Shankar Dasgupta, came 

 into our lives in the mid Seventies. It was his ardent desire 

 to see me burgeon as a Bengali poet. 

 The suggestion seemed outrageous 

 at first but since I had a fair knowledge of my own mother 

 tongue and used to read Tagore, Jibanananda, Sudhin Dutta, 

 Subhash Mukhopadhyay, Sunil Gangopadhyay and Shakti Chattopadhyay 

 amongst others, I felt I could turn to words and images 

 to express my deeper emotions which were simply waiting 

 to be released. I wrote about a dozen or more poems which 

 Shankar published in a small paperback edition with the 

 attractive title Momer mato pore Kolkata. What I 

 saw and felt deeply, gained a recognisable shape.

 When my style had improved and 

 the urge to write had acquired a sense of urgency, my patron 

 and benefactor, Kiron Sankar Sengupta, encouraged me to 

 contribute poems for his well-established magazine Sahitya 

 Chinta. He was a very well- known poet himself and had 

 begun his literary career from the time he was in Dhaka 

 in the Twenties and Thirties. With him on my side, I found 

 a proper footing but I never wrote prolifically to become 

 part of a magic circle. Once Kiron babu died, Sahitya 

 Chinta dropped out of circulation and my poetic effervescence 

 slowly ebbed away. The honeymoon with poetry was over once 

 and for all. 

 During this interregnum, another 

 friend working for Amrita Bazar Patrika requested me to 

 contribute articles for its Sunday supplement, The Interface. 

 I turned to pure prose, using my pen like a sword and feeling 

 like Don Quixote on Rosinante. Memories from yesteryear 

 came flooding in and I churned out one article after another, 

 delving into the past like as excavator. If it wasn?t for 

 his warm words of encouragement and belief in my ability 

 to write, I wouldn?t have made the progress I did. 

 When Amrita Bazar started 

 wavering and ultimately fizzled out, I found myself off 

 duty like a liftman with a broken down lift? At this juncture, 

 my friend, Nandita Das, the actress, brought a young man 

 from The Telegraph, one afternoon to see us. Nandita 

 told him that my letters to her were full of sparkle and 

 exciting ideas and she wanted him to give me a chance to 

 write for his paper.

 That is how my reminiscences began 

 again for a wider audience. Most of the interesting aspects 

 of my life were unfolded, dusted and sired in these articles. 

 My memory served me well and the dead rose from their graves, 

 their faces wreathed in smiles. I had no idea that dredging 

 up the past could arouse the dormant enthusiasm of so many 

 readers belonging to different ages and persuasions.

 It was an exhilarating experience 

 to carry people with me in a fast-moving boat along a swiftly 

 flowing river. I was in a world where the expressive word, 

 spoken or written, still seemed paramount and I felt I was 

 the beneficiary of the inevitable solace that right language 

 brings. 

 In a dreary, mechanical world 

 where cryptic messages are becoming substitutes for epistolary 

 adventures and people are forgetting how to formulate simple 

 sentences, it?s a pleasure to travel in the opposite direction. 

 At the end one can only sum it 

 up in the following lines: 

 ?We were the last romantics, 

 chose for theme 

 Traditional sanctity and loveliness.?

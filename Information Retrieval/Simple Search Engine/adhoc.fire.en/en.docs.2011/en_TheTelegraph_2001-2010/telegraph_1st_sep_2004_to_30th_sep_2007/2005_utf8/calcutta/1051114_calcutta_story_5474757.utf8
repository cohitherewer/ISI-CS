The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Prince Charles

 Your personal commitments come before money. You are friendly, casual, diplomatic,

 willing to share and 

cooperate. You project

an image of courtesy

and reserve, coupled 

with charisma. Social 

work, welfare

programmes,

rehabilitation work

and helping others

suit you fine. mdash; Kusum Bhandari

 Nik Nish, 22, Camac Street

 l How much

 Rs 50 onwards

 Health, hygiene and water resources may still be the primary concerns of your shower rooms, but that is not where it stops. You can do much more with this space that has progressed from being a mere utility room to a glamour room.

 To add to the style statement of your bathrooms, you can experiment with a set of clay accessories on offer at Nik Nish on Camac Street.

 The set consisting of toothbrush holders, liquid soap holders, razor holders and soap stands comes in a wide variety of shapes and solid colours.

 The one thing making these products unique is the additional finish of ceramic, glass or bronze embroidery on clay, rendering an element of real style.

 Says Shahbaz Zaman of Nik Nish: ?These accessories have an ethnic look and work wonders when fused with the glamour room concept of today. They look excellent against a glazed tiled background, whatever the colour, light or dark. Placing them around the pedestal of your washbasin can give a different look to the place.?

 The toothbrush holders in the shapes of animals like cats, dogs and a cat with her kitten in ceramic finish could be an absolute delight for your kids. 

 The brightly-coloured orange and blue ones with four stands in the shape of a leg each is also a must see.

 ?The toothbrush holders have been created in shapes so that kids are attracted naturally towards them. With the look of it being more of a plaything than a utility product, kids will for once remain glued in front of the wash basin, till they finish with their brushing,? Zaman smiles.

 The soap holders, razor holders and soap stands that are part of a single set come in nice floral prints, an embroidered look or bronze borders on a brown base, giving the accessories an antique finish. They have been styled in a sleek way and could add a lot to the glamour quotient of your shower room, making it a place for complete indulgence.

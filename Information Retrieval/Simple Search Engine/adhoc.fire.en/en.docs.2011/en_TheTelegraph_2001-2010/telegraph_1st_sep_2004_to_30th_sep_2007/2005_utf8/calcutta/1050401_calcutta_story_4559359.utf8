 Boyhood days in Bangladesh, student life in London, political career in Calcutta ? the memories came rushing back, as Jyoti Basu sat in the Nandan balcony watching himself on the big screen, flanked by Mrinal Sen.

 Jyoti Basur Songe (A Journey with Jyoti Basu), the two-hour documentary by Goutam Ghose, brought to Nandan on Thursday evening the chief minister, members of his cabinet, leading industrialists and film-makers. But there was no doubting who the star of the special show was ? the 91-year-old politician whose life, known and unknown, came alive on screen.

 ?Thanks to Goutam for refreshing my memory. I had almost forgotten I had said so many things. This film will serve as a historical document,? said Basu, as he left the state auditorium, left hand clutching the right arm of successor Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Through Basu?s recollections, the film captures the story of his life and our times ? from the turbulent student days in London to the underground activities of the Communist party, the formation of his own team in Calcutta to his rise to the peak of power, his decision to withdraw from an active political life to the quiet days he now spends in Indira Bhavan.

 ?I decided to make this documentary on Jyoti Basu as he is one of the few living politicians to have seen seven decades of the political scenario, nationally and internationally. I wanted to try and understand his perspective,? said Ghose, who trailed Basu from 1997 to 2004, across continents and campaigns. Jyoti Basur Songe will be released in a few theatres across Bengal.

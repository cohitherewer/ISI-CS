 State of ethnic fashion

 Assam is famous for its tea estates and wildlife reserves. But the states indigenous handicrafts, fabrics, textiles and fashion do not get the spotlight they deserve.

 Assams handloom is basically silk-oriented because the climatic conditions support sericulture. But there is no dearth of other raw materials either. While in other parts of the country, handloom is done by professionals, in Assam it is a household industry, said M.I. Laskar, tourism minister, Assam.

 Laskar was speaking at Splendours of Assam, jointly presented by Assam Tourism and Indian Chamber of Commerce, on Tuesday evening.

 The basic purpose of the show is to highlight the positive aspects of Assam, including its handlooms and the garment industry, he added.

 The presentation at The Oberoi Grand was followed by a four-sequence fashion show highlighting the fabrics, jewellery and other accessories of the north-eastern state.

 Mekhla Patani (lower garment for women), chaddar, gamochha (towel), dhoti and bed sheets were displayed by the models.

 The fabrics used were moonga, pat silk and cri silk.

 Not just jewels

 Two things an Indian woman can never get enough of are clothes and jewellery, and Mahua Sarkar Sens exhibition at Genesis Art Gallery from September 8 to 10 has the right mix of both.

 The highlight of her collection is the extensive repertoire of sterling silver jewellery that takes in both tribal-ethnic and modern.

 There are silver neckpieces, Buddha lockets, bracelets and earrings ? all with interesting motifs, some on semi-precious stones, and all with her signature alterations to choose from.

 The apparel section boasts a variety of handlooms sourced from across the country, including tribal areas. Carefully handcrafted kalamkari designs can be found on cotton saris, telia dupattas, salwars with banjaran embroidery and kitsch kurta pieces.

 Mahua also has on offer some ethnic handcrafted bomkais, unlike the computer-generated designs doing the rounds these days.

 There are some blouse pieces in different khadi textures with nakshikantha that can be mixed-and-matched to offset a handloom sari or double as jackets and short kurtis.

 If you are looking for something really offbeat, this collection is a must-see.

 Festive feel

 Jhumurs, a designer outlet at 167/3, Bidhan Sarani, celebrating its third anniversary on September 10, will exhibit a wide range of kurtas, salwar suits, saris and accessories for a whole week.

 The saris are both embroidered and printed crepes, georgettes, chiffons, silks and tangail, with patchwork along with bead embroidery.

 The salwars and churidars are embellished with heavy embroidery, whereas the straight kurtas are lightly worked upon.

 The designer has made use of both pastels and bright colours keeping in mind the festive season.

 While the saris are priced between Rs 300 and Rs 4,500, the salwar suits range from Rs 380 to Rs 2,500.

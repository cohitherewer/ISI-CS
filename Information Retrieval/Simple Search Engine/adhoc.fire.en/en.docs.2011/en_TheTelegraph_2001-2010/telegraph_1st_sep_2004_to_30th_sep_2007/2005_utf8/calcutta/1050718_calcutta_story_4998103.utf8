 An optimistic vision

 Artists with wholly dissimilar sets of styles and techniques, Saroj Sarkar (The Youth; picture above) and Naba Chakraborty nevertheless share a common vision in their paintings. Distinguished by a deceptive calm, their works have an innate seriousness and possess a sense of purpose and meaning which, at times, appears all but imperceptible. The exhibition of their paintings, in digital and acrylic mediums, is an attempt to discover innocence, beauty and happiness in contemporary urban society ignoring its troubles and torments. Depicting both joy and sorrow, their images of nature, along with that of birds, animals and human forms, ultimately paint a picture of hope and freedom, and the promise of a better life in the days ahead. Often surrealistic and illusory, their art is born of a poetic imagination, sharpened and heightened by a keen awareness of the present and a genuine concern for the future.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings

 When: July 18 - 24, 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery

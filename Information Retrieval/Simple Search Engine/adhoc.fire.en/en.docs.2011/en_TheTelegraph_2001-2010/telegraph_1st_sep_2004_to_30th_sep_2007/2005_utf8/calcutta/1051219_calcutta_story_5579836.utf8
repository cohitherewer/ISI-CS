Make-up artiste Abhijit Chanda reveals some handy 

tricks of his trade

 By now we all know what it takes to be all made-up like a beauty queen. The wish list begins with finding that perfect shade of foundation, tested near your jaw line of course. Predictably, it then goes on to finding those oh-so-flattering hues of lipsticks, shadows and more.

 How to get those sexy smoky eyes, how not to forget your neck while coating your face, where and when to brush that blush ? all that results from days of endless practice that promise you near perfection in the great art of make-up.

 as, theres something still amiss. Maybe its that super-professional touch that is far from near. GoodLife gets make-up expert Abhijit Chanda to divulge some tricks of the trade, from in and out of the book.

 Base routine

 CTM ? clean, tone and moisturise ? is the golden rule of make-up. And contrary to popular belief, this ones not just for theoretical purposes. Cleaning and toning take care of the obvious environmental dirt and also the alkaline balance of your skin.

 Moisturising it has more than one advantage ? not only does it help the make-up base glide on smoothly, the act of application of the cream itself is as a mini-massage for your face. It relaxes your facial muscles while improving the lymphatic drainage. As a result, your face looks and feels very fresh. But be sure to remove excess moisturiser, otherwise the foundation will not set well.

 Great-looking skin neednt worry much about the base. A sunscreen for the day and a tinted moisturiser for the night works just as well. But if foundation is a must, then dot some liquid foundation all over your face and blend with a sponge. Use a stick foundation as a concealer and then blend well.

 Finally, dust some translucent powder to lock in the base. Lightly remove any excess and your face is all ready to take on the colour, shimmer and sparkle.

 Brush basics

 Collecting two dozen professional brushes isnt exactly what the make-up gurus prescribe, but at the same time cutting it down to just one or two isnt wise either.

 Have at least five brushes in hand ? one each for the eye shadow, lips, eyebrows, powder and an angular one to contour features like cheekbones and jaw line.

 A soft, fat brush for the blush may look very tempting, but its better to use a smaller, slightly flatter brush to increase control of quantity and target the right spot, rather than just spreading the colour at random.

 Keeping these brushes clean is a must. Soak them in lukewarm water and shampoo for 10 minutes. Clean them by rolling them on your palm and let them dry naturally. View your brushes as an investment and youll look after them just right.

 Right light 

 The occasion and the time of the event are the deciding factors for the make-up, but applying it in the right light matters the most.

 Never under a tube light, make sure that you paint that grease always in a bright, yellow light.

 Daylight does just as well, but doing up your face at the mercy of a tube is the biggest beauty faux pas ever.

 Highlight zone 

 An Indian skin tone usually needs only two shades of blusher ? a brownish pink and peach. The fairer complexions can also add a third hue in the form of pink.

 Study your face carefully and ascertain the features you want to downplay. If you have a heavy chin, apply some darker blusher.

 Similarly, put some shadow on the sides of your nose and highlight the bridge with a light shimmer. If you have high cheekbones, apply the blush directly to accentuate them. If not, suck in your cheeks and dust a darker shade of blush below the cheekbones and a lighter one above.

 Use any form of highlighter carefully, lest it catches light in the wrong places.

 Mascara move

 Look up, chin up and then let the mascara magic begin. Start with your upper lashes from below. This helps in volumnising the lashes. Do the same from above and the result: perfectly curled lashes. Repeat this twice for a fuller effect. 

 For the lower lashes, hold your mascara vertically and brush past your lashes. Finally, use an eyebrow comb to separate any clumps.

 Eye appeal

 If your eyes are a little swollen or plump, then choose darker shadows that downplay them. Avoid a thick stroke of eye-liner, smudge the shadow and the liner well. Small and deep-set eyes call for thicker lines and lighter shades.

 If you have bags under the eyes, draw a thin line of kohl or liner. If you dont want to wear kohl, substitute it with some shadow.

 A great idea is to dab some light shimmery shadow on the centre of the eyelid, just above your eyeballs. The effect is simply stunning. 

 Eyebrows play a large role in framing your face and threading or plucking them is not enough.

 If your eyebrows are thick and jet black, then remember to swipe some transparent mascara to remove excess powder and foundation. If they are thin and scanty, dust some dark brown shadow for a finishing touch.

If they are neither thin nor heavy, a light touch 

of black mascara should do. Even out any kind of cut mark or scar with an eyebrow 

pencil. Finally, comb it out with an eyebrow comb.

 Luscious lips

 Lips lined harshly with a dark liner and then filled in with a lighter hue is pass?. 

 Opt for the natural look and top off with some clear gloss, preferably heavy in nature. Apply the gloss with a brush and feel the difference.

 To make the colour stay longer, apply some base on your lips while preparing your face.

 If the winter has made your lips dry and cracked, then smear with petroleum jelly as you begin with your face. 

 Go on to do your eyes and then re-apply the jelly on your lips. Smooth and in near-perfect condition again, your lips will then be ready for any colour, all for that sexy pout.

 Thick lips should avoid dark hues of lipsticks and thin lips can surely afford to experiment with many such hues.

 Neighbours storm lone woman?s flat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Driven by curiosity about the new occupant of an apartment, who happened to be a single woman, a few dozen residents of the Lake Town?s Green Park area barged into her flat on Monday. 

 Their excuse: she was ?too fast for the neighbourhood?. A gunshot was fired, leading to scuffles among residents of Gouri Apartments and occupants of the woman?s flat. 

 According to the apartment block?s security guard Uttam Ghosh, trouble broke out around 10.45 pm on Monday, when Ashok Das, a local thug, got curious about the new occupant. She had moved into a two-room flat on the ground floor three days ago. 

 Ghosh said Das is an alcoholic who slept in a vacant flat next door as part of an arrangement with the caretaker.

 ?Ashok tried to peep into the flat through the window pane. Those inside must have heard him, for a man soon came out, and asked me if I had seen anyone peeping,? said Ghosh, who stood a few feet away from the flat door.

 ?He spotted Ashok, who was hiding nearby, and as soon as I confirmed that he had been peeping, the man dragged him inside,? Ghosh added.

 Soon, a shot rang out and neighbours barged into the flat, triggering pandemonium, as the neighbours tried to attack the occupants.

 According to inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee, Subhasish Chatterjee, a film director, was with the woman when about 35 neighbours barged into her apartment.

 Police were alerted and on arrival, they arrested Subhro Sen, who lives on the fourth floor. ?We arrested Sen because we suspect that he incited the mob,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent, North 24-Parganas. 

 According to witnesses, Sen had arrived on the scene with a lathi and was instrumental in starting the scuffle. 

 According to neighbours and the caretaker, the woman had taken the apartment under an assumed name three days ago. ?The promoter of the building had told me that she would be coming to stay,? said Rambabu, the caretaker. 

 Both the caretaker and the security guard said residents were curious about the new occupant since she moved in, primarily because she had a lot of visitors.

 ?Around eight to nine men of different ages frequented the flat since she moved in,? said the caretaker, adding that many residents of this upper-middle class locality did not approve of her lifestyle. Police said the woman is a divorcee.

 ?We allowed her to go to her house in Howrah as she promised to help us. She is willing to produce documents relating to her stay in the flat,? said superintendent Kumar.

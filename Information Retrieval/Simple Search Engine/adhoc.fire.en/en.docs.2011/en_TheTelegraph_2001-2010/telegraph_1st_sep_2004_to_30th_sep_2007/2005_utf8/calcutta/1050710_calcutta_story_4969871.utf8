The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Their game, our rules

 If the ICC wants to tinker with the 

 One Day format, it should consult consumers and not experts

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Limited-overs 

 cricket has got a new set of rules. A group of wise men 

 led by Sunny Gavaskar has decided that henceforth One Day 

 matches will be played not with 11 but 12 men. Eleven will 

 take the field and start the match. At any time, the captain 

 can replace one of these 11 and bring in the 12th member, 

 called the Supersub.

 There is another change in the 

 rules. We are all used to watching batsmen hitting out in 

 the first 15 overs of a One Day innings. That happens because 

 the fielding team has to keep all but two of their fielders 

 away from the boundary ropes during this period. The cricket 

 committee of ICC felt that this period of opportunity given 

 to the batsmen should be extended by five more overs. 

 If you are wondering why these 

 changes have come about, the answer, surprising as it may 

 sound, is that these alterations aim to please you and me. 

 There is a growing realisation that we, the spectators and 

 audiences in front of TV sets, are falling asleep, especially 

 during the middle overs of a One Day match. Naturally ICC 

 is getting increasingly worried. After all, millions of 

 dollars are at stake.

 If you and I keep falling asleep 

 during One Day matches, then who will watch the ads between 

 the overs? If there is no one watching their ads then why 

 would advertisers pay ESPN or Sony or whoever for showing 

 the ads? If the channels are not being paid by the advertisers 

 then they in turn will not pay ICC for the rights to telecast 

 the matches. Then the bank balance of ICC will reduce drastically. 

 So you see, our falling asleep during a cricket match has 

 severe implications for ICC. No wonder they entrusted eminent 

 people like Gavaskar, Ranatunga, Tiger Pataudi and others 

 to come up with a plan to keep our eyes open.

 There is just one minor issue 

 in this whole reconstruction exercise. Whose eyes need to 

 be kept open? Certainly not of the players or the umpires 

 ? they still remain wide awake during a One Day match. If 

 this ever were to become an issue, ICC committee members 

 would be the right people to find an antidote for on-ground 

 dozing. After all, no one has spent more time on the cricket 

 ground than them.

 That unfortunately is the problem. 

 One hopes that the ICC realises that the experience of the 

 likes of Gavaskar or Pataudi is only from the 22 yards. 

 Chances are, the experts will miss all other points of view 

 completely.

 ICC should be concerned with these 

 other points of view only. For, it is we who buy toothpastes 

 and televisions. We bring in the advertising. And experts 

 are the least suitable group of people to know what we want. 

 For one, they do not share our ignorance. They have never 

 had the opportunity of watching a cricket match on TV with 

 the conviction that square cuts are played through square 

 leg.

 It is because of this blissful 

 state that our needs and wants are different. We also want 

 many changes in the rules of the One Day game. And they 

 would not be the ones that the experts can ever think of. 

 If ICC wants to know the full list, we will surely oblige. 

 For now, let us give only a couple of examples. We want 

 the likes of Sehwag and Sachin, Gilchrist and Afridi to 

 bat for a minimum of 20 overs each. Till then they cannot 

 be given out. When our skipper comes to the crease during 

 the first five, no make that 10 overs, any catch taken on 

 the off side, especially in the slip cordon, will be disallowed. 

 We are like that only. ICC needs 

 experts of cricket consumers, not cricket.

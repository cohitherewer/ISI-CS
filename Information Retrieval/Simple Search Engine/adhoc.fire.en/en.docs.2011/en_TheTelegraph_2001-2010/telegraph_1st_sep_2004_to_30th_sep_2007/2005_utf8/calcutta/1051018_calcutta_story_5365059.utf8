 From Neil Armstrong to the Royal family, Tom Cruise to Nicole Kidman, Pele to David Beckham, the list of celebrity stomachs his hand has fed is just endless. And now Calcuttans have the chance to enter The Ivy league.

 an Bird, head chef of The Ivy, 1 West Street, London, is here to give city foodies a taste of true blue British cuisine as he cooks up some of his specialities at West View Bar amp; Grill at ITC Sonar Bangla, from October 16 to 18.

 Ivy has been around since 1917. With a wall to wall celebrity clientele and a six-month wait for a table if you are not a regular, this is a place to see and be seen at.

 And its celebrity chef ? associated with The Ivy for the past 14 years, before which he was personal chef to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber ? seems more than mildly impressed by what hes seen on his first trip to an Asian country.

 I first landed in Delhi where I was at the Maurya Sheraton between October 12 and 15. I had heard loads about this place being full of colours and vibrancy before coming here. And every bit of it is true, be it in terms of people or places.

 In Delhi, I visited the INA market and picked up some Indian spices known for its flavours all over the world. I am yet to explore the markets of Calcutta and am particularly keen on checking out the fish markets, as Bengalis I know are very fond of fish, before I move to Mumbai.

 To star tables in Calcutta, Bird promises to bring some of the best of The Ivy cuisine, the hallmark of which is traditional British food.

 While preparing the menu, we have taken care to strike a balance between vegetarian and non- vegetarian fare. Keeping in mind the ongoing festive season, we are offering no beef dishes. This is a speciality of The Ivy, where we keep changing our menus keeping in mind the season.

 A myth Bird is out to bust is the blandness associated with British cuisine. Not every Briton is wary of spices. There are some who simply love it. And what I am cooking here in India is quite similar in nature to the stuff I cook for my clientele back home. I am sure, once people taste the food, they will understand for themselves, that Brits too love spices! So whats on offer for dinner at the West View?

 Starters on the vegetarian menu include Parmesan-Fried Courgettes with Tomato Relish, Baby Spinach and Avocado Salad with Roquefort and Pine Nuts, Chilled Melon and Mint Soup, while the main course has Pesto-baked Aubergine and Mozzarella with Black Olives, Capers and Basil and Wild Mushroom Risotto to name some. 

 Non-vegetarian items include Dressed Crab with Celeriac Remoulade, Crispy Duck and Watercress Salad for starters and Salmon Fishcake with Sauteed Spinach and Sorrel Sauce (a personal favourite with many of his celebrity diners), Tex-Mex Chicken Salad with Guacemole and Roasted Pimentos, Roasted Lamb with new season Beans, and Grilled Lobster and Chips with Spiced Mayonnaise...

 A move to the dessert section finds Chocolate Pudding Souffle with Cr?me Fraiche, Sticky Toffee Pudding with Vanilla Ice-Cream, Sherry and Fruit Trifle and Lemon Meringue Pie.

 Bird, who became a chef simply by watching his mother cook in his growing-up years and now stirs it up for the rich and the famous, fondly recalls the time spent working with Webber. 

 Very often, he would, after his rehearsals, get his entire team home and order me to cook up something in minutes... Those were fun days.

 Admitting that he has grown up with Ivy, Bird is reluctant to drop star names. All he says is that he has served some of the worlds leading personalities, including the Royal family of Britain, and that has been an experience in itself.

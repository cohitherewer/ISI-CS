 What: Fosters Australian Beer and Barbecue Lunch hosted by Arjun and Nilanjana Chakraborty.

 Where: Princeton Club on Prince Anwar Shah Road.

 When: Over lunch, started at 12 noon and continued till late afternoon.

 Hostspeak: With the weather being neither too hot nor too cold, its the ideal time to throw a party, to catch up with friends and have a good adda session, said Nilanjana.

 Also spotted: Harsh and Madhu Neotia, Sougata and Dolly Roy, commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee with wife Sutapa, artist Shuvaprasanna and wife Sipra, Rita Bhimani, June, M.K. Jalan, Sanjay and Minu Budhia, Bikram and Jaya Ghosh, Ranjit Mullick, Shamlu Dudeja with daughter Mallika, Sundeep Bhutoria...

 Sip and bite: The lunch spread comprised Russian Salad, Caesar Salad, Cottage-cheese Sashlik, Roasted Lamb, Grilled Sausages, Apple Pie with ice-cream and Chocolate Mousse, with lots of mocktails and beer to wash down the grub.

 Suketu sound

 Where: Underground, the discotheque at Hotel Hindusthan International.

 What: DJ Suketu night.

 When: Saturday, post midnight.

 DJspeak: I have been coming to Calcutta quite frequently now just because I like to play in this city. The crowd is cool and the party continues till the early hours of the morning. So there is more value for money, said Suketu.

 Play list: The table turner took control of the console at midnight and turned the tables for a couple of hours. His play list comprised tracks like Dus bahane, Dafliwaale, Kajra re and, of course, his own remixes Bin tere sanam, Woh lamhey, Kya khoob lagti ho and Meri nazar hai tujhpe. 

 Crowd: The newly-opened discotheque was throbbing with youngsters making a beeline for an entry to the party place.

 Arabian night

 What: A performance by belly dancer Leena.

 Where: Big Ben, the British-style pub at The Kenilworth.

 When: Saturday night.

 Pubspeak: There will be one such event every week. With the party pie increasing with every passing week, we are positioning Big Ben as one of the hottest haunts in the city, said a spokesperson for the hotel.

 Crowd reaction: No sooner did the dancer take centre stage, shaking her body to some Arabian tunes, the mobile cameras zoomed into action. Many even joined the dancer on the floor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Yen offer for rose, potato

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has been assured Japanese help to build a floriculture and food-processing unit.

 A high-profile team from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s secretariat will meet representatives of the Centre?s agricultural product export development agency, the state agri-horticulture development corporation and the department of food processing and horticulture at Mayukh Bhavan to review the positive response for technological and marketing collaboration offered by Tokyo?s OTA Floriculture.

 The Indian embassy in Tokyo has informed the state government that general manager (sales) of OTA Floriculture Toshio Hirano is keen on a technological and commercial tie-up with a buy-back guarantee.

 Hirano also expressed special interest in helping to set up a flower auction centre in Calcutta and in the export of roses, pineapples and potatoes from Bengal.

 Presently, Japan imports potatoes from China and pineapples from the Philippines. 

 The proposal follows chairman of Mullickghat flower market management committee Sudhansu Sil?s visit to Japan six weeks ago.

 After the Netherlands and Singapore, Japan is the largest auctioning centre of flowers in the world, while Bengal is the third-largest flower producer in India.

 Chatterbox cops amp; traffic snarls

Ajay Pal: Several police officers are deployed at the busy Dunlop crossing, but they often gather at one place to chat over tea. This causes severe traffic snarls, and much suffering to the common people.

 Ideally, the police officers should take up positions away from each another so that they can check reckless driving and overtaking of vehicles. But it is human nature for people who know each other to gather together and gossip, and our homeguards and traffic constables are no exception. At the beginning of their shifts, they can be found in their respective positions, but as time passes, they congregate at one place. When such a thing takes place near a busy crossing, chances of traffic snarls increase manifold. I have already asked senior officers to look into the problem while they make their rounds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A bond beyond diplomacy

 Eye on Calcutta 

 Renu Roy

 They belonged. Thats why on 

 the eve of their farewell, Calcutta cannot get over the two 

 just as they cannot get over it

 George and Lee-Alison Sibley

Despite all that our critics continue to say, there 

must be something about Calcutta and its people. A reminder about what Calcutta 

is all about seems to have arrived again, now that it is time to say goodbye to 

George and Lee-Alison Sibley. The US consul-general and his wife are not just 

another diplomatic couple whose sojourn in the city was to pass like a ship through 

the night. 

Time and again we are reassured 

 about the quality of welcome that our city offers to the 

 unacquainted visitor, and the warmth with which it includes 

 those who come to make their homes in this city. We are 

 probably the only city in the world that trebled its population 

 over two weeks (in August 1947); probably the only city 

 that has been publicly condemned to doom by its country?s 

 highest leadership (remember Rajiv Gandhi?); and certainly 

 the only city from whose infamous gutters have emerged a 

 canonised saint. 

 The magic about the Sibleys is 

 the way they are, and the way we as a city are, and both 

 seemed to have matched perfectly. Before he became a career 

 diplomat George, educated in public policy and the most 

 unlikely disciplines of biology and religious philosophy, 

 had chosen to join the Merchant Marines. What he experienced 

 as a professional sailor certainly prepared him to travel 

 to all unexpected corners of the world, including Calcutta. 

 Lee-Alison has been professionally 

 trained as a singer and actress. But that is not all what 

 they are. They plunged headlong into the pot pourri and 

 huge jumble of life in Calcutta because they were people 

 who were drawn to people. Their concern for the world around 

 them brought them closer to people and circumstances that 

 diplomats are not usually concerned with. 

 Lee-Alison?s door to Calcutta?s 

 heart and soul must have been music. The quality of her 

 involvement with the Calcutta Foundation and the Calcutta 

 Foundation Orchestra has nothing to do with the noble-minded 

 fundraising with which many of the fortunate and affluent 

 assuage their consciences. 

 The Calcutta Foundation Orchestra 

 includes talented young men who have been trained in Western 

 music during their early years at the Oxford Mission orphanage, 

 and since then struggle to maintain both their skills and 

 themselves. She sang with them; she participated directly 

 in the effort to promote them and to improve the quality 

 of their performance; she fell headlong into the task of 

 finding a conductor for them. More than anything else, she 

 belonged. 

 It is the quality of belonging 

 with which Lee-Alison invests her involvement in the many 

 things into which she plunges with remarkable energy, verve 

 and conviction. It is no small wonder that she could become 

 the only Jewish drama teacher in an Arab school in Jordan, 

 where most students belonged to the Islamic faith, which 

 does not condone ?frivolities? like theatre. 

 Lee-Alison belongs to Calcutta 

 in many more ways than one. For instance, through her work 

 for Udayan, a home for children from the leprosy colonies, 

 or Samaritan Help Mission, which works with disadvantaged 

 children in Howrah. She contributed much more than material 

 things or even funds; she touched their lives with her music 

 in a manner that no one had ever cared to do before. She 

 has actively worked for the uplift of children of Calcutta?s 

 rag-pickers with SHED in Tiljala; for the respectful integration 

 of physically challenged children with others at the Rose 

 Bank Educare Centre; for the support of children from the 

 red-light district in Sonagachhi. Relentlessly she has fought 

 against polio, against HIV/AIDS and against discrimination 

 towards women. 

 A part of her passion for life 

 also spreads to the Sibley?s two grown-up sons Benjamin 

 and Gabriel who have also been involved in social activism 

 in their own way, so maybe Calcutta will see more of them 

 in the future. 

 Even after all this, she has found 

 the time and energy to constantly return to her love for 

 music and the theatre. She has sung and danced with the 

 bauls of Birbhum, she has trained in Rabindrasangeet 

 under Pramita Mallick, and her rendering of We Shall 

 Overcome in Bengali had touched our chief minister and 

 our ex-Governor Viren J. Shah. Her CD album entitled The 

 Distant Near, with Pramita, will remain an example of 

 the level of her commitment to whatever she does. Bangla, 

 in fact, is the 11th language she has learnt to speak, among 

 French, Indonesian, Nepali, German, Portuguese, Italian 

 and Spanish. 

 The theatre was in fact where 

 George and Lee-Alison met, but her involvement with the 

 mimetic art goes far beyond either the amateur or the personal. 

 She has conducted theatre workshops for future English language 

 teachers at the Jadavpur and Calcutta universities. Theatre 

 has also provided the platform for her expression of women?s 

 issues, and inspired her to direct a play called Women 

 On The Edge.

 George Sibley?s charm lies in 

 his quiet magnetism and his sense of humour. Calcutta?s 

 multi-ethnicity fascinates him, its diversity he recognises 

 as its strength. What is most interesting is the ease with 

 which he has taken up his job as the US Consul in our Marxist 

 state ? an assignment that he found most challenging. This 

 is much more than diplomatic sang froid, because 

 George has his own keen understanding about how Bengal thinks 

 today, and thinks of its tomorrow. Rallies and processions 

 against US government policies have never ruffled his feathers, 

 because he sees them as part of a larger theoretical context. 

 In the practical world, he looks 

 at the ever-growing platform of co-operation, and the welcome 

 situation for American investments here. He can feel our 

 city changing and predicts that it will not be long when 

 the world will have to sit up to take notice of another 

 emerging Calcutta, beyond the proverbial squalor and poverty 

 with which the West has always identified it for so long. 

 The winds of change are blowing, and we do not know where 

 it will take Mother Teresa?s Calcutta. 

 George and Lee-Alison will go 

 onto Madagascar and we will always have a lump in our throat 

 when we think of them. They too admit that they will miss 

 the city and its people. ?When I leave Calcutta, I will 

 also leave behind my heart. Not only because my mother died 

 here and was cremated here. I?ll also be reminded of the 

 smiles of the children of Tiljala. That is something I will 

 always carry with ?? says Lee-Alison with a tear in her 

 eye.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cargo zone set to take off

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta airport is taxiing for an ambitious take-off.

 The integrated international cargo building and the state-of-the-art perishable-cargo complex at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport is set to be commissioned in 2006. 

 The twin units ? being set up at an estimated cost of Rs 60 crore ? will be a key factor in the airport?s projected turnaround and will also boost the floriculture trade, a thrust area of the state government.

 The first of the four-phase project will be commissioned in June next year. 

 Work on the next phase will start after 15 years, when the first gets saturated.

 Sources said the new terminal was a necessity, given that the annual cargo traffic handled by the airport is over 27,000 tonnes, the estimated rate of increase in the traffic is five per cent and the growth rate being targeted is eight per cent. 

 The new hi-tech cargo complex, covering 20,000 sq m, will have the capacity to handle 40,000 metric tonnes of cargo.

 The air-conditioned complex for perishable cargo, financed by the commerce and industry ministry?s Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, is coming up on a 600-sq m plot.

 ?The existing cargo terminal, built in 1975, has become dated and there is a need for additional infrastructure,? said Lok Ranjan Joshi, deputy general manager (cargo) of the airport. 

 Initially, Rs 50 crore had been sanctioned for the integrated cargo complex. Later, the ministry allotted another Rs 4 crore for the perishable cargo unit. 

 Earlier, there was no shed at the airport where temperatures could be controlled. ?The new air-conditioned complex is being set up to maintain a cold-chain from the exporter?s warehouse to the final carriageway,? explained Joshi.

 ?This is to ensure that goods, especially flowers, command a premium price at international markets,? he added.

 Airport sources said the floriculture lobby had long been vocal about the fact that flowers from the state do not fetch premium prices internationally. ?Prices will never be lucrative unless we ensure that the flowers are fresh at auction markets,? a source said.

 Presently, the cold-chain is broken as the existing warehouse is not air-conditioned and the flowers go stale during the interim period of off-loading and re-loading.

 ?The air-conditioned warehouse will ensure that flowers reaching auction markets remain fresh,? Joshi said.

 The integrated cargo complex will have parking space, restaurants, banks and lounges. 

 The authorities have also added several facilities to the existing terminal. These include assistance booths, modern X-ray machines and an additional loading base. 

 The lighting has been improved to ensure that off-loading and re-loading of cargo can be done round-the-clock.

 Customs examination centres for unmanned baggage have been set up for easing congestion at the warehouse. Besides, a strongroom for valuable cargo and sheds for hazardous cargo have been set up.

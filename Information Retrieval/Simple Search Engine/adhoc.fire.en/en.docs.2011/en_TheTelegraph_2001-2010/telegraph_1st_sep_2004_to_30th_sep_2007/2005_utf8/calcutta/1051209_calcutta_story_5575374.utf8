 The pioneering spirit behind the Cholamandal art village (which has a profound influence on contemporary artists and the modern Indian art scenario), K.C.S. Paniker was an artist who exemplified a philosophy of life based on his own perception of the visual world. Initially interested in painting landscapes in watercolour, he eventually became entirely devoted to doing compositions with figures, that, in terms of form, bore resemblance with south Indian sculptures, specially Chola bronzes. Later, his figurative works were replaced with Neo-tantric compositions replete with geometric diagrams and scribbling, which were not meant to be deciphered. The ongoing exhibition of his drawings mainly consists of studies from life-portraits and full figures done between 1950 and 1955, some during the time when he taught at an art school, after completing his own training in art. His excellent academic studies of men and women, the latter mostly in the nude, are remarkable in their masterly treatment, with sensitive lines and tones bringing out the essential character and perfect anatomy of the model.

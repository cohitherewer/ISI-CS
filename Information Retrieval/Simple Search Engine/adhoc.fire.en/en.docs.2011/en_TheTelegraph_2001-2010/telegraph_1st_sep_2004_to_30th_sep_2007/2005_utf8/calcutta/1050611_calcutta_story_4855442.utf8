 Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall in Sex and the City: Moving on, in a big way

 Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte are back with more sexcapades as Sex and the City returns to HBO for season four on June 12. And there?s lots to look forward to. The newly ?made over? Aidan (Carrie?s too-good-to-be-true boyfriend) returns, Charlotte learns to stand up for herself and tries to start anew with husband Trey, Samantha continues in her ?wicked? ways and finally, Miranda tries to be happy for Steve as he sets up his own bar.

 ?Season Four would be the moving on, in a big step,? says executive producer Michael Patrick King. ?You?re sharing your life with that person. It can be scary and awkward but it?s also deeper and emotional and comforting.?

 Catch the series featuring Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon June 12 onwards every Sunday after the prime-time movie.

 Pocahontas: Warrior woman

 After Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, it?s time for another animation classic to premiere on Disney Channel. The Oscar-winning Pocahontas debuts in Hindi on June 11, with a special impressive Hindi score by Sanjay Chawdhury.

 It?s the tale of a brave and compassionate young woman called Pocahontas. Led by a greedy governor, handsome British Captain John Smith and his team reach the New World in search of gold. The explorers start cutting down trees, digging holes, and prepare to kill the Indians. 

 Pocahontas, embodying the wit and spirit of nature, falls in love with Captain Smith. This incites hatred between her tribe and his shipmates. Her father, Chief, is certain that the white men landing means war. And the only hope to avert a battle arises out of the romance between Smith and Pocahontas. Find out what happens next on June 11 at 6 pm. Special treats: Meeko the raccoon, Flit the hummingbird and the talking Grandmother Willow tree.

 Continuing with cartoons, STAR One will beam Jetix, an action animation block, starting July 2. The programmes in Hindi will be aired on Saturdays and Sundays between 7 pm and 8 pm. On offer would be series like Spider-Man, Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! and Alpha Teens on Machines.

 Russell Crowe: Duty first

 It?s a film guaranteed to set the pulses racing with its adrenaline-pumping action. Add to it a cast of handsome hunks like Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany and mix it with multiple-Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir, and it?s an irresistible combination. Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World makes its debut on STAR Movies this Sunday at 9 pm.

 Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the film is based on the Aubrey/Maturin series of novels by author Patrick O?Brian. Crowe plays Captain ?Lucky? Jack Aubrey, a famous captain in the British Navy. Paul Bettany is the ship?s doctor Stephen Maturin. Their vessel, the HMS Surprise, is attacked by the enemy. With the Surprise badly damaged and much of his crew injured, Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he pursues a high-stake chase across two oceans to capture his enemy. 

 The movie travels the world, from the coast of Brazil to the storm-tossed waters of Cape Horn, south through ice and snow, to the shores of The Galapagos Islands. 

 Almost 90 per cent of the movie is on water, with the director shooting actual footage of a typhoon to use in the film. Some filming was done in the same tank built for the shooting of Titanic, in Rosarito, Mexico. In fact, the only person who wasn?t seasick during filming was Bettany, who was a member of the Sea Cadets as a child.

 Despite all the heroics, Crowe claims the hardest thing he had to do is learn to play the violin for the film. Catch him in action on June 12.

 Shatabdi Roy and Tota Roy Chowdhury: Soap session

 Following in the footsteps of Karishma Kapoor, Raveena Tandon and Sridevi ? all three switched to TV serials from films ? is actress Shatabdi Roy. The former queen of Tollywood is foraying into the small screen with a megaserial alongside Tota Roy Chowdhury. 

 Agnikonya, the first small screen attempt by film producer Damani Pictures, also features Santu Mukherjee and Labony Sircar, and will be directed by Milan Roy Chowdhury.

 ?I have done feature films with Damani Pictures and for the past five years, they have been asking me to do a TV serial. I liked the subject because it has a strong female character who faces lots of problems but tries to fight those and move on. There are lots of shades in my character,? says Shatabdi, who plays an architect. ?Tota works in my father?s office and that?s how I meet him,? she adds.

 ?The serial?s got the look and feel of a feature film and that?s why I agreed to do it,? says Tota.

 Shooting starts in July and the serial goes on air around the Pujas. 

 ?For a TV serial, Agnikonya is very costly. For the pilot episode, we shot the outdoors at Princeton Club and the overall expenses have shot up to Rs 5.5 lakh,? says producer Bablu Damani.

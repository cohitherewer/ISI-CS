 If tourists have been steering clear of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands because of the destruction wreaked by the tsunami, the peaceful Barren Island volcano may help bring them back.

 You can now take a night cruise to within 200 m of the only active volcano in the country, with the administration of the archipelago planning special holiday packages to woo back visitors, specially from Calcutta.

 Every Friday, the MV Long Island will start off from Port Blair at 9 pm and reach Barren Island by 3 am, 140 km north-east of the capital, for as little as Rs 750 to Rs 1,000 per person.

 With southeast Asian nations starting a marketing blitz to hold on to precious tourist revenue soon after the December 26 disaster, the Union Territory has been trying for some time to regain lost ground.

 The volcano could prove to be the perfect peg. ?Since the lava flow and eruption is not a threat to anybody, we have decided to take tourists to catch a glimpse of the wonderful sight,? said D.S. Negi, chief secretary, Andaman and Nicobar administration.

 ?The tsunami is behind us and we are getting visitors for Barren Island every week. This is a huge attraction for tourists not only from foreign countries, but also from places like Calcutta,? added Negi.

 An aviation safety team from the Calcutta airport has already paid a visit to the Port Blair aerodrome to inspect the runaway and other facilities.

 ?The infrastructure is in perfect shape. The entire runway length is being used and Airbuses can fly back to the island without any problem now,? said R.S. Lahauria, deputy general manager (aviation safety), after leading a team back from Port Blair.

 Travel agents in Calcutta have already started to work out packages. ?With Indian Airlines already announcing apex fares for Port Blair, we believe Calcuttans will once again go back to the Emerald Islands,? said Sanjoy Sett, chairman (east), Travel Agents Association of India.

 ?Andaman and Nicobar has always been a hotspot for us, and we are engaging in an awareness drive to let people know that affected areas, like Car Nicobar and the Nancowrie group, are quite far from Port Blair. They have nothing to do with holiday destinations like Havelock or Corbyn?s Cove in Port Blair,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 The island administration has also been in touch with the Union civil aviation ministry for more flights to Port Blair. ?The talks have developed significantly and some private airlines, like Sahara, have expressed interest. We have also asked if some southeast Asia-bound flights could have stopovers in Port Blair,? added Negi.

 The quake and the tsunami rendered the runway unsafe to land the large A-320 aircraft, so Indian Airlines had to reschedule the sector with smaller planes.

 But with the infrastructure back in order, normal services could resume. Indian Airlines has said that if traffic increases, it could consider re-introducing the larger aircraft.

 From the flamboyant Feluda to the loyal Samar Pratap Singh to the never-say-die Frank Serpico ? the biggest names in law enforcement from the big screen. From Thana Theke Aschi to Sehar to LA Confidential ? an eclectic law-and-order movie mix.

 And finally, only four films are the chosen ones. The clincher: the realistic depiction of the cop story in this crime-bust quartet.

 To mark its 150th anniversary, Calcutta Police is organising a special screening of cop-and-robber films for the force this Saturday and Sunday, at Nandan I.

 Apart from the four movies ? Joy Baba Felunath, Sehar, Drohkaal and Bombaiyer Bombete ? this two-day mini film festival will also beam a special new documentary shot recently on Calcutta Police.

 ?It?s a 10-minute documentary which will start the two-day event on Saturday evening,? Zulfikar Hassan, joint commissioner (armed police), told Metro. ?Then, we will show one film on Saturday evening and the other three on Sunday.?

 More than 30 DVD titles, even a couple of VCDs and 35 mm versions, were first rented from Raja Electronics, in Beckbagan, for the preliminary pick-and-choose.

 Serpico, Recruit, K9, LA Confidential, Enemy of the State, Day of the Jackal, and Thana Theke Aschhi were amongst the titles shortlisted for the elimination round.

 ?The policemen came with their own list and we only helped them with some additional suggestions,? revealed a source at Raja Electronics.

 But at the end of the day, two Bengali and two Hindi films were picked for the viewing pleasure of the cops.

 After the formal inauguration on Saturday, Satyajit Ray?s Joy Baba Felunath will be screened. Actor Soumitra Chatterjee?s presence at the inauguration may have something to do with the final vote for Feluda.

 Govind Nihalani?s hard-hitting Drohkaal, starring Amrish Puri, Om Puri and Ashish Vidyarthi, will kick-start proceedings on Sunday, followed by another Feluda film ? Sandip Ray?s Bombaiyer Bombete with Sabyasachi Chakraborty as the sharp sleuth.

 And the recent Arshad Warsi-starrer Sehar, based on the life of Arun Kumar, DIG, anti-corruption bureau, will round off screenings.

 The reason why more gritty police films were picked ahead of the more flashy ones is the reality-rules factor.

 ?The four films have shown the police force in the right light, rather than some film showing Amitabh Bachchan bashing up everyone as a cop,? said a source in Calcutta Police.

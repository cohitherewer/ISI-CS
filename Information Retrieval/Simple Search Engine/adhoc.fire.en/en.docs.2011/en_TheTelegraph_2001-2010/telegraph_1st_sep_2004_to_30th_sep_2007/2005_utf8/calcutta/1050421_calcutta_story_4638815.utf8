 Planning summer holidays? If you are bored of backpacks and have a more classy luggage option in mind, Dolphin Leather has some new stuff one could dig. 

 The store at Metro Plaza opened shop with a new range after its renovation recently. Arrivals include handbags, shoulder bags, executive portfolios, wallets, waist belts and leather jackets. 

 The last is eminently avoidable unless you are planning to climb a mountain, but the rest in black, tan, green, white, burgundy, beige and navy blue can add a trendy touch to your holiday plans.

 Prices oscillate wildly. Small bags are priced between Rs 300 and Rs 1,200, travel bags are available for Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,500, while belts start at Rs 150 and go on to touch Rs 350. 

 Sparkle stop

 Theirs is one of the few jewellery stores in the city dedicated to pure silver fashion jewellery. And the repertoire just got trendier with a new spring-summer collection. 

 Heritage, housed a couple of stores away from the legendary Chamba Lama in New Market, has brought a riot of colours this time with precious and semi-precious stone-studded jewellery. The alluring purple of an amethyst, the passionate red of a ruby, or the tranquil green of a peridot ? the summer palette is more vibrant than ever. 

 ?Green is in this season across the world, and is the right colour to buy now,? suggested store owner Mahesh Punjabi. 

 Designs range from heavy to light pieces, but the use of stones remains the centre point of each piece. 

 The price range is as varied from Rs 100 to Rs 10,000, ensuring everyone from a college student to the serious shopper finds something to suit taste and pocket. 

 Started almost a decade ago, the store has built a loyal clientele over the years owing to its strong points of craftsmanship and unique designs. 

 While the USP of the current collection remains the use of sterling silver, it?s the ability to keep in touch with changing trends and the taste of the customers that?s been a winning point here.

 ?Our in-house designers create designs that are different from most other silver jewels you get to see in town,? claimed Punjabi. 

 Fusion food

 If celebrating fusion is in, why should food be left behind? The idea prompted restaurateur Sandeep Sehgal to experiment with Chinese and Indian tastes to prepare what he calls a winning mix at Flavours of India. 

 The effort has yielded a number of interesting concoctions both in the vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections with posto (poppy seeds) finding its way into hot garlic sauce and mutton seekh being tossed in barbecue sauce. 

 Having started off with just two dishes to see how it went down with guests, Sehgal and his team soon went on to create a full menu.

 The restaurant on AJC Bose Road is now hosting a festival of this fusion menu for both lunch and dinner, till April end.

 Special recommendation: Ocean Surprise (prawn stuffed pomfret tossed in a Chinese sauce).

 Season gear

 Summer wear got a new stop in town with You Ensembles, a boutique that opened on 30C Lake Road recently. Day and evening wear for the season by upcoming designers from Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur and Calcutta at bargain prices is the USP here. 

 Salwar suits, kurtis, saris, unstitched salwar suit lengths, scarves, footwear, bags, purses, bangles and other accessories offer a complete summer wardrobe solution.

 Lights shades and cottons help battle the daytime heat and light matka silks and bright colours allow one to enliven the sultry evenings. 

 ?I picked up two kota saris from the store,? said jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty, wife of actor Arjun, roped in to add glamour to the launch.

 ?The best thing about their stuff is competitive pricing. The same pair of designer sandals, for example, will cost three times elsewhere,? added Nilanjana.

 Kalamkari, prints, embroidery, aari and kashab work on the ensembles ensure that one can pull them off in many moods and on various occasions with just a few innovations in accessories.

 Worth special mention are chiffon ponchos, bags and footwear embellished with brocade, buttons, kashab, beads and even zardosi. 

 ?We source a lot of bags in pure and heavy silks, that help lend a touch of chic glamour to any outfit,? said Priti Nathani, owner of the store. 

 Cotton saris at Rs 550 to Rs 650 share rack space with bridal saris at Rs 12,000. Salwar suits are available between Rs 1,200 and Rs 6,000. Footwear is priced between Rs 675 and Rs 2,400, bags between Rs 500 and Rs 1,200, and so on.

 Hand held

 Rotary Club of Chowringhee has brought the diverse forms of arts and crafts together yet again, for Parampara 2005 at Ice Skating Rink.

 Like every year, a pool of talent has been brought in from New Delhi, Indore, Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune to put together an amalgamation of affordable and imaginative art and craft. 

 The exhibition features ceramic products blended with cane, various types of paintings, furniture accessories, hand-crafted wooden products and steel accessories. 

 Some of the notable names are Madhulika Jain from New Delhi displaying her steel accessories, Roasalind Pereira of Mumbai exhibiting tribal silver jewellery, and Rajasthani fabrics and handicrafts by Anubhati Prakash. The fair is on till April 21.

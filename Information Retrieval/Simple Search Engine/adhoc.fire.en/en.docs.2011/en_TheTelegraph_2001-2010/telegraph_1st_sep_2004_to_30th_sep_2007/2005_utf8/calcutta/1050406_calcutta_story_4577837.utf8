 Screaming for help, pulling the alarm chain and then jumping out ? for the passengers of the Howrah-bound Udayan Abha Toofan Express, which caught fire on Monday near Dildar Nagar station, it was a brush with death.

 Twenty-four hours later, passengers of the ill-fated coaches reached Howrah, still struggling to get over the trauma.

 ?We jumped off the train and started running through a field,? said Shanti Das. She, along with neighbours Shanta Sarkar and Shukla Sarkar, all from Haridevpur, boarded the train in Mathura.

 They were in the S-2 coach, in which the fire had reportedly started. Seventy four-year-old Shanta got injured after jumping off the train.

 The trio has lost all baggage and belongings. ?All our luggage was destroyed in the fire. Even our ticket, which was in a bag, was burnt,? said Shukla. They were issued a duplicate ticket. 

 Five bogies of the train ? four sleeper-class coaches (S2 to S5) and one air-conditioned coach ? were gutted, but there was no casualty. The passengers in the blazing coaches were evacuated immediately after the driver brought the train to a halt between Darauli and Dildar Nagar stations, on being alerted by the driver of a passing train.

 The train reached Howrah at 7.35 am on Tuesday, more than 12 hours behind schedule. The corresponding Up train had to be cancelled, officials said.

 According to some passengers, the fire started near the toilet of the S-2 coach. ?Sparks were seen near a toilet of the S-2 coach,? said Rajendra Singh. He had boarded the train in Agra. ?Had it been night, the fire would have caused a major disaster,? he said. Singh, like others, jumped from the train to escape death. 

 Lalita Mondal, of Kudghat, had gone to Brindavan with her teenaged son. They were in the S-5 coach, where the fire had spread after they jumped off. ?There was a near-stampede, as all the passengers tried to get off at a time,? Mondal recalled. 

 Railway officials denied passengers? complaints that food was not served on the train after the mishap. ?Food was served both at Dildar Nagar and Patna stations,? an official clarified.

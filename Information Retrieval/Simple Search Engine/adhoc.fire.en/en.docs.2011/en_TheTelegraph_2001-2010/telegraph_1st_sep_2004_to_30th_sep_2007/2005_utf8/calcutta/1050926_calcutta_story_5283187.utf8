 The city administration on Sunday evicted about 1,000 people from the north-eastern stretch of Bondel Road and finished the process of clearing the area of encroachers. This paves the way for completing the Bondel Gate flyover project, already running more than three years behind schedule.

 Covered by a huge police force, bulldozers razed to the ground about 103 brick houses and 50 shops from 7.30 am to 11.30 am. The demolished constructions were mostly on the Bondel Road and Rifle Range Road crossing, under Karaya police station jurisdiction, only some 200 m away from the residence of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 ?Where will I go with my family?? cried Laxmi Devi, 80, sitting on the rubble her room was reduced to. She could not remember when she started living there. ?I was very young. We have lived here for at least three generations,? she said.

 Local MLA and Left Front chief whip in the Assembly Rabin Deb said the squatters were given an ?unprecedented? rehabilitation offer, which ?some of them? refused.

 ?Under a central government scheme, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority has built a housing complex comprising 1,065 flats at Nonadanga. The chief minister inaugurated the complex on September 16. We decided to give 103 flats to the families of squatters evicted today. Though some of them accepted our offer, some rejected it. So, we had no option but to use force today,? Deb said.

 ?They are asking for Rs 44,000 for each single-room flat. We are poor. From where should we get all that money?? said Kanai Lal Shaw, who was thrown out of his home.

 ?We told them that those who cannot afford that will get assistance from us. We offered them an instalment scheme, a subsidy scheme and a loan scheme. But they have rejected the offers,? Deb said.

 The evicted people accused the local CPM of driving them out of their homes. ?A local CPM leader, Dhiren Shaw, pretended to be with us but never raised a finger to stop today?s eviction,? said Shaw. However, Subesh Nag, a CPM local committee member, said Dhiren himself, along with his son, was arrested for resisting eviction on Sunday.

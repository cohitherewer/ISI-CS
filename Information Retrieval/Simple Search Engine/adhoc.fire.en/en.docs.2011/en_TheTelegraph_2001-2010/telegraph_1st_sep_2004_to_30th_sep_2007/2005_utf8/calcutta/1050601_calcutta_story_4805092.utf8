 Arrests ring alert on foreign job firms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If you have plans of working abroad, think twice before making a big investment, or else it may go down the drain. 

 To stop recruiting agencies from duping candidates, police are appealing to job-seekers from the city to be extra-cautious and demand valid documents before coughing up a huge sum for registration. 

 The caution follows the recent arrest of two such ?operators? ? Ashok Kumar Roy and his son Avijit ? at Baruipur, on the outskirts of the city, and the subsequent arrest of Amir Ali in Worli, Mumbai, last week. Ali was an operator who worked for an agency, International Trade Concepts. While the company had the necessary licence from the Union labour ministry, police say it was being misused. 

 A team of officers from the Enforcement Branch (EB) has been sent to Mumbai to probe the links. Besides, an appeal has been made to Maharashtra Police, seeking their cooperation in investigating some fake operators in the city.

 Police have warned all job-seekers, including specialist doctors, engineers and IT professionals who turn up in numbers for jobs abroad, not to get carried away either by the swank offices of operators, who claim to be recruiting agents, or by their Mumbai links. They should look for valid papers instead. 

 ?Even those who believe they are well-aware of the norms are being taken for a ride. A doctor, for instance, was gypped of Rs 90,000. He was promised a job in a hospital in UK. One must ask for the registration number and other documents and if an agency is not willing to produce details, one should think twice,? said Nazrul Islam, inspector-general of police (EB).

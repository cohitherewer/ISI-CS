 Maidan baby?s adoption okayed 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 After months in courts, Moon Moon Joardar has finally been awarded custody of the baby girl that was abandoned on the Maidan in February.

 Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the police to hand over the baby to Joardar, a nurse at the state-run SSKM Hospital, within a fortnight.

 ?After going through the report submitted by city police chief Prasun Mukherjee, I am of the opinion that the poor child will get proper care in the custody of the petitioner,? observed Justice Saumitra Sen.

 Joardar has been fighting to adopt the girl who she cared for after she was rescued. Friday?s order mentioned that a factor that worked in her favour was that the 41-year-old nurse and her 52-year-old husband, Bibhash Joardar, have no children of their own.

 The petitioner?s husband is a sub-inspector of the special branch of Calcutta Police and both are financially capable of raising a child, said the police commissioner in his report to the court.

 He also stated that the heath of the child, who has been staying at the Sukanya rescue home, is quite good.

 On February 28, the Maidan police had rescued the abandoned newborn and admitted her at SSKM for treatment. 

 There, Joardar was asked to look after her. She soon moved a petition before the Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrate?s Court, seeking permanent custody. But, the court turned her down.

 A week later, the couple approached the same court with the same prayer. But this time too, it was the same verdict. 

 A desperate Joardar then approached the Child Welfare Committee. But the committee asked her to approach the Juvenile Justice Board.

 When this board, too, declined her custody plea, Joardar decided to challenge the decision in high court.

 In its interim order, the bench had asked the superintendent of SSKM not to shift the child. But the hospital super had already transferred the baby to Sukanya, on the basis of a directive from the Child Welfare Committee.

 When Joardar learnt of the shift, she moved high court again, after which Justice Sen asked the commissioner to file a report about the circumstances under which the child had been moved, and about the couple?s economic status.

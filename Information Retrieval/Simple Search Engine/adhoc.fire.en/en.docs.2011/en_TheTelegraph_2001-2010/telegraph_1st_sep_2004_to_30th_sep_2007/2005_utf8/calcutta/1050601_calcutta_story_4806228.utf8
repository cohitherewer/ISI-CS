 The condition of the building on AJC Bose Road-Lord Sinha Road crossing is as precarious as in the photograph published with ?Blaze toll mounts to nine?, on May 20. The matter has been repeatedly brought to the notice of the landlord and various government departments but to no avail. Electric wires hang loose all around the building increasing risk of accidents. We hope the authorities take see to it that the landlord carries out repairs at the earliest. 

 Occupants of the building,

 AJC Bose Road. 

 A few days back I went to post four envelopes, each containing a single sheet, at the CR Avenue and Bowbazar post offices. The staff at both the offices were unable to tell me the denomination of stamp to be affixed on the envelopes. Even after weighing one of the envelopes, a staff member of CR Avenue post office said the postal charge could be either Rs 5 or Rs 10. Tired of running from one post office to another in this sultry summer heat, I opted for a courier service which delivered all my letters in time. It charged me just Rs 11 for an outstation mail and Rs 5.50 for a local one. The Indian postal department is celebrating 150 years of service now. If it employs such inefficient staff it would lose much of its business to the private courier companies.

 It is disappointing that common people are not allowed to enter Raj Bhavan. Even Rashtrapati Bhavan premises are opened to public for a stipulated time every year. People greatly enjoy the garden there as it is has a fascinating variety of flora and is very well-maintained. It would be nice if the Governor?s House is also opened to the public at least for a few days in a year. A sprawling garden could be developed on its premises. Necessary security measures can be taken on days the premises are open to public.

 Uday Chakraborty,

 Feeder Road. 

 The receptionists at a diagnostic centre in Behala are not allowed to sit throughout their 12-14-hour shifts. They have to keep standing even while working on computers. Thanks to the freakish rule, many employees have already quit the job, citing acute pain in the legs. I think the clinic management needs to do away with the rule.

 Moumita Nandi,

 Address not given. 

 An open garbage dump on Amherst Street has become a big nuisance as it spreads a stench in the entire area. It should be shifted elsewhere.

 Prasit Sen,

 Hatiara.

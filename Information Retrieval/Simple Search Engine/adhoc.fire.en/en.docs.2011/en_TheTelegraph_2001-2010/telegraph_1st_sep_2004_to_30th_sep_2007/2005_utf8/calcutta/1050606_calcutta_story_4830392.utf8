 Trees under villager vigil

Sourish Mishra: Poaching and tree-felling are major problems in forest areas. Though you have forest keepers, there are still complaints that tree-felling is going on.

 It is unfortunate if even a single tree is felled illegally in the forests, but one must also be pragmatic while dealing with the problem. Our guards have to keep vigil on a vast tract of open space, as poachers can enter through any part of the forests. Besides, there is a dearth of guards. Only 2,444 guards watch over 11,879 sq km of forest area in the state. 

 Forest guards alone cannot protect the entire forest area. So, in several areas, we have introduced a joint forest management system along with locals. We have formed 3,500 village committees to maintain the forests and keep away poachers and tree smugglers. To encourage the members of these committees, we spent nearly Rs 6 crore this year to fund welfare activities in villages adjoining forest areas. Several international agencies have already studied our joint management model. Our experience shows that involving local residents in protecting trees is quite effective.

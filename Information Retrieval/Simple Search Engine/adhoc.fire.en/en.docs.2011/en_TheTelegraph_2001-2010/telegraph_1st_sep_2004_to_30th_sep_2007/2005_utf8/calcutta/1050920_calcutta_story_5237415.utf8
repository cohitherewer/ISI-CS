 Free-plot spanner in Bypass project

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pet project, an elevated road connecting Parama island, on the EM Bypass, with Park Circus, has come under a cloud, with the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) refusing to provide land at New Town for free.

 The 4.5-km-long, elevated road was planned to ensure smooth vehicular movement along EM Bypass and its connecting roads.

 Bhattacharjee had taken initiative in the matter and asked CMDA to write to Hidco for land.

 As per the plan, the Rs 300-crore project would be undertaken on a build-operate-transfer basis. 

 The private party would be compensated for its investment with 200 acres of land at New Town at procurement cost and advertising rights on the road.

 Hidco has, however, declined to provide even a single acre at less than the market rate. The organisation is currently selling commercial plots at New Town at Rs 2 crore per acre.

 ?The question of providing land free or at a nominal price does not arise. Plots will be provided to the private party only after full payment at the rate fixed by Hidco,? asserted housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb.

 The minister discussed the matter with senior officials of Hidco before turning down the CMDA plea.

 ?Hidco takes neither subsidy nor financial grant from the government. It functions by mobilising its own resources. So, why should it provide land free to any government department or anybody else?? asked an official.

 This apart, he added, several companies and individuals are ready to buy land at New Town at the market rate.

 ?Why will we provide land for a project which is not related to New Town and that too, by incurring a loss of Rs 400 crore,?? another official said.

 The CMDA was due to invite expressions of interest from entrepreneurs, but the process has become uncertain after Hidco?s refusal.

 Apart from the flyover, the project includes construction of two underpasses, a pedestrian overbridge and a car park.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said he would discuss the matter with Deb to arrive at a solution.

 ?We have to implement the project to cope with the rising vehicular rush on the EM Bypass. We are exploring other avenues to get the project through,?? said Bhattacharya.

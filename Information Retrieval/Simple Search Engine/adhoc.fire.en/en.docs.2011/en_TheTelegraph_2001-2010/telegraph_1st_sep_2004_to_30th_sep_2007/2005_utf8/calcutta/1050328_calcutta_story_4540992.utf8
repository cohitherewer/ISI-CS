 A dash of green amid the concrete ? if you thought it was just about roads and footpaths, think again. It?s now the turn of medical colleges. 

 Keen to provide a relief to the ailing lying on iron beds and trolleys in medical colleges across the city, the urban forestry wing of the forest department has decided to wrap the institutions in green. 

 The project will kick off at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), and going by its success, will be replicated in the other medical colleges. Finance department officials said Rs 3.26 lakh had been sanctioned for CMCH and work will begin within the next few weeks.

 ?Greenery has a soothing effect on patients. We are not suggesting that planting a few saplings will bring about any functional change, but it would surely make the hospital a better place,? said Jayshree Mitra, principal of the college.

 According to the plan, trees will be planted across the campus, including around MCH Building, Green Building, Eden Hospital and the administrative building. The change, however, will be most visible on the ground opposite the anatomy building. 

 ?The entire ground, which is now bare with only traces of grass, will be done up with two rows of trees,? said an urban forestry department official.

 A few weeks ago, a team from the department had visited the hospital and identified spots that would be spruced up. The patches, sources said, will be known as ?green zones?. 

 Calcutta Medical College has been chosen as the launch-pad for the project not just because it is the oldest of all medical institutions. Finance department officials said that among the five medical colleges, the CMCH contributes the most to the state exchequer. For instance, the college contributes Rs 10,000 daily from the proceeds of eco-cardiograph tests, conducted by a private agency on the campus.

 ?We are also looking for private participation in carrying out some repair and installation work in the college and the hospital. Besides, we have held talks for landscaping the campus. All these are efforts to ensure that we try to cut down expenses as much as possible,? said a member of the hospital?s managing committee. 

 Once the greenery project comes off in the CMCH, the forest department will take it up in the other colleges, calculating the estimated expenses and examining the detailed outlays.

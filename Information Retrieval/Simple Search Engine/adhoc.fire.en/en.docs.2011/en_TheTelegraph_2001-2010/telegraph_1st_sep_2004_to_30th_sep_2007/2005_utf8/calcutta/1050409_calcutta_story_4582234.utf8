 It is often said that laughter is the best medicine to keep away stress-related 

ailments. Offering this as an excuse, many people in the city have formed/joined 

laughing clubs. One such club has been formed at Deshabandhu Park in north Calcutta. 

The residents living in the vicinity of the park are shaken out of their slumber 

in the wee hours of the morning by strange sounds of laughter. Many of them had 

approached the morning-walkers and requested them to shift the club elsewhere 

but to no avail. For the sake of the residents in the area, can they not tone 

down the sound of their laughter?

 A few days back, I purchased a book in Bengali on magic for my young nephew. 

To my utter disbelief two of the tricks in the book ? one on how to escape the 

gallows and the other on remaining unhurt after stabbing oneself ? were not fit 

to be tried out by children. I had to tear off the two pages before handing over 

the book to the child. How could the publisher commit the folly of including such 

risky tricks in a children?s book?

 A good number of police vehicles are kept parked bumper to bumper on the left 

hand side of the entire stretch of the RN Mukherjee Road, causing inconvenience 

to office-goers. In fact, the police vehicles prevent a clear view of the oncoming 

vehicles from the direction of Brabourne Road and Lalbazar. In view of the rise 

in the number of road accidents, is it not the duty of our transport department 

to see to it that the police vehicles don?t infringe on the safety of the general 

public?

 My nephew went to the Bikash Bhavan branch of State Bank of India, in Salt 

Lake, on March 28 for making a demand draft in favour of IGNOU. To get the job 

done, he had to wait from 1.20 pm to 4.30 pm. Is this how nationalised banks are 

supposed to function? Foreign investment in public sector enterprises is called 

for to improve such work culture.

 The condition of the roads from Burrabazar to Kumartuli is terrible. Patients 

have a harrowing time on the way to and from to Matrimangal, Marwari Relief Society 

or Lohia hospital. They are worse off after the journey. 

 Sushil Kumar Shroff, Jamunalal Bajaj Street.

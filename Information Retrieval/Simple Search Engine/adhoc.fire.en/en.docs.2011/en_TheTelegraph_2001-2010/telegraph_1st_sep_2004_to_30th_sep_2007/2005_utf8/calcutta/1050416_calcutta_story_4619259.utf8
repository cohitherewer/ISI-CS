 Femininity seems to be in focus at the coming Lakme India Fashion Week (LIFW), as most designers choose to go the ?soft and romantic? way. And that?s precisely the line Calcutta?s oldest design house, Monapali, has decided to tread in the collection to be showcased on April 24.

 Designers Mona Lamba and Pali Sachdev have devoted their entire collection to the ?woman of today? with the title of the line ? She is? ? pronouncing the theme

 ?The look of our LIFW collection is soft and feminine. The clothes are very fluid, with lots of bounce and volume,? says Pali.

 ?We have drawn inspiration from the woman of today, who is made up of many contrasts and is always playing different roles,? she adds.

 The diffusion line comprises lots of multi-layered flowing skirts in chiffon, georgette and satin, with silks combined to give volume. The flouncy skirts are teamed with fitted slim tops, bustiers, stringy blouses and knitted uppers.

 ?This time we have used lots of knits with fabric and metallic thread. We also have a lot of kantha work, checks, florals and diffused prints in our collection,? reveals Mona.

 Trousers of varying lengths ? from capris to long churidars ? have been textured and embellished with floral hand-painting combined with diffused prints. Long capes touching the floor have been paired with skirts as well as trousers.

 Layering plays a very important role in the collection and also finds place in a line of saris created for the occasion. ?The saris have been layered and the ruffles make them look like drapes,? explains Pali. The embellishments are the same throughout the gamut of designs, bolstering the theme.

 The palette is subdued ? starting from cream, beige and white and moving on to soft green, grey, black and brown.

 If Monapali pays tribute to all things feminine, young designer Anamika Khanna?s collection comes as quite a contrast. For, the designer takes a lead from ?all things mannish? and borrows elements of men?s wear for her women?s line to be showcased at LIFW on April 25.

 ?My collection blurs the difference between men?s and women?s clothing. It?s sensuous, yet very relaxed, expressing richness and excesses with nonchalance,? says Anamika. 

 She elucidates: ?The line is very intellectual and metropolitan. It?s very handsome and proud. It?s all about well-being and comfort.?

 The silhouettes are free and fluid, with the pants loosely hanging from the hip, loosely-belted dresses, flowing voluminous skirts and lots of blazers. Here too, layering abounds.

 ?Oversize is a strong theme in the collection, which distorts the otherwise perfect garments,? concludes the designer.

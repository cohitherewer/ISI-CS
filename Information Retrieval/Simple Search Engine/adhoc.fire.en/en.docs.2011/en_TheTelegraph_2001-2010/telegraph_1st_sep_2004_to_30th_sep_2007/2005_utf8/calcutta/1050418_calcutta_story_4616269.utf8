The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campus united in JU expel protest 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After a four-day interlude, Jadavpur University will open on Monday with the teaching community joining hands with the students in condemning the recommendation of the executive council to expel five senior students.

 All five were members of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu). They were showcaused by university registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay last Wednesday.

 Senior members of the Jadavpur University Teachers? Association (Juta) said the body would meet early in the week, ?probably on Monday or Tuesday, to discuss the issue and decide on a stand?.

 ?I had heard about the decision taken by the executive council on Tuesday night,? said C.R. Mandal, general secretary of Juta and a reader in the physics department.

 ?This is an attempt to make the university community unipolar. When the democratic spirit cannot be upheld, ?untoward incidents? are bound to be the consequence,? he asserted.

 ?The incident probed by the inquiry commission is not the first instance of a students? agitation on our campus, so there is no valid reason for taking such a harsh and unprecedented stand. I am more interested in what sparked off the incident, and Juta will meet to discuss the issue,? Mandal added.

 Hinting at a conspiracy, he said: ?I received a letter from a teacher who had overseen the recent student elections on the Salt Lake campus. A copy of the letter was sent to the registrar. The teacher reported an ?untoward incident?, induced by ?outsiders?, who entered the campus and beat up the voters. The question is who should be punished. If the teacher had been convinced that the authorities would take proper action, he would not have written to us for help.?

 Bhaskar Gupta, professor of the electronics department and joint secretary of the executive council of Juta, felt that singling out five from a crowd of 500 agitating students seemed ?unconvincing? and was ?questionable?.

 ?We have had numerous instances of student agitations in the past, and at least some of them were far worse than the events of September 2003. But the idea of expelling a student had never come up before. The very suggestion reeks of some sort of vendetta, an attempt to seek vengeance,? he added.

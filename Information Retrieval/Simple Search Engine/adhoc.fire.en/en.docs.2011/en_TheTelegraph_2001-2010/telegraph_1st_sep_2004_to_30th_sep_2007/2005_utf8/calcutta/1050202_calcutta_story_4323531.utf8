 The Victoria Memorial Hall authorities have taken up several projects to beautify the premises, roads and the pond in its compound. 

 The five-km bitumen road will be concretised at a cost of Rs 44 lakh.

 Explaining the rationale behind the move, Hall curator-secretary Chittaranjan Panda told Metro on Tuesday: ?Repairing a bitumen road means causing pollution. Black smoke emitted by the burning tar not only pollutes the air, but also affects the white marbles of the monument.?

 The new road, he added, will be made of cement and stone chips. It will last longer and repair work will not cause any damage to the environment or the building.

 The Memorial authorities are also planning to take a water connection from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) at a cost of Rs 1 crore.

 ?We are now using ground water, which is laced with arsenic. We need to change the source,? said Panda.

 The authorities have informed the culture department of the Union government about the problem and sought Rs 1 crore for a water connection from the civic body. 

 The department has approved the grant and the Hall will approach the CMC once the finance committee clears the proposal, Panda added.

 The department has also sanctioned Rs 45 lakh for the beautification of the garden. 

 Another grant of Rs 34 lakh has been received for the installation of a modern system of watering trees. Work for installing the sprinkler system will start in February. 

 ?Once the system is installed, it will be very easy to spray water on the trees and shrubs in our garden,? said a Memorial official. 

 The authorities have spent Rs 10 lakh to pave with concrete nearly half the bank of the 15-acre waterbody. ?We require another Rs 10 lakh to complete the project,? the official said.

 The water cannot be kept clean unless the bank is lined with concrete. During monsoon, waste matter flows into the pond. This can be prevented if the edge is lined with concrete.

 The open space around the heritage building has been covered with terracotta tiles at a cost of Rs 10 lakh. 

 Pavements along the roads from the North and South gates, too, have been covered with similar tiles as part of the beautification project.

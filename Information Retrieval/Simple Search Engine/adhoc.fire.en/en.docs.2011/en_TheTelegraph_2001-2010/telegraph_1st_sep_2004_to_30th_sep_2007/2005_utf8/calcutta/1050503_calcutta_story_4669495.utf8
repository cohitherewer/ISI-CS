The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pools strike a splashpoint

 - Come summer, the newest craze is for spas, jacuzzis and swim areas

 Leela Beach resort in Goa and Vijay Mallya?s Kingfisher Villa in Goa. A farmhouse in Barasat and a club in south Calcutta? The latest in pool power is flowing into town as the mercury rises and the cool blue water becomes the centre of attraction.

 Pune-based Veeke Enterprises ? responsible for the high-profile waterbodies in Goa and now working on a swimming pool in Symbiosis Institute, Pune ? has tied up with Water Works to launch a range of spa and pool products to bring Calcutta to Goa grade.

 Hotels and clubs, homes and farmhouses ? they?re all our targets, says Vishwanath Kurup, proprietor, Veeke Enterprises. 

 ?There is a very good market here, but it is unorganised,? adds Gaurav Ghosh, owner of Water Works. ?I recently built a 10-and-a-half-ft jacuzzi for 12 people for a client in a farmhouse in Barasat. It?s one of the largest in India. Now, we?ve got readymade jacuzzi units for Rs 25,000. We?re targeting the mass market.?

 The pool-specific equipment doesn?t come cheap ? from Rs 15,000-20,000 to Rs 1 lakh for a filter, about Rs 1 lakh for the wireless lights? ?We?ve already done a soft launch in Calcutta, and the response has been good,? explains Kurup. 

 A swimming pool or jacuzzi is not really a luxury item any more, stresses Kurup. ?It?s all about hydrotherapy. So, we?re also going to talk to hospitals and Calcutta is a very good potential market.? Also on offer would be a range of portable plastic pools that can be used in summer and then wrapped up and stored.

 Although Calcutta is still a relatively small market, there has been a recent ?spurt? in the number of private pools, says Ashok Chawla of Watco India. Pools are also making their presence felt in residential estates, with Ghosh working on the Green Valley project, near the airport.

 As fun in the water hots up to beat the sun. Kurup is scouting for land near Rajarhat and Garia to set up a waterpark, too.

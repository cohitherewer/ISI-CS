Move over dingy coffee houses, caf? culture has come 

a-calling in Calcutta. Realising that adda is at the heart of it all, Caf? 

Coffee Day moved a step ahead on Tuesday by launching a ?lounge caf??.

 More lounge space and an ?international ambience? distinguish the brand new Lake Road outlet from six other Caf? Coffee Day addresses in the city.

 The 1,650 sq ft cafeteria sure looks more plush and airy at a glance, packing in indoor and outdoor space that can accommodate 90 people in separate smoking and non-smoking sections. A live music platform promises a richer brew while plush leather and ratin divans, sofas and sling chairs look inviting. 

 ?All our cafes will be made in this format,? said director Naresh Malhotra during a brief touchdown in the city for the launch. ?Earlier, our outlets were smaller and we couldn?t pack in the required ambience. The same look is being featured in our outlets across the country, as also those in Austria, Dubai and the next one to be opened shortly in China,? added Malhotra, expanding on his dream of seeing Caf? Coffee Day become a ?neighbourhood caf??.

 The chain is planning to open 500 cafes in all by June 2007, 50 of which would be opened in five international cities by March 2006. Around 50 highway cafes would also be set up across the country by the end of this year.

 As for Calcutta, Caf? Coffee Day aims to have 10 cafes serving light bites and popular beverages.

 obal plans also call for state-of-the-art technology like real-time billing system. To be carried by each attendant, the apparatus will allow the customer to punch in his/her caf? or credit card on the spot, to make for a speedy billing system.

 Caf? cards for regulars will offer them a slew of benefits apart from recording their ?caf? history?, allowing the Caf? Coffee Day staff to track customer preferences and assist them accordingly. ?We are laying special stress on table service here, despite self-service being the mantra the world over,? said Malhotra. 

 The new cafes are Wi-Fi enabled, allowing for the smooth operation of the wireless apparatus, apart from allowing patrons to make optimum use of the caf? by bringing in their laptops and racking their brains over endless rounds of steaming cuppas! ?All our cafes across the world would be Wi-Fi enabled by the end of this year,? promised Malhotra. 

 On Tuesday evening, it was time to sample an extensive vegetarian and non-vegetarian menu that included snacks like Salami Sandwich, Hot Dog, Sausage Puff Roll, Mayonnaise and Lemon Roulade, Sizzling Brownies and Strawberry Cheese Cake with hot and cold brew to go along. 

While the Ekdin Pratidin soap team provided 

glamour, a Krosswindz performance served up soul food.

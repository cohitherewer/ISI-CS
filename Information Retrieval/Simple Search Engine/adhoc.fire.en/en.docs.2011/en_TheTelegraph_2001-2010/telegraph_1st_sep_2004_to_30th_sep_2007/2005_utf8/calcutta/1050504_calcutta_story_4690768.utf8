It?s time to move out of the boring office cubicle and into a cosy lounge. The bulk of IT professionals in Sector V, Salt Lake, have the option of enjoying a mug of beer while working on their laptop in the cool confines of bar-cum-lounge Opium.

 The chic outlet that serves alcohol from as early as 11 am promises to change the work culture in the IT hub of the satellite township for good, or to at least lift its spirits.

 The restaurant, serving Chinese and Indian grub, opened about a year ago, but upped its bar shutters this April and is now attracting over-worked techhies in dire need of a chill-out option close to their workplace.

 ?Since their place of work is so far away from the city centre, it?s not possible for most of them to go out partying after work,? says Moloy Dutta, partner in the Opium venture. Proving him right are the techhies, post-8 pm, when work ends and play begins. Before you can say ?beer?, the lounge and bar stools at the swank outlet are full up. ?We also get some people in the afternoons who come for lunch and beer,? adds Dutta. 

 Being positioned as a place to chill, the ambience is being kept cool and relaxed. Bollywood remixes and commercial numbers take a backseat here as all-time favourite English classics match the mood.

 ?We are getting together a collection of CDs which will be stocked in an open library. Anyone can choose their tracks and play it. It?s like a jukebox,? says Mustafi, another partner.

 Though there is a plan to rope in a DJ, shake-a-leg kind of music will only be played on crowd demand. ?We don?t intend to thrust dance music on our guests,? adds Mustafi.

 While the cool confines of the AC bar, lounge and restaurant is perfect for those bothered by the heat and humidity, an open-air dhaba-style tandoori kitchen is also on for those who like dining the natural way. ?We are planning to open a bar counter with the dhaba so that those who get tired of the controlled temperature in office can spend some time breathing in natural air,? the owners add.

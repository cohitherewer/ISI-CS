 Oustees in night vigil

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Like 20 other young neighbours of his, Sanjay Sardar of Ramchandra High School will take his Higher Secondary test in the coming week. 

 He sits up all night on an impromptu platform, but not to study. He looks out for policemen who may arrive any moment and drive him and 20,000 squatters like him away from Gobindapur rail colony, on the tracks adjacent to Rabindra Sarobar.

 Yet the squatters are determined not to budge. The deadline for voluntarily vacating the land ending a couple of days ago, the colony now gears up for stiff resistance to any police attempt to oust them.

 On the other hand, in north Calcutta, police succeeded in evicting squatters, but only after 20 shanties were torched by the dwellers themselves at Canal Bank on Sunday.

 ?We will not allow anyone to take our homes away. We have nothing to lose. In the morning, I go to school and study. In the evening, I study at home. But at night, I guard my colony,? said Sanjay, who lives near rail gate no. 2.

 An apparent calm prevails along the rail tracks from Dhakuria to Tollygunge. But every house is bustling with activity. Improvised platforms are being built along the entry and exit points of the colony, the various rail gates in and around the colony. 

 Groups of men, women and children take turns in keeping vigil on the platforms night and day watching out for police.

 ?There is no question of us leaving without a proper rehabilitation package. If they try to evict us, we will teach them a lesson,? said Baburam Pramanik, secretary of Ballygunge-Tollygunge Rail Colony Sangram Samity.

 Prod for leather hub

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Annoyed over the excessive delay in completing the Calcutta Leather Complex project, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has directed senior officials involved in the project to complete work within a fortnight.

 Started in 2000, basic work on the 1,100-acre complex at Bantala, constructed by ML Dalmiya and Company on build-operate-transfer basis, has been ready since 2003. But operations could not start because the tannery-owners, promoters and the government failed to reach a consensus on running and maintaining it.

 The government had earlier set March 15 as the deadline for completing the formalities.

 According to officials in the state secretariat, the chief minister, while reviewing the progress of the project late last month, expressed his dissatisfaction over the tardy pace of work.

 A team of senior officials, including finance secretary Samar Ghosh, commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen, director of industries Alapan Bandopadhyay, promoter Jagmohan Dalmiya and a team from the CMDA visited the complex on Tuesday for an on-the-spot assessment.

 On Wednesday, the director of industries held a meeting with the promoter and tannery-owners to arrive at a settlement on the formalities. ?The tannery-owners have taken a lot of time in forming the company and some more time has been spent in resolving a host of disputes. However, we are on the verge of completing all the formalities and expect that the agreement will be signed any day this month,?? commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said on Wednesday. 

 ?Once the agreement is signed, operations should begin at the complex. I see no reason for any more delay, as almost all the hurdles have been cleared,? he added.

 Director of ML Dalmiya and Company Baishali Sengupta said the promoters had completed all formalities and fulfilled the responsibilities on their part. The ball was now in the court of the government and the tannery-owners, she signed off.

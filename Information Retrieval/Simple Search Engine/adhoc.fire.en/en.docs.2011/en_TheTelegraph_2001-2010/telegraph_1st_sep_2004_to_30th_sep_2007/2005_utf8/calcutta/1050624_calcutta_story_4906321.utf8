 An armed gang of three stalked, assaulted and robbed a couple in Ballygunge on Wednesday night, belying yet again the chief minister?s claims of the city being an ?oasis of peace?.

 Detective department deputy commissioner (special) Damayanti Sen said on Thursday that a ?massive hunt? had been launched to track down the criminals.

 ?It seems they were from nearby areas,? said Sen, adding that the couple ? Subir Mitra, a senior executive of a private company, and his wife ? was driving back home around midnight after attending a dinner.

 Soon after taking a turn into Palit Street, off Maddox Square, Mitra spied through the rear-view mirror a motorcycle approaching the car. ?I did not suspect anything. I slowed down and gave the two-wheeler enough room to overtake us. But the motorcycle, too, slowed down and started tailing my car,? Mitra later told Metro.

 Sensing trouble, he drove straight to the garage the car is parked in every night and blew the horn repeatedly to draw the gatekeeper?s attention. ?My apartment is a minute?s walk from the garage, located on the ground floor of a multi-storeyed building,? he added.

 As soon as the gatekeeper opened the garage, he drove in. ?But the moment my wife and I stepped out after parking our car, the motorcyle with three men screeched to a halt in front of us. Two youths, in their early 20s, jumped off and approached us, while the one who was riding the two-wheeler remained seated, keeping the engine running,? Mitra recalled.

 Brandishing a dagger and a revolver, the duo asked him to hand over his wallet. He gave them a Rs-500 note and pleaded that he had no more money. The youths then assaulted him and tried to snatch his wallet. They also attacked his wife and tried to snatch her bag.

 As the couple started screaming for help, one of the goons fired a bullet that hit the road. Mitra and his wife continued shouting, and the other assailant turned on them with the dagger. 

 ?He struck Mitra?s right hand and slashed the left hand of his wife, before snatching her bag containing a cell phone and a camera,? said Sen.

 The goons then sped away. Police arrived a while later and escorted the couple to hospital.

 2 deaths ring in new year 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two persons died in the city on Sunday in mishaps caused by rash driving.

Madhabi Aich, 46, a resident of Aryapalli, in Burdwan, 

was killed when the minibus she was travelling in overturned after colliding with 

a private bus. 

 The accident occurred around 2.45 pm at the Sulekha crossing, near Sukanta Setu, in the Jadavpur police station area. Six other passengers were seriously injured.

 Earlier in the day, an unidentified motorcyclist was run over by an unknown vehicle on the Kidderpore ramp leading to Vidyasagar Setu. 

 He was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

 S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), said: ?The buses in the Jadavpur accident have been impounded. The drivers fled from the spot immediately, and could not be arrested.?

 A senior officer of Jadavpur police station said: ?The victims were rushed to MR Bangur Hospital, where Aich was pronounced dead. The left side of her body had been crushed. We had to use a crane to move the toppled vehicle before we could extricate her body.?

 According to eyewitnesses, the buses collided when the private bus tried to overtake the minibus, causing it to keel over. Aich, who was sitting near the door, was flung out before the bus fell on her. She was in the city for medical treatment.

 ?An accident was waiting to happen at the intersection. Autorickshaws are parked haphazardly along one side of the road, while public works department machinery is dumped on a portion of one flank of the bridge,? said Sumitava Roychoudhury, who works in an advertising agency nearby.

 ?There are no traffic signals or policemen looking out for speeding vehicles at the crossing,? he added.

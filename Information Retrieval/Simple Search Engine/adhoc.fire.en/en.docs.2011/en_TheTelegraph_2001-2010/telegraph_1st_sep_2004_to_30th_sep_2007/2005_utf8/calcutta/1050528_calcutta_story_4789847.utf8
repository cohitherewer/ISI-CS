 Park debut, park neglect

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is, indeed, the forgotten hero in Salt Lake. Or so it seems.

 The Salt Lake municipality on Thursday inaugurated a park called Nazrul Kanan to commemorate the 106th birthday of Bengal?s ?wandering minstrel? Kazi Nazrul Islam. But another park, near Banabitan, where a statue of Netaji was installed about seven years ago, remains neglected.

 The oversight has drawn protests from the Forward Bloc, a constituent of the Left Front which runs the municipality. ?Why has the park with Netaji?s statue not been formally inaugurated yet? We will probe the matter and if the delay is due to red tape, we will take up the issue in the proper forum,? said Ashok Ghosh, Bloc state secretary.

 Local residents, too, have spoken up against the neglect of the Netaji park. 

 ?This is an insult to the patriot, and the onus lies with the municipality. The park was completed in 1998 and was thrown open to the public without a formal inauguration. It does not even have a name. We do not have any objection to the inauguration of Nazrul Kanan, but Netaji park should get its due respect,? said Sabyasachi Dutta, councillor of ward 10, where the park is located.

 ?Members of the Nazrul Memorial Committee had been pressing us for a piece of land around Central Park (Banabitan) to erect a statue of the poet. I requested urban development officials three months ago to give us five or six cottahs for the purpose. We acquired the land, installed the statue and inaugurated the park on Thursday,? said civic chairman Dilip Gupta. 

 ?For the Netaji park, we are yet to acquire the land from the urban forestry department. This has held up the inauguration,? he explained. ?We haven?t shown any disrespect towards Netaji. We even blocked a proposal for a football ground next to the park, as the statue could get damaged.?

 Municipality officials, however, claimed that the delay was a result of bureaucratic bungling. ?Some officials of our administrative wing are purposely delaying the process and we have to bear the brunt,? one of them said. ?They are of the opinion that the forest department is not ready to hand over the land to the municipality.?

 The urban forestry department, however, has cleared the park?s inauguration. 

 ?The Netaji park has been developed by the municipality and is maintained by it. We hardly have a stake in it. If the municipality wants, it can formally throw it open. But it has not approached us in the past three years,? said S. Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests.

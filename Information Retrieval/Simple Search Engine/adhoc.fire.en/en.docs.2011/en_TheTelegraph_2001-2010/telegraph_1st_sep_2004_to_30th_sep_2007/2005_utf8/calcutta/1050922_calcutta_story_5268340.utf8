 Burglars under cop scan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Lake Town police on Wednesday launched a probe into the series of burglaries and robberies in the neighbourhood?s B block over the past fortnight.

 ?We quizzed the local residents for a clearer idea about the burglaries,? said Sukumar Gharami, officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station. ?The people seem to be in a panic, thinking gangs are at work,? he added. 

 The residents are blaming the cops. According to them, several gangs are now active in Lake Town, taking advantage of police apathy.

 The first burglary took place in house no. 244 of B block. A group scaled the wall of the two-storeyed apartment building around midnight before decamping with gold jewellery and mobile phones. 

 A heist at house no. 243 followed on September 12. Two men barged into the four?storeyed building, after threatening the security guard with a gun. They then tried to forcibly enter an elderly lady?s apartment on the second floor. The banging on the front door prompted her to call for the security guard. When there was no response, the lady raised an alarm, scaring away the robbers.

 The third incident took place Tuesday night at Vasundhara Apartments, house no. 239. The perpetrators entered a second-floor apartment by cutting the window grille. They took with them cell phones and clothes. This time, too, the residents scared away the gang.

 ?We are feeling insecure, as we can?t fight armed intruders. Repeated complaints to the police have had no effect. We are planning to employ night guards,? said local resident Somesh Das.

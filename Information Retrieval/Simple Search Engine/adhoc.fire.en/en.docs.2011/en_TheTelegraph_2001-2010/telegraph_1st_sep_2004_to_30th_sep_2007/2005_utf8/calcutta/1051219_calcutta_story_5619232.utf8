 Students allowed script scan

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta University is finally granting students a long-cherished wish ? to allow them to see the answer scripts if they are dissatisfied with their marks.

 The clause comes into effect next year, but restricted to postgraduate examinees. Undergraduate candidates will have to wait till 2007 to avail of the facility.

 ?All modern institutions, including the IITs, show answer scripts to aggrieved examinees. There is no reason why Calcutta University should not have a similar system,? said pro-vice chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das.

 ?We will be the first state-run institution to have this kind of examinee-friendly system,? he added.

 Sources said the university would soon make the necessary amendments to examination rules. The move, they added, is aimed at ensuring examiners remain alert and aware while awarding marks.

 Every year, after publication of the results of almost all major examinations, the university is flooded with complaints from students scoring below-par marks.

 University sources pointed out that the existing rules did not bar the authorities from showing scripts to students. ?But the practice has always been discouraged because of opposition from teachers, who maintain that students are supposed to abide by the decision and judgment of the examiners,? said an official. 

 Under the present system, an aggrieved examinee can apply for a review of the answer script, after which the university arranges for a scrutiny.

 If the student remains dissatisfied with the scrutiny, an appeal can be made to the university.

 This time, the script is shown to the head of the college where the examinee is enrolled or to a teacher appointed by the college.

 If the court intervenes, the script can also be produced before a teacher nominated by the examinee.

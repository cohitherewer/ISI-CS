 - CARDINAL LESSONS FOR HOME FRATERNITY ON STORE-FLOOR SUCCESS

 How do we embrace youth and still service our senior customers? How does my store fit into a multi-tasking life? What is local, what is global?

 Critical issues that vex the minds of retail players across continents. Critical issues that Paco Underhill, the world?s ?sole retail anthropologist?, addressed with rare elan at the CII summit on Thursday, swivelling the focus on the consumer and driving home lessons the home-grown retail fraternity feels it can apply effectively on the ground.

 ?The real education was how and what to observe in terms of customer behaviour and how to interpret that observation,? says Rahul Saraf, Forum MD and chairman, CII retail core committee for the east. ?We learned how customer services and comforts can be created as a competitive edge,? he adds.

 International Council of Shopping Centres India director Amitabh Taneja agrees that understanding the consumer is the key. ?Each customer buys differently and that?s precisely what Paco wanted us to appreciate,? says Taneja, head of the Images Group, which has set up India?s first retail education school in Delhi.

 What has gone down well are the simple truths retail planners often tend to miss out on, points out Sumit Dabriwal, developer of Metropolis in Highland Park. For instance, since biologically, 90 per cent of the people are right-handed, a counter-clockwise circulation pattern helps, ?as the racks are closer to your right hand?.

 Or, the suggestion of playing vintage Beatles in-store on a lazy Monday morning and resounding rock ?n? roll on a busy Saturday afternoon to match the mall moods. Paco also stressed how the entrance is often ignored and misunderstood. ?You must force the walk-ins to downshift gears so that the scope of their peripheral vision expands and the first tool for that is the right size of the landing strip,? the American retail guru had said.

 For Anuj Puri of Chesterton Meghraj, responsible for facilitating a clutch of big brands in Forum and City Centre, the learning curve is all about the format going full circle. ?He drilled into us the cardinal lesson that retail doesn?t happen in boardrooms anymore, it happens on the store floor. More mature retailers have taken a quick turn and become more nimble. Others must do the same ASAP,? says Puri.

 Again, design alone is not the answer, Paco stressed during his discourse. ?The fastest-growing retail channels are often anti-design, where something else provides the magic.? It?s not just about bringing in new customers that retailers should worry about, but ?doing a better job with the existing ones? with your own magic.

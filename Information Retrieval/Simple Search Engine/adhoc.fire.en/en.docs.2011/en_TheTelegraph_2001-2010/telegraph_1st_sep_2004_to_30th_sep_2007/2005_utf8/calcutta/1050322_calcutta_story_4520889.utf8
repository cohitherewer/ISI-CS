The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A musical trip to Broadway

 - Opera traces history of India 

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 A still from Bombay Dreams. A similar venture is on through Bharati

 Sunday afternoon saw Calcutta?s best dancing talents queuing up at Rotary Sadan to book a berth for Broadway. Not for Bombay Dreams, but for Bharati, ?an Indian opera? conceived and produced by Belgian-born, Israel-based theatre director Gashash Deshe.

 Presented by Percept D?Mark and produced in association with international production house PGP, Bharati will travel for nine months across Europe, the United States and West Asia.

 To be choreographed by Shiamak Davar, Saroj Khan, Ganesh Acharya and Chennai-based Vani and Kala, the auditions for the musical is being held in seven cities ? Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Chennai.

 ?What we are looking for are good dancers between 18 and 25 years ? from classical to Western to modern dance,? says Koushik Chatterjee, coordinating the auditions in Calcutta and in the south.

 ?They will also have to be free for one whole year once they are selected. We have been shooting the auditions on video and after preliminary screening, the ones chosen will have to go through another round of judging in Mumbai in the first week of April. After the final selection, they will go through a three-month rehearsal before travelling the world,? added Chatterjee.

 Not only individual dancers but even dance groups tried their luck at Rotary Sadan on Sunday. ?We have given our CV and showed them the kind of performances we are into,? said Soujit Das of the city-based dance group Beatbusters.

 Deshe, who has produced international classics like Cabaret and Evita, has also directed celebrated stage and film actor Chaim Topol in Fiddler on the Roof.

 Bharati is his way of encapsulating the history of India through the cultures of the various regions, incorporating traditional dance, music and theatre forms. With 70 performers on stage and a live orchestra stringing the story together musically, Bharati promises to be a sparkling extravaganza.

 The storyline revolves around an NRI visiting India, with an instinctive resentment for the free mingling of earth, water and milk. But his chance meeting with an Indian woman opens up a whole new world. 

 He becomes spellbound and enchanted by her as she keeps appearing in several forms and avatars. 

 Like Bombay Dreams, the focus of Bharati is on Bollywood. ?Each of the choreographers involved with Bharati will direct an act,? reveals Rajesh Mansukhani, from Shiamak Davar?s Mumbai office. 

 ?Shiamak will choreograph the Dil To Pagal Hai act for the musical,? he adds.

 Presenters Percept D?Mark aren?t too keen on divulging the details of the project, yet. When contacted in Mumbai, their spokesperson Preeti Gaonkar said: ?Yes, we are planning an Indian musical but we cannot reveal much about the project right now.?

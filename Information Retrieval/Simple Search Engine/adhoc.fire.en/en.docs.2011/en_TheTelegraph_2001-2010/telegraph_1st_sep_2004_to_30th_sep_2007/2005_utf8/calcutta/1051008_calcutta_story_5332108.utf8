 Rajdhani gets ready to go German 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A state-of-the-art coach, built with German technology, will be introduced for the first time in eastern India from next month, and passengers travelling by Rajdhani Express from Howrah will be able to enjoy a ride in it. 

 German manufacturer Linke-Hofmann-Bosch (LHB) will provide the latest technology and the high-speed coach will be built at the Rail Coach Factory, Kapoorthala.

 ?In a few years? time, all Rajdhani rakes operating from Calcutta will be replaced with these new rakes,? Shyam Kumar, general manager, Eastern Railway, said on Friday during the trial run from Howrah to Asansol. A few more trial runs will be held in the next two weeks.

 ?Two more rakes are in the pipeline and will be introduced by March next year,? Kumar said. 

 Six Rajdhani Express trains operate between Calcutta and New Delhi ? three each from Howrah and Sealdah. Initially, the rakes leaving Howrah will be replaced. 

 The existing rakes, which are more than 25 years old, will be attached to other long-distance trains.

 According to Kumar, the new coaches will have at least 16 per cent more passenger-carrying capacity than the existing ones. The Rajdhani Express rakes have 18 berths in the air-conditioned (AC) first class, 46 in AC two-tier and 64 in AC three-tier. The new rake has 24, 52 and 72, respectively. The existing rakes carry more than 700 passengers. This figure will rise to 800 and above.

 Passengers will have a smoother ride in the new rakes as each bogie contains nine shock absorbers, against two in the earlier ones. The windows are wider, with double-panel sealed insulated glass specially designed for AC coaches. With improved air-conditioning and noise insulation systems, the coaches will be more comfortable. The lavatory has modern amenities and is also air-conditioned. 

 The maximum speed of the train will be 160 kph, against 130 kph now. ?However, owing to various problems, the highest speed cannot be achieved,? Kumar said.

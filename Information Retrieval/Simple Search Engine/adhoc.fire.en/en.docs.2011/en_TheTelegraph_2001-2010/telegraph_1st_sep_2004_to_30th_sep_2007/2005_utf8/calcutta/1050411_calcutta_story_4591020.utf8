 Civic exercise in green cover count

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A century later, civic body plans tree count to aid future planning, set right past board?s mistakes

 The city?s civic authorities are set to undertake an exhaustive tree census covering the 187-sq-km of the city after a gap of over a century.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to flag off the census work with the help of NGOs in the first week of May.

 The census was decided on as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has stopped planting trees on the pavements on the grounds that with road repair work in progress across the city, trees on pavements will invariably get axed.

 ?The activities of the CMC?s parks and gardens wing have been reoriented to beautify the existing parks and squares,? said member, mayor-in-council (parks amp; gardens), Hridayanand Gupta, on Friday.

 According to the mayor, the census will be carried out under three broad categories ? roadside trees, trees in parks and squares and trees on the premises of residences, institutions and commercial establishments. 

 The fruit trees along the roads or on personal property will be mentioned separately in the report.

 An estimate put the total number of trees in the city at a little over three lakhs. But the census, claim CMC officials, will not be a mere headcount of the trees. 

 The census workers, mostly post-graduate botany students, will have to record the following details:

Name of the species the tree belongs to (local and 

scientific)

Origin of the species ? exotic or native 

Location of the tree

Approximate age and present condition

Nature ? flowering or non-flowering.

The last document on city trees is over a century old, pointed out mayor Mukherjee. ?As of now, we have no recent authentic document on the city?s green cover. This ground-level study is a must to set the benchmark for future planning,? the mayor said.

 He added that the national standard for green cover of a city is 15 per cent of the total area. In Calcutta?s case, it is only nine per cent now, up from 5.7 per cent in 1963. 

 ?Hardly 3.3 per cent more of the city?s area could be brought under the green cover in a span of over 40 years,? Mukherjee added.

 He termed the tree plantation drives carried out by the former CPM-led civic board as ?unthoughtful and myopic?. Most of the trees planted were of an exotic variety and failed to provide food and shelter to birds, he claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Competitions for eating the maximum number of rosogollas are held on and off in many parts of the city. A few years ago, a state minister attended a similar contest. But on second thoughts, these events are bizarre and can endanger the life of the participants. In a bid to win laurels, a contestant might choke or die due to overeating. Given the risks, such competitions must be immediately banned.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 I regularly travel on 3163 UP Hatey Bajare Express, from Sealdah to Samsi, in Malda. Every single time, I face harassment from unauthorised passengers who board the compartments between Sealdah and Naihati stations. They do not vacate the seats even when a genuine passenger shows up. This often leads to altercations. They litter the floor, smoke, play cards and even use foul language. Neither the railway police, nor the TTEs are anywhere to be seen during the entire journey. I had written about the problem to the AGM, Eastern Railway (ER) in October 2004. A reply from the chief commercial manager, ER, in February said that ?vigorous ticket checking had been carried out to eradicate the menace?. However, so far, I haven?t noticed any change in the situation. Over the past six months, I have sent many more reminders to senior railway officials, but in vain. 

 Santanu Ganguly, 

 Naktala.

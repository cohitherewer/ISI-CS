The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A green crusade in tech town

 - SAPLINGS TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MAKE COMPANIES AWARE

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Information and technology infrastructure development is great, but not at the cost of ecological balance. That is the concern driving students of an engineering and management institute in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex to go green.

 ?The ecological balance of this area is getting disturbed, with so many companies setting up shop,? says Pinaki Sengupta, a fourth-year computer science student of Institute of Engineering amp; Management (IEM) and a member of its Green Engineers? Forum, which is launching the ecology drive.

 ?We are heading towards an ecological disaster unless we act right now. Everyone seems to know about it but no one seems to care,? is Sengupta?s complaint. 

 The forum is trying to change that by making corporates care for green. ?We are approaching the IT companies in the electronics complex with saplings and bonsai, requesting them to plant these and encourage their employees to do the same,? explains Sengupta.

 An upcoming technology fair organised by the institute, students feel, will provide the perfect platform to launch the drive. ?The two-day fair, starting Thursday, will see participation by over 100 companies from across the country. We plan to distribute around 5,000 saplings and 1,000 bonsai to visitors free and make them aware about the need for planting trees.?

 The total number of plants that IEM students will distribute is 10,000 saplings and 2,000 bonsai, with the rest being distributed to companies on their premises. 

 Help is arriving from various quarters. ?Subrata Ghosh, the man behind the beautification of Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, is working with us to arrange the huge number of saplings,? Sengupta informs Metro.

 The management of the institute is also chipping in with funds and resources. ?We are fully involved with the students in this endeavour, but the credit goes to them for highlighting this problem and trying to do something about it,? says IEM director Satyajit Chakrabarti.

 Besides distributing the saplings, the drive will also see the launch of a monthly green newsletter, to be sent to companies that dot the electronics complex. The stress will be on the need for more greenery in tech town with details such as how to plant trees the right way and lessons in other green aspects. A monthly symposium is also on the cards, with participation by various companies.

 Positive metamorphosis

 Experiences are the stepping stones to intellectual maturity. They involve a constant process of learning through which we gradually come to accept life?s bitter-sweet truths. Tracing the growth of a young man from an illusory romantic idealism to a mature understanding of the realities of life, All Positive (a short film directed by Tooshar Singha) tells us a story with a familiar theme. It begins on a pessimistic note. Its protagonist, Shimool, is poor and jobless, despite holding a university degree. His lover deserts him owing to his ?failure? in life. Yet, Shimool refuses to be drawn into despair. He believes that an unprecedented event can change his fate and make him happy and successful. Full of effervescent dreams, he launches on a film-making project, which will capture the essence of life and, in the process, help him see it in its true colours. However, his hopes are dashed when he finds only sadness and desolation all around him. Finally, a discourse on positivism alters his entire perspective of life and makes him concur with its eternal truths.

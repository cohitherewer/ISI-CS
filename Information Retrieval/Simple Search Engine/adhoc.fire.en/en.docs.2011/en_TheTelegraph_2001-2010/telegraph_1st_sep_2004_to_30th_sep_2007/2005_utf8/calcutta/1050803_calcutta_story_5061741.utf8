 It was time to let your hair down and revel in the euphoria of diverse dance sequences at the Padatik Dance Carnival 2005. Staged at the Science City auditorium on July 30 and 31, over 1,000 dancers from the 14 Padatik centres matched steps to the tunes of popular western and Hindi numbers.

 Padatik started off with kathak, but with time and the growing interest of kids in western dance forms, we started training our pupils in other genres of dance as well. The response was amazing, explains a spokesperson for Padatik.

 Peppy music, colourful sets, lights and performers in bright designer costumes rocked the stage showcasing their talents in ballet, jazz, tango, flamenco, salsa, disco and filmi styles.

 Performers danced to yesteryear hits like Yeh ladka, Aaj kal tere mere, Jawani janeman, as well as current chartbusters like Saki saki, Dekh le and Salaame and western hip hop. To add to the fun, musical adaptations of Bollywood blockbusters Black and Munnabhai MBBS were staged by the students. 

 While the audience enjoyed the musical recreation of the former in sombre silence, they laughed their hearts out in the latter showing Dr Asthanas revenge.

 Mixed bag

 After the convenience store at Poddar Court, Natural Essentials is southwards bound. The 8,500-sq-ft store was the first of its kind in central Calcutta, stocking multi-purpose items under one roof. 

 The second store has come up at 16/4, Gariahat Road, opposite Ballygunge AC Market. 

 Built over an area of 4,500 sq ft, the product categories here include packed food, groceries, vegetables, imported chocolates, gift items, stationery, household utility goods and suiting and shirting for men. For women, there will soon be a costume jewellery counter.

 The local bazaar model is becoming passe. With busy work schedules being the order of the day, people want to wrap up their shopping as soon as possible. Moreover, they are looking for well-informed and hospitable staff who make shopping a nicer experience, says a spokesperson for the Natural Group.

 Budget binge

 The flavour of friendship is in the air, and why not? With Friendship Day knocking on the door, the young and not-so-young are busy buying friendship bands and gifts for their pals. 

 With caf?s and restaurants doing promotions to woo the young crowd, Orkos, an Indian speciality restaurant at City Centre, has introduced a tempting platter, too. 

 The restaurant, known for its kebabs, is offering numerous discounts on food and beverages for friends. There is a flat discount of 15 per cent on drinks at the bar as well as a 10 per cent discount on food.

 Though most of our customers are from Sector V, we want more and more people from other walks of life to come here, too. On the occasion of Friendship Day, we are offering various discounts to attract other people as well, says Suvajit Chakravarty, assistant general manger, Orkos.

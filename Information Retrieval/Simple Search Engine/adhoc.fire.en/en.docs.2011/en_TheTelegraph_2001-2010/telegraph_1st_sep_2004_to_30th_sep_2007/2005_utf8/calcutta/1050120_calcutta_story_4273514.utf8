 ?The store has something for people of all tastes. From colonial splendour to urban chic, the furniture is the best that money can buy,? stresses the Calcutta outlet owner, Vikram Arora. 

 With the wedding season round the corner, it?s the bedroom sets complete with a queen or king size bed, side tables, wardrobe and chest of drawers, that are doing brisk business here. ?An African wood called Wange is a rage among luxury furniture buyers this season,? adds Arora. 

 Also hot on the buyer?s list is the range of lights with fabric and glass shades. ?A tall light made of white fabric called Kele is proving to be the biggest hit,? shares Arora.

 Zen zing

 The Oriental spice at Zen in The Park gets a new flavour. The Thai and Szechwan speciality restaurant has spruced up its act to come up with a new menu. 

 Zen literally means meditation, and the Thai and Szechwan fare here certainly provides food for thought. Under the culinary expertise of chef Nut Kunlert from Thailand, an exotic range of Oriental dishes have been included for the year ahead. 

 The secrets in the new menu have been handed down to the chef by his father and mentor chef Pra Kob Samranruen. The duo improvised upon the ancient recipes, passed on to them by their forefathers, to suit the Calcutta palate. 

 In the Thai section, there is a wide array of starters, ranging from Satay Kai (satay chicken with peanut sauce) and Khanom Pang Na Koong (prawns on toast with sesame seeds) to Yum Thaley (mixed seafood salad) and Seekrong Moo Rao Deang (raw papaya salad). 

 The Chinese starters are equally appetising with dishes like Dry Fried Chicken Chunks and Crispy Fried Calcutta Bekti with garlic and sesame seeds. 

 New soups introduced include Kuay Tiew Nam (chicken or vegetable soup with noodles and burnt garlic), Tofu and Bamboo Shoot Soup with Shitake and Woodear Mushrooms and a delectable seafood soup with prawns, calamari, crabmeat and shitake.

 The main course options include Kai Phad Kra Prow (minced chicken with hot basil), Pet Rao Deang (roast duck tossed with wine sauce), Phea Phad Phet (stir-fried lamb with red curry paste and herbs) and Poo Jaramet Samros (crisp fried pomfret topped with Thai hot and sour dip). 

 For the vegetarians, the Ao Hoo Kab Normai Fareang Phad Prik (vegetables in Thai red or green curry) and Broccoli Kab Kaopord Phad Tao Chew (broccoli and baby corn in yellow bean sauce) are sure to be big hits. 

 The Chinese section, likewise, has a wide selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Chicken in Oyster Sauce, Crispy Duck in Chilli Honey Sauce, Braised Pork with Young Bamboo Shoots and Crispy Potatoes with Wild Peppers and Whole Corn in Hot Garlic Sauce are some of the pop picks here.

 To top off in style, there?s Chilled Macerated Pineapple with Ginger, Hot Basil and Kaffir Lime, Lychees in Lemongrass Jelly and more.

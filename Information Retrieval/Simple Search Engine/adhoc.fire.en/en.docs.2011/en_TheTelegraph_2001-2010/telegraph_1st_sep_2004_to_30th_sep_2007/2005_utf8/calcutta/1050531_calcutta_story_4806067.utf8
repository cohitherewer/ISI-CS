 After making the Bachchans, senior and junior, dance to his steps in Bunty Aur Babli, Shiamak Davar is ready to rock Calcutta. His dance school, Shiamak Davar?s Institute for the Performing Arts (SDIPA), started a 12-day dance workshop, Summer Funk, at three city locations on Monday, in association with the city-based Incorporated Business Consultants (IBC).

 Accepting students from all age groups, Shiamak?s team trains the dance aspirants in everything from jazz and hip-hop to rock ?n? roll and salsa to Shiamak specialities, like Indo Jazz and Bollywood Jazz. Apart from Calcutta, the intensive workshop is being conducted in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, Nagpur, Chandigarh and Jaipur.

 ?The response to this year?s Summer Funk workshop has been very good,? says Swati Gupta, CEO of IBC. ?With summer vacations on, the school and college crowds have joined in big numbers. To date, as many as 450 students have joined in ? from a four-year-old to a 55-plus mother of three children.?

 The workshop will culminate in a grand show on June 13, where Shiamak himself will be present to see the results of the workshop. 

 When he came to Calcutta for the last Winter Funk show, Shiamak had told Metro: ?When I was young and wanted to learn dancing, there was no school to help me out. With my dance school and workshops, I want to see everybody getting a fair chance.?

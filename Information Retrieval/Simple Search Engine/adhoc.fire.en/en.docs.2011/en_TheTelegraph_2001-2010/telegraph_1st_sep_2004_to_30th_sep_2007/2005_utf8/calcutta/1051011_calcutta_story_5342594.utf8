 A desperate attempt by three puja organisers in Howrah to avoid getting submerged has drowned another three in the town. Organisers of the affected trio blocked an artery in protest on Monday, causing widespread traffic snarls.

 Police said more than 200 residents of ward 18, including members of Pagla Fouz, Howrah Annapurna Byayam Samity and Saraswati Club, blocked Deshapran Sashmal Road at three points from 8 am. The blockades were lifted in the afternoon.

 ?Our officers rushed to the spot and were alarmed that the situation was getting out of hand. They could, however, persuade the protesters to disperse,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintendent of police (town). 

 Seema Naskar (Congress), leader of the Opposition in the Howrah Municipal Corporation, said water of wards 18, 19, 24 and 27 passed through a drain along Belilious Lane, in ward 21. ?But because of some illegal constructions at the Belilious Lane-Belilious Road crossing, water cannot pass through the drain. As a consequence, several areas that received heavy rains in the past few days are now submerged.?

 What compounded the situation was an attempt by the residents of the Belilious Lane area, including members of three puja committees, to block the drain with sandbags and garbage on Sunday. They claimed that had they not done so, the drain would have overflown with water from other wards and flooded their locality.

 ?We had to do it. Look at our pandals. All of them are submerged. If people can?t enjoy our puja, what?s the point organising it?? asked Subhankar Mandal, chief secretary of Jatiya Sevadal Sangha.

 On the other hand, Sumitbaran Purkait, of Pagla Fouz, complained that their puja ?is all but finished? because of what the people of Belilious Lane had done. 

 ?We feel sorry for them, they have been suffering for long because of waterlogging. But we are protesting against those who, obviously with an ulterior motive, have blocked the drainage system,? Purkait added.

 Mayor Gopal Mukherjee said six pumps were being operated to drain out water. ?Besides, police help has been sought to remove the obstruction in the drain.? Mukherjee visited the spot along with some civic officials and assured the residents that things would be back to normal within hours.

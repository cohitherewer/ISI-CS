 Candy Treats: goodies galore

 LIFESTYLE ZONE 

 IPSITA DEB

 A bagful of happiness is what they promise to offer you, and indeed, Candy Treats has certainly brought a smile to many a childs face (and a few adults too).

 Having opened at Forum in August 2003, this one-stop candy shop has sprouted into a retail chain today, with outlets not only in the city but across the country as well. 

 This family-owned venture, according to proprietor Manjari Tibrewal, believes in delivering happiness at an affordable price.

 Apart from offering a wide variety of sweets, candies and chocolates, Candy Treats also specialises in gift packaging with attractive wraps and accessories like cartoons and Disney characters, perfect to catch any kids fancy.

 Sweet delight

 True to its name, the store offers a wide array of colourful candies ? gummy bears, marshmallows, jujups, lollipops and more, in different shapes, sizes, colours and flavours. 

 While some are of the gooey variety, sticking to the teeth, others are solid and chewy, and yet others melt in the mouth.

 Die-hard chocolate lovers, however, are not pampered here as this section is rather limited. But the store promises to change that very soon. We plan to introduce several new varieties of chocolates in our stores across the country, explains Manjari.

 Toy story

 The store has a much bigger treat to offer the kids than just candy. Small toys and trinkets in the shape of cartoon characters and animals pep up the fare. These come in the form of toys, key chains or are a part of the sweet treats.

 Two new characters have just landed on the candy block from the stable of Disney ? Spin Pop and Pop Topper. They have become so popular among children that very often kids come in only to buy them, smiles Manjari.

 These cute characters are attached to lollipops that last a few licks. The idea is to give the kids something to keep even after the lollipop is finished, she adds. 

 Price point

 The goodies at Candy Treats come by the gram, with the minimum quantity offered being 100 g. All the varieties are priced at Rs 60 per 100 g. 

 The Candy Treats gift voucher starting at Rs 250 is a new addition to the gift options available at the store.

 Army flip-flop on Eden

 - Car-park fee plan for cricket, shift in garden entry stance 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a surprise development, the army top brass on Tuesday suggested that Calcutta Police charge a fee of Rs 100 per car for vehicles parked outside Eden Gardens while a cricket match is in progress.

 And in a sudden shift of stance, Major-General Z.U. Shah, GOC-in-C, Eastern Command, also declared during a meeting with government officials that he was not opposed to an entry fee at the Eden Gardens park, but the ministry of defence was against the move.

 The meeting was called to resolve the impasse over the park, which was shut down last month after the army protested the imposition of a Rs 2 entry fee by the government.

 The army had approved the move to introduce an entry fee last year in writing, but on March 21, changed its position and said entry to the park should be free. 

 The park was forcibly closed down, amidst allegations of army high-handedness.

 ?The army?s sudden turnaround is very strange. However, we?ve recorded the minutes of the meeting which show that Major-General Shah supports the concept of an entry fee. We will take up the issue with the defence ministry,? forest department officials said.

 City police chief Prasun Mukherjee, forest secretary R.K. Tripathy, PWD secretary Kalyani Chowdhury, principal chief conservator of forests G.B. Thapliwal and other senior forest department officials also attended the meeting.

 The talks started off with planting trees around the Maidan. Prasun Mukherjee pointed out that trees should not be planted around the Mohun Bagan and East Bengal clubs as well as opposite the CAB office, since it could cause parking problems around Eden during cricket matches.

 Shah then suggested the parking fee. While the police chief said he would consider the suggestion, forest department officials objected.

 ?When the ministry of defence is opposing a Rs 2 entry fee into Eden Gardens, how will it allow Rs 100 parking fee just outside Eden Gardens?? demanded deputy conservator of forests (urban and recreational forestry wing) Somnath Mukherjee.

 The police commissioner then said the army was not communicating properly with the state government and suggested written correspondence with the chief secretary to sort out the matter.

 Chief secretary Asok Gupta is expected to write to the defence secretary about the park, which will stay shut till the issue is resolved.

 The meeting also decided that 15,000 trees would be planted in areas around the Maidan, within and outside Fort William and the Race Course.

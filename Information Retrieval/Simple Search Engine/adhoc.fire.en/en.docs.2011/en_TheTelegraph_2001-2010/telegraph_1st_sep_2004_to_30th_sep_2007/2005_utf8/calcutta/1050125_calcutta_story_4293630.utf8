 Army-green lobby in huddle; queries over crores

 A STAFF REPORTER

A green channel for smooth, non-polluting traffic flow across the Maidan, rows of benches bordering the Brigade Parade Ground for morning and evening walkers to sit and soak it all in?

 These are a few of the beautiful things being finally planned for the Maidan.

 In the latest twist to the tale of the Messy Maidan on Monday, the army brass met a group of city environmentalists at Fort William to discuss ways to improve the greens, even as Writers? Buildings raised an eyebrow about the sum of Rs 7 crore received by the Eastern Command from Delhi for preservation of the Maidan.

 During the day, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government began an exercise to ascertain how the Eastern Command proposed to spend the allocation, that was confirmed by army counsel Uttam Majumdar in the course of last week?s hearing of the Maidan case.

 Officials in the chief minister?s secretariat said the preservation programme could be far more effectively recast if the army was to deploy its own resources for the purpose.

 The direction that the Maidan beautification could take was chalked out by green custodians and activists on Monday. ?When our objective is the same, there is every reason for us to sort out differences and set a common goal to deal with the situation. There have been a lot of suggestions from both the army as well environmentalists, which can be worked out in detail,? said an army spokesperson, shortly after the meeting.

 Participants included the likes of Major-General Z.U. Shah, GOC, Eastern Command, and Maidan case petitioner Subhas Dutta.

 In the absence of any grand plan for the preservation and beautification of the Maidan, the prospect looms large of private sponsors being allowed to carve up the green into pockets of isolated development.

 ?We have been clear that commercialisation of the Maidan cannot be allowed. During the meeting with Major-General Shah, it was made clear that a maximum amount of Rs 2 as token entrance fee would be allowed in the gardens to be constructed by corporate groups on the Jawaharlal Nehru Road rim of the Maidan,? said Dutta.

 The army-green lobby combine agreed to actively consider urging the state government to declare the entire stretch of Outram Road, Casuarina Avenue, Queensway and Kingsway a no-stop, green-channel zone.

 ?If cars stop waiting at traffic signals and emitting harmful substances on the Maidan roads, citizens can breathe easy in the area,? pointed out Dutta.

 Final flourish 

 Zeeshan Jawed 

 This is one final that went off well for Sourav(s), possibly because a cricket pitch was nowhere in sight. The grand finale for the Designer Hunt at Souravs: The Food Pavilion on Friday night saw four chosen designers ? culled first from 275, then judged down to 12 ? displaying their creations.

 Fashion designers Agnimitra Paul and Sayon Mitra, photographer Vivek Das and Tollywood actress Swastika Mukherjee sat in judgment on the ethnic saris and party wear created by Sudatta Bhattacharya, Indrani Biswas, Susmita Das and Sutapa Sarkar.

 Sudatta (in picture by Rashbehari Das) emerged winner to lay her hands on a certificate, sponsorship for one fashion competition and the chance to showcase on Christmas Eve at Souravs.

 Souravs CEO Kanishka Mazumdar said: This entire extravaganza was part of a bigger strategy. We want to promote Prince of Cal as a fashion lounge where people can watch a fashion show as well as catch a drink.

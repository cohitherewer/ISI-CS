There was a time when eating out in Calcutta meant Continental, Chinese, or north Indian curries. Bengali food was not an option for those who wanted to give their own kitchens a rest. After all, Bangla khabar was the everyday fare at home, and who else but Bengalis had a taste for such food?

 It is only in the past few years that this notion was challenged and Bengali-speciality restaurants began to crop up around many a corner. The pioneer in this experiment was Kewpie?s, a quaint 45-seater restaurant with a homely feel, dishing out course-by-course meals in true Bengali style. Created by the Dasguptas ? Prateep Kumar and his two daughters Pia Promina and Rakhi Purnima ? the restaurant is named after Prateep?s wife Meenakshie, popularly known as Kewpie. It took over from The Food Shop, started by Prateep and son Chandradeep in 1980 serving Indian, Continental and Chinese items from its counter at 2, Elgin Road. It was renamed Kewpie?s in 1998 and the catering division became Gourmet Caterers.

 What differentiates Kewpie?s today from all the sprouting Bangla restaurants around town is the essence of a family-owned eatery. Drawing from an ancestral treasure trove of endless recipes, ingredients and expertise in both cooking and presentation, dining here is given a special twist. 

 Not only can one taste the perfect results of recipes from two popular Bengali cookbooks Bangla Ranna and The Calcutta Cookbook, written by Meenakshie Dasgupta, one can also be assured of traditional service on matir thala along with a slow food experience.

 ?Dining is an experience in itself. People today are always on the move but when they come to a restaurant, it?s best to relax and enjoy each item as a separate entity and savour its taste,? says Rakhi.

 The gourmand is alarmed at the profusion of fusion forces tampering with Bengali food. ?The problem is that people will forget true Bengali cuisine. At Kewpie?s, we endeavour to keep alive the tradition of Bengal in the way we eat and the time we take to eat it. It is a ritualised cuisine where each dish is individually made with emphasis placed not only on freshness, but also on how ingredients are cut for specific preparations. It takes in five main tastes (bitter, sour, sweet, pungent and astringent) and ensures that flavours are not mixed and are always placed in a certain order,? explains the restaurateur.

 Hence, one will find the courses come in a particular order ? light to heavy. ?We want our diners to savour each taste.? Its clientele, ?from all walks of life ? governors, artistes, actors and the general gastronomic public?, seems to savour it indeed.

 A glance through the menu sees a number of names popping up. This is a tribute to old pals. Eric is a friend of Mitu?s (Prateep), Armada is a Goan who has provided invaluable tips on Goan cooking, Daphne did the same with Anglo-Indian food, while Diana was simply a dear friend. Then there is Pia, Narain, Arun, Pishima? Saira?s Chicken Jahanara is a tribute to the only lady chef who ?keeps the men firmly in their place?, while Mitur Daab Chingri is a recognition of Prateep?s improvisation on the chingri in a daab concept. 

 ?Each person has helped out in some way or the other. While some have helped in the creation of a particular dish, others may have simply enjoyed it,? says Rakhi. 

 With names, anecdotes, history and lots of tradition thrown in, the charm of Kewpie?s cuisine lies as much in the sentiment as in the spices. 

 For Rakhi, the art of cooking is not in knowing the ingredients but in applying them. ?The Tetul Ilish is a recipe created by my great-great-grandmother. It?s a very unusual dish with very simple ingredients (tamarind, chillies and lots of mustard oil). The real art, however, is in the making. All the moisture must be taken out of the tetul without breaking the fish. I mastered this art only after several years of breaking many a fish!? 

 Cutting vegetables is also an art, she stresses, and each vegetable for every dish is cut in a different way. ?I remember my mother sitting in front of the boti with bowls of water around her, washing and cutting carefully all the vegetables. It?s sad how with the emergence of knives, people have forgotten the art of the boti. Isn?t it amazing how one instrument can do so many things?? The Jhuri Bhaja at Kewpie?s is always cut with a boti, leading to its fineness. 

 Freshness is also a necessity. ?I personally go and buy the freshest produce even if I have to pay a tad extra for it. With so much adulteration occurring in the market, being vigilant with the ingredients is essential. Even the oil is thrown away after two or three uses.? 

 On the spice front, they are made and not merely bought. Rakhi is planning her own range of spices for non-vegetarian and vegetarian Bengali cuisine. ?Apart from basics like onion, garlic and ginger, these mixes will be enough to bring out the taste of the desired dish.? Anglo-Indian spices are also in the pipeline. 

 Kewpie?s has its hands full with an extensive menu for Poila Baisakh. Piar Elish Paturi Boneless, Chandradeeper Dab Chingri and Rakhi?s Jungli Pullao are a few of the flavours in the festive spread. 

 Items like Chhana Paturi, Ghoogni, Quail Kosha, Chhoto Chingri Cutlet Curry and Murgi Gwalando are surely not to be found anywhere else. To ensure no diners are left hungry, the restaurant has introduced the concept of one-and-a-half-hour sittings during lunch and dinner time.

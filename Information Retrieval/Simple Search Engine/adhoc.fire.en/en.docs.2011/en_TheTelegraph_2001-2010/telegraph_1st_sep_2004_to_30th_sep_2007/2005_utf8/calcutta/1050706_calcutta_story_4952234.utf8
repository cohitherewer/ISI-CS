 A political predicament

 A strong, political satire that hits out at the present pseudo-democratic set-up, Shuturmurgh also provides interesting pointers to remedy the current civil and political stalemate. Written by Gayandev Agnihotri, the play uses the figure of the ostrich (shuturmurgh) as a metaphor denoting society?s willful ignorance and total detachment from the politics of the day. The ostrich buries its head in the sand when it senses danger, foolishly thinking that it will be safe. Similarly, the common people, although aware of the hypocrisies of their political leaders, believe their false promises and continue to be exploited by them. In the play, the king, who is the central character, considers himself an aware and well-informed ruler. To protect his kingdom and throne, he orders the construction of a shutur-pratima, whose powers will help guard against enemies. He tries to solve his people?s problems, but is dethroned by his chief minister, who assumes power. Nevertheless, the problems of the old system persist in the new regime. Direction: S.M. Azhar Alam.

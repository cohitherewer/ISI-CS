 Car plate bids off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has cancelled tenders inviting bids for supplying high-security registration plates for vehicles across the state. 

 ?We are preparing to call fresh tenders so that more bidders can join the fray,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Monday. 

 His department on Friday had issued a notification cancelling the earlier tenders. 

 Officials said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself had ordered the cancellation, following allegations of foul play. 

 Trouble arose after one of the bidders moved the high court against another, alleging corruption.

 The transport department, a respondent in the case, is consulting lawyers on how to convey its decision to the high court when the case comes up for hearing on May 4.

 Four companies had responded to the tenders floated in July 2003 by the state transport infrastructure development corporation. 

 One bidder withdrew in the pre-qualifying stage. 

 The technical bids for the other three were opened, but not assessed.

 In February, one of the bidders, Shimnit Utsch, had filed a petition in the high court, alleging that papers submitted by EHA Schider and Werbeteschnik Hoffman were false.

 According to a notification issued by the Centre, vehicles across the country would have to be fitted with the high-security number plates by May 1. 

 The move was aimed at preventing theft of vehicles and their misuse by extremists and other underworld elements.

 The plates have reflective seats and an embossing on them, so that the vehicle number is visible from as far as 200 metres. 

 According to the bids, the average cost of a plate comes to around Rs 500. Affixing them on the 900,000-odd vehicles in the city would require around Rs 45 crore. 

 The figure for the entire state is approximately Rs 125 crore (2.3 million vehicles).

 Slim fit back with wide appeal

 WITH TAPERED TROUSERS MAKING A STYLISH COMEBACK, BOOT-CUTS ARE CLEARLY ON THEIR WAY OUT, SAYS SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Models strut the ramp in skin-hugging trousers at the India Fashion Week 2005.

If you had stashed away that weather-beaten pair of slim-cut denims in some forgotten corner of the wardrobe while filling up the racks with the latest boot-leg pairs, its time to launch a thorough hunt for the old favourite. For, youre no longer likely to be considered a fashion outcast if spotted in a pair of tapered trousers, which was quite the case till even last season. 

 Indeed, slim-cut trousers ? be it jeans, churi pants or formals ? are making a comeback, with boot-leg flared lowers strictly on their way out. 

 The forecast was quite clear at the India Fashion Week, where the trousers got far narrower than last year. And though they were slim and fitted at the ankle in almost all the styles, churi pants clearly emerged the new star in the segment, the most visible item in lowers after the ubiquitous skirt of course.

 Says designer Sayon Mitra: Fashion is becoming pretty much streamlined now and the classic cuts are coming back. Structured and shapely silhouettes are the order of the day. 

 The young designer pronounces boot-cut trousers as totally out, while declaring breeches and churi pants the in silhouettes.

 Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh agrees on the comeback of classic styles. Very strong changes in fashion dont last too long. The boot-cut suddenly became a rage everywhere. But it was just a fad that was destined to die down after some time, says Kiran, who rejects the flared hemline as a teeny bopper look without sophistication.

 She adds: Shapes of lowers are definitely getting narrower and cigarette pants, churi pants and Jodhpuris are the new styles to don.

 And if you thought these silhouettes have an ethnic edge to them, you definitely deserve a look at the western versions of these traditional silhouettes, which feature in the works of quite a few big designers this season. 

 So, if a Jodhpuri reminds you of Raghavendra Rathores trademark opulent pieces paired with traditional gear, you might as well think of lycra versions of the same piece to team with your spaghettis.

 And a pair of denim churi pants could happily replace the elephant legs in your wardrobe.

 Almost all international denim brands are once again coming out with slim-fit tapered jeans. This is a pointer that flared legs have fallen out of favour, feels designer Abhishek Dutta, attributing the trend to the overall shift towards body-hugging clothes. 

 Pencil cuts give an impression of length and define the body shape, he adds.

 For those not too keen on fitted forms, however, the designers recommend the wide pyjama look. For women of size who are not too comfortable with fitted lowers, very wide pyjama type trousers with low waistlines are the other option, prescribes Kiran.

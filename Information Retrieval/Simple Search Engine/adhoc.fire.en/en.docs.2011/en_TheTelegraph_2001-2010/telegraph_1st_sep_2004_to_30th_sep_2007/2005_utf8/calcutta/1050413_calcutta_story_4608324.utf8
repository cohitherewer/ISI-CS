 he minister alleged that Baitanik had no right to the building, though it had taken over several rooms and rented them out. ?Baitanik now wants Monoranjan to leave. I have been dragged because he is from my district... Monoranjan might have mentioned my name when Baitanik members created pressure on him to leave,? he said.

 Twin arrests spark shutdown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Parts of Garden Reach came to a five-hour standstill on Monday after the arrest of Mohammed Ekbal, alias Munna Bhai, and Mohammed Mehmud Ghaznavi.

 Kachchi Sadak in Garden Reach was blocked at several points from 9 am, prompting traders to down shutters. Local residents demanded the immediate release of Ekbal and Ghaznavi, who were picked up early on Monday for their alleged involvement in a Rs 2-crore edible oil pilferage scam.

 The two have been remanded in jail custody till May 12 by the sub divisional judicial magistrate?s court in Alipore.

 At around 3.30 am, officers from the Garden Reach, South Port and Taratala police stations conducted a joint raid on Munna?s house. Ghaznavi, a suspected accomplice, was arrested.

 Two officers, Debasish Chakraborty and Amit De Sarkar, were injured during the raid. ?They were pushed down a flight of steps,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (port division).

 Munna, whose younger brother Mughal was killed in a gang war a few years ago, leads the Citu-affiliated Garden Reach Shipbuilders? Contractor Labourers Union.

 His family and neighbours alleged that police beat up the men as well as assaulted Munna?s septuagenarian mother, a cancer patient, when she tried to intervene.

 The family was asleep when the police team arrived, said Munna?s daughter Saba Ekbal Khan. ?As soon as my father opened the door, they told him they wanted to search the house. An altercation ensued when they forced their way in. They beat me up, and also my grandmother and other family members,? she said.

 Saba claims her father was taken away without producing an arrest or search warrant, and Ghaznavi, a next-door neighbour, was also grabbed by the cops when he asked them why they were arresting Munna.

 ?We had information that Munna was sheltering a criminal involved in the same case,? said an officer of the Garden Reach police station.

 Assistant secretary of the union Mohammed Akbar said people took to the streets as news of the arrests spread. Police officers patrolled the area to ease tension.

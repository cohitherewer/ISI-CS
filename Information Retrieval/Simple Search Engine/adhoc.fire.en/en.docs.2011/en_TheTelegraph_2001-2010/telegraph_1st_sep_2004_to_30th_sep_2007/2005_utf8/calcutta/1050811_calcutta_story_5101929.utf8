 You share your birthday with...

 Suniel Shetty 

You?re a champ at anything you choose to do. Your heart of gold and pleasant nature make you an instant hit. You fight till the end if you feel for a cause. Don?t neglect your health in the process of changing the world. You work best in a small team. You can keep your cool in the most pressing of situations. You are never weighed down by failure; you always move on. ? Kusum Bhandari

 High on club capers

More than 10 item numbers in a little over a year, 

sharing screen space with the likes of Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan and Sanjay 

Dutt... If that is not enough of Mumait for you, she will soon hit the international 

airwaves, gyrating alongside Enrique Iglesias in a music video to be shot in April.

 If real-time is more your style, the sizzling starlet was also at hand on Saturday night, in town to perform at Tantra for the second time since she has shot to fame.

 Munnabhai MBBS has done wonders for Mumait Khan after the runaway success of Dekh le. But now, the gal desperately wants to break free from the vicious cycle of item numbers. She insists that she would not do a Julie or a Murder, even for a fortune.

 ?A girl can get momentary fame by doing such roles but in the long run, she would be the loser if she is typecast as a sex bomb,? feels Mumait. She thinks a movie with Rajshree Productions or Mukta Arts would be best. ?I know I have the calibre to play a lead role in any big budget movie. It is just a matter of any producer showing faith in me and not in my body,? feels Mumait. 

 She will soon have some big-screen action to show for it. The upcoming Lucky has her in a small role. She also has shot for an item number with Amitabh Bachchan in a forthcoming project.

 But actions, as always, speak louder than words. Her performance at Tantra was as steamy as any hot number, as she set the bar top on fire to medleys of Dekh le, Mere piya gaye Rangoon, Kunwa ma doob jaungi and Dhoom.

 Rustic revelry

 The annual Saturday Club Village Fair is mini India under one roof ? members dressed as rural folk from various regions of the country, food ranging from rava vada in the south to makki di roti from up north, and the sights and sounds of folk arts.

 Started over a decade ago, the once humble event which was meant to be a day out for club members is now a huge affair with a variety of stalls, professional entertainers and even big brands vying for members? attention. 

 From mehndi artists who had at least a dozen palms stretched out before them at any given time to fortune tellers with parrots ? the scene on Saturday evening was quite close to authentic rustic fare, apart from the ringing cell phones and the honking Mercs.

 ?This event is a must for us and has been for years,? says club member Manish Sharma. Indeed, from choosing the right costume to preparing well in advance for a fun stall at the fair, the women of the club put hard work into the event.

 From the forever popular chaat stalls to the steaming hot kebab counters, food was the biggest draw, closely rivalled by the presents that the winners of the fancy dress contest took home after an evening of playing rustic.

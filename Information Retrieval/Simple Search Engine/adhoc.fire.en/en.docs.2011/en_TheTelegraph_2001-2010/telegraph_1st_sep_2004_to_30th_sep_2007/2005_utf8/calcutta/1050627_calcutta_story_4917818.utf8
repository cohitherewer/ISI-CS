 Smart cards on strike day

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The transport department will start distributing smart cards to owners of old cars from Monday, the day Citu-backed transport workers have called a strike.

 The statewide strike has been called by the trade union wing of the ruling CPM to protest the hike in fuel prices. 

 Though no commercial vehicle is likely to ply, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, also working president of the All India Motor Transport Workers? Federation, the apex body of the transport workers, is determined to start issuing smart cards from Monday. 

 ?There is no link between the strike and distribution of smart cards. The workers in the road transport sector will observe the strike, not employees of the transport department or public vehicles directorate (PVD), who will issue the cards,?? Chakraborty asserted.

 PVD director H. Mohan said the department had planned to issue the cards much earlier, but a technical hitch had delayed the schedule. 

 Smart cards for blue books (vehicle registration certificates) will be issued first, to be followed by the cards replacing driving licences.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had kicked off distribution of cards in November last year. ?More than a lakh cards (for blue books) have been issued to owners of new vehicles. From Monday, we will start distributing the cards among the owners of old cars,?? Mohan said.

 According to assistant PVD director (registration) Manab Chakraborty, private cars of the WB-02-F series will be issued the cards first, to be followed by the G and H series. Owners of commercial vehicles will have theirs later. 

 ?We will insert advertisements in newspapers to inform car-owners about the schedule. Besides, the owners are also being sent letters. They will get sufficient time to collect the cards,? Chakraborty added. 

 The PVD, he claimed, can issue over 1,000 smart cards a day. A team of officials and computer experts is working almost round-the-clock to feed relevant data about the vehicles in the computer.

 The smart card for the blue book will contain details of the vehicles, while that for the licence will store details of the driver and the period of validity of the licence.

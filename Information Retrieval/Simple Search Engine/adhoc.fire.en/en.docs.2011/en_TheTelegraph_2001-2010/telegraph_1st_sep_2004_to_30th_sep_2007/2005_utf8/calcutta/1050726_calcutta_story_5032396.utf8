 Beach bash

 Coconut trees, vibrant floral prints, straw hats and brightly-coloured mocktails ? the mood was set for a Hawaiian bash at the Big Ben on Saturday.

 The night, titled Hawaiian Hullabaloo, at the Kenilworth pub ensured that the crowd had some beach-style fun, with the d?cor and the attire of the serving staff shouting out the theme loud and clear.

 The walls of the pub were embellished with trees, leaves and fish (made of thermocol, of course) to create the ambience. DJ Kunal spun tracks like Dhol vajda and Gila gila dil gila.

 To pep up the proceedings, a tattoo artiste lent some colour to the arms, backs and shoulders of guests.

 Remix rage

 The console at Fusion at the Golden Park had a very special guest on Saturday night. DJ Notorious, the man behind remixes like Jab andhera hota hai and Aa dekhe zara paid a visit to the nightclub and ensured that the crowd had a blast on the dance floor, rocking to his signature remixes.

 The stage was set even before the DJ from Mumbai took console control, as DJ Akash dragged most feet to the floor with peppy Bollywood remixes. Once the guest DJ took over, the revellers were introduced to a brand new remix of Woh lamhe, specially done by the table-turner for his Calcutta tour. 

 New tricks with the song will lend longevity to the number and that holds true for every track, said DJ Notorious, busy juggling his tracks. 

 People listen to Hindi songs so often that if you dont keep making changes, there is a risk of burning out soon, he added. 

 And going by the crowd response, his experiments sure paid off. The play list included Kajrare kajrare, Dus bahane and Neele ambar pe.

 Labourer drowns in Sunday swim 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 25-year-old man drowned while swimming in College Square on Sunday afternoon.

 Bijoy Valmiki was a contract labourer. He used to walk to the pool for a bath every Sunday from his residence on the premises of Medical College and Hospital. Valmiki shared quarters with a friend.

 Around 1.45 pm on Sunday, he reached College Square. Valmiki played with local boys for some time and chatted with friends before entering the water.

 After swimming for a few minutes, he seemed to have lost control. He slowed down and finally stopped swimming, said witnesses. 

 ?There was something wrong with Valmiki. We thought he was, perhaps, tired after the game and did not pay much attention to him,? said a youth who was playing on the poolside.

 After some more time, he and his playmates noticed that Valmiki was struggling to stay afloat.

 ?He was going under the water one minute and coming up for breath the next. We panicked and immediately raised an alarm,? said Ram Charan Singh, a local resident.

 Before local youths adept at swimming arrived on the spot, Valmiki had drowned. ?It happened right in front of our eyes. He desperately tried to stay afloat, but failed and drowned,? Singh added.

 The police were soon informed but they took their time to reach College Square. Once they did, they decided that divers needed to be summoned from the disaster management group to fish out the body.

 Two divers entered the water around 3 pm, nearly an hour after Valmiki had gone down. The first attempt drew a blank. A scan of the pool did not reveal the body. 

 When the witnesses insisted that they had seen Valmiki drown, the divers started on a second attempt. 

 After an hour, the 25-year-old?s body was found submerged in a corner of the pool.

 By the time the body was brought out of the water, a large crowd of local residents had gathered on the poolside. Many expressed displeasure at the fact that such incidents were recurring frequently at College Square. Some of them felt that Valmiki was drunk when he drowned. 

 Police took Valmiki?s body to Medical College and Hospital. It was later sent for post-mortem, after the doctors had pronounced him ?brought dead?.

 For those with fitness as their mantra, theres one more reason to sweat it out. Bodyline Gym and Fitness has kicked off yet another health address in town ? a state-of-the-art Bodyline Fitness Studio at Ordnance Club.

 People in todays world are obsessed about getting that hourglass figure or flaunting the perfect six-pack abs. After the success of the Punjab Club health clubs and spa, where members seem devoted to getting that ideal body, this is our next big step, says Gagan Sachdev, managing director, Bodyline Sports.

 Whats more, fitness guru Anwar Wahab, a certified personal trainer and fitness director of Indian Golf Union, is heading the fitness team.

 The studio will not merely be offering machines for use but bringing out scientific training programmes as well, adds Sachdev. 

 As an inaugural offer, all members will get a complimentary consultation with Wahab, and then based on his report a thorough fitness routine will be chalked out.

 Fees for members is Rs 650 per month, but for guests the price goes up to Rs 900.

 Bed swap

 Attitude, the lifestyle furniture store on 7/1A Loudon Street, is busy bed-swapping. Theres more than a steady trickle of people ? from the city and its districts ? stepping into this Loudon Street address and exchanging an old bed for new.

 Gaurav Goenka, owner of the store, says: We did not anticipate such a response from such a wide cross-section of people. We had run out of stock. Fresh units have been ordered to meet the demand.

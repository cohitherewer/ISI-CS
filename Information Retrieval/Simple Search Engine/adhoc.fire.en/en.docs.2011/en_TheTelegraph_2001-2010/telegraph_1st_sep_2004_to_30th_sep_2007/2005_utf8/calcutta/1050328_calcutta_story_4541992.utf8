 Beam buyout cemented

 - Sun Network closes in on deal to take over city cable giant

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 After months of speculation, the wait is finally over. Sun Network, the southern cable and satellite giant, is set to buy out Indian Cable Net, the cable TV distribution arm of RPG Enterprises. If things go according to script, the signing on the dotted line could happen on Monday in Chennai.

 Though both RPG and Sun officials are mum about the deal and its details, sources say Sun is using group channel Gemini?s ?surplus? to fund the Indian Cable Net takeover.

 Sun Network, run by Kalanidhi Maran, elder brother of Union telecom and information technology minister Dayanidhi Maran, has offered around Rs 30 crore and will accept Indian Cable Net?s liabilities as well, including payments due to broadcasters and those to be recovered from defaulting cable operators. 

 The largest multi-system operator (MSO) in the city, with a current market share of around 40 per cent, has been plagued by poor collection from the ground as defaulting operators keep migrating to other MSOs, leaving behind huge dues.

 The two business houses have been in talks over the deal for the past few months with a ?due diligence report? prepared by a private auditing firm. Senior officials from RPG Enterprises left for Chennai on Sunday. Only ?a few minor issues need to be ironed out? before the signing, according to those close to the deal. 

 After the buyout, Indian Cable Net is likely to retain its name and some key personnel and continue to function out of its Salt Lake office.

 Sun Network has 12 regional channels in its kitty ? including Sun TV, Gemini TV, Surya TV and Udaya TV ? and an MSO arm, Sumangali Cable Vision, which monopolises the Tamil Nadu cable TV distribution business. This will be the group?s first foray outside South India.

 Sun is also keen on acquiring Manthan, another Calcutta MSO feeding nearly 30 per cent of the city?s cable and satellite homes. The southern behemoth has reportedly offered around Rs 5 crore for buying out the MSO and negotiations are on. Sun had initially expressed interest in CableComm too, another city service provider, but backed out after preliminary discussions.

 Sun is slated to launch its Bengali channel Surjo later this year. The aggressive acquisition of MSOs is a likely step for the giant to capture the largest share of the cable pie in Calcutta, as well as assure good viewership for the new channel.

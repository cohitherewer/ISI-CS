 Pedestrians inconvenienced by encroached pavements far outnumber the hawkers who have set shop on the public property. As the authorities are hesitant to evict all of them at one go, the following can be a ?compromise solution?. A yellow/white line can be painted on the pavements demarcating the maximum area that the hawkers can temporarily occupy ? 25 to 30 per cent of the width. Wooden/steel stalls of a uniform design and each of 5 ft x 3 ft size could be provided to the hawkers for maintaining the aesthetic beauty of the area. However, the hawkers should not be allowed on busy roads.

 P. Sen,

 Kankulia Road. 

 Thanks to illegal buildings and dirty waterbodies, Picnic Gardens is infested with mosquitoes. The conservancy staff of the Corporation hardly clean the bylanes and alleys. Wild plants have usurped the vacant plots and dirty water in puddles are the chosen breeding grounds for the winged-pests. Steps must be taken to prevent outbreak of dengue in this area.

 Name withheld,

 Picnic Gardens. 

 The football match between Mohun Bagan and Tollygunge Agragami on August 22 at Salt Lake stadium started more than 15 minutes late from its scheduled kick-off time of 3.30 pm. The matches should start at the right time as soccer fans come from faraway places to watch these matches. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake.

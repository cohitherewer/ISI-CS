The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Data discord over poison fume check

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The state?s first-ever environment fair, organised by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries, opened at Science City on Wednesday.

 More than 100 industrial units, non-government organisations, academic institutes, municipalities and other stakeholders are taking part in it. 

 Speaking on the occasion, environment minister Manab Mukherjee claimed that ?air pollution in the city has marginally decreased in recent years, despite significant growth in the industrial sector?. 

 Ironically, a brochure (Air Quality of Calcutta) released by the pollution control board on the fair grounds revealed that Calcutta is the most polluted metro, with maximum suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the air.

 And among 100 major cities in the country, Calcutta ranks ninth. Mumbai is a shade better, at 10th, while Chennai ranks 13th.

 The minister?s claim also flew in the face of another statistic released by the pollution control board, which states that average SPM in the city?s air in 2003 was 272.50 microgram, up from 272 in 2002.

 The minister was, however, candid enough to admit that the state government has ?relatively failed? in curbing vehicular pollution, which causes maximum damage to the environment. 

 Both minister Mukherjee and principal secretary Asim Barman pitched for widening the scope of the pollution control board and turning it into an environmental protection agency.

 But most environmentalists at the venue decried the proposal, as the board is ?even unable to utilise? whatever power it currently enjoys.

 ?The new name and the additional power will mean nothing? At the end of the day what matters is effective implementation of measures,? one of them argued.

 Trade chamber chairman S.N. Nandy felt ?industrial units have a responsible attitude towards environmental matters?.

 Pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee, the architect of the fair, expressed hope that such events would bring all stakeholders together and enable them to tackle environmental problems holistically. 

 ?It seems to be a good start. We want it to recur every year,? said Abhik Banerjee, a visitor. 

 His view was echoed by Sumit Mukherjee, Mizanur Rahman and countless others who thronged the fair grounds.

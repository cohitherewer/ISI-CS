 Nicklaus and Palmer: Designs on Calcutta? 

 Four Seasons in Hawaii, Hilton in Vegas, Blue Canyon in Phuket? Now, Calcutta, home to the oldest golf course outside the British Isles, could have an iconic boutique golf resort of its own.

 ?We are scouting for land, with a strong bias towards New Town Rajarhat, for an 18-hole golf course to be wrapped around 300-odd luxury villas of different sizes,? Ajay Chandra, head, business development, Unitech, told Metro. The course designer will be picked from a crack shortlist of Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Greg Norman and Gary Player.

 ?We feel Calcutta has great potential to become one of the preferred golf tourism destinations in Asia, given the city?s golfing heritage and the government?s inclusive outlook. Our effort would be to create a course that complements Royal Calcutta Golf Club and Tollygunge Club, offering fresh challenges to the avid golfer,? stressed Chandra.

 Unitech has already made an emphatic entry into the city?s fast-evolving real estate arena with a 100-acre residential and a 50-acre IT development projects in Rajarhat. The next city project will be a take-off on the upcountry group?s Rs 500-crore super-luxury golf resort, Karma Lake Lands, being built in the National Capital Region. ?With Karma, we are trying to create a top-dollar nest for the cr?me de la cr?me, with golf as the driver,? said Abhishek Misra, head, marketing amp; new channels, Unitech.

 Chandra stressed that the Calcutta project would follow in the footsteps of Karma, with inputs from the same international architecture firm of RMJM. ?Only the villas will be smaller so that individual ticket sizes are more affordable and in sync with the market scenario in Calcutta,? he explained.

 The clubhouse will have 15-20 suites, a contemporary spa, two or three swimming pools at various levels, speciality restaurants and banqueting facility for a high-end corporate clientele. Unitech is also in dialogue with the European PGA for a dedicated golf academy to be housed on campus.

 ?The concept of living on a golf course is extremely popular in Florida, South Carolina, Scotland and now in Australia. We are confident it will gain currency in India too,? said Kishor Kumar Lad, senior architect, RMJM.

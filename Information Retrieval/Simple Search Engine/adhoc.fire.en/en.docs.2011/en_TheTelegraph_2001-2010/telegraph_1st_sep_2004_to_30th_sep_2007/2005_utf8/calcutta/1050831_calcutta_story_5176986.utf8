The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bypass bus hit injures 2

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Going by the road mishap record of 2004, released by Calcutta Police on Monday, the city streets are safest on Tuesdays. Try telling that to Amit Dutta, 48, and Rajiv Mullick, 40 ? a motorcyclist and his pillion-rider ? who were seriously injured when a chartered bus hit them on the EM Bypass.

 The police survey 2004 pegged the accident count on Tuesdays at 56, against the Monday high of 71.

 Tuesday morning?s accident took place off Science City. The chartered bus, carrying office-goers to Salt Lake, approached a bus stop near Parama island around 9 am, but sped past it.

 Immediately afterwards, the bus slammed into a divider and then hit the motorcycle in the other lane of the Bypass.

 Both Dutta and Mullick were hurled to the ground. As commuters waiting at the bus stop and other office-goers converged on the accident site, traffic was disrupted on the busy stretch. 

 The two were rushed to National Medical College and Hospital, where Dutta?s condition was stated to be serious. The chartered bus was impounded and the driver arrested.

 Protesters on that stretch of the Bypass expressed serious concern about police failure to slam the brakes on rash driving. They also alleged that there was no traffic guard present near the spot, despite it being a shout away from the Parama Investigation Centre.

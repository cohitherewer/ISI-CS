 Servant database initiative stymied

 - Families 

loath to registering help 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Bankas of Camac Street are no exception. If police files are any indication, there are several families across the city?s upmarket localities who have refused to learn a lesson from the murders of aged couples in the past, undermining all efforts by cops to create a servants? database. 

 ?It is unfortunate that despite repeated pleas, many still don?t realise the importance of maintaining the personal details of servants employed by them. It?s the responsibility of the family to furnish details to nearby police stations. But not many are really forthcoming,? laments Ranveer Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Just how bad are things? Officers of Shakespeare Sarani police station, the first to introduce the concept of issuing identity cards for domestic helps, admit that a year after the scheme was launched, the response is still not up to the mark. 

 ?There are many families in highrises across parts of Lord Sinha Road, Shakespeare Sarani, Ho Chi Minh Sarani and Jawaharlal Nehru Road who still don?t feel comfortable about providing the details of domestic helps. You can?t run after them,? says a senior officer of the police station. 

 Yet, this was not to be. Rattled by stray cases of murder of aged residents dependent on servants, former police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty had issued a directive asking all the 48 police stations across the city to collect details of domestic helps engaged by families. 

 The logic: To keep a record of servants with the Criminal Records Section at the police headquarters, in case they are needed later.

 Accordingly, forms were printed and sent to all police stations for distribution among families. These forms would have the personal details of a domestic help, including name, age, address, father?s name along with a photograph. ?Once the data was stored in the Criminal Records Section, the person concerned would be handed over a photo-identity card. The data would be then made available to officers for any reference,? said a top cop at Lalbazar.

 While some progress was made, officers-in-charge of several police stations admit a lot remains unfinished, primarily because of work pressure. 

 ?After regular beat patrolling, anti-crime checks and paper work for pending cases, you can?t ask an officer to go and collect the servant?s registration form,? admits an officer of Entally police station.

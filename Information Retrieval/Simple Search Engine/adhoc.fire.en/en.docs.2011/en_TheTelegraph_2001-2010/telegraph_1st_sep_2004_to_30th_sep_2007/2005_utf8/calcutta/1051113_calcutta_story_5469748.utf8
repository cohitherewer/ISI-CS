The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Sabujdwip

How about easing into next weekend on a hammock by 

the edge of water on an island far from the madding crowd? Might be an autumn 

night?s dream for most Calcuttans, but there is in fact such an island just a 

long drive away. 

 About 75 km north of Calcutta, at the confluence of the Behula and the Hooghly, Sabujdwip literally means the green island. A 15-minute boat ride from the ferry ghat at Somrabazar will take you there. If you plan in advance, a motor boat will wait for you at the ghat. Once on the island, follow a tree-lined trail to the cottages.

 Sabujdwip is actually a sandbank. The Hooghly district council and the state fisheries department are promoting it as a tourist destination. Not many travellers though are aware that it is possible to stay here.

 The island is not connected with the mainland in any manner. However, if you are not comfortable about severing your city ties totally, cell phones will come in handy. The smell of the soil, the solitude and the rustle of leaves will keep you captivated throughout your stay.

 Beas, Koel, Meghna and Palpala are the four cottages. They reminded me of the Machan Wildlife Resort in Chitwan forest of Nepal, where the cottages are named after birds. True to the island?s name, the cottages are flanked by numerous trees ? casuarina, eucalyptus, mahogany, segun, arjun?

 The wooden cabins blend in with the surroundings. Sitting by the glass windows will give you the impression of being out in the open. Power supply?s available round-the-clock, but to enjoy the island experience to the hilt, switch off the lights after dark and watch the stars light up the sky.

 There?s not much to do during daytime except laze on the hammocks, swings or the easy chairs. The breeze will lull even insomniacs to sleep. 

 With so much greenery, birds are abundant. There are several types of local feathers. In addition, thousands of migratory birds nest here in winter. Sabujdwip also plays host to hordes of picnickers.

The facilities are ideal for an outing. You can choose 

from nearly 100 plots. The charges are Rs 50 for a group of 25. The ferry ride 

to and from the island costs Rs 16 per head.

Going: 

Take a train to Somrabazar from Howrah. Take a rickshaw 

to the ghat, and then a boat to the island. For reservation at Four Cottages,

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Today, Metro looks at some of the most watchable 

Best Actor winning stars in the past few decades?

 Jack Nicholson: He is the man with the most Academy Award nominations ? 12 in his 50-film career, spanning over 40 years. That resulted in three Oscars ? two for Best Actor, in One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest and As Good As It Gets, and another for actor in a supporting role in Terms of Endearment.

 The bad boy oozing attitude has stepped into every possible kind of role in his versatile career, from the grumpy old man in love in Something?s Gotta Give to the misguided army officer in A Few Good Men to the mentally disturbed patient in One Flew Over? And there are many roles in him, yet.

 Al Pacino: Win one, lose others

Al Pacino: With all due respect to Jack and 

the other actors ? including Robert De Niro, Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman and 

Warren Beatty ? sounded out for The Godfather, thank god for Francis Ford 

Coppola?s stubborn insistence on the unknown Italian. After being Michael Corleone, 

Pacino did his share of turning down roles, steering clear of Kramer Vs. Kramer, 

Born on the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, Star Wars, Pretty 

Woman and Crimson Tide.

 The confirmed bachelor may have only bagged one golden statue ? despite eight nominations ? for his brilliant performance in Scent of a Woman, but he is largely considered one of the best actors of all time. Pacino is also the only actor besides Jamie Foxx this year to have been nominated for Best Actor and best supporting actor in the same year. The blind man with a weakness for Jack Daniels and the tango won, but he lost out on the supporting actor award in Glengarry Glen Ross.

 Marlon Brando: Absent please

Marlon Brando: From son to godfather, Marlon 

Brando was a much-nominated man in his time. Four years running, between 1951 

and 1954, he was up for the Best Actor award for A Streetcar Named Desire, 

Viva Zapata, Julius Caesar and On the Waterfront, and had 

four more chances, though he won only twice, for On the Waterfront and 

The Godfather (didn?t turn up to receive the statuette). 

 Russell Crowe: If there is a young man who took film buffs by surprise, it is Russell Crowe. He caught the discerning eye in a noteworthy performance in LA Confidential. In 1999, he proved that he could almost upstage Pacino with a power-packed role in The Insider, for which he received the first of three consecutive Oscar nominations. He won in 2000 with Gladiator, but lost despite superlative work in A Beautiful Mind. 

 Tom Hanks: This is an actor with a high conversion rate ? two out of five shots, back to back with Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. His filmography reads like a list of the most successful films of the last decade ? from Saving Private Ryan to You?ve Got Mail, Apollo 13 to Road to Perdition. His role as Robert Langdon in The Da Vinci Code is one his fans are eagerly looking forward to.

 Robert De Niro: Can?t keep him away 

Robert De Niro: Six nominations and two Oscars 

aside, Robert De Niro has established himself as a true holistic talent. Raging 

Bull won him Best Actor, while the young Don Vito Corleone got him best supporting 

actor (making the Godfather the only character in history to win two awards). 

Acting aside, he has produced a number of significant films, including Wag 

the Dog, About a Boy, Meet the Parents and the recent Meet 

the Fockers. He is also one of the co-founders of New York?s Tribeca Film 

Festival, proving his commitment to the craft in more ways than one.

 Finally, those in the running this year: Johnny Depp (Finding Neverland), Leonardo DiCaprio (The Aviator), Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby), Jamie Foxx (Ray) and Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda). And the Oscar goes to?

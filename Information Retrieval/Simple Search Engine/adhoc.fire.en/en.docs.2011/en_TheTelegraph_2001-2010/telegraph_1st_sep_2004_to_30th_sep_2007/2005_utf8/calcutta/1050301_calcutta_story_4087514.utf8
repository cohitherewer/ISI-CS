 All together, and nobody minds

 - HOME-AWAY-FROM-HOME BRIDGES THE GREAT DIVIDE

 A STAFF REPORTER

 INTEGRATION ANTHEM: Special students join classmates in all activities. This helps both groups: one feels accepted and the other learns to accept. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 ?She is so naughty,? smiles Riya, nodding her pony-tailedhead. The eight-year-old is referring to her cousin Mansi, also her classmate at Akshar. 

 ?Mansi has a problem with her leg. I help her in whatever way I can. We do our homework together,? adds Riya.

 Mansi has a mobility problem and sometimes needs a walker. But she, like many other children with special needs, seems to cross the great divide between the normal and the challenged quite effortlessly at the Majherhat school that is striving to do just that ? integrate, not isolate.

 Akshar, as principal Nonie Khullar says, was born in 1998 out of an urgent need for an institution that would recognise and provide all children the right to be included in the mainstream. 

 ?It is like a home away from home for them. We try to keep the mood non-formal, looking after each child. The focus is on the needs of the special children,? adds the principal. 

 Take one look at the laughing, shouting and playing bunch, and you know what a home away from home is.

 Khullar goes on: ?A 15-year-old special child may have the cognitive powers of a seven-year-old, but the emotional sensitivities of her own age-group. So, the few special students we have in a class take part with the others in all activities, from music to clay-modelling. This helps both groups ? one feels accepted and the other learns to accept.?

 Akshar?s principal achievement, Khullar points out, is that it remains ?your usual ICSE-affiliated school?, while also giving children with special needs due academic attention. 

 It is the dream of being a mainstream school, while being inclusive of the special group that drives a dedicated bunch at Akshar. 

 With this end in mind, the school has bagged ICSE certification and has put in place necessary academic tools, like laboratories, a library and a computer room. It also organises extra-curricular activities, like tennis, basketball, music and quiz.

 A special mission requires special measures. So, each class has a maximum capacity of 22 students and the student-teacher ratio is 22:2. Says Hima Sood, a teacher: ?While I am writing on the board, the other teacher helps the special children work at their own pace.?

 Geeta Lal, trained in special education at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy and a teacher at Akshar, adds: ?Everybody has something to do? and nobody minds.?

 Radhika of Class VI and Priyanka of Class V could not agree more. ?I know my classmate Priya has a problem but that does not stop us from being friends,? says Priyanka, while Radhika reveals how everybody in her class is always ready to help their ?special? friend Sasank.

 Parijat cannot walk. He sits snugly in one corner of his kindergarten classroom with a friend as tiny as him. 

 As Parijat launches into a spirited performance of a poem from Sukumar Ray?s Abol Tabol, modulating his voice and gesticulating energetically, he sends his classmates into peals of laughter.

 A sound that lingers longer than any textbook lesson on integration can.

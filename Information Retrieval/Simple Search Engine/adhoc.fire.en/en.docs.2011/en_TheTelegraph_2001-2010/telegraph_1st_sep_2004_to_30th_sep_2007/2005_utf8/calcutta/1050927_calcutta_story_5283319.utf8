 - FITNESS CHAIN?S FESTIVE GIFT

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Arnold Schwarzenegger, brand ambassador of Gold?s Gym: Serious fitness

 Coronary artery disease (CAD) or hypertension, osteoporosis or sciatica, musculo-skeletal injuries or low-back pain, respiratory distress or obesity?

 A one-stop rehab rendezvous for a clutch of conditions related to a sedentary lifestyle and a high-stress workplace scenario is what Gold?s Gym pledges as a Puja gift to Calcuttans this festive season.

 The ?world?s largest gym chain?, with 650-plus outlets, 2.5 million members and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a brand ambassador, had kicked off its ?serious fitness? regimen in Venice (California) way back in 1965.

 Now, it is keen to bring US rehab best practices to town at its 57, JL Nehru Road address. The Calcutta fitness pad, launched earlier this year, was nominated as ?one of the best new gyms in the world? at the chain?s annual convention in Las Vegas this July, according to Divya Himatsingka of Ideal Gymnasium Pvt Ltd, a licensee of Gold?s Gym Franchising Inc.

 ?Gold?s has standardised rehab regimens for various physical and clinical, as well as post-operative conditions through exercise and physiotherapy routines endorsed by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM),? says John S. Gomes, fitness manager at Gold?s Gym Calcutta, and a certified trainer of the American Council of Exercises (ACE).

 The customised rehab programmes formulated by Gold?s Gym?s California headquarters will address problems like diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis, spondylosis, lumbar pain and herniated disc.

 ?We will also have measures to treat carpal tunnel syndrome (a painful wrist condition from long hours at the computer) and sports injuries like impingement syndrome (common among basketball players and bowlers in cricket), tennis elbow, ligament injuries and runners? knee,? explains Gomes.

 The management of post-heart surgery or heart attack patients and those with neurological disorders through ?special exercises in keeping with the right metabolic equivalent? prescribed by doctors will also be on the care card as part of the Special Population Program certified by the ACSM and ACE.

 ?We are even offering an ante/pre and post-natal programme to raise awareness among expecting women on the need to exercise during pregnancy,? says Himatsingka. Posture correction to treat conditions like lordosis and ?turtle neck? will be included in the rehab routine.

 ?Our trainers are especially trained in CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) and treating emergency patients, through a rigorous instruction programme handed out by experts flying in to Mumbai from Gold?s California. Trainers from India periodically travel to the US to upgrade their skill set as well.

 Assessment, exercise prescription and rehabilitation are the three steps taken for a client, totally tailored to suit individual needs. ?To break the monotony of the rigorous routine, we resort to the ?shock bomber technique? as recommended by our US parent. It?s essentially reviewing and reorienting the programme once it hits a plateau,? says Gomes.

 Golds Gym, the ?strongest network in the $13-billion fitness industry?, hopes to reach out to all segments in Calcutta ? ?from 18 to 81? ? through its rehab route.

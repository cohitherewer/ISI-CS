 Back to Bengal is the theme and a celebration of the state?s uniqueness is the dream of a project that aims to repackage and showcase crafts, culture, cuisine and festivals while also facilitating business inter-links with tourism.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Brand Bengal push is set for a shot in the arm through Bengal Revisited, an ?urban resort? coming up on seven acres of sprawling green, fortified with gardens, orchards and waterbodies in Kasba, off the Bypass connector.

 The chief minister?s prod has helped set the novel Rs 50-crore project highlighting the entire ensemble of the ?Bengal experience? on track for a January kick-off.

 ?We wanted to do a typical Bengali resort that would marry the traditional zamindarbari ambience with contemporary comforts, while parading the core strengths of the state ? from Gauriya Nritya to the dying crafts of Bishnupur and Murshidabad,? says Bani Roy Chowdhury.

 In 1986, the Roy Chowdhurys acquired the premises from the former owner of Power Tools and Adair Dutt, which has now relocated its manufacturing facilities.

 ?Apart from the industrial sheds, the whole campus was a maze of dense forests,? recalls Bani?s husband Panna Roy Chowdhury, who runs a school there.

 The couple cleaned up the place, built a couple of elegant bungalows, while maintaining the ponds and landscaping the whole compound. Now, the unique urban oasis is being used as the fulcrum by architect-planner Dulal Mukherjee for a model makeover, to be executed in three stages.

 The existing school will be relocated to open up the vista at the entrance. The ponds will be remodelled with boating facilities and lily pool with one converted into a 25-m, six-lane swimming pool. The resort will offer outdoor sports like tennis and basketball, while an existing double-height shed will be reused as an indoor hall for billiards, snooker and squash, with an eatery and changing rooms.

 A cluster of temporary cottages, with a club and an ethnic food court, will be arranged around the trees in the first phase. These will be removed in the third phase once the heritage hotel, to be built in zamindari style, is completed. A six-storey block of service apartments and rooms for backpackers will complete accommodation options.

 ?The focal theme is to revive the dying arts and crafts of Bengal and address the apathy towards these gifted artisans. This could become a potent calling card of Bengal to attract global tourists,? stresses architect Mukherjee.

 Harry Potter on your hand. Along with cartoon characters, flowers and ribbons... The rakhi has gone way beyond myth and mythology and entered the world of witchcraft and wizardry. For, pictures of Harry Potter (or rather Daniel Radcliffe) and teddy bears promise to be a hit on the sacred thread in next months festival.

 A workshop for children on Wednesday, organised by the Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta, handed out tips on making, decorating and tying rakhis. It also showcased a medley of rakhis with these motifs. 

 The rakhi-making session was followed by a Wrap-Wrap (gift-wrapping) contest, with Tollywood duo Indrajit and Rupam as judges.

 The events were part of Temptations 2005, the annual exhibition-cum-sale of the club, which was hosted at the Ice Skating Rink recently.

 The funds raised from this event will go towards the construction of a girls school at Simulpur in Habra, revealed Mamta Agarwal, spokesperson of the club. 

 Power lunch

 Grab a quick and tasty bite and get back to work. That seems to be the idea tabled by Kalash, the Indian speciality restaurant at HHI, which has introduced an Express Lunch for executives.

 Busy executives dont have the time to choose from an elaborate menu for weekday lunch. To make matters easier for them, we have introduced this power lunch and kept the food very light, says Utpal Mondal, executive chef of HHI. Mondal, along with Indian speciality chef Aftab, has designed the menu.

 The set menu comprises a soup, a starter, vegetables of the day, Chefs Special dal, Peas or Jeera Pulao, assorted breads and Kalash Special Dessert. Vegetarians can choose from Tandoori Paneer or Tandoori Salad for starters and Paneer Pasanda or Paneer Makhanwala for the main course.

 The menu for non-vegetarians is Bhaja Machh or Talli Machhli for starters and Murg Makhanwala or Chicken Curry Aftab for the main course.

 On offer between 1 pm and 3 pm from Monday to Friday, the lunch is priced at Rs 275.

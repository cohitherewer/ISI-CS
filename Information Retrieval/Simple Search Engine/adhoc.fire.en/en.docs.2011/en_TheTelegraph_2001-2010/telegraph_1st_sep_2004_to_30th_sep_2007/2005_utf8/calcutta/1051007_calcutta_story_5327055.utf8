 Rousing the rebel

 A thought-provoking play by absurd dramatist Edward Albee, The Zoo Story presents us with a disturbing picture of life, which is full of nameless fears, insecurities and uncertainties. Living in a fickle and volatile socio-political climate, its people have become schizophrenic and suffer from a severe inability to communicate. The action of the play is built around Jerry?s lacerating assault on Peter?s complacent family values, after the two strangers meet at a park bench. It offers a scathing criticism of the state of affairs in America of the late 1950s, which bears a startling, uncanny resemblance to 21st century India. Under attack is the middle-class? false sense of assurance and well being, which they harbour with care and conviction. In the end, Jerry, a social recluse who looks down upon a secured lifestyle, is finally able to stir Peter, a simple, peace-loving, docile man, into expressing his latent animosity against prevailing conditions. Direction: Tanusree Das.

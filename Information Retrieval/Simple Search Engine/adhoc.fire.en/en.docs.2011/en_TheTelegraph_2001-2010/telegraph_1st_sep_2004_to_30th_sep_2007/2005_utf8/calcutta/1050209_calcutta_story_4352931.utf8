The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Surgery bloc will reduce bed count

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The number of beds in state-run SSKM Hospital is set to be reduced in June to make way for an operating theatre (OT) complex on the western side of the main block. 

 There are 18 OTs in the hospital. Eight of them will be shifted to the new complex during the month.

 Due to renovation work by the public works department (PWD), admission of patients to 400 beds on the western side of the main block is currently suspended. 

 There are a total of 1,650 beds in the hospital.

 Since only 1,250 of the beds are in use now, the hospital authorities are being forced to turn away patients. 

 The renovation work is scheduled to be over by the end of June. 

 However, once the work is complete, the hospital authorities will have to reduce the number of beds on the western flank to accommodate the OTs.

 ?We have not yet decided how many beds we will reduce to make space for the OT complex,? said a senior health department official on Tuesday. 

 SSKM Hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi confirmed on Tuesday that of the 18 OTs, eight would be relocated in the proposed complex.

 ?The OTs for general surgery, ENT, plastic surgery and emergency will be among the ones to be shifted,? he added.

 Admission of patients to about 500 beds on the eastern flank of the block will also have to be suspended from June, after the PWD starts renovation work there.

 An official of the health department said that patients from the districts, admitted at the hospital for indoor treatment, will be inconvenienced for some time after June, once admission to 500 beds on the eastern side is suspended to enable the PWD to carry out renovation work. 

 The official added: ?The western side will, however, be opened after renovation in June, but not all the 400 beds in the block will be available for use. Some of them will have to be removed to accommodate the OT complex.?

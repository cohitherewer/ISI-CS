 You share your birthday with...

 Cher 

In love, you prove your affection by devotion and constancy. You can?t take rejection. You work in a planned and organised way. You have a strong sense of duty. You avoid power games and are generally happy with what you?ve got. Your success at work can be attributed to good relations with workers. Even when low on finances, you cannot be miserly. ? Kusum Bhandari

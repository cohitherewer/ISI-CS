 Hospital shuns HIV patient

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An HIV-positive youth suffering from ulcers on his legs lay writhing in pain for seven hours in the corridors of a premier state-run hospital in the city on Tuesday, before he was given admission in the emergency ward.

 The 24-year-old man, rendered immobile by the ulcers, had previously been admitted for two months at Chandernagore state general hospital. Doctors referred him to Medical College and Hospital when his condition deteriorated.

 His family and members of Bengal Network for Positives, a statewide organisation of HIV-positives, brought him to the city hospital around 11.30 am on Tuesday. Doctors at the emergency ward allegedly refused him admission. 

 Instead, they sent him to the HIV outpatients department, from where he was shuttled right back to the emergency ward as he was a ?critical case?. The doctors at the emergency ward stuck to their stand, and neither department started treatment nor admitted the patient.

 ?They said that there was no bed available. We even went to the deputy superintendent?s office, but to no avail,? said Samir Biswas, member of Bengal Network for Positives.

 Only after frantic calls were made to the health directorate office, the state AIDS control and prevention society and to media houses, was the patient given floor space on the ground floor of the emergency ward around 7.30 pm.

 ?We didn?t deny him admission. It took time as there was no empty bed. It was a procedural delay,? said A.N. Biswas, deputy superintendent of the hospital.

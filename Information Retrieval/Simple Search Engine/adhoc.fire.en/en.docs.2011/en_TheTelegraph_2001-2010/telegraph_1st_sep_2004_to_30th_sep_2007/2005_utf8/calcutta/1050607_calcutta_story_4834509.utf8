The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Seal forgery shuts factory 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) has lodged an FIR against an umbrella-manufacturing unit in Joka for ?wilfully and intentionally tampering with the consent letter? issued to it by the board. The board has also closed down the unit.

 Located on Diamond Harbour Road, the unit has been operational since January 9, 2004, without permission from the PCB. Any industrial unit requires the PCB?s permission to start operations. 

 It was observed during the inspection of records that the unit had tampered with the consent document issued by the PCB. Apart from lodging the FIR with Bishnupur police station, the PCB has asked the West Bengal State Electricity Board to disconnect power supply to the factory.

 ?The officer-in-charge of Bishnupur police station has been directed to execute the closure order and submit a compliance report to us,? said a senior PCB official on Monday.

 Member-secretary of the PCB Shyamal Sarkar told Metro on Monday that tampering with the consent letter is a very serious charge.

 ?We have received a number of complaints against industrial units that have tampered with the consent letters issued by us to run their units. This is highly objectionable and is considered a crime. We will handle such cases firmly and take necessary action against the guilty units,? asserted Sarkar.

 A senior PCB official said the authorities of the unit had been summoned after it was discovered that the consent letter had been tampered with. 

 ?We heard the case on May 6. During the hearing, the representatives of the unit admitted that they had tampered with the letter issued by us. After the hearing, we closed down the unit with immediate effect,? the official added. 

 Officials at the PCB headquarters, at Paribesh Bhavan in Salt Lake, have also asked its Alipore office personnel to take necessary steps for the execution of the closure order. 

 Officers of the regional office have also been asked to visit the unit along with local police officers and ensure disconnection of power.

 Santosh Agarwal, an official of the unit, said: ?One of our employees had tampered with the consent letter issued by the PCB. We have taken action against the person and deposited a fine of Rs 15,000 with the PCB.?

 ?We have decided to use our logo and a special type of paper to prevent such forgery,? signed off member-secretary Sarkar.

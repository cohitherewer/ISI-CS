The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From Tagore to Tolly

 Tune in to Tagore and melodies from Uttam-Suchitra starrers, or the long line-up of Cactuses and Chandrabindoos , Lucky Alis and Adnan Samis. The newly-launched TV channel Sangeet Bangla will make music for your ears with a bouquet of programmes from the month of May.

 Though currently airing only promos, Sangeet Bangla has been conceived as a 24-hour music channel with its ear to the untapped and unexplored music market. With a mix and match of the light and the serious, the content consists of Bengali and Hindi film numbers, band and non-film music, Rabindrasangeet and devotional songs.

 ?We are targeting all age groups in the city and the suburbs. The investment is likely to be more than Rs 4 crore,? says Srikant Mohta of Shree Venkatesh Films. The city-based film production house has tied up with the Mumbai-based Celebrity Management Group (which runs Etc channel) and Sanskar channel. Etc will supply the Hindi music content. ?Sangeet Bangla is not like MTV or Etc which has a niche audience. This is a channel where both Tagore and bands will work,? clarifies Mohta, who isn?t apprehensive of its lone competitor, Tara Muzik.

 Currently airing promos, Sangeet Bangla will dish out full-fledged music programmes from May. In the pipeline is a weekly update on the Tollywood goings-on, titled Tollywood Reporter. The section will carry titbits on the film industry, from reviews to interviews, and also keep tabs on the music scene. 

 Oldies from the Bengali big-screen will be featured in a show based on viewer response, while band music and Indipop ? featuring Remo Fernandes and Lucky Ali to Cactus and Chandrabindoo ? will be beamed in the anchor-based Metro Music.

 A morning slot dedicated to Rabindrasangeet, called Kobi Pronam, will be piloted sometime next week to mark the Bard?s birth anniversary. This segment, with a repeat telecast in the afternoon, will provide a platform to budding singers alongside showcasing prominent artistes. The anchor-based show will be spiced with information on Tagore?s music, paintings and writings. This apart, a devotional song programme, Jyoti, has been lined up with local artistes at breakfast.

 ?Distribution is going on and we are trying for the prime band. We will be introducing the programmes in a phased manner,? adds Mohta, drawing up a bouquet of seven to eight new concepts, from quiz-based shows to interactions with singers and musicians.

 The channel operates from a 7,000-sq ft floor on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, equipped with a studio, four editing suites and four cameras.

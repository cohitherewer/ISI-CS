 The fun of not knowing where one is going

 After everything from scuba-diving to adventure travel, HOMI ADAJANIA is ready with his directorial debut, Being Cyrus. He speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about the unusual movie and the experience of working with his eclectic cast

 Saif Ali Khan in Being Cyrus

 You have been associated with offbeat movies like Bhopal Express and Everybody Says I?m Fine. And now there?s Being Cyrus... Are they your kind of films?

 Honestly, I never watched too many films as a kid. I loved the old martial arts films, though. What I enjoy is the concept of storytelling and the way the medium of film complements that. I was never intimidated by my lack of technical experience or that I never went to any film school. For me, it?s wholly a personal form of expressing a thought or an idea. I?m not too well versed with the history of film or who has done what. So in terms of directors I enjoy, Pedro Almadovar, Tim Burton, (Martin) Scorsese, and probably Oliver Stone first pop into my head. I assisted Mahesh Mathai (Highlight Films) for a year after college. Then I did various stints involving freelance writing. I went on to become an advanced scuba-diving instructor. Then I did a lot of adventure travel, and then some bizarre jobs as well. I took a fakir to Venice as part of one of the largest international art festivals and scouted cripples and mutants for a very controversial Italian project.

 Why an English film? What kind of an audience are you looking at?

 The decision was not predetermined at all. I hadn?t planned to make a film, but when I read the story by Kersi Khambatta, I just knew that it would be my first film. It?s difficult for me to tell you what kind of audience I am looking at. This film is not of a specific genre, like say a thriller. I made this film intuitively, so I guess that would translate into making the film for an audience with sensibilities similar to mine ? probably the movie-goer who enjoys something unusual.

 How did you get such an eclectic cast (Saif, Dimple, Naseeruddin and Boman) for your directorial debut?

 The film is about characters. If the cast seems eclectic it?s probably born out of the demands of the story. I think they agreed because I knew exactly what I wanted and conveyed my vision clearly. What was important to me was that the cast knew exactly what they were doing. My producers were very supportive. They created a comfort zone for me by giving me whoever I wanted. I needed everyone to be truly involved and the cast and crew were absolutely fantastic. 

 How did you convince Saif to do something so offbeat?

 Saif has an incredible sensibility as an actor and it was very easy for us to relate to each other. He was great fun to work with, no frills, and we both love taking the piss. He loves doing his commercial Hindi cinema and was willing to break the mould and try something so radically different as an exploration in his craft, I guess. 

 By making a film on Parsis, are you restricting your viewership?

 Being Cyrus does not endeavour to portray the Parsi community in any way religious or cultural. It only uses a Parsi family as an intriguing backdrop against which a universal story is told. It could have well been about a Sicilian, Iranian or Eskimo family for all I care.

Naseer says he is tired of playing roles of Parsis. How did you manage to rope him in?

 I can?t quite remember, but I don?t think Naseer has played a reclusive dope-smoking retired sculptor Parsi before. Like I said, it?s not about being Parsi. It?s like saying someone is tired of playing a guy! The characters belong to a Parsi family, so that?s the backdrop. I think Naseer agreed because his character and the project were very different.

 What was it like working with Saif, Naseer and Dimple? 

 They are all cool and very professional people to work with. There was a fabulous equality on the sets that allowed for a very productive working environment. Each of them wrapped up in 8-10 days. They brought a lot of energy and for me, it was important that the experience should be good. They made sure it was great.

Your future plans...

 Right now, I?m auditing (observing) some acting classes that explore character development and role scripting in New York. This year, I?m planning to work on two very different documentaries as well. I think there?s an otherwise elusive truth that you can grab through the medium of documentary films. I also have two very interesting scripts in the pipeline being written by my co-writer, Kersi Khambatta, though I am open to directing other people?s screenplays. That?s about as much as I can possibly plan for the future. The fun is in not really knowing where the journey takes you.

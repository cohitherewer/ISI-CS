 Vidyasagar Setu: Cheat-and-run crackdown

 Concerned over a sharp decline in toll collection from Vidyasagar Setu, the government plans to instal automatic machines and modernise the collecting system. It has also decided to deploy more police personnel on the bridge to maintain law and order.

 Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb discussed the matter on Tuesday at a meeting with transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) chairman Sadhan Banerjee and senior state police officers.

 At the meeting, HRBC officials reportedly complained that criminal activity on and off the bridge had increased due to scarcity of policemen.

 The tendency among a section of drivers to avoid paying the toll by bribing the personnel manning the gates and police was also discussed at the meeting, Writers? Buildings officials said.

 The home secretary later said that senior police officers from both the city and Howrah district have been asked to take steps to keep a check on crime on the bridge.

 HRBC officials said the toll collected from the bridge is far below the target. The number of vehicles using the bridge daily is also below the estimated figure.

 HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee said the move to modernise the toll plaza and instal automatic gates is aimed at increasing revenue, minimising corrupt practices and saving time.

 The agency has tied up with IIT Kharagpur for technical knowhow on installing, operating and maintaining the automatic machines.

 The machines will be like those in the Metro stations. The vehicle operators will have to purchase a magnetic card on payment and the gate at the toll plaza will open after the card is inserted in the machine. However, one or two lanes in the toll plaza will be operated manually for drivers who have failed to buy the card and during emergencies.

 ?Once the system is introduced, there will be no scope to cross the bridge without payment or by bribing anybody,?? the HRBC vice-chairman said.

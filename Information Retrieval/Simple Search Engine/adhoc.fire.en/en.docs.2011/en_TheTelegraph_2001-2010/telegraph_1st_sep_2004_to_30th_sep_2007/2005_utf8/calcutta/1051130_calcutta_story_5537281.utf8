The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Healthcare, hand in hand

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Lack of a facility in a state-run hospital will no longer force a patient to leave. Instead, he will be given an opportunity ? if he can afford it ? to be treated at a private hospital where the facility exists.

 The state government, in an attempt to reform the health sector, is planning to join hands with a string of private healthcare centres in and around Calcutta in certain super-speciality fields.

 In the new scheme, health department officials said, patients in government hospitals and medical colleges will be sent to nursing homes for cardio-thoracic surgery, endoscopic surgery, critical general surgery, MRI and dialysis and for treatment in ophthalmology, obstetrics and gynaecology, among others.

 ?We aim to provide better treatment to patients and have decided to rope in private healthcare institutions, so a patient does not leave a state-run hospital because of a lack of facilities,?? health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said on Tuesday.

 ?Medical science has improved a lot, but we are yet to provide all kinds of facilities in our hospitals. Private hospitals, on the other hand, have a slew of modern facilities. If a particular facility is not available in our hospitals, we will refer patients to any of the enlisted private hospitals,?? he added.

 The rates for treatment or diagnostic tests at clinics or nursing homes will be fixed ?mutually?, but they will be ?much less? than what are charged from patients approaching such centres on their own. 

 ?The patients who will be treated at private hospitals will have to pay a major part of the expenses and the government will bear the rest. No fee will be charged from the poor,? an official said.

 The government is trying to rope in at least 10 private hospitals and expressions of intent have been invited from them. 

 ?The list will be finalised after we assess the infrastructure of the hospitals, the availability of doctors and technicians and the price structure,? minister Mishra elaborated.

 The new system is likely to take effect from January. The government?s decision follows growing criticism of the ?poor infrastructure? in state-run hospitals.

 Showcase seeks partner

 Durga puja as a global tourism pivot needs strategic partners to propel it forward. A Telegraph picture

 Perky percussion, a river rendezvous, walking the shops, the golfing greens, captivating choreography, mouth-watering traditional Bengali cuisine and much more...

 The Puja-push initiative kicked off by NGO Happenings in 2003 was the first structured move to showcase Bengal?s unique festival to a wider audience. Now, in its third edition, even as the guest roster at the four-day package has grown from 60 to 180, this Pujas marks the end of a chapter.

 ?This is the cessation of our pilot programme. We have done it on a lab scale and underlined what needs to be done to wrap-sell our biggest asset. Now, if the Durga puja as a global tourism pivot has to be upgraded to the status of a Rio Carnival or a Mardi Gras, there must be strategic partners to propel it forward,? says Viji Iyengar of Happenings.

 Iyengar feels no single party is big enough to manage the Pujas and to ensure that the Happenings start-up push doesn?t go waste, representatives from hotels, airlines, the travel trade and the corporate world must come forward. 

 ?We are ready to share our expertise, but to take it ahead and make it a commercially-viable project, a wider participation is imperative,? he feels.

 Based on learning from the two earlier editions, Happenings re-crafted its package this year, which has been ?acclaimed and patronised? by individuals and groups from diverse backgrounds, with guests from countries like Norway, the US, the UK, Dubai, Malaysia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany taking the trip.

 Support has also come from top executives of blue-chip corporate houses like the Birla and Tata groups, ICICI and Exide ? many offering the Happenings package to their prime customers or business associates.

 ?Its a win-win situation. To the organisers, this presents a wonderful platform to showcase Calcutta. For us, it?s a great opportunity to meet our customers on home turf. Besides, the package is so enchanting, it ensures everybody leaves with a clutch of fond memories,? observes Deepak Tandon, president, Birla Tyres. He feels the state government, ?so keen on selling Bengal?, could use this as a fulcrum to draw foreigners as well.

 For overseas tourists, the Happenings Mahotsav has always meant exploring the myriad moods of the festival and the city. ?The warmth of the people here is amazing. They?ll do anything to help and I?m hoping to make a few friends,? says Claire March, who has flown down from Birmingham with her auditor colleague Neil Philpot.

 Khokan Mukerji, another Happenings founder-member, is excited at the ?quality of numbers? the package has elicited. ?Each of our guests is a thought leader and once we succeed in evolving a business model with the help of all the stakeholders, we can achieve exponential growth and Calcutta will benefit from the ripple effect,? he observes.

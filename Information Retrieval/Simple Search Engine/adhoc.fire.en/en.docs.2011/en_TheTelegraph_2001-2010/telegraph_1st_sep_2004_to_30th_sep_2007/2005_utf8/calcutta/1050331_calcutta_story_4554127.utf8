 A fight over a lift at the Central Government Office Complex in Salt Lake left seven people injured and suspended work in a number of departments for the better part of Wednesday.

 The DF-block complex, near Jyoti Basu?s residence, saw staff protest against the ?high-handed? behaviour of CBI employees from the three units located in the building. Police were called in to mediate. 

 Trouble started around 9.45 am, when Pronob Kumar Sengupta, senior audit officer of AG Bengal, found none of the lift operators around. ?I went to the lift operators? room to find out why,? explained Sengupta.

 Employees of the Botanical Survey of India (BSI), Archaeological Survey of India and the National Atlas Thematic Mapping Organisation offices also joined in and a heated exchange ensued, followed by a scuffle.

 ?CBI constable Subir Kundu, who was walking by, tried to pacify the groups. The crowd read it wrong and he was beaten up, so we had to intervene,? claimed a senior CBI officer. But the protestors alleged that the CBI officers turned violent. ?They threw me on the ground and beat me up. My spectacles were broken,? claimed Gopal Bhattacharya, a BSI employee.

 As word spread, other employees left work to stage a demonstration against the CBI. Officers from Bidhannagar (North) police station were called in and till late evening, CBI top brass, led by Special Crime Branch superintendent A.K. Sahay, held discussions with the aggrieved employees. 

 Almost eight hours later, around 6.30 pm, the matter was finally resolved. ?There was no written complaint, so we left it at that,? explained district police superintendent Parveen Kumar.

 The central wing of the CPWD, in charge of the eight-storeyed building, housing around 50 offices, has initiated an inquiry. ?We have also sent a situation report to senior officers, pressing for immediate repair of the lifts. Of eight lifts in two blocks, five or six are functional. But there was some slackness on the part of lift operators,? admitted Utpal Ganguly, assistant engineer, CPWD.

 Sandwich stop 

 A look at Subway at Spencer Plaza, Chennai 

 With presence in 84 countries and 23,851 restaurants all over the world, Subway Sandwiches is all set to bring its submarine-shaped sandwiches to Calcutta. 

 In India,the first Subway restaurant was started in 2001 in New Delhi. Today, there are 49 restaurants in the country. Hence, the one in Calcutta is going to be a milestone for Subway. 

 The big-bite address, set to open by the end of this month, is coming up in the heart of the city at 234/3A, Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose Road. Built over a mere 600 sq ft, the restaurant will be seating 20 people. 

 The US-based international chain has the biggest share in the world sandwich slice. ?It is one of the leading fast-food chains in the world and believe it or not, there are more Subway restaurants than there are McDonald outlets in most cities. Moreover, the sandwiches here are both affordable and easy on health,? informs Rishi Bajoria, area development manager (Calcutta), Subway Sandwiches. 

 ?By the end of 2006, we intend to ramp it up to 100 outlets. The plan is to double this number by the end of 2008,? says Manpreet Gulari, area development manager (India), Subway.

 Subway sandwiches basically come in two sizes of six inches and 12 inches stuffed with vegetables and choice of meat. 

 The five vegetables used in the sandwiches across all restaurants are onions, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and capsicum. 

 The choice of meat includes turkey, chicken, lamb and tuna. Subway has its own vendors in Delhi and Bangalore who supply bread, meat and vegetables to all its restaurants.

 ?There will be a cold storage in the restaurant which can store the bread and other condiments for more than a month. However, we are going to try and use up the entire stock within that period. If not, irrespective of the wastage, the stuff will be disposed of,? says Bajoria. 

 No cooking will be done within the outlet. Once a customer enters, he or she will simply have to identify the size of the sandwich, seasoning and stuffing. Everything will be done in front of the customer. 

 The sandwich will be accompanied by a soft drink of choice and chips. Items like Kali Mirch Chicken, Chettinad Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Paneer Tikka, Aloo Tikki and Spicy Vegetarian Seekh have also been introduced within the menu to suit the Indian palate.

 So what is the pocket pinch? A vegetarian would have to shell out anything between Rs 50 and Rs 60. For meat lovers, the prices can go up to anything between Rs 90 and Rs 100.

 ?Most people are under the impression that the sandwiches at Subway cost a fortune. But you must realise that you are not merely having a sandwich but a complete combo meal in itself with your preferred choice of meat and vegetables. So the pricing has been done keeping in mind the amount of money that is spent on a meal,? says Bajoria.

 Mask of deception

 Human relationships form the basis of civilization and society. Our lives are nurtured and built on the strength of the relationships we share with our near and dear ones. Unfortunately, the so-called progress of society has brought in its wake the destruction of this core, sustaining fibre of life. Exposing the hollow sham of modern inter-personal relationships, Gandhar?s latest production, Satyaasatya is an ironic reflection of the falsity, deception and pretence that we practise in our daily lives. Based on a play by J.B. Priestley, it is a bitter portrayal of the utter dishonesty and futility of human relationships. Rooted in a bed of shallow, inane promises, they are kept alive only by carefully concealing its essential void underneath a veil of false amity and harmony. But when this veil is accidentally lifted, we hide our faces in embarrassment, hurriedly endeavouring to restore social propriety by putting on our masks of deception once again. Direction: Shyamal Chakraborty.

 Colours and contours

 Perhaps one of the most gifted artists of the present generation, Devajyoti Ray follows a grammar of art entirely his own. A remarkable aspect of his works is his unconventional use of colours and shapes, which invests them with an aura of pseudo-realism. The ongoing exhibition of his paintings presents richly figurative works based on realistic drawings. Though realistic in terms of theme and proportion, the paintings assume metaphorical dimension if seen from the perspective of colour-scheme and use of symbols. In Alone for a Living, a crimson river is set against the pink countenance of a fisherman who has blue and green hands. Ray?s use of simple, geometric shapes is significant in the sense that a single shape assumes different meanings in different contexts. Thus, a circle takes on the impression of a lid in Soliloquy and is a clock in In Despair. What is interesting about Ray?s art is that his off-beat colours and contours successfully create a balance between the real and the surreal, transporting the viewer to the artist?s private, imaginary world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Carnival of collectibles, wrought in glass

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Part of Vikram Bachhawat?s collection

 Be it a frosted (acid-etched) elephant vase, a JIP (Jack-in-the-Pulpit), a Sowerby Diving Dolphin or a Panaji Peacock Eye ? he has them all. He has even added a few of his own discoveries to the nomenclature, like the ?Id Ka Chand? or Festival Moon, Havelli and Calcutta Diamonds.

 Sitting in his Humayun Court magic menagerie, Vikram Bachhawat enriches a collectibles canvas that?s almost uncharted in this part of the world. He has the ?world?s largest individual array of carnival glass?, over 6,000 pieces in all and growing.

 These iridised glass pieces used to be given away as gifts or souvenirs at carnivals, and perhaps derived the name from that connection. While The Imperial Glass Company of Bellaire, Ohio ?probably produced the first piece of carnival glass? around 1909, others like Millersburg, Northwood, Dugan and Fenton soon joined the caravan.

 ?Carnival glass was in vogue between the 20s and 40s, after which it went out of fashion and companies stopped production. Now all over the world, it has become a collector?s item, even though awareness of it in India is relatively poor,? says Vikram, who has been piecing together his splendid collection since 2000.

 While he pays anything between Rs 100 and Rs 2,000 for a piece procured through brokers and dealers in Calcutta, Gujarat and Mumbai, the same item would fetch ?$20 to $600? in the global carnival glass mart. ?I know Im sitting on a virtual goldmine, and it?s only a matter of time before the Indian market also explodes,? he smiles.

 And Vikram can afford to rest on his oars. Finding pride of place in his rare repertoire are masterpieces like the ?Havelli? ? ?a bit of Millersburg Gay 90s design? ? the ?Calcutta Diamonds?, an Indian water set by Jain Glass Works, and the ?Festival Moon?, ?the only such piece in the world?.

 Bill Edwards and Mike Carwile acknowledge the Calcutta collectors contribution in the ninth edition of the Standard Encyclopaedia of Carnival Glass. ?When we first learned about the products of the Jain Glass Works, we felt we?d covered the subject. But through long correspondence with Vikram Bachhawat, we?ve learned there were, indeed, more than 20 glassmakers in India following World War II,? the duo writes.

 While vases are the most predominant items in his carnival collection, there are other variants, like decanters and stemmed goblets, banana bowls and bonbons, candlesticks and hatpin holders, cookie jars and powder jars with lids ? in various shapes and sizes. And in myriad hues as well ? from pastel shades of white, ice blue and ice green with a frosty look to opalescent treatments like blue, amethyst, lime green, ice green, vaseline and red?

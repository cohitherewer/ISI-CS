 A new sound has come to town to keep your favourite cocktails company. Beat the stress this season at The Junction, the bar at Taj Bengal, where The Energetic will be playing. 

 The group, which has come to town from the Philippines, includes two singers Janet and Annie, while Jhun is lead guitarist and vocal keyboard player.

 Having performed in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, Abu Dhabi, Chennai and Mumbai, the band is already loving it here. People in Calcutta are very warm. We love the Indian food too, smiles Jhun.

 Annie has already picked up a Bollywood beat, with Sushmita Sen and Salman Khan topping the charts.

 The band promises a musical splash of rock, pop and also hit Hindi numbers. Singing songs like Woman in love and Wind beneath my wings, they draw inspiration from pop stars like Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Tony Braxton.

 Desi numbers like Alishas Made in India and Dhoom machale are also part of the groups repertoire.

 Malt halt

 William Grant, in collaboration with ITC Sonar Bangla, presented its Rare Whisky Collection (RWC) to a select group of single malt connoisseurs on Wednesday. 

 The collection is a range of the most exclusive and highly-coveted single malts, including the likes of Glenfiddich 1937, one of the oldest and the most expensive single malts around. A bottle can set you back by 10,000 pounds. In fact it is said that when a bottle of the spirit is opened, six Scottish pipers are called in to mark the occasion!

 Other famed classics in the RWC stable are Ladyburn 1973, of which only 250 cases have been produced as the distillery does not exist anymore, the Girvan 1964, a single grain Scotch, considered a collectors item, and Glenfiddich Gran Reserva.

 Sandeep Arora, RWC representative in India, was present to introduce this premium lifestyle product to Calcutta and to address queries from the audience. India has immense growth potential for single malts. Delhi and Chennai have already responded to RWC and Calcutta is now high on the agenda, he said.

 Kurta craze

 Designers Rachna Bansal and Lakshmi Bajaj have come up with an exclusive line of ethnic wear, which they will be showcasing at their studio at 4, Ashoka Road, Alipore, till July 9. Under the label Concept, the duo specialises in kurtas. 

 Using fabrics like linen, georgette and silk, the styles are creative, using embroidery as well as applique work and bright prints. Sequins, beads, mirrors and gota have been used to create a contemporary look. The kurtas range between Rs 1,000 and Rs 4,000.

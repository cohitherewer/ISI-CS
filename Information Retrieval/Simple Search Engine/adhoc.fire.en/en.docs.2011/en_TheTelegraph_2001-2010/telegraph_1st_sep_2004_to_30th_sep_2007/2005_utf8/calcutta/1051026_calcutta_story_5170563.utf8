 DJ Julia: The French connection

 Want to connect with the youth in Calcutta? Just make music in a nightclub. Adding a global dimension to Friday night fever, France and America will soon make the city party crowd dance to their tunes.

 DJ Julia, who specialises in disco, electro and house, is being flown in from France to rock Tantra on October 28. The French Association hopes the sound of her music will help the youth in the two countries connect.

 ?Her performance and interaction will give an insight into French culture and music. It should come in handy to those who want to go to France to study and spend some time there,? explains Emmanuelle deDecker, deputy director, cultural events, of The French Association.

 For once, the Americans and the French will be making an equal music. What Julia hopes to do for France, DJ Eddie Stats aims to do for America when he takes control of Tantra console on November 11.

 The US Consulate is flying Eddie down from New York City. ?There have been various student exchange programmes, but this is the first time that a DJ is being brought in,? says Bhaskar Rajah, deputy director, American Center.

 So, move over university tours and educational fairs, the music missionaries are here. ?The objective is to connect to the youth and we chose a nightclub as it has emerged as a major youth hangout. The DJ will give an insight into the popular culture and music of America, talking on evils like smoking, drinking and drugs,? adds Rajah.

 The timing, too, is not lost on most. 

 ?The interaction between the two countries is at an all-time high. So, there is a need that the awareness also starts at the grassroot level,? stresses Rajah.

 The fact that the population of India is ?growing younger with every passing year?, with ?many having been educated in the US and many aspiring to go there?, is an obvious clincher.

 DJ Eddie Stats: Music and culture of the US 

The State Department has often utilised the services of Eddie Stats as a representative of American DJ culture. He has been successful in innovating on international sounds like Hip-Hop, Bhangra, Bollywood and Afrobeat.

 On November 11, he will be turning the tables for the American Alumni Association and Indians who aspire to go to US for higher studies.

 November 12 will be an open house, again at The Park night club. And on November 14, he will be part of the Children?s Day celebrations at Oxford Bookstore, interacting with schoolchildren and talking about American culture ? misnomers and all ? and about clean living.

 For students out partying on Friday nights, the French and American initiatives could serve up a heady concoction of work and play. 

 ?It?s cool to strengthen cultural ties by getting a DJ down to make music and answer some basic questions about life in France or America,? says Kunal, a Tantra regular.

 And night clubs emerging as the stage for cultural exchange is but natural. ?This is a place where youths from all walks of life congregate. So, they are best suited for such programmes,? says a spokesperson for Tantra.

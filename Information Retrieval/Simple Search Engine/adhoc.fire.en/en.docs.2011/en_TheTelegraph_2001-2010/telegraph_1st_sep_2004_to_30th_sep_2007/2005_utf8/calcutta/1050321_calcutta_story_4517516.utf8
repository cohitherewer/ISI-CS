 Shot girl, mother battle to breathe

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Hours after two extortionists shot at and severely wounded 11-year-old Suvasree (Mou) Pal and left her mother Suparna with a shattered shoulder, doctors at SSKM Hospital said on Sunday that the two were still in a critical condition. 

 While Suparna is struggling to breathe, her daughter is trying to recover from the major surgery carried out on Saturday night to remove a bullet from her neck. The bullet had ricocheted off Suparna?s shoulder to hit Suvasree.

 The CPM on Sunday observed a 12-hour bandh at Rabindranagar, near Thakurpukur, where the Pals live. 

 The local CPM leadership was up in arms, accusing the police of being in cahoots with local ganglords. 

 Later in the evening, CPM activists gheraoed Rabindranagar police station. 

 On Saturday, extortionists Tapan and Bishu Adhikary had opened fire on 35-year-old Suparna Pal and her daughter Suvasree after they refused to pay up, in spite of repeated threats and demands. 

 The Pal home at Uttarpara, in Rabindranagar, commands a clear view of their neighbour?s house, where Suparna and Suvasree could see the two extortionists trying to force businessman Krishna Shaw to cough up cash.

 The Shaws refused to oblige. Then, the Adhikary brothers forced their way into the Pal residence and demanded Rs 50,000 from them. Reason: the Pals had built a house and shifted into the area in 2001. 

 The daylong bandh and the agitation outside the police station was not reassuring enough for Krishna Shaw, who locked up his two-storeyed house and left with his family.

 Sujit Pal, Suparna?s husband, was terrified. An executive with a private company, he wondered how it was possible for him to pay that much. 

 ?It is beyond my capacity to shell out Rs 50,000 right away. I had taken a loan to build this house, and if they return, to demand money, I wouldn?t know what to do,? Pal said. 

 Local CPM legislator Mursalen Mollah will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to voice the concerns of the people in his Assembly segment, and how they had lost faith in the police. 

 This is the first time in recent history that a CPM legislator from the southern fringes of the city will meet the chief minister to speak out against an alleged criminal-police nexus. The attack on the Pals, incidentally, is the fifth such incident of its kind in the past few months. 

 ?We had expected that after the Mahestala police station area was split and two new police stations were set up, crime would reduce considerably. But, unfortunately, it has shot up, thanks to corruption in the police,? said Arup Dasgupta, Garden Reach CPM zonal committee member. 

 Police admit the Adhikary brothers had been operating their extortion racket in and around Thakurpukur for some time. ?Few would complain. We have launched a combing operation to hunt for them,? said H.K. Kusumakar, additional police superintendent of South 24-Parganas.

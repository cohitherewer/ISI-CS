 Green glory in stone story 

 The bigger the better holds true when it comes to the popularity of precious and 

 semi-precious gems, finds out Himika Chaudhuri

 Diamonds may still hold the title of being a girl?s best friend, but may soon lose out if the popularity coloured stones are gaining is anything to go by. 

 Be it semi-precious or precious, coloured stones are a rage among women of all age groups. ?Coloured stones are hot favourites now, with everyone from a 20-year-old bride to her 60-year-old grandmom donning them in colours to match her attire,? says Mahesh Punjabi of Heritage, a 10-year-old store in New Market that deals in silver and coloured stone jewellery. 

 Agrees Varda Goenka of Diagold, which has come out with a whole range of ornaments made with these stones, comprising pendants, chandelier earrings and cocktail rings. ?Coloured stones have been popular in the West for quite some time and the trend is now catching on in India in a big way. Rubies, corals, rock crystals, tourmaline ? the choice is endless,? feels Goenka. 

 Colour code

 The grass might usually be greener on the other side, but this time, you have to make sure that your neckpiece is the greenest of them all. Indeed, green is the colour of the season in this segment, with emeralds, turquoise and peridot ruling.

 Climbing close to the rub of the green are hues like topaz yellow and sapphire blue. 

 Design diary

 The bigger the better is the mantra in the design department. Chunky stone pieces lend a rich and ornate look that?s just perfect for weddings and other formal occasions.

 ?We have started using coloured beads of semi-precious stones instead of chains to go with the pendants. This gives a heavier look to the pieces and adds value,? says Pratap Lodha of Jewel Co, a store housed inside HHI that deals exclusively in coloured stone jewellery.

 so in vogue is the use of small diamonds along with coloured stones. ?While diamonds lend shine and class, the stones provide the dressy and opulent look,? feels Naresh Kripalani of Kripalini amp; Sons. Another hit combination is that of kundan and coloured stones.

 The designs in stone jewellery range from the traditional to the contemporary. From honeycomb patterns to abstract motifs, the choice is wide.

 Price point

 The price of a piece depends on the quality and number of stones. You can easily pick up a pair of precious stone earrings for Rs 15,000 and the count goes up to even a lakh depending on the quality of stones and the craftsmanship. 

 ?Precious coloured stones offer real value for money. One can buy a heavy set for Rs 50,000, which in the case of diamonds is unimaginable,? says Lodha.

 Safe buys

 The precious variety ? rubies, emeralds, sapphire, topaz, among others ? is the safest bet considering the resale value. Semi-precious stones, on the other hand, don?t fetch much on resale and are purely for fashion purposes. The demand for some semi-precious stones like peridot, garnet and tourmaline, however, is on the rise as these fetch decent resale prices.

 Since it?s not possible to judge the quality of the stones by mere visual inspection, one should opt for stores of repute and insist on authenticity certificates. ?A certificate stating the type of stone and its karat should be sought. This makes it easier to sell the piece later,? adds Lodha.

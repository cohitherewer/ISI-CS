The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To Hindi Sir, with love

 A STAFF REPORTER

 To protest the transfer of a teacher, some 300 students of the Hindi department of Presidency College on Monday blocked busy College Street and threatened to launch a hunger strike if the transfer order was not withdrawn. 

 According to the agitated students, Sheonath Pandey, a reader of the department, received a letter on Friday transferring him to Hooghly?s Mohsin College.

 ?First of all, there is no other teacher around who can teach better than him, and there is no reason why we should be deprived of his teaching. Second, Subrata Lahiri, the only remaining reader after the transfer, is scheduled to retire within the next few months. After that, the department will have no reader,? said Jatin Kumar Sukla, a third-year BA student of the Hindi department.

 The agitated students set up a roadblock in front of the college for 15 minutes. 

 ?We are boycotting all classes, undergraduate and postgraduate, indefinitely from Saturday,? said another student. ?We are with them. The transfer won?t do anyone any good. Sending a teacher of Sir?s (Pandey?s) efficiency to Hooghly has no justification,? said Chandrabhan Singh, assistant general secretary of the college?s students? union. 

 ?About five of us will hold a fast at the main entrance of the college from tomorrow and will continue to do so if the transfer order is not withdrawn,? said Sukla.

 The students have met the principal of the college and submitted a deputation.

 ?We have forwarded the demand of the students to the higher authorities,? said Mamata Ray, principal of the college.

 However, another college officer said the principal has little to do with this, as this is a routine transfer. He said there is a great demand for a good Hindi teacher at Mohsin College and Pandey?s transfer was a government decision to meet the demand.

 Three new teachers were appointed on the same day that Pandey received the transfer order, the college officer said.

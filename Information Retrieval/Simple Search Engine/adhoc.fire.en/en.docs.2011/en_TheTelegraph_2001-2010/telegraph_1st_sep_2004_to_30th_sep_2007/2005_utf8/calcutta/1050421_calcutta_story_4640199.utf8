The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Disputed rent hiked by court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI

 ?A meagre rent of Rs 837.87 per month? for a 5,678-sq-ft central Calcutta property was hiked to Rs 85,170 by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

 The court said that the property under litigation, near Raj Bhavan, is situated in prime location. The tenant, against whom eviction proceedings are on in Calcutta High Court, has been paying just Rs 837.87 per month, the same rate as was being paid when the tenancy was created in 1939.

 Courts should fix a ?fair? rent for properties where eviction proceedings were pending, stressed the division bench, comprising Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur.

 The bench pointed out that the respondent landlords were paying a property tax of Rs 2.32 lakh per annum to the local authority, while the appellant tenant has only been paying Rs 837.87.

 The tenants have sub-let a portion of the premises, where the sub-tenants have also been carrying on business.

 The apex court also pointed out that on the same property, one tenant occupying a floor has been paying Rs 32 per sq ft, while another was paying Rs 25 per sq ft.

 The bench ordered the respondent tenant to pay Rs 15 per sq ft till the eviction proceedings were over, and said that courts should fix ?reasonable rent? from time to time when eviction proceedings are pending.

 The court said from the date of order of eviction by a court, while an appeal is pending, the court hearing the case should fix a rent which the landlord would have been able to get if the premises was vacated by the current tenant.

 In this case, Calcutta High Court has already ordered the eviction of the tenant and an appeal is pending.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pay up or face the music

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Planning to attend a do and rock to pulsating beats? Check out whether the organisers have a licence to play music.

 A task force from Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL) has prepared a long list of defaulters, who are playing music in public without paying the mandatory licence fee, and will soon start proceedings against them.

 ?We have identified about 20 defaulters in the city and another 80 in the rest of the state,? said Sowmya Chowdhury, PPL national manager. ?They include big hotels running discotheques, malls and clubs. All of them are offenders.?

 Notices will be served on the offenders next week, following which the organisation will move court and conduct raids. If convicted, the offender can be jailed for three years and may also have to pay a penalty up to Rs 2 lakh.

 Acting on behalf of 100-plus music companies in the country and in tandem with the human resources development ministry, PPL administers broadcasting, telecasting and public performance rights related to music. 

 A hotel or a club organising an event and willing to play music is required to obtain a licence from PPL. The fee ranges from a few hundred to several thousand rupees (see box), depending on the programme, capacity and footfall.

 The Copyright Act, 1957, bans communication of music to the public in any form ? acoustic or visual ? or format without a licence. 

 But no one bothered to pay up, till PPL was formed by the Rs 600-crore music industry with the explicit purpose of cracking down on errant club and hotel-owners.

 Quite a few effective raids were conducted in the past year and the special task force went to Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Pune, Chandigarh, Jaipur and Lucknow.

 In Calcutta, where around 500 musical events are organised in a year, some big hotels regularly pay licence fees to PPL, but an overwhelming number, around 60 per cent, prefer not to shell out a paisa. 

 ?A few have paid once, but are now asking for time to pay the subsequent instalments. Others claim they are unable to pay. We would like to tell them that there is no way out. They have to pay up now or pay a heavy price later,? asserted Supriyo Mukherjee, PPL?s business development manager.

 In the past few raids, the task force realised around Rs 20 crore, raising the organisation?s profits by almost 70 per cent. ?There is a lot of awareness now, but not so in the city. So, we have come here from Mumbai to tell offenders that we mean business,? Mukherjee signed off.

 Doctors to dengue rescue

 - Mayor rues lack of support from NGOs in vector war

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has come to the rescue of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), volunteering to run the civic health clinics on a regular basis in the bid to fight the dengue epidemic.

 Most health clinics remain empty, particularly after hours, as the CMC does not have enough manpower to run these after office hours.

 The fact that the CMC has not received help from any NGO has made things even more difficult. 

 ?The saddest part of the whole exercise has been the absence of any help from NGOs. There are so many of these in Calcutta, but not a single one offered to work with us in these difficult times,? rued mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. ?Voluntary organisations could have a major role to play if they want to help eradicate the disease,? the mayor added.

 About 300-plus NGOs operate in the city, many in the field of healthcare.

 ?They have so much courage at other times, but it seems they are afraid of getting bitten by mosquitoes,? quipped Pradip Ghosh, Congress leader of the opposition in the CMC. ?Actually, dengue control will not give them any publicity. This is, perhaps, the reason why they chose to stay away,? Ghosh added.

 On Wednesday, 136 more dengue cases were confirmed, with the city alone accounting for 79 of them. 

 ?The death toll has remained at 19, but that is hardly any solace for us. We need help from every corner to check the disease,? said a senior health department officer.

 Civic officers explained that NGOs could have helped the CMC with awareness campaigns and larvae control; organising sensitisation programmes and educating the poor about ways of combating dengue; facilitating serological tests in various labs, especially when most private hospitals were asking for exorbitant fees for dengue-antigen tests.

 Apart from one private hospital, which came forward in borough 10, not a single private hospital has offered help, either.

 The mayor welcomed the IMA?s offer. ?The CMC told us that they would need about 50 doctors to run the clinics properly. Once we receive a formal proposal we should get cracking from Monday,? Asim Sarkar, secretary of the Journal of the IMA.

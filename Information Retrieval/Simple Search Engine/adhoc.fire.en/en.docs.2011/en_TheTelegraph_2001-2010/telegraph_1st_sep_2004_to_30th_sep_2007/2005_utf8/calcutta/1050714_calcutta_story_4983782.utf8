 During campaigning, all candidates 

 in civic elections make tall promises of improving services 

 in their wards (Good deeds make happy wards, June 18). However, 

 at the end of their five-year terms, the wards are developed 

 in varying degrees. That is partly because councillors show 

 different degrees of enthusiasm in their work. 

 The candidates selected by the parties should ideally be active social workers and must not be employed full-time elsewhere. 

 For best results, councillors need to devote the majority of their time in pursuing developmental projects. It might not be possible for a busy doctor or a lawyer to regularly meet residents of their wards and hear their grievances. 

 Nowadays, civic bodies receive funds from international bodies like the Asian Development Bank to pursue developmental projects. The money should be distributed among the wards during the civic budget. 

 The problems of the wards which require immediate attention should be given top priority. The councillors, with the help of the ward committees, should monitor the progress of developmental work in their wards. 

 The councillors should also be made to submit a report in board meetings on the work done. They should be requested to expedite progress, where necessary. This will help ensure equitable development. 

 The whole-hearted involvement of councillors in the development work in wards will ensure better civic services. Better services, in turn, will prompt tax-payers to pay their dues on time. 

 Can we expect that the new CMC board will boost development in all wards? We want to see happy wards in all parts of the city. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 The fate suffered by Samarendra Nath Saha Mondal in a bid to do his work diligently was shocking (Truck mows down sergeant, June 15). I am sure the state administration and members of the police force would duly sing Saha Mondal?s praise in condolence meetings and consolation messages will pour in from all quarters. But within days, the family and its sorrows will be forgotten. The kin will be made to run from pillar to post for dues and face a difficult future. 

 What prompted the driver to run over the sergeant needs to be investigated. Was it the first time he was taking a shortcut through the ?no-entry? zone? In Calcutta, the men behind the wheels hate traffic sergeants who cause harassment while violating rules themselves on their two-wheelers. Perhaps Saha Mondal paid with his life for the highhandedness and corruption of his ilk. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan. 

 I hope Saha Mondal?s colleagues 

 would now think twice about accepting bribes from truck 

 drivers.

 Apropos the report ?Ouster gun trained on cops?, June 15, police brazenly accept bribe from hawkers all over the city. Removal of hawkers requires a comprehensive plan. While the common people will gain a lot if encroachments are removed from the roads, those with vested interests will not let that happen easily. Unless the nexus amongst police, politicians and hawkers are broken, the condition of the roads won?t improve.

 On what logical or rational ground did the University of Calcutta seek to bypass its own rules to declare a student unsuccessful (Failed student passed by court, June 23)? If the university must change its examination norms, it must do so after serving a notice. By doing otherwise, the careers of students are jeopardised. The university brass should sort out internal problems, if required at the expense of the institution?s 150-year celebrations. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri, 

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane. 

 The schools are responsible for the high percentage of failure in English in the Higher Secondary examinations (English cry in HS helpline, June 22). Usually, teachers employed to teach Madhyamik students are made to teach the Higher Secondary English classes. Underqualified teachers are also taken on board due to political considerations. An inquiry by the Higher Secondary council will reveal the dirty truth. 

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park. 

 Another election and another black day in the history of democracy in West Bengal (Muscle flex for votes, June 20). One can only wonder when the residents of the state will be freed of the Marxist goons and be able to cast their votes freely. It will be better to stop the farcical elections and allow the Left to rule for as long as they want! At least, there will be a lot less violence and a lot of money will also be saved. 

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street.

 I never had faith in Calcutta Municipal Corporation (Inquiry ordered into civic tax scam, June 16). Tax payments should not be accepted in cash unless records of the transaction can be kept secure. In case of payments by cheque, a record of the transactions is at least retained by banks. 

 S.S. Almal,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 

 The death of a well-known make-up artiste once again proves that careless use of cell phones can prove fatal (Walk, drive, don?t use cellphone, June 16). Laws have been formulated against improper use of mobiles, but they have not been implemented. However, it must be admitted that without self-realisation, it will be impossible to curb accidents caused by cell-phone use. 

 Payel Bhattacharyya, 

 Diamond Harbour Road. 

 The fact that casual use of cell 

 phone on the roads can prove dangerous not only for others, 

 but also for the user has been highlighted by the tragic 

 death of ace make-up artiste Prabir Kumar De. The ban on 

 use of cell phones behind the wheels or while driving a 

 motorcycle has proved to be useless. Not only are motorists 

 seen talking on cell phones while driving, many are not 

 even aware that they are flouting a ban. 

 Nidhi Poddar, 

 Salt Lake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of rites amp; rituals, finery amp; feasts

 We came to Calcutta in 1948. Before the Partition, we lived in Faridpur. In our village, Durga puja was celebrated in two places. These used to be organised by two branches of our family after it split.

 The village had a permanent aatchala that had a tin roof held aloft by saal wood columns. It is clear as a picture in my mind and I can make a sketch of it. The artisan or kumor arrived long before the pujas. The aatchala was quite bare.

 We are Vedic Brahmins and all the rites and rituals were strictly observed. Our relatives from Calcutta would arrive. They were city slickers and brought gifts for us. Feasting was one of the most important aspects of festivity. Goats used to be sacrificed. Before we were born, buffaloes were sacrificed. Our neighbours and tenants were all welcome to the feasts.

 Plays used to be staged. The immersion was a big thing. All images were immersed in the Gharghara river. On Bijoya Dashami, the children would visit all the households of the neighbourhood and each would be handed nadus made of coconut and jaggery.

 When we moved to Calcutta, Durga puja used to be a low-key affair. I was in Class VI and I used to visit pujas with my brother. We have lived in Dhakuria from 1951 and we would visit Ballygunge and Bhowanipore. Nowadays, one cannot reach the Gariahat crossing. I prefer to drive down to Salt Lake instead. There was no razzle-dazzle, no competition nor the crush of today. The Durga images were of two types ? as a single unit with a chalchitra that held the family together; or as individual entities.

 The para used to dominate the festival and women and children had a busy time. This was when beautiful Bengali songs were heard at para soirees. I enjoyed myself.

 In Calcutta, the first private puja I had ever been to was at the ancestral home of the lawyer Anindya Mitra, who now lives in Ballygunge. It was a typical house in north Calcutta, with a narrow staircase. The courtyard was hemmed in by verandahs, unlike our aatchala, open from all sides.

 At the north Calcutta puja in the zamindar family, only about 50 people of the household participated, whereas back home at least 200 to 300 feasted together.

 A couple of years ago I visited many pandals as a judge. Traditional images are making a comeback. Some ?themes? are unacceptable but many are quite artistic.

 I love to see the Durga images in their formative stage at Kumartuli. They look wonderful when the first dabs of paint have been applied. I have exposed two rolls of films at Kumartuli and the photographs taken from various angles look very interesting. It is an inspiring sight.

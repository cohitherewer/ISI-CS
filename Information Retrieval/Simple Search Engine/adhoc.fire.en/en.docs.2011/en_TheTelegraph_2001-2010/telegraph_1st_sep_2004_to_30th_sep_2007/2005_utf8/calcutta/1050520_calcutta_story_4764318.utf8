The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A debut called Godot

 Samuel Beckett was born on Good Friday, 13 April, 1906. While several foreign cultural agencies are planning big-time celebrations of his centenary next year, the festivities have already begun as far as Calcutta is concerned. The first of two local English productions of his masterpiece, Waiting for Godot, premiered at Gyan Manch on the popularly inauspicious day of Friday the 13th. Creative Commune certainly displayed courage to choose such a date for their debut as a group, and it must be said that by and large they succeeded. 

 For one thing, they remain quite faithful to the text. But more theatrically, every version of Godot must have a performance motif, and in this one the director, Abhijay Gupta, treats the relationship of Didi and Gogo ultra-physically. Here the two (young) friends shove each other around, sometimes violently, falling down repeatedly; they grapple and entangle themselves, almost looking like one four-legged animal.

 This concept visualises them as a pair who can neither live with, nor without, each other ? a not necessarily positive idea of friendship that Beckett may have got from Proust. In his director?s note, Gupta boldly states that ?Beckett gives the actors problems of performance, not of interpretation.? Given their inexperience, Indranil Chowdhury as Gogo and Gupta as Didi overcome these problems fluidly 

 When a woman enters as Lucky, followed by the slavedriver Pozzo, we react with renewed pleasure to the novel possibility of a gendered reading of the play ? of women as the oppressed. This gains an added dimension when we discover in the cast list the name ?Pozzo/Godot?, thereby specifying Godot as oppressor, though this also robs Godot of his otherwise richly ambiguous identity. Our interest in the subplot ends here because Simon Jennings?s voice as Pozzo/Godot too often fades into unintelligibility, while Nandini Das?s dog-like behaviour suggests an incomplete comprehension of Lucky?s character. Her re-entry in the part of the Boy at the end of each Act destroys whatever credibility her Lucky may have had, for on no account should the same actor conflate these two into one role.

 Gupta also ignored Beckett?s important stipulation that the tree ?has four or five leaves? in Act 2. Other than that, his painting of the tree on a transparent cellophane drop functioned well. Perhaps the best aspect of his artwork was the innovative ticket designs: four kinds and colours of tickets to match the four characters, each with one of their faces. You almost felt like buying all four to get the full set. Unlike his design, though, his soundscape of material from classical piano to Pink Floyd was terrible because of the cliched selections and the fact that Beckett does not require music for ambient effect.

 And why, after emphasising performance so much in the brochure, does he regressively print a lengthy literary-critical essay that constantly harps on the act of readingGodot?

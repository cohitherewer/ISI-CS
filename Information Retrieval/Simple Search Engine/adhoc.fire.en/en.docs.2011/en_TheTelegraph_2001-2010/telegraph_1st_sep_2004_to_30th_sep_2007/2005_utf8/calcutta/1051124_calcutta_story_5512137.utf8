 Sport is clearly the flavour of the season and hospitality addresses around town are all geared up to play ball.

 From football (AC Milan U-18) to cricket (Team India) and then back to football (Bayern Munich), it?s an all-action week ahead, from Eden Gardens to Salt Lake stadium, from night clubs to restaurants.

 It all kicked-off with the AC Milan junior team checking into Hyatt Regency on Wednesday afternoon, here to play Bengal U-21 as part of Festa Italiana. Before you could say Maldini (missing, of course), the boys in red-and-black had grabbed a bite and rushed to the adjacent stadium.

 Predictably, pasta was the pop pick for the young men from Milan. ?The food laid out was rich in protein and carbohydrates. They all attacked the pasta, but skipped the desserts,? said executive chef David Cananzi.

 The post-match pitch was being prepared at B.E.D. ?Both our kitchens are ready to serve Indian and Oriental, depending on what the Milan team wants,? said Hem Dhillon, spokesperson for the night club.

 Football following is one thing, but cricket craze quite another in Calcutta today. 

 Sourav or no Sourav, the arrival of teams India and South Africa late on Wednesday created a buzz that stretched from the airport to Alipore.

 ?Around 60 rooms have been booked for the teams and the support staff. All our restaurants will serve almost everything,? said a spokesperson for Taj Bengal.

 Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) will have a high-profile guest checking in next Tuesday ? Bayern Munich, to play the IFA Shield. 

 ?Till now, seven single and eight double rooms have been booked. We have been instructed to provide a high-protein diet with Continental and non-spicy Indian food,? was the word from the hotel that has tied up with the Indian Football Association.

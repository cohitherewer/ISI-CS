 Mayor cries war, team passes buck

 - PLASTIC PERIL FOR CITY?S SEWERS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya has declared a war on plastic waste, but his civic body colleagues have no idea how the war will be won. For the moment, the mayoral council members are busy passing the buck.

 During a meeting last week with the council members, Bhattacharya asserted that he did not want the city to be littered with plastic waste. ?I don?t know how and who will enforce the ban: I will simply not allow discarded plastic bags to choke my drains and sewer lines,? he had thundered.

 The civic department heads had greeted the mayor?s diktat with desk-thumping, but are now reluctant to take up the responsibility of plastic waste disposal. Mayoral council member for solid waste management Chandana Ghosh Dastidar and mayoral council member for drainage and sewerage Farzana Chaudhury both made it clear to Bhattacharya on Monday that the management of plastic waste was not their headache.

 The mayor decided to act against plastic waste after he was shown the mounds of bags and other plastic products that had blocked the drains and sewerage lines during the weeklong rain post-Puja. The waste was kept at Palmer Bazar drainage pumping station.

 A delegation from Indian Plastic Federation (IPF), led by K.K. Seksaria, called on the mayor on Monday. The members pointed out that the civic body was struggling to deal with plastic waste while the IPF was failing to get enough of it for reprocessing.?We are ready to purchase plastic trash from the civic authorities and the NGOs,? said A.R. Lohia of the IPF.

 According to Seksaria, over 60,000 tonnes of plastic waste are reprocessed every month in 300 units in the city. The figure is less than 10 per cent of the demand and the federation members are forced to buy plastic trash from Bihar and Jharkhand.

 They called for stringent regulation against generation of plastic garbage and ban on the use of plastic bags of low thickness.

 Down memory lane 

Chit Chat

 The quaint village that attracted Ray is turning into a concrete jungle. Subhajoy Roy revisits the hamlet where Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne was shot

 Then: A bamboo thicket spread over a large area. Wherever you looked, you saw only green. Some distance away were the homes of refugees from East Bengal, who had tried their luck everywhere before settling down here. No cars were to be found in this village far from Calcutta. Carts were the only mode of transport. 

 Now: Trees line the sides of tarred streets, which are not without potholes. Autorickshaws and private cars blow horns to make way through the strolling crowd. Grocery shops border the lanes, barely a few feet from each other. Apartments have started coming up everywhere. Their walls covered with graffiti ? ?Vote for...? ? confirm that this, indeed, is an added area of Calcutta, a city fighting hard for its economic resurgence. The old buildings in between bear the ravages of time. 

 Welcome to a shining Goshtotala. At least the demeanour implies such. A village where Satyajit Ray shot for his films Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne and Teen Kanya in the late 60s is now a favoured spot for real estate agents and those who want want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city centre.

 ?Goshtotala is one of the most poshest areas in the locality,? says Tapen Chatterjee, who played Goopi in all three films of the trilogy and a local resident. 

 It was in late 1968 or early 1969 that Ray came here to shoot for the first film of the Goopi-Bagha trilogy (the last one was directed by son Sandip). The portion of the film when a tiger roams free in the jungle was shot right here. ?It was not a trained tiger like the one in Hirak Rajar Deshe. The cage was so large that it was brought in a jeep, tied up,? adds Chatterjee.

 ?A circus company brought the tiger to the spot. Manikda wanted it to be set free. The first thing it did after being let out was run towards us. There were about a thousand people watching the shooting. In the blink of an eye, everybody deserted the place. We stood still, not knowing what to do. Luckily, it had to stop at a point as a rope was tied around its neck,? he recalls, laughing. 

 Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne is not the only film shot here. The others include Teen Kanya by Ray, says Sushil Ghosh, one of the former landlords of this area. In fact, it was in his house where parts of Teen Kanya were shot ? when Soumitra Chatterjee enters a room to see Aparna Sen for an arranged marriage and when Aparna calls out at a squirrel from a window. 

 But the charm of the bamboo thicket is entirely lost now. The gradual influx of population to this suburban area has made Pyarabagan ? the place where the thicket was located ? a thickly populated area. Landlords have sold their land. 

 New apartments have come up. And whatever is left is ready to be sold to turn this area into a concrete jungle.

 ?It?s not possible to preserve such a large area simply because portions of a few famous films were shot here. I don?t blame anyone,? adds Chatterjee. But very few local residents know about film-making fame of the area.

 ?Only a few from our generation know about it,? laments Suryo Subho Bandopadhay, a college student. 

 So the cherished thicket of Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne could soon be history, if at least a few cottahs of the remaining land is not preserved.

 Those who want to relive the beauty of the bansjhar must soon pay a visit to Garia Goshtotala, before it disappears forever.0

 A Look at the World This Week

 CHECK IT OUT Laws of physics

 Is physics a tough nut to crack? Yes to some, no to others. Commemorating the year 2005 as the World Year of Physics, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum has taken a novel step to explore some interesting aspects of physics with the help of a number of fascinating demonstrations for students from Class IX to XII. 

 The demos will be held from 11 am to noon daily, between July 11 and 30, on important topics dealt with in schools, like properties of liquid and air, light, magnetism, sound, electromagnetic induction and mechanics. 

 Some of the more interesting experiments to be tried out include those on Doppler Effect, rising electric arc, refraction and total internal reflection of laser beam and sympathetic swing. The students shall also take part in the experiments and learn science by doing. Schools can book seats in advance for the demonstrations (contact 22812654 for registration). There is no entry fee for these demonstrations for organised school students.

 Kiddie club

 The Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) International, a US-based organisation operating in 15 countries, launched its first montessori in Calcutta on Monday. 

 ?Pre-school is a term that means before school. The aim of a pre-school is not just to prepare a child between the age group of 1.5 years to five years, before they step into a real school. 

 The training offered by us aims at developing a child?s inquisitive mind through concept clarity and providing children plenty of hands-on opportunities to explore,? Bandana Das of the organisation said. 

 The TEFL International runs nearly 1,000 schools across the world and aims to open more branches in Calcutta as well as in the districts in Bengal, Das added. 

 Teaching here consists of two levels ? toddler and pre-school. The medium of communication in the school is English and the pre-school level curriculum covers sensorial activities, arithmetic, language, art and craft, dance and music activities. 

 For the little ones a little behind, TEFL runs various programmes through their Kids? Club and Kids English Language Programme.

 Fact finder

 Did you know that William Shakespeare caused a ecological problem for America, albeit indirectly? The 16th century dramatist and poets had numerous admirers all over the world. At the end of the 19th century, one of them decided to introduce in America every kind of bird mentioned in his plays. Among these, he brought 40 pairs of starlings, the first ever to reach America. Starlings soon became a national pest. They had no natural enemies in America and began to breed so fast that they destroyed the nests and broods of other birds. They also ruined crops. People are still trying to get rid of them. A similar problem arose when immigrants introduced rabbits into Australia. The continent did not have many carnivores that could eat the rabbits, and the animals multiplied very fast causing an imbalance in the natural order. It is dangerous to introduce new species of animals, birds or plants in places where they do not naturally exist. Such an action can destroy the delicate balance of nature.

 The Diary

 Concert with a cause

 Around three billion people watched Live 8 on Saturday, July 2. Bono effectively worked up the crowd while half a world away people were cheering Bjork with vigour. Bill Gates made an appearance, Nelson Mandela?s sentiments stole the show. Held worldwide in 

 nine different countries, little or no ripples of the ?greatest concert on earth? were felt in Calcutta, as 150 bands and solo artists performed. Held to raise consciousness about poverty in Africa, the show did what it aimed to, with heartbreaking scenes of children suffering from malnutrition and pleas for 100 per cent debt relief. It touched hearts. Organisers Bono, Richard Curtis, Sir Bob Geldof, Harvey Goldsmith, John Kennedy, Midge Ure and many others strongly expressed their views and worries, and celebrity presenters like Will Smith, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman and Chris Tucker fed the audience with facts and figures like the number of Africans dying every year from curable diseases (50,000) and the fatality rate of children due to hunger (one every three seconds). From a music lover?s point of view, the show was too good to be true. Elton John belting out blues numbers, modern rock bands like Audioslave, Green Day, Keane and Maroon 5, and classics like The Who, Motley Crue et al, playing on. The most awe-inspiring event was a toss-up between Paul McCartney with U2 and Pink Floyd with both Gilmore and Roger Waters. Even Coldplay tied up with The Verve, which was as good as REM. The concert with a cause lived up to the great expectations.

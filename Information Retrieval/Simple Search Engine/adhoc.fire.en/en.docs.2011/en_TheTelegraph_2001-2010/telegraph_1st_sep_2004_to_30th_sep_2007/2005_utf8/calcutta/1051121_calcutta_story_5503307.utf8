 The return of reality rigour 

Screen On amp; Off

Who will be the next Abhijeet Sawant? Idol one, aspirants 

all. Metro lists what to expect from Season Two of Sonys TRP-topper

 Farah Khan, Sonu Nigam, Abhijeet Sawant and Anu 

Malik at the Mumbai launch of Indian Idol 2

A signboard painter from Pathankot. A Telugu movie 

actress from Hyderabad. A radio jockey from Mumbai. A couple with a two-year-old 

child from Bangalore. A milkman from Gujarat who borrowed money from his friends 

to come to Mumbai. An airhostess who gave up her flying career for a song. A daily-wage 

worker from a village near Jalgaon who sold his utensils to come to Mumbai. A 

physically challenged aspirant who lost all he had in a terrorist attack in Kashmir.

The stories are straight out of a Bollywood poitboiler, 

the only difference being they are the reality bytes Indian Idol hopes 

will kickstart its second season.

From its launch episode on Monday at 8.30 pm right 

till episode Number Four, get an insight into the sheer deewanapan with 

which enthusiasts from all parts of the country turned up for the auditions in 

Mumbai, Lucknow, Delhi and Calcutta in October and November.

After the struggle, the sunshine. Episode 5 onwards, 

it?s all about finding the country?s next Idol post-Abhijeet Sawant, who sang 

back-to-back chartbusters at the Mumbai launch of the talent hunt in Taj Mahal 

hotel. ?I had never dreamt of becoming so famous or becoming a professional singer 

but Indian Idol has made it possible,? said Sawant, whose debut album has 

sold over 7,50,000 copies till date, making it the fastest-selling album in the 

past five years of the Indian music industry.

Riding the successful launch season, Indian Idol 

received over one million calls for registration. Of those, more than 30,000 

auditioned in the four cities with the judges Anu Malik, Farah Khan and Sonu Nigam 

handpicking the 172 finalists. 

The judges were, as always, divided in their opinion. 

While Anu liked Calcutta, Sonu preferred Lucknow. ?Since Lucknow was a new venue, 

I just loved the talent brewing there and most of them came from far-off places,? 

said the talented singer. ?I didn?t like Mumbai at all. They seemed careless and 

not up to the challenge while Calcutta was very emotional.? 

For the host TV channel, Sony Entertainment Television, 

Indian Idol is one show it can now seriously bank on, season after season. 

?The international trend is that the second season is always bigger than the first 

and we are hoping that happens in India, too,? said Tarun Katial, executive vice-president 

and business head of the channel, which received 55 million viewers and 55 million 

votes in the format?s first outing. 

A lot is at stake, of course. Apart from the Rs 1 

crore contract with Sony, the next Indian Idol will win a car and, more importantly, 

instant stardom. 

The 65 Idol series in 30 territories have not 

only raked in a record 1.5 billion votes, but also given birth to 50 solo artistes 

worldwide.

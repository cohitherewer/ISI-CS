Cropped cuts for cool code

FROM PLAIN COTTONS TO JAZZY DENIMS ? CAPRIS 

FOR ALL OCCASIONS ARE RULING THE RACKS. HIMIKA CHAUDHURI CHECKS OUT THE 

TRENDS DICTATING THIS SUMMER DRESSING ESSENTIAL

The cool capris that you fish out of your wardrobe 

before summer sets in every year need to be sent back into the old clothes racks 

this time. The reason: the riot of new styles in the three-quarter lowers section 

will force you to pick up a new pair this season. The choice ranges from the plain 

cottons for Friday dressing in office to the heavily-embellished party variety. 

A good alternative to your pair of jeans during the 

sweltering months, these are priced between Rs 499 and Rs 799. Goodlife 

checks out the styles in vogue.

Fabric fiesta

Nothing can beat pure cottons when it comes to summer 

dressing and so is the first fabric choice for capris. From happy multi-coloured 

stripes to milk whites and bright pinks, you are sure to lay your hands on at 

least half-a-dozen different looks in cotton itself.

Shopper?s Stop has a range of interesting linen capris 

in earthy hues, with pleats in front that give these a feminine touch. Close on 

the heels in popularity terms come the denim capris that are a must pick for the 

party animal in you. Adorned with lots of shimmer and sparkle, these promise to 

jazz up the weekend nights at your favourite disco. The classic fabric is back 

this season, mainly in dark shades of blue. 

Ones with bright prints on synthetic fabric are the 

perfect pick for a seaside holiday, while dual-coloured capris in body-hugging 

material are just right for your morning jog.

A thick variety of cotton has been used in a line 

of cargo-style capris on sale at Westside. To reinvent your sense of Friday dressing, 

you can go for the creaseless synthetic material available in formal colours like 

navy blue, black, cream and beige.

?Capris always sell well during summer and the trend 

holds true this time too. This year, denim capris are a rage, followed by cottons,? 

says a spokesperson for Shopper?s Stop in City Centre.

Style check

Going by the style file this season, perfect fit is 

a hit and anti-fit or loose-fit capris are hard to find. So, these are ideal for 

showing off your slim contours. But for those not keen on shedding kilos to flaunt 

a pair of capri, the only option is the loose cargo-style variety with large pockets, 

available in army greens and blacks.

The embellishments this season range from metal buttons 

and buckles to crochet frills and patchwork. In fact, crochet work adds an extra 

bit of style to the capris this year, making them look dressier. These are being 

used in the form of multi-coloured flowers set on white capris or colourful frills 

attached to denim ones. 

Hot hues

Whites rule the roost in summer fashion and capris 

are no exception. Crispy white cotton varieties of the garment are no doubt the 

fastest moving in most stores. However, louder shades like indigo and bright pinks 

are also taking up rack space this year. 

Meant primarily for the younger brigade, these vibrant 

hues can be teamed with white tops or spaghettis in bold colours. Synthetic capris 

in subtle shades of creams and beiges are a good bet for formal dos.

Fold-up fashion

If the actual capri doesn?t appeal to your sense of 

style, then hop over to the Levis outlets in the city for some innovation on this 

garment.

A pair of straight-leg denims folded up till the calf 

to offer the capri-look is an interesting innovation that?s already gaining popularity 

with fashionistas. In fact, it?s quite a rage among celebrities as well and so 

you could actually be competing with Malaika Arora who was sporting a dark blue 

pair on her breeze through town on Saturday night. 

Shop stops

Pantaloons, Westside and Shopper?s Stop should more 

than serve the purpose if you?re out hunting a pair of cool capris. At these destinations 

you will get something for all occasions and budgets. For the designer touch,

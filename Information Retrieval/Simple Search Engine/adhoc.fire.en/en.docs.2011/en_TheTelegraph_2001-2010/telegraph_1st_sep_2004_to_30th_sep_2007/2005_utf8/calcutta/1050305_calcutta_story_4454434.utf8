The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blows for him, brutality for her

 - Witness recounts policemen in uniform beating up Gambhir wife, aunt

 JULIUS GOMES

 ?The policemen were completely in the wrong. They stepped far beyond their limits. And the way they manhandled the women, no male police officer is allowed that... Akshay Gambhir certainly needs the support of citizens.?

 Having read about how Gambhir had been beaten up by a gang of cops, a witness to Tuesday?s incident got in touch with Metro on Friday to back the victim?s word.

 Swapan K. Basu, an exporter and a resident of Gurusaday Dutta Road, was on his way to his Mayfair Road office with wife Rama and their daughter when the incident occurred. ?I was also stuck in traffic at the intersection, a little behind the Maruti Zen, and I saw the Wagon R make a U-turn and stop in front of it,? Basu recounted.

 Not too much was visible from inside the car, with the windows rolled up, but Basu saw enough. He was there when Gambhir arrived on the spot and the cops started roughing him up. ?There were at least three or four sergeants, in uniform. There were two or three police motorcycles. There was also a constable with a lathi, a somewhat elderly man who is often posted there,? said Basu.

 Having surrounded Gambhir, the men in uniform were raining blows on him. They did not stop even when his ?elderly? aunt tried to protect him. 

 When Gambhir?s wife tried to step in, one of the sergeants allegedly elbowed her aside roughly. She fell, just a few feet from Basu?s car. ?There was no respect for the two ladies there, they were handled very roughly. The young lady cried out in pain,? recounted Rama Basu.

 The ?burly sergeants? then allegedly pushed Gambhir and his aunt against their car and beat them up. Next, ?a man clad in a black safari suit? and toting a walkie-talkie, came up to where the trouble was, made some inquiries and then left in a white Ambassador that overtook Basu?s car and headed towards Palm Avenue. 

 ?He was seated in the rear, on the left side. I think the car belongs to the CM?s convoy,? Basu said.

 By then, the traffic was beginning to clear and Basu moved on. But not before Basu had asked the elderly constable what the trouble was. ?CM-er convoy-er saathe kichhu hoyechhe (Something must have happened with the chief minister?s convoy),? replied the constable. ?It was clear that even the policemen who were beating the young man up did not have a clue as to what exactly had happened,? observed Basu.

 As for Gambhir, Friday saw his letter of protest being delivered to the offices of the chief minister, the chief secretary and the police commissioner. He now awaits the first word in his vigil for justice.

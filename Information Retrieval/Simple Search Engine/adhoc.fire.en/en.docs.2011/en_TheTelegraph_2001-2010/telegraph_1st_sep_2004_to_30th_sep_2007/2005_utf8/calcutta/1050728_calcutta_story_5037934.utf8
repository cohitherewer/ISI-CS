Those who prefer the stringy noodles to the rice in 

Chinese fare must check out the Noodle Banquet at Chinoiserie at the Taj Bengal. 

On till the end of the month, the noodle festival bears testimony to the variety 

in flavours of this Calcutta favourite. Utilising the wealth of Oriental cuisine, 

the menu showcases 12 different types of noodle. 

 Ho Fan is a fresh chilli and black bean-flavoured flat noodles, while the Hunan Style Crispy Noodles are fried wanton triangles in Hunan sauce. The Pad Thai is a kind of Thai fried noodles with beancurd and the Pan Fried Mandarin Noodles is a dish of pan-fried noodles topped with oyster-flavoured sauce. Chinoiserie Special Noodles is a bowl of homemade stir-fried flat noodles and the Ko Lou Noodles is crispy noodles topped with sweet and sour sauce. Each of these are available with the option of chicken or vegetables.

 More exotic varieties include the Ant Climbing Up The Bush (fried glass noodles with a spicy minced lamb preparation), Kyet-Tha Khauk-Swe-Byoke (Burmese chicken noodles) and Bami Goreng (a spicy Indonesian speciality with chicken and prawns).

 For those preferring less spicy options, theres the Peking Style Crispy Fried Rice Noodles (crispy fried noodles topped with bean extract) and Cantonese Style Whole Wheat Noodles (steamed whole wheat noodles topped with mild garlic sauce).

 Finally, the Mee Hoon in Lotus Leaf is a must-try; it comprises a unique blend of lemongrass, vegetables, pork, prawn, egg and bean thread wrapped in a lotus leaf and steamed in a bamboo wicker. While the others promise quick serving, this pronounces a 15-minute waiting period on the menu itself.

 Each of the items used here is indigenous. Noodle needs no accompaniment and so we decided on this festival, said a hotel spokesperson.

 Hilsa hub

 The food fiesta continues at another Taj eatery, Sonargaon. The Indian speciality restaurant is hosting a hilsa festival, keeping in mind the flavours of Bengal. With an extensive menu of nine varieties of ilish (hilsa), the festival will stay open for fish lovers till August 21.

 Those who savour their ilish spiced up with mustard can opt for Bhapa Ilish (a traditional Bengali preparation of hilsa steamed in mustard and curd gravy), Sorse Bata Ilish (a spicy hilsa preparation in mustard gravy) or the much-loved Ilish Paturi (boneless hilsa marinated with mustard, wrapped in banana leaves and steamed).

 If picking fish bones is not your style, there is the Ilish Tok Jhal (boneless hilsa in spicy and sour gravy tempered with panch phoron), the Ilish Korma (hilsa in a rich onion and poppy seed gravy), the Smoked Hilsa (boneless smoked hilsa flavoured with black pepper) and the Ilish Tikka (boneless hilsa patty cooked on a griddle). Other specials on the menu are the Ilish Bhaja (home-style crispy fried hilsa) and Anaros Ilish (hilsa cooked with pineapple chunks). 

All dishes are priced between Rs 425 and Rs 455.

 This festival takes place every year at this time. The focus is on the fresh ilish as well as the fresh ingredients that go into making dishes that are popular year after year. It must also be mentioned that the inclusion of boneless varieties took place specially to appease all those hilsa lovers who travel to Calcutta to get a taste of this much-loved fish, says executive chef Surinder Singh.

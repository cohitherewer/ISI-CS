The Met office on Friday said more rain was expected in the city and its adjoining areas during the next few days.

 It said thunderclouds were forming under the influence of a low pressure over west central Bay of Bengal off north Andhra Pradesh and south Orissa coast.

 ?The monsoon will soon begin to phase out. During this period, we have frequent thunderstorm activity. We expect a few spells of rain and thundershowers during the next couple of days,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the regional meteorological centre at Alipore. ?From October, the cyclone season begins,? he added.

 Heavy rain lashed large parts of south and central Calcutta on Thursday as the low pressure had gradually formed over west central Bay of Bengal from Wednesday. The Met office on Thursday had recorded over 103 mm of rain at Alipore.

 ?The low pressure has helped in the formation of thunderclouds locally. On Thursday, clouds had formed locally over south and central Calcutta, leading to very heavy rain. But in Dum Dum, the rain gauge of the weather office recorded only a trace of rainfall,? an officer said.

 On Friday, the sky frequently grew overcast and a few smart showers were reported from various parts of the city as well as Howrah and neighbouring districts.

 Musician and foodie Nondon Bagchi takes us through a culinary journey of the 

 various facets of Italian cuisine as explored by Italian master chef Antonio Carluccio

 Italian cooking, says Antonio Carluccio with a twinkle in his eyes, needs the right ingredients, fresh and of good quality; it needs passion and a good partner! 

 This genial gentleman, whose eventful and varied life could easily be the story of more than one person, was in the city till yesterday to launch an Italian food festival at The Atrium at The Park. It will be on till Sunday.

 His passion for matters culinary and things edible began over sixty years ago at the tender age of seven, when a big turn-on was to disappear into the wilds in Piedmont in northern Italy, where he spent his childhood, where large tracts of land still had ground cover and trees that were completely natural and all kinds of wild foods could be collected. Wild rocket, dandelion and other herbs and greens, mushrooms, nuts, wild fruits and berries. He has never stopped travelling this road and today he is an authority on mushrooms and other edible fungi, lives in England and knows how to track down giant puffball mushrooms in the heart of Hyde Park, London.

 Journalist, wine merchant, author, culinary expert and restaurateur are other roads he has travelled. A deep love for his country and a research-minded nature have made him conversant with the cuisine of the different regions of Italy and a crystalisation of these facets of the man finds expression in the creations at the food festival. 

 At last we have a window through which to look at aspects of Italian cuisine other than pizzas and pastas; what they do with an amazing variety of fish, meat, poultry, game, gamebirds and a wide assortment of vegetables is embarrassing in its richness. Recipes run into thousands for eel, pheasant, quail, turkey, pigeon, rabbit, hare and even frogs legs.

 The menu progresses through Antipasti (starters) and Il Primo (the first course, consisting of soups, pastas and risottos) to Il Secondo (the main course) and desserts. Among the starters are a couple of delicious, very simple vegetable items: Fried Antichokes and Zucchini alla Scapece (fried courgette salad). Both items simply require frying, seasoning and dressing with the minimum of ingredients so that the flavours of the antichokes and zucchini are not lost, but merely enhanced. 

 The zucchini salad should be left to marinate for a couple of hours in the seasoning and dressing (salt, garlic, olive oil, white wine vinegar) after being fried, to bring out the full flavour. The best of the starters for me, however, were the morels (a kind of edible fungus) stuffed with rich chicken liver pat?.

 Moving on to Il Primo, there is Cream of Ceps (a small variety of mushroom) Soup which involves the minimum of ingredients. Saut? onions, add mushrooms and then vegetable stock; bring to boil, simmer, add salt, pepper and double cream. For non-vegetarians, there is Broth with Chicken Dumplings. 

 After the soups, there is a choice of three risottos, five pasta items and one gnocchi dish ? Gnocchi with Spinach and Gorgonzola, a superb dish where the gnocchi is made with a potato base (semolina and polenta can be used) along with chopped spinach, flour, beaten egg and seasoning. The sauce is made with milk, butter and gorgonzola cheese and the gnocchi is served in this sauce. Delicious.

 Among the pastas, Tagliolini with Truffles (an edible fungus) is a must, and there are three risottos ? made with a special carnaroli rice risotto rice. The Mushroom Risotto and the Asparagus Risotto are made with vegetable stock and the Risotto of Quail and Porcini (another kind of mushroom) with chicken stock.

 The main courses, however, are where the really interesting items come in. Ligurian Rabbit with Potatoes and Olives topped the list for me. It was the first time I was eating this meat which is white, tender and non-fibrous and easily absorbs the flavours of the ingredients it is cooked with; onions and herbs being ideal. The Fish Goulash, made with fish, mussels, onions, tomatoes, red peppers, fish stock, parsley and seasonings, came in a very close second. Vegetarian main courses to be recommended are the Lasagne of Mixed Mushrooms and Zucchini Parmigiana.

 A few months ago, Yvonnick Deniau from Brittany in France joined The Park as executive chef. The menu at The Atrium and daily lunch buffet has already been stamped with his signature with an array of continental items. Now, after the visit of Carluccio, who interacted intensively with the chefs here, a rich legacy of continental cuisine has been added to Calcuttas palette of culinary hues, which is a welcome development.

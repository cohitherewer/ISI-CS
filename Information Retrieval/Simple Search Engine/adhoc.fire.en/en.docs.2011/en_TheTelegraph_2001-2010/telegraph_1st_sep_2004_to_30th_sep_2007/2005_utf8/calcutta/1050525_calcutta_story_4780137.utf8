The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Team of 12 to keep pace

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The architects and city planners are opting for a comprehensive development plan for areas adjacent to New Town and a 30-year master plan on infrastructure and civic services for the township.

 An experts? panel ? led by R.L. Muni Chakraborty, former professor of IIT Kharagpur and planning adviser to the state government ? has suggested that the master plan be drawn up at the earliest.

 Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), the implementing agency of New Town, has formed the 12-member committee comprising architects and urban planners to prepare a report and make recommendations on land use and development projects around the township.

 ?We have almost finalised the report after conducting extensive surveys and have made some suggestions. We will soon submit it to Hidco. During the surveys, we spoke to people living around the township,? Chakraborty told Metro on Tuesday. 

 ?We hope our suggestions will pave the way for planned development in New Town and its surrounding areas,? he added.

 Promoters have already invaded the areas around New Town. ?The cost of land in certain pockets has suddenly increased tenfold. A large number of buildings are coming up there in an unplanned way. If the authorities do not act right now, the peripheral areas will soon turn into another Kestopur, Baguiati or Mahisbathan,? Chakraborty warned.

 A section of promoters had grabbed vast areas along the Kestopur canal, which forms the boundary of Salt Lake, and converted them into concrete jungles, without making any provision for sewerage, drainage or drinking water supply.

 A similar trend is being observed around New Town. ?Though we cannot stop owners from selling their plots, we will certainly not allow promoters to do whatever they like for their profit,? asserted an official.

 Hidco managing director Sumantra Chowdhury stressed developing both the township and its peripheral areas simultaneously. ?We don?t intend resisting owners from using their land as they wish. But the construction has to be carried out in a planned manner. Just as we are developing the township, we will develop the adjoining areas, too,?? he asserted.

 The rules on land use and development, Chowdhury said, will be framed on the basis of the report of the expert committee. 

 Initially, a notification will be issued, which will be backed by law.

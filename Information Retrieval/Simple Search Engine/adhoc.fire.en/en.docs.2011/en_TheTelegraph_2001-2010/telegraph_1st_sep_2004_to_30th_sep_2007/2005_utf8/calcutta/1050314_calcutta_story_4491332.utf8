 Trailing the Serpent

 Charles Sobhraj?s statue at Goa?s O? Coquiero restaurant

 It was a rare occasion when a media meet turned out to be as dramatic (if not more) than the show it launched. The setting: O? Coquiero, an old Portuguese restaurant in the heart of Goa?s Panjim. The occasion: unveiling of a new show on National Geographic Channel (NGC).

 Throughout the day, mediapersons ? assembled from various parts of the country ? had received printed handouts and objects that were supposed to provide clues as to what the show was all about. But all these managed to do was make things even more mysterious.

 One of the handouts, with a pair of dark shades, read: ?Interpol has issued a red alert for the Serpent. A drug dealer and jewel thief, the Serpent kills unsuspecting foreign tourists and? last spotted, he was wearing similar glasses.? Other clues included a box containing a magnifying glass, a Swiss-army knife, a torch and a compass.

 Cut to O? Coquiero in the evening. It is revealed that the new series airing on NGC would be Nat Geo Investigates, a show debuting with the tale of the notorious Charles Sobhraj.

 The announcement follows the screening of the first episode, entitled The Serpent, which chronicles Sobhraj?s crime career through the 1970s and 80s.

 Sobhraj would befriend foreign tourists, playing the perfect host at parties in his home and offering gems at low prices. Then, the tourists would start disappearing one by one. Their bodies would be found ? some drugged and drowned, others burnt and disfigured ? but at spots distant enough from each other to avoid suspicion.

 Police personnel in Nepal, India and Thailand, the Interpol and a newspaper correspondent narrate their experiences in the documentary to finally piece together the puzzle and chalk out Sobhraj?s terror trail.

 After the third segment of the episode, the screening stops abruptly. Then, an announcement is made that, for a moment at least, sends a slight chill down everyone?s spine. It was at this restaurant, a few tables away, that the Serpent was finally arrested by police on a similar evening in 1986.

 The rest of the first episode, about the killer awaiting trial in a Nepalese jail, is then aired.

 March 14 onwards, Nat Geo Investigates will chase similar dangerous fugitives, carry out aircraft investigations and examine the seconds just before and after a disaster. Other episodes include the 9/11 Pentagon attack, crash of the Concorde flight and discovery of a bunker filled with weapons in Nicaragua.

 The idea behind such a series? ?NGC always tries to explain and understand the world we live in,? offered Charath Narasimhan, vice-president (marketing). The channel ? core viewership currently comprising upwardly mobile youth in urban cities ? plans to reach out to a wider set of people through Nat Geo Investigates, every weeknight at 10 pm on National Geographic Channel.

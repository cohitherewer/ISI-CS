 The Saturday Club Invitational Sports Carnival is the time to showcase the bonhomie among the top-notch clubs in the city. This year, too, the 10-day-long carnival, that kicked off on Saturday in association with The Telegraph, has what it takes to be a blast.

 The nine participating clubs this year are Tollygunge Club, Royal Calcutta Golf Club, CC amp;FC, Dalhousie Institute, Punjab Club, Calcutta Swimming Club, Calcutta Club, Bengal Rowing Club and the host, Saturday Club.

 ?The concept of an invitational carnival was conceived by then club president Ajay Mitra, 30 years ago. It is marked by sporting and cultural activities involving members of the clubs. Now, the carnival happens to be one of the most-awaited events on the club calendar,? says Vijay Burman, president of Saturday Club.

 The teams representing various clubs compete in seven disciplines ? bridge, snooker, badminton, squash, table tennis, lawn tennis and swimming.

 Sporting events apart, there was the cultural competition involving the clubs on Saturday night. Each club was allotted a slot of 10 minutes to showcase its skills in various spheres of entertainment.

 Tollygunge Club walked away with the first prize while the hosts bagged the runners-up trophy.

 Thereafter it was time to groove to the latest chartbusters being churned out from the DJ console. 

 The carnival, which started on April 28, will continue till May 7, and the winners of all the events would be announced on the final day.

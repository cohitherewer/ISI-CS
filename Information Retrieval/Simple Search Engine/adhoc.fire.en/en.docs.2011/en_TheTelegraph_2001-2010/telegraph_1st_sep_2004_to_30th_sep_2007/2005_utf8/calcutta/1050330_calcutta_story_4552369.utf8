The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

My film is the dinner and SRK the dessert

After 10 years of writing about films, journalist-turned-film-maker 

SAMAR KHAN has written and directed his first celluloid effort in Kuchh Meetha 

Ho Jaye. He speaks to Pratim D. Gupta on the politics of switching professions 

and the films worst kept secret

 How easy is it for a film journalist to make a 

film?

It is a big step. The dream of making a film is always 

there. But journalism is a completely different ball game altogether. There is 

a lot of logistics involved in film-making and the most difficult is to get the 

money. 

After moving from Delhi to Mumbai, my fascination 

for films grew in a big way. And as a film journalist I had to spend a lot of 

time on the sets interacting with all the film people of the industry. So my aspiration 

of making a film was a gradual process. I was fascinated with the art of film-making 

rather than the end product. I wanted to tell a story and to tell it well. 

 So your interviewing stars and directors made 

up for your lack of a formal training in film-making?

I have always maintained that my training has been 

done by all the Mumbai film-makers. I picked up the skills on the sets and then 

honed them. It hasn?t been a problem that I didn?t learn the technique formally. 

Also, my role as a journalist did help me in getting a fair idea of what the audiences 

would want or like to see in a film. While I can never say that I am right, I 

did have a fair judgment of which way the wind was blowing.

 You always wanted to make Kuchh Meetha Ho Jaye?

The idea of Kuchh Meetha Ho Jaye first struck 

me around five years back. Then I started working on the idea. At the same time 

I was working as a journalist ? I didn?t want to leave the profession. While I 

was toying with other ideas, the Kuchh Meetha? idea was always there. In 

fact, there was another film with Abhishek Bachchan which almost materialised. 

But it had to be Kuchh Meetha?, I guess.

 How did you get Shemaroo to produce your idea?

I think it was the novelty of the theme, which Shemaroo 

liked. They were venturing into film production for the first time. They were 

looking for a non-commercial subject. So my concept of six separate stories happening 

simultaneously at an airport impressed them enough to shell out the Rs 3.5 crore 

budget for the movie. I also had a very commercial approach to the topic which 

suited them just fine.

Add to that, I got my actors at a very reasonable 

rate. I used my personal connections as a film journalist to get hold of my cast. 

I exploited my friendship with them. The producers are also happy with the way 

the film has been shot. We shot in Malaysia for a 28-day start-to-finish schedule. 

And that was quite something with an ensemble cast of 18 members.

 An entire film shot at an airport. Isn?t that 

The Terminal?

There are only two similarities between Kuchh Meetha? 

and The Terminal. Both the films are set in an airport and the names 

of both directors start with the letter ?S?.

Seriously speaking, there are no similarities in the 

two story lines. My film is about how a simple delay in flight can change relationships. 

It?s about six separate incidents running parallel at a small, lazy airport. Although 

shot in Malaysia, because of the convenience of logistics and good looks, it is 

shown as an Indian airport. The film has also been shot in real time. It?s in 

fact inspired by cinematographer-director Santosh Sivan?s condition, when he was 

stuck for 12 hours at the Rome airport due to a flight delay.

 Newcomers Mahima Mehta and Shravan Chabbria in 

Kuchh Meetha Ho Jaye

 Don?t you fear that other film critics or industry 

veterans will lambast your film the way you had criticised many films as a journalist?

I never criticised any film. The films got what they 

deserved. I was doing a job then and I am doing a job now. My point is if the 

film is bad, go ahead and blast it. I think we give too much importance to the 

critics fraternity. These days the audience decides what they want to see. At 

one time, two critics in Mumbai were given demi-god status mainly because of the 

publications they were attached to. Today, things are much more transparent. There 

is not that much value for a critic or his critique. It is the word-of-mouth publicity 

that counts which again depends a lot on the multiplex mania and television talk. 

The audiences now have a wider sense of a particular film playing at the theatres.

 Your film also marks the return of Arshad Warsi 

as a leading man. Was it a post-Munnabhai decision?

Arshad is not really the leading man of my film. There?s 

an ensemble feel to the cast. There are 18 actors in that ensemble. Everyone from 

Sachin Khedekar to Irawati Harshe to Jaspal Bhatti to Sandhya Mridul to Parvin 

Dabbas. We also have two newcomers in Shravan Chabbria and Mahima Mehta. The only 

other film which I can remember tried something like this is Monsoon Wedding. 

In true Bollywood tradition of the leading man, we 

are indeed using Arshad as a tool in our promotions. But it?s also a fact that 

he is very important to the script. I had discussed my film with him before Munnabhai 

happened. The formalities happened after the film. After Munnabhai, he 

is, of course, a favourite with the audiences.

 Writer-director Samar Khan

 And the Shah Rukh Khan special appearance in your 

film is the worst kept secret?

(Laughs). While writing the film around three 

years back I had told Shah Rukh that there is an interesting cameo and I would 

like you to do it. He had said yes then. And hats off to him that he has kept 

his promise. However, I don?t want to use him as the USP of the film. It?s not 

an SRK film. My film is like a dinner and he is the dessert. If you don?t like 

the dinner, you won?t stay back for the dessert and the dessert can never save 

the dinner.

 Do you foresee any problem with Cadbury?s over 

the title, like Pepsi and Dil Maange More??

No there should be no problem with Cadbury?s. We have 

already had our meetings with them and we have mentioned their name in the credits 

of the film. Also, the title was registered quite some time back. And these are 

completely different domains.

 What?s next after Kuchh Meetha Ho Jaye?

I really haven?t thought about anything. I am waiting 

for the April 15 release of my film. I don?t have the right to make another film 

if I am not accepted.

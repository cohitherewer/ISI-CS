 Owners of schools, get to class

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 After teachers and principals, it?s now the turn of the owners of ICSE and ISC schools to acquire classroom skills.

 In a novel initiative, the Council of Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has organised short courses for owners of ICSE schools new to the education business.

 The aim is to equip them with the administrative capability to efficiently run such institutions.

 ?Anyone who can afford to invest a large sum of money and has the right connections can now open a school. Being new to the field, he may not run the institution the right way,? observed G. Arathoon, CISCE deputy secretary and head of the council?s eastern region office.

 ?Through our course, we intend to help the owners strike a balance between the vision of the council and the demands of the changing times,? he added.

 The CISCE is, arguably, the first board in the country to try and educate school- owners.

 ?We have been organising regular training programmes for our teachers and principals on how to cope with the demands of the students. With the number of students increasing every year, we feel the owners, too, need to be brought into the fold,? Arathoon pointed out.

 There are more than 100 schools affiliated to the council in the city alone ? the highest concentration in the country. A dozen schools are awaiting no-objection certificates from the state government.

 Since the school-owners might not be able to devote much time to the training programme, it would be held in phases.

 ?The lectures will not be held for more than two days at a stretch? The response from the owners has been very encouraging,? stated a council official.

 The state government has recently constituted a 13-member committee to compile information about the functioning of private English-medium schools. It is presently collecting data on 500-plus institutions spread over Bengal.

 Once the data is gathered, a regulatory body would be set up to ensure that the schools maintain a minimum academic standard and remain accountable for their expenditure.

 According to some CISCE officials, the threat of a government crackdown on schools lagging behind in academics and engaged in financial malpractice has spurred the council into starting the course for the owners.

 The special curriculum will cover all aspects of school administration. There would be modules on admission of students, recruitment of teachers, syllabi, relations with government agencies, communication with guardians, handling demands of the students and regulating academic pressure.

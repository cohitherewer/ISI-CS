 Mother faces defence barrage

 - Rajnis 

Patel death case reopens after 24-day break

 DEBASHISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES

 After a 24-day intermission, the Rajnis Patel case reopened on Monday at the court of the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM), with the dead youngster?s mother, Munni Devi, facing pointed questions from the defence lawyers. The 17-year-old died at SSKM Hospital in June 2003 after five surgeries failed to set right a broken shinbone.

 On January 28, SDJM Manjit Singh adjourned the hearings after accused Souvik Bardhan?s counsel Asish Kumar Khan refused to cross-examine the prosecution?s witness. Khan had argued that he could not start his cross-examination unless Amitabha Ganguly, representing accused Dilip K. Majumdar, who was then out of town, did not finish cross-examining Munni Devi.

 On Monday, Ganguly failed to arrive at the court on time, inviting the judge?s censure. ?Please tell him not to waste the court?s time. We are all waiting for him,? Singh told defence counsel Dipit Basu.

 Munni Devi finally took her place in the witness box at 12.30 pm. The hour-long hearing saw Ganguly attempting to prove that she had not revealed all the details of the case to the police and that she did know the team of doctors who had attended to Rajnis well enough to hold five of them responsible for his death. The proceedings were halted for a few minutes when Munni Devi broke down under questioning.

 Khan, on the other hand, zeroed in on the dates on which the Patels were out of Calcutta ? between June 4, 2003 and June 16, 2003 ? trying to prove that the bereaved parents had been tutored during the period. 

 He said he suspected that the names of four of the accused ? Souvik Bardhan, Sandip Manna, Jayanta Mondol and Nirmalya Basu ? were added to Dilip K. Majumdar?s name at the instigation of a third party.

 Later, public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh told Metro that, if convicted, the five accused could get two-year imprisonment terms.

 Under Section 304A of Indian Penal Code, relating to death caused by negligence, ?whoever causes the death of any person by doing a rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both?. It is a cognisable and bailable offence.

 ?Copies of all documents pertaining to medical treatment should be handed over to the patient or his relatives. The Patels were not given any such records, and we acquired copies of the same only after a court order,? public prosecutor Ghosh said.

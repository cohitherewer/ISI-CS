 4 girls freed from Pune brothel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four girls from the city and its adjoining areas were rescued from a red-light area in Pune and brought to the city early on Thursday by officers of Lake police station. 

 All the girls, between 18 and 21 years of age, were produced in court and remanded in a state-run refuge centre.

 It was found that all four were sold to a brothel a few days ago. 

 ?Traffickers had promised them good jobs in Mumbai,? said N. Ramesh Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 According to Ramesh Babu, Lake police station began to take action after receiving a complaint from Kalipada Bairagi, father of 18-year-old Jharna, on July 27. 

 Kalipada said in his complaint that his daughter used to work as a domestic help in a Lake Gardens house. 

 ?A young man, identified as Rahul, had eloped with his daughter and sold her to a brothel in Pune.? 

 Police found out that about a month earlier, Rahul and Jharna had become close to each other. 

 ?He promised to marry her. He convinced Jharna that to get married, they would have to flee to Pune,? said Sukumar Chakraborty, officer-in-charge of Lake police station, adding: ?Then Rahul left the city with the girl.?

 After collecting information on the red-light area in Pune, a team of policemen, led by sub-inspector A. Kasem, left the city four days ago. 

 ?In Pune, they kept an eye on the house in which the girl was kept confined,? said Chakraborty.

 Once they were sure that the girl was in that house, police raided the building. ?Jharna was found inside a room. After rescuing her, police carried out a thorough search of the building and found three other girls, identified as Malati Naskar, Sarai Bibi and Manwara Khatun, from the city?s suburbs. Police, however, failed to track down Rahul,? said an officer working on this case.

 While interrogating the girls, police found out that all four were from poor families. 

 ?The traffickers promised them lucrative jobs in Mumbai. They fell for the high salaries on offer. They left the city only to provide their families with a little financial help,? said Ramesh Babu.

 He added that there was a man in Pune who ran the racket of buying girls. But his name could not be disclosed for the sake of investigation. 

 Police said that traffickers keep an eye on girls who come to the city from the suburbs to work as maids in houses or as part-time workers in business establishments. 

 ?We are talking to our counterparts in the districts. We are sharing information with them to curb this racket,? added Ramesh Babu.

 Batons in Salt Lake, batons again in the heart of Calcutta.

 Severe criticism from former chief minister Jyoti Basu notwithstanding, police beat up CPM supporters once again during the counting of votes in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) elections on Tuesday. 

 On Sunday, police had given a drubbing to CPM leader of Dum Dum Amitava Nandi and Basu?s confidential assistant Joykrishna Ghosh in Salt Lake during the municipality elections there.

 Police had to resort to a lathicharge on CPM supporters twice on Tuesday, in front of Don Bosco School and Hastings House, during the counting of votes. 

 Nearly 2,500 CPM cadre had gathered outside Hastings House while the counting was on. When the winning CPM candidate from ward 75 was coming out of the counting booth in a car around 1 pm, his supporters entered Hastings House to greet him with garlands. Deputy commissioner (south) Anuj Sharma asked them to leave, and was subjected to much verbal abuse from the supporters.

 Then police tried to forcibly drive the mob away and a scuffle broke out between the lawkeepers and CPM activists. Stones were thrown at the cops. Police had to resort to a lathicharge to disperse the mob. ?Three persons were injured in the lathicharge. One of them was admitted to SSKM Hospital. Some cops, too, were injured,? Sharma said. 

 Protesting the lathicharge, CPM activists blocked Judges? Court Road in Alipore for nearly 45 minutes. Traffic had to diverted to clear the snarl.

 CPM activists were lathicharged outside Don Bosco School, too. Emotions ran high at the school after the first round of counting for Trinamul Congress stalwart Ajit Panja?s ward 63 ended. 

 Angry Trinamul Congress supporters demanded a repoll when the seal of an automatic voting machine could not be found. Their anger subsided and the counting continued. 

 But when Panja began to lead after the fourth round, the CPM supporters demanded a repoll over the same issue. 

 By that time, supporters of Javed Ahmed Khan, Trinamul candidate from ward 66 (Topsia), were celebrating the victory of their leader on Darga Road, off Don Bosco School. 

 Suddenly, a scuffle broke out between them and a group of CPM supporters. The scuffle snowballed into a clash which left a number of people injured. 

 The clash quickly spread to adjacent CIT Road and Park Circus Maidan. Stones and sticks were pelted freely. Then, a huge police contingent started to lathicharge the warring groups. 

 ?Police tried to separate the clashing groups but when they refused to break up, they had to be chased away. In the ensuing clash, three sub-inspectors and two constables were injured,? said Ranveer Kumar, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 Supporters of CPM candidate from ward 56 (Taltala) Jayasree Deb Nandi, alleged that police lathicharged them without any provocation and ?critically injured? some of their party colleagues.

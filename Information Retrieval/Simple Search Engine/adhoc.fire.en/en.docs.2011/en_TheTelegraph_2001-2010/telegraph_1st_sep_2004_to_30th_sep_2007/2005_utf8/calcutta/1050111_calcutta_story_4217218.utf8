 City celebrities, including a few politicians, were a bit surprised this New Year. 

 Among the bunch of greeting cards each of them received, one was from the Durbar Mahila Samanawya Committee, the NGO for sex workers and their children.

 The card had a beautiful photograph of a sunrise in Puri, accompanied by a caption: ?Dawn of a new beginning?. 

 The celebrities could not be blamed if they had missed the real story, which suggests the end of a dream. 

 The photograph was taken by 13-year-old Kishore Dutta, of the Kalighat red-light area. Along with 50 boys and girls of various red-light pockets of the city, Kishore had taken a seven-month training in photography at a Unicef-funded centre set up by the NGO in Kalighat in 2002.

 But the dream of this enthusiastic group has been all but shattered, as Unicef has stopped allocating funds. 

 And the NGO, by itself, is not in a position to supply the cameras and the films and bear the cost of developing and printing photographs.

 According to sources, the Unicef project was for 14 months and the duration could not be extended under any circumstance. The NGO is in a rather helpless situation and cannot pursue the issue as the post of the child protection officer in Unicef?s Calcutta office has been lying vacant for some time. 

 Kishore, a Class VIII student of Mitra Institution, said the Yashica DX MF-2 Super camera, with which he had taken the photograph used on the greeting cards, had been presented by Unicef two years ago. 

 The Durbar Mahila Samanawya Committee, too, could then afford the cost of films and the production.

 Kishore, like most of his friends, is crestfallen with the turn of events. ?I did not know the dream would be nipped in the bud,? he lamented.

 ?Child labour is my favourite subject and I want to establish myself as a photographer,? said Kishore, holding a bunch of his photographs that were exhibited in Bangladesh in 2001 and in Delhi last year. 

 Mrinalkanti Dutta and Mahasweta Mukherjee of the Durbar Mahila Samanawya Committee said they had received Rs 12.61 lakh from Unicef between October 2001 and December 2002, under the project ?Ensuring Child?s Rights of the Sex Workers? Children Through Creative Expression?.

 The Unicef funds come to Calcutta office from its New York headquarters, via Delhi.

 Writers? Buildings: Safety scurry, A Telegraph picture

 The notion that the government springs into action only if the sky comes crashing down seems to have a ring of truth in it, after all.

 It took a huge chunk of ceiling over a stairway at Writers? Buildings to fall off for the authorities to wake up to the fact that the structure is over 200 years old and needs urgent repairs. The incident on Tuesday was alarming enough for the government to form a six-member committee the very next day to investigate into the safety aspects of the entire building.

 ?It is also important that the electrical lines and fire prevention measures are thoroughly checked. But that is beyond the scope of the present investigation,? state public works department minister Amar Choudhury said on Sunday. To address this need, a separate high-power technical committee will be formed on Monday to check the fire prevention measures at the state?s administrative headquarters, the minister added.

 The construction of Writers? Buildings was started as early as 1690. However, the preliminary work was finished only in 1780. Thereafter, the rooms inside the buildings have undergone several alterations.

 ?It is a known-fact that many of the electrical lines are very, very old. We have to scrutinise the records to find out how old they are. The number of fans, lights, air-conditioners, fax and photocopy machines, exhaust fans, etc, has gone up, with every little available space being taken up by new rooms. Naturally, the increase in the power load needs to be matched by the capacity and the condition of the electrical lines. There can be trouble if extra heat is generated as a result of the increased load,? a senior engineer explained. 

 It is risky if a fan or an exhaust fan is kept switched on after the office is closed. The engineer, however, added that the warning should not be misinterpreted that the lines are not checked every time extensions are made or new machines installed. ?The records would now have to be checked afresh, and if necessary, some lines might have to be changed,? he explained.

 The entire process of survey would take some time, as ?portions of the building under repair might have to be kept out of bounds?, the engineer added.

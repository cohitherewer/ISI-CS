The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Film school meet flops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The proposed meeting between students of the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) and its academic council members on Monday morning had its fair share of drama.

 The meeting, on Day 19 of the students? strike on the EM Bypass campus, started at 10.30 am but was terminated even before a single grievance could be addressed.

 Chairman Basu Chatterjee, director Abhay Shrivastava, dean Abinath Das, heads of departments and external members led by Tripurari Saran, chairman of FTII, along with two ex-students of the institute and four industry insiders, were supposed to have attended the meeting. 

 But none of the external members turned up.

 ?The academic council meeting must have all its members present. But on Monday, all the external members were missing,? said a student of third year, direction.

 ?Barring the chairman, we meet all the internal members every day. We have held two rounds of talks with the chairman, but to address our problems, an academic council meeting was required,? she added.

 After the students left the first meeting in a huff, another meeting was convened in the evening with the director of the institute, where it was decided that the academic council meeting would be held again on Tuesday.

 ?The meeting today was not fruitful, as many members were not present. So, there is another meeting tomorrow. The problem areas have been identified but I am afraid that it would take some time to solve the problems,? director, Shrivastava told Metro.

 ?We told the director that we have run out of patience. We are concerned about our careers and cannot go on like this. We have to put an end to this problem,? said another student of first year, direction.

 The students of SRFTI have been on an indefinite strike since October 26 for alleged academic and financial irregularities in the institution.

 When the impasse was not resolved even after 10 days, the chairman of the institute, Basu Chatterjee, intervened last Monday.

 As a result, the students agreed to the opening of the administrative block of the leading film school in the country after FTII Pune.

 But no classes have been held on the campus for close to three weeks now.

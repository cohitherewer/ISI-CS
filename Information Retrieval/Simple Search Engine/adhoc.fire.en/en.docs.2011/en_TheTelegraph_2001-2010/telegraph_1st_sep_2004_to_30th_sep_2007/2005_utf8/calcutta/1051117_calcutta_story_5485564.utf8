 Germany calls with study bouquet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After the UK and US, it?s the turn of Germany to woo students from Calcutta for higher studies in India?s most important EU business-partner country, with a bouquet of structured international study programmes and research opportunities.

 ?GerManyOpportunities?, an information and counselling session on study and research opportunities in Germany, held at the Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB) on Wednesday evening, set the tone with a presentation, followed by an interactive session and group counselling.

 Organised by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in collaboration with MMB Calcutta, this programme was the first of its kind in the city to showcase higher education opportunities in Germany, reaching out to the academic and scientific community.

 DAAD, a funding agency awarding grants and scholarships for study and research in Germany, has reopened an information point in the city after an eight-year hiatus.

 ?It can help with information on universities and institutions, their course of studies, application procedure, general information on student life in Germany, and of course, with financial assistance,? explained Amrita Dhara, study counsellor at DAADs city information point.

 The increasing availability of English-language courses in Germany and the rise in the number of scholarships on offer have combined to boost student traffic out of India from a mere 600 in 1990 to over 4,500 per year at present.

 ?One of the principal pluses is that most German universities are state-funded and don?t charge any tuition fees. Also, as a bonus, the student can stay back for a year after finishing the course and hunt for a job with the student visa,? Dhara said.

 The main target group of DAAD comprises highly-qualified scientists and young researchers.

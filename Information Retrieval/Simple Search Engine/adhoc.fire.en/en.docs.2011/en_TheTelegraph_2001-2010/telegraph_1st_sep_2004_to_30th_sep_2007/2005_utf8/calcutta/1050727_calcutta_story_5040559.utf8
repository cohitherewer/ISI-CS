 Madhavan: 

 Return to innocence 

 Did you know that Madhavan, the south superstar of Mani Ratnam?s Alaipayuthey, seen in Bollywood duds like Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein and Dil Vil Pyar Vyar, was actually considered for the role of Aamir Khan in Lagaan? Well, that may be inconsequential as of now, but the buzz around the industry is that Madhavan?s comeback attempt at Hindi cinema in the form of Ramji Londonwaley is an absolute winner. 

 Directed by Sanjay Dharma (co-writer and chief assistant director of Lagaan), the comedy has Madhavan playing a small-town cook from Bihar who lands up in London to try his luck as a chef. What follows are the daily trials and tribulations that Ram has to deal with, confronted with the alien western culture. 

 Slated for a theatre release in late August, the film has a strong line-up featuring many a familiar face from the Lagaan XI, including Raj Zutshi, Akhilendra Mishra, Aditya Lakhia and Daya Shankar Pandey. 

 The story of Ramji Londonwaley has been penned by Kamal Haasan and the music is by Vishal Bharadwaj. And there is a surprise appearance in the film by none other than Amitabh Bachchan, who plays himself in the cameo.

 The murder moment from Kkusum: Kill drill

 Twists and turns is the name of the game when it comes to the daily saas-bahu soaps and serials. To break the monotony that creeps into many a storyline, a sudden jolt is used to make the viewers sit up and watch the show again. And this time Ektaa Kapoor has got something going in Kkusum, the daily STAR Plus serial at 9 pm.

 In the show, the leading lady and the title character, Kkusum, who has been epitomising the ultimate values and virtues of the Indian woman, goes on to kill her husband Abhay. Kkusum, who has always put the well-being of her family before herself, will slay the love of her life in the July 28 episode of the serial.

 In fact, it is the auspicious night of Karva Chauth, when women fast and pray for their husbands? long lives, that Kkusum goes on to kill her husband. While the entire family is involved in the rituals of the ceremony, Kkusum leads Abhay away to a secluded place amidst all the celebrations and then... For more, catch this all-important episode of the serial, Thursday at 9 pm, on STAR Plus.

 When it comes to grey matter, it?s difficult to get past Calcutta. It?s not without reason that the city is known as the quizzing capital of the country. After the first edition of Kaun Banega Crorepati, where many a Calcuttan won several lakh in prize money, the second series has started with a bang as far as the city is concerned.

 Of the first schedule of 14 episodes, as many as 16 are from Calcutta and three of them will feature in the first episode itself, to go on air on August 5 on STAR Plus. Sangita Jhunjhunwala from Raghunathpur, Archana Pal from Shodepur and Bipratip Ghosh from Brindavan Gardens will make Calcutta proud as they sit on the Fastest Finger First section of what is billed to be the most watched television show in the country hosted by Amitabh Bachchan.

 ?Darun legechhe,? gushes Archana, who is a housewife and a big Bachchan fan. ?Ever since KBC started, I have always wanted to be on the show but they never got back to me until this time. All those calls on the land line and mobile did help.?

 For Sangita, who is also a housewife, it was the chance to meet Bachchan which made her day. ?Ek nayee alag si duniya thi woh,? she says, just back from Mumbai after the Episode One shoot. ?Unse milke bahut achha laga.?

 Bipratip, an IT consultant, is equally ecstatic. ?I felt like a star myself in those couple of days in Mumbai and the shooting was never boring even for a second,? he tells Metro. But do Sangita, Archana and Bipratip make it to the hot seat? Check out the show to find out.

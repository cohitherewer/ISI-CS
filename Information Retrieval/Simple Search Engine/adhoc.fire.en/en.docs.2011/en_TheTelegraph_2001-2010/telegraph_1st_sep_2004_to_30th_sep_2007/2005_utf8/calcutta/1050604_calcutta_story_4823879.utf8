 For a while on Friday, city police were under the impression that they had recovered the priceless Fifth Century Buddha head that was stolen from Indian Museum six months ago. Their hopes were soon dashed by the museum authorities, who declared the head a replica.

 Acting on a tip-off, members of a special team of the central division raided a house in Belghoria, on the northern fringes of the city, and picked up the head. 

 It was taken straight to the office of police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 ?No arrest was made in this connection. We are now probing how the article reached Belghoria,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central division).

 The confusion partly resulted from the fact that a small plate with Indian Museum inscribed on it was found attached with the wooden base of the head. According to police, the brass plate had the inscription: ?Buddha Head, C 5th century AD, Sarnath, UP, Indian Museum, Calcutta.? 

 Immediately after the Buddha head was taken to the Lalbazar police headquarters, senior officers contacted the museum authorities and sought the help of experts there.

 ?The major identification mark of the stolen head was its broken nose. But the nose of the head we recovered was intact,? said an officer of the detective department who was part of the team.

 The experts also pointed out that the recovered head was made of plaster of Paris. The original, 23 cm long, is made of sandstone.

 ?We are keeping an eye on antique markets across the state as well the country,? said an investigating officer.

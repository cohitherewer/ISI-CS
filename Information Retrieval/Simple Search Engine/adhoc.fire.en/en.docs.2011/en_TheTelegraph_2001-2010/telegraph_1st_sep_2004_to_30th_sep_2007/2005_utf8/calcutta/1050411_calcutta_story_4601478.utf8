Britney Spears: Costly cut

Pop stars uncovered

International music channel VH1 has some interesting 

programmes lined up for what remains of April.

 50 Greatest Teen Idols on April 17, 9 pm, will showcase a diverse mix of young talent whose pre-pubescent pop appeal has conquered music, television and the silver screen. The show will look at the mass hysteria created by teen idols like Michael Jackson, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio, the Spice Girls and many more.

 The Fabulous Life, in its April 19 (10 pm) episode features pop diva Britney Spears and the monetary mechanics that maintain the well-heeled life of the pop princess. Interesting info emerge about Britney, such as the fact that the scissors that cut her hair cost $ 3,000 and are imported from Japan!

 Album covers have evolved from simply putting the band or artiste?s photo on the cover to critically acclaimed works of art over the decades. 50 Greatest Album Covers, April 22 at 10 pm, brings to light the compelling and undiscovered stories behind some of them.

 Just a few questions that will be answered: what do the digital symbols represent on the cover of Police?s Ghost in the Machine? Whose crotch is pictured on the Rolling Stones? Sticky Fingers? Who is the baby in the pool on the cover of Nirvana?s Nevermind and where is he now? Is that really a dog on the cover of Beck?s Odelay, and what does the title mean? There will also be rare footage of the artistic process of creating album covers.

 Farah Khan with A.R. Rahman: Truly international

 It?s not just Aishwarya Rai who?s going international. Farah Khan has just been offered to do a Chinese film. This comes after her much-acclaimed moves in Andrew Lloyd Webber?s Bombay Dreams. This time it?s Peter Chan?s new musical Perhaps Love. What?s even more fascinating is the fact that the film will be produced by Andre Morgan, who has recently produced the Oscar winner Million Dollar Baby.

 Chan, who had earlier made the critically acclaimed The Love Letter in 1999, will shoot his film in Shanghai in a non-stop 50-day shooting schedule. Of those 50 days, 10 will be spent on shooting the five songs, to be choreographed by Farah and her 10-member dance team.

 As for Farah?s second directorial venture after the debut blockbuster Main Hoon Na, it?s titled Happy New Year and will star Amitabh Bachchan alongside friend-producer Shah Rukh Khan. The casting process to find the leading ladies is on.

 Here?s cause for Taureans to tune into Cartoon Network. Toon-o-scope this month premieres Atomic Betty, the galactic guardian and defender of the cosmos. Betty stands out for her determination and strength of will, which come in handy when the universe depends upon her for security.

 Betty, being a true bull, is smart, funny, strongly independent and not afraid to speak her mind. But remember never to mention her hair, for she is a little sensitive about that. Lucky Taurus numbers, according to the show, are 4, 385, 263, 627, 552 and the lucky colour is green. As for what the future holds for the bulls, ask Betty.

Sandip Ray: Return route

 Providing a much-needed boost to Bengali films this Poila Baisakh, cell phone biggie Airtel has tied up with Sandip Ray?s Nishijapon to promote the film. Based on a Narayan Gangopadhyay story, Nishijapon stars Soumitra Chatterjee, Dipankar De, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Rituparna Sengupta, Raima Sen and Parambrata Chatterjee. The film premieres at 89 Cinemas on Thursday.

 As part of the tie-up, Airtel customers will be able to participate in an SMS and voice-based contest on 646. All that the callers will have to do is answer ?simple questions on the film, its cast, the making and the story?. Among the host of prizes reserved for the winners is a dinner date with the cast, an adda with the director and his actors at Airtel Experience Centre and free tickets to the film?s premiere. Customers can also download the film?s clips from Airtel Live. The Nishijapon theme music can be downloaded via Hello Tunes, through 678. ?We hope there will be more such corporates supporting the industry and thus making projects a success,? said Sandip Ray, on the tie-up.

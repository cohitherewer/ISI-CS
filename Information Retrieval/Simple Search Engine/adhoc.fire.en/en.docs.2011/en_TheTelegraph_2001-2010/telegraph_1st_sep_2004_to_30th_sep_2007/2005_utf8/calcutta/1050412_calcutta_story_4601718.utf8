Life

 Soup for the soul 

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Move over two-minute noodles and heat-and-eat meals. Soup mugs with detailed recipes are here to hot up your kitchen options. Just the acquisition for a bachelor?s pad, the colourful mugs sport easy-to-prepare recipes like chicken soup, mushroom soup and onion soup.

 The look is as cool as the recipes, with the mugs available in white, yellow and blue. Shaped more like pitchers, the mugs have a broad base and narrow mouth with handles.

 These make for ideal housewarming gifts, especially for those who like it all readymade.

 The following are a few samples to get the meal going:

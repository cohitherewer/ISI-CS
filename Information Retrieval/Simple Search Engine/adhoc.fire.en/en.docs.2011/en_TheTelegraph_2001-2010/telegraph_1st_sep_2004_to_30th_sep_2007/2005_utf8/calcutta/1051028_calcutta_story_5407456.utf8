 Lake brake with rail, road block

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mamata Banerjee?s rasta roko failed to slow down the city last week. Now, she has announced a rail and roadblock combo to push her point.

 The Trinamul Congress on Thursday announced that it would launch a series of programmes next month to stop the state government from evicting the squatters along the railway tracks at Rabindra Sarobar (the Dhakuria Lakes).

 Party MLA and leader of the squatters? Sangram Committee, Sougata Roy, said: ?A protest meeting has been convened on November 8 by the committee. Mamata Banerjee will address the rally.? 

 The next day, party workers and Sangram Committee members will march to Writers? Buildings.

 ?Starting November 10, the squatters, led by our party, will participate in a series of sit-ins on the rail tracks between Ballygunge and Tollygunge,? Roy added.

 The ?attitude? of both the railway and the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on the issue, Roy said, had prompted the party to opt for the disrupt-traffic protest route.

Sweltering under the summer sun so soon? Get on with the make-up and styling mood of the season to keep looking cool. Almost as fast as the heat threatens to melt away make-up and dehydrate tresses, workshops and makeover sessions are being spun out across the city.

 Latest on the list were actresses Swastika Mukherjee and Locket Chatterjee. Swastika was given the contemporary bridal look by Aniruddha Chakladar while Locket?s hair received the royal treatment from Ahmed Habib.

 ?The times are changing and not everyone wants to look traditional on their wedding day. That?s why I gave Swastika a chic, contemporary make-up regime while keeping her outfit traditional,? says Aniruddha. The style is what he calls fusion and he demonstrated it ? as well as the basic dos and don?ts of make-up ? at a two-day workshop for beauty professionals.

 ?Make-up is all about camouflaging flaws and shouldn?t be very loud or in-your-face. The wearer?s natural glow should be allowed to show,? he adds. It is for this reason that no amount of war paint can replace a regular cleansing, toning and moisturising regime, he stresses.

 ?You can?t wake up one morning and pamper your skin and then forget about it,? explains the make-up expert. He also ventured into more familiar territory, showing his audience how to create one traditional and another strikingly filmi look on two models.

 At the Ho Chi Minh Sarani address of Habibs, Javed Habib?s father ? a legend who has worked on Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi?s hair ? was pleased to note an informed audience about fashion colours. 

 Styling Locket?s hair without giving her a cut, he changed her parting to frame her face softly, showing off her cheekbones.

 ?Even a few years ago, hair styles were all about cuts. Today cuts are just the beginning. One can achieve so much by using fashion colours,? shares the veteran.

 Hair colour, he adds, is like an ornament, and can be used and changed according to the needs of the individual. Pegging shades of red and gold as the colours for the season, he gave the models highlights with both shades.

 ?These colours go well with the Indian skin tone and will be used across the country for a few months now,? predicts the man who took hairdressing lessons in London at a time when the profession was far from fashionable.

 ?It?s a good time for us now since women at least agree to get their hair styled. When I started out, a woman wouldn?t let a stylist touch her hair,? reminisces Habib.

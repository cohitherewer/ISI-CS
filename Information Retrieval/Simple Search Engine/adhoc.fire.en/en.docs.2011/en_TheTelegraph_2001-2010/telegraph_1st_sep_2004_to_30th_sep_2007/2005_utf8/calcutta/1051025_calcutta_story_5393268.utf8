Banned crackers find new gates

 Kali puja and Diwali a few days away, banned crackers are steadily making their way into the city and its surrounding areas through traditional as well as new routes.

 Police recently confiscated a consignment of banned crackers in Purulia. The packets, on their way to Calcutta, had fake tags claiming approval of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board.

 ?We have confiscated several banned crackers with fake pollution control board tags. They were coming from Jharkhand, which has a long border with our district,? said superintendent of Purulia police R. Sibkumar.

 According to board sources, huge consignments of banned fireworks from Jharkhand and Bihar are entering the state through Purulia and Bankura, not known as traditional routes. 

 These fireworks are headed straight to retail markets in and around the city.

 ?We, too, have the feedback that banned items are coming into the city from these two states and are being marketed mostly in fringe areas,? said Burrabazar Fireworks Dealers Association president Indrajit Buddhiraja, who oversees legal fireworks markets in Calcutta.

 These smuggled fireworks are in addition to what are being made in traditional strongholds like North and South 24-Parganas and Hooghly.

 ?We have already seized around 1,900 kg of banned crackers,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. Areas in the district that are notorious for producing banned crackers include Nungi, Mahestala and Budge Budge.

 ?It?s a fact that there have been attempts to bring in banned items to the city and its suburbs,? admitted pollution control board chairman Sudip Bandopadhyay. ?We are aware of the developments.?

 Bandopadhyay confirmed that ?production, use and sale of fireworks that generate noise more than 90 dB(A) at five metres from the point of bursting are banned in the state?.

 However, citing a Supreme Court order that differs from the green watchdog?s directive, Pradesh Atashbaji Byabsai Samity secretary Yeakub Kazi alleged: ?The board has no authority in the matter? It is illegally clinging to the 90-decibel limit. The norm elsewhere is to limit noise from a cracker at 125 decibel at four metres from the source.?

 Kazi said board officials had never bothered to consider the Samity?s point of view. ?We have sent legal notices to the board and will move court soon,? he threatened.

 Board?s law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, however, claimed that under Environment Rules, 1986, any state board can frame its own environment norms.

 A sumptuous meal of Chinese and Indian delicacies awaits you as Trincas plays host to Platter Chatter from November 10 to January 8.

 As the name suggests, the idea is to offer foodies a comprehensive spread that one can enjoy over a chit chat. The platter options are based on the more popular dishes and is definitely good value for money, smiles Shashi Puri, co-owner of Trincas.

 The menu is an assortment of five vegetarian and seven non-vegetarian picks. Non-vegetarians can choose from Indian options that include the Mahi Platter (Fish Masala, Dal Makhni, Aloo Achari and buttered rice), Chelo Platter (Chicken Tikka, Chicken Seekh, Aloo Achari and buttered rice) and Gosht Platter (Tava Gosht, Dal Makhni, Aloo Achari and Roti).

 Vegetarians can check out the Veggie Platter (Malai Kofta, Chana Masala, Gobi Aloo and Roti) or the Paneer Platter (Paneer Jhalfrezi, Dal Makhni, Gobi Aloo and rice).

 Non-vegetarians with a thing for Chinese cuisine have the Hakka Platter, Ming Room Lamb Platter, Fishermens Platter and Tetrazini Platter to choose from. Vegetarians can dig into the Ming Room Paneer Platter, Ming Room Veggie Platter or Veggie Cutlet Platter.

 The platters are available only for lunch and they are all priced at Rs 135!

 Grilled grub

 With a nip in the air, nothing could be better than a hot tandoori meal. Promising Calcuttans just that is Guchhi at Hotel Hyatt Regency, with a Kebab and Paratha festival.

 On from November 4 to 13, the festival offers a wide assortment of vegetarian and non-vegetarian kebabs and parathas.

 For non-vegetarians, there is Lasooni Jheenga (jumbo prawns marinated with garlic paste, yoghurt and garam masala), Shikampuri Kebab (mint-flavoured-curd-filled deep fried lamb patty in Hyderabadi style) and Kastoori Kebab (chicken cubes marinated with gram flour, red chillies and garam masala).

 Vegetarians can try out the Tandoori Bharwan Guchhi (jumbo morels filled khoya and cottage cheese), Subz Galouti (Lucknowi-style kidney bean patty) or Hare Matar ki Seekh (minced green peas and Indian masala cooked on skewers). In parathas, take your pick from Gosht Keema Paratha, Malabari Paratha and Gobi Ka Paratha.

 Chef Anil Khurana, who has been flown in from Delhi to cook up this festival fare, says: Calcuttans are known for their love for tandoori food. We have chosen the menu carefully so that both non-vegetarians and vegetarians can enjoy.

 A meal for two, without alcohol, comes to Rs 700-plus.

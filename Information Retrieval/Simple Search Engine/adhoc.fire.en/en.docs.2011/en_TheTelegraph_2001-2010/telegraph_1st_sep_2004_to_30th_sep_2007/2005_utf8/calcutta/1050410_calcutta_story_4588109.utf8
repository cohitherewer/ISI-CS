The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In splendid isolation

 Nationalism or any other lure cannot 

 work all alone. The brand in flesh and blood has to stand 

 behind it

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 It 

 was another midweek trip out of town. I really did not care 

 where I was flying to ? Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore. The 

 very thought of a few more nights in a hotel room, another 

 unending series of meetings and the boredom of the impending 

 air travel made the immediate future look very bleak. 

 The only saving grace was my favourite 

 private airline. Once inside the aircraft, I knew the comfort 

 level would be high, the food would be tolerable and the 

 crew behaviour would be unobtrusively pleasant. I patted 

 myself on the back for choosing the right airline and whispered 

 a line from an old ad ?It is the right choice, baby?.

 At the airport, I was making my 

 unhurried way to the check-in counter. Two policemen at 

 two entry points satisfied themselves that I was a genuine 

 passenger. These guys are not impressed by jackets and ties. 

 You never know these days, they seemed to be saying. Baggage 

 screening over, I was walking past the row of counters of 

 the national carrier. This is when the poster drew my attention.

 It was a simply laid-out advertisement 

 from Indian Airlines. And it said things that made me stop 

 and read the copy very carefully. The ad said: ?What do 

 you do when a nation?s name is in your name? You get busy 

 living up to the nation?s dreams. You stop asking ?Why must 

 I?? You become the only airline to rip out seats to accommodate 

 that frail grandmother on a stretcher. You work 200 hours 

 non-stop to evacuate fellow countrymen because they are 

 stranded in an alien country. You fly in the face of cyclones, 

 earthquakes and floods, in Bhuj or Orissa. You have to. 

 Because if you don?t who will? We have a nation to live 

 up to.?

 It was like being in a time machine. 

 I went back many years, when as a kid it was mandatory for 

 me, thanks to my father, to hoist the national flag on the 

 balcony every 15th of August, stand up every time Jana 

 gana mana was played, blow the conch shell on the 23rd 

 of January a little after one o? clock in the afternoon.

 Those were distant days when ?I 

 love my India? had not become just a hummable tune. For 

 a moment I forgot my flight, sat in the sofa opposite and 

 read the ad again. I was feeling guilty that I was flying 

 another airline. That I thought could be corrected later 

 but for now let me get hold of a copy of this ad. They must 

 have used these powerful lines in other media too. So I 

 walked up to the gentleman in an unmistakable Indian Airlines 

 uniform and asked him where I could get a copy of this ad. 

 He replied in a bewildered voice: ?Sir, which ad are you 

 talking about?? I took him to the poster. He said ?Oh this 

 one? and sent me to the customer service counter.

 At the counter, there were four 

 or five people waiting to be served. Five minutes later, 

 I was told that they did not know the poster existed. When 

 I showed them, I was asked to write to Delhi. I made my 

 way back to the poster, took out pen and paper from the 

 briefcase and wrote down every word in the ad as if they 

 were from a holy book.

 One wonders whether our nationalism 

 is today confined to the cricket field. Obviously it is 

 not wholly true. As a friend pointed out, even as consumer 

 bait, it has played a useful role in as recent a campaign 

 as Hamara Bajaj.

 The lesson lies elsewhere. Nationalism 

 or any other lure cannot work all alone. The brand in flesh 

 and blood has to stand behind it. Just for the record, I 

 did not make any change in my flight bookings.

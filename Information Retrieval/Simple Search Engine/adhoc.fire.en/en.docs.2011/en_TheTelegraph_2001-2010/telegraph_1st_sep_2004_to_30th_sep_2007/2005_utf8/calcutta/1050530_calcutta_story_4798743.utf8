 Remarriage stay greets US divorce

 TAPAS GHOSH

 In a rare judgment, the Alipore district judges? court has passed an injunction stopping a US-based engineer from marrying a second time.

 Biswajyoti Ghosh was granted a divorce by a US court from Calcuttan Paramita Ghosh, his first wife.

 The Alipore district judge passed the order last week on the basis of a petition by Paramita, who had not been able to afford to travel to the US to fight the divorce case lodged by her husband there.

 ?Since everything legal in the divorce case was conducted in the US, there was nothing my client could do from here. But, finally, justice has been delivered,? said Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, Paramita?s lawyer.

 Paramita had married Biswajyoti Ghosh, an engineer employed by Affiliated Computer Services in Dallas, Texas, on December 22, 1998.

 ?Two years after their marriage, Paramita went to live in her husband?s house at Fort Worth, in the US. After 11 months, she was forced to return to India as she used to be tortured by her mother-in-law, who stayed with them,? said Chatterjee.

 Paramita?s father Promod Das, a resident of SC Banerjee Road in Beleghata, said his daughter was driven out by her mother-in-law in 2002, while she was pregnant.

 After returning to Calcutta, she gave birth to a boy, Hritabrata. But her in-laws remained incommunicado.

 In December 2003, Paramita first received a notice from a county court in Texas, asking her to attend a hearing with regard to a divorce petition moved by her husband Biswajyoti.

 ?My daughter couldn?t afford to go across and fight the case. We even wrote to the court concerned. But, in June 2004, the court issued an ex-parte divorce decree in favour of Biswajyoti,? said Das.

 ?My son-in-law earns more than $4,500 a month. A Sealdah court, on the basis of Paramita?s plea, had directed Biswajyoti to pay maintenance to her and her son. But Biswajyoti declined to accept the court order,? added Das.

 So, Paramita went to Alipore court, seeking restoration of marriage. The district sessions judge directed Biswajyoti to attend court.

 ?As he did not turn up on the specific date, the judge passed the interim order restraining him from marrying for a second time,? explained Paramita?s father.

 Legal experts feel the district judge?s order is very significant as it is likely to become a precedent in similar cases, where Bengali women have been deserted by their NRI husbands.

 Estimate pegged at 100 the number of similar cases, in which women were divorced in a similar manner abroad and have sought redress at the Alipore and Barasat courts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I am a resident of Budge Budge for the past 30 years. Over this period, I have not seen any improvement in the condition of Budge Budge Trunk Road. The potholes on the road were recently filled up with a stone chip-tar mixture. But all the effort went waste with a single heavy shower the next day. The road condition has instead worsened. The authorities should concretise Budge Budge Trunk Road as it serves the entire area. It will be a long-term solution to end the woes of the commuters.

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge. 

 A part of Park Street flyover, which is less than a year old, has been blocked to facilitate relaying of the road surface. Why did the need for repairs arise this soon? Appropriate action should be taken if use of low-quality construction material has come to notice.

 Raj Bagri,

 Ho Chi Minh Sarani. 

 Apropos ?Educated lapse? published in this column on August 20, many educated Calcuttans suffer from a lack of civic sense. During a visit to a few US cities, I had seen well-to-do people carrying polythene bags while walking the pet. They promptly collect the animal?s faeces in those bags and throw them into garbage bins. In India, the animal-owner would, perhaps, consider it beneath his dignity to do the same. 

 K.B. Goswami, 

 Central Park.

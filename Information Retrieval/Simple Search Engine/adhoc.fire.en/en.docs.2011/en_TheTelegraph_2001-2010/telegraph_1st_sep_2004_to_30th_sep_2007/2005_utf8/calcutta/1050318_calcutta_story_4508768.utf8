Pet passion 

Want a pet? Just download it on your cell phone. As 

easy as A B C. We kid you not, for, boys and girls, the virtual pet has landed 

in town. Whether it?s here to stay or not, only time and your enthusiasm will 

tell. But for now, Goldy and Goldie the goldfish and Rhana the piranha await your 

affection.

Airtel, with its mobile gaming partner Mobile2win, 

launched the service on cell phones on March 7. The craze has caught on in countries 

like Japan and South Korea, and is now in India. 

An Airtel user with GPRS connection just needs to 

download the Mobile Pet from Airtel Live, the multi-access entertainment portal 

on cell phones. Available at the moment is a fish aquarium, but watch out for 

other options coming soon. Carry them everywhere, in your pocket, and play with 

your new friends whenever, wherever.

After downloading your very own pet, the fishy friends 

will need constant care and attention. Feed them, clean the tank and play with 

them to score credits and buy new toys for your virtual aquarium. There are snails 

to feed Rhana the piranha and gold dust for Goldy and Goldie the goldfish.

If you forget to feed the little creatures, you might 

lose them to starvation, just like real fish. There are designated feeding times, 

while the virtual water in the virtual fish tank needs to be changed at regular 

intervals. Oh, and playing with them is essential, too. Neglect the fish and they 

will die. 

To get another pet fish, customers will have to download 

it again from Airtel Live. The cost of your new best friend is between Rs 50 and 

Rs 99 per download. 

Rajiv Hiranandani, country head of Mobile2win, says: 

?With the rollout of the Mobile Pet, India has entered into the territory of mass 

market ?fun? Java applications. Java applications like these are ?sticky?, as 

consumers come back every day to feed and grow their pet.? 

According to Atul Bindal, chief marketing officer 

and director, Bharti Cellular Ltd: ?Customers are increasingly looking for new 

means to be engaged and entertained through their mobile devices... It would redefine 

the mobile telephony experience of all our customers.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Why is traffic not diverted on roads that are flooded because of heavy downpours? 

That would, to an extent, solve the snarls caused by slow-moving traffic on these 

roads. With the aid of their walkie-talkies, the traffic sergeants could easily 

coordinate which roads are to be closed to traffic and for how long. Besides the 

waterlogging, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s conservancy staff are nowhere 

to be seen on rainy days. As a result, roadside garbage further clogs the rainwater 

outlets.

 At present, there is a lot of brouhaha about the eviction of squatters along 

the railway tracks at Dhakuria Lakes. But the railway authorities are failing 

to notice that the number of shanties is increasing along the tracks near Nangi 

railway station. Twenty years from now, they too, will demand land for rehabilitation.

 A temple surrounding a banyan tree, with a concrete altar, has come up on the 

pavement of Maniktala Main Road at the Kankurgachhi intersection. It is said that 

a promoter has built the temple to gain the support of some local people. If not 

demolished at this juncture, the structure would forever encroach upon public 

property.

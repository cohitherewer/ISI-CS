 Miniature modernist

 The descendant of a family of traditional Bikaner painters, Mahaveer Swami has revived the finest aspects of the sophisticated and refined Bikaner school of art in his paintings. Displaying originality and brilliance, unique among contemporary miniaturists, his works serve as the perfect medium for connecting the artistic techniques, as well as the worlds of the past and present. Tradition and Continuity, the ongoing exhibition of miniature paintings by Swami, provides an interesting insight into the moods and motivations of the artist as he paints picturesque stories of religion and rationality, legend and life. Using colours ground by hand from stones and minerals, the artist has worked exclusively on fine antique paper, many collected by his father for generations. Tracing the evolution of the miniature style of painting, Swami?s works reflect a strong influence of his extensive study of Mughal miniatures. His subjects, often drawn from the life-study of holy men and women, possess an artless, unaffected character that gives them an endearing quality.

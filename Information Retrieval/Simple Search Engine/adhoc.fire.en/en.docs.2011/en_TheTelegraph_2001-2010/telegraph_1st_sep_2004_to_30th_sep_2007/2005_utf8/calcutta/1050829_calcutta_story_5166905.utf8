 Transit point for fake notes

 - Counterfeit racket operators use city to meet contacts 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city is fast becoming a transit point for an increasing number of ISI operatives engaged in circulating fake notes across the country, the CID claimed on Sunday. 

 The operatives are using the city to meet their contacts, to whom they hand over consignments of fake notes. 

 While the notes are meant to be distributed across the country, the thrust areas of circulation are parts of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and New Delhi. Sleuths from the CID stumbled upon this while interrogating Selim, alias Hazi, a key ISI agent in the fake note racket.

 Hazi, rounded up in Howrah on Saturday, was one of the operators who would turn up at designated places to receive consignments from his contacts.

 ?Hazi, it appears, had come to the city on a few occasions to receive consignments of fake notes,? said CID deputy inspector-general Rajeev Kumar. ?He has also been to Delhi and other cities on orders from the kingpins of the racket. We are interrogating him to get details of his links in the city.?

 Investigations have revealed that Hazi worked under instructions from Mohammed Firoz, a Pakistani national recently arrested by Mumbai Police on charges of leading a gang that used to spread fake notes ? in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 ? in several places of the country.

 In Calcutta, the CID had stumbled upon Firoz?s name while probing the links of Sankar Acharya, a former blood bank employee, who was arrested at his Lake View Road house on March 2 after packets of fake notes were found in his briefcase on his return from Bangladesh. 

 Rattled at the superior quality of the fakes, the sleuths later concluded that these were printed in Karachi. Soon after Acharya?s arrest, sleuths raided a hideout in Akhilbandhu Lane, under Howrah?s Golabari police station, in search of Firoz, but had failed to nab him. 

 Firoz, reportedly, was scheduled to collect the notes from Acharya and leave the city. 

 Officers maintain that Hazi was a close associate of Firoz and came here on his instructions. 

 ?Firoz would instruct Hazi to turn up at a designated place and receive the packets, which would then be handed over to other links in the racket,? an officer said.

 Though cops have not found any fake note in Hazi?s possession, officers believe he possesses crucial information about the ISI network dealing in fake notes in eastern India.

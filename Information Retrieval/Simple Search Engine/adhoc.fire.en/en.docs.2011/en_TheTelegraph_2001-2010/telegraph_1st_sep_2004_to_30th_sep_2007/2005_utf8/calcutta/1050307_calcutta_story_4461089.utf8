 Kallol Dasgupta: Can you please explain how VAT can be calculated?

 Calculation of VAT depends on several factors. However, I can give you an example through which you can see how easy it is to calculate the tax. Let us assume raw materials worth Rs 1 lakh were purchased at a tax rate of four per cent. Let us consider that goods worth Rs 2 lakh were made out of the purchased raw materials, and those were sold within a month clubbed with a tax of 10 per cent. Now input tax paid is Rs 4,000 (four per cent of Rs 1 lakh) while the output tax is Rs 20,000 (10 per cent of Rs 2 lakh). VAT payable during the month is Rs 16, 000 (Rs 20,000 minus Rs 4,000).

 Using this method, one can easily calculate how much tax he or she has incurred. Please note that as the trader had already paid an input tax while buying the goods, therefore the sum was deducted from the output tax while calculating VAT. Thus the hassle of double taxation is avoided.

 Santa takes to the skies 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Airlines are pulling out all the stops to make Calcuttans fly with them this Christmas.

 While Singapore Airlines is focussing on in-flight entertainment and comfort, special festive cuisine is the draw for Kingfisher Airlines. Thai Airways has taken the traditional route with reduced fare to Bangkok. 

 The array of treats and surprises lined up for the patrons of Singapore Airlines include both live and recorded entertainment. The Tweenies, Hi-5 and Barney will belt out carols for kids, while vocalist Katherine Jenkins will croon Christmas favourites for grown-ups. 

 Hit films listed under Christmas, like Christmas with the Kranks, The Polar Express and the 1945-classic Christmas in Connecticut, will be shown on board to help the travellers rev up the yuletide spirit.

 ?We are offering a lot of surprises for Calcuttans flying in December. The idea is to make them feel at home during Christmas,? said Bharat Mahadevan, manager (East) for the airline.

 Thai Airways is offering a return ticket to Bangkok for Rs 7,600 on Tuesdays and Sundays. Return air tickets to Sydney, Brisbane or Melbourne, from the city, would cost Rs 27,500 during the month.

 ?We are constantly trying to improve connectivity, especially keeping in mind Calcuttans planning to take connecting flights from Bangkok,? stated S.C. Kapoor, district sales manager (Calcutta), Thai Airways.

 The airline has recently started operations to Islamabad and Moscow. A round-trip to Moscow is being offered at a special price of Rs 35,000 by Thai Airways.

 ?Apart from this, in-flight hospitality is the key for us. The Royal Silk class has been a big hit with Calcuttans,? said Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, general manager (Calcutta), Thai Airways.

 Taking the domestic airlines head on for the tourist buck is Kingfisher Airlines. It is set to start operations to Mumbai from Friday.

 Every seat on the airline is fitted with screens for personalised entertainment. The airline also offers personalised menu cards and gift hampers.

 The Mumbai service of the airline will be twice daily. The return fare will be about Rs 8000.

 ?With Kingfisher joining the city aviation map, there is serious competition among the domestic airlines. The latest entrant has already grabbed a sizeable portion of the market,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (East) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

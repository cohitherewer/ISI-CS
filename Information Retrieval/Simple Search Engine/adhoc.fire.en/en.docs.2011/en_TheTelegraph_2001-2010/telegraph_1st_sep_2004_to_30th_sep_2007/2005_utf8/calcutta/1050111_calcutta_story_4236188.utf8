Small splendour

Sangita Sultania G. Roy finds out 

ways to turn a matchbox apartment into a multi-dimensional wonder

If you aren?t part of the nether world nor share the 

stratospheric fantasies of showbiz, chances are you?re cooped up in a matchbox 

on earth to call home. But then they say it?s all in the mind, a free run of the 

imagination is all you need really to add volume to limited space and turn it 

into a multi-dimensional wonder. 

Slim fit

In-built furniture, box beds and sofa-cum-beds have 

been the staple in most modern apartments cramped for space for some time now, 

with special emphasis on making optimum use of the wall space available. 

?In a standard 1,000-sq-ft apartment in the numerous 

highrises mushrooming in and around the city, you can?t really afford the luxury 

to have the kind of elaborate wooden furniture, however elegant they might look, 

handed down from your grandparents? era,? says John Bose, scouting for a slim 

dining set for his cosy pad in Neelachal complex on the EM Bypass-Gariahat connector. 

Widespread use of new-age materials like wrought iron, 

matte-finished white metal and steel in home furniture, instead of the conventional 

wood, is a direct result of shrinking living space. 

Custom made

The real challenge, however, lies in thinking up customised 

furniture, veering away from the standard bedroom sets of a king-size bed, two 

side tables, dressing table and stool, wardrobes and possibly an additional seating 

or writing area. 

?Only the very lucky today can afford the kind of 

space to accommodate all this,? says interior designer Anita Mansata. ?The trick 

lies in utilising the nooks and crannies of your house to best advantage, apart 

from using multi-purpose cabinets and common areas,? adds Anita. 

She shows off a bar-cum-study area as an example in 

a corner of her own house (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). Here she has used 

a wooden chest with a glass top to stock the liquor, with a wooden rack on top 

holding glasses that catch the tint of halogen lights on the low ceiling to beautiful 

effect. A chair reclined at a comfortable angle stands in between this and book 

cupboards made by covering an in-built area in the wall with colourful blue and 

green glass. 

Yet another example of good use of available space 

at her Alipore residence is a little loft room on the mezzanine floor. An elevated 

nook overlooking the garden behind has been turned into a seating space. A couple 

of colourful cushions on the floor and hanging lights have been used to charming 

effect here.

Screen test

Low partitions to conceal the cupboard area and use 

of screens and facades to separate key zones in the house are some other ways 

to save on space, suggests Anita. 

?Walls needn?t be the only way to partition sections 

in your house. The use of wooden screens or glass facades to separate the living 

and the dining area, for example, is an alternative to concrete walls. This allows 

flexibility to play around with interiors as and when the needs of the family 

change. Besides, the use of frosted and coloured glass features makes a small 

space look bigger and lighter,? she elaborates. 

In this vein, she also vouches for the use of predominantly 

light paints for the walls with maybe one wall in a darker shade to break the 

visual monotony and make a room look bigger than it actually is. 

Wall to wall

Behind-the-door cabinets and maximum use of wall space 

is advised by other homemakers. 

?When I got married, the bedroom in my new house was 

really small and there wasn?t enough room to pack in a separate dressing table 

and cabinet. So I got the neighbourhood carpenter to design a multipurpose cabinet 

for me,? says Shweta Suri, a resident of Salt Lake. 

The cabinet packs in a small wardrobe, chest of drawers, 

space to park the television, the DVD player, and a dressing area as well. This 

includes a glass door that opens to reveal racks to stock cassettes on top. There 

are wider shelves in the lower half to keep toiletries and make-up. 

Apart from this, there is barely room for a double 

bed, two side tables and an almirah in the room. ?I didn?t know where to keep 

my books, so I got the carpenter to make me a series of wooden racks to be fitted 

on the wall, in steps,? adds Shweta. 

Apart from holding books, she has used this to display 

other utility and decorative knick-knacks and a touch of green by way of an indoor 

plant. ?The feature looks like a quaint oasis, breaking the monotony of the stark 

wall in a unique way,? Shweta feels. 

Interior designer Manjari Sahay suggests the use of 

a mounted mirror on the wall with maybe a shelf or two in front of it to stock 

cosmetics. ?Floor space is sacred in modern housing, so use it with care,? says 

Manjari. 

She also recommends the use of storage space under 

dining tables with drawers. 

Dual role

Two-in-one furniture is another way to increase the 

space available. Use of bunk beds and sofa-cum-beds or divans with headrests in 

the living area are some of the common practices to make up for the lack of a 

guest room or an additional children?s bedroom. 

Newer options to make up for the lack of library space 

in most Indian homes include having easy access to a spacious loft via a sturdy 

ladder. If it allows you to sit in a comfortable position without bumping your 

head, you can even turn it into a study area, above the din of worldly affairs. 

Pack in some basic electrical fittings and comfortable rugs. 

You don?t really have to go for a complete overhaul 

of interiors to add or subtract a practical feature. ?Matching all the furniture 

to the T is passe, the mix and match look is in,? feels Anita.

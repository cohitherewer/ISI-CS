 Palsy school sees new dawn ahead

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 How has Calcutta changed in 31 years? Is it more sensitised or better-equipped to deal with disabilities like cerebral palsy? 

 The Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) seems to recognise a more positive attitude. From November 14 to 17, students of the institute will commemorate its 31st anniversary with ?Calcutta on the Move?, a multimedia presentation, at P35/1, Taratala Road (near Marine Engineering College). 

 On November 14, the institute will also launch its website. ?Computers have worked wonders for our students. Initially, we used to get gadgets through our friends abroad, but now, we are developing them here with the help of Jadavpur University and IIT Kharagpur,? said Subhra Chatterjee, head of communication services.

 ?The Katha-Mala voice output communication aid is for children with severe speech and multiple disorders. We have taken care to procure various special software and equipment. We have provisions that allow students to operate machines with their palms instead of fingers, the eye-blink instead of tongue,? added Chatterjee.

 ?There was a time when public attitude was really bad but now, thanks to more awareness, we can hope that our students will someday be accepted in all spheres because they deserve to be, and not out of pity,? said Chatterjee.

 The institute has certainly come a long way. Back in 1974, Sudha Kaul, Perin Aibara and a few others launched the (then) Spastics Society of Eastern India in the modest rooms of the Ballygunge Army camp. 

 The founding team had no experience and little resources but their genuine urge to help, took them forward. From just two students, the society (now called the IICP and based in Taratala) has 200 regular students and a thousand others on its extended and outpatients list. It is also the proud recipient of the award for ?Best Institute for Persons with Disabilities 2004?, conferred by the ministry of social justice and empowerment. 

 With partners in 17 districts, the IICP offers numerous services, from diagnosis of cerebral palsy to physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, speech therapy and general education. The 100-strong staff also helps in the social rehabilitation and financial empowerment of students, by running courses on silk-screen printing, catering and computers. 

 The institute offers a B.Ed course and training for caregivers, doctors and parents. It also publishes various educational literature. 

 Funds have been a constant problem. ?It is true that we receive a central grant, but that is hardly enough, so we have fundraising campaigns like the one on November 18, called ?Chalti Ka Naam Wheelchair? at Forum. Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi will launch the campaign for the cause of all those who are restricted to the wheelchair but are constantly trying to make the best use of their lives. Donation boxes will also be kept at different venues across the city.

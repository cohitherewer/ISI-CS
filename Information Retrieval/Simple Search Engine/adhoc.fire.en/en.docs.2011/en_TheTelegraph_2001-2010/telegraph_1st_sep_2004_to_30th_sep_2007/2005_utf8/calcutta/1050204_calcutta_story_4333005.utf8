 With the city all geared up to party hard in BED on Wednesday night and frantic phone calls to arrange for passes to this exclusive by-invitation-only do, expectations and starry anticipations soared. And even before the Bollywood brigade descended on this happening address, a sizzling ramp show ? starring Mumbai models showcasing Mumbai designers ? bowled over the Calcutta crowd.

 Sensuous and shimmery, with oodles of shine and sparkle, was the look sported by the creations of Mumbai-based duo Phalguni and Shane Peacock. The show, choreographed by Achala Sachdev, was broken up into three sequences. The models catwalked to racy music with tribal beats every now and then.

 While the designs caught the attention of many, it was the stunning bodies flaunting them that really rocked the party. With 15 of the country?s top models ? Fleur Xavier, Nina Manuel, Jesse Randhawa, Tupur Chatterjee, Candice Pinto, Gauhar Khan and Deepti Gujaral to name a few ? ruling the ramp, Calcutta certainly got a taste of a top-grade show.

 The city?s glam presence was sidelined, to put it politely. What else do you call it when a clutch of Calcutta ramp walkers cuts a forlorn figure while the Mumbai beauties hog the spotlight?

 The action on the ramp started off with a line of assymetrical skirts ? long at the back and short in front ? in rich hues, mostly imbibing gold, silver and bronze textures. Intricate embroidery and striking embellishments in the form of crystals, beads and glasswork completed the look of the tight-fitting bustier tops that provided a contrast to the flowing fabrics below the waistline.

 The second sequence titled Short and Sexy was true to its name with plunging necklines in chiffons, georgettes and crepes, paired with rugged denims, be it skirts or jeans, to achieve a somewhat femme fatale effect. Stones of different shapes and sizes, net and lots of lace completed the effect on the ensembles.

 The third sequence came with tribal effects in a somewhat twisted, teasing manner in the form of tiger prints, floral and leafy kaftans and ponchos on sheer fabrics.

 The final act of the show used plenty of laces, hemlines and Oriental fusion patterns. The colours were both bright and pastel.

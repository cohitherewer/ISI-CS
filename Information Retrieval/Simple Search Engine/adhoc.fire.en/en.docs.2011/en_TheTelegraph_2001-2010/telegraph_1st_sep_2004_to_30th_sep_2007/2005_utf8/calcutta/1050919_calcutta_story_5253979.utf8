 Samiran Mondal, 16, is up early every morning to go to work. He either gives tuitions to kids in his part of Ranihati, or helps his farmer father in the paddy fields. Sometimes, he misses school to supplement the family income of less than Rs 1,000 per month. The Mondals have no electricity, with brother and sister (in Class VI) having to study by the light of a lantern.

 Yet, Samiran earned 79.3 per cent in the Madhyamik exam this year, and is now an arts student in Class XI. He wants to study English honours, his dream is to be a teacher. With a little help from The Telegraph Education Foundation (TTEF), Samiran is on his way to being just that.

 The first phase of The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence was held at Hariyana Vidya Mandir, in Salt Lake, on Sunday morning, in association with Adamas International School and Bengal Peerless. Twenty-two scholarships were handed out to deserving candidates like Samiran.

 As the humble yet determined girls and boys trotted up on stage to the sound of emotional applause, their stories inspired the audience, young and old.

 The annual event has been split into two halves from last year, with a rise in the number of scholarships. In 2004, for the prelude, there were 18 scholarships. This time, there are 22.

 There were plenty of young bravehearts at Sunday?s ceremony, like Mina Biswas and Raksona Mondal, the first two girls from Ranihati High School to pass Madhyamik in the first division, says proud teacher Asit Ray. 

 Mina?s first love was science, but there wasn?t enough money to pursue it, she says with a sad smile. ?I did have a dream? there is no point talking about it now,? she sighs. But her eyes light up when she talks about being a teacher, happy to at least be able to continue her education, even as an arts student. 

 She doesn?t want to end up jobless like her BA-pass elder brother. Mina?s father might be a farmer, but he knows the importance of education and supports his children in their efforts.

 Hariyana Vidya Mandir teachers sponsor 11 scholarships, having raised Rs 66,000 this year, up from Rs 65,000 in the past two years, from their own salaries. There were some captive listeners in the audience on Sunday who were moved by the proceedings and wanted to contribute, added Barry O?Brien.

 It?s not really surprising, with stories of fighting all odds, like that of Suryatapa Barik from East Midnapore. Her father, a farmer and day labourer, fell gravely ill last year with blood sugar around the time of her Madhyamik exams. 

 The youngster nursed her father back to health, missing the Madhyamik pass mark. A long silence is followed by a soft ?ami bolte chai na (I don?t want to talk about it)?, when asked about her struggle. But with the help of a private tutor, Suryatapa is determined to pass the exam in 2006 and study history in college.

 In the refusal to give up and admit defeat lies the winning streak in these children. Like Srijit Das from Baruipur, North 24-Parganas, who passed Madhyamik 2005 with 662 marks. His father lost his job in a factory in 2003 and now gives tuitions to needy students. Srijit wants to study physics.

 Then there are the Gupta brothers from Chakraberia High School, the youngest scholarship winners at the ceremony. The younger Aman, in Class VII, wants to be a pilot. The older Akash, in Class VII, has aspirations of being a football player.

 Their father, a marble workman, is an alcoholic and contributes little to the household. Mother Rekha is the driving force in the family. She works as an ayah and utilises her creativity to design and make soft toys, which she sells for a few extra rupees. Her monthly income is around Rs 300. The Guptas live in a slum. 

 But both brothers rank nothing less than first in class and are good in sports. Aman is a budding singer, Akash is an accomplished artist. English is their favourite subject.

 There will be more such stories of courage and conviction at the awards ceremony at Science City on September 28, where the chief guest will be Infosys chairman Narayan Murthy, after Manmohan Singh in 2003 and Sonia Gandhi in 2004.

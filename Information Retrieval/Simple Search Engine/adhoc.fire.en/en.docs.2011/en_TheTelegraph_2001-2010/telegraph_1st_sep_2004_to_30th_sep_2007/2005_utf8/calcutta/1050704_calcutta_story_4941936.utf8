The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Love is mightier than valour

 Continuing its experimentation with different performing genres like dance, song, music and poetry, Nandikar?s Bappaditya fuses these diverse elements into a unified dramatic design, to offer a distinctive narrative style and a unique viewing experience. Based on a story from Abanindranath Tagore?s Rajkahini, the play traces the life and adventures of its eponymous protagonist. More than a story of courage and heroism, replete with the history, myths and fairytales of Rajasthan, Bappaditya presents a fascinating study of the varying moods of the human mind. Above all, it unfolds a tale of eternal love; a love that outlives wars and bloodshed, the triumphs and failures of mortal life, and even conquers death. Performed by Sohini Sengupta Halder. Direction: Goutam Halder.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Bappaditya, produced by Nandikar

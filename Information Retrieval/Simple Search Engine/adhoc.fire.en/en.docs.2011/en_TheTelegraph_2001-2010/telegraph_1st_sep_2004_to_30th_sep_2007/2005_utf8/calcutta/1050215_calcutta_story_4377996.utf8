 The partially-demolished Currency Building in BBD Bag is all set to get a new lease of life.

 After nearly seven years, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which was originally in charge of it and went out of its way to pull it down to erect a highrise there, has at last agreed to hand over possession of the 150-year-old building to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), that was supposed to take it over long ago.

 The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), which had prepared the entire restoration plan and handed it over to the CPWD before the ASI took it over, had pursued the case all along. 

 It had written to the ministry of urban development, which is in charge of the CPWD, Arun Bhattacharya, principal secretary to the chief minister, and Gautam Sengupta, director of the state archaeology, to take positive action.

 At long last, the ministry of urban development has directed the CPWD to hand over possession of Currency Building to the ASI. 

 The blue enamel plaques declaring that it was a protected monument of national importance were put up two years ago on the busy pavement of BBD Bag. Scaffolding, too, was erected, and masons had started work. 

 Part of the pavement around Currency Building was fenced off, so that they could not be used any longer as open-air urinals.

 The masons had partially skinned the plaster near the grand main entrance. Then one day, unannounced, the work stopped. The jungle that had invaded the terrace of Currency Building and its demolished insides grew taller and wilder.

 In February 1993, the ASI was getting ready to begin restoration work on the heritage building. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) cleared the barricades on the pavements along Currency Building, and also the mound of debris accumulated around the building. 

 But the work could not continue, for the CPWD refused to hand over Currency Building. The ASI wrote several times to the CPWD, but in vain.

 The barricade around Currency Building was erected for public safety seven years ago, when the Central government engaged a private contractor to demolish the 150-year-old heritage structure. 

 The CPWD contractor had demolished the massive central dome of the building. When the contractor?s security men used to be in charge of the partially-demolished building, much valuable materials, like Italian marble, Burma teak and iron chests, had been smuggled out.

 According to an estimate by engineers of the municipal architect and town planner?s department, material worth more than Rs 2 crore has been sold secretly from the Currency Building site. The edifice housed the countrys first Reserve Bank, where currency notes were printed. 

 The CPWD was supposed to hand over possession of the building by January 15. But according to ASI sources, it was logistically impossible to do so, for an inventory has to be first made of the large quantity of material still there before final takeover.

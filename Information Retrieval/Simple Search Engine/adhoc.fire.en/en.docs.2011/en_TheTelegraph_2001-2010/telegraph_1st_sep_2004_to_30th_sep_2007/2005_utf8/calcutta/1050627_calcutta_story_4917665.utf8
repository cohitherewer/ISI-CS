 Jai Lakshmi, a 25-year-old sari shop near Triangular Park that has been draping its wide clientele in exclusive weaves from South India, is heading towards a richer market of Bengalis overseas.

 The saris are heading first to Banga Sammelan, scheduled to be held this year from July 1 in New York, before moving on to the Bangla Mela in Chicago on July 22 and 23.

 This is the second year we will be participating in the three-day Banga Sammelan where Bengalis from across the US get together for a booster dose of everything Bengali, explains Rajesh Lachwani of the store.

 Woven at looms in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the Jai Lakshmi range includes Gadwals, Valkalams, Kanjeeverams, temple saris, summer brocades, tissues and crepes. 

 Though South Indian weaves come mostly in bright colour combinations, we have included pastel shades, whites and creams to suit the urban sensibility, adds Lachwani. 

 At the store, prices start at Rs 400, but the pieces being taken to the US are at the higher end of the range. 

 The only departure from the southern roots are the Bhagalpur weaves embroidered with zardosi. 

 We try to innovate on design while keeping the traditional look intact, explains Lachwani.

 Once back from the US, Jai Lakshmi will open its second store in the city on Rashbehari Avenue.

 Bolly beat

 Red Kitchen and Lounge in Alipore hosted a Bollywood theme party on Saturday evening. Pictures of classic oldies and popular new flicks shared space at the entrance of the club and inside, in sync with the Bombay Matinee theme.

 Rock and house music might be preferred by some, but when it comes to dancing, peppy Bollywood numbers top the charts. So Red decided to dedicate an evening to the spirit of Bollywood.

 Songs like Woh lamhe, Kuan ma doob jaoongi, Dekhle, Bindas and Dhoom machale kept the party rocking, as did remixes like Neele neele ambar and Tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam, perennial favourites with the party people.

 Go green

 Flower power was in full bloom at Virgose, the nightclub at the HHI. But the Saturday night bash was no tribute to the hippie spirit. Rather it was part of the eco-friendly week being observed at the AJC Bose Road hotel.

 We have taken some healthy and hygienic measures in Virgose, the resto-bar, which are going to continue for a week, said a hotel spokesperson.

 The couples who entered the resto-bar were welcomed with flowers, and the lighting at the venue was predominantly green.

 But for entertainment, all eyes were fixed on the television screens, with the Brazil-Germany showdown making for quite a nail-biting Confederations Cup semi-final.

 Some, however, were more interested in doing some footwork themselves and the usual dance numbers played by DJs Craig and Carlotta kept them moving.

 Ramp watch

 Ordnance Club hosted a fashion show featuring the designs of Nikesh Solani on Saturday night. The young entrepreneur completed a design course at Bhawanipur Education Society before opening Tanis, a boutique on Allenby Road.

 I was supplying garments to stores across the city when I thought it would be better to have all my creations under one roof. So, Tanis happened, says Solani. The show featured sherwanis, saris, kurtis and shirts in jute, linen, crepe and brocade.

 Licences for cooks, tutors and cobblers

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Next time you hire a tutor, a marriage negotiator, a domestic help or anyone from the unorganised sector, check out whether he/she has a licence from Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The civic body has decided to issue licences to all members of the unorganised sector, except sex workers.

 ?I am not against issuing trade enlistment certificates or trade licences to sex workers, but the move requires recognition of the profession by the state labour department,? mayor Subrata Mukherjee said on Friday.

 A trade licence, to be valid for a year, will cost Rs 60. Professionals to be entitled for a licence include private tutors, kitchen help, cobblers and ayahs. 

 The civic authorities have recently published a list of 82 categories of professionals who can apply for a trade license. Featuring on the list are freelance journalists, freelance photographers, authors, columnists, event managers, astrologers, dancers, jockeys and notary public. 

 The mayor, however, pointed out that it was not mandatory for the professionals to be enlisted as such. ?The authorities have come forward to recognise their service, which will help them in the future to get clients,? Mukherjee explained.

 He felt a day would come when citizens, for their own safety, would insist on a civic licence before engaging a cook or an ayah. 

 Despite repeated appeals, police have failed to convince Calcuttans to record the names of domestic help or car drivers and submit them to the nearest thana.

 According to an estimate, the city is serviced by over 20 lakh professionals of the unorganised sector. If the licence system is implemented as planned, the civic coffer will be benefitted by more than Rs 10 crore a year.

 Chief municipal auditor Tapas Guhathakurata said the licence would only mention the profession, not the place from where the individual operates. Hence, a licence issued to a hawker would not amount to approving his place of work, even if it is occupied illegally.

 The licence department will record all personal data of a licensed professional. If a professional lives outside the city, he/she will have to produce a residence certificate from a gazetted officer or the local thana or the local municipality or panchayat.

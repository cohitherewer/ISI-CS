The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A dynamic tradition

 Staging Charandas and planning Biswarjan, Habib Tanvir is immersed in the dramatic element, as always, says Sebanti Sarkar

 One can?t come to the end of one?s life without having lots of work left undone? but I am satisfied,? says Habib Tanvir, the living legend of Indian theatre.

 But it would be a mistake to think that this octogenarian is content just basking in the glory of his creativity. Even between the quiet sips of masala nimbu chai in the Rabindra Sadan VIP lounge, you sense that keen mind working overtime on his next production, Rabindranath Tagore?s Biswarjan in Hindi.

 While Calcutta?s theatre crowd was thronging to see Charandas Chor and splitting sides at Ponga Pandit (two classic Naya Theatre productions that featured in the recent theatre festival hosted by Panchali), Tanvir was busy working out details of the big one, Biswarjan.

 Collaborating with him is the play?s translator Usha Ganguly and her team Rangakarmee. ?There will be an equal number of actors from Rangakarmee and Naya Theatre. We will be rehearsing in Calcutta till January,? explains Tanvir, puffing at his pipe. ?Suresh Dutta, more well known for his puppets, is doing the sets, Tapas Sen is of course in charge of lights, and the costumes have been entrusted to Zarine Choudhury,? he adds.

 The play will premiere in Delhi on January 5 followed by shows in Calcutta from January 14-19.

 Tanvir has been the acknowledged pioneer of interest in folk forms and traditions in theatre. While admitting that his ?attitude to folk traditions has not changed?, Tanvir points out that ?folk traditions themselves are not static, they keep changing but they also have a continuity and allow one to look at our dramatic sources?.

 But how different will this latest rendition of Tagore?s Biswarjan be? Will the actors speak Chhattisgarhi? ?No, this will be in simple Hindi, though with some touches of its many rural dialects,? clarifies Tanvir. Music may likewise carry folk influences. ?I am very open about music, there will be folk music but from different places,? says the director, adding that Rabindrasangeet does not exactly top the priority list for this production.

 He is, however, all praise for Tagore. Explaining his choice of Biswarjan, Tanvir says: ?This is a very powerful play, it takes a strong stand against blind superstition and violence. It is very dramatic and displays a spiritual richness and sensitivity. The characters are so complex, that it is a great challenge. What is elaborated in Tagore?s prose version Rajarshi is here tightly packed into the many layers of conflict between state and religion, love and freedom, individual and church?Tagore was a great dramatist as well as a wonderful writer of prose. Biswarjan has not lost its relevance over time, its protest is just as valid today.?

 The Calcutta audience, he feels, is very perceptive, ?always on the lookout for good plays and when they find one they don?t let go?, unlike in Delhi and other places. 

 Tanvir sincerely believes that the business of theatre ?has always been and still is to reflect life, to pick up the evils of society and portray them in a stimulating and artistic manner?. 

 Theatre is always anti-establishment, he stresses. ?Like all art forms, theatre calls for perseverance, constant practice is the main thing and the final test and touchstone is the audience.?

 The lack of sustained support for theatre performers rankles. Both state and individuals should be willing ?to sink in money without strings attached?. It is also important to try and safeguard our cultural heritage. 

 ?No one seems to have a clue. Government claims reek of hypocrisy; their policy is a divisive one. They don?t have the vision and are not interested because this has no vote bank.?

 As he gets busy discussing costumes with Zarine Choudhury, one gets a closer glimpse of things to come. ?For Jaisingh, I see a blood red dhoti and scarf, Partha Sarathy (Sarkar, of Rangakarmee) is fair and will look good in red. Raja Govindomanikko (probably to be played by Rama Shankar Dubey) will wear white and his mukut must be of oxidised silver?very bold jewellery for the Rani and striped ghagras for the six dancers. The old temple of Tripureshwari will be covered by gauze, which will at times hide it from view??

 One leaves Habib Tanvir, as ever, in the dramatic element immersed.

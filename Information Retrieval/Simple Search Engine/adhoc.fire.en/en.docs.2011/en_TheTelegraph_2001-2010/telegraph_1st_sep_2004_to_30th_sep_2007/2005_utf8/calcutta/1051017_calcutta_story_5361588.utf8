 Teenager drowns during immersion

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Once the Puja was over, he would concentrate on studies, Suvo Dey had promised his parents. Moments before he left their Justice Manmatha Mukherjee Road residence, near Sealdah flyover, for the immersion of the para idols on Friday, the teenager had told his father that he would give up games and adda till his Madhyamik exams were over.

 On Sunday, Suvo?s body was brought back to the para. He was the first to drown during this year?s Puja immersions. Bathers spotted the floating body near the Man O? War jetty. 

 ?After the immersion was over on Friday evening, Suvo and three of his para friends decided to take a dip in the Hooghly. The seniors weren?t around to stop them. Around 9 pm, the friends informed Suvo?s family that he was missing,? said Shyamal Chowdhury, a neighbour of the Deys.

 A Class X student of Adarsha Vidyamandir, Suvo ? or Laltu, as he was fondly called ? always wanted to see the Puja immersion from up close. So, when the organisers of the modest puja on a winding lane off Kaizer Street left for Babughat with the idols in a Matador van, he accompanied them enthusiastically.

 Suvo?s father Sadhan, mother and younger brother Samrat stayed back. The organisers first went to Babughat, but since it was too crowded, moved to Gwalior ghat. Around 8 pm, they managed to find a spot to immerse their idols. 

 ?It was high tide. We had been moving around in our launches warning everyone to be very careful during the immersion. The ghats were well-lit and the puja organisers seemed cautious. Around 9.30 pm, we were told that a boy was missing. Personnels of the Disaster Management Group immediately started looking for him, but in vain,? said a senior officer of the River Traffic Police. 

 Suvo?s friends said he had rolled up his vest to take it off before entering the water, when he lost his balance and was borne away by the strong current. His friends, too, fell into the water. 

 ?Those collecting the wooden structures of the idols rescued us, while one of us managed to swim back. Laltu didn?t know how to swim and just drifted away. We could see him for some time, but then he disappeared under the water,? said Krishanu Das, one of Suvo?s friends. 

 The next day, the neighbours of the teens scanned the ghats for signs of him. On a similar mission on Sunday, they were told at the Gwalior ghat that a bloated body had been spotted near the Man O? War jetty.

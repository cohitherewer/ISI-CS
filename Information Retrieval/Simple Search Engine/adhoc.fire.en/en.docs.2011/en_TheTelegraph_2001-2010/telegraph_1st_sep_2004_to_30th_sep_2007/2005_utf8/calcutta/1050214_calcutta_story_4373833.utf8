Love knows no boundaries and age definitely does not matter. It was time for mommy-daddy to relive their own brand of mush at Tollygunge Club on Saturday, leaving Sunny and Tina to their own devices. 

 derly couples grooved to golden oldies in the serene environs of the Far Pavilion Lawn at the Cupid in Chicago evening organised in association with The Telegraph in the run-up to Valentine?s Day. 

 The annual bash is eagerly awaited and dominated exclusively by the 40-plus crowd. ?We felt the older crowd might feel slightly uncomfortable in most V-Day celebrations dominated by the younger lot. Thus we thought of organising this event five years ago where senior members can chill at their own pace,? says Arunava Chakravarty, deputy managing member of the club. 

 Singer Francis Lepcha kept the nostalgia alive with sixties and seventies melodies like Sacrifice, Hello, I?ll cry instead and You can?t do that. The mood got a little more upbeat thereafter with DJs Bunty and Shakey taking matters in their own hands, churning out some faster tracks. 

 And when the members took a break, it was the turn of the dance troupe Broadway to present a close dance sequence, dressed in shimmering red and white costumes.

 Love bites

 With love resting on the shop racks more than anywhere else, don?t be surprised if ?I shall never stop loving you? turns out to be the name of a cake rather than a V-Day dialogue issuing from the lips of your sweetheart. And that?s precisely the case at Cakes outlets, a new confectionery chain in the city that has shops on Rowdon Street, in Gariahat, Salt Lake City Center and New Alipore.

 True to the mushy names, the Valentine?s day range on offer at the stores has special cakes and pastries bathed in cute pink icing, sugary hearts and flowers ? all to convey love at it?s sweetest best. 

 Priced at Rs 20 onwards, these are sweet on the wallet as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chit Ch@t 

 All about ads 

 Should the Axe deodorant advertisement on television be banned because it promises too much? Is Shah Rukh Khan promoting barbarism by biting off the lips of a hamburger in Oye Bubbly? Does the consumer decide the morality of advertisements? 

 These are three of the many issues discussed threadbare by Xaverians on either side of the stage at the XVIth Fr. Joris Memorial Trophy Nihil Ultra Debate on Saturday, April 30. The motion: In the opinion of the house, ethics in advertising has taken a backseat in the current scenario.

 While Prof N. Viswanathan lamented the decline in moral standards in modern advertising, theatre personality Sumit Roy asserted that a single fish cannot pollute the pond and it is the audience that ultimately decides advertisement content. 

 Reacting to his statement that the proposition had excellent speakers but not a case, corporate lawyer Abhrajit Mitra said that advertising was legalised lie and held forth on how it corrupted people.

 Amitava Dutta of The Telegraph highlighted the business angle of advertising, while bureaucrat Atri Bhattacharya declared: ?I do not buy what I do on the basis of advertising. Give me a break. I have grown up!? 

 Amitava Sinha of Rediff pointed to the moral degeneration in all walks of life, even as Jayshree Mohanka, general manager, Eveready, proclaimed that advertisers were here to sell and not preach. 

 After the battle was over, the panelists addressed queries from the audience before a hung verdict was declared.

 Rhyming it right 

 On a windy, rain-drenched Friday evening, while Calcutta scurried for cover or enjoyed the warmth of the hearth, a hundred-odd youngsters revelled in the monsoon magic on a Lansdowne rooftop, sharing and dissipating their love for poetry. 

 The occasion was the Srijan Youth Poetry Festival, where budding poets showcased their passion and talent before a distinguished panel, comprising the likes of Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Sunil Gangopadhyay. 

 The festival was the culmination of over a month?s hard work by coordinators who sifted through 2,000 plus entries from school and college students to shortlist the works of 54 poets. 

 While Bishwadeep Dasgupta, 15, of Birla High School spoke about how ?time once lost can never be found?, 16-year-old Priyasha Banerjee of Modern High School dedicated her poem Object of Affection to her pet. 

 Among the poets in college, Adwaita Das of JU wondered if Oedipus was right in gouging out his eyes and fellow student Shourya S. Sircar asked God to make him an instrument of divine love, while Suheli Goswami of JD Birla Institute took the audience on a Chromatic journey.

 Purnita Paine of St Xavier?s summed up the mood of the evening in Phoenix: ?Still you breathe, you dream, you soar across the skies/ With the past in your wings and the future in your eyes.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 43 years later, dues cleared

 - WIDOW GETS PENSION ARREARS

 Bela Bhattacharya: Relief at last

 A frail and feeble Bela Bhattacharya, 80, returned home from RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday, happy and content.

 She still cringes in pain and is paralysed below the waist, but what has given her ?mental relief? is the government?s move to clear her family pension, and her dead husband?s pension and gratuity dues , amounting Rs 3.82 lakh. 

 Senior officials have told the widow that her husband?s pension has been deposited in her bank account.

 Bhattacharya is receiving the money 43 years after husband Amulya Chandra was suspended as assistant secretary in the state agriculture department and 12 years after his death. 

 Amulya Chandra?s salary dues, Rs 110,364, were paid to her only last year. The cheque was handed over to the woman by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself. 

 Metro on September 15 had reported the inordinate delay in payment. While handing over the cheque, the chief minister had assured Bhattacharya that the rest of the dues would be paid ?very soon?. 

 A year had passed since then, and lying on the hospital bed, bleeding and paralysed, Bhattacharya told Metro that she only wished to live a little longer to see her dues paid.

 Following the report, the chief minister had reportedly ordered officials to sanction the dues within a couple of days. The office of the accountant-general (Bengal) did, indeed, sanction the amount days after the report was published. Officials even visited Bhattacharya in hospital to get the pension documents signed by her.

 ?We are happy that my mother has finally received the money? She is back home and happy that she will not have to die with the regret of having been wronged,? said Bhattacharya?s son Tarun.

 The woman had written to the chief minister last year, telling him ?tumi amar chheler moto (you are like my son)? and requesting him to see to it that the dues were paid. 

 Despite the delay, she is content that the son-like chief minister had acted on her pleas.

 Sources said Amulya Chandra, who lived in Umakanta Sen Lane, Paikpara, was suspended in 1962 on charges of misplacing a cheque. 

 A criminal case was filed against him the following year. He retired in 1973, still under suspension. 

 The case was disposed of in 1992 and he was acquitted. But till his death in 1993, Amulya Chandra had been receiving only Rs 142 a month as ?provisional pension?.

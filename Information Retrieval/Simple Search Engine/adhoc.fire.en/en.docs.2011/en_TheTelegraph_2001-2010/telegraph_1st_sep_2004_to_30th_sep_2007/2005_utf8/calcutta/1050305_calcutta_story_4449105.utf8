The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Pages from the stage?s past

Ananda Lal raises a toast to a rare display of 

our folk theatre forms and the journey of a group that turned 50

 Naqqals from Punjab performing female impersonation 

at the National Folk Theatre Festival in Salt Lake. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

Pretty boys playing prettier women ... singers pitching 

their voices high at near-breaking point and percussionists pounding the hides 

off their assorted drums... Duhsasana reeling, exhausted by the endless yards 

of Draupadi?s sari that he pulls off, only to see them reel back around her as 

soon as he pauses to take a moment?s breath. Typical scenes from the traditional 

forms that constituted the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre?s week-long National 

Folk Theatre Festival at Salt Lake in the last week of February. 

The city slicker does not get enough exposure to the 

living theatres of the Indian countryside. We know more of Western performance 

than we do about our own rural practitioners. One may ask why on earth we should 

want to know about them ? backward forms steeped in religion and superstition? 

Because knowledge is power; and art rendered invisible by lack of exposure becomes 

powerless for no fault of its own, not having access to the information technology 

and publicity machinery that affluent populations can command. Because it gives 

us glimpses into alternate and pluralistic aesthetic experiences, so that we can 

resist brainwashing by monocultural First World (or even Hindi-medium) concepts 

taught to and beamed at us every day. Because postmodern foreign scholars come 

to India to research these very same ?premodern? forms for what they can gain 

about artistic techniques that the West has lost over the centuries.

Accepting imported realistic and naturalistic acting 

as the USP, the 21st century Indian is alienated from both the exaggerations and 

subtleties of indigenous skills. For instance, the Naqqals of Punjab, who specialise 

in female impersonation and slapstick buffoonery. It is essential for gender experts 

to study how these men present the illusion of being women: some spectators near 

me actually couldn?t tell they were men. However, also what distinguishes the 

?feminine? according to them (the demure look, the pouting of lips, the swaying 

of hips), as well as how we obviously recognise them as male, yet willingly suspend 

our disbelief to view them as female. Then again, the crude duet gags that employ 

a slapstick, literally ? a large leather bat whacked by the superior partner over 

the inferior, who plays the dolt but whose observations invariably hit home and 

receive the slap as their just dessert. 

To illustrate diversity from another troupe at the 

festival, this one from the south, Terukkuttu in Tamil Nadu has many similarities 

in its elaborate, glittering headgear and costumes with Yakshagana and Kathakali, 

but is much more informal and casual. Actors miss cues, enter at the wrong time 

and are chided or beckoned from stage to come on, but we don?t mind, since we 

accept it as wholesome family entertainment. Nobody expects the human impossibility 

of perfection. Indeed, the child?s-eye view epitomises the response to folk forms. 

When the larger-than-life demons rush at the village front row with their tongues 

stuck out, kids scatter in gleeful shock ? an effect that our Western proscenium 

stages can never create. Fun is what it?s all about. In Draupadi Vastraharanam, 

the sad Pandavas looked quite spineless, making vague but limited motions of protest, 

while like a proverbial Indian mother-in-law, Gandhari threatened to beat up Draupadi 

with her fists if she didn?t comply. 

Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre did us a good turn by 

hosting these troupes, but abdicated its responsibility to provide them maximum 

mileage. Having brought them all the way from different parts of the country, 

it should have featured them in mainstream halls within the city for the benefit 

of most Calcuttans, instead of cutting costs with just one show for each at its 

own Bharatiyam complex in Salt Lake. The problem of the disempowered again: would 

EZCC have dared to give this treatment to a famous urban director? 

Golden voyage

Calcutta?s pioneering and longest-surviving Hindi-language 

group, Anamika, began its 50th anniversary celebrations on February 26 at Natya 

Shodh Sansthan, also in Salt Lake. Anamika is to the city?s Hindi theatre what 

Bohurupee is to Bengali theatre. Established in 1955 by like-minded young people 

who had previously dabbled in amateur dramatics, Anamika trailblazed Hindi group-theatre 

here, even inspiring the movement in the north Indian heartland later. Some of 

the founder members, like Pratibha Agrawal and Shyamanand Jalan, are still with 

us; others joined afterwards, including such directors as the late Shivkumar Joshi 

(himself a reputed dramatist in Gujarati), Sheo Jhunjhunwala, Swaran Chaudhry 

and Bimal Lath. Can we hope that, during this golden jubilee year, Anamika will 

initiate a documentation of its journey through in-depth interviews, so that posterity 

will have first-person records of its accomplishments? 

These achievements are not to be treated lightly. 

I wonder if there is any Bengali group that can match Anamika?s tally of 72 full-fledged 

productions in 50 years, not counting one-act plays, children?s theatre, dance 

dramas, musical presentations, play and story readings, poetry recitals, and the 

organisation of several important festivals, seminars and workshops. Anamika staged 

45 of those 72 full-length plays in its peak period, 1966-82, averaging almost 

three per year. In 1973-74, it put up as many as eight new shows! Most big groups 

consider themselves very lucky if they can manage one new production annually. 

A prolific assembly line alone did not characterise 

Anamika?s activities. It dealt in quality theatre. Shyamanand Jalan discovered 

Hindi drama?s modernist genius, Mohan Rakesh, by directing the then-unknown author?s 

Ashadh Ka Ek Din in 1960, and moulding the final shape of Lahron Ka 

Rajhans in rehearsal with Rakesh in 1967, a dramatist-director collaboration 

that opened unexplored possibilities in Indian theatre. He boosted Badal Sircars 

reputation nationally by staging Evam Indrajit and Pagla Ghora in 

Hindi. Pratibha Agrawal remained a pillar throughout, especially as a translator 

and adapter of new Hindi scripts, some dramatised from fiction. Both Jalan and 

she acted brilliantly, too, among many Anamika members. 

With such an illustrious history behind it, Anamika?s 

new offering premiered that evening came as a mild letdown. P.L. Deshpande?s Bechara 

Bhagwan, translated from Marathi by Sudhir Kulkarni, is a short satirical 

farce about an idol of Krishna who starts speaking to devotees in his temple. 

At first they do not know whose voice they are hearing, and blame one another 

for Krishna?s acerbic barbs. Only a blind man identifies the voice. When Krishna 

finally proves his divinity, they immediately pester him for favours. One could 

sympathise with the director, Bimal Lath, who admitted that he had difficulties 

putting a cast together because actors do not have the same commitment they used 

to in the past. The lacklustre performances proved his point. Wanted: young blood 

to restore Anamika to its glory. Qualifications: imaginative vision and tough 

discipline.

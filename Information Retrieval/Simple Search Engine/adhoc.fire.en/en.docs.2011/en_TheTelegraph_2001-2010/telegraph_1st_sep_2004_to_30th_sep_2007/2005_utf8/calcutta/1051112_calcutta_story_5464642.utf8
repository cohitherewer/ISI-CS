 New trucks for garbage

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The city civic body has decided to phase out its old trucks and those owned by the private contractors used for collection of garbage. The replacements will be in conformity with Bharat Stage III norms.

 A directive to this effect has been issued by municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to the chief engineer (conservancy).

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has resolved to use Asian Development Bank (ADB) funds, under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Scheme, to replace at least 60 per cent of the garbage trucks in its fleet. 

 It has placed orders with Ashok Leyland for 62 dumper trucks and two pay-loaders, worth over Rs 6.05 crore.

 A senior officer at the Entally workshop disclosed that the CMC?s 120 trucks were about 20 years old and had been procured with a grant from the Ninth Finance Commission.

 The CMC has also directed the 80-odd conservancy contractors, who own 200 of the trucks used to collect garbage in the city, to replace the vehicles that had been procured before 1990.

 In a meeting on Thursday, some of the big contractors were even asked to procure pay-loaders of their own. One of them, Raju Mehrotra, has already purchased and pressed into service his pay-loader on Brabourne Road and in the Mechhua area.

 On the other hand, the contractors demanded that they be paid a minimum of Rs 200 per tonne of garbage collected. They said that would enable them to approach banks for financing the purchase of new trucks. 

 At present, the CMC pays them between Rs 130 and Rs 150 per tonne of garbage collected, depending upon the distance of the site from the Dhapa dumping grounds.

 The CMC spends Rs 8 crore every year on the conservancy contractors to remove 1,700 tonnes of refuse daily from the city with the aid of 700 labourers. 

 At the same time, it also spends Rs 47 crore a year to remove another 1,700 tonnes by employing its 102 trucks and over 6,000 mazdoors.

 This disparity has forced the civic body to consider deploying the private contractors in more pockets of the city and save on the garbage bill.

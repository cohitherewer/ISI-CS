The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All hell breaks loose when Captain Aman (Jimmy Shergill) falls in love with Valley girl Adaa (Minissha Lamba) in terror-torn downtown Kashmir.

 YAHAAN

 First-time film-maker Shoojit Sircar deserves kudos for successfully treading the middle path between mainstream and real cinema. Blending the ?of course? and the offbeat, he romances the rustic with his meticulous storyboarding. 

 Jimmy is a complete revelation as he emotes effortlessly to pain, pleasure and everything in between. His eyes do more talking than Nana Patekar did in Krantiveer.

 The cinematography is top notch. Swedish cameraman Jakob Ihre gives the film that very-European cold look, which gels brilliantly with the warm contents of the screenplay.

 Shantanu Moitra?s music is another plus in this ensemble enterprise. Naam Adaa likhna and Urzu urzu durkut are soothing to the ears and the picturisation a delight to the eyes.

 Debutante Minnisha?s expressions look exaggerated in most places against the super-restrained Jimmy. You also get tired of the lovely smile at the end of it all.

 The ending is a complete letdown, which resorts to the obvious to reach out to the maximum. It?s too predictable a wish-fulfilment.

 First weekend watch: 63 % at 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi), 50 % at INOX (Forum), 45% at INOX (City Centre)

 Last word: The buzz may be amiss but Yahaan is one little winner which is sure to seduce you from Frame One. Caution: Don?t compare it to Roja.

 Mumbai may well stake claim to the title of marathon mecca, but Calcutta had the look and feel of a city finally on the run on Sunday. 

 The morning found Red Road awash in a sea of white, which then swirled into the streets, making the Airtel The Telegraph Kolkata Marathon, presented by CII and in association with the Athletic Coaches? Association of Bengal, a grand success.

 Serious runners with an eye on the Rs 6.25-lakh prize pie, enthusiasts caught in the spirit of the event and the general public eager to further Calcutta?s sporting cause were all there. 

 As were veteran sportstars, police and civic top bosses, consulate delegates and more of the Calcutta glitterati.

 Technically, it was the third marathon that the city witnessed, but this year?s run was clearly something of a fresh start, particularly in throwing a challenge to Mumbai.

 The crowd started building since early morning, with the longest queue, understandably, at the spot registration counter. 

 Proceedings kicked off with mayor Subrata Mukherjee lighting a torch that led the main marathon.

 Soon after, commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee waved a giant red flag to get the marathon underway. 

 Perking up participants for the gruelling 42.195-km challenge up ahead were schoolchildren blowing conch shells and showering petals.

 ?A fantastic effort,? football legend P.K. Banerjee was heard describing what he saw around him, as he posed for photos with another soccer great and the current sheriff, Chuni Goswami. 

 It was Banerjee?s turn, a little later, along with ABP Pvt Ltd managing director Aniruddha Lahiri, to start off the ladies? race that covered a less-tiring 10.2 km. Leading the ladies was the wife of the US consul-general, Lee Alison Sibley.

 But, perhaps, the most eagerly awaited race was the Fun Run, open to everyone. 

 As the announcer said, one could ?amble, limp, crawl or walk? the 4.2-km stretch, or even give up mid-way, since it was the spirit that mattered.

 Rajan Swaroop, director, east regional hub, Bharti Cellular Ltd, flagged off the fun sprint, with people across all ages taking to the road. 

 ?This marathon is an ode to the indomitable spirit of the city and its people,? offered Swaroop, a sentiment echoed by CII?s Shoeb Ahmed.

 Calcuttans who couldn?t manage to put on their running shoes were there along the route, cheering on contestants.

 ?We will surely organise it even better next year? was the promise from commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee, ?maybe even top the Mumbai Marathon?. 

 As soon as all the 7,000-odd participants were on their way, it was time for some musical action at the starting point, with singer Sandeep Vyas getting the crowd to sway to the beat of remix hits.

 Several tiring kilometres later, the champions emerged, with Congress leader Salman Khurshid at hand to give away the prizes. 

 The main marathon was won by Bimal Mahato (2:23:11), who received Rs 2 lakh, while first runner-up Balaram got Rs 1 lakh, followed by Jaybhai Dutta with Rs 50,000.

 In the ladies? section, Reena Das (44:17) emerged on top, bagging Rs 50,000, while Pushpa Devi and Sabita Biswas finished second and third, receiving Rs 30,000 and 15,000, respectively.

 Quite clearly, Sunday saw Calcutta break into a mighty sprint from the leisurely walk it is used to.

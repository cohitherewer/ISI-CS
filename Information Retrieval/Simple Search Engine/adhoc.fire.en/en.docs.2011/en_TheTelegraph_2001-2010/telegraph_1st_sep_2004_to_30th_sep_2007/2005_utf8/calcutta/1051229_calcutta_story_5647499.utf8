 A year-end bash with a difference is Natya Sapna Kalpa, organised by Anya Theatre each year. For the seventh time running, the Rabindra Sadan complex and the Academy of Fine Arts will ring with music, theatre and poetry from the afternoon of December 31 to the early hours of January 1.

 ?Each year we select a broad theme and then invite all groups or individuals who want to express themselves in whatever manner they choose,? stage veteran Bibhas Chakraborty told Metro on Monday. ?The response has been amazing so far,? he added.

 This year, the focus is on the works of Upendrakishore Roychowdhury, Sukumar Ray and Satyajit Ray. The celebrations will start at 2.30 pm with three street plays in front of Rabindra Sadan ? Upendrakishore?s Tuntunir Galpa (presented by Sandharva), Sukumar Ray?s Lakkhaner Shaktishel (Theatre Platform) and Satyajit Ray?s Ascharjantu (Gayeshpur Sanlap).

 The evening session will begin at 6 pm at Academy of Fine Arts, with a speech on the three stalwarts by Shibaji Bandopadhyay. An award distribution ceremony will follow, to honour Haradhan Bandopadhyay, Nemai Ghosh, Sandhya Chattopadhyay and others. Soumitra Chatterjee?s readings from the works of Upendrakishore, Sukumar and Satyajit Ray will bring the curtains down.

 From 10 pm the action will shift to the Rabindra Sadan auditorium, where Kaushik Sen will present Bonku Babur Bandhu and Gautam Halder will stage Potolbabu Film Star, both adapted from Satyajit Ray stories. Busy directing the play, Sen said: ?For me this is not just a wonderful story for children but also a study of how a timid man regains his self-confidence.?

 The story, which is said to have inspired Spielberg?s ET, could involve a lot of special effects but Sen will depend only on theatrical devices. 

 Sukumar Ray?s works will be presented by Ishita Mukhopadhyay and as a collage by Prabir Guha. Runu Chowdhury will present Upendrakishore?s delightful tales about Majantali Sarkar. 

 At midnight, the audience will be drawn outdoors for a Borsho Boron Utsav. Passes for the Academy of Fine Arts show and tickets for the Rabindra Sadan performances are available at the venues.

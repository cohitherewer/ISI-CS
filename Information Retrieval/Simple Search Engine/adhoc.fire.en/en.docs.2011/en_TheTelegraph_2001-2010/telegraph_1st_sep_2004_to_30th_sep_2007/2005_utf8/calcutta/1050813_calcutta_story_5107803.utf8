 Sepoy rises on screen, in bronze

 - First bust in 148 years cuts lonely figure as star draws crowds

 Barrackpore was the battleground for the sepoy and the star ? one was unveiled in bronze for the first time in 148 years, the other came roaring back on celluloid after four years.

 But it proved a no-contest, with the sepoy?s bronze bust only highlighted in the reflected glory of the Bollywood superstar.

 The statue rose on the Barrackpore Cantonment grounds hours prior to the release of Amir Khan?s The Rising at a hall nearby and hundreds around the country.

 ?Strange coincidence,? said K. Venkat Nagi Reddy, CEO of the Barrackpore Cantonment Board. ?We had planned the unveiling date one-and-a-half months back and it has nothing to do with other events (read: the release of Mangal Pandey ? The Rising),? stressed the CEO.

 But why August 12? Wouldn?t Independence Day have been more appropriate? ?It would have been just another event on August 15 and even the dignitaries present would have had other commitments,? argued the CEO.

 If the timing was a coincidence, the only other connect between Mangal Pandey on screen and stone was the handlebar moustache.

 The rest was all Aamir. The garlanded sepoy was a lone ranger, while a few kilometres away at Atindra cinema ? and at all cinemas in Calcutta and beyond ? the long-haired hero was the centre of attention, drawing record Day I crowds.

 ?House full till Sunday? screamed the sign at Atindra and tickets for the Rs 40-crore extravaganza were being sold at double the rates for the Friday matinee show.

 And Aamir Khan towered above it all, larger than life in poster after poster.

 ?It?s the first time that halls in Barrackpore have registered such huge advance bookings,? said a spokesperson for Jalan Distributors, distributing the film in the east.

 Back at the crossing of Barrack Road and Sadar Bazar Road, the statue of ?Sepoy 1441 of Regiment 34 of Company 5?, unveiled at 10 am by Brigadier Mahesh Mathur, president of the Barrackpore Cantonment Board, was a picture of desolation.

 The few passers-by who paused to take a look at the statue invariably commented on the lack of long hair that Aamir grew for 18 months to sport in the Ketan Mehta extravaganza. ?But there is a definite resemblance with Aamir?s look in the film,? smiled a teenager.

 A.N. Bagchi, office superintendent of the Cantonment Board, explained how they got the look of the statue, being planned and carved over the past six months, right.

 ?We did a lot of research from the sketches we had in our cantonment records and we even got hold of a photograph from the National Museum in Jaipur,? said Bagchi.

 But did it take the making of Mangal Pandey to spur the Cantonment Board into action? No way, retorted officials. ?We have never lost sight of Mangal Pandey,? said Nagi Reddy, pointing out the park, the garden and the cenotaph in the compound dedicated to the martyr.

 ?We are not even aware of the details of the film and how it depicts him,? he added.

 On Friday, thousands got to know exactly how the sepoy has been depicted in The Rising. And hundreds more will enjoy a ?live? date with the star on Saturday as part of The Telegraph Ticket to the Stars promotion.

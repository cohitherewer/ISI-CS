The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safety shield on campus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Security is being beefed up at colleges after the Roma Jhawar abduction case. 

 Calcutta University, to which the colleges are affiliated, is also tightening security on its campuses, especially during class hours.

 ?Immediately after we came to know of the abduction in Salt Lake, we held a meeting and directed our students to stay alert. We have asked them to notify us without delay if they notice unknown persons or cars moving about suspiciously near the campus,? said Jayanta Acharya, principal, SA Jaipuria College, in north Calcutta.

 About 5,000 students, including 2,000 girls, mostly from rich non-Bengali families, study in the college. 

 ?A majority of our students come from well-to-do, non-Bengali families. We are trying to tighten security as much as possible,? said Rama Banerjee, principal, Rani Birla College.

 The university authorities have decided to hold talks with police brass for stepping up patrol near colleges with a large number of girl students from business families.

 Apart from SA Jaipuria College and Rani Birla College, Bhawanipur Education Society College and Seth Surajmal College are two other institutions with a high percentage of such students.

 The university authorities will also hold discussions with the state government for grant of additional funds to bolster security. 

 It has also taken up a scheme to tighten security in its six hostels for girls.

 The measures being taken to ensure tighter security on campus are:

Not allowing cars to be parked for a long time in front of the colleges

Not allowing students and outsiders to park two-wheelers outside the campus during 

college hours

Not allowing students to leave the premises without permission 

Deployment of more security personnel at the gates.

 Celebration time: Raveena Tandon and Shah Rukh Khan 

 Guess where Raveena Tandon celebrated her birthday on Wednesday? In her room at ITC Sonar Bangla, with husband Anil Thadani and daughter Rashaa.

 Spending B-day in the city wasn?t exactly what she had planned, as the three were meant to be passing through en route to ?Sikkim or somewhere like that?. But a cough-and-cold bug the Bollywood beauty was carrying just got worse and even Rashaa caught it on Wednesday, scuttling all travel plans. 

 Off limits for media and fans, it was left to the hotel staff to ?make her day? with a quiet but warm cake-cutting. 

 From Raveena to Shah Rukh Khan. To celebrate the birthday of the Badshah of Bollywood, STAR Gold will be airing The Inner World of Shah Rukh Khan and The Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan, the two documentaries made by Nasreen Munni Kabir. 

 While Shah Rukh?s birthday falls on November 2, the two documentaries will be shown on November 1 and 2, just prior to the beaming of his two movies Main Hoon Na and Swades.

 Catch SRK rewind to his early memories about Mumbai: ?One day I was very angry and was standing outside Oberoi?s and told myself I would buy Mumbai... But it just turned out to be the other way round ? Mumbai bought me over.?

 The man who?s beaten back every challenge in big, bad Bollywood, gets scared too ? of New York. ?The buildings are big, people are big, lots of traffic, and no one waits for the other. I have realised that in New York, it?s not that the people don?t fall in love but it?s just that they have no time for love at all.?

 Catch all this and much more on Tuesday and Wednesday on STAR Gold.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Close shave,rings of relief

 Post-blast London was cut off, but Metro touched base with tourists here and residents there. They spoke of pain and anguish, chaos and confusion. A quick security check was run on our own Metro Railway... 

 LONDONERS HERE

 ?We were shocked when we heard about the blasts. We both have brothers in London, as well as uncles and aunts, but we haven?t been able to get through to anyone. The lines seem to be down. Whatever information we have is through BBC and CNN. It?s scary, because it could have been us. We were at King?s Cross station only three days ago.?

 Violet Smith, a British citizen running Fairlawn Hotel

 ?It?s very disheartening. I have family, including children and grandchildren, and friends in London. The ones I?ve been able to contact so far are okay. We have British people staying with us, and they?re understandably upset. I don?t know why it happened? It?s very sad.?

 Caroline Gregory, 24, from Cambridge, who, along with friend Jenny Sanders, is in Calcutta at the end of a six-month holiday around the world

 ?I am worried. I have lots of friends and family in London, some studying at the university. I?ve sent out an email to everyone to find out how they are. We?re near the end of our trip, so we won?t cut it short. But I?m glad to be going back to the UK in two weeks. Don?t really know what?s going to happen now.?

Kanak Gupta, 24-year-old London-based researcher. A resident of Alipore, he was a student of St Xavier?s College, Calcutta.

 Aldgate is my station from home. I walk through Liverpool Street station and the affected streets every day. Moor Gate is a minute from my office. So, wherever I am, or go every day as schedule and routine, a blast happened not more than 200 m away. Luckily, I escaped it all. The narrowest escape was at Liverpool Street station. I walked through it at 8.45 am, and the first blast there happened at 8.49 am?

 ?It?s complete chaos and confusion here. The phone lines are down, the transport system is closed. Everyone I know is, thankfully, okay, but there are others I haven?t been able to contact yet. People are walking around in a daze??

 Ananya Sen, 35, financial strategy consultant, living in Golders Green. This is what the St Xavier?s College alumnus told his family on Shakespeare Sarani on Thursday evening.

 ?Ma, guess you have been watching TV? Don?t you worry, we are okay. We have been trying to get through to you for the past two hours, but I guess all Calcutta lines are jammed; there are so many of us from Calcutta living in London.?

On the road with Bernal

 Bernal with a co-actor in The Motorcycle Diaries

 Gael Garc?a Bernal, the Mexican star of The Motorcycle Diaries, trained as an actor in London and has now returned to make his stage debut. They were happy days, working as a barman while studying at the Central School of Speech and Drama. By luck, charm and ability he had won his way on to the three-year drama course. 

 During his second year he nipped back to Mexico to star in Alejandro Gonzalez I??rritu?s award-winning Amores Perros (Love?s A Bitch). Playing the city kid who uses his Doberman in dogfights to earn cash and persuade his brother?s wife to run away with him, Bernal earned $3,000 and the attention of the world. 

 When, the following year, the drama undergraduate made Y Tu Mam? Tambi?n (And Your Mother Too), the ribald tale of two teenagers on a road trip with an older woman, he was on his way to becoming one of the most f?ted, and intriguing, young actors around. 

 ?The first time I met Gael was in Madrid, when we were casting Y Tu Mam? Tambi?n,? says Alfonso Cuar?n, the film?s director. ?I was waiting for him outside an underground station. And then this small, vulnerable-looking kid started walking towards me. I couldn?t believe it ? he was so strong on the screen.?

 ?London has a very special colour looking at it objectively. But through the interpretation I have of it, I hold it very close,? ? Bernal?s Spanish-accented English is fantastic, but his thoughts sometimes go too fast for his mouth and his words fall over each other. 

 Michel Gondry first met Garc?a Bernal, as the director says, ?before he had all this recognition?. He soon realised ?that he?s not just a guy that girls would fall for? although they do, all the time?. 

 ?Gael is not only one of the most talented actors of his generation. He is also one of the most intelligent and well-read young guys I?ve ever met,? director Walter Salles says. His enthusiasm for the mutable talent who lit up his Motorcycle Diaries positively sparks down the phone line from Brazil. ?He doesn?t participate in a project as an actor alone,? Salles continues. ?Little by little he becomes a co-author. Along with that burning desire of a 26-year-old, he has the maturity of someone who is way older than he is ? emotionally and intellectually.? 

 Gael Garc iacute;a Bernal

 Bernal?s background is all intellectual bohemia. He was born in Guadalajara and spent much of his teens in Mexico City. Both parents are theatre actors ? his first appearance on stage was on an island in the middle of a lake, aged three, playing Jesus, in a nativity play alongside his mother, Patricia Bernal. 

 Bernal is loudly proud and protective of Latin American culture. Especially with regard to the work he does back home, he wants ? needs ? all his films to be both entertaining and important. The last film he made in Mexico was 2002?s El Crimen Del Padre Amaro (The Crime of Father Amaro). He played a priest who gets a 16-year-old pregnant and takes her for a backstreet abortion, which results in her death. After the brutal dogfights of Amores Perros and the kinky threesome of Y Tu Mam? Tambi?n, this was his third domestic film in a row to cause a holy row. 

 After The Science of Sleep, he has a ?very small? part in Babel, the next film from I??rritu. Bernal will also appear at the Cannes Film Festival this month in support of the only film he made last year, the low-budget American indie The King. 

 It?s his first fully English-language role, and he plays Elvis, an ?anti-hero? Mexican-American returning home to Texas from the navy. The film?s co-writer and producer Milo Addica calls from Los Angeles to say that most of the young American actors he met for the role were frightened of playing a lead who wasn?t a total goodie. Not Bernal. 

 He?ll do a Hollywood film when he?s ready. And again, the less things in life, the better. ?I just don?t want to be on top of a surfboard that I cannot control. I want it to be my size surfboard. And to enjoy the ride instead of trying to make as many tricks as possible.?

 Decor dictate for kids corners

 - Bed basics 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Bunk beds are against Feng Shui principles. This is because the child sleeping on the lower tier is always under pressure as the upper berth acts as a beam. And the one on the upper level feels cramped as he or she is too close to the ceiling. Moreover, a bunk bed placed in the corner of a room is symbolic of the children being cornered and restricted in life

Q: I have twin sons and would like to make bunk beds for them to save space. I would like to put it in a corner to leave the rest of the room free for them to play. I would like your opinion on this and suggestions about desirable pictures, symbols and the colour scheme of the room.

 Janki

 The Solution: Bunk beds are certainly space savers but against Feng Shui principles. This is because the child sleeping below is always under pressure as the upper berth acts as a beam, while the one on the upper level will feel cramped as he is too close to the ceiling. Moreover, when children sleep on bunk beds built in the corner of a room, it is symbolic of them being cornered and restricted in life. Instead it will be better to make them two single beds positioned in such a way that the children can see the door from their beds. They should not have their backs to the wall by the door.

 Ensure the beds have headboards for support and are placed against a wall in such a way that there is ample space around them for cosmic energy to flow. Care should be taken that all the furniture in the room has soft curved lines. Introduce symbols, pictures and objects that have positive meanings. Avoid abstract images that are too complex and difficult for innocent minds to understand. As far as colours are concerned, bright hues would be thought-provoking for young minds.

 Desk dilemma

 Q: I will be joining my fathers business very soon and will be doing up a chamber for myself adjacent to his. Its been planned so I will also be facing north like my father but, in the process, will have my back towards him. I am not too comfortable with this arrangement and would like your suggestions. Could I place the desk at an angle across any corner?

 Rahul Biswas

 The Solution: It is certainly not advisable for you to sit with your back to your father. Your problem can be solved if you sit facing east instead of north. Facing east is equally productive. Being the direction of the rising sun, it brings with it lots of new opportunities. 

 Do not place your desk at an angle across any corner. Place your desk in the pure south-west corner of your room where one side of the table touches the southern wall and you have a clear view of the door. This will help stabilise you well in your business and make sure you have a solid wall behind you rather than a window or open walkway where any body can pass.

 Room rules

 Q: During holidays, my teenage daughter sleeps late in the night and wakes up late in the afternoon. Her room is located in the western part of the house. We have spare bedrooms in the southern and eastern part of the house also. Could shifting her out of this room solve the problem? She belongs to the west group according to her year of birth and I am a bit hesitant about shifting her to an eastern room.

 Sulochana

 The Solution: Bedrooms facing the sunrise in the east are ideal for people who find it hard to wake up early in the morning. You can also hang a pair of well-cut round crystals from the eastern window, which will diffuse the sunrays, creating stunning rainbow colours. Shifting her to an eastern room should not be a problem provided she sleeps with her head pointing to any one of the auspicious directions favourable for west group people.

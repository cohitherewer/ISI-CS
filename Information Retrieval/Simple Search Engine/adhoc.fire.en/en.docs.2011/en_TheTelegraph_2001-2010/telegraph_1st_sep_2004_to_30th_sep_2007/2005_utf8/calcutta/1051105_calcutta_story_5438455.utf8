 The City Diary

 Sheikh Ebrar Hussain, who runs a bookstore on College Street, has been cheated of Rs 1.5 lakh by two youths who would often drop by at his shop.

 Lakshman Bhattacharya and Sanjoy Das introduced themselves as railway employees and promised to use their ?contacts? to get jobs for Hussain?s son Anwar-ul-Islam and son-in-law Akram Ali Mullick. Hussain paid them Rs 1.5 lakh in four instalments last year. Neither did they keep their word, nor has Hussain got his money back. Last month, an NGO helped Hussain lodge a complaint against the duo with Thakurpukur police. ?I don?t know whether I will get back my money. But they should not be allowed to cheat others,? Hussain said on Friday. 

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said he had ordered raids in the area to net the accused duo.

 Bandana Mondol, 17, died of cracker injuries at SSKM Hospital on Thursday night. She was bursting crackers at her Sonarpur house on Kali puja night, when a splinter from a tubri pierced a vein of her right wrist. She bled excessively and was rushed to a local nursing home. But as bleeding did not stop, she was shifted to SSKM Hospital.

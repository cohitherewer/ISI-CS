The dark side of desire

 Real hero: Akshay Kumar

 Joel Schumacher unveiled the horrors of the porn film circuit in his Nicolas 

Cage-Joaquin Phoenix-starrer 8 MM. Now, its Bollywoods turn to do 

the same with Mohit Suris Kalyug, earlier titled Blue Film. Fresh after 

the success of his directorial debut Zeher, Mohit tries to spin an engrossing 

tale around the porn market. The spotlight is on an ill-fated man (newcomer Kunal 

Khemu) accused of being a blue film-maker. As the protagonist ventures into the 

murkiness of the porn world, he discovers a well-oiled machinery filled with pimps 

and stars. Amrita Singh makes a big-screen comeback as the woman heading the whole 

porn circuit, Emraan Hashmi plays a pimp lurking in and around the dingy bylanes, 

and remix video girl Deepal Shaw (in picture left), plays a reigning porn star. 

Kalyug releases on December 9.

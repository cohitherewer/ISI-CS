 Heavy rain over the past three days raised the spectre of a deluge in Calcutta on Friday, leading to the declaration of a state of alert.

 At least 50,000 people were marooned in different parts of the city, where knee-deep to waist-deep water accumulated in lanes and alleys.

 The worst-hit areas were Basundhara Park, Sonali Park, Kashthadanga and Kshudiram Pally and Ananda Nagar in Behala, from where about 2,500 people shifted to safer places from Thursday night.

 ?We have not faced such severe waterlogging so far this year. Even the monsoon rains did not cause such a catastrophe. We were forced to move to a higher place,? said Abani Haldar of Ananda Nagar.

 Like Haldar, members of nearly 40 families have taken shelter on the first floor of Abinash Smriti Anandanagar School.

 But, chaos reigned supreme, as those who sought shelter complained that they were going without food. 

 ?Local clubs and councillors have doled out rice and pulses. But there is no arrangement for cooking a meal. We can?t chew raw rice and dal,? said Renubala Biswas, 60, a housewife and resident of Ananda Nagar.

 The civic authorities pressed the panic button on Friday after the Met office warned of another 48 hours of rain and set up a disaster management team to combat any emergency.

 ?We opened a round-the-clock control room early today. The chief engineers and their deputies have been asked to monitor the control room in shifts,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who oversaw the evacuation and other arrangements at the control room.

 About 25 sq km of Behala is under water as the continuous and heavy rainfall over the past three days was too much for the Charial and Kalagachhia canals ? the two drainage channels of Behala ? to carry off.

 The canals spilled their banks leading to flooding of the vast areas. A local councillor, Shyamadas Roy, urged the civic health authorities to keep a supply of anti-venom serum ready as cases of snakebites have been reported.

 Another councillor from Behala, Nirmal Mukherjee, blamed former mayor Subrata Mukherjee for not keeping his promise of re-excavating Kalagachhia canal, which has become silted and choked.

 Four thousand families were marooned in the Chowbhaga and Topsia areas of east Calcutta. In Topsia, water started accumulating from Wednesday evening in Sapgachhi First Lane, and on Topsia Road and Sridhar Roy Road. By Thursday night, waist-deep to knee-deep water had accumulated.

 Around 1,500 families were marooned in Baishnabghata and Bansdroni and another 2,400 families faced severe waterlogging in the Ekbalpore Road, Mominpore Road, Bhukailash Road, Ibrahim Road and Napteni Bagan areas.

 Calcutta Police deployed two rubber boats to bring in provisions to Alipore Bodyguard Lines. Civic officials installed pumps to get rid of accumulated water from the grounds of the police quarters on Friday afternoon.

 ?We would have had to evacuate the marooned from these areas had the rain been a little more severe today,? said Farzana Chowdhury, member, mayor-in-council in charge of drainage and sewerage. 

 ?The 18 pumping stations in the city are working round-the-clock to pump out accumulated water,? she added. 

 The civic authorities have alerted their health department to the threat of an outbreak of diseases once the water recedes.

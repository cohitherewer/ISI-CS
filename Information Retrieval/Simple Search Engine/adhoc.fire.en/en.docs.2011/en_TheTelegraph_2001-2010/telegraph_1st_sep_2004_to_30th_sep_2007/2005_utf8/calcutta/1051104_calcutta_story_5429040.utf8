 Beauty and hair care are no longer restricted to the feminine kind. Todays metrosexual man is stylish and very much fashion conscious. The Style On? Everyday, a workshop from Marico, was proof enough of men changing their stripes. 

 Held on October 25 at Tantra, stylist Susan Francis used the Parachute After Shower Hair Cream to showcase a host of hairstyles on city models Yusuf, Rahul, Anando and Amitabh.

 Corporate, sporty, casual and party were the looks chosen. Apart from good cut and colour, its the styling that makes the difference, said Susan.

 We have earlier held such workshops in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai and the response has been amazing. Just as men today are conscious about what they wear, they make every effort to look good, too. The product helps them style their hair at home and create an impact sure to make heads turn, said a spokesperson for Marico. 

 The non-sticky cream, with aqua moisturisers and coconut milk proteins, can be used on a regular basis.

 Prices range from Rs 29 to Rs 55. The product is available in retail stores across the country.

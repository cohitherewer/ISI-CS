 Since 2001, the Centre has not sent a representative to the World Library and Information Congress. This year, too, India will go unrepresented at the congress, being held in Oslo, Norway, from last Friday. 

 The director of the National Library used to attend the annual congress. Asit Ranjan Banerjee, in 2000, was the last library director to have participated in the congress. 

 Officials of the library and its two staff associations have protested the Centre?s decision. General secretary of the National Library Staff Association Saibal Chakraborty said on Wednesday that the organisation would submit a memorandum to the Centre opposing the decision.

 On June 21, library director Sudhendu Mandal had received the invitation to attend the congress. He had sought permission from the Union culture department, but received no reply. A library official iterated on Wednesday that the Centre had not specified any reason for not sending a representative to the congress. 

 When contacted in Delhi on Wednesday, joint director of the culture department K. Jayakumar said that ?it is not necessary to send someone from the National Library every year?. 

 Library director Mandal told Metro that he would soon take up the issue with the department and explain to its head the importance of the event. About 4,000 delegates from various countries are attending the nine-day congress. They are expected to present about 200 papers. 

 Senior library officials pointed out that the central government did not hesitate to send representatives from the library to less important events. ?Recently, our director had visited Malaysia and signed an agreement with the national library there. As per the agreement, two of our staff members will be deputed to Malaysia every year for training. This will help us to upgrade the library infrastructure. We have failed to understand why Delhi is not serious about sending a library representative to the international congress,? lamented a senior official.

 According to informed sources, the Centre?s reluctance to send a representative to the congress could have something to do with the fact that the library has not had a permanent director over the past five years.

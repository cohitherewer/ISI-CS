The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Murmurs of discontent at homes

 Inmates of an old-age home: The view now is not quite serene. A Telegraph picture

 Shuvra Roy, in her late 60s, has nowhere to go. 

 Shunned by her family in Barrackpore, on the northern fringes of the city, the Barisal-born woman had pinned her hopes on the old-age home while depositing her security amount of Rs 70,000. Six months into it, Roy is now wondering if it was worth it. 

 With little or no infrastructure and hardly any doctor present to attend to old-age problems, the mother of two feels trapped by destiny. 

 She is not alone. 

 An increasing number of inmates in different old-age homes across the city and on its fringes are now complaining about slack infrastructure and scant facilities, prompting the state government to take a closer look at these mushrooming institutions. 

 ?There are certain conditions that one has to meet while obtaining a licence for setting up an old-age home and we have decided to take a closer look at the applications. Henceforth, we will see if these homes have adequate facilities or not,? said Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality. 

 ?There will be surprise checks and if we find anything wrong, we will pull up the institutions,? a senior municipal officer added.

 There are 300-plus old-age homes in and around the city that charge anything between Rs 45,000 and Rs 80,000 as security deposit from each candidate. Records reveal that once selected, an inmate has to pay a monthly instalment of between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500 for basic expenses, including food, lodging and healthcare. 

 However, allegations abound of some of these homes not serving proper meals every day. With the state government not keeping an eye on the running of these homes, their managements are rarely pulled up for flouting rules. 

 What?s most appalling is the state of healthcare. 

 ?Most of these homes lack adequate infrastructure to handle the geriatric complications of residents. Worse still, most homes lack dedicated doctors,? says Indrani Chakrabarty of the Calcutta Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. 

 Chakrabarty, who works in close association with the Union ministry of social welfare, holds that there are certain defined norms for attending to the needs of residents of old-age homes. 

 These include proper training in psychology and ?old-age symptom detection? for the attendants and dedicated health workers to rush to meet the needs of the old round-the-clock. Chakrabarty says in most of the homes, there are only part-time doctors or just homoeopathic doctors.

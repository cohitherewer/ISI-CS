 The number of beauty queens that our city has produced in the past few years has been phenomenally high and one city-based pageant that has been a stepping stone for most of them is the Sananda Tilottama. 

 The hunt for the beauty queens-to-be of this year?s Tilottama kicked off at CC amp;FC on Friday. Around 50 aspirants, with dreams in their eyes, turned up for the pre-event briefing by grooming expert Sanchita Kushary Bose. The participants will face a jury comprising actress Koneenica Banerjee, actor Rajatabha, beauty expert Bridgette Jones, fashion designer Sunipa Samaddar and RJ Jimmy Tangree at the ITC Sonar Bangla on Saturday. At the preliminary round 20 finalists, who will compete for the much-coveted crown, will be shortlisted.

 Delicate drapes

 If you fancy the delicate drapes of Chanderi to beat the heat this summer, the exhibition at Artisana on Chowringhee Terrace is worth checking out. 

 Organised by The Crafts Council of West Bengal as part of development programmes sponsored by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, the exhibition features a wide variety of saris, dupattas and home linen.

 The Chanderi programme aids 300 weavers and their families. ?In 1311 AD, 20,000 followers of Maulana Maji Buden migrated from Lakhaoti near Dhaka to Chanderi and started weaving muslin to earn a living. They impressed the local royalty with their skilled weaving. From there began the tradition of this gossamer textile later known as Chanderi,? said Sudatta Chakraborty of the Crafts Council.

 The wares are priced between Rs 325 and Rs 2,500. Home linen in the form of cushions and curtains start as low as Rs 65. The exhibition will be on till April 14. 

 Tribal touch

 If you are charmed by tribal art, Mohua Sen Sarkar?s three-day exhibition at Genesis Art Gallery may throw up interesting options for you. Sarkar specialises in picking up authentic tribal weaves and jewellery from the north of the country and giving it a contemporary touch. She takes care to retain the unique properties of each piece though, most of which have an interesting story behind them. For example, in tribal lore, the number of triangular pendants on a necklace denotes the number of sons the wearer has born. 

 ?I use a simple and creative techniques through which I redesign and refashion pieces of silver tribal jewellery and then cord them in various ways,? says Sarkar. There are silver necklaces with interesting motifs, large turquoise stones, reversible jade or cut stone, all with her signature alterations. 

 The base metal in Sarkar?s designs is always sterling silver, worn by tribals for its earthy powers. ?The tribals have to work in the fields most of the time and chunky silver jewellery helps to keep the body cool,? shares Sarkar. 

 When it comes to weaves, kalamkari, ikkat and bomkai rule Sarkar?s collection. Tribal handloom saris with nakshikantha work from Bangladesh and carefully handcrafted kalamkari designs can be found on numerous cotton saris on display. 

 Sarkar adds to the repertoire with her little innovative touches. In case of kalamkari for example, Sarkar uses vegetable dyes while sticking to traditional motifs. But at the same time she prides herself for sourcing authentic handcrafted bomkais, ?unlike the computer-generated designs doing the rounds today?. 

 Besides, there?s a range of kurtas, salwars and blouse pieces. The kurtas and salwars are of varying lengths with kalamkari prints being the focus and simple mirror work featured in some. The blouse pieces, with embroidery and mirror work, have the potential of being used in different ways. You can use them as mix--match sari blouses or even fashion a short kurti out of them. 

 The exhibition is on till Sunday evening.

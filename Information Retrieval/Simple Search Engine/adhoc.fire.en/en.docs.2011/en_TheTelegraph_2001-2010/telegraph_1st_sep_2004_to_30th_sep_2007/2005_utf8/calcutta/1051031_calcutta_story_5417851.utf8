 Hawker ouster order gathers dust

 Despite Calcutta High Court?s directive, neither the city police nor the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken any step to oust several thousand hawkers from eight main arteries of the city.

 According to the high court directive on September 9, hawkers occupying the pavements of Strand Road, Brabourne Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, Rabindra Sarani, Netaji Subhas Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kalakar Street and AJC Bose Road should have been removed on a regular basis and the process completed by November 24. But not a single hawker has been evicted yet. 

 ?Police will have to submit a compliance report in court on November 25, when the matter is fixed for hearing before the division bench, and also explain what is causing the delay,? said Subhas Dutta, petitioner of the case.

 Government lawyers fighting the case, however, said the court had not set any deadline for carrying out its order. 

 In its last order, the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly had observed that eviction of hawkers would help thin crowds on the streets, apart from checking road accidents and air pollution. 

 Dismissing a petition from a hawkers? lobby, the judges had spelt out the city?s priorities and said they would not entertain any plea for a stay on the drive against hawkers for the sake of the city as a whole. 

 ?We do not think it proper to entertain the hawkers? petition by asking the CMC and police to refrain from evicting hawkers and encroachers from the eight major roads,? the judges said. 

 The bench also observed: ?We do acknowledge the provisions of the National Urban Renewal Policy that says removal of hawkers/vendors from the streets should be avoided whenever feasible. But let us also not lose sight of the fact that removal of hawkers and unauthorised structures from footpaths will have to be tackled if its serves the interests of Calcutta as a whole.?

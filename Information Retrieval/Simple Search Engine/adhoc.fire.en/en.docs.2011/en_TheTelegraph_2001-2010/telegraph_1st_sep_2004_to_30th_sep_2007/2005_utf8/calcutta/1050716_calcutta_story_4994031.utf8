 Round-the-clock pizza power

 Adding to the midnight munch options is Don Giovanni, now bringing steaming Italian, Oriental and Indian fare to your doorstep around the clock.

 If early to bed, early to rise isnt your style, chances are you are sick of the dhaba crowds and of five-star coffee shops taking a bite out of your wallet. Most of the other kitchens in town close by 11.30 pm. To plug the gap, lounges have already started serving clients all night. 

 But what if you fancy a bite at home? The city-based food delivery service has now stepped in to meet that demand.

 With so many entertainment options around, many people do not go to bed before midnight. If you are awake for so long, you are bound to feel hungry, but besides the few dhabas, there are few other places, which serve food till late and at economical prices, explains R. Dewan, owner, Don Giovannis.

 Party people of a different nature are the decade-old eaterys target. There is a considerable number of people who party indoors and continue till the wee hours of morning. In order to serve fresh and warm food to their guests they can place their order with us. The round-the-clock delivery system will ensure orders reach on time, says Dewan. Busy professionals too are on the Don Giovanni radar. 

 Techies and BPO staff have been identified as possible takers of this service.

 People in Sector V work around the clock. We have equipped our Salt Lake outlet to meet the demand. The handful of call centres situated in the heart of the city can place their orders at the Ballygunge outlet, adds Dewan.

 One can order anything from the existing menu at any time of day or night. We have employed more staff who will work in shifts. The charges will be the same and delivery will be absolutely free of cost, informs Dewan.

 While the 24-hour delivery has been up and running for residents of south and central Calcutta and Salt Lake since July 1, north Calcuttans will have to place big orders to get their hands on a pizza post midnight.

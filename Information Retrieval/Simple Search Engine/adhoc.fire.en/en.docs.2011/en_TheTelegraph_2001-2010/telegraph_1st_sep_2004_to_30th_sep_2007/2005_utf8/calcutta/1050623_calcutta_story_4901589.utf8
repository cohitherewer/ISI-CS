 As the jubilant supporters of CPM painted the town red and drummed up a loud victory beat on Tuesday, musicians and their loyal band of followers splashed Park Street in myriad colours, dry day notwithstanding ? World Music Day had clearly captured the imagination of Calcutta.

 In its second year, the World Music Day celebrations, spearheaded in the city by The French Association, the cultural wing of the French Embassy, put the joi de vivre back in Park Street, that old favourite for rhythm and reason. Logistics and bad weather may not allow the festival to take to the streets and outdoor arenas as is the norm in the rest of the world, but the carnival is here to stay in Calcutta.

 Sangita Sultania G. Roy spent the day venue-hopping to catch the music and the mood.

 Nostalgic notes

 The Calcutta chapter of the festival, pioneered by the French back in 1982 to celebrate the fine weather on summer solstice, the longest day of the year, started on a nostalgic note at Flurys. Old-world charm and the romance of the moment was hard to miss as veteran musician Paul Mullick on saxophone accompanied by C. Manuel on keyboard offered golden oldies like Are you lonesome tonight, Quando quando and Stupid cupid. As the chandelier gleamed down on the newly renovated eatery, it was heartening to note a couple of old timers humming along with the tunes, Maureen Ghose being one of them. Paul plays regularly at our annual terrace parties. We love his soft, mellow and soothing music, not to mention the nostalgia of it all, she smiled.

 Beyond barriers

 The citys other parts reverberated with the sound of music as well, with outfits like The Hobos and Class Apart playing elsewhere, but the gigs lined up on Park Street got the hop-over advantage. So next on the audiences agenda was the Cha Bar at the Oxford Bookstore, where one was treated to an adda of a different kind. A conversation over drums and tabla was how the musicians of Talking Drums chose to chart their musical territory. With Kesivan Naidoo from South Africa on drums and Angshubha Banerjee on tabla, the jam brought forth many stories, which Kesivan described as spanning everything from the weather and mystical moods to silence and love. Ananda Sen on bass and Indraudh Bose on violin joined in the subsequent pieces to present a complete picture of fusion among various cultures.

 Cutting edge

 The flavour of the festival varied widely, providing a choice between French music presented by students at the library of The French Association and modern rock in the same hour. Lightside fans slid into Barista across the road to enjoy acoustic versions of alternative rock rendered by the lighter side of Cassinis Division. While the mood was largely retro elsewhere, this young duo comprising Rahul Guha Roy on guitar and vocals and John Bose on bass and vocals revelled in rocking the crowd with a power-packed performance of cutting-edge stuff. They also showed off their musical prowess by strumming folk rock in keeping with caf? culture. 

 If Creed, The Calling, Green Day, REM, Lifehouse and Staind covers formed part of their repertoire, Dylan and Beatles numbers added evergreen meat to the matter. The set was peppered with Cassinis Division originals like Simba, Caesar, Only for a while, Mr Mishra and more.

 Regular fare

 Those who feel more comfortable on familiar turf had plenty to look forward to as the evening wore on. Along with Someplace Else, The Atrium also reverberated with the sound of music as Hip Pocket padded up in the coffee shop to churn out their regular, but toned down, set of classic rock. In a coffee shop, one cannot play loud and heavy music, thus we will stick to soft ballads and present a semi-unplugged show, Nondon Bagchi, the drummer of the band, had promised earlier. True to their word, they presented a languid set of songs like Hey Jude, Yesterday, Imagine, Ruby Tuesday, Blowin in the wind and the like, while catering to repeated requests like Hotel California.

 The sound got louder with Krosswindz taking over Someplace Else thereafter with their brand of world music comprising a lot of rural and folk influences, manifest in their album One World.

 The mood didnt need any pepping up, but Usha Uthup dropped by nonetheless all the way from Kerala, just to be with Calcutta today. Jamming with Krosswindz, Usha played to the galleries, lauding the spirit of the city on a dry day, cracking jokes and lampooning celebrities like Malaika Shararat.

 Party time

 The best was, of course, saved for last. If one thought all the caf? and pub hopping was a tiring affair, the dance floor at Tantra struck a contradictory note. Latin band Orient Express jammed with French DJ Loopkin to present a heady mix of traditional South American dance music and modern electronic beats. The result was a gala finale, rewarding those who stuck till the end with a dance to remember ? till the next time around.

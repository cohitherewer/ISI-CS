 The Hub, the Italian speciality restaurant at Taj Bengal, boasts a brand new chef. 

 Antonello Medda has come all the way from Genoa on his first assignment in India. What in particular brought him to this country? 

 Back in Italy, I would hear about India and its diverse culture and cuisine. For a chef, winning over the tastebuds of people with varied tastes is the biggest challenge, smiles Medda.

 The chef will stick to the simplicity that Italian cuisine is famous for. In my previous workplace in Italy, from bread to sauces, we made everything in-house. This helps to maintain authenticity of the cuisine, says Medda.

 At the Taj, Medda is busy gauging tastes and preferences of food lovers. I have been doing the rounds of markets in Calcutta and observing buying patterns of people. I am also taking a feedback from diners, he explains. 

 So, what goes into making a good chef? Travelling, pat comes the reply. The more you travel the more you learn about the cultures of different places. Cuisine is directly related to culture. My friends joke that I have travelled more than Christopher Columbus, the great traveller who was also from Genoa, smiles Medda. The 31-year-old has delicacies from all parts of Italy up his sleeve.

 The interesting thing about Italian food is that it never makes you feel full. Thats because its low on spices and cooked in olive oil, explains Medda.

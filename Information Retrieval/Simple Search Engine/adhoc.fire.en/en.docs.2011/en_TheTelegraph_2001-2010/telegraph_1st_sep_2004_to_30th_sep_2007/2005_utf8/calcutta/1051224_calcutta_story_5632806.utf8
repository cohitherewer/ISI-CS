 adro, creators of the famed porcelain of Spain, unveiled a limited edition line titled Underwater Journey in the city this week.

 The collection recreates the exuberant plant life of the seabed, all complete with spectacular coral and multicoloured seaweed.

 Priced at Rs 1,40,000 each, the 1,000 pieces come in different shapes of flowers, human figures and birds. The line is exclusively available to Privilege Gold Members of Lladro, a scheme that was launched in Calcutta on the same occasion.

 The membership comes for a fee of Rs 5,800 and allows purchase of Lladro creations before they are available in the market.

 Said Angelique Brien, CEO of Spa Agencies, the exclusive distributors of Lladro in India: The most spectacular thing about Lldaro creations is the warmth and sensitivity that each piece exhibits. Calcuttans are known for their love for art and the response from the city to the products have always been amazing.

 adro products are available at Ganga Expressions in Metro Shopping Centre.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fauna fine in concrete jungle 

 - Wildlife exists in pockets despite urbanisation, says study

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Wildlife has managed to retain its presence in Calcutta ? well, just about ? in the face of massive urbanisation.

 A University Grants Commission-funded study on Calcutta?s bio-diversity has revealed the presence of 20 species of wild mammals in and around the city, though their numbers have declined over the years. The mammals include jackals, civets, jungle cats and langurs.

 The study, between April 2002 and March 2005, covered 17 sites ? including Tollygunge Club, Banabitan (Salt Lake), Raj Bhavan, Eden Gardens, the IIM Joka campus, East Calcutta Wetlands around Nalban, Narendrapur, Tallah Park, Subhas Sarobar, Rabindra Sarobar, Brace Bridge and the Maidan.

 ?Even a busy spot like Curzon Park was surveyed. We wanted to see if wildlife exists there despite human interference,? said Suchitra Ghosh, principal investigator of the project.

 The findings of the three-year study suggest that wild animals, struggling against heavy odds, have managed to survive in pockets of the concrete jungle, which the city is fast turning into.

 Packs of jackals can still be seen roaming in Banabitan (Salt Lake?s Central Park) and jungle cats prowling across the Joka campus. Attracted by beehives in the vicinity, honey-loving civets have made Raj Bhavan their favourite haunt. 

 And, if luck favours, one can spot an odd dolphin bobbing up and down the Hooghly waters.

 Wild mammals, birds, flowering plants and butterflies were the indicators that helped the surveyors gauge the city?s bio-diversity, said project investigator Ghosh.

 Armed with searchlights, the team members would scan the sites at night. Or alternatively, they would show pictures of animals to watchmen and local residents and ask whether any of the species had been spotted in the area.

 Apart from the bigger animals, three species of mongoose have been found in Alipore, Eden Gardens and Narendrapur. The study also recorded five species of rats, two species of bats and some Gangetic dolphins.

 ?The belt of green stretching from Alipore to the Maidan, covering Eden Gardens and Raj Bhavan, is rich in civets, bats, mongoose, moles and five species of rats. It was, however, disappointing not to find any jackals there,? Ghosh told Metro.

 ?Animals like the Bengal fox haven?t been seen in Calcutta for the past two decades. Large Indian civets, otters and fishing cats are now hardly visible in the Salt Lake wetlands and Shyamkhola,? said Prakriti Samsad?s Kushal Mukherjee, part of the field personnel.

 Adding a note of caution, he said that with big trees being felled around Narendrapur to make room for housing estates, the area will meet the same fate as the wetlands or Rabindra Sarobar, which are now almost bereft of wildlife.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City slice in office space pie

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Real estate major DLF Commercial Developers plans to build nearly 30 million sq ft of office space in the country, and Calcutta figures prominently on its priority list.

 ?In the next four years, we plan to build anything between 20-30 million sq ft of space nationally, which would cost about Rs 4,000 crore,? Arvind Khanna, chief executive (marketing), DLF Universal Limited, said on Tuesday.

 The company announced software giant IBM would occupy the first building of DLF?s 13-lakh-sq-ft IT Park coming up in Rajarhat. ?They have taken up 60,000 sq ft of the 3.5-lakh-sq-ft space and should be able to start operating by the middle of next month,? Khanna said.

 IBM is scheduled to take up the rest of the office space as well, in phases. In Gurgaon, the software company occupies nearly 650,000 sq ft of DLF property.

 The second building in the Rajarhat IT Park would comprise around 4.5 lakh sq ft and would be ready by January 2006, while the third building should be operational by July 2006. ?Besides IBM, two BPO companies are in talks about booking 100,000 sq ft each,? Khanna said.

 DLF is also working on a second, slightly bigger IT park in Rajarhat. The company has already been allotted a 25-acre plot for this, on which it plans to build 20 lakh sq ft of IT space. The project would cost around Rs 350 crore.

 ?The perception of Calcutta has changed. A lot of human resource is attracted to the city from places like Orissa and Patna, and we would like to make the best use of that opportunity,? Khanna observed.

 On the national scene, the company is focussing on maintaining its position as the ?largest real estate developer? and having a presence in ?every major city?. DLF is planning expansion in Pune, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad soon.

 ?Last year, we adopted the policy of leasing commercial and retail space, instead of selling it, and that is helping us enhance the value of the property,? Khanna said.

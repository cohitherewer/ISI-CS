 Wife?s death by fire, duo arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The husband and brother-in-law of a 30-year-old woman, who died of burns, were arrested in the Thakurpukur area on Sunday for allegedly setting her on fire.

 Krishna Mandal died late on Saturday at Vidyasagar Hospital, where she was admitted the day before with severe burns. Krishna?s husband, Sanjay, and her brother-in-law, Krishnapada, were arrested for allegedly burning her alive at their house in Thakurpukur?s Dharapara.

 ?In her dying statement, Krishna had told police that the two had set her on fire as her parents could not meet their demands for a huge sum of money. Sanjay was demanding the money so he could expand his business. We have arrested the duo,? said S.N. Gupta, police superintendent of South 24-Parganas.

 Krishna married Sanjay, a small-time businessman, about five years ago. Soon after the marriage, Sanjay allegedly started torturing her mentally and physically, demanding money from her parents. Initially, Krishna?s parents would oblige, but Sanjay started demanding larger sums each time and they were unable to pay up. 

 ?Whenever she came home, Krishna would tell us how she was tortured. But we never really realised that they would actually kill her,? said Suman Das, her cousin.

 On Friday, around 11.45 pm, neighbours noticed smoke billowing out of the Mandal house and heard Krishna?s screams. 

 ?Sensing something was seriously wrong, we ran to their house and found Krishna engulfed in flames. Neither her husband nor any of her in-laws could be found. We rushed her to Vidyasagar Hospital where, after fighting for nearly 24 hours, she died last night,? said Haraprasad Sen, a neighbour.

 On Sunday, suddenly, Sanjay and Krishnapada returned. ?We caught the two men and handed them over to the police,? said Sushen Biswas, another neighbour.

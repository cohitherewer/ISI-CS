 Aqua appeal at wellness den 

 With over 1,200 trees on campus, a 120m water course, a jogging track and an Olympic-size swimming pool, ITC Sonar Bangla blends a business hotel with the trappings of a resort

 Soak in the shikara effect on the floating tea pavilions, follow it up with a round at the chip-and-putt golf course or a few sharp volleys on the tennis courts?

 Dig into succulent kebabs at Peshawari, check out the live salad counters at West View Bar amp; Grill, choose Sushi delights at the Pan Asian?

 Indoors or outdoors, restobiz is the buzz across the 16-acre sprawl that is ITC Hotel Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers. Melding the modern with the traditional, this is a place that has all the trappings of a business hotel, along with the feet-up feel of a resort, feels general manager Ranvir Bhandari.

 Since it was Calcutta, ITC had to deliver a befitting property. We had to be unique and our chairman had committed to the chief minister that this would be the finest hotel in Asia, Bhandari recalls.

 Sonar Bangla is more of a perception correction, feels the GM, with the best wow ratio in the chain. It broke even in the first year of operation and recorded profit before tax in the second year.

 We realised Calcutta was growing towards the east and we were en route. Then, the AJC Bose Road flyover happened, which, together with Rajarhat, added sheen to our already prime location, says Bhandari.

 The deceptively simple entry exuding a sense of tranquillity, goes with the essential philosophy of the property, since we sell sleep and wellness, he adds. 

 This sense of repose has been heightened by water, which was the primary inspiration for designer-architects Kerry Hill and Associates of Singapore and landscape architects Wreppan Associates of Thailand.

 Internally labelled model hotel, Sonar Bangla is aiming high. 

 We want to become an international benchmark, a destination hotel, and Im convinced this property has the makings of a world-beater. However, we must ensure that people, products and processes are constantly evolving, the GM points out.

 With over 1,200 trees on campus, a 120m water course that runs the full length of the hotel, a jogging track and an Olympic-size swimming pool besides golf and tennis, the star address is all about toppings on the vanilla flavour, stresses Bhandari. And this is only the tip of the iceberg, he smiles.

 The Welcom Lab, which tests air, water, raw materials and food and suggests pre-emptive measures, to the Snow-white drive that checks whiteness of linen to the Sound of Silence move that strives to keep an ear on the decibel level? the Bypass address is putting the right systems in place to ensure complete guest satisfaction.

 Early accolades have come in the form of the ISO 14001:2004 certification for environment management system standard and a Five Star Rating from the British Safety Council for Health and Safety Management System.

 We host a fun dinner every month with the staff and have introduced an army model of recognising excellence, says the GM. For instance, there is a soldier of the month award and a regiment of the month prize.

 Bhandari feels hoteliers today are innkeepers as well as business managers, which calls for total trust, transparency and empowerment. And he promises rollout of unique ideas going forward, ideas that would be difficult to replicate.

 For instance, a spa restaurant with well-researched health food is likely to be added to the F amp;B arsenal.

 We also want Dublin (the night club) to morph into a third place after home and work, where entry will be by invitation only, Bhandari declares.

 Mangoes grown in Bengal may make it to the tables of Malaysia, Singapore and China, thanks to a vigorous campaign. 

 Only Calcutta consumes all of 112,320 tonnes of mangoes in just six months ? from March to August (in addition to the local supply of another 10 per cent). 

 And yet, foreigners have been denied the taste of locally-grown mangoes, such as himsagar, produced in orchards around Calcutta, lakshmanbhog, a speciality of Malda, and langra, unlike the produce from elsewhere in the country, such as the popular Alphonso. 

 One reason for this is that the quality of the locally-produced varieties need to be improved, and better marketing strategies need to be implemented to fetch the right price. 

 The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority will take up an extensive campaign in Southeast Asia and China to promote Bengal mangoes. The state government is behind the effort to spread the word around in the global market.

 By the end of this month, China will be the first country to get a taste of Bengal mangoes. The focus will then shift to Singapore in the second week of June. The final leg of the campaign will be in Malaysia. 

 For this, 10 exporters (most of them from Calcutta, who deal almost exclusively with mango export), and farmers growing mangoes will be flown over to these places to participate in the ?promote Bengal mango campaign? to undergo a ?know-your-market? programme.

 ?We will tie up with some well-known departmental stores in all of the destinations, where mangoes from Bengal can be displayed for four to five days. People can actually buy on the spot, and it would also mean there are deals settled with clients who buy in bulk,? Ranjit Mondol, regional manager of the export promotion authority said on Sunday. 

 Prospective buyers will be able to taste samples free. Buyer-seller meets will be organised.

 Mangoes will be served as pickles, fresh salad, with daal, lamb or chicken, as a beverage, in chutney, sandesh, rasogolla and ice creams. ?The sheer variety is sure to attract the buyers,? an official said.

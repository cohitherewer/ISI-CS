 Law glare on London boy

 - Student told to return amp; face court for alleged wife torture

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The long arm of the law has reached out from Calcutta High Court to London ? all to resolve a family dispute.

 Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar on Monday directed Sanjay Parekh, a student of London Business School, to appear before the Alipore court with regard to his alleged torture of wife Madhusree.

 ?Ask him to come to India and face the court,? said the chief justice, reacting to a prayer made on behalf of Sanjay, seeking extension of the stay order on the warrant for the petitioner?s arrest.

 A sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) of Alipore, acting on a complaint by Madhusree, had issued an arrest warrant against Sanjay four years ago. His lawyers then prayed for time on the ground that Sanjay?s education in London would be hampered if he had to attend court.

 When the subordinate court refused to extend the period, Sanjay?s lawyer moved high court and won a stay on the warrant order.

 The lawyers appearing for the petitioner told the court their client was a promising student with a great career ahead of him.

 ?If he is so brilliant, let him appear before the court. Why is he (Sanjay) making an extraordinary delay in surrendering before the court? The high court should not interfere in the order of the trial court,? said the chief justice.

 He also observed that Sanjay should not be granted more time to appear before the court as the allegations levelled by his wife were ?serious?.

 According to case records, Sanjay, a resident of Shakespeare Sarani, married Madhusree on February 18, 1999. The couple left for London in August 2000 and Sanjay took admission to London Business School. The couple moved into a house in Regent?s Park. On August 8, 2001, both Sanjay and Madhusree returned to the city.

 It was then that Madhusree told her parents how she had been subjected to physical and mental torture by her husband in London. Her parents , however, advised Madhusree to adjust to her domestic problems and to return to Sanjay on August 21, 2001.

 ?But on August 17, Sanjay withdrew all of Madhusree?s gold ornaments (worth Rs 3.5 lakh) from the Clive Row branch of Vijaya Bank and left for London alone,? alleged Rabishankar Chatterjee, lawyer representing the state.

 Chatterjee told the court that Madhusree then filed a case against her husband under Section 498A (cruelty and torture on housewife), on the basis of which police had started criminal proceedings against Sanjay.

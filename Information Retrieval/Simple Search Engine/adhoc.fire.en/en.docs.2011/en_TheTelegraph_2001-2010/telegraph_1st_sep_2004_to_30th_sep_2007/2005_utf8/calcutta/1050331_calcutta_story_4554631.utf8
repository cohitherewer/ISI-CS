The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Raid team held back

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city police on Wednesday stopped their Kanpur counterparts from leaving Calcutta with Mohammad Rafique, a contract killer rounded up from a flat in Entally on Tuesday morning.

 Rafique, allegedly an associate of Dawood Ibrahim, was netted by a six-member Special Operations Group (SOG) team of Kanpur police. The city cops were in the dark about the raid.

 Rafique was produced at Sealdah court and remanded in police custody till April 7. 

 He has been booked under the Arms Act, as a sophisticated firearm was found in his possession.

 Senior officers described the SOG raid as an act of indiscipline. They also claimed that the team members had no documents, such as an arrest warrant, to prove that they had come to net a gangster.

 ?The SOG has been asked to file a petition in court and seek Rafique?s remand,? said police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 ?The team?s approach was not professional. The officers should have contacted us and we could have provided them all help,? Mukherjee added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wanted, tree wardens

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities are planning to involve tree-lovers in protecting and promoting the city?s greenery, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya disclosed on Tuesday.

 Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan has been directed to invite applications from residents who want to volunteer as tree wardens.

 ?We have hit upon the scheme to enable the people to play an active role in conserving the city?s greenery. It is the first step to community involvement in environmental care,? the mayor explained. 

 A tree warden will: 

 Gather information on local trees in his/her locality

 Liaise with the civic body

 Keep the parks and gardens department posted about illegal felling of trees

 Protect trees

 Recommend what needs to be done

 ?We need more trees, but what is more important is that we protect the existing ones,? pointed out Bhattacharya. 

 According to an estimate, the number of trees in the city and its vicinity totals more than 1.5 lakh. The authorities think it is not possible for the handful of employees in the parks and gardens wing to look after so many trees. Hence, the need for wardens.

 Mayoral council member Khan said a warden need not be an expert, but has to be a tree-enthusiast. 

 If necessary, the civic body may conduct a one-day training for the wardens.

 In a related development, Khan announced that the authorities were exploring the possibility of recycling tree-guards (fencing erected around saplings). At least 5,000 tree-guards can be recycled at the moment. 

 A tree-guard costs Rs 1,000 and if 5,000 such guards can be recycled, the civic body will save around Rs 25 lakh.

 Mob ransacks hospital

 - Doctors beaten up as critical patient dies at dawn

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Brandishing improvised revolvers and knives, 50-odd people, who were later joined by more local residents, ransacked the medicine department of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital from 2 am till dawn on Tuesday. Doctors too were beaten up after the death of a 57-year-old man the mob had brought in for treatment.

 The doctors, in turn, went on a ceasework till 2 pm on Tuesday, when the hospital authorities assured them of proper security.

 It was around 2 am that the doctors and nursing staff at the Ram Mohan block of the hospital heard a commotion outside the medicine department. ?Fifty-odd people were outside the department, armed with knives and other weapons, carrying a man on a stretcher. He seemed to be in a very serious condition,? said a house staff, who had witnessed the vandalism.

 One of the men who led the mob threatened to shoot the medical staff if they did not attend to Md Yahya, 57. 

 A resident of nearby Shamshul Huda Lane, Yahya seemed barely alive when nurses asked the doctors to take care of him.

 Two junior doctors went to Yahya?s aid and asked the people what was wrong with the patient. ?Did he consume something poisonous or did he eat something stale?? asked one of the doctors, when another youth, brandishing a knife, threatened them with dire consequences if anything went wrong with the patient.

 When a few injections and some medicines failed to revive Yahya, junior doctors asked senior physicians to come to their rescue. 

 ?Our doctors did whatever they could, but the man?s condition was so critical that there was nothing we could do to save him,? said Mrityunjoy Mukherjee, hospital superintendent-cum-vice-principal.

 Minutes after Yahya?s death, the angry youths began to beat up the doctors. ?We just about managed to free ourselves from their clutches and hid inside a room. The collapsible gates were drawn but they were threatening to pull us out and kill us,? one of the house-staff members said.

 Those already present in the hospital were soon joined by another mob that went on a rampage and ransacked the medicine ward. ?They broke furniture and smashed windowpanes. The nurses and other staff were terrified,? said the hospital superintendent.

 Later, a team from Beniapukur police station rounded up a dozen suspects.

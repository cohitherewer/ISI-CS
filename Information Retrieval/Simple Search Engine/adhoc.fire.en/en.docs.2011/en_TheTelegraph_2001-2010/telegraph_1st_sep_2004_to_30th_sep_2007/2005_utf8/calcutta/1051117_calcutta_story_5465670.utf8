 Taj Bengal is a step closer to nature, being declared the Environment Champion of 2005 by the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India (FHRAI).

 Personal and organisation efforts are recognised through the annual FHRAI awards that includes categories like the Young Hotel Entrepreneur of the year, Young Hotel Housekeeper of the year and the Environment Champions of the year. This year, the award ceremony was held on October 17 in Chennai. 

 A review of the environmental policies and activities of the Belvedere Road star address unfolds a series of sound eco-friendly, energy-saving and pollution-control programmes.

 There is an environment representative in each department, targets are set and assessments are done at regular intervals, says chief engineer R.K. Seth. He has been with the Taj for the last 23 years and had also won the Young Chief Engineer of the year last year.

 Simple eco-friendly alternatives like neem cake, bone dust, dry cow dung are used in place of urea and phosphate at Taj Bengal. Instead of polythene, the laundry suit and cake shop carry bags are made of eco-friendly cellulose. Pens provided to the guests are made from re-cycled paper. 

 The energy conservation drive includes installation of sensor taps and motion sensors in areas like the washroom. Reduction of LPG consumption has been achieved through modifications of LPG lines by replacing copper pug tails with flexible metallic and braided rubber pipes. There is also a daily audit and review of the LPG consumption. 

 Reduction in LDO (light diesel oil) consumption is an effort to combat air pollution. Major initiatives have been taken in areas like conversion to 100 per cent CFC (chlorofluro carbon) free equipment and reduction of noise pollution.

 The hotel has recorded savings of 9.24 lakh units of electricity and an additional 15,330 KL of water in 2004-05. 

 Apart from these, activities by the hotel include a walk to the zoo to plant trees for birds and free pollution check of cars driving into the premises on World Environment Day. 

 It is important that a satisfied set of customers walks into healthy surroundings and are assured of being in safe hands, adds Seth.

 The hotel has more reason to cheer: restaurant manager Somnath Mukherjee has bagged the Young Restaurant Manager of the year award. Its not only great food, but the presentation, ambience and hospitality that make a restaurant worth spending on, feels Somnath, who has been with Taj Bengal for the past 13 years.

 His significant achievements include the launch of two new menus within a span of six months and the poolside barbecue during winter that has resulted in an additional revenue accrual of 38.22 lakhs.

 Somnath was also the initiator of CFT (cross functional team). The team has representatives from all the major departments like kitchen, accounts, maintenance and house-keeping discussing even the smallest issues of concern. This is again to have an intrinsic look at factors deterring our drive of total guest satisfaction, he adds. 

 Innovations like the introduction of a healthy balanced diet at the breakfast and lunch buffet have won Somnath Brownie points. Monitoring of the restaurant hygiene standards in accordance with HACCP guidelines is also on his agenda.

 The hotel has seen a 20 per cent rise in customer recommendation and a growth of 16 per cent covers in recent times.

 With all this and the bonus of two awards in the kitty, its definitely celebration time at the Taj!

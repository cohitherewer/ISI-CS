The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star couples cash in

 Amitabh with Bipasha Basu and John Abraham; (Below) Ajay Devgan and Kajol

 After Preity and Saif have said Salaam Namaste to Amitabh Bachchan on KBC Dwitiya, it?s now time for Ajay and Kajol to create some Hulchul and finally John and Bipasha for an iota of Aetbaar. The star couples will be warming up the hot seats in special episodes to be aired soon on the much-watched game show. And going by on-the-sets response to the shoots, both episodes would be real humdingers.

 Show producer Siddhartha Basu tells Metro: ?Initially, it was going to be just Ajay Devgan since Kajol never appears for these kind of things. But she agreed and the two did quite remarkably on the show. Kajol said that she only reads Mills amp; Boon but her performance was really very good. In terms of conversation, the John-Bipasha episode was more insightful and AB himself said that he enjoyed the encounter.?

 On the John-Bipasha special, to be telecast during the Dussehra week, Bipasha talks a lot about her Durga puja festivities in Calcutta. ?When we were kids we would get up in the morning and chop fruits for anjali and despite being children, we loved to fast. We Bengalis have the adda ? everyone used to sit in the pandals together and have bhog. And I think being a Bengali, you connect directly with Durga puja. We also have jatras and Rabindrasangeet and a lot of cultural activities. When I am in Mumbai... miss karti hoon? she tells Bachchan on the show.

 The conversation naturally moves to biking, with John in the driver?s seat. He gives details as to how he sleeps with the bikes and helmets by his bedside. ?John also talks about his father who is a Malayali Christian and his mother who?s Parsi,? reveals Siddhartha. ?Very few people know that John is an MBA and let me tell you, he knows that subject backwards. It?s a very interesting chemistry between John and Bipasha. They are both so candid without being indiscrete.?

 While the money won by Ajay and Kajol will go to Mani Ratnam?s cancer foundation, John will give his earnings to PETA and Bipasha to Make A Wish Foundation.

 ?Since all the money goes to charity and the celebrities don?t get paid to come on the show, we are keen that they win as much as possible,? says Siddhartha. ?So the questions are kept up their street, reasonably simple yet sporting. Some of them like Shah Rukh and Aamir are gamblers and want to take risks but AB warns them all the time so that they can win maximum money for charity.?

 The Ajay-Kajol pair won Rs 1 crore on the show while John and Bipasha managed only Rs 25 lakh since ?no more questions could be pushed in with time running out as they kept on chatting?.

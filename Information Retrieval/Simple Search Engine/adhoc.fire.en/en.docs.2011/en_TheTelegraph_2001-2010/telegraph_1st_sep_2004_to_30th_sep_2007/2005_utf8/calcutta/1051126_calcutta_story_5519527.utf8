The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Take a look at them now

 How long will the callous outnumber the compassionate when it comes to dealing with the disabled, wonders Sebanti Sarkar

 For much of his childhood Sudipendu Dutta couldn?t lift his head or sit up. Today, thanks to physiotherapists and other caregivers this victim of cerebral palsy can walk around on crutches and is a student of humanities, National Institute of Open Schooling. His dream: ?The day I can go to Eden (Gardens) by myself and watch a cricket match. But climbing up all those stairs on crutches or a wheelchair is impossible.?

 Wednesday morning at Tollygunge. A blind man with a stick can hear a young couple talking animatedly near him. Softly he asks them to help him across the road. The couple glances at him and then turns away, the man even tosses a word of advice: ?Ask someone else.? Hesitantly, the man decides to start shuffling across the road, alone. Suddenly someone springs to his aid. ?Arey o babu! Bolben to?? the young rickshawallah?s voice drowns in the rumble of traffic as he guides the blind man swiftly to the other side and returns to earn his daily bread.

 Will Sudipendu?s dream of hobbling into Eden ever be fulfilled? By how much will the callous continue to outnumber the compassionate?

 During a recent function, the students of Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) at Taratala expressed their deep anguish at the difficulty of accessing different public buildings and facilities in Calcutta, crowned by itself as the capital of culture and compassion.

 Prompt commitments of care came from the city?s guardian of civic affairs, the face of infotech development and a key representative of the business lobby.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya pronounced that no new government building would be approved unless it had a ramp in its plans for the wheelchair-bound and also promised that all major puja pandals would have temporary ramps.

 Information technology (IT) minister Manabendra Mukherjee assured government support in the development and research of new software for the disabled.

 Ravi Poddar, president, eastern region, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), pledged greater interest among the industrial sector in producing assistive and augmentative gadgets and software for the disabled.

 Dark desperation

 Will these promises be kept and such initiatives be taken or will they, like earlier governmental legislation and announcements, remain posturings on paper?

 Anamika Ghosh Roy of Mentaid, an NGO working with the mentally challenged in Behala, is sceptical: ?There has been more talk than action so far.?

 Sunil Baran Patanaik, in-charge, Blind Boys Academy, Narendrapur, is more vehement: ?Take a look around, do you see any signs that the government or anybody cares??

 Point taken. Even a simple thing like boarding a bus remains a giant hurdle for the physically challenged. With the footboard too high and rails too few, the disabled are forced to depend on the pity of passengers, conductors and drivers.

 Another obvious challenge to their self-esteem is the Metro Railway which remains out of reach for the wheelchair bound with its maze of steep stairs and escalators. Even the signs on the platform are visual, so the blind don?t stand a chance.

 And Metro officials couldn?t give a damn. ?No we don?t have any special facilities for the disabled. But then, why do the disabled need to take the Metro?? wonders PRO S.K. Basu.

 There are innumerable instances of roadblocks for the disabled at Rabindra Sadan or Town Hall, post office or hospital?

 ?Take the traffic signals; they are all visual, just how difficult is it to instal audio signals for the visually impaired? Similarly, there could be Braille transcriptions on lifts and hotel doors to allow the blind to know where they are. In mobility classes, we teach our students to look out (with sticks) for stairs of 10-inch height, but few stairs or footpaths show any uniformity. These physical changes could be easily adopted by any society, but for that we need greater awareness. We have repeatedly approached the administration but things can?t happen without consensus,? says Patanaik of the Blind Boys Academy.

 The bother begins at the basics. ?People on wheelchairs need special toilets that are wide enough for the vehicle to move and have adequate handlebars, but where in Calcutta can you find such facilities?? asks an IICP trainer.

 Ray of relief

 The positives are few and far between. ?There was a time when there were no ramps at the Howrah and Sealdah railway stations. Since the IICP encourages student excursions, it used to be really difficult for us to carry our students down all those steps,? recounts IICP physiotherapist Swarup Pal. Both stations now have ramps, as do destinations like the Science City.

 ?We often take students to Science City, but some of the ramps don?t have the right gradient and there are no ramps leading to the Evolution Park,? says Subhra Chatterjee of IICP. The right gradient according to specialists is that for every change in incline of 12 inches there should be a difference of one inch only.

 A Science City spokesperson agreed that there were flaws, but at least a start has been made in the right direction. ?We always have two or three wheelchairs on standby and the entire Dynamotion Hall is accessible with ramp and lifts,? he points out.

 Anamika Ghosh Roy of Mentaid calls for more opportunities for autistic children and those with mental disabilities to display their talent. ?So many of them are good at painting, knitting, various handicrafts, music and dance. We give them vocational training and also showcase their work from time to time but that is all. Neither the government nor private organisations are ready to give them a chance.?

 But the likes of Zarin Chaudhury?s troupe of deaf and dumb actors, The Action Players, have repeatedly proved what talent lies hidden behind that forced silence. Given a stage they can hold their own with the supposedly ?more abled?.

 A technology stop reaching out to the disabled is BITM, which used to create temporary ramps for IICP student events. ?Making permanent ramps to the Technology Gallery is a goal for the current fiscal. The rest of the museum is already accessible by lifts,? says BITM director Jayanta Sthanapati. 

 New-age addresses like Forum, the mall on Elgin Road, and Hiland Park, the city?s tallest residential towers off the EM Bypass, are disabled-friendly, with lifts wide enough for wheelchairs.

 At a time when the number of disabled children is on the rise, Calcutta will be hosting a special walk on December 3, World Disabilities Day, to be flagged off from the Fountain of Joy at Victoria Memorial.

 Sujata Parekh, president, Disabilities Activist Forum, has the last word: ?Despite the PWD Act 1995, which says that the disabled must have equal opportunities in all areas, nothing is being done. So this is a Walk for Inclusion.?

 Kisna: Mixed bag Page 3: On target 

 Kisna

 Post-indepedent India with a huge hangover of the British Raj, the Subhash Ghai film traces the journey of an Indian, torn between a desi love and a phoren beauty. With a haunting music score (A. R. Rahman and Ismail Durbar) and stunning camerawork (Ashok Mehta), the screenplay is a big letdown as the characters are not fleshed out properly.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 7.20 pm; INOX (City Centre): 1.55 pm, 5 pm; 89 Cinemas: 3.40 pm, 8.35 pm

 Flop factor Not as big a flop as the industry people are making Kisna out to be, but the Subhash Ghai film is nowhere near his usual larger-than-life blockbusters. With an average 75 per cent collections last weekend, it will be out of the theatres sooner rather than later.

 Vibrant, vivacious and very, very real, Madhur Bhandarkar?s new film is a brilliant satire on Mumbai?s party people. With a fluid camera and an ensemble musical score, Page 3 looks at life beyond the bright lights of the big parties every night. 

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 12.10 pm, 10.20 pm; INOX (City Centre): 10 am, 7.50 pm; 89 Cinemas: 10.45 am, 2.50 pm, 6.35 pm.

 Success story Natural performances and hordes of engrossing sub-plots have made the film a must-watch in the metros. Just like Chandni Bar, Bhandarkar has been able to lay bare a section of the society that has remained in the spotlight, yet in the shadows. With average collections of 90 per cent in the multiplexes last weekend, the Konkona-starrer is here to stay a while.

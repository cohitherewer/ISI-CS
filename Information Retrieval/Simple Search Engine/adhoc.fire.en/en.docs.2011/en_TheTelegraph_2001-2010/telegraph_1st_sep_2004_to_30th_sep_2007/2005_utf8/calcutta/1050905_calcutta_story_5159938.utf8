 A vast canvas, a conglomeration of forms, unsteady strokes, bright colours and a pair of flowers depicting a paradigm of imagery? Twins Whispering, a canvas by Madhuri Kapur.

 Just another painting by just another painter? No way. For, Madhuri is a shining example of creativity against all odds. A crippling attack of cerebral palsy has left this 35-year-old achiever confined to the wheelchair since birth.

 She has minimum muscle control and is unable to speak, but with those bright eyes and an innocent smile, Madhuri has simply refused to give up. She paints with a brush tied to a head pointer.

 The strokes, shaky and uneven, are perhaps a reflection of the struggle she undergoes every waking moment, but the abstract creations and the colour schemes speak volumes of her sensibility as an artist. A Beautiful Mind, the Artwalk exhibition presented by The Oberoi Grand in association with Spandan Art Gallery on August 25, was where one witnessed a set of four paintings by Madhuri ? Lotus, Twins Whispering, To Infinity and Oriental Fantasy.

 ?My daughter has been a student of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy. She started painting from the age of six and her journey continues. It feels good to see her achieve such feats,? smiled Saroj Kapur, mother of Madhuri. Her son, too, is physically challenged.

 At the exhibition, Madhuri painted a set of three flowers in splashes of red, yellow, orange and green, her way of saying thank you to the Oberoi Grand management for hosting her moment of glory.

 ?The exhibition is a celebration of creative expression. Madhuri, who is gifted with this inborn talent, is a creator in her own right. She has solo art exhibitions to her credit, too. Her parents, family, well-wishers and her school have been a constant source of inspiration,? says Renu Roy of Spandan.

 Apart from being a diploma-holder in computer applications and a commerce graduate, Madhuri has worked as a junior executive in companies like Shaw Wallace. She has even learnt to type with her head pointer. 

 In 1995, she was selected one of the 10 most outstanding young Indians by the All India Junior Chamber of Jaycees and in 1999, the braveheart bagged the Bharat Nirman Award.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

From a gold medallist in commerce to the most convincing 

lawyer on the small screen, Pawan Shankar (picture by Rashbehari Das) has had 

quite a chequered career. But in the title role of Siddhanth on STAR One, 

he is the next big thing on television. And with Shah Rukh Khan and Irrfan as 

role models, this Allahabadi is poised to take the world of entertainment by storm.

 ?After doing my MBA, a friend and I started a company in Allahabad to make documentaries and for that purpose I used to make regular trips to Mumbai. It was then that people in the industry started telling me that you talk well, look decent, why don?t you go in front of the camera? The acting bug bit me during the inter-management school plays but I was fated to start off with advertisements,? Pawan told Metro on Monday.

 So, after the proverbial Kishore Namit Kapoor acting classes and the Saroj Khan dancing classes, Pawan did do the rounds of Yash Raj Films and Mukta Arts before settling down for a stint with advertisements. In no time, he had shot for more than 20 ads including big products like TVS, Fiat and Reid amp; Taylor. The last-named even found him sharing the frame with Amitabh Bachchan.

 And then came the big break on television. ?Apart from the Bhansalis and Chopras, I feel it is much better to act in a good television serial rather than a B-grade film,? said Pawan. ?If you?re not a star son, it is really difficult for someone to make a foray that easily into cinema. The other option is obviously to shine in serials like the Irrfans and Shah Rukhs and then get into filmdom.?

 And that?s exactly what he hopes to do with Siddhanth. ?I play the central role and I am there for 38 or 39 minutes in ever episode of 42 minutes,? says Pawan. ?It wasn?t easy getting the role. I had to give four rounds of auditions over a period of six months. Initially, the producer and director weren?t convinced about my selection but after the first episode they came up to me and admitted that the choice was just perfect.? 

 As Siddhanth, Pawan is a young, confident and successful lawyer for whom no case is difficult and no crime wrong. Projected as a youth icon, he is also billed as a favourite of the fourth estate. ?At first, they were looking for someone in the 40-year-old age group. Then it was brought down to 35 and finally to the 28-29 bracket. They wanted a newcomer (as with all faces on STAR One) who could carry the whole serial on his shoulders.?

 To prepare for the role, Pawan went to the session courts in Kala Ghoda to get a real taste of the legal negotiations. ?I was also present at real crime situations and while shooting for the serial I tried to stay as close to reality as possible. And after the first 10 episodes that have been aired on television, I?ve had very positive reviews.?

 Right now, it?s only television for the aspiring actor. ?While there are offers for other serials, I do not want to dilute Siddhanth. May be, after a couple of months, I may take up another role.?

 So, to catch Pawan in his courtroom, catch Siddhanth on STAR One, ever Wednesday at 10 pm.

 Swathed in tradition, ritual, folklore and myth comes the Chinese New year. While the preparation starts months in advance, this Spring Festival (as it?s also called) kicks off with a thorough house-cleaning, fresh red paint, paper cut-outs and lots of tasty food denoting happiness, wealth and longevity.

 With the festival having started on February 9 amid colourful dragon dances, restaurants all over will be dishing out exotic delights till the festival of lanterns on February 20.

 Goodlife sets out to explore some Chinese spreads across the city.

Mainland China 

Enter the dragon?s lair at this popular restaurant 

on Gurusaday Road to experience a taste of ancient Chinese custom. Under the magical 

touch of chefs Chan Kai Tak and Rajesh Dubey, the delightful celebration of the 

year of the rooster has come alive. Uncommon dishes, with a focus on chicken, 

kicks off the special menu lasting till February 20.

 The Chicken Eight-Treasure Soup, Prawn Sumai (stuffed flour casings with prawns and vegetables), Pan-fried Chicken with Sesame seeds and Mongolian Skewered Chicken are great items to start with.

 ?Being the year of the rooster, we have a special emphasis on chicken and various traditional delicacies of it that are rather difficult to prepare. Using sauces and ancient recipes, we?ve managed to bring out that Oriental charm that?s prevalent at this time of year,? says chef Rajesh Dubey.

 Fit for a king, Beggar?s Chicken comes ensconced in a clay pot and lotus leaves, with a mystical story of its own. In ancient times, a beggar stole a chicken from the emperor?s palace and buried it underground, wrapped in lotus leaves. He then built a fire above it to warm himself and cooked the chicken underneath. Soldiers were sent looking for the thief, but soon, a heavenly aroma arose that distracted even the emperor. The cook was summoned and so pleased was the emperor with the new dish, that he ordered the thief to be set free. Guests can enjoy an interactive dining experience as they have to break open the clay vessel with a hammer before the dish is ready.

 Other exotic dishes with a tale to tell include the Braised Chicken Drumstick and the Drunken Chicken infused with wine. To round off the meal on a sweet note, one can try the specially-made Strawberry pancakes.

 Meal bill for a couple: Rs 550-800.

Chinoiserie

This prized restaurant at Taj Bengal has always been 

known to dish out exotic delicacies as and when needed. This time, under the able 

guidance of executive chef Surinder Singh, a magnificent display of the dragon 

dance combined with tasty food fare form a part of Chinese New Year celebrations.

 ?Most of what we?ve chosen for this special occasion are whole items ? an entire chicken, fish or duck preparation ? that denote a sense of stability and longevity,? says chef Indranil.

 Opening the new menu for the festivities are some delicious starters like Peking Chicken (served with pancakes, salad and Peking dip) and Chow Ma Tofu (crispy tofu tossed with Szechwan wild peppers). The Cream of Seafood and Crabmeat Soup is worth a try, while vegetarians can opt for the Tofu and Pickled Vegetable Soup. 

 Coming to the main course, one can choose from an assortment of dishes like the Steamed Pink Salmon with Celery, Leeks and Chengdu Oil, the Prawn-Jhang Jhing Style (the chef?s speciality), and the Stir-fried Lapchong with Snowpeas (a subtle blend of Chinese pork sausages and crunchy snow peas with dry red chillies).

 ?Most of these items are traditional ones that are prepared well in advance,? adds Indranil. For vegetarians, the Bai Chai Tofu (silken tofu in five-spice sauce) and Braised Chinese Cabbage with Szechwan Peppers are good options.

 From the sweet section, the Longaan Pancakes with ice-cream is recommended.

 Meal bill for a couple: Rs 1,200.

Red Kitchen amp; Lounge

At Red Kitchen amp; Lounge in Alipore, the Chinese 

New Year has brought along with it not an all-new menu to celebrate the occasion, 

but a select few items in both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections. These 

items will also be on the menu of the two Red Hot Chilli Pepper outlets at Ballygunge 

and Salt Lake till February 20. 

 ?We specialise in Cantonese and Szechwan cuisine and the festival items are a mix of exotic dishes from both these Chinese cooking styles,? says director Bharat Dhamala. 

 The non-vegetarian dishes have chicken, lamb, pork and prawn. Ranging from the non-spicy Braised Chicken Winglet to the tangy Crispy Szechwan Peppery Prawn, there is something for everyone. A must try is the Roast Lamb in Sweet Chilli Sauce.

 Vegetarians can dig into the Brocolli, Snowpeas and Baby Corn in Green Chilli Sauce, specially created by chef Dhamala. 

 Meal bill for a couple: Rs 500-Rs 650

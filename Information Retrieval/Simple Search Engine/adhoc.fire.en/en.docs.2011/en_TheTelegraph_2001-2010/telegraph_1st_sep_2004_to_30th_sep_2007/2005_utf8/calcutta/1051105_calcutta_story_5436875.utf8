 Alipore Zoological Garden will soon have to sit for a test, the result of which will decide its fate ? whether it will be derecognised or granted a renewed recognition.

 However, in the event of a negative assessment, the zoo will get a year to make up for the shortcomings.

 Officials empanelled by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) will visit the zoo on November 14 and 15 to examine every aspect of its functioning and maintenance.

 The CZA recognised the zoo in February 2003 on condition that the authorities would comply with all its recommendations. 

 The recognition, which helps a zoo get funds and engage in animal exchange programmes with zoos across the country and abroad, lapsed on December 31, 2004.

 The CZA panel ? comprising A.T. Rao, retired professor of Orissa Veterinary College, and M. Kamal Naidu, former principal chief conservator of forests, Andhra Pradesh ? will ascertain whether the zoo has followed the recommendations and deserves a renewal of approval. 

 The panel may also call on the state forest secretary.

 ?The forthcoming examination is crucial,? said CZA scientific officer Bipul Chakrabarty. ?If the Alipore zoo fails the test, the recognition will not be renewed and the authorities will be given around a year to conform to the Recognition of Zoo Rules, 1992. If it fails to adopt the measures even after a year, the zoo might be closed down.?

 One of the recommendations of the CZA was that a curator be appointed to look after the upkeep of the animals and maintenance of their enclosures. But the authorities have failed to recruit a curator.

 Sources said the zoo authorities would be grilled on why they had not submitted a master plan detailing the projects they intend to take up in the next five years or why they had never sent annual reports. The zoo will also have to answer whether the primates are allowed adequate open spaces.

 The CZA was formed in 1992 for overseeing the functioning and development of zoos across the country. 

 Only those zoos that are recognised and keep animals in accordance with the norms and standards prescribed by the CZA are allowed to operate.

 Following the closure of 93 zoos, there are now 163 zoos in the country. 

 ?After the Centre adopted a National Zoo Policy in 1998, all major zoos are trying to function professionally. It?s expected the Alipore zoo, too, will do the same,? scientific officer Chakrabarty said.

 The CZA has already evaluated 11 of the 14 zoos it has to grade this year.

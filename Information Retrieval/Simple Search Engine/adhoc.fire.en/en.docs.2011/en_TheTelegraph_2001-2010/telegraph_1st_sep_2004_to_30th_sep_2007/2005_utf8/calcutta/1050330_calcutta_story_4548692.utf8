 Sporty elegance met tinsel town glamour at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Monday evening. The occasion was the launch of a line of limited edition golf watches, designed and developed by Tiger Woods, from the house of Swiss major Tag Heuer. While golfers and club members formed the bulk of the audience, the premium timepiece was unveiled by Bollywood beauty Sushmita Sen, who dazzled the crowd during her brief appearance in a Main Hoon Naa-style shimmering black chiffon.

 The evening kicked off with a Tag Heuer Precision Putting Championship, which saw amateurs as well as professional players teeing off to vie for the first prize that came in the form of two champagne bottles for the winning couple.

 Spirit of fun scored over skill on the greens with members like designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh and Kookie Jar lady Lovey Burman wielding the irons for the first time.

 All eyes were glued to Miss Sen-sational throughout the evening, as she handed over the prizes before unveiling the watch. If Sushmita and the Tiger Woods timepiece were the high points of the event, the elaborate and sumptuous food spread ensured that the crowd had enough left on the plates for the rest of the night after the tall Bengali bombshell left the greens at 9.30 pm.

 The fine blend of sport and style that the evening presented was in perfect sync with the object in focus. The first-of-its-kind watch, developed with specific requirements of professional golfers in mind, marries functionality and style.

 Special features like a titanium body, crown on the opposite side, no buckles and an expandable strap make the watch a perfect accessory for golfers, who normally don?t wear watches while playing because of the discomfort factor, claimed Ravi Thakran, regional managing director, Asia Pacific, LVMH Watch and Jewellery.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Junk jazz. with tribal. trinkets.

From beads and stones in a riot of colours 

to antique lookalikes in white metal the variety in cosmetic jewellery 

is really vibrant. Himika Chaudhuri goes stall-hopping

Flaunting heirloom jewellery and regular trips to 

the branded shop specialising in gold and diamonds might be the right thing to 

do once in a while. The rest of the time, a stroll through the bylanes of New 

Market or a trip to Meena Bazar in Swabhumi is good to jazz up your jewellery 

box with a range of interesting imitation ornaments.

Earrings in white metal, strings of jade and sapphire 

lookalikes, antique-look silver-coloured jewellery the range is fascinating.

There are changing trends in junk jewellery collections, 

too. Thus, a cosmetic jewellery seller in any part of Calcutta will now tell you 

that stones are doing well, though the oxidised look was the favoured pick 

till about the middle of 2004. 

Also, the kind of junk jewellery you can pick up will 

differ significantly between various pockets that sell these popular accessories. 

While stalls in New Market have a larger collection of a gold-coloured metal designed 

traditionally, Meena Bazar specialises in the exotic variety of white metal with 

stones, beads and even paintings on them.

?The designs of most of the pieces are inspired by 

jewellery sported by characters from television serials,? announces Rajen Jain, 

at a stall off New Market.

Huge rings studded with imitation stones substitute 

for rings flaunted by popular television character Ramola from the serial Kahin 

Kissi Roz, while bangles like those worn by Tulsi Virani from Kyunki? Saas 

Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi also find pride of place.

For those who don?t live off the small screen and 

would rather sport more real and wearable pieces, Meena Bazar in Swabhumi and 

Hangout in City Centre are the spots to scout. 

The well-designed innovative jewellery goes well with 

both western and ethnic outfits. Here is what you can pick up and why.

Neck line

Coloured beads and stones are the biggest draw in 

the neckwear section at this point in time. The look is definitely Tibetan with 

large silver plates as pendants embellished with carvings and studded with red, 

black and blue matte-finish stones ? typical of the curio shops in Darjeeling. 

Large is big this season as long neckpieces with pendants the size of a CD are 

on song.

The more subtle dresser can go for strings of coloured 

stones that manage to look almost real ? jade, amethyst, cats eye, the choice 

is varied. Priced between Rs 400 and Rs 1,200 depending on the stones used, these 

are doing well with the older brigade.

Strings of beads bundled together with an ivory-shaped 

wooden pendant look trendy without seeming garish. Dokra work is in, too, 

with small figurines in metal as pendants. These pieces, just right for the college-goer, 

are priced at an affordable Rs 25.

Larger pieces in dokra work with pendants in 

abstract forms come for Rs 200. Chokers are in this season with pieces 

in bright and dull silver colour up for grabs. Here, too, the designs are tribal 

in nature and the look is chunky. But if worn with a plain outfit, these look 

really cool. The price tag: Rs 150-plus.

All ears

Chandeliers are out even in the junk jewellery circuit. 

?These don?t sell any longer,? says Sujit Seal who runs a stall in Hangout in 

City Centre. 

Loop earrings in colourful printed plastic, soon to 

be made popular by Dia Mirza in Parineeta, are the hottest things to pick 

for the campus crowd. These are priced reasonably at Rs 45 a pair. 

The silver look is in, feel sellers who are doing 

brisk business with everything from teddy bears to leaves and flowers to abstract 

forms ready to adorn ears. The upper range is Rs 150. 

Arm appeal

Large wooden beads are out for sure. Like everywhere 

else, bright colours are in, with small beads in various colours being used as 

the base for the arm and wrist bands on which stones are being used for embellishments. 

Dangles from the wristbands, like stars and cartoon characters, are in for the 

young brigade. 

The mature dresser can go for an interesting string 

of large shiny coins in basic colours like blue, green and yellow. Prices range 

between Rs 50 and Rs 100.

Waist wonders

This accessory needs to be part of the wardrobe of 

the adventurous and find its way into nightclubs.

Designed like a payel, complete with danglers 

and bells, these are available in silver coloured metal only. With promises to 

jazz up any outfit, these can be worn well with denims to give the fusion look. 

Priced at Rs 200.

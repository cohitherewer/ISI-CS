 Vintage and romantic inspirations developed on a strong foundation of denim ? that, in a nutshell, is the look from international fashion player Tommy Hilfiger for fall/winter 2005-06.

 The collection was launched in the Calcutta store at 10, Elgin Road amidst a wine-and-cheese party on Thursday evening. The select crowd not only got to check out the new lines on the racks, up-close glimpses of the outfits were provided by models Shyla Lopez, Shayon Munshi, Zulfi Sayed and VJ Archana, who paraded the clothes on the store floor.

 Our fall/winter collection is based on various interesting inspirations. While the overall feel is vintage and rustic chic, one of the lines portrays the American university look. This draws from the old college days and the clothes are pretty, classic and sporty. Theres another one inspired by the outdoor look and countryside scenario. This one is dominated by burgundy and green, says Carlos Cortez, stylist from Tommy Hilfiger, New York, who was in town to launch the line.

 The feminine fall look focuses a lot on denims, which come in a variety of washes to lend the vintage feel, and new fits like the extra low-rise jeans. Five-pocket jeans, back-pocket embroidery, detailed hardware and unusual thread colours are the highlights of the denims.

 For the uppers there are beautiful shirts and camisoles made of soft satins and silks, often with touches of lace, beading and velvet. Sweaters abound in variety ? from pretty crochet and cable stitches to the signature ribbed styles. Ballet-wrap cardigans in a variety of colours and shrunken jackets are the other offerings.

 For men, the collection comprises winter essentials with a rock roll edge. Rugby uppers with stripes, and solids in navy and rich burgundy, are teamed with denims. Five-pocket, 13-ounce hand-sanded denims with a light vintage wash and texture are the new twist to the classic fabric.

 The outdoors collection has the hues of fall foliage ? maple greens, rusts and browns. Its a weekend getaway line with laid-back clothes like woven shirts, sweaters and denims again.

 Handbags, belts, small leather goods, caps, watches, lingerie, footwear and fragrances are all part of the new fall/winter collection.

 We also have new (rustic) lines in the Tommy Hilfiger Home collection, comprising bed and bath range, to be launched here in a couple of weeks, says Carlos.

The Eastern Railway coach depot and sorting yard at Tikiapara, Howrah, on Wednesday opened a high-tech effluent treatment plant.

 It has been a long-standing complaint of the residents of the area that effluents from the plant were polluting the locality and the Hooghly.

 The Tikiapara set-up is the largest coach depot of the Indian Railways. More than 1,200 coaches and more than 40 express and passenger trains are maintained there. A total of 60,000 gallons of effluents flow out of the yard into the Hooghly every working day.

 Shyam Kumar, Eastern Railway general manager, inaugurated the plant. ?This combined set-up is a model for other yards,? he said. ?Our goal is to mechanise the processes for workers who do the cleaning.?

 Kumar warned staff against turning complacent: ?There is a tendency to turn smug once a good job is done. Our journey doesn?t end here.?

 The plant has been constructed at a cost of Rs 23 lakh. It has a capacity of treating 4.8 m litres of water a day and can run continuously for 24 hours, a senior rail official said. 

 After treatment at the plant, the effluent conforms to IS:2490 (Part-I) and can be used as inland surface water.

 Illegal tag on doctor shield

 - FEB. DATE FOR APEX COURT HEARING ON IMMUNITY

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Supreme Court will initiate in February 2006 the final hearing on a writ petition challenging the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s policy to shield doctors against charges of medical negligence.

 The petition has been filed by People for Better Treatment (PBT), comprising doctors and other professionals. It describes as illegal Bhattacharjee?s recent statements that doctors could be arrested for medical negligence only if the charges are cleared by a panel of medical experts.

 ?The Constitution does not give a chief minister the right to provide immunity against the Indian Penal Code to members of a particular profession. Our petition highlights the issue,? said Kunal Saha, president of the organisation.

 Saha also accused the Indian Medical Association (IMA) of misinterpreting earlier judgments of the Supreme Court. ?The association claims that the apex court had barred police from arresting doctors for criminal negligence. On the contrary, the court had categorically ruled that the internationally-accepted Bolam principle would be followed by our judiciary as well.?

 The Bolam principle states that a doctor can be charged with ?criminal? negligence if he acts in a manner not followed by other ?responsible? medical bodies and if the treatment results in a loss of life.

 The issue came to light about a year-and-a-half ago, when doctors were being arrested for almost every case of alleged medical negligence. ?We could not let this go on, simply because police do not have the knowledge to even understand medical terminology or exactly what has led to the death of a patient,? said Malay Patra, former IMA secretary.

 With the doctors? lobbies coming out against what they called ?irrational and illogical arrests?, the chief minister finally assured them on July 1, during Doctors? Day celebrations, that medical practitioners could be arrested only after an experts? panel cleared the charges of medical negligence.

 To take their ?movement? forward, PBT has decided to join hands with other social organisations, including the Jana Swasthya Swadhikar Mancha.

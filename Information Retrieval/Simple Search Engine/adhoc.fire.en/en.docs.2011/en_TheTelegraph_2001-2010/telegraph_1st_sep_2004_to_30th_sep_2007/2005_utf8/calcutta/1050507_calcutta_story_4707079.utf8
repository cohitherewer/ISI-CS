 20-day bride found dead

 - Techie husband, mother held; police suspect foul play

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Twenty days after marriage, 30-year-old Sanjukta Mukherjee was found dead in her Salt Lake home. Her husband, a software professional with a multinational company, and his mother were arrested on Friday.

 On Thursday afternoon, Sanjukta was found dead, apparently after having consumed poison. Her husband Arindam Sarkar and mother-in-law Jinjira have been arrested by officers of Bidhannagar (North) police station on a complaint lodged by her father Samar Mukherjee.

 ?They will be produced in court on Saturday,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, on Friday.

 The match was made through a matrimonial website and the two were married on April 19.

 A domestic help discovered Sanjukta lying motionless on her bed in the BD block home. A doctor living next door was called in. He pronounced her dead. She was then taken to two private hospitals in the township, where she was declared brought dead and refused admission.

 On Thursday night, after the family called the police, the body was taken for post-mortem. Police also said there were injury marks on the body, which could indicate foul play.

 ?Arindam has been suffering from some neurological disorder for some time,? police revealed on Friday.

 Sanjukta?s family, living in north Calcutta, was aware that the young woman was in distress. ?When she came back for the first time after marriage, there was fear in her eyes,? recalled Soma Mitra, Sanjukta?s cousin.

 ?She said Arindam had to take strong medicines. If he did not take them on time, he turned violent,? added Soma.

 Sanjukta, who was about to complete her Ph.D in zoology, did not want to go back to her in-laws?, but her family persuaded her that things might work out. She returned on April 23.

 ?The family told us Arindam was suffering from depression after his father?s death six months ago,? said Sanjukta?s mother Anubhuti. 

 ?Before the wedding, Arindam had said he had no problem if Sanjukta went abroad to study. After marriage, however, he insisted that she find herself a job,? claimed Anubhuti.

 At the time of his wife?s death, Arindam was in office. ?He returned home only around 8.30 pm,? said a Bidhannagar (North) police officer.

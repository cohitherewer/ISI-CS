 Sipping on martinis at The Junction in Taj Bengal is a cool way to beat the heat. The ongoing martini festival is offering 101 versions of the drink known to be close to the heart, or should we say the lips, of secret agent James Bond.

 Martini is one of the most popular cocktails worldwide. There are so many varieties that if one tries a different mix each day, one will still have something new to taste after three months, said a spokesperson for the hotel. 

 Some of the popular picks at the promotion are Classic Martini (a concoction of gin and dry vermouth), Golden Bronx (sweet vermouth and orange juice), Vodkatini (vodka and dry vermouth) and Slow Poison (a vodka and Brazilian coffee mix). 

 A drink costs Rs 365 to Rs 415 at the festival, which is on for the entire month of June. 

 Lounge lap

 Members of Saturday Club fought off mid-week crisis to chill at the lounge night on Wednesday. 

 The special night was just another excuse to party in the middle of the week and guzzle some chilled beer.

 Weekend was still a few days away and members did a sensible thing by starting as early as 8.30 in the evening, warming up to some lounge music churned out by resident DJ Feroze.

 Once the mood peaked, the party people put on their dancing shoes to groove to the usual repertoire of Kaal dhamaal, Woh lamhe, Teri toh and Bheege honth.

 Given the response tonight, we may host a lounge night every alternate Wednesday, promised the DJ at the Wood Street club.

 Durrie spread

 Dress up your house with colourful durries made by Santhal women, on display at the Crafts Council of West Bengal at 13 Chowringhee Terrace. 

 Though not a part of their traditional skills, the durries programme was initiated to provide an alternative source of sustenance to Santhal women who had approached the Crafts Council centre in Santiniketan for work. 

 The council insisted on enrolling these women in a stringent two-year programme that required a lot of mathematical precision, and soon they were able to weave durries effortlessly. They now make these at home and sell them at Sonajhuri Haat every week.

 The ongoing exhibition, till June 7, seeks to empower these women further by providing them with a platform to show off their talent. 

 The range of durries is earthy both in the use of colours and design patterns. Stripes, squares and geometric designs dominate. Blues, greens and browns rule the colour scheme.

 The range on display includes durries priced from Rs 750 with a special introductory offer of 15 per cent discount, cushion covers starting at Rs 150, table mat sets between Rs 200 and 350, and blinds for Rs 600. 

 Scarf style

 Who said scarves are only made of fabric? Now flaunt scarves made of semi-precious stones to turn heads at the next party. 

 Call them what you will, the accessory that looks more like a bejewelled rope will sure help you make a unique statement. An offering from Varda Goenka, the jewellery designer behind Diagold, the neckpieces can be styled in various ways. These gel well with both western and Indian outfits. You can carry it off with a sari or use it to accessorise an off-shoulder top, advised Varda. We were not able to make wide scarves since that would require weaving the stones into a fabric, she added.

 To ensure that the pieces are affordable, the designer has used uncut and semi-precious stones that keep the starting price low at Rs 4,000.

 Another new addition to the citys fashion accessories list is a scarf-like object woven in gold and silver, without any stone embellishments. These are imported from Thailand and are also available at Diagold.

 Glare glitz

 Titan Industries is making a summer splash in the fashion accessories segment with its latest range of sunglasses titled Fastrack. 

 The stylish range has been targeted at the age group of 20 to 25 years. The attitude and needs of todays youth are very different. They are more conscious about the way they project themselves and are constantly looking to create a distinct identity. They can be classified as the office-goer, caf? yuppie, weekend party animal or biking enthusiast ? the Fastrack range has been created for them, said a spokesperson. 

 The collection is divided into four brands ? Acid, Caf?, City Silk and Rev V ? each conveying a distinct attitude and feel. These can be found in a variety of colours, ranging from amber, cool blue and light orange to the regular black and brown. The frames are made from corrosion-resistant stainless steel and magnesium aluminium alloy, while the lenses are in two tone colours and are supposed to be made of high-quality optical grade polycarbonate. 

 UV protection, impact resistance and anti-glare properties are other features. Priced between Rs 1,295 and Rs 1,595, these have been classified within the designer eyewear segment. The Fastrack range is available at leading stores like Shoppers Stop, Westside and MusicWorld.

 Denim comfort

 If thick denim is leaving you more hot than cool, a pair of jeans perfect for summer could finally have arrived.

 Lee, the popular casual wear brand, has just come up with a new fabric that looks like denim but works like linen.

 We have introduced a new linen-denim line for the summer months. The new fabric has 70 per cent fine cotton and 30 per cent linen, thus packing in both comfort and style, said Chakor Jain, brand head, Lee.

 The lighter and softer linen-denim lowers are available across the multi-brand outlets in the city and at Lees standalone store in City Centre. Priced at Rs 1,499 for women and Rs 1,599 for men, the jeans are available in light and dark indigo shades.

 The multinational hopes the innovation will work in the city. The Calcutta market has become more fashion conscious than ever before, with people better travelled and more aware of current trends at the national and international levels, explained Jain.

 In fact, Lees demand graphs show that denim wearers in conservative Calcutta are slowly shifting away from the traditional five-pocket, straight-leg variety. They want better washes and styles now, which they were not conscious about even recently, said Jain.

 The brand is also ready with other new lines, including Paradise City and Freewheeling for the young buyer and X-line, a premium range.

 The Paradise City collection has been specially created for summer holidays, with bright colours and Hawaiian prints dominating the summer tops and lowers including skirts and hot pants.

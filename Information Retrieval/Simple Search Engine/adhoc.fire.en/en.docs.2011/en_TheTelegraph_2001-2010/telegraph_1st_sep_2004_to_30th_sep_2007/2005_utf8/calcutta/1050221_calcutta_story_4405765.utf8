Screen On amp; Off

 Clint Eastwood: Another one?

 Interestingly, Golden Globes, the predictive precursor to the Oscar awards every year, has always had separate categories for musicals, dramas and comedies. The Academy on the other hand started off with separate categories for comedies and dramas for Best Director. Then the comedy group was dropped and the drama tag was taken off leaving just one award for the most important man of the medium.

 The favoured ones: While there are films like Ben Hur and Titanic which bagged 11 Oscars, one single man notched up 12 Best Director nominations in his life. William Wyler, the man behind classics like Roman Holiday and Ben Hur, won a dozen Oscar nods between 1936 and 1965, winning the statuette only thrice for Mrs. Miniver (1942), The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) and, of course, Ben Hur (1959). 

 John Ford won the most number of Best Director Oscars and also had the best conversion rate winning four times out of his five nominations. Ford didn?t win many for the quintessential Westerns that he was known for, bagging the beauties for The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green Was My Valley (1941) and The Quiet Man (1952). Ford didn?t even win for his all-time classic, Stagecoach (1939).

 Martin Scorsese: Fifth time lucky?

Frank Capra won thrice in the five years between 1934 

and 1938 for his comedies, It Happened One Night (1934), Mr. Deeds Goes 

to Town (1936) and You Can?t Take It With You (1938). While as many 

as 14 directors have won the Oscar statuette twice, the famous ones to do so include 

Billy Wilder, David Lean, Elia Kazan, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone and Milos 

Forman.

 Those who missed out: Some of the biggest names in global film-making haven?t bagged the much-coveted Oscar award despite being nominated on more than one occasion. They include Robert Altman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Alfred Hitchcock, James Ivory, Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Ang Lee, George Lucas, Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott and Peter Weir.

This year:

 It?s the fifth time one of Hollywood?s most respected directors, Martin Scorsese, has been nominated and the Academy has yet to honour him with the biggest accolade. This time, though, he is in with more than an outside chance to lay his hands on the trophy. With his biopic of billionaire Howard Hughes, The Aviator, in the run for 11 statuettes, Scorsese is the runaway favourite.

 Alexander Payne: Dark horse

However, Golden Globe winner Clint Eastwood has been 

a favourite at the Oscars having won in 1992 for Unforgiven. He lost out 

to Peter Jackson last year but Million Dollar Baby is a better bet with 

the Academy members than Mystic River. 

 Seventeen years back, Taylor Hackford won the Best Short Film award for Teenage Father and this year, for the first time, he is running for the Best Director Oscar for the Ray Charles biopic, Ray. 

 The dark horse for this year?s Best Director Oscar trophy is Alexander Payne for Sideways, a bittersweet story of relationships. Payne was previously nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay category for Election in 1999.

 Mike Leigh rounds off the nomination list with his film Vera Drake about a cheerful, hard-working wife and mother in post-war England who sometimes provides assistance to women who want to end their pregnancies. Leigh had earlier been nominated in 1996 for Secrets amp; Lies.

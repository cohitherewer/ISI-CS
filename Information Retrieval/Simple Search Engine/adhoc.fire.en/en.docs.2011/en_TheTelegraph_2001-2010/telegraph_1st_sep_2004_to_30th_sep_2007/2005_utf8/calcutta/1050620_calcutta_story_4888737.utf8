The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 6-month delay in CU nod 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Uncertainty looms over Umeshchandra College?s plans to introduce graduation courses in arts, science, business administration and vocational subjects on its new campus in Salt Lake. Calcutta University has been non-committal for over six months now on the issue of affiliation.

 The college, one of the eight City group of colleges, now offers only commerce courses. It was with the intention of introducing courses in other streams that the authorities had acquired the plot in Salt Lake 15 years ago.

 ?We had applied for ?extension of affiliation? to both the university and the state higher education council on December 22, but there has been no response,? said L.N. Ray, chairman of the college governing body. ?We had raised our own resources and built two floors so that classes could start in July. But the university is yet to conduct an inspection,? he added.

 Despite repeated attempts by the college authorities to seek clarifications from vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee and other senior officials, the university has remained virtually incommunicado. 

 The college has also written to Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, chancellor of the university, and apprised chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of the situation.

 In its application, the college had stated that all its proposed courses would be self-financed and that it would not seek any help from the state government. 

 Some of these courses, like BA in human rights, and communication and media studies, and vocational course in sports management, are not offered by any college affiliated to Calcutta University.

 Ray feels a reason for the delay in granting the affiliation could be the university?s worry over recruitment of teachers by the college. ?Last year, the Supreme Court had ruled in a case filed in 1983 that we could recruit teachers on our own, instead of going through the West Bengal College Service Commission,? said Ray.

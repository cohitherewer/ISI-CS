 Sudipta Chakraborty: Juggling roles

 In the quiet off the EM Bypass, behind Peerless Hospital, stands Jahnavi, the performing arts centre. Conceived by Bharatanatyam dancer Madhubani Chatterjee five years ago, it wasn?t until a week back that the doors were formally opened.

 Run and funded by the dancer and her family, the centre aims to provide all-round development for aspiring artistes through workshops and lessons in Sanskrit. ?I want to provide those facilities which we in our times found difficult to get,? says Madhubani who has been training since age four. Thus, workshops by performers of repute will be subsidised at Jahnavi, while those talented but unable to pay even the slashed rates may also find free entry. 

 The purpose of introducing Sanskrit is to broaden the knowledge base of students by teaching them the Vedas and the Upanishad. ?While practising various art forms, students often lose sight of the final result and get tired of what seems like an unending road. These scriptures help in self-analysis and control,? she adds.

 Almost as soon as The Vagina Monologues gained popularity, the jokes started. Men everywhere wanted a play of their own to tell their side of the tale. 

 And now they have it. The Penis Monologues: Men Speak has finally been written. And trashed. Flaccid and limp (the puns were just waiting to happen) were only the more polite names it got called after its recent debut off Broadway.

 The three actors ? Lev Gorn, Christian Johnstone and Steve Luker ? who tell what the writer-director Robert Watts claims are real-life stories, do express their admiration for Eve Ensler?s landmark play. ?As we listened, learned, and digested everything before us, we wondered, what about us??

 By all accounts, The Penis Monologues could have worked. But it has been scathingly attacked for falling flat in feeble attempts at wit. It doesn?t use the platform to explore valid areas of concern for men, as there undoubtedly are. It did, however, come in for some praise for its comic moments as well as a handful of more weighty ones. Like the tale of a man suffering from penile cancer.

 However, most of the voices have been, despite commendable performances, condemned as caricatures ? like the limp-wristed gay man who, through a series of affairs, looks for love his father never gave him, and the man who believes nothing but size matters. Condom concerns and the glory of Viagra are also worked in.

 Possibly if The Vagina Monologues hadn?t been a highly regarded success that handled the subject of female sexuality with such sensitivity, the smugness of this take off would have been tolerated.

 For a first-time production, Eena Meena Deeka does reasonably well. Written and directed by Rajarshi Dey, of the recently-formed group Addiction, the play traces the common chord between three women ? Eena, Meena and Deeka ? hailing from different social strata. 

 The arresting script coupled with dance sequences and audio-visual back-up makes the play a visual treat. Sudipta Chakraborty has played all three parts with elan. 

 The next show is on May 8 at 10.30 am, Academy of Fine Arts.

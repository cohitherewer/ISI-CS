The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The staff at the counter for updating passbooks of savings account holders 

at the GPO asks customers to deposit the passbooks and collect it after a couple 

of days. Senior citizens and others who come from distant places find it very 

difficult to go all the way to the GPO again just to collect the updated passbooks. 

In banks, updating of passbooks is done in 10 to 15 minutes. I fail to understand 

why this cannot be done at the GPO as well. I hope the authorities concerned will 

look into the problem and make things easier for their customers. 

 Amar Nath Singh, Rishra. 

 On March 7, I went to Allahabad Bank?s Ultadanga branch with all necessary 

documents to open a savings account. But the staff members categorically told 

me to come after the 15th of the month as they were busy before that. They were 

also continuously cribbing about work pressure. Perhaps, it is because of such 

attitude that customers are shifting to private sector banks. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 In the last two decades, several private computer training centres have opened 

in the city and the suburbs. Earlier, students used to rush to enrol in computer 

courses hoping for better career options. But nowadays the volume seems to be 

on the downslide. 

 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road. 

 Packaged salt is not available in many rural areas in the state. Though the 

World Health Organisation has been advocating the use of iodised, packaged salt, 

why doesn?t the state government make it available to all the rural people? 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, Hooghly. 

 During a recent visit, I found that aerograms were not available in the post offices at Park Circus and Park Street. The few that were offered were unfit for use.

 Maureen Lobo,

 Park Circus.

 There seems to be two different bus routes under route number 3C/1. One originates 

from Nagerbazar and plies on Raja Ram Mohun Sarani while the other from Dum Dum 

Park and via Sealdah. This creates much confusion among passengers. The authorities 

should immediately allot a different route number to one of them. 

 Biman Saha, Lake Town.

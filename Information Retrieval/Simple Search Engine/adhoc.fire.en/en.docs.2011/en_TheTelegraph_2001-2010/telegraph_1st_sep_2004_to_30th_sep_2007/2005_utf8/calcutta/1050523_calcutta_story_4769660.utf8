 Consumer forum battles backlog

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sandhya Majumdar, a resident of south Calcutta, waited two long years before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed a city doctor to pay Rs 80,000 as compensation to her in a medical negligence case. Sandhya had allegedly lost her vision post a cataract operation.

 However, the wait for justice at the state consumer forum need not be this long in the future for consumers like Sandhya. With a huge backlog of cases, along with revision petitions and original cases, the authorities have taken measures to speed up the process.

 The commission, officials said, is now aiming at disposing of cases within 90 days.

 In the past six months, the number of pending cases have come down from 2,790 to 1,100 as a result of a series of measures initiated by present president of the commission, Justice Moloy Basu.

 Now, a consumer filing an appeal against a lower court judgment is asked by the commission to prepare a paperbook, containing details of the case. ?Earlier, the state commission used to seek records from the lower courts, which was a lengthy process,? explained an official. With the consumer providing all details in the paperbook, the case proceeds at a swifter pace.

 In cases related to medical negligence, the commission asks the rival parties to file a gist of the case, along with short notes of argument. Thus, instead of analysing an elaborate argument on the date of the hearing, the state commission is able to get the case details beforehand.

 Also, at the beginning of the day?s work a ?mentioning period? has been introduced, where the lawyer can appeal to the commission to take up hearing of a case on a priority basis if it is an urgent or significant one.

 Hironmoy Brahmachari, president of the Consumer Court Bar Association, said: ?The consumers are already reaping the benefits.?

 Besides, plans are afoot to start a second bench at the commission. ?Once the second bench starts functioning, there will hardly be any backlog,? said Prabir Basu, member of State Consumer Protection Council, government of West Bengal. Presently, there is a two-member bench, headed by Justice Basu.

 As of now, matters relating to medical negligence, which require considerable time in being disposed of, top the list of the pending cases at the commission, officials said.

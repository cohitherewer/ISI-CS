 Parvin Dabas in Monsoon Wedding

 From the too-good-to-be-true groom in Monsoon Wedding to the stunning images from the deep waters of the South Asian waters, Parvin Dabas is facing something of an identity crisis. ?That?s the reason I never held an exhibition of my underwater pictures. People would have said I was not getting film work and was thinking of another career option,? says the handsome man whose female fan following is starting to compete with the likes of John Abraham and Dino Morea.

 But now, ?with lots of forthcoming films?, Parvin is ready to showcase what he clicked when he took the plunge into sea waters. From August 16, Olive?s in Bandra will feature the works of Parvin Dabas the underwater photographer. Fish, corals, macros and creative abstracts ? the actor has put together a striking melange of colours from the Malaysian islands of Redang and Sipadan.

 Parvin picked up the camera as a kid, but only when he went snorkelling was he exposed to the magic of underwater photography. ?I have always had this love-hate relationship with water. So once I got hooked to snorkelling, I clicked around with the throwaway underwater camera I had. I soon realised that I just loved being under water? it was a completely different world in there.?

 To further this passion, Parvin did a scuba-diving course and followed it up with an underwater photography course in Phuket. ?People here in India have not been exposed much to underworld life. It?s an exhilarating feeling and very relaxing. So I have been clicking for around four to five years and now that I am confident to show it to the public, I am ready to share the pictures with my friends and family. While I am also selling the pictures, what?s more important is exposing the beautiful things present in nature. I am not interested in showing pictures of dirty garbage.?

 In the middle of all these underwater adventures, Parvin has been able to bag the best of screen projects, including the American miniseries The Curse of King Tut?s Tomb and the British film Memsahib, being made by the producers of the Halle Berry-starrer Monster?s Ball. While mainstream masala fare from Mumbai has come calling, Parvin has chosen to stay away. ?I do recognise the commercial path of Indian cinema but I choose not to tread it. I believe you only live once. So if I can identify with all these different genres of cinema and like the nice variety that is being offered from outside, why shouldn?t I do them??

 Memsahib is one film that?s left Parvin content. ?It?s a very exciting film. It?s set in the 1850s but it?s not like The Rising or anything. It?s more of a personal film? a dramatic love story about this Indian maharaja and his British wife (played by Emily Hamilton).?

 For The Curse of King Tut?s Tomb, Parvin shot in Jaipur. ?While the story is set in Egypt, we shot in Rajasthan and did some indoors in Mumbai. It?s a huge project along the lines of The Mummy. It boasts of a big international cast.?

 Of the offbeat Indian fare that?s on Parvin?s plate, there?s Khosla Ka Ghosla, Tumse Milkar, Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara and a new project called Fusion, which he is most excited about. ?It?s being directed by Delhi-based Madhu Sarkar, who is the sister of Parineeta director Pradeep 

 Sarkar and also stars Nandana Dev Sen.?

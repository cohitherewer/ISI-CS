 Old form, new fees

 - CIVIC LICENCES AT 1899 RATES

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic conservancy department has been issuing licences for temporary constructions on roads or pavements under the provisions of an obsolete act, adopted in 1899.

 But the amount the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) charges for such constructions doesn?t match with what is printed on the over-leaf of the licence or the bill, which still follows the old monetary system of anna and paisa.

 For instance, the rate printed on the licence paper for a structure is ?five paise per square foot?. But the civic body charges 200 times more, Rs 10 per square foot per day.

 Similarly, the printed rate for stacking merchandise or furniture in a temporary construction is ?2 annas per article per month?.

 The obsolete Act, however, has not lost its relevance, as owners of houses or commercial establishments, who want to repair the buildings, are required to obtain a civic licence for stacking material or erecting a scaffolding on a pavement or a road.

 It?s surprising that the civic authorities,who took no time to change the name of the city from Calcutta to Kolkata in all its signboards and documents following the state government?s announcement, is yet to change the format of the licence.

 CMC?s deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh cannot be more forthright: ?It is illegal on our part to invoke an obsolete Act. The citizen has every right to refuse to pay the charges.? 

 The licence forms are printed in the CMC?s press, on the ground floor of the SN Banerjee Road building. The last lot was printed in 2000.

 The only update the printing department thought was enough to avert any possible legal wrangle was affixing the words ?The Calcutta Municipal Corporation? to the licence bill. The civic body, earlier known as Calcutta Corporation, was rechristened Calcutta Municipal Corporation in 1981.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee was surprised when his attention was drawn to the matter. ?Neither the conservancy department, nor the audit department nor the superintendent of the printing press has ever pointed it out,? he told Metro. 

 The format of the licence, known as Form No. AC 296, is no longer valid, Mukherjee said. The format was prepared under section 25 of the Bengal General Clauses Act, 1899.

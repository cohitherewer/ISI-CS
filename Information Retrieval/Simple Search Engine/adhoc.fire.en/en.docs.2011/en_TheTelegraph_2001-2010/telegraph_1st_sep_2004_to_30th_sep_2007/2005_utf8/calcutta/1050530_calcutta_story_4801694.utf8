 Jail or fine for foliage damage

 Chandrima Ghosh: Can you take action against people who tear leaves or cause harm to trees inside parks?

 Since parks are set up in non-forest land, we can?t punish such people. However, we can take stringent action against the guilty in areas that have been declared as forest land by the state government. Anyone causing harm to the greenery can be jailed or fined up to Rs 50,000. If the offender uses a vehicle, we can even seize it. If someone destroys the greenery, tears leaves, plucks flowers or dirties non-forest areas like parks, we can only detain him and can hand him over to police.

 We are often blamed for not clearing uprooted trees or branches from city roads. I would like to take this opportunity to mention that it is not the forest department?s responsibility to do that. The agency maintaining a particular road or park must clear the uprooted trees or their branches. We often see people collecting branches for firewood. We strongly object to this, but there is nothing that we can do.

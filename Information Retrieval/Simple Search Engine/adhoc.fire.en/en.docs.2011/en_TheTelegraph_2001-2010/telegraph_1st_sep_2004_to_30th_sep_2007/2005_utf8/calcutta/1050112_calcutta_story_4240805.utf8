 Suicide in second attempt

 - Phenyl fails, detained youth hangs himself with bandage 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Unable to bear the humiliation of being apprehended for relieving himself in a public place, a 21-year-old inmate of Howrah Correctional Home, formerly known as Howrah Jail, succeeded in his second attempt at suicide on Tuesday morning.

 Police said Ramesh Kumar, originally from Balia, in Uttar Pradesh, hanged himself from the ceiling of a toilet in Howrah District Hospital. He had been admitted to the hospital after he consumed phenyl at the correctional home on Monday morning.

 ?We cannot fathom what prompted him to attempt suicide a second time,? said Amal Krishna Ghosh, superintendent of the correctional home. 

 ?Kumar used a long strip of bandage to hang himself from an iron hook on the ceiling. He climbed on to the commode to fasten the bandage to the hook,? a police officer said.

 An attending doctor of the hospital pointed out that it would have been impossible for Kumar to walk out of the ward and into the toilet unnoticed, unless the guards at the ward door had left the spot. 

 However, police maintained that Kumar was fast asleep when they checked on him late in the night and insisted there was adequate security arrangement in the ward.

 Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel had arrested Kumar at Howrah station on January 8. He was booked for ?committing nuisance on the railway station premises? under Section 145 of the Indian Railways Act. 

 As the railway court was closed for the weekend, he was produced in the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court and sentenced to 10 days? judicial custody, a senior jail official revealed. 

 Usually, a nominal fine is imposed for such offences, but Kumar had not been able to pay the sum.

 On Monday morning, wardens at the correctional home suspected nothing amiss when Kumar went to the toilet. Once inside, he locked the door and swallowed a bottle of phenyl kept there.

 ?We washed the phenyl out of his stomach and he was better within two hours. He was under medical supervision for a day at the hospital,? a hospital official said. Superintendent of the hospital H.K. Chanda said an inquiry into the matter will be initiated. 

 The body has been sent for post-mortem and Kumar?s relatives have been informed.

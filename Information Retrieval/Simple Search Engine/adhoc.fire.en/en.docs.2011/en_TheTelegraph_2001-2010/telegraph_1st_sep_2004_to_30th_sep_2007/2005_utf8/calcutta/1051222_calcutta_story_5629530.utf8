 Disc it, don?t risk it

 - Police draw up morality code for Christmas revellers, bars and nightclubs

 OUR BUREAU

 Christmas is about revelry but not without restraint. It?s about partying till dawn but not driving home drunk, about having a blast but not clicking others having one. That would sum up the morality lessons police have lined up for the entertainment players in the countdown to 2006.

 ?We will take care of your safety and security on the streets during the festive days. But for this, you will also have to help keep things under control,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 To keep the festive fortnight trouble-free, commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee will meet a group of 80 representatives from nightclubs, bars, restaurants and hotels.

 ?We have been called for a meeting with the police on Thursday afternoon,? confirmed Vinay Jaiswal of Hotel Hindusthan International.

 ?Though these meetings would take place earlier as well, this time, nobody wants to leave anything to chance. Police want to know which hotel is doing what, the precautionary measures each of them is adopting and the relevant permissions that are required,? he observed. ?The general law-and-order situation will also come under the scanner,? he added.

 The one thing cops have already decided to crack down on is the deadline to down a drink. ?We will not allow a single drop of liquor to be served after 4 am at five-star hotels and 2 am for other bars and restaurants,? said Sharma.

 The revelry points will be asked to beef up internal security arrangements. ?We will deploy policemen outside the hotels, but they will have to keep a close watch on the revellers to prevent any untoward incident,? said an officer.

 ?They will also have to make parking arrangements according to the expected footfall and take steps to prevent any trouble caused by the use of cell phones as spycams or by lewd behaviour on their premises,? he added.

 But if party trends are any indication, police can breathe relatively easy this weekend, with the Christmas carnival billed to be ?cold? compared to the New Year blast.

 ?This year, the hype for Christmas Eve is far less. Christmas is more about private parties and time spent with family and friends at clubs or at home. The party people will really go berserk on 31st Nite,? said the manager of a night club.

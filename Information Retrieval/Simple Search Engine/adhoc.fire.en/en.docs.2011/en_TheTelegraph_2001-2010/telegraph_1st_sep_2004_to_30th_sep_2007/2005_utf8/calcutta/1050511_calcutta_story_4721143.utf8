The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor changes eviction stand

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bowing to public pressure, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has reconsidered his stand that the job of clearing pavements of hawkers and other encroachers be left to the new board, to assume office after the June civic polls.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is now waiting for police help to launch an eviction drive, similar to Operation Sunshine ordered in 1996 by the previous Left Front board.

 ?We have alerted the action squad of the conservancy department. The squad has four pay-loaders, one bulldozer, 25 trucks and more than 100 workers,? chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar said on Tuesday. 

 Officials hope the drive will commence after the polls are notified.

 The high court has given the government three months to evict encroachers from the pavements of eight roads. The order is binding on the CMC, police and the government.

 As the civic polls are due next month, the mayor thought it best to pass the onus of executing the court order on to the successor board. However, the growing number of complaints from citizens and officials of his roads and conservancy departments forced him to change his mind.

 ?We are ready for the drive and are waiting for the confirmation of help from the city police headquarters,? said deputy director (conservancy) Swapan Mahapatra. 

 ?The drive will ultimately turn out to be a hide-and-seek between civic personnel and the encroachers if police are not effectively involved. They should be held responsible if the hawkers return to the pavements after the eviction heat dies down,? the mayor reasoned.

 ?The conservancy department is the main agency to conduct the operation, but it can?t proceed without police help,? stressed Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer-on-special duty to the mayor.

 Officials said the roads most hit by encroachments include Strand Road, Colootollah Street, Chittaranjan Avenue, Madan Street, APC Roy Road, and some roads around the civic headquarters, Park Circus, Gariahat and Ballygunge Phari.

 Mahapatra accused the encroachers of being involved in drug peddling, the flesh trade and theft of manhole covers, cars and iron fences.

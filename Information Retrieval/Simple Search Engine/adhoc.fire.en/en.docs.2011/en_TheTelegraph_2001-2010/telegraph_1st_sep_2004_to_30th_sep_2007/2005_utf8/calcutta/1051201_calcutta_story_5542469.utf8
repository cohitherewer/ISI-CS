 Space, comfort amp; luxury

 - Convention centre promises never-before medley

 The plush contemporaneity of JW Marriott?s Grande Lakes, Orlando, blended with the capacious luxury of Kremlin?s Red Hall. The Debenhams and Marks amp; Spencers to rock the retail racks, the Big Macs and TGIFs to tickle the taste buds, a clutch of star addresses plus a vibrant arts-and-culture canvas.

 The Rs 2,500-crore convention centre complex to be developed by the Unitech-Universal Success consortium in New Town, Rajarhat, will be a myriad medley of ?never-before elements?, promises Prasoon Mukherjee, chairman, Universal Success Enterprises Limited.

 The Jakarta-based NRI, responsible for bringing the Salim and Ciputra groups for the Kolkata West international township and Jurong Town Corporation for the International Logistic City, is developing the international convention centre on over 100 acres with Bengal Unitech Universal Infrastructure Ltd.

 The combine, with global hospitality major JW Marriott on board, bagged the deal in the face of stiff competition from, among others, DLF bidding with Hilton. ?Marriott is our operating partner and will implement the project, bringing to bear the group?s unmatched expertise in managing similar properties around the world?s biggest cities,? Mukherjee tells Metro.

 The design solution for the 40,000-sq-m convention centre and the allied infrastructure is being prepared by RMJM. The Hong Kong-based architecture firm is also designing the world?s biggest convention centre in Beijing for the Olympics. The city convention centre will be delivered in two years and the entire project in five years.

 ?I feel, the world?s most comfortable convention space is inside the Kremlin, where Communist leaders used to deliver their lengthy discourses. Our New Town property will exude a similar sense of spacious comfort. At the same time, it will be somewhat like the Suntech convention centre in Singapore, which is ringed by a clutch of classy hotels,? declares Mukherjee.

 JW Marriott, along with other partner/partners, will roll out four five-star hotels, accounting for around 1,000 rooms, besides a four-star rendezvous to come up as part of the 100-acre development. 

 There will also be service apartments, two office towers (one standard and one premium, to house MNCs), residential condominiums, golf club, a cultural plaza, and nearly a million sq ft of retail.

 ?Shopping is an integral wraparound of convention centres across the globe, and we will ensure the presence of premium brands on the retail footplate,? observes Mukherjee. Besides, there will be outlets of top F amp;B chains, including fast food and fine dining, and of course, cineplexes and other entertainment options befitting an international product of this scale, he adds.

 The NRI businessman ? with stake in hospitality, power, manufacturing, infrastructure and real estate and operations in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia ? is buoyed by the new energy in Bengal.

 ?If so many big players are coming to Bengal, there is a good reason for it. In fact, (Anthony) Salim categorically told me he was enthused to invest in a special economic zone in this state, not because of the availability of land, but for the ready pool 30,000 educated engineers,? Mukherjee stresses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

Small talk

As you dig into the sumptuous New Year spread this 

weekend, shukto won?t be the only bitter inclusion on your plate. Dada?s 

ban might leave a bad taste in the mouth during celebrations but we?ve got sweeter 

talk to let the feel-good factor into the proceedings as well. 

Sourav slam

Must Bengal look for some other hero to worship as 

Banglar Gourav, Amader Sourav falls from grace? That he has been tottering for 

quite some time and is now down for the count with the ICC ban ? and how the BCCI 

dumped him in less time than the skipper spends at the crease ? could fill up 

an entire evening. Back the Behala boy against Broad and Board or just say good 

riddance side and it?s about time. Do what you will, but do take a stand. For 

now, you?re either with Maharaj or against him!

Britney baby

The virgin beauty screaming Baby one more time 

is pregnant with her first baby by husband Kevin Federline, whom she married last 

September in a surprise, private ceremony. Britney haters can indulge in collective 

groaning over the prospect of a television reality series looming large that seeks 

to document the couple?s courtship, marriage and now presumably the pregnancy. 

Could have been more interesting if it featured her brief spur-of-the-moment marriage 

with a former high school sweetheart in Las Vegas, just eight months before she 

married her current husband. What say?

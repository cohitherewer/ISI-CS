 Lights out at surgery table

 KINSUK BASU

 The lights went out in NRS Medical College last Thursday. Four days later, it happened again, in the emergency wing. 

 The orthopaedic surgery department was plunged into darkness on Monday, when power went off in phases, casting a shadow over surgical procedures and routine activities.

 Around 10 am, when arrangements were being made for a surgery in the orthopaedic operating theatre of the UN Brahmachary Building, the power lines failed. 

 Darkness prevailed for over 15 minutes. After the lines were restored, they snapped again. 

 ?The surgery was all set to begin when the lights went off. Even though the power lines were restored after around 15 minutes, it went off again in the same building,? said Dilip Kumar Jha, deputy superintendent of NRS Medical College.

 ?We are trying our best to ensure that there is no repeat of such incidents,? he added.

 Around 9.30 am, the patient was on the OT table and the last-minute preparations were on. When power failure hit, the OT doors were opened. 

 The patient was wheeled out on a trolley and made to wait. Doctors called up superintendent Basanta Khan and informed him of the incident. The operation was delayed. The next bout of power failure lasted about 10 minutes. 

 All this on a day when council members of RG Kar Medical College came together for an emergency meeting to discuss ways to handle recurrent power failures in the hospital and coax the PWD for an alternative line.

 ?We have already informed the health department of our problem and things have not changed. The PWD?s electrical wing has sent us a letter asking for the number of air-conditioners that were on when power went off in RG Kar recently,? said Utpal Chowdhury, principal of RG Kar Medical College. 

 ?The tripping might be due to the heavy load, but we can?t do without them,? he added.

 ?We are exploring the option of a generator taking the load of RG Kar till alternative arrangements can be made. But things are still at the discussion stage,? said Ashish Chakrabarty, executive engineer of the north Calcutta wing of PWD (electrical).

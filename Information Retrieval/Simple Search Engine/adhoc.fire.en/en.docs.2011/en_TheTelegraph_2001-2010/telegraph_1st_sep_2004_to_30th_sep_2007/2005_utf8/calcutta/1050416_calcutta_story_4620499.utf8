 Breaking the tradition of organising Bollywood-style item numbers at its annual get-togethers, Calcutta Police Family Welfare Centre has decided to patronise classical music this year.

 A musical programme, titled Tiranga, will find stalwarts of Indian classical music in the limelight on Saturday evening at the Science City auditorium.

 ?We have invited heavyweights from the art and culture world, including Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia, poet Javed Akhtar, Vijay Ghate and M. Ramakrishnan, for the programme this year,? said commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee on Friday evening.

 Compositions based on ragas reflecting the spirit of each of the three colours in the Tricolour will be performed. Akhtar will recite five poems on each colour.

 ?In previous years, the event featured the typical Bollywood song and dance packages. I felt that a classical touch would be a soothing change,? he elaborated.

 Tiranga, the concept, was conceived by a group of eminent classical musicians and its first performance was inaugurated by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on January 31, 2003, in Delhi.

 Lapses set free jailed accused 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Lapses on the part of the prosecution helped a man, convicted and sentenced to 12 years? rigorous imprisonment by the trial court, to be freed from jail by dint of a high court order.

 A division bench of Justice Aloke Kumar Basu and Justice Pranab Kumar Deb on Wednesday acquitted Mohd Jamal of the charges framed against him by the police under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.

 ?Serious lapses on the part of the prosecution were found in this matter. The investigating authorities had failed to prove the charges framed against the petitioner (Jamal),? the judges observed.

 Jamal was arrested by Watgunge police on August 18, 1991, when he was walking out of Fancy Market, in Kidderpore, along with accomplice Mohammed Sabir. Police seized five kg of heroin from Jamal and started a case against him under the NDPS Act.

 Jamal?s trial was started in the special NDPS court at Alipore. He obtained bail and stayed out of jail. The trial took 10 years, and in 2001, the NDPS court held Jamal guilty. 

 The trial court sentenced Jamal to 12 years? rigorous imprisonment. Jamal was again taken into custody and sent to Alipore Central jail, where he is still imprisoned.

 Jamal moved an appeal in the high court, challenging the validity of the NDPS court judgment. The high court, after a prolonged hearing, held on Wednesday that the prosecution had failed to prove Jamal?s guilt and set him free. 

 Sekhar Bose and Souvik Mitter, counsels who appeared on behalf of Jamal in the high court, argued that the investigative authority had made extraordinary delay in sending the substance recovered from the petitioner for tests.

 ?This is gross violation of the law (NDPS Act). The law provides that the test should be carried out as early as possible,? Bose claimed.

 The lawyers defending the state did not oppose the plea of the petitioner?s lawyer. They rather admitted the charge. 

 The high court?s judgment is significant because both investigators and lawyers have opined that the law needs immediate amendment, as it does not serve its purpose.

Life

 Babul the busybee

 Playback for Hrithik Roshan in Krrish, a stint as a radio jockey, the response to his new album Kuch Aisa Lagta Hai ? Babul Supriyo has his hands full.

 Perhaps this is the best phase of my life as a singer. The songs I did the playback for have done well and then came this album that went on to become a dream project for me, said the singer who was at the 107.8 Power FM studio on Friday afternoon to promote his album.

 I have recorded the best eight songs possible. Normally, the tendency is to have a couple of good tracks that would be shot, and the rest are just put in to make up the numbers.

 Babul is acutely aware that the entire album is mine, and so if any of the songs is not up to the mark, his reputation could be tarnished.

 All eight songs are a good melange of all genres of music, assures the Kishore Kumar fan who has made it big in Bollywood.

 The boy from Bengal made it to limelight zone with one of the title versions of Kaho Na? Pyar Hai. Last year, he teamed up with Alka Yagnik for the title track of Hum Tum that fetched Yagnik the best female playback singer award for 2004. I really hurts to be overlooked for such a good performance, but then the anguish should not be evident in my actions. Maybe this would help me work harder on my songs, tunes off Babul.

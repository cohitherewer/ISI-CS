 Puja glory beyond rule rigour

 Today?s question: Will the new pandal rules rob Durga puja of its grandeur? More letters will be published next week

 Fun in numbers: Pandal-hoppers throng the streets

 Mahasweta Saha,

 Garia

 The new pandal rules will not curb the splendour of the Puja. We should keep in mind that the rules have been imposed for the safety and convenience of the public. It is the love of the people that makes a puja grand, and not the size of the pandal. Moreover, if need be, we should get accustomed to a less grand Puja. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

 The introduction of the new Puja rules is welcome. They will benefit all sections of the people, whether they visit pandals or not. The grandeur of the festival will not be hampered in the process.

 R.M. Paulmazumdar, 

 Shyamnagar

 The pandal rules are welcome to all. Everyone has had to face hardships due to the free-for-all that reigned during the Pujas. The grandeur of the occasion is unlikely to be curtailed by the regulations.

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park 

 Nothing of the Puja will be lost. On the contrary, trimming down the celebrations will benefit the revellers manifold. If the Puja committees had imposed restrictions on themselves or shown a modicum of civic sense, the new rules would not have been needed. The issue is not rules versus grandeur, but order versus pandemonium.

ajit kumar Das, 

 Naskar Para Road

 The new rules are only meant to ensure that there is no disruption in the movement of pedestrians and traffic. I do not think the injunctions would make the Puja less glamourous.

 Mehjibin Yunus,

 Bright Street

 Celebration during festivals should not inconvenience anybody. Towards that end, the new pandal rules are very important. Instead of affecting Puja grandeur, they would make the Puja days more enjoyable. 

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 Durga puja is beyond doubt the most important festival of Bengal. Rules and regulations will not diminish its charm. The rules will only lead to the welfare of the people and make the Puja safe.

 Naren Sen, 

 Santragachhi

 The grandeur associated with Puja will have to be curtailed to abide by the new pandal rules. However, the Bengalis will not enjoy Puja any less because of that. Enforcement of the new rules could prove to be very difficult.

 Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

 The community Pujas must not violate the new pandal rules. Having said that, stringent restrictions should not be imposed on Durga puja as that would take a toll on its charm.

 Sukanta Pachal,

 Howrah

 No rule or natural calamity can rob us of the joy Puja brings us. The new rules will allow people to enjoy the festival more. Puja organisers should be prevented from erecting gigantic pandals that block roads, disrupting traffic. They will have to think of other ways to attract people.

Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park 

 The new pandal rules are welcome. They will put an end to restrictions on traffic and pedestrian movements. The manner in which pandals block lanes that are barely 10-15 ft wide is a matter of concern. Have the Puja organisers ever pondered how many people would lose their lives if there is a stampede in such a lane?

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

 Worship of the goddess with devotion should be the only purpose of Puja. Grandeur has no part to play in it. Unfortunately, the organisers of community pujas are only interested in attracting people to their pandals and outdoing other Pujas. They should not be allowed to do as they please, especially by inconveniencing other people. The primary consideration should be the convenience of the public. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

 The new pandal rules will undoubtedly rob Durga puja of its grandeur. Which is why the authorities should be lenient in their implementation. The puja organisers should help the authorities by encroaching on only small parts of the carriageway.

 Abhijit Chakraborty,

 Baluhati, Howrah

 It?s best if the new pandal rules are implemented. Temporary grandeur cannot be the excuse to cause inconvenience to millions of people. Besides, the size of a pandal is not the only determinant of its grandeur.

 Paramita Mallick,

 Kalindi

 Devotion is the essence of Durga puja. But the community pujas are increasingly opting for larger pandals and idols to outdo each other. The new rules, especially those concerning tree-cutting, should be endorsed. Rules cannot affect the glory of the Puja.

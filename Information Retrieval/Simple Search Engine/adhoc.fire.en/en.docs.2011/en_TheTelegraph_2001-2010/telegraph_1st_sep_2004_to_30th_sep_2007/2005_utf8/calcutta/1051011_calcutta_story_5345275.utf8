The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Together in toil and in triumph

 When we come together, it?s a beginning; when we work together, it?s progress; and when we win together, it?s success ? the spirit of Our Lady Queen of the Missions, Salt Lake, reflected in its inter-school fest ChiarosQuro, organised in association with TTIS, on October 5, 6 and 7.

 The first day of the fiesta, at the host school, had an array of off-stage events like Q?Muse, Q?Trendz, Q?Essence, Q?Tech and Q?Rattle. But more excitement was in store on Day Two at Kala Mandir. Q?Expresso, the debate competition, and musical item Q?Sync enthralled the audiences the most .

 In Q?Acto, Salt Lake School?s eight-minute skit on Mangal Pandey and Indra looking for a financier to open a discotheque in heaven was hilarious. It was a tough fight in Q? Maestro, the competition of the school bands, with Calcutta Boys? putting up a great show.

 The most awaited and the last event on October 7 was Q?Vogue, the fashion hunt. The chief guest for the evening was designer Sarbari Dutta and Annie Lakra, a model and an ex-student of the host school. Loyola School recreated the feel of the 60s and 70s, while the girls from Mahadevi Birla dressed up as warriors. Don Bosco, Liluah, were classy in denims, while Bhawanipur College slipped into Bollywood costumes, from the Raj Kapoor era to Salaam Namaste.

 Career call

 The focus of Kaizen 2005, held at the Golapbag campus of the University of Burdwan between October 4 and 6, was on setting and achieving goals.Encompassing an IT fair, a career fair and a national seminar on ?Technology and Business: Quest for Excellence?, the event presented by The Telegraph was attended by professionals, industry bigshots and leading academicians from renowned organisations and educational institutions across the country. 

 The career fair of Kaizen was a first-of-its-kind in this part of the state. The basic objective of the fair was to introduce the local students to the current trends and requirements of the job market and courses offered by the various institutes and universities in India and abroad.

 More than 10,000 ambitious undergraduate and postgraduate students of Burdwan and neighbouring districts participated in the career fair. Besides getting an opportunity to interact with executives from renowned IT and non-IT companies, the presentations made by institutes like the United States Educational Foundation in India, British Council and Goethe Institut-Max Mueller Bhavan were also of tremendous help.

 Students in Burdwan miss out on most of the big career fairs that are held in Calcutta. We only hope that the career fair at Kaizen becomes an annual affair.

 Singer and the song

 The interact club of M.P. Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School presented its annual fest Matrix ?05 recently.

 Starting on October 8, Matrix ?05 was a platform where students of various city schools showcased their talents in events like quizzes, fashion shows and cultural programmes.

 Indian Idol Abhijeet Sawant performed live at Matrix ?05 at GD Birla Sabhagar on October 9 and regaled the audience with hit numbers like Mohabbatein Lutaunga and Lafzon Mein.

 The evening was even more memorable as some of the students and guests got a chance to sing along with Abhijeet.

 All the fame has not gone to the head of the young star and he came across as a very down-to-earth person during a tete-a-tete later. 

 Abhijeet?s musical stint on stage started way back during his school and college days.

 Given a chance, the graduate of Chetna College, Mumbai, plans to try and bring into the limelight other young talents like him. And one in every home in Calcutta, he said, had a musician who deserved a little more fame.

 But what draws him most to the City of Joy are rosogollas and mishti doi.

The doll house

 She sat in front of the mirror. The single crack that trickled down the shining glass might have been a tear drop dried, a silvery illusion.

 Might have been midnight hours kept by passing moons in dark, breathless streets. Might have been the way her gaze held his trail of dust and ashes.

 Doll houses don?t last, her mother would tell her, back in her frock-wearing, candy-licking days. Those days, she believed in growing up.

 But round the corner, even the conch shells and primeval drum rhythms that hailed the divine mother would fall silent as the Dashami sunset pours its vermillion over the festivity-worn city.

 And her! She hadn?t even felt Eternity ripple down the manicured brown of her fingertips. 

 Not Durga, not Mahamaya... after all, what was she but just another squalid doll?

 A missive to Ma

 Before you fly in here,

 There is something that you must hear. 

 It seems, these days, your devotees are few, For this is what ?geNext? thinks of you.

 It was a heated conversation round-the-table, There was no bound to the endless babble

 Suddenly someone dragged you down. Now that, made a few frown.

 A clever one said, ?I don?t know about the rest. I remember Her only before the test!?

 A future scientist commented, ?We can?t see Her. So, she just can?t be there. She is just clay, hay and cane, 

 Sans make-up, She would be a Plain Jane!

 A philosopher gave a sigh and a sniff,

 ?With Her, I had a little tiff 

 I pray to her often to keep the city safe, 

 She pays no heed, She must be quite deaf!?

 What else can I say, 

 It was a damned day. 

 This time you are already here, 

 So, I can?t ask you to leave.

 But think it over next year, before stepping into the mandaps you preside,

 And do let me know what you decide.

 For they measure your virtues and vice,

 Next year, Ma, do think twice!!

 P.S. One thing I forgot to say,

 Before your picture, I pray every day!!

 South Point High School

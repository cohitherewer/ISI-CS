 It?s only words...

 Of dust and pills

 What is it? 

 With my fantasies 

 In eyes shut light 

 A romance 

 With ghosts and flights 

 And wind storms 

 Billowing dust and rain drops 

 With reds and greens 

 And torn paper packets 

 Little green paper sachets 

 Hiding clean white pills 

 Tall, bitter round 

 Stored in straw casks 

 Swallowed and lost 

 Down deep tunnels 

 Flushed 

 Forever fading and waning 

 Reducing 

 Into thin rivulets 

 Causing, effecting 

 Rights and wrongs

 Shame

 I feel for you

 That you have all these problems

 I feel for you

 That you have all these faults

 I feel for you

 That you are only human

 That you put up all these walls

 It?s time...

 You admit the pain you?ve drudged on others

 Blaming, hating, excusing and hurting

 The one, that loved you most

 I tried to change

 Even attempted to take my own life

 I thought it would make yours better

 How hard I really tried

 But only after years of abuse...

 Did, I realise

 Nothing I do...

 Would ever make me right

 Not as long as this sickness 

 controls you

 From the inside

 And it is for this very reason

 I can no longer allow you to screw 

 with my mind

 Still, every once in a while

 It seeps inside my head

 Every nasty little thing...

 You?ve done or said

 I never really had your love

 No need in trying to replace it

 These are your own mistakes

 You need to learn to face them

 I love you, mom, and always have

 Though it seems you were not alone

 In this destruction of me

 Nearly driving me mad...

 And, then, forcing me out on my own

 But you know...

 In the finality of things

 I?m just a diamond in the rough

 Yes!

 I was born out of circumstance

 But through it all

 Made, both...

 Resilient

 and

 Tough!

 Trina Dasgupta

 The end of many a regret

 Reasons are many, options are few. 

 I scream, I shout, I cry, 

 But can anything justify 

 How I feel about you? 

 Of course not, nothing can. 

 Life?s empty as it is, 

 Devoid of the colours. 

 It keeps coming back every time. 

 A new day, old faces, revised fury. 

 The length though often varies. 

 The spectator does not care much, 

 But the music goes on, loud. 

 The violent drums beaten. 

 The untuned guitars strummed. 

 I try to strum along but 

 Am astray, 

 Am away from the track. 

 She strikes the familiar chords 

 of life. 

 My soul played them some time, 

 Now, all is silent, 

 My eyes still and lifeless ?

 As the elegy was read 

 At the funeral instead 

 The drums rolled again 

 While the sirens deafened every ear 

 The blinding thunder 

 Poured rain against summertime? 

 Soaking, mixing tear with rain?

 Ode to Simon amp; Garfunkel 

 Prophets of the night 

 Tap the broken light 

 and tap the tune soon 

 before the poet 

 leaves the room 

 and a cry or a song 

 and the long walk home 

 ?n? the last talk 

 On the phone 

 Ghosts in their pain 

 flicker down the lane 

 the guitar that fell

 in the circle 

 of shadows 

 Still sows 

 A blue feather 

 In the far meadows 

 A haze on the window 

 ?n? a blaze kills the land 

 and my hand taps the rock twice 

 and the ice hits a lock 

 On her faded door? 

 but the four-letter poem 

 falls among the dead leaves 

 I sung a dark prayer 

 On the gray stairs 

 beyond 

 the deaths in the park 

 where I 

 shut my eye 

 from the zombie 

 of a friend 

 ?tell me, 

 would you lend 

 a wilderness 

 of my voice only?? 

 ?Sleep 

 till it rains? 

 Weep as a pin drops in silence.

 Tagore Tributes Around the world, His Medal stolen and Home in a shambles here

 Bengal?s bard

 Days after his death anniversary, SUNDEEP BHUTORIA remembers the tributes paid to Rabindranath Tagore in other countries.

 When I received an invitation to chair a Young Scholar Seminar organised at the University of Economics in Prague, Czechoslovakia, last year, I was aware that my first visit to the historic land would be exciting. But despite that, I returned with sorrow in my heart.

 While talking to the Indian chancellor Ramesh Chander, I asked if there was any place of special significance for Indians. I was taken aback by the reply that Rabindranath Tagore was a respected figure there, and that his bust had been put up in the city . The next day, I went to visit the spot on Thakur Riwa (the word means street in the local language). The bust was placed atop a pillar. I stood speechless, my heart swelling with pride. 

 Another pleasant surprise awaited me at the Indian mission in Hungary, one of the stops on my eastern European tour, where I visited the ambassador Manbir Singh. On a wall was a wooden frame, which, on closer inspection, I realised was a menu card for a dinner party hosted years ago. I was amazed at the history of the memento. After Tagore received his Nobel Prize in 1928, he visited Budapest. The mayor had hosted a grand dinner party in his honour. The menu contained details of the meal, starting with cold soup to the hot coffee after dessert. It even mentioned the fact that the feast was organised to honour Rabindranath Tagore.

 I also learnt of a cardiac hospital in Balantonfured, a village about 100 km away from Budapest, where Tagore had been treated during his visit in 1928. Singh told me that a statue of Bengal?s bard had been placed in the hospital in his memory. When I went to the village, I notice that the park was named after him, too, as was the room where he stayed, called Tagore Suite, which is reserved for VIPs. When I spoke to the director of the hospital Dr Gabor Veress over phone the next day, he asked me what the nearest airport to Santiniketan was, and which museum held the Nobel Prize medal.

 I was caught off guard. What could I tell him, that the prize that had made him famous, had been stolen? The bitter truth is that my knowledge of Gurudev has been gleaned from my various foreign visits. Even the birthplace of poet Pablo Neruda, in Santiago, Chile, has a park named after Tagore. In China, a conversation over tea between a famous Chinese poet and Tagore has been recreated in sculptures in Shanghai. But here, in the land of his brith, we couldn?t even protect his Nobel medal.

 Chit Chat

 College kudos

 The year-long golden jubilee celebration of Gurudas College is set to kick off in style on August 14, the foundation day. A small programme to commemorate the day will be followed on August 18 by a formal inauguration by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and a cultural extravaganza.

 Satyasadhan Chakrabarti, the higher education minister, and Asish Kumar Bandyopadhyay, vice-chancellor, Calcutta University, are among the other dignitaries to be present on the occasion. Also on the agenda is an alumni meet and exhibition ? 1905: Phire Dekha.

 A golden jubilee lecture series has already been started by Prof Amlan Datta. Plans are afoot to get Prof Romila Thapar to deliver the next lecture. In November, the annual cultural programme of the college, Harmonica, will be organised, paving the way for the golden jubilee sports meet in January.

 Started in 1956 as a joint initiative of the state and Central governments for the education of youth displaced by the Partition, Gurudas College has progressed from strength to strength. 

 It now offers self-financed courses in computer science, microbiology and biochemistry in addition to honours degrees in 13 subjects from its campuses in Narkeldanga. Permission to offer B.Com degrees has been granted by Calcutta University this year. Courses in mass communication and journalism are being contemplated.

 Further expansion is on the anvil, in the form of a golden jubilee complex, to house the library and an auditorium, on an acre of vacant land owned by the college. Funds are the only stumbling block. But assurances of aid have been forthcoming.

 The professors of the college expressed hope that in the not too distant future, the college would not only offer postgraduate courses and research facilities, but turn into an educational and resource hub for several schools in the area. A community education project can also be started, they felt.

 Career call

 ?Those who can, do. Those who can?t, consult?, this is a common misconception among many people about the profession of consulting. It?s a job that stimulates your intellect, deals with people and impacts the way an organisation does business. Many B-school students aspire to join top global consulting firms when they graduate. 

 The main reasons are excellent pay packets, foreign postings and luxurious lifestyles. But knowledge of the job and clarity about long-term goals can help make a better decision. These were some of the views expressed in a talk on ?Careers in Consulting? at IIM-C on August 10. The speakers were IIM-C alumni from Boston Consulting Group. 

 The guests gave an insight into the career path and nature of assignments of a consultant. Vikram Bhalla, a 1996 batch IIM Calcutta alumnus and now partner in BCG, emphasised the importance of being sure of what one wants to do in life before taking the plunge. He looked back at his experience as a student conceding that he feels he had chosen the right career but for the wrong reasons, due to lack of information. ?Take the career decision over a longer term, rather than in just three months before placements,? said Bhalla. 

 He asserted that consulting can provide one with an accelerated career path and exposure to a broad spectrum of management problems. Saurabh Tripathi discussed the kind of assignments a consultant works on using real industrial examples, while Shaleen Sinha reiterated how a consultant gets opportunities to work in projects with motley client teams and gain experience in various businesses. 

 The talk was an eye-opener for many students, while the guests were happy to return to their alma mater. The final advice was summed up by Vikram Bhalla as he quoted Steve Jobs: ?You?ve got to find what you love?Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.?

 Fitness freaks now have a new address to sweat it out, provided one boasts a membership of Saturday Club. The popular clubbing destination on Wood Street has recently launched a state-of-the-art gymnasium equipped with machines imported from California.

 We have fitted equipment from a California-based company called Precor, which is one of the best in the world, reveals Rajen Sood, sports convenor of the club. 

 Apart from the usual facilities like treadmills, ab-machines, cross trainers and cycles, the gym has a separate area for free-hand exercises and yoga as well.

 Trained personnel have been employed to guide members through their workout schedules.

 Though the club has had a gymnasium for the past 15 years, of late it was not being able to accommodate the members. It was all of 750 sq-feet, says Sood.

 With increasing awareness about fitness among our members, we were forced to start this new gymnasium spread over 3,000 sq ft. Members have made a beeline for enrolling ever since we opened last Friday, he smiles.

Haute weaves

 Dealing with handloom weaves of Bengal since the mid-70s, Meera is a brand name in taant saris and dhotis. The label launched its second outlet in the city at Swabhumi on Sunday.

 Tollywood actress Swastika Mukherjee and stage personality Deepa Das Munshi inaugurated the store.

 From a humble sari business started by Meera Basu in the mid-70s to a name to reckon with in the fashion fraternity, Meera has come a long way, explains Chinmoy Basu, one of the owners of the label.

 Meeras forte is its array of innovative weaves that have found a place in the works of design dons like Rohit Bal, Abu Jani and Tarun Tahiliani.

 We strive to motivate rural weavers by providing them social visibility and economic independence, says Basu.

 Racks at the new store house a versatile collection of saris ? Dhakai, Dhonekhali, Tangail, tussar, kora and muslin silks ? in Meeras signature designs. The colour scheme ranges from pastels to splashes of vibrant vegetable dye. Also on offer are kurtis, salwars suits, dress materials and an exclusive collection of long chikan-work kurtas for men. These can be teamed with stoles in myriad hues.

 The saris start as low as Rs 180 and go up to a few thousand.

Herbal high

 From handloom hautes to herbal health options ? the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan has ventured into new territory with a range of fitness teas. The new line was launched at the Chittaranjan Avenue outlet on Tuesday.

 The teas have several medicinal and curative values and hence are aimed at health-conscious, diabetic, and fitness-oriented people, says S. S. Sil, state director of Khadi and Village Industries Corporation.

 The range boasts herbal teas meant to combat diseases like diabetes, gastric trouble, kidney stone, high blood pressure and other problems of the heart, skin, liver and digestive system. The other varieties on offer are Slimming Herbal Tea, Memory Plus Herbal Tea and Tulsi Herbal Tea.

 The Madhunasini Herbal Tea (made from gurmar, dronopushpi, gamun, tulsi, gulancha, chirataya) that is effective in controlling diabetes and heart weakness, improving blood circulation, digestion and immunity is expected to be a hit with Calcuttans. And so is the Slimming Herbal Tea (a blend of arjuna, puskarmul, biavidinga, dalchini and pipul) that helps in excess fat reduction and control of triglyceride.

 These products are extremely effective in controlling modern lifestyle diseases. We are trying to make them available at all our centres and associate centres, shopping malls and departmental stores, adds Sil.

 The products are priced between Rs 80 and Rs 120 for each 100 gm pack.

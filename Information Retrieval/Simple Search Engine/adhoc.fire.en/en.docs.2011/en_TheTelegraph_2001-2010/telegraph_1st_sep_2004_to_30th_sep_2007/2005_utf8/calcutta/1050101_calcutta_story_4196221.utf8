 In step with future perfect

 Promoting awareness of child rights and ensuring the overall development of underprivileged children are the principal areas of city-based NGO Prayasam?s activities. Ahlladi, its dance-theatre group, has been formed to enable underprivileged children with a talent for the performing arts to groom, nurture and refine their skills, thereby helping them to find a foothold in life. Performed by a group of pre-teen and teenaged girls and boys, Ahlladi showcases its dance repertoire at a concert hosted by the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre. Starting with a 10-minute visual presentation on Ahlladi?s activities in 2004, the programme features three recitals: Intezaar, portraying the ceaseless wait of women labourers for an end to their drudgery; Matri Rupeno Sangsthita, an invocation to the Goddess as Mother; and Bhoomisuta, a contemporary fusion dance composition on child rights.

 Event: Dance recital by Ahlladi, the dance-theatre group of Prayasam

 When: Tomorrow at 6 pm

 Where: Purbashree auditorium, Salt Lake, IB-201 Salt Lake

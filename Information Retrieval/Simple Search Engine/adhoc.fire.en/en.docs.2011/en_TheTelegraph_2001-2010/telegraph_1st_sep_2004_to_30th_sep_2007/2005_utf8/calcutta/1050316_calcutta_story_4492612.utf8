 Pollution board has Howrah address

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 The West Bengal Pollution Control Board is set to shift its Howrah regional office to the district from Calcutta.

 The regional office is presently at Bhabani Bhavan, on Belvedere Road.

 ?The Howrah office will be shifted to the district within a month,? announced Shyamal Kumar Sarkar, member-secretary of the board. A senior board official said: ?The location of the office is a real problem for us as well as the people of Howrah.?

 The member-secretary concurred: ?Ideally, a regional office of any department should be located in the region itself.?

 Stating that Howrah is a ?critically-polluted? district, Sarkar added that better monitoring of its pollution level became very important after the Supreme Court, a few years ago, held that Calcutta was one of the 16 highly-polluted cities in the country.

 ?The shift of office will be a boon for the people of Howrah. They can easily visit the office and benefit from the services we provide,? member-secretary Sarkar asserted.

 ?It is very difficult to monitor the pollution level in a district and take necessary steps to reduce it from an office situated outside the area,? he added.

 The board hopes to boost the implementation of pollution control norms and provide fast and efficient service from its new office.

 ?Our environmental awareness programme in the district will also receive a fillip since we will be able to work in close proximity with various other government departments, including the district administration and police,? Sarkar explained.

 The processing and dispatch of no-objection certificates (NOC) and ?consent to operate certificate? (COC) is also likely to be speeded up. 

 Entrepreneurs wanting to set up an industry in the state first have to obtain an NOC from the board and then apply for a COC. The business can only be started after the COC is received. 

 The board issues the certificates on the basis of the ratings received by the industries. There are three board ratings: red, orange and green. The industries that have high pollution potential get red ratings and have to renew their COC every one or two years. The orange and green ratings require renewal every three and five years, respectively.

 The board receives several applications for NOCs and COCs every month.

 ?The applications pile up if they are not processed quickly. A backlog of applications becomes a stumbling block on the way of smooth operations. A new office in Howrah is significant in that respect,? said a senior board official.

 ?On an average, the Howrah regional office receives 50 applications for NOCs every month. In 2003-2004, we conducted inspections at 71 industries in the district,? Sarkar added.

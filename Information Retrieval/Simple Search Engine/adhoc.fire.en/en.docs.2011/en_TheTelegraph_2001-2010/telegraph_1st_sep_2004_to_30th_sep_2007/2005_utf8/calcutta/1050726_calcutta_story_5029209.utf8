 Subject freeze to fight student stress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta Police wanted schools to include road safety as a compulsory subject in the Madhyamik course

 In an attempt to check escalation of academic pressure on schoolchildren, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has decided to stop considering proposals to include new subjects in the Madhyamik course.

 Of late, several organisations, in a bid to create awareness of social problems among children, had approached the board with requests to introduce new compulsory subjects.

 For instance, the city police requested the board to introduce traffic rules as a subject. The police brass feels that this will help youngsters to develop an awareness of traffic laws, ultimately leading to a reduction in the number of road accidents.

 Similarly, following the Kumbakonam fire tragedy in Tamil Nadu, there was an appeal from the state fire services department to start a course on fire safety.

 Proposals to make disaster management, trekking and even karate a part of Madhyamik are pending with the board.

 ?There are an adequate number of compulsory subjects in the Madhyamik course. We cannot put additional load on the students,? stated Dibyendu Hota, president of the Madhyamik board. No new subject is going to be introduced in the course in the near future, he asserted.

 According to Hota, with examination-related suicides on the rise, the board is desperately trying to figure out ways to cut down on the stress on students. ?We cannot make the examinations more stressful in this situation.? 

 Students of Madhyamik are required to study seven compulsory subjects ? first language, second language, mathematics, physical science, life science, history and geography. 

 Acting on a Supreme Court directive, the board has introduced environmental science as a compulsory subject from the current academic session.

 Lifestyle education is also being considered for debut in the course by the board. The subject might be taught as a co-curricular activity. The aim is to create awareness among students about AIDS and educate boys and girls about basic health and hygiene.

 Swapan Bhattacharya, board secretary, said: ?Considering the increase in pressure on the students, lifestyle education will be taught as a co-curricular activity.? 

 The 13-member school education committee, headed by Ranjugopal Mukherjee and set up by the state government, had, however, recommended that the subject be made compulsory.

 According to Bhattacharya, apart from lifestyle education, the schools affiliated to the board will be allowed to offer courses on traffic rules and fire safety as co-curricular activities. ?The schools may teach these subjects if they have the required infrastructure and teaching staff. There will be no compulsion,? signed off Bhattacharya.

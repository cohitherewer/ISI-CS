 Pia Trevedi: Debut damsel

 Telly champs 

 After talent hunts and reality shows, it?s time for the next level, or as Channel [V] puts it: ?No rules. No scripts. No star cast. No celebrity jury.? Pepsi [V] TV Champions is all set to find the faces with the spirit to invade the small screen, use their creativity and grab viewer attention. With millions of viewers as jury, this first-of-its-kind show will hit the tube on Wednesday, at 10 am, with repeat telecasts the same day at 1 pm and 5 pm.

 The criterion for being on the show is simple: ?A desire to be on TV, soaring energy levels and a creative mind that can create the craziest, the wackiest and the most innovative ideas for television.? As Amar K. Deb, the channel?s head honcho, puts it: ?Today?s youth want to do their own thing and express themselves the way they want to. So, [V] is giving them one minute on air to show us what they are made of.?

 From the thousands of entries received from across the country, 14 finalists will eventually get their shot at fame. These 14 finalists will get 60 seconds each week to show their mettle. To be on air for eight weeks, the show will be hosted by model-turned-veejay, Pia Trevedi, who will make her small screen debut.

 Don?t frown if you didn?t get a call back from the KBC people despite keying in the right answers. Now, you can jump directly into the show and test your tryst with destiny. Airtel in partnership with STAR India brings to its customers an exclusive opportunity to directly reach the Fastest Finger First round. 

 Called the Fast Lane to KBC2, till the midnight of July 7, Airtel customers can call 646 from their mobiles and say ?KBC? or SMS ?KBC? to 646. Customers will be asked to answer a set of questions, each of which will have four possible options as the correct answer. On choosing the right answer, one will accumulate five points. Twelve highest scorers from this will qualify for the Fastest Finger First round.

 It?s also a first-of-its-kind for any version of the Celedor show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. ?Such a unique entry mechanism has not been experimented with, anywhere in the world,? said Deepak Segal, executive vice president, content, STAR India.

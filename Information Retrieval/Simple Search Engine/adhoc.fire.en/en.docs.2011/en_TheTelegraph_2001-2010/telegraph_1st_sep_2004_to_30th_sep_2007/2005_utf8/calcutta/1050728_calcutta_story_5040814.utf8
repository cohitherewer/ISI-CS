 Power struggle in society

 Human instincts have remained unchanged throughout the history of civilisation, from primeval times to the present day. Ruled by individual desires, aspirations, greed and lust for power, man continues to struggle relentlessly, guided by the archetypal philosophy of life ? survival of the fittest. Documenting the evolution and changes in social power structure down the ages, Samayer Abarte also traces the origin of class divisions in society. Initially a collective community whose decisions were based on common benefit, it gradually came to be distinguished into different classes to feed the ambitions of a group of power-hungry people. As one group emerged stronger than the other, there arose conflicts between the strong and the weak, ultimately manifesting itself in a divisive, class-ridden society. Depicting this eternal, inevitable conflict, and trying to assess its impact on the fate of mankind, the play also indicates a solution to serve the larger interest of society. Direction: Malay Biswas.

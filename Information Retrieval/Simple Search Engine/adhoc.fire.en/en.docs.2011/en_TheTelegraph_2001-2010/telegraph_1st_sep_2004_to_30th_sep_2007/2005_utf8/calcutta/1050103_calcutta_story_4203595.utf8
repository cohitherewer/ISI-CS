 Oft-trodden path was getaway route

A reconstruction of the theft of the rare Buddha head, dating back to Fifth Century AD, has prompted city sleuths to take a closer look at Indian Museum?s most-frequented passage on the ground floor, that was probably used to smuggle out the artefact.

 According to sleuths, the thieves on December 29 could have used the passage that runs through the Coin Gallery, the Gandharva Gallery, right up to the exit door beside the lift.

 The swipe was reconstructed over the past 48 hours, following an alert sounded by the CBI to Interpol, triggering an international watch-out for the artefact.

 ?Interpol has been informed about the theft and we are expecting leads to emerge. Let?s wait for a few more days,? CBI director U.S. Mishra said on Sunday.

 City police, while focusing on the path used to whisk away the Buddha head, appear clueless about how the thieves managed to slip out undetected.

 The passage that was possibly used to get away is one of the busiest in the museum. Seven curators sit on either side of the passage, just beyond the Gandharva gallery, with the security officer at the other end.

 ?For most staff members on the ground floor, it remains the most popular pathway and yet, the thieves managed to walk away,? said an officer of the probe team.

 City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said precious little: ?It is pointless speaking about the progress unless there is a breakthrough.?

 Union minister for culture Jaipal Reddy was more forthcoming during the day. ?This is not a mere theft and we cannot remain indifferent to the disappearance of the Buddha head from Indian Museum. But, as I gather, the state government has taken up the matter very seriously and the investigation is in an advanced stage,? Reddy told Metro.

 Earlier on Sunday, Reddy had a talk with museum director Shakti Kali Basu. The minister inquired about the theft and the security aspects of the country?s oldest museum and expressed concern over lapses and loopholes.

 While looking into the staff deployment pattern and scanning those on duty on the day of the theft, sleuths have also started scanning the operations of leading curio and artefact dealers in and around Calcutta. They are working in collaboration with the CID.

 ?We have handed over an entire list of the gangs and others engaged in this trade from our database to the investigators to facilitate their probe,? said R.K. Mohanty, additional director-general (CID).

 A high-power team from the department of culture, led by the secretary, is scheduled to visit the museum to take stock of the situation next week.

 The security system of the museum will be reviewed thoroughly when the committee on internal security meets a few weeks later.

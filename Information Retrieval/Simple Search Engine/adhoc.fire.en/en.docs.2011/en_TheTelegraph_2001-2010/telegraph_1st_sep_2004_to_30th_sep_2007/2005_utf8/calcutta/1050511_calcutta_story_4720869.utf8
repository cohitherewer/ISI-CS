Bed amp; bath beauties

Spring-summer designs in co-ordinated home 

linen are decking up city homes, says Himika Chaudhuri

Have you gifted yourself a couple of latest designs 

this spring-summer? If the answer is yes, and you pride yourself on being in sync 

with the style seasons, its time to think beyond your wardrobe. The collection 

culture, which brings change with the weather every few months, applies to bed 

and bath linen as well.

While Calcutta got its first high-end standalone store 

dealing in bed and bath accessories last week, demand for co-ordinated linens 

is on the rise, feel city shop owners.

Linen luxury

There was nothing fashionable about bed linen 

and bath accessories in India till about a few years ago. People didnt even 

pay much attention to colour co-ordinating these. But now with young couples looking 

for a chic lifestyle, the demand in this area is growing fast, says Anshuman 

Singh, CEO, Welspun, the group that owns the new 2,000-sq-feet outlet at City 

Centre called Spaces. 

The store is fashioned in the style of a home, with 

rooms decked with the latest bed linen and upholstery. Welspuns spring-summer 

2005 collection boasts four distinct lines called Fusion, Retro, Floral and Tradition. 

All four have co-ordinated bed and bath linen, including bedspread, pillow covers, 

quilt, curtains, cushion covers and even towels and bath robes. Priced between 

Rs 485 for a single bed and pillow cover and Rs 1,700 for a double-bed set, these 

pure cotton pieces come in a variety of designs and colours. The brand intends 

to introduce 20 new styles every month over the next year. 

Apart from Spaces, the collection is also available 

at the Tommy Hilfiger store off Elgin Road.

If Spaces upped its shutters a week ago, Fabindia 

has been promoting the cause of stylish, co-ordinated bed linen for a few years 

now. The demand for chic bed linen is definitely on the rise owing to growing 

spending powers and the desire to be house-proud, feels Pallavi Basu of 

Fabindia. 

The range of handloom and handcrafted linen is priced 

between Rs 280 and Rs 3,000 at the south Calcutta store and the colours in demand 

are white and shades of red. 

Our sets include cushions, durries, curtains, 

bed linen and even lamp shades. With our wide range we can co-ordinate any number 

of sets for our buyers, adds Pallavi. 

In keeping with the growing demand for fancy bed linen, 

the store is also hosting a Summer Cool exhibition with a new range of items for 

the season. 

Exclusive line

Not just the stores, many of Calcuttas designers 

are also dabbling with co-ordinated home linen. Designer Anshu Modi has a range 

of bedroom sets comprising bedcovers, pillow covers, rugs, cushion covers and 

throws. These heavily-embroidered raw silk items in vibrant hues lend a luxurious 

touch to the interiors.

Another designer who has been promoting hand-embroidered 

home linen is kantha enthusiast Shamlu Dudeja. In her own home, the curtains 

in her room are matched with the kantha-stitched bedcover and tablecloth. 

While Dudejas kantha creations start 

at Rs 10,000, Modis line is priced between Rs 2,500 and Rs 30,000.

Says Ravjit Singh Soin, VP sales of Feather Sound, 

a year-old brand selling premium bed linen sets: We are doing very well 

in Calcutta. Till recently people were not conscious about fashion in linen but 

now they look out for latest designs and stylish stuff. 

Priced between Rs 4,900 and Rs 7,200, these sets in 

silk and cotton are available with select stores including Nik Nish, Stellar, 

Aawraun and Troussurea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Free lunches and sleeping dogs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The two-day seminar on the city?s architectural heritage and urban regeneration, that began on Thursday under the auspices of the Calcutta Tercentenary Trust and the British Council, underlined many of the problems that beset the heritage movement that is taking ages to gather momentum. 

 To begin with, while NGOs that have been fighting for the cause have succeeded in saving individual buildings that are of either historical or architectural value, they have done little to preserve neighbourhoods with a distinct flavour and look of their own.

 So, for every individual Queens Mansion or Bishop?s Palace saved, others that added to the character of a para are going down like nine pins. The NGOs slept while the flyover that destroyed Chowringhee forever was foisted on it. And now, the Maidan may go the same way, if they are not alert. 

 As Shyam Chainani, secretary, Bombay Environmental Action Group, said: ?Legislation is the cheapest and most effective method of heritage protection?, and whereas heritage regulations have been in force in Mumbai since February 20, 1991, here we are still pussyfooting over the heritage list. In spite of INTACH contributing its own.

 Barun De, historian and member of the West Bengal Heritage Commission as well as of the heritage committee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), voiced similar concerns. While the movement began with much gusto, it has flagged for the past four to five years. Of the state government?s commission, he commented: ?Beyond free lunches, it has done little.? He stressed that Calcutta should be seen as part of Howrah and Baruipur in its ?periurban, semi-rural context? and ?not kept as an antiquity?.

 Because of the confusion that prevails in Calcutta?s nascent heritage movement, even basic issues, such as whether or not the Maidan falls under the CMC?s jurisdiction, are not clear. This allowed CMC commissioner Debashis Som to get away with disowning the Maidan, which he claimed belonged exclusively to the army. The NGOs were in the dark on the issue.

 Shyam Chainani said if in Mumbai the defence establishment can be pulled up for violating heritage laws, only these gaps in information allowed the army to behave as it does in Calcutta.

 Giles Quarme, chairman, Ancient Monuments Society and member of other heritage bodies in the UK, spoke of his extensive experience in urban regeneration. He said in the UK, all heritage bodies put up a united front. Since cars are a major problem in Calcutta, a beginning could be made by cutting down on horns. For, ultimately, architecture is to do with environment.

 Sadly, this is not a lesson that architects in Calcutta seem to have learnt. Dulal Mukherjee, who has bagged some major Calcutta projects such as restoring Metropolitan Building, Queens Mansion, and now the MacKinnon Mackenzie building in Dalhousie, himself said he wanted to build a shopping mall behind the restored Town Hall, which was spiked after an uproar. 

 Now, he wants a mall and parking lot in Curzon Park. If it is allowed to be constructed, pedestrians will have to wear gas masks in Esplanade.

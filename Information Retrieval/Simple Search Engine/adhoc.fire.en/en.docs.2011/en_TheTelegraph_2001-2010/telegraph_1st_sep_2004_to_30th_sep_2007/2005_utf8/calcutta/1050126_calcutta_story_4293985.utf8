 Taking a cue from the chief minister?s appeal for policing with a humane face, the police top brass has asked officers-in-charge to ensure that constables remain at their posts while on duty and attend to complaints.

 At a recent crime conference of the South division, senior officers, including additional commissioner (III) Gautam Mohan Chakrabarty, made it clear that they would not tolerate any indiscipline in the force.

 Officers-in-charge of all police stations have been asked to visit regularly the outposts under their control and check whether the constables are discharging their duty or whiling away time outside.

 The authorities want to step up the monitoring, especially around midnight.

 ?The idea is to make the police visible to the common man round-the-clock. We want the public to feel assured that there is someone round the corner to turn to in an emergency,? said an officer, who was present at the crime meeting.

 This was the first time in recent years that senior officers, other than the divisional deputy commissioner, addressed the officers-in-charge on ways to curb crime and handle pending cases.

 The move on monitoring comes in the wake of stray reports reaching police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee about constables bunking duty or staying away from the outposts they are supposed to man. 

 ?The message is loud and clear ? at no cost should an outpost be left unmanned,? said an officer of Lake police station. ?If cops on duty fail to extend help to the public, the purpose behind community policing gets defeated,? he explained.

 The authorities also decided to scan the shift roster of the men deployed at key points across the city such as American Center, British deputy high commission and British Council Library.

 Officers will also talk to the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners to increase the number of lights around American Center once the Park Street flyover is ready.

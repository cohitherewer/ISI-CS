 Accident victim gets back leg

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The skin had peeled off and the muscles had got all mangled. Awadesh Mishra?s leg had just been crushed under the wheels of a 15-tonne oil tanker. 

 Weeks later, doctors in a city hospital miraculously managed not only to save his leg, but also reconstruct it completely. 

 On April 8, Awadesh Mishra was speeding across the city streets on his motorcycle, when a rickshaw from the opposite direction suddenly appeared in front of him, and he had to apply his brakes. ?I tried to get off my two-wheeler, but could not and fell on the road,? recounted Awadesh. 

 Then, the mammoth oil tanker came upon him and one of its wheels ran over his right leg, turning into a stump of mangled flesh.

 When he was rushed to a local hospital, all the bones of the portion below his right knee lay exposed, with pieces of muscle and dangling skin sticking to it. 

 The doctors who examined him decided on an early amputation to avoid the onset of gangrene. 

 When members of his family were told this, they decided to take Awadesh to Apollo Gleneagles Hospital for a second opinion. 

 ?Fortunately, his bones had not broken in several places, but the skin and muscles had all come out. He was in considerable pain, but he did not want to lose a limb,? said orthopaedic surgeon Buddhadeb Chatterjee. 

 ?Although amputation was one of the first options that came to mind after seeing such a ghastly wound, we decided to do our best to avoid it and save him from another major trauma,? said Gautam Basu, plastic surgeon, who was roped in for treatment. 

 The doctors then decided to take skin from his thigh for reconstruction surgery. 

 An early surgery was performed. The foot was reconstructed with wires and then skin grafting was performed after taking skin from his thigh. The foot was reconstructed and finally, it resembled the real thing. 

 ?I had come to the hospital for amputation of one of my legs, but I have got a chance to walk out of the hospital on both legs,? said an overjoyed Awadesh.

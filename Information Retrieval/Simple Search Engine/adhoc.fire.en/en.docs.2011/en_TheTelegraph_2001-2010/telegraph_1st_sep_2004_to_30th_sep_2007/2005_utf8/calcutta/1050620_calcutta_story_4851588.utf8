The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Floored by filmi fare

 (From top) Kareena Kapoor in Chameli, Murder 

babe Mallika Sherawat and Tata Young, the south-east Asian singer who sang the 

English version of Dhoom machale

If there is one thing that can make or break a nightclub, 

it is the music it plays. While the numbers heard in a lounge bar are supposed 

to soothe the over-wrought nerves, the more happening locations are meant to have 

everyone dancing to their tune.

 And like it or not, the common consensus at any evening hour on Wednesday, Friday or Saturday night will prove that nothing succeeds like Bollywood, and nothing short of the Kaho na kahos or Aisa jadoos will do.

 But what makes some songs disappear without a trace, and other linger till the ears protest? While that secret is impossible to unlock, Goodlife listens in on a few tracks that have kept the night hotspots grooving for more than a year now?

 Song: Kaho na kaho?

 Movie: Murder

 Fact file: Amidst all allegations of plagiarism by music director Anu Malik, people are still swooning to the song. Whether this continued craze was fired ? at least at the outset ? by the visuals of Mallika Sherawat stripping while riding pillion with Emraan Hashmi, is not known. 

 Club call: You just have to play it to get the people on the dance floor. It was a new genre of music for the night raiders. The Arabic tune, Hindi lyrics and the fresh voice (Kunal Ganjawala) clicked with the public, says DJ Akash

 High point: The romance in the lyrics. The DJs tried playing the Arabic version but that met with lukewarm response.

 Song: Dhoom machale

 Movie: Dhoom

 Fact file: The song was as fast paced as the footage of the film. When this song composed by Pritam and voiced by Sunidhi Chauhan is played, revellers are sure to head for the floor. This number still serves as an energy boost for the party crowd. 

 Club call: This hardcore commercial song signifies celebrations and festivity. As soon as a disc jockey plays this track on the console, people realise its party time! Anybody who has ever heard a musical note in this country, has heard this song, says DJ Harish.

 High point: The chorus of the song that has caught on with young and old.

 Song: Bheege honth tere

 Movie: Murder

 Fact file: With its second entry, this soundtrack has clearly stuck in every party animals head. 

 The dancers take to the floor with the same passion as Emraan Hashmi took to Mallika Sherawats lips, with the sleepy voice of Ganjawala working as the perfect catalyst.

 Club call: The song conjures up the image of lovers on screen. The darkness and smoke in the nightclub adds to the charm. Add to it a couple of drinks and many pairs go high on mush, says DJ Vicky. 

 High point: Music is the food of love, after all.

 Song: Saat Samundar

 Movie: Chameli

 Fact file: The film did not set the box office on fire but the dance floor was surely hot. The unusual Sandesh Shandilya number sung by Sunidhi once again, it met lukewarm response in its early days.

 Club call: The song moved up slowly but steadily on a DJs playlist. It has been around for a long time but just refuses to fade away. The people on the floor are in a trance as soon as this song is played, says DJ Akash.

 High point: The folk feel and the Punjabi panache

 Song: Aisa jadoo

 Movie: Khakee

 Fact file: The leggy Lara Dutta moved to the song with Akshay Kumar as company, to Ram Sampats tune and ? who else ? Sunidhi Chauhans voice.

 Club call: The song came at a time when item numbers were at their peek. It packed raw energy and had the feel of a typical item number, says DJ Harish. 

 High point: Raw energy.

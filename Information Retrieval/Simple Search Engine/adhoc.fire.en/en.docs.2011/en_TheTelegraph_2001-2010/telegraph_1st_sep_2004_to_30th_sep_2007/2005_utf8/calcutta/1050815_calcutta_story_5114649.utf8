Reba Dutta: Vacant plots in Salt Lake are filled with garbage thrown by residents. The civic trucks fail to clean up because of the volume of the garbage. Caretakers and labourers in buildings under construction indiscriminately dump garbage and commit nuisance on the roads and vacant plots. What can be done? ?

 Under municipality rules, a plot owner cannot leave the land vacant for more than three years. But there are plots in Salt Lake that are lying vacant for 33 years. The municipality had filed suits against some plot owners, but had lost. In some cases, plots have undergone several transfers and the original owner cannot be traced. Therefore, we cannot take them over. We have asked the police to maintain vigil on labourers working in buildings under construction. Senior officials have told me that they will ask the labourers to carry identity cards. But for this to be successful, the block committees will need to become more active.

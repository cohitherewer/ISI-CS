Pyrotechnic cocktails are fast catching on and are 

as aesthetically pleasing as they are interesting to savour. Most cocktails appeal 

to the young at heart, but those that involve fire and flames are definitely the 

chart-toppers in the league. 

Pyrotechnic cocktails can be simple or complicated, 

but the overriding theme is one of fun with spirits and flames. 

Alcohol is easily combustible and experimentation 

usually results in some sort of success. However, the combination of alcohol and 

flames can be a dangerous one, so you need to be extra careful while dealing with 

them. They are best left to expert hands while you just sit back and enjoy the 

experience.

Flaming Ferrari

One of the most complicated Pyrotechnic cocktails, 

the Flaming Ferrari is also one of the finest. Apart from the ingredients, other 

essentials for a complete experience are a competent drinker and a teetotal photographer 

to record the occasion! 

Into a Martini glass layer the following ingredients 

(by pouring over the back of a spoon) in this order: 25ml shot of Grenadine, 50ml 

shot of Galliano, 50ml shot of Black Sambucca, 50ml shot of Green Chartreuse. 

Pour two shooters of Grand Mariner and rum. 

Now comes the complicated bit. Present the drinker 

with a pair of long straws. Ignite the contents of the Martini glass, and instruct 

the drinker to use the straws to down the contents. 

As the level of alcohol in the glass diminishes, slowly 

pour the shooters into it. 

When the drinker has finished the glass and the shots 

he can justifiably be the Schumacher of the night! 

Rummy Nose

Unlike the Flaming Ferrari the Rummy Nose is simple 

and sweet. 

Fill a large shot glass 2/3 full with medium rum. 

Add a teaspoon of both sugar syrup and passion fruit juice and stir. 

Then float some 151-proof rum on top of the concoction. 

Ignite and enjoy! 

Flaming Moe

The most amusing of them all of course is the Flaming 

Moe and this too is quite simple. 

A combination of equal parts of Tequila, Schnapps 

and Creme De Menthe, this fabulous cocktail takes the cake with its secret ingredient 

? a dollop of cough syrup before the final touch of flame!

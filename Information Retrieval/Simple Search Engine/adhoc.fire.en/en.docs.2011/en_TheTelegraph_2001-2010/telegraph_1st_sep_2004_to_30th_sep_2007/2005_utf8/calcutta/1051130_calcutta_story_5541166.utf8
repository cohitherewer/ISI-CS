Raja, not Ritu

Screen On amp; Off

 The film within a film, orchestrated by Rituparno Ghosh with Prosenjit as his protagonist film-maker, has thrown up some exciting options for the maker of Antarmahal who is raring to chart a course different from his woman-dominated domain. 

 ?Khela has two male protagonists ? a man and a boy. And I hope with this film, people will stop saying that I only make films on women,? laughs Rituparno, while the bungalow set is being readied.

 Khela was born when Rituparno was shooting his first feature film Hirer Angti. ?I liked a child actor very much but his parents didn?t allow him to act. Here, the boy?s parents are unwilling to let him shoot for a film. And so, he asks the film director to get him kidnapped,? says Rituparno, who wanted a child-centric story and so chose Nalak as the ?second? film.

 The film-making unit of Nalak has given Rituparno an opportunity to explore a more humane side. ?The director is the guardian of the unit. While making Nalak, Raja (Prosenjit) takes the help of a woman to handle the child. So, there?s a family which forms and breaks when he returns to his wife. Here, the professional gets transposed into the personal,? says the film-maker, clarifying that Raja is not like Rituparno.

 ?He is a lot more adventurous and passionate about film-making. Perhaps I have given him the traits that I would like to have myself... But the moment you make a film on a film-maker, you start assuming that you know more than him. But it?s very essential to show respect. I think I have become more patient, tolerant and respectful of others? work in the course of making this film,? he says.

 The Nalak unit is an extension of the mother unit of Khela, with some members of Rituparno?s team facing the camera for Prosenjit.

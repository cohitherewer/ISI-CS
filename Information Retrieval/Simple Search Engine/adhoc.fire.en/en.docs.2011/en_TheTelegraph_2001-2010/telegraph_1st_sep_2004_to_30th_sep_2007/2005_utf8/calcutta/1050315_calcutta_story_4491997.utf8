 Strand edifice set for adaptive reuse

 The combination of old and new buildings in cities creates a rich and inspiring environment. Contemporary architecture can enhance the old by relying on sensitive juxtaposition rather than pastiche. ? Sir Norman Foster in a recent exhibition at the British Museum on his work at the Reichtag in Berlin and the British Museum, London.

 The celebrated architect has left his indelible mark on these two projects, global landmarks in conservation architecture both. Now Calcutta stands on the threshold of a meaningful makeover milestone in the heritage quarters of Dalhousie Square, thanks to the first concerted initiative by the city?s private sector in large-scale conservation.

 16, Strand Road, better known as the ?Mackinnon Mackenzie building? ? that splendid edifice sitting majestically at the intersection of Strand Road and Fairlie Place ? is set to get a Rs 100-crore conservation push for adaptive reuse. Owned by Strand Properties, it was once home to such big names like SAIL, UTI, Indian Bank and, of course, Mackinnon Mackenzie amp; Company Ltd.

 After a devastating fire in the early hours of November 7, 1998 almost destroyed the regal structure, it has been languishing in neglect and the high court has ordered its complete demolition and reconstruction. ?We want to restore the magnificent structure to its former glory,? says city-based developer A.N. Shroff, heading Diamond Group, the private consortium that has undertaken the conservation project.

 The later English Renaissance-type cornices, the spectacular ionic pillars, delicately-carved ornaments and its bravura of stones give the building a very distinctive character and the southern and western facades, having ?remarkable old British architectural features?, have been declared heritage structures.

 A report prepared by the department of construction engineering of Jadavpur University in November 2003 speaks of the inadequacy of the structure. Two more years have passed since then and the structure has deteriorated further, increasing the possibility of a collapse.

 ?It is evident from the survey, test reports and analysis that the building has become totally unsafe and can?t be repaired/restored to its original form without reconstruction,? says Dulal Mukherjee, principal architect in the conservation project.

 The development proposal prepared and placed before the heritage building committee of the civic body aims to create a synthesis of old and new, maintaining the old fa?ade and creating ?a modern and intelligent building? with all facilities, according to Mukherjee.

 What is ?old and beautiful? will be retained and meticulously braced and the severely damaged portions will be carefully chiselled out. 

 The core will be rebuilt with the same marble pillars and dome, in sync with the magnanimity of scale in the original construction to create a grand atrium feel.

 Says conservation consultant to the project Manish Chakraborti: ?Efforts will be made to render the atrium as attractive as possible by taking the dome up to the top and creating public spaces for interaction like in star hotels.? A two-level basement parking lot in the north-east corner will seek to address the huge parking needs of the area.

 The Diamond Group is looking at assigning large chunks of space to single entities in the reconstructed building for the sake of continuity. ?The approach has to be very pragmatic, factoring in commercial sustainability,? says Chakraborti.

 Mukherjee, working with conservation architect Shivashis Bose on the project, feels the redone Mackinnon Mackenzie building could become the ?brand ambassador of a resuscitated Dalhousie Square and can inspire others to create similar contemporary spaces of interest? through conservation and restoration.

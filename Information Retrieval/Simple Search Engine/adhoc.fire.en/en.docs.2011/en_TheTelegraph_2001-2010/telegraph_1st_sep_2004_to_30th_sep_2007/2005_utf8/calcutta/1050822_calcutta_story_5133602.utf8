The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 There is an acute dearth of proper sheds for bus passengers in the city. While very few have seats for the passengers, most have been fully or partially encroached upon by unauthorised occupants. Over the years, many passenger sheds made of cement have become worn out. Newly-built backlit sheds are defective in their design and their supporting rods are bent under the weight of the huge billboards on top. I have made specific complaints to the authorities concerned, but to no avail.

 Swapan Kumar Kundu,

 Debinibas Road. 

 The area around Garia no. 5 bus terminus is becoming prone to accidents by the day. Earlier, a tragedy at the depot had claimed the lives of two budding engineers. The traffic police does not seem interested in enforcing traffic rules in the area. Minibuses and autorickshaws have a free run. School and college students are the worst sufferers. The area is under the jurisdiction of Jadavpur police. No action has been taken by them yet.

 Arun Gupta, 

 Baishnabghata. 

 Many government offices do not have a public phone. In those that do, the equipment does not work. I have noticed this in the GPO and even at Jatin Das Park Metro station.

 Prantik Sanyal, 

 SP Mukherjee Road.

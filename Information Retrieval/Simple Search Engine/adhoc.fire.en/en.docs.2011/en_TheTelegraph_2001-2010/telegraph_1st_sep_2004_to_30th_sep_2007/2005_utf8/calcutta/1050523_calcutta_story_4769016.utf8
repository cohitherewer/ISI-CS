 The weekly fashion fiesta at Souravs: The Food Pavilion was more about style than fashion last Friday as designer Chhuti brought to the fore the need to flaunt a personal style statement while following popular fashion. 

 Her line on display at the fourth floor restobar mirrored the current trend of matching skirts with bustiers and off-shoulders in bright hues. However, its her stylisation that made a bold and interesting statement. Everyone can follow fashion, but being able to establish ones own style is what really matters, felt Chhuti.

 The models donned natural make-up to go with her outfits, resulting in a striking look. After a long day at work most of us dont have the time or the energy to apply elaborate make-up. The look here is careless, but eye-catching, stressed Chhuti who used charcoal for eye make-up and red mud to add colour to the models faces. 

 To accessorise the outfits, Chhuti used her signature multi-coloured ribbons made from leftover cloth. Wearing these as headgear, neckpieces and hand bands, the models showcased her printed and embroidered designs.

 Tattoo try

 If you dare to bare, fill in with interesting tattoos for more eye candy. Skeletons, the solar system and Cupid ? the patterns on display at the tattoo night in Cloud 9 on Friday packed in a lot of punch. 

 A tattoo artist at the venue painted quite a few bare backs, arms and almost any part of the body one was willing to show off. This one is really going to prove a colourful night, yelled a reveller over his shoulder. 

 Thus geared, the night raiders grooved to their hearts content to stuff emanating from the DJ console, like Kaho na kaho, Pretty woman, Saat samundar and more. 

 Croon crown

 Their simple lyrics, Teri toh, teri tah, has rocked many a party across the globe. Bombay Rockers brought the action to Calcutta at Fusion on Saturday evening. 

 If the bubbling excitement at the restobar in Golden Park was anything to go by, Calcutta was waiting for this Denmark-based duo, Navtej Singh Rehal and Thomas Sardorf, for a long time. 

 As pretty young things chucked their shoes to climb on to sofas to catch a better view of the cute crooners, the duo made a dramatic entry, literally singing their way into the choc-a-bloc venue, taking their fans completely by surprise. 

 By the time they walked across the venue to the raised platform on one side doubling up as the stage, the only audible words were Teri toh, teri tah, as the crowd began to scream in sheer frenzy.

 A half-hour performance saw them belting out some of their other hits as well, including Ari ari and Sexy mama. 

 However, as far as Calcuttas party people were concerned, the party began and ended with just that one track they had come to hear.

 Remixed

 A guest DJ undoubtedly helps spruce up your nightclub act. And the weekend flavour at BED on Ballygunge Circular Road was remixes as DJ Suketu from Mumbai mixed Bin tere sanam, Woh lamhe, Pyar zindagi hai and even the ancient Hamma hamma to give the crowd something to dance to. 

 The DJ proved yet again that there is no beating the remix rage, which he had exploited with Bin tere sanam in 2004. A runaway hit, the number had the entire nation hooked. From discotheques to car stereos, from FM stations to cell phone ring tones, it was on everybodys lips. 

 And now the table turner has presented the latest craze at every nightclub, Woh lamhe from the film Zeher, in a new avatar. When I decide to remix a song, I go by instinct. If it works it is luck, if it bombs, well, better luck next time, shrugged the DJ. 

 Bin tere sanam is a melodious track and quite a favourite with lovebirds. But I did not imagine it to be such a huge hit. The same holds good for Lamhe, too. A slow and sensuous track, its a bigger hit at the nightclubs, added Suketu.

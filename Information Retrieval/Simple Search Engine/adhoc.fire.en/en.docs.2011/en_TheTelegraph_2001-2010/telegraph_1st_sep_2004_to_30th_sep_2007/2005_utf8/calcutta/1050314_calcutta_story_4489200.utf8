 Suicide by patient

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 35-year-old man suffering from Hepatitis B committed suicide by jumping off the second floor of the Marwari Relief Society Hospital building on Sunday morning. 

 The body, lying on the ground with blood oozing out of the wounds in the head, was first noticed by the hospital?s employees. Doctors rushed to the spot and, upon examination, pronounced the man dead.

 According to police, the man committed suicide early on Sunday. 

 ?It was around 6 am that the hospital staff noticed Shiv Kumar Sonkar, from the Burrabazar area, lying on the ground. No one noticed him leaving his bed and walking out of his room attached to the ward where he was admitted,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 ?After talking to other patients, we came to know that Sonkar had slept last night as on other days. Around midnight, they heard him groaning,? said an officer of Posta police station.

 Sonkar was admitted to hospital last Wednesday with acute pain in his abdomen. 

 ?After conducting medical tests, doctors confirmed that he was a Hepatitis B patient. Then he was shifted to the new ward on the second floor,? said the officer.

 After going through Sonkar?s medical report, police confirmed that he was an alcoholic. ?His liver was affected. The level of bilirubin, a digestive fluid, was high, causing an acute problem of indigestion,? said a doctor of the hospital.

 The room in which Sonkar was staying with other patients has a balcony. Nobody was on guard at the door. Police feel Sonkar woke up early in the morning and left his room. He stood on the railing of the balcony and jumped off.

 He fell on a concrete slab. The employees who saw the body first knew he could not have survived the fall.

 Police sent the body for post-mortem. Though allegations of negligence were made in the Posta area, Sonkar?s family members did not make any complaint, police said.

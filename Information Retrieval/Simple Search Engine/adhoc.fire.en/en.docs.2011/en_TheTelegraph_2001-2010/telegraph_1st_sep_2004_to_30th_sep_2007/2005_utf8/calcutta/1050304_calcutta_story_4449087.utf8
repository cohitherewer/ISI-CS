 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s B-team is ready with its ?first ever?, 12-day-long sales pitch in Europe. The team, led by IT minister Manab Mukherjee, will visit Sweden, Germany and England, between March 7 and 18, to showcase the state?s strengths as an IT destination.

 ?This is our first such mission outside the country and we have drawn up an elaborate plan to make it successful and create some positive noises about business opportunities in Bengal,? said state IT secretary G.D. Gautama.

 Though the initiative is new for the Bengal government, states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat have been doing this for some time and drawing higher foreign direct investments.

 Besides the three government representatives ? Mukherjee, Gautama and S. K. Mitra, managing director, Webel ? the team will comprise representatives from 18 city-based IT companies, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, SkyTech Solutions, Web Development Company, AnshinSoft, On Track Systems, Globsyn Technologies and UshaComm.

 According to the detailed itinerary drawn up by the IT department, with help from Indian embassies, the first stop will be Stockholm. During the three days the team spends in the Swedish capital, Mukherjee will call on the top-brass of Electrolux and Ericsson and meet representatives of the Swedish Export Trade Council and Foretagen, the apex IT association in Sweden.

 ?The five days in Germany will be very important for us. At Hanover, we will take part in CeBIT, the biggest IT exposition in the world, and our minister will make a presentation during the India Day celebrations on March 14,? said Gautama. One-to-one meetings with companies like SAP, Siemens and Deutsche Telecom are also on the agenda.

 Representatives from the IT companies will share their experience of doing business in the state during meetings with industry associations at Hanover and Hamburg. 

 ?Being based in Calcutta has never posed problems for us. Now when the government is trying to bring in more companies, we want to tell the world about the benefits of being in Bengal,? said D.K. Chaudhuri, chief executive officer, SkyTech Solutions.

 Scouting for new business partners will also figure high on the to-do list of the companies. ?With the weakening of the dollar, Europe has emerged as a very important market,? explained Chaudhuri.

 On the last leg of the trip, the team will spend four days in the UK, where minister Mukherjee will call on the heads of finance and banking majors like HSBC, Barclays Bank, Aviva and TSB Lloyds.

 ?There is a huge opportunity in back-office processing for banking and finance companies, and we have the relevant skills in Calcutta. So, we will meet these companies, besides catching up with tech companies like Tesco and Xansa,? explained Gautama.

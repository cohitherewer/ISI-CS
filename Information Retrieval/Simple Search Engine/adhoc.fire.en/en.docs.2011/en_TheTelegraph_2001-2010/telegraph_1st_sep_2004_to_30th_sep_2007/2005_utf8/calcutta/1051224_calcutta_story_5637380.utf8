 Acres balm on land rates

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Both Azim Premji and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can breathe easy. 

 With the state government deciding to acquire a further 330 acres off Rajarhat, in addition to the 300 acres already earmarked for the IT/ITES industry, the rate roadblock slowing down the sector has been removed.

 The state nodal agency for land development in Rajarhat, Hidco, had steadfastly refused to lower the price of land in New Town, forcing a face-off with the IT department and resulting in a stalemate that had even pushed Premji on to the back foot.

 The Wipro chief, who had asked for a further 40 acres to expand, was offered the same at Rs 2.16 crore per acre. Premji had then pointed out that other IT centres like Pune and Gurgaon were offering land in the price range of Rs 40 to 60 lakh.

 Now, the Bengal government could well match those rates. With 630 acres located between Rajarhat and the airport opening up for the IT sector, Bhattacharjee and his Team IT can woo companies more aggressively, without being tripped by Hidco?s terms.

 ?There are certainly going to be takers. For the resurgence of industry in Bengal, this has come at the perfect time. The price of land, although not fixed yet, will depend upon the acquisition process,? said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, ministry of information technology.

 The IT ministry plans to develop the new-found area as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), but with a difference ? social infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, restaurants and all in place ? before handing plots over to IT and ITES companies.

 ?The process of acquisition is already on. It will take at least a year to acquire so much land. First, we have to undertake the expression of interest,? said minister for information technology Manab Mukherjee, adding that the project will be developed on a public-private partnership model.

 Industry-watchers, too, have welcomed the move. 

 Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, Indian Chamber of Commerce, said: ?There is a critical balance that must be maintained between the price of land and business prospects of the IT industry in Bengal. We do feel that the price of land in Rajarhat is on the higher side.?

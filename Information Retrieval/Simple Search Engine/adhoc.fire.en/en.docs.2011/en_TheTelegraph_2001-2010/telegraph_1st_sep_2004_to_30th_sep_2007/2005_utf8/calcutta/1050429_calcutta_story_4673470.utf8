Life

 Small talk

 Business baatein

 If you have some money on the market, chances are you are cursing both the Ambani brothers right now. Boardroom battles may look good on The Apprentice, but in real life, someone always suffers. So as Anil swaggered his way through and schmoozed with the media, Mukesh pulled out the big sixes and scored big time (game, set and match to Reliance XI, kya?). For all you irate investors, line up at the bar, and drink to saas-bahu battles that leave your bank account intact.

 Magic once more

 It?s d?j? vu. Almost a decade ago, Shah Rukh and Malaika Arora rocked to Rahman?s tune atop a train for Mani Ratnam?s Dil Se. And now, it?s time for Kaal, with King Khan doing an item number for the first time with who else but Mrs Arbaaz Khan for company. Debutant director Soham promises the film will be a cocktail of Karan Johar?s grandeur and Ram Gopal Varma?s grit. So take a peek and find out for yourself, before starting a chatter session about our ageless heroes and their still-ravishing sirens for company. But don?t be late, lest you miss the fun: just like Chhaiyya chhaiyya, Kaal dhamaal kick-starts the film and is over before you can scream SRK.

 Fashion facts

 Even if you are not sure what differentiates pret from couture, you better get your fashion facts right as you step out to party this weekend. With the Lakme India Fashion Week just over, there?s no way you can get away without indulging in some style talk. While those in the know of things will start rambling about the hot trends that?ll dictate the year, an easy way out is to simply take your pick from the designers who showcased, raving about some and ranting against others.

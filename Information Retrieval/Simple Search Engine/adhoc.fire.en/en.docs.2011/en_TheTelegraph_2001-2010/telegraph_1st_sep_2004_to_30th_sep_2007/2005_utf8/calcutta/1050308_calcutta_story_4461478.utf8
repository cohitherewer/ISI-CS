The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Terms of affection, a pat of warmth

 - Geriatric unit to the aid of lonely, insecure senior citizens

 SANJAY MANDAL

 A survey reveals that the elderly and alone miss the family touch during illness. A tie-up facility intends to make amends

BR Chatterjee committed suicide by jumping from the top floor of a highrise in 

the southern part of the city a few months ago. Chatterjee?s son stays in the 

US and after his wife died, he was unable to overcome his loneliness.

 Saroj Kapoor lives on Manoharpukur Road. With her husband dead and son 

and daughter living in the US and London, respectively, Kapoor finds no one beside 

her during illness, although money is not a problem for her. 

 Loneliness, a sense of insecurity, lying unattended by near and dear ones during illness, living under constant fear of their houses being burgled in the dead of the night and facing numerous other problems almost every day ? life is often hellish for senior citizens in Calcutta.

 With no proper support from the state government and almost forsaken by society, the aged are seeking help from social organisations and private hospitals.

 One such organisation, the Indian Association for Retired Persons (IARP), has conducted a survey, which revealed that the major problems faced by senior citizens include loneliness, a sense of insecurity and lack of support from the family during illness. 

 ?Most of our members, suffering from these problems, are in need of affection and personal care,? said Krishna Basu, general secretary of the organisation.

 AMRI Hospitals has tied up with IARP to set up a geriatric-care unit, which will provide the much-needed support to senior citizens. 

 ?The unit will start functioning from this month,? said S.B. Purkayastha, president of AMRI. Apart from providing treatment, the hospital?s counsellor and IARP volunteers will pay regular visits to those in need of help.

 ?Apart from getting themselves admitted to hospitals, there are other problems faced by senior citizens,? said Basu. 

 At times, they suffer from diseases that require them to be admitted to a hospital, but force them to be confined to bed at home. ?In such a situation, you need someone beside you,? she added.

 During hospitalisation, one major issue is how these old people will manage their finances themselves. 

 ?Especially those whose husbands or wives have died and who are living alone just do not know how to manage their finances while they are in hospital,? pointed out A.K. Basu, another senior citizen.

 Manjusree Das, who stays alone at her Golf Club Road residence, cannot go to her favourite cultural shows as she has no one to accompany her. ?There is no one to share my feelings and so what is the use of going for a theatre show or a concert?? asked Das.

 Senior residents of Salt Lake face another problem. ?In the township, old people suffer from a terrible sense of insecurity,? said Ajit Chatterjee, secretary of Salt Lake Senior Citizens? Association.

 ?The place is very lonely and police patrolling is quite insufficient. Old people live with the fear of being robbed or murdered,? Chatterjee added.

 Another resident of Salt Lake, Mrinmoy K. Chowdhury, whose son stays in the US, feels there is a lack of community feeling in the township and this adds to the feeling of loneliness and insecurity. 

 ?Community feeling should be developed,? averred Chowdhury.

 The association has tied up with a voluntary organisation to provide medical care and other support to senior citizens at odd hours.

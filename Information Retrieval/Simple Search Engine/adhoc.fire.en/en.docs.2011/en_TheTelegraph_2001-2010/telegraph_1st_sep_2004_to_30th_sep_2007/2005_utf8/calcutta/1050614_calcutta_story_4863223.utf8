Life

 Plastic petals

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 If you need to add new sparkle to your home, reach out for some plastic fillers for your flower arrangement that shine like glass. 

 usters of tiny leaves, flowers and berries mounted on rather realistic twigs help lend a dreamy touch to the surroundings. 

 Available in myriad shades of blue, green, orange and violet, the twigs are a glittering, happy bunch in themselves or can be combined with any flower arrangement ? artificial or real. 

 If you crave yet more glitz, there are shiny leaf fillers seeped in gold glitter. For a slice of moonshine there are clusters of thermocol buds dusted with silver shimmer. Yet more fairytale features include weepy silver willows of leaves and berries that droop and fall out of a vase with elegant charm. 

 Once you take a shine to the sheen, you may want to spread the glamour from obscure corners onto the full glare of tabletops.

 How much

 Rs 95 to Rs 140 per stick

Small glass grape clusters would work well front and centre. The three or four inch grape bunches come in rich blue, green, orange, grey, yellow and maroon. Dont look for realism here!

 While the glassy ornaments are best left to the professionals, you can add a touch of charm to your home (while saving a buck) by trying to fashion some glitter fillers yourself.

 Scraps of cloth, plastic, thermocol, gold and silver glitter, twigs, pins, glue and lots of imagination is all you need to make it all come true.

 Apex court order in temple case

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed Adridharan Das, former president of the ISKCON temple in Calcutta, to appear before the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) on Thursday with all relevant documents relating to the criminal case filed against him by the current president, Dayaram Das.

 Dayaram had alleged that Adridharan had misappropriated crores during his tenure as president. He had collected the money by promising to make people life members of ISKCON, Dayaram claimed.

 Adridharan was suspended on March 2, 2003. 

 After the complaint was made in the chief judicial magistrate?s court in Calcutta, Adridharan moved Bangalore sessions court, claiming he was resident of that city. 

 The Bangalore court granted him bail for 10 days. He then moved Bangalore High Court against the order, but his petition was dismissed. 

 The Alipore SDJM issued an arrest warrant against Adridharan on December 3, 2003. He moved an anticipatory bail plea in the Alipore sessions court, which was dismissed. Calcutta High Court upheld the decision. Adridharan then moved the Supreme Court.

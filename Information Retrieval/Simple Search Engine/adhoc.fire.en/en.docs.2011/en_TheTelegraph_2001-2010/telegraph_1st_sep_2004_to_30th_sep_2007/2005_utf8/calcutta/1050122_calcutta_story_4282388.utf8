 Safety plea at museum

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Indian Museum authorities on Friday urged secretary Neena Ranjan of the department of culture and tourism to consider a total revamp of the security arrangements at the JL Nehru Road address. They said only this could prevent further loss or theft of valuables in its collection.

 Ranjan and Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who is also chairman of the museum?s trustee board, held a meeting with director Shakti Kali Basu to examine the existing security arrangements. 

 The museum authorities urged that 21 vacant posts of security guards be filled up, and that the Central Industrial Security Force be deployed.

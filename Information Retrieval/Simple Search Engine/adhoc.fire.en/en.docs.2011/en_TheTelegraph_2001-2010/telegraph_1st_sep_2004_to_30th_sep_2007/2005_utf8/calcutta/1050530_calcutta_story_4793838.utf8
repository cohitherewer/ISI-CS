 Pop tops for night prowl

 Sheer fabrics, bold cuts and oodles of shine and shimmer rule the roost in party wear, finds out Ipsita Deb

 W ith the mercury soaring higher every day, you wont find a better time to show off your bare back and midriff, especially when it comes to dressing up for a night out. To beat the weather at its own game is the idea as you hot things up with a minimalist mantra for your party wardrobe over the coming weeks. And since the good ol jeans will rule the lowers anyway, its what lies above the navel that will help you make a statement.

 Sheer fabrics, bold cuts and a dash of shine and shimmer are what goes well in summer party wear, says designer Komal Sood. Komals label Kyra offers a host of designs in party tops this season.

 Material matters

 While cottons are best reserved for the sweltering day, chiffons, crepes and georgettes should take over for the night hours. However, for those refusing to let go of the comfort quotient of cotton, there are some variations of the fabric that will let you and your skin breathe without compromising on the glamour factor.

 Body-hugging cotton knit blouses and crochet tops are quite a rage this summer and are available at a number of stores. Priced anything above Rs 500, a wide variety of these can be spotted on the racks of Kyra on Free School Street and Bizarre in Forum.

 Actress Nilanjanaa swears by cotton for the season and refuses to don any other fabric when she goes out partying. 

 In summer I keep socialising to an absolute minimum. But if Im forced to go out, I prefer to wear something in either linen or cotton, no matter how dull others might find it, she says.

 Colour story

 Off-white, beige, baby pink, dirty pink, mauve, lilac, sky blue and light turquoise are the in colours this time round, says designer Abhishek Dutta. But he is quick to add that when it comes to party wear, shades of red never go out of style.

 Extra effects

 Sequins, stones, metal chips, thread work, bold retro prints ? embellishments in every form adorn the tops this season (Reuters picture shows Paris Hilton in a sequinned halter top).

 Colourful graphic prints are the order of the day and one can find anything from spaghetti straps and sleeveless tunics to netted tops sporting these effects, says Komal. 

 At Bizarre you can find chic tops with simple embroidery and sash-like ribbons running across the garments, while Be: in Forum offers summery stone-worked and stringed backless ones. Little India on Elgin Road boasts a collection of stylish designer tops with prints, embroidery and glitzy embellishments.

 Chic show

 Experimenting with cuts and styles is just the thing to do if you are making the most of the beat-the-heat excuse. Low necks, spaghettis, off-shoulders, halters, backless and stringed styles are some of the cuts to be seen in. 

 The range of backless tops at Be: starts at Rs 1,500 and that at Bizarre is priced similarly. Gorgeous halter necks at Kyra start at Rs 500, while strappy tops are priced lower. However, scouting the small, unbranded haunts at Metro Plaza, AC Market and Vardaan Market is a good idea if you want to stock some stylish options without burning a hole in your pocket. 

 Teeing off

 If dare bare is not your style, your party wardrobe could well do with some jewelled T-shirts in bright colours. These cotton or lycra tees are adorned by sequins and stone work.

 We have introduced a series of stylish tees, both sleeveless and cap-sleeved with graphic prints and catchy one-liners. We also have a line of halter-neck and strappy tops that is doing very well right now, said a spokesperson for Westside. 

 Pantaloons and Shoppers Stop also have colourful and fashionable options on the tee front, ranging upwards of Rs 250.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Forest blast was plotted in Calcutta

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The landmine blast and the subsequent shootout in a Purulia forest that killed the officer-in-charge of a police station two years ago had been planned in the city by top-ranking Maoists from Andhra Pradesh and Nepal.

 Officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) have come to know this after grilling three youths, all arrested in Calcutta in connection with the violence.

 ?The three, including a woman, were not present at the blast site, but they had plotted the attack on orders from the top-rung leadership. They had also played a key role in supplying the explosives used in the blast,? said an officer working on the case.

 On October 11, 2003, a landmine exploded under a jeep carrying policemen to Kantabora forest in Purulia. The blast was followed by an encounter between Naxalites and the police, in which Nilmadhab Das, officer-in-charge of Bandwan police station, was killed. 

 After two years, on June 16, police picked up Dipanjan Mukherjee from Ultadanga, Kanika Debnath from Jorabagan and Sabyasachi Goswami from Khardah. 

 ?We have come across a body of evidence proving their links with the banned CPI (Maoist). All three have been booked for waging war against the state, attempting murder and possessing arms illegally,? the officer said. ?Going through the letters written by top leaders of the organisation, we have also come to know about their other plans.?

 The three told police that Kishanji, a senior leader of the banned Maoist Communist Centre in Andhra Pradesh, and a Maoist leader in Nepal, visited the city several times and discussed strategies with members of the Calcutta committee of the CPI (Maoist).

 ?The youths were running the organisation after the arrest of politburo member Sushil Roy and state committee member Patitpaban Halder,? said a sleuth.

 Fearing a massive hunt for them, the three had chalked out an escape plan. ?On May 22, they, along with several senior leaders, had planned to leave the city on a long-distance train from Sealdah. Acting on a tip-off, a CID-Special Branch team rushed to the station in the nick of time, but the gang managed to give police the slip,? the officer added.

 The arrested youths were also reportedly in touch with college and university students to elicit their support for the Maoist cause.

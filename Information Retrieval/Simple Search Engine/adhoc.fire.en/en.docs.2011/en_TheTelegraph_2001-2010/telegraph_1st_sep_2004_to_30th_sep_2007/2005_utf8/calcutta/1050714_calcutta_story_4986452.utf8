The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hoodwink operation in hospital

 The state health department fooled Medical 

 Council of India inspectors on imperative ENT equipment at 

 SSKM Hospital to bag the college seal. Ear surgery continues, 

 doctors in the dark and patients at risk... 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 There?s a scam at SSKM Hospital 

 and the authorities are turning a deaf ear ? deliberately.

 During inspections at the hospital, 

 the state health department has, on several occasions, misled 

 the Medical Council of India (MCI) by making it believe 

 that the ENT department is equipped with audiometry facilities, 

 one of the pre-requisites for seeking undergraduate medical 

 education status in a hospital.

 An audiometry test reveals the 

 extent of nerve damage and the precise state of an ear disease. 

 Owing to the absence of the facility at SSKM, ENT experts 

 are depending solely on their clinical eye to judge a patient?s 

 condition, and thereby putting them to great risk.

 Of 500 surgeries carried out at 

 the hospital?s ENT department every month, 80 per cent of 

 patients suffer ear problems, ranging from otosclerosis 

 (bony growth in ear), chronic supprative otitis media (pus 

 formation) to secretary otitis media (secretion from ear), 

 that require the audiometry test.

 ?At least 50 per cent of patients 

 come back to us every month despite surgery. We are acting 

 blindfolded now, but is there any choice? We cannot throw 

 out patients or say no to them,? said a senior doctor at 

 SSKM on Wednesday.

 The MCI carries out regular inspections 

 in medical colleges to check if they have all the mandatory 

 facilities to run an undergraduate course, of which audiometry 

 is an essential component.

 The most recent case of the state 

 health department ?hoodwinking? the MCI is only three months 

 old. The department asked an audiologist, who had resigned 

 nearly two years earlier, to pose as regular staff in front 

 of an old audiometry machine for the benefit of the MCI 

 inspectors.

 For the past year-and-a-half, 

 SSKM has been carrying out complicated surgeries of the 

 ear without the mandatory audiological test, contrary to 

 MCI norms. The hospital has an antediluvian audiometry machine, 

 but no one to run it.

 ?We have been trying desperately 

 to get an audiologist, and I am hopeful that the government 

 will understand the gravity of the situation and appoint 

 an audiologist immediately,? was all SSKM Hospital superintendent 

 Santanu Tripathi would say.

 MCI officers in Delhi, who were 

 completely in the dark about the situation, said they would 

 take the matter up with the Bengal government.

 ?A proper audiological facility 

 is definitely one of the pre-conditions for granting recognition 

 to a medical college. We will certainly look into this matter,? 

 said Ketan Desai, former chairman of MCI.

 In the absence of an audiometry 

 test, only the few who can pay for it get it done from diagnostic 

 centres outside SSKM Hospital, say doctors. Patients suffering 

 from tinnitus (ringing sensation in the ear), vertigo and 

 deafness must also undergo an audiometry test before treatment.

 Hoping that an audiologist would 

 be appointed soon, the hospital has built a special audio-vestibular 

 unit (sound-proof room). But nothing else has moved so far.

 C.R. Maiti, director of medical 

 education, said efforts were underway to get a suitable 

 candidate for the post. ?We are also studying a public-private 

 proposal submitted by a doctor,? he added.

 Anirban Biswas, an expert in audiometry 

 who had tabled the proposal four months ago, said: ?This 

 test is the most vital for treating any ear disease. Conducting 

 a surgery without an audiometry test is an offence.?

 With films like Devdas and Paheli leaving their mark on style trends in the country, traditional jewellery is suddenly a hit with fashionistas. Women in Calcutta can now feast their eyes on and then pamper themselves with some ethnic ornaments at an exhibition of kundan and jadau at the Taj Bengal till August 28.

 Hosted by Surana Jewellers of Jaipur, at the Mandarin Room of the Alipore hotel, the exhibition houses an extensive collection of opulent pieces ranging from earrings, neck pieces, nose-rings, haathfuls, baajubandhs to maangtikas in handmade gold and kundan. The traditional designs are embellished with emeralds, rubies, diamonds, sapphire and semi-precious stones in myriad hues of red, turquoise, green, pink, violet and yellow.

 The house of Surana Jewellers dates back 250 years when Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh invited our ancestors to promote the art of intricate jewellery in Jaipur. Till date, we strive to maintain the age-old excellence. The jewellery is totally inspired by Moghul designs, says Kamal C. Surana of Surana Jewellers.

 so on offer is a range exclusively for men, including sherwani buttons, kurta buttons, cufflinks and pens adorned with diamonds.

 Skin solutions

 One of the most ancient healing sciences, Ayurveda, is also one of the most fashionable forms of modern beauty care. A hint of the word herbal or ayurvedic adds a dash of credibility to a lot of beauty products. And No Marks Sananda Rupashi, an interactive workshop spanning seven weeks in various districts of Bengal, aims to promote Ayurveda as skincare.

 The workshops, being conducted by Ayurveda specialist Subhodip Saha along with nine trained beauty advisers from No Marks, educates consumers about the potential of Ayurveda in dealing with beauty and skin problems. Live demonstrations, health tips and yoga therapies to look and feel good are also on the agenda.

 We are hosting these one-day workshops in various places in Bengal. Apart from Calcutta, where the first one took place three weeks ago, we will be going to Siliguri, Burdwan, Malda and Durgapur. We will, of course, come back to Calcutta. Since this city accounts for 52 per cent of our Bengal sales, the market here is very important for us, says Sandeep Ghosh, general manager (sales), Ozone Ayurvedics, the company that owns the brand No Marks.

 The workshops are open to all, we are advertising in newspapers and also sending out invitations, adds Ghosh.

 While the first workshop in Calcutta was held in the Pantaloons store at 22, Camac Street, the venue for the second one, scheduled to be held in another couple of weeks, is yet to be announced.

 With its presence in 17,000 outlets all over the state, No Marks caters to 1.75-crore people in Bengal. We started off from Calcutta three years ago and now 38 per cent of the population of Bengal is directly covered by us, claims Ghosh.

 Products in the No Marks portfolio include No Mark Anti-Blemish Fairness Cream, the flagship item of the brand, mark removing cream, elbow cream, scrub soap, moisturising soap and oil-control soap.

 Dog-eaten baby ado dies down

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Life was as usual on Friday at Rabindrapally. It didn?t matter much to the residents of this bustling Baguiati locality that three street dogs had fed on an abandoned baby on Thursday.

 The post-mortem has revealed that the baby was already dead when the dogs fed on it. 

 The test, conducted at the Barasat district hospital on Friday, also revealed that the baby had been delivered by ?trained? hands.

 ?The body was decomposed and a large part of it had been eaten up. So, we could not ascertain the gender,? said Kusum Adhikary, chief medical officer of health, North 24-Parganas. The ?float test? suggests it was stillborn.

 Back at Rabindrapally, the only visible difference was that the windows of all three residential estates, around the spot where the body was seen, were shut throughout the day.

 Passers-by looked at the spot, exchanged whispers and moved on. Residents could be seen discussing the incident at tea-stalls and markets. 

 Gobinda Saha, who runs a grocery shop near the spot, said: ?We did not initially realise that the dogs were feeding on a baby. Alerted by their barks, we went near the spot and found out that they were eating a human baby. We immediately informed our councillor.? 

 Police, however, said they could not proceed further with the case. 

 ?We have received a complaint from local councillor Kakali Ghosh Bagui, but it is difficult to trace those who had dumped the body,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. ?Even if we catch them, we can only charge them with wrongful disposal of the body,? he added.

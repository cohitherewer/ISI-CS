Life

 Small talk

 The party season may be a little damp right now but power lunches are very much on the social plate. What better way to spend a sultry afternoon and catch up on the high-profile international flavour of the week? Heres ensuring youre not left out of the loop...

 Sibley socials

 If your social diary has been a little dull of late, keep a watch for an invite to at least one of the sundry Sibley farewell parties being thrown all over town.

 In case thats not quite up your street, it still leaves room for gossip about how Lee Alison Sibley, wife of US Consul General George Sibley, became perhaps the first diplomats wife in town to be feted upon her departure. 

 ?One usually thinks of inviting Lee first and poor George is often just an afterthought,? is a one-liner that can be safely cracked in favour of the lady with a booming voice and a shock of auburn hair, who endeared herself to many with her verve, charm and talent like singing Rabindrasangeet at the drop of a hat!

 Blair basics

 Ultimately it all boils down to economy. That wouldnt be a bad line to take as you attempt to analyse British premier Tony Blairs historic win to power on Friday for a third straight term. 

 But dont discount popular discontent over Blair toeing the US line to embroil Britain in the war against Iraq, which saw the PMs authority weakening. It showed in a reduced majority in Parliament, in sharp contrast to his landslide victory in the 2001 elections.

 Take care not to sound surprised at the verdict. It was to be expected as a robust economy is the plank Blair has been labouring on, and, given the rather weak Conservative opposition in the form of Michael Howard.

 But Blair bashers with a good memory of the recent Cherriegate scandal can take heart. The 52-year-old has declared that this would be his last term.

 Haldia high

 Move over Laxmi Mittal, Purnendu Chatterjee is here. That could be the proud toast at a Bengali-loyalist gathering this weekend. Chatterjee, the private partner in Haldia Petrochemicals, has just clinched the biggest foreign deal ever by an Indian by sewing up the buyout of Basell, a Dutch company worth an estimated 4.4 billion euro ($5.7 billion).

 A little cluck-clucking over more US muscle flexing may also be in order. Hold forth about how Irans state-owned National Petrochemical Company, favoured to buy the worlds top producer of the plastic polypropylene, was virtually elbowed out of the race. 

 But dont keep all your eggs in one basket: raise an eyebrow about the 51-year-old businessmans ability to raise a further Rs 1,560 crore, with which he plans to buy the Bengal governments stake in Haldia Petrochemicals.

 Sam again

 Ajay Devgan as Sean Penn? Difficult, but definitely not impossible. The man whos stunned critics and masses with his power-packed performances in films like Zakhm and The Legend of Bhagat Singh is set to slip into the shoes of Penn in Main Aisa Hi Hoon, the desi adaptation of I Am Sam. 

 With Sushmita Sen and Esha Deol for company under the trained eye of director Harry Baweja, the film is definitely worth a dekho.

 At least, thats the word according to Ajay and Esha, ever since they came to town to promote the film.

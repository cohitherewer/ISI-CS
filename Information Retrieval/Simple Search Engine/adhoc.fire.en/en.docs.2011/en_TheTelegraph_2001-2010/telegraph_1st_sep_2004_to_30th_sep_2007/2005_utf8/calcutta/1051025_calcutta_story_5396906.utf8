From Viennese coffee in Flurys to Cuban cigars in Big Ben. From Kali temple in Chinatown to Kabiraji cutlet in Coffee House. Calcutta is being captured again. Not on celluloid, though. On digi-beta cameras for a new show on Discovery Travel amp; Living called Indian Rendezvous.

 ?To start sometime early next year, Indian Rendezvous will first feature six metropolitan cities before moving on to smaller cities,? Sudesh Kumar, executive producer for the show from Discovery, told Metro on Monday. ?We have shot in Delhi, will finish Calcutta by Tuesday, and then move on to Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore.?

 Trying to introduce the city to anybody interested in visiting the place, Indian Rendezvous plans to present both the facets of Calcutta ? the old world and the new age. ?So we have the addas in Coffee House and also lunches at Tung Fong,? explains Sandeep Rudra, the production manager of the shoot. ?We are also showing heritage tram rides and tracing back the family of KC Das, the people behind the rasogolla.?

The Calcutta leg is being anchored by Konkona Sen 

Sharma, who?s also appeared for the Flurys and tram shots. ?We have different 

people for different cities,? reveals Kumar. ?The anchors have to be from the 

respective cities. For Calcutta, we thought Konkona would be the best choice since 

she is not only a local celebrity but has also made her foray into the national 

level of mainstream cinema.?

 This mix of new and old Calcutta will be the first real feature of the city on the channel that?s become a mainstay for those interested in leading a good life. ?We are also presenting the city in that way,? says Kumar. ?We are focusing on the places where you can come and just have a good time. It?s basically a light and entertaining ride through the city.?

 Even for cameraman Anil Chandel, who?s worked on films like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Naach, Calcutta is a new city. ?We are trying to capture how the city has evolved with time and how it?s no longer just an old city with heritage buildings but also has a happening life to boot,? says Chandel.

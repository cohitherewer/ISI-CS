 It?s not about the novelty factor, footfall, size or grandeur. The objective of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, presented in association with HCL Beanstalk, is to provide a platform where following the rules with the aim of safety, cleanliness and community spirit is the priority. So, the prize money has to be used by the winning Puja committee for a social project in its area.

 The number of participating pujas is more than 130, up from 115 in 2004. The event this year is supported by Calcutta Police, West Bengal Fire Services, the NGO Concern for Calcutta and Power FM.

 ?It adds value to the Pujas? is how True Spirit was described by a spokesperson for CESC, which has been associated with the event since its inception in 2003. ?We are hopeful that it will become a part and parcel of Puja celebrations in Calcutta in times to come, because it makes people conscious of the facilities and environment, and adds an angle of community care,? he added.

 The must-have list for the participating puja organisers includes fire, waste and traffic and crowd management, safe source of electricity, first aid counter and no forced subscriptions. There are bonus points for non-usage of plastic, eco-friendliness, a help desk, emergency lighting, public toilets, drinking water and an effort to avoid sound pollution. 

 ?It?s a good way to promote various safeguards that a community puja should have,? said Concern For Calcutta president T.K. Gooptu. ?Safety and security are important when large masses of people visit a puja pandal.?

 The teams of judges with representatives from the sponsors and partners of the True Spirit Puja event will visit the participating puja pandals, divided into eight zones in Calcutta and parts of Howrah, on October 8 and 9. Six top Pujas will be shortlisted based on the scores by the judges over the two days, which will be visited by three celebrities on Saptami. Based on the feedback from the judges, the top pujas will be rated (Two Star, Three Star, Four Star, Five Star). The Puja with the highest scores and best feedback will be nominated as the Model Puja. Three celebrities will pass the final judgement.

 ?From our point of view, it is important to check the safety measures taken to prevent untoward incidents,? explained Asit Sarkar of the fire department. ?But awareness is equally important. For instance, depending on the location, type of construction, etc, the appropriate precautions must be taken. You don?t have to go over the top.?

 For first-time partner Power FM, it was ?concern for the city? and the ?chance to make a difference? that mattered, according to Partho Majumdar.

 As Prashant Prakash of HCL Beanstalk put it: ?The event is in the true spirit of the Pujas, keeping in mind the safety and security aspects. It will help people be more disciplined and should lead to better Pujas in the future.?

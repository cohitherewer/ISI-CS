 Breach in pipe leaves city dry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Indian bowlers at the Eden Gardens were not the only ones going dry in the mouth on Thursday.

 About three million people in north and south Calcutta faced a severe water shortage since morning, after a 60-inch dedicated water mains connecting the Tallah pumping station and the Auckland Square booster pumping station burst near Mullickbazar.

 The dedicated water mains running under APC Road and AJC Bose Road is the lifeline for the filtered water distribution system in the city.

 Cossipore, Chitpur, Paikpara, Bagbazar, Shyambazar and Sovabazar in north Calcutta, the central business district of BBD Bag-Esplanade and south Calcutta areas like Bhowanipore, Chetla, Tollygunge, Lake Gardens and Gariahat went without filtered water from 10 am on Thursday.

 Mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee said it would take time to repair the breach and water supply would not be restored before Friday morning, at the earliest.

The breach occurred around 3.30 am at Mullickbazar, 

in front of 184, AJC Bose Road, and the stretch was flooded in a flash.

 Civic engineers, wading through knee-deep water, struggled to detect the breach. They shut down the Tallah station that supplies water to north Calcutta, and the Auckland Square station that supplies to south Calcutta.

 Traffic, too, was disrupted by the breach in the water mains. The chaos at Mullickbazar spread to the adjoining areas during rush hour. ?With all south-bound traffic from Sealdah to Park Circus passing through a single lane, it was tough,? said a traffic sergeant struggling to restore order.

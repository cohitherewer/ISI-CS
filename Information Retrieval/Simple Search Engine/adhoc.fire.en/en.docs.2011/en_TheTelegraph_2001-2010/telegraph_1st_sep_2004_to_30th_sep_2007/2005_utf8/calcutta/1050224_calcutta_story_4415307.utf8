 The superstore craze started in south Calcutta a few years ago and since then has spread like wildfire to all parts of the city. The latest area to be affected by the rage is central Calcutta, which recently got its first department store.

 Called Natural Essentials, this sprawling 8,000 sq ft air-conditioned store at Poddar Court offers a total shopping experience by housing everything from grocery, stationery, gifts and clothes under one roof. 

 ?Providing roti, kapda aur makaan under one roof is our motto. We have the regular grocery, stationery and gift sections like any other department store. But what distinguishes us is a real-estate section where people can get to know about the various housing complexes developed by the Natural Group and also book apartments,? says Mukesh Sharma, proprietor of the Natural Group that owns the store.

 Apart from a stop to shop for household essentials, Natural Essentials boasts an extensive home d?cor section. Here one can pick up anything from cushions and linen to showpieces.

 If men usually feel left out in the scheme of shopping, they have been given special attention here with an exclusive Reid and Taylor corner. 

 ?We are planning to open a second branch of Natural Essentials in Gariahat soon,? shares Sharma.

 Mess masala

 Eden Pavilion, the bustling 24-hour restaurant at ITC Sonar Bangla is hosting a special food festival dedicated to the armed forces of the country. The effort is essentially to salute the contribution of the men in uniform to their motherland.

 ?This is a nationwide exercise and takes place in all ITC five-star properties at around the same time,? says a spokesperson for the Bypass hotel.

 The two-year-old festival has became a hit among the forces as well as the civilian clientele of the hotel.

 The menu, available in the buffet, has a range of items inherent to the armed forces Officers Mess across the country. Thus, while you can dig into Madras Fish Curry from the Madras regiment, Keema Kaleji, a speciality of the Mahar regiment is also on offer.

 Try a host of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes that have been picked up from anywhere between Akash ? The Air Force Officers Mess in New Delhi to the NDA training institute mess. Recipes from the World War II era have also been included. 

 The yummy Indian and Continental delights are available both for lunch and dinner for Rs 650 per person, plus taxes.

 And for the men in uniform, there is a direct discount of 30 per cent on the bill. 

 Sleep comfort

 Naughty Nightwear, an exclusive lingerie outlet at Vardaan Market, has launched its latest collection titled More Naughty. 

 ?People are becoming more and more experimental, thus the theme,? says Manoj Khem, store owner. ?So the palette is bold and bright, instead of soft, pastel shades.?

 The colour card is a little over-the-top with sunset orange, Brazilian yellow, blazing red, electric blue, maroon and purple dominating the collection. 

 Popular combinations include halter-tops with matching hot pants, spaghetti straps and strapless tops with capris. 

 Prints get bolder as well with checks and polka dots predominating. The fabric is mostly satin, chiffon, lycra, Chinese silk or a combination of these. Frills, laces and other embellishments complete the luxurious look.

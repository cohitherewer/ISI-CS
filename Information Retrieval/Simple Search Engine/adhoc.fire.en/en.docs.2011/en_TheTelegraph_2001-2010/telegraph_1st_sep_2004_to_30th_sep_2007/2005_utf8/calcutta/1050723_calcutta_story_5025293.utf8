Twisted tale: Dialogue, an interactive forum launched by Oxford 

Bookstore for theatre lovers in the city, presented a performance of Gopon Kothati 

on Thursday evening. The Bengali comedy with a twist in the tale was staged by 

Theatre Spandan. Written by Chandan Sen, it is a story of a rich man who advertises 

for suitors for his daughter. However, there is a surprise ending, which unfolds 

in a hilarious manner. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 The many facets of Shakespeare?s Macbeth, explored through references to characters in Indian mythology like Putana and Shakti, in an effort to understand what femininity or being defeminised means. But that?s not the only unique aspect of Crossings.

 Directed by Vikram Iyengar, the drama weaves together kathak, Bharatanatyam and Manipuri, along with a text-based performance. Iyengar?s group Ranan staged the show last month in Castle Theatre, Aberystwyth, Wales. Invited by the Centre for Performance Research, the seven-member group ? including a vocalist and a percussionist ? received a ?very very good? response.

 The team that travelled to the UK comprised Debashree Bhattacharya, Archana Ramaswamy, Suman Sarawgi and Anubha Fatehpuria, along with percussionist Nagin Tanvir and musician Siddhartha Bhattacharya.

 After the performance on June 28, the first production for the recently-formed group, was a six-day workshop conducted by Iyengar and his team. The Summer Shift programme introduced the participants to kathak, Bharatanatyam and Manipuri, with interactive sessions on Indian performance aesthetics focusing on the theory of rasa, the concept of cyclical rhythm in Indian music and Ranan?s brand of dance-theatre. 

 ?Our company is young, so are we, with the average age of 30. Even the participants at the workshop were young, so the interactions were on a very different level,? says Iyengar. ?We offered a glimpse into a very wide range of art forms, all Indian. The idea was to de-mystify Indian culture.?

French philosopher, dramatist, novelist and critic 

Jean-Paul Sartre?s play No Exit (Huis Clos) explores the conflicting 

relationships that develop among three recently-dead strangers in hell. In the 

process, Sartre also offers a glimpse of his exceptional vision of hell and the 

world as seen from hell. Hell, according to him, is like a hotel where the dead 

are allotted different rooms. 

 This particular room consists of three sofas, a fireplace, a bronze atrocity, an ordinary paper knife and an eccentric bell. The play features four characters ? the three dead occupants of the room (Joseph Garcin, Inez Serrano and Estelle Rigault) and a valet.

 Theatrecian presents the No Exit as a celebration of the birth centenary of the playwright and philosopher. The play is directed by Tathagata Singha and the cast comprises Bornila Chatterjee, Ronjini Chakrabarty, Soumyak Kanti De Biswas and Tanaji Dasgupta. Catch it at Gyan Manch on July 25, at 7 pm.

 Ganakrishti Natya Utsab, the annual theatre festival, is being held between July 22 and 27 in venues like Academy of Fine Arts, Sisir Mancha and Rabindra Sadan. Besides performances by theatre groups from Calcutta and other parts of the country, eminent personalities like Mallika Sarabhai, Bibhash Chakraborty, Shuvaprasanna and Kedarnath Singh will also be felicitated during the festival. Groups from outside the city include Damama from Siliguri, Rwitwik from Behrampore and Rupkatha from Allahabad.

 Revolt of Women (Pratibadi Nari) is the theme for a performance by a group of women mime artistes at Sisir Mancha on July 27, at 7 pm. Through the ?silent protest of women for human rights in the field of mime? project, Subhra Sanyal, a mime artiste, has put together a series of shows on the issue, inspired by the works of the Progressive Women?s Organisation.

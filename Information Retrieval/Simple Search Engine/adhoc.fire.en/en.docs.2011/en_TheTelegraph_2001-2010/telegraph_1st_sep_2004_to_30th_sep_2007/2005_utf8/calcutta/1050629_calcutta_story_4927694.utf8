The confrontation in student agitation is non-antagonistic. The situation reaches a point of no return only when the administration clings to an ego of seniority and forgets the false sense of prestige that is characteristic of youth. Students usually take to agitational routes to improve the system. When they protest on political issues, like we supported the Vietnam cause, it affects things barely for one or two days. I am all for students? voice in the running of the institution. We had even intervened in the syllabus.

Mercilessly beating up teachers and officials, hurling unspeakable abuses or forcibly confining people for prolonged periods cannot be condoned.

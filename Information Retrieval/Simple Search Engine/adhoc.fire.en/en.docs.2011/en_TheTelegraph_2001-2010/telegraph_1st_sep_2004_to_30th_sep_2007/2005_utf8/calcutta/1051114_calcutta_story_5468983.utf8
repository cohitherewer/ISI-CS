 Empowering our children

 Supported by UNICEF, Prayasam formed Voices for Children: Students? Council early this year, a forum for the expression of students? perceptions on a variety of issues affecting them. Operating in 60 educational institutions in the northern fringes of the city, the Council studies current policies related to quality of education and special protection including HIV/AIDS prevention and child trafficking in the state, with reference to allied child policies of various state government departments. To mark International Child Rights Week, the Council is hosting a series of programmes to capacitate Council representatives to engage in interactive sessions with key policy-makers and concerned government officials on issues related to children. Starting today, six day-long workshops on poster and slogan writing, skit and role playing, elocution, ex-tempore speaking and JAM sessions will be held for three days in Belghoria, Baguihati, Bongaon and Barrackpore. Participated by Council representatives, the workshops will be conducted by distinguished resource persons from respective fields. On November 17 and 18, they will put to test the skills they gained over the last three days, in direct discussions with the chief minister and education officials at Writers? Buildings, Swasthya Bhawan and at Purbashree, EZCC, Salt Lake. The week-long programme culminates on November 19 with a silent rally by students and facilitators at Barasat, originating at Barasat Government Girls? High School and terminating at the Kachhari Maidan.

 Tears wash the eyes that saw murder

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Hearing her mother scream, 12-year-old Anushree clutched her little brother Avijit?s arm and rushed to the room, to find their father standing in front of their mother?s blood-splattered body. A shard of glass was in his hands, blood dripping from it. ?Baba, ki korle (Father, what have you done)?? cried out eight-year-old Avijit. Anushree was too numbed to utter anything.

 A day after Amit Das killed wife Shukla in a fit of rage, before taking his own life, in Regent Park on Saturday, the children were still trembling with fear and shock.

 Shukla?s mother Gouri Mitra, who is now tending to Avijit and Anushree, said the two could neither eat nor sleep. ?Since yesterday, both brother and sister have been weeping. I don?t know what lies in store for them,? she lamented.

 Avijit keeps asking his grandmother: ?No doubt my father had killed my mother, but why did he commit suicide and didn?t think about us??

 Doctors examined the children and concluded that the two would take a long time to recover from the trauma. ?The scar seems to be indelible. They will never forget the horrific chain of events. What they need now to get over the depression, which can turn fatal, are love and affection,? said psychiatrist Ranadip Ghosh Roy.

 On Saturday morning, Amit, a small-time trader, broke a glass bottle and used a shard to slash the throat of his wife. He then fled and jumped into a pond in Bishnupur. ?We were then waiting for breakfast and expecting our mother to join us,? said Anushree.

 Gouri recalled that her son-in-law tortured her daughter at times, but not once did she imagine that he could be so brutal.

 ?There is no one to look after the children. I have three daughters and all of them are married. My husband and I are both cardiac patients,? she sighed.

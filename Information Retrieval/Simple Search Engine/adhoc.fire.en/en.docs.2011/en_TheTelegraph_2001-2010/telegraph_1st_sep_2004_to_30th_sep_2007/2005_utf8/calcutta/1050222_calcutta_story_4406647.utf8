 Md Asif Dar had never stepped outside his village in Kashmir?s Kupwara district, in all his 12 years, till last week. For most of his young life, he has seen violence, often bloody. 

 The youngest of two brothers and a sister, the Al Fayaz Public School student lives with his family, headed by his mother, in a village in the border area ? a region struck by conflict for half a century. 

 On Sunday, Asif arrived in Calcutta from Kashmir, one of about 30 schoolchildren from Kupwara stepping outside its boundaries for the first time in their lives. 

 Operation Sadbhavana is an initiative of the army, taking children from the border areas in the troubled regions of Jammu and Kashmir and sending them around the country. The aim is to show them an India where there is peace and stability.

 Started about three-and-a-half years ago, this was the second group of children ? from over 10 different schools in Kupwara ? to arrive in Calcutta. On Tuesday, they leave for Puri and Bhubaneswar as part of the eastern India experience. 

 ?These children, being from the border areas, have seen a lot violence. Now there is peace in Kupwara, but it used to be bad. Some of them have never even been to Jammu or Srinagar, or even seen a train, apart from in pictures. It is a wonderful experience for them,? said Manmeet Kour Sodhi, one of the teachers accompanying the children on the trip.

 On Sunday, the youngsters were taken to Eden Gardens as part of their sightseeing tour. That was the best thing as far as Rohini and Basharat were concerned. For the two cricket players, it was a dream come true. ?Bahut achha laga (we loved it),? the girls smiled shyly. So far, the trip has been an eye-opener and Calcutta has been a window to the outside world for them. And they?re enjoying every minute of it.

 On Monday morning, the group visited Fort William, where they were greeted by Major-General Z.U. Shah, general officer commanding, Bengal area, and Lieutenant-General C.B. Vijan, chief of staff, Eastern Command. 

 The young boys and girls were a little awed by the officers, but then one of them stepped forward and announced he wanted to be an army officer some day. 

 That broke the ice and had the entourage of sombre armymen laughing and chatting indulgently with the youth brigade.

 ?We do this kind of thing with children from border areas, even in places like Himachal Pradesh,? explained Lieutenant-General Vijan. ?It is to get these children to see mainstream India, through big cities like Calcutta and Delhi. To show them the developments in other parts of the country.?

 The youngsters are happy just to be able to travel to a different place. It?s an experience they won?t forget.

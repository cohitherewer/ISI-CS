The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Wetlands units set off probe clamour 

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The pollution control board will initiate a probe to ascertain the extent of encroachment upon the East Calcutta Wetlands, declared a no-development zone by the high court a decade ago.

 ?We have gone through the report (published in Metro on April 6) and have decided to undertake a detailed stock of the situation,? said board chairman Sudip Banerjee.

 The report had detailed how a clutch of private promoters have opened shop on the wetlands, off EM Bypass and just behind Energy Education Park. Some of them have also filled up a few ponds in the area.

 Earlier, the board had ordered three commercial units ? Mohon Udyog, Mohon Motors and Bothra Automotives ? ?to cease their activities? by May, as they were found to be ?operating in the East Calcutta Wetland areas, flouting an order of Calcutta High Court?.

 The encroachments have brought under the scanner the government and the civic body as well. A representative of one of the units operating from the region claimed: ?We are not doing anything illegal. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has regularised our premises against a hefty fee. Many of us also have trade licences.?

 The civic body?s director-general (building), Asok Roychowdhury, admitted that ?some regularisations have been done in the area?, but he was not sure about the details. Asked how any structure could be regularised in a zone where all development activities have been banned by the high court, Roychowdhury would only say: ?The hearing officer must have his reasons.?

 Interestingly, the special officer (building) did not even mention the high court order while clearing Bothra?s construction in August 2003. 

 At this rate, an environment activist commented, the civic body would one day regularise an illegal structure on the Maidan or the Victoria Memorial compound.

 Sources said that on receiving specific complaints two years ago, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had formed a committee to look into the matter. 

 Following the panel?s recommendations, the authorities had even sent notices to the errant promoters, asking them to produce documents relating to their premises on the wetlands. Neither did the firms comply, nor did the civic body pursue the matter. 

 Environmentalist Subhas Dutta blames the environment department for this state of affairs. ?The encroachments could have been pre-empted if the department had acted fast on the wetlands management plan. The pollution control board should ensure that its order is carried out.?

 A senior civic official said Institute of Wetlands Management and Ecological Design, a nodal agency of the environment department, should have detected the encroachments much earlier, while preparing an ?inch-by-inch map of the wetlands?.

 Classes, not cosmetics

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government on Monday made it clear to the management of Bonhooghly Girls? High School at Baranagar that each school is expected to handle on its own non-academic issues, such as allowing or disallowing teachers to wear make-up.

 ?The government definitely expects teachers working in state-aided schools to behave in a manner that does not give the institution a bad name,? asserted state school education minister Kanti Biswas on Monday. ?But it is up to the schools themselves to settle the kind of dispute that rocked the Baranagar school last week,? he added.

 Thereby, the government wanted to remind the thousands of state-aided institutions, such as the one in Baranagar, that they should lay greater stress on the guidelines concerning administrative functioning.

 Last month, four teachers of the school had refused to follow a diktat barring them from wearing lipstick and kajal and carrying mobiles to class.

 Officials in the education department said state-aided schools will soon be asked to focus on academic issues, instead of wasting time on matters that may distract students.

 ?We have never heard of teachers dressing up for class. The schools should lay more emphasis on checking whether or not the teachers are punctual, attending school regularly, taking the classes allotted to them and covering the entire syllabus before the stipulated period,? an official added. 

 The government will intervene promptly if it receives complaints that a teacher is not obeying these rules.

 Getting an indication of the government?s stand, the authorities of Bonhooghly Girls? High School on Monday avoided initiating a discussion on last week?s developments at the institution?s teachers? council meeting on Monday. The developments were one of the main items on the agenda. 

 ?I don?t want to speak on this issue any further,? Tapati Dutta, school headmistress, said after the meeting. 

 The teachers expressed satisfaction that the dress-down controversy had been finally set to rest.

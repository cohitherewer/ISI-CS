 Aspirin or antiseptic, glucometer or pacemaker, hepatitis seminar or spa treatment ? all you ever needed to take care of yourself should now be available under one roof.

 Calcutta?s first ?medical mall? is opening on Elgin Road on Friday. Alpha Family Medical Mall is a one-stop centre with a polyclinic, healthcare store, diagnostic centre offering basic pathological tests, healthcare spa and cafeteria.

 The four-floor property has been developed at an estimated cost of Rs 10 crore. ?For years, I have been working on this concept, as there is no place in Calcutta where you can meet all your healthcare requirements,? explained paediatrician Vijay Kejriwal, the man behind the mall, who also has a small hospital in Howrah.

 Alpha is gearing up for a soft launch on Friday, and is expected to be running in full swing in two months. The healthcare showroom will have a wide array of medicines, as well as products like vaccines (hepatitis, meningitis, small pox), orthopaedic aids and insulin pens.

 While patients usually cannot shop around for items like pacemakers, at Alpha, they have that option. ?A consumer often doesn?t get to see a pacemaker before implant. But here, we will have every single gadget you might need in our showroom,? explained Kejriwal.

 The healthcare hub will have windows to address concerns on asthma, diabetes, hypertension and childcare, where trained counsellors will impart information about the ailments, prognosis and medication, under the watchful eyes of doctors.

 The diagnostic centre will be equipped for tests like X-ray, TMT, halter monitoring and colour Doppler, with machines imported from Germany, Japan and the US.

 A polyclinic will also be on hand with multi-speciality doctors in attendance, a 15-bed day-care centre equipped with operating theatre for keyhole and vascular surgery, an integrated anaesthetic machine and in-built ventilators.

 Finally, a special cafeteria will dish out a wide variety and the rooftop will serve as a venue for health awareness campaigns and seminars every week.

 Straight lines, subtle curves and rich textures ? thats where the beauty of the furniture at Interiors Espania lies. Dealing in an exclusive line of furniture imported from Spain, this plush store at 74, Shakespeare Sarani, houses a treasure trove for home interiors.

 Straight line furniture is now in fashion in Europe. Linear patterns look sleek and classy and are suitable for modern apartments with limited space. They are also easy to maintain, explains Vikram Arora, proprietor of the store. 

 Bed beauties

 Luxury is the keyword in the line of beds at Interiors Espania and, surprisingly, the bigger the better is the mantra here. A bed should be luxurious and big on the one hand and simple and elegant on the other. So even when smaller flats are mushrooming all over the city, kingsize beds are still very popular for master bedrooms, observes Arora, an interior designer by profession. 

 The complete bedroom sets at the store comprise the bed, side tables, wardrobe, chests, drawers and a dresser. 

 There are three different collections to choose from ? Classic, offering a retro look with bends and mouldings, Contemporary with linear designs, and a line of dark chocolate brown furniture called Wenge.

 Not just furniture, co-ordinated linen and furnishings displayed in home style add to the whole effect. Bedsheets from Shades of India come in soothing white, embellished sober prints. 

 Blankets in bright splashes are a good pick if you want to add colour to your bedroom.

 Sofa style

 Sheer luxury is the name of the game in the living room furniture section, with stuff from reputed international brands.

 Avant garde designs of sofa sets from the house of Italian furniture major Somaschini is a high point of the living room collection. The wood-and-steel construction, topped with Dupont Dacron, make the sofas extremely durable, claims Arora.

 The back cushions padded with goose feathers are non-allergic and add to the comfort. From vibrant shades of red, orange and green to muted blues and pastels, the choice of colour in leather and other interesting fabrics is extensive. 

 Also on offer are sofa sets from the Classic and Contemporary lines. Another show stealer in this section is a range of comfortable chaise lounges. 

 To jazz up your living room further, there are interesting leather centre tables in brown and black. They come in pure wood or a combination of glass and wood. Apart from the usual square, rectangular and round side tables, there is a unique range of egg-shaped ones.

 Table talk

 The dining table sets come in arrangements of four or six-seaters. Here again you can choose from the Classic and Wenge collections. 

 The Classic collection in light brown boasts tables in round and semi-circular shapes, while the Wenge, in dark chocolate brown, offers square and rectangular ones. 

 Buffet hutches, to stock your cutlery, come with the Classic collection. The section also houses some elegant imported crockery.

 Light lustre

 Complete home solutions is what Interiors Espania seeks to offer and hence the collection doesnt stop at furniture only. A wide range of lights and shades in steel and fabric catches the eye.

 There are lights in all shapes and sizes ? ceiling lights, suspensions, wall light, floor lights and table lights ? from reputed European designers like Jorge Pensi.

 The designs are sleek and the fabric is mostly white, which is absolutely essential for proper lighting, says Arora.

 Office space

 The store is also home to some elegant office furniture that are smart, sleek, yet comfortable. 

 Executive chairs, tables, desks and cabinets with ample storage space define the line of utility furniture.

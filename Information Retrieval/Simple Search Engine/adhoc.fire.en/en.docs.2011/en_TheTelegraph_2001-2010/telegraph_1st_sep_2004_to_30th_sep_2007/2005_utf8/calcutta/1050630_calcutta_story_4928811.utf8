 A saga of progress

 As part of the ongoing annual festival of plays, Hutch Odeon 2005, Theatre Spandan presents Shabdogaon, a street play with a social message. Set against the surroundings of a backward, remote village called Shabdogaon in Gaya, Bihar, it is a moving, gripping narrative of two young social workers, Mahesh and Sarita, who are committed to improving the lot of its poverty-ridden people. The two protagonists initiate development programmes in the neglected, forgotten village and try to educate and uplift its illiterate, exploited inhabitants. Led by Mahesh and Sarita?s heroic efforts to fight for the progress of the community, the villagers are also inspired to strive for a better life. Tragedy suddenly strikes when the two are murdered, leaving the people of Shabdogaon shocked and shattered. However, in their death, the two young people ultimately emerge triumphant, as their dreams, hopes and aspirations continue to live in the minds of the villagers, specially among the younger generation. Direction: Saurav Gupta.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Shabdogaon, presented by Theatre Spandan

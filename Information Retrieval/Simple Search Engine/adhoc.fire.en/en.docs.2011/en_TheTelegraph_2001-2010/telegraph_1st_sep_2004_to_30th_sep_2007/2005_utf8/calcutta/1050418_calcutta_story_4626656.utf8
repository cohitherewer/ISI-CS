 Items into ideas

 Patta patta daali daali sab yeh kare sawaal: Will the awesome twosome be able to turn on the Chaiyya chaiyya magic again? If the promos of Kaal are anything to go by, it?s dhamaal time all right and the electric chemistry between the two is as much about the charisma of Madame Malaika as it is about the charms of King Khan. 

 ?It was d?j? vu,? recalled Malaika sitting in her room at the Golden Park hotel on Saturday night. ?The Kaal shoot reminded me of all the fun we had atop the train seven years back in Dil Se. It was great to be back with Shah Rukh. It was like ? can we do it one more time? Guess we have.?

 In town for a jig at the hotel?s restobar Fusion, Malaika was all excited about the item number, which will roll with the credits for the Shah Rukh-Karan Johar production. ?It?s great packaging,? she said. ?Initially the song was never on the cards. Then, Karan asked me to do it. I realised there was a certain amount of public interest involved with us returning after Chaiyya chaiyya. And we went ahead and had a blast.?

 On asked about how she has changed in these seven years, it was time for some candid confessions. ?Honestly, I have become a better dancer now. I was all too new then. Also, the comfort level between Shah Rukh and me has got better, making things easier,? revealed Malaika.

 No wonder the Fusion crowd went berserk watching the famous waist swivel in delight to Kaal dhamaal. Unlike many other known faces which have made fleeting appearances at the same venue recently, Malaika did boogie with the crowd to the beats of chartbusters ? Mahi ve to Makhna ve.

 But Mrs Arbaaz Khan ain?t ready to be called the ultimate item girl. ?It?s not like every girl needs my stamp of approval to do an item number. I enjoy doing item songs and I guess, that shows. But I can do a full-fledged film role in exchange for an item number,? observes the lady who prefers to spend maximum time with kid son Arhaan these days.

 And a full-length film is something she wants to do. Not in Bollywood though. ?I would really like to do a regional film. I know every star in Mumbai is doing Bengali films these days but if I have to do a regional movie, I will do it in my mother tongue, which is Malayali. You know, the best of Bollywood are remakes of south Indian hits.?

 Before Malaika goes Malayali, she has a bigger project in hand, though. The fashion expert on the small screen plans to launch her own clothing line by the end of the year. ?Loads of marketing strategies will come in,? she said. ?I want to take my brand name to the next level. My association with the fashion world should help matters. Not all clothes will be designed by me but they will be very wearable and reflect my own flair and my own style. I?ll start of with just a women?s line, and get into men?s clothing at a later stage.?

 And guess who?s inspired the Scorpio to get into couture culture? ?It?s a global phenomenon. Everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Britney Spears to Beyonce Knowles is taking their brand names to another level with their clothing houses. So it should work here too,? she signed off.

 Crossover art

 Transmigrations: Myth, Memory and Make Believe, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, sculptures and metal work, makes a unique endeavour that seeks to explore common terrain and thus bridge the gap between traditional and contemporary art. In a workshop organised by CIMA, seven traditional and seven contemporary artists worked in pairs, combining their individual skills, techniques, ideas and practices. In the process, they gave birth to an entirely new form of artistic expression, in which the collaborative effort of each individual has contributed to the larger whole. Interestingly, although the encounter between tradition and contemporaneity is assumed to be fraught with tension, on final analysis, the boundaries between the two are perceived as more imaginary than real, so that migrations and crossings-over appear to take place freely and naturally. Participating artists include Manas Acharya, Swarna Kumari, Hiran Mitra, Pranab Bhaskar, Gopinath Roy, Shankar Das and Bimal Kundu.

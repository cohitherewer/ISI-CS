With just about every hair studio trying to dictate hair colour trends in the city, the latest to join the fun is Chrysalis, a hair salon on Ballygunge Circular Road.

 On Tuesday, half-a-dozen city models got a hair makeover with what is being touted by this salon as the in colours of the season. Thus khaki, iceberg and saffron took over the ruling reds and browns, with hairdressers getting busy with different techniques to highlight the cool colours. We have used lighter colours in the inner layers and dark shades on the top so that with a proper haircut, the inside layers are also highlighted well, said one of the hair experts.

 Though Calcutta is apparently still sold on red and blonde, its these new colours with a mahogany-to-violet colourscape that are billed to do well. Most people want blondes, but there are more options available now, add stylists.

 A range of hair colouring and massage packages are available at the salon between Rs 350 and Rs 800

 Art aid

 India Foundation for the Arts ? the first independent and professionally managed organisation in the country that extends financial help to artists and aids the cause of art ? has just introduced two new programmes called Extending Arts Practice and New Performance.

 There are a lot of grantees of IFA in eastern India and these two additions should increase the number of grantees here, since Calcutta and its adjoining areas have a lot of talented artists in various fields, says Anmol Vellani, executive director of the foundation.

 The first programme will support exciting projects in the field of arts undertaken by individual artists or groups. Artists experimenting with untried forms, exchange and collaboration, new material or fresh styles will be given preference. The second programme is meant for new finds. 

 We want to commission innovative productions in theatre, music, dance or other forms of performance art that use new media in innovative and relevant ways. Addressing subjects, both historical and contemporary, that have not been explored widely in performance as yet is another area we are looking at, adds Vellani. 

 The effort is also geared towards assisting corporate organisations who want to extend help in finding hidden talent. The corporate attention is tilted towards urban, elitist art most of the time. In the process, vernacular arts suffer due to misguided opinion about rural art forms. We want to help change the mindset, signs off Vellani.

 Dazzling diamonds

 A jewellery line exclusively created for teenagers and designer label lovers has been launched at Vanshi, on AJC Bose Road. Both collections offer over 60 designs in earrings, bracelets, necklaces, pendants, brooches and rings. While the teen range is filled with modern appeal, the designer range is more stylised in technique and dimension. 

 Priced between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000, the teen collection targets school-going youngsters. With over 30 designs, it is for those who acknowledge branded diamond jewellery as an affordable fashion accessory, said Dharmesh Vaghashia, managing director of Vanshi Diamond Jewellery . The new collection will also be available at its 25 franchisee outlets.

 Vaghashia added that the brand has a unique buy-back policy, wherein customers can claim 90 per cent of the price. Also, an exchange policy offers buyers the option of exchanging their item at 95 per cent of the price, within 15 days of the date of sale. The non-branded range of diamond jewellery is priced between Rs 35,000 and Rs 5 lakh. 

 Teen trinkets

 Its merely a happy coincidence that Jassi will get married on Friday and a wedding line of jewellery by Indian Gem and Jewellery, whose brand ambassador is Mona Singh, was launched today. The Shagun line, however, was unveiled not by Singh but by city models Tanusree and Priyanka Pal on Wednesday at their showroom in Vardaan market. 

 Like Jassi, whose glamorous persona hasnt changed her simplicity, the line is affordable. The collection itself reflects an attitude that is simple, yet very elegant, says owner Vijay Panjiar. 

 The collection has a combination of gold and diamond ornaments in various forms, be it modern stylised droplets and chandelier earrings or traditional kundan jadau sets. Prices start at Rs 1,800.

 Whats more, the store has introduced an offer of no making charge on the export surplus diamond jewellery, in a festival titled Diamond Utsav. 

 The festival will continue till the end of the month.

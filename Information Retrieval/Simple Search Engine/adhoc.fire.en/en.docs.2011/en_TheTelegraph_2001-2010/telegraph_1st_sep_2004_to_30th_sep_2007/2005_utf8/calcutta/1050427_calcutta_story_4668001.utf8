The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Taslima Nasreen, author

 When a calendar is not followed anymore in day-to-day life, its appeal is bound to diminish. Yet the celebrations surrounding Nava Varsha in Bangladesh far outdo what happens here. Rallies are brought out all across the country, comprising traditionally attired people and life-size paper elephants and horses, moved by men inside the structures. Handicraft fairs and folk music abound. If the celebrations are on the downswing, the reason is because the next generation is not interested in Bengali rituals. That story is the same on both sides of the border.

The proportion between calendars sold in the Nava Varsha and the New Year is around 65:35. But it is a changing scenario. Ten years ago, when I entered the trade it was 75:25.

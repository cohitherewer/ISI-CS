 ?No more loud reaction?

 After a career course correction, NEHA DHUPIA tells Pratim D. Gupta that she likes it best when audiences take her seriously

 Neha Dhupia in moments from Siskiyaan

 What?s Neha Dhupia doing in a film like Siskiyaan?

 Well, I took up the film because I was offered it. It was gracious enough on the part of director Ashwini Chaudhary and producer Guddu Dhanoa to offer me a role like this. In fact, I used to think during the shooting of the film, ?Why was it offered to me?? But then it couldn?t have come at a better time, since I too was looking for a change of image.

 But the offer came when you were doing another of those sleaze films, Sheesha?

 Yes. It was being produced by Gudduji too. Siskiyaan had this great script. Also, I had seen Ashwini Chaudhary?s first film, Dhoop, and he had done a fabulous job. The very opportunity of working with great technicians like him was enough for me to do the film.

 You look all fired up in the promos?

 The film is set in post-Godhra Gujarat where the relationship between Hindus and Muslims had soured. I play Ayesha Sheikh, a journalist who had been raped in the riots. The film takes off when this man comes to her home one night and she is convinced that he is the rapist.

 Did you do any particular homework to play a journalist?

 Not at all. There are no scenes in the film where I have to carry out the job of a journalist. The profession was chosen to show somebody who is strong enough to fight her case. The premise of the film is such that the woman had to be either from the army or be a journalist. Had she been shown as a housewife, she wouldn?t have looked convincing enough to fight back.

 How different was it playing a deglamourised heroine as opposed to a Julie?

 The experience is more or less the same ? you have to work as hard for every role. And most of my movies ? Julie, Sheesha and now, Siskiyaan ? have been women-oriented films. So it?s kind of doing the same thing. And I am very pleased to play a deglamourised character. If you have belief in your own thing and if you have belief in your director, it?s not that big a deal.

 You have also acted with a powerful performer like Sachin Khedekar?

 Sachin has been my friend, philosopher and guide on the sets. I am really lucky that we got along so well. He has been very, very helpful. And if you like my performance in the film, he is definitely one of the reasons for it. 

 What kind of a response are you expecting from the janta used to seeing you as a sex symbol?

 I have already got a great response till now. Thankfully people have realised that I am heading towards a different direction in cinema. There has been no loud reaction this time from the audience. More of serious looks? I am delighted.

 What?s next on the Neha roster?

 There?s a comic thriller called Ek Chalis Ki Last Local. Then there?s a Priyadarshan social comedy with UTV. I also have a delightful cameo in Garam Masala. And, of course, I have the item number in the Pakistani film.

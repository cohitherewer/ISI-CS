The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Startling contrasts, yet work gets done

 Steve Waugh?s tryst with Udayan is well-documented and his recent pitch for a cricket township has propelled his stock further in the city.

 Fellow Australian Pat Cash hasn?t had the spotlight trained on him quite like that. Yet, the 1987 Wimbledon champion manages to raise in excess of ?100,000 in the UK every year, the lion?s share of which goes towards bettering the lot of Calcutta?s streetchildren. 

 ?Yes, I have been doing this fund-raising routine quietly for the past 15 years, mostly in London, through events like corporate dinners, fun runs and golf days. I do this for my dear friend John (O?Shea), whose agency (GOAL) works with deprived kids in Calcutta alongside CINI-Asha,? Cash told Metro. 

 On this, his third visit to the city, which now enjoys a special bond with the serve-and-volley maestro-turned-coach, tennis commitments kept Cash on court for three days on the trot, as he did basic drills with Bengal Tennis Association (BTA) trainees in Salt Lake. Drained by the scorching May heat, he still took time out on Thursday to be with the underprivileged children.

 ?It?s an amazing city with startling contrasts, and in all the madness, it works,? observed Cash. ?I have had a very fruitful dialogue with BTA and short of setting up an academy here, we will do all we can to add value to the system here,? promised the man who runs the Pat Cash Tennis Academy back home on Hope Island, Queensland.

 Constant, supervised, world-class coaching is what the Cash clinic will provide, with experts flying down to Calcutta every two-three months. ?It?s extremely important to upgrade the coaches? education as well, and while I aim to come down once a year, my technical coach Brad Langevad is also likely to work with the kids and coaches in Calcutta,? Cash said.

 Confirming the tie-up with the Cash academy, BTA secretary Hironmoy Chatterjee said: ?We have been asked to represent the Pat Cash Tennis Academy in India and we are working on a sustainable exchange programme.? 

 On the other hand, tennis kids from Calcutta will be offered ?special treatment? on Hope Island, with their studies taken care of by the International School on the Gold Coast.

 There are various customised programmes at the Queensland clinic, with a weeklong stint starting at $ 700 (Australian) ? Cash recommends a two-year tenure for 11 to 12-year-old children. The academy can be reached at www.hir.com.au or academybigpond.com.au.

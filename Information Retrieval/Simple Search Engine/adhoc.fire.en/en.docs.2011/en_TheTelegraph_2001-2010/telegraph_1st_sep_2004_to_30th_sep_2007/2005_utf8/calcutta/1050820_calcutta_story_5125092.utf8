The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Dum Dum underpass is not even a year old, but has already been rendered almost unusable by persistent dripping of water from behind an electrical wire-box at the station-end. The same end of the passage for light vehicles is similarly afflicted. Even when there is no rain, Metro Rail passengers have to negotiate puddles on the already narrow footpath. Women and children, especially, are inconvenienced, and almost everyone is delayed. The underpass was meant to provide comfortable access to the stations; it has only posed a new hurdle for the harried passengers.

 There is an upward revision in dearness allowance for serving employees and dearness relief for pensioners every six months. However, the enhancement invariably comes into effect after two to three months from the date of announcement by the Centre. Due to this administrative delay, pensioners lose out on a sizeable sum of interest. We pensioners would appreciate it if the revised rate is made effective as soon as possible. Sometimes, even after receiving the list of eligible pensioners, the post office holds back the raise for another month. As the pensioners are not represented by an organised body they are unable to voice their problems. They are forever at the receiving end and suffer monetary losses, thanks to the unsympathetic and inefficient workforce in many post offices.

 Every morning, on my way to St Xavier?s College, I come upon people walking their dogs on the pavements of Park Street. Most of the pet-owners allow the animals to soil these pavements. Office-goers and students like me end up stepping on the muck. It?s really surprising how educated people can dirty public places in this manner when the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is trying to beautify the city. Planting saplings and renovating footpaths and roadside gardens are of no use until and unless educated Calcuttans realise that they are equally responsible for keeping their city clean. 

 Biswajit Guha Roy,

 Taratala. 

 The area where Mukhram Kanoria Road meets Rabindra Setu, in Howrah town, is always congested. A long stretch at the end the bridge does not have proper footpaths. Pavements which once existed have now turned into vats with garbage spilling over onto the roads. The stench is unbearable. Howrah Municipal Corporation and the Howrah Improvement Trust should take necessary steps to clean the area.

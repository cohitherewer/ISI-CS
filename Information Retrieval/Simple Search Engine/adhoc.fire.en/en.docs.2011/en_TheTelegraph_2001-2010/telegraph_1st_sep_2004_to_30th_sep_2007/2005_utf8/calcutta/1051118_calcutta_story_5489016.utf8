 The situation at Jadavpur University became murkier on Thursday, with the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) declaring that it will not participate in any academic activity, including examinations, for an indefinite period. 

 The students are already boycotting classes.

 During the day, Fetsu leaders submitted a memorandum to vice-chancellor Ashok Nath Basu, stating that they will continue their agitation till the cases against nine students are withdrawn. 

 Last week, the Alipore court had issued arrest warrants against the nine.

 The students stayed away from class on Thursday and organised meetings, procession and rallies on the campus.

 ?We expected the authorities to understand our sentiments and respond to our demand. Since the university officials are hardly concerned about our problem, we feel a more intense movement is needed. That is why we have decided to boycott all academic activities for an indefinite period, instead of just staying away from the classes,? said Fetsu leader Somnath Ghosh.

 The members of the union on Thursday got in touch with Writers? Buildings officials and sought an appointment with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 ?We want to meet the chief minister and tell him how we are being victimised by the police, despite the university authorities withdrawing all charges against us four months ago,? said another Fetsu leader. 

 South 24-Parganas police has charged the nine students for allegedly assaulting cops on June 10. A police team had visited the university on the night to break a fast-unto-death by the students.

 JU registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay said on Thursday that the university officials had written to the public prosecutor of Alipore court asking him to look into the matter. ?We understand the students? problem. But since the matter is sub judice, our hands are tied,? Bandyopadhyay added.

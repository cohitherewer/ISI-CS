 All-action 

township 

gains acres

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Spurred on by the scramble for space in New Town, the implementing agency for the Rajarhat township has decided to add another 2,000 hectare.

 Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has so far been developing 3,075 hectare in New Town, divided into Action Area I, II and III. The added area will constitute Action Area IV, V and VI.

 Of the 2,000 extra hectares, about 800 hectare will be utilised for residential purpose, 100 hectare will house an IT hub while a sports complex will take up another 100 hectare.

 The rest is a wetland, to be developed as an entertainment centre in co-ordination with the newly formed Wetland Development Authority.

 ?We had not expected such fantastic response from all corners. We have no alternative but to extend the township to cope with the rising demand,? housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Deb told Metro on Thursday.

 ?Development of basic infrastructure, including roads, drainage, sewerage, electricity and drinking water supply, is almost complete in Action Area I, II and III. I have asked the officers and engineers to speed up procurement of land and development of infrastructure in the extended area,?? he added.

 According to Hidco figures, nearly 6,000 residential plots have been allotted to 2,900 individuals and 2,800 cooperatives in Action Area I and II. Allotment of 2,700 residential plots in Action Area II and III is currently on.

 Over 300 acres have been allotted to IT companies, while commercial estates, malls, office complexes, cultural centres, educational institutions and public utility centres will be set up on 1,000 acres. In addition to that, 40 acres will be allotted to eight developers to build residential estates.

 ?I have never witnessed such demand for land. We have received nearly 27,000 applications for only 2,500 plots,? stated Hidco managing director R.K. Tripathi.

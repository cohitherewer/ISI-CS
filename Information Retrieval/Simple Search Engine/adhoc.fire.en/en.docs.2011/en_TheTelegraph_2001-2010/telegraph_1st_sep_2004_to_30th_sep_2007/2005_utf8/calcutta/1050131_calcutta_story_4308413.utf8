The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without?

Hogging at weddings

Shut your kitchen this week, take out your finest silks and hog at all the wedding 

receptions in sight. If you don?t have that many invitations, just doll up, put 

on a dazzling smile, wrap up a small something and gate crash! If stopped for 

introductions, you can always be the nth cousin of some obscure soul. Gulp down 

the guilt factor by blessing the newly-weds profusely in return. 

Grooving to jazz

If you didn?t manage to tune in to Shakti at Science City or Jonas Hellborg at 

Someplace Else or Mito at Tollygunge Club or The Red Area at GD Birla Sabhagar, 

read up, listen up, do what you will. Just don?t let it show that you have nothing 

to do with all that jazz coming to town.

Being in BED

The latest hangout in town, on 7 Ballygunge Circular Road, opens on February 2. 

The three-in-one bar-entertainment-dining (BED) stop will feature the best in 

DJ music with names like Tally, Aqeel and Logical Lloyd mixing up some major magic 

for you. Chill out at the nightclub or enjoy the crisp winter evening air under 

a star-spangled sky (if you can spot it through the smog, that is) on their outdoor 

lawn, with food to sustain it all from an international cuisine restaurant. Just 

be careful about telling folks back home you?re going to BED with your boyfriend.

Speaking the right Shabd

If you?ve been saddled with a stuck-up guy, drag him to watch Shabd. He 

could take a cue from Sanjay Dutt, a writer in the film, married to college professor 

Antara (Aishwarya Rai), who is intrigued by her young admirer Zayed Khan and asks 

her to entice the man, hoping to use it as source material for his book. Even 

if your guy doesn?t have the nerve to mix fact with fiction, he?ll walk out with 

an eyeful of Ash and you will have made your point! Or do you really want to?

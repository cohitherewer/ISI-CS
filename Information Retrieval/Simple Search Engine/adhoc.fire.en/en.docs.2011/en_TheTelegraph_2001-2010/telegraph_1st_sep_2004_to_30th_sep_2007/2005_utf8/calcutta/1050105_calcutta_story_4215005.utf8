The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 More songs for the road

 If you want to do anything seriously, do it as a hobby. As soon as it becomes a profession, a degree of compromise comes in? And compromise means mediocrity?

A few lines from Australia?s rebel film-maker Paul 

Cox?s (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) Reflections ? An Autobiographical 

Journey. Cox was in town on Monday to deliver the Satyajit Ray Memorial Lecture 

at Nandan 2. The hour-long speech had Cox speaking in several capacities ? a film-maker, 

an artiste, a socialist and most importantly, a humanist.

 Dutch by birth, Cox, a student of photography, fell in love with the mysteries Down Under when he went there as an exchange student. Then a series of short films later, he came to Calcutta and was so intrigued by the city that he decided to shoot his first documentary. ?Then, in 1970, life was very raw here and had a big impact on me. It was an overwhelming response. I had to make the film to get the passion out of my blood. It turned out to be a very impressionistic film.?

For the film, Cox came in close contact with Ray and 

the two helped each other out with their projects. Naturally, Ray?s films had 

a huge impact on his film-making sensibilities. ?The Apu trilogy, Devi, 

Charulata ? they created new film history. Today, in this hour of horror 

and shock, we have to go back to Pather Panchali, to the muted expressions 

of the mother to the father, of the music used by Ray, which still reverberates 

throughout the world.?

 Cox was particularly critical about the big Hollywood studios. ?The huge budgets of their stupid films on violence and special effects are sometimes more than the annual budget of a Third World country. Their films are all pre-planned projects with advance TV schedules and booked theatrical chains. They are always based on bestsellers and thrillers or on biographies of people with wretched ends. They all want to play safe with their money ? star packages and no ingredients. The tenderness has disappeared from cinema. The Bergmans, the Fellinis, the Bunuels, the Rays ? I wonder if their films would be appreciated today.?

 To Cox, cinema is that powerful art form which can be used to make statements too, and not just entertain. ?Film is an art form. Art is freedom which blends vision and kindness. Film should be a reflection of life and the daily complexities it brings together. Life must be an act of love, whatever be the consequences. When we look at the ocean, we realise how mighty God is. And now we know, it is too much for us.?

 Labelled a rebel film-maker in Australia and the auteur behind well-known screen tales like Lonely Hearts and A Woman?s Tale, Cox is inspired by all kinds of music, including Rabindrasangeet and has even used it in his films. ?Tagore once said: ?I have loved this life, so I will love this death also.? In the face of death it is only love which makes sense.?

 Cox is tired with the constant barrage of violence through the audio-visual medium. ?A child in the US watches four hours of television everyday. By the time he is a 16-year-old, he has seen around 18,000 killings. Will anything be ever achieved in any war??

 So what is a good film? ?Cinema should not be about heroes, about fast cars and about special effects. It should be about unsung heroes ? may be about two old people or a woman dying. People need to see the emotional truths of life. For a Hollywood studio honcho, the emotions do not apply. It?s always about showbiz and that all-important hook. A film needs to be an all-embracing humanity. It should be able to penetrate the psyche, bend both the inner and the outer (selves),? Cox signed off.

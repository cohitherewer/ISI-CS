The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Women?s Day bash

Just the excuse to paint the town red (if you need one, that is) after the party 

season? Get your gang out, even the men (just to show them how to really have 

some fun) and celebrate the spirit of March 8. If nothing else, do it with an 

attitude that proves in the 21st century, a woman is the best thing to be.

 Buying an AC

Cool off with a brand new air-conditioner this summer. Even if the raise is long 

due, you?ve got every reason to justify the splurge in the wake of a cool budget 

2005, which has ensured gadgets like this cost less. And if your partner has been 

dragging you to Siliguri or Switzerland to hibernate every summer, investing in 

an AC will make you look as smart as Mr PC!

Springing a surprise

If you?ve had enough of vasant utsavs, try springing a surprise to spice 

things up. No fool falls for April Fool?s Day, so this is the time to play that 

prank you?ve been planning ever since you were a kid. If you want our suggestion, 

bring forward another festival ? Holi. Test-run your stocks by dumping a bucket 

full of yellow colour on unsuspecting folk at an unlikely setting. The aim: whenever 

they see colour, they should think of you!

Tasting summer

In case you haven?t noticed, juicy mangoes and slurpy watermelons have already 

made a discreet entry into the neighbourhood bazaar. Add a little yellow and red 

to your dining table and stop whining about how summer is all sweat and no fun.

Going ganja

Believe us, there?s nothing as soothing as watching a clean shaven head pop out 

of a crowd full of sweaty locks on a hot afternoon. While the look may be a lifeline 

for guys afflicted with a receding hair line, it?s just the pate the lazy lout 

in you ordered after ignoring all the hair treatment recipes suggested by well-meaning 

beauty columnists. Go on, shed the crop and bid goodbye to bad hair days. If bare 

naked is not your style, sport a cool tattoo to top it all.

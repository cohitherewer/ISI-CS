 Bangalore road crash kills four city boys

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four students from the city were killed late on Thursday, near Bangalore, when the Maruti car they were travelling in collided with a truck. Another youth suffered serious injuries.

 Police in the city said the accident occurred around 11 pm when five students of Sri Siddhartha Institute of Technology, Tumkur, were returning to their hostel from a Diwali party.

 ?The mishap took place on the Pune highway near Tumkur, 70 km from Bangalore. The Maruti rammed into the truck and four of them ? Parijat Dasgupta, Suryadip Gayen, Sabyasachi Sarkar and Subhojit Som ? died on the spot,? said an officer at the Lalbazar state police control room on Friday. 

 Debojit, the fifth boy, was injured seriously and is lying in a coma in a local nursing home.

 Bangalore Police alerted the authorities of the private engineering college and the local guardians of the boys.

 ?We were informed about the mishap this afternoon. We will render all help to the bereaved families,? said Raj Kanojia, inspector-general (law and order).

 The Gayen family was in a state of shock on Friday evening. ?Only if I had let him stay till Diwali,? grieved Ramendranath Gayen, father of 19-year-old Suryadip.

 ?He had wanted to stay back till bhaiphonta, but his father insisted that he leave for Bangalore,? explained Manabendra Gayen, a relative, at Suryadip?s uncle?s house on Bangur Avenue, where they had congregated.

 The Gayens were told of the fatal accident by Suryadip?s local guardian in Bangalore, uncle Bhupendranath Gayen, early on Friday.

 Suryadip lived with parents Ramendranath and Jayati Gayen at the WBSEB quarters in Karunamoyee, Salt Lake. 

 After finishing his schooling from St Francis Xavier in Salt Lake, Suryadip went to study electronics and telecom engineering at the Sri Siddhartha Institute of Technology, Tumkur, in 2004.

 Another victim, Sabyasachi, 19, alias Raja, was the son of Subrata Sarkar, a Hardwar-based engineer. 

 Sabyasachi used to live in the Santoshpur area of Purba Jadavpur with his grandparents. His parents and sister are in Hardwar.

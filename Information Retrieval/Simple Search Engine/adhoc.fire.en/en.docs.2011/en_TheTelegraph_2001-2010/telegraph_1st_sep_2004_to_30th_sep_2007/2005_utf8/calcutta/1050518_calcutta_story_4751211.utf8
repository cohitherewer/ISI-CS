The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I have seen offices in Baripada, Orissa, follow a different schedule in extreme summer ? from 6 am to around 10 am. But I am against advancing office hours in Calcutta. In this heat, people go to sleep late and can rest only early in the morning. So getting them to wake up an hour earlier may be counter-productive. Similarly, even if the office gives over an hour earlier, people tend to stay back till the heat subsides. So, it is better to push back the schedule by an hour rather than advance it. There is no threat of the power bill shooting up if work continues at dusk as lights are on in most offices through the day.

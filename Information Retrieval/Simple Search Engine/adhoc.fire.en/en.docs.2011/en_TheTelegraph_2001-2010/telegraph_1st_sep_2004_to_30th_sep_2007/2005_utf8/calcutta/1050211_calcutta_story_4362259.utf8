The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Across seas for IT sell

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 After criss-crossing the country, scouring for investments in information technology (IT), Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s B-team is ready to take its travel pitch far beyond the borders.

 In the first such endeavour, the IT department of the Bengal government has accepted an invitation from CeBIT, the world?s biggest information, communication and technology (ICT) show.

 After attending the seven-day mega fair in Hannover, Germany, between March 10 and 16, the group will spend a couple of days in London.

 IT minister Manab Mukherjee will lead Team Bengal, comprising G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT, and S.K. Mitra, managing director, Webel, and a 20-member industry delegation with representatives from companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers, SkyTech Solutions and Usha Comm.

 ?The southern states, like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, have been sending high-level government delegations to CeBIT for some time. But Bengal only takes up a stall,? said B.G. Roy, regional director, Indo-German Chamber of Commerce.

 Mukherjee, who is awaiting the go-ahead from the chief minister, is tight-lipped about the high-profile tech trip. 

 Sources in Writers? Buildings, however, confirmed that clearance for the visit is just a matter of time. 

 The file is with the chief minister, who is all geared up to sell Bengal as an IT hub in the global marketplace.

 Nasscom chief Kiran Karnik had, in fact, urged the state government during Infocom 2004 to organise ?roadshows outside India?.

 The team bound for CeBIT has already started work on an elaborate plan, that includes taking part in the fair and showcasing the strengths of the state at meetings and seminars. Industry representatives will share their experience of conducting business in Bengal.

 Interaction with industry bodies in Germany and London and catching up with heads of companies like Siemens and SAP are also on the cards.

 ?The CEOs start taking interest when they see ministers in the team and I think Bengal will benefit immensely from the visit,? observed Roy.

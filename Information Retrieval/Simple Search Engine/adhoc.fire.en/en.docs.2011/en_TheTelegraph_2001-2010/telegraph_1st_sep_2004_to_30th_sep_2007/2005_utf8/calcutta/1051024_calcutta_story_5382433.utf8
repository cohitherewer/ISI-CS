 Italian cuisine is much more than pizzas and pastas, stresses executive chef Sujan Mukherjee of Taj Bengal. And if you turn up for the Polenta festival at The Hub, youll know exactly what he means.

 Polenta, a wholesome meal with cornmeal mash as base, can be served soft, hard, grilled or fried. Peppered with various other ingredients like dices of lamb, chicken, prawn or even vegetables, and finally topped with interesting sauces, the dish is quite yummy.

 Once called the poor mans food, polenta is very much a part of the menu at restaurants today. With natural taste and intense food value, polenta is also healthy, adds Mukherjee.

 The festival, on till October 31, is an assortment of vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies.

 The non-vegetarian platter includes Polenta alla Contadina (grilled pork chops on a polenta bed with bacon and cabbage), Polenta alla Piemontese (roasted New Zealand lamb rack with grilled polenta and Parmesan flakes), Polenta Smalzada Triestina (soft polenta with Anchovies, Parmesan cheese and onion rings) and Polenta con Polpette di Manzo (tender loin balls in tomato basil sauce on a bed of polenta). 

 One can also dig into a vegetarian fare with items like Polenta Concia (polenta cooked with milk and Grana Padano), Polpettine di Polenta (Gruyere and Parmesan polenta flavoured with nutmeg and truffle oil), Polenta Unta (roasted garlic and sage-flavoured polenta with Parmesan and grilled mushrooms) and Polenta alla Sarda Vegetariana (Pecorino polenta with cherry tomatoes, basil and green peas). 

 Non-vegetarian dishes are priced at Rs 375-plus. The vegetarian platter starts at Rs 345.

 Todays taste

 Diwali is the time when you give your wardrobe a vibrant touch, with lots of magenta, violet, scarlet and fuchsia. Designer Tarina Sens festive collection, now being showcased at Ogaan on Southern Avenue, is in keeping with the festive mood.

 Tarinas line comprises saris, lehngas and long skirts. The lehngas are in brocade, velvet and tissue, with delicate embroidery embellished with stones, shimmering sequins of gold, silver, dabka and salma, with thick paisley borders.

 The georgette saris in shades of magenta, peacock blue, peach, jade green, amber and purple are embellished with heavy embroidery and multi-coloured sequins and paisley motifs. The collection is a blend of past and contemporary styles, thereby depicting the choice of todays woman, says the Bhubaneswar-based designer.

 Colour, candles and clothes? The Diwali mood is upon us. And in keeping with the festive spirit, designer Shradha Manaktala has come up with her new collection, Collegzione, that is an assortment of Indo-Western kurta, kurti, skirt, suits, saris and bags.

 Fun and festive is how I would describe my line. It reflects youth and freedom, smiles Shradha. The collection with a lot of American-Indian beading draws inspiration from the Japanese geisha era.

 The suits, more or less on Indo-Western lines, come in asymmetrical cuts, layered fabrics and exaggerated sleeves combined with stoles. Those with traditional tastes can opt for long salwar suits.

 Though nature has been an influence, I have tried to move away from the common motifs of flowers and leaves and instead used uncommon forms, explains the NIFT graduate.

 From solid white and black to splashy magenta, the collection of skirts are definite eyecatchers. Team them up with a variety of elegant kurtis and tops that are available. Also on offer are pretty bags.

 Prices start at Rs 1,000. The saris begin at Rs 8,000.

 The collection will be available with boutiques like Ogaan, Zenon and Aura, as well as at her residence, 74 G/1A, Bondel Road.

 Coat of gold

 Kleopatra, a newly-opened store at 120/A Rashbehari Avenue, is home to a variety of costume jewellery. Heavy and light, splashy and sleek, with metal pieces plated with gold.

 The jewellery looks as good as real gold, yet you can indulge in them without having to worry about your pocket and, most importantly, safety, explains Heena Seth of Kleopatra.

 The premium range, including brands like My Gold, offers hi-tech plasma gold-coated pieces. The collection includes a vast range of bangles, neckpieces, earrings, nose pins and rings. While some are combined with stones, others come adorned with meena work. The heavy kundan sets with oxidised finish are eye-catchers.

 Prices start as low as Rs 45, while the premium range begins at Rs 250.

 Talent hunt

 The Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI), in association with Instituto Marangoni, a Milan-based fashion design school, and the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce, have launched Festa Italiana Fashion Design Talent Contest.

 The contest aims to provide young Indian fashion designers an opportunity to take a closer look at the fashion capitals of the world.

 The top three winners will receive travel and tuition scholarships to fashion design programmes in Italy and Europe. This includes a master programme in fashion design (2006-07) on a Milan campus, and two summer programmes in fashion design in institutes of Milan and London.

 The contest is open to final-year students of fashion technology institutes or courses that have been invited to send in their entries, by October 26. The top 10 entries will be invited to make a presentation along with two or three ensembles, to be judged by international designers Gianfranco Ferre, Beatrice Trussardi, Fabio Marangoni and Ricardo Agostini of Instituto Marangoni.

 The entries from Bengal can be sent to the director of NIFT at LA Block (near Tank no.16), Sector III, Salt Lake, Calcutta 700098.

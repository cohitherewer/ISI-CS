 The seventh GoodLife Talk Show on Sunday evening, with Health and Fitness as the topic, could not have come at a better time. After all, these are the weeks when Calcuttans are all geared up to burn those extra calories and detoxify themselves after a season of festivities.

 The venue was Merlin Greens Apartment Complex in Behala, off Diamond Harbour Road.

 The talk show held in the open space of the complex under a clear November sky witnessed a full-house comprising men, women and children who had all gathered to hear the two guests for the evening ? actor Arindam Sil and gynaecologist Dr Dipannita Hazari. The show was moderated by Rita Bhimani.

 After a brief welcome speech by resident R.P. Singh, the Q amp;A session was set rolling by Rita who asked the two guests how they kept themselves fit, despite such busy schedules.

 Arindam, of Ek Akasher Niche and Ekdin Protidin fame, said: It is very important to identify that fitness is not only about being physically fit. According to me, mental fitness is much more important. The key to my staying fit is being able to spend some time with my own self at the end of the day. It is also important that we ask ourselves, each day, what little good we have done for society. For me, life becomes more meaningful only when you start living for others.

 Dipannita was in agreement with the actor and added: Fitness these days is of extreme importance with stress levels running so high. The key to remaining fit is to be able to make time for oneself, even if it is only 15 minutes. And that is not an impossiblity. I try and keep some time for myself everyday to pursue my hobbies. I also go for morning walks on a regular basis. These are the only two things I do to keep fit.

 Resident R.P. Singh then asked how he could keep himself fit despite his hectic schedule. 

 Start out by doing yoga in the morning, very simple ones like pranayam and kapalbhaati. Nothing helps you de-stress better and keep fresh for the day, said the actor.

 The doctor added: If possible, also take a brisk half-an-hour walk, be it in the morning or at night after dinner. And never ever take work back home. Also, try to keep your temper under control, for there is far greater pleasure in being able to smile and making others smile.

 Questions from every corner then ranged from post-menstrual tension and correct dietary specifications after 40, to secret of Dipannita and Ritas glowing skin.

 The ladies, a trifle embarassed, said: None of us does anything special. What is most important for a glowing skin is to be happy within. The face is after all a reflection of your inner self, they smiled.

 The hour-long chat show drew to a close with Mr Kanodias question directed at Dipannita, asking for a calcium-rich diet for vegetarians like him.Milk products like curd, cheese, paneer and corn, was the prescription from the doctor who is also a regular on the small screen.

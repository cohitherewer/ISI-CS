 THE COLONY

 Gobindapur rail colony is more than 50 years old. Around 800 families displaced from erstwhile East Pakistan first settled along the railway land spread over 15 to 20 bighas. The number of dwellers has risen to over 19,000, at last count.

 THE CASE

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta files a PIL in Calcutta High Court in June 1997, seeking a directive on the squatters for causing pollution on the Lakes. High court judges Umesh Chandra Banerjee and Ranajit Mitra pass the first order in 1998, directing the administration to fence off Rabindra Sarobar. The case goes to Supreme Court in October 1999, with the railways moving the apex court against the high court order. However, the case is transferred back to the high court.

 THE EVICTION

 The high court orders the first eviction drive on December 16, 2000, but it never takes off. The drive is deferred half-a-dozen times in the face of squatter hostility and political protests.

 THE TURNING POINT

 On November 30, 2005, the squatters submit an undertaking to the court confirming that they would leave the Lakes by December 15.

 TUESDAY?S TRICKLE

 Nearly 100 families moved out of Gobindapur rail colony, with emotions ranging from resentment to resignation.

 WHERE WILL THEY GO?

 A majority of them will move to the new site, and for now live under the open skies, at Madurdaha near Nonadanga, 15 km from Gobindapur.

 THEIR LOCUS STANDI

 Calcutta Police and Government Railway Police will give certificates to those leaving the Lakes, which will then enable them to set up dwellings at the new site with government aid. But the evicted squatters will not be able to cast their votes this time, falling short of the six months of residence at the new spot stipulated by the poll book.

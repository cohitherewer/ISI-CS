 Radiation denied, suicide in hospital 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What the pain of cancer over the last few years could not do to Chandra Narayan Chakraborty, a stint at a hospital did.

 The 65-year-old committed suicide in a toilet at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) on Wednesday morning, after being denied radiation by the hospital staff.

 Chakraborty had been suffering from oesophagus cancer and was admitted to CNCI on March 31. On Monday and Tuesday, he did not get radiation, which caused him much pain, family members said.

 ?The doctors told us on both days that there was nothing they could do because the machine had broken down. When we pointed out that there were other radiation machines at their disposal, they told us that my father will have to wait till Wednesday or Saturday for his turn,? alleged Tapan, son of the deceased.

 Early on Wednesday, Chakraborty locked himself in a hospital toilet and hanged himself. He did not leave any suicide note. But just before leaving his bed on the fourth floor of the hospital, he had complained of feeling miserable.

 ?On Monday, we were told that it was too late for radiation. It was only 5 pm, but the hospital staff seemed to be in a hurry to leave. We told them that the patient was in great pain, but nobody listened,? complained a close relative of Chakraborty.

 He was denied radiation on Tuesday, too. The family members pleaded with the hospital authorities, saying that the radiation could provide some relief to the patient.

 The officials said there was nothing they could do, as there was a long queue. Chakraborty would be given radiation on Wednesday or Saturday, they assured the relatives.

 On Tuesday night, Chakraborty spoke to his son and wife Lalita briefly. He told them: ?You have worked hard for me and a lot of money has already been wasted. Go home and rest now.?

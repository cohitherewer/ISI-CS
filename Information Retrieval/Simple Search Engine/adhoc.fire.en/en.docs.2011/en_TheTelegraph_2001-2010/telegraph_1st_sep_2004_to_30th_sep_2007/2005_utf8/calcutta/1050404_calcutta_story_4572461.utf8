 Top plans for telly 

 Familiar faces of the Bengali television industry at a party

 Even as the big channels keep crossing swords over everything from subscription rates to name changes to movie premieres, a remote-controlled tour on the tube route will tell you that Bengali channels here command a big chunk of the telly space, if not the viewership time. Keeping that in mind and to streamline the local small screen industry, a new company named Bengal Television Academy (BTA) is being set up.

 Says CEO Gautam Jain, the man better known for handling big awards shows in the city: ?It is obviously inspired from the Indian Television Academy. We have also spoken to them and depending on our performance in the first few months, they have promised to endorse BTA and take us under their wing. The primary intention of the BTA is to make people aware of the importance of the Bengali television industry and its amazing possibilities. We also want to strictly demarcate the television industry from the film fraternity.? 

 Apart from the awareness campaign, BTA aspires to instill professionalism in every department of the television industry, keep the industry abreast of state-of-art techniques and technologies available in other parts of the country and abroad, and arrange lectures, debates, group discussions, workshops, seminars, conferences, educational tours and exhibitions for television.

 The BTA website, www.banglatelevisionacademy.com, is already up and plans to incorporate the yellow pages and an industry directory on the website are on. The official launch of the website will be done by Prosenjit in the near future.

 But the popular clincher, like in the ITA, is the BTA Annual Awards. ?At present, the Bengali television industry has no awards dedicated to recognise the skills and talents of its members, be it behind the camera or in front. Addressing this, we have set up the annual awards, which is being supported by the Bengal Film Journalists Association,? adds Jain.

Even the voting procedure for the awards is a novel concept. The awards would be tabulated taking into consideration the points given by a confidential jury panel, the TRP ratings of the show involved and also the votes cast by viewers. For nationwide audience participation, polling will be made available on the website. The technical awards winners will be decided by a special advisory committee. The awards categories, a whopping 43 in total, will include everything from serials and soaps to telefilms and news to even chat and game shows.

 ?The inaugural awards ceremony will happen some time in July at the Science City auditorium. Right now, we are trying to organise a seminar with Mahesh Bhatt as our first major event. We also want to host a panel discussion on how to improve the marketing scenario in Bengali television,? reveals Jain.

 The reaction from the industry has been mixed. Says Arindam Sil, a familiar face on the small screen: ?With the Bengali television business in full bloom at the moment, any institute which tries to boost the industry is welcome, provided they are dedicated to our well being and our interests. Not everything that is being dished out these days in the name of television is of the right standard. An organised effort can only help us achieve professional excellence, both quantitatively and qualitatively.?

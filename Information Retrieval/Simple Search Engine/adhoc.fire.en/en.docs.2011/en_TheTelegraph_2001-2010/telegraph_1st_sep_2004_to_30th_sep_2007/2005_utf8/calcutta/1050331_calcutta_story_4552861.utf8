 Who?s that girl?

 A moment from the new cola commercial featuring Aamir Khan

 He started off as a Mumbaiya tapori, chiding the ignoramus as a ?bina terrace ki building?, proceeded to play the Hyderabadi retailer, the Punjabi farmer, the Nepali tourist guide and the Bengali babu, out with family on a quality-controlled eat-out mission ? each avatar as endearing as the other. 

 Aamir Khan is back on beam ? as an NRI who has forgotten his Indian connection on a visit home. A bottle of Coca Cola reminds him of his roots. And Manno Bhabi, the lady who converts the funky dude, is ? surprise, surprise ? Aamir Khan again. The new Coke commercial will uncork the star in his maiden double role.

 After rural outings and cafe visits, he is finally home. ?Since 90 per cent beverages are consumed at home, the focus of the advertisement is aimed at increased consumption indoors. We have changed our tagline to ?Ghar mein rakhiye thanda matlab Coca-Cola?,? says Vikas Gupta, vice-president, marketing, Coca-Cola India.

 Another first is the teleserial format. The 90-second spot opens with the title ?Manno Bhabi?, paving way for the drama to unfold in the family. At the end, too, the Coke slogans roll on screen in the form of credits. ?It is a take-off on the daily soaps,? smiles director Abhijeet Chaudhuri of Black Magic Productions (of Patalghar fame).

 This was Chaudhuri?s first stint with the actor. ?I had heard Aamir was a perfectionist, but to what extent, I got to know through this experience,? he exclaimed from Mumbai. The team had to sit two-three days for the homework. One day, the script was discussed. Another day went in deciding costume and make-up. Another day the director and the script-writer went to Amritsar, where he was shooting, with the dialogue. ?He wants to be dead sure about what he says and wears.? 

?It took a minimum of two-and-a-half to three hours 

to put on the woman?s make-up. Aamir may look chocolate-faced, but when you try 

to dress him as a woman then you realise how masculine his jawline is. So we decided 

not to take low-angle shots. Nor could we majorly change his hairstyle or shave 

his body-hair as he is shooting for Rang De Basanti,? says Chaudhuri.

 Yet the result is stunning. ?He is a thinking film person and understands all the technicalities. He pointed out that his right-profile was more feminine. Our make-up man Mickey Contractor had worked with him in Baazi where he had played a vamp in a song sequence. So it was easier for us to bring Manno Bhabi alive,? adds the director. 

 ?No other star takes ads so seriously,? says Prasoon Joshi, national creative director of McCann Erickson, the brain and the pen behind the entire Thanda matlab Coca-Cola series.

 Two Gold Lions at Cannes, awards at New York and London festivals, Campaign of the Year from Advertising Agencies Association of India and Advertising Club Mumbai, two EFFIE golds, Don Keogh Marketing Mastery Award? the credits keep rolling. If more is added with this one, it will be two cheers for Aamir.

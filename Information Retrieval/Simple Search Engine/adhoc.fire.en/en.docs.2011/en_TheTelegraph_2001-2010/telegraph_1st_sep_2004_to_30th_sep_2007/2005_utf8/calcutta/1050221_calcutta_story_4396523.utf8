The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

Taking your parents to watch Black

Black magic has gripped the city like never before and there?s no way you 

can escape the effects. While chances are you?ve already caught Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s 

masterpiece on screen at least once, make the second trip to the theatre with 

your parents. After all, that?s one of the trends the film seems to be setting 

? drawing generations to the halls. And we don?t think you?re going to complain 

about sitting through the landmark movie a second time.

Stocking up in sale season

 You?ll seldom get a better excuse to go on a shopping binge. With quite a 

few stores around town scaling down prices to get rid of their winter stocks, 

it?s a good time to pick up woollens at season-end sales. Stash these in your 

wardrobe to be taken out next November. And at the same time, gift yourself some 

cool cottons and georgettes in floral prints and pastel hues to be able to welcome 

spring in style.

Donning the Ash look

 This one?s recommended strictly for Ash?s female fans. If you?ve always dreamt 

of donning the Ash look, here?s your chance. Buy a ticket to the Aishwarya Rai-Sanjay 

Dutt starrer Shabd at any of the INOXs and if you are lucky, you can win 

an original outfit worn by the star in the film. Fitting into a garment tailored 

according to the svelte lady?s vital stats can even give you the impetus to shed 

a few kilos. And you can at least flaunt your new figure with elan even if you 

aren?t lucky enough to bag the starry attire.

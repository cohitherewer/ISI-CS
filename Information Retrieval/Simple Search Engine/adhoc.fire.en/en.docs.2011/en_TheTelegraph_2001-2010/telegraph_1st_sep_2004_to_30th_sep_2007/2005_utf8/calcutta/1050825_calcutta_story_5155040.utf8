 a work of art, no less: An artisan at work at Kumartuli 

 lApropos the report ?Murmurs of medical JEE alternative?, August 4, the abolition of Joint Entrance Examination will be a step in the wrong direction. 

 Whatever method is adopted to bring a parity in the marks awarded by different boards, it will not be fool-proof. Some section of the students will surely be discriminated against. 

 Moreover, the aim of the government, to help meritorious students who have done well in the board exams, will be defeated. This is because a good student might not secure good marks in the board exams due to various reasons, including sickness. These students, and others, will not get a second chance to pursue studies in their preferred subjects. 

 The government had made a mistake in 1973 by introducing a district quota for admission to medical colleges. Careers of many brilliant students were destroyed as a result and the practice had to be eventually discontinued. 

 More than three decades later, many doctors of my generation have not been able to forget the trauma of losing a year. A mistake of this magnitude should not be repeated by the government. 

 The best way to help the students who have done well in the board examinations will be to conduct the JEE on the basis of the HS syllabus of Class XII only. No question should be asked from outside the recommended textbooks. 

 The questions should also be of the multiple-choice type, so that there isn?t any subjective discrepancy in marking by different examiners. 

 This is the only way to ensure justice for all the students. I hope the health minister will take his decision wisely, because it is in his interest to give all the students a fair chance.

 The report ?Artefacts in distress?, July 28, stressed the need to look into the long-standing grievances of the artisans of Kumartuli. The art gallery, started to showcase the works of the inhabitants of the 300-year-old locality, should be reopened and run properly. Proper maintenance of the gallery would increase the export potential of the artisans? creations manifold and boost their employment prospects.

 The state government?s plan to withdraw the no-objection certificates given to some English-medium schools having inadequate fire-safety arrangements is most welcome (?Schools in line of fire?, August 1). The students of these schools will be saved from a possible fire, but won?t their studies be affected?

 lIt is a bitter truth that English-medium schools that care little for infrastructural precautions are mushrooming in the city and its suburbs. The state government needs to adopt a strict stand in this regard to avoid tragedies.

 ?Shopping for 24x7 mall hours?, August 2, brought some good news for Calcuttans. For long, people have wondered whether shop-owners in the city are really interested in doing business, given that they religiously down shutters every evening even if customers are turned back in the process. People work late now and want to pick up a gift on the way home to patch up a morning fight with the spouse. People go to shops more frequently than police stations or hospitals. If they can remain open 24x7, why can?t shops?

 It is a matter of grave concern that the Citu leaders did not bother to inform the police or the Regional Transport Authority about setting up two autorickshaw stands on a heavy-traffic zone in the city (Stands block airport artery, August 5). People are disgusted with the auto menace. Several times, I have seen auto-drivers violate traffic rules right under the noses of the cops. An officer once told me that he cannot book errant auto-drivers as they are the ?adopted sons of the honourable transport minister? and any steps against them would boomerang.

 Apropos ?Women unsafe: Buddha?, August 5, if this is the state of affairs in Calcutta, then the plight of women in rural Bengal can well be imagined. Police must be given more power and most importantly, a sea-change has to be brought about in the mindset of the common-people to prevent exploitation of women.

 With reference to the article ?Fracas at night-out? published on August 22, I wish to clarify certain facts. At around 1.25 am, a group of 11 foreigners visited Shisha. As per our house rules, they were asked to pay for five cover charge coupons that are redeemable inside at Rs 500 per couple. The guests were adamant and abusive. They refused to pay at the entrance and were trying to force their way into the bar. Some members of this group were also inebriated. One of the persons in the group then tore off a cover charge sheet from the managers desk and was caught. Two coupons were missing and they were all asked to leave after paying for the coupons. Not only did they refuse to pay, they also manhandled the manager. At this point, the security intervened and ordered the guests to leave. On their way out, they abused some Shisha guests and used remarks that were anti-Indian. This resulted in a scuffle that injured staff, security and damaged a section of our property. 

 The Shakespeare Sarani police station was called immediately. The inspector spoken to advised us to detain the persons till a police team arrived. On these instructions, the security of 22 Camac Street were informed to detain the guests downstairs. Another tussle ensued on the ground floor and the police posted near the US Consulate also arrived at this stage. 

 As part of the hospitality industry, we would like to stress that such incidents are strictly not encouraged by us. Our constant endeavour has been to provide a safe and conducive climate for our guests within our premises free of vandalism and hooliganism.

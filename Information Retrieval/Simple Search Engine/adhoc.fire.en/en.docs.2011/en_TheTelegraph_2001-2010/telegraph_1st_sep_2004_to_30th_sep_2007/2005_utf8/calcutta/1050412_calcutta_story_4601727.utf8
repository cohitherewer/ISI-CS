 A host of home remedies for different skin problems, make-up solutions for various occasions and sure-shot ways to maintain the lustre of your tresses. All this and much more was on offer at the Sananda Vatika Roopkatha ? an interactive session for beauty solutions ? held at Moksh on 22 Camac Street last week.

 Hosted for the second year in a row, the by-invitation-only event saw similar sessions in Durgapur, Behrampore and Midnapore as well. 

 The panelists for the Calcutta workshop included beautician Roshmita, make-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar, fashion designer Tityakanti Sen and event manager Sanchita.

 Theories, discussions and solutions were the order of the day as the women present left the venue with a bag full of tips and techniques.

 The audience comprised women of all age-groups ? from teenyboppers to 70-year-olds ? who were selected from applications received through newspaper advertisements.

Home care

 Beauty expert Roshmita drummed out a series of solutions for skin and hair woes. Right from skin lightening to hair fall, the beautician referred to the kitchen for all problems. She suggested home remedies using simple ingredients to keep the skin glowing through the sultry months.

Make-up mantra

 ?Our session is aimed at homemakers and not models. Hence, I would advise them to go for whatever looks best on them rather than follow fashion trends. The idea behind good make-up is to highlight a person?s features and hide the flaws, without being overbearing on her personality. It?s important to maintain your individual style,? said Chakladar. 

 The ace artiste displayed his makeover skills on a few, punctuating the session with useful tips on the right way to do up your face, while matching it with your personality and outfits. He also spoke about the harmful effects of make-up.

Fashion facts

 If Chakladar enlightened the audience about make-up modes, it was designer Tityakanti Sen?s turn to educate them on fashion facts.

 He discussed the kinds of fabrics and necklines that one should wear, taking into consideration the body type. He also pointed out the colours that go with each skin tone.

 ?The fall of the fabric or cut of the blouse is very important to flatter your strengths and hide the flaws,? stressed Sen. 

Talking traits

 After make-up and fashion, the discussion panned out to matters far beyond the physical. 

 Grooming expert Sanchita took over to offer tips on public speaking, confidence building, body language and etiquette. 

 ?How you introduce yourself at an interview, a meeting or even at a party is very important as the first impression has the maximum impact on people,? she offered.

 About public speaking, she added: ?Often, people speak in shaky voices and this stems from self-consciousness. The best way to avoid this is by repeating what you want to say over and over in your head and being confident of its relevance. Only once you are sure should you speak up, keeping your tone smooth and composed. Chewing up your words is another absolute no-no.? 

Prizes galore

 At the end of the day, it was not just a bounty of information that the audience walked away with. 

 The icing on the cake came in the form of a host of Vatika products handed out to 10 winners from the audience in various categories like the best dressed woman, most graceful lady, one with the best make-up on, the best question related to a particular topic and many more similar ones.

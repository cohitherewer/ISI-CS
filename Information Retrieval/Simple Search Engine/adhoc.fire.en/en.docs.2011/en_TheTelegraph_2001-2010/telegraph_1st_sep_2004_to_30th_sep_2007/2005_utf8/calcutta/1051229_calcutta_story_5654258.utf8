 One of the most celebrated masters of the visual arts in the 20th century, Abani Sen is remembered as much for his skill in wielding the brush as for his defiance of all odds in staying true to his craft. As a tribute to the legendary artist in his birth centenary year, Reflection of Another Day (RAD), in association with Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC), hosts an exhibition of paintings featuring works by eminent artists, as well as by Sen himself. Though his brush with fame began when he received acclaim as a watercolour artist, Sen later re-invented himself as a master of oil colours, choosing oil as his favourite medium of self-expression. Painting images in bold, dark colours, his works sometimes depict human figures, animals and birds as a conjoined, mangled mass of forms, expressing his concern about ecological imbalance and its harmful effects on life and nature. Other renowned artists, whose paintings are featured, include Atul Bose, Dorai Swami, Indra Dugar, Nandalal Bose, Ramkinkar Baij, Shyamal Dutta Roy, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Paritosh Sen, Bijon Chowdhury, B.R. Panesar, Dinkar Kaushik, Jogen Chowdhury, Rabin Mondal, Prakash Karmakar, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Sanatan Dinda, Suhas Roy and Wasim Kapoor. Curator: Tapan Mitra.

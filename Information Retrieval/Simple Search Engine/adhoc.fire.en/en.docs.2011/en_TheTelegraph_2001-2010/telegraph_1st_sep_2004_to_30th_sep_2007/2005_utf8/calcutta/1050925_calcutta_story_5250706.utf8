 These are some frequently asked questions about the stray-dog issue, both by people who think dogs are a nuisance and by dog lovers.

 Why do stray dogs exist in India? Why don?t you find them in London and New York?

 Almost all stray dogs belong to an ancient canine breed known as the Pariah dog, which existed all over Asia and North Africa ever since human beings started living in settlements. They are, and have always been, scavengers. In India, the breed has existed for about 14,000 years. The size of the stray dog population always corresponds to the size and character of the human population of an area. In urban India, large amounts of garbage, a source of food, and a huge population of slum and street-dwellers, who keep the dogs as free-roaming pets, have sustained the stray dog population. In developed countries, there are abandoned pets. Most are captured, housed in animal shelters and re-homed.

 To control the population, wouldn?t it make more sense to kill the dogs or take them away? 

 Removal or killing of stray dogs has actually proved to be completely useless. Even when large numbers of dogs are killed, the conditions that sustain the dog population remain unchanged.

 Dogs are territorial and each one lives in its own specific area. When they are removed, the following things happen ? the food source is still available in abundance, so dogs from neighbouring areas enter the vacant territories; pups born and growing up in the surrounding areas also move in to occupy these vacant spaces; the few dogs which escape capture attack these newcomers, leading to frequent and prolonged dog fights.

 Since they are not sterilised, all dogs escaping capture continue to mate, leading to more fights. In the course of fights, dogs often redirect their aggression towards people passing by, so many people get bitten. They breed at a very high rate (two litters of pups a year). So, the effective solution is to sterilise the dogs, vaccinate them against rabies and put them back in their own areas.

 Why put the dogs back after sterilisation?

 Because then each dog guards its own territory and does not allow new dogs to enter. Since they are all neutered, they no longer mate or multiply. The main factors leading to dog aggression ? migration and mating ? are eliminated. So, dog fights reduce dramatically. Since females no longer have pups to protect, this source of dog aggression is also eliminated.

 How can you stop dogs barking and howling the whole night?

 Barking and howling occur during dog fights, which take place during mating. The problem ends with sterilisation. Dogs bark when new dogs enter their territory and these migrations cease with sterilisation. They also howl when they live and move in packs, which stops with the dwindling population.

 What about dog bites? 

 Most dog aggression occurs during mating, as dogs cross territories to mate and fight with other dogs whose areas they enter. People passing by get accidentally bitten during dog fights. This problem is minimised if all the dogs in a neighbourhood are sterilised.

 ?I looked into Dino for reference?

 After eight months of training, DINO MOREA is ready to spend a Holiday as a Salsa dancer. He tells Pratim D. Gupta about the versatile actor in him

 Dino Morea in Holiday

What are you doing in a dance movie?

 To set the record straight, there is a misconception in this industry that if an actor doesn?t do a dance film, he?s not a dancer. It?s just that no dance films have come my way before this. I have always dreamt of doing two films ? a fantastic action film and an inspirational dance movie. Now, I came to know that Pooja (Bhatt) is doing a film about dancing. So I told her that I would like to try out and I was on. This is no Bollywood kind of dancing. I went through eight months of rigorous rehearsals to get the Salsa right. It is all very beautiful dance and really interesting.

This is the first time you have worked with a lady 

director?

 Yes, and even for Pooja she?s done a film that she is not usually associated with. From Pooja Bhatt you expect sex and skin and all that. But she has gone out of that genre to make a very happy and easy film. And she?s happier doing a film like this. She?s really brilliant, taking so much pain to make every frame look different. She, of course, has that effeminate touch about her direction. There?s also a lot more detailing, that extra care. She works with a different budget, much lesser than most directors, and so she has this motivation of making a profit with every product.

Your heroine is not the best of lookers?

 Yes, Onjolee is not the most beautiful person around but she suits the role. She is this Jassi kind of girl ? gawky, not confident of herself at all. And then she gets into this dance situation. So what Holiday shows it?s that you don?t have to be an Aishwarya Rai to be a beauty queen. The confidence always comes from within.

The basic plot of the film is inspired from Dirty 

Dancing. Did you watch the movie before shooting to learn Patrick Swayze?s 

moves?

 No, I didn?t want to watch Dirty Dancing again. I remember watching it many years ago when I was in school. I didn?t want to watch it again for reference. I wanted to look into Dino for reference. I trained rigorously for eight months to make the dancing look as authentic as possible. I always wanted that the moves shouldn?t look fake, they should look like Latino. I didn?t want to make a fool of myself.

Is this a conscious image change for a man who?s 

generally synonymous with action?

 I don?t know whether this can be called conscious or not. But after Holiday, which is a romantic dance movie, I am doing an action film like Fight Club. Then in Aksar, I have this brilliant role of a sober and mature businessman. Next I play a total clown in Tom Dick And Harry. And then I am doing another Pooja film, again about dancing, but this time it will be disco. Finally I have just signed a typical Dharmesh Darshan film. So you can say I am looking into a kind of versatility which will take me to another level altogether.

You were very good as the bad guy in Rakht. 

Would you do another negative role?

 See, however good you are in a movie, if that film doesn?t work, people don?t remember you or your character in that movie. It goes totally unnoticed. You are forgotten much more easily. But yes, if I do get a good negative role, I will definitely do it.

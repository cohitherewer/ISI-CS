 Just arrived, but here to stay

 With ads loudly proclaiming permanent visitors and just arrived as punch lines, Cobra Beer announced on Wednesday that it is looking at Calcutta as a key market and is pumping substantial investments into making the beer a popular drink in Bengal.

 Perses Bilimoria, regional director of Cobra Indian Beer, said: Cobra is a premium beer, which we feel will appeal to the finer tastes of the discerning beer drinker of Calcutta.

 The city launch of the beer brand held at The Park on Wednesday was attended by British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall.

 Cobra Beer is one of the fastest-growing beer brands in the United Kingdom. It is being exported to over 35 countries worldwide and has offices in Mumbai, Cape Town and New York.

 India-brewed Cobra will be marketed across Calcutta, New Delhi, Mumbai, Goa and Pune, followed by a launch in Hyderabad next month.

 The beer will be marketed at competitive prices, with the 650-ml bottle priced at Rs 50 and the 330-ml bottle priced at Rs 30 in Bengal.

 India is a predominantly spirits market. The huge youth movement is where our focus is. Our target consumers are those in the age range of 21 to 45, with special focus on consumers between 21 and 35, said Bilimoria.

 Cobra Beer announced a technical collaboration with Mount Shivalik group in 2004, whereby Shivalik, under license, is brewing the beer for the domestic Indian market at its facility in Behror, Rajasthan. 

 Keeping in mind the rather large Indian beer market, Cobra plans to tie up with other independent breweries in other parts of the country as well.

 As Bilimoria put it, India has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and there is a huge emerging market for beer. Currently, the total retail sales of beer in India is about 85 million cases per annum and it is growing at about 7.5 per cent per annum.

 But the Indian beer market does have quite a bit to go before reaching the levels of world markets. The Indian beer market today is where the Chinese beer market was 20 years ago. Today, China has overtaken the United States as the largest beer market in the world. The per-capita consumption of beer in China today is 20 litre. It was less than a litre, 25 years ago. India, on the other hand, has a per capita consumption of just 0.7 litre, and even if the market here keeps growing at 7.5 per cent, its per-capita income would be a mere 4.6 litre, observed Bilimoria.

 Founded by Karan Billimoria in 1989, Cobra enjoys a listing in every major UK multiple retailer such as Tesco, Safeway, Sainsburys and Selfridges. It has also launched its own brand of low-cal and low-carb beer, as well as alcohol-free beer.

 While the low calorie and the low carbohydrate varieties may make their way to the Indian market somewhere down the line, the current demand for alcohol-free beer does not merit a look, leave alone a launch.

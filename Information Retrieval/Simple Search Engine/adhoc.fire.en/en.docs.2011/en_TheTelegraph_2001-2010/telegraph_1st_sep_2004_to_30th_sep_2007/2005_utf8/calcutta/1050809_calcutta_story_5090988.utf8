 Cops rescue rare hawk from crows

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Constable Lakkhiram Karji?s job is to keep an eye on Rabindra Sarobar and its surroundings. His responsibilities do not extend to the avian species. But had it not been for Karji, a young hawk , under attack from a flock of crows, could not have been saved.

 The bird was lying on the road in front of Anderson Swimming Club, surrounded by the crows, when Karji, along with Moloy Chaudhury, a retired IFS officer, rescued it around 1 pm on Monday.

 The crows were pecking at the hawk, which was screaming. A crowd had gathered on the spot, but the bird?s sharp claws and beak kept them at bay. The rescuers brought the hawk to Lake police station, where it was given food and water.

 The bird became the cynosure of all eyes at the police station; even those in the lock-up were eager for a glimpse. As news spread, outsiders, too, started arriving in droves to see the hawk, posing a problem for police. 

 One of the officers soon got an iron cage for the bird, while the others looked for food. Some bought peas and some even tried to gather insects.

 The wildlife wing of the state government was soon informed about the find.

 ?I had never seen a hawk so close. Though it was smaller than a fully-grown hawk, it has a sharp beak and claws. All of us at the police station felt satisfied at having done something for the bird. Left to itself, it would have died,? said an officer of Lake police station.

 The hawk was handed over to the officers of the wildlife wing when they arrived at the police station, much to the disappointment of the crowd that had gathered. 

 Deputy chief wildlife warden V.K. Yadav said: ?It is a Sparrow Hawk, a specie seldom seen in Calcutta. Other birds might have attacked and injured it. However, it is likely to recover soon.?

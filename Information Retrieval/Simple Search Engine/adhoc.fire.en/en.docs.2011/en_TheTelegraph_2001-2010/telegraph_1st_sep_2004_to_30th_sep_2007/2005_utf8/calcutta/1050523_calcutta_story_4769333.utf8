 In a bid to reach out to all children during the pulse polio campaign, the authorities have decided to take the programme to railway stations, bus stands and other transit points during the next round of immunisation in September.

 Over the past few months, two polio cases have been detected in the city. This follows the lull in 2003, when Bengal reported only one case.

 ?Railway stations, ferry ghats and parks are ideal places to convey a message to the people. We?ll run the immunisation campaign from there during the next phase,? said Dipankar Mukherjee, coordinator (eastern India) of WHO?s Polio Surveillance Programme.

 During the last round of immunisation, on May 15, more than 473,000 children were administered polio vaccine in the city. The figures in January, February and April were 463,930, 473,565 and 479,496, respectively. 

 ?Every round immunises a larger number of children than the previous one. May was an exception, probably because of the scorching heat,? Mukherjee said.

 Elaborating on how mass contact would be intensified in the subsequent rounds, Mukherjee said: ?We will undertake a major drive at Sealdah station. We plan to set up at least one booth on every platform, especially those where local trains are operated from.? Similar booths will be set up at amusement parks, ferry ghats and other transit points.

 However, there is another factor that prompted the authorities to carry the immunisation drive to mass transit points. Despite the success, there remain pockets where people refuse to vaccinate their children because of superstitions or wrong advice from a section of doctors.

 ?People in these areas have not yet responded to our programme. In Garden Reach and Topsia, several booths registered dangerously low turnouts on May 15,? said Atanu Mukherjee, officer-on-special duty (health), Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 

 ?Besides, there are some paediatricians who administer the polio vaccine privately and persuade parents not to take their children to the booths,? he added.

 Mukherjee said the immunisation drive would lose its purpose unless all children are vaccinated at the same time. When a child is vaccinated at a doctor?s chamber, he/she is out of danger. If the polio virus enters the body, it will not affect the system but will survive inside, making the child a carrier. 

 ?The virus, at one point of time, will come out through stool and can infect other children. The possibilities of infection can be eliminated only if all children are vaccinated simultaneously. The virus can?t survive in the air for more than five days,? Mukherjee said.

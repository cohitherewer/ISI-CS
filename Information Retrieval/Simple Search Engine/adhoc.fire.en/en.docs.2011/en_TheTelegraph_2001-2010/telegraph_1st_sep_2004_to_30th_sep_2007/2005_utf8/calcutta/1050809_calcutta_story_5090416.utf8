 Govt dumps clean-air date, again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Deadlines are meant to be missed when the Bengal government is acting out the farce of combating auto-emission. 

 Living up to its go-slow-on-green fuel reputation, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government on Monday pushed back yet another deadline. Unable to keep the August 31 date for conversion of auto-rickshaws to LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), it has been extended to December 31. 

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Monday: ?If they are unable to keep the December 31 deadline, we shall give them another two months. But autos have to be converted to LPG to check the pollution level.?

 The government had earlier announced that commercial vehicles registered before 1990 would not be allowed to ply on city roads. The ban is scheduled to come into effect after December 31.

 Officers in the transport department said the minister may have extended the deadline for autos running on LPG keeping in mind the last date for conversion of commercial vehicles on December 31. 

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said he had not yet heard of the minister?s decision. ?A discussion is on if the deadline for autos can be extended,? said an officer of the department. 

 Shyamal Chakraborty, former transport minister and general secretary of the Citu-affiliated West Bengal Road Transport Workers? Federation, was all compassion for the well-being of the three-wheelers rather than the city?s lungs. ?Auto-owners, mostly unemployed youth, will get at least five months to convert their vehicles,? he added.

 Chakraborty said he would have a dialogue with the transport minister to ensure some assistance from financial institutions for auto-owners. 

 In a related development, Bengal Bus Syndicate, the largest body of private bus-owners, reiterated on Monday that it would withdraw all its vehicles if the government decided to phase out pre-1990 commercial vehicles. 

 ?We shall go for a bigger movement soon after the Pujas,? warned Swarnakamal Saha, president of the syndicate, adding: ?About 70 per cent of the 7,500-odd vehicles are pre-1990.?

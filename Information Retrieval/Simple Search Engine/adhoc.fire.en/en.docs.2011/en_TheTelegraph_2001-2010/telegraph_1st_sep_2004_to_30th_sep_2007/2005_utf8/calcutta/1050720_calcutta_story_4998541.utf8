 Cosmetic cry to conquer time

 It may be impossible to stop, but city women and men have woken up to the fact that something can be done to hide the telltale effects of time.

 Ageing and its unwanted symptoms have become a major target of consumers seeking beauty therapies, reveal industry professionals.

 The most common cosmetic concerns are anti-ageing, skin lightening and pigmentation, said Sneha Sriram, dermatologist and assistant medical practitioner of Kaya Skin Advisory at a recent talk show.

 As for treating these, every consumer follows a simple principle. They want something that works well, does not hurt and costs less, explained doctor Deirdre Hare from the Candela Corporation, Massachusetts, in town for the chat.

 There has been an interesting shift in the mindset of women who, till now, would have questioned the need to look good for themselves. These days, they realise investing in themselves is not a sign of vanity but part of a regular skincare regimen, added Sriram.

Age no bar

 Dissatisfaction with appearance has become widespread. Thirty per cent of adults the world over indicate they would change something about their looks, while an increasing percentage of the population aged above 45 years, including men, will have a substantial impact on the aesthetic marketplace, pointed out Sriram.

 Common anti-ageing treatments are photo-facials, facelifts and Botox. People want to look good. That is their primary concern. They enter a skin clinic to improve their looks in some way or the other, stressed Hare. 

 The feather lift, also known as thread or curl lift, is another new and popular anti-ageing treatment in the US. Done under local anaesthesia, threads with cogs are inserted under the skin and muscle and pulled to give a lift. 

 If wrinkle removal, crows feet and stress baggage like dark circles and blemishes fall under the category of anti-ageing, its a big thing with people under 40 years, agreed Rutu Tawade, manager, Solace.

Botox buzz

 There are many reasons why men and women are opting for Botox these days ? theres virtually no recovery time involved, it costs a fraction of a forehead lift and its almost as easy as getting a facial done, said Sriram.

 Many facial wrinkles occur when we make repeated facial expressions. Botox relaxes the tiny facial muscles that cause expression lines, leaving the overlying skin smooth and unwrinkled. Because of muscle lines, the wrinkles gradually smoothen out and new creases are prevented from forming, she added. 

Plump up

 If you had only heard about things like lip implants, such procedures are now within the Calcuttans easy grasp.

 Plumping indicates increased volume to those areas of the face which tend to cause sagging or loss of youthful contours, said a Kaya spokesperson.

 These problems are commonly found in the cheek, chin and lip areas and occur due to loss of volume in collagen depletion, acids and water. 

 Fillers are used for skin plumping and can be of three types ? temporary (lasts less than a year), semi-permanent (lasts up to two years) and permanent (lasts more than two years).

Skin deep

 Pigmentation is a very common problem for Indian skin due to the climate, pollution and other toxins. Young people above the age of 30 are flocking towards anti-pigmentation treatments that include toners, micro-dermabrasion, skin lightening and even glycolic peels, said Rita Mohan of Transcend, the salon at Tollygunge Club.

 As for the treatment, there is no one prescribed method for treating pigmentation since everyones skin responds differently.

 If preventive methods are a concern, sunscreen is a must. Its shocking how people in India still dont realise the value of sunscreen and how harmful UV rays can be for the skin, she observed.

 Young people should learn to take proactive/preventive measures to maintain healthy skin rather than wait to go in for a treatment when something goes wrong. 

 Always remember that its so much easier to prevent rather than cure, said Hare.

Bulge battle

 When supple skin gives way to lumpy flesh, all eyes turn to cellulite eradication. People are simply obsessed about getting rid of that excess cellulite from the obvious trouble spots and finding all kinds of ways to do that. As always, its the non-ablative procedures that are greeted with the maximum enthusiasm, revealed Hare.

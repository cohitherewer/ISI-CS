 Book, blockbuster boom together

 - Film release fans novel sales, bestsellers scripted with eye on celluloid

 If many a blockbuster is born of books, many a book-sale boom is borne by blockbusters. Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire may have not set the city box-office on fire, but it sure has sparked a fresh sales spurt in the J.K. Rowling series. And sales of author Arthur Golden?s Memoirs of a Geisha have picked up ?dramatically? in anticipation of director Rob Marshall?s December release, starring Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi.

 ?The movie-book relationship is getting bigger and better. Every time a film releases, the original novel gets a fresh impetus,? says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword. ?A Lord of the Rings and a Harry Potter invariably sell more when the movie hits the theatres.?

 Sometimes the impact is not that direct. Mario Puzo?s Godfather sold big when Sarkar did well at the box-office. Helen Keller?s autobiography The Story of My Life was in ?huge demand? when Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black hit multiplexes.

 Comics, too, benefit from big-screen blitzkrieg. ?Spiderman and Batman comics sell more when their movie versions are in town,? says Gautam Jatia of Landmark. ?Pokemon Annual became a big draw when Pokemon was shown on TV.?

 If in Hollywood, bestsellers are often scripted with the big-screen adaptation in mind (read, John Grisham and Stephen King), Bollywood, too, has its own dual-demand tale to tell. Mangal Pandey ? Brave Martyr or Accidental Hero? did brisk business when the Aamir Khan magnum opus hit theatres. 

 Weeks before that, people queued up for a copy of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge when Raj and Simran?s love story was recorded in print to mark Week Number 500 of the Aditya Chopra blockbuster.

 Some times, it?s a deliberate ploy by publishers to make the most of a movie release. The translated version of Parineeta, which had the Saif-Vidya-Sanjay movie poster as the cover, soon became a must buy. Says Malobika Chaudhuri, English translator of the book: ?The big stars generated a lot of curiosity around the original novel and lots of non-Bengalis picked up the translated book after watching the movie.?

 Next on the screen-and-shelf line are classics Pride And Prejudice and Debi Choudhurani and bestsellers like Da Vinci Code and Tintoretor Jishu.

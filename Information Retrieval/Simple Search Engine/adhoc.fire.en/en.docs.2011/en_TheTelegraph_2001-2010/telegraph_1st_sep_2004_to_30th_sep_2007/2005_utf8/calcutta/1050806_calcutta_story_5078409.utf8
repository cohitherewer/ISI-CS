 Heat on ceremony houses

 - POLLUTION ORDER FLOUT

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nearly 5,000 ceremony houses in Calcutta and adjoining districts have been put under the scanner by the state pollution board, which shut down one such house in north Calcutta on Thursday for violation of norms.

 Weddings and other social functions were barred at Santaneer, a ceremony house at Ariadaha, on the northern fringes of the city, after the owners failed to abide by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board?s directive on checking noise and air pollution.

 The ban was the first such against a ceremony house in Calcutta. The board also urged CESC to discontinue power supply to 50/1, AC Banerjee Road, under Belghoria police station.

 The officer-in-charge of the police station has been asked by the board to execute the closure order immediately. He has also been instructed not to allow the owner of the house to rent it out for social functions in future.

 The board issued the ban order after hearing the case on July 27. The representatives of the house-owners attended the hearing. They failed to explain why they had not implemented the pollution control measures suggested by the board.

 The owners of the house had been asked to use generator sets with in-built capacity to check air pollution. The board had also directed the owners not to allow patrons to use loudspeakers at volumes higher than the permissible limit.

 In addition, the owners were supposed to clean the premises and remove garbage after every social function. They, however, did not take measures to honour any of the directive of the board, stated a board official.

 ?We had been receiving numerous complaints against the ceremony house since February 2002. Polluting generators were used indiscriminately, even when there was no disruption in power supply. The owners also did not bother to take the garbage to the nearby vat after social functions. On top of that, loudspeakers were used beyond the permissible limits. Residents of the area were fed up with the house,? explained a senior board official on Friday.

 Senior law officer of the board Biswajit Mukherjee, who issued the closure order, said: ?We had instructed the owners of the house to use modern generator sets with the capacity to check air pollution. But they refused to listen to us. They had been using ordinary generator sets for illuminating the building during social functions, causing a great deal of air pollution in the process. This had been going on for the past three years. Our repeated requests were ignored.?

 Mukherjee added that the board had made it mandatory for ceremony houses to follow certain pollution control norms. ?We have asked the owners to use modern generator sets that do not add to the pollution. We have also imposed a ban on playing loudspeakers beyond the permissible limit and bursting of crackers during functions. We will take steps against owners of the ceremony houses if they violate any of our three main guidelines,? Mukherjee asserted.

 The silver lining

 The date was June 1, 1980. CNN signed on the air as the world?s first 24-hour news network. The single domestic network was available in fewer than two million US households. 

 Today, CNN International is available in over 178 million households worldwide while its combined networks and services reach more than two billion people in over 200 countries.

 After 25 years of news-breaking journey, CNN is in the news today as it turns 25. This silver celebration is being commemorated with a three-day conference of journalists, world leaders and CNN executives. The network is hosting the 2005 World Report Conference in Atlanta from May 30 to June 1. CNN?s crack reporters Christiane Amanpour, Jim Clancy, Wolf Blitzer, Zain Verjee, Ralitsa Vassileva, Octavia Nasr, Michael Holmes and Anderson Cooper will join other international journalists and world leaders to discuss issues in the news today. 

 Former US President Jimmy Carter, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Pakistani chief executive General Pervez Musharraf, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Indonesian President Susilo Yudhoyono are among the international leaders joining the conference either in person, via satellite or through a taped address. Musicians Bono and Ricky Martin and author Deepak Chopra will also participate.

For those of us back home, a feast will be on offer on Wednesday ? a front-row seat to history with a recounting of the biggest news events from the past 25 years as told by the newsmakers and journalists who lived through them on Defining Moments: Stories that Touched Our Lives, airing at 6.30 pm. 

 The one-hour programme includes eyewitness recollections of journalist Clancy who rewinds to the revolution of the Eastern Bloc and tales of a wall that once divided the world, as it came crashing down. CNN also captured haunting images in the hot spots of Bosnia and Rwanda; bringing crimes against humanity to light with CNN?s chief international correspondent Amanpour who recounts the ethnic rivalries in Kosovo. Hosted by CNN anchor Jonathan Mann, it highlights ambitious endeavours and fatal flights with the explosions of the Challenger and the Colombia. 

 ?As CNN celebrates 25 years of groundbreaking news coverage and technical innovation, we reminisce its illustrious history. It is a history that is shaped every day as CNN continues to stretch the boundaries of television reporting and expands, not just its services, but the ability to gather the news from the most remote parts of the world,? remarks Chris Cramer, managing director, CNN International. 

 The anniversary message? In the moments that mattered the most, CNN was there.

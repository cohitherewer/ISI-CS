Colour coding of the vehicles of senior police officers 

to prevent their misuse will be an innovative way of dealing with a long-standing 

problem (Colour code for the cops, January 21). 

 Calcutta Police, especially commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, deserves credit for coming up with the bold idea. 

 If it is implemented, the colour of his or her vehicle would isolate a senior police officer from the crowd. That would go a long way in increasing their accountability. Officers will be forced to think several times before they use their vehicle for personal work. 

 Only time will tell how successful the commissioner is in bringing the idea to fruition. There will be pressure on him from a section of the officers who have got used to misusing their official vehicles. 

 Colour coding of only 100-odd vehicles will not contribute a great deal to the saving of fuel, but at least it would be a beginning. Such a move will send the right message to officers who wield the baton by unfair means. 

 The problem of misuse of official vehicles being rampant at all levels of the bureaucracy, the government should consider colour coding of vehicles in all its departments. In fact, it urgently needs to do so, given the precarious situation of the state?s exchequer. 

Subhankar Mukherjee,

Borehat, Burdwan. 

The death of a young man while attempting to retrieve a ball from a manhole in Sukantanagar, Salt Lake, is shocking (Ball recovery turns fatal, January 20). Such incidents have happened in the past and were followed by empty assurances that all manholes would be covered. 

 Regular theft of manhole covers is the main reason behind such accidents. Therefore, mere replacement of manhole covers is not the remedy. Proper watch should be kept on them. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

The death of Surojit Bhattacharya after being trapped 

in a manhole at Salt Lake was tragic. The civic bodies need to be active to prevent 

more such deaths.

 Gone are the days when the Maidan was a pride of Calcutta (Green gripe on carve-up, January 20). Today, to fulfil the cultural aspirations of the residents, it is being made uglier by the day. And the government is solely to blame for that. 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road. 

The report ?Next stop, wasteland?, January 15, was 

timely. The Maidan is in shambles. Several parts of it are overrun by hoodlums 

and goons after nightfall. It is not surprising that people avoid the Maidan except 

during fairs. 

Bhupen Bose, 

Dum Dum Park. 

Apropos the report ?Army blueprint to save green?, 

January 18, it is sad that the Maidan is gradually losing its green cover. Political 

parties should refrain from holding rallies on the grounds. Following the directives 

of the high court, fairs on the Maidan should also be stopped immediately. 

Rabindra Nath Kar, 

Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

The efforts of NGOs and green activists to preserve 

the Maidan is proving to be futile (With no space to breathe, January 17). In 

the name of urbanisation, Calcutta?s lungs are witnessing a massacre of greenery. 

The only positive development has been the creation of ?Sal Pialer Bon? near the 

Press Club. 

Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 

Bandpur, Hooghly. 

It is a pity that the Maidan is being used as an open 

toilet (Next stop, wasteland, January 15). With fairs being organised on the stretch, 

public urinals definitely need to be constructed, but not at the expense of the 

greenery. I would request the army to take stern action against those responsible. 

Sumant Poddar, 

Kyd Street.

Apropos the report ?Court annuls demolition?, January 15, Chief Justice Altamas Kabir of Calcutta High Court deserves kudos for stopping the demolition of Bishop House. It would have been unfortunate if the heritage building was destroyed in the name of modernisation. 

Anil Kumar Sen,

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 

The commitment of school education minister Kanti Biswas to declare HS results by June 10, complying with the verdict of Supreme Court, is commendable (10+2 order to be in place this year, January 14). He has rightly refused the exemption of time privilege for declaring the results as other states would comply with the verdict. 

Sujit Kumar Sen Gupta,

Ghatakpara, Manirampore. 

It is great that the state government is planning to set up a calibration and testing unit to prevent tampering of taxi meters. (New unit to set taxi tickers right, January 17). One only hopes that the unit sees the light of the day. 

Diptimoy Ghosh,

Salt Lake. 

Apropos the report ?Surgeon with fake marksheet held?, January 13 , the only punishment I can think of for criminals like Salamat Ali who are accused of forging certificates is capital punishment. They are pests for society. 

Mayukh Goswami, 

Tobin Road. 

Apropos the photograph entitled ?Solidarity Wave?, February 3, South Point students handed over cheques for Rs 50 lakh and not a cheque for Rs 1 crore as mentioned in the caption. Also, of the contribution of Rs 50 lakh, Rs 40 lakh was meant for the Prime Minister?s National Relief Fund. 

Biswajit Matilal, 

South Point Education Society.

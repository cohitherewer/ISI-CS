The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Autos choke key artery 

 - Police vs CITU unions

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 THREE WHEELS AND ATTITUDE: Autorickshaws are a menace on the road, but the traffic police can do little to rein them in. A Telegraph picture

 Barrackpore Trunk (BT) Road has of late been widened, but traffic snarls continue because of recalcitrant autorickshaw and taxi drivers who, with the backing of their CITU-affiliated trade union, insist on parking their vehicles on the stretch between Shyambazar and Sinthee. 

 Such is the clout of these drivers that they openly defy the police when directed to clear the road of the vehicles ? many without licence ? parked in rows of three. 

 Recently, officers of the traffic police had a confrontation with the drivers when they tried to dismantle an illegal stand, and for once, the policemen were at the receiving end. The drivers abused and threatened the police when they tried to take action. Traffic department officers of the city police, subsequently, lodged a complaint with their superiors.

 ?Autorickshaw and taxi drivers demand that they be allowed to put up three stands here. A sergeant was beaten up when he tried to stop a vehicle from taking a wrong turn,? complained a senior officer of Shyambazar traffic guard. 

 In the past two months, autorickshaw and taxi drivers have gheraoed the traffic guard four times for long hours to press their demand. 

 C.V. Murlidhar, joint commissioner of traffic police, said that the department will take strong action against the illegal activities. ?I will discuss the problem with officers of the traffic guard. Nobody will be allowed put up a makeshift stand if our officers feel it will impede traffic movement in the area. ? he added.

 According to spokespersons of the Citu-backed union of autorickshaw drivers, three stands need to be set up on Cossipore Road, Phoolbagan More and near Aurobindo Setu. But traffic police object to their demand, ?as it will hamper traffic movement along the road. But they do not heed our objection and hang notice boards. Even when we remove these, they are back again,? said an official of the guard. 

 Police officers say whenever they try to slap fines on these drivers, they use abusive language and prevent police vehicles of the traffic guard from entering or leaving their posts. ?Unless we tackle the problem, it will spin out of control, as it had happened in Ultadanga,? the officer said.

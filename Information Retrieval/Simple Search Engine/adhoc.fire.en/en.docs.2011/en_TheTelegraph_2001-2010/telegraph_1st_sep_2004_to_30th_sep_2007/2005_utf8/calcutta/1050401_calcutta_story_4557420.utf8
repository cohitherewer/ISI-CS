 The government on Thursday unveiled plans for the development of Howrah town and its adjoining areas.

 Replying to a question in the Assembly by leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the government has already taken up two major township projects in West Howrah and Dankuni. Programmes have also been planned to improve infrastructure, including roads, drinking water supply and sewerage, the minister added.

 ?Realising the importance of Howrah and the need of the hour, we have taken up the Howrah Rejuvenation Programme with financial assistance from the Department for International Development,?? Bhattacharya told the House.

 He said that both government and private agencies would implement the projects. Joint ventures would also be undertaken. 

 Bhattacharya revealed the government?s plans to merge the West Howrah and Dankuni townships, as they are close to each other.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said four industrial parks ? foundry park, rubber park, chemical park and garment park ? would be built in Howrah.

 The government has been under pressure for some time from various quarters, including the CPM, to adopt a plan for the development of Howrah town and the areas around it.

 A Rs 800-crore package has been prepared for the development of infrastructure, including drinking water supply, sewerage system, solid waste management, storm water drainage, traffic and transportation, construction of residential, industrial and commercial estates, and improvement of markets. 

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will implement the projects in collaboration with the Howrah Municipal Corporation and Howrah Improvement Trust.

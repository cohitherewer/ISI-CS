The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tragedy in railing collapse at studio

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Last autumn, Bollywood star Sameera Reddy had made a pretty picture leaning against the first-floor railing at the Bharat Laxmi Studio, shooting for Kalpurush. On Friday, leaning against the same railing proved fatal for a junior artiste at the Prince Anwar Shah Road studio.

 The accident occurred on the sets of Mushkil Ashan, a tele-serial on the floors adjacent to Navina cinema, around 11.30 am .

 As actors Kunal Mitra and Koneenica Banerjee were readying for a shot, the railing gave way, sending 24-year-old Binod Hari tumbling down from the first-floor balcony.

 Binod slipped into a coma and was rushed to Calcutta Medical Research Institute.

 ?The patient was brought in unconscious. He had suffered serious head injuries. He is on life-support system and is in no position to be operated upon,? doctors attending on Binod told Metro.

 Santu Sarkar, a camera attendant, escaped with minor injuries.

 The Tollywood studio mishap comes close on the heels of a makeshift pond with a glass top exploding, sending shards flying, at Technician?s 2, also on Prince Anwar Shah Road. That was on October 24 and Rachana Banerjee had suffered foot injuries but little else. Binod Hari was not as lucky.

 Actress Koneenica, a witness to the tragedy, recounted: ?Binod was playing one of the many photographers and reporters who come to hound me. We were getting ready for the shot and he was trying to focus his camera on me. None of us noticed him heading for the balcony. Then, suddenly, the railing collapsed and he went crashing to the ground??

 With fear striking everyone in the studio, the spotlight was back on the lack of safety standards in what is now a bustling studio para.

 ?Safety is an area of major concern for the people in this profession, more so the technicians. A mishap can occur anytime and claim somebody?s life, like this morning,? said veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee, shooting for another tele-serial in the same studio.

 ?This is very sad, but one must realise that there are no permanent structures at a film studio. People should take extra precautions to avoid accidents,? said the caretaker of Bharat Laxmi.

 Scan on Howrah clinics

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to check medical malpractice, the government has initiated the biggest-ever crackdown on diagnostic centres and nursing homes in Howrah.

 ?A special team has been set up to ensure that all medical centres in Howrah adhere to the norms laid down by the West Bengal Clinical Establishments Act. We will take the help of the district administration and police in the drive,? said Sankar Saha, chief medical officer of health (CMOH), Howrah.

 The facilities offered by the medical establishments and the credentials of the doctors will be checked in the drive, the initial phase of which has already been completed.

 According to the CMOH, the town?s health department has received a number of complaints against medical centres and nursing homes.

 ?The irregularities include medical negligence, non-conformation to the Clinical Establishments Act and illegal sex-determination tests,? Saha said.

 According to him, the biggest concern of his department is the sex-determination tests. ?Sex determination is a non-bailable, cognisable offence that can attract up to five years? imprisonment and a fine up to Rs 10,000,? he asserted.

 Special permission is required to instal a USG machine, CT scan machine and an MRI machine, which can be used for sex-determination tests. 

 The manufacturers of the machines can?t sell them without verifying the permission of the health department. 

 A total of 72 medical centres have been allowed to use the diagnostic gadgets. ?But we are afraid that quite a number of diagnostic centres have illegally installed those machines,? said CMOH Saha.

 There are 390 registered medical centres and nursing homes in Howrah. 

 ?The number is misleading. According to our information, there are more than 100 establishments that are operating illegally,? the CMOH explained. 

 More than 15 nursing homes around Howrah town are on the health department?s suspicion list, he said.

Kashmiri cuisine was rarely heard of earlier, for cooks who inherited it from their forefathers would closely guard the magic potion. But it is finally emerging from its ivory tower and making its way to dining tables around town. For now, if you want a true taste of Kashmiri cuisine, driving down to The Kenilworth might not be a bad idea.

 A Kashmiri food festival is on at The Marble Room from January 15 to January 31. ?Kashmiri food is not part of our regular menu but we were compelled to start off with it due to the huge demand. Though the food is on the heavier side, we do have a client base for this cuisine during winter,? says Bipul Roy, F amp;B manager.

 ?We might also include some of the preferred dishes on our regular menu once the festival gets over,? he adds.

 The a-la-carte affair includes mouth-watering dishes like Tabakmaaz (mutton ribs shallow fried in ghee), Palak Goli (peas blended with spinach and pan-fried), and Kashmiri Veg Sheekh Kebab for starters.

 The main course has Gushtaba (finely pounded boneless mutton cooked with Kashmiri spices and curds), Rista (finely pounded boneless mutton with saffron), Mutton Rogan Josh (mutton sauted with cloves, cinnamon and Kashmiri chillies), Chicken Yakhni (boneless chicken cooked in white Kashmiri sauce with cloves, curds, milk and Kashmiri spices) and Dhaniwal Fish (boneless fish pieces cooked with coriander and saffron in Kashmiri sauce).

 Vegetarians can dig into Dum Aloo Kashmiri (deep fried potatoes simmered in red Kashmiri sauce), Raajma (red kidney beans soaked in red Kashmiri sauce), Kashmiri Handi (seasonal vegetables cooked in Kashmiri sauce) and Tsok Wangun (deep fried brinjals cooked in sour Kashmiri sauce).

 Do not forget to taste Kashmiri Pulao, Yakhni Pulao and Keema Pulao. And those with a sweet tooth must try the Phirni. Prices range between Rs 100 and Rs 250.

 Sizzling hot

 The Food Court in New Alipore is hosting the Smoke and Sizzle festival at its speciality Oriental stop, Oriental Wok. The one-and-a-half-year-old food multiplex stands at 850 Block P, New Alipore. It has three other restaurants: China Moon for authentic Schezwan and Cantonese cuisine, The Frontier Court for an Indian spread, Tarka for a taste of Punjab.

 ?We would be serving some memorable Chinese and Oriental sizzlers,? promises manager Sunil Manhori. Non-vegetarian sizzlers are Grilled Chicken with mushroom sauce, Chicken Alexandria (pan-fried whole breast of chicken stuffed with cheese and cooked with capsicum-flavoured white sauce) and Grilled Fish with Mushroom Sauce.

 Vegetarian sizzlers include Steak Arabiata (a burger steak served with red salsa), Cottage Cheese Shaslik (paneer, capsicum, onion, tomato, mushrooms with barbecue sauce) and Xian Favourite (mushrooms with chilli flakes and Hunan sauce). Prices range between Rs 145 and Rs 175.

 The festival will be on from January 15 to January 31, with sizzlers to be served during lunch and dinner hours.

 Roast right

 The winter chill might have given Calcutta the miss, but culinary experts at five-star addresses are busy dishing out winter delicacies. Ask Waterside Caf?, the 24-hour coffee shop at Hyatt Regency, why.

 ?Winter is the time for warm food, and roasts and wine are perfect for a winter lunch,? says executive sous chef Surinder M. Malhotra, who has carved out a ?straight from the oven? spread in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections.

 There is something for everyone in this new a-la-carte offering ? from Bekti Steak on a spinach mash with roasted potatoes to Chicken Breasts grilled with a stuffing of Indian spices and served with roasted wedges and mushrooms to Pork Chops served with glazed apples, turnips and baby carrot.

 The green brigade can choose between paneer and pumpkin, and also lasagna. The cottage cheese roasted over cajun and served with roasted potatoes is a must try.

 Priced between Rs 290 and Rs 490 minus taxes, the new dishes will be available at the coffee shop from January 15 till the end of the month, from 11 am to 11 pm.

 ?We intend to add the popular roasts from those that will be served at the festival to the main menu,? assures chef Malhotra.

 Peer pressure

 Peerless Inn, too, is sprucing up its seasonal menu. The Sheeter Bhojan Utsab at Aaheli, the Bengali speciality restaurant at the hotel, brings in a spread of Koi Machher Paturi, Palak diye Murgi, Nolen Gurer Sandesh, Gurer Rosogolla and much more for the entire month of January. The dishes are priced between Rs 80 and Rs 250.

 More winter grub is on offer at Nishidin, the coffee shop. A range of parathas to go along with endless pots of beverages include Keema Kaleji ka Paratha, Gosht Keema Paratha, Murg Noorjahani Keema Paratha, Afghani Paratha, Mughlai Paratha with Zafrani Murg and Cheese Paneer Keema Paratha.

 Vegetarians needn?t fret, either, for the muli (radish) and gobi (cauliflower) parathas are nice and stuffed. Kastoori Kebab is another hot option here, while Malai Kulfi is for those braving the chill. Prices range between Rs 85 and Rs 250, again.

 Finally, if Cantonese is your chosen dish, Jade Chicken and Shredded Lamb with Bamboo Shoot and Mushroom, now available at Bichitra, the multi-cuisine restaurant at Peerless Inn, should be worth a visit. The price range here is between Rs 120 and Rs 225.

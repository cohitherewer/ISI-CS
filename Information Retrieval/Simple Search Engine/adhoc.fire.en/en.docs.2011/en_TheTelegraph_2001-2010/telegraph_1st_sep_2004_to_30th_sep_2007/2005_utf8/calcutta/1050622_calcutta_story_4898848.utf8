 Great ditch by ally

 They may have parted ways on election eve, but post-poll, Subrata Mukherjee sounds much like the Mamata Banerjee of 2000. Electoral reverses faced by the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) have prompted Mukherjee to pin the blame on his Congress allies, just as Mamata had after defeat in the 2001 Assembly elections.

 ?It is humiliating that only four out of 38 candidates put up by the UDA won. Our candidates would have fared better had the Congress worked for them,? lamented Mukherjee. 

 Mamata had, in her time, said that aligning with the Congress had been a mistake.

 The UDA is now pointing fingers at the state Congress for ?betraying? Mukherjee and not seriously working with his Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha. 

 ?Barring one or two street-corner meetings, there was no campaigning,? said officials.

 Fortune favoured Congress in only a few wards in north and central Calcutta, controlled by former PCC chief Somen Mitra. It won in 15 out of 98 wards in the city, of which eight are located in Sealdah, Bowbazar, Burrabazar or Cossipore.

 Congress insiders claim party workers in the Tiljala-Topsia-Park Circus belt had joined forces with Trinamul to jeopardise the Mancha prospects. ?We did no work for the Mancha in Park Circus after Subrata convinced the PCC to put up Dipali Das as UDA nominee in ward 55, instead of Sabita Das, a genuine Congress candidate,? said a Congress functionary from Park Circus. Sabita?s victory is ?a slap in Subrata?s face?, he added.

 In south Calcutta, Pranab Mukherjee?s loyalists did not aid the UDA effort, either. In three wards around Rashbehari, Mancha nominees Mukherjee and Mala Roy, and Independent Debashish Kumar, won on their own steam.

 ?We shall shortly meet to discuss the outcome,? said PCC president Pranab Mukherjee over phone from Delhi. State Congress leaders felt the party suffered because of the ?overnight alliance? with Mukherjee and other expelled Trinamul MLAs and councillors.

 ?Poll results show that party workers and even some leaders have not accepted the manner in which we had hurriedly formed an alliance with Mukherjee,? said PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

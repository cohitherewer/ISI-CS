 Four suitors of same girl, one gets two bullets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barasat was the scene of a crime of passion earlier this month. Now, it is the turn of Baguiati, where four young men were involved in a bloody tussle for the love of a young woman on Sunday evening. 

 Arup Dutta, 28, was shot by two of his friends around 8.30 pm at Raghunathpur, under the Baguiati investigation centre of Rajarhat police station. 

 Later, police rushed Arup to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where the man?s condition is still stated to be critical.

 According to police, Arup, Shyamal, Uday and Pappu are friends and live in Baguiati and its adjacent areas. ?All four men had fallen for 23-year-old Lakshmi Das,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 Late on Sunday evening, members of a club in Raghunathpur heard two gunshots. After a while, Arup ran into the club with blood smeared all over his clothes. ?He was screaming for help,? said Shyamal Saha, a member of the club. 

 The club members rushed Arup to a local nursing home. But it denied Arup admission and requested the club members to inform the police about the incident. 

 ?Fortunately, at that point of time, a police jeep was passing by the nursing home and we hailed it,? Saha said.

 Police took Arup to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was admitted.

 ?Shyamal and Uday had discovered Arup and Lakshmi in a compromising position behind a bush in a field. They immediately pumped two bullets into Arup. One bullet hit the man on the right side of his chest and the other entered his lower abdomen,? said Kumar.

 After the shooting, the three friends and the woman bolted. ?Shyamal and Uday were arrested on Monday. But the girl and Pappu are absconding. A manhunt has been launched,? the police superintendent said. 

 Police said of late, their relationship with the same woman had created bad blood among the four friends. Earlier, they had fallen out over their common love interest. ?Shyamal had threatened Arup with dire consequences unless he broke off with Lakshmi. Arup did not pay any heed to the threat and continued to get closer to the girl. This drove Shyamal mad,? said police.

 The firing has added to the fear in the area. Only a few days ago, businessman Sushil Saha was gunned down barely a km away from the spot where Arup was shot. 

 On April 22, Suman Basu, an engineering student, was shot dead by a contract killer in Barasat. Investigation revealed Suman?s friend Ayan Banerjee had developed a crush on Suman?s girlfriend Sagarika Hazra and decided to get Suman out of the way. He hired Suman Samaddar, alias Bachcha, a 17-year-old contract killer. 

 Bachcha shot Suman dead near Govinda Barrack, under Barasat police station, while Suman was returning home after meeting Sagarika. Three men were arrested in this connection. 

 ?We don?t dare to go out in the evening,? said Saha, a resident of Raghunathpur.

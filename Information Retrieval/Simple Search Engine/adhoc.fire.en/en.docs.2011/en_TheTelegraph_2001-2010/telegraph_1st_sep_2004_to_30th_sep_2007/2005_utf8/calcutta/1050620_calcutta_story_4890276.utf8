The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chants added to rig veda

 - Party activists devise newer amp; ingenious methods to swing the polls and deprive genuine electors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 OLD METHODS IN TIMES OF NEW TECHNIQUES: False voters with their faces covered queue up at a Salt Lake booth on Sunday. Picture by Aranya Sen 

 Rigging is not new to Calcutta. But with every poll, party workers discover more and more ingenious ways of depriving voters of their right to exercise their franchise. Sunday?s elections, as witnessed by Metro, was no different.

 4A polling station at Hasrat Mohini High School, Garden Reach: A group of 20 youths, all CPM activists, are rendering a ?noble? service by escorting voters in and out of the three booths. Such is their zeal to help voters that a middle-aged woman, with the indelible ink on her left forefinger and her name ticked off the register, does not know whom she has voted for. The woman is escorted to one of the booths, where officials and election agents duly complete all formalities. But this is as far as she is allowed to proceed.

 A man, stationed in front of the electronic voting machine, punches a button ?the one bearing the CPM candidate?s name ? on the woman?s behalf. Voter after voter goes through the charade as party activists freely cast false votes.

 4Burtola Girls? High School, near Metiabruz: It?s past noon and the policemen on duty are at lunch. Though polling is on, the queues don?t move. A closer look reveals that the CPM polling agent is challenging all those not carrying their voter?s identity cards, even though they hold other valid documents, like a driving licence or a ration card.

 With arguments and counter-arguments taking up close to 10 minutes per voter, many of those at the end of the queue, uncertain about how long they will have to wait in the sweltering heat, leave the polling station. Sources say their votes will be cast by others. 

 4Swamiji Vidyapith, 122, BB Ganguly Street: Joint commissioner (armed police) Zulfiquar Hassan is at the gate with a posse of policemen at 2.30 pm, busy ensuring free and fair polls. Suddenly, a group of boys nearby start fighting. 

 Hassan and his team leave to chase the boys. The commotion and police action last 20 minutes. But in this span, a group of youths enter the polling station, left unguarded, and take over the operations. 

 Police later found that close to 40 false votes had been cast and the fight was staged to distract them.

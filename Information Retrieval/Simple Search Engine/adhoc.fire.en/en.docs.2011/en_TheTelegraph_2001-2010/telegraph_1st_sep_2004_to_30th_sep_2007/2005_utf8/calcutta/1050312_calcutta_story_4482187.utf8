The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gudiya back home, on pavement

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A week after she was mauled by a pet Alsatian in the house where she worked as a domestic help, Gudiya left hospital on Friday to return home ? on a pavement in Agarpara ? with her mother.

 The eight-year-old still bears the wounds of her ordeal on the evening of March 4, when she was attacked by the dog, after her employer, teacher Swapna Chanda, had locked the front door of the Agarpara home from outside and left for evening classes.

 By the time Gudiya was rescued by neighbours, she had been bitten on her face and back.

 The girl was at AMRI Hospitals for a week, before being allowed to leave with mother Shanti Subba on Friday afternoon.

 A team of officials from Khardah police station, with an authorisation letter from superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Parveen Kumar, took custody of Gudiya.

 ?We have recorded the statements of both the mother and the child,? said police superintendent Kumar, also thanking the hospital for waiving all treatment costs for the child.

 Gudiya and her mother reached Khardah in a police jeep on Friday evening. But the girl will be taken to the police station again on Saturday for a judicial magistrate of Barrackpore court to record her confidential statement, since police had started a suo motu case.

 ?She was declared clinically fit after receiving sustained treatment and so we released her,? said S.B. Purakayastha, president of AMRI Hospitals.

 On Thursday, Shanti Subba reached the south Calcutta hospital and stayed on with the child.

 She told the hospital authorities that she had seven other children to feed and that they lived in abject poverty on an Agarpara footpath.

 An NGO followed up on this claim and found that Subba was speaking the truth. ?The organisation informed us that Gudiya?s father Roshan Jacob, a footpath-dweller, was suffering from tuberculosis,? Purakayastha said. 

 ?We have conducted a test on the girl to find out whether she, too, has contracted the disease. The result will be known in four days and the girl has to be brought here for another check-up,? he added. 

 NGOs and other institutions, eager to lend a helping hand, continued to queue up at the hospital on Friday.

 Sister Cyril, principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, has expressed her willingness to take Gudiya into her home for streetchildren and the destitute, if her parents did not take her with them.

 Till Friday, Gudiya was firmly in the spotlight, with even chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressing concern and urging the hospital to take special care of her.

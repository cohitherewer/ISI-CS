The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On an optimistic note

 Till not long ago a familiar inhabitant of every neighbourhood, the house sparrow had virtually become a symbol of domestic peace and tranquillity. The perky, gregarious and eternally busy little birds flew or hopped merrily about in small clusters in and around our homes, their soft, sweet chirrups leaving a melodious ring in the air. Now rarely sighted in the city, the unexpected presence of one arouses in Anuradha Shee pleasant memories of days gone by. These humble birds serve as the unlikely artistic inspiration behind The House Sparrows, her ongoing exhibition of paintings. Done in acrylic on canvas, they portray a life of serenity and calm contentment. Using rich, natural and earthy shades, Shee has recreated idyllic village vignettes and scenes from urban households. With a flair for drama and an eye for detail, she presents an idealistic vision of life, at the same time retaining in her paintings a realistic edge. Evoking images of domestic bliss, these essentially offer an optimistic, cheerful view of life.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Anuradha Shee

 When: Till November 27, 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, South Gallery

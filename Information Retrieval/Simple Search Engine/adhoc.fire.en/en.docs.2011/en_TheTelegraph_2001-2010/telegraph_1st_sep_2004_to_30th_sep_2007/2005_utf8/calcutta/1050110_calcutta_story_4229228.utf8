 Folk strokes

 Mithila or Madhubani paintings are born of centuries-old folk tradition, in which women decorated their homes with figures and motifs painted in bright colours. Traditional Images in Mithila Folk Paintings is an attempt to highlight the different traditional (like bharni, kachni) and emerging (like gobar, godana) styles of this ancient art form. Usually created on the occasion of feminine rituals, specially life-cycle rites, the paintings represent Hindu gods and goddesses like Rama-Sita, Shiva-Parvati, Radha-Krishna, the incarnations of Vishnu, and symbols of fertility and prosperity like bride and groom, sun and moon, lotus, parrots, elephants. Featuring works of renowned Mithila art practitioners Jamuna Devi, Sita Devi, Jagadamba Devi, Krishnakant Jha, Bhagvati Devi, Chano Devi and Dulari Devi, among others, the exhibition is curated by Dr Neel Rekha.

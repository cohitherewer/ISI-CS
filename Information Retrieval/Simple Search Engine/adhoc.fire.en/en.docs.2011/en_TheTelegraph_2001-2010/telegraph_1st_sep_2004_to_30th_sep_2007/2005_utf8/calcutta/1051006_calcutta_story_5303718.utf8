 Plant a substitute for diesel 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 To cut down on pollution in Calcutta, the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency is planning to produce bio-diesel from jetropha plants. 

 The plant is locally known as verenda. The agency is presently discussing the production of bio-diesel from it with IIT Kharagpur and a private concern. Production is expected to start soon.

 The agency believes that with prices of conventional fuel on the rise, bio-diesel, which will be comparatively cheap, can find a ready market. 

 ?We have already briefed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about the product, and he has expressed his pleasure. He asked us to go ahead with the project and assured all possible help,? said Santipada Gan Chowdhury, director of the agency.

 ?We are growing jetropha plants on an experimental basis in Energy Park, off EM Bypass. We plan to use jetropha oil to light up the park during Diwali,? he added. 

 The bio-diesel project is expected to generate employment. Farmers can grow jetropha trees on fallow land and sell them to oil-producing centres once the plants reach a height of about 6 ft. 

 Jetropha is of two types ? white and red. While the red variety grows by itself, white jetropha has to be cultivated. Bio-diesel can be extracted only from the white variety, which grows best in Purulia and Bankura.

 Jetropha seeds are not expensive and the tree can be cultivated without training or specialised care. It is not cattle-feed and, hence, can flourish unhindered in the villages.

 An expeller will be used to extract a glycerine-rich liquid from a grown jetropha. On purification, the liquid will yield bio-diesel, which will be purer than conventional diesel and also non-polluting, said the agency officials.

 ?We will approach the railways and shipping companies, which use a lot of diesel. If they switch to bio-diesel, then our product will get a sizeable share of the market straight away,? Gan Chowdhury signed off.

 He has been described as ?one of the most learned and daring voices on the global literary scene?, and his book Ka as ?the very best book about Hindu mythology that anyone has ever written?. But Roberto Calasso is a great deal more than an expert on Hindu mythology.

 For one, he is an expert on Greek mythology too, though his famous book on the subject, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, reads less like an academic work and more like a novel.

 Calasso goes boldly where many have faltered, and recreates ?the morning of our world? almost effortlessly from the vast tangle of myths, be they Greek or Indian.

 But synthesis is not among Calasso?s aims. ?In fact, my effort in Ka was to keep the tellingly different, and even opposite, elements of the stories, from the ancient Rigveda to the relatively modern Puranas, and write a narrative in layers,? says Calasso, hours after touching down from Patna and Bodh Gaya. 

 ?Till now, Calcutta had been a significant gap in my travels to India,? says the Italian scholar, in town for The Telegraph Talks at GD Birla Sabhagar on Monday evening. 

 K, Calasso?s latest book on the works of Kafka, is already being counted among the most influential books of the year.

 But to talk about his books is to talk about only half of Roberto Calasso?s life. Adelphi, the Milan-based publishing house run by him, represents the fast disappearing phenomenon of a publisher who is also an intellectual and a novelist.

 ?Being a publisher and writer is a very difficult dual life to live,? asserts Calasso, particularly since most writers feel their publishers do not understand their work and most publishers consider writers to be blind to the demands of the book business.

 A large share of Adelphi publications are translations. In the list are Muriel Spark, Mordecai Richler, Milan Kundera and even two Indians in the children?s section. ?It helps that I read English, Spanish, German, French, not to mention Greek and Latin,? says Calasso with a grin.

 The man who cannot conceal his delight while saying that he has been translated into Hindi, and is soon to be available to Tamil readers, has just encountered the ?phenomenon of Lalu Prasad? in Patna. 

 Having been to the north and south during his previous trips to India, Calasso has heard a lot about ?Calcutta being the socio-cultural hub? of the country. Something he is sure to explore during this trip.

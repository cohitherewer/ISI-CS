The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

The week that was started with an excess of romance, 

moved on to melody and mad fans, and ended with a clampdown on the obscene screen. 

As a result, bar-side chatter this weekend promises to be spicy fare. If you have 

been out of the loop, here?s your last chance to brush up quick?

Flick side

As the clean-up-or-clear-out message is delivered 

to the entertainment industry, nightclub culture as we know it also comes under 

serious threat. Discos were making hay with the ?item girls? reproducing their 

stunning stuff on bar-tops and dance floors across the country. So here is complaint 

number one for the evening: if the morality police stop steam from hitting the 

screen, your night time entertainment will be in for a quick chill.

Nagma natter

The stars came under a more direct police scanner, 

too. Monsoon Wedding?s P.K. Dubey, Vijay Raaz, turned out to be in possession 

of far more than a flower for his ladylove, when he was detained in Dubai by the 

police. But that paled in comparison with the charge levelled against Nagma, who 

allegedly has links with the omnipresent D-gang. There is also some confusion 

about whether the Baaghi Nagma is to blame or another south Indian actress 

by the same name. But since when did you let such petty doubts get in the way 

of a good gab?

Music mantra

If you think you?ve had enough steam and sleaze, try 

something more sunny. Here we go again is not just what Norah Jones was 

happily thinking when she stepped on stage to receive her golden gramophone the 

second year running, it was the song ? a collaboration with the late, legendary 

Ray Charles ? that bagged the record of the year award. Sunrise, from her 

second solo album, also won her top honours in the best female pop vocal performance 

category. Time to raise a toast, to the tune of some mellow, melting music.

Tennis tattle

Just leave Sania alone; let her play in peace. Those 

are the words on the lips of many a tennis fan, in the wake of the bubbly teen 

being hounded by hungry groupies. Will her wave of popularity be less intrusive 

in Siliguri, we will all have to wonder out loud. Sourav and Bhaichung will, for 

once, take a backseat, as all three big-league sporting stars auction merchandise 

at a tsunami fundraiser in north Bengal. Here?s looking at you, kid?

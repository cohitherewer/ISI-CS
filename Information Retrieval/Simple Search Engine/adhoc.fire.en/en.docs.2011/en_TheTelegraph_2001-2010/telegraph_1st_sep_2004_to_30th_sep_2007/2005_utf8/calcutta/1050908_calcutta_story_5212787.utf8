 A moment from Saptapadi: Timeless appeal

 For those who want to stay away from pandal-hopping till late in the night, there?s a treat on the small screen this October. A flashback to Tollywood?s evergreen hero is in the pipeline on ETV Bangla. Along with Arjoe Entertainment, producer of Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Mando Meyer Upakhyan, the channel is launching Oti Uttam, one of two tributes to Mahanayak. 

 Oti Uttam will be a series of 104 telefilms, adapted from some of Uttam Kumar?s hit films. To be aired in two phases, the series will focus on those films which have scripts based on works from Bengali literature. The first phase will be kicked off on October 1 at 9.30 pm, with a bouquet of 52 films. 

 ?Uttam Kumar?s charisma remains unparalleled even 25 years after his death. Even the new generation is very much interested in his works. So we thought of adapting some of his films for television and recreating the magic,? said a spokesperson for Arjoe Entertainment.

 Uttamsuri, the other show, will be a talent hunt for budding actors who can match up ? to whatever extent ? to the legacy of Uttam Kumar. Three fresh faces, selected through the search, will get the opportunity to show their mettle in the Oti Uttam telefilms.

 To participate in Uttamsuri, aspirants need to apply to Arjoe Entertainment by September 10. The hunt will be beamed on ETV Bangla on September 24.

 Halle Berry: Worth a watch

 If you?ve ever felt lost and disillusioned and found your way back, this is the movie for you. Join an all-star cast in a touching and poignant movie about politics, passions and principles in Bulworth on Sunday, September 11, 12.25 pm, on STAR Movies. United States Democratic senator Jay Bulworth has become completely disillusioned with all the lying, cheating and money-grubbing aspects of politics. 

 To prove a point to the world, he hires a contract out on his own life, but decides that before he is killed he is going to ruin his reputation and alert people to the shabbery of politics by delivering racist and hate-filled speeches to the public. 

 That is, until he falls in love with a black woman. Directed by Warren Beatty, Bulworth is powered by a star cast. Beatty is Jay Bulworth, backed by Oscar-winner Halle Berry and Christine Baranski (of Chicago fame). 

 Shekhar Suman and Navjyot Sidhu: Funny times

 BBC World has announced the new Global Indian research study, its biggest ever syndicated research project in India, aimed at understanding an emerging group of influencers ? internationally-minded Indians taking an active interest in the wider world. 

 The three-phased study, conducted over a year, will take an in-depth look at international Indians, their lifestyle, attitudes and consumption patterns, and will also shed light on the global topics they are concerned about. 

 Says Jeremy Nye, head of research and planning, BBC World: ?This research is intrinsically about India, a celebration of its openness, in terms of the interests of its people. This ground-breaking study will give us a chance to understand better the global Indians who we believe will emerge as influencers.? 

 The first phase of this study, conducted between February and April 2005 through interviews in six cities, focused on developing detailed profiles of the global Indian with the objective of understanding the individual.

 The second phase will quantify the population of global Indians and also unearth their media and consumption patterns. The third and final phase of the research will be undertaken to profile an equally important yet unexplored affluent sub-group within this category ? the international business traveller.

 Four of the six finalists of STAR One?s The Great Indian Laughter Challenge will be hosting one episode each of the show that started on September 5. The show will open with a stand-up act by the four finalists. 

 Catch the final act on Thursday, with Raju Srivastav and his jokes, at 10.30 pm, for the inimitable skits, gags, stand-up acts and even a typical Bollywood-style song-and-dance.

 Fusion is the flavour of food and music

 Musician and foodie NONDON BAGCHI chews on the word ?fusion? ? a common adjective in the realm of music and food today.

 In the parlance of the musical fraternity, ?fusion? is a dodgy word that triggers off a host of mixed reactions. Purists take umbrage at the very mention of it. ?Fusion? Confusion!? they declare righteously. 

 At the other end of the scale, there are those who maintain that if music is a reflection of life, it must change and develop with the times. And, with globalisation and cross-cultural energies in one big melting pot brimming over, it is inevitable that East must meet West, and North, and South. 

 It actually started several decades ago with the interaction between Ravi Shankar and Yehudi Menuhin, which was a landmark in twentieth century music. In the 60s, the Beatles used sitar on the song Norwegian Wood, which was a direct result of George Harrison being a student of Ravi Shankar. The Rolling Stones used sitar on the song Paint it Black; just a few years later Ananda Shankar did a great version (on sitar) of The Stones? Jumping Jack Flash which was cut in a studio on the West coast of the US. He gave the melody a tantalisingly Indian lilt. 

 There has been no looking back. One of the best fusion bands of all time is Shakti with John McLaughlin on guitar, Zakir Hussain (tabla), L. Shankar (violin) and Vikku Vinayakram (ghatam). The African continent has produced some amazing music, especially from South and West Africa, taking their ethnic music and orchestrating it with brass section, guitars, bass, drums and percussion in a modern and dynamic way. Bangla Rock is also a serious movement that has spread far and wide. At its best, it is really very good, with melodies which are as rich and catchy as those ever composed, and with lyrics that reflect the wit and wisdom of a lively Bengali intellect. The vehicle is rock, from classic 60?s style to country to heavy metal to grunge. An intelligent and imaginative concept, teeming with possibilities.

 So what has all this got to do with food? Everything, says my old friend Pradip Rozario, chef and owner of KK?s Fusion, a restaurant right next to Swabhumi at 89C Narkeldanga Road. ?Fusion is everywhere; in fashion, in film, in music. You can?t get away from it.? A veteran of Calcutta?s culinary scene, Pradip put Italian food bang in the heart of south Calcutta 10 or 12 years ago at Kurry Klub on Sarat Bose Road (where you now get Mexican food as well) and his menu at KK?s reflects the same spirit of adventure. 

 Sitting in a private anteroom that he calls his kitchen-lab and talking about this and that, I watched Pradip whip up something typical of KK?s, though this is not yet on the menu. The cooking medium was olive oil with garlic soaked in it, and in this were saut?ed chopped onions, red and yellow bell peppers and chopped black olives. As soon as the aroma came through, he added pieces of boneless chicken and prawns that had been marinated for about an hour-and-a-half in olive oil, chopped garlic, chopped coriander, and cumin powder. When the meat and fish were about done, he added penne (a form of pasta), grated parmesan cheese and finally a dash of Indian makhani gravy (butter, cream, pureed tomatoes seasoned with green chillies, ginger, garlic paste and paprika). Not like anything I had tasted before, but quite delicious. They have a live kitchen at KK?s so even though this does not feature on the menu, they will cook this, and anything else you can think up, on the spot.

 Other interesting offerings are Chicken Chinese Kebab that is chicken tikkas marinated in Szechwan sauce (red chilli paste, onion, garlic and celery ? all chopped ? and tomato puree cooked in a wok), salt, pepper, five-spice powder and chopped coriander and grilled in a tandoor. You can get Paneer Makhani on a bed of steamed noodles, pasta stuffed with chicken tikka, coriander and cheese served with Oriental sauce, Pasta with Thai curry, Bengali style Lentil Risotto (an avatar of khichuri) served with fried fish and potatoes, accompanied by Szechwan sauce and many other audacious preparations. 

 though KK?s Global Kitchen ?? Lounge had many sceptics looking on, they say their fusion items, especially the pastas and kebabs, move the best. And it seems to be infectious. A glance at the new name at Saffron, the Indian outlet at The Park reveals items such as Fresh Asparagus baked with Masala Cream Cheese, Bell Pepper Samosas stuffed with Mushroom and Corn, and Flaming Daab Chingri which they describe as Classic Bengali Prawn curry cooked in coconut shell and flamb?d in your presence with malibu. 

 Having a chat with my students about fusion food ? the most obvious examples within their experience being pizzas with Indian toppings ? ?Yuck!? was Ahona?s reaction to paneer on pizza but when it comes to chicken tikka pizzas Jamshed said simply, ?I don?t know. It tastes good!?

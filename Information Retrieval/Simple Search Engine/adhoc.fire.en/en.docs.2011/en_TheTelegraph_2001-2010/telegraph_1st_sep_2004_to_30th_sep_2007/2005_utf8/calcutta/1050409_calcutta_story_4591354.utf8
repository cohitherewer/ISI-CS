The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hitched on high-end honeymoon

 - Calcutta couples snap up expensive tours for memorable togetherness

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Go hot-air ballooning in Australia, land on a farm in the outback and share a champagne breakfast with your lady love? Truly special honeymoons, worth a bundle, are being snapped up by Calcutta couples, more far than near. Whether Rs 2 lakh or Rs 20 lakh, at resorts, spas and cruises, in Arctic waters, on sunny beaches or in the mountains, the more exotic the better.

 No surprise, then, that Gainwell Travel and Leisure now has a speciality section just for high-end honeymooners. A Rs 2,000 consultation fee ? prior appointment is required ? is the start-off point. ?We do the research, prepare brochures and keep everything ready,? says Madhulika Saraf, director, Gainwell. ?The first sitting is the longest, when the most important decision of where to go is made.?

 The fancy frill with surprises thrown in is the clincher for couples? cake on the flight or an upgrade, champagne in the room or a luxury suite. The budget starts at about Rs 2.5 lakh. The most expensive trip booked at Gainwell is Rs 16 lakh to Australia and New Zealand, followed by Rs 15 lakh to South Africa. In the past year, the agency has sent over 60 couples on such luxury honeymoons. ?It?s a very lucrative business,? says MD Manoj Saraf.

 It?s a growing segment, confirms Sanjoy Sett, chairman, eastern region, Travel Agents Association of Eastern India, and MD of Globe Forex and Travels. The average budget for about two weeks is Rs 7 lakh per couple, says Manish Sood, director sales and marketing, Giananey Travels and Tours. ?The high-end numbers would be about 15 per marriage season. But what?s really growing fast is the middle segment, which spends about Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh on honeymoons. They?re willing to spend a little more for a memorable experience,? explains Sood.

 Pop picks include Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Alaskan cruise, Canadian Rockies, Caribbean cruise, Bahamas and Miami. New destinations are a top draw, too. 

 While the party island of Ibiza, in Spain, is making a splash at Gainwell, the Mediterranean is moving up the order at Discovery Travels and Tours. ?We just sent a couple on honeymoon to Istanbul and Ireland!? says Prashant Binnany, CEO of Discovery.

 Mela bar on Maidan

 Effective April, the Maidan is off limits to melas. The army has finally decided to put an end to fairs wreaking havoc on the green after its survey of the book fair ground on Tuesday.

 ?No fairs will be held on the Maidan between April and October this year,? said Major- General Z.U. Shah, general officer commanding, Bengal Area, who led the army team, along with officials of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, on Tuesday morning.

 Fair organisers obtain a no-objection certificate from the army, he said. ?Though we have not been hesitant to issue permission in the past, we will be very strict about certificates from now on,? stressed Major-General Shah.

 Earlier, the army had said it couldn?t stop fairs or exhibitions till February as permission had been issued well in advance. But his inspection prompted him to reconsider. ?Organising fairs on these grounds causes immense damage,? he said, indicating that this was probably the last time the Maidan served as a venue for the book fair.

 The survey was to monitor the guild?s clean-up operation after the book fair shut shop on February 6. The organisers had promised to complete the task, but ?a few issues remained to be sorted out?, Shah explained. 

 ?I have made a few points to the guild about what remains to be done, and the president has assured me that they will be taken care of by tomorrow,? he said.

 The guild has been asked to level the uneven surface of the ground, now dotted with craters dug to hold the bamboo-and-wooden framework of stalls. Electric cables laid to illuminate the fair also caused some damage. Gaping holes and mounds of mud blemish the green sweep. The grass, trampled upon by hundreds of thousands of visitors over 12 days, lies limp.

 ?The ground must be levelled so grass can grow back in a uniform manner. If it rains before that, flowing rainwater will cut channels and scar the face of the Maidan,? Shah pointed out to Kalyan Shah, president of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild.

 ?About five per cent of the clean-up remains, and we are confident of completing it by Wednesday morning,? said guild president Shah.

 Tridib Kumar Chatterjee, honorary general secretary of the book fair, drew attention to a number of concrete slabs currently lying on the periphery of the Maidan. ?Those were lying there before the book fair. We moved them to one side to avoid inconveniencing visitors,? said Chatterjee. Army officials said the slabs would be removed later.

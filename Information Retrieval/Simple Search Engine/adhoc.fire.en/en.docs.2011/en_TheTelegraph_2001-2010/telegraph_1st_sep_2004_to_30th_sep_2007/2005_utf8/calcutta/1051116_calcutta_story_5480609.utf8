The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dream launch pad for footballer

 - First Asian with full, unconditional scholarship to study, train in England

 Chiraag Paul: Kick-off

 When Chiraag Paul kicks a ball in training on the Wast Hills grounds, Midlands, on a chilly November morning less than two weeks from now, he will be the ?first Asian with a full and unconditional scholarship? to study and train to become a professional footballer in England.

 The 17-year-old striker is headed for English Premier League?s Birmingham City Football Club, where he went for trials last month. ?Further to our meeting (on October 20) at Birmingham City Football Club, we would like to invite you to attend a trial for the South Birmingham College and Birmingham City Football Club Football Development School,? Louise Macey, Football Development School manager, writes to the Class XI student of Calcutta International School.

 Chiraag, who admires Ruud van Nistelrooy and Raul, is understandably delighted. ?It?s a dream come true. If I can utilise this wonderful launch pad to eventually get into the pro league and turn out in Birmingham City colours in the Premiership, it could open the floodgates in India, where there is no dearth of soccer talent,? he says.

 The club?s Football in the Community wing, which has an alliance with South Birmingham College for a comprehensive football and education programme, has organised the mandatory academic course for him to go alongside the soccer training that will groom him with the ultimate goal of EPL action. The South Birmingham College has offered Chiraag a ?full scholarship for the duration of the course for two years? to study the BTEC National Diploma in Sports Studies, to be held at the Hall Green Centre of the college.

 The teenager will fly out to Birmingham on November 26 and join the training programme by the month-end. The family is quick to point out the ?hugely significant role? East Bengal?s Brazilian star Douglas had played by convincing them that Jeet (Chiraag?s pet name) had it in him to make it big. Mother Arunima also had a special word for Paul Walsh in the British Deputy High Commission for fast-tracking his visa and backing the boy.

 The full scholarship waives the tuition fees for the course, but all other costs will be borne by the family. Macey, however, has promised to ?get the Institute of Asian Business to help out? with the ?450-500 expenditure per month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Software firm in fast gear

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Restructuring is complete, new business model is in place and the focus area identified ? city-based software product company Vedika Software Ltd, which has presence in six countries, is now drawing up an expansion plan. 

 ?We have around 70 people in Calcutta and we want to double the number in the next nine months. This recruitment drive in the city is a precursor to our growth plans in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore and our international offices in Dubai, Singapore, Nepal, Malaysia and Philippines,? said Arvind Agarwalla, who started the company 17 years ago. 

 The products from the Vedika stable include Fact, a real time accounting software, and Perks, a payroll software. The products are installed in over 15,000 companies ? in India and abroad ? across an entire gamut of industries. 

 While value addition to the products, done from the development centre in Calcutta, is a priority, Vedika is also planning to intensify marketing efforts. Recently, the company recruited interns from Singapore Management University. 

 ?We have had a steady growth path in the domestic market. But now we are ready for an exponential growth path and expect to double our revenues in the next year,? said Agarwalla, who moved to Singapore in the nineties to tap the market in the Asia- Pacific region. 

 Though the southeast Asian currency crisis and events like severe acute respiratory syndrome affected its fortunes, the company has kept roping in new clients. 

 The fair price of the products and 24X7 delivery of support services have helped in strengthening the company?s brand name, he added. 

 ?Our product Fact has such a strong branding that we are planning to change the name of the company to Fact,? said Agarwalla. According to him, Fact is the number two ? after Tally ? in terms of share of the accounting software market. 

 But the next phase will be different, claimed Agarwalla. And though he has complaints about the city and the infrastructure facilities here, Calcutta figures on the company?s scheme of things. ?We face power cuts at least twice a week and the quality and price of bandwidth are, indeed, issues of concern. But still, I have faith in India and Calcutta and that?s why the city figures on he company?s all future plans,? sums up Agarwalla, who still holds an Indian passport despite spending over a decade in Singapore.

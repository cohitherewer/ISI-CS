 Blue boon for work woes

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, people belonging to the fire element should surround themselves with cool shades of blue for peace of mind and better performance at work

Q: I am a 26-year-old guy born on 13.06.78. My problem is that whenever I take up a job, I cant last in the organisation for more than four to five months. Either I have conflicts with my manager or I lose the job due to bad performance. Currently I am not working anywhere. Since I have only worked in banks till now, I am afraid of changing industries. Please help me overcome my career and financial problems.

 Name withheld

 The Solution: You are a strong fire person born in mid summer when the fire element is at its peak. This gives you a bad temper. You will face many conflict situations in life. The water element is very important to keep a check on the excessive fire element. Surround yourself with cool shades of blue. Make sure you wear this colour always, especially while going to office. This will help keep your mind cool and you will be able to work better. This element also represents status for you. Any work connected with banking, finance, media and marketing will bring you success and recognition. You have a brilliant time waiting for you in terms of finances from the year 2006 onwards.

 Door dilemma

 Q: My room, located in the south-eastern side of our house, has four doors. Two of them, facing west, open into the living room and the other two, facing north and east, open into the balcony and bathroom respectively. My room is painted yellow. From the time I have moved into this room, I have been facing academic problems and losing concentration. My sister and I end up arguing over every issue. Please suggest what can be done. What are my lucky number, colour, birth element, animal sign and direction? My date of birth is 18.10.86.

 The Solution: When a room has so many doors, the in-flowing cosmic energy gets dissipated and cannot be productively contained, leaving the room unnourished. As a result, the disturbed energy effects your efficiency and power of concentration. Closing one door facing west from the living room and keeping the bathroom door in the east closed at all times will make you feel better. Place a photograph of you and your sister on the western wall to strengthen sisterly love. Fire, earth and metal elements rule your life and hence like red, maroon, purple, mauve, peach, pink, beige, cream, yellow and white are favourable for you. Your animal sign is tiger, lucky number is one and auspicious directions are south-east, east, south and north.

 Career concern

 Q: My son had completed his graduation in agriculture in 2000. Till then he has been serving in various capacities in research projects on a contractual basis. He has appeared in various interviews for a permanent job in government as well as in the private sector. But he is still waiting for a permanent placement and we are all very worried. His date of birth is 10.03.75. Please give us a few tips so he can get a permanent placement.

 The Solution: Your son is an extremely strong wood person and is going through a period of water, which makes him stronger. These two elements go against him and he needs to be balanced with fire, earth and metal elements. Luckily this year the elements that are in power are metal over wood and these can reshape his life and give him a sudden gain in status. As he was born in the year of the rabbit, he is clashing with the ruling rooster. So you can expect something significant and positive to happen in his life this year. Keeping a picture of a dragon in his wallet will work as a protective and lucky charm.

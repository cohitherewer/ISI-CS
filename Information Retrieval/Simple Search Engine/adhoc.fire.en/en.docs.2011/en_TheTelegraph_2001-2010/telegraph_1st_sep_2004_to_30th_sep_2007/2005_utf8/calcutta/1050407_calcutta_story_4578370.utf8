From Patna to Milan ? it?s a giant leap for a 24-year-old fashion graduate who had just taken his first steps to find a foothold in the Indian style industry. Shahzad Kalim, winner of Star One?s reality show Lakme Fashion House, is on seventh heaven now. Having been judged the best designer among participants from the country over by none other that international fashion icon Donatella Versace, the young stylist is all set to fly off to Milan for a six-month internship with the house of Versace.

 What was your immediate reaction on being declared the winner of Lakme Fashion House?

 I couldn?t believe that Donatella Versace was announcing my name as the winner. It?s not that it was totally unexpected. I was very confident and had worked very hard, but when I finally achieved the goal I was torn between mixed emotions. I was shocked, excited, happy at the same time, and my eyes were filled with tears. I had seen Versace on television, but to see her in person and stand beside her on the same ramp, with the designer showering praises on me, was a dream-like situation.

 While participating in the contest did you ever feel you would win the grand prize?

 My goal was always to reach the final stage, the prize was not so much on my mind. I was very focussed throughout and gave my best shot to every task that was assigned to me. After having crossed all the hurdles when I reached the final, I started dreaming of Milan. Though I always thought either Swapnil or Jobby (my co-participants) would make it, after the question-answer round with Versace I was very confident about my chances of winning.

 What were your creations for the final round?

 We were asked to design wedding wear for a bride and a groom and one outfit for ourselves. My inspiration for the wedding clothes was India. The bridal outfit was a sharara teamed with a choli and two drapes of five metres each. I combined 10 different kinds of brocades in that one outfit and the colours were fresh green, turquoise and gold. It was intricately embroidered with an antique look. For the groom, I made a sherwani with a jacket collar to give it an international look. This I paired with a wrap-around trouser that looks like a dhoti. It?s fully embroidered and the hues are light blue and turquoise. My outfit was totally western and wacky. I made a jacket and a long pleated skirt for myself.

 How did you cope with the pressures of the reality show? Did you feel like quitting at any point of time?

 No, I never thought of quitting. The final prize provided the motivation and I was always focussed on the job at hand. Whenever I felt stressed out, I took out some time to lie down and close my eyes and organise myself. That?s how I remained cool and calm and in fact, I was dubbed the most chilled out guy in the contest.

 Looking back, how has the whole Fashion House experience been?

 In the beginning it was strange to have a camera capturing you all the time. But once I got used to the camera and was no longer self-conscious, I started enjoying myself. I had a great time getting to know the other contestants, learning from their work styles, going shopping together for raw materials and chilling out. On the whole it was a dream experience full of fun, friends and achievements. 

 What are you planning to showcase at the Lakme India Fashion Week?

 I will be showcasing a club wear collection for women. Western silhouettes with Indian embroideries will lend a rich feel to the clothes, while basic colours like red, blue, green, yellow and orange will make them look young.

 What expectations do you have from the Milan stint?

 I will be flying off to Milan in the first week of May, right after the fashion week. I think the experience will change my life in a big way. The three years I spent in NIFT, Hyderabad, taught me a lot about Indian fashion... 

 Being at the global fashion hub for six months and learning from a designer of Versace?s stature will teach me a lot about world fashion. Once I come back to India, I will put together both the experiences and that will certainly help me establish my career as a designer.

 What kind of clothes do you want to specialise in?

 My strong points are my cuts and the way I combine contrasting looks in one garment. I want to specialise in club wear because I have always been attracted to glitz and glamour. I also want to design for movies and ads in a big way.

 Who are your idols in the industry?

 In India, my favourite designers are Manish Arora and Aki Narula and internationally I admire the works of John Galliano.

 Hailing from a city like Patna, where one wouldn?t expect much fashion consciousness, why did you choose a career in fashion designing?

 It?s true that there?s very little fashion awareness in Patna. But I was interested in fashion right from my childhood. I would never wear an outfit straight from the stores without adding personal touches of mine. Even my school uniform would have some elements of my own.

 I always knew I wanted to be a designer and so I moved out and joined NIFT. After that I worked with a local brand and an export house in Delhi. My parents of course weren?t too supportive of my career choice. My father wanted me to be a doctor, but I finally had my way.

 But now he is very proud of me and that?s what makes me most happy.

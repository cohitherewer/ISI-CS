 Certified copy of order changed

 The high court of Calcutta: Ghost-writers of verdicts. A Telegraph picture

 Justice P.N. Sinha of Calcutta High Court directed the registrar-general on Thursday to identify the persons who had tampered with one of his judgments.

 The judge also authorised the registrar-general to seek help from the crime-control section of the court to probe the ?serious issue?.

 The directive followed a revelation that an order of Justice Sinha, issued in a maintenance case, had been changed in the certified copy issued to the litigants. 

 The operative part of the judgment had been rewritten, allegedly by a court employee.

 The case related to Nabakumar Bag and Rita Bag, who had fought a legal battle in a family court in Calcutta. 

 The judge had directed Nabakumar to pay an interim maintenance of Rs 500 a month to Rita from the day the order was issued.

 Rita?s counsel Somnath Banerjee moved the high court against the family court?s order, pleading that the maintenance be paid from the date of application.

 After hearing both sides, Justice Sinha overruled the family court order. 

 He observed that the lower court judge should have asked Nabakumar to pay the interim maintenance from the date of application.

 The judge also overruled the respondent?s contention that the high court should not interfere in the matter, as it was pending in a lower court.

 But when counsel Banerjee obtained the certified copy of the order, he found that Justice Sinha?s words had been altered.

 The judgment, according to the certified copy, upheld the lower court order. It also stated, as argued by the respondent, that the high court should not intervene in the matter.

 Banerjee placed the copy before Justice Sinha, who promptly asked the court officer to produce the ?order sheet?. 

 The judge found that the first three pages of the ?order sheet?, written in blue ink, had followed his judgment. The fourth and the last page, written in black, had twisted the verdict.

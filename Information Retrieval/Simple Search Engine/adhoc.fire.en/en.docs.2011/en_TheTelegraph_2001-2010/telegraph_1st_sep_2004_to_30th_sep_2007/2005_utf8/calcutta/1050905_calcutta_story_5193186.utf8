 - Non-Anglo-Indian schools flouting recruitment rules

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) are planning a crackdown on schools flouting rules while recruiting teachers.

 A probe by the state education department has revealed that an increasing number of private English-medium schools are recruiting teachers on a pay-scale far below what the government has stipulated and on contracts that violate CISCE guidelines.

 ?We are looking into complaints against some non-Anglo-Indian schools,? said G. Arathoon, deputy secretary and head of the CISCE?s regional office.

 According to pay-scales fixed by the state government for ICSE and CBSE schools, a trained, graduate teacher must get a salary of at least Rs 7,500 per month. The minimum salary for a principal has been fixed at Rs 13,500. In reality, some of the schools are reportedly paying Rs 1,300 to teachers and Rs 50 more to principals.

 On hiring teachers on contract, CISCE has stated that the tenure should be of minimum two years and a teacher on contract should get all benefits that a permanent teacher enjoys. In contrast, the accused schools are hiring teachers for less than two years ? in some cases for just six months ? and the remuneration offered is nowhere near what a permanent teacher gets.

 Another point of worry for CISCE is that the schools are paying salaries to contractual teachers in cash, though the rule is to pay through banks.

 ?This is a disturbing trend, because efficient teachers will stop joining ICSE and CBSE schools if they offer such low salaries,? an official in the education department said.

 ?ICSE and CBSE schools are expected to maintain a high academic standard as they charge much more from students than state-aided schools,? the official added. 

 It is learnt that many schools are recruiting teachers on contract citing a government decision to recruit a few thousand temporary teachers in rural areas to meet the target of bringing every child below 14 years within the school education system.

 CISCE sources said the accused schools are unaided and do not include the reputed ones run by missionaries.

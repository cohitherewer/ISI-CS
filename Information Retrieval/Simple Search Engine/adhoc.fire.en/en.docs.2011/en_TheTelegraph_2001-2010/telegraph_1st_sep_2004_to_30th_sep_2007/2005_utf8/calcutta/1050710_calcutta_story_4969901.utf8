 Going to B.E.D seems to be one 

 of the favourite pastimes of the party people on weeknights. 

 And the Ballygunge Circular Road address raising a toast 

 to bars, entertainment and dining has now started femme 

 fatale nights every Friday to add to the drama.

 The concept started just two weeks ago, but it is already attracting girls in groups ready to walk the wild side. This Friday, stealing the show from the usual suspects were two of the most attractive ladies in town ? actresses Rupa Ganguly and Debasree Roy.

 Rupa, dressed in black skirt and black top, made a brief appearance on the dance floor, jiving to Kala chashma and Sohniye. Every gaze in the house was riveted on the woman in black as long as she grooved with a grin.

 Debasree in a sleeveless top, however, gave the dance floor a skip and enjoyed a quiet munch in the adjoining dhaba. 

 Churning out tracks from the console on this starry night was DJ Mike, a guest from Club 7 in Mumbai.

 Cairo calling

 If you thought that an Egyptian theme night could transport you to the land of the Nile and the Pyramids, think again. The Egyptian night at Cloud 9 had none of the aura of the ancient but the party spirit was well in place with the young and trendy treading the theme night as just another night in party paradise.

 Despite trying very hard, we could not lay our hands on robes and the belly dancers could not be arranged on such a short notice, admitted a spokesperson for the nightclub at The Astor. 

 But DJ Pradip kept the tempo high by playing tracks like Dekh le, Bin tere sanam, Dus Bahane and Dhadak dhadak.

 Short n hot

 Wednesday night was all about 

 short skirts and minuscule minis at Tantra, as Chromosome 

 X slipped into Short n Sweet mode, inspired 

 by J. Los wardrobe, no less (or maybe no more).

 The theme night rolled out by manager Arati Rao and team grabbed the imagination of the girls as they stepped out in all things short ? skirts, dresses, shorts and hot pants.

 A few lucky ladies whose hemlines rose high to the occasion the best were given gifts sponsored by J. Los Miami Glow.

 On the music front, DJ Oblix belted out commercial dance tracks till DJ Sammy took over with his repertoire of R amp;B and Hip Hop chart busters. DJ Vishal ruled the console later with some new-age psychedelic trance.

 Those who missed out on the perfume kitty can look forward to the Flower Power night next Wednesday, where floral prints or just flowers can win you Esprit fragrances.

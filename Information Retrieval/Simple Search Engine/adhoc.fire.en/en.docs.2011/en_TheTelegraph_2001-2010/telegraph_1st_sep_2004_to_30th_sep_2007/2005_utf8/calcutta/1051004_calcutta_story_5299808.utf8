 Stink delays exam work at CU press 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Not exactly a workers? strike, nor a students? agitation. It is the stench from a litter dump in front of Calcutta University?s (CU) press in Ballygunge that is threatening to stall examinations on the campus.

 Employees of the press in south Calcutta, where all examination-related papers and important documents are printed, have threatened to keep work suspended till 3 pm every day because of the ?unbearable? stench that the dump emanates.

 From early morning till late in the afternoon, when the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s (CMC) conservancy staff remove the garbage, the stink hangs heavy in the air on the press premises.

 The university authorities fear that if the partial cease-work continues, major examinations and other important academic activities may be held up in the near future.

 ?The dump needs to be shifted immediately. Otherwise, it may be difficult to complete the examination-related work on time,? pointed out Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, controller of examinations, CU. 

 ?The employees? grievance is genuine. The stench is really unbearable. One cannot work in such surroundings,? admitted another CU official.

 The university had written to former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, requesting him to shift the dump so the students were not indirectly affected. ?But we didn?t receive a response from him,? the official said.

 Alarmed by the recent threat by the press employees, vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee this week shot off a written complaint to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 Sources in the press say their ordeal began nearly four years ago, when the CMC chose the site adjacent to the entrance of the press for piling garbage collected from door-to-door. While the dumping starts as early as 7 am, the mound of refuse is cleared only around 3 pm.

 ?Our pleas have been ignored time and again. We just can?t breathe. Now, we have no other option but to start work only after 3 pm,? said an employee of the press. With heavy workload through the year, the press operates from 7 am to 10 pm on all working days.

 Arun Sarkar, chief engineer of CMC?s conservancy department, however, said the present site, in front of the press, was most suited for dumping garbage as it was not a residential area. ?The site is being used for the purpose for the past many years,? Sarkar said.

 However, he promised to look into the university?s complaint and start searching for an alternative site suitable for garbage collection.

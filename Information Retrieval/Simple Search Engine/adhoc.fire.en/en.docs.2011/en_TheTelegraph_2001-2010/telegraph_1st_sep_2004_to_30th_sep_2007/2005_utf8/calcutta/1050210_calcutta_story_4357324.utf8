If you had planned to say it with flowers this Valentine?s 

Day, a glance at the racks of Kookie Jar would lead you to change your mind and 

opt for a cake to do the talking for you instead. If matters of the heart are 

what you want to indulge in, no one can spoil you with more choices than this 

confectionery chain. 

From tiny sugar hearts sitting pretty on some of the 

pastries to full one pound cakes of the same shape ? there?s plenty to pamper 

your Valentine, whatever your requirement.

?We have been doing special Valentine?s Day collections 

for almost 10 years now. We know exactly what will go down well with Calcuttans. 

We have quite a wide range this year and the heart features in most of the stuff, 

be it in the form of a decoration or the base,? says proprietor Lovey Burman.

For those set to celebrate a really special Valentine?s 

Day, there are some sinful delights like Straight From the Heart Cake, Under Lock 

 amp; Key Cake, My Heart Has Wings Cake, Rose Basket Cakes and Teddy Bear Cakes 

Holding Hearts. 

And if you?re planning a modest event, you can pick 

from I Love You Cookies, Heart Valentine Cookies, Chocolate Heart Lollipops, Cookie 

Face Lollipops, Be Mine Teddy Bear Cookies, Brownie Hearts, Chocolate Valentine 

Hearts and Chocolate Boxes in Heart Shapes. The melt-in-the-mouth Belgian chocolate 

used in almost all the cakes, cookies and lollipops are sure to melt any heart. 

A really special offering this time is the Dalmatian 

Cake, saying ?you have a spot in my heart?, for pet lovers. ?These days, on Valentine?s 

Day people give gifts to anyone they love. While the cookies and lollipops are 

usually picked up by kids for their mothers and teachers, we thought the Dalmatian 

Cake will be ideal for a very special pet at home,? explains Burman.

For the past 20 years, Kookie Jar has added a sweet 

touch to every occasion. Be it festivals like Christmas, New Year, Easter, Holi 

or Diwali or special days like Mothers? Day, Fathers? Day, Children?s Day or Valentine?s 

Day ? it has dished out innovative goodies to celebrate each occasion. ?With so 

much competition in the confectionery segment, one has to keep on doing new things 

every now and then. Also, we have a team of very creative chefs working for us. 

Doing new things occasionally gives them the chance to innovate and keeps their 

interest going,? feels Burman.

While a special festive line is supposed to take care 

of the eye candy factor as much as the taste, planning such a menu is a laborious 

process. The plan starts rolling 15 days before the festival when Burman meets 

the team of senior chefs to decide on the theme and the various ways in which 

it can be portrayed. ?With Valentine?s Day, it?s relatively easy since the theme 

is always the heart. But we had to rack our brains on how we are going to present 

it. What ingredients and medium we would use to make heart shapes. We pulled out 

all our moulds and pictures that we could lay our hands on and decided the menu 

after a lot of consultation,? says Burman. Once the spread is decided, the items 

are made for trials for a whole week. And after it has been more or less finalised, 

the costing is fixed. 

The final presentation, which involves deciding the 

d?cor and colour combinations, is made by Burman along with sister Puja Kapoor. 

While ribbons and food glitter are some of the staple for decorations, the Valentine?s 

Day cakes and cookies have been embellished with sugar hearts in red, silver and 

gold, sugar balls, small sugar cylinders, red sugar lips and lots more. 

?All the d?cor items, even the ribbons, have been 

sourced from London and Bangkok. In fact, I pick these up from all over America 

and Europe whenever I am travelling,? says Burman. 

Most of the main ingredients required in the Jodhpur 

Park kitchen are sourced from Delhi and Mumbai. ?Even a couple of years back we 

had to import all our ingredients from Europe or America. But things have really 

changed for the better now and there are agents in Delhi and Mumbai who supply 

the stuff. There are even some suppliers in Calcutta who deal in these exotic 

fruits and chocolates,? says Burman. 

Even the more exotic ingredients like canned peaches, 

sundry tomatoes, blueberry, varieties of cheese and chocolates are now available 

readily. ?But I still import the food colours from abroad and I pick up the moulds 

from Paris,? she adds.

The kitchen has a team of 100 people, with everyone 

doing a specialised job. ?We believe in complete specialisation. So if one person 

is an expert in layering a cake, he?ll do that the whole day, while another person 

will only finish them with the decorations,? explains Burman, who recalls having 

started off with a team of five people operating from her garage at home 20 years 

ago. 

?We had one room, a commercial oven, a mixer and a 

small fridge. Every new item I made, I would make my family members try it. Over 

the years, we gradually expanded as and when we required more space and workforce,? 

she recounts. 

It was on December 15, 1985 that the first Kookie 

Jar store on Rawdon Street was opened to ?cope with the demand?. Today, the chain 

is all set to open its third outlet in the city. While the second one at City 

Centre opened recently, the new one will be coming up in Alipore next month. 

Apart from these, there are Kookie Jar corners at 

the two C3 stores (City Centre and Elgin Road), taking the number to five.

While the recipes are mostly sourced from books, a 

lot of research about customer tastes and demands go into altering them to suit 

the taste of Calcuttans.

?A dessert might be a hit with Americans, but it?s 

not guaranteed to please the tastebuds of Calcuttans. For instance, the Baked 

American Cheese Cake is a hit internationally, but it won?t go down well with 

people of this city. So, we do a slightly different version called the Chilled 

Cheese Cake, which is very popular,? says Burman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Frown on varsity vacant posts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state audit department has asked Calcutta University (CU) to explain why several honorary academic posts are vacant for a long time.

 The department has also asked the university authorities to prepare a report on the status of the vacant posts. The report has to be submitted this week, senior CU officials said.

 The government has reportedly taken exception to CU?s failure to find suitable candidates for the posts, most of which bear the name of renowned personalities and were created through endowments. There are nearly 50 endowment and chair professor posts in CU.

 What has annoyed the audit department even more is that the university has drawn government funds for paying salaries for the posts, even though more than a dozen have been lying vacant for years.

 Sources said the vacant posts include Shyamaprasad Mukherjee professor of sociology, Rani Bageswari professor of Indian art in ancient Indian history, Rabindranath Tagore professor of Bengali, Kumar Guru Prasad Singh chair, also known as Khoira professor of linguistics, Rashbehari Ghosh professor of physics and Rashbehari Ghosh professor of applied mathematics.

 ?The university has not made any attempt to fill up the posts, most of which are vacant for two decades,? a source pointed out. An official cited the example of the Shyamaprasad Mukherjee professor of sociology post. 

 Bela Dutta Gupta, former chairperson of the state women?s commission, last held the post. She retired in 1986. 

 Similarly, the post of Rani Bageswari professor of Indian art was last held 12 years ago by Kalyan Kumar Dasgupta.

 ?The posts are only meant for experts. Research is bound to suffer even if one such post is vacant for a long time,? a senior teacher of the university observed.

 ?We are examining why the posts have not been filled up and have started the process of filling up some of the vacancies,? said CU registrar Ujwal Basu.

 The university had recently appealed to the Centre for permission to create an academic post to mark its 150th anniversary. The audit department?s letter could jeopardise the prospect. 

 Requests to create some other professorial posts are pending with the human resources development ministry. Fifty years ago, during the centenary celebrations of CU, it had made similar requests to the Centre. A number of posts in mathematics, political science and statistics were created at the time.

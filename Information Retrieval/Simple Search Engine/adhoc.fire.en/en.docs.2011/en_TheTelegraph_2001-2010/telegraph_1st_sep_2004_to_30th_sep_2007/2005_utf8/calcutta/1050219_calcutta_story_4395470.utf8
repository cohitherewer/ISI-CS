 It's Your Birthday So...

 You 

are among those who make the world more exciting for everyone else. Learn to draw 

a line between personal emotions and work. At one level, your attachment to work 

you enjoy is commendable, but at the other, a more methodical approach is preferable. 

Your creativity is acknowledged and appreciated. Your lack of discipline is usually 

forgiven because of your creative edge. ? Kusum Bhandari

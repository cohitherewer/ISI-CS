The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diamonds and rust

 Love stories that thrilled the world. The words write themselves across the screen, on a backdrop reminiscent of the black-and-white big screen classics. 

 Not all of them had a perfect ending. For the stories are not screen romances, but taken from harsh reality and enacted by figures who actually lived the moments captured on screen. Yet, there was something larger than life about the romances which captured the imagination. 

 A great series is about to unwind on Discovery Channel, beginning this Wednesday at 10 pm. Great Romances of the 20th Century, a BBC World Production, will focus on the love lives of celebrity couples from sports, films, politics, literature? 

 The first episode is on Charlie Chaplin and Oona O?Neil. It traces the comedian?s life from the time he was a young hopeful, enlisting with Fred Karno?s musical troupe. After three disastrous marriages, he met playwright Eugene O?Neil?s daughter in 1943. It feels quite odd to see Chaplin outside his tramp image. The camera follows him through the release of Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, his voyage to England, and then his triumphant return to Hollywood in 1972 to receive a special Oscar. All through, till his death in 1977, Oona was by his side.

 If Chaplin was fourth time lucky, Marilyn Monroe was 

not. The story of her romance with baseball legend Joe DiMaggio (in picture above) 

comes on air on March 2. The camera this time follows Norma Jean Baker?s career 

graph from the orphanages till a forlorn starlet becomes Marilyn, the all-American 

sex symbol. The episode captures with sensitivity the contradictions in the actress 

and her gradual distancing from her husband who could neither handle the Hollywood 

hoopla nor understand her insecurities. If one filed for divorce on grounds of 

mental cruelty, the other paid for her casket when she ultimately committed suicide.

 Capturing the story of John F. Kennedy and Jackie Bouvier (March 23) was more complicated as American politics of mid-20th century is interspersed with the duo. The swathe of the Kennedy-Richard Nixon clash and his entry to White House is captured, with footage from JFK?s speeches. It is all relevant to the story as Jackie was emerging as a vital political ?box-office?.

 The other names in the series are just as illustrious ? Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks...

 The success of the documentation perhaps lies in the treatment. There is a wealth of footage yet nowhere does it feel like a documentary. 

 ?We have 12 episodes lined up but another 13 are sure to follow,? promises Rajiv Bakshi of Discovery Channel.

 Here?s to diamonds and rust on Wednesdays for quite some months to come.

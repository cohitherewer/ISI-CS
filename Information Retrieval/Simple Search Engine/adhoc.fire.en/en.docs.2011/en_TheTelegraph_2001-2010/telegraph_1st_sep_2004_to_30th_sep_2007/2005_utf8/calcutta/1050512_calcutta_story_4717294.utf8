 Pester power sells everything ? car to candies, toothpaste to TVs ? and now, restaurants are waking up to its possibilities. Just in time, too, with kids screaming for F amp;B space in a city obsessed with lounge and coffee shop.

 As a sign of things to come, Mainland China is hosting a children?s food festival starting Friday. Sweet-and-sour items in smaller quantities are the star attractions on a colourful menu that promises to teach pint-sized patrons Chinese by the end of a happy meal.

 ?Parents go where children like to eat,? feels Debashish Ghosh of the Gurusaday Road restaurant. The festival has been timed to coincide with the school summer vacations. The heat wave adds to the numbers with ?families choosing to eat out?, adds Ghosh, rather than slog it out in steamy kitchens. If logistics permit, the kiddie menu may become a permanent fixture.

 Grain of Salt has bigger platter plans for the little ones. The on-going renovation will include some special attractions for children, starting with diversions at the table like Ludo, puzzles, chess and colouring books.

 ?This will allow them to be a part of the family at the table and still enjoy themselves,? explains Pankaj Tandon of Grain of Salt. Also being considered is a children?s menu to pamper under-age taste buds with pastas, pizzas and more.

 If feedback is favourable, a corner where children can play with toys may be included in the new-look 22 Camac Street destination. With parents taking even infants out with them, often armed with hired help, children?s play areas could provide adults with a few munch moments in peace. ?For young couples, this is often the only time to relax together,? observes Tandon.

 First Innings, the restaurant at the Stadel, in Salt Lake, has had a children?s menu for some time. Fun names like Garfield?s Favourite (lasagne, of course), Jughead?s Ecstasy (burger and fries) and Ninja?s Pride (pizza) have been devised. The concept has huge potential, feels Stadel?s Anil Bhutoria.

 Parents may feel uncomfortable about taking young children to formal or smoky restaurants, but the city has few options.

 Pizza Hut is one of them, which has proved to be a hit with kids ? and not just because of its cheesy, carbohydrate-laden treats. The service mantra of the international chain is to ensure its tiny customers leave happy.

 Kids are handed balloons, drawing sheets, crayons and puzzles, are greeted specially and are thrilled by song-and-dance routines performed by the hosts. Add to that favourite foods like garlic bread, potato wedges and cheese pizzas, and the kids are all smiles. Feedback has been consistently positive from families with pre-teens, who dominate the crowd on weekends and make up around half the crowd on weekdays too.

 Kids? dining-out needs are also being catered to in a big way by food courts. Both Burp at Forum and Hangout at City Centre have play areas, and it is add-ons and not separate food choices that win youngsters? loyalty, says City Centre CEO Vineet Verma.

 ?Kids keep going back to McDonald?s not because of the burgers but for the toys they get with the Happy Meals,? he observes.

 To capture its audience ? 75 per cent of which is families with under-14 children ?special events like quizzes and fun activities where freebies are given out have been organised occasionally. 

 With eateries going for growth, they are banking on children to champion their culinary cause.

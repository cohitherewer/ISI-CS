 Tests imperative, yet Buddha balks 

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Rima and Rajiv, to marry next month, are busy shopping. Till a doctor friend tells them how crucial HIV and thalassaemia tests are before starting a life together. The HIV tests are negative, but both Rima and Rajiv turn out to be thalassaemia carriers. Which means their child will be at 25 per cent risk of being affected by the disease.

 The number of people walking into a diagnostic centre for the ?crucial? tests before marriage is few and far between. Yet, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is hesitant to make the tests compulsory for registering a marriage.

 The judicial department has recently turned down a proposal from the health department on making the tests mandatory before marriage. 

 ?Scores of letters come to the health department from non-government organisations, requesting the government to make the tests compulsory,? said a senior official of the judicial department. ?Ideally, such a piece of legislation should immediately be enacted. But it will be a tall order to enforce it now.?

 He argues that the government first needs to make the people aware about the importance of HIV and thalassaemia tests before marriage. ?The government also needs to ensure that every neighbourhood has centres for such tests and the poor can get them done free. Unless such infrastructure is ready, how can we make the tests compulsory??

 Agrees law and judicial minister Nisith Adhikary. ?Awareness is the key. We have asked marriage officers to ask couples to get the tests done at the earliest. Only after a majority of the population feels the necessity of the tests, will we be able to introduce a law and make them compulsory.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hand in hand, stable to table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Harping on its inherent strengths in the farm sector, the Bengal government has pledged ?all possible support? to German food-processing units willing to invest in the state and to promote mutually-gainful collaboration.

 Addressing a 15-member business delegation from Germany at a star hotel in the city on Wednesday, state food-processing and horticulture minister Sailen Sarkar said: ?Agri-business and food-processing industries have been clearly identified as priority sectors and drivers of growth.?

 Sarkar requested the 15-member German team to ?identify specific areas of collaboration and products that can be implemented in West Bengal?. S.S. Ahuja, principal secretary, food processing and horticulture, spelt out the possibilities of joint-ventures and special-purpose vehicles for investment in the sector.

 The two-day visit of German food-processing business captains has been organised by the OAV-German Asia-Pacific Business Association, in cooperation with the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce.

 Head of the German delegation Peter Clasen congratulated West Bengal for the ?outstanding progress made in all spheres? and reiterated that the state figured prominently on the radar of the German business community.

 Food scientist Wolfgang von Wiese, also part of the delegation, stressed the need for food-safety measures ?from stable to table? and said, eventually, the safety onus was on the retailer.

 G?nter Wehrmann, consul-general of Germany in Calcutta, thanked the delegation for ?walking the extra mile and coming to Calcutta?. 

 A presentation on the industry perspective by Keventer Agro chairman M.K. Jalan, assisted by Sumit Deb, managing director, Metro Dairy, was followed by another on food parks by P. Sengupta of Ernst amp; Young.

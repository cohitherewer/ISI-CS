 They have adorned the necks and wrists of sadhus, bauls and bahurupis for ages and now they are invading the space of fashion jewellery as well.

 The Gold Factory launched a unique collection of ornaments with a combination of seeds and gold, called Majar Majar Sadhu Sajano Sonar Goyna, at its Gariahat outlet on Wednesday.

 A lot of research went into deciding the kind of seeds that can be combined with gold to make good-looking and wearable jewellery, says Sudakshina Banerjee, a member of the research team at Gold Factory. 

 Seeds of bakul, babla, shakalu and kuchphal in maroon, red and brown have been combined aesthetically with lightweight gold for a traditional yet trendy appeal. The neckpieces include a variety of seeds combined with artistically carved gold balls, oval beads strung together with thin pointed matte finish gold embellishments and many more.

 The earrings come in the form of small danglers, and are in sync with the neckpieces. 

 The seeds have been sourced from the Birbhum district and they are all bio-degradable. So the jewellery has to be aired regularly and should be kept with insect repellents, adds Sudakshina. 

 The price tags start at Rs 1,500.

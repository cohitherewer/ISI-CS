 In her image: The Mother Goddess resplendent in her golden finery 

 It is heartening that traditional idols are making a comeback in the city Pujas (Theme frenzy out, tradition takes over, August 29). 

 The fact that the well-known pujas have been instrumental behind this trend is even more encouraging. They are the ones that lead the way when it becomes to deciding the trend. 

 There is some substance in the saying ?Old is gold?. Customs and traditions need to be given due importance. The traditional idols depict the goddesses and the gods in their glory. Devotees also prefer Durga in her traditional form. 

 Customs and habits change with time. Cosmetics, perfumes and ornaments also evolve continuously. But it?s not in good taste to change the appearance of the goddess as per the dictates of the current fad. 

 Is there any need to resort to gimmicks like replacing Mahishasura with Osama bin Laden? Those who sculpt the idols,unfortunately, are often forced to bow to the diktats of the Puja organisers. 

 Suburban puja organisers are still experimenting with the look of the idols. But, ultimately, they, too, will realise that there is nothing so soothing and awe-inspiring like the traditional look. 

 Our tastes and habits will continue to change, but the traditional style of idol-making needs to be preserved. That will be the best way to express our devotion to the goddess.

 The police sometimes go beyond limits to show that they have got enormous power, as is apparent from the report ?Blows rain over spelt name?, August 24. Innocent people are quite often the target of this muscle-flexing, while those who have broken the law roam free. The trend is dangerous and will lead to erosion of faith of the common people in the cops. The police need to project a more friendly face to the public. 

 Madhabi D. Ghosh,

 The sordid episode at the Lakes bears testimony to the fact that not much has changed since four constables of Calcutta Police beat up sergeant Bapi Sen, leading to his death. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 It is shocking how a youth was mercilessly beaten up by four cops without any reason. Such an incident clearly demonstrates why common people, even in distress, do not want to take the help of the police and withhold information from them. The guilty cops should be punished in an exemplary manner. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 The police force, being the pampered child of the Left Front government, often harasses common people on one pretext or the other and tries to extract money from them on flimsy grounds. 

 The annals of the police is quite shameful. A couple of years ago, sergeant Bapi Sen was killed by his colleagues when he tried to protect a woman from being molested. A policeman was sentenced for raping a street-dweller in Phoolbagan. At Majherhat, a retired police officer was caught red-handed while extorting money from passers-by and vehicles. 

 It is time chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee reins in his department. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 The report ?Diktat on dengue check?, August 23, stated that Anwar Shah Road was one of the areas from where the disease was spreading. However, there is hardly any visible action by the authorities to arrest the outbreak in the locality. 

 Water has accumulated near the west end of the Mecon Tower compound. The underground mains is the source. The water flows along the roadside ditches to manholes. As a result, puddles near the ditches have also filled up. 

 The scene to the west of the spot is no better. Shanties have come up encroaching on the entire footpath. They and the roadside eateries discharge sewage in the roadside drain. 

 In the vicinity, a vacant plot, owned by a government agency, has been turned into an open-air latrine. 

 Name and address withheld. 

 Apropos the report ?Dengue dossier sought?, August 24, is fogging the only way to stop dengue? Has the mayor bothered to explore the real causes behind the outbreak? It is well-known that rapid urbanisation and destruction of greenery is a major reason behind the spread of dengue. A study by John Hopkins University, in the US, has confirmed the link. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly. 

 Violence, nudity, rape and dacoity on the small screen have encouraged crime among children of affluent families. Kudos for highlighting the trend in ?Crime run for rich man?s son,? August 29. At the other end of the social scale, large families and poverty often push children to crime at an early age. 

 Juvenile crime is a blot on our society. Television shows with inappropriate content must be banned. Education, guidance and counselling are also vital for curbing crimes by minors. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park 

 It is a matter of regret that a large number of MAs in English from English-medium background opt not to take up lectureship due to poor salary, and become teachers in schools (?Know English, won?t teach college?, August 25). Lecturers must be paid a salary commensurate with their importance in society. The government should immediately look into the matter. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Buy Indian identity for Rs 5,000?, August 24, if a survey is undertaken, it would be found that at least half-a-million people are staying illegally in West Bengal. The politicians let these illegal immigrants flourish for a few more votes. 

 Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park. 

 The report ?Cops glare at car blare?, August 29, made for an interesting read. While I fully agree with the government regarding the measures proposed against people who use cell phones and do not wear helmets while riding two-wheelers, the action being contemplated against those playing music in their cars at high volume has left me baffled. 

 After paying an extra amount to the motor vehicles department for installing a music system in the car, why should a person be fined for using it? West Bengal is the only state in the country, and perhaps the world, where one has to pay a tax for having a music system in the car. 

 Airconditioners, too, attract a levy in the state. 

 Ashim Choudhury,

 Mandeville Gardens.

 Festive, fashionable and functional ? the latest collection from Dolphin Leathers is a blend of all three. Kudos, the new line housing a variety of exclusive handbags, has been designed by NIFT graduate Sreyoshi Mitra.

 Soft textures and fine finish define the bags that come in all shapes and sizes. Ive tried to balance the style quotient with utility, says Sreyoshi. In keeping with the utility focus, the bags are equipped with key rings and mobile holders.

 Made of export-quality material like VT leather, crunchy leather, natural and printed drymill leather, the bags come with an assurance of durability.

 The colour palette ranges from the usual black, brown and beige to splashes of red, blue and olive green.

 The range is home to some unique designs in high- quality leather, says Imran Zaki Siddiqui, co-owner of Dolphin Leathers.

 The Kudos collection is available at the Dolphin Leathers outlets in City Centre and Metro Shopping Centre. Prices start at Rs 300.

 Golden touch

 The World Gold Council, in association with Anglo Gold Ashanti (a gold mining firm), announced the launch of a jewellery design contest for professionals, amateurs, karigars and jewellery design students.

 Titled Auditions, the contest is based on the ethno contemporary (a blend of Indian designs and modern inspirations) theme. The contest was launched at the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton and Towers recently.

 The key idea behind the competition is to identify, recognise and motivate design talent as well as to popularise contemporary designs to suit evolving tastes of consumers.

 Indian women look for innovative styles, but at the same time they dont want to give up traditional designs totally. The motive of the competition is to unearth some novel designs drawn from our rich cultural heritage, says Sanjay Agarwal, managing director, World Gold Council (Indian Subcontinent).

 I have always had this strong belief that India has a lot to offer from its rich past. My association with this competition is an extension of my belief, said designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, brand ambassador of the council. 

 The council is inviting applications till October 30.

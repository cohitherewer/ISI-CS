The Bengali New Year is round the corner and like 

all occasions big and small, it throws up yet another excuse to let down your 

hair and have a blast. Having fun while ringing in the New Year is the idea and 

keeping with the spirit of the festival, you must lend a touch of ethnicity to 

your bash. In fact, to make your party a shade different from the usual Poila 

Baisakh dos, give a trendy twist to tradition, be it with the food, fashion or 

music.

 Dress code

 The ?laal paar sada sari? might sound too cliched ? apart from being an absurd proposition for anything remotely resembling a party ? but with a little bit of funk blended in, you can turn tradition on its head and make a statement out of this ethnic drape. For starters, go for a see-through chiffon or crepe sari in the same combination and team it with an interesting blouse.

 ?Experimenting with the cuts of blouses is the best way to add drama to a sari. Off-the-shoulder peasant-cut blouses go very well with traditional Bengali drapes. Stringy red cholis will lend a sexy feel, while stretch T-shirts paired with a sari give it a trendy look,? feels designer Abhishek Dutta. He also recommends interesting drapes to add a dash of glamour to a simple red-bordered white sari. Accessories like a key chain dangling from your waist or funky waistbands will heighten the drama.

The men could go with a linen kurta paired 

with a brightly coloured dhoti. ?Linen is really hot this season and either 

a kurta or a long jacket made of the fabric can be paired very well with 

a dhoti. But if someone is not too comfortable in a dhoti, a linen 

kurti with denims will also be a good bet to wear at a Poila Baisakh party,? 

adds Dutta.

Food faves

 It?s just not possible to whip up the Bengali flavour without a fishy menu for dinner. Dish out a lavish spread (what?s Poila Baisakh without a sumptuous meal!) with quite a few fish specialities, but here too, beg to differ. Give the usual Ilish Bhapa and Chingri Malaikari a miss as these are not really the best options to be combined with cocktails. Instead, opt for some more exotic varieties and definitely include more boneless options. Whole baked bekti or pomfret, either in the Indian tandoor or the Continental style, should work well for a crowd with mixed tastes. 

 ?This is a great occasion to experiment with Bengali dishes and cook up some fusion flavours. For our Poila Baisakh spread, we are making innovative items like the Bhapa Murgi Kebab, which is a mince meat dumpling flavoured with Bengali spices and served wrapped in banana leaf,? says chef Joymalya Banerjee of Oh! Calcutta.

You can try out some wacky desserts as well. For instance, 

squeeze the sugar syrup out of rosogollas and dip them in a bowl of vodka 

for four to five hours, before springing a sweet surprise on your guests.

Beverage bests

 Whipping up some cool cocktails to wash down the rich and spicy grub is just the thing to do. Moreover, you have to keep the sweltering evenings in mind while planning the menu in the liquid section. While light liquors like vodka, gin and white rum are best for summer cocktail bases, use fruity flavours to top them up. 

 ?While hosting a party at home, one should decide on cocktails that are simple to whip up and more importantly, use easily available ingredients. Fruit juices being readily available in almost every neighbourhood store, it?s a good idea to include these. Also, fruity flavours are very refreshing in summer and hence popular picks during the season,? says Md Nadeem Siddiqui, bar manager at a city resto-bar. 

 He recommends concoctions like Banana Colada (Bacardi rum, coconut cream, pineapple juice and banana chunks), Vodka Melon (vodka, Cointreau and watermelon) and Highland Park (gin, Cr?me de Menthe, lemon juice and soda).

Spare a thought for the non-drinkers as well and offer 

them something beyond colas and juices. Carry the fruity theme here as well and 

blend a few mocktails. Siddiqui suggests ones like Litchi Cooler (kiwi syrup, 

strawberry syrup, vanilla ice cream and litchis), Highway Man (cranberry syrup, 

orange juice, pineapple juice and soda) and Fruit Punch (a straight blend of apple 

juice, watermelon juice and pineapple juice).

Melody matters

 This is one bash where you need to think beyond Hindi remixes. Start off with lounge music and move on to Bangla rock. You can liven up the party by getting a good ?para? band to play live. Otherwise, make do with recorded music churned out by the popular Bangla bands.

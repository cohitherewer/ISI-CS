Say it with a shimmer

Anything goes in the name of embellishments. Picture

Keep away your jewels and other accessories. With 

rhinestones, big coloured stones, beads, shells, sequins, crystals and even buttons 

and hooks doing the rounds as embellishments on outfits, you can happily give 

that choker or stole a miss. 

?The look ranges from the practical to the bizarre 

? stone chips, bits of glass, broken beads, buttons and hooks (in terms of design 

and not fastenings!) ? just about anything goes in the name of embellishment today,? 

says designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh. 

That said, there are trends to look out for in this 

segment. The shimmer of sequins, for example, which dominated the market for years 

on end, is slowly fading out. ?I have not used any sequins at all for my winter 

collection 2004 and don?t intend to use them in summer 2005 either. The overkill 

has made sequins a tad boring now,? says designer Jyoti Khaitan. 

Instead, she vouches for lots of resham, zardosi, 

crystals and glass beads in the shape of drops. In fact, beads in different 

shapes and sizes ? round, cylindrical, oval, triangular and even asymmetrical 

? are all the rage today and can lend an ethnic chic to almost any outfit. 

Innovative use of colour is another way to embellish 

an outfit. Unusual dyeing techniques in a variety of colours and treatments like 

shiny or shimmery is a popular option doing the rounds in the fashion circle.

No rules apply in the use of embellishments, with 

only your imagination dictating their use and treatment. While Jyoti believes 

sequins are completely out of fashion, designer Megha Modi insists they are still 

going strong.

?Sequins are very much in, especially the silver and 

gold varieties. While I use a lot of beads, zari threads and even flower 

embellishments made from tissue, sequins are still a hot favourite,? says Modi. 

If you are looking for a compromise, you can side with Kiran. ?The eye gets tired 

of anything (read: sequins) that has been done in excess. However, sequins are 

still a classic embellishment,? she feels.

At the other end of the spectrum are the new-age metal 

embellishments to doll up everything from bags, shoes to accessories.

?Metal has made a huge impact, not only in India but 

the world over. The look has now become more deglamourised and deconstructed with 

stone on stone textures and intricate Indian kantha work and chikan 

embroidery coming in in a big way,? emphasises designer Nikhil of the label Shantanu 

 amp; Nikhil. ?The look, however, is still very luxurious but needs to be toned 

down further.?

If a country lass look is more your style, there are 

plenty of ribbons, laces, bows and rosettes to choose from. If you want a richer 

detailing, embroidery of every form has seen a huge comeback. Quite a convenient 

trend for the fashion fraternity, considering there is such a vast well of traditional 

Indian weaves, motifs, arts and crafts to draw from.

Add a dash of glamour with crystals and you are ready 

to go!

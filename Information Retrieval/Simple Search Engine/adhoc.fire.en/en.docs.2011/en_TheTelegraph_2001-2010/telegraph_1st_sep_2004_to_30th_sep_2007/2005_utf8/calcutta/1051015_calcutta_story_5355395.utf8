 No budget tourists, please, here?s desperately seeking the high-profile spender from Calcutta.

 After wooing the low-spend traveller with cheap fares, the tourism boards of Southeast Asian countries are now eyeing the splurge tourist ? one who?ll spend time and money in Singapore, sunbathe in the finest resorts at Phuket and Kuala Lumpur, and won?t mind paying a fortune for a watch.

 Every week, about 1,000 Calcuttans travel to Singapore, about 1,500 to Bangkok and the rest of Thailand, and 500 queue up for flights to various Malaysian destinations. ?But only 25 per cent of these tourists are high-end spenders, who would not hesitate to spend Rs 2 lakh on shopping alone, not to forget business-class travel and plush hotel stay,? said Anil Punjabi, Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) chairman (east).

 The top travel bracket still opts for the US, followed by the United Kingdom, Mauritius, Istanbul, Egypt and even Dubai. ?But with proper promotion, that Southeast Asia figure can go up by another 15 per cent,? added Punjabi.

 Taking the lead is Singapore Tourism Board, embarking on mission market to woo the high-spend Calcuttan. ?With the Season of Brilliance underway in Singapore and a wide range of exciting events lined up, we are telling the world that Singapore is the place to be in the next two months,? said Kenneth Lim, regional head (east and north) of the Singapore Tourism Board.

 The main attraction is the Singapore jewellery festival and a unique art auction, apart from a signature watch collection. ?This will be the biggest watch event organised outside Europe and we are expecting a lot of limited-edition items on display during the festivals, to be held till November. Our experience tells us that Calcuttans do not like to be left behind and are connoisseurs when it comes to quality items,? said Lim.

 Apart from the airlines and tourism offices in the city, tour operators will be roped in to woo Calcuttans through booklets, promotions and awareness campaigns organised locally.

 The tourism department of Thailand along with Thai Airways is also busy wooing the elite for several events like the Phuket Cultural Revitalisation in November, followed by mega events on the Mekong and Tapi rivers. ?Our Royal Silk Class is a great hit with Calcuttans,? observed S.C. Kapoor, district sales manager (Calcutta), Thai Airways.

 An impressive event roster has also been drawn up in Kuala Lumpur and other exotic Malaysian locales.

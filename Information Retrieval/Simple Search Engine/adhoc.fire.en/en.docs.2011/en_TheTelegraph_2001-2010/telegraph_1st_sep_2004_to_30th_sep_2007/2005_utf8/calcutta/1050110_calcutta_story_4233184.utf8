Bimal Bhattacharya: There are very a few parks in the Tollygunge-Prince Anwar Shah Road area. Are you doing anything about that?

 We have recently inaugurated a park on Prince Anwar Shah Road, where aged people can take a stroll in the morning and the evening. Though there are restrictions on entry, children, too, can visit the park and play games.

 We are soon going to inaugurate another park, called Indira Park. Moreover, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which is run by our party, has already taken steps to beautify Prince Anwar Shah Road. Work on the project will start soon.

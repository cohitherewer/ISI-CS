The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Private tuition slap for two university teachers

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta University, following complaints by students, has chargesheeted two teachers of the law department for coaching students privately. The authorities have also accused one of the teachers of furnishing false information about his career during appointment.

 The university?s crackdown almost coincides with the state government?s hint at softening its stand on private tuition by teachers at universities and government-aided schools and colleges. 

 Sources at Calcutta University said some students of the law department had lodged complaints with senior officials, including controller of examinations Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, stating that the two teachers had ?forced them to take private tuition for better results?. The students requested Adhikari not to divulge their names.

 A three-member committee, comprising Shyamapada Pal, P.N. Ghosh and Shyamal Sarkar, had been formed to probe the charges. The committee submitted its report to the Syndicate on April 19.

 Recently, the authorities had chargesheeted the two teachers ? Nirmal Kanti Chakraborty and S.S. Chatterjee.

 ?I have not yet received any chargesheet. Naturally, I will not say anything about the so-called charges,? Chakraborty told Metro on Tuesday.

 Chatterjee, however, claimed that the allegations were false. ?I will decide my course of action after I receive the university?s letter,? he said.

 The inquiry committee also found that Chakraborty, in securing a job at the university, had given false statements regarding his stint at Hooghly Mohsin College.

 A member of the Syndicate said Chakraborty had stated in his application that he had been a full-time teacher at the college. ?But inquiry revealed his statement to be absolutely false. His appointment was ad hoc and he was not a permanent teacher there.?

 Chakraborty was appointed in the university?s law department in 1997. Next year, he was promoted to the post of reader and in 2003, he became the head of the department.

 The university?s chargesheet against Chakraborty asked him to explain why he had misled the authorities by making false statements regarding his previous employment.

 The probe panel also found that one of the two teachers had misappropriated funds sanctioned for a students? excursion. ?The wealth accumulated by one of the two teachers is not proportionate to his income,? the Syndicate member said. ?Naturally, we have reasons to question him on how he had gathered such wealth. We have the right to know his sources of income,? he added. 

 Registrar Ujjwal Kumar Basu said: ?A decision has been taken in this regard, but I can?t say anything, as the matter is confidential.?

 Trader held for dubious kidnap

 OUR BUREAU

 A dubious kidnap drama reached a climax late on Thursday, with the arrest of Sanjay Gupta. The Golf Green-based trader has been charged with the abduction of a 22-year-old girl whom he knew well.

 Gupta was rounded up by Nadia police late on Thursday from a hideout on Park Street after the girl?s family lodged a complaint, alleging that the kidnapper had demanded a ransom of Rs 2 lakh.

 Admitting some ?strange? twists to the kidnap tale, police said on Friday that Gupta and the ?kidnapped? girl had known each other for months.

 ?We have enough evidence to prove this. Gupta seems to have been going through a funds crunch and so, decided to earn some quick money by abducting his friend,? said Biswarup Ghosh, additional superintendent of police, Nadia.

 The girl, a resident of Kalyani and a first-year MA student of Jadavpur University, left home on February 26 to go to a relative?s place in Ranaghat. She did not return home that night and the next day, her mother received the first ransom call.

 The girl?s mother lodged a complaint with Kalyani police station. On February 28, police waited for a second ransom call, which came in the evening. ?The kidnapper had used a landline and the number and location were traced to Park Street,? said Ghosh.

 For the next two days, police launched a hunt for the girl, photograph in hand. ?She was spotted on March 2 evening, walking down Park Street to hail a taxi. We took her back to Kalyani,? said an official, adding that she had refused to divulge details about the kidnapper.

 ?We received a tip-off on Thursday. A team of policemen rushed to the spot and arrested Gupta from the house where the girl appears to have been kept ?confined? for four days,? said an officer of Kalyani police station.

 When the call statement records of the girl?s mobile phone showed that Gupta had called her several times before the so-called abduction, she said she never thought ?a friend like Gupta would abduct her?, said an officer.

 As for her disappearance, the girl told police she remembers waiting for a train at Kalyani station with Gupta. ?How I reached Park Street, I can?t recall,? she claimed.

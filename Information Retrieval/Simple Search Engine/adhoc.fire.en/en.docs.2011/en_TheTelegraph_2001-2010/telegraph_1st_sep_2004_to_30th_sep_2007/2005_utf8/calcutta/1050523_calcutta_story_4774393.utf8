The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?There will be references to Ray and Ghatak?

 As she gets ready to take Calcutta to the world stage with the celluloid adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri rsquo;s The Namesake, MIRA NAIR speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about throwing together a motley cast and crew to take the next step in her cinematic growth

 Instinctive and moody are the first words that come to mind about Mira Nair. She might be sipping her glass of wine and taking a pull of a hookah in an empty nightclub and not talk to you and then again, she could have her cast and crew waiting, to oblige you with a 30-minute interview.

 And it?s not just the media; even film projects can be at the wrong end of her fleeting fancy. Homebody/Kabul and The Impressionist suddenly found themselves in queue once Mira chanced upon Jhumpa Lahiri?s novel about ?immigration and identity?, The Namesake, on just another flight.

 The rights were bought, the script written and soon started the journey from a snowing New York to a sweltering Calcutta. Everybody ? from a sprightly Zuleikha Robinson to an ailing Ruma Guhathakurta ? lined up to face the camera handled by Frederick Elmes, the man behind Kinsey and The Ice Storm.

 Stylistically, Mira wants to take The Namesake to a higher level, having already set a benchmark for the ensemble drama genre with the free-flowing Monsoon Wedding. ?Every movie is a step to grow. Here I am using three different chromatic formats for three periods. While the early years are being shown in black-and-white, the images of the middle years are being bleached out and the modern day is in normal colour.?

 If every frame of Kill Bill had Tarantino paying tribute to the films he grew up watching, don?t be surprised if Namesake turns out to be Mira?s homage to the Bengali auteurs. ?Ritwik Ghatak is my favourite director ? his films taught me how to shoot a tree and Ray is someone I have known and liked. Yes, there will be references galore.?

 While there have been rejections aplenty ? Rani Mukherjee, Konkona Sen Sharma, Abhishek Bachchan, all opting out ? Mira is happy with the final cast. ?Kal Penn paid for his flight tickets to meet me and audition for the main role of Gogol. Then, he gave me three reasons as to why I should cast him. One was the fact that he felt a brown person could act in a Hollywood film after watching my Mississippi Masala at the age of eight. Two was his liking for the name Gogol and three, he bought The Namesake for everyone he loved.?

 As for Irrfan and Tabu as Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli, the repeat casting of the Maqbool pair did have her thinking initially. ?I like to cast a completely different set of people every time. But they are such a powerful duo and theirs is the hottest chemistry I have seen in years. Very much like Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren. Also, their roles are so amazingly different in Namesake. There?s so much tenderness, music, depth and unspoken words between them. I have also added layer upon layer to that.?

 Apart from having London-based Nitin Soni cooking up a musical storm ? no Mychael Danna this time ? Mira is using Rabindrasangeet extensively. ?She isn?t really a professional, but Ashima is a fledgling singer. All my Bengali friends have different modes of expression and so I made her a singer, whose songs start and end the film. I have used my favourite Rabindrasangeet Je raate mor??

 Mira has been torn apart by critics world over for murdering William Thackeray?s Vanity Fair in the deserts of Rajasthan but her tryst with Lahiri?s maiden novel may not be as contentious. ?I love the book, I love the shifting times. There are augmentations here and there but that?s natural. There?s bound to be some condensation when you adapt a book to the cinematic form.?

 Shyam Benegal tried it, Pradeep Sarkar is taking a shot too, but perhaps it will be Mira who will be able to take Calcutta to the world stage once Namesake releases worldwide in September 2006. ?My films do reach the world. A third of the funding (apart from UTV Motion Pictures and Fox Searchlight Pictures) of Namesake is from Japan (Entertainment Farm), where my films are loved for some unknown reason!?

 Perhaps the key to a Mira Nair film is the transformation of a motley cast and crew of multicoloured people into a joint family of like-minded members. From Irrfan to Tanushree Shankar, Kal Penn to Tamal Sengupta, Mira?s jaadu ki jhappi works wonders. No wonder, she has been given the arduous task of ?taking Bollywood to Hollywood? with Gangster MD.

 ?My son Zoran forced me to watch Munnabhai MBBS and I walked out of the theatre with this Afro-American version in mind. Vinod Chopra is an old childhood friend and we decided to make the film in Hollywood. The script is being readied and I?m planning to cast Chris Tucker in the lead.?

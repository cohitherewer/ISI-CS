 Cop rein on rowdy Holi revellers

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Holi revellers, watch out. Calcutta Police will be out on the streets this year, and if you?re caught drunk, they won?t hesitate to throw you behind bars. 

 At a meeting of the police top brass, including the divisional deputy commissioners of police, at Lalbazar on Tuesday, it was decided that no act of Holi hooliganism would be tolerated. In case of wheel-borne revellers hitting the speed lane, cops will intercept the vehicle and take appropriate action.

 ?You are welcome to make merry, but not at the expense of others. We are warning revellers moving in groups not to cross the limit,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central). 

 Insiders claim the decision to crack down on mobile groups follows a flood of complaints last year, particularly from the southern end of the city. Youth gangs were reported for rowdyism and even misbehaving with women.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee has specifically asked the officers-in-charge of 48 police stations to be more vigilant on Friday. ?There should be no eve-teasing or any untoward incident,? Mukherjee has reportedly ordered his force.

 In trying to ensure this, cops this year have asked people to stay away from celebrating Holi on the thoroughfares. 

Leaflets ? in Hindi and Bengali ? carrying the Dos 

and the Don?ts are being distributed to ensure that revellers are forewarned. 

Don't:

Splash colour on unwilling people

Move around drunk in speeding vehicles

Use spurious colours or other substances, including mud and cowdung.

Do:

Maintain communal harmony

Dial 100 in case of any problem or dial the police control at 2214-3230 or 

2214-5000. Also, keep your local police station posted.

 ?We have urged highrise residents not to pour coloured water from the rooftops or throw balloons on passersby,? said Barun Mullick, deputy commissioner (north).

 Additional commissioners and the officers-in-charge of local police stations have been asked to hold the final round of talks with coordination committees to finalise strategic points where police pickets will be posted to ensure peaceful revelry.

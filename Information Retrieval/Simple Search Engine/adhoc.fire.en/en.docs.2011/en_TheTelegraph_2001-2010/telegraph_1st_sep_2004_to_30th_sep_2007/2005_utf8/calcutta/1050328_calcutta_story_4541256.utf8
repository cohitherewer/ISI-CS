 Sandip Banerjee: What are the spheres of jurisdiction of the pollution control board?

 There is a misconception that the pollution control board is supposed to look into all causes of pollution. Though one of the responsibilities of the board is to keep a tab on pollution, it has to work under a set of Central rules, framed under the guidance of the environment and ecology wing of the government.

 According to the guidelines, we follow 12 laws that are related to water, air and noise pollution. Solid waste management, bio-medical waste management and recycling of plastics are also covered by this set of laws. The laws give us enough teeth to manage hazardous waste.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Port told to chop its logs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to eliminate a potential death risk on the road, the police are going to ban carrying logs from the port area in lorries or trailers. 

 The traffic department will issue the ban soon.

 As a first step in that direction, senior officers, including special additional commissioner (traffic) Banibrata Basu and deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Sharma, met representatives of Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and of importers? and transporters? associations on Friday. 

 Among the CPT officials present at the meeting was land manager Gautam Dasgupta. ?We have clearly told them that they will have to slice the logs with electronic saws on the CPT premises before loading them on vehicles. Otherwise, we will not allow a single vehicle to come out of the port area,? said Basu.

 Elaborating on what led police to impose the restriction, an officer of the traffic department said: ?A few days ago, a Maruti Omni had been badly damaged by logs protruding from a lorry. The lorry driver did not notice the car when he put his vehicle on reverse gear.?

 The Maruti driver had a narrow escape, as the logs smashed through his vehicle?s windscreen.

 At Friday?s meeting, the CPT officials told police that their law-book does not contain any provision for slicing logs on the port premises.

 ?We have asked them to sort out the problem because the restriction is sure to be imposed and not before long,? Basu asserted.

 Traffic cops will be deployed in front of all gates through which log-laden vehicles leave the port compound. 

 ?Our officers will search every vehicle to ensure that the ban is not violated. If any truck or trailer is found violating the ban, we will not allow it to leave the port premises,? special additional commissioner Basu asserted.

Blood donation: Residents of Salt Lake and 

its adjoining areas donated blood on Sunday morning, to mark the killing of three 

persons at a soiree in Nayapatti last year. Local Trinamul Congress councillors 

and Pankaj Banerjee, Opposition leader in the Assembly, were present on the occasion. 

Hatkata Dilip was allegedly behind the murders.

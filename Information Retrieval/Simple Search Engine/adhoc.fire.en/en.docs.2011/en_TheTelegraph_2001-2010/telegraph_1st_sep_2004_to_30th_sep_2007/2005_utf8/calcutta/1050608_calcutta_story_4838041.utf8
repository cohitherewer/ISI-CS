 You share your birthday with...

 Shilpa Shetty 

You?re something of a self-made person and learn from experience. You have a good idea of how to get things done. You are an affectionate and considerate person. Sloppiness irritates you. Don?t mistake on-the-job friendliness for honesty. You are a big thinker, with big ideas and lots of thought capacity. You just have to get to the top. ? Kusum Bhandari

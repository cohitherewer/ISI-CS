 It is observed that on normal days, traffic policemen are not very active. Vehicles standing in the extreme left lane conveniently veer and take a right turn, and vice versa. To add to our misery, the traffic policemen on the spot remain silent spectators to the chaos. But the scene changes completely whenever a VIP?s convoy is on the move within the city. Besides the regular traffic policemen, we also spot traffic sergeants and other senior officers on the roads diverting traffic. Needless to say, the VIPs enjoy a smooth sail through the city roads at the cost of blocking the common man?s path. It often takes more than an hour for these blockades to clear. Is this kind of overture necessary? They should chalk out traffic arrangements on the routes that VIPs take beforehand.

 Money order forms are not available in Parnashree post office, in Behala, for the past 20 days. Every day, the staff there say they don?t know when the forms would be available. The situation is as bad in Behala post office.

 The interest of city youth in hockey has declined considerably over the years. In the Sixties and early Seventies, the hockey league and the Beighton Cup used to be played with much enthusiasm. The clash of prominent teams from the city used to attract spectators. A large number of coaching camps flourished, producing talented hockey players year after year. Nowadays, hockey matches are lacklustre. The state sports department should take measures to revive the interest of the city?s youth in this sport. Hockey legends residing in the city can play a positive role in this regard.

 Railway authorities provide a blanket, two sheets, a pillow and a towel to each passenger in air-conditioned coaches. The blanket is not always very clean since it is used over and over again. It would not be feasible for the railway to dry clean the blankets after every use. I would suggest that the blankets be put inside washable covers. Not only will it be hygienic, but also convenient.

 A foul smell hangs in the air in the vicinity of Kidderpore bridge and Zeerut bridge. Sewage running in the canal beneath the bridges emits an obnoxious smell. Makeshift shanties have come up near the canal adding to the pollution. Commuters face a tough task in passing through the area. Will the authorities dredge the canal?

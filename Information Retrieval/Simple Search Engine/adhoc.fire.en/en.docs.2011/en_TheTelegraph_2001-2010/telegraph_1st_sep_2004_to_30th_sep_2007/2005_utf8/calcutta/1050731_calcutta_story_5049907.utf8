The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Man acts as machine

 Customer relationship management begs 

 human intervention

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 The 

 lines went dead. This was an export house and it was a working 

 day. Some foreign buyers were waiting for quotes, some were 

 expecting supply schedules, yet others wanted confirmation 

 of despatch. The lifeline of the company had suddenly been 

 snatched away.

 The connection was provided by 

 a leading Internet Service Provider. The booklet provided 

 a number to be called for service. Exchanges were professional 

 ? the user name was verified, a complaint was recorded and 

 a reference number was provided. The lady who took the call 

 had no idea. To her this was a call from a user account, 

 period. It did not matter to her what that fault meant to 

 the user. Her training did not cover such intangible issues. 

 The focus was on time taken to receive the call, whether 

 the greetings were appropriate for the time of the day, 

 etc. Functional attributes that emanated from a need to 

 be efficient rather than compassionate.

 The second incident was far more 

 domestic. Mother-in-law was ill. The doctor was specific 

 ? under no circumstances should the temperature rise above 

 a 102 degrees. A cloth soaked in ice-cold water on her forehead 

 was the prescription. It had to happen then. The refrigerator 

 started misbehaving. Ice took longer than usual to form. 

 Then water began its tantrums, it refused to chill. A similar 

 call was made. An identical sounding lady from a completely 

 different location went through an identical drill. 

 The daughter-in-law was left with 

 a complaint number, a lot of tension, and a fervent hope 

 that the neighbour?s fridge was in working condition. The 

 lady who took the complaint on the phone was explained the 

 criticality of the situation. She could do very little ? 

 the complaint form on her computer screen had no provision 

 where such details could be fitted in.

 Both calls were received in locations 

 far away from Calcutta. They were listed as service centre 

 numbers. In reality, they were information centres. It is 

 a customer information system that is scientifically designed 

 and operates efficiently. The system designer does a very 

 good job from the brief he gets. From the mere mention of 

 the name of the customer, the system identifies all relevant 

 details like the kind of equipment that is involved, the 

 location of the equipment, the previous fault records, etc. 

 Retrieval and transmission of such data happen very fast. 

 The very best of information technology is put to work.

 That unfortunately is an incomplete 

 definition of service. True, the service the customers expect 

 is a rectification of the fault. But even before that, they 

 expect something else. They want the service provider to 

 empathise. They expect someone to appreciate the unexpected 

 hardship they have been forced to contend with.

 Management of consumer anxiety 

 is a critical component of service. The engineer who designed 

 the consumer information system for the service department 

 never got the brief. The trainer at the call centre was 

 never concerned about such softer issues of servicing. The 

 wisdom thus never reached the lady who took the call.

 As it is often said, machines 

 do not have hearts. It is unreasonable to expect them to 

 build relationships with anyone, let alone a customer. Customer 

 relationship management thus begs human intervention. Time 

 has now come to add to that learning. Human beings working 

 in close proximity of machines run the risk of becoming 

 one.

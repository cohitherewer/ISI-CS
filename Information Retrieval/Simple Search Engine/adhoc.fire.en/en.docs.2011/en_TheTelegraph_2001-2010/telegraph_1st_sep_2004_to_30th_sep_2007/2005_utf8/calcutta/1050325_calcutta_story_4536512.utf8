The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Low-down on highrise

 A moment from Shirir Neeche

 The spotlight is on them, though not necessarily for the right reasons. Almost every day, newspapers report some incident involving them, resulting in the entire community coming under the scanner and the needle of suspicion hovering over their brittle existence. Welcome to the world of domestic helps, cooks, liftmen and security guards ? an essential by-product of the highrise culture that has smitten the urban upper and middles classes.

 While possession of such a prized tenement counts as a climb up the social ladder for their ?employers?, for the ?employed? it means new aspirations constantly under threat of the whims of those above. Therefore, Ensemble?s latest theatre offering Shirir Neeche is extremely relevant in the present-day scenario. 

 The taut script woven around director Sohag Sen?s concept has evolved through workshops and inputs from the group members. The play revolves around characters employed in different capacities in various flats in a highrise and their regular rendezvous below the staircase, where they gossip, pour out their woes and even find solace in each other?s company. A theft in one of the flats, where the domestic help has disappeared with valuables, puts the entire lot under a cloud of suspicion.

 The characters have been carefully chosen to portray a kind of realism rarely witnessed on the Bengali stage. Thus, we have the married Bihari liftman Ramlal (Kaushik Bose) striking up a romantic relationship with Sita Devi; cook Kamala (Sutapa Ghosh) who hides her Muslim identity to keep her job with the orthodox Brahmin family; Bhagawati (Madhuchhanda Ghosh) who has served a family for over two decades but is locked out of the flat after the theft, when the members are away; Farah (Sangeeta Chakravarti), personal assistant to an actress with the usual airs; driver Gopal (Prasenjit Ghosh) who keeps egging Farah on to put in a good word with her mistress so that he could get a role in films.

 Then, there?s the person from Orissa who keeps swearing by the name of Lord Jagannath; Hasan (Dipak Ghosh), a good soul who ignores the overtures of Farah and decides to marry Bhagawati; the security guard turning a blind eye to the pilferage of the odd-jobs man for alcoholic favours.

 The effort to bring in dramatic elements without having to resort to melodrama or gimmicks has always been a strong point of Sen?s productions. The positive effects of mounting a production through workshops are amply reflected not only in the high quality of performances but also in the sets, lighting and choreography.

 The stairs forming the main set and leading up to the upper echelons of the apartment complex are very well conceived and executed by Mono Dutta, creating the impression of a clear divide between those above and below. The choreographed song sequences reveal the possibilities of blending entertainment with serious themes and enhancing the interest of the audience. The music by Neel Dutt caters to popular taste, yet retains the down-to-earth flavour of the lyrics by Rajatava Dutta and Sohag Sen.

 The idea to use one zone of the stage for the scenes on the interrogation of the characters at the police station, without actually showing the interrogators, works well. So does the ploy of using recorded off-voices for telephone conversations between the apartment owners and their friends and relatives.

 Apart from entertaining the viewer, the play throws up questions of attitudes and responsibilities that seem to get affected by changing lifestyles in a consumerist society. It touches upon issues that need to be addressed at a more serious level. For instance, the tendency to brand an entire category as suspects for an isolated incident of theft, or the prejudice that members of a minority community are prone to crime by nature.

 When one suddenly acquires some money and pseudo-status in society by moving up the stairs of highrise apartments, logic, rationality and trust suddenly get thrown to the winds, as in the case of the employers of Bhagawati in this play.

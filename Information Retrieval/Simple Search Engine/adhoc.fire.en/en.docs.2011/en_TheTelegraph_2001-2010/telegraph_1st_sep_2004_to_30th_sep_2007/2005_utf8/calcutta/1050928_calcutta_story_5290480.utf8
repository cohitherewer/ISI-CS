 At a time when eating addresses all over town are taking the Bangla route in the run-up to the Pujas, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers has decided to tread a different path.

 Eden Pavilion, the 24-hour multi-cuisine restaurant, is playing host to The Americas, a festival showcasing daily changing foods predominantly from Canada, Mexico and USA, as well as a few Latin American and Chinese American Dishes.

 Spearheaded by executive chef Ramesh Javvaji, some signature dishes on the menu are Assorted Cajun Vegetable Fritters, Spiced Spud Skins with Creole Sauce, Cajun and Creole Dishes such as Peppered Calamari Rings, Cajun Spiced Fried Fish, Louisiana Gumbo Soup and Blackened Chicken Supreme. As starters, the Broccoli Soup and the American Fried Chicken stand out. A variety of preparations in salmon and crab add to the main-course buffet.

 Says chef Javvaji: I decided to put to good use all the skills that I had picked up in preparing American food while in Canada and the US. People here have no idea of the variations in flavour that American food has to offer.

 To end your meal on a sweet note, there is an Amaretto Cheese Cake with a wild berry compote, a British Columbia Nanimo Bar with peanut fudge sauce or Butter Almond Tart.

 The buffet spread would be laid out only for dinner between 7.30 pm and 11.45 pm. It is priced at Rs 750 exclusive of taxes and includes unlimited Kingfisher beer to go with the grub.

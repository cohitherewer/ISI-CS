The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Full fare in festive air 

Puja plans and flight schedules

 NISHA LAHIRI

 The summer holidays are hardly a distant memory, but Calcutta has already started planning for the Pujas. 

 And if you?re raring to fly high on apex fares this October, be prepared to crash-land in full-fare zone.

 With three months to go for the festive break, low fares on airlines are already going, going, gone? And if the grumbles of Puja travellers are growing, the airlines can?t stop grinning.

 ?I booked my tickets for the south on Jet Airways, but all apex fares were sold out by Tuesday. Only the regular fares were available for Hyderabad, Bangalore and Mangalore,? complained a Puja traveller.

 The reason is a combination of rush and rejig. 

 ?The airlines often manipulate the system, depending on the season. If it?s off-season, like July-August, then more seats will be available at cheaper rates,? said Manoj Saraf, managing director, Gainwell Travels.

 ?During vacation time, when they know that the flights will go pretty full anyway, there are fewer seats available at the cheap rates, And in Calcutta, this phenomenon peaks during the Pujas,? he added.

 How many low-fare seats are slashed during peak Puja rush? With the airlines going silent on the figures ? while admitting that the system is ?dynamic? ? travel agents can only guess how drastic the reduction of discounted numbers can be, given that July is not enough to book October low fares on busy sectors.

 Indian Airlines recently launched its Easy Fares scheme and the response has been ?tremendous?, according to a spokesperson, with plenty more bookings expected for the Puja period.

 Air Sahara started its Solar Fares scheme this week, and the expectations are ?high? for the October holidays. Jet Airways, of course, still has fast-disappearing apex fares.

 ?Traditionally, the Puja period is chock-a-block anyway. So, the number of seats on low fares are often reduced,? said an airlines source.

 For example, the fares on Air Sahara are dynamic. So, while there are seven levels in the fare structure, with the cheapest pegged at 70 per cent lower than regular rates, the number of seats on offer at the different prices will change according to demand.

 Air Deccan, the only domestic low-cost carrier in Calcutta, also has Puja plans, despite chronic hiccups in its operations here. From July 25, three new flights to the Northeast, Aizawl, Bagdogra and Bhubaneswar, will be up and flying.

 ?There have been a few problems in Calcutta, but we plan to buy six Airbuses by March 2006, hopefully two by September. That will reduce the number of cancellations here,? said John K. Kuruvilla, chief revenue officer and head, commercial.

 Air Deccan flights from the city have been going around 96 per cent full, with the Puja expectations at 100 per cent, at least to Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai, he added.

 On the international front, Cosmic Air flights to Kathmandu for the Pujas have already been fixed at around Rs 5,400 return, while Jetstar Asia is also set to launch its Calcutta-Singapore sector by August. 

 ?By then, the bookings rush will really kick in for the Pujas,? added Saraf.

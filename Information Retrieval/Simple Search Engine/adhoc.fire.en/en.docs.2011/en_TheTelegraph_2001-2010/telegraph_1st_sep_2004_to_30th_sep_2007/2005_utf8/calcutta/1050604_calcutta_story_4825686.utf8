 Dash of Ash in Oprah 

 Aishwarya Rai: Representing 

 India

If you need a good laugh, this 

 is a show to catch. No, Oprah Winfrey has not metamorphosed 

 into Jerry Seinfeld, nor is Aishwarya Rai aping Johnny Lever. 

 But the conversation between the two is outright comical. 

 The beaming beauty of Bollywood will be on beam in the highly 

 rated chat show in the Women of the World section of the 

 Oprah Winfrey Show this Sunday at 8.30 pm on STAR 

 World. 

 For those of us back home, there will also be new insights on offer. About the film industry and Indian women and their love life. Sample this as an introduction to Bollywood: ?When things start to sizzle on the big screen in Bollywood, they start singing?.?

 And to Rai: ??it (Bollywood) is the home to the most famous actress in the world, somebody you might never have heard of. Her name is Aishwarya Rai.?

 A shade too bathetic to be flattering? But this was the moment of magic Ash was waiting for. She has gone on record to say: ?I thought how wonderful it?d be to be in her (Oprah?s) show. And within a month I was on her show.? Just like magic.

 If Ash was all giggles in the David Letterman show, this time much of the action comes from Winfrey. From enacting what in her mind is a Kamasutra-inspired ?I looove Youuu? by Indian women to getting the pant suit-clad Aishwarya to drape her in a sari, on camera.

 Mandira, Sameer 

 and Sehwag: MAX effect

 There?s a new member in the SET Max brand team. After Mandira Bedi and the chhota ladka, Sameer Khan, it?s time for none other than Virender Sehwag to join the vibrant team. The Nawab of Najafgarh will not only be an integral part of MAX?s programming, marketing and promotion efforts, but would also be closely associated with the channel in the run-up to the forthcoming ICC tournaments like the ICC Super Series 2005, the ICC Champions Trophy 2006 and the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2007.

 Becoming the new face of MAX is something Sehwag is ?delighted? about. ?The channel has been a pioneer in taking the excitement and entertainment named cricket to millions of new viewers like women and children,? he said at the official announcement in Mumbai. ?I look forward to a long and exciting innings with MAX.?

 For the biggies in Sony Entertainment Television (SET), Sehwag?s addition to the brand roster is a big boost. ?His drive and energy, and his ability to entertain people are truly reflective of the passion and deewanapan that MAX stands for,? said Kunal Dasgupta, CEO of SET.

 Hrithik Roshan: Padding up

 Last time round, Saif Ali Khan broke his leg and Arshad Warsi had to step in to perform. No wonder, this time Abhishek Bachchan has already asked Arshad to learn his steps. But Abhishek needn?t worry since unlike last year, this year?s IIFA Awards will host a celebrity cricket match and not a soccer showdown.

 The three-day IIFA weekend in Amsterdam will not only feature the awards ceremony and the world premiere of Pradeep Sarkar?s Parineeta, but also include the IIFA Foundation Celebrity Cricket Match, to be played at the Olympic Stadium on June 10. The match is being played to raise funds for various charity projects undertaken for the welfare of artistes from the Indian film industry.

 Set up as Shah Rukh?s XI vs Hrithik Roshan?s XI, the players in the two teams include the likes of Anil Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Abhishek Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Fardeen Khan, Zayed Khan, Jimmy Shergill, Arshad Warsi and David Dhawan. Even ex-cricketers Mohammed Azharuddin and Aravinda D?Silva will be part of the foundation match. 

 The commentators for the game will be actors Boman Irani and Chunkey Pandey with actress Neelam providing the extra innings for the viewers.

 The country?s largest opinion poll on the Hindi film industry is back again. Sabsey Favourite Kaun (SFK) on the STAR network has the entire nation voting for their favourite stars. Unlike other awards, the voting for SFK is not just for one film or one performance. 

 Hosted by the hilarious Arshad Warsi who takes on several avatars ? Circuit the biggest bhai, Devdas the eternal lover, Tara Singh the truck driver,Yusuf bhai... ? the show has audiences voting in five categories: Sabsey Favourite Hero, Heroine, Comic Hero, Naya Hero and Nayi Heroine.

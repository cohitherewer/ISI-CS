 THE DVD

 (Landmark, Rs 599) It?s a 1992 documentary on axe-guru Joe Satriani. That should 

be enough for the Satch fanatic to go out and buy this DVD. But for the rest, 

there are MTV-style music videos. Also chronicles Satriani?s music creation process 

through interviews. Bonus: Satch playing acoustic guitar for the docu.

communalism or any sort of discrimination. The session will be interspersed with 

play reading by Lee Alison Sibley, Renu Roy and Mira Kakkar. 

THE DISPLAY

 (Artisana, 

10 am-7.30 pm, till March 14) Organised by Crafts Council of West Bengal, the 

exhibition-cum-sale offers saris from traditional weavers and indigo dyers ? Gadwal

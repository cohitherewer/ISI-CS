 India on world flower map

Flower power has acquired a new meaning for a group 

of women from the city. For the power of the petal has transported them to the 

world stage where they will be the only Indians representing the country among 

42 other nations.

 In April 2005, 10 women from the city, all members of the flower arrangers? body Pushpa Bitan, will be flying off to Japan to take part in the World Association of Flower Arrangers (WAFA) contest, 2005.

 This is the second time India will be represented at the world forum. The first occasion was three years ago, when the same contest was held at Glasgow.

 The participants who have chosen one theme each from a list laid down by the WAFA are busy researching various types of arrangements, kinds of flowers and presentation styles before they arrive at the final competition-worthy form.

 ?We are expected to send in the list of flowers that we will use for the contest to WAFA by March 30, so we have to have our arrangements finalised before that,? says Kavita Poddar, secretary, Pushpa Bitan.

 Three women on the 10-member team ? Poddar, Gaurangi Agarwal and Madhvi Khinji ? will be competing in three out of 36 listed competitive categories. 

 Parul Swarup will showcase her arrangement in the non-competitive section, while six others are travelling as observers or for various exhibitions.

 ?Two of us have competed in world contests before while two others are competing for the first time,? smiles Poddar. 

 Winning aside, this is a chance to put India on the flower-arranging world map. The opportunity is also a notable distinction, as WAFA membership is by invitation only and is cleared by vote of existing members of the association.

 ?We have a long way to go before we figure in the top few nations as far as this art form is concerned, but this too isn?t a bad beginning,? signs off Poddar, on behalf of the proud members.

 Today?s question: Will the new pandal rules rob Durga puja of its grandeur?

 I don?t think the Puja will lose its grandeur if the new rules are enforced. Instead, the celebrations will become safer and more enjoyable. There won?t be traffic problems like previous years and regulation of the crowds won?t pose a challenge. Not only the common people, but also the cops will have a better Puja. 

 Sayan Basu, 

 Raja Ram Mohan Roy Road

 Reasonable restrictions on pujas are necessary to minimise the inconvenience caused to the common people. Worship by causing discomfort to others cannot be beneficial. If the pandal rules are implemented, the Puja will be just as grand, only more peaceful.

 Ratan Gupta, 

 Behala

 The new regulations will definitely not rob Durga puja of its grandeur. On the contrary, they will allow the revellers to enjoy themselves without facing hassles like traffic snarls. It must be kept in mind that Puja is a religious festival meant to be held in peace and tranquillity. Grandeur should not be a necessary part of it.

 The new pandal rules are most welcome. The community pujas break traffic rules in the name of public sentiment and create a lot of problems for the common people.

 Tuhin Purkayastha,

 There is no way rules will come in the way of enjoyment during Puja.

 Bhupen Bose,

 Grand pandals draw crowds during the Pujas, but that does not mean that the organisers can encroach on the space meant for vehicles. They should follow the rules and concentrate on the idol.

 Joydeep Chatterjee, 

 Shyambazar

 The new pandal rules will not rob Durga puja of its grandeur. The Puja is for the people, therefore everyone should be at ease during the festival days. The new rules will not only make traffic movement more systematic but will also prove to be lifesavers during emergencies. The Puja organisers should cooperate with the government and abide by the rules.

 Ronita Dutta, 

 Jadavpur

 The pandal rules can be relaxed a little, since the Pujas are held only over four days in a year. The committees should discuss the issue with the administration and come up with the best possible system.

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane

 Observance of the pandal rules won?t affect Puja grandeur. Instead it would lead to a healthy atmosphere and an obstacle-free Puja.

 A.K. Mitra,

 Padda Pukur Road

 Rules and restrictions cannot rob the Puja grandeur. The main hindrance is that most of the Puja organisers belong to the Opposition parties and hence they tend to disobey the rules formulated by the ruling coalition.

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala

 The new pandal rules are welcome as they aim to ensure the safety and convenience of people. The most conspicuous aspect of the pandals are their decoration and not their size. I don?t think the revellers will be too disappointed with smaller pandals. The Puja organisers should keep in mind the Puja is more a festival than a religious event.

 Deblina Chakrabarti,

 Behala

 The new rules will be of great convenience to the people. Our artisans are talented enough to build brilliant pandals without violating the rules.

 Gautam Khan,

 Rajkumar Kundu Lane

 Violation of rules do not lead to Puja grandeur. Besides, huge pandals are simply a waste of money.

 Kanai Saha,

 Address not given

 There should be cooperation between the police and puja organisers regarding erection of pandals. The rules, if followed strictly, will benefit the public. I do not think they will dampen the festive spirit.

 R.N. De Bhowmik,

 PC Lahiri Sarani

 The new pandal rules will spoil the glamour associated with the Pujas. But that should not deter the organisers from following the rules, because safety cannot be compromised for glamour. Encroachment of roads and blocking of traffic should not be indulged in. Steps should be taken to ensure that the organisers construct pandals with fire-resistant material, properly electrify them and do not use microphone at volumes higher than the permissible level.

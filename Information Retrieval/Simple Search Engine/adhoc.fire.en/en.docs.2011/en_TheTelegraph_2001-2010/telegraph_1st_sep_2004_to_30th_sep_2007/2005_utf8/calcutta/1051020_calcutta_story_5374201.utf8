 Remains of the four days: A familiar scene 

in every waterbody on Dashami 

The photograph of a man standing on a Ganesh idol, 

removing dead fish from a lake in Ahmedabad, in which several idols had been immersed 

(September 19), highlights the threat posed by pollution to the existence of all 

living beings. Plaster of Paris and chemical dyes used in the idols were primarily 

responsible for the abnormal death of the fish in the lake. 

 Several rules and regulations are being framed by the central and state governments to protect the environment from pollution and ensure the safety of plants and animals. But adequate steps are often not taken for the implementation of these rules. 

 For want of awareness, most people do not attach much importance to environmental laws. Their negligence is the greatest danger that the society faces. 

 The authorities, including the governments, are responsible for making the people aware of the importance of a pollution-free environment. Once people understand the harmful effects of pollution, they would automatically try to protect the earth. 

 At the same time, the governments need to ensure that the rules and regulations framed from time to time as a shield against pollution are strictly adhered to. Cases of violation should attract the strictest of penalties. 

 Rules and regulations are meaningless in the absence of public awareness and punitive action. And at the end of the day, it is government that can ensure both. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Apropos ?Walk, says Subhas as bus, taxi slam brakes?, September 20, the commuters are forced to witness a charade between the private bus operators and the state government every time there is an increase in fuel price. The government invariably embraces defeat at a huge cost to the ordinary people. 

 Both parties carefully forget that the fare structure is determined considering the sitting and standing capacity of the buses and the assumption that each passenger travels a distance of 4 km. The commuters, however, are packed into overcrowded buses and often get off before 4 km. The operators thus earn many times the estimated amount. 

 The inefficiency of the public sector transport operators has also proved to be a boon for the private players. 

Jatindra Nath Bhowmick,

Kalyani. 

It is ironical that our transport minister is unaware 

of the implication of a transport strike. His statement is a ploy to shun responsibility. 

The keen interest in easing the burden of transporters without sparing a thought 

for the people smacks of vested interest. The Left Front?s apparent opposition 

to the fuel price hike is an eyewash. Unless the chief minister wants to remain 

forever the merchant of an industrial dream, he should rein in Subhas Chakraborty. 

Subhankar Mukherjee, 

Borehat, Burdwan. 

The transport minister?s observation that people should 

walk to their workplaces on the days of transport strike is most unwelcome. His 

reckless attitude resulted in endless passenger inconvenience. Even students on 

their way to exams were stranded as a result. 

Ratan Kumar Halder, 

Behala. 

The transport minister?s statement on the eve of the 

bus strike was unbecoming. It showed his indifference to the suffering millions. 

The mandarins only make a show of being concerned about the downtrodden. 

Govinda Bakshi, 

Budge Budge. 

It?s an utter shame that the state government did 

not do anything to prevent the 48-hour transport strike in the city. On the contrary, 

the transport minister asked the people to walk, if necessary. It seems a long 

stint in power and lack of an opposition have made the government believe that 

it can get away with anything. No matter how hard the chief minister tries to 

woo foreign investors, a city that is brought to a standstill by goons of the 

political parties will never prosper. 

Avishek Ganguly, 

Howrah. 

Apropos ?Mayor rues lack of support from NGOs in vector war?, September 15, I am not a member of any NGO, but I still believe that private organisations are by the side of suffering residents more often than not. For a long time, the mayor maintained that the media was blowing up the news of dengue spread, before admitting that a significant percentage of the population has been affected by the disease. Had he admitted the dengue problem earlier, may be more NGOs would have sprung to his aid. And the non-governmental bodies any day do a better job than civic workers. 

Kamruddin Ahmed, 

Bandpur, Hooghly. 

Apropos the report ?Burdened, bruised, burnt?, September 15, it is not the first time a tale of torture of child labourers has made the pages of newspapers. Such incidents are commonplace in most homes that employ children as domestic helps. Only by enforcing child labour laws can the situation be improved. 

Sourish Misra,

Salt Lake. 

The civic move to charge an immersion fee from next year is not welcome (?Immersion fee from 2006, cages in place?, October 12). Will the minority communities ever be charged for performing their religious rites by blocking important thoroughfares at peak hours? Then why should the majority community be made to suffer? 

Chandan Ray,

Sakuntala Park.

Apropos Hard Talk on October 3, in response to a question on the increase in street-dog population, the CPM councillor of Ward 7 has cast aspersions on the role played by the NGOs in sterilising the canines. The responsibility of dealing with street dogs lies with the civic body. Unfortunately, it has not provided any support to the NGOs in this regard. One or two NGOs sometimes get central funds to sterilise street dogs; the rest are working on their own. Besides, no census of the street dogs has been done to date, so it cannot be said that their numbers are increasing. Also, the civic body certainly does not have a system of providing collars to the neutered dogs. 

Tusar Sarkar,

Love N Care for Animals. 

With so many talented engineers in the state, it is sad that the angel atop Victoria Memorial has not been revolving since 1990 (?Angel of Victory is damaging dome?, September 13). 

B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum Park.

 Army clips Maidan aeromodel wings

 The army has banned the flying of model aircraft and gliders on the Maidan as they can injure people who visit the sprawling green. 

 The ban has upset hobbyists, who are finding it difficult to get a similar open space for practising simulated flights.

 ?This is a relatively new hobby among schoolchildren and teenagers in the city, though some of us have been practising on the Maidan for the past two decades. The army ban is a disaster, as it has come at a time the craze for flying radio-controlled aircraft is spreading fast,? rued Ashoke Mitra, secretary of a forum for ?model aeronautical? hobbyists. 

 ?As the cost of flying model aircraft is coming down, more and more children are taking to the game. It is an exposition of their ingenuity and mental stability,? he added

 The forum refused to buy the army?s argument that visitors to the Maidan stand the risk of getting hurt by model aircraft or gliders.

 ?This is absolutely rubbish. Our models are very light and fly at a speed that will not injure anyone even if he collides with one. In fact, a model plane travels at one-third the speed of a cricket ball and at a height of more than 10 feet,? said a forum representative.

 The impact of the ban is starting to show. When the forum?s annual show, held on December 4, was shifted to Behala Flying Club, the turnout was far from impressive.

 ?Only 176 participants took part in the show. Many of our members had said they could not make it to the venue, as it was too far from the city centre,? said Tapan Sengupta, forum technical superviser. 

 ?We are really worried about how this creative game, which requires open space, will survive,? said Arya Ghosh, a flying enthusiast. 

 At present, members of the club are allowed to fly aircraft on the race course, but several restrictions have been imposed on them. 

 Debyashu Kalyani, 8, a member of the forum, wondered:?We are not destroying the environment in any way, so why has the army debarred us from entering the Maidan?? 

 He added: ?This sport is much safer than cricket, which is played with a hard ball. We want the army to reconsider its decision.?

 An army officer said the ban had been imposed after a glider crashed during a practice session of NCC cadets early this year. ?To practise such flights, you need to have some basic security arrangements that are lacking on the Maidan,? said R.K. Das, spokesperson for the army.

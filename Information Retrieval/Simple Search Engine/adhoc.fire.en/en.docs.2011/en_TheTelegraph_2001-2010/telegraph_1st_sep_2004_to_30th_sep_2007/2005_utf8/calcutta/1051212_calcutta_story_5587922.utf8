The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Market shift to ease road clog

 Sandip Banerjee: The roads in the Fal Mandi area are congested, dirty and almost inaccessible due to continuous loading and unloading of fruits from the trucks. What are you doing to ease the congestion?

 Perhaps you know that Mechhua fruit market is the largest in east Asia. With the volume of business growing, there is a space crunch in the market. The traders lack civic sense and hence, build staircases to their store rooms right from the pavements.

 Merchants of date are the most troublesome. They use the pavements and parts of the carriageway as their warehouse. I had held a meeting with about 200 traders from the area. They had agreed to take care of the area, but their promise has turned out to be false.

 The congestion problem will not be solved until the market is shifted elsewhere.

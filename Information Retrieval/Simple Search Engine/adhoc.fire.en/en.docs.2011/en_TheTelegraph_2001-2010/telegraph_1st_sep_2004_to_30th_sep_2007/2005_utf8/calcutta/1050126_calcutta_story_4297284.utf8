The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 During a visit to the Alipore Zoological Gardens in the 

 last week of December I noticed that many visitors were 

 not buying entry tickets for children in their early teens. 

 The rule, however, as displayed on the boards put up at 

 the entrance, says that all children require a Rs-10 ticket 

 for entry. Interestingly, it was not just visitors who were 

 keen to dodge the rule. Even the zoo staffers at the gate 

 were allowing children in without tickets. The display boards 

 should be more prominent and the ticket-checkers should 

 implement the rule strictly. This will earn the zoo more 

 revenue which can be used for its maintenance.

 The recently-introduced Digha-bound trains start from Shalimar 

 in Howrah. But that is of no use to the multitude of tourists 

 from outside the state who use Calcutta as the transit point 

 to Digha. They have no option but to board the long-distance 

 buses from different parts of the city. It would be much 

 more convenient, both for Calcuttans and for visitors to 

 the city, if the trains start from Howrah station instead. 

 The railway authorities must seriously consider this suggestion.

 On January 1, I went to Victoria Memorial with friends. 

 We were shocked to find visitors being allowed to enter 

 the premises with plastic bags. It was only weeks ago that 

 the Memorial compound was declared a polythene-free zone. 

 The guards seemed unaware of or not interested in implementing 

 the ban. Also, we found that many benches were in need of 

 repair.

 A house in BE block of Salt Lake, adjacent to the Kwality 

 bus stop, is often let out for various social functions. 

 However, on such days, the invitees park their cars, two-wheelers 

 and even private buses right in front of the building, on 

 the main road. Those waiting for buses are forced to stand 

 in the middle of the road as vehicles are parked, blocking 

 the passenger shed. I have personally complained to the 

 house-owner about the inconvenience but to no avail. Will 

 the Bidhannagar Municipality take appropriate steps to save 

 us the harassment?

 Several para dadas are forcefully collecting money 

 in the name of the tsunami relief fund. Some are even rebuking 

 those who are not willing to donate. It is likely that the 

 money collected will be misappropriated. Police should check 

 the credentials of these people.

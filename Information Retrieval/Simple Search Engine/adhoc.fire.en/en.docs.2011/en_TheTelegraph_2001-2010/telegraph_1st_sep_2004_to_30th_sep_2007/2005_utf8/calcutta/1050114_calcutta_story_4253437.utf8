 Bringing out the best in us and them

 Nandikar?s National Theatre Festival is a crossroad to view both Nandikar and theatre in this city. The 21st festival signals their adulthood as festival organisers and commemorates 50 years of Shambhu Mitra?s production of Tagore?s Raktakarabi ? a milestone in the Bengali group theatre movement. 

 There seems to be quite a crop of theatre festivals in the city now, but Nandikar?s is the oldest and certainly the first serious effort to regularly showcase theatre from the rest of the subcontinent. Thanks to Nandikar, Calcutta has seen plays from Pakistan to Manipur and acknowledgement for their achievement is more than due. Certainly, it also needs to be translated into further funds from those truly concerned about the city?s culture. There can be no doubt that Nandikar needs support, and more of it.

 This year the Nandikar festival had a special slant, with the emphasis on children?s theatre. We have a tradition of plays by children, which has even led to the CLT auditorium under the Dhakuria bridge. Off hand, I cannot think of any other Indian city which has an auditorium dedicated to children. Nandikar?s emphasis comforted us with the reminder that the tradition has neither disappeared nor deteriorated in our city and has, in fact, taken on new dimensions.

No child?s play

 The quality of contribution made by young creative people like Debshankar Haldar in Joraay Joraay and Swapna Muhurte or Olot Palot certainly assures us of a bright future for children?s theatre. The fact that one of these productions came from Samatat of Uttarpara is an indication that good work is also coming in from the fringes. One must congratulate Debshankar for being able to make children participate in the theatre games he devised and let their creativity run riot. Incidentally, one of the plays is about riot.

 Hopefully he and others like him will be inspired to create the right avenues for children to contribute to the thematic content of these plays, because they do sometimes smack of devices that can be born only in an adult mind. Children have their own sense of narrative and narrative structure, for which theatre creates a tremendous opportunity.

 The preponderance of adult themes and structures in children?s plays takes away the theatrical sleight of hand even in the work of directors like Ramaprasad Banik, whose Ekla Pagol was seen at the festival. It is a problem that burdens Swatilekha Sengupta and Goutam Haldar?s productions, Aandharmoni and Dulia. Their theatrical competence cannot be questioned, but perhaps a shade of greater childlikeness in the content would leave everyone more satisfied. 

 I was, however, quite pleasantly surprised by Goutam Haldar?s Barda ? an exceptional and delightful one-man show for children. It dealt with a rather complex and difficult subject, with that lightness of touch I missed in some of the other productions. But then it had the advantage of a story written by Munshi Premchand. That is what classics are all about. 

 The other striking one-man show came to us all the way from Sweden. Teater Pero brought its absolutely enthralling ?rjan, a magical tale of breaking barriers and overcoming obstacles. The simplicity of its idea, the strength of its content, and sparseness that allowed the imagination to participate, made this a memorable experience. Fortunately, it came in English and parables usually do not suffer in translation. I cannot pinpoint where exactly the production struck gold. Was it in Magnus Lundblad?s performance or in Ulf Erikson?s music? Both have left lasting impressions on me.

 The only other children?s play came from Jammu. With the rather intriguing title of Aap Hamare Hain Kaun?, it was directed by Balwant Thakur and produced by Natrang in Hindi. Again, burdened by themes of exceptional weight, it strove to deal with consumerism, parental ambition and education systems. A children?s play from the fringes of a major conflict zone will certainly have its own share of seriousness, but it can only be successful if the performers are up to it. The play proved once again that the creativity of children never fails.

Old forms, modern garb

 The Nandikar festival?s second emphasis on the application of traditional mimetic languages, including classical and folk dance forms in today?s theatre, brought quite a variety of performing skills from different parts of India. There was Mumbai University?s re-working of the Hirimba-Ghatotkach-Bheem story from the Mahabharata in Madhyam Vyayog, which used a variety of dance and live musical forms. Its director Waman Kendre certainly left you with serious thoughts about the language of theatre. 

 From the other end arrived a Sanskrit/Brajabali play from Guwahati. The Purbaranga production Sri Ram Vijoy used traditional musical and dance forms from the Shankardeva heritage to tell the story of Viswamitra from the Ramayana. Obviously, these are the forms that emerged in the religious schools in Assam during the spread of Vaishnavism. 

 I cannot question the authenticity of the heritage that was presented, but doubts about its efficacy as a contemporary theatre idiom continued to crop up in my mind. The use of a traditional idiom becomes meaningful only when it provides the artistic means to render a contemporary experience in a form consecrated by time and tradition. 

 The sheer continuation of a tradition may have its archival or historical value but its relevance as a performing art is always open to question, unless this contemporarisation process takes place. We were not witness to such a process either during this play or the production from Pondicherry called Ganapati, an attempt to marry Koddiyattam to modern theatre. 

 It had a very impressive musical arrangement and choreography, but without contemporary relevance. There was tremendous skill, but one was left with the overriding question ? what is all this for?

 This process of contemporarisation was certainly pre-eminent in the work of H. Kanhailal from Imphal?s Kalakshetra, whose rendering of Mahasweta Devi?s Draupadi was very much about the here and now, even though the form takes its roots from traditional Manipuri performing arts. Here was a great tradition reworking an ancient myth through a modern narrative with an urgent contemporary context. 

 In terms of the human violations in Manipur today, and the political context of rape by an occupying army, Kanhailal confronts us with our own conscience. This is not tradition for the sake of it, but its redeployment as a powerful instrument with which to indict a severe social and political wrong. It takes theatre, in terms of both form and content, into a totally new dimension. 

 The accompanying film by Lokendra Arambam, Soldier in Sarong, was an equally unsettling experience, but the presence of motion picture in the ambience of live performance left me with a mixed reaction. Perhaps theatre and film are, eventually, like oil and water.

 The festival?s tribute to Habib Tanvir, who needs little introduction to Calcutta, comes at a vital juncture of his long theatre career. Tanvir?s blend of European theatre inspired by Brecht?s Berliner Ensemble with the Chhattisgarhi tradition of folk performers and acrobats have given us some great theatrical expressions. This time, his evergreen Charandas Chor came with his new work Zahreeli Hawa on the Bhopal gas tragedy.

 The Nandikar festival also showed some of Calcutta?s own productions, like Arun Mukhopadhyay?s Nirnoy and Meghnad Bhattacharya?s Sanjhbela, which reminded us that theatre is still very much alive in the city. 

 Calcutta may not always produce the best theatre in the country, but even at the risk of being parochial I insist that we are still the best audience.

 She?s staging a comeback after over a decade. And Rila O?Brien is overwhelmed with the way the musical fraternity is welcoming her ?with open arms?.

 ?I got married in 1991 and gave up singing soon after,? says Rila. It wasn?t a ban imposed by in-laws or anything else, but suddenly ?life?s priorities had changed?. What topped the list was family, a company that she was helping to set up with husband Derek, and soon after, the birth of daughter Aanya.

 Now that the company has ?kind of settled into a groove? and Aanya is a little grown up, Rila feels it?s time to hit the stage again. ?I simply love to perform,? she smiles. Testing the waters, she performed with Shiva at the finale of Sananda Tilottama last month and those who heard her were pleasantly surprised. ?It was as if she had never gone away,? was how someone described Rila?s performance that evening.

 Those who were part of the college and club scene in the 80s might remember the teenager sweeping competitions in fests and performing at various dos. ?At the university, she used to win everything,? says musician Nondon Bagchi. ?I judged her several times in contests at Jadavpur University and it was difficult not to award her anything but the first position.?

 Rila started singing in school (Loreto House) and joined a band called Crosswinds. ?Not to be confused with the band that plays these days; Crosswinds was fronted by Abhijit Patronobis.? The original line-up of Shiva, too, featured her occasionally. But was she that good even while in school? ?Yes, and also the fact there were no female singers in the circuit then,? Rila laughs.

 Then came her stint with Pop Secret, a band that included Jayshree and Gyan Singh (who later formed Skinny Alley) and Nondon Bagchi. Pop Secret carried on for around four years till Rila got married and tuned off music. ?I even stopped listening to music for some years.?

 Fellow musicians like Nondon are thrilled with Rila?s decision to return. ?She?s definitely among the best and if she?s making a comeback, you can be rest assured that she?ll do it with the same professionalism as before,? the Hip Pocket drummer offers.

 Sunday will see Rila perform at Look Back In Wonder, a tribute to the women of folk-country-blue-rock music, along with Anjum Katyal, at Tollygunge Club. For the past three weeks, rehearsals have been on in full swing with a new band called Cold Fire that features some of the Shiva members.

 The emphasis will be on original music rather than covers. ?You get kind of tired singing the same songs for 10 years. We are planning to start with 30 per cent original compositions and take it to 50 per cent eventually.? Her songbook would include ?lots of Joan Baez? (her chief musical influence), Rita Coolidge, Lee Ann Womack, Shawn Colvin, Cher and Gloria Estefan. Sunday?s performance will also see Rila debut her original composition February.

 It?s music, music and more music then on. Chennai in the first week of July, Dubai later in July and August, and a tour of Australia covering Sydney, Melbourne and Perth in October? ?Let?s see what happens,? says Rila, in true Que Sera Sera style.

 The last time she was in Calcutta, 

 Juhi Babbar triggered more interest because of her 

 star lineage than her film Kaash Aap Hamare Hote, which 

 she had come to promote. But the city?s theatre-goers will 

 remember her as the slip of a girl who tried to match her 

 mother Nadira Babbar?s paces in Begum Jaan some summers 

 ago.

 This time, she?s here for Odeon 2005 as a star in her own right, having established herself in her mother?s vocation. And now, Juhi is focussed on charting a new course in film actor father Raj Babbar?s footsteps.

 ?The period after Kaash Aap Hamare Hote was very depressing. I was getting offers but I couldn?t relate myself to those roles. If they wanted someone to wear the best make-up, good costumes, and just sing and dance, then why me? If they needed an actor, I was willing. It was difficult to say no to money and big banners then, but I stuck to my decision,? says Juhi, who graduated from NIFT but ended up applying her skills to designing costumes for Ekjute, the theatre group led by Nadira. The backstage stint followed small roles and crowd entries, and finally Begum Jaan.

 Presently, Juhi has three films to juggle with her stage assignments. Uns, co-starring Rituparna Sengupta, Sanjay Kapoor and Aman Verma, is a film about ?relationships?, where she plays a lawyer.

 The second one is a Punjabi film, co-starring Jimmy Shergill. ?Unlike the Bengali industry which produces very good films, Punjabi cinema is stuck somewhere. But now it?s changing, with new looks and content. My father, a Punjabi, has done quite a lot of films there. Now, it?s my turn.?

 This apart, she will be seen in an eight-minute short, Reflections, alongside southern star Mohanlal. But the most ambitious of the lot is Antara, tracking a kathak dancer?s journey, based on verse and stripped of dialogue. Juhi plays the lead, opposite Sushant Singh, and also gets to swirl to Pandit Birju Maharaj?s choreography.

 The movie line-up has certainly made her diary more crowded, but Juhi is all for a combination of stage and screen. And between the two, she prioritises ?good work?.

 ?Theatre is my commitment. Films are the way I want to expand. I want to balance both and I will definitely continue to do theatre,? asserts the attractive young woman before taking the stage for Ji Jaisi Aapki Marzi at GD Birla Sabhagar on Saturday.

 Myriad moods of Tagore

 As a fitting prelude to the celebrations ushering in the Bengali New Year, Academy Theatre hosts a music programme that endeavours to preserve and rekindle interest in the glorious heritage of Bengal?s literary and performing arenas. Tagore?s invaluable contribution to the evolution of the Bengali romantic psyche is affirmed in Rupey Rupantarey Rabindranath, featuring Tagore?s kavyagaan (verses that were later set to tune as songs). Recited by Manjula Roy and Barin Roy, and sung by Manisha Murali Nair and Manoj Murali Nair, it celebrates a lyrical, idyllic way of life. The second half of the concert features Rabindranather Manchagaan, a selection of Tagore songs, which he had composed for the stage. Performed by Riddhi Bandyopadhyay, Devajit Bandyopadhyay and Kumar Roy, the songs harmoniously bridge the divide between the performing arts and the popular culture of Bengal, as they have manifested themselves through succeeding generations.

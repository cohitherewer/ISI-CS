 Diet shift key to dengue spread

 - Lack of Awareness, lifestyle make calcuttans prone to diseases

 If the Aedes aegypti brought dengue to the city, pizzas and potato chips helped it to spread. Research by the University of Connecticut and Jadavpur University (JU) has revealed that changes in food habit and lifestyle are the two main factors responsible for dengue patients in Calcutta turning critical and, in many cases, dying.

 The shift in food habit from indigenous to Western is reducing nutrients in the host cells of the bodies of the city residents, making them vulnerable to virus and bacteria, the probe has found. Nutritionally deficient host cells allow virus and bacteria to replicate.

 The researchers also studied how the dengue virus has evolved over the past 30 years with change in food habit and increased pollution.

 ?Dependence on fast food and processed food is affecting the body?s immune system. The host cells derive nutrients from freshly-cooked food and vegetables,? said Utpal Raychaudhuri, former head of the food technology and bio-chemical engineering department of JU and a part of the research team.

 Case studies of dengue patients have shown that prolonged illness can be prevented if the body has proper supply of nutrients. ?The findings are applicable to other bacterial or viral diseases like malaria, hepatitis, measles and AIDS,? Raychaudhuri stated.

 Seasonal fruits, fresh vegetables, fruits mixed with milk, honey, turmeric and yoghurt should be a part of the daily diet to retain nutrients in the host cells of human bodies, the researcher opined. 

 ?Our cells are getting weaker, but the virus and bacteria cells are becoming powerful by deriving nutrient from pollutants in the environment,? he added. 

 Another study conducted by the department in Calcutta has revealed that the awareness level among schoolchildren and their parents about the ill-effects of junk food is extremely low. Almost 70 per cent of the city schoolstudents regularly consume fast food. 

 Stress also plays a major role in the spread of viral and bacterial diseases. ?Depletion of nutrients due to stress-induced oxidisation of important lipids destroys tissues,? explained Raychaudhuri. 

 Doctors, too, feel that the immune system of the body is taking a beating due to dependence on fast food.

 ?Fresh fruits and vegetables are a must. Junk food with preservatives should be avoided,? averred Apurba Ghosh, director of Institute of Child Health. According to him, the main cause of rising incidence of anaemia in the city was the food habit shift.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Plex on star trek, south to north 

 - Five-screen, 1,200-seater third address in Jessore Road mall in 2007

 SUBHRO SAHA

 First stop: Elgin Road. Second stop: Salt Lake. Third stop: Jessore Road? INOX is going places, but from south to north!

 When INOX launched Calcutta?s first multiplex theatre in Calcutta on September 27, 2003, at Forum, it changed the way the city goes to the cinemas.

 The movie magic was then carried forward to City Centre and now, INOX is gearing up to unveil its third ? and biggest ? property in town, on Jessore Road, in 2007.

 ?Yes, we have signed with the Diamond Group for a five-screen multiplex in the 200,000-sq-ft mall coming up on Jessore Road,? Manoj Bhatia, chief executive officer, INOX Leisure Ltd, told Metro on Friday.

 The mall set to house the third INOX will be attached to the 1,100-apartment Diamond City North residential complex near Nagerbazar, under the South Dum Dum Municipality.

 Seating around 1,200 cinegoers across its five screens, the Dum Dum multiplex will also be aimed ?more at the family crowd, like the City Centre INOX, because this is also a dense residential zone?, Bhatia added.

 Ticket prices at City Centre for non-peak hours are ?10 to 15 per cent lower? than Forum, and the plan is to keep prices ?reasonable? at the Jessore Road address as well.

 Refuel, the self-managed food counter with theme menus at Forum and City Centre, offering a range of popcorns, combo meals, chaats, finger food and soft drinks, will be replicated at INOX III.

 ?We will continue to focus on the fundamentals, which has been our core strength as a corporate group. Jessore Road may not be five-star deluxe, but it?ll surely be five-star,? observed the CEO.

 While Ashley Allen of Walker Architects of New Zealand designed INOX Forum, the management is yet to identify the designers for the Dum Dum property.

 ?We will have to wait for the overall mall design to be frozen before we can finalise our own design, so that it blends seamlessly,? said an INOX spokesperson.

 Pantaloons will be the anchor store at the Diamond City North mall, set to be ready by 2007-end. It will have twin-basement parking space for 250 cars, several F amp;B outlets, an entertainment zone and a dedicated food court.

 ?We are creating a product which won?t be intimidating to the predominantly middle-class and even lower middle-class populace of the area, addressing their aspiration and needs,? said A.N. Shroff, head of the consortium (Diamond Group) developing the Jessore Road project. The commercial complex is expected to generate direct employment for ?about 500 to 700 people?.

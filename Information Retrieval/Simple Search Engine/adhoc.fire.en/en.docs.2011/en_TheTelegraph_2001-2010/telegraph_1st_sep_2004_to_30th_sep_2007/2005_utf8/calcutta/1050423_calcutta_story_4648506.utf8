 Hoax hostage back home 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Abhradeep Banerjee, 17, a student of Class XI in Bidhannagar Government High School and a resident of Baguiati, did not return home on Thursday. 

 When his musician father Krishnendu received a frantic call from him later in the evening, he almost passed out. Abhradeep claimed he had escaped from the clutches of his ?kidnappers? and was speaking from Digha.

 Less than 10 hours later, Abhradeep was back home safe and sound, thanks to his police escort, and it turned out that he had not been abducted after all.

 ?The boy was not kidnapped, he had simply run away from home. We brought him back from Digha early this morning, and he was reunited with his parents by about 9 am,? said Kanad Mukherjee, sub-divisional police officer of Salt Lake.

 ?My son was very depressed over the past few days and had gone off to Digha all by himself. He had not informed his mother or me about the sudden trip,? Krishnendu said on Friday. ?When we received a call at around 7.30 pm on Thursday, we could hardly recognise our son?s voice. He was crying and his voice was shaky. He said he had been kidnapped and had somehow managed to give his captors the slip, the father added.

 ?The police had taken very good care of Abhradeep. He was not carrying much money when he left home yesterday, and they had fed him and made sure that he was comfortable,? Krishnendu said.

 While Krishnendu desperately contacted Bidhannagar (North) police station, seeking help to retrieve his son on Thursday evening, Digha police received a call from a public telephone booth operator, claiming that she had detained a teenaged boy whose behaviour had raised her suspicion. A police team was sent to the booth, located in Old Digha, to investigate the matter. It returned to the police station with Abhradeep, and the boy was grilled thoroughly till late at night.

 According to police, Abhradeep had landed in Digha around 3 pm on Thursday. He had apparently approached the owner of a small hotel, seeking employment and accommodation, claiming that his parents had passed away and that he had to find some livelihood. The inn-keeper, however, turned the boy away.

 Till late in the evening, Abhradeep had not found a place to stay. In panic, he cooked up the abduction story and called up his father.

 During interrogation, he claimed that four unknown men had picked him up near his school in a blue Maruti, and there were two other boys like him. The imaginary car had stopped near Contai, just before the Digha Bypass, the captors had disembarked at a roadside eatery, and that was when he managed to escape. He then took a passing bus to Digha.

 The police did not buy the story. If three boys had been abducted from Salt Lake on the same day, the district police would have been alerted, they reasoned. Working on the loopholes in Abhradeep?s story, they soon made him accept that he had gone to Digha on his own.

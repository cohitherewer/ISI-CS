The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 IT firm 

in top billing 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 City-based software product company Connectiva Systems has won Billing Awards 2005 for its revenue assurance solutions to telecom service providers. 

 The award, founded by Institute of International Research and Global Billing Association, is the ?first of its kind? for an Indian information technology (IT) company.

 ?We are very happy with this recognition and we think it will give us great branding,? said Avi Basu, chief operating officer, Connectiva. It specialises in delivering enterprise revenue assurance, telecom application, business process integration and convergent network solutions to wireless telecom service providers.

 Besides brand image, the company?s business is also growing. Recently Connectiva has struck a deal with Mobile Telecommunications Company (MTC), one of the leading telecom service providers in west Asia, for its global revenue maximisation effort. 

 ?MTC Group has ambitious expansion plans. Since the deal is at the group level, it will give us a chance to play a leading role for the company in various parts of the globe,? added Basu. To make its presence felt in Europe, the company has recently set up a marketing office in London. 

 Focusing on the domestic market, Connectiva, headquartered in New Jersey, USA, is also in talks with some telecom players in India and is expecting to seal a deal shortly. 

 ?We are clearly on a growth path and we expect to more than double our revenues in the next fiscal. We are looking at north of $10 million and it is very much achievable,? he observed. 

 To sustain the growth, Connectiva is planning to increase headcount from its present strength of 65 to 130 by the end of the fiscal. But Basu added the focus would be on quality recruitment. 

 ?Ours is a product company and we need a different type of skillset. We are looking at people in the US interested in coming back to Calcutta,? signed off Basu.

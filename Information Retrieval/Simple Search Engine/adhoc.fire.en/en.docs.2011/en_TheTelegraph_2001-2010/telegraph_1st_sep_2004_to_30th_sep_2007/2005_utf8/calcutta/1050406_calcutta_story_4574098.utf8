The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 With plans of converting the single-storeyed Lake Market into a six-storeyed 

Lake Mall, there is bound to be a noticeable increase in traffic in and around 

the area. I am a regular to the market and often find parking my car a very time-consuming 

affair. In the process of finding a parking space, cars obstruct the smooth flow 

of traffic on the road. Add to that, the worry of the car being stolen or carted 

away by the police if it has to be left in a no-parking zone. It would really 

be helpful if the mayor also sanctions a car park at the basement of the new structure 

or in front of it. This will ease the traffic snarl in the lanes adjacent to the 

market.

 The areas adjoining Thakurpukur (30 minutes from Taratola) face the risk of 

developing in an unplanned manner. Vast tracts of land there have been lying vacant 

for more than a decade now despite the area being as close to Calcutta proper 

as is Rajarhat. Unfortunately, our government realises the requirement of the 

increasing populace in the suburbs only when an area gets congested. 

 Sourav Das, Behala Manton. 

 I was travelling in a state bus from the Esplanade depot. The bus slowed down 

near the Chittaranjan Avenue-Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing when we heard a loud 

thud, as if something hit the window behind the emergency door. The tin was already 

damaged at the place. Within minutes we saw the broken window, which gave way, 

being pulled out and vanish. A street urchin was seen running away with it. All 

passengers shouted out but neither the traffic constable on duty nor passers-by 

bothered to chase him. It was high noon in the central business district. I shudder 

to think what would happen if a gang of dacoits decided to rob us there and then 

instead.

 The repaired roads and working streetlights on the stretch from Shyambazar 

to Dunlop are a relief. But the tram tracks from Shyambazar crossing to the rail 

bridge need immediate repair. I also fail to understand why the authorities are 

content with just superficial patchwork underneath the Dunlop rail bridge. 

 S.B. Datta, Salt Lake. 

 The footpath in front of FMC Fortuna building on AJC Bose Road is very narrow. 

At one spot it is blocked by a tree and a lamppost and the railing takes up some 

space. Are we expected to walk through it all?

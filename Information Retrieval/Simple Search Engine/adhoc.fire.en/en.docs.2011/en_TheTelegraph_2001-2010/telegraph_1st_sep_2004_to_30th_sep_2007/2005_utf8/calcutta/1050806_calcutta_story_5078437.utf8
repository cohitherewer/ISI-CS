 Squabble agenda in cable trade 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 No matter how many attempts at regulation are made by the government and private bodies, this is one industry that continues to remain opaque and consumer-unfriendly.

 And in the cable trade, if bad reception and unavailability of favourite channels continue to plague viewers, petty business squabbles are the bane of service providers looking to come out of the rut.

 The past few days saw a spree of cable-cutting in various parts of the city. ?Our main feeder cable was cut at various points like Shakespeare Sarani, Creek Row and southern parts of Calcutta,? said an official of one of the largest multi-system operators (MSO). 

 ?Though we were able to repair the damage immediately and viewers were hardly affected, such acts cause financial setbacks and harm the trade in a big way,? he added.

 If cable-cutting is affecting existing MSOs, opposition from them is spoiling the chance of bringing about a change for an upcoming one.

 ?Some of the MSOs are threatening broadcasters not to give us decoder boxes,? said Mrinal Chatterjee of Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services, a new MSO, with around 70 operators planning to launch services in the Dum Dum-Baguiati area by August 15.

 ?The existing MSOs place channels according to the amount of carriage fees paid by them. As a result, viewers do not get to see the popular channels as determined by Television Ratings Points (TRP). We declared that we would break this practice and that seems to have started the campaign against us,? alleged Chatterjee.

 A spokesperson for a breakaway group of operators setting up their own infrastructure in the Behala area echoed Chatterjee. 

 ?Some of our operators fear repercussions from existing MSOs. This is delaying our project,? he said.

 Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services feels that customers should be given the importance they deserve and not taken for granted. ?Thanks to poor cable service, we are already witnessing a migration to direct-to-home. As competition hots up in DTH, cable service providers have to improve their quality to retain viewers,? Chatterjee offered.

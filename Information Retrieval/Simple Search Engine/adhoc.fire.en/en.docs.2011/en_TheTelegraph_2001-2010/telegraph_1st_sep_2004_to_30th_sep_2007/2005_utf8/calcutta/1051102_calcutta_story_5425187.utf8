 Art of nature

 Abstraction in art is conventionally perceived as a means of veiling the artists ideas, giving the viewer an opportunity to uncover the mystery shrouding it. Landscapes, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Susmita Ghosh, presents semi-abstract works with a surprisingly lucid quality. Appearing obscure at first glance, they reveal blurred images of mountains, streams, waterfalls, trees and houses on closer observation. Done in oil and acrylic on canvas, the paintings view nature in all its aspects. The use of bold and stark colours emphasizes the vastness of the landscapes, which Ghosh has tried to execute within a small frame. More idealistic than surrealistic, her paintings offer a vision of the universe where man and nature are in absolute harmony.

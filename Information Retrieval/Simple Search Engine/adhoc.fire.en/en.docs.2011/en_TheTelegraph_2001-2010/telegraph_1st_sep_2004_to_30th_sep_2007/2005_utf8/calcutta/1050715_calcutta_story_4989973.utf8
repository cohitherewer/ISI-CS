 Police hand scripts satta success story

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Several pockets in south Calcutta have been witnessing a flourishing business in satta and gambling for a long time. 

 Protests by residents are ignored as the operators are in collusion with the police. A probe by the vigilance department, too, has come to nought.

 In Behala, the satta rackets operate mainly from near Chowrasta, Taratala crossing, Rai Bahadur Road (close to the government bus terminus), Buroshibtola, Sahapur, Jyotish Roy Road and Tarpanghat Road. The principal bookies are Shyamal Roy, Kishore Saha and Manu Singh.

 According to a resident of the neighbourhood, the daily collection from satta is more than Rs 2 lakh. ?Part of it goes to the local police station, where the money is collected by a constable,? he alleged.

 Local Trinamul Congress leader Sakti Mondal said his party members had complained to police several times, but no action had been taken.

 In Sonarpur and Subhasgram, the rackets are active near the Kamrabad railway crossing, Rajpur market and the vicinity of the state electricity board office and the employment exchange. Here, the bookies are Sanatan, Sukha, Gour and Sanju. 

 Following a complaint by a group of local residents, a team from Sonarpur police station had claimed to have tried to arrest Sukha. ?But he slipped through our cordon. We even fired at him, but he escaped under the cover of darkness,? an officer said.

 In Subhasgram, a local club had recently destroyed a number of satta and liquor dens. The business had stopped for a while, but the dens have been resurrected. 

 Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality chairman Kamal Ganguly, however, claimed that drives against satta and illicit liquor business were carried out regularly. ?We have also asked police to back local groups fighting the rackets,? he added.

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said: ?I have asked my officers to launch raids frequently? If any policeman is found to have links with the rackets, departmental action will be taken against him.?

 Fee-hike setback for private colleges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A recent government decision has dashed the hopes of private engineering colleges, or at least a section of them, to raise tuition and other fees from the next academic session.

 A self-financed engineering college will be allowed to hike its fees only if it meets certain criteria set by the government ? infrastructure being one of them.

 A panel set up on a Supreme Court order to review the fee structure of the private colleges has been asked to judge the 55-odd institutions ? most of them in and around Calcutta ? by the criteria and categorise them under A, B and C.

 The government will fix the fee for each category and the colleges have to abide by it.

 At present, there is a uniform fee structure for all self-financed engineering institutions ? Rs 32,000 a year. Colleges, irrespective of the facilities they offer, charge this amount from students. And they were eyeing more from 2006.

 According to the new plan, the colleges will be graded and categorised on the basis of the performance of their students, placement opportunities and infrastructure. The institutions making the highest grade in all the sections will be placed under A. 

 ?The committee working on the fee structure was set up early this year following a Supreme Court order. After the government decided on grading private engineering colleges, the panel?s writ was extended. It?s now in the process of assessing each and every college. The institutions, too, have started sending the relevant data to the panel,? said a higher education department official, who oversees the functioning of self-financed colleges.

 The committee is expected to submit its report in January. ?We will prepare our guidelines after getting the report and the colleges will be asked to revise their fees on the basis of those guidelines,? said Manotosh Biswas, a senior official of the education department.

 The panel was scheduled to submit its report this month. 

 But the deadline had to be pushed back following the inclusion in its terms of reference the task of grading the colleges.

 The panel was initially asked to suggest only a revised fee structure for the private institutions. 

 The Supreme Court had said the fees needed to be reviewed by the state governments at a regular interval to find out whether any revision was needed.

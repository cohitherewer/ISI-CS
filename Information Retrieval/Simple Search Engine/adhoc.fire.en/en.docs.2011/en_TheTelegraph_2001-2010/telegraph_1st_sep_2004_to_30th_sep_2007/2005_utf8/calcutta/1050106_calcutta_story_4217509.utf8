 Slogans and shut-out in lipstick ban

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The next episode of ?no lipstick please, you?re teachers?, played out another dramatic day at the Bonhooghly Girls? High School, with three of the ?rebel? teachers not being allowed to attend class, one not turning up and protests taking on a political hue.

 At the centre of the Baranagar school storm is the circular barring women teachers from wearing lipstick, kajal, trendy ornaments or eye-catching clothes from January 1.

 Among the defiant quartet of teachers, Sanchita Adhikary did not attend school on Wednesday. Madhumita Khan, Shampa Saha and Asima Adhikary turned up, but with a point to prove.

 ?Three of the teachers had come to school wearing lipstick, and were not allowed to take any classes,? said headmistress Tapati Dutta.

 ?There is no question of buckling under pressure, as we are not wrong,? retorted Shampa Saha.

 Piling on the pressure, but on the headmistress, was a vociferous delegation from the Trinamul Congress.

 Four leaders from the party?s women?s wing, along with slogan-shouting supporters, stormed the school campus in the morning, demanding to meet headmistress Dutta.

 ?We won?t allow this Talibani fatwa,? screamed the protesters. This prompted several teachers to abandon classes and request the Trinamul brigade not to create such a ruckus in the school.

 ?Even when the four leaders came in to see me, their followers continued shouting slogans outside my office, despite repeated appeals from several teachers,? Dutta later said.

 ?The leaders had come to demand that I immediately withdraw the notice ordering all our teachers to conform to a uniform dress code and instructing them not to wear any make-up, or flashy clothes and ornaments to class,? the headmistress added.

 According to police, classes at Bonhooghly Girls? High School were disrupted by the Trinamul protest till about 12.30 pm.

 Soon after the agitators had met the headmistress, a group of about two dozen local youths gathered outside the school gate and confronted the Trinamul protesters, who later alleged being roughed up by CPM-backed youths.

 ?Contrary to the claims of the complainants, I found no one seriously injured,? said B. Halder, officer-in-charge of Baranagar police station.

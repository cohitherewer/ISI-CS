Life

 Friday fun every day

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Boardroom brainstorming, an evening show at the multiplex, a mad dash to the nearest nightclub?

 This packed schedule ? the kind just about any yuppies planner proudly proclaims ? leaves no time to breathe, let alone to head home for a quick shower and a change of clothes.

 Keeping time with the work-hard-play-harder routine, Arrow launched its Arrow Sports flagship store in the city on Friday at 5 Elgin Road.

 With Friday dressing creeping in though the week, the menswear majors sub-brand specialises in clothes that keep professionals comfortable in an office and trendy in a nightclub.

 The sprawling showroom was inaugurated by model-turned-actor Milind Soman . I am into a lot of sportswear. For me, the look and the fit of what I wear matters the most, he smiled.

 The Sports label has been around for more than five years now and has been a hit with the upwardly mobile, which marks a shift from Arrows traditional senior-professional customer base. It now contributes 30 per cent to the total revenue of the menswear brand.

 Arrow has grown immensely in the past decade. We used to be the last word in mens formals and power dressing. But with the changing times, it is also important to concentrate on the needs of youngsters who might not be comfortable in a white shirt, explained Janak Dave, business head, Arrow.

 The range includes shirts, trousers, knits and jackets, in 100 per cent cotton. Sporty and casual finishes, soft washes and indigo knits characterise the look of the line.

 The standalone location was chosen over the mall mayhem. Such a big place is not possible in a mall. Here, the entire merchandise can be displayed, resulting in proper visibility, said Ratul Sood, whose company Burlingtons has set up the city franchise.

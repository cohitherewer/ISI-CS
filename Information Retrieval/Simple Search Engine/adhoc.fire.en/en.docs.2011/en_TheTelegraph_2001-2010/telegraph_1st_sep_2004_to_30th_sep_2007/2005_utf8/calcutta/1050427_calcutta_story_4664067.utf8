 Art met fashion for a mission on Monday night. A two-part programme was hosted by The Oberoi Grand in association with Spandan Art, kicking off with a painting auction and moving on to a fashion show by Bibi Russell. 

 Paintings by a number of artists went under the hammer, led by tea auctioneer Ranabir Sen, the proceeds from which went towards Anubhav, a home coming up in the city for underprivileged children and senior citizens.

 The guest of honour was Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje who also got into the artistic act. She painted an image of two children, representing unity. ?The boy is shorter than the girl and chubby while the girl is slim, tall and pretty,? she joked.

 That art work too, completed by noted artist Avijit Dutta, was auctioned off for the cause of the Anubhav home. ?When there is a dream, no one can stop it,? smiled Raje, before an audience including Sanjiv Goenka, Madhu Neotia, Rita Bhimani and Sharbari Datta.

 A model of the home was unveiled by the chief minister. It is to be surrounded by acres of agricultural land, with a pond, garden, medical clinic and community centre within the complex near PWD Road.

 Oils, watercolours, acrylic paints and pencil sketches by Avijit Dutta, Apto Bhattacharjee, Partho Bhattacherjee and Keshav Roy were sold at between Rs 2,500 and Rs 80,000.

 As cocktails and snacks circulated, the crowd hardly noticed the delay before the second round.

 But once the Bibi Russell fashion show got under way after 9 pm, it grabbed everyone?s attention. The Bangladeshi designer wowed the crowd with innovative styles, designs and the use of several fabrics. Khadi, jamdani, kantha work and her trademark gamchha style were the main features of the couture with a cause.

 Russell first rose to stardom from Bangladesh as an international model, having worked with the likes of Georgio Armani. In 2001, UNESCO named her Artist for Peace. She employs 35,000 Bangladeshi craftsmen.

 The show, titled Magical Threads, was intended as a symbol of friendship between India and Bangladesh. ?We?re like-minded people. After all we?re all Bengalis,? she said. White, plum, blue, green, lilac and purple, with zari threads and floral motifs, were the hues of the show set to the tune of Bengali folk music.

 The initial sequences were dominated by skirts with lungi elements, coupled with khadi chappals, earthen bangles and cloth hats or turbans.

 The men too, showed off several kurtas with chadars draped as shawls, carrying jholas for a college-boy look. Later, a Bangladeshi model danced on to the ramp, breaking off the white and beige mould with a burst of red and green. 

 A series of pants, skirts, kurtas and lehngas in a variety of colours followed. Netted fabrics, crochet, ribbons, strings, fishnets and flowing fabrics were put to good use.

 The final sequences showcased traditional jamdani saris with touches of innovation, using a varied range of motifs ? flowers, birds or geometric shapes.

 The woman behind it all came out at the end with her trademark humility. ?There is beauty in poverty; there is beauty everywhere,? said Russell.

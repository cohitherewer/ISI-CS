 Meet the last men standing

 Who rsquo;s the best actor of 2005? It was down to Bachchan vs Bachchan, baap vs beta, but Calcutta rsquo;s love for its jamai did the trick again. With more than half the votes, Bade Miyan did emerge on top. Don rsquo;t miss the Best Film results tomorrow...

 1. What do you say about a man who steers the world rsquo;s largest film industry at 64? What do you write about an actor who can do a Black and a Bunty Aur Babli in the same year? How do you classify a star who becomes a Sarkar and a stranger with equal elan? Well, you crown AMITABH BACHCHAN the actor of the year with 50.2 per cent votes

 2. After scoring more flops than his Pa, ABHISHEK BACHCHAN has finally got his act together. With four hits in one year mdash; Bunty Aur Babli, Dus, Sarkar and Bluffmaster! mdash; Chhote Sarkar is not only the country rsquo;s first hip hop star but also second in our SMS poll with 28.5 per cent votes 

 3. After Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani, Asoka and Chalte Chalte, one didn rsquo;t exactly expect a Paheli from his production house. But with changed priorities, SHAH RUKH KHAN is leaving no stone unturned to make it to Kodak Theatre. Here, he rsquo;s third with 9 per cent votes

 4. For someone who has delivered a Parineeta and a Salaam Namaste in the same year, your dil does not chahta hai to see SAIF ALI KHAN in the fourth spot. But Sarat Chandra rsquo;s Shekhar has only started rising and his best is yet to come 

 5. The hitman in the list, AKSHAY KUMAR hasn rsquo;t put a foot wrong from Waqt to Garam Masala to Deewane Huye Paagal. But the Khans and the Bachchans are way too popular for our khiladi Kumar

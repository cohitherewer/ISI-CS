 Sing-along power pack

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Messages laced with songs ? that?s what CESC has to offer this festive season to make its power-guzzling customers aware of the necessity to save electricity.

 The power utility will send CDs and cassettes, containing the messages and old-but-popular Bengali and Hindi songs, to around 100,000 of its 1.4 million domestic subscribers who consume 300 units of electricity or more a month.

 CESC executive director Dilip Sen said the CDs and cassettes contain 14 songs by SD Burman, Hemanta Mukherjee, RD Burman and Lata Mangeshkar, among others.

 The songs include Mono dilona bodhu, Mone porey Rubi Ray and Amaye proshno korey nil dhrubotara.

 Along with the gifts, there will be a letter from the CESC managing director, seeking consumer cooperation in saving power. ?Electricity load is at its peak from 6 pm to 10 pm. Consumers should minimise the use of gadgets like airconditioners, water pumps, geysers and washing machines during this period,? said director Sen.

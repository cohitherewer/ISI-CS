 Bhapa Chingri, Murgir Jhol, Chicken Faridpuri? Residents of Salt Lake can now have a mouthful of Bengali food without having to hunt out grandmas recipes. Bengali speciality restaurant Bhojohari Manna has come to CF 206, Sector I, Salt Lake.

 What started off as a quaint little restaurant on Ekdalia Road is now a chain boasting five outlets all over the city.

 We use to have a home-delivery counter in Salt Lake, but we have now decided to open a full-fledged restaurant for people who want to enjoy the whole Bangali khabar ambience, says Siddhartha Bose, co-owner of the restaurant chain.

 The menu starts off with Bhetki Madhuri, Rui Machh Bhaja, Chingri Cutlet and Fried Pomfret Masala.

 The elaborate main course includes Phulkopi Shorshe, Echor Dalna, Jumbo Tel Koi, Chitol Muitha, Dab Chingri, and Kosha Murgir Mangsho. The highlight of the non-vegetarian menu, however, is the mutton spread, with delicacies like Kosha Mangshor Chap, Dhanepata Mutton Chap, Boneless Mutton Korma and Mutton Dak Bangla.

 The special non-vegetarian section includes Mocha Chingri, Bhetki Paturi, Ilish Machher Dimer Bora and Lau Chingri.

 The dishes are priced between Rs 12 and Rs 150. For the sweet tooth, there is the Rabri, Patishapta, Malpoa and Mishti Doi.

 Thai flavours

 Starstruck, the multi-cuisine restaurant at Forum, is playing host to a Thai food festival till September 1. Special spices flown down from Thailand have helped cook up the authentic Oriental dishes.

 You can start off a traditional Thai meal here with Thod Man Pla (fish cake in Thai basil sauce), Thod Man Poo (deep-fried crab cake), Poh Pia Koong (deep-fried shrimp spring rolls) and Satay Kai (chicken satay) if you are a non-vegetarian. Vegetarians can choose from Nor Mai Fa-Rang Phad Hed Hom (stir-fried asparagus with shitake mushrooms) and Thod Man Kao Phod (sweet corn cake).

 The salad section offers Plah Koong (spicy shrimp salad with lemon grass and Thai herbs) and Som Tam (green papaya salad). From the assortment of vegetarian and non-vegetarian soups, Tom Yam Koong (spicy soup with prawns and lemongrass) and Gaeng Jued Nor Mai Jeen (clear soup with Chinese bamboo shoots) are the chefs choice.

 For the main course, Anna and the King (pan-fried jumbo prawn tossed in pepper sauce), Gaeng Phed Koong (Thai red curry with prawns) and Gaeng Kiew Wan Kai (green curry with chicken) are recommended. Vegetarians can go for Gaeng Massaman Jae (curry with baby corn, snow peas, mushroom and Pakchoy) and Gaeng Penang Jae (sweet, spicy Thai curry from Penang).

 The main course is served with a choice of Pad Thai or rice noodles, the popular Bamee noodles, Pineapple Flavoured Rice and Steamed Rice with Caramalised and Crushed Coconut.

 Thai Banana in Pandan Custard, Honey Galangal Pineapple and Cocktail Grapes in Agar Custard make up the sweet endings. The desserts are all priced at Rs 75, while the rest starts at Rs 90.

 Antique appeal

 Sajavat, a recently-opened store on Purna Das Road, could be the destination of choice for those with an eye for antiques. From Victorian, French and Egyptian to ethnic Rajasthani figurines, the store houses an exclusive collection of artefacts in cold ceramic with porcelain finish.

 Its not always possible to come across real antiques. Though we have a huge collection of real ones, our skilled craftsmen also recreate the retro look, says Jolly Mansata, proprietor of the studio.

 An extensive catalogue allows a customer to choose a design that is recreated on order. While Indian craftsmen carve out the Rajasthani sculptures, the others are imported from Europe and created by workers appointed by the store.

 Cupids adorning mirrors and long side tables catch the eye, as do Victorian candle stands with flowers and figures and Egyptian vases. A line of tables is an absolute show stealer at Sajavat. Cold ceramic bases depicting children at a board of carrom or prisoners in a cell are topped with glass. Also on offer are coasters and original gas lamps from the British era.

 The star attraction, however, is the Radha-Krishna collection, portraying the gods in jhoolas. Ganesha idols are seen playing various musical instruments. The archaic garden pieces include huge planters, almost five-and-a-half-feet tall, adorned with horses and leaves, and fountains that look like life-sized statues. All the pieces are water and heat resistant, adds Jolly. The prices start at Rs 90 and go into lakhs.

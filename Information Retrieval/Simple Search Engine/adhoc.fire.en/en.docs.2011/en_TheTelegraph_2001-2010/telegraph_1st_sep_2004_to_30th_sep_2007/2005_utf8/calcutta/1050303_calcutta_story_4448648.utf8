The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

You are very giving and always ready to help; one of those whom relatives and friends swear by. You have an inherent charm that gets work done. You have several talents and can effortlessly play many roles at the same time. You are averse to taking risks. Beware of sycophants. ? Kusum Bhandari

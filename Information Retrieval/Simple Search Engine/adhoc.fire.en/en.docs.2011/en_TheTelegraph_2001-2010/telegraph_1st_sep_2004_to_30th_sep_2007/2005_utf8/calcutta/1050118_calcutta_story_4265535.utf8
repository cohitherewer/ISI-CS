The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Raid raj relief for restaurateurs 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Members of the harried hospitality trade in town have heaved a collective sigh of relief with Calcutta High Court on Monday slapping twin stay orders on the enforcement of packaged commodities rules and collection of amusement tax.

 Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhyay passed an order of injunction restraining the Controller of Weights amp; Measures from ?taking any steps or coercive measures? against members of the Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) on the basis of the packaged commodities rules. The court has directed filing of affidavits and fixed the next hearing in February.

 In another ruling that gladdened the hearts of the restaurateurs, acting chief justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Ashit Jumar Bisi restrained the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) from realising amusement fees from HRAEI members. The judges directed affidavits to be filed in trial court and the matter will be heard out.

 ?The injunction orders are very clear and will hopefully rid our association members of the nagging raid raj,? HRAEI president Baba Kothari told Metro. He lamented that the stay order, which was obtained by the national federation in Delhi High Court, was not being honoured in Calcutta.

 Alok Chowdhury, secretary-general of HRAEI, termed the raids by the inspectors of the legal metrology department and pressure from CMC officials ?arbitrary and grossly unfair?. 

 He said: ?We had earlier approached the government and the civic body several times with a plea to stop the harassment, but to no avail. Today?s court orders should sort things out.?

 The association has advised all its 430-odd members in eastern India to enrol with the national federation as well ?for added protection?. 

 S.K. Khullar, owner of Amber and past president of the Federation of Hotel amp; Restaurant Associations of India, said: ?We had reminded them (the inspectors) several times that the raids constituted contempt of court. But they were in no mood to listen.?

 Hotels and eateries on Park Street and elsewhere hailed the double stay orders.

 ?It?s a wonderful thing which we have been waiting for so long. But it?s a shame that we had to go to a legal bench to obtain clarity on this. The maximum retail price (MRP) clause is illogical. How can you equate a roadside paanwallah with a well-heeled restaurant or a five-star property,? said Nitin Kothari, proprietor of Peter Cat and Mocambo.

 Oasis owner Pratap Daryanani concurred. ?There is no way we can sell a bottle of cola or a beer at MRP with the air-conditioning, snacks and allied services,? he pointed out.

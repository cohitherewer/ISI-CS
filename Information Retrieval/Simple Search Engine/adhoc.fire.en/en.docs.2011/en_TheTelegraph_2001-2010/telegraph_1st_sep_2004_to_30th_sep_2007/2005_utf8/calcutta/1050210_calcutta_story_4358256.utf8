 Back to bliss, 

for judge

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Nirmal Mahinder, 40, a Howrah schoolteacher, married Tanima of Naihati, in North 24-Parganas, in 1994. Tanima went to stay with Nirmal?s joint family at Ramrajatala, in Howrah. Three years later, their only son was born.

 Tanima did not want to live in the joint family and repeatedly asked her husband to shift to rented quarters. But Nirmal refused. So, Tanima left her in-laws and went back to her parents in Naihati.

 In 2003, Tanima lodged a case in Howrah court against her husband under Section 498A (physical and mental torture). Nirmal had to obtain bail from court.

 Tanima moved Barrackpore court the same year, demanding maintenance. The court asked Nirmal to pay Rs 2,000 a month to his wife and son. Nirmal moved a petition against the Barrackpore court order in high court and the matter was assigned to Justice Amit Talukdar for disposal.

 The judge called the couple to his courtroom on Monday, and asked them to give it another try, avoiding a legal dispute, for the sake of their son. 

 Nirmal told the court that he had rented a flat in Howrah. Tanima agreed to stay with her husband.

 On Wednesday, Nirmal and Tanima came to court and told Justice Talukdar they had made up their mind to stay together again.

 In a similar case, Soumendra Mohan Dutta and his wife Sabita had been fighting a legal battle for the past few years. Sabita, too, had come to the court of Justice Talukdar, praying for an order asking her husband to enhance the money paid for maintenance.

 The couple, acting on the judge?s advice, went back home together. They returned on Monday to report the success of their endeavour.

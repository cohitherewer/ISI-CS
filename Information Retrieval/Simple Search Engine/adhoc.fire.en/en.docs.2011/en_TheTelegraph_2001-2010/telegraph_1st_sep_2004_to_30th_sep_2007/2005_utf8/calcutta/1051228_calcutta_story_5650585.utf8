 Absolutely. Children in Bengal never left their reading habit. But in other cities, where kids were busy with computers or TV, Harry Potter has been a boon. Even the sixth book of the series turned out to be a best-seller. The impact of the launch was the same even in non-metros like Siliguri and Gangtok. We have relaunched our Puffin series in 2001. More children?s titles are also being published.

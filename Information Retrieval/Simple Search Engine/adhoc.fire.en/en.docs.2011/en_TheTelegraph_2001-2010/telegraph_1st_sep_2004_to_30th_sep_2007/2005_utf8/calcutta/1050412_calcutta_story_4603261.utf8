 Medical seats found, a year lost

 They?ve lost a year, but on Monday, the smiles were back on the faces of 65 medical students caught in an admission bind. The Supreme Court has, after all, directed the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to admit them all to next year?s MBBS course.

 The division bench of Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari, based on a petition filed by the medical students, ruled that their case be treated as a special one and the 65 students be equally distributed in all nine medical colleges of the state. 

 The court clarified that since this was a special gesture, keeping in mind the future of so many students admitted through the so-called NRI quota, Monday?s order could not set a precedent for future admission procedures.

 ?The Supreme Court has shown us a way out of the problem. We?ll try and accommodate these students in medical colleges in the state,? chief secretary Ashok Gupta said on Monday. Asked whether this was a vindication of the government?s stand on the issue, Gupta replied: ?It is not a question of who won or lost, a major problem has just been solved and that is important? Once we have gone through the order, we will contact the 65 students.?

 The medical students assembled at SSKM Hospital, where they have been staging a dharna for the past few months. ?We are sad that a year has been lost, but we are extremely happy that justice has been delivered,? said spokesperson Gargi Bhattacharya.

 On September 29, 2004, Calcutta High Court in a landmark judgment had cancelled the admissions of 69 students. The students appealed to the Supreme Court, but on January 4, 2005, a division bench rejected the combined appeal of the Bengal government and the medical students to reconsider the order cancelling their admission.

 Those close to the tangle, meanwhile, warned of serious berth pangs next year, when 65 students from the JEE merit list would be denied a place in MBBS courses by the NRI bloc. ?We are trying to work out a formula for next year,? assured a senior government official.

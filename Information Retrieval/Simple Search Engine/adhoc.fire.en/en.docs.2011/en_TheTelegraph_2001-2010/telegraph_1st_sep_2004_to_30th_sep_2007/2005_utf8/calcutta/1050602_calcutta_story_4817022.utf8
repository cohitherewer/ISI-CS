 For those who had sampled her histrionics at Tollygunge Club some weeks ago, Tuesdays spoof on television shows at CC amp;FC gave a better glimpse of her versatility. What Usha Uthup does best on stage, other than making music, is mimicking just about everyone, from film-makers to politicians, journalists to sportsmen.

 The CCFC MTTV Expose 48/14, much on the lines of MTVs Fully Faltoo, found her flitting in and out of characters and costumes, with every voice modulation and accent variation in place. Steering the audience through the riotous ride was Renu Roy, sporting cropped hair and calling herself Charkha Dutt.

 All in one

 To start with, Usha strode in 

 as UN ambassador S.K. Boothalingam, who, in south Indian-accented 

 English, espoused his views at a chat show on matters topical 

 and not-so-topical, with innuendoes galore.

 Next up, an interview with Mahesh Matt. Sporting a scruffy wig, Usha was a leery, snooty film producer, fielding questions on casting couches and extra-marital affairs. To give him/her company was actress June, hailed as Mallika Shararat and busy flirting with a scriptwriter played by Arindam Sil. Leaving nothing to the imagination, the CCFC Expose even beamed video clips of Mahesh Bhatt with wife Soni Razdan and Pakistani actress Meera.

 Usha re-entered as Italian writer-actor and mafia don Giovanni Badrocinni to chat about his friendship with one Monia Mandy who had ditched him for an Indian.

 But the act that drew the loudest cheers was of Grammy-award winning Mboya Qwatilema, a crooner whose tunes had allegedly been lifted by Fanu Falik, granting the audience a breather from Ushas male personas, gruff voices, moustaches and all.

 Though laughter resonated from every corner of the hall, not all the lampooning was in good taste. The T.K. Banerjee episode, on a veteran footballer, was the rudest kick of all.

 Green with glamour

 If Ushas digs werent 

 enough, spoof blended with skin show to keep the audience 

 glued to their seats. A pair of dancers made all the right 

 moves to Tata Youngs Dhoom machale, sending 

 the oomph factor soaring (evident, at least, from the loud 

 clapping of male hands). More was in store with the couple 

 reappearing for the channels fashion bulletin, in 

 leafy green garments (remember the John Abraham-Aditi Govitrikar 

 go-veg ad for Peta?) and little else. A model showcasing 

 a ready-to-wear sari and June walking down in bridal trousseau 

 then pushed up the glamour quotient.

 Sight and sound

 Sound surpassed sight when pop 

 band Dhwani got down to making music. The four-member gang 

 belted out the first few stanzas of Kaho na kaho, 

 the Kunal Ganjawala hit from Murder, as well as the 

 original Arabic track.

 Stage anchor Shakeel Ansari walked in at one point for a spoof on Shatrughan Sinha and Kader Khan, while the only one to play himself on stage was ex-cricketer Saba Karim.

 The icing on the cake was Ushas daughter Anjali Kurien, who, on video, matched her mothers acting skills ? first as journalist Jharna Mukherjee reporting on a malaria outbreak in Madhyamgram and then as cookery expert Foody Dutta whipping up phuchkas.

 Style talk

 National Institute of Fashion Design (NiFD), Lindsay Street, organised a weeklong workshop between May 23 and 28 in which a cross-section of people, ranging from homemakers to students, got a chance to interact with experts from various fields and pick up some useful tips.

 We wanted to provide exposure to a wide number of fields through these interactive sessions, said a spokesperson for the institute. Among those who came to the talks table were designer Abhishek Dutta, Varda Goenka of Diagold, fashion photographer Raju Sultania, hair stylist Raman Bharadwaj, Vastu and Feng Shui expert Sheryans Rampuria, retired armyman Brig. Harish Swamy and make-up artist Prabir Kumar De.

 Shiamak Davar Institute for the Performing Arts, Talwalkers, Kaya Skin Clinic and Fevicryl Hobby Ideas shared grooming and personality development ideas with the participants.

 Students of the institute added value to the workshop by conducting an impromptu training session on the tie-and-dye technique of colouring. I didnt expect to learn so much in one week. I feel like a more aware person now, shared Sneha, a participant who has her sights set on a career in fashion or make-up.

 Ethnic chic

 Rustic handicrafts oozing ethnic charm are big draws to urban sensibilities, but few are aware of the sweat and the toil. A combined effort by a writer and a craftsman from Bangladesh is a step in that awareness-building direction.

 Behind Products, the bilingual book scripted in Bengali and English with detailed step-by-step description of how a handcrafted product is made in Bangladesh, was released in India at a function held in Oxford Bookstore last week.

 An hour-long audio-visual presentation by the duo ?Chandra Shekhar Shaha and Masur Mamun Mithun ? at the bookstore, amid a select audience including Bangladesh deputy high commissioner Touhid Hossain and political and cultural counsellor Jahanara Siddiqui gave an insight into the detailed research that went into the book, priced at Rs 1,300.

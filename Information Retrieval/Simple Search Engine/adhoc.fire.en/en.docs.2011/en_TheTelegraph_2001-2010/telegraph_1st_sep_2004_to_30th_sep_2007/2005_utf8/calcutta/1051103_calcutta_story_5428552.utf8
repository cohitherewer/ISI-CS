The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 LPG misuse draws frown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alarmed at the large-scale diversion of LPG cylinders, the government will set up a task force to prevent illegal use of cooking gas.

 Oil companies have made it clear that if the menace is not checked, supply of LPG cylinders to households will be seriously hit. 

 According to oil firm officers, at least 10,000 LPG cylinders are daily diverted to roadside eateries, dhabas and caterers in the city, instead of going to kitchens, thereby creating an artificial crisis in supply.

 State food minister Naren De said a task force will be formed, comprising officers from the four oil companies, legal metrology, food and supplies, city police and the enforcement branch. Representatives of LPG dealers will also be included.

 The task force will work in coordination with the oil companies. The force will conduct raids on eateries and commercial establishments to look into the use of LPG cylinders.

 The force will be empowered to book people illegally using domestic cylinders and charge a cash penalty.

 ?Many such complaints have reached my office. I have already taken up the matter and asked the legal metrology department to speak to the IOC officials and take steps,? minister De said. 

 He will convene a meeting with officers from oil firms, police and the enforcement department to prepare an action plan to stop the menace.

 The oil companies have been complaining for quite some time that domestic cylinders are being used for commercial purposes. 

 A joint raid was conducted a couple of months ago on the gold ornaments market in Bowbazar, where several domestic cylinders were seized. After that, there was no move.

 The food minister said the problem would not be solved by conducting raids or arresting some traders. ?It needs regular checking. The oil companies will have to keep a vigil on their dealers and we will help them to crack down on illegal users,?? the minister said.

 ?We have written many times to the state administration to crack down on illegal users of LPG. But, we are disappointed with their reluctance in this matter,? IOC deputy general manager A.C. De said on Wednesday.

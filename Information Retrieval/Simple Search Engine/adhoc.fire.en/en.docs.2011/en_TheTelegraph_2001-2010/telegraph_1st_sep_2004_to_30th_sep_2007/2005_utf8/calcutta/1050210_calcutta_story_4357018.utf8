The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

The 30th edition of the Calcutta Book Fair was a melange 

of the old and the new. The ?little magazines?, dusty jholas and Dutta?s 

telebhaja hadn?t lost any of their charm. The railway restaurant was my 

favourite this year. If there were prizes for the stalls with the largest queues, 

Ananda and Penguin would be convincing winners. Intimidating.

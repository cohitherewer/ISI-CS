 Robbers slash girl, loot cash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two men in their late-20s on Wednesday night raided a second-floor apartment in Howrah, slashed the wrist of a teenaged girl and decamped with Rs 4,000. None of the neighbours could muster the courage to resist them.

 The robbery took place around 8.30 pm at Ashray, a multi-storeyed building in Ambika Kundu Lane. The duo pressed the doorbell of Asish Bhattacharya?s apartment and called his daughter Anwesha by her nickname. The couple was not home at the time.

 On hearing her nickname, Anwesha, who was alone, thought someone close to the family was outside and opened the door. ?The men immediately forced their way in and closed the door. One of them picked up a bowl from the room and hit the girl on the head,? said an officer investigating the case.

 The duo then asked the girl to hand over the keys to the cupboard. ?She pretended to give them the keys, but threw it under the bed at the last moment,? added the officer.

 ?The two noticed a bag kept on the bed. But Anwesha prevented them from getting hold of it.? 

 Unable to take away the bag, which contained Rs 10,000, one of the youths took out a blade and slashed her wrist.

 ?During the scuffle, the money fell on the floor. The two left with as much cash as they could in a hurry,? stated the officer. As soon as the men left the apartment, Anwesha started screaming for help. But none of the neighbours came to her aid.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I request the traffic police to take steps against cyclists who often break road rules. Cyclists are frequently found crossing roads, sometimes even busy intersections, unmindful of the traffic lights. They also overtake buses from the left when they halt at bus stops to pick up passengers. In the process, they often bump into passengers. A few days back, I spotted a milkman on a cycle violating the traffic signal and almost ram into a taxi at the crossing of Rashbehari Avenue and SP Mukherjee Road. I caught him and took him to the traffic sergeant on duty, sitting near the police booth. When I narrated the incident to him, he sarcastically suggested that I let the milkman meet with an accident instead of coming up to him to complain. Earlier, constables used to deflate the defaulters cycle tyres. I am sure that this simple punishment will force the cyclists to think twice before violating traffic rules. 

 Saumya Datta,

 HM Road. 

 A CESC transformer in front of our house obstructs the main entrance of our building at BE/1/1/A, Deshbandhu Nagar, in Baguiati. We are not even able to drive our vehicles into the parking space on the ground floor. Its proximity is also compromising our safety. The transformer continuously generates a high-pitched sound, literally giving us sleepless nights. We have consulted competent electrical engineers who have pointed out that the transformer can be shifted to either of three spots near the building without much alteration to the electrical cabling. The authorities have so far only come up with illogical justifications. The transformer should be shifted at the earliest.

 Siddhartha Sengupta,

 Baguiati. 

 A garbage vat on Lee Road has spilled over on to the adjacent footpaths. I have noticed that the handcarts used by the conservancy staff to carry the garbage are rickety. Once I saw a cart overturn and the man had a tough time removing the garbage and putting it back onto the cart. Often, the conservancy staff sets afire the pile of garbage on the roadside. It not only pollutes the air but also causes much inconvenience to the residents of the area. The civic body should think of alternative methods of collection and disposal of garbage.

 Shiv Shanker Almal, 

 Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Belmuri station, in the Howrah-Burdwan cord line, is a busy one with thousands of commuters using it every day. However, the Up platform of this station is so low in height that passengers face an ordeal while boarding the train. Besides, the toilets on the platform emit a nauseating stench and are always dirty. The railway authorities should take corrective measures.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia.

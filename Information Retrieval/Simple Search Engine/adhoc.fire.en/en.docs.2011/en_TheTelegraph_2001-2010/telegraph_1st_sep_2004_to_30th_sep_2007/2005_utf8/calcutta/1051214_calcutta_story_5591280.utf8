 Magic pull of Potter pages

 Today?s question: Has Harry Potter taken children back to books? More responses will be published next week

 Wizarding hour: Children gather at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland for the launch of the latest book

 Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake

 The Harry Potter books have undoubtedly proved to be a hit among the kids, but not every parent will be able to afford them. 

Sohini Roy,

 Harry Potter has certainly taken the children back to books. However, the young wizard?s fans read only books on him and nothing else.

 Ramit Das, 

 Achena Park

 The long queues of children at the launch of the Harry Potter novels and everyday usage of words like wizards and muggles are irrefutable proofs of the popularity of the books. But it would be a mistake to credit only J.K. Rowling with capturing the children?s imagination with written words.

 The statement is partially true, especially for Bengali children. Other children?s books are not hyped in the manner of the Harry Potter novels. Also, most children?s stories are not filmed. Having said that, there is no denying J.K. Rowling?s contribution to children?s literature.

 J.K. Rowling?s wonder boy has reacquainted the young generation with the pleasures of reading. The older people, too, eagerly await the arrival of new Harry Potter novels. The sale of the books is increasing steadily. They are even being translated to regional languages. That surely indicates that Harry Potter has taken children back to books.

 To some extent. Because, nowadays, a lot of children hardly get time to finish their schoolwork. They do not have the leisure to read books, even if they want to.

 Children were getting more and more addicted to computer games when Harry Potter came along. The popularity of his books is certainly worth appreciating. Children not only read the novels, but wait eagerly for the publication of the next. The young wizard has indeed taken kids back to books. 

 Saadia Sitwat,

 Linton Street 

 Children had stopped reading anything except their textbooks and had gravitated to other hobbies. The Harry Potter books, though a little expensive, have stemmed the rot. The young wizard has lured the kids back to the magic of books. 

 Debasish Chakraborty, 

 Cossipore

 The Harry Potter films have also contributed to taking children back to books. Every time a Potter film releases, the novels register a growth in sales.

Biman saha,

 Lake Town

 The present generation is more interested in the various forms of electronic entertainment than in humble books. There is no reason to believe that the craze surrounding Harry Potter novels extends to other books as well. The sales figures of J.K. Rowling?s works are exceptions rather than the norm. Unless other children?s books register a significant growth in sales within the next few years, we cannot say children have gone back to books. 

Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

 Certainly not. Children, that too of affluent English-medium school, queue up in front of bookstores only for the launch of the Harry Potter books. Their enthusiasm is considerably less for other books. Since the Harry Potter movies started being made, many children have stopped reading the novels. Only the demise of television can take children back to books. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake

 I was present at a city bookstore on the day the latest Harry Potter novel was released. To my great surprise, even the naughtiest child was waiting patiently for his copy. The happiness I saw on the kids? faces after they got their copies in hand cannot be expressed in words. Some even started reading the book right away. This type of craze for a work of fiction is rare among children nowadays as most of them prefer computer games and television. Therefore, I believe that Harry Potter has indeed taken children back to books.

 Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

 There are many children who read just Harry Potter books. However, the genuine book-loving kids have a varied reading list and continue to devour one book after another through the year. Moreover, the price of the Harry Potter novels puts them out of the reach of many parents.

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 I don?t think Harry Potter alone has taken children back to books. They themselves have started reading for a break from the burden of school curriculum. Fiction not only increases the imagination of the kids, but also indirectly helps them in their studies.

 Whose vote is it anyway

 The danger of music shows is that the makers are more concerned about TRPs than the grammar of judging

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This is an old story. It is also a funny one. I am hoping that you may tolerate a repeat exposure. There was this man who was fond of alcohol. He often wondered which is more intoxicating ? whiskey, rum, gin, vodka or brandy? One day, he decided to conduct an experiment to unveil the answer. On Monday, he drank whiskey with water. On Tuesday, it was rum with water and the following three days, he changed to the other versions but drank them all with water. On all five days, he got happily drunk. Saturday was spent nursing his hangover. On Sunday morning, with a clear head, he concluded that it was the water that was intoxicating.

 I was reminded of this story while watching the musical Mahayudh on TV. During the preliminary stages of the contest, two eminent persons from the world of music judged the performances. The contest has now reached the last-10 stage. Presumably to enhance viewership, judging of the performances has now been entrusted to the viewers. Viewers through SMS or phone calls send in their preferences and that becomes the basis for eliminating one contestant every week. 

 Many argue that if the winner is to be rightfully called the Voice of India, then the views of that entire India must choose the winner. For the sake of simplicity, even if we assume that viewers of this programme are the real India, the objection is that those who take the trouble of voting may not represent the views of those who are too lazy to vote. Incidentally, we choose our members of Parliament exactly the same way. So this may not be worth a shout. 

 But there is this other issue of parochialism. Each candidate, we are told, attracts the lion?s share of votes from his state or region. Indeed, this is presumably part of the plan. The candidates are given TV time during the show to appeal for support. They are encouraged to do so in their native languages. A well-spread viewership may well be more attractive for advertisers but the trouble is that as a result, the winner may be determined only by the self pride of his community rather than any musical parameters.

 That in fact is the tenor of the other objection as well. Many fear a mismatch between what needs to be judged and what the jury is capable of judging. As lay listeners of music, our liking or disliking a song is usually the combined effect of the singer, the melody, the lyrics, the musical arrangement and often the picturisation in a feature film. Our response is inevitably to the organic whole. We are not trained to appreciate the guitar that plays or the voice that renders.

 There is very little reason to believe that while judging this contest, viewers will behave any differently. Thus it is very likely that a singer crooning a superhit song only moderately well will score more in our books than another contestant who sang a lesser known song brilliantly. More so because the differences between the contestants are narrow. They are all extremely talented and have passed through very competent scrutiny by Pandits and Ustads. There is a real danger that we will end up rewarding the best song rather than the best singer. Like our man in the story, we have convinced ourselves that water is the root cause for hangover. The tragedy is that we can do no better. 

 It is unlikely that the makers of the TV show are unaware of this. They are justifiably more concerned about TRPs rather than the grammar of judging.

 True, the gospel says consumer is the king. Let us remember the footnote ? only in his kingdom.

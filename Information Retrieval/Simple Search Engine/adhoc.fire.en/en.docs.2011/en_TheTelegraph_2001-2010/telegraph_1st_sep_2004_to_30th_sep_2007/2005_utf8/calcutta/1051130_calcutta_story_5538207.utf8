The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mishap? Set up a bump

 PRONAB MONDAL

 One more death on the city?s streets, and for no fault of the pedestrian. So, what does the Calcutta Police do? Build another mammoth speed bump as it did on Prince Anwar Shah Road after another woman was run over and killed recently?

 Knee-jerk reaction, rather than a proper traffic policy, seems to be the police ploy to combat rash driving and curb the casualty count.

 The traffic department had initiated a number of measures ? counselling rogue drivers to booking jaywalkers ? that have all flopped badly.

 The latest reaction was even more myopic ? a speed bump on Anwar Shah Road the day after an accident.

 So how many speed bumps need to come up on BT Road or on AJC Bose Road, thoroughfares that recorded 22 fatal road mishaps each in 2004?

 ?Setting up bumps cannot be a solution. We cannot anticipate where an accident is going to take place. There is no logic behind such a decision,? admitted an officer of traffic department.

 ?What should be ensured is unfettered movement on the footpaths and roads clear of encroachments,? he added .

 During a recent cop-citizen interaction at Nandan, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee recounted how on a recent visit to London, he had seen how people obey traffic rules, and thereby help keep the accident count low.

 On the contrary, he said, people in Calcutta pay scant attention to traffic rules and thereby endanger their own lives and that of others.

 But surely, the carelessness of the pedestrians cannot deflect attention from the callousness of the cops towards the rising road mishaps.

 ?Police should have short-term, mid-term and long-term plans for traffic management in place,? argued a section of the speakers at the session.

 If the police do have any such plan in place, it is a well-guarded secret. For at no forum has the police commissioner or any of his senior team members given the slightest hint of a roadmap ahead to manage traffic better and lower the mishap count.

 So, we wait for the next mishap and the next bump.

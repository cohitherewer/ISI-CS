 Checks, spot fines on state buses

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) has strengthened its ticket-checking system and decided to fine not just the ticketless traveller, but also the conductor on duty.

 The move follows a sharp rise in the number of passengers on long-distance routes, who are in the habit of travelling without a proper ticket, and conductors who charge a lesser amount without issuing a ticket.

 ?A ticketless passenger will be fined Rs 150 and the conductor of the bus Rs 250. The conductor?s penalty will be deducted from his salary,? said CSTC managing director Ashok Bhattacharya.

 According to the plan, corporation officials will travel in buses in the guise of passengers and check tickets midway. Officials will also be present at bus stops to examine the tickets of passengers getting off the vehicle.

 Though it is the responsibility of the conductors to ask passengers for their fares, officials said, commuters, too, must realise that it?s their duty to buy a ticket soon after boarding the bus.

 At least 15 to 20 per cent passengers are in the habit of travelling free or buying a ticket for a distance less than what has been travelled. While getting off, most bribe the conductors a few rupees.

 A section of conductors, on the other hand, tends to charge less fare from a passenger and does not issue a ticket. The entire amount goes into the pocket of the conductor.

 Managing director Bhattacharya said surprise checks have started and more than 200 passengers and over a dozen conductors have been fined. 

 ?We want to ensure that a passenger buys his ticket soon after boarding the bus and curb corrupt practices by a section of conductors. Our aim is to increase the revenue collection,? said an official.

 The corporation earns around Rs 19 lakh daily from ticket sales. The target is at least Rs 25 lakh a day.

 In another development, the corporation has decided to organise workshops for drivers. ?The workshops will be conducted at the CSTC depots. All 2,000 drivers will be trained in batches,? said an official.

 ?The drivers will be taught how to ply vehicles safely. Apart from automobile experts and CSTC engineers, representatives of automobile, insurance and oil companies will conduct the courses,? the official added.

 Around 40 drivers are likely to attend Friday?s workshop at the Lake depot.

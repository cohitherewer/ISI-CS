 Floating fun

 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Floating on the Ganges while on a date to remember is not a distant dream any more. Efforts of Tourism Kolkata, the company that started Jahaj Park and Bhoj Tori last year, have resulted in a floating venue next to Scoop, the ice cream parlour on Outram Ghat, for Calcuttans to have some fun on the waterfront.

 From 10 am to 8 pm every day, the vessel ? Cuisine Cruise ? will be anchored at this destination complete with food-and-beverage stalls, music and games.

 Guests can board this floating funspot for tickets costing Rs 50. Part of the money spent on the ticket could be redeemed at the food stalls.

 ?We have kept the price of the entry tickets on the higher side to ensure quality control of the crowd,? says Nitai Bera, manager of Tourism Kolkata. ?But once on board, guests can stay as long as they want.?

 Every Sunday, Cuisine Cruise is converted into a family getaway steeped with Bengali tradition. Taking off from the historical Shutanuti Ghat of Bagbazar around 6 pm, the vessel takes a trip to Belur temple and back in four hours.

 ?The package costs Rs 300 per person and is inclusive of snacks and dinner,? says Bera. A sumptuous Bengali meal (dal, rice, vegetables, three different fish preparations, chutney and rosogolla) on the Hoogly is definitely the most mouth-watering prospect of the trip.

 The waterfront hangout will be formally floated in the first week of May.

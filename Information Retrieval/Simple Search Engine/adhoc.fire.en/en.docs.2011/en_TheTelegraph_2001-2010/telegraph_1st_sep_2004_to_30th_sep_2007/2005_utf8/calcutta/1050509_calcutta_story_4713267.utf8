 Awareness key to mishap curb

 TREAD TALK: A road-safety camp organised with Barasat choolchildren

 Samir Ghosh: Calcutta Police often organises programmes to make people aware of the traffic rules. Do you undertake similar programmes?

 Though there is an acute shortage of manpower and funds, we organise traffic awareness camps in various schools to educate students about traffic signals and the utility of facilities such as zebra-crossing. Some of our officers visit the schools to conduct these sessions. 

 Once the students become aware of the traffic rules, we expect the number of accidents, as well as traffic problems, will decrease. The youngsters will discuss what they have learnt with their guardians and older siblings at home, thus spreading the awareness.

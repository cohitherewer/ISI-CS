 Exploring emotions

 An experimental presentation that brings together the emotional essence of poetry with the dynamism and spontaneity of dance, Versedance takes the audience on an uncharted journey where a melange of art forms collide and converge to provide a breathtaking aesthetic experience. Comprising three performances, this evening?s presentation explores the delicate, often fluid layers of human emotions, through an artistic amalgamation of poetry, music, theatre and dance. Robe of Silence, the first piece, is based on a collection of poems by Rilke, an early 20th century German poet. It exposes the conflict between man?s love for the written word and his confinement within it. My Home, compiled from Amrita Pritam?s work, voices a woman?s eternal and elusive quest for her own home. It tells us of the betrayals and transgressions faced by younger women and, at the same time, expresses the nostalgia of older women for the comfort and solace of their mother?s lap. The final item, Endless Weight, based on Jibanananda Das? poems, is about the paradox of human isolation in the midst of love. Presented by Nuances. Concept, choreography amp; direction: Jhuma Basak.

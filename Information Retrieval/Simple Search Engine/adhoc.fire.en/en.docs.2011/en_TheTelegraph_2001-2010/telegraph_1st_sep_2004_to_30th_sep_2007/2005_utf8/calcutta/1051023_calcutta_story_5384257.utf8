The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

In ballroom, under shamiana

 A moment from Rangakarmee?s Sarhad Paar 

Manto 

One Sunday hot and humid, another drizzly and dreary. 

One at Saturday Club, another at Tollygunge Club. Both bound by the unifying creative 

thread of theatre ? the stage and setting makeshift, but the audience rapt and 

the applause rapturous.

Clubs are not too far a cry from the proscenium when 

it comes to hosting a play these days. Members and their guests are lapping it 

up and the club authorities are all too happy to dish it out ? for cultural brownie 

points and for a visible value-add.

At Saturday Club, where Rangakarmee performed Sarhad 

Paar Manto a few Sundays ago, the makeshift stage was constructed by sealing 

off a portion of the ballroom (or badminton court, for the sporty). 

?We simulated a theatre premise on the club grounds 

for Sarhad Paar?,? says Renu Roy, entertainment convener of Saturday Club. 

?The only problem they faced was acoustics. Usha Ganguly used lapels, hanging 

and foot mike. The ambience sound may filter in but then that?s agreed upon between 

the performers and the club authorities.?

The audience comprises club members and their guests. 

Members are welcoming plays at their clubs because it saves them the trouble of 

buying tickets and parking, smiles Roy.

It also adds up to a nice outing with family and friends 

in familiar surroundings ? start at the bar, sit through the play and then head 

for the dining room, all in an evening at the club.

?Plays have become very popular at our club. Large 

numbers want to watch theatre. The Rangakarmee play was quite successful and some 

other group will perform next month. We are likely to host Sabyasachi Chakraborty?s 

group Charbak in December-January,? says Arjun De, president, Saturday Club.

And for once it?s the experience that counts, not 

the expenditure. ?We foot the bill for the infrastructure required for a performance 

and theatre groups give us a little concession,? says De.

Tolly has played quite an active role in providing 

a stage for club theatre. ?We have organised shows at the HSBC Hall and also outside. 

When it?s open air, people usually hop over to the bar and food counters during 

the interval but the theatre groups who perform here agree to it. Earlier, we 

had organised Feminine Monologues, Going Home and Koi Ek Raat 

at Tolly. Sponsorship isn?t a problem because sponsors like the audience profile 

and theatre groups are also interested in trying out new venues,? says Renu, who 

also heads Spandan.

The theatre groups quite like performing at clubs 

as they get exposed to a different cross-section of audience. But how do they 

adjust to the unfamiliar setting? ?I usually go through a conflict when it comes 

to performing at clubs. But the last two shows were very well organised. At Tollygunge 

Club, there was a huge turnout as the stage was constructed under a shamiana. 

At Saturday Club, many people stayed back to interact with us,? says Usha Ganguly.

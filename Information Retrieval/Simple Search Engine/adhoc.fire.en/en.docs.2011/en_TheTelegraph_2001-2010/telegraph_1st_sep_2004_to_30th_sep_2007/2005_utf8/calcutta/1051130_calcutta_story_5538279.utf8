The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Schedule shuffle to beat the smog

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Fighting the fog is one thing, beating the smog quite another. The infamous city smog has been sending flight schedules haywire this winter, forcing airlines to reschedule their itineraries.

 The airport authorities had taken precautions this year to minimise fog-related flight disruptions. A vast stretch of grassland near runway 19 was mowed and several waterbodies around the perimeter filled so that the moisture content in the ambient air would be lowered.

 The plan has come a cropper due to increased air pollution. ?Rise in industrial pollution, construction activities and traffic flow around the airport have dashed our hopes. The fog might be less this winter, but the suspended dust particles have upset calculations,? director of the airport meteorology department A.K. Das told Metro on Tuesday.

 ?The smog and the haze is so dense that it has become impossible to keep the airport functional after midnight and in the early hours,? Das added.

 Many of the factories that have contributed to the increase in pollution in the area have come up illegally, claimed airport officials.

 Concerned at the pollution problem and the real-estate boom on Jessore Road, the airport authorities have broached the subject of regulatory measures with the district administration.

 ?We have already lowered the chimneys of several factories. We will launch a crackdown against all activities detrimental to flight operations,? said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar. 

 Reluctant to risk the time-cost loss, the airlines have opted for a schedule reshuffle to give the smog the slip.

 Thai Airways, which is flying out from the city to Bangkok seven days a week, has, on an experimental basis, shifted the take-off time to evening from early morning. The new time will be effective from December 1.

 ?Due to low visibility, we have had to divert flights or hover over the airport for a long time, resulting in loss of expensive aviation fuel. We are confident that the new time will be convenient for everyone,? said Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, general manager (Calcutta) of Thai Airways.

 Singapore Airlines, too, has advanced its departure by a few hours. ?With the Calcutta weather in its elements this winter, we have decided to reschedule the flights on all four days of the week from December 2,? said Bharat Mahadevan, manager (east).

 Malaysia Airlines and British Airways have also made changes to their flight schedules to avoid delays.

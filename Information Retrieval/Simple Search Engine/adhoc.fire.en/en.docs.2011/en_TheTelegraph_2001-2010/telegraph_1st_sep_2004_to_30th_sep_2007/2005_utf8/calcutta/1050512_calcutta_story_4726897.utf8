 What rsquo;s vat? Shutters down in the Esplanade area for a trade bandh. A Telegraph picture

 Shyam Benegal is wrong when he says that the Bengalis are responsible for Netaji Subhas Bose fading ?from the national canvas? (Why should Netaji be Bengali hero?, April 14). It was the Gandhi-Nehru combination along with their political cohorts who are culpable. Netaji was virtually a persona non grata with this lot because not only was his ideology radically different from theirs but more importantly, he posed a huge threat to Nehru?s claim for India?s post-Independence prime ministership as Netaji?s popularity and charisma were far superior to Nehru?s. 

 Hence Netaji was forced to go away to Russia. Continuous efforts have been made over the past six decades to obliterate Netaji?s achievements from the minds of our people. For example, 90 per cent of India?s institutions, facilities and geographical landmarks are named after the Gandhi-Nehru clan, the latest being the tsunami relief initiative as well as the Hyderabad airport which are being named after Rajiv Gandhi. 

 Our Communists on their part vilified Netaji under instructions from Russia and China and are now making sham attempts to undo their acts due to vote bank concerns. In fact some of Nehru?s reported comments on Netaji to the British are unprintable! 

 I personally requested icons like Captain Bipul Sarkar of the INA?s secret service and Captain Gora Dey of the Indian Legion to write their memoirs so that India?s youth can become wiser on this score; Captain Laxmi Sehgal should set the trend for such biographical ventures. 

 Jayanta Kumar Dutt,

 Apropos the report ?Traders spare daily needs?, April 20, it is most disheartening that a wholesale bazaar bandh was called immediately after three days of strike following the imposition of VAT. Due to panic-buying on the bandh-eve, prices of rice, flour, edible oil, sugar and butter went up in some areas of the city. The state government has failed to convince traders about the efficacy of VAT, which is why they are calling strikes frequently, creating inconveniences for consumers in the process. Even if the authorities fail to stop the bandhs, they should at least take stringent action against the unscrupulous businessmen. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 How some human sharks with no morality and limitless greed are running old age homes has been highlighted in ?Murmurs of discontent at homes?, April 18. The owners of the homes are at fault for denying aged men and women proper facilities after they have made hefty security deposits and monthly payments. A committee of a retired judge, a retired principal and a senior physician should be constituted to make periodic visits to the homes to keep a tab on the facilities. 

 Bhupendra Nath Bose, 

 Dum Dum. 

 It is shocking that facilities provided in old-age homes that charge exorbitant fees are inadequate. Given that many poor, aged people are being treated shabbily by their own children, there is need for the state government to build free old-age homes. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 In this age of nuclear families, there is no space at home for aged parents. Left with no alternative, they take shelter in old-age homes, which unfortunately are only after their money. The government should step in as a monitoring body. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane. 

 The state transport department is finally considering a long-standing demand of regular bus passengers (Study reflects what bus users want, April 13). The buses lack leg room, seating space and wide aisles. As for the suspension, the less said the better. The present fleet of buses seems designed to provide maximum standing space, with no consideration for the sitting passengers. The jerks get magnified and a sudden application of brakes can cause long-term damage to one?s spine. The high footboard and narrow doors are also quite dangerous. 

 N.S. Ramakrishnan,

 EM Bypass. 

 The report ?10 injured in gang war over graffiti?, April 20, highlights the lack of regard for the law among political parties. Since graffiti is one of the easy ways to attract the attention of voters, political activists fight among themselves to take control of the maximum number of walls. 

 In the report, CPM councillor Manjit Kar has accused CPI (M-L) of harbouring Maoists ousted from Nepal. It is not clear why she kept mum about such a blatant violation of law. Isn?t she equally guilty for suppressing the fact from the police? The cops should not treat such an allegation lightly, since the security of the country is at stake. 

 Debyani Basu,

 Birati. 

 Apropos the report ?Suicide sets off soul search?, April 18, it is interesting that the authorities of an English-medium school have formed a committee to investigate the suicide of a student. The tremendous pressure created by guardians and school authorities play a part in pushing youngsters over the brink. It is hoped that the committee will take steps to improve the environment in the school. 

 Debaprasad Mukherjee,

 Nayapatty Road. 

 Knowingly or unknowingly, teachers often mete out preferential treatment, causing mental scars in students. It is encouraging that St Joseph?s Convent has formed a panel to probe the death of Tiyasa Biswas. 

 Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake.

 The two installments of Hard Talk with Partha Chatterjee, MLA Behala West, (April 11 and 18) show how adept politicians are at dodging questions and giving hollow, unconvincing answers. In response to almost all the questions, the MLA said he would look into the matter. Any layman could have replied thus. 

 Pijush Banerjee, 

 Sarsuna.

 CPM woos settler votes

 - Mamata makes Left jittery

 LAKE DISTRICT: Settlers along the railway tracks from Ballygunge to Tollygunge. A Telegraph picture

 Alarmed at Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee?s growing popularity among the settlers along the rail tracks between Tollygunge and Ballygunge, the CPM is out to woo the vote bank back before Assembly elections 2006.

 In wards 89, 90 and 93, covering 2.5 km of railway tracks and a vast portion of the Lakes, Trinamul candidates won for the second successive time in the civic elections, trouncing Left Front nominees, including two CPM leaders.

 Shaken by its poor showing in the wards, the CPM?s Calcutta District Committee is desperately trying to rope in a group of 3,200 settlers, who had all cast their ballots in favour of Trinamul candidates in the June 19 civic polls. The Left leadership is worried that the group will vote Trinamul in the Assembly elections, too.

 ?We will not allow Mamata to politicise the controversy surrounding the rehabilitation of the settlers. I have already taken up the matter with the chief minister,? said Rabin Deb, Left Front chief whip in the Assembly.

 Deb, a CPM legislator from Ballygunge and a member of the party district committee, declared that the party would shortly launch a campaign to convince the settlers that the government is against their eviction. ?Instead, we are exploring ways to rehabilitate them. The government is ready to build dwelling places for them, if the railway provides the land,? he added.

 Asked if the party would pressure the government to prevail on the railways to allot land for the rehabilitation, Deb replied in the affirmative.

 ?We will have to work out something concrete to resolve the problems affecting the settlers much before next year?s Assembly polls. Untoward incidents have to be averted before the elections,? he asserted. 

 The high court had directed the railway to submit a status report on the rehabilitation. The railway subsequently pleaded helplessness to provide land for the resettlement. This has provoked strong protest from Mamata and other Trinamul leaders. 

 At a mammoth rally on Monday, Mamata threatened to start a statewide agitation if the government and the Centre evicted the settlers without making alternative arrangements. She claimed that slum-dwellers from across the city would join her in a united resistance against the move. 

 ?There are 2,700 families living along the railway tracks. Any attempt to use bulldozers will be fought tooth and nail. Policemen will have to shoot me first,? Mamata thundered at the rally.

 Saugata Roy, Trinamul legislator from Dhakuria and president of the Tollygunge-Ballygunge Railway Colony Sangram Committee, said the settlers have already stopped using the Lakes in accordance with the court?s order.

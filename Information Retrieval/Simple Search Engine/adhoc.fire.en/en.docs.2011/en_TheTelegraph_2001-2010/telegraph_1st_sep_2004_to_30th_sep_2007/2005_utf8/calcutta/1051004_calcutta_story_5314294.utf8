 Musical communion

 Music speaks a language that knows no boundaries. Stepping across culture, custom and convention, it reaches out to the heart through its ubiquitous qualities of rhythm, melody and harmony. This is Not Fusion, No Added Sugar is a unique musical presentation that goes beyond merely delivering a tuneful mix of Indian and Western notes. Rather, it creates a new musical idiom and rhetoric where the emphasis lies on sharing, exchanging, assimilating and appropriating what is best in both kinds of music. In it, new songs and new ideas are born as jazz, blues and rock enter into a ?conversation? with their distant relation, the raga. Featuring Amit Chaudhuri (vocals; picture above), Taj Junaid (guitar), Mainak Nag Chowdhury (bass), Indrajit Dey (keyboard) and Ashok Mukherjee (tabla). Concept: Amit Chaudhuri. Guest performances by Anjum Katyal and Ishita Ganguly (vocals) and Debabrata Mitra (piano). Hosted by Spandan, in association with Patton.

 Snazzy snips in tress studio

Ipsita Deb, Zeeshan Jawed

If 

you?ve been waiting for weeks to get an appointment for a really special haircut 

at one of Jawed Habib?s salons, here?s a piece of good news. The master hairstylist 

has gifted the city yet another address for his exclusive styles. 

 The salon by the same name as the other two on Ho 

Chi Minh Sarani and at Shoppers? Stop, Forum ? Habibs ? is situated at 7/1A Short 

Street.

 The expert stylist was present at the inauguration 

on Thursday, armed with winter haircuts for one and all. He also shared his views 

on the latest global trends in hair styling and spoke at length about tress-care 

regimen for the season.

Stressing the need for special hair care in the cold 

weather, Habib said: ?In winter, due to the dry weather, the menace of dandruff 

increases and if this is not combated on time, it leads to hair loss and even 

premature greying. Hence, deep conditioning and applying the right oils and serums 

are essential during this period.?

 Talking about trends, he emphasised straightening, layering and hair colouring as the current rage. ?Designer hair cuts are the order of the day with people becoming more and more conscious about global styles and trends.?

 The new salon sports the same swank and colourful look of the other branches and offers state-of-the-art equipment for hair styling. 

 Amidst all the style talk, there was some serious concern for social causes as well. ?Ten per cent of the proceeds from every haircut at this salon till January 25 will be donated to tsumani relief,? promised Habib. 

 In Mumbai, Habib will conduct an eight-hour non-stop haircutting session, the entire proceeds of which will go towards charity for the same cause.

Food stop

 The same old multi-cuisine spread in an innovative garb ? that?s what Food Station, a brand new eatery in Bhowanipore, promises to dish out. 

 The 35-seater restaurant that opened its doors to Calcuttans on the last day of 2004 is a branch of Food Station on College Street, a popular hangout for the area?s college-going crowd. 

 The new eatery has been done up with a railway platform 

as the theme. While one of the outer walls flaunts a huge graffiti of a platform, 

many other smaller paintings of railway pantry cars have been put up on the inner 

walls. 

 The menu has been designed like a train track and some of the dishes are named after railway jargons.

 The menu offers a selection of South Indian, Continental and Chinese cuisine. The dishes have been priced very reasonably, keeping the spending capacity of college-goers in mind. 

 Said proprietor Vijay Harlalka: ?My target clientele is the college-going crowd and hence the pricing has been kept deliberately low, same as the cost structure of our College Street branch. The most expensive item on the menu is a non-vegetarian Chinese meal that comes for Rs 90.?

 The restaurant at 12 Ramesh Mitra Road will be open from 10.30 am to 10.30 pm everyday.

 Hospitals on signage makeover mission

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 More than 70 per cent of Calcuttans end up in the wrong department while visiting private hospitals. The figure shoots up further in government hospitals. 

 An overwhelming majority fails to comprehend the signage in city hospitals, none of which use symbols to make life simpler for patients and employees.

 These are the findings of a study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai. Based on the conclusions, the city hospitals have embarked upon an image makeover. 

 Making the departments easily recognisable and the environment warm and stress-free, using contemporary, patient-friendly signage, tops the agenda.

 Colour-coding is also being contemplated so that patients can reach the right ward without difficulty. It is quite possible that in a few months, emergency departments will be painted red, surgery sections light green and paediatric wards blue.

 ?We will replace the age-old signage with interesting symbols, images and signs,? stated Rupak Barua, executive vice-president of Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Institute.

 The Peerless Hospital authorities have decided to initially invest about Rs 35 lakh in the signage installation project. 

 ?Once the new signage is in place, patients won?t have to waste precious time during an emergency in finding their way,? Barua added.

 Sajal Dutta, president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, said: ?Confusing signage has turned out to be a major headache. The practice of deploying public relations officers to guide patients has not worked out very well.? 

 An internal survey at Ruby General Hospital has revealed that subtle changes in the old signage have not yielded dividends. According to the hospital spokesperson: ?The results have highlighted the need for a rethink of the signage strategy.?

 Unscientific installation of signage ? about 10 to 12 are often put up in one place ? is not only confusing for the patients, but often becomes stressful for nurses and other healthcare personnel.

 ?Directing people to various departments all through the day irritates the nurses no end,? opined Kaushik Chakraborty, general manager, Primesite, which has been entrusted with the responsibility of coming up with interesting signage for some hospitals.

 ?Our emphasis will be on changing the image of hospitals from a house of horrors to wellness hubs,? Chakraborty signed off.

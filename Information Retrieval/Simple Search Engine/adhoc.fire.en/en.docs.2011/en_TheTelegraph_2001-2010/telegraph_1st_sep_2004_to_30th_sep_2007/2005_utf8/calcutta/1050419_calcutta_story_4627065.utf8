Godfather to Batman, it?s all in the game

With popular celluloid characters springing from the 

big screen to the console, there are no full stops for the games people can play.

A game version of a Hollywood movie is more the norm 

than the exception these days. Allowing viewers to enter and participate in the 

movie they have just seen helps studios earn millions. As more and more big-ticket 

movies ready for release this year, work continues in feverish mode on their PC, 

Playstation 2, Xbox or GameCube versions. Here?s a look at a few of the big ones?

Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith

May the force be with the Jedi embarking on the game 

version of the final prequel of the Star Wars series! The Anakin Skywalker and 

Obi-Wan Kenobi duel of good and evil is replayed in the interactive version. As 

Anakin, players can unleash the power of the dark side in ruthless lightsaber 

and Force attacks. As Obi-Wan, they strive to save the galaxy from darkness.

Releasing two weeks before the film, the game will 

offer a sneak peek into the movie ahead, besides battling through 16 levels (including 

some never-before-seen locations inspired by the film) and unlocking other characters, 

locations and bonuses.

Working closely with the stunt co-ordinator of the 

film series Nick Gillard, ?the most authentic lightsaber combat ever? has been 

created for the game, with choreography taken directly from the films as well 

as new stunts created exclusively under the auspices of Gillard.

Release Date: May 5, fortnight before film

Batman Begins

There is a huge hype over this film which looks at 

the origin of Batman. And the game, scheduled to release on the same date as the 

movie, only adds to it. Also from the Electronic Arts stable, the game invites 

you to step into the shadows of Gotham City?s perilous criminal underworld and 

true to the character of Batman, use fear as your ultimate weapon.

Gamers get to play both as Bruce Wayne and his masked 

crusader avatar Batman as he tackles some of his most challenging foes like the 

Scarecrow, Ra?s Al Ghul and Carmine Falcone. Batman being an urban legend, each 

enemy has a fear rating, and depending on their level of fear, fight bravely, 

poorly or simply run for their lives.

The game locales extend from the halls of Arkham Asylum 

and the alleys of Gotham City to an ancient monastery high in the Himalayas. Lots 

of high-tech gadgetry is on offer through the Bat Utility Belt, including the 

Batgrapple, Batarang, Optic Cables and Lock Picks, besides riding the Batmobile.

The voice cast for the game is almost identical to 

the movie with Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth), 

Liam Neeson (Henri Ducard), Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes), Cillian Murphy (Dr Jonathan 

Crane), Tom Wilkinson (Carmine Falcone) and Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) recreating 

their roles.

Release date: June 17, with movie

The Godfather: The Game

The Mario Puzo-penned Francis Ford Coppola classic 

makes its game transition with remarkably lifelike graphics and star cast of voiceover 

artistes from the movie. The coupe de grace for the producers was getting 

Marlon Brando to provide the voice, only six months before his death, for Don 

Corleone. James Caan returns as Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as consigliere 

Tom Hagen but unfortunately, Al Pacino refused to offer his services for Michael 

Corleone?s character.

In the Electronic Arts game, the player joins the 

Corleone family, America?s most famous criminal organisation, to earn respect 

through loyalty and fear while he rises through the ranks to become Don in a 1945-1955 

New York. There will be missions from the film as well as new and original missions 

with characters from the film to complete.

The opening sequence of the game, released as a trailer, 

is a frame-by-frame replication of the Don?s shooting scene rendered in stunning 

3-D computer graphics.

The only sour note in this melody is the displeasure 

expressed by Coppola himself. He slammed Paramount Pictures for selling the game 

rights to the movie and not asking him whether he thought it was a good idea or 

not. Coppola was further annoyed going through a preview build of the game and 

observed that it uses ?characters everyone knows, and then for the next hour they 

shoot and kill each other?.

Release date: 2005 fourth quarter 

From Russia With Love

Actors including Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench and John 

Cleese have lent their voice to James Bond games in the past, but this classic 

movie to game transition has none other than the original Bond, Sean Connery, 

recording the dialogues. 

?As an artiste, I see this as another way to explore 

the creative process,? Connery has said. ?Video games are an extremely popular 

form of entertainment today, and I am looking forward to seeing how it all fits 

together,? the actor who made his second appearance as Bond with From Russia? 

offered.

This game, which follows the 1963 movie closely (including 

the battle on the Orient Express and the boat chase sequence), will also be released 

by Electronic Arts. The company achieved considerable success with 2004?s GoldenEye: 

Rogue Agent, which put players in the shoes of the villain GoldenEye and From 

Russia? should be no different. 

As Bond, the player can visit exotic locales, drive 

vintage cars and meet beautiful women, as well as utilise cool toys like the jetpack, 

a Q-copter and the trusty Walther PPK handgun. The experience is likely to leave 

you shaken? and stirred.

Release date: November 2005

As plans are firmed up for new movies, the list of 

games directly spun off or inspired by them will also grow. Particularly in case 

of sequels in progress like Harry Potter or Spider-Man.

In fact, Electronic Art has just announced the Harry 

Potter and the Goblet of Fire videogame scheduled for a November 2005 release 

in conjunction with the movie.

In this version, a new spell-casting system allows 

players to feel the magic as the controller shakes and reacts with every flick 

of the wand, while co-operative play can combine magic to produce more powerful 

spells than ever. Highlights: the Quidditch World Cup campsite and a duel with 

Lord Voldemort himself.

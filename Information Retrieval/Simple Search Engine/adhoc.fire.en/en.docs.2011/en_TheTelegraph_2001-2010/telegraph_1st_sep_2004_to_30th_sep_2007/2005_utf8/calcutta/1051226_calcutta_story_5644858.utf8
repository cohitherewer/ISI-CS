 Quaint, yet contemporary, dapper and design-driven, intimate, but inventive. And of course, very, very European?

 Housez 43, Calcutta?s ?first value boutique hotel?, readying its foyers and front desk for an early January launch, promises to return a slice of Europeana to good old Free School Street (now Mirza Ghalib Street), by ?creating value? at the mid-segment.

 ?Our value-added proposition will be offering a boutique experience to guests at medial tariffs and giving European tourists a format they are familiar with back home, at a location they feel comfortable in,? says S.H. Rahman, who was general manager, sales amp; marketing, The Park, for 12 years.

 Rahman, along with another ex-Park executive Rajendra Mehrotra and Tridib Ghosh, formerly with Kenilworth, forms the core trio at the heart of the 28-room venture. The boutique hotel hoping to swim against the tide with its ?European value-hotel feel? and wireless Internet facility, is housed at 43, Mirza Ghalib Street, a corridor now all but overrun by Bangladeshi tourists.

 With room rent in three categories ranging between $60 and $80, Housez 43 is looking at a core clientele of European tourists and business travellers. ?We are trendy and design-driven, with a lot of travel and research in Europe, providing inputs for interiors done by Design Studio,? declares Rahman.

 Mehrotra, who was with The Park for 37 years, feels the other defining element would be the ?service differentiation we can offer with our collective experience?. The 125-year-old building has been taken on ?long-term lease? from the owners, the Deys, and completely renovated and restyled to fit the profile.

 Right from the iron-bar entrance to the silk portiere cushioning, the colour contrast at the first-floor lobby, the personalised butler service and the compact, functional rooms, the boutique rendezvous is one continuous study in typical European elements blending with ethnic chic.

 The trio, which has roped in ex-Park executive chef B.K. Dhar, has also fired the woks at Turkish Corner, a Mediterranean fast-food takeaway joint adjacent to the boutique hotel. ?Besides the authentic Turkish delicacies, we will have a strong stress on Continental fare and also on Bengali cuisine to give the foreigners a taste of local culture,? says Ghosh.

 After Calcutta, the management of Housez 43 is keen to take the value boutique hotel chain to Siliguri and Ranchi to begin with and then, go national with the concept. 

 ?Our larger vision is to give the state a facelift through tourism by creating a signature property foreigners can relate to,? observes Rahman.

 With this objective, he had also launched Connect World, a ?one-window solution to all travel-related needs?, after leaving The Park in March this year. ?Housez 43 will also be fully equipped to answer the requirements of the business tourist, with latest communication equipment,? Rahman stresses.

 While the group plans to take the Turkish Corner concept to all its boutique hotels, the Shawarma-Shashlik combos will also come up in standalone formats at various locations across the city. A buffet hall, a hookah lounge, two conference rooms and facility for terrace parties complete the boutique bouquet.

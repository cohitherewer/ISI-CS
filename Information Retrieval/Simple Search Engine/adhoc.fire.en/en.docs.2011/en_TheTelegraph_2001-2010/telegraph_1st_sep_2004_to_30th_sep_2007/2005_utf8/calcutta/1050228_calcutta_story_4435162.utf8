 Katrina Kaif: Hair and how

Whats Kat up to now? 

It?s another jewel in the brand-studded crown of the 

queen of the ramp ? Katrina Kaif. Pantene has officially signed on the gorgeous 

model-turned-actress as its new brand ambassador. Katrina joins Pantene?s league 

of past celebrity endorsers including Sonali Bendre, Bipasha Basu, Shilpa Shetty, 

Amrita Rao, Anupama Verma and Tara Deshpande.

 Commenting on her association with Pantene, Katrina said: ?I always believe that hair that is nourished and strong from within looks healthy and beautiful from outside. Look out for my new Pantene campaign, which has been shot in Malaysia.?

 As for her filmi fare, Katrina has just shot for Ram Gopal Varma?s Sarkar and is also slated to appear in David Dhawan?s untitled venture opposite ?friend? Salman Khan.

 Theatre stalwart Suman Mukhopadhyay is in a bit of a bind with Vijay Raaz returning to the country, having been held up at the Abu Dhabi airport on drug possession charges. Raaz was supposed to play the lead in Mukhopadhyay?s debut film, Herbert, to go on the floors on March 1.

 ?When he was incommunicado in Dubai and I had to start the film on March 1, I went ahead and chose our very own Subhasish Mukhopadhyay for the role. I had considered Subhasish long back before casting Raaz. People have usually seen him as a comic actor but I have seen his work in a completely different role in a film named Shilpantar.?

 So now that Raaz is back and very much in contention to play the role will Suman go back to him? ?No, I can?t do that. We are going ahead with Subhasish, who had requested me saying that irrespective of what happens I shouldn?t replace him.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Almost a month has elapsed after the pujas. But many of the roads dug up to erect bamboo barricades have not been repaired yet. An example is the stretch from Sealdah railway station to Jagat cinema on APC Roy Road. During rush hour, waves of local train commuters hit this road at frequent intervals. The private buses also line up bumper to bumper near the flyover to pick up passengers. In the rush to board the bus, people often are unmindful of the holes on the road. A fall might cause severe injuries. I have witnessed a similar incident on November 6 when a middle-aged man?s foot got stuck in a hole causing a bad sprain. Why the delay on the part of the civic body to carry out such small road repairs?

 There is a shortage of competition postcards, aerogrammes and postal orders of certain denominations at post offices in Dum Dum Park, Baguiati and Ashwininagar areas. Sometimes, even money order forms and inland letters are out of stock. I request the higher authorities to take note of this problem.

 The phonelines of BSNL?s customer care service for DataOne subscribers are always busy. What?s the use of it being open 24-hours a day?

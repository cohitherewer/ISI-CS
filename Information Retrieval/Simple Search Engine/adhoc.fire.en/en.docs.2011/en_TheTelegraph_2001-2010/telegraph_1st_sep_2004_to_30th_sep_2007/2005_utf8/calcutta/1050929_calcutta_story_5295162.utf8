The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Society before self

 Urmila Matondkar pays her homage to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat, and (below) with Anupam Kher in Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara

 The babe-turned-behenji brigade is truly taking a toll on Bollywood. Whether it?s Shilpa Shetty trading her hot skirts for flowing salwars or Amisha Patel opting for widow ware over her exotic wardrobe. But things possibly can?t get worse with the original oomph girl Urmila Matondkar continuing to breathe serious cinema. Gone are the days when she would burst into the streets jiving to Tanha tanha or explode the states of UP and MP with her Chhamma chhamma poise.

 ?Oh yes, even I am dying to do the song-and-dance routine again,? Urmila told Metro. ?It?s been some time that I have done that. Or even a comedy for that matter.?

 While those dream projects continue to queue up in the pipeline, Urmila will again be seen in a brooding and harrowing role this Friday in Jahnu Barua?s Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara. The film which talks about Gandhian values in contemporary times features Urmila as troubled protagonist Anupam Kher?s daughter. ?It?s very much a father-daughter story, how they live for each other through all the difficulties that strike them,? explained Urmila.

 The actress best known for her collaborations with Ram Gopal Varma in films like Rangeela, Kaun and Bhoot, was initially reluctant to do Maine Gandhi... ?When I was offered the role, I thought to myself, ?Oh God! Another serious film.? But then as I read the script I realised that we all have some social responsibilities to fulfil and I should do the movie as a human being more than anything else.?

 Urmila admits that she had to unlearn her Bollywood ways to work with someone like Barua. ?Without sounding pompous, I would like to say that no other star would have done a role like this. There is no acting at all. You are just there in the film as your character and things just happen.?

 There are also great words of appreciation for co-star and producer Kher, under whose direction Urmila had worked in Om Jai Jagadish. ?It?s really commendable on his part to come forward and support a film like Maine Gandhi...,? she said. ?As an actor, I think this is easily one of his best performances till date. The two of us really had a great time working for the film.? 

 After the social call has been answered, Urmila will finally get to do some naacha-gaana again. She has recently signed Shyam Benegal?s next film, Chamki, which is a musical adapted from Georges Bizet?s classic opera. Urmila had featured in Benegal?s take on the Mahabharat, Kalyug, 25 years ago as a child actor.

 ?I am really looking forward to start shooting for the film, sometime this winter,? gushed Urmila. ?It will, of course, be great working with Mr Benegal, but also the script of the film is very good.?

 And hopefully, the Rahman-Urmila combo will again set off firecrackers like Rangeela and Daud.

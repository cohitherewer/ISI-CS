The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Laugh and cry with the Diwali delights

 Two crazy comedies and an emotional tearjerker invade the theatres this Wednesday. Metro previews the three

 Ok, it?s that time of the year again when you spend more time at the INOXes and Priyas than anywhere else. Bollywood and Diwali go hand in hand, in darkness or in light.

 Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan, Veer-Zaara, Aitraaz, Mughal-e-Azam? Diwali is the season of blockbusters and really, it?s no surprise then that every producer in tinsel town would love to unveil his film during this festive period. But if your film is not packed with stars, it?s not that great an idea to take on the big guns.

 A film like Home Delivery which was always a Diwali release and even had a special number titled Happy Diwali ? picturised on Naseeruddin Shah in a guest appearance ? was pushed back in apprehension of fizzling out to the Salman Khans and John Abrahams. As director Sujoy Ghosh puts it: ?We can come later in a much bigger way in more number of halls. It doesn?t make sense to crowd the Diwali week.?

 But it does make a whole lot of sense if your star power ensures a bumper opening and the Diwali period ensures one long party. 

 So, here?s what?s in store...

 Film: Kyon Ki?

 Director: Priyadarshan

 Cast: Salman Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Rimii, Jackie Shroff, Om Puri

 Plot: Anand (Salman) is set to marry Maya (Rimii) when an accident kills Maya. Unable to overcome the shock, Anand loses his balance and is sent to a mental hospital. Here, he is nursed back to health by Dr Tanvi (Kareena) and the two fall in love. But hospital head, Tanvi?s father Dr Khurana (Puri), refuses to accept that Anand is cured in order to separate the lovers.

 History: The main plot borrows heavily from Deep Jele Jai ? which was later remade into Khamoshi ? although the director feigns complete ignorance. At the time of the making, Kyon Ki? was touted to be a remake of the Jack Nicholson-starrer One Flew Over The Cuckoo?s Nest.

 USP: People?s favourite star Salman is back in an author-backed tragic role after Tere Naam, where too he had gone crazy and had Himesh Reshammiya songs to cry to. Priyadarshan, who?s recently made only comedies in Hindi (Hulchul, Hungama) is trying his hand at an emotional saga after the critically acclaimed Gardish and Muskurahat.

 Show: 89 Cinemas ? 11.30 am, 1.20 pm, 4.25 pm, 7.30 pm, 10.35 pm; INOX (Forum) ? 12.40 pm, 3.50 pm, 6.25 pm, 9.40 pm; INOX (City Centre) ? 12.45 pm, 3.55 pm, 7.05 pm, 9.45 pm

 Film: Shaadi No. 1

 Director: David Dhawan

 Cast: Sanjay Dutt, Fardeen Khan, Zayed Khan, Sharman Joshi, Ayesha Takia, Esha Deol, Soha Ali Khan, Aarti Chhabria, Sophia Chaudhary, Riya Sen

 Plot: Raj (Fardeen) wants wife Bhavana (Ayesha) to be in the bedroom but she prefers the prayer room. Veer (Zayed) wants to have a good time with wife Diya (Esha) but she is obsessed with acting. Aryan (Sharman) is all for love while wife Sonia (Soha) is a lifeline for women wanting divorce. So when the men meet bombshells Rekha, Dimple and Madhuri (Aarti, Sophia and Ria) they go berserk. But Lucky Bhaiyya (Dutt) is hell bent on making life miserable for the wayward husbands.

 History: The latest in the No. 1 films from producer Vashu Bhagnani and director Dhawan, after the likes of Hero No. 1 and Coolie No. 1, Shaadi No. 1 has the same theme as Masti and No Entry, where husbands go astray leading to laughter. 

 USP: The new David Dhawan brand of comedy, which is all about designer clothes and hip-hop background tracks, is in full display again. Cousins Fardeen and Zayed come together for the first time but Dutt?s the man with the best lines and a heavy Punjabi accent.

 Show: 89 Cinemas ? 10.40 am, 2.50 pm, 5.25 pm, 8.05 pm, 10.40 pm; INOX (Forum) ? 10.15 am, 1 pm, 3.45 pm, 7 pm, 10.45 pm; INOX (City Centre) ? 11 am, 1.40 pm, 4.20 pm, 7 pm, 10.40 pm

 Film: Garam Masala

 Director: Priyadarshan

 Cast: Akshay Kumar, John Abraham, Paresh Rawal, Nargis, Neetu, Daisy, Rimii

 Plot: Mr Hot aka Mac (Akshay) and Mr Cool aka Sam (John) are two photographers whose pictures are always out of focus. Mac, the typical flirt that he is, is out to woo his three gorgeous neighbours, airhostesses Priti, Sweety and Puja (Daisy, Neetu, Nargis), despite being engaged to Anjali (Rimii). Sam, Mac?s best friend turned worst enemy, is out to expose him. In the middle of all this is the cranky cook Mambo (Rawal).

 History: Garam Masala is a remake of Priyadarshan?s own Malayalam film Boeing Boeing, which itself was a remake of the 1965 John Curtis-Jerry Lewis-starrer Boeing Boeing.

 USP: Coming from the master of situational comedy, Garam Masala has all the makings of a blockbuster with some great music by Pritam. Three new hot bods and the even hotter chemistry of Akshay and John make this the Diwali must-watch. And, of course, there?s the genius of Paresh Rawal.

 Show: 89 Cinemas ? 12.15 pm, 2.20 pm, 5.30 pm, 8.05 pm, 10.45 pm; INOX (Forum) ? 10.05 am, 11.45 am, 2.30 pm, 5.15 pm, 8 pm, 9.45 pm; INOX (City Centre) ? 10 am, 11.40 am, 2.25 pm, 5.10 pm, 7.55 pm, 10.10 pm

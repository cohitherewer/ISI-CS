 New role for the force as stage actors 

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Fourteen cops from Shibpur police line and some police stations performed a one-act play, Sajan, on Sunday at a theatre festival organised by Padmapukur Sanskritik Parishad. 

 The play was conceived by additional superintendent (headquarters) Kalyan Banerjee.

 Banerjee was inspired by his superintendent Mihir Bhattacharya, whose play Jignasa was staged by a group of policemen at the same festival on May 4. 

 That was the first public performance in Howrah of a play written, directed and acted in by the men in uniform.

 A group called Barnali has been set up to organise cultural activities among policemen. ?We want to provide a platform to the cops to display their creative talents,? said superintendent Bhattacharya.

 The theatre festival, Banerjee added, is also an opportunity for the force to increase its connectivity with the masses. ?People harbour a lot of misconceptions about us. We want to remove them.?

 Stressing the need to build bridges with the public, Banerjee said: ?The word ?police? strikes terror in the minds of the people. We want to put across the message that we are actually friends, not enemies, of society.?

 As for the role of Barnali, Bhattacharya said: ?If an organisation invites us, we will be happy to stage our plays, provided our actors don?t have any emergency job.? 

 There is tremendous excitement among cops over the cultural move and many of them are queueing up before director Gopal Chandra Sapui, an assistant sub-inspector in the Shibpur police line?s armed section. 

 ?When I received the go-ahead for Jignasa, I was virtually mobbed by colleagues who wanted to play roles. From 40 candidates, I had to choose 10,? Sapui recalled. 

 But why did the organisers of the theatre festival invite Barnali, when there are so many professional groups around? Supriya Bandopadhyay, chief adviser of Padmapukur Sanskritik Parishad, said: ?We wanted to encourage the initiative taken by the Howrah police authorities. Many a time, the cops have to bury their talent under workload.? 

 During the May 4 show, inspector-general (prisons) Joydeb Chakraborty, theatre personality Gyanesh Mukhopadhyay and actress Madhabi Mukherjee were in the appreciative audience.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rampage over tease protest

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A group of youths, reportedly owing allegiance to the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the CPM youth wing, went on the rampage at the Khardah residence of LPG dealer Avijit Konar around 10 pm on Wednesday.

 The reason: Konar had lodged a complaint against some of the youths, who had allegedly harassed his daughter earlier in the evening.

 Six persons were arrested on Thursday evening, said Parveen Kumar, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police. Earlier in the day, he told Metro that an FIR had been lodged against Supriyo Nandan, alias Bua, and three of his associates. 

 Additional police superintendent Manoj Verma, however, had denied knowledge of the incident.

 According to Khardah police, Konar?s daughter Ranjita, an MBA student, was being harassed by a few youths, belonging to the Joygopal Road locality in Khardah, over the past few weeks. 

 ?Konar, in his complaint, claimed that these youths used to follow Ranjita and pass lewd remarks whenever she stepped out of the house,? an officer of Khardah police station said. 

 On Wednesday evening, the youths, led by Bua, had followed Ranjita on her way to a tutorial. ?When she protested, they started harassing her physically,? the officer said.

 Ranjita managed to run back home. When her father heard about the incident, he stepped out and found the group still at the spot. 

 ?I asked them to stop harassing my daughter, but they warned me with dire consequences if I reported the matter to police,? 48-year-old Konar said.

 Unfazed, he lodged a complaint at Khardah police station around 9 pm. However, when he returned home an hour later, he allegedly found Bua and a mob of about 50 standing outside his door, the lock of which was broken. His drawing room had been ransacked and the windows smashed.

 ?Before they left, they warned us of more trouble if we didn?t withdraw the complaint,? Konar said.

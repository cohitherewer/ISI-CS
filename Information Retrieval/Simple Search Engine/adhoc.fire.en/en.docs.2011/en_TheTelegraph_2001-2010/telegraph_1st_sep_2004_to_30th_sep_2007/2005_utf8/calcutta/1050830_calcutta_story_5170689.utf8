 The stalemate at Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) entered Day IV on Monday, with director Abhay Srivastava and other governing council members of the institute staying away from the EM Bypass campus.

 The students have resolved to continue their ?indefinite strike? until the governing council calls them for talks and addresses their grievances.

 Citing ?severe mismanagement? and ?gross irregularities in the basic running of the institute?, the students have shot off letters to officials in the information and broadcasting ministry and also to members of the governing and academic councils.

 The funds crunch and other problems apart, a huge backlog of projects and classes is taking its toll on the academic curriculum at the country?s second film institute after FTII, Pune.

 SRFTI offers a three-year course, but if first-year students started classes eight months behind schedule, the third-year students are well into their fourth year.

 The institute had taken a break from admissions in 1998. After three zero years ? from 1998 to 2001, during which the authorities were supposed to have sorted out the problems ? a fresh batch was inducted in September 2001.

 But those students have had to stay on, with nine out of 10 diploma films still stuck in post-production.

 ?Having been admitted in 2001, I should have graduated by September 2004. But my diploma project is yet to be completed,? said Dhruba Ghosh, of direction and screenplay writing.

 This delay has slowed down two successive batches ? the third-year students admitted in July 2002 by a year, and the first-year students admitted in December 2004 by eight months.

 ?Since we don?t have labs, our student films are sent to Chennai and Bhubaneswar for post-production. Often, there is a delay at their end, which causes the backlog,? Amaresh Chakraborty, head, direction and screenplay writing, SRFTI, told Metro on Monday.

 ?Also, our equipment breaks down sometimes, as a result of which the scheduling suffers. One has to draw up a special schedule now,? he added.

 The delay has caused a space crunch on campus. 

 ?There are not enough resources to accommodate four batches in the hostels and so, around 16 students are staying in a makeshift dormitory,? pointed out Rajneesh, a second-year student.

 If the students are demanding immediate action, the authorities are waiting for the special committees on administrative and academic activities to submit their reports.

 Till then, the entrance to the main building remains under lock and key.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Eastern Railway (ER) recently celebrated Satarkata Swachetana Saptaha. During the week, it put up banners on Sealdah station premises urging commuters to purchase and carry valid tickets for their rides. Ironically, some unauthorised persons at the north and south gates of the station are collecting money from small traders and vendors for ?allowing? them to carry along their goods in local trains. They do not issue tickets or receipts against the payments. Are the ER higher authorities aware of this practice?

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 The potholes on most footpaths in the city are first filled with stone chips and repaired properly later. The damaged stretches of the pavement along AJC Bose Road are an example. Why doesn?t Calcutta Municipal Corporation carry out permanent repairs at one go? 

 Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Calcutta Tram Company (CTC) runs bus services from Maidan to many areas in the city?s suburbs. Of late, a particular bus route from Esplanade to Jangipara, in Hooghly, has suddenly been withdrawn. Many local people who relied on the service are facing difficulties now. I request the CTC to restart it at the earliest. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur.

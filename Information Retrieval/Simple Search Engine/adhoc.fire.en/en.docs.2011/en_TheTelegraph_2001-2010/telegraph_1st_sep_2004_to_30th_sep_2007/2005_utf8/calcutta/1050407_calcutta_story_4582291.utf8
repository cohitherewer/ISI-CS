 Back to school in holiday hours, by choice

 It is summer vacation. The courtyard of South Point School that bustles round the year with students on the move and excited exchanges between teachers and guardians is silent. The whole building seems to be in hibernation. 

 But move up a couple of floors and the classrooms suddenly come alive with a lot of song and dance ? a chorus of voices, recorded music and the clap of footsteps. 

 ?We are holding a workshop this year for the kids,? principal Madhu Kohli beams. And why not? ?The exams are over and the new session is yet to start. All that the kids do now is watch TV or trouble parents at home since they have nothing to do.?

 Four options were on offer for the workshop ? dance, song, art and craft, and computers ? and that too on a voluntary basis. Those who chose to sign up are now coming to school for two-and-half hours every morning through the week. 

 At the end of the stint, they would put up shows for their parents on April 13 and 14. 

 Going by the gusto with which drawing books are filling up or mouses are being dragged, the kids are having a super time. ?We are preparing a report on tsunami,? Amitangshu and Priyankar of Class V say, pointing to a screen full of facts and figures. 

 Most of their classmates had chosen the same subject. Hence, Sagnik and Pujon preferred to work on their dream holiday. Switzerland is their destination and they proudly display the video clip on the country they had found on the Net and attached to their report. 

 The Class IV teams are busy explaining the germination of seed on the monitor. Isn?t the subject less interesting than tsunami and dream holiday? Sangita, Anirban and Indranil look a shade downcast but Sagnik quickly quips: ?They are not having to do any research like us. Germination is there in the life science text book.?

 The students are all united on one count: ?School during vacation is fun, especially since this does not make us sit for exams.? 

 The logic for attendance is similar for children in the other workshops. ?My para friends are still busy with exams. This way, at least I get to meet classmates,? says Kazi Anoushka of Class III, who learns Odissi in Dona Ganguly?s school.

 And teachers do not seem to mind either. ?We have to attend school for four hours even during vacations. So it is fun to utilise our extracurricular skills,? says Nilanjana Dasgupta, an English teacher doubling up as Odissi instructor at the workshop.

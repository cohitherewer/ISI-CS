 Speedboat taxis on the Hooghly

 - Come May, commuters will have a cool option, tourists a cab on water

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Zip down the Hooghly to Belur Math in 15 minutes flat or Haldia in a breezy four hours. Starting May from Millennium Park, Calcuttans who shun traffic will have a cool option to cruise distances, with speedboats skimming the river.

 Vivada Inland Waterways is setting sail with two vessels in May, and will add two boats every month to its fleet. The company, with a 35-year history on the Hooghly with its oil and cargo vessels, has been tapping the tourist market for the past five years.

 ?There has been little or no initiative to make a ride down the Hooghly attractive or joyous,? says Ankur Dave, executive in charge of the project. ?Speedboats are a part of our bigger expansion plans on the river,? he reveals.

 Tourists and companies from industrial areas like Haldia and Budge Budge are high on Vivada?s hit list. ?There are a large number of people who commute from Calcutta. We aim to provide them with a fast mode of transport,? explains Dave, who has not yet finalised the fare structure.

 For tourists, the added advantage is flexibility. The speedboats are not being restricted to a fixed route. ?We could take tourists wherever they want to go, depending on the availability of a jetty,? observes Dave.

 The water taxis, which can accommodate 12 passengers, will have 20-litre fuel tanks, and consume around eight to 10 litres an hour. The 7.3 m-long vessels, made of fibreglass and fitted with an outboard motor at the rear, will travel at a speed of 12 to 15 knots or 22 to 24 km per hour.

 The shallow draught will allow them to navigate even shallow waters. They will not be affected by tides, and the buoyancy chambers will be filled with polyurethane foam to prevent seepage of water.

 ?Not more than two people are needed to handle the boat, which will lower operation costs,? says Manoj Sha, owner, Calcutta Sportsboats, which is building the boats.

 ?It would be like driving a cab on water. They will run on petroleum with engines meeting the EU 2006 norms,? explains Sha. ?These boats will eventually be the fastest and most eco-friendly mode of transport on the river,? feels Dave.

 Rang revelry

Himika Chaudhuri hands out tips 

for getting high on Holi hues

 Do 

 Organise the bash on a terrace or the lawns

 Do up the decor with coloured water-filled balloons and huge buckets full 

of abir

 Keep loads of thandai to quench the thirst of the guests 

 Dont 

 Overdo the bhaang bit

 Dish out an elaborate food fare (do keep the grub light and snacky)

The most lasting image of a Holi bash is possibly that of the Rang barse song made famous by Silsila, with Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha romancing the rang while the colour is drained from the faces of Jaya Bachchan and Sanjeev Kapoor. 

Bollywood has had Holi parties aplenty ? both on and 

off screen. The Holi bash of the Kapoor family at one time used to be an annual 

event in tinsel town. Parties at the Bachchan residence and in more recent times 

at Shah Rukh Khan?s bungalow are some of the best-known Holi dos. While not aiming 

for the stars, you can make your own Holi bash memorable.

Ambience

 You possibly can?t play Holi inside your house, so the first pre-requisite is to have either a terrace or a lawn where all the action will take place. Since footloose fun is the mantra, the ambience has to be informal and colourful. To ring in the look of the day, line up the entrance or the sides of the terrace with huge buckets of abir in various hues. Putting up strings of balloons filled with coloured water could be a smart thing to do, since you can use these through the day. 

If you are lucky to own a swimming pool, then fill 

it up with colour and make that the starting line for the days? activities ? just 

push all your guests into it and see them getting into the mood. If not, then 

getting a couple of makeshift baby pools is an option; at least the kids can make 

a splash to remember. 

Music

 After two glasses of thandai, expect to see even the most glum member of your group breaking into a jig. So, getting the music right is important. You could opt for the traditional dafli players who will keep the background score for the party going with a steady flow of beats and by belting out some evergreen Holi numbers too. 

If you are the techno sort, then hiring a DJ might 

be more up your revelry street. ?One can start off with some folk music that have 

dafli beats and folk numbers and then move on to the original versions 

or remixes of songs like Jai jai shiv shankar, Rang barse, Khaike 

paan Benaraswala as the party begins to hot up,? says DJ Girish. Playing CDs 

of Hasya Kavi Sammelans at the beginning or end of the party when everyone is 

relaxing is also a good idea. 

Food amp; drinks

 What?s a Holi party without a bit of bhaang? While the traditional intoxicant is popular at Holi dos, care must be taken not to overdo it as it can result in major health hazards. The more new-age options could be puchkas filled with alcohol.

In the food department, ?the lighter the better? remains 

the tag line. ?No one plays Holi after having a big meal so it?s best to keep 

the menu mild. Chaats and pakoras are excellent for the purpose,? 

says food entrepreneur Naveen Pai. 

Dress code

 Ethnic is the keyword in the dress code for the day. The women can go for sparkling white salwar kameez teamed with colourful bandhni dupatta. Donning a white sari or one with light-coloured lehriya would also suit the mood. 

 White kurta pyjama is the most traditional Holi gear for men and pairing them with a bright dupatta will help the style bhais make quite a statement.

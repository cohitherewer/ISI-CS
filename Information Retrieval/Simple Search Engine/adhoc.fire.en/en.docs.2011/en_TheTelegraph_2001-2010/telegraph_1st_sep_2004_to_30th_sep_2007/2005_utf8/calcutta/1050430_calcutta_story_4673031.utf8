 For those who wanted a whiff of J.Lo?s newest perfume, it?s now officially available in the city. Miami Glow, the latest offering from the house of Jennifer Lopez, was launched at Cloud 9 on Thursday night. 

 Young dancer Farah Bawari of Oops! fame performed to J.Lo numbers through the night, while the nightclub was given a beach makeover.

 It fit right in with the mood of the actress-singer?s perfume, tropical in origin and a merry mix of pink grapefruit, coconut water, passion fruit and black currant.

 The price range for Calcuttans to get up close and personal to J.Lo will be Rs 1,700 to Rs 3,000, for 30 ml, 50 ml and 60 ml bottles.

 Bar beauty

 It?s the perfect combination for those who love bikes and babes. The International tour of Leather and Lace: The Girls of Harley Davidson are all geared up to go in Calcutta.

 The team that brought in the Coyote Ugly International Tour in November 2003 is back with two gorgeous girls from the Harley Davidson Bar in Las Vegas.

 They will perform on Saturday at Tantra to the remixed sounds of top rock tracks. An exclusive fashion show has also been built into the performance, jazzed up further with shot bartending and bar dancing.

 The Leather sequence will reveal the Harley gear along with bar tricks and performances, while the Lace sequence should provide a sharp contrast in style.

 Summer style

 Priyanjali Ray?s spring collection is out once more. ?Relaxed and light? is how the young designer describes it, with layers and a return to colour. The line ? feminine, filled with soft cuts, styles and delicate in treatment ? can be seen at her 5, Alipore Road studio (by appointment only).

 Mixing vintage and modern elements, the lightweight textures are layered and cut to slimming effect.

 Based on soft fabrics like chiffon and crepe, the ensembles are personalised and custom-made to suit each buyer?s body and personality. 

 Floral prints and subtle embroidery complete the ensembles.

 On the style front, the line includes an assortment of tops with innovative cuts, skirts of all sizes and lengths, flowing and fitting, and even dresses. 

 While these are ideal as the dress code for a glamour-packed evening, simple tees with catchy phrases and drawstring pants in summery shades of pink, aqua, sky blue, lime green and yellow, perfect for the casual day out, are also available here.

 ?The effect of colours, drapes, styles and cuts come together in a creative whole this summer in a line that?s bold, yet utterly feminine, with a feeling of movement in the flow and feel of fabrics,? says Ray.

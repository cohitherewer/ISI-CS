 Applying liberal doses of a sunscreen lotion minutes before stepping out in the scorching heat might be the most common technique to combat tan, but its definitely not the most effective one. To get rid of the dark sheen that robs you of your natural complexion in the summer months requires much more than just that.

 Screen off

 There are a number of misconceptions with regard to tan, says beauty expert Gouri Bose of Shakamvari, a city beauty salon. 

 Contrary to popular belief, being out in the sun is not the only way to get a tan. You might get one even if you dont venture out much. The skin is not totally safe from ultraviolet rays even on a cloudy day.

 As for fighting tan, its not enough to apply a sunscreen lotion on the face and arms moments before leaving the house, says Gouri. 

 The sunscreen has to be applied at least 45 minutes before stepping out in the sun. This way the skin will have enough time to absorb the lotion before its faced with the ultraviolet rays, she explains. 

 so, it doesnt help to apply sunscreen on wet skin just after a bath since the water dilutes the creams intensity. 

 The effect of a sunscreen lotion lasts for just about an hour. So repeat applications are mandatory to protect the skin, stresses Gouri.

 For those out on work for the day, a pack of wet tissues and a sunscreen lotion should be the staple contents of the handbag. 

 Water woes

 A swim in your neighbourhood pool might be a great way of cooling off in the sweltering summer months, but the damages to the skin are severe. Sunrays, coupled with chlorine, give you an inevitable tan that no sunscreen lotion can keep away.

 Ultraviolet rays travel up below the surface of the water. So, the parts of the body exposed during swimming get badly affected, observes the beauty expert. 

 So, an anti-chlorine cream is a must if you want to keep the tan away. The anti-chlorine cream has to be oil-based so that the water doesnt wash it away, she adds. 

 Beautician Rita Mohan of Rapunzel recommends the Alpha Hydoxin Acid (AHA) products available at salons to get rid of tan acquired as a result of swimming.

 Treatment tip

 Exfoliation of the dead and affected tissues helps remove tan, explains Ruby Biswas of Saajo. 

 Indeed, beauty clinics across the city offer a range of facials and body treatments that can bring back the natural skin tone. 

 There are lots of products that can be used to remove tan. This includes AHA and Glycholic Acid, both of which help remove pigmentation. We also use Dead Sea mud to exfoliate the tissues, adds Ruby.

 A fairness and glow treatment available across parlours is another popular option.

 Shakamvari promises a treatment that removes up to 60 to 70 per cent tan in one sitting, and more if continued over subsequent sessions. 

 Do it yourself

 As for most beauty problems, a whole host of kitchen products can work wonders to lighten the skin. 

 Gram flour, potatoes, tomatoes and lemon juice, a whole host of ingredients usually found in the fridge can be used to remove unwanted duskiness. 

 Mashed potatoes and tomatoes can be applied separately on the skin once a day to reduce pigmentation, reveals Ruby. 

 Those with oily skin can also apply sour curd on the face and arms. This not only reduces pigmentation, it fights excessive oiliness too, adds Rita. Cucumber and lime juice applied together on the affected regions also offer satisfactory results. 

 So, even as the summer sun continues to play spoilsport, sporting a cool and clean skin might not be an impossible task.

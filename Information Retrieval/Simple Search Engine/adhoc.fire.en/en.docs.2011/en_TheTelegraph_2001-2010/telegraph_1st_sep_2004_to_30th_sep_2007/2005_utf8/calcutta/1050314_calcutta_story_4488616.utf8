 Abetment nails boyfriend

 - Girl?s kin lodge complaint, son of Bihar Assembly chief marshal arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Suraj Sinha, 25-year-old son of Bihar Assembly chief marshal Bhanu Pratap Sinha, was arrested on Sunday on the charge of abetting his 28-year-old girlfriend to commit suicide. Officers of East Jadavpur police station took him in custody after receiving a complaint from the family of the victim on Sunday.

 Anuradha Mangatri, who was an employee of a private bank, committed suicide at her South Road apartment, in the East Jadavpur police station area, on Saturday morning, leaving behind a suicide note that blamed Suraj, a software firm employee, for her to take the extreme step.

 ?Even though we have been living together for the past three years, he is having an affair with another girl. Now, I have no option left except committing suicide,? she had written.

 Police came to know that Anuradha arrived in the city five years ago and settled here after joining the bank. ?Suraj was on the night shift and returned home around 6.30 am from his office in Salt Lake?s Sector V. He was the first one to notice the body hanging from the ceiling. He took four hours to inform police about the suicide,? said an officer of East Jadavpur police station.

 Sunday?s arrest comes in the wake of the suicide note in which Anuradha referred to the other woman in Suraj?s life. ?Immediately afterwards, we informed her parents at Kalimpong and asked them to come down at the earliest. Anuradha?s father, Kul Bahadur, came on Sunday and lodged a complaint with us, blaming Suraj for his daughter?s death,? said Anjan Ganguly, inspector-in-charge of East Jadavpur police station.

 Suraj could not provide a satisfactory answer when police asked him why he took so long to inform them of the death. ?He kept saying that he had broken down on seeing her body and took some time to collect himself.?

 Police questioned S. Raman, who had let out his flat to Suraj last August. Police came to know the name of the other woman in Suraj?s life, but did not disclose it for the sake of investigation. She will be interrogated soon.

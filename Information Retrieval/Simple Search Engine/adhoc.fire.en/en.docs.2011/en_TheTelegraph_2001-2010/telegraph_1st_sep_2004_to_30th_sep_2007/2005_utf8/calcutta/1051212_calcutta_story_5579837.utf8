 With her kind of looks, you might mistake her for an aspiring model or actress. But far from being a wannabe Bollywood star, this sports talent from Chandigarh is a name synonymous with Indian golf. Name any ladies golf tournament in the country and you would, in all likelihood, find IRINA BRAR in the lead.

 GoodLife caught up with the petite beauty at the Tollygunge Club when she was in town for the gross event 44th East India Challenge Cup Golf last week.

 Age: 22 years. 

 Fact file: Irinas tryst with the sport began when, as a kid, she would accompany her golfer mother Madhu Brar to the course. My mother has always been an inspiration, she says. 

 Irina, currently a first-year masters student of psychology at the MCM DAV College in Chandigarh, balances her sporting career and academics quite well. She topped her university in the bachelors and aspires to be a sports psychiatrist in the future.

 Recent riches: This season Irina has played four tournaments and won three, including the Madras Open and the Northern India titles. 

 Her nagging wrist injury seems to pose no threat to her reputation of being a consistent and dominant figure on the fairways. The secret of the success? Apart from yoga and gymming that keeps me physically going, I take my game seriously and am always focussed. On the field I enjoy myself and try and give my best shot.

 Off course: Like any other girl of her age, Irina enjoys watching movies, listening to music, spending time with her pet dog and reading books. Abhishek Bachchan and Priety Zinta top the list of her favourite Bollywood actors. Kajol is my favourite too, and Im glad shes making a comeback, she says. 

 The Julia Roberts romantic rage Pretty Woman is her all-time favourite film. I have watched it so many times and I would keep doing so, she smiles. When it comes to music, Dire Straits, U2 and Sting top her list. 

 Style statement: Sania (Mirza) is doing very well for herself and the way shes carrying on without paying much attention to what is written about her fashion statements is commendable, feels Irina. 

 As for her own fashion statement, any outfit thats comfortable and my parents are okay with finds a place in her wardrobe. I am fond of casuals and am comfortable in shorts and capris, says the lady in all-black. 

 Pet peeve: The sports officer with Indian Oil is quite disappointed with the lack of sponsors for international golf tournaments. With cricket being a rage in India, other sports are hardly promoted. We have no dearth of talent, but we lack sponsors. My father backed me for five long years before I managed sponsors, points out Irina.

 She is all for sports stars lending their presence to ads. Theres no harm in endorsing products, but then you should do it in moderation and without losing your focus, she adds as a rider.

 Sign off: Girls in our part of the world are not that keen on sports. But then they must realise that sport in any form increases concentration, stamina and the ability to work hard. 

 Contrary to what most people think, it is in no way a deterrent to your studies and career.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lockout at cinema after worker unrest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The future of the 67-year-old Metro cinema has come under a cloud after its management declared a lockout on Sunday morning, following a workers? strike.

 ?We won?t budge from our stand unless our demands are met,? asserted Tarun Kumar Ghosh, general secretary of the Left-backed Metro Cinema Employees Union. 

 The union members have been demonstrating outside the closed hall since Saturday evening.

 The demands include revision of basic pay, permanent status to casual workers, filling up of 15 vacant posts and a hike in the annual salary increment.

 The union wants the basic pay of unskilled workers to be increased from Rs 1,800 to Rs 4,500-Rs 5,700. ?We also want the charges for extra duty hiked from Rs 12,500 to Rs 30,000,? said Ghosh.

 He added that the theatre management had agreed to consider the demands on the condition that the surplus staff would be sacked and the retirement age brought down to 58.

 Gouri Shankar Mishra, general manager of Metro Theatre Calcutta Limited, said the management was forced to declare the lockout to protect its property after the workers went on strike on Saturday. 

 ?We pay the best wages ? the same as A-grade halls. The workers have to understand that we cannot accept their demands, which are ridiculous. Cinema halls in the city are dying. In an age of cable television and pirated CDs, we don?t have many patrons left,? Mishra said.

 ?The matter has gone to the labour court and we?ve been having regular sittings with the labour commissioner. The next meeting is scheduled on March 23. I don?t understand why they decided to go on strike, instead of waiting for the meeting,? added Mishra.

 According to him, the hall incurs a loss of around Rs 15 lakh annually.

 ?We have opened three bars, which make up for the loss from the cinema hall. Our salary burden is presently Rs 20 lakh. To meet the demands of the workers, we will have to shoulder an additional burden of Rs 23 lakh annually,? Mishra said.

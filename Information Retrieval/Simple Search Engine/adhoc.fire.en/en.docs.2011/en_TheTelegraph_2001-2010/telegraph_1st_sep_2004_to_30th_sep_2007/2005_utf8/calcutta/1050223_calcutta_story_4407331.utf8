 Rough summerscape

SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

Rough, 

tortured and disturbed are the words designer Abhishek Dutta uses to describe 

his new line of clothing for the coming season. ?My spring-summer 2005 collection 

has a distressed feel,? says the designer, who retails from his studio on 7S Cornfield 

Road.

 The tortured and distressed feel, more prominent in the pret range, has been brought about by rough surfaces, faded prints, crinkled lycra and acid-washed denims. The palette, for both pret and couture collections, is very subdued, with pastels like pale pink, lilac, sea green and powder blue dominating the line. 

 Surface embellishments have been kept to a bare minimum 

and the stress is more on textures and weaves. ?I have tried out a lot of new 

effects this time, the most prominent being the knotting technique. Ribbits, kantha 

stitch and crochet have also been used for texture effect,? says Dutta.

 The collection comprises tops, jackets and skirts 

of various shapes and lengths. ?I have done only short and knee-length skirts 

this time as long lengths are no longer in fashion. Asymmetrical hemlines and 

layering have been used widely here,? explains the designer.

The couture line on the other hand is a shade richer 

than the pret one, but muted shades and rough textures link the two. 

 Saris with innovative anchals ? semi-circular, asymmetrical and pre-pleated ? and lehngas in various cuts ? fish-tail, asymmetrical and layered ? define the line. The saris and lehngas have been teamed with a variety of corsets.

 The young designer has also launched a wacky men?s wear line. This comprises lounge and party shirts, tops and jackets in stretched cotton, denim, linen and georgette. 

 Accessory options include stylish handbags and caps. While the pret line is priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 5,000, the couture collection starts from Rs 15,000 upwards.

 Hollywood high

 Kala, Music amp; Play (KMP), one of the leading US-based event production and management companies is organising the 2nd International Indo-Bangladesh Kala Music Award (IIBKMA) in a much bigger way this year. 

 The nominations for the ceremony, to be held in Hollywood no less, on April 23, were announced at a press conference at The Park on Monday evening. 

 ?Bangla commercial cinema is going through a transition. Indian commercial movies are a rage in the west and our effort is towards promoting Bangla commercial cinema to get similar recognition there,? said Debu Ghosh, chief executive officer, KMP.

 While the Ravi Ojha-directed Aabar Aashbo Phire and Sandip Ray?s Bombaiyer Bombetey have been nominated for the Best Movie category, the Best Director award could go to Haranath Chakraborty for Gandakaal or Sandip Ray. 

 The Best Actor award contenders are Prosenjit for Gandakaal and Sabyasachi Chakraborty for Bombaiyer Bombetey. Their female counterparts are Koel Mallick for Shudhu Tumi and Chandrayee Ghosh for Mahul Banir Sereng. The latter is also the film nominated for the Best Parallel Movie category along with Devipaksha. 

 There will be a separate ceremony to felicitate the champions in telefilms, television serials and music category to be held the next day at San Francisco. Nominations for the Best Telefilm award include Rupkathar Jiban and Achchhedyo. The Best TV Serial award would go to Kon Se Aalor Swapno Niye or Tithir Otithi. Sabyasachi Chakrabarty, Koushik Sen, Swastika Mukhopadhya, Rupa Ganguly, Parambrata, Sujon Mukherjee, Indrani Halder and Sreelekha Mitra are the small-screen actors and actresses contending for the limelight. 

 Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar and Hemanta Mukherjee are to be awarded lifetime achievement awards.

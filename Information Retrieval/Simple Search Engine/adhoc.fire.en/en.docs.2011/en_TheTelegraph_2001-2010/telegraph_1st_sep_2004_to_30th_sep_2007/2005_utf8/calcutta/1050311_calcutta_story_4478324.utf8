 - Rs 17-crore proposal to set up interactive transport portal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Queues to pay road tax or apply for a driving licence may soon become history. 

 Buoyed by the World Bank?s promise to fund e-governance, the transport department has come up with a Rs 17-crore proposal to improve G2C (government to citizen) connectivity.

 ?The idea is to have a wide area networking with web connectivity so that all offices have access to each other?s records, apart from a common centralised database,? a transport department official explained on Thursday. 

 The proposal calls for the setting up of an interactive transport portal, from where people can access data.

 The department can benefit by computerising the issue of registration certificates, permits and fitness certificates, collection of road tax and renewal of driving licences. According to officials, under a computerised system:

 4Vehicle records and licences can be accessed at the click of a mouse

 4Tax records can be accessed and the status and time of payment can be determined

 4Forms can be downloaded and uploaded

 4Addresses can be changed and vehicle ownership transferred 

 4Information on status of permits and licenses can be obtained.

 ?The finance department can also directly check the hypothecation details of vehicles from the transport portal,? an official said. 

 With the upgrade of the computerised auto emission testing centres (AETCs) in the city, officials feel the new system would help them in improving enforcement of pollution norms. 

 ?The records from the AETCs on vehicles failing or clearing emission tests will be passed on to our portal. We will them be able to track down and penalise the blacklisted vehicles easily,? the official added. 

 In addition to Bengal, the Centre has shortlisted Andhra Pradesh and Punjab for launching a pilot project on e-governance.

 Last October, the public vehicles directorate launched the issue of driving licences and registration documents for vehicles in the form of smart cards. 

 PricewaterhouseCoopers has prepared the project proposal on behalf of the transport department. The department has sought nine months to implement the proposals from the time it is cleared by the World Bank.

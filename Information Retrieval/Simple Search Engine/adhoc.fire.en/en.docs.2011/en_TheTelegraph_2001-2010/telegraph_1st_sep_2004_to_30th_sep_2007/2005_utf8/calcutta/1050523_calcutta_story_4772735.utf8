 Council tips for quality teachers

 - ICSE board ensures best standards are maintained in affiliated schools

 With ICSE and ISC schools cropping up in increasing numbers in Calcutta and its adjoining areas every year, the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has drawn up a scheme to ensure that high academic standards are maintained in each and every institution within its purview.

 Come Monday, the council will launch a two-year training course for teachers in the kindergarten and primary sections of ICSE and ISC schools. The council wants the teachers to prepare students in all affiliated institutions for the ICSE and ISC curricula from an early stage.

 Sources said a dearth of efficient teachers in the primary sections of several affiliated schools, including some prominent ones, has prompted the council to start the training course. 

 ?The reason why most reputed schools in the city are affiliated to our council is that we have been able to maintain high standards for the past many decades,? said G. Arathoon, deputy secretary, east zone office of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations.

 ?More and more schools are seeking affiliation. If we are to maintain our standards, we need to ensure that each affiliated school imparts quality education to students right from the primary level,? he added.

 The number of ICSE and ISC institutions in Calcutta has risen to 200 from 67 in the early 1980s. In the present system, the primary sections of ICSE and ISC schools do not come under the council?s jurisdiction.

 ?Every in-service primary teacher should be cautious about all advanced teaching concepts as they are the ones who produce future learners,? Arathoon pointed out. Gillian Rose Mary Hart, principal, Welland Gouldsmith School, and also a member of the council, said: ?The new course has been designed in such a way that teachers will be made aware about all latest changes in the curricula.?

 The teachers will also be educated on child psychology. ?Various psychological disorders are now noticed among children. Teachers, in the modern system, double as counsellors in schools. So, every primary teacher must know the techniques to monitor the overall progress of a child,? said Arathoon.

 Many schools are showing an interest in sending their teachers for the training. Thirty of the 50 seats in the course have already been booked,? officials said. 

 ?Many of our senior teachers are very efficient. They can impart the right kind of education if they attend the training,? said Ranjan Mitter, principal, Future Foundation School. Nine teachers from his institution are joining the course.

 What is the conceptual basis of fusion music as it exists, beyond musicians from two different worlds coming together to perform? A group of city musicians, led by author Amit Chaudhuri, intends to find out with This Is Not Fusion.

 Chaudhuri, in an avatar other than that of an Indian classical singer he often appears in, Skinny Alley guitarist Amit Datta, jazz keyboardist Debabrata Mitra, bassist Mainak Nag Chowdhury and tabla-player Mayookh Bhaumik have teamed up for the project, aimed at creating ?a modulation of the existing notion of fusion?.

 The first performance, backed by British Council and Spandan, is scheduled to take place at Gyan Manch on Saturday. ?It will certainly not be a one-off thing,? assured Chaudhuri at the launch of This Is Not Fusion on Tuesday at the British Council.

 ?Fusion, as it currently exists, is a physical space where a western and an eastern musician come together and create a sound in response to each other. We are trying to go beyond that,? was Chaudhuri?s explanation.

 His experiences with both forms, Chaudhuri believes, helped him conceive and work on the project. 

 ?My blood and sweat goes into Indian classical music. But before that, while growing up in Mumbai, I listened to rock, blues and jazz and even played the guitar. At 16, I started to learn Indian classical and gave up on western music,? he said.

 Only a few years ago, he went back to listening to western music.

 It was through these explorations that Chaudhuri realised certain similarities between the ragas and western music forms. ?Malkauns is similar to some blues and jazz scales, while Bhopali has a note structure like western folk music.?

 At the Gyan Manch performance, the ensemble (Chaudhuri is strictly against the terms ?group? and ?band? because of the associations they bring with them) will perform variations of standard tunes. 

 On offer will be Summertime from George Gershwin?s classic folk opera Porgy and Bess and the traditional Auld lang syne. Eric Clapton?s equally famous guitar riff from Layla will be given a classical treatment.

 An original composition by the members is also set for a debut. ?It?s not only about the individual excellence of musicians, but an exploration of the concept which we feel is rich enough for us to keep on exploring,? Chaudhuri added.

 Work has been on for the past six months but rehearsals have really picked up pace in the past few days, with the concert drawing near. Any plans of recording an album of the compositions? ?Why not,? is the author-turned-singer?s answer.

 Missing: a combat plan

 - Dengue on epidemic brink, court sets week?s deadline

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to file reports within seven days stating the additional steps they have taken to combat the dengue outbreak.

 The division bench of Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly warned that the outbreak was ?about to become an epidemic?.

 The bench emphasised that both the CMC and the government should pay more attention to slums in the city.

 ?Go and visit affected areas with doctors, mobile medical vans and medicines. Take more precautionary measures to control the disease. Equip your hospitals for better treatment of poor patients,? the bench told the government and civic body representatives.

 The chief justice asked government pleader Rabilal Moitra what steps his government had taken to tackle the situation.

 Moitra replied: ?We have taken many steps. We are also trying to raise awareness among the people about the disease.?

 ?Where are the patients going for treatment?? Justice Sirpurkar asked.

 Moitra said: ?To hospitals...?

 When the court asked Moitra what additional arrangements the government had made to treat victims, Moitra started fumbling.

 CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh came to his rescue saying, ?We have set up many centres for blood tests. Our people are going door to door to raise awareness.?

 Also on Friday, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said if a blood sample does not test positive for malaria, the slide should be sent to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases.

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said though the death toll of 12 remained unchanged, about 607 patients have so far tested positive for dengue.

 Fifteen people on Friday tested positive at Illambazar in Birbhum. In South 24-Parganas, chief medical officer of health Pradeep Kumar Mondol said 20 people in his district had tested positive over the past few days. From Hooghly, 150 blood samples were sent to the School of Tropical Medicine for testing. 

 Justice Sirpurkar said: ?All this is done in normal situations. You will have to make extra arrangements in case the disease takes epidemic proportions.?

 Four city residents had moved a public interest litigation alleging gross negligence on the part of CMC and the state government in dealing with the outbreak of dengue.

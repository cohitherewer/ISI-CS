 New Town wait ends

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After a long wait, the government has initiated the process of handing over residential plots in New Town, Rajarhat, to individuals and cooperatives.

 Housing minister Goutam Deb said on Friday the target was to hand over all plots in Action Area I to the owners by December 2005.

 Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town, has allotted nearly 3,000 residential plots to individuals and cooperatives in Action Area I (660 hectares) through lottery. 

 It has also allotted nearly 30 acres to five private developers, who are building residential and commercial estates, along with the West Bengal Housing Board.

 While the developers have got their plots, the individuals and cooperatives, even after making the full payment, are yet to get theirs. Several buyers have written to the housing minister, expressing resentment over the delay. 

 Sensing the mood, minister Deb, also Hidco chairman, has asked officers and engineers to speed up the hand-over.

 During his meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last week, Deb said the prospective buyers would be given possession of their plots at the earliest.

 ?We share the anguish of those who are yet to get possession of the plots, despite paying the required amount. We took time so that the infrastructure projects would be ready and the owners could start construction right away. The wait, however, has ended and we are now ready to hand over the plots,? Deb said.

 New Town will be the biggest township in eastern India, spread over 3,075 hectares. 

 ?We are trying our best to develop it with the most modern technology. The underground sewer network and the water supply system need to be the best in the country. I can assure buyers that no township will be found with so many waterbodies and so much green,? the minister claimed.

 Hidco engineers and officers, Deb said, are working hard to ready Action Area II (1,050 hectares). ?I have asked the officers to clear all disputes without delay to ensure quick completion of work. Several big buyers are waiting for chunks of land there.? 

 Hidco director-general Subodh Bhattacharya said the agency had started sending letters to the buyers of plots in Action Area I. They have been asked to get their plots verified and registered.

 ?According to the rules, Hidco will make an agreement with the buyers (chief promoters in case of cooperative land) before registration. A buyer will have to pay an extra amount if his/her plot is found to be larger than what had been recorded during the allotment,? Bhattacharya added.

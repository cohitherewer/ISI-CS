 Railway stations are famous for their puri-bhaji and chai garam. But if you want to wonder on wheels, go On Track at 25B Park Street.

 The Indian and Chinese speciality restaurant has a 70-ft-long replica of a steam engine that provides the setting for a munch on the move. The restaurant spread over 3,000 sq feet has a capacity for 90 covers, with seating arrangements both inside and outside the engine.

 The outside section resembles a platform with train-related graffiti adorning the walls. The name of the train is Indo-China Express, in keeping with the cuisine it is dishing out.

 The Indian section comprises Chicken Onion Kebab, Fish Amritsari, Raragosht, Prawn Malai Curry, Lassoni Jhinga and Fish Peshawari.

 The Chinese side comprises Golden Fried Prawn, Devils Chicken, Fish Mandarin Fish in Black Beans, Sliced Lamb in Hot Garlic Sauce and Prawns in Hot Garlic Sauce.

 Price tags on each dish varies between Rs 40 and Rs 300.

 Nawabi nook

 Lucknow is the flavour and nawabi the fashion at the multi-cuisine restaurant in Stadel, with the Sham-e-Awadh food festival on till August 18, Tuesdays to Fridays.

 Awadhi food is very rich, but food-lovers today are very calorie conscious. All items have been prepared keeping this in mind, but the flavour remains the same, explains master chef Narayan Chatterjee.

 So, feast on an array of Awadhi cuisine starting with Lazeez Murgh ka Tikka (chicken cooked in cashew, white teel, ginger and curd) and Machli Mughlai Kebab before moving on to Gosht Roghini Masala (mutton cooked with cashew, cardamom, sauf, ghee, tomato puree, Kashmiri chilli paste, milk, zafran, meetha atar), Murgh Zafrani Korma and Machli Tanviri for the main course.

 The veg platter offers starters like Paneer Khusnawab Kebab, Veg Shahenshah Kebab and Mirch Ka Salan (Jaipuri green chilli cooked in cashew and onion paste), with Gobhi Ghuncha Bahar, Sabz Bahare Zafrani for the main course. 

 Pamper your tastebuds with Noor Mahal Pulao, Hyderabadi Boti Biryani, Murgh Nassi Biryani, Lachcha Kaju Paratha and Begum Badam Naan. Firni and Gulab Jamun make for the perfect sweet ending, while you can choose your lassi from Sharbat-e-Awadhi (lassi mocktails) and Nanhi Pari (lassi cocktails).

 The mocktails and cocktails conceptualised by Irfan Ahmed include alcoholic beverages like Gul-e-Gulfam (blend of hung curd, mango and peach laced with Rooh Afzaa and vodka), Zalzala (rum, gin, vodka and black curacao blended with yoghurt and black currant) and the non-alcoholic beverages on offer are Noor Jahan (a mix of lychee, mint, yoghurt and filled with lemonade) and Lal Pari (a frozen mix of strawberry and peach churned with yoghurt). The food items ranges from Rs 15 to Rs 150; the beverages come for anything between Rs 85 and Rs 250.

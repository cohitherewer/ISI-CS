 English brush-up time for teachers

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 After students, it?s now the turn of teachers to brush up their language skills.

 The Teachers? Centre at Loreto House is, for the first time, organising a spoken English course for schoolteachers in the city. 

 Open to teachers of all subjects, the course will comprise 18 sessions, spread over two months.

 Ayesha Das, programme chairman at the centre, says: ?A number of principals and parents had spoken to me about the poor standard of spoken English among teachers. I decided to start this course because if teachers speak correct English, students will pick up the same.?

 The idea, however, is not to humiliate the teachers but to overhaul the system, stresses Das. ?We are not saying that they are not good at their work. Unfortunately, they don?t have good language skills. If the latter is improved upon, they would be even better teachers,? she explains.

 The course will commence on August 2 and will be wrapped up by September-end. The classes, to be held twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday afternoons, will explore innovative ways of making teachers feel more confident of their communication skills. Exercises will include introduction rounds, discussions on various topics, extempore and paraphrasing.

 ?We will also encourage them to come up with different words to express the same idea. For instance, ?nice? is so overused that I almost hate the word,? explains programme chairman Das.

 Though pronunciation, grammar and intonation will be addressed, the basic thrust will lie on correct usage. 

 Seventy-five schools have shown interest in the course, which will have an intake capacity of 20 to 40.

 Meena Kak, principal, Ashok Hall School, says: ?If teachers don?t understand correct usage, how can children learn the right language? Some of our teachers will definitely enrol in the course, as it is ultimately for the benefit of the students.?

 St James School principal Terence Ireland pointed out: ?An upgrade is always beneficial, however good or bad you are.? 

 Das of Loreto House Teachers? Centre cites another reason why the course is required. ?For years, English was not taught at the primary level. When generations have not been taught properly, how can they be expected to teach??

 Recently, Trinity College, UK, has introduced two examinations on spoken English in the city ? Graded Examinations in Spoken English and Integrated Skills in English. 

 An official of Orient Longman Pvt Ltd, the national manager for Trinity, says: ?Some schools have adopted these examinations. Students who register for it are assessed by examiners from Trinity College and receive a certificate after completing the various grades. While the minimum age for eligibility is seven, there is no upper-age limit for students who wish to take the examinations.?

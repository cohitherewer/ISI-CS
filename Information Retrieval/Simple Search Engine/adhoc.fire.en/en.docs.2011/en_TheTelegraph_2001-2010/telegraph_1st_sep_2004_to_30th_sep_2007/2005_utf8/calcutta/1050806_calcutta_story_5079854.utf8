 Tolly tribute with melody melange

 After a string of ill-executed Suchitra Sen and Uttam Kumar tributes, Tollywood finally showed sparks of showmanship with one on Kishore Kumar. Guruke Janai Pronam, an ode to Kishore on his 76th birth anniversary turned into an annual affair by the states film fraternity, was hosted by Artistes Forum at Nazrul Mancha on Thursday evening. 

 Though an hour behind schedule, the show had a professional touch ? the event management was taken care of by Prosenjit and Arpita Chatterjees company Ideas ? and the crowds poured in, despite the sultry weather and lack of fans.

 Minus glitches, shoddy footwork and long-winded speeches, the event turned out to be a synchronised melange of music, dance, skit and felicitation.

 After Ranjit Mullick captured the spirit of the show in a few words, singer Goutam Ghosh took the stage for a Kishore number. Also in the singing line-up were Indranil Sen, Miss Jojo, Pratiek Chowdhury and Usha Uthup. The best part though was the original Kishore oldies that one got to hear as the Tollywood heroes and heroines pranced in twos and threes.

 Rimjhim and Rishi Kaushik were the first to get off, doing a Kishore and Nutan with CAT, cat mane billi; Abhishek Chatterjee, Jisshu Sengupta and Swastika Mukherjee followed with a more hilarious number, playing Kishore, Sunil Dutt and Saira Banu in mere pyari Bindu. Jisshu returned with Sayantani for Ek palake ektu dekha, and with Swastika again for Ek ladki bheegi bhagi si. Monami danced to Eena Meena Deeka, while June shimmered in a chiffon to do a Sridevi with Kante nahin kat te.

 The skit presented by actors Kanchan and Shantilal, though not very humorous, contributed by throwing in details on Kishore Kumar in between the jigs. And punctuating the song-and-dance routine was the felicitation round for veterans Gita Dey, Dilip Ray, Haradhan Bandyopadhyay and Lily Chakraborty. 

 In the second half, which stocked up the best, Jeet and Koel Mullick popped in for a couple of holi numbers ? from Holi ke din to Jai jai shiv shankar, even as the crowd cheered for more. 

 Prosenjit turned up, not for a jig, but to lend his voice to a couple of Kishore tracks, like Nayana sharashi and Amar naam Antony. A cardboard train was dragged in for a trip down memory lane as he sang Mere swapno ki rani. 

 Kumar Sanu came calling from Mumbai to pay his tribute to the city and his idol through a bouquet of songs ? from Raatkali ek khwab to Pal pal dil ke paas. 

 Please dont request me for songs. Let me sing what I want today for my guru, Sanu pleaded with his fans.

 The icing on the cake was, of course, Tollywoods hero number one, Prosenjit, joining hands with strong contender Jeet, singing Yeh dosti hum nahin todenge.

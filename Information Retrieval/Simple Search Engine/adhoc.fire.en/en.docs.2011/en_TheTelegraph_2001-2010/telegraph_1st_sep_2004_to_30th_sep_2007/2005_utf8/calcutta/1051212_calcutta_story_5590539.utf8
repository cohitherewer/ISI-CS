 Big is bountiful

 He?s managed to do what the Coppolas and Kubricks couldn?t ? make a trilogy that has become better with every part. And now Peter Jackson is realising his childhood dream. In the middle of the Diwali extravaganza from Bollywood, King Kong is a must-watch. It releases this Friday at a plex or a single screen near you.

 Early in the highly anticipated remake of the 1933 film, the spirited film-maker Carl Denham, played by Jack Black, tells studio executives: ?I?m going to make the most spectacular film you have ever seen.?

 So, is that what Jackson himself has done? He has spent $207 million on bringing the classic story of a giant gorilla to the screen, making this the sixth most expensive film in Hollywood history.

 Only 10 million dollars, in today?s money, was spent on the original by Merian Cooper in 1933, according to the New York-based Forbes magazine. The most expensive ever was the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton-starrer Cleopatra, followed by James Cameron?s Titanic and Kevin Costner?s 1999 dud Waterworld.

 Jackson has wanted to remake the 1933 original ever since he was 12 years old, and in 1997 he spent six months working on a version for Universal until executives pulled the plug. Then came the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and with it a stack of Oscars, whereupon the studio suddenly resurrected the King Kong project for him.

 The film was shot entirely in New Zealand, at Jackson?s own Wellington studios and on a nearby plot of land, where his team constructed six blocks of New York streets, only up to the buildings? first floors. Everything else, including the Empire State Building, was added later by computer. Jackson chose to set his story, like the original, in 1933, and he has realistically recreated New York?s grimy streets, the breadlines, the soup kitchens and the Depression-era atmosphere of desperation.

 He cast Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, the starlet originally played by Fay Wray, and the British-born actress demonstrates a fine ability to scream while managing to turn in a mostly convincing performance that she emoted almost entirely in front of a blue screen.

 Black is an energetic and wily Carl Denham, while Adrien Brody plays Jack Driscoll, who in the original is a tough sailor but has been rewritten by Jackson as a gentle playwright.

 King Kong has always been lucky at the box-office. In its first weekend in 1933, the film took $90,000, the biggest opening of its era. It went on to generate $1.7 million ? more than double its cost. Even the derided 1976 remake earned $80 million worldwide, almost three times the cost of making the film. (Agencies)

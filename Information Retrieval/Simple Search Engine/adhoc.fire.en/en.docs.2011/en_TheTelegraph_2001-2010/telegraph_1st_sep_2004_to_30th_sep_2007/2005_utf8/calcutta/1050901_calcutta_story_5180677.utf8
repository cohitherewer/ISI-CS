 Mayor alert on dengue

 - High court moved over govt failure to contain outbreak

 OUR BUREAU

 The dengue outbreak has not been contained, with the toll mounting to 11. In fact, it?s threatening to go out of hand, prompting mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya to press the panic button on Wednesday.

 ?Dengue is yet to turn into an epidemic, but the situation is bad, really bad? It will spin out of control if remedial measures are not taken immediately,? the mayor said. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has asked officials to work on a war footing to tackle the crisis.

 A few hours after the mayor?s statement, a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the high court against the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government for its ?failure? to arrest the spread of dengue. 

 Later in the day, a city hospital was accused of ?insensitivity? after it discharged a nine-year-old girl suffering from the disease. 

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee, overseeing crisis management, said around 300 people had tested positive for dengue in Calcutta and the districts. 

 ?Hospitals and clinics have been asked to inform us promptly about possible dengue cases. They will be penalised if they fail to do so,? Chatterjee said.

 The government, meanwhile, denied reports about the outbreak of an ?unknown fever?. Chatterjee asserted: ?There is nothing unknown. We are facing cases of malaria, dengue and influenza in various pockets. Our virologists and experts from other healthcare agencies have confirmed this.?

 The PIL against the government, moved by lawyers Idris Ali and Sreemoyee Mitra, will be heard by the division bench of Chief Justice V.K. Sirpurkar and Justice Ashok Ganguly on Friday.

 The petitioners demanded that the public be told about the exact number of deaths caused by dengue; adequate infrastructure, including emergency wards and testing gadgets, be set up in hospitals; open drains be covered and garbage dumping banned in the city and its suburbs; and families of victims be paid compensation.

 They have also asked for a five-member committee, to be appointed by the government, to probe the outbreak.

 The authorities at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital came in for criticism after they released nine-year-old Priyanka Pramanik, who was admitted to the paediatric ward a week ago with dengue. 

 ?The attending doctors said Priyanka could be taken back home and released her. But we are still very scared,? said Jayanta Deb, a neighbour of the Pramaniks.

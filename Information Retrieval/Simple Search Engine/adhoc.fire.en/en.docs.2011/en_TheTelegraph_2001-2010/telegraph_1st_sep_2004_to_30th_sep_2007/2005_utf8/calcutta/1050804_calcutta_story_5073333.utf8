The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Their third tryst in 32 years

 Back on screen with Dimple Kapadia after Bobby and Saagar, RISHI KAPOOR tells Pratim D. Gupta about their special equation and the changing face of Bollywood

 Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia play a senior couple in love in the new Hriday Shetty film

 Everyone?s again talking about the Rishi-Dimple pair. What do you think is so special about the two of you?

 Oh my God! I don?t know how to answer that. The truth of the matter is that Dimple and I have done just three films in 32 years. Now that?s something no star couple has done anywhere in the world, not just in Indian cinema. We have been able to come together in different stages of our lives ? first as teenagers (Bobby), then as adults (Saagar) and now, as senior adults (laughs)? Personally, it?s a great high for me working with Dimple again. It?s an equation you really can?t define.

 How different was it sharing the frame with her from the Bobby days?

 We have all matured. Perhaps, me a little more since she has been on and off films. But we got immediately connected on the sets of Pyaar Mein Twist. It was the same feeling as it was in Bobby or Saagar. Being professionals, we didn?t take much time to get things going. I found it very comfortable working with her.

 Pyaar Mein Twist is really different?

 I find the film quite cute. It is about companionship. It tells you that love is not only about youth and for the youth. Love is also not only about sex. I am playing my age in the film. In that way it?s truly different (laughs). I have kids and so has Dimple. She has a daughter (Soha Ali Khan). But we are in love and we want to get married. What?s more, Dimple?s would-be son-in-law (Sameer Dattani) wants the relationship to work. That?s the USP of the film.

 Do you think Bollywood is truly changing?

 I definitely feel Bollywood is maturing. Hindi films have always been about dancing around trees, something that I did all my life wearing fancy, coloured clothes. But now with the coming of cineplexes, there is a different kind of audience. They are ready to pay Rs 120-150 for a ticket and have completely different sensibilities than say an auto rickshawwallah. So you have films like Baghban that is being accepted. It?s no longer only about youth films. 

 People want to see stories, characters and their problems. All kinds of cinema will survive, each having its own audience. In fact, the producers of Pyaar Mein Twist did some research work on this theme before starting the film. Now, the budgets also have become different. As I said, you have something for everyone. Like you get all kinds of clothes in the market ? cotton, rayon, silk, khadi? sabke liye grahak hai.

 Then why aren?t you doing that many films?

 No one writes films for me. Here in Bollywood once you get matured you are forgotten. In the West, when an actor hits 50, he gets the best roles and has the best time of his life. 

 It?s not that I am not doing films at all. I just did Hum Tum some time back. I have also done a spoken English film called Don?t Stop Dreaming. I am starting another one next week called Sambar Salsa. Then, I am slated to do the next Yash Raj film directed by Kunal Kohli with Aamir (Khan) and Kajol. See, if there are roles for me, I?ll definitely do them. I?m an actor... it?s my job.

 And what plans do you have with your son?

 We?ll be launching him? rather he will be launching himself some time next year. He has not only been trained as an actor but also knows the craft of film-making.

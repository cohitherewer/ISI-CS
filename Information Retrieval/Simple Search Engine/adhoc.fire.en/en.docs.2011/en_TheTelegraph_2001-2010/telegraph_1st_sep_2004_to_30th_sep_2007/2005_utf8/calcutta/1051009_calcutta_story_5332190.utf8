 The basis of a brand

 How a healthy appetite on a train journey back from Santiniketan can serve up a key marketing truth

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Last week, I was taking the Santiniketan Express to get back to Calcutta. It departs from Bolpur a little after 1 pm, so your lunch has to be early or your breakfast late. But as is usual with me, I started feeling hungry from the moment I set my foot inside the train compartment. A train journey has this peculiar effect on many like me. It acts as an appetiser. I feel like eating something at every station the train stops and buy some food from every hawker who passes through my compartment.

 That day there were not too many choices. At Bolpur station, I had jhalmuri and lemon tea. There was nothing else on offer for the next hour. A little after the train left Burdwan station, to my utter delight I saw an old man carrying a large aluminium container on his head, enter the compartment. The dekchi was covered with shaal leaves ? a failsafe sign that there was food inside. In fact I recognised the old man from my previous trip some years back. He sells huge samosas and khasta kochuris. My mouth was salivating already. 

 To my complete surprise, the man left the container at the head of the compartment and went out. A few seconds later, a younger man came and started taking orders for the samosas and kochuris. Like an airhostess does, he then started delivering the ordered food to each seat. He collected the money on his third trip down the aisle a little later. The younger man was unmistakably the son. The father, however, had chosen to do the task that was physically the more demanding.

 I thought to myself that the man had visibly aged since I last saw him. Yet, he chose the heaviest workload. He had carried the container full of fried foodstuff on his head into the compartment and right through it. He could have easily asked his son to do it. I kept wondering what stopped him from doing so. The father did not come back to carry the container after the selling was over. The son did the chore. That is when the penny dropped.

 The father was the brand, or more accurately the brand mnemonic. He was there merely to assure the customer that it is the same samosa and kochuri that is being sold. The taste and quality assurance came from him as a person. The train obviously has a lot of repeat travellers who are continuous customers. He therefore felt the need for a brand assurance before the pack change happened from the father to the son. He was convinced of this and thus chose to communicate in the strongest possible manner ? by entering the stage himself carrying his ware. Brilliant advertising, painstakingly executed.

 There is an obvious moral of the story. Each brand worth its salt makes a promise to its consumers. The crucial issue is that the promise is often visually delivered through an aspect of the brand personality (the pack, the name or even a jingle). It is this key element of the brand that needs nurture. Any change demands careful communication of continuity. For, that face needs to be presented to the consumer every time, always.

 To the old man, the size of the samosa or the accompanying sauce, the kochuri or its taste, was not enough. He thought his own persona was the best reassurance. That is why he took the trouble of carrying that huge load of the aluminium container on his head.

 In these days of umbrella brands and sub brands, corporate branding and brand variants, often the brand essence is getting lost. No one is carrying the load anymore.

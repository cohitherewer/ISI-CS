 Arson whiff in bank debris

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A hint of sabotage hung over the charred remains of Punjab National Bank?s foreign exchange division, on Brabourne Road. Forensic experts could not ascertain the cause of the Tuesday night fire, but pointed at possible sabotage after investigations.

 ?We have not established the cause of the fire and the point of origin yet, but we are not ruling out sabotage,? a forensic expert said after a team spent time on Wednesday on the first floor of the bank that had been gutted.

 ?We have collected samples of evidence that will be tested in our laboratory to find out if this was an accidental fire or a case of sabotage or arson,? the expert added.

 The team had entered the gutted area on Wednesday morning and carried out investigations till around 4.30 pm.

 Police, however, differed with the forensic experts on the cause of the fire. 

 ?The fire seems to have originated in the foreign exchange section itself, which is like a huge hall. It was probably caused by an electrical short-circuit,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Punjab National Bank?s foreign exchange section on Wednesday afternoon remained without electricity and with twisted furniture and fans, blackened walls and a strong smell of smoke in the air.

 Bank officials claimed that the losses had been minimal. 

 ?There has not been any substantial loss. Only some old records have been destroyed by the flames,? said G. S. Bindra, chief manager. 

 ?The 5,000-plus sq ft space was used for risk management in foreign exchange fluctuations and the selling and buying of foreign currency. Our current records were all maintained on the computers and stored in floppy discs, which are safe,? he added.

 According to a bank official, the local area network (LAN) server used by the foreign exchange section had not been affected and the software had been spared.

 ?We will probably have to shift our operations to one of our sister branches for a while. Several of our senior officers visited our branch today and I am sure alternatives are being discussed,? the official said.

 The ground-floor branch of the bank opened at 3.30 pm on Wednesday, for about half an hour, though no transactions were conducted. 

 ?We are informing our clients that we will be functioning normally from Thursday,? an official said.

 Despite the presence of a plethora of seasoned performers like Victor Banerjee, Lilette Dubey, Juhi Chawla and Sanjay Suri, My Brother? Nikhil belongs to Purab Kohli, the actor formerly known as VJ Purab.

 Purab has just become the icing on a cake being baked for some time now, thanks to a bunch of people who have gone beyond the usual staple of talking music and talking a lot. The nation?s most-loved video jockeys have been able to come out of their space below the logos of the music channels and shake off the VJ tag to venture into an all-new world ? everywhere from the silver screen to the music console.

 Most veejays, from Purab to Gaurav to Ranvir to Shruti to Malaika to Kamal to Sophiya, have chosen to don the grease paint and face the arclights. And they have been picked by the biggest of names in the world of films ? Ketan Mehta, Ram Gopal Varma, Mani Ratnam? ?At the end of the day it is about performing,? says Gaurav. ?Radio, television, theatre, events or films ? they all come under the same umbrella. It is about tapping different aspects of the same art form. Any person is capable of going beyond his or her field. It?s all about moulding yourself and about playing characters.?

 After debuting in the Ram Gopal Varma production Darna Mana Hai and appearing recently in Manu Rewal?s Chai Pani Etc, Gaurav is currently shooting for a new romantic comedy Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana opposite Kim Sharma and also appearing on the Great Indian Comedy Show on STAR One.

 Purab, of course, is playing the lead in his home production Kaun Ho Sakta Hai and then opposite Sandhya Mridul in the offbeat 13th Floor, directed by former VJ Luke Kenny.

 Peeya Rai Choudhury, who had her own request show on Channel [V], has already made a mark in films like Darna Mana Hai, Vastu Shastra and Bride amp; Prejudice.

 Tough man Yudi (Yudhishtir cut short) is slated to make his debut in an action flick named Lagi Shart while Ranvir is going to star in actor-director Rajat Kapoor?s second film after Raghu Romeo alongside Konkona Sen Sharma and Koel Purie.

 Even as Malaika continues to give fashion tips on the small screen and shake her booty with Shah Rukh Khan on the big screen, sister Amrita Arora, who too started out as a veejay, has been bagging lead roles aplenty. ?I know I cannot do away with the quintessential girl-next-door image of mine acquired after my stint on television. But I am trying to do different kinds of roles and explore myself as an actress,? says Amrita.

Nikhil Chinappa: Mixing magic

 While celluloid has ruled the roost as far as veejays go, Nikhil Chinappa has gone on to extend his love for music to a new profession. From VJ Nikhil to DJ Nikhil, it has been a whole lot of scratching and skipping for the man with a wicked sense of humour. ?I didn?t chase this new work area. Neither did I plan it. It happened. And there?s going to be a whole lot of music in whatever I do ahead in my life,? says Nikhil.

 After mixing the Vishal-Shekhar tracks into slow and fast versions for Sanjay Gupta?s road flick Musafir, Nikhil is on to bigger assignments. ?I am currently working on an international project which I can only reveal in the coming days,? he adds.

 Nikhil admits that being a VJ does help to make it big in the world of showbiz. ?It gives you the platform to move forward. As the song goes, Life?s a journey, not a destination. So being a veejay was just part of the journey for all of us and we have now moved on to acting, singing or mixing...?

Shruti Seth: Small is big

 Hopping over to other channels but in different avatars is another popular option for the video jockeys. While Cyrus Sahukar has taken on the role of an anchor in a business reality show, Mini Mathur successfully led from the front in Indian Idol and Shruti Seth has continued to be the face of the hit comedy show Shararat.

 ?Veejaying is a very niche medium,? says Shruti. ?The number of people watching music televisions is limited. But by acting in serials, one can reach out to so many more people. You can grow a lot more and can open up to a lot of new avenues.?

 ?There is always the fear of getting typecast as a VJ,? says Purab. ?It?s the image that the channels portray of a VJ that makes life difficult for us off the camera. The idea is to come out of that image.?

 Gaurav agrees. ?Too much is made out of this typecasting. At the end of the day a VJ can make it big in some other sphere only if he is talented enough to do so. The creativity will come out at some point of time, in some form.?

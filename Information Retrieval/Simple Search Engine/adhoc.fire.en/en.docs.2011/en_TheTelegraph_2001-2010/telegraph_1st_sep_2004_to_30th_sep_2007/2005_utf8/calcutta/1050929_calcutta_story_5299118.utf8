 Stalled by the rush: Santosh Mitra Square, one of the parks maintained by the Corporation where a puja is held 

 Apropos the report ?Street kids are HIV bridge population?, September 5, it is shocking to know that a large number of streetchildren in Calcutta are victims of drug abuse and AIDS. 

 The admission by Subhasish Guha, a professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, that hardly any of these HIV-affected streetchildren come for anti-retroviral therapy even when it is offered free further underscores the failure of the state government in reaching out to these hapless kids. The abysmal status of healthcare in Bengal is the result of decades of incompetence and corruption. 

 The high rate of HIV spread among truck drivers and migrant labourers is a known reason of AIDS transmission across the world. HIV infection of children primarily occurs during the peri-natal (before, during and soon after the birth) period through contamination from infected mothers. That children in Calcutta are being infected through sexual and drug abuse will be a new entry in the annals of HIV research. 

 The sexual exploitation of the streetchildren, as observed by Suresh Kumar, director of the state HIV/AIDS prevention and control society, is not only immoral but also illegal. Why isn?t the government being able to take steps against the perpetrators of such crimes when its own study has found evidence of rampant sexual exploitation of streetchildren? 

 Children are the future of a country. They deserve to be protected and raised in a safe environment. It is an ignominy for any city to have thousands of streetchildren. But it is shameful for the entire nation when these streetchildren are sexually abused and become victims of a deadly disease like AIDS. 

 Nobody, except the government, is responsible for the horrendous state of affairs. It is ironic to find the Bengal chief minister and health minister boasting about the healthcare system when children on the streets of Calcutta are falling prey to HIV in large numbers.

 Apropos the report ?Mayor soft on park puja stalls?, September 5, Durga puja is the biggest of the Bengali festivals and therefore, the rules for it might be relaxed a little. However, it must be taken into consideration that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had spent a huge amount of taxpayers? money to beautify the parks. The Puja will come and pass by, but who will pay to restore these parks to their pre-Puja state. Unless the mayor intends to do the job with his own money, how can he allow the stalls to damage the parks? 

 Subrata Mitra,

 Address not given. 

 Relaxation of rules for community Pujas in CMC parks will provide relief to the organisers. The stalls put up in the parks pay for a good percentage of the Puja budget. The civic body needs to utilise a percentage of this money to repair the damages done to the parks. It should not entrust the responsibility to the puja organisers. The CMC should not also allow cutting and trimming of trees in the parks without special permission. Such permissions should be granted only in rare cases. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala.

 My congratulations to the members of the Bandhab Sammilani Puja committee (Goddess grants lease of life to art form, September 1). It was a wonderful idea to adorn their pandal and idol with nakshikantha. In the process, they have breathed new life into a dying art form. 

 Several puja committees decorate their pandal with earthen pots, cane and bamboo, kantha stitch and flowers. I would request the officials of the state department for small industries to provide assistance to these Pujas. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the report ?Lessons learnt from failure?, September 1, it is good to learn that a few reputed city schools are helping students to learn from failure. Their example should be followed by other Calcutta schools. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 ?Rumour diverts mayor?, September 8, was the funniest incident of the year. How could the civic officials, police officers and local people be fooled so easily? 

 A hawker was perhaps the one to start the rumour. He said the road was perfectly all right the night before but developed a crater next morning. Police officers, shop owners and hundreds of local residents believed his story that there was a dangerous cave-in, even though there was a pile of soil right next to the hole. 

 Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road. 

 Apropos the report ?Cricket tips from captain?, September 6, it is great news for the budding cricketers of Calcutta that Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly is starting a cricket academy in the city. We can surely hope that this academy will produce not only future Team India players, but also all-time greats. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake.

 ?The ?D? Company?, September 7, was an expos? of the government and civic apathy that resulted in the dengue outbreak in Calcutta. The report, quite deservedly, alludes to similarities between the Mumbai gangsters and the ministers and councillors of Bengal. 

 Surajit Das,

 Salt Lake.

 Apropos the report ?Booster dose for bridge, 62?, September 5, months after a vessel?s mast rammed against the belly of the Howrah bridge, it is still not clear what measures have been taken to safeguard the heritage structure. The fact that the bridge?s custodian, Calcutta Port Trust, could not pre-empt the accident, shows it in poor light. Their recent attempt is, however, heartening. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 The report ?Cop caution on star talk?, September 17, alleges that SitiCable is in talks with Manthan to buy out Manthan, and that, ?the offer for Manthan is reportedly Rs 11.36 crore without the liabilities. The takeover is likely to take place in the next financial year?. It appears that some claims/statements have been made for our organisation which we respectfully state are not only untrue, but are utterly false. 

 Sib Sankar Chatterjee, 

 director, Manthan Broadband Services.

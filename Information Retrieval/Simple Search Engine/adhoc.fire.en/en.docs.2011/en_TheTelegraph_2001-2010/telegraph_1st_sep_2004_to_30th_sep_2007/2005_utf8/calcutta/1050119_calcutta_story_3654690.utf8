Check out the Chi quotient

More and more workplaces are getting their 

Feng Shui facts right to tackle everything from employee relations to sales graphs, 

says Zeeshan Jawed

Have you been facing stiff competition from a colleague 

or ended up being your boss?s pet scapegoat? Are the sagging sales troubling you 

or thefts in office giving you sleepless nights?

If you find yourself at a crossroad with any of the 

above problems, your office Feng Shui, say experts, could be worth taking a closer 

look at. Going by the Feng Shui, if Chi (positive energy) is blocked, policy making, 

execution, cash inflow and relationship between employer and employee are bound 

to suffer.

?In a corporate environment, poor Feng Shui can result 

in miscommunication between managers and employees, conflicts among team members, 

and lack of support for key projects. So, ensure that the office is located right 

and consult a Feng Shui expert for advice,? says Goodlife columnist Pinky 

Kapoor.

Colour code

According to Feng Shui, colours play a big role in 

day-to-day proceedings. ?If you are in the right colour on the right day, things 

are sure to go your way. Right colours are determined by the element of the person 

which changes on a yearly basis,? says Feng Shui consultant Sweety Arora.

Colourful corners and ceilings sure seem to suit the 

employees of Rediffusion DYR on Darga Road (pictures by Aranya Sen) where the 

Feng Shui was done by Mumbai-based Nusli Dabar. 

?This office was built on the lines of other Rediffusion 

DYR offices all over the country that are based on the theme of Feng Shui. We 

moved into this office in February 2004 and since then the business has been tremendous,? 

says vice-president Amitava Sinha.

There?s no escaping the colours as you enter the office. 

The ceiling of the entire passage is coloured golden. The golden streak ends at 

the south-west corner where the commercial head of the branch sits. A Shri Yantra 

hangs on the wall where the creative team brainstorms and comes up with innovative 

ideas.

The conference room, where the policies are usually 

formulated, has a patch of lavender. And there is a world map beside the patch 

that ensures that the company travels far and wide on its path to success.

Right track

For Malini Bhagat, headmistress of Mahadevi Birla 

Girls High School, Feng Shui started off as a hobby. But she first decided to 

try it out personally. ?I thought experimenting on myself was the best way to 

know if Feng Shui actually works. And I am glad to say that it has worked wonders 

for me,? she says.

Bhagat realised how she had been sitting in the wrong 

direction, with her back towards the west. The seating arrangement was immediately 

changed and she has been facing westwards ever since.

Similarly, she had to get rid of two out of three 

potted plants in her room. A plant that had no thorns replaced the third one. 

This, apparently, ensured a smooth flow of events in her office. A dragon tortoise 

came into her room to ensure there was no negative energy around her. And a picture 

of Eiffel Tower behind her ensured a high morale.

As far as the colour code goes, the room went from 

green to sandalwood to provide a sense of peace to the headmistress. ?I am a metal 

person, so I needed a metallic colour to provide me with internal peace,? says 

Bhagat. 

Business boom

It is faith in Feng Shui that prompted Gaurav Kapoor 

to introduce the science in his Bombay Dyeing showroom on Lindsay Street. 

?It is time-tested and has given good results. Moreover, 

it adds to the d?cor and the customers also like it,? says Kapoor. The entry point 

is in the south-east and a Ganesha image stands facing the cash corner in the 

south-west. 

The cash drawer faces north because that is the business 

corner. The stairs that lead to the first floor are far away from the entry point 

so that the positive energy does not flow out.

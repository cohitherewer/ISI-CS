The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buyer byte: Any time is mall time

 - Shopping turns desire-driven, rather than season-specific

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Puja spirit or party mood, travel plans or fresh fashion flavours? What drives the city apparel-shopper? Well, every occasion, any excuse and almost all-year round.

 With just four days to go for Diwali, the malls and major stores hardly reflect the rush expected at this time of the year. The reason is now clear to the big-format retail players ? festive footfall is fading steadily (with the exception of X-Mas) as the shopping cycle splits into multiple peaks.

 ?There is a steady flow of shoppers to the mall all through the year, and people don?t wait for a Puja or Diwali any longer, quot; feels City Centre CEO Vineet Verma.

 There is no denying the impact of the Pujas on the purchase pie ? especially in the less-organised sector ? but any-time-is-shopping-time means that the only dry patch for the retail racks is, perhaps, the wet season.

 ?Shopping is more desire-driven than season-specific now, at least in the malls. People buy whenever there?s a need, or if something catches their fancy. The purchase is not kept pending,? says Lalit Marda, head of the Marda Group, with retail interest in major brands like Levi?s, Adidas and Louis Philippe.

 At Forum, curiously lazy in the festive countdown, retailers are reconciled to the lukewarm response. ?Yes, walk-ins are 50 per cent less compared with the same period last year and sales are down 33 to 40 per cent. But one must keep in mind the pattern change that has happened over the years,? says Madhusudan Binani, franchisee of brands like Benetton and Satya Paul, with outlets in both Forum and City Centre.

 Stores housing premium brands have been seeing a staggered footfall flow. Summer holidays are big, but the Christmas-New Year party season sees the highest peak. Retail reckoner: Levi?s Forum outlet did Rs 15.61 lakh last December, significantly higher than the annual mean.

 The fast-changing fashion trends also constitute a trigger for shopping, at least with the younger generation desperate to stay in step with style. So, the launch of new-season merchandise by international brands invariably spells sales peaks, whether autumn-winter or spring-summer.

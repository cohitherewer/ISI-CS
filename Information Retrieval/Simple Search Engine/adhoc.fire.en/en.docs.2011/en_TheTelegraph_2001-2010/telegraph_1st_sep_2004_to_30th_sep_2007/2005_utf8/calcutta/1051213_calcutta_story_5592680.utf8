 Funds flow for multi-use

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Monday received foreign direct investment proposals of more than Rs 2,500 crore to set up a biotechnology park, a film city and beautify the Hooghly riverbank.

 The proposal, jointly prepared by Europe Israel Group and Laxmi Realtors, was submitted to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during the day.

 ?An initial proposal has been submitted, which includes investments in biotechnology, waterfront development and establishment of a film city,? stated a spokesman for Laxmi Realtors.

 He added that the exact amount of investment would be finalised at a later stage. 

 On November 28, a joint delegation of Laxmi Realtors, headed by NRI Indrajit De, and Israel-based Europe Israel Group, headed by Moti Zisser, met finance minister Asim Dasgupta to discuss the possibility of investment in the state. ?The proposal is based on the discussion,? the spokesperson said.

 The groups have proposed to set up manufacturing units for high-end medical equipment used in stem cell research and nutraceuticals. 

 The equipment includes exablate units, which uses magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound. This technology involves two components ? the MRI machine and added platforms for surgical therapy.

 The groups are planning an initial investment of $200 million for setting up the manufacturing unit. About 250 to 300 people, of varied background and skillset, are likely to be employed at the unit. 

 ?We can build a biotech park or set up a biotech space. It is for the government to decide,? the spokesperson said.

 For the restoration of the riverbank, the groups have proposed to develop a children?s play area, a park, educational and entertainment zones for kids, shopping malls, multiplexes, restaurants and an open-air theatre. A part of the project will be devoted to hotels, auditoriums, leisureplexes and watersport facilities. 

 The film city proposal envisages a cinema and theatre district of international standard to complement the cultural and artistic characteristics of the people of Bengal.

 It will have state-of-the-art film production facilities, air-conditioned indoor studios, permanent film sets (indoor and outdoor), film and video shooting floors, post-production facilities, film and drama institutes, film archiving and restoration complexes, a museum and indoor and outdoor arenas for theatre.

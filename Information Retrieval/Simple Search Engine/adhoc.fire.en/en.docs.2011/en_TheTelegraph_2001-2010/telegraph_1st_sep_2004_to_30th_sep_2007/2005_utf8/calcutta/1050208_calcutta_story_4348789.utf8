The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spy eye keeps the law at station

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Get a spycam, cut down crime. In the year since 15 surveillance cameras were installed in Howrah station, the railway authorities have detected 4,500-odd cases of touts selling tickets to passengers, eve-teasing and other crimes inside the station complex. 

 Buoyed by the success rate, Eastern Railway plans to instal similar cameras in all major stations, including Sealdah.

 The authorities claimed the cameras, which operate like those at Calcutta airport and the Metro Railway stations, have made things smoother for the passengers.

 ?The cameras have helped us detect and curb crime,? a senior Eastern Railway official said on Monday. 

 Touting, male passengers travelling in ladies? compartments, eve-teasing, trespassing and unauthorised hawking were the most common offences detected by the surveillance cameras. 

 The cameras were installed in front of the office of the divisional railway manager (DRM), parcel office, north and south concourses, platforms VIII and IX, booking office, cabway and the suburban platforms, among other places, at a cost of Rs 12 lakh. 

 The images are monitored through the day from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) booth. There are monitors at the offices of the DRM, station superintendent and RPF officers as well. 

 Station officials said there was a provision to access the images at the chamber of any officer of the Howrah division through a local area network (LAN).

 ?Live monitoring of the station and on-the-spot decision-making have improved things at the station complex,? an official said.

 ?Male passengers often board ladies? compartments just before the departure of the train. When we see such attempts from our booth, we immediately apprehend the person,? said a senior RPF officer.

 He added that a number of eve-teasers had also been apprehended from the station complex with the help of the cameras. 

 The cameras have been put to other constructive uses, too. ?Now, when we see an abnormal rush at the counters, we open an extra counter,? an official said.

 He claimed congestion of the cabway and undue delay in loading and unloading of goods from trains had also been checked.

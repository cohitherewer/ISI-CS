 Tour tryst with the East

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gear up for a tourism expo, of the eastern kind. 

 The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), in association with Orissa Tourism, has organised The Splendours of the East, an exposition showcasing the tourism destinations in eastern India.

 From August 19 to 21, at the Royal Bengal Room, City Centre, Salt Lake, 35 stalls will display the best and most popular hotspots in the region. The participants include West Bengal and Sikkim tourism boards, and the northeastern states under the banner of the central ministry of tourism. 

 From the private sector will be 20-odd travel and tour operators who concentrate on marketing the east, like Vensimal, Globe (through the brand Holiday Destinations) Neptune and Desh Duniya, and a few hotel groups, like Sterling, Sinclairs and Oberoi.

 If the first event is successful, then plans are to make it an annual event, with more participants, including Bihar and Jharkhand, and partnership with one state a year. 

 The focus this year will be on Orissa. ?We want to join hands with the states to identify a common agenda and promote the region as a whole instead of marketing individual states,? said Navin Suchanti, chairman, tourism sub-committee, BCCI.

 The exposition has been timed to coincide with pre-Puja holiday planning. 

 ?We don?t know how it will be received, but entry is free, there will be spot bookings, package tours and special offers, for Puja and winter holidays,? added Suchanti. ?The participants have paid us to set up stalls, so they must think it?s worthwhile.?

 The tourism sub-committee hopes to promote the eastern region among domestic tourists. One area of focus is Buddhist pilgrimage to West Bengal, Orissa, Sikkim, Bihar and Jharkhand. ?The BCCI is just a facilitator,? explained Khokon Mukherjee of BCCI.

 Plans are on for an event on September 27, World Tourism Day.

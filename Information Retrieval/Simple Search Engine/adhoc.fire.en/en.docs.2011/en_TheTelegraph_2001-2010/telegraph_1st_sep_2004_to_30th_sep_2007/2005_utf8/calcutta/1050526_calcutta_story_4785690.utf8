 Website that counts tax returns, pension dues

 When husband Sekhar died just six months after retirement from his post as the station master of Ranaghat, 51-year-old Sabitri Mukherjee was left absolutely at sea. ?I had no clue how much I was supposed to get as family pension which was to be my only means of subsistence,? the childless widow recounts. 

 Running from pillar to post to get retirement dues or to get a trade licence renewed is part of the pain of being a commoner without the right connections.

 A website ? www.audit-accounts.org ? was launched on Wednesday by the Higher amp; State Audit and Accounts Services Association that, if well-maintained, will address the myriad finance-related woes of citizens. 

 Just fill in the columns for basic salary and other income heads, and the payable tax amount appears in a flash. It can even produce a Form 16, with all the calculations done. 

 Similarly, government employees can find out the quantum of their gratuity, pension and death dues by filling in a similar worksheet. Bank branches where you can open your pension account are enlisted.

 ?We thought of setting up this website as there seems to be a deficit of finance-related information from the government. Our 800 members are present across departments, from the tax tribunal to the Directorate of Pension and Provident Fund to the cooperative society?s Directorate of Audit. Whatever be the query, our members in the department concerned will answer within 14 days,? says pay and accounts officer Kalyan Ghosh, also president of the association. 

 Other than handling specific problems, the website is divided into four sections ? for students aiming for the audit and accounts service examination, for government officials (with the budget and many government guidelines at fingertips), for association members and an elaborate FAQ section for the public. 

 The section for students has the syllabus of the test for recruitment to West Bengal Audit and Accounts Services.

 There is a wealth of downloadable forms, both electoral and general. The latter includes group insurance savings nomination, government provident fund nomination and nomination of death gratuity. 

 Income tax forms, like saral 2D and naya saral, can be filled up on-screen, with instructions how to do so.

 One can read up on the functioning of the directorate of registration and stamp revenue. ?When buying property, people have problems determining stamp duty and registration cost. A section enlists these rates. All one needs to know is the property valuation cost,? explains Amit Sengupta, additional pay and accounts officer. 

 Teachers are known to have trouble collecting their superannuation benefits. ?But that is because most of them do not have an idea of the documents they need to submit. That is why we have kept a section on school pension,? Ghosh points out.

 ?This will be a godsend,? accepts Soma Biswas, a teacher in a higher secondary school in Maniktala.

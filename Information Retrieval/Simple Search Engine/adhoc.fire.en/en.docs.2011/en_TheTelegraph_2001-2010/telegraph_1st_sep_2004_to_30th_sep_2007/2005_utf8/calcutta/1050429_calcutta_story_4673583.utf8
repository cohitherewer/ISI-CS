 Surgery options open for epileptics

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta is set to become a hub of epilepsy surgery, with both private and public healthcare institutes starting speciality units for the disease.

 Suraksha Hospital inaugurated its epilepsy surgery unit on Thursday, while Bangur Institute of Neurology (BIN) announced plans for its unit.

 Doctors said the units would cater to about 250,000 patients in eastern India suffering from uncontrolled epilepsy. There are 4.5 million epilepsy patients in the country, including 900,000 uncontrolled epilepsy patients. 

 ?Lack of awareness about uncontrolled epilepsy is a major hindrance in treatment of the disease,? said neurosurgeon Sujoy Sanyal of the Uncontrolled Epilepsy and Epilepsy Surgery Programme, a joint initiative of Suraksha Hospital and Gamma-SPECT Imaging and Diagnostics Centre.

 ?It is a common notion that three-minute attacks are all there is to epilepsy. But it is much worse; it actually upsets a person?s life,? he explained.

 According to Sanyal, if an epilepsy patient responds to drugs, he or she does so within the first year of treatment.

 ?If the first major drug fails to improve the patient?s condition by monotherapy, chances of success of the second alternative drug is 10 per cent and the third is a mere four per cent,? Sanyal said. He added that surgery is not the last resort for uncontrolled epilepsy.

 ?Epilepsy surgery is not expensive, as 60 per cent of the operations can be performed at smaller hospitals, equipped with only an EEG, an MRI, a SPECT scan and a standard neurosurgical set-up,? the neurosurgeon continued.

 He, however, warned that the hospitals must have specialists to handle the equipment and make proper diagnosis. 

 In epilepsy, an area of the brain becomes electrically active and irritates the rest of the brain. Pre-operative evaluation of uncontrolled epilepsy patients is generally done by a team of specialists. 

 At the Suraksha unit, the Institute of Child Health will provide infrastructural support. The department of atomic energy has also expressed willingness to extend help.

 The surgery unit at BIN is expected to be operational soon. ?The plans are in the initial stages but it won?t be long before we set up the unit,? said Trishit Roy, director of BIN. ?We have the required infrastructure.?

 For the SPECT scan machine, the institute would tie up with a private organisation, Roy added. 

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said at the inauguration of the Suraksha unit that at least a third of the uncontrolled epilepsy patients can be cured by surgery.

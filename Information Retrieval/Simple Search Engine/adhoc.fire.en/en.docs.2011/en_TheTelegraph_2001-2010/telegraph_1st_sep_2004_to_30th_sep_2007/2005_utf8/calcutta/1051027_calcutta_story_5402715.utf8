The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scanner on another rail job scam

 - Constable?s son among those duped by divisional manager?s office clerk

 Not just the seniors, juniors in the railways ranks, too, seem to be out to make a fast buck by offering employment to youths desperate for a ?secure government job?. 

 A job fraud by a clerk in the office of the divisional railway manager (DRM), Sealdah, has come under the scanner. Among the youths taken for a ride is the son of city cop.

 On Monday, Metro Railway deputy chief personnel officer Biswanath Hansda was arrested by the Government Railway Police for offering fake appointments to 50 youths in 2003.

 According to sources in the DRM?s office, in early 2005, the employee being probed had ?trapped? four youths by promising them jobs as group-D staff, against payments of Rs 15,000 each. 

 The youths had approached the employee after hearing that he was ?well-connected? and could arrange for employment in the railways. 

 Two of the youths are related, one of them being the son of a constable, now part of the Reserve Police division of Calcutta Police. He hails from Akra, in South 24-Parganas.

 The four were handed receipts against payments of Rs 15,000 each. The receipt bore a seal proclaiming ?DRM Office, Sealdah?. The seal was forged. 

 ?A week after they made the payments, the four were asked to join work at Sealdah station. Their first assignment was to count the number of persons entering and leaving the station,? disclosed a senior officer of the DRM office, Sealdah.

 He added that the employee had earlier duped others by offering jobs as ?gangmen? in the Sealdah division. 

 Three days into their ?job?, the youths realised they had been cheated, following a conversation with the staff on duty. The victims complained to the employees and even informed the railway police brass.

 ?I am aware of the incident but it would not be proper to comment on it. Besides, as in most such cases, the victims do not have any clinching evidence of the clerk duping them. He has to be caught red-handed for us to nail him,? said Mukul Sengupta, inspector-general of police (railways). 

 Senior railway officers, too, refused to speak on the matter. They said the loopholes in the appointment process of the railways are being ironed out to avoid job scams. 

 ?A few months ago, the vigilance wing had identified some employees who were reportedly engaged in such activities. They have been suspended. Our employment procedures are almost foolproof now,? claimed Radhey Shyam, DRM, Sealdah.

 ?Every step ? even the despatch of a letter by post or a memo ? is strictly scanned. Besides, when one joins the service, he is asked to report to a particular officer. I can?t say much about the case. If someone is willing to trust a person blindly, then one can?t help him,? the DRM signed off.

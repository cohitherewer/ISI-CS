 The City Diary

 A man was arrested in Howrah on Thursday on charges of killing an eight-year-old boy. Additional superintendent of police (rural) Basab Dasgupta said the child, Kartik Das, used to play in the house of Parimal Das, a resident of Garchumuk, in the Shyampur police station area. Parimal had asked the boy not to do so. On Thursday, he hit the boy on his head with a shovel. He was taken to Uluberia hospital, where he died.

 A false fire alarm sounded at Writers? Buildings around 1.15 pm on Thursday. Fire services officials said an electrical short-circuit, caused by water dripping from the ceiling, activated the alarm in the labour secretary?s room. Four fire tenders rushed to the spot.

 A gang of four looted a jewellery shop in Pakuria, in Howrah?s Domjur, late on Wednesday. Police said the burglars locked the six night guards in a room and made off with around 150 g of silver. No one has been arrested. 

 Dewdrops High School, a 24-year-old institution in Lake Gardens, has been affiliated to the ICSE. The school is now a unit of St Sebastian School, Seal Lane (Tangra), which is affiliated to the ICSE (for Class X) and the ISC (for plus-2). M.P. Rozario, principal of St Sebastian School, said there would be no administrative change in Dewdrops, one of the few schools in the city that offers seats to children from economically backward families free or at concessional rates. Dewdrops acting principal Sonali Majumdar said ICSE affiliation would help the management meet the guardians? demands. 

 Unidentified criminals have killed the 40-year-old guard of a workshop in Howrah. Birju, the guard, was found dead on Thursday morning in his room in the workshop at 99/1, KD Jalan Road, in Malipanchghara. No one has been arrested.

 In a pre-Holi drive, 22 people were arrested in Howrah on Thursday for dealing in illicit liquor. In the past two days, seven big and 15 small dealers were held. Around 2,000 litres of liquor was destroyed, police said. 

 Metro Railway services will be available from 3 pm to 9.45 pm on Friday, an official said. Trains will leave at an interval of 15 minutes.

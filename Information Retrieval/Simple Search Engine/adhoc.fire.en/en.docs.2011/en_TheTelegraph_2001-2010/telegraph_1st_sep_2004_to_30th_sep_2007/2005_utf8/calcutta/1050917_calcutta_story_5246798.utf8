 Cop caution on star talk

 - Lalbazar tells cable channels to axe telly?s fortune-tellers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Are the fortunes of the television fortune-tellers finally fading? In March, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had voiced his displeasure over the astrology content on local cable channels. He also announced that the law department would examine whether the channels could be prosecuted.

 It took six months for that prod to turn into a push, as the cops called in cablemen on Friday and told them to stop airing channels with astrology and pornography content.

 Deputy commissioner of police, detective department (I) Gyanwant Singh, on behalf of the administration, ?requested? representatives of all multi-system operators (MSOs) to take off air channels beaming content that does not adhere to the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act.

 The clamour for star talk on telly and the amounts coughed up by astrologers as airtime make the pullout a tough ask for MSOs. ?We just can?t switch off channels like that,? said an MSO official after the Lalbazar meeting. ?We asked the deputy police commissioner to send us a letter, based on which we can inform the channels. If they do not pay heed, we can switch them off.?

 In April, a consortium of six local cable channels had announced they would stop airing ?unscientific programmes like astrology? immediately, provided the MSOs didn?t push for higher carriage fees. Most of them still continue to run the programmes, while the losses are mounting for those who have stopped.

 ?I?m losing Rs 4 lakh every month since I stopped airing astrology programmes,? rues Tapan Roy of ATN Calcutta. ?Also, MSOs are not willing to settle for a lesser placement fee, since other channels are more than willing to pay that.?

 The pornography preach from police was prompted particularly by complaints of some operators in North 24-Parganas continuing to air the French channel Ren TV.

 Cop caution aside, the other beam buzz is of SitiCable, the largest MSO in town, being in talks with rivals Manthan and CableComm to acquire them. SitiCable had picked up rival ? then largest city MSO ? Indian Cable Net in May for around Rs 48 crore. The offer for Manthan is reportedly Rs 11.36 crore, without the liabilities. The takeover is likely to take place in the next financial year.

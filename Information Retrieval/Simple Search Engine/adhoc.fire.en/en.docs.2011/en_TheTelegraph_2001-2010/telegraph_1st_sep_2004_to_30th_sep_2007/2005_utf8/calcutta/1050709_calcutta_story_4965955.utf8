 Video for jail safety

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The escape of 12 Tihar jail inmates, while being taken to court on Wednesday, has prompted the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to consider introducing video-conferencing to avert regular production of undertrials before magistrates.

 Once the system is in place, an officer explained, magistrates can conduct trial proceedings even while the accused are in the safe custody of the prison. 

 ?Video master sets, through which the court will interact with the accused, can be installed in certain jails,? pointed out Ramapada Bhattacharya, additional director-general of prisons.

 The Tihar inmates escaped after breaking the latch of a police lock-up, where they were lodged before their scheduled appearance in court.

 That such incidents can happen any time in Bengal has been accepted by senior officers responsible for the security at three central jails in the city ? Alipore, Presidency and Dum Dum ? and 50 other prisons in the districts.

 They are unanimous that producing undertrials in court turns out to be very risky at times. 

 ?On several occasions, undertrials have escaped while being taken to court from prison or on the way back,? confirmed additional director-general Bhattacharya. 

 ?It was a nightmarish experience for us when criminals like Aftab Ansari and his associates were taken to court. They are now convicted, but there are the likes of Gabbar and Sheikh Asgar to worry about,? said a warder at Alipore Central jail. 

 ?The undertrials need not be produced in court if video sets are installed in jails,? he added.

 The authorities are also taking other measures to boost security on the jail compounds. The rosters are being changed regularly to ensure that a warder does not get an opportunity to strike up a friendship with an inmate. 

 ?Now, no warder is posted at a place for more than a day,? said Anup Tripathi, deputy inspector-general of prisons.

 Vigil has also been intensified on the inmates? visitors. 

 ?We have no problem if the inmates? relatives or friends meet them in jails. But the visitors will be thoroughly scanned, as they often pass on mobile phones and other prohibited articles to the inmates,? said a senior officer at Presidency jail.

 A section of warders, too, was involved in helping the inmates flee the jail or obtain those banned articles. To preempt the possibility of a nexus between prisoners and warders, the authorities have decreed that food will not be served in the cells. 

 ?Everyone has to eat lunch or dinner in the community kitchen,? said a discipline officer at Dum Dum Central jail.

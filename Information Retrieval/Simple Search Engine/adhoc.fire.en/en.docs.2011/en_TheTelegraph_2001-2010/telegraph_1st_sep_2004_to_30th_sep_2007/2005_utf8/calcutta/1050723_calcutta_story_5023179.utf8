The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Squatter offer to buy land

 - Settlers pool money, onus on railway for reasonable rate

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The settlers along Rabindra Sarobar are ready to buy land if Eastern Railway agrees to sell it to them at a reasonable rate. Their counsel and Trinamul Congress MLA, Kalyan Banerjee, placed the offer before the high court during the hearing of the case on Friday.

 ?The settlers have already pooled money and created a fund for the purpose. If the railway decides to make available its barren lands for commercial purposes, then it can sell a plot to us, but obviously, at a reasonable rate,? proposed Banerjee.

 He said his clients had definite information that the railway had barren land, not far from Gobindapur, where the settlers are staying now.

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly asked the lawyer to file an affidavit stating details about the railway barren land. At the same time, the court asked the railway to file an affidavit stating whether it was ready to accept the settlers? proposal.

 Appearing for the railway, advocate S.K. Kapoor and Uttam Majumdar told the court that railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav had never said that land would be allotted for the rehabilitation of the squatters. Submitting video clips in the court, they alleged that some newspapers had presented a distorted version of minister?s statement.

 The bench declined to accept the video clips and asked the railway to file an affidavit in this regard. Meanwhile, the state government on Friday failed to prove that the minister had promised before a parliamentary standing committee that he would allot land.

 As per the court?s earlier directive, advocate-general Balai Ray submitted an affidavit before it claiming that the railways standing committee was planning to table a Bill in Parliament to utilise the vacant railway land for commercial purposes.

 The next hearing of the case would be on August 24.

 Environmental activist Subhas Dutta, petitioner of the case relating to the pollution in and around the Dhakuria Lakes, later told Metro that during the next hearing, he would request the court to intervene in matters relating to beautification of the Sarobar. ?There is still a lot left to do to beautify the Lakes,? he said.

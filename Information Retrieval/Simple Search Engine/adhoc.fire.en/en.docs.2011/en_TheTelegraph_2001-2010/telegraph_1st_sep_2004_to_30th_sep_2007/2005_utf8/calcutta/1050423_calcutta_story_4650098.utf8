 The City Diary

 Calcutta and its surrounding districts have remained ?largely unaffected? by the ongoing bandh in wholesale markets to protest the imposition of value-added tax (VAT), finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Friday. The 10-day bandh started on April 20.

 The minister was speaking after a meeting with a section of traders at Writers? Buildings. He said the enforcement branch had been asked to keep a close watch on wholesale markets across the state and take action against anyone found guilty of creating an artificial crisis, resulting in a price hike. 

 Most markets, wholesale and retail, across the city and its surrounding areas are open,? he said. Asked why the prices of LPG and medicines are not coming down despite the imposition of VAT, Dasgupta said retailers were yet to clear the old stock. ?It will take at least another month or so for the new rates to become effective.?

 A traffic sergeant died early on Friday, apparently of sun stroke. Sunil Gupta, 30, of Vidyasagar Traffic Guard, fell ill at Hastings police station on Thursday afternoon. He died at his Ekbalpore residence at 3 am. Immediately after he fell ill, his colleagues took him to the police hospital and then, on doctors? advice, to SSKM Hospital. As the ECG report was normal, Gupta was discharged from SSKM. But he suffered a cardiac arrest at home.

The members demanded that the campus be freed of touts, security of the patients be stepped up and those responsible for molesting some women patients recently be arrested. 

 Utpal Goswami, a Presidency jail warden, was seriously injured when a lifer attacked him on Thursday night. Sources said the lifer, Sahajada alias Jagga, had pleaded with Goswami to keep his cell open at night so he could roam around. When the warden refused, Jagga hit him on the head and hands with a rod. Goswami was taken to the jail hospital in a critical condition.

 SWINGIN? OLDIES: A participant of the Grandparents Golfing Hungama takes a breather. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 As Yashpal Gupta peered ahead in the mellow spring morning to follow the course of his drive, he wished his two-plus granddaughter Manya was there by his side.

 It was a golfing get-together with a difference at the Tollygunge Club on Friday, and the 57-year-old additional general manager of Southeastern Railway was among the 100-odd elders taking part in the Grandparents Golfing Hungama.

 The brainchild of three ?full-of-beans? grandparents, Sushil Poddar, Vijay Singh and K.S.B. Sanyal, with whole-hearted support from A.K. ?Bablu? Chowdhuri, managing member (golf), Tollygunge Club, the tournament is a unique sporting platform, bringing grandmoms and granddads together on the greens.

 ?It?s the first meet of its kind in the country and probably, in the whole world, and we have applied for recognition by the Guinness Book of World Records,? said Poddar.

 L.N. Bangur, chairman of The Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Ltd, sponsors of the novel meet, pledged ?long-term support? for the grandparents? tourney. 

 ?Its a great opportunity for the elders to come together in an atmosphere of relaxed camaraderie,? he felt.

 At a time when more and more youngsters are picking up their irons and walking the course, the elderly, often crowded out in the GenX rush, have hailed the tournament as a breath of fresh air. 

 And even if Gupta?s granddaughter was out of town, there were plenty of infants and children present to egg on their swinging grandparents.

 Paediatrician Asha Padgaonkar, ex-superintendent of CMRI and also a grandma, did a few good holes and ?a few not so good?. But the regular golfer with a handicap of 22 didn?t seem to mind. 

 ?It?s a great feeling to be out there with friends who are about the same age and you feel younger and rejuvenated,? she smiled.

 For Ronnie Patel, who turned grandpa a year back and, hence, qualified for this edition, it would be the first and last ?Hungama?, as the Patels are migrating to Manila. 

 ?I loved every moment of the experience. I?ll cherish the fond memories of this wonderful social event,? he gushed.

 Only grandparents having handicaps up to 36 were eligible to participate, but for the purpose of deciding net scores, a maximum handicap of only 24 was allowed. 

 The stableford competition was played in conformity with rules issued by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, St Andrews and the USGA, ?modified to suit local conditions?.

 ?The response was overwhelming and while more than 100 grandparents teed off, we had to refuse another 50 at least,? said Chowdhuri.

 State plea for time tossed out

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta High Court on Monday all but turned down the state?s plea for an extension of the deadline, up to December 31, for evicting squatters from railway land along Rabindra Sarobar.

 Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly slammed the government for delaying the court-ordered eviction on one pretext after another for the past three years. The government was asked to obtain an undertaking from the settlers by November 30, stating that they were willing to move to another site.

 ?We want to know whether the state is sure that the settlers will accept its proposal for relocation and vacate the place. Let them first give an undertaking that they will vacate the place,? the division bench said. 

 The court on November 11 had ordered that the settlers be evicted by November 30. On Monday, advocate-general Balai Ray submitted that a site had been chosen in Nonadanga, off EM Bypass, for the settlers? relocation and that ?an extension of the deadline was required to complete the process peacefully?.

 The bench told Ray: ?We remember the day the squatters had approached us, seeking an extension of the deadline. The plea was opposed by the government. Now, the same government is apprehending bloodshed in forceful eviction.?

 The judges said they were aware of the squatters? public announcement that they would not leave the railway land.

 The bench told L.C. Behani, counsel for Dhakuria-Tollygunge Rail Colony Sangram Committee: ?The organisation of your clients is not registered. How can the government hand over land to such a body??

 At this point, Ray said the government had identified 2,738 families, who have been living along the Lakes for a long time, and would form a cooperative with them. ?A 10-acre plot will be handed over to these families for constructing houses.?

 The bench then directed that the heads of these families submit undertakings, saying they were willing to vacate the encroached land. The submissions will have to be accompanied by identification proof, like ration cards or voter identity cards.

 Refusing the state?s plea for more time, the bench fixed the next hearing on November 30.

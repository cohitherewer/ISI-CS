 Summer splash! 

 Taking a dip at home is the cool est treat, says 

 With summer making its presence felt ? and how ? there?s nothing more alluring than a dip in a cool blue swimming pool. As work pressure piles up and travel time adds up, what better than a pool at home? That, however, is easier said than done. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you start working on that big summer splash...

 Position point

 The obvious call to be taken at the very outset is whether the pool should be placed indoors or outdoors. ?This will most definitely depend on the amount of apace available, and must accordingly be merged within the landscape,? says Ashok Chawla of Watco India, a company that claims to have created ?99 per cent of the swimming pools? in the city. Whatever be the placement, the pool is best kept close to the house since it?s most likely to be the centre of attraction ? not just for a solitary swim but also to host parties in the deck area.

 Thereafter, one needs to find out if there are any zoning laws requiring a minimum distance the pool has to be from the property line. Also, buried utilities like gas, sewer and water supplies must be taken note of.

 For those creating outdoor pools, sun and wind patterns must be observed especially in hot and humid climes like ours where taking advantage of shade patterns is essential.

 An overhead electrical line is a no-no, while dedicated lines to power the pumps, filter and lights are musts. Also, an outdoor faucet to fill up the pool.

 Design deal

 Designing a pool can be great fun, especially the embellishments and add-ons, but its basic purpose should be ascertained first. 

 It could be used mainly for exercise, as an entertainment spot for kids, as a private relaxation zone or just a party spot. Once the focus and people usage is determined, it?s time for creativity to flow.

 Earlier, design would mean a kidney-shaped pool with deep-end and shallow-end and a diving board. ?Today, residential pools range from long narrow lap pools to exotic shapes with vanishing edges to waterfall-laced lagoons reminiscent of the tropics. Colourful murals can add interest to pool bottoms and walls as can fibre-optic lighting,? says designer Anita Mansatta.

 Natural-looking pools often incorporate water features and misting systems. ?One of the main value additions to a pool is creating a bar-on-wheels with rubber or wood. Also, most homes have their pools in the garden area and using tiles, bisazza, plants and non-slippery terracotta flooring is as aesthetic as useful,? adds Mansatta.

 As far as furniture goes, everything should be foldable ? deck chairs, shade umbrellas, bar?

 Maintenance

 Only a squeaky clean pool makes a safe pool. For routine maintenance, there?s a basic equipment list of must-haves ? vacuum cleaner, brushes, leaf skimmer and water-test kit. 

 There are two types of vacuum cleaners. The first works from a vacuum inlet as part of the filter system and is pushed slowly around the bottom of the pool to pull in water, dirt and debris. Leaves and other large objects are caught in the pump strainer and smaller particles are removed in the filter before the clear water is returned to the pool. 

 The second is a jet cleaner that is frequently used in pools without a vacuum fitting. Similar to a carpet sweeper, it is easily assembled and moves rapidly across the pool surface. 

 The water movement draws dirt and debris into a filter bag.

 On the brush front, a nylon brush is recommended for general cleaning and scrubbing, and a stainless steel brush for removing algae, rust stains and dirt.

 The leaf skimmer is a frame with a plastic mesh skimming net attached.

 A regular system of cleaning and purifying through chlorination will also prevent any serious problems.

 Feng Shui 

 According to Feng Shui, water represents sustenance, wealth, and the flow of life ? the flow of water is proportionate to flow of money? but one must keep in mind certain principles.

 ?Firstly, the body of water should not be larger than the house, or it can energetically overwhelm the house and weaken the occupants chi.

 Secondly, sharp angles of a swimming pool pointed towards the house represent a cutting edge and can cause accidents in the residency. The shape should always have soft curves.

 Thirdly, rounded organic shapes such as the common kidney look relate directly to the water element in the body. These should appear to hug the house so that wealth both gathers and remains in the house.

 Then, water should always be placed in the north or east,? says Feng Shui expert Pinky Kapoor.

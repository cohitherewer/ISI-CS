The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All-star families

 It is billed as television?s most-watched show. And if the TRP-scorching events of the last two years are anything to go by, the billing is not way off the mark. The 2005 edition of the STAR Parivaar Awards is ready to hit the screen. In its third year, the awards bring the entire television industry together on one platform to cheer and laud the performances of their co-actors and colleagues. 

 From television icons like Tulsi, Parvati, Prerna, Mihir, Om and Bajaj to bad girls like Komolika, Manju and Mohini to the younger generation of small-screen characters like Nandini, Shruti, Monika and Gautam and child stars like Fruity, Bebo, and Sneha ? all will be there to cheer their parivaars.

 The viewers, again, get to do the picking. The SMS lines are open for voting from May 14 to May 24. All you have to do is message ?Award? to 7827. This is your chance to vote for your favourite characters, in all of 19 categories. The categories to watch out for remain Favourite Jodi, Favourite Nani, Favourite Devar, Favourite Sasur and, of course, Favourite Bahu. While some serials and actors have ruled the air-waves for a long time now, there are also several new entrants this time.

 Before punching those votes in, you may like to check out the Nomination Specials on May 14 and 15 and the Jodi Special on May 21 on STAR Plus. Other STAR Parivaar Awards specials include Kuch Lamhe on May 28, Red Carpet on June 3 and the main event on June 4. The post-party bash will be telecast on June 10.

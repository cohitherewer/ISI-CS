 Summit solace on the side 

 - Trips, shopping, meals and more to beat the boardroom boredom

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Long hours of business brainstorming, and a bit of a breather beyond. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Partnership Summit 2005 has been one hectic 48 hours, with 24 more still to go, but there?s some solace on the side.

 To beat boardroom boredom, CII has organised an alternative programme for wives of the business leaders and whoever else wants to come along, and after-hours events for everyone. So, if on Wednesday it was time to catch the light-and-sound show at Victoria Memorial, a visit to Belur Math was the highlight for Singaporean, Chinese and other delegates on Thursday.

 ?It?s all about commerce and industry at the National Library, but the parallel track has been designed to cover diverse subjects and interests,? explained a CII spokesperson.

 The range, thus, stretched from a river cruise to a session on Bengal art, development issues to a spiritual discourse. And there were takers for them all. ?The trips around town have gone down very well,? disclosed the spokesperson. ?But shopping has been the most popular pursuit.?

 For the team from Laos, shop stops at Forum and City Centre were the high points. Sampling traditional Bengali cuisine wasn?t far behind, with an O! Calcutta lunch being hosted by Forum chief Rahul Saraf.

 Back at Taj Bengal, the women have been busy attending sessions on a variety of issues, from NGO projects to kantha weaves. The men haven?t been idle, either. Khazana, the boutique at the hotel, has notched up impressive sales figures, with the Partnership Summit crowd picking up costume jewellery, interiors (cushions, gaddis, bedcovers), paintings, ties and kantha and Baluchari saris. Men, in fact, are the bigger buyers, said manager Simanti Nair.

 The lifestyle and leisure departments, too, are bustling with bookings. The Health Club is turning away customers for want of space and time. The men, ?far more than the women?, according to Health Club manager Saira Ali, are signing up for the ayurvedic body massage, ?the perfect means to unwind after a hectic day at the conference?.

 But above all the extra-curricular activity, the conference curriculum loomed large. ?Business talk has dominated the two days, whether in the conference room or at informal tea sessions. With everyone so focussed on the summit, the most common comment has been how the attitude towards business in Bengal has changed from adda to action,? observed a Taj spokesperson.

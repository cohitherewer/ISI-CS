 Suvarghya Kar: I have an 

 assembled PC with Pentium III processor, 128 MB SD RAM, 

 40 GB HDD with Windows XP Professional. For the past few 

 weeks, whenever I work with two-three windows open for a 

 few minutes, the message ?Windows Explorer has encountered 

 a problem and needs to close? appears. There are three options 

 ?debug?, ?send error report? and ?don?t send?. If I click 

 ?don?t send?, another message appears: ?An error has occurred 

 in Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer will now close. 

 If you continue to face problems, please restart your computer.? 

 If I press Ok, then the computers restarts and if I cancel 

 the message box, all the active folders close. 

 TechTalk: If an application 

 experiences an error that it is not prepared to handle, 

 Windows XP stops the application and prompts you to send 

 an error report. Instal the latest service pack for Windows 

 XP Professional and Internet Explorer and update your anti-virus 

 software. To turn off error reporting, right-click My Computer 

 and click Properties. On the Advanced tab, click Error Reporting 

 and Disable. Also clear the ?But notify me when critical 

 errors occur? checkbox.

 Vadapalli Srinivas: I would 

 like my PC to automatically shut down at a scheduled time. 

 How do I do this?

 TechTalk: To turn off the 

 computer automatically at a user-specified time, try a third-party 

 software like Accurate Shutdown (http://www.gold-software.com) 

 or ShutDownOnTime or Timed Shutdown (http://www.snapfiles.com). 

 There are many other such programs on the Internet.

 Taha Kapdawala: Whenever 

 I connect to MSN Messenger Service the following pop-up 

 appears: ?We are unable to sign you into .NET Messenger 

 service possibly because of a problem with the service or 

 with your Internet connection. Please make sure that you 

 are connected to the Internet. 0x 81000301.? 

 TechTalk: This error usually 

 indicates that your password is incorrect. Make sure you 

 typed your username and password correctly.

 Also, visit http://www.passport.net 

 and check whether you can log in there with your MSN username 

 and password. If you fail, your account may have been stolen 

 by someone else or cancelled for technical reasons.

 However, if you can log in on 

 the passport.net site, the problem may be with MSN Messenger. 

 Try the following solution, but note that it will delete 

 your custom emoticons and display pictures. 

 Click on Start and then on Run. 

 If you use Windows 2000, XP or 2003, type: ?%appdata%\microsoft? 

 and press Enter. Delete the MSN Messenger folder. For Windows 

 95, 98 or Millennium (ME), type: ?%windir%\Application Data\Microsoft? 

 and press Enter. Delete the MSN Messenger folder.

 Check your Internet Explorer Security 

 Make sure that use SSL 2.0 and use SSL 3.0 are both checked. 

 MSN Messenger requires SSL for the authentication process. 

 Finally, ensure you are connected 

 to the Internet and have the latest version of MSN Messenger.

 If your PC is part of a network, 

 make sure the network allows access to the MSN Messenger 

 service and if you are using a firewall, make sure that 

 MSN Messenger is allowed full access.

 Also try the MSN Messenger Connection 

 Troubleshooter to examine your system.

 Anjan Dutta: I have a Pentium 

 IV 1.7 GHz processor on Intel D850MV motherboard with 128 

 MB PC800 RD RAM, 15? SAMTRON 56V monitor, NVIDIA RIVA TNT2 

 graphics adapter with 32 MB onboard RAM and Windows 98 SE. 

 The game Hoyle Majestic Chess meets all the requirements 

 but after successful installation, when I try to play the 

 game it returns to the desktop. I have tried reinstalling.

 TechTalk: Chances are that 

 a previous installation has changed the Windows registry 

 setting. Particularly if you had tried a demo or crack version 

 of the game.

 and press Enter. Navigate to the following registry key: 

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall. 

 Here, you will see the product ID keys.

 Click each ID and look for ?Hoyle 

 Majestic Chess? in the right pane. On finding it, delete 

 it and exit the registry editor. You can now reinstal game.

 If it still doesn?t run, try updating 

 the driver files from the manufacturer?s website. Also check 

 if DirectX is functioning properly. Instal the latest DirectX 

 (version 9.0c).

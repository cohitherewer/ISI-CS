The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?I decided to wait for Jyotibabu to retire?

His documentary on Jyoti Basu is rolling towards a public 

release, while the one on the Dalai Lama is ready to premiere in Delhi on April 

8. GOUTAM GHOSE speaks to Reshmi Sengupta about why he makes documentaries 

and about the feature films he is planning

 Goutam Ghose shooting Jyoti Basu for the 

documentary Jyoti Basur Songe, and (below) directing Debasree Roy 

and a child actor in Dekha 

 Jyoti Basu has been very candid while discussing 

several controversial issues in your film, Jyoti Basur Songe. How did you 

make that happen?

I had some doubts about the project when I started 

it eight years ago, because we couldn?t probably go on following Jyotibabu 

wherever he went. So, we decided not to have it as an assigned project; it?s 

more of a love?s labour. But the delay has come as a blessing as so many political 

equations have changed in this period. There was Babri Masjid, Gujarat riots, 

9/11, Iraq war? And though we have filmed him over the past eight years, I took 

the interview only last year. There?s so much footage we haven?t used.

I asked Jyotibabu to narrate his experiences 

of several political situations along with his assessment. I had sent him a questionnaire 

as I thought people of his generation were very methodical. And I had kept my 

questions more or less chronological for him to get the cues. That also ensured 

the flow of emotions in him.

As a film-maker, you also look for great cinematic 

moments. When I made the documentary on Ustad Bismillah Khan in Benares, the place, 

the sights and the sounds formed an incredible alchemy. But I didn?t know what 

to do with the Jyoti Basu film. There wasn?t much archival matter either. So, 

I decided to wait for him to retire. That facilitated his reflections and assessment 

on several topics that he hadn?t spoken about so far. And I think the person and 

the politician in him have come out very well. The film will be released at Nandan 

and a few other halls on May 1.

 People are very curious about Basu?s personal 

life. Couldn?t you have woven that in?

I had thought of it but Jyotibabu wasn?t too 

interested. His entire career was engaged in politics and the party was his top 

priority. But that doesn?t mean he didn?t care for his family. In the documentary, 

there are two people ? Hiren Mukherjee and Supriya Acharya ? who talk about this 

aspect.

 What do you look for while making a documentary 

on a personality?

I want them to share their experiences and philosophy 

with the audience because I think it?s very important for posterity. I also get 

to learn so much from them. For instance, while making the film on Bismillah Khan, 

I came in touch with his incredible humility. Mohordi (Kanika Bandopadhyay) 

had a different attitude altogether, having lived in Santiniketan. What I came 

to know while making these documentaries is that each of them is a very good actor. 

I have had no rehearsals with them and yet they were so much at ease in front 

of the camera, which even professional actors find very difficult.

 Why do you make documentaries?

Because it widens my area of knowledge. I can do a 

lot of research. When I make a film on a place, say the one I made on Kalahandi, 

it helps me meet people and understand our political history. But I don?t like 

to make a documentary between two feature films. Such concepts need to be dealt 

with in a proper manner.

Right now, I am directing a documentary on the patuas 

of Kumartuli, commissioned by Roopkala Kendra. We are looking at the indigenous 

art and how it has grown. What fascinates me is the impermanence of this art ? 

you create an image and immerse it.

 What about Banshi, the film based on a 

Kamal Kumar Majumdar story which you were planning to start?

The problem with Banshi is that I am not finding 

suitable actors. I had initially decided to cast Prosenjit in the lead, but I 

think his age will pose a problem now. I am thinking of using a major actor so 

that the film has an all-India market. Banshi is a period film, stretching 

from 1940 to the Partition, and if I have to do it properly, it will be a little 

expensive with the sets and special effects. And I also need the monsoons?

 So, there isn?t anything planned in between?

I am planning an English-Hindi bilingual film. It 

is based on the diaries of a friend who lives in Europe. The idea is to juxtapose 

my experiences of Europe and his experiences of India. So, I will be using the 

contents of my diary as well.

The friend, Alexandro, is a teacher of literature 

who fails to communicate with his students? Virgil and Cicero have lost their 

relevance for them. So, he takes a break and comes to India. As he travels the 

country, he takes pictures of children. Once back home, Alexandro invites his 

students to participate in reconstructing a story around one of the boys? tracing 

his journey from the village to the city. 

This apart, I am also supposed to do an Indo-Bangla 

co-production. And if these two projects take a little time, I will do a very 

minimalist film.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Last lap in hotel bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The high-powered committee on privatisation of Great Eastern Hotel on Monday opened the financial bids with three quotations.

 The suitors of the state-run Great Eastern Hotel are the Unitech Group, Ramuk Scan AB and Bharat Hotels, none from top-rung hospitality addresses.

 An official linked with the privatisation move said on Monday that one of the three would be picked and the name sent to industry minister Nirupam Sen.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will give the final nod.

 Over 400 hotel employees who have opted for the early retirement scheme have complained that the authorities are yet to pay their dues.

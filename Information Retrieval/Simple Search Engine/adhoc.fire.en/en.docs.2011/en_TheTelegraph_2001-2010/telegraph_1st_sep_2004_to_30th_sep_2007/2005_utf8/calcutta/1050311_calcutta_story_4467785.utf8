 Laparoscopy bypass feat

 JULIUS GOMES

 Doctors at Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) have performed a rare laparoscopic bypass surgery to cure a 63-year-old man suffering from an uncommon disease, known as Wilkie?s Syndrome.

 Prasanta Kumar Das had been suffering from abdominal pain, nausea and gaseous distension for the past 16 years. Most of the health professionals he had consulted could not even figure out the cause of his ailment.

 Das was admitted to CMRI in the first week of February with complaints of vomiting and passing black stool. A series of tests revealed stones in the gall bladder, and also a ?chronic obstruction? in his intestine (duodenum). 

 The tests had, however, not been able to zero down on the root of the obstruction, which had caused Das?s stomach to swell abnormally. Finally, a few weeks ago, he underwent a rare laparoscopic bypass.

 In Wilkie?s Syndrome, the superior mesenteric artery presses on the third part of the duodenum and blocks passage of solid food. This syndrome is rare, and more so in India, said laparoscopic surgeon Ramesh Agarwalla, who put Das under the knife. 

 The patient and his wife were extensively counselled prior to the four-hour bypass procedure on February 23, performed by a team of doctors led by Agarwalla. 

 According to Agarwalla, the obstruction was bypassed by attaching a piece of intestine (jejunum) to the duodenum. Four incisions were made ? two of which measured 1 cm and two others half cm ? through which sophisticated cameras and surgical instruments were inserted.

 Till about two to three months ago, Das?s condition was critical. His intestinal passage had become narrow and would allow only liquid food to pass through. As a result, he was becoming weak and was losing weight. 

 But 72 hours after the surgery, Das was out of bed. In a week?s time, he could eat normally and go about his daily activities. Das is under observation and will be released in a day or two, the doctors said.

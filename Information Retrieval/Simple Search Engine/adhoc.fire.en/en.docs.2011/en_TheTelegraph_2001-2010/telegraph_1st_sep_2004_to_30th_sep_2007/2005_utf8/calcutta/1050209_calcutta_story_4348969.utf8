The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Drivers of private buses and trucks are harassed by members of the parking 

lot cooperatives. The attendants often work in shifts and refuse to accept that 

the payment has been made to the attendant on the previous shift. I witnessed 

one such incident on Pathuriaghat Street, near Binani Bhavan, where a truck was 

parked from 1.45 in the afternoon. The attendants? shift changed at 2 pm and when 

the driver wanted to drive away at 2.15 pm the new attendant demanded Rs 200. 

Tiretta Bazar, Posta and Mechhua are the other problem pockets. 

 Name and address withheld on request. 

 I am a tourist to the city. I had a very bad experience at Sealdah railway 

station recently. As I couldn?t spot any display boards around, I approached a 

staff member at the booking counter for directions to the public toilet. He was 

very rude and told me that there wasn?t any in the entire building. Another official 

was kind enough to lead me to a toilet which was strictly for railway staff. It 

is beyond my comprehension why the public building does not have toilets, and 

even if there are a few, why are display boards not installed giving directions 

to newcomers like myself?

 Some unscrupulous people are openly engaging in buying and selling of turtles 

and tortoises in the suburbs. Lack of vigilance has only abetted the illegal activity. 

The government seems content with mere enactment of laws. Unhindered poaching 

has already pushed many of these species to the verge of extinction. Concrete 

steps must be taken to check the illegal trading.

 I usually drop my daughter at a spot on Sukanta Setu in Jadavpur, from where 

she, along with other children, makes her way to her school in Viveknagar. However, 

vehicles always speed along the stretch and crossing the road is very difficult. 

A few potholes add to the traffic problem. I request the authorities to depute 

a constable halfway up the Setu to control traffic between 10. 30 am and 11.30 

am, and from 4.30 pm to 5.30 pm on all weekdays.

 Earlier, CESC inspectors used to check electric meters of residential premises 

between 8.30 am and 10.30 am. But these days they come on the rounds only around 

11.30 am. In case the residents have already left for work, the inspectors charge 

an average amount which is greater than the actual bill. I appeal to the CESC 

to send the inspectors to residential premises either in the morning or late in 

the evening when people are home.

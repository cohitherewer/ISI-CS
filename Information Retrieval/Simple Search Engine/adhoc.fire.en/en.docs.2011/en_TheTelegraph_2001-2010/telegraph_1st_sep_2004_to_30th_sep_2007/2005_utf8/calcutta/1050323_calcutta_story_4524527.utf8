The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech firm on growth path

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the aim of reversing the ?brain-drain trend?, US-based Connectiva Systems is doubling the headcount at its Indian operations centre in Calcutta.

 The company, which develops revenue management software products and applications, has around 50 employees at its research and development centre in the city. By the third quarter of 2005-06, the number is set to touch ?90 to 100?, with the bulk recruitment done from the city itself.

 ?We will convert Calcutta into our profit centre,? said Avi Basu, chief operating officer of the company launched in 2001. ?Besides R amp;D, the centre will then perform commercial operations, too.? Connectiva is also setting up sales and marketing units in Delhi, Dubai and Manchester.

 ?We have closed several important deals in the past few months, including one with the Vodafone group in West Asia,? offered Kaustav Ghosh, vice-president, operations. The company claims to have secured another deal, ?one of the biggest in the revenue assurance field? for the wireless, wireline and broadband services of an Asian telecom major. 

 Connectiva expects its revenues ? currently ?around $5 million? ? to ?more than double? by the end of the next fiscal, with the existing line of products and new projects acting as growth drivers. Besides projects of HCL and IBM, Connectiva is also working on revenue assurance for the state-owned telecom giant BSNL, informed officials.

 ?The expansion plans will require an investment of less than $10 million, which we will procure largely from US venture capitalists,? explained Basu.

 Connectiva?s areas of work include enterprise revenue assurance, telecom application and business process integration and convergent network services.

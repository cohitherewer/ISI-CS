 Fear allayed on hotel sale

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has assured all eight bidders for Great Eastern Hotel that the property?s transfer to private hands will be smooth.

 At separate meetings with the government between July 4 and 6, all the bidders had expressed apprehension regarding the transfer of assets, the hotel?s heritage status and a host of other issues. The heritage tag on the 165-year-old landmark seemed to be the primary concern of most bidders.

 ?They wanted to know to what extent conservation rules would apply to the building and how the rules were going to affect their plans to redesign the hotel,? said a state government official.

 According to the rules, the fa?ade of the building cannot be changed, though alterations can be made inside.

 The presence of 11 licencees and 23 tenants on the compound has been another cause of concern for the bidders. 

 ?We?re selling the hotel on an as-is-where-is basis. We have promised the bidders that the tenants will be counselled not to disturb or disrupt the privatisation process, as this is a high-profile transaction,? said Sunil Mitra, outgoing secretary in the department of public enterprises and industrial reconstruction.

 Some bidders expressed anxiety over the title of the property and wanted to know if it could be mutated or mortgaged to raise funds. Mitra explained that the party who would acquire the hotel could not further transfer it.

 As the time for submission of technical and financial bids for the hotel approaches, the bidders are apprehensive about the worth of assets that the government will transfer to the private partner. 

 ?Bidders wanted to know why we had imposed an injunction on the sale of hotel shares within the first three years of the takeover. We told them that this being a public transaction and since a lot of public money has gone into it, the government had to guard against any damage to ownership,? an official said.

 Bidders for the ailing hotel include ITC Ltd, Park Hotels, Inter Continental South West Asia, Bharat Hotels, Claridges Hotel Group, Unitech Group, Ramsuk Scan AB (a Scandinavian company) and Ruchi Group. New Kenilworth and Sinclairs have opted out of the fray.

 At the meetings with the bidders, the government was represented by secretary Mitra, Ardhendu Sen (he will take over as public enterprises and industrial reconstruction secretary) and tourism secretary Tapan Burman, among others.

 Also present were the state government?s consortium of consultants, as well as advisers and legal consultants of the bidders.

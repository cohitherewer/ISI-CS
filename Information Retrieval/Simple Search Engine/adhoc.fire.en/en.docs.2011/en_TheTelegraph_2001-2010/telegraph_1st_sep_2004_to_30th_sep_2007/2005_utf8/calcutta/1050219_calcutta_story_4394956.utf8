 Synthesised choreography

 Nritya Nirjhar, in association with the department of culture, government of India, presents a unique choreography of dance, directed and performed by Kathak danseuse Prof. Mahananda Kanjilal. A Rhythmic Blend of Kathak and Bharata Natyam, as its title suggests, is a synthesis of the two styles in a performance which harmoniously combines all that is best and beautiful in each classical form. Accompanied by Bharata Natyam dancer Soumen Ghosh, Kanjilal presents three dance items based on Hindu mythological legends. Ardhanariswar, the first piece, depicts Shiva in destructive mood and Durga in her benign, gentle aspects. Taal Rangam, an experimental item, highlights bol of Kathak and jati of Bharata Natyam through alternate performances of the two forms, culminating with a musical combination of tarana and tilana. Anandanshe Hladini, the concluding recital, is based on the Vaishnav Padavali and portrays the divine, eternal love of Lord Krishna and Radha.

 Event: A blend of Kathak and Bharata Natyam

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

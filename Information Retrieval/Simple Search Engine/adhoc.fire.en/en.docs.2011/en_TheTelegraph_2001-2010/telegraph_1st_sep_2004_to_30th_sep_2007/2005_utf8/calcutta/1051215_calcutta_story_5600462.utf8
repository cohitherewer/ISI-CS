The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Designer team, Delhi bound

 - Calcutta couture chooses council credentials over cosmetics call

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Which fashion week to show and be seen at? If that?s been the big question dogging the designer community of the country for the past two weeks, our Calcutta couture brigade seems to have chosen its ramp ? Delhi over Mumbai.

 After meeting the big names on Wednesday, director general of the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) Rathi Vinay Jha told Metro that ?all Calcutta designers? have confirmed participation in the FDCI-hosted India Fashion Week at Delhi, between April 5 and 9, 2006.

 ?Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Anamika Khanna, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Monapali, Shantanu Goenka and Lalit Jalan have all confirmed participation,? stressed Jha.

 This would debar them from the ramp rival of the FDCI show, the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai from March 28 to April 1.

 In a bid to woo out-of-Delhi designers, the FDCI has slashed its fees by a lakh, from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh for the 2006 show. ?The outstation designers would have to incur the costs of coming and putting up in Delhi. So, it?s only fair that we charge them less than the Delhi designers,? justified Jha.

 Said designer Pali Sachdev: ?We are among the founder members of FDCI and there?s no question of deserting the council now? We know that with two fashion weeks, the buyers will get split, but I am sure the council will take care of that.?

 Young designer Shantanu Goenka, however, is confident that ?good buyers will come to the event where there are better designers?.

 ?I enrolled with the FDCI only last year and there?s no question of backing out now. After all, it?s the council body of fashion and I would always want to side with it,? said Shantanu.

 Most other designers, however, were not available for comment on whether they had chosen Delhi over Mumbai. Cosmetic major Lakme, which was the title sponsor of India Fashion Week till 2005, has disassociated itself from the event and announced its own Lakme Fashion Week in association with event production house IMG.

 Vice-president of Lakme Lever, Anil Chopra refused to react to the FDCI claims in Calcutta or disclose the list of designers participating in Lakme Fashion Week. ?We have received applications from the designers with an agreement of privacy and so we cannot disclose whether the Calcutta designers are with us or not,? Chopra told Metro.

 Ever since the announcement of the split on November 30, the council and the cosmetic firm have been at loggerheads over the fashion weeks, one of the main issues being the buyer profile.

 Reacting to industry apprehensions that IMG would take with it the major share of international buyers to Lakme Fashion Week, Jha clarified: ?In the past years, IMG did not get us all the buyers. The buyers were sourced by designers and different agencies and FDCI used to pay for the hospitality. So one has to wait till March when we announce the buyer list to know what we will offer.?

 She also rubbished talk of Sahara being the frontrunner for being the title sponsor at India Fashion Week. ?We will announce the name of our title sponsor next week and Sahara will not be a sponsor for any category,? said Jha.

One of the biggest shopping extravaganzas of Asia ? the Singapore Fashion Festival (SFF) ? is all set to take off in a few days. And like previous years, this time too designers from our very own city are all geared up to dazzle the shopping capital of this part of the world. Fashion bigwigs Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Kiran Uttam Ghosh, along with Delhi-based design honchos JJ Valaya and Sonam Dubal, will rule the ramp at the grand finale of the festival to be held between March 24 and April 3.

 Organised by the Singapore Tourism Board, the annual event aims at establishing it as the biggest fashion hub of Asia and thereby drawing more and more international tourists. Around 50 individual events, comprising exhibitions, in-store promotions and fashion shows by some of the top international names like Versace, YSL and Kenzo, will make up the festival.

 The Indian designers will showcase their works at a consumer-retailer show titled India: Raj Revisited, on April 3. While the four style gurus have designed with an eye on the Singapore market, Indian elements abound in all the collections.

 Says Sabyasachi: ?I have showcased in Singapore before and have a good client base there. The huge Chinese community forms the bulk of the population and hence one has to cater to their tastes. There is a huge demand among them for Indian embroideries and fabrics on Western silhouettes. The Indian kurti also sells quite well.? 

 The young designer adds that most people in Singapore are very ?body conscious? and hence one has to keep that in mind while designing for them.

 A line of Indo-Western clothes makes up Sabya-sachi?s collection, with lots of prints, vibrant colours and layers dominating. ?It?s a young and fun collection, very light and breezy. It?s quite hot in Singapore now and hence light and breezy fabrics are essential,? he reveals.

 Breathable fabrics also form the crux of Kiran?s collection, as the designer gets set to unveil her first linen-only line of clothes. ?I have worked with linen before, but this is the first time I have done a complete collection with the fabric. I thoroughly enjoyed experimenting with linen and the response from friends has being overwhelming, but whether the collection will work for a show is yet to be seen,? she says.

 Lots of drapes in textured fabrics comprise the mainstay of the range, with the palette focussing on all variations of nude, beige and cream, accentuated by smoky pastels. Mosaic-inspired designs and block-prints embellish the clothes. 

 ?Linen is no longer a simple-looking thick breathable fabric. It has come a long way and now linen even looks like silk. I have treated the fabric in a variety of interesting ways. The clothes have a retro mood and take off from the Flapper Girl collection I unveiled last season,? she expands.

 The retro rage is more prominent in Sonam Dubal?s collection, which draws inspiration from the 1930s, ?a period when the world opened its eyes to the aesthetics of Asia?. His line, Memory Reinvented ? Euroasia View, showcases ?how India was important to the world during that period?.

 The spirit and the colours of the era have been incorporated into contemporary silhouettes, says Sonam. ?The collection, like the period, is a celebration of womanhood. It is expected to appeal to the older, well-travelled and experienced woman,? he adds.

 The palette includes Cafe Au Lait and pale blue against black. Oriental silhouettes in merino wool, silk, crepe and chanderi, layered and textured to make wrap blouses and body-fitting crushed tops have been combined with layered pyjamas and striped skirts. Turquoise and zardozi, blended with resham thread and pearl work, have been used to form an embroidered weave and create mid-length jackets, boleros and sherwanis.

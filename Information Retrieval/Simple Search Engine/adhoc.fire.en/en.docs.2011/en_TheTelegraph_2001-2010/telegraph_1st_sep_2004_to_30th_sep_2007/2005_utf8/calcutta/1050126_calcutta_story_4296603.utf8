 Dream children

 In ensuring the overall development of children from the weaker sections of society, Prayasam, a city-based non-profit organisation, is involved in spreading awareness on child rights. In its effort to uplift the lot of underprivileged children, Prayasam has been engaged in nurturing their talents in such a way that they can utilise their special abilities to become economically self-reliant. Ahlladi, the dance-theatre group promoted by Prayasam, is thus dedicated to grooming its children?s skills in the performing arts. Comprising around 40 talented young adults, Ahlladi showcases from its repertoire dance presentations that, apart from displaying their artistic potential, express their hopes for a better, brighter future. Commencing with Guruvandana, the main item, Deyala (infant dreams), focuses on the denied rights of children. It depicts, most poignantly, children trying to rise above the harsh realities of their lives, wistfully dreaming of a life of bliss and happiness.

 Event: Dance recital by Ahlladi, the dance-theatre group of Prayasam

 When: Today at 4 pm

 Where: City Centre Kund, Salt Lake

Father figures, friendship, love and relationships are unlikely topics one would expect stars to bare their souls about. But An Evening with the Stars, hosted by Spandan, Patton and Tollygunge Club, found the four speakers ? Waheeda Rehman, Shabana Azmi, Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen Sharma ? doing just that in front of a huge turnout on the club lawns late on Tuesday.

 Once Renu Roy introduced the star speakers on stage, with two giant screens showing clips from their films, moderator Usha Uthup set the tune for a freewheeling chat. 

 As she switched from Western melodies to Rabindrasangeet, the talk meandered from one topic to another trailing the cues in the songs. And the ladies did not disappoint, providing some rare and candid glimpses into their high-profile lives.

 To start off, the issue at hand was family support and survival against gender bias. ?I wanted to learn Bharatanatyam and my parents were very supportive, which wasn?t an easy thing (for them) to do 50 years ago, and coming from a Muslim family,? said the graceful Waheeda, to huge applause from the crowd.

 ?My father (Kaifi Azmi) was a poet and a member of the progressive writers? association. My mother (Shaukat) was associated with the IPTA. That had a tremendous influence on my political beliefs. And though I always believed that art should be used as an instrument for social change I got sick of it at one point? I guess my father knew what shape I was to take,? smiled Shabana, looking stunning in a gold-rimmed sari. 

 ?I don?t feel I am making any effort (to survive). Often I forget that I am a woman and I like to go beyond the gender divide,? said Konkona. ?I know I need to want something strongly enough to be able to do it. When I started acting, it was very difficult for me to make my parents agree with my decision to work in mainstream films. But I realised that if I didn?t I wouldn?t have had a career,? added her film-maker mother, resplendent in copper-hued silk.

 The talk veered towards the father figures in the women?s lives as Usha crooned My heart belongs to daddy. ?We were four sisters but my father had no regrets that he didn?t have a son,? said Waheeda, to more applause. ?Everyone talks about the influence of my father and my mom doesn?t get any credit. But both my parents have been responsible for what I am today in equal measure,? insisted Shabana.

 ?My father saw a combination of a son and a daughter in me. He had many dreams for me but he never forced them on me. The influence of my parents was both emotional and intellectual,? said Aparna, adding that Satyajit Ray and Utpal Dutt had also been ?profound? influences on her. From the other end, Konkona put in her bit: ?I am so lucky that I have two sets of parents!?

 Amaro porano jaha chay, tumi tai? With Usha rendering the Rabindrasangeet, the chat strayed to love and relationships.

 ?I think we get married with very romantic notions. So, when we have to live with the mundane we find it very difficult,? felt Shabana, stressing the need for emotional preparation before marriage.

 Aparna harped on the need for space as an essential ingredient in any relationship. ?As my girls grew up, I realised that they were individuals and not extensions of me. That?s when our friendship began,? said the mother of two. ?Besides, each successful couple works out how much they will let go and how much they will hold on to,? she added. 

 Waheeda couldn?t have agreed more: ?Love must not be suffocating. You have to let go a lot if you really love.? The youngest of the lot, Konkona, didn?t feel the need to label a relationship. ?I think labelling creates more confusion,? she said.

 The final segment touched upon the various connotations of nationalism, with Usha singing amar desher mati and Aparna explaining the words to Shabana and Waheeda.

 ?I feel the bond with my country more deeply when I am abroad,? admitted Waheeda. ?We don?t even realise how privileged we are for not having been displaced,? added Aparna. ?The composite character and cultural richness of the country is its strength,? summed up Shabana.

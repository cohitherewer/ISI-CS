 SSKM role in baby custody under scan 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to assign a deputy commissioner to probe under what circumstances SSKM Hospital had last month sent a four-month-old girl to Sukanya, a home for abandoned children.

 The girl was admitted to the hospital about four months ago, after the Maidan police found her on Brigade Parade Grounds.

 She was sent to the neonatology department, where she was looked after by nurse Moonmoon Joardar. Once the girl was a month old, Joardar moved the high court, seeking her custody.

 The court directed that the baby be kept in the hospital till further orders, but the SSKM authorities, on the plea that they had not received a copy of the order, sent her to Sukanya.

 Hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi, who received a copy of the earlier verdict only three days ago, said he had followed a first-class magistrate?s order in handing over the baby to Sukanya. 

 ?The girl could not be kept in the neonatology ward any longer. Besides, we did not want to take the risk of keeping her in our hospital for months on end, as several women were turning up to seek her custody,? Tripathi added.

 The state child welfare committee, headed by a first-class magistrate, then asked the hospital to shift the child to a home to ensure her safety. 

 ?The day the magistrate passed the order, we received a letter from Joardar?s advocate, which demanded that the girl be kept in the hospital as per the high court?s directive. But we had not received any copy of the court?s verdict till then, and had no alternative but to shift the baby to a home,? superintendent Tripathi explained.

 Joardar, however, refused to buy the argument and moved court against the hospital authorities.

 She and husband Bikash, who works in the special branch of the city police, have been fighting a marathon ? and till now unresolved ? legal battle to adopt the child. 

 They first moved an application on March 4 in Bankshal court. 

 They argued that they wanted to bring up the girl as they did not have any children. The court, however, rejected the proposal. A fresh application was filed in the same court on March 23, but even that was rejected.

 The Joardars then appealed before the West Bengal Child Care Committee, which asked them to approach the Juvenile Justice Board. Accordingly, they moved the board, but the plea met with the same fate as in Bankshal court.

 The couple finally moved the high court, where Justice Pranab Kumar Chatterjee is hearing the case.

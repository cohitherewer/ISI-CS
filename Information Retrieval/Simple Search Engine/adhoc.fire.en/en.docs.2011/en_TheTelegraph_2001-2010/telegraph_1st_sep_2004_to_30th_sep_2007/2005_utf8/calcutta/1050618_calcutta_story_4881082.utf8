 Hospital blaze, panic

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Panic prevailed at Wockhardt Hospital early on Friday after a fire broke out on the ground floor of the building on Rashbehari Avenue. 

 The fire was detected around 7.45 am, when a few staff members walked in to report for duty and saw smoke billowing out of the hospital?s pharmacy, closed then. 

 When the door was broken, smoke engulfed the entire ground floor and gradually the fire spread to the medical stores and the reception. Fire officers said it was sparked by an electrical short-circuit.

 ?The smoke was a dense, impenetrable screen. We were not sure where the fire was spreading and the patients panicked. We called the supervisors, as we wanted to start our rescue operation,? said a member of the hospital staff who had turned up for her morning duty.

 Some of the hospital staff went about to turn on the fire pump while others got ready to shift the patients who were on the first and second floors to prevent them from being suffocated. 

 The doors on the first and the second floors were flung open and gradually, almost all the patients were removed to the floors above. 

 The nurses and doctors, too, joined in and an alert was sounded. The divisional heads were told about the fire and the engineers of the hospital were pressed into service to coordinate the fire-fighting activity. Three fire tenders with eight officers arrived and they, too, joined the operation. 

 The fire was brought under control within an hour and normality restored within another hour. ?It was a coordinated movement. The patients were shifted fast and some were taken to the roof,? claimed Rupali Basu, general manager of the hospital.

 However, dialysis of around 10 patients on the third floor had to be stopped. It was carried out almost two hours later. According to hospital sources, the fire possibly started at night but with the pharmacy unit closed, it went unnoticed.

 Replicate-Rajarhat prod for townships

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The success of New Town has prompted chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to ask his officials to replicate the Rajarhat model in other upcoming townships that are locked in countless bottlenecks.

 At a recent review meeting with housing minister Goutam Deb, chief secretary Asok Gupta and other senior officials, Bhattacharjee expressed his dismay at the lack of progress in the various township projects across the state. The chief minister, according to sources, has also asked urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya to clear the bottlenecks and speed up work.

 During the late 80s and early 90s, the government had planned townships in Howrah, Dankuni, Sonarpur, Baruipur, Siliguri, Haldia and Asansol to ease the burgeoning load on Calcutta. 

 The progress in all these projects has been far from satisfactory.

 Urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar attributed the delay to legal hurdles, problems faced during land acquisition and other formalities.

 Minister Bhattacharya, however, said work in Asansol and Siliguri was progressing well, and would start soon in Dankuni and Baruipur. 

 ?The Salem group, which will implement the West Howrah project, has told us it will start work soon. I have asked officials to ensure the project is not delayed,? he added.

 In contrast to these projects is New Town, where demand for plots ? residential and commercial ? is multiplying by the day. At the review meeting, the chief minister expressed satisfaction over the progress. 

 Brainchild of housing minister Deb, the project was flagged off on June 1, 1995, by then chief minister Jyoti Basu, in the presence of Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Ajit Panja. Explaining the reasons for the success, Deb said he had always tried to avoid ?formalities, bureaucracy and red tape?.

 Instead of initiating the land-acquisition process, the government had purchased plots directly from the owners, who were paid on the spot. ?Private developers, representatives of all political parties and local residents were involved in the exercise,? Deb elaborated.

 ?Though the project was flagged off in 1995, we actually started work in 1999. Much time was taken in building the eight-lane bridge, the entry point to the township from Salt Lake. It was not easy to set up the infrastructure in just six years, working seven months a year. Still, we are on time,? Deb maintained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Films, not for Cannes, crossover or cash

 After stunning critics with offbeat films like Is Raat Ki Subaah Nahin, he failed to find mass favour with Chameli and Calcutta Mail. Now, director SUDHIR MISHRA is back at his arty best with his new film, the Indo-French co-production Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, to be released on February 18. The film-maker talks to Pratim D. Gupta about the politics of being apolitical.

 lt;You have been using emails and SMSs to promote Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi. Why?

 It is a film of a different nature. Films like these do not have such big budgets for marketing and promotion. Also, through the modes of emails and SMSs, I am trying to reach out to like-minded people. In our film industry in this age of marketing blitzkrieg, with a budget of Rs 5 crore, you do not enter into the consciousness. I consider Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi my best and most personal work. Nobody sitting here in Mumbai makes films like this. Come on, life is more than just about loving your parents!

 So, what exactly is life about?

 See, I too had and still have many other alternatives. But I chose to make a film about the genius of India and its problems. I have used a historical perspective of India to get at the contemporary scenario. I want the film to start some kind of a debate or conversation among film enthusiasts. I don?t believe in the na?ve view that films are apolitical. I don?t make films for Cannes, crossover or cash.

 Shekhar Kapoor calls Hazaaron... 

the most important film to come out of India in a long, long time. Why do you 

think he says that?

 Hazaaron? is about people who do not like the India they inherited from their parents but at the same time love it enough to criticise it. The contradictions of the 70s were very sharp. The film in that way is inspired by life. There is a connect with something which actually happened in the country. Perhaps, people like Shekhar, Dev Benegal, Ashutosh Gowariker are in a better position to talk about the film more objectively.

 Ketan Mehta calls it a brave film...

 Nothing like this has been attempted before in Indian cinema. I?ve used the form of a qawwali for the film. It starts with an alaap and then finally goes into a frenzy. I feel there are more people in Calcutta with this bent of mind than in Mumbai. Again, the film is not that sensational either.

 So is it a reflection of the turbulent times 

of the 70s?

 You get the essence of the time through the characters. A film needs to rise above the article of the times.

 Why have you gone for a new face for you 

main character of Geeta, the female protagonist?

 I wanted someone who has never been seen before. That?s because such a character has never been seen before. We trace the girl from her college life romance to marrying a different man to leaving her husband to getting back to her lover and then again choosing another man. In normal Indian films she would be considered a slut. But there are real people like her. 

 I am against all those feminist film-makers who make their characters say: ?I am a woman.? A woman can be with a friend and yet be alone. So for Geeta, I didn?t take a known face as it would have brought with it an image.

 Both the newcomers, Chitrangada and Roshan, 

along with Kay Kay, have been a revelation at the festivals...

 A famous Golden Bear-winning German film-maker called the film a masterpiece and told me: ?The actors in your film must be big stars in India.? I told him, no one knows the actors, yet. Yes, they have given very good performances. All are very restrained. They had the difficult task of hiding emotions in the film.

 Do you show people from history in your 

film?

 You will recognise people from history but I haven?t used names. The film is strictly in the realms of fiction. There is the presence of Indira Gandhi throughout the film. Her power runs through the film as a subtext. I didn?t want to use names because that then becomes gossip. I am more interested in the essence and the impact.

 A lot of people have seen the film at the 

festivals and private screenings already...

 Yes, the film has travelled a lot of festivals. And I wanted to plan it like that. There was a total of five trial shows in Mumbai. I have also had to plan the French release at the same time since it?s an Indo-French co-production. All this had to be done very carefully in this day of piracy.

 But you have had a tough time finding distributors 

in this country...

 There has been a lot of problem with distributors. So most producers are releasing their films themselves. The cost of marketing has become so high that it is really difficult for small films. The vernacular people have disappeared from Indian cinema. It is always about NRIs, the diaspora and the upper-class people from Mumbai.

 Do you think one single film like yours 

can open up another phase of New Indian cinema?

 The young film-makers are doing good work, too. Anurag Kashyap?s there. Then there?s Ashutosh, Farhan (Akhtar), (Sanjay Leela) Bhansali, also Vinod (Chopra). But they are not bringing themselves into their stories. They should come out and tell their personal stories.

 You have made commercial films like Chameli 

and Calcutta Mail and now you have gone back to more offbeat fare again 

with Hazaaron... How difficult is it to switch between the styles?

 I consider myself to be a teller of tales. They can be personal or about an event or for that matter anything. At the end of the day, I?m a storyteller ? the old man under a tree. You may not like Chameli or Calcutta Mail, but you can?t say that the man does not know how to make films. I like to connect with the audience of my country. I prefer a mass base. I want to be a Lok Sabha member and not a Rajya Sabha one. I am bored with festivals. I am not ready to make ?simplistic Indian films? for the European market. I want to make films on my own steam. 

 But the French must have had a say in this 

co-production...

 No. They didn?t. They help you but they also help themselves. So their contribution comes in kind ? technical people and the set-up. I used their cameraman, editor and sound recordist. I also used their raw stock and sound equipment and did my post-production work there.

 What is your take on the French model of 

film-making?

 They have a great system. The Indian state should learn from them how to help people make better films. They tax you so heavily that you can only make Shah Rukh Khan films. They do not consider culture as development at all. When Akbar rules, Tansen sings. When Aurangzeb rules, music stops. You should allow some talented people to live or everyone will migrate abroad. Here, a scientist dies a pauper after slugging it out all his life and a two-bit model lives super rich. But that?s the country P. Chidambaram likes.

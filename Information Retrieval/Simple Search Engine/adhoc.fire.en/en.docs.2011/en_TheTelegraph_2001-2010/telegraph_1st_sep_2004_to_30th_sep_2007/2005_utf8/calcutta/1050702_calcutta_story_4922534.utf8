 The Murshidabad nawab?s building and the surrounding vast plot of land at 85, Park Street had been taken over by the West Bengal government?s judicial department. But the five-bigha plot is in bad shape. The two huge wooden gates at the main entrance to the premises were broken. Then the gates were taken away part by part by urchins and passers-by. The open space in front of a second gate has now turned into a urinal. The signboard indicating that the estate belonged to the government is now illegible. Will the department deploy personnel to guard the premises? Also, it should at least erect a bamboo fence to keep away unwanted visitors.

 Two government-run schools are situated on Maharani Swarnamoyee Road, with their entrances on the narrow and short stretch between Canal West Road and APC Road. During school hours the road is blocked with school buses/pool cars and other vehicles plying in both directions. Several trucks carrying untanned animal skin are parked on the road and are even washed there. Also, a portion of the footpath is encroached upon by eateries. Schoolchildren face immense trouble while walking on the stretch. Authorities must immediately take measures for the sake of their safety.

 Indane gas distributors in our locality keep their shops closed on Sundays. Many subscribers are employed and are unavailable at home during the daytime on weekdays. It would be appreciated if the offices are open over the weekend and the LPG cylinders are delivered to such subscribers on Sundays.

 Apropos ?Power peril next door?, published on June 22 in this column, CESC distribution transformer, Deshbandhu Nagar P/T, was commissioned on October 31, 1987, after obtaining approval from Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality. The building at BE/1/1/A, Deshbandhu Nagar, in Bagmati, came up more than 10 years later. The building?s main entrance is constructed in such a way that there is no hindrance in vehicular movement through the same because of the transformer, which is at a safe distance from the structure. All sorts of safety arrangements by CESC are built into the transformer and it produces negligible sound. CESC is ready to relocate the transformer to a suitable alternate site, but in that case the complainant has to bear the expenses for the same. This point has already been conveyed to the complainant through a series of letters. But no confirmation to this effect has been received by us as yet. CESC engineers have visited the site quite a few times and explained the above-mentioned facts either to the complainant or his representative. We have also written to the state environment department on the issue.

 Biswarup Mukherjee, 

 Manager, public relations, CESC.

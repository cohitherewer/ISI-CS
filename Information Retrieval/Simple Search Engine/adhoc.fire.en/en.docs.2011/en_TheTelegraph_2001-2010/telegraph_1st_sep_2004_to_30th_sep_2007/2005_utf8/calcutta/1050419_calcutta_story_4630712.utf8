 Classes empty, campus aflutter

 - Arts faculty joins boycott, JU authorities await replies to showcause

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The conflict on the Jadavpur University (JU) campus intensified on Monday, with a section of students from the arts faculty rallying to the boycott call by the science and the engineering and technology streams. 

 The protest point: the authorities? decision to first expel and then showcause five senior students as to why they should not be expelled in an earlier case of campus violence.

 A Monday marked by deserted classrooms also saw members of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) taking the first step towards boycotting the forthcoming semester examinations by opposing the distribution of admit cards. The exams are scheduled from April 25.

 ?The students? agitation is carrying on. We have not done anything as yet, since the five students who were showcaused have not sent in their replies. Their deadline expires on Wednesday, April 20, at 5.30 pm,? said JU registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay.

 The varsity unit of the All India Democratic Students? Organisation (Aidso) appealed to students of the arts faculty to boycott classes in solidarity with the science and the engineering and technology faculties.

 ?We feel that the decision is unjustified, undemocratic and inhuman, because expulsion is synonymous with a death sentence for students,? said Aidso representative Rajgopal.

 ?The authorities are even said to be taking a decision that from the next academic year, students will have to sign a declaration that they won?t participate in any protest movement. That means they?ll be forced to accept all undemocratic decisions taken by the authorities,? he alleged.

 Representatives of Fetsu and the science faculty students? union (SFSU) met Manoj Mitra, dean of the engineering faculty and acting vice-chancellor, in two different delegations and handed him separate memoranda. ?We are waiting for the submissions of the five students. We can not arrive at a decision before that,? Mitra told the delegations.

 Fetsu and SFSU members held a series of general body meetings through the day to chart out their future course of action, debating on whether or not to boycott the semester examinations. 

 Even the Students? Federation of India (SFI), which dominates the arts faculty, distributed leaflets appealing to students to support the five senior students. ?We will be happy if the students reply to the showcause notice? We do not want these students to be marked as criminals. We don?t want the authorities to dictate the students? movements,? the leaflet read.

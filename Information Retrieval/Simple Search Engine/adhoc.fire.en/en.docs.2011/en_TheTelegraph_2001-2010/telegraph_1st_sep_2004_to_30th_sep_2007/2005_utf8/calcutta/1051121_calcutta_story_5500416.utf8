 Some fashion but a whole lot of show ? thats what characterised Fashion Fusion Nite on Saturday evening.

 Held on the Saturday Club lawns, the Nite showcased the ensembles of designer Jyoti Khaitan on the ramp.

 Spread over four sequences, the show was punctuated by Renu Roy of Spandan and Saturday Club introducing the chief guests for the evening. Or maybe the introductions were punctuated by the four fashion sequences.

 Fashion Fusion Nite began with Francis Lepcha belting out some ever-popular old numbers ? from Lady in red to Last Christmas. 

 Soon, the fast-paced tempo of haseena zulfon wali gave the show quite a kick-start, complete with actress Junes rock--roll act in an orange sari.

 The first sequence showcased a line of pretty pink saris and salwar kurtas. Flowing georgettes and silver shimmer highlighted this pristine collection.

 Quite an impressive start, but not for too long, since the world ? and its cousin ? was waiting to be called on to ramp.

 Tanmoy Bose, Swastika Mukherjee, Arjun and Nilanjana Chakraborty, Arindam Sil, Sanjay Budhia, Bikram and Jaya Ghosh, Wasim Kapoor, Alokananda Ray and Rita Bhimani ? all special guests for the evening, and all called on stage to talk about style and, of course, Jyoti Khaitan.

 Thrown in, somewhere, few and far between, were the rest of the three fashion sequences. Instrumental notes of Mere sapnon ki rani floated in the air when it was time for the second sequence.

 This was based on the mission of mauves and yellows, where one was treated to innovative sari drapes and interesting blouses.

 The third round, the fusion collection, showcased the black line. Mostly jackets and blazers that were teamed with saris and flared skirts.

 The silhouette, though pegged to be non-fuss and neat, could have done with some more detailing and structuring.

 Finally, the show stopper of the evening came in the form of the bridal sequence. This range of outfits was ornate and opulent, and quite worth the wait ? and the words.

 Crystal saris and flowy lehngas, all studded with semi-precious stones, rubies and sapphires lent a sparkling shimmer to the ramp. Lovely colours and dazzling embellishments marked this line.

 The models who walked the ramp on Saturday evening were Tanushree, Priyanka Pal, Sudipta, Jessica, Riya, Pooja and Indrani. June and Sayantani took care of the Tollywood glamour quota.

 Curled tresses with delicate floral headgear, shimmery pink eyes and a glossy mouth set the style statement for the catwalk.

 The choreography? Well, very Calcutta, to be politically correct. It was laidback and relaxed for some, slow and sleepy for the rest.

 The audience verdict: Great bridal collection, great snacks, great weather and a great volume of words.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 System switch behind snags 

 SAMAR KUMAR CHAKRABORTY, chief general manager, Calcutta Telephones, met readers of The Telegraph in his office on Friday to answer their queries. Participants included Diptimoy Ghosh, A.K. Sen, P.K. Bal, Kajal Bose, Md Sharique Ehsan, Lalit Singh Nahar, Subhadyuti Datta, C.N. Bhattacharya, Sourish Misra, K.N. Jha, Subhas Sarkar and Jitendranath Das

Kajal Bose: You have about 350,000 mobile subscribers who regularly face problems of tower failure and non-receipt of bills. Your employees behave rudely when the customers try to lodge a complaint. Can?t you improve your client servicing?

 You have reasons to feel aggrieved. Revamp of the client servicing is currently on. I think you will be able to notice the difference from the last week of January.

 The technical problems are due to the shift from Ericsson to the Nortel system. To ensure that the customers are not shortchanged, we have decided to extend the validity of prepaid cards expiring in December by 15 days.

 You must remember that Calcutta Telephones is a new entrant into the mobile phone market. Please give us some time. 

Diptimoy Ghosh: My landline set has been causing problems ever since installation. All that the local exchange is offering me is a repaired second-hand set. Am I not being deprived unduly? Why shouldn?t I get a new set?

 Of course, you are being deprived. You are entitled to a new set. Anyone facing this kind of a problem should call me. There is no shortage of new receivers.

Lalit Singh Nahar: I got an inflated bill in 1999. I appealed to the telephone adalat for revision, but since then my phone has not been working. 

 Please submit a written application to me, I will look into the matter. Your connection will be restored and the outstanding amount will be negotiated subsequently. Those owing a huge sum, can pay in installments. 

Kajal Bose: Residents of Baruipur and Sonarpur do not get access to the DataOne broadband service.

 Please give us another month. All telephone exchanges between Kalyani and Budge Budge, on either bank of the Hooghly, will get broadband switching equipment by January 15. Over 70 per cent of the exchanges already have the equipment.

A.K. Sen: Why has the special concession for elderly subscribers of DataOne been withdrawn?

 Our policy was not to charge rent or registration fee for the first two months from senior citizens. If you appeal to us, we can charge half the rate. 

Diptimoy Ghosh: It is surprising that you have introduced attractive cellular plans for everyone except senior citizens. 

 We are thinking along those lines. But I feel that elderly people find it inconvenient to use mobile phones. They should retain their landlines, because they will soon be able to enjoy videos and avail e-medicine facilities through broadband. 

 With this end in view, we have decided to conduct a computer training programme for senior citizens. Out of 200 respondents, 40 have been chosen for the training.

Md Sharique Ehsan: I surrendered my landline in October and took up a cable broadband connection. My security deposit hasn?t been refunded.

 You need not worry about the refund. But your decision was not prudent. 

Subhas Sarkar: Why are there technical glitches in the dial-up Internet service?

 Switch over to broadband. The number of people taking up broadband connections has exceeded our expectations. We had not expected more than 4,000 users to log in at a particular point of time. But the number has shot up over 10,000.

 Half-an-hour of internet surfing every day will be cheaper with a broadband connection.

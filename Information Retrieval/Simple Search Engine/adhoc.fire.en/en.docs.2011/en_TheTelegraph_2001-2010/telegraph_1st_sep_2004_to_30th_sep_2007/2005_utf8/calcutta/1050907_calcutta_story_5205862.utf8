 Bhabatosh Sutar

 Puja theme-maker (Srishti in Behala, and others)

 I have no problems with the restrictions. Whenever something comes into focus, it gains importance. It is prudent to plan a puja with the available space in mind. Perhaps the restrictions will dent collections from stalls. But rules are always in favour of some and against others. It is not right to indulge in celebrations causing inconvenience to others. Only a few pujas have the space or the financial muscle to put up stalls. The rest will not be affected. Also, grandeur is not a matter of outward show. Puja is in our blood, in our heart. How can a set of rules curb it? Every year, puja organisers pass through so many problems and frustrations. Yet, the next year, the same people gear up for another edition of the Puja. The show never stops.

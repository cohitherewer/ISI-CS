Makeover on the move

HHeading for a party straight from a hectic 

day at work doesnt leave much scope for spending time in front of the mirror. 

Smita Roy Chowdhury tells you how to get your fashion act together in minutes

Caught up in office till 9 at night and you have a 

colleague?s wedding to attend or hit a party where you really want to catch someone?s 

eye. But work?s taking longer than you expected and there?s just no time to rush 

back home to change. The situation might sound familiar to most busy souls, slogging 

it out in a 24x7 world.

While the luxury of spending hours in front of the 

mirror before heading for a social do has long been a no-no for women on the move, 

there are some relatively easy ways to ensure you don?t go looking overworked 

and under-dressed. Your schedule might allow all of 15 minutes in the office washroom 

to transform yourself from Plain Jane to smart and stylish. And you don?t exactly 

have a fairy godmother to come to your aid, but you still have to weave the Cinderella 

magic somehow. This is how...

Accessorise it

The simplest of outfits can be jazzed up to immense 

effect with the help of the right accessories. Tuck in a pair of party shoes under 

the car seat before you leave for work in the morning and also throw in a gorgeous 

handbag. Add an ornate belt and some junk jewellery in your purse. Says fashion 

designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh: ?Interesting shoes and bags can go a long way to bring 

about a quick change in your appearance. I have a green crocodile leather bag 

that?s a favourite for parties. I just leave my large beige office bag in the 

car and carry that one while going to a party.?

Slip on a heavy stone-studded belt with the jeans 

that you had been wearing the whole day and casual chic is the statement you?ll 

succeed in making. Some bold junk jewellery for the hands, neck and ears, co-ordinated 

with the colour of your outfit, will help bring about a dressier look. 

Another accessory that can add glamour to just about 

any kind of work wear is the scarf. If it?s a winter night out, opt for a multi-coloured 

woollen muffler to pep up any simple solid coloured shirt. But if the weather 

is not conducive to wool, drape a silk one that can either match your garment 

or be a total contrast.

Hair accessories can also add value to the fashion 

factor. A set of tortoise-shell combs or some stone-studded hair clips ? you can 

choose according to the length of your hair and the overall look. 

Clothes wise

Since you?ll have to wear the same clothes you?ve 

been wearing all day at work, choosing the right fabric is important. Most offices 

these days don?t have a dress code, but there are some unwritten limitations about 

the kind of outfits one can wear. So anything flashy or overtly glamourous will 

have to be ruled out. Stick to something simple yet elegant. ?Anti-wrinkle fabrics 

are just perfect for all-day wear. Linen and cotton are best avoided as they tend 

to get crushed and become unwearable to a party after a long day?s work. Light 

fabrics like crepe, georgette or even silks are good bets,? says Kiran.

Winter gives you the perfect opportunity to throw 

a sexy jacket over your shirt and trousers. You can opt for one that?s fitted 

at the waist to give a blazer-like feel, either in tweed or denim. ?With a calf-length 

coat over a short top or a tussar jacket over a pant suit you will be ready 

to hit the cocktail circuit,? feels designer Sucheta Mehr.

With ethnic wear, however, the rules are quite different. 

If you are wearing a simple salwar kameez to work, carry an ornate dupatta 

that you can drape before setting out.

Face lift

You can get away with the most ordinary outfit if 

the look on your eyes, cheeks and lips are right. Make-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar 

points out the must-haves in your handbag ? kohl pencil, lip gloss, lipstick and 

compact. ?These essentials can help transform your look. If possible, also keep 

wet tissues to dab your face before you apply the foundation,? says Chakladar.

Wet one side of the sponge, rub it on the compact 

and apply a coat as the base. Apply another coat with the dry side of the sponge. 

Highlight the eyes with kohl and after you?ve applied the lipstick, touch it up 

with gloss. Blush-on and eye shadow can go wrong if applied in a hurry, so go 

for them only if you?re confident.

An elaborate hairstyle will be hard to put together 

when time is a constraint, so the best option would be to keep your hair open. 

If you have wavy hair, sport the moist look by wetting it. Wet straight hair might 

look scanty, so avoid that and instead spray some serum for shine and brush it 

well.

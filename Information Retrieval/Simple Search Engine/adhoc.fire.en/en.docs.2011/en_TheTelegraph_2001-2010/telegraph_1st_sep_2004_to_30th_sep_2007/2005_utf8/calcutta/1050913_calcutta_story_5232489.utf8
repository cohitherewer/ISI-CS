 Babli, Bappi, bustee

 After Oye Bubbly and Bunty Aur Babli, it?s Babli time. This one?s a Tollywood potboiler on a tomboyish bustee girl who romances a taxi-driver but is willing to sacrifice everything for her younger brother.

 ?We are trying a different type of story in this film. The brother-sister relationship is the mainstay here,? said Babli, aka Rituparna Sengupta, on Saturday evening, Bappi Lahiri by her side.

 The Mumbai-based musician is roping in a bunch of Bollywood names to croon to his tunes in Babli. There?s Asha Bhonsle, Alka Yagnik, Shreya Ghosal, Sunidhi Chauhan, Shaan, Babul Supriyo and Usha Uthup.

 ?I had tried Kunal Ganjawala but he has some problems with Bangla pronunciation. I am also trying Sonu Nigam... And will be doing something new in Babli. For a thriving business in the audio market we need to bring in Bollywood singers,? said Bappi-da, a trifle apologetically. ?But in my forthcoming release Chirasakha, on Rabindranath Tagore?s life directed by Bandana Mukherjee, I have taken Calcutta artistes like Srikanta Acharya, Shubhamita and others,? asserted the musician with a mesh of gold chains.

 To be directed by Subhas Sen, Babli features Oriya hero Anubhav Mohanty as the main man. But before Babli goes on the floors, Rituparna is gearing up to test the Bollywood waters with Chandan Arora?s Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh, on October 9.

 ?It?s very unfortunate that the Vikram Bhatt film with me is not happening any more,? she chirped. Rituparna has recently forayed into television production with a non-fiction serial, Bou Maa. To be aired on Doordarshan Monday to Wednesday, the serial will feature Labony Sarkar and Koneenica Banerjee as the main anchors, with Rituparna making speacial appearances.

 Next up on the leading lady?s agenda is shooting a song in Singapore for Bouma Zindabad, the second film from her production house Prism Entertainment. Rituparna?s also looking forward to Anuranon, to be directed by Tony, for which the actress had a workshop along with co-actors Rahul Bose and Raima Sen under Sohag Sen?s supervision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Subhas code for decoders

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Subhas Chakraborty: The cable guy

 This is to inform you that a new company? has been formed with the intent of functioning as a multi-system operator in and around the city of Calcutta. In this context you are requested to provide them with the decoder boxes? so that they are able to start commercial operation within next 15 days.

 A missive from a state minister has seldom been clearer ? or seldom had less to do with portfolio or protocol. But try telling that to the sender.

 In a letter addressed to the regional heads of broadcasters of channels such as STAR Plus, Sony, ESPN, STAR Sports and Zee TV, sports and youth affairs minister Subhas Chakraborty has set a deadline of 15 days for providing the beam to an upcoming MSO.

 The one-page letter, written on Chakraborty?s letterhead and bearing his signature, was hand-delivered to broadcasters on Friday. The letter is dated November 9.

 It informs the recipient that M/s Metro Broadband Services has been formed by an Apurba Banerjee and other ?bona fide cable TV operators for over a decade?. Chakraborty then ?requests? the broadcaster to provide the decoder boxes ? required for receiving the signals ? at the earliest to the new company.

 The minister maintains that he has only made a ?request?. ?I?ve written the letter so that more people get to see the channels,? he told Metro on way to Halishahar on Friday evening.

 But shouldn?t a broadcaster?s decision to provide signals to cable operators be under the purview of the information and cultural affairs department and not sports and youth affairs?

 ?I?m the seniormost minister in West Bengal. I can always make a request. If they don?t like it, they can tear and throw the document away,? Chakraborty exploded.

 On a quieter note, why recommend a particular company when others are planning similar moves? Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseba, for instance, which demonstrated at the offices of SET Discovery earlier this week, demanding decoder boxes? ?They (Metro Broadband Services) were the only ones who approached me,? said the minister.

 The channels themselves are playing it safe. ?We are yet to receive a formal business proposal from the concerned MSO, so it?s strange that the minister should have written this note. But we are treating it as a request only,? said an entertainment bouquet official.

 Political intervention in cable conflicts has so far been behind-the-scenes. Minister Chakraborty has just put an official stamp on it.

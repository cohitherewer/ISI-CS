 New swipers on the block

 - Two of three-man gang of cell phone thieves rounded up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pandal-hopping teenagers and youths, too occupied with themselves, were unaware that a new but well-organised gang was on the prowl, waiting for an opportune moment to steal their mobile phones. 

 The three-member gang?s existence came to light on Thursday night, when officers of Rajarhat police station arrested two and recovered 16 mobile phones from them. All were stolen on the Puja days.

 ?To prevent such thefts, we had arrested scores of known criminals, including snatchers, before the Pujas. But this gang is new and was operating from Barasat. Still, we could arrest two of the three members, Raja Chandra and Kalu. We are looking for the third member,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.

 Officers said the three operated between Ultadanga and Barasat during the Puja and their target group comprised mostly teenagers.

 Stolen mobiles are sold at a nominal price. ?Sometimes, the sets are sent outside through a interstate racket and sold at one-third the price, depending on their condition. We are interrogating Raja and Kalu to know about the modus operandi of the racket,? Kumar added.

 Police stepped up vigil on public vehicles and in pandals of the area after they received two complaints of mobile phone thefts on Sashthi evening. 

 ?We immediately zeroed in on the known mobile snatchers, but found they were not involved. We realised a new gang had entered the scene and alerted our sources,? said an investigating officer.

 Accordingly, sleuths in plainclothes boarded several private buses and kept a vigil. 

 Some sleuths were posted at Golaghata and Sribhumi, which draw huge crowds during the Pujas.

 On Thursday, acting on a tip-off, sleuths rounded up Raja after he boarded an airport-bound bus. Moments before, he had stolen a mobile phone. 

 ?We could identify him as our sources had briefed us what he looked like. He was arrested when the bus reached the airport,? said an officer. 

 Interrogating him, sleuths came to know about Kalu and a third accomplice. 

 Kalu was arrested in Rajarhat. Fifteen mobile phones were seized from him, police superintendent Kumar said.

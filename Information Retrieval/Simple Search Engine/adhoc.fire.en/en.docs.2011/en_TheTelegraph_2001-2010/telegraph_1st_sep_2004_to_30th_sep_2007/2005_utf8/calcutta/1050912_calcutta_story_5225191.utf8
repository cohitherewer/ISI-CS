The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Students in pass-or-quit quandary

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Around 4,000 students, admitted a month ago to management courses in private engineering colleges for fees ranging between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh, stand the risk of being thrown out.

 Their fate will be decided on Monday, when they appear for a test to be conducted by West Bengal University of Technology, to which the colleges are affiliated. According to the university, those who fail the test will have their admission cancelled.

 University officials blame the colleges for the soup the students find themselves in. The institutes, they say, had admitted the students after an interview, violating a government rule that admission to three-year management degree courses in affiliated colleges must be on the basis of the common entrance test (CET) the university conducts.

 Sources in the university said most colleges had filled up only a few seats with candidates who had cleared the CET. The rest were filled up through an interview held by the colleges themselves.

 ?The university has a rule that every student of its management courses must be admitted through the university-conducted CET,? said registrar Samir Bandopadhyay. ?The rule was introduced to ensure a decent academic standard of the courses.?

 The colleges, however, have put forward an excuse for bypassing the university?s diktat. ?We had to admit students through our own selection procedure because the university had failed to provide us with adequate numbers,? said Manoj Joshi, of the George Telegraph group of institutions. ?We cannot leave so many seats vacant, as we do not receive any government grant and depend solely on students? fees.?

 Whoever is to be blamed, it is the students who are suffering, and for no fault of theirs. However, registrar Bandopadhyay, while asserting that students would not be registered if they failed the test, had some kind words for them. 

 He said the university was considering making the test simple, to reduce chances of failure. ?Since the students are not at fault, we are trying to make this ratification exercise simple.?

 The courses to which the students have been admitted on the basis of an interview are business administration, computer applications, travel and tourism management, hospitality management, insurance and risk management, media science and supply chain management.

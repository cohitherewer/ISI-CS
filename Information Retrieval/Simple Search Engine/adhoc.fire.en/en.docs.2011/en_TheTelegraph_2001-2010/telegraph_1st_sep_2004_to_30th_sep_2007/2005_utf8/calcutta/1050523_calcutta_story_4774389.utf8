 Natassha: Switching screens

 It?s difficult to balance careers in television and films. Either you are too good for one or too bad for the other. But Balaji-find Natassha is one actress who has a hit serial running on the small screen and a forthcoming release on the big.

 After flooring Ektaa Kapoor with her performance as the docile bahu in STAR?s afternoon show, Kabhi Souten Kabhi Saheli, Natassha made her debut in Bollywood with the Balaji-backed Koi To Hai. While the I Know What You Did Last Summer rip-off couldn?t garner her a hit, her other Balaji film Krishna Cottage gave her the hit charbuster Bindaas to gyrate to.

 But it was the small screen where Natassha, who changed her name from Anita (another of those Ekta numerologies at work) scored again as the beautiful Anjali in Amrita Singh?s comeback vehicle, STAR Plus?s prime-time moneychurner, Kkavyanjali.

 Having already made a name for herself in Tamil and Telugu films after her small-screen success, Natassha is all set to try her luck again in Bollywood.

 With as many as three releases waiting to hit the screens, Natassha is hopeful of a better response after her horrific first outing in tinsel town. While Khalid Mohamed?s Silsiilay is set to release in the coming weeks, Natassha also has a romantic comedy named Ek Se Bare Do and, of course, Ektaa?s next big-screen project Koi Aapsa.

 But first, all eyes should be on Wednesday night as Natassha performs at the STAR Parivaar awards. Her Anjali may trail behind Mona Vasu?s Miilee in the voting for Favourite New Sadasya category, but if the practice sessions are anything to go by, Natassha should rock the starry, starry night.

 Lion King: All-time favourite

 It?s a fun-filled summer for kids on Disney Channel. A host of celebrities is featured when the movie of the month, Lion King, debuts on the new channel on May 28. The film is being promoted with the campaign ?har dil mein hai ek Lion King?, featuring Bollywood stars Saif Ali Khan, Akshay Kumar and Bobby Deol speaking about how they identify with the movie and its characters.

 Kid role models such as Harbhajan Singh, Bipasha Basu, Shah Rukh Khan and Vivek Oberoi also share their favourite Hakunamatata (the song from the movie that says ?have no worries?) moments.

 The double-Oscar-winning animation film is the story of Simba, a young lion cub whose father Mufasa is murdered by his own brother, Scar. The murderer then convinces Simba that Mufasa?s death was his fault and drives him to a self-imposed exile. In the desert, Simba is befriended by a meerkat Timon and a warthog Pumba. Along with them and his childhood lioness friend Nala, Simba plans to return to claim what is rightfully his. Is he able to? Find out on May 28 at 6 pm.

 Disney Channel has also revamped its schedule for kids enjoying the summer vacation. Around 180 movies will be aired during the 60-day period. These include all-time favourites like Aladdin, Jungle Book, Treasure Island, 101 Dalmatians, Beauty and the Beast, Return of Jafar, Pocahontas and Snow White.

 Disney?s ongoing Heroes 4 Aladdin contest with an Arabian Nights holiday to Egypt as the grand prize has already received 1.25 lakh entries.

 The joys of parenthood are tempered by the unexpected hilarity of bringing up babies in a new season of Yes, Dear beginning on Monday, May 23, at 9 pm on STAR World. The comedy about two young couples and their outrageously contrasting views on parenting is back in the third season. 

 Greg (Anthony Clark) and Kim Warner (Jean Louisa Kelly) struggle to be perfect parents. Kim is a neurotic stay-at-home mother determined to be perfect, Greg is professionally successful but has a tough time keeping his wife calm as they raise their two kids. 

 But Kim?s sister Christine Hughes (Liza Snyder), a very down-to-earth mother of two, reminds her that life will never be perfect. Her husband Jimmy (Mike O?Malley) often feels compelled to share his philosophy about being a husband and parent while still remaining a man with Greg, whether he wants to hear it or not. 

 In the first episode of season three (which is still on in the US), Spanks, but no Spanks, when Christine catches Dominic lying again, she goes to Jimmy. But when Jimmy?s tough talk doesn?t stop their son from lying, he plans to give Dominic his first spanking, against Kim?s advice. 

 Executive producer Alan Kirschenbaum says: ?We looked like the very formula, old-fashioned choice. But appearances can be deceiving. This show has always had a lot more going on than people gave us credit for.?

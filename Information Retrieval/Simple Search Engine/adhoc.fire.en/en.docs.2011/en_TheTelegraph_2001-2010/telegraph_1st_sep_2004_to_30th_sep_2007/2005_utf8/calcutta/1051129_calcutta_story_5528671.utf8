 Pounds for impounded vehicles

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The next time a car is held for tax evasion, chances are it will end up in a pound.

 After scouting for suitable sites for months, the transport department has chosen Dhulagarh and Budge Budge truck terminals, as well as a plot close to the Salt Lake stadium, to park the impounded vehicles.

 According to Motor Vehicles Act, a vehicle can be impounded if the driver fails to furnish his driving licence or registration papers. 

 Other reasons for seizure include tax evasion, plying without permits, or if the vehicle lies abandoned.

 ?We?ll issue an order declaring these sites as car and truck pounds,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury. ?Henceforth, all impounded vehicles will be parked at these places. Since we didn?t have a car pound, we had a problem parking impounded vehicles. We?re now working on details like security at the sites and insurance for vehicles.?

 According to Chowdhury, his department will mainly target overloaded trucks and tax-evaders.

 ?The Supreme Court has recently ruled that overloaded vehicles cannot be released on payment of fines. They have to be impounded. Cases are being registered daily against such vehicles, but offences are still mounting,? he added.

 The Dhulagarh and Budge Budge truck terminals have space for around 500 trucks each. The terminals will pass on a percentage of the fee charged to the transport department.

 The department had floated tenders seeking expressions of interest from private parties to set up pounds. ?But we didn?t get good offers in the first round. We intend to have a full-fledged car pound and a truck pound. But that will be in addition to these sites,? said a source.

 Officers admitted that lack of parking space stood in the way of impounding errant vehicles. ?As we don?t have space for the number of vehicles that should have been impounded, we issue notices to offenders and seize the papers. Instead of responding to the notice, owners tend to duplicate papers in North and South 24-Parganas,? said a public vehicles department source.

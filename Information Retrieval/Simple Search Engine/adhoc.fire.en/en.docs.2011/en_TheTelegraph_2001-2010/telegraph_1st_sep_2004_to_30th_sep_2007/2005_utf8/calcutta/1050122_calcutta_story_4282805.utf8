 Motherhood after kidney transplant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Impossible as it may sound, Anuradha Khanna, a 28-year-old woman from the city, has not only survived twin kidney failures, but also made medical history in India by becoming the mother of a healthy child. This, in spite of what most doctors had predicted.

 Barely eight months after the girl from Mudiali got married to a corporate executive in 2001, she started falling ill regularly. With complications increasing by the day, Anuradha decided to consult a doctor and later nephrologist Lakshminarayan. 

 After a series of tests, it was found that both her kidneys had failed, and she hardly had any chance of survival. Immediate dialysis was recommended and subsequently, transplant surgery. 

 In February 2002, Anuradha and her husband Mahesh travelled to Apollo Hospitals in Chennai for dialysis and other follow-up treatment preceding the transplant. 

 Friends came forward to support the couple, both psychologically as well as financially. A couple in their 70s offered to donate their life?s savings to help Anuradha. 

 ?Within a span of 23 days, she underwent 11 dialyses,? recalled her sister Sriradha, who had accompanied Anuradha to Chennai.

 Then, a nephrologist team decided to check whether Sriradha could donate one of her kidneys to her ailing sister. 

 ?There was no second thought. We wanted to save Anuradha at any cost. We prayed that the tests would be positive,? said Sriradha.

 Her prayers were answered and tests showed that Sriradha could donate one of her kidneys. Days after the kidney transplant, Anuradha was back in Calcutta.

 ?After a few months, Anuradha asked whether she could conceive. Such patients are always advised against pregnancy, since the pelvis (just near the kidney) and the pelvic muscles get stretched a lot during pregnancy. Most past cases have all ended in premature abortions,? said nephrologist Lakshminarayan.

 However, in late 2003, Anuradha decided that she was going to become a mother, in spite of the risks. ?I wanted to set an example for others who did not have the courage to fight. My family was very cooperative,? said Anuradha.

 Throughout her pregnancy, a team of doctors closely monitored Anuradha?s condition. She responded very well to medication, surprising many doctors. 

 ?During pregnancy, the kidney goes through much stress and a lot of change with increased blood flow. A person with a recent kidney transplant cannot take the pain. But Anuradha managed to pull through magnificently,? said Lakshminarayan.

 Six months ago, Akanksha was born to the Khannas. ?She appears to have inherited her mother?s grit and courage,? was what father Mahesh had to say.

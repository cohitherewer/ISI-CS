 Security beef-up for exam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 This year?s Madhyamik, the biggest school-leaving examinations of the state, will flag off on Friday.

 As many as 623,268 examinees will write the tests this time. The number of examinees has increased by more than 18,000 over last year.

 Friday?s examination is First Language Paper I. Madhyamik 2005 will continue till March 7.

 The examination will be conducted in 1,871 secondary schools of the city as well as in the districts.

 This time, 66 blind, 26 orthopaedically-handicapped and three hearing-impaired students will take the test.

 Dibyendu Hota, president, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said elaborate arrangements have been made to ensure that the examinations pass off smoothly.

 Alarmed at complaints of question leaks in mathematics last year, the board this time has organised tight security arrangements at all examination centres. 

 For the first time, the board will not allow entry of guardians inside the venues. Police have been requested to ensure that all photocopying centres near the venues are kept shut on all exam days. 

 The state transport department has agreed to ply special buses on various routes on all the test days to help examinees from far-off places reach the examination venues in time. The examinations will be held between noon and 3 pm.

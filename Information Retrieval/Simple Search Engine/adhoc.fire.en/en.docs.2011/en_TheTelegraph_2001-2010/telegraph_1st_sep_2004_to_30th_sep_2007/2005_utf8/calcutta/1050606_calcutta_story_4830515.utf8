 Collecting the morning milk under the Greater Calcutta Milk Supply Scheme has become a matter of uncertainty for us. The card for our Webmilk packets used to carry the timing of 6 am to 8 am for collection. But those manning the Jodhpur Park market depot never turn up before 6.30 am these days. This means those of us who used to collect the milk packets on the way home after our morning walk cannot do so any more. The staff also leave 10 to 15 minutes before 8 am, using the heat as an excuse. This means not only do we lose out on the milk but also on the money. This leads to regular wrangles and they can be extremely rude. They are also allowing a hotel to use the depot for storing utensils overnight. The keys are kept with the hotel staff and it is they who collect the milk from the milk van since the depot staff arrive late. Will the authorities ensure that we get our supply of milk without getting harassed?

 I took up the milk commissioner?s post only a couple of months ago, but I won?t deny the problem. It is quite possible that it exists. I will call the in-charge of the booth for questioning. If it is found that he is not at the booth during duty hours, he will be dismissed and replaced. As for the other allegation, people tend to take public property for granted. This problem is prevalent elsewhere also. We need to zero in on the problem and take corrective action to improve overall efficiency.

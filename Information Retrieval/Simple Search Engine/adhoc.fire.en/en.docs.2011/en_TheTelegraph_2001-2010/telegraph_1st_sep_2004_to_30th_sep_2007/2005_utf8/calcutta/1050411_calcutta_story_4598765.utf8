 Truck slams two-wheeler

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 37-year-old man was killed and his wife and daughter were seriously injured after a speeding truck knocked down their motorcycle on Sunday morning. The mishap occurred on Girish Ghosh Road, in the Shyampukur area of north Calcutta.

 Businessman Pradip Kar and wife Monica, 27, had promised their daughter Debosmita, 3, a trip to her grandparents? house in Dhakuria early on Sunday. They planned to return late at night.

 Debosmita woke up her parents at 5 am and they left their Lockgate Road residence around 5.30. 

 It was a smooth ride till they reached Girish Bhavan, on Girish Ghosh Road.

 According to witnesses, Pradip lost control of the motorcycle while trying to swerve past a dog that had suddenly appeared in front of the vehicle. The truck, coming from the opposite direction, hit the motorcycle, throwing the three off it. 

 ?The accident occurred only because of the dog. It is unfortunate, but there was nothing anybody could do,? said witness Bholanath Saha.

 A section of the bystanders rushed the injured to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, while the others beat up the truck driver, before handing him over to police.

 ?We have charged him with negligent driving,? said Dulal Chandra Dey, officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station.

 By 6 am, the Kars were wheeled into the emergency section of the hospital with serious injuries. 

 Pradip had sustained injuries on his head, spine and ribs, while his wife had suffered injuries on her head. Debosmita was admitted in the paediatric ward with fractures on her legs and body. 

 Around 11 am, the condition of the couple started deteriorating, so the hospital decided to shift them to SSKM Hospital for better monitoring. 

 Late in the afternoon, Pradip died, while Monica was shifted to the neurology department. ?We are hopeful and are trying our best to save her,? was all an attending doctor would say.

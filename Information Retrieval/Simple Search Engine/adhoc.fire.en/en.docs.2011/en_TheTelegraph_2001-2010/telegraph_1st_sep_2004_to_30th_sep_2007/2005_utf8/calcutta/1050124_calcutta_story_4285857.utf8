Lzone: Aavishkar

IPSITA DEB

Started 11 years ago by sisters Tani and Sonia Lall, 

?because we had the space and ideas?, Aavishkar today has emerged as one of the 

city?s most exclusive lifestyle stores in terms of home d?cor, art and gifts (pictures 

by Rashbehari Das). The Middleton Row address has undergone several changes, trials 

and innovations since it upped its shutters in 1984. Today it has made a name 

for itself with a loyal clientele that insists the collection here is as unique 

as it is versatile.

Home front

 The home d?cor section is the forte of Aavishkar and everything from furniture and linen to upholstery and lamps is worth a look. 

 Wooden sofa sets, chairs, beds with matching side tables, chest of drawers and even coat stands in various hues, from beige and ivory to mahogany brown, embellished with colourful artwork, are the high points in the furniture section. The range is priced between Rs 3,000 and Rs 65,000.

 Table and bed linen and towels come in a riot of colours, with floral prints and geometric designs adorning them. 

 A range of colourful paper lamps from south India steals the show. This comes in various designs ? hanging shades, table lamps and floor lamps. 

 Gift galore

 Cups and saucers, vases, floral wall plaques, mirrors, wine boxes, leather bags from Hidesign and much more flood the racks at the store. These throw up great gift options. 

 The range of candles, though pretty wide, is not quite what it used to be earlier, admit the proprietors. ?Colourful candles in different shapes have become very commonplace and can be found everywhere now. So the exclusivity factor is gone,? says Tani. 

 For those with an artistic bent of mind, a range of framed photographs by noted lensman Dinesh Khanna are good picks. These are priced upwards of Rs 3,500.

Just Jewellery

 Designed by Style Craft, the jewellery here is mostly ethnic with some tribal influences. Precious and semi-precious stones like citrine, moonstone, calcedonia, amethyst and agate, as well as colourful beads, are embedded on silver bases. 

 The collection, comprising necklaces, bangles, earrings and rings, are priced Rs 175 onwards.

Animal care

 A new addition to the store is the range of pet products that currently adorns the windows. Dog bones, pet food and toys and other pet care products have been introduced by the sisters who are ardent dog lovers.

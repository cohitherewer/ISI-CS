Dragon den for firm finances 

Feng Shui Matters

Pikny Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, the dragon is considered 

to attract loads of fortune. A painting of a green dragon placed in the south-east 

corner activates wealth luck. Figures or paintings of dragons should never be 

placed inside locked cabinets as this symbolises imprisoning the animal and that 

leads to unsuccessful ventures

Q: My date of birth is 11.05.1976. 

I had worked with a multi-national company for five years and now I want to start 

my own consultancy firm as a financial advisor. My animal sign is dragon according 

to Chinese astrology and I would like to incorporate this symbol on the logo of 

my company. I also want to display a painting or a figurine of the dragon in my 

office. Please let me know what kind of dragon would be auspicious for me and 

also the suitable direction to display it. 

Aashish Dugar

The Solution: It is a good idea to incorporate 

the figure of a dragon in your business logo. Firstly because it is your own animal 

sign and secondly it is considered to attract fortune in loads. Place a painting 

of a green dragon on the eastern wall of the south-east corner to activate your 

wealth luck. To enjoy long-term success in your business, the dragon logo should 

not look hungry. It should be fat, healthy and well fed. Dragons should never 

be held imprisoned. They should be able to fly up to the sky and take your business 

to unlimited heights. Do not place them in circles and impede their growth. You 

could also display a figure of the dragon in the east, which represents growth 

again, but it should not be kept enclosed in a cabinet. Displaying them inside 

locked cabinets will be harmful for your upcoming projects. 

Career high

Q: My daughter (DOB 12.06.1974, time 

6.15 pm) is currently doing her PhD in cell biology in the US. I am worried about 

her success and career. Please advise which direction she should face while studying 

and the colours she should use in her surroundings.

T.K. Roy

The Solution: According to your daughter?s 

pillars of destiny, she is a weak wood person and is presently going through the 

phase of wood from 2000 onwards. This means she is in her power period right now 

and will be successful in achieving her goal in life comfortably. She has three 

elements of metal in her chart, which suggests that she will enjoy a very high 

status in life. She should be supported and nourished with the water element. 

Blue and green are her lucky colours and north-west, south-west, north-east and 

west the right directions.

Plot problems

Q: I am planning to buy a plot to 

build a house. It is a south-east corner plot where the south-east is cut and 

has an electric pole at that point. The drain is 170 feet away from the plot. 

The kua number of my husband is 5, son?s is 6 and my number is 4. Please suggest 

if the plot is auspicious for us. 

S. Mukherjee

The Solution: When you look for a corner plot 

with a road alongside, then you will usually find one corner cut. Cut corners 

are never recommended because you will not be able to tap the energy connected 

with that direction. South-east is directly connected with our finances. In your 

case, an electric pole exactly at the south-east point is balancing and giving 

a definite support to the plot. Care should be taken while designing the building. 

Construct a regular-shaped house and do not go parallel to the wall in the south-east. 

The main entrance of the house must favour the earning member?s auspicious direction. 

Your husband?s kua number is 5 and north-east is his Sheng Chi direction, hence 

the entrance should be from this direction. 

Metal mayhem

Q: My date of birth is 05.03.1973 

and birth time is 6:45 pm. I am physically challenged and also an asthma patient. 

My luck does not favour me in finance, business or career. Please suggest ways 

to enhance my career and financial luck and improve my health. Also, please let 

me know my strong, weak and nourishment elements, favourable colours, lucky number 

and directions. 

Sumanta Nundun

The Solution: You are a weak metal person and 

the excessive water elements in your chart exhaust you badly, thereby leaving 

you with very weak lungs. This lack of balance increases your asthma problems. 

To overcome this, wear a band that has a blend of five metals in it. Display metal 

objects on your bedside and office tables. Moreover, you were going through this 

exhaustive phase for the past 10 years, which further hindered your progress in 

life. But now you have entered your self-metal period, which will automatically 

give you the strength to acquire wealth and also to get your life partner, possibly 

by this year end. To boost your marital luck, energise your personal marriage 

direction, north. Do this by creating a couple?s corner where objects are displayed 

in pairs. Your lucky number is 9 and your auspicious directions are east for success, 

south-east for health, north for marriage and south for personal development.

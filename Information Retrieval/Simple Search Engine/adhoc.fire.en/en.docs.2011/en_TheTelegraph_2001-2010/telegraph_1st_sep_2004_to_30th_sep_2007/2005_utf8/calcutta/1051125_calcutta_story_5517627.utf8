The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Project rule shift to woo investors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Private entrepreneurs are always ready to jump into joint ventures with the government in real estate. But when it comes to infrastructure projects in and around Calcutta, most of them shy away.

 Concerned over this trend, which is affecting the private-public participation (PPP) projects in the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has decided to amend the guidelines for PPP. 

 ?A majority of the partners are in real estate and in construction of commercial estates. They are not taking much interest in infrastructure projects. We want them to realise that there are ample opportunities in this sector, too,? state urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Thursday. He was inaugurating an interactive session with private entrepreneurs.

 ?The draft guidelines of the PPP are being amended as we feel the existing one, which has been in operation for the past two years, is not enough to attract private investors in all the fields,? Bhattacharya added. ?We want them to come forward in a major way in constructing roads, water supply, sewerage and drainage, sanitation and in transportation.?

 The revised guidelines will be framed to facilitate speedy implementation of projects. 

 ?The government has suggested ways to overcome the shortcomings. Feedback will also be taken from private entrepreneurs. The new guideline will be formulated on the basis of both,? said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).

 Apart from giving more liberty to the private parties, the state is also contemplating the forging of long-term associations with them, officials said.

 ?There are plans to provide land to the private partner where it can set up commercial projects to make revenue,? Baviskar explained. CMDA?s proposed flyover to connect EM Bypass with VIP Road is one such project where this model will be put to use.

 The minister spoke of plans to introduce the ?Swiss Challenge? process, whereby a private entrepreneur will be encouraged to provide an idea for a project. Later, even if he is not the highest bidder, he will be given a second chance to quote the highest bid.

 Welcoming the government?s decision, managing director of Riverbank Holding Sumit Dabriwala said: ?Unless there is a proper revenue model, the private sector will not take the initiative. It wants legitimate returns from infrastructure projects.?

 The RG Kar Medical College and Hospital campus came under siege on Monday, with Students? Federation of India (SFI) supporters gunning for a house-staff member.

 Hasan-ul-Habib, 27, had been beaten unconscious early on Sunday for protesting when a mob of over 60 SFI supporters tried to claim one of the berths in his four-seat room in the boys? main hostel.

 ?They (the SFI supporters) submitted a memorandum to the principal and demonstrated on campus, demanding the immediate ouster of Habib from the hostel,? said Pradip Mitra, medical superintendent and vice-principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 ?Some hostel boarders had called me up at 2 am on Sunday to inform me of an altercation between Habib and a group of students owing allegiance to the SFI. They (the SFI group) had gone to occupy Habib?s room. They do sometimes forcefully try to occupy hostel berths? Habib and two others were injured in the ensuing scuffle,? added Mitra.

 According to Habib, a house-staff member of RG Kar?s cardiology department , a group of about 60 ?juniors?, mostly MBBS students, had entered his hostel room around 1.10 am on Sunday. Within five minutes, the mob had beaten him senseless.

 ?The intention was to frighten me so that boarders like me would run away and leave the berths empty for their taking,? said Habib. ?Saikat Dutta, Debasish Mishra and Dhiman Das led the assault.?

 Intern Saikat Dutta claimed Habib was residing ?illegally? in a hostel meant only for students and that he had started the fight during a routine check for empty berths. 

 ?We have submitted a memorandum demanding the immediate transfer of those illegally occupying hostel berths,? he added.

 Habib?s mother arrived from Murshidabad on Monday and lodged an FIR with Tallah police station.

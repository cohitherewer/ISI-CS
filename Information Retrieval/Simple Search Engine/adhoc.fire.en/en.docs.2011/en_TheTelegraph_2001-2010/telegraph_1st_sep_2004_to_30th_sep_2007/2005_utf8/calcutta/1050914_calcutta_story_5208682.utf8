 Enter, knee of the future

 - More flexible and lasts longer than fixed-bearing counterpart

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Hospitals in the city are all set to usher in the latest in knee-replacement surgery ? the high-flex rotating platform knee (HFRPK).

 Though only a small number of successful HFRPK replacements have been carried out in Calcutta so far, the new artificial knee has already found favour with the majors in the healthcare industry here. Many of these hospitals are planning substantial investments to tap the over Rs 10-crore market.

 ?HFRPKs are the artificial knees of the future. They not only give greater movement than fixed-bearing knees, that are commonly used in Calcutta, but also last longer,? said P.K. Banerjee, head of the department of orthopaedics, Peerless Hospital. The orthopaedic surgeon has so far performed 55 successful HFRPK surgeries in the city.

 ?Almost 90 per cent of the total fixed-bearing knees survive beyond 10 years. In case of HFRPK, the rate is as high as 98 per cent. Also, the HFRPK can bend 30 per cent more than its fixed-bearing counterpart,? Banerjee explained.

 The design of the HFRPK is such that its joint erosion rate is much less than the fixed-bearing knee. Hence, its greater longevity.

 The person fitted with an HFRPK enjoys almost normal knee movement, including adequate rotational movement. ?He/she can even sit cross-legged on the ground. This was unthinkable even a year ago,? the surgeon said.

 The cost-effectiveness of the HFRPK is another advantage. While a fixed-bearing knee is priced around Rs 1.8 lakh, an HFRPK will cost Rs 15,000 more ? not of much consequence, given its greater efficacy.

 ?The HFRPK has good market potential. Initially, we plan to invest Rs 2 to 3 crore in it,? said Sathyanarayan Reddy, chief executive officer, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.

 Chief operating officer of CMRI Hospital Amit De has bigger plans. ?We are ready to invest as much as it takes. No one would want to lag behind in this technology,? he states.

 ?Calcutta is a first in eastern India in HFRPK. The technology is so new that it has not even caught on in the US till now,? revealed Banerjee of Peerless Hospital.

 However, the disappointing fact is that nearly half of the city?s 1,000 patients every year, requiring knee replacements, go to other states for surgeries.

 From the City of Angels to the City of Joy ? An Affair to Remember. Quite a mouthful? Just what its meant to be, for thats what the latest Thai food festival at Baan Thai, the speciality restaurant at The Oberoi Grand, is called.

 What sets this festival apart is chef Thanaruk Chuto, specially flown in from Thailand for his first stint in India. With 13 years of experience under his chefs hat, Chuto has drawn up a select menu for Calcuttans, with nothing in common with the regular Baan Thai fare.

 On the a-la-carte menu, vegetarians could begin with Appetisers like Kang Kao Pheuk (crispy vegetarian-style mashed Taro) or the Mieng Chao Suan (vegetarian-style leaf-wrapped savouries with assorted condiments). For non-vegetarians there is Vi-Hok Kuen Rung (crispy breaded prawns), Khong Wanng Baan Thai (assorted Thai appetisers) or Yum Gai Sen Namprikpraw (a spicy chicken salad with shallot and chilli paste).

 Then there are the popular curries that range from Kaeng Keaw Waan Ma-KoeYao (eggplant green curry) and Massaman Kae (Thai-style curry with lamb) to Chu Chee Koong Mung Korn (traditional red curry with lobster).

 For the main course, choose from Tao Hu Phad Jae Ruammitr (wok-fried tofu, long bean, cashew nut, green chilli and pepper corn), Kae Phad Prik Thai Dum (wok-seared lamb in shallot and sweet basil with black and green pepper corn), Koong Ob Sa Moon Prai (baked giant prawn in Thai herbs) and Poo Nue Phad Phong-Ka-Ree (currydusted mud crab tossed in onion chilli and celery) and more.

 In the Rice and Noodle section there is Gui Teaw Khuo Jea (wok-tossed rice noodle, tofu, spring onion, peanut and carrot), Kao Phad Prik Jea (stir-fried rice and seasonal vegetables) or Kao Sam Sae (a trio of steamed rice in lotus leaf).

 Round it off with a delicacy from the dessert section ? Kao Homm Bai Toey (steamed rice pudding with pandanus) and Sangkaya Faktong (Thai pumpkin custard dessert).

 A meal for two, without ordering for drinks, would cost Rs 1,200-plus.

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,

 Dum Dum Park

 Anything different comes for a price. Cost of ownership, 

tax and maintenance ensures that multiplexes have higher expenses than single-screen 

halls. Besides they are meant to be different from regular halls in terms of facilities, 

services and ambience. They cater to a class which finds it difficult to frequent 

halls. If the multiplexes charge the same as single-screen theatres, they will 

not be able to maintain their uniqueness and value.

Paramita Mallick, 

 Kalindi

 Multiplexes provide more facilities to viewers than single screen theatres. But it is not reasonable for multiplexes to charge higher. The ticket prices should be within the means of common people.

Santanu Naskar, 

 New Ballygunge Road

 It is the single-screen cinema halls in the city and suburbs that charge exorbitantly compared to the lack of comfort there. One does not mind paying high ticket prices at multiplexes since they provide greater comfort and facilities. But if the multiplexes hike the rates further, people will stop going there. 

Debashis Pathak,

 Beleghata

 The viewer-friendly showtimes at multiplexes, cosy seats, modern sound systems, soothing air-conditioners, blemish-free screens and wonderful ambience have made film watching a pleasure at multiplexes. As the viewer gets more, he or she has to pay more also. What?s wrong in paying a higher amount for better service? 

Yashita Banerjee,

 Rashbehari Avenue

 Not everyone can afford to watch films in a multiplex unless the prices are brought down. Multiplexes can hike the prices of food, drinks and merchandise to meet their high maintenance cost.

Bhupendra Nath bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 It is evident that entrepreneurs have to invest more to set up a multiplex. Given that and the kind of service multiplexes provide, they should charge higher than single-screen theatres. 

Debashis saha, 

 Anath Nath Deb Lane

 In addition to better service, multiplexes offer more choice to people. So, it is fair that multiplexes should charge higher than single-screen cinema halls. But the ticket prices should not be beyond the means of middle-class people.

P. Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

 Multiplexes can charge higher than cinema halls since they provide better quality service and more facilities to the viewers. 

Shreya Mishra,

 Baguiati 

 Multiplexes are very different from single-screen cinema halls. The ambience and quality of service at multiplexes are a lot better than at cinema halls. Hence, it is quite natural for multiplexes to charge higher than single-screen theatres. 

Bratini,

 Behala

 Multiplexes offer better ambience compared to single-screen cinema halls, and hygienic food, among other services. Viewers at multiplexes belong to a different social class. To maintain their exclusivity, multiplexes need to charge higher than cinema halls.

Ahasan Jahir molla, 

 Maheshtala

 Multiplexes have changed the experience of movie-viewing. To provide quality facilities to the audience, they need to charge higher than cinema halls.

Biman Saha,

 Lake Town 

 Multiplexes should not charge higher than single-screen theatres. They have sources of income that conventional cinema halls do not have. Also, by charging higher, multiplexes lose out on customer volume. As they pay higher taxes to the government, they should given some exemptions so that they can recover their set-up cost at the earliest.

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata

 In our country, a significant percentage of the population lives below the poverty line. They and the majority of people do not care about the prices of tickets at multiplexes and cinema halls. 

Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 Multiplexes should not charge higher than single-screen halls. Cinemas are not just modes of entertainment; they also have educational value. Hence, there should be an upper limit to ticket prices at multiplexes.

Debyani basu,

 Birati

 In most cinema halls in Calcutta, the seating arrangement, acoustics and ventilation system are not up to the mark. Also, the tickets are sold in the black market in collusion with hall authorities. The viewers have to suffer as a result. The situation is much better in multiplexes, which also offer more services. That is why people prefer multiplexes over single-screen theatres.

Suvadip Goswami,

 Maheshtala

 Multiplexes are far better than single-screen cinema halls. People can choose from a variety of movies. There are play areas for children as well. So parents can enjoy a movie with popcorn and soft drinks and without the headache of an accompanying child. The charge is value for money for cinema-lovers. 

Md Ayub,

 Bright Street

 Car parking and a lot of other facilities offered at multiplexes make the higher charges worthwhile. Also, ticket prices for noon shows at multiplexes are almost the same as prices at single-screen halls. So it is not true that common people cannot afford the multiplexes. 

Dev Mandi,

 Karl Marx Sarani

 Multiplexes should not charge higher than single-screen halls because both entertain viewers with a single movie at a time. 

Mehjibin Yunus,

 Bright Street

 Even after making allowances for higher recurring expenditure, I find the multiplex charges too high. 

Prasit Sen,

 Hatiara

 The multiplexes are taking advantage of the fact that single-screen cinema halls do not offer even the minimum service. There is no reason for multiplexes to charge as much as they do. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

 Multiplexes have novelty value, but once that wears off, viewers would prefer to watch movies in single-screen cinemas because of their lower prices. This will naturally have an adverse effect on the collection at multiplexes. So, in their own interest, they should bring down the rates.

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 Multiplexes offer sophisticated technology and luxury, in addition to other amenities. It is natural that the customer has to pay for the additional facilities. Unless they charge a higher price, multiplexes will not survive.

Anuradha Raza,

 Darga Road

 More facilities definitely demand a higher price tag. Good picture and sound, comfortable seats and quality cooling will surely come at a higher cost. Besides, multiplexes offer many movies under one roof.

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 

 Entally

 Service comes at a cost. Multiplexes offer a luxurious environment to those who pay for it. They incur higher maintenance and upgradation costs, hence the practice of charging a higher price for services rendered is not altogether unjustified. However, multiplexes need to plough back some of the money to ensure absolute safety for viewers.

Neera Fogla,

 Rabindra Sarani

 Considering the facilities multiplexes offer, I don?t think they are charging higher than cinema halls. In fact, that is the reason people are flocking to multiplexes instead of halls, despite the difference in ticket prices. People want quality at any cost and that?s why single-screen theatres are closing down.

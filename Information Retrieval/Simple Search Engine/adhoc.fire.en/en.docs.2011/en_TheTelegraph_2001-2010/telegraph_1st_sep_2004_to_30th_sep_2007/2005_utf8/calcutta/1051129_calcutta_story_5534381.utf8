 Actor pitch for patch-up

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Actor-politician Tapas Pal wants to amicably settle the dispute with his mother Meera.

 ?Advocate Sekhar Basu has already started a move to settle the issue. The dispute with my family members should be ended in the presence of my mother, whom I love very much,? the actor stated in a petition in the high court last week.

 Pal?s petition came up for hearing before Justice S.P. Talukdar on Monday. Basu told the court that the criminal and civil case pending with trial court should be quashed for the sake of ?smooth settlement of the family dispute?.

 The judge passed an interim order staying the operation of the Hooghly chief judicial magistrate?s (CJM?s) order and fixed December 2 for the hearing.

 On the basis of a complaint by Meera, Hooghly CJM Mohammad S. Rushidi, on September 9, had issued arrest warrants against Pal, his wife Nandini, driver Dinanath Singh and assistant Pulak Kulabi. The CJM had asked the police to produce the accused before him by February 28, 2006.

 Apart from this criminal case between Pal and his mother and sisters, a civil property suit is pending in the trial court. Pal has been accused of trying to take over his late father?s house.

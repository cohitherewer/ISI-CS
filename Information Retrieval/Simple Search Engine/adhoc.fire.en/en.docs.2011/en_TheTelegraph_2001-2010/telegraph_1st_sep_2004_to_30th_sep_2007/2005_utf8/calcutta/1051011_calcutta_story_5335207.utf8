 Night riders go underground

 You have seen them at lounge bars, bumped into them in throbbing discs, greeted them at a celebrity party address? And last Friday night, they all made a beeline for a star hotel on AJC Bose Road.

 There couldnt have been a better start to the festive season ? after the weather gods were threatening to drown it all ? at least for the party people of Calcutta.

 The smell of fresh paint, the rock and rust look, the serpentine alley? Underground was high on everybodys party list (subject to the possession of the invitation card). 

 The Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) opened up its much-talked-about bunker to the party crowd.

 Underground, the first in a string of night clubs scheduled to open this season, has replicated the dim and damp interiors of the London Underground. Two other theme-centric night clubs will follow in the next six months: Venom in Fort Knox and F-Bar on Sarat Bose Road.

 We are aware of the competition in the coming days, but that will only add to the demand. The idea is to get more and more people out of their homes and make them comfortable about the idea of partying, says D.K. Jaiswal, chairman and managing director, HHI. 

 There are still many people who do not come out because they do not have a place in the city that matches their tastes. We have tried to give Underground an international look and feel.

 The wooden staircase leads to the basement where the three corners are named Leicester Square, Trafalgar Square and Oxford Street. But the fourth corner, the 600 sq ft dance floor, is not for the weak-hearted. The infectious energy was evident even as the city models and party animals decided to jam it out to the beats of DJ Anshul.

 During the early hours of the party, the trio of Aftab Shivdasani, Dipannita Sharma and Pooja Bedi (with a neckline that went wherever gravity took it) trooped in. The Koi Aap Sa stars made only a brief appearance, so it was up to Pooja Bedi and her plunging black dress to keep the glamour quotient high.

 The first day, first show verdict? As volatile as any other popular poll in Calcutta, it ranged from grins to grumbles. The place rocks. The interiors are great. Its going to rule the night life for some time to come, opined an entrepreneur.

 The dance floor is too big. Most people want to park themselves in a cosy corner. Any night club with small dance floors is a big success in Calcutta, countered a rival night club manager.

 Whether a sandwich stop or a chicken chomp, Calcuttans are always game to new things. So, there is no reason why Underground should not rule the nights till the next destination emerges to woo the party circuit.

 Femme force

 A couple of days before the city started celebrating the goddess as a symbol of shakti, the banquets at Hyatt Regency witnessed a celebration of womanhood.

 Titled Nari, a fashion show featuring creations by some top Indian designers was presented by Standard Chartered Priority Banking as part of its annual Cirque Selected lifestyle events.

 The designer list included big names from Be: like Manish Arora, Wendell Rodricks, Savio John, Shantanu-Nikhil, Krishna Mehta, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Anshu Arora Sen and Rohit Bal.

 Models like Aditi Govitrikar, Tapur Chatterjee and Anchal Kumar, along with city girls Priyanka, Tanushree, Ishika and others catwalked six sequences based on fire, air, water, earth and space.

 The finale was based on artist Wasim Kapoors line of paintings called Nari, which served as the backdrop for the show choreographed by Asish Banerjee of Rampedge. The theme music was composed by city band Karma, which also put up a live performance later in the evening.

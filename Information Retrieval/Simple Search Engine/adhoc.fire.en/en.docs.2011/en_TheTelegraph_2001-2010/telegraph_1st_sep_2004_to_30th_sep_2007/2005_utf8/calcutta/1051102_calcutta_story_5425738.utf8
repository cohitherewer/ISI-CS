Guide foxes examinees

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) board?s refusal to learn from mistakes is driving students up the wall.

 Weeks after Metro revealed how the book of model JEE questions and answers was full of errors, the board came out with a revised edition and announced that the mistakes had been corrected. However, the students, to their dismay, are still stumbling upon dozens of glaring errors.

 The pattern of the examination is set to change from next year. In place of essay-type questions, the students will now have to answer multiple-choice questions. The board, in a bid to help the students get acquainted with the new pattern, published the model question-answer book. 

 Unnerved by the factual discrepancies in the board?s version with the textbooks, hundreds of students have since been calling up the board office to find out more about the mistakes.

 Initially, the board admitted 30 mistakes ? seven in mathematics, 16 in physics, five in chemistry and two in biology. More mistakes have come to the fore in the revised edition.

 ?In its hurry, the board overlooked dozens of glaring mistakes in the first edition of the book. Unless the errors are corrected, they will confuse the students,? said Akhil Roy, a private tutor.

 One of the questions asks why concentrated hydrochloric acid, when kept in an open bottle, emits white fumes near its mouth. According to the board, the oxygen in the air reacts with the gas let off by the acid to produce chlorine, which constitutes the white fumes. Experts held that the acid reacts with the moisture in the air to form droplets of liquid that appear like white fumes.

 Subhasis Manna, who will take JEE 2006, exemplified the dilemma of the students. He said: ?After the board came out with the revised edition, I thought that the errors had been removed and continued studying the wrong answers.?

 Several students expressed surprise that mistakes in the physics, chemistry and biology sections of the book had evaded the eyes of the board-appointed experts.

 ?The JEE board must make the necessary corrections as quickly as possible,? asserted A.K. Maiti, a tutor.

 The board?s failure to come out with a Bengali translation of the book has inconvenienced several students. ?Most of the students who appear in the JEE, hail from Bengali-medium schools and are all at sea with complex questions in English,? added Maiti.

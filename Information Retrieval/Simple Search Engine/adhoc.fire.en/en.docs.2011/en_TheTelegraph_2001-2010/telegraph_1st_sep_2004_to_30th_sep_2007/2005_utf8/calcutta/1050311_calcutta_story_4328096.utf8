Partying till the wee hours of the morning every weekend might be your idea of chilling out, but if you want to give the wild streak in you a free run there?s nothing better than a wild west bash. A ranch and a gang of cowboys might be far beyond your reach, but there?s no harm in taking a cue from that lifestyle and converting it into the theme while having some fun with friends.

In fact, the arrangements wouldn?t require much leg 

work since the junk in the house can be converted into accessories to add to the 

effect. A wild west party has to be a very relaxed affair, so plan it on a day 

when you are not hard-pressed for time and have hours to chill out. 

Ranch recall

 If you are blessed with a farmhouse somewhere close to the city, there?s no reason to think twice about the venue. Drive down in the morning with your gang, make the arrangements throughout the day and just let your hair down in the evening. A Saturday would be the best bet for this since you can wake up lazily the following afternoon. If you are not that lucky, shift the fun to your backyard or garden instead.

 The d?cor for the bash is as important as the venue. ?While things like getting a pony or turning your house into a virtual junkyard might not be realistic, the d?cor should have touches of the cowboy life,? says Probashish Sanyal, manager of Winning Streak, which recently hosted a wild west bash.

 Turn your haunt into a ranch by fencing the entire place with wooden logs and throw around bales of straw. 

 Add to the stable look by throwing in a wagon wheel, if you manage to lay your hands on one. While getting a pony might be a bit too ambitious, some horseshoes and saddles would create the desired effect. 

 A hangman?s noose and big wooden poles will further reinforce the theme for the evening. The waiters must be draped in cowboy gear.

On the cards

Theme bashes usually are a great opportunity to design 

interesting invitation cards. So, if you are planning a slightly bigger gathering, 

think about an off-beat invite in keeping with the theme. Remind them not to turn 

up in their cocktail-party best. You can innovate as much as you wish here. Incorporate 

images of cowboys and ranches to indicate the preferred dress code and the mood 

of the venue.

Cowboy costumes

 The dress code for the evening should shout the theme out loud and will add to the fun factor. Cowboy costumes are apt for this bash. The guys can flaunt their denims, preferably torn and dusty, and team them with rugged-textured shirts.

 A leather vest, with a gun holster hanging from it, and wide, worn-out leather belts will add to the appeal. Cowboy hats or colourful scarves and high leather boots pointed at the toe will be the ideal accessories.

 The women can go for knotted shirts tied above the belly buttons and pair it with either denim minis or a pair of lived-in jeans. Colourful scarves around the neck, straw hats and high boots will complete the get up. A visit to the parlour for an elaborate hairdo is absolutely ruled out, sport the straight-out-of-bed tousled look instead.

Barn bites

 ?The focus of the menu at a ranch party has to be on non-vegetarian food. Lots of grilled grub ? steaks and kebabs ? would be ideal,? says Probashish.

 Beef steak, chicken steak, pork chops or lamb chops should comprise the main course menu, while kebabs should do for starters. A barbecue on the side will ensure better co-ordination between demand and supply.

 However, the grub is likely to take a backseat at such a bash, with free-flowing beer being the primary focus. Try to get your hand on a keg, if possible, to keep cold pitchers topped up at all times. 

For those not too fond of the brew, whisky on the 

rocks or vodka shots would be ideal thirst-quenchers.

Games galore

 Give the guests some activity in the form of whacky games. Traditionally, games like roping a pony and pie-eating competitions are favourites at these bashes. While the former might be difficult to arrange, the latter can be done quite easily. Whoever hogs the maximum number of pies can walk away with some more of them, in case they haven?t had their fill. Darts and shooting could be good options too. 

 Arrange a few empty soda bottles and beer cans and let the guests try their luck hitting the target after a few pints!

Life

 The spell of small things

 House Proud

 Little changes can breathe a fresh lease of life into your home. All they ask for is a slice of your time and imagination, says Shradha Agarwal

 Coming back home is always comforting. But sometimes this comfortable set-up can get too staid for your liking. That same set of scarlet candles, now turning into a shade of dull rose. That something extra in the form of a carpet, which begins to look like anything but a value-add. Those floral curtains and those same old flowers from that neighbourhood florist. 

 Oh so boring? Its not quite possible to go for a complete overhaul every now and then and dressing up new cushions isnt exactly what the d?cor doctor prescribes. All your home needs is select changes, a touch here and a feather there.

 One has to introduce elements to bring about these little changes. Elements that are essentially low on cost, flexible, lightweight, easily available and versatile, says interior designer Vivek Rathore.

 Your home is screaming out for a little slice of your time and imagination.

 Heres a GoodLife guide to change your den with a light touch.

 Light lustre

 Ever noticed what role a candle plays in soothing your space? Well, thats the kind of difference some lighting can bring about. So an easy and effective way of bringing about some change in the d?cor is to tinker with the lighting of your room.

 Play around with the source of the light, offers interior designer Rajdeep Ghosal. Instead of opting for flat, white lights, bring a bit of drama into your home. Use lights that are indirect yet incandescent, with the sources hidden behind a frame or some flowers.

 Vivek pegs retractable lamps as the most stylish source. These lamps, with self-adjusting heights and multi-coloured patches, look cool. One can also control the lighting by fixing dimmers on halogen-based bulbs that regulate the light intensity.

 Then, theres the colour code. If you have an urn with floating candles, then choose the required visual effect by picking distinctly coloured flames. Candles now come with a host of coloured flames that can be used very beautifully to lend a magical feel to the interiors, says Vivek.

 Greens galore

 Nurture some potted plants or throw in some petals to make it a happy home.

 Flowers lend the feeling of the particular season and the aroma goes a long way in changing the mood, says Rajdeep.

 Instead of displaying a variety of greens, his suggestion is to stick to a particular variety and make a stronger style statement.

 Potted plants, bonsai, stalks embedded in soil lined with pebbles are just few ways to breathe life into your space. Small arrangements with seasonal blooms all over the house can also work wonders.

 Avid gardener Shanti Agarwal recommends rubber plants, erica palms, crotons and ediniums for the indoors. Make an interesting bonsai, complete with a landscape and nurture it like your child, she suggests.

 Miniature waterbodies, huts, pebbles and shells make for great bonsai accompaniments. Bring in colour with powdered bricks, adds Shanti.

 One can pick up some wrought-iron holders to hang the plants in bare corners.

 If you think refilling your vase every alternate day is a hassle, simply tear some petals and set them afloat in simple transparent vessels (even serving bowls would do).

 ace them at strategic spots ? near the entrance, on side-tables, bedside tables and in empty corners ? and see the mood of the house change.

 Personal peg 

 Set aside a big makeover budget and anyone can gift you a designer home, but the true touch lies in the personal details you put in. Something that leaves behind a strong sense of your individuality and taste. It neednt be expensive, it neednt be fancy, but it should have brand You pronounced loud and clear.

 Set up your own little curios corner and display little mementos you have collected through your travels, says interior designer Ajay Arya.

 His emphasis is on personal taste. If you are learning to play the sitar or the tabla, dont cover it up. Display it and also make things close to your heart a part of your d?cor, say your favourite coffee-table books.

 Mix it up

 Most of us can move about blindfolded at home, but if so can your guests, its time to mix things up. Even if all things remain constant, just juggle it to add a freshness of feel.

 ter the level of your bedroom by lowering the height of the bed. Complete the look by introducing some floor mattresses and low seaters. Throw in loads of fluffy cushions and youre all set for a brand new room.

 Even if you cant change positions of the furniture, you surely can switch items. Put in a bean bag instead of the sofa and youre bound to feel the change, says Vivek.

 Colour code

 Its a no-debate situation. Colour changes the code as nothing else can or will. Be it a brightly-coloured mauve wall or vibrant cushion covers, colours have their own story to tell. When you are all down and out, go pick up two sets of bright bedcovers or throws.

 All of us love displaying family pictures and playing with the hues. So opt for sepia tones if you will. Choose from scales of blues or brown, suggests Ajay.

 Vivek advises innovative painting of home junk. Dip in old buckles, nails and bolts in buckets of thick paint. Go for bright yellow, red and blue and watch these primary colours work their charm.

 Timeout

 Based on an English play written by Susan Hill, Shey combines the ingredients for a suspense thriller with a dash of the supernatural, to provide an evening of stimulating entertainment. Set in the desolate marshlands of the British east coast, the play begins with the death of Alice Drablow, who lived in a massive old mansion all by herself. Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor in a legal firm, arrives from London to attend her funeral and sort her papers of inheritance. A city-bred young man, he is naturally reluctant to stay in a remote, rural place, and is filled with a sense of dread upon reaching his new, unfamiliar surroundings. When he spots a mysterious, emaciated-looking young woman dressed in black at the funeral, he tries to find out who she is and her relationship with the deceased, but in vain. Puzzled and curious at the villagers? refusal to disclose anything about her, he waits until he meets her again. Finally, when the moment comes, she reveals to him her true identity and her terrible purpose. Direction: Saswati Biswas.

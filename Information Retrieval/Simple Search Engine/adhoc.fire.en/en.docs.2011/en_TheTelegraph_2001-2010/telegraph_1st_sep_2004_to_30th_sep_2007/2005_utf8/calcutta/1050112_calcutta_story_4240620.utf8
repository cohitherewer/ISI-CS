The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re 

not afraid of hard work or challenges. Progressive by nature, new places and foreign 

customs inspire you. Your curiosity and charismatic personality attracts others. 

Sharing a few light moments with colleagues may be a good idea. You will excel 

in areas that require a technical bent of mind. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Night heist at bank on campus

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A gang of around 10 armed criminals had a free run early on Tuesday at the University College of Science and Technology, in Rajabazar. 

 They rummaged lockers in the physiology department, took away Rs 2,300 from the secretary?s room and finally forced their way into the Bank of Baroda (Surya Sen Street branch) extension counter on the campus.

 Bank officials told police the locker contained around Rs 1.51 lakh. It could not be opened on Tuesday because of a snag in the locking system. 

 Deputy commissioner (north) Barun K. Mullick said the robbers tried to force open the locker, but whether they succeeded could be known only after the snag was fixed.

 The locker has a double-locking system. ?One key is with the cashier and the other with the manager. The manager keeps the key with him, but on Monday, he had left it behind in office,? he added.

 The robbers struck around 2.30 am. They had split into two groups. While one scaled the wall on the Parsi Bagan Lane side, cut the barbed-wire fence and made its way in, the other entered through the main gate.

 The second group?s task became easier when one of the three guards, Debasish Mukherjee, opened the gate to go out and relieve himself. 

 ?The moment he opened the gate, a person punched him in the mouth. Then blows started raining on him. Hearing him scream, I ran out and met with the same fate,? said colleague Arup Pal.

 The two then shouted for the third guard, Nar Bahadur Pradhan. The robbers assaulted all three, stuffed paper balls into their mouths, blindfolded them and tied their hands. The guards were then locked in a room.

 They were spotted around 5.45 am by one of their colleagues, who called the cops.

 Pradhan said the robbers were carrying iron rods, hacksaws and other sharp instruments. Some of these have been recovered by police. According to deputy commissioner Mullick, the instruments were used to break open the locks and grilles.

 Police suspect the gang had entered the bank counter through a vent below one of the air-conditioners.

 Activities on the campus where 

 Calcutta University?s postgraduate classes in science and 

 technology are held were normal on Tuesday, said registrar 

 Ujjwal Basu. The students? union has demanded a beef-up 

 in security.

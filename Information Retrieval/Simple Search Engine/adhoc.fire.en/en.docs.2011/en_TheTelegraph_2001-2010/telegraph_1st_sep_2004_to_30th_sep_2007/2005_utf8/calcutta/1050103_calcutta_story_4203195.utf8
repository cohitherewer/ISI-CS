The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon Appetease

Victor Banerjee

 Some things, like this blossoming mango tree, 

need no calendar to glow golden in the rising sun of yet another year. (PTI)

I received no calendars this year. Except one; from 

a hardware store attached to a petrol pump in a shantytown in Upper Assam. 

Outside my bedroom window in Calcutta, is a mango 

creeper that my father planted while his mother sat in an armchair, in the shade, 

watching. This was to live in her memory. Now, both my father and my grandmother 

have left me and the creeper whose support had withered years ago learnt to survive 

in a hostile world by growing thicker and thicker each year until about five years 

later it had stood up erect on its own. The weary wobble of years of effort are 

revealed in the twists and turns in its trunk that fought to search for an elusive 

sun that only crept upon it at dawn in the summers and at dusk in the winters. 

Yet, in its very third year it produced three little mangoes that my father and 

mother with their two granddaughters made a celebration snack of. 

As I look at it now, I can see the bol, blossoms, 

that hold out promises for another year of fruitfulness. Flowers that needed no 

calendar to appear and glow golden in the setting sun of 2004. The mists of a 

tardy winter and the magically-wild Nor-Westers that buffet West Bengal in spring, 

shall take their toll, but, in the survival of the fittest, the fruit that this 

little backyard tree bears will be a symbol of success that the retrograde mafia 

of the politicos? unshed-able cadre cannot pluck as its share of my profits nor 

destroy as ?unlawful? petit bourgeois gain. 

And yet, ?Between the desire /And the spasm/Between 

the potency/And the existence/Between the essence/And the descent/Falls the Shadow.

Hang-ups and hangovers are what we have to deal with, 

with resolution. The former part of the muddle and mire we are in and the latter 

a consequence of the way we have dealt with straying from traditions in the name 

of social evolution and what we might have imbibed while welcoming in a New Year 

that really changed nothing.

So, when you say you are groggy and can remember naught, 

let me give you the original recipe of what is known as a ?grog? and what you 

can sublimate it with when you know the enhancement of ?Brule Vin?. Finally, how 

you can cure that incurable headache (from drinking to forget) by making an ?Eggnog? 

for all those who stayed up to watch a sunrise on the 1st of January expecting 

its rays to dispel the problems and baggage we carried forward into the New Year.

 GROG

1 Serving 

1 teaspoon sugar syrup, 1 tablespoon strained lemon 

juice, 1 jigger dark rum. Fill mug with very hot tea or water. Garnish with a 

twist of lemon peel. Try this drink using maple syrup instead of sugar syrup. 

Dust top with a little ground nutmeg or cinnamon.

 VIN BRULE

This winter-evening cheer, outdoors or in, offers 

a bonus before and after. When touched with a match, it bursts briefly into a 

tall blue flame ? worth extinguishing the lights for. And the French say this 

graceful potion is better than aspirin to ward off the grip of a cold as well 

as the night chill. 

ace in a saucepan, covered, over high heat 1 bottle 

dry red wine, 4 sticks of cinnamon, peel of 1 orange, 3 or 4 tablespoons sugar. 

When the mixture comes to a boil, uncover and ignite. When the flame has died 

down, remove mixture from heat and ladle at once into mugs.

 EGGNOG IN QUANTITY 

I) A rich and extravagant version that is correspondingly 

good. Some people like to add a little more spirit to the following recipes, remembering 

Mark Twain?s observation that ?too much of anything is bad, but too much whisky 

is just enough.? 

Twelve egg yolks. Beat in gradually 1 lb confectioners? 

sugar. Add very slowly, beating constantly 2 cups dark rum, brandy, bourbon or 

rye. These liquors may each form the basic ingredient of the nog or may be combined 

to taste. Let the mixture stand covered for 1 hour to dispel the ?eggy? taste. 

Add, beating constantly 1 to 4 cups of liquor chosen, 2 quarts whipping cream 

(1 cup peach brandy). Refrigerate covered for 3 hours. Beat until stiff but not 

dry 8 to 12 egg whites. Fold them lightly into the other ingredients. Serve the 

eggnog sprinkled with: freshly grated nutmeg. 

II) Less powerful, less fluffy than the preceding 

nog, and a boon to the creamless householder. 

Twelve eggs. Beat in gradually 1 lb confectioners? 

sugar,? teaspoon salt, ? cup vanilla, stir in 8 cups evaporated milk, diluted 

with 4 cups dark rum, brandy, bourbon or rye. Cover the nog closely and let it 

ripen in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Stir again and serve sprinkled with freshly 

grated nutmeg. 

Happy New Year, all! If nothing else helps cheer you 

up this coming year, remember to pick up a recipe of mine and that, I assure you, 

will bring a smile on your faces and a cheer into your hearts. They will all be 

as ?incredible? as they will be adventurously cookable and enormously eatable!

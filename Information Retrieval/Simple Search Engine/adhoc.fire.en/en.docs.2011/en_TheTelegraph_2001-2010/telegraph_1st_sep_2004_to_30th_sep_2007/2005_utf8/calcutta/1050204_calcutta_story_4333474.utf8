The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 March debut for SSKM night shelter 

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 The SSKM Hospital authorities on Thursday unveiled plans to open a night shelter for relatives and friends of patients by March. The shelter will be set up on the hospital premises. 

 An unused two-storeyed building near the cardiology department has been earmarked for the shelter. The building is being renovated.

 Hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi said that after renovation, the building would be able to accommodate about 75 persons.

 The charges for using the night shelter haven?t been decided yet, but they will be nominal, he added.

 There has been a long-standing need for setting up such a shelter, because SSKM Hospital is a referral hospital, and several patients from outside the city are treated there.

 Superintendent Tripathi claimed that most of the 1,250 patients being treated at the hospital are from the districts and their relatives are forced to spend nights in the hospital compound, in the absence of any alternative. 

 ?The building we have chosen for the shelter is spacious. It was built several years ago at a cost of Rs 75 lakh, provided by three Rajya Sabha members from Bengal,? he said. 

 Minister of state for health Pratyush Mukherjee told Metro on Thursday that the government has a plan to set up similar shelters in all medical colleges across the city and in the districts.

 ?Initially, we want to open such shelters in the medical colleges in Calcutta. But we have plans to extend the facility to the four medical colleges in Bankura, Burdwan, North Bengal and Midnapore in the near future,? Mukherjee said.

 The minister also disclosed government plans to instal a public address system at the medical colleges, to facilitate summoning of those accompanying the patients in case of any emergency.

 ?Once we are able to instal such a system, it will be helpful not only for the relatives of the patient, but also for the doctors. In case of an emergency, the public address system can be used to communicate with those accompanying the patient,? minister Mukherjee elaborated.

 Two former Rajya Sabha members from Bengal ? Mohammad Selim and former finance minister Ashok Mitra ? had donated from their local area development (LAD) funds for the projects.

 Recently, two other members of Parliament ? Nilotpal Basu and Debabrata Biswas ? have also donated about Rs 25 lakh from their LAD fund to the hospital.

 Lobby backs short-term teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Alarmed at the rising incidence of contractual teachers being dismissed by English-medium schools on ?flimsy grounds? and its effects on students, the Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools on Tuesday decided to invite contractual teachers to join its fold.

 The member-teachers said the failure to elicit a positive response from the school managements to repeated requests to stop recruitment of teachers on short-term contracts had prompted the move.

 The association feels cases of unfair dismissal of temporary teachers will be reduced if they have a platform to air their grievances. ?Many schools are exploiting contractual teachers as they cannot get their complaints redressed,? said a leader of the teachers? association.

 The backing of the teachers? lobby will help them fight their case and that, in turn, will check students from being exposed to adjustment problems in school, the leader added.

 D.K. Bhattacharya, general secretary of the association and a former of teacher of La Martiniere for Boys, pointed out: ?The management cannot expect students to concentrate in class if they have to adjust to new teachers every other month.?

 So far, the association rules permitted only permanent teachers to obtain a membership of the organisation.

 ?In keeping with modern management policies, many reputed schools are recruiting teachers on contract, with the objective to ensure better discipline among the teaching staff and extract the best services from them. But seldom do they realise that the short-term recruitments can lead to deterioration of academic standards. The glorious past of these schools is at stake,? said Ismail Nehal, association president and a former teacher of St James School.

 The association on Tuesday organised a seminar, attended by 1,000 members, to discuss the effects of contractual services in Anglo-Indian schools and its relevance in the context of the rich heritage of these institutions.

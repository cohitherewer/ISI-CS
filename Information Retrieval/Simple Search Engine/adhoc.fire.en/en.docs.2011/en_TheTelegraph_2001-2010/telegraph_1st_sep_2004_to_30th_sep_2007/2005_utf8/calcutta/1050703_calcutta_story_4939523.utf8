The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Let?s put the wag back in the tail

 PET PASSION - NILANJANAA

 We (animal lovers) are a discontent 

 lot. And justifiably so, when you see a sick dog suffering 

 for days on end and then passing away at your doorstep with 

 no help whatsoever from any quarter. You are helpless, frustrated 

 and most definitely angry! And a majority of the animal 

 lovers in Calcutta feel this way.

 I get calls from acquaintances 

 every other day telling me about a dog lying dead on the 

 bypass or a badly maggoted cat in some bylane that needs 

 help. School kids, college students write to me enthusiastic 

 e-mails about their love for animals and their disappointment 

 at being met with denial or no response almost every time 

 they report a sick animal or an accident case. Other than 

 offering words of solace and trying to keep their spirits 

 high, I really couldn?t do anything. At least that?s what 

 I thought till I came across an optimistic post-graduate 

 student, Prajit Chatterjee.

 Disillusioned like most of us, 

 he decided to set up a website, www.animalinfo.50megs.com, 

 for animal lovers to connect with each other, exchange notes, 

 seek help and form a strong network. (I am a part of it, 

 are you?)

 Another example of proactive people 

 in animal welfare, Moitri Bhavana Veterinary Clinic in Bolpur 

 run by three friends ? Suroprotim, Bashudeb and Shankar. 

 Distressed by the lack of good medical facilities in Bolpur 

 for pets and strays, they sought the help of Kishore Ganguly 

 of Moitri Calcutta who helped them set up the clinic in 

 Bashudeb?s house in Bolpur. Moitri Bhavana offers free treatment 

 to stray animals and subsidised rates for pets. The trio 

 has the help and support of local animal lovers who are 

 ever ready to take in a dog which needs post-operative care 

 or a handicapped dog that needs a home. They haven?t been 

 able to set up a sterilisation unit yet due to lack of funds. 

 But given their level of commitment and dedication that 

 too shall happen soon.

 If you are still whimpering and 

 whining about the apathy of the authorities and the NGOs 

 towards stray animals, you can stop now, because it won?t 

 help. But you can help by letting out your garage or backyard 

 for housing a dog that needs post-operative care. Or if 

 you feel magnanimous, maybe even let out an empty room in 

 your ancestral home for the free treatment of strays.

 If you call yourself a genuine 

 animal lover, then merely reporting a sick animal on the 

 streets is only half the job done. Getting the animal medical 

 aid and seeing it back on its feet is where your job ends, 

 till another one comes along. If you feel all this is too 

 much work, then Calcutta has no hope and definitely no right 

 to complain. To build an animal-friendly city on our own 

 terms we need to work at the grassroot level. I know welfare 

 costs money but more importantly you have to have the will 

 to want to do something for animals to begin with. So let?s 

 brainstorm, get our act together and put that wag back in 

 the tail of a dog!

 Please write in and help form 

 an animal lover?s network. Write to me at nelanjanawritesyahoo.com 

 or to Prajit at prajit_chatterjeerediffmail.com.

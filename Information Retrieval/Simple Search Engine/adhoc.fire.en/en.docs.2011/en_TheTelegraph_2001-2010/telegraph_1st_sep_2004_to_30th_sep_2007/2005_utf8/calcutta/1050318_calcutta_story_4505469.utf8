 Be careful if you are planning to get a Versace, RayBan, Oakley or an Armani shade without burning a hole in your pocket. You may end up buying a cheap replica that would do more harm to your eyes than good.

 According to ophthalmologists, most of the sunglasses sold in city stores are replicas and do not offer protection against ultraviolet radiation, which may cause cataract, macular degeneration and even skin cancer around the eyes.

 ?Fake sunglasses can make you look good, but they are best avoided,? said city ophthalmologist P.B. Sarkar.

 Counterfeit sunglasses are generally priced between Rs 100 and Rs 1,000 and are a big hit among college students. Branded shades have only a 10 per cent share of the Rs 1,000-crore sunglass market.

 ?Most people wear shades to look good. They buy more than a pair to match with their clothes. What they do not realise is that their eyes are affected in the process,? said physician Tapas Nag.

 ?A host of problems are caused by the use of inferior-quality sunglasses. Most patients see their doctor with severe headache as the initial symptom,? he added.

 Doctors said that a simple way of determining the quality of a sunglass is to check for image distortion. Good-quality glasses do not distort images. Also, sunglasses should ideally be scratch resistant and provide total protection from ultraviolet rays.

 Optometrist Vipin Buckshey said: ?Almost all international sunglass brands are available in India. Customers should buy from reputed outlets and insist on a proper bill, receipt and guarantee card.?

 He added that the cheap sunglasses available in the market do not protect the eye from ultraviolet rays and hence, serve no purpose.

 Ultraviolet rays are ?light waves? with shorter wavelength. They are invisible but carry more energy and, hence, can cause severe damage to the eye.

 Depending on their intensity, ultraviolet rays are known to cause anything from simple keratitis (sunburn and scarring of eyes) to cataracts, macular degeneration and even blindness.

 ?Fake sunglasses are a serious problem for unsuspecting customers, authorised retailers and manufacturers, and also the government. While there are options for all styles and budgets, only genuine sunglasses are a shield against the sun?s fury,? said Harsh Chopra, managing director, RayBan Sun Optics Limited, India.

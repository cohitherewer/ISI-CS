The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

 This week, let?s catch up with two famous Calcuttans. Girish Chandra Ghosh?s creation, Star Theatre, passed quickly from a cultural hotspot to a neglected landmark before finally perishing in a fire in 1991. The present, restored, Star Theatre recently held its 50th show. Here?s hoping that the second avatar of Star Theatre has a better fortune than its previous one. Exciting plans are being made for another old city institution. Mahajati Sadan boasts of a proud heritage. Now efforts are on to give visitors an enhanced experience in the form of a sound-and-light show highlighting historical characters and events. If all goes well, the city will soon have a show to rival the one at Delhi?s Red Fort

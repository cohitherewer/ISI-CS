The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sunshine rerun at Howrah station

 - 400 stalls razed for centenary celebrations

 OUR BUREAU

 After allowing illegal stalls to flourish in the Howrah station area for over 25 years, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and police on Sunday razed more than 400 stalls in an eight-hour operation. Squatters were evicted from more than a dozen bus shelters. Even a party office of the Trinamul Congress was not spared.

 The eviction drive was undertaken to facilitate rejuvenation of the Howrah station area on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the station building, to be observed from December 1 to 7.

 According to divisional railway manager (Howrah) H.V.Sharma, the rejuvenation plan will be implemented as a joint venture of the Eastern Railway, CMDA and the Calcutta Port Trust.

 Though police on Friday and Saturday had asked the encroachers over the microphone to dismantle their structures, tension ran high in the Howrah station area from Sunday morning as CMDA officers arrived, accompanied by payloaders and trucks. 

 A large contingent of police, led by deputy superintendent (traffic) Samir Mukherjee, cordoned off the area as a payloader destroyed a makeshift hotel. All the stalls razed by the payloader were empty as their owners had already taken away their possessions.

 District secretary of Howrah INTTUC Somnath Sharma alleged that police and CMDA did not touch the CITU office in the area. ?It was a business of over Rs 2 crore for the local CITU leaders, police and the CMDA officers since a stall-owner had to pay them Rs 150 daily,? charged Sharma.

 Squatters had turned passenger shelters into dining space and kitchens. Bamboo slits were used to add makeshift mezzanine floors. 

 Some passenger sheds were taken over by food vendors and paan sellers, who offered everything from snacks to drugs and hooch, and even women, it is said.

 These illegal stalls have turned the Howrah station area into one of the most accident-prone zones. Catching a bus at the Howrah bridge approach road, with its rush of traffic from all imaginable directions, is an ordeal.

 ?Buses on routes like 12C, L238 and 12C/1 have encroached on the channels for state buses. So, people avoid state buses since it takes 15 to 20 minutes for these to come out of their channels already blocked by private buses,? said secretary of West Bengal Bus Passengers? Association Dhananjai Datta.

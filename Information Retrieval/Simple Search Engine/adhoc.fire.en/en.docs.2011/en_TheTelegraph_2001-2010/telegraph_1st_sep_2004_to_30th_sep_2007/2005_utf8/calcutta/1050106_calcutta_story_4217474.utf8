The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Census raises sneers, stokes chaos

 - Voluntary disclosure form distributed by cops beyond comprehension of cablemen

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Aapni ki shwadhin chalok othoba madhyom chalok? Stumped? Try this. Jodi apni madhyom chalok hon, apnar madhyom ki bohukon bishishto pronali porichalok othoba prodhan niyontron kokkhyo?

 Adding to the cable confusion in a bid to clear it, the government has done it, yet again. All the grandstanding about injecting method into the cable madness has collapsed amidst chaos bordering on the comic, sparked by a census form relayed to the cableman through the local cop.

 ?The forms were supposed to be distributed in both English and Bengali,? admitted an official associated with the cable census. 

 But till Thursday, only the Bengali version of the ?tarjog preron porichalok shomikkha nirdeshonpotro? (cable operator survey form) had reached the end-user.

 Only a few cablemen could decode the missive. ?It is impossible to understand,? admitted a cable operator. ?How many of us know madhyom chalok means a sub-operator or bohukon bishishto pronali porichalok means multi-system operator (MSO) or prodhan niyontron kokkhyo means the master control room??

 The form is meant to kick-start an ?income-tax-like? voluntary disclosure by cable operators, which would enable the administration to determine the number of cable and satellite homes in the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority area and address the problem of under-declaration.

 Distributed by local police stations to the operators, the fill-up-and-return deadline is an improbable 24 to 48 hours.

 Language laments aside, serious authorisation arguments have been raised by operators. ?There is neither a letterhead nor a stamp to indicate where the letter is from,? complained a north Calcutta operator. ?Are we supposed to give our classified business information to anyone who asks questions on a sheet of paper??

 The classified business information being referred to covers subscriber numbers, free connections provided (and why). Other items to be filled in include various registration numbers (income and service tax, trade licence, etc) and geographical radius of the area to which the operator provides service.

 The industry has been pinning hopes on the government to address issues such as under-declaration and end the frequent cable spats that hold the consumer to ransom.

Language was hardly a barrier as French rock outfit Louise Attaque heralded rock ?? roll time at Bow Barracks on Tuesday. The quartet comprising vocalist Gaetan Roussel, violinist Arnaud Samuel, bassist Robin Feix and drummer Alexandre Magraff regaled a motley crowd of Barracks residents and music lovers from the city and abroad with a two-hour-long power-packed performance. 

 The French milieu sang along with songs from the band?s hugely successful eponymous first album, while the rest simply soaked in the music at the open-air concert in the sultry evening. Residents got a bird?s-eye view from verandahs and rooftops and the rest of the head-banging crowd just parked on the concrete asphalt in front of the makeshift podium. 

 ?The band is a huge name back home and usually plays at really large venues. Few people know about them in India, but we wanted to lend a different flavour to the proceedings by turning it into an informal, open-air concert and not confining it to closed auditoriums,? said Emanuelle deDecker, deputy director, cultural events, Alliance Francaise. The organisation presented the concert in association with The Telegraph and Bow Barracks.

 After an opening act by Neel amp; Neel, the band unleashed a pulsating tempo without much ado. Even though the lyrics were alien and the music very distinctive owing to the unique sound of violin combined with rock, the band had a curious universal appeal, lapped up by all. ?Their sound is wholesome, proportional and has a very good flavour that can be enjoyed instantly,? said Monojit Dutta of Orient Express, present among the sizeable musician fraternity who had trooped down to watch the treat.

 The quartet came together as a folk-rock band and its first album was purely acoustic and folksy. They?ve gone on to encompass a lot of electric, reggae and electronic elements since, which came through in their current performance. Worth special mention was violinist Arnaud Samuel?s prowess with the instrument that lent a surreal edge to often ugly industrial sounds. The result was a harmony that left the crowd begging for more. 

 Kurta cool

 Move over bright and contrasting colours. This is the season of cool prints in a rather toned down palette if you go by Shradha Saraf?s style statement for spring-summer 2005. 

 The designer unvieled her spring-summer line under the label kSara.

 Churidar-kurta sets for women is Shradha?s forte, but there is also a smattering of westernwear including some Indo-westerns as well, which are all up for grabs at an exhibition in her Fountain Court workshop at 3/1 Middleton Street. 

 On till April 14, the exhibition features summer coolers in cotton, linen, khadi, voile and georgette. The cuts of the kurtas are the usual knee-length, short sleeve variety stocked in most stores, but the designer has racked her brains as far as the use of embellishments and mix and match of fabrics go. A touch of embroidery here and a dash of glitter there, apart from using a different fabric to embellish a particular garment, do justify the rather steep tag of Rs 2,000 to Rs 6,000 to some extent. 

 ?I lay a great stress on wearability. In the present collection, I?ve concentrated more on casual daywear. You will find some light eveningwear in the line though,? said Shradha. 

 Her westernwear collection is more evening than daywear. The semi-formal shirts can be pulled off at an impromptu party after work, while thick a-line skirts with interesting trimmings make for all-purpose wear. 

 In case one misses the exhibition and wants to check out kSara (meaning fire in Sanskrit) credentials, Shradha retails from Little India, Aura and Zenon in Calcutta.

 Rosogolla romp

 Die-hard rosogolla fans might balk at the almost blasphemous idea of flavouring them but adventurous foodies may welcome butterscotch, guava, strawberry, kiwi, orange, mango, dry fruits, chocolate and pineapple-flavoured rosogollas on offer at Gupta Brothers on Free School Street. 

 Purists may or may not agree, but the owners are convinced the act will ?lend the sweet a new look, flavour and character to make it more desirable?. 

 ?The festival is our homage to the age-old delicacy, responsible for making Bengali sweets famous all over the world,? said Rajesh Gupta, CEO, Gupta Brothers. 

 The rosogollas are priced between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a piece.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 When Vivek Oberoi did an Uttam...

 Pratim D. Gupta was there on 

 the sets of Home Delivery to see director Sujoy Ghosh pay 

 tribute to the Mahanayak while impressing his leading man 

 with his acting skills

 Cool is a word which Sujoy Ghosh 

 not only exudes on screen (read Jhankaar Beats), 

 he swears by it off-screen as well. So, it wasn?t surprising 

 to catch him talking nineteen-to-the-dozen or messaging 

 away on his Nokia handset on the sets of his new film, Home 

 Delivery. After the musical tribute to RD ?Boss? Burman, 

 Sujoy has been shooting another quirky urban tale of relationships 

 with Vivek Oberoi, Ayesha Takia, Mahima Chaudhury, Boman 

 Irani and Rajpal Yadav. Metro caught up with the 

 shooting team in front of Vaishali shopping complex near 

 Juhu.

 Shot 1: Ayesha waiting 

 for Vivek and then finally taking a taxi...

 A mini-crowd has built up outside 

 the shopping centre. Not everyone can identify tinsel town?s 

 hot new face. ?Yeh kya TV pe aati hai?? asks 

 one onlooker to another, even as Ayesha gives the finishing 

 touches to her make-up. She is looking fetching in a blue-and-white 

 floral shirt and a long blue skirt.

 Home Delivery?s camera 

 is being handled by Calcutta boy Shirsha Ray. So, most of 

 the crucial framing chats are in chaste Bangla. ?Ulto 

 dik theke zoom kore nebo. Bhalo lagbe,? 

 Shirsha tells Sujoy and then asks his assistants to set 

 up the camera under the tree on the opposite pavement.

 Sujoy is on another call. This 

 time it?s music director Vishal of the Vishal-Shekhar duo. 

 ?You had told me that the Asha Bhonsle song will be ready 

 by now. I have to shoot it, boss,? Sujoy frowns. The shot 

 is ready to be canned and is okayed in a single take. Ayesha 

 crosses the road and slips into her air-conditioned make-up 

 van, where her mother is ready with lunch. It?s a round 

 of tea and cold water for the crew out in the sun.

 Shot 2: Vivek dropping 

 Ayesha in front of the shopping centre...

 Shirsha is trying something innovative 

 for this shot. He?s got the camera perched inside the car 

 from the back. ?The overall look of the film is very urban,? 

 says Shirsha. ?We are not trying something flashy, just 

 what the script demands.?

 Vivek arrives on the sets. ?You 

 are looking wonderful babe,? he smiles at Ayesha and a warm 

 hug follows. A wink at Sujoy and things are ready to roll. 

 ?How?s my new look?? he asks around, referring to his straightened 

 hair and glasses. Doesn?t the hair look a lot like the Kyun...! 

 Ho Gaya Na cut? ?No, no... ek baar ho gaya aur nahi...,? 

 Vivek laughs aloud.

 A quick glance at the script ? 

 which is changing every moment (Sujoy loves the spontaneity) 

 ? and Vivek and Ayesha do a quick rehearsal. The shot is 

 canned in a couple of takes.

 Shot 3: Vivek is 

 stopped in his tracks by a havildar...

 A junior actor, Harish bhai, 

 plays the overweight traffic policeman. Shirsha places the 

 camera to the right of the car. Sujoy, Vivek and Harish 

 go into a rehearsal huddle. In the script Vivek does an 

 Uttam Kumar and gives a complicated fake name to the havildar 

 so that he doesn?t interrogate him any further.

 The name is ?Pundarikaksha Purakayastha?. 

 ?That?s my tribute to Chadmabeshi,? Sujoy announces 

 proudly. But he isn?t happy with the way Harish bhai 

 is mouthing the lines. ?Thoda under kijiye ? natural 

 lagna chahiye,? he says and goes on to act out the 

 scene. ?Had you come into acting, we would have been all 

 gone by now,? Vivek tells his director.

 A couple of more rounds of rehearsals 

 later, Sujoy calls, ?Action!? and the shot is canned in 

 three takes. It?s almost 7 in the evening and the daylight 

 is threatening to disappear. Sujoy has had enough for the 

 day having shot at two other locations before the shopping 

 sequence. He lets loose his vocal chords: ?We all meet tomorrow 

 again at 9... pack up.?

 Oils, with a history that dates back many a century, have been a beauty essential for many a princess. With all the variety of concoctions, they were a must-have in most peoples bath routine.

 But in this age of creamy shower gels, serums and leave-in conditioners, oils have had to slide back.

 A one-stop beauty agent, oil is regarded highly in Ayurveda for its therapeutic properties. Unlike other therapies, oils have the power to moisturise, exfoliate and help deep-pore cleansing, all hand-in-hand, says C.M. Pradyumna, director of medicine at Vedic Village.

 Heres rediscovering the goodness of oils, with the ready GoodLife guide:

 Tress tale

 Its common knowledge that an intensive oil massage does wonders for the scalps circulation, but Shirodhara, the ancient Ayurvedic therapy, is several steps ahead.

 Guaranteed to treat insomnia and induce relaxation, this therapy involves a process where medicated oil is applied on a persons forehead for 25 minutes. 

 Stress is cumulative, but it all originates in the mind before spilling on to the body and then targeting an organ. Shirodhara de-stresses one at the root-level, says Pradyumna.

 While Shirodhara is an occasional luxury, oil can be a boon for the hair in many other ways. After all, oiling is an ancient form of hair-conditioning. 

 Beauty and hair expert Rita Mohan advises an almond oil massage twice a week for dry hair. Leave it on for 15 minutes and see the difference, she smiles.

 But if you have an oily scalp, never leave the oil overnight, she cautions. 

 Body beautiful

 A weekly oil massage is one of the most precious gifts you can give yourself during winter.

 Not only does it nourish the body, it also enhances the skins defence mechanism and strengthens the nervous system. A massage can even rid your body off some unwanted toxins.

 A massage helps in tightening the muscles, invigorating, purifying and relaxing the senses, says Apple Montakan, spa supervisor at Banyan Tree, The Oberoi Grand.

 You can use commercial body oil or even baby oil for the massage.

 If you dont like the smell of a particular vegetable oil, then add a few drops of your favourite essential oil in it. Apple recommends a massage of rosemary oil or sandalwood oil mixed with rosewater for the face. 

 According to Pradyumna, herbal oils are most beneficial since their medicinal value can seep through the skin to reach the target organ.

 Kumkumadi Thailam, a saffron-based oil, is excellent for vibrant skin. One should apply a few drops of this oil and massage lightly in circular motions. Wash off after 15 minutes with powdered green gram or masoor dal, he explains.

 Other Ayurvedic oils with magical effects are Nalpamaradi and Yuvatyati Thailam. 

 Aroma appeal

 Aroma oils have the power to rejuvenate as few other things can. Oils have the capacity to purify all the emotions of a person, says Apple. 

 Aromatic oils have the power to manipulate your mood. If jasmine and Ylang-Ylang act as aphrodisiacs, lemongrass or eucalyptus is antiseptic. One can choose from lavender, primrose or morning dew for releasing happiness, says Rutu Tawde, manager of the day spa Solace. 

 Other options are citrus-based oils like orange or lemon.

 In fact, a few drops of your favourite essential oil diffused at home is all that one needs to recover from the stress of a long day. 

 An instant pick-me-up suggested by Rita is a 10-minute foot rub with peppermint oil mixed with a good base oil. 

 Bath basics

 Oils play a significant role in our bathing routine too. Other than applying some oil to lock in moisture after a bath, oils can also be added to the water.

 Ten drops of an essential oil is required in a full tub, but you can also pour four drops in a bucket of water. Use this water as a final rinse after the shower, advises Rutu.

 One can also introduce a soothing before-bed routine involving bath oils. Dip in your hands and feet in warm water and watch these aromatic oils work wonders to induce sound sleep. 

 If you have a very dry body, try adding some oil into the granular scrub before sloughing off the dead cells. Olive oil or almond oil is a good option, adds Rutu.

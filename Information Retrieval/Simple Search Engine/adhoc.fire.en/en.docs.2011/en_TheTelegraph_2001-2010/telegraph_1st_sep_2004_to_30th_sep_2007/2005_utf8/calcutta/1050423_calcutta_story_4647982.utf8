 Traditional craft goes all trendy

 Darshika is among the handful of boutiques in the city that specialises in men?s ethnic wear. Husband-wife designer duo Rajesh and Sagun Agarwal, who started this endeavour a few years ago, are working with a range of fabrics that include cotton, georgette, raw silk and dupion, concentrating on festive pieces and wedding gear. While they stick to the usual jackets and dupattas teamed with kurta-pyjama, neat craftsmanship ensures the ensembles stand out.

 The boutique?s new line focuses on the wedding season, playing with bright colours, both in fabric as well as embroidery. Zardosi and kantha, beads, stones and kasap work add to the elegant cut and fall of the kurtas. Priced between Rs 750 to Rs 3,000, the sets come ready made or ready-to-customise. ?Grooms now prefer to colour coordinate their outfits with that of the bride or other members of his family. The result is a demand for kurtas in bright yellow, electric blue, maroon and even soft pink,? explains Sagun. 

 Those with more traditional preferences can stick to an array of whites and creams.

 Style scout

 Nirmaan awards, the year-old scheme instituted by the BD Bangur Endowment, is set to roll out its second round of grants and financial packages in a bid to promote entrepreneurship. The hunt for the most deserving candidates in four fields ? photography, art-in-utility, textile and fashion design ? will begin end-April, with applications being invited from interested candidates between the ages of 18 and 30 years.

 The inaugural year saw as many as 700 applications from across the country. The best candidate in each category went home richer by Rs 1 lakh, while the first and second runners up were given interest-free loans of the same amount to start out on their own. ?The response last year was overwhelming, with 45 per cent of the applications and some of the winners from outside the state. We?re looking forward to honouring more such talent this year,? says Manjushree Bangur of the trust.

 Short-listed through two rounds of rigorous screening by experts from each field based on work samples, the chosen candidates attend the competition held in Calcutta, including workshops and personal interaction with jury members.

 ?Though all of the candidates can?t win, at least they get precious tips from the best in their field,? feels Bangur. Last year?s jury included Raghu Rai, Paresh Maity, Rakesh Thakore, Anamika Khanna and Chittravanu Mazumder. This year?s jury is being selected.

 Rustic fibre

 In less than a year?s time, Urban Village, a non-profit organisation committed to the cause of the dying arts of Bengal, has successfully brought some authentic handicrafts from various corners of the state to the doorstep of the urban buyer.

 The organisation that was started by a group of like-minded women a few months ago is now hosting its second exhibition at Debkutir, in Salt Lake?s DC block, till the end of the month.

 From dokra and Santiniketan batik to the more off-beat Gambhira masks and rural musical instruments like the ektara ? the ethnic range encompasses around two dozen types of items. The Urban Village collection is worth a look because apart from promoting craft, it is trying to breed the culture of clubbing aesthetics with utility. Check out the coaster sets made from mother of pearl and the Ravana series in dokra.

 Just jazz

 After Parampara 2005, the exhibition that showcased the best in lifestyle products, those on a high thanks to ethnic chic can spend two more days amidst some awesome clothes and accessories. Chennai-based designer Sharmila Bajoria has changed venue to Cinnamon Gallery on Upper Wood Street on April 22 and 23, with her collection of saris, salwar sets and accessories, including shoes, bags and jewellery.

 The lady, originally from Calcutta, may live in the south, but you are not likely to spot too many lengths of luscious silk in her cupboard. Georgette seems to be her fabric of choice. ?The line I am showcasing now is essentially for weddings and parties where the fabric has to have a good fall and be a little jazzy,? explains Sharmila, selling a range of heavily-embroidered saris for marriages and some chic designs meant for party wear.

 Priced at Rs 3,000 onwards, the party selection has been moving fast on the first day of the showing. The footwear and bags, both formal, go well with the more ornate outfits.

 Showers continued to lash Calcutta and its neighbourhood for the third consecutive day on Friday, while the Met office held out hope of the weather improving from Saturday evening.

 Alipore recorded 84 mm and Dum Dum 51 mm of rain till 8.30 am on Friday.

 ?The low pressure, that hovered over the Andhra Pradesh and south Orissa coasts on Thursday, weakened over the past 24 hours and has moved further up. The feeble low-pressure area is over Bengal and north Orissa coasts and adjoining land areas and is gradually dissipating. We hope the weather conditions will improve from the second half of Saturday,? said G.C. Debnath, weather section director at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore.

 Debnath, however, warned of heavy rain at a few places, with heavy showers in isolated pockets over Gangetic Bengal and north Bengal districts during the next 48 hours.

 ?Under the influence of the present position of the low pressure, we are expecting rain in many places in Gangetic Bengal and north Bengal districts,? he said.

 Even though the low pressure has become feeble, large volumes of moisture are flowing in, resulting in the formation of huge masses of rain-bearing clouds. ?These cloud masses today are not very tall but are capable of delivering a good amount of rain,? said Debnath. 

 Officers said the city is expected to wake up to a grey cloud cover on Saturday. ?As the low pressure now has become weak after hitting the land and is showing signs of dissipating, we expect the weather to start clearing gradually from Saturday evening. But the accumulated moisture is expected to deliver more rain,? an officer said.

 Met officers, however, are still watching the movement of the low pressure that is showing a tendency of moving north-east. 

 ?But, as it is fading out, we can expect it will not have much of an effect in north Bengal and other areas of the Northeast,? said an officer.

 After the system clears, the sun will come out, said the officers. ?We have had almost no sun for the past three days. The sun may shine on the city again on Sunday and we can have a much-needed respite from the rain. But as the cyclone season begins from October, another low pressure or a depression may form in the Bay of Bengal,? an officer observed.

 The low pressure had formed over south-west and west-central Bay of Bengal, off the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coasts on Wednesday, moved upwards and lay over west-central Bay off adjoining Andhra Pradesh and south Orissa coasts on Thursday. 

 By Friday, it had moved further up and lay over Bengal and north Orissa coasts, hitting the land.

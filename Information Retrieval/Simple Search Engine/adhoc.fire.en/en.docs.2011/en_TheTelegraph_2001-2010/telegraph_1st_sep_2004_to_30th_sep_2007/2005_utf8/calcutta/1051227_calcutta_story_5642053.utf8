 Santa in the wards, kids all smiles 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 When the world outside is having a blast, 14-year-old Tania lies in Wockhardt Hospital, recuperating from the pain and shock of getting a kidney removed. But she?s all smiles, as the authorities have allowed her, and other patients, to savour the winter festive spirit from within the hospital.

 Private hospitals in the city have lined up a series of events to make Christmas and New Year a memorable experience for indoor patients, including children. The programmes range from Santa Claus visiting wards and showering gifts on children to distribution of cakes and small gifts.

 While some have decided on a 10 per cent discount on the bill for the winners of a lucky draw or a relaxation of visiting hours, others are decking out their lobbies or arranging special, colourful dresses for doctors and staff members.

 ?Patients feel left out and depressed whenever the city erupts in celebration, like on Christmas and New Year. So, we have decided to involve them in some kind of festivity,? said Rupali Basu, director of Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute. ?We want them to smile and usher in New Year, just like everyone outside is doing. There will, however, be no compromise on the medical strictures and the particular needs of the patients.?

 At Wockhardt, the lobby and the reception on the ground floor have been decorated with Christmas trees, artificial candles and balloons. 

 A special menu has been prepared for the patients as well as the cafeteria on the hospital compound. If doctors agree, patients will also be served sweets. 

 On New Year?s eve, doctors and all staff members will wear new, colourful clothes. Greeting cards, with a message from the director, will be sent to the patients.

 At Advanced Medical Research Institute (AMRI), children in the paediatric ward have been meeting Santa Claus almost daily for the past few days. ?Around 20 nurses and other staff members dress up like Santa and visit patients, especially those in the paediatric ward. Our focus is on the children, as they are the ones who miss the celebrations the most,? said AMRI president S.B. Purkayastha.

 The Santas sing carols and popular Hindi numbers on request and hand out sweets and small gifts to the children. 

 The hospital also plans to conduct a lucky draw on New Year?s eve ? a 10 per cent slash on the bill will be the gift for the three winners.

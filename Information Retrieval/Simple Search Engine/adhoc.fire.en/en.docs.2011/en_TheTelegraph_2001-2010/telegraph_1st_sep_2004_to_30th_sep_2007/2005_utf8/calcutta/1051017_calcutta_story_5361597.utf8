 Maimed body near rail tracks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man aged around 50, with eyeballs gorged out, was found dead in Belghoria, on the northern fringes of the city, early on Sunday.

 The body also bore deep injury marks near the spine, suggesting that the kidneys, too, might have been taken out.

 The body, sent for post-mortem, was noticed by a few youths behind a bush beside the railway tracks, around 50 m from Belghoria station. Police suspect the man had been murdered at least two days ago, as the body had started decomposing by the time it was discovered.

 ?We thought the man was mowed down by a train, but we were wrong,? said Anukul Samanta, a local resident and one of those who spotted the body.

 ?We saw the eyes were gorged out. There were also injury marks caused by sharp weapons near the kidneys. We immediately called police,? said another local resident.

 Railways police officers rushed to the spot with a large contingent. ?There were cut marks in his spine area. The dhoti-clad man seemed to be in his mid-fifties. After a detailed investigation we will come to know whether he was a victim of gang rivalry or murdered for any gain. There is also a possibility of a racket being involved in the case,? said A.S. Pahari, officer-in-charge of Government Railway Police (Dum Dum).

 ?The nature of injuries does not indicate that the eyes were gorged out by rats. We will probe from all possible angles and go to the bottom of the case,? added another police officer working on the case.

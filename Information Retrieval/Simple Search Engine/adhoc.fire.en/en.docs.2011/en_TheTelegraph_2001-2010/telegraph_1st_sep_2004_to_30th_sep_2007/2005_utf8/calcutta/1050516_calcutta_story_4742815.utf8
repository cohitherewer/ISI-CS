 Aid call for wetlands 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is seeking the Centre?s help for the conservation and protection of the Santragachhi wetlands.

 ?We wrote to Union environment secretary Pradipto Ghosh last month, asking him to move the railway board for transferring the jheel land to the forest department. Once the land is directly under our jurisdiction, we can frame a policy for conserving it in a better way,? said forest secretary R.K. Tripathy on Sunday. 

 The railways have recently been permitted to fence, beautify and landscape the area surrounding the wetland, Tripathy added. 

 In early May, the forest secretary also wrote to the ministry of environment and forest, seeking Rs 1 crore for protection and conservation of the site for the last two years of the current Plan and another Rs 50 lakh for maintenance work in the 11th Plan.

 On Wednesday, Bina Upadhyay, joint secretary, ministry of forests, met Tripathy, environment secretary Asim Barman and other officials of the environment department and assured them of financial help. 

 ?We?ve been asked to prepare a draft project, which we will send them soon for a formal approval. The project will include embankment restoration and fencing of the waterbody, construction of watch towers, restoration of the canals feeding the wetland and cleaning water hyacinth from the surface,? said Nitai Kundu, senior scientist, Institute of Wetland Management and Ecological Design.

 ?The site has to be protected since it is an important habitat for birds,? he added.

 Howrah district magistrate Nandini Chakraborty has already discussed the issue with the Howrah Municipal Corporation chairman.

 Spread over nearly one sq km, the waterbody at Santragachhi is the largest urban wetland around the city. It drew over 5,000 migratory birds last winter.

 Officials of the Howrah division of the state pollution control board had observed in a recent report that municipal waste, including domestic waste, is routinely dumped in the wetland.

 Fishing and other human activity is also quite common at the jheel, the report further stated.

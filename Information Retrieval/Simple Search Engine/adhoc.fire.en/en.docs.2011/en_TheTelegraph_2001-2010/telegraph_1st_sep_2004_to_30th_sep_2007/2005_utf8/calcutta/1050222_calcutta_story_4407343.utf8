 Two die under wheels

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Killer wheels continued crushing pedestrians as the city police recorded two more traffic deaths in the past 24 hours. 

 The two victims, both in separate accidents, were killed by reckless driving.

 With Monday?s twin mishaps, the February fatality toll has shot up to 29. Those killed include two children and a woman. In January, the traffic department at Lalbazar recorded 55 traffic deaths.

 According to the police, Biswashankar Roy, 74, a resident of Prince Anwar Shah Road, died on BT Road, near Sinthee More, when a speeding luxury bus knocked him down late on Sunday. 

 Preliminary investigation revealed that the driver lost control and hit Roy, who was standing on the pavement. Bystanders rushed him to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. The driver managed to flee, leaving behind his vehicle.

 The second accident occurred around 12.25 pm on Monday. A minibus on the airport-Jadavpur route rammed into a roadside tea-stall at the crossing of Beleghata Main Road and Canal East Road and crushed 26-year-old Dipak Singh, a local resident, under its wheels.

 Police admitted the mishap could have triggered road rage. ?It was avoided because shops of the area were closed. We arrested the driver and impounded the bus,? said an officer of Beleghata police station.

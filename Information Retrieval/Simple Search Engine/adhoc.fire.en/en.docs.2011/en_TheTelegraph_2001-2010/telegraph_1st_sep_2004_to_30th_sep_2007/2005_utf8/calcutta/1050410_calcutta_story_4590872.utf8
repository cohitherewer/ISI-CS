The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Circus animals, dying to entertain 

 us

 PET PASSION - Nilanjanaa

 A Russian State Circus in performance 

 at Netaji Indoor Stadium

On the night of April 4, 21 animals 

 belonging to the Russian State Circus Company, Rosgoscirk, 

 were charred to death. The sea lions were kept in a 30-ft 

 room with plastic sheets on the floor, with no windows and 

 no light. The cats were in a smaller room with broken plywood 

 pieces. The highly inflammable plastic caught fire and there 

 was no way the animals could have been saved in time.

 It is amazing how accidents affecting 

 human lives attract nation-wide attention while the daily 

 suffering of circus animals goes unnoticed. Most of us see 

 circus animals unchained, wearing colourful costumes under 

 the glitter of neon lights with cheerful music surrounding 

 them. We do not see them caged and chained in darkness, 

 denied sunshine, fresh air and freedom.

 Wild animals which are used to 

 roaming over long distances seeking food, playing and socialising 

 with their own kind are confined in cages or chained for 

 up to 23 hours a day. The only way to break their free spirit 

 is to beat, shock and whip them to make them perform. Trainers 

 drug some animals to make them ?manageable? and remove the 

 teeth and claws from others.

 Torture

 Otherwise why would a tiger, which 

 is instinctively afraid of fire, jump through a flaming 

 hoop? Because he is more afraid of what will happen to him 

 if he doesn?t jump than he is of the fire. Elephants are 

 made to balance their tremendous weight on a tiny stool 

 and ?elephant hooks? are used to control the animal by pulling 

 behind the ear (which is a particularly sensitive area). 

 It is unusual to see tears running from the eyes of wild 

 elephants, although it is common in captive elephants. Bears 

 commonly have their noses broken while being trained. How 

 else would you see them balancing on balls?

 Travel

 Circuses are constantly travelling 

 from city to city, with access to basic necessities such 

 as food, water, and veterinary care often inadequate. Climatically, 

 the circus environment is quite different from the animals? 

 natural habitats, and temperature extremes cause misery 

 and sometimes death. Most of the animals that are quite 

 large and naturally active are forced to spend most of their 

 lives in small, barren cages used to transport them, where 

 they have only enough room to stand and turn around, forcing 

 them to eat and defecate in the same place.

 Tamasha

 At the circus, children do not 

 see the animals? natural behaviour patterns ?intelligence, 

 food-gathering instincts, social interaction and other remarkable 

 behaviour they exhibit in the wild. Instead, they learn 

 that it is all right to force animals to do unnatural tricks 

 and to treat them as nothing more than commodities. Educate 

 your children on what the circus does to the animals. Take 

 your children for nature walks and appreciate the wildlife 

 in their natural habitats. Watch wonderful wildlife and 

 nature documentaries on National Geographic and Animal Planet 

 with your children, teaching them to respect nature.

 Take a stand

 Circuses strip the animals of 

 their dignity, respect and natural beauty. On behalf of 

 animals everywhere, boycott circuses with animals. And make 

 your voice of protest heard.

 With the demand for diamonds growing at a rate of 20 to 25 per cent a year, Calcuttans are fast getting hooked.

 While the yellow sheen of gold might be most preferred in smaller cities and towns, diamonds are emerging as the preferred pick for the urbane woman, said Samrat Zaveri, managing director, Trendsmith. He was in town to unveil this years bridal collection at the Loudon Street store.

 Globally, diamonds and diamond jewellery are sold under big brand names and it is the favoured stone. Though the market in India is still in its nascent stage, big cities are projecting a very positive trend. In the past few months, our store has witnessed brisk business, revealed Zaveri.

 Calcutta specially has developed a romance with the precious stone. Calcuttans prefer contemporary pieces, while the very ordinary and commercial ones are kept at bay. The clientele here is more exposed to national and international trends, he explained.

 The latest bridal collection consists of 18-carat jewellery in white gold and diamonds. The designs are very contemporary with a European sensibility.

 The gaudy and heavy pieces are on their way out. It is the age of light, elegant and sleek design, he stressed.

 The collection includes pendants, necklaces, earrings and bangles.

 The eye-catchers come at a price, starting at Rs 50,000 and going up to Rs 2,000,000.

 The bridal collection will be on display from June 13 to June 18.

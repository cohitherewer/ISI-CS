 The magic of music and movies just gets bigger in Calcutta, and the countrys leading music retail chain continues to make harmony while the tunes shine on Tagore turf. MusicWorld (Park Street) has remained the countrys top-grossing music retail outlet, with reported sales of over Rs 9 crore last year, and even higher projections.

 We are expecting a turnover of Rs 12 crore this fiscal at our Park Street mother store, which contributes around 80 per cent of the one lakh-plus footfall across our stores in Calcutta, Chetan Arora, regional manager, Music World Entertainment Limited, said on Thursday.

 The group announced the opening of its new Express store in Gariahaat Mall next to Bijon Setu, to be inaugurated by Suchitra Mitra (our lucky mascot) and Arjun Chakraborty on Friday. The 263rd store of the chain comes in the wake of MusicWorlds maiden standalone foray into Mumbai (the Flora Fountain store opened on Wednesday).

 The Gariahaat Mall outlet, the 15th in Bengal, will have a greater stress on the visual format, with a predominantly regional orientation in both audio and video formats. There will be the classics of Ray, Ghatak, Sen and other masters, besides contemporary Bengali top-draw videos like Chokher Bali and, of course, leading Bollywood and Hollywood titles, Arora said.

 The groups fresh focus on home videos has been triggered by response at the Park Street flagship. While DVD sales doubled last year, VCDs grew by 50 per cent. As the Gariahat store is small, we can put only around 6,000 titles across formats on the racks. But the customer request log (CRL) will allow patrons to procure their favourites, Arora promised.

 MusicWorld is gearing up to add three more stores in the city over the next quarter, including a 700-sq-ft Express outlet in Hiland Parks The Metropolis mall, next to the upcoming multiplex. While one-fifth of the chains half-a-million national footfall comes from Calcutta, the city accounts for 25 per cent of MusicWorlds Rs 73-crore all-India sales.

 Calcutta also has the strongest appreciation for Indian classical music, which is reflected in the 10 per cent of the sales pie the genre constitutes here, as compared to the country average of three per cent, said Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman, RPG Enterprises.

 The Gariahaat Mall Express store, which will stay open seven days a week, will also offer the free CD-cleaning facility that was test-marketed at Park Street for the first time.

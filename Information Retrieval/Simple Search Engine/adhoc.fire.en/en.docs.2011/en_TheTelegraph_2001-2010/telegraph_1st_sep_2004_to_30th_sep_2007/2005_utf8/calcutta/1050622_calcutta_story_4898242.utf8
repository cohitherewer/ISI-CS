 Gains from trade tilt

 Wooing the wealthy has started yielding electoral dividends for the Left. The results of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Bidhannagar Municipality indicate that the Left has found a new support base in the city?s Hindi-speaking business community. 

 ?Party candidate Bharti Jha?s win from ward 23 proves our acceptance among the non-Bengali voters and the business community,? said Sudhanshu Sil, CPM parliamentarian from Calcutta northeast. 

 The seat ? in the Burrabazar area, traditionally known as an anti-Left bastion ? has come back to Left after a gap of 15 years. Jha, a Hindi-speaking candidate herself, won by a margin of over 3,000 votes. 

 ?We call ward 23 mini India because it has a diverse mix of voters. The fact that our candidate has won from such a seat augurs well for the party,? added Sil, surprise winner from Calcutta North East in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. 

 CPM candidate Arup Adhikary?s victory from ward 26, with a significant Hindi-speaking population, has also come as a pleasant surprise for the Left, now basking in the glory of 14 more seats in the city and an addition of six to the tally in the township. 

 The credit goes to the effort in aligning with the city?s cosmopolitan culture. From designing innovative campaigns to fielding candidates from business communities, primarily Marwari and Gujarati, the affluent society was very much on Left?s focus in 2005 CMC elections. 

 Though the Left?s biggest bets ? businessmen Nawal Joshi in ward 63 and Dipak Sharma in ward 22 ? lost, the leadership has reasons to be happy. 

 ?I am satisfied that I could give a tough fight to my opponent,? said Joshi after losing to Ajit Panja, Trinamul Congress mayoral candidate, by 200-plus votes. 

 It was the same story for the likes of Ratna Devi Sonkar (ward 25), Ratanlal Agarwal (ward 45), Joyesh C. Mehta (ward 72) and Sadhna Agarwal (ward 74). 

 Observers argue that the result for these candidates could have been better. 

 ?While leaders were supporting candidates like Joshi and Sharma, ordinary workers were missing in action. The Left?s trademark concerted effort and electoral gameplan was just not there,? said a businessman. 

 But with vote share increasing in Hindi-speaking localities, the Left leaders are happy and confident to cash in on this support base in 2006 Assembly polls. 

 ?There has been a swing in our favour, both in the city and Salt Lake. It is, however, true that the magic did not work in south Calcutta,? summed up a CPM functionary.

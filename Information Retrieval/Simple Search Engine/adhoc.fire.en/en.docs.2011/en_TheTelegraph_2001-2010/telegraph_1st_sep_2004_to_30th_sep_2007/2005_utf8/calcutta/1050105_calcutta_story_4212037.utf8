Indiscriminate dumping of litter on city roads is 

set to become a thing of the past, with mayor Subrata Mukherjee flagging off a 

campaign on Tuesday to keep Calcutta clean. 

The ?Year of Cleaner City? campaign was launched by 

Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) with an official call to boycott shops and 

households that dump garbage on the road. 

?Boycott! Socially boycott this establishment for 

improper dumping of wastes on road in spite of repeated warnings? read the posters 

to be pasted on the walls of guilty business establishments and apartments.

While launching the campaign, the mayor said: ?The 

posters will be put up on the walls of business establishments and residential 

estates if they continue to litter roads despite caution notices.? 

The posters, bearing the official emblem of the CMC, 

will come in two colours ? greenish-yellow for business establishments and orange 

for residential buildings. 

?I want to put an end to the practice of treating 

the city like an open litterbin. A section of citizens dump garbage wherever they 

feel like. We collect conservancy charges from business establishments, but that 

does not give them the right to litter the roads and pavements,? added the mayor.

According to official estimates, 20 per cent of the 

garbage generated daily in the city is dumped on the roads. ?This means 600 tonnes 

of garbage is dumped on the roads every day,? said a civic official. 

In several parts of the city, including Tiljala, Topsia, 

Behala, Beleghata, Tangra, Tollygunge and Jadavpur, it has become common practice 

among traders to dump garbage into the drains, thus choking the system, officials 

added. 

The campaign will be a continuous one and civic officials 

will be on the roads with receipt books, slapping fines on the spot, said municipal 

commissioner Debashis Som. Pedestrians caught dumping garbage on the roads and 

pavements will have to pay a Rs-20 fine.

Roadside eateries and food vendors will be the primary 

target of the campaign, CMC officials said. Since there is no provision to put 

up boycott notices at vendors? kiosks, the conservancy department will collect 

heavy penalty, up to Rs 500, from them. 

Soon after the mayor launched the campaign, a team 

of conservancy officers, led by mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb, 

visited business establishments that sell garments and fast food in the Esplanade 

area and pasted boycott notices on their walls.

?We served them reminders earlier, but without a positive 

result,? Deb said. 

?We hail the campaign, but I request the mayor not 

to concentrate on garbage alone. He must clear encroachments in front of shops 

in the civic markets,? said Tarak Nath Trivedi, president of Federation of Traders? 

Organisation.

The mayor has also directed council member Deb to 

undertake an afternoon sweeping drive at important junctions in Calcutta. 

City roads are now cleaned once in the morning. In 

the first phase of the drive, afternoon sweeping will be undertaken thrice a week.

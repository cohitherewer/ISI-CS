 Youth team takes on veteran

 Biswajit Saha: Banking on youth appeal

 Biswajit Saha was not even born when Radhika Ranjan Pramanik won his first Assembly election in 1967.

 Come June 19, the 25-year-old student leader, CPM candidate from ward 6, will take on five-term MP and seven-term MLA Pramanik in the Bidhannagar municipal polls. 

 The Trinamul Congress is projecting Pramanik as its chairman candidate, and the CPM is banking on Saha?s youth appeal to woo voters. 

 ?The party has given me the responsibility and I am trying my best. I am from the locality, and I will always be available to serve the people,? claims the commerce graduate from Vidyasagar College. He is the youngest candidate in the township?s civic polls.

 With Pramanik, a CPM-turned-Trinamul Congress leader, in the opposition ? and a virtually non-existent Congress candidate (Binoy Sha) ? the ward is crucial in the CPM?s electoral game in the township.

 But the party is not resorting to the usual show of strength ? mega rallies or hi-tech campaigning. ?We are focusing on door-to-door campaign, visiting homes and interacting with voters,? says a local CPM leader.

 Party veteran Jyoti Basu is also lending his weight to the campaign. Earlier this week, he had held a meeting with the Hindi-speaking residents in the township.

 In ward 6 (which has around 50 per cent Hindi-speaking voters), a team from Jawaharlal Nehru University is visiting the Hindi-speaking homes with an appeal to vote for Saha. 

 ?He is a young candidate and we want him to win,? says Amitayu Sengupta, a Ph.D student in the central university. 

 Pramanik, unfazed by the CPM?s mode of campaign, is not interested to discuss the age difference with his rival.

 ?I am identifying the issues that the last board had failed to address. Water, drainage and sewerage, security concerns are the real problems here and we have a long-term plan to offer solutions,? boasts Pramanik. He is banking on Mamata Banerjee?s appeal. ?We are expecting a consolidation of anti-Left votes,? he sums up.

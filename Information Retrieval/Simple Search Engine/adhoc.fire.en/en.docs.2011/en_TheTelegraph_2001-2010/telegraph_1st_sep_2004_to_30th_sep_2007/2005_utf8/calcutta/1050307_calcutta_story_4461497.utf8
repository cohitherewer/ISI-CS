 In a bid to boost export of tea, the state government on Sunday announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind tea park.

 State industries minister Nirupam Sen made the announcement while inaugurating a state-of-the-art tea cleaning, processing, blending and packaging unit of Premier?s Tea Limited (PTL).

 ?The West Bengal government is going to develop a tea park at Kidderpore in collaboration with Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and the tea board. The Union ministry of commerce and industries is funding the project,? the minister said.

 CPT chairman A.K. Chanda said: ?A 13-acre plot near Kidderpore, belonging to the CPT, has been allotted for the tea park. The Centre has given Rs 28 crore for the project. The project report is currently being prepared.?

 The tea park will have the best of infrastructure to facilitate the processing of export-quality tea.

 While the CPT will develop the basic infrastructural facilities, the state government will invite tea companies for building the super infrastructure. However, the time-frame for the project is yet to be worked out. Minister Sen said that work on the park would commence shortly. 

 PTL is one of the companies that currently exports tea. The inauguration of its tea-processing and cleaning plant was the company?s first foray into the domestic market. 

 Hasmukh A. Shah, chairman and managing director of PTL, said at the inauguration: ?We have set up this plant in Calcutta with the intention of raising the purity level of Indian tea. We want to reach out to not only the global market, but also to the quality-conscious Indian buyer.?

 Shah added: ?The plant has facilities for everything ? from cleaning impurities in the tea to grading it, colour-sorting it and blending, as well as bulk packaging it in vacuumed aluminium foil sacks. This makes it the only plant of its kind in Southeast Asia, barring Japan.?

 The fully air-conditioned and pollution-free plant is spread over nearly 60,000 sq ft. It will have the capacity to process approximately 3,000 kg of orthodox and 4,000 kg of C.T.C. tea a day. The plant also has tea-bag-making machines and other filling and packaging machines for niche and consumer markets in both domestic and export segments.

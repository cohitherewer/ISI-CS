 Money vs mind matters

 - Schools meet to list challenges, hammer out effective policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Government and political interference. Unionised staff. Cell phone abuse and the demands of over-ambitious parents. 

 Faced with a host of challenges, principals of over 130 Anglo-Indians schools across the country gathered in the city on Wednesday to try and formulate an effective policy to cope with these new problems and uphold their traditional concept of broadbased education.

 The Anglo-Indian schools still figure high on the list of preferred educational institutions in Calcutta.

 As their heads assembled for the four-day meet at Loreto House on Wednesday, they identified at least a dozen new challenges facing them. 

 ?What is worrying us is the rapidly-growing number of high-achieving schools that evaluate education and success purely in terms of money,? said an official.

 In Calcutta itself, more than 200 private English-medium schools have come up during the past five years.

 The rise in their number has increased the competition for the old Anglo-Indian institutions, of which Calcutta has about 50. 

 ?There is no doubt that our schools are under constant pressure to change our traditional concept of imparting all-round, value-based education. Otherwise, we stand to lose our students to these high-achieving institutions,? admitted F. Abraham, head of La Martiniere Girls? College, Lucknow, and president of the national-level body of the schools? association. 

 The heads of the institutions stressed: ?Today, when the new schools are churning out a generation that sets values only in terms of money, the philosophy of Anglo-Indian schools has become more important. We have to guide the young generation in the right direction.?

 Regretting the difficulty faced by most Anglo-Indian schools in finding teachers, who firmly believed in the mission of Anglo-Indian education, Abraham said in her presidential address: ?The best school is where the mind is nurtured like a sensitive plant and commitment to work overshadows petty differences.?

 J. K. Sen, general secretary of the Calcutta chapter of the association and principal, Julien Day School, Ganganagar, said a series of workshops and seminars will be organised during the next four days.

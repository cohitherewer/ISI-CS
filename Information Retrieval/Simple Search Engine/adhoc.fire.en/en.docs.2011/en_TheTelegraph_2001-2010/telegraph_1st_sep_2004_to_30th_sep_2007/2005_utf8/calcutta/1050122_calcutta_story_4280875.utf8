 I went to Kumartuli and Kashi Mitra ghats on the occasion of Magh Purnima and 

found them in a deplorable condition. A heap of garbage and broken pots were strewn 

around in the area. Most of the stairs were broken. Many aged persons visit the 

ghat for religious purposes and chances are they might meet with accidents any 

day while negotiating these stairs. In the absence of a garbage bin most visitors 

also see no alternative but to dispose of the flowers and other items used in 

offering prayers by the river. The civic body should renovate all the ghats and 

instal garbage bins so that the problem is curbed to some extent.

 Authorities should make it mandatory that organisers of any public programme 

held after dusk should make the provision of automated emergency lights. Generators 

often take a few minutes to start functioning and in the meantime there is a risk 

of a stampede at a crowded auditorium or pandal. This holds for events like Chhat 

puja on the river banks as well.

 In hundreds of roadside welding shops in the city and elsewhere, labourers 

are seen engaged in welding work without any protective gear. Not only do the 

labourers stand the risk of losing their eyesight but passers-by also might be 

affected if they accidentally look at the sparks emitted during welding work from 

close. There should be a rule to stop such work to be carried out in the open 

and also make it mandatory for the labourers to wear protective glasses and gloves.

 It is very unfortunate that when the state is suffering from power crisis most 

of the year, streetlights on many roads in the Budge Budge municipal area are 

kept switched on at least till 7 am. What a waste of public exchequer! 

 Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge. 

 I have a BSNL landline and a CellOne connection. Now, BSNL has separate counters 

for the two types of phone connections because of which we are forced to go to 

different post offices and cash counters to pay the two bills. Why doesn?t BSNL 

accept landline and cell phone bills at the same counter for customers who have 

both types of connections? If BSNL is reluctant to provide such small but essential 

services, private players will soon erode its customer base. 

 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.

 Trauma care puts director back on feet

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The wheelchair and the cervical brace notwithstanding, Anup Sengupta is in great spirits, ready to take his rightful place behind the camera again to do what he likes best ? weaving celluloid sagas.

 The frames were hardly as fond on that fateful January night, though, when the 47-year-old Tollywood director survived a potentially-fatal road crash, which had left him in a state of paralysis. 

 Following a six-hour surgery on his injured cervical spine at a city hospital, he can now move his limbs again and stand without support. The cameras are ready to roll again, too, and a shooting trip to Hyderabad is lined up.

 ?It?s a miracle I can move and work again,? Sengupta says. Actress-wife Piya, his screen hero Prosenjit and the rest of the Tollywood gang all wanted to take him to ?Bangalore or Chennai? after the mishap. The director suffered a severe neck injury when his Scorpio collided with a lorry on the EM Bypass, near the Salt Lake stadium.

 He was rushed to Suraksha Hospital, in Salt Lake, and later shifted to the Armenian Church Trauma Center (ACTC) in Mukundapur, off the Bypass. 

 The ?only specialised trauma care unit in the East? impressed upon the Senguptas and their Tollywood friends the need for early surgery.

 ?The cervical trauma had led to near-total paraplegia, with zero power in the lower limbs and only Grade I power in the upper limbs, and the patient was on catheter,? recounts Pratap Kr. Pani, senior consultant, neuro and spinal surgery, ACTC. 

 An MRI scan revealed C3-4, 4-5, 5-6 traumatic disc prolapse with cord contusion.

 ?We told them immediate spine surgery could reverse the paralytic symptoms and give the patient a chance to walk again, and they decided to stay here,? says Pani, who operated on Sengupta on January 19, two days after the mishap. 

 The six-hour procedure was an anterior cervical discectomy on C3-4, 4-5, 5-6 with stabilisation and iliac bone graft and with plating.

 Sengupta ? with hits like Mayer Achol, Paribar and Rajababu under his belt and Dadar Adesh scheduled for a May rollout ? was discharged on February 9. 

 ?By then, the power in his limbs had improved to Grade III and he was off catheter, which reaffirms that early surgery in such trauma cases can do wonders,? says Pani. He has performed more than 500 disc discectomy procedures at St Johns Medical College, Bangalore, before joining ACTC.

 ?We derived strength from the Christopher Reeve saga and the support of the industry, with seniors like Mithunda (Chakraborty) a source of constant reassurance,? says Piya Sengupta, who was in ?a state of shock? after the accident.

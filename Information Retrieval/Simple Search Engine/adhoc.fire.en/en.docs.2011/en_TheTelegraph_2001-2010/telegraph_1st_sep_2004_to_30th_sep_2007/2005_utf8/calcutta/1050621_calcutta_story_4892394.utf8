 A social dilemma

 Relationships form the basis of human life and society. Yet, the complexity of life entails that there exists a perpetual undercurrent of tension and conflict in human relationships. Clashes of attitude, perspective and ideology further intensify the problem. Samparka highlights these problems as encountered by Hiten, Niloy, Batabyal, Smita and Ruchira. Caught in whirlpools created by themselves in their individual search for happiness and fulfilment in life, they are all representative figures of their respective generations and milieu. While some attempt to realise their personal ambitions by dint of their own industry and enthusiasm, others, more reckless, pay no heed to values or morals in their quest for success and recognition in life and society. While some intend to find happiness through an abundance of wealth and luxury, acquired through dishonest means, others seek to discover and experience the joy of living through love. Written by Amalesh Chakraborty, the play raises critical questions about the meaning and value of human relationships in a society deprived of ideals, and a society in which there is a dreadful discord between success and morality. Direction: Malay Biswas.

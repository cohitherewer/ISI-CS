The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Touching tale, simply told

Sometimes, a stray ad reminds us that advertising is 

as much about selling dreams as about selling products

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

You 

may have already seen the ad. It tells you the story about a young boy growing 

up in one of the unknown small towns of India. His only encounter with a plane 

was to see them flying many thousands of feet up in the sky. Yet he dreamt of 

aircraft. A small sticker with a drawing of an aeroplane was his prized possession. 

The boy?s father is an ordinary man, presumably engaged in a humble profession. 

Sensing his son?s obsession, he carves an aircraft out of a piece of wood. The 

son is overwhelmed.

Many years later, the now ageing father receives an 

envelope from his son. It contains an air ticket. His father can now fly to meet 

his son. This ordinary man from an ordinary town enjoys his first experience of 

flying, thanks to Air Deccan. In his hand baggage he carries the wooden aircraft 

for that no longer little boy. The signature line is apt ? ?Simplyflying?. A touching 

tale, simply told.

There are millions of ads that are shown on television. 

Some you remember, some you ignore. Some you enjoy, others irritate you. A pertinent 

question can be, why discuss this one ? is it great advertising? That in turn 

begs another query ? what is great advertising?

The answer is not too difficult to find. The criterion 

for judging an ad is expectedly its creativity. To create, as any dictionary would 

tell us, is to bring into being something that did not exist before. Creativity 

is thus the ability to create well. More original it is, greater is the appreciation. 

Yet the concept of creativity in advertising is possibly somewhat one-eyed. Where 

we tend to falter is by judging creativity in advertising largely by its form.

Many years back, sometime in the late 70s, there was 

this campaign from Jenson amp; Nicholson. It said: ?Whenever you see colour think 

of us.? The campaign deliberately avoided showing hackneyed symbols of colour, 

like butterflies and rainbows. Instead, it created its own library of unusual 

objects that had vibrant colours ? a lit matchstick for example. The campaign 

was hailed as an all-time great. Justifiably so, it created a new visual idiom. 

The Air Deccan ad is not in the same league. Its simple narrative style does not 

have the smartness or the elements of surprise of the Jenson amp; Nicholson campaign. 

Yet it can easily put forward its claim to be bracketed with such great advertising.

For, the Air Deccan campaign shows creativity in its 

content. Air Deccan, being a low-cost airline, is trying to expand the air-travel 

market. It wants ordinary people who usually travel by train to experience the 

joy of flying, which has always been an emblem of middle-class aspiration. It 

is as much a symbol of class transition as ownership of a Maruti 800 or a Samsung 

refrigerator. Most of us in this country have grown up with the romanticism of 

that little boy in the ad. This ad captures a deep-rooted sentiment, a long cherished 

dream of millions that constitute its target group. It could have easily said, 

?Now you can also fly, the fares are so cheap? and shown good-looking air hostesses, 

plush interiors, five-star ambience of an airport, et al. Instead, it created 

a new idiom of communication.

Advertising people are often called dream merchants. 

Somewhere along the line, they had stopped selling dreams. All too often, we have 

seen blatant attempts to sell in their work. The Air Deccan ad stands out because 

it simply reminds us of a dream. It demonstrates an understanding of an unfulfilled 

consumer need that exists.

It was creative by not creating.

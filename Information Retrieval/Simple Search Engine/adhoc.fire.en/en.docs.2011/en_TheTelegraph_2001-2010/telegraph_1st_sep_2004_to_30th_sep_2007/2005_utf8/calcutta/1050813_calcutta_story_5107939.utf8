 Tipped off by local residents, the civic authorities and police on Friday morning stopped illegal felling of a mango tree on a private plot at Beler More, in Narendrapur. One man has been arrested and a hunt is on for the owner of the plot.

 Officers said the tree was being felled on orders from Sankar Prasad Majumdar, whose sister owns the plot, to make room for a multi-storeyed building. He was reportedly present when his men started chopping off the branches, but has been absconding since.

 The felling was noticed by Tapan Bhowmik and his neighbours, who immediately contacted local municipality commissioner Tarapada Das.

 Das rushed to the spot and asked the labourers why they were felling the tree and who had hired them. The men could neither give an answer nor produce any sanction letter. They even ignored Das?s order to stop the felling.

 Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality chairman Kamal Ganguly, in the meantime, reached the spot with some officers from Sonarpur police station. He, too, gave a similar order, which the labourers could not wish away because of the presence of police.

 Ganguly later said the men were deployed by Bapi Mondal, a contractor hired by Majumdar. Mondal failed to produce a consent order from the pollution control board, forest department or the municipality.

 ?No one can cut down a tree without consent from the authorities concerned,? Ganguly said. ?We have come to know that the plot belongs to Majumdar?s sister, who has recently shifted to Garia. On behalf of his sister, he took the initiative to construct a multi-storeyed building.?

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said: ?I have asked my officers to issue a stop-work notice at once. Action will be taken against the guilty.?

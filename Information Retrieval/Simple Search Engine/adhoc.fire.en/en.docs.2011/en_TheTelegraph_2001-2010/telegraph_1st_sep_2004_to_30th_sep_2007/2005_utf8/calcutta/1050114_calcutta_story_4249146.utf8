embroidery has survived through centuries

Zardosi ? the magnificent metallic embellishment 

of India ? dates back to ancient times. It finds mention in Vedic literature, 

the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and all accounts of the Sultanate 

period. The country, from very early times, was known for the use of gold embroidery 

on a variety of objects including furnishings, trappings, parasols, and equestrian 

ornaments. The more aesthetic and evolved embroideries were used on court costumes 

and especially on accessories such as shoes. 

The historical accounts of this craft are shrouded 

in the usual romantic stories and inaccurate data. But the only certainty is that 

zarkas ? a Persian word meaning zari or gold embroidery ? was widely 

used in all the accounts. History says that from the 13th century, the craftspeople 

who worked with this medium, setting seed pearls and precious stones with use 

of fine gold and silver wire, were known as the zardos workers. 

In the course of my studies I found a little nugget, 

a legend popular with the zardosi workers of Delhi that relates to the 

origin of this craft. Strangely enough, it was an account of a shoe, especially 

embroidered in gold and silver, which was used to hit the reigning king on the 

head as it was believed to cure a specific brain malady.

Of all the crafts of the country, the zardosi 

seems to have flourished and survived to the present day like none other. 

My first encounter with the zardosi craftsmen 

was in 1972 in Calcutta. I had begun work on revival of patterns of old hand blocks. 

And, while studying miniature paintings of Akbar?s period, I got an insight into 

the sophistication of the colour palette and delicacy of embroidery and motifs 

used on the costumes of the royalty of that time. I was in search of a costume 

or a swatch of work of the 15th or 16th century, when it was said that the craft 

was at its peak. I was curious to experiment with the embroidery and the use of 

thread and gold. It turned into a futile exercise, as at that time there was no 

reference either in a museum or library, which could have been enlightening. 

Walking around Calcutta?s New Market, the Marwari 

area of Burra Bazaar, or Chandni Chowk near Red Fort in old Delhi, looking for 

the embroideries, brought home to me the fact that we had lost yet another vocabulary. 

There was some highly skilled workmanship available, but the base fabrics, the 

plastic replacements of pure gold and the motifs were so far removed from the 

original, that the product did not resemble what had at one time bedazzled visitors 

to the royal courts of India. 

Then one day, two young zardosi craftsmen walked 

into my studio. They had heard that I was making enquiries about the embroideries. 

I inducted them into the development programme of our attempt to revive an old 

aesthetic. 

In the marketplace, tinsel had replaced gold. As a 

substitute, we used plastic-drawn wire wrapped in cotton thread, to dull the tawdriness 

of lure, and thus, sought to recreate the burnished look, which with its depth 

of richness and beauty had transcended time. Material was dyed, thread was sourced, 

and swatch after swatch of beautifully embroidered textiles was created, matching 

miniatures and reference materials. I could not help being impressed by the high 

degree of skill that our zardos craftsmen still possessed.

As a commercial proposition, they were keen to complete 

pieces in their own villages. Curious to visit these areas, I made trips to Bengal?s 

districts, old Delhi, Farukhabad and Lucknow. In these areas survive the zardosi 

workers who practice their crafts in their huts. An image far removed, as one 

conceives it, from Mughal India and its formal karkhanas (court workshops), 

where the craft reached its zenith. 

During the last 50 years, the revival of zardosi 

has been phenomenal. Not only did it find its way into designer outlets, but is 

being used yet again for interiors of mega weddings, in and out of Bollywood. 

Today the Indian ramp is ablaze with alternatives that the craftspeople work with 

? the materials may not have the same aesthetic of the Mughals, but are catering 

to the demand of highly-ornamented garments with glittering beads and sequins. 

If you happen to spot a slinky sequinned gown at an 

Oscar award ceremony, designed by John Galliano or Georgio Armani, chances are 

that the workmanship is of Indian origin. With the change in times and demand, 

the zardosi craftsman is vital to the garments ?en vogue? in Hollywood 

and Bollywood. 

The richness of gold may no longer grace the work 

of zardosi craftsman, but the glitter and glamour endures, hopefully, for 

all years to come. Zardosi is as tenacious as the wires the craftsmen work 

with.

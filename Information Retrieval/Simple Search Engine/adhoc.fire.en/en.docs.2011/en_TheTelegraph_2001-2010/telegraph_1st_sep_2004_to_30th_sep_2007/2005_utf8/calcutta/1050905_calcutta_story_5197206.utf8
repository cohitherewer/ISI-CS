 Mayor soft on park puja stalls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ending weeks of speculation, the civic body on Sunday declared that there would be no bar on community Pujas organised in parks it maintains.

 ?Durga puja is the biggest of Bengali festivals. No rules and regulations on parks will be applicable during the festive days,? announced mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, as several organisers heaved a sigh of relief. 

 He asked municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to ensure that pujas are left beyond the rules governing parks owned and maintained by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The point of discord was whether the organisers of pujas in civic parks should be allowed to let out space to stalls, from which they earn a considerable amount. Last year, then municipal commissioner Debashis Som, on orders from mayor Subrata Mukherjee, had directed the organisers not to use park grounds for commercial purposes.

 Mayor Bhattacharya?s comment is being seen as a clear hint that the organisers can rake in a chunk of their Puja budget by letting out space to stalls.

 ?It?s good that the mayor has decided to be flexible in this matter. Now, there should not be any difficulty in allowing pujas in our parks and setting up of stalls,? said mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

 Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, however, has stuck to his stand. ?Organisers mint money by letting out CMC pavements and parks. Organisers of some of the big community pujas even ask for salami from stall-owners,? he said.

 Before the last Pujas, he had said that the civic body, after spending more than Rs 10 crore on beautifying the parks, would not allow them to be destroyed during the Pujas.

 Of the 136 CMC parks, around 125 are used for organising community pujas. 

 Some of the big-ticket pujas ? like College Square, Maddox Square, Mohammad Ali Park, Triangular Park, Deshapriya Park, Ladies? Park and Santosh Mitra Square? are held in parks.

 The organisers, who claim to spend lakhs each, have told the CMC that stalls were their primary source of income.

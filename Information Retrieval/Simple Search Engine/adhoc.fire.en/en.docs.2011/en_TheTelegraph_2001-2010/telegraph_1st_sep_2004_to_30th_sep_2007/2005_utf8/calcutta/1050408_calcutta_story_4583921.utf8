 ?Fear made me work hard?

 Denzel Washington

 During his working vacation away from Hollywood, Denzel Washington may be willing to go without the luxury trailer, but the bodyguard stays. A very large bearded man leads the way to a small room in Belasco Theatre where Washington, in a long-sleeved T-shirt and jeans, is relaxing before a rehearsal for Julius Caesar.

 Washington got his theatre chops in the late 1970s at Fordham University. He eventually put in his time in various off-Broadway productions. Once his film career took off, he?s rarely made it back to the theatre, except for a Broadway show called Checkmates and a production of Richard III in Shakespeare in the Park in 1990.

 Now playing Brutus, Washington is adjusting to the high-wire act of live theatre ? and yes, he says in an interview to NYTNS, it?s a lot more work than film.

It?s been 15 years since you last performed on 

stage in New York, and now you?re doing Shakespeare. Did you do anything in advance 

to prepare?

 Fear made me work hard. The whole month of January, I worked with the Shakespeare expert ? the dramaturge Dakin Matthews and I worked together the whole month of January. I took a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont and everyday I worked for about eight hours, three or four with him, three or four on my own, six days a week, for the month of January. Not so much learning the lines but understanding the world, understanding the play, and trying to understand what everybody?s saying to me. Which is really important. Just really getting to know the play and feeling comfortable, or trying to feel comfortable, coming in on my lines.

It sounds like a pretty entertaining way to spend 

a month. 

 It?s fear! It?s fun, but it was ? it?s like, I didn?t want to come in here unprepared. And you don?t know if you?re going to know those lines until you do. Once we got into a week or so of rehearsal I was like, okay, I can remember. In a film, you take a scene, you work a day. I hadn?t done a play in 15 years. So who knows? But thank God, I remember. 

What did the dramaturge point out to you about 

the play that you hadn?t thought about before?

 Well, I hadn?t thought about anything. Yeah, yeah, like I just sit around thinking about Julius Caesar all the time.

Okay, so where?d he start? 

 Oh, there?s a whole lot of back and forth about stoicism, and Brutus being a stoic, or was he or was he not, and I?m like, who cares? This idea that he was a thinker and not very passionate ? needless to say, that?s not the way I?m playing it. I think he?s very passionate, about Rome. He just makes the wrong decisions. He trusts people, he?s honourable, he sees the good in people. But it?s a very complicated role. He?s this very honourable man who decides to murder somebody for the good of Rome.

Were there any scenes that were particularly tough 

to get a handle on?

 Yeah, the soliloquy. Because who?s Brutus talking to? Is he talking to the audience? Those soliloquies are just awkward. It?s stagey. It?s thought out loud, in front of a thousand people. It would be easier to do in a film. But it?s hard to achieve that intimacy on stage.

The critics weren?t crazy about your performance 

in Richard III, when you starred in Shakespeare in the Park. What did you 

figure out from that experience?

 Get four weeks of previews. We did about three previews in that show. Also, trust my own instincts. I?m not going to put any blame on anyone, but I didn?t trust what I felt was right, I listened to others. And I?ll leave it at that. And that?s what I?ve learned from that, and I?ve applied it for the last 15 years. 

Is that why it?s taken so long for you to come 

back to theatre, because that was kind of a tough experience?

 It wasn?t a tough experience. 

But it has to be pretty exhausting compared to 

film work.

 It is hard work. I look like I?m working pretty hard up there, doesn?t it? Bending over backward, falling all over the floor, spitting on everybody in the front row ? it?s work. I go home and go to bed. I don?t hang out at all, because I need my rest and we?re still rehearsing.

So why knock yourself out? It?s obviously not for 

the money.

 It?s like a long love letter to the people who supported me. You know, you do a film, you get a crew of 200, they?re used to doing films, you move on, you don?t really interact with people too much. You go to the premiere, they got everybody cordoned off across the street, but there?s no place other than maybe the supermarket where you really engage with people who are there to see you perform. There?s nothing like the theatre. You find out every night whether they like you or not. One night I had somebody boo. That was great! He was like, Booo, Brutus, booo!

He didn?t like the performance?

 No, it was during the play, he thought Brutus shouldn?t have killed Caesar. But I liked it! I was like, Thank you! Thank you! He got it!

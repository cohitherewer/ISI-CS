 The recent developments in Indo-US relations, with 

special emphasis on trade and terrorism, was the issue under discussion at American 

Center at an interactive session on March 21. The organisers were two first-year 

journalism and mass communication students of Calcutta University, Sumit Dey and 

Arghya Chowdhury, with technical support from the hosts. The focal point of the 

session was the book People, Progress, Partnership: The Transformation Of Indo-US 

Relations, published by the US Embassy in New Delhi. 

 Coordinating the session, Bhaskar K. Rajah, deputy director of American Center, emphasised the importance of research on the part of journalists. He also highlighted the US contribution in setting up agricultural research centres, technology and management education institutes, multipurpose river valley projects and the introduction of eco-friendly and energy-efficient vehicles in India. 

 One journalist backed the improvement in Indo-US relations over the past decade, pointing to US support to India during the Kashmir elections and the Kargil War. Another guest speaker said the pace of the improvement in relations has not been encouraging, stressing on the fact that the improvement in the bilateral relations has not percolated to the grassroot level, as problems in procurement of visas, common concerns regarding inflation and security continue to exist. 

 But the CU journalism and mass communication students stole the show, impressing the audience with their polemical eloquence. Paroma Roy did some awesome number-crunching, using statistics and records while referring to India?s 1998 nuclear tests, September 11 and India?s liberalisation of the economy since 1991, terming them milestones in recent developments in India?s relations with the US. 

 She pointed to 53 joint military exercises between the two countries in 2000-05, the five US insurance houses doing commendable business in India in collaboration with India-based business enterprises, FBI?s cooperation with the CBI and Interpol for the capture of Abu Salem, Bill Clinton?s address to the Indian parliament and the recent visit of Condoleezza Rice to India as some of the high points in the progressive improvement of Indo-US relations over the years. 

 Rashmi Jaiswal?s critique of the book under discussion was marked by raw vigour tempered by thoughtful observations. She noted the statistical authenticity of the book, but at the same time was relentless in lashing out at the loose ends and the visible adoration of the Uncle Sam attitude of the US that the book presented. 

 Her vociferous satire of US opportunistic utilitarianism covered issues like the brain drain, the superficial glamour associated with the BPO industry, the US?s use of India as a dumping ground for banned pharmaceutical products, pesticides in soft drinks, India?s contention for UN veto power, US humiliation of George Fernandez and Narendra Modi, the 1993 Mumbai blasts and India?s refusal to accept foreign aid for the areas affected by the tsunami of December 2004. 

 Sumit Dey, speaking of the recent attempts at bridging the Indo-US digital divide, cited better amenities provided by the US in a Hyderabad school as incentives for education, expansion of India?s consumer goods market, a US ban on the Lashkar-e-Toiba and changes in intellectual property rights as signs of a good friendship. 

 In the lively panel-audience interaction that followed, in between sips of cha and nibbles at snacks, ?relationship? was hailed as a term with essentially emotional connotations. The emphasis was on the need for acceleration in improving Indo-US relations, in the context of the common factors of mixed culture and struggle for independence shared by the people of two of the world?s largest democracies. 

 The absorbing session ended with moderator Rajah presenting copies of the book An Outline Of American History to the speakers.

 Verbal warfare

 Education and knowledge were the subjects of controversy at a recent debate. Organised by Vikramshila Education Resource Society, a unit of CRY, on March 12 at GD Birla Sabhagar, the motion of the inter-college debate was: ?This house believes that education has been commodified?. Participating colleges included NUJS, Loreto, IISWBM, South City, JD Birla and Presidency. The moderator was Barun Das. 

 Those for the motion believed that education has been reduced to nothing more than a business, being sold with the help of catchy phrases and jingles. 

 Students are being enticed into choosing a school based not on its academic qualitites, but on its swimming pools, canteens, etc. One speaker vehemently stressed that ?education has taught us to imitate and integrate, but it has not taught us to innovate?.

 The opposition begged to differ, believing that the teacher, the guru, still has a sacrosanct status in society. They argued that education is not limited merely to the ?knowledge? that the tutorial centres provide, but in fact, it encompasses the all-round development of an individual, inclusive of the value system that he grows up to live by.

 Reaching a conclusive standpoint is always difficult in such a situation. But being lauded for its efforts was the Loreto College duo comprising Rudhira Mitra and Sana Imtiaz, who won the best team trophy. Sana was also awarded the prize for the best speaker, while NUJS bagged the trophy for the second best speaker.

 Management mantra

 The face of management is changing, and Birla School of Management (BSM) and JD Birla Institute (JDBI) are taking this change in its stride. Thus, the introduction of a post-graduate diploma at BSM. The course was unveiled during a seminar and national panel discussion on ?Management Education and Entrepreneurship in an IT era?, jointly organised by BSM, JDBI, All India Management Association (AIMA)-CME and TiE at Vidya Mandir on March 19. 

 BSM has also been chosen by AIMA under an exclusive charter in Calcutta to conduct professional diplomas on human resource management, marketing, finance, insurance and risk management and international business management. Sabyasachi Sen, secretary, department of commerce and industry, government of West Bengal, was the chairman of the seminar, which was followed by an interactive session. 

 The speakers were Aniruddha Roy, director, Eveready Industries, Malavika Desai, CEO, RCG Management Consulting, N.C. Patnaik, director, AIMA, Rahul Roy, director, Ernst and Young India, Roopen Roy, managing director, PricewaterhouseCoopers, V.V. Babu, group CIO, ITC, and president, TiE, Calcutta, and Suman K. Mukerjee, director, JDBI and BSM. They awakened the young minds to the challenges in the IT era, which, when viewed with an inquisitive mind and a little management acumen, can turn into entrepreneurial opportunities.

 Small talk

 nAn orientation programme for parents was held recently at Birla High School (girls). Apart from discussions on rules and regulations, the role of parents in empowering their child was discussed. They were also told how they could contribute or involve themselves in school activities. The school counsellor spoke on effective parenting, including ways of building positive self-esteem in a child and how words that parents use to communicate are important in building self-esteem, emotional health and personal empowerment. The importance of a two-way communication process was stressed, and the need for listening. How children pick up non-verbal cues from their parents, how they misinterpret situations and how it affects them were also discussed. Incest, child sexual abuse and the role of parents in preventing them were talked about. It ended with an interactive session, where parents posed their queries and voiced their opinions.

To boost knowledge, class discussions aren?t enough. 

Free-wheeling discussions on thought-provoking issues are an important component 

of any curriculum today. So, ICFAI Business School brought students of city institutions 

under one roof at a seminar on the Indian Economy and Union Budget 2005. Speaker 

Tarun Das of CII took us through various portraits of the Indian economy and drew 

a picture of India today and tomorrow. His lecture involved comparisons and differentiations, 

providing an interesting insight into our economy. He highlighted the growth in 

the telecom sector, highways and civil aviation, and harboured hopes of India 

emerging as the food factory of the world. The event concluded with a Q amp;A 

session, where students fired a volley of questions.

 Students perform at BD Memorial Institute?s 

annual fest.

Little Champions Montessori House, started on January 

14 this year, is one of the few montessories for differently-abled children. Committed 

to creating awareness among parents regarding issues affecting special children, 

on March 23 was an interactive session on ?Development of Communication Skills?. 

The speaker was speech therapist Chandralekha Sio. She explained the importance 

of communication and the different modes. Speech is oral and instant. Speech delay 

is a common problem with special children. Speech development depends on brain 

development, integration of the senses and concept development. 

 Identification of the real cause for speech delay is important prior to treatment. In delayed language development, size, shape, colour and numbers should be taught first. In cases like ADHD, autism and mental retardation, the child will first have to learn to pay attention ? both auditory and visual. This leads to language and speech development. Multi-lingual exposure also hampers language development, more so in the case of special children. 

 nMeghnad Saha Institute of Technology presented its annual fest, Eutopian-Euphopians 2005, on March 11 and 12. Day One saw Shikhandira, a play on relevant social issues, which received loud applause from the audience. There was also DJ Ravi and a mind-blowing performance by Calcutta band Krosswindz. More action was lined up the next day. The colourful fashion show deserves special mention. Ending the fest was popular singer Abhijeet from Mumbai.

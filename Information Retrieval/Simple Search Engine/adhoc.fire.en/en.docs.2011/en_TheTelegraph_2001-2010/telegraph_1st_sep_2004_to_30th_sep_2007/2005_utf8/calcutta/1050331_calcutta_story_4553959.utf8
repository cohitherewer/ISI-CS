 The vagueness surrounding the value-added tax (VAT) turned to vexation on Wednesday, with the start of a three-day trade bandh. As most shutters remained down across the city, little respite was in sight for consumers in the countdown to April 1.

 The state government has been firm in its stand on implementing VAT from next month, and the Federation of West Bengal Trade Associations seems equally determined to ensure the success of the 72-hour trade shutdown.

 ?The bandh is very much on for the next two days. Only medicine shops and petrol pumps will remain open. Everything else will stay closed,? reiterated Mahesh Singhania of the federation, ruling out the possibility of markets opening during morning hours to enable the sale of necessary commodities.

 ?We are firm on the bandh, and there is no possibility of markets remaining open even in the early hours for the next two days,? claimed Singhania, after all 30 civic markets stayed shut through Wednesday, amidst reports of sporadic violence.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said in his Assembly chamber during the day that there was room for further discussion with the trade associations on VAT, but not while the bandh was on.

 ?The present atmosphere is not congenial for talks. The door is always open, even though several rounds of discussions have already been held. But the possibility (of talks) will arise only if the bandh is called off or postponed,? asserted Dasgupta.

 The anti-VAT camp seemed in no mood to back down. ?There is no question of calling off or postponing the bandh. We can agree to discuss the matter if the minister calls us,? said Singhania.

 There were no vegetables or fish available on Wednesday, complained Shamsuzzaman Ansari, member, mayor-in-council in charge of markets. Gariahat, New Market, Burrabazar, Koley Market, College Street market and Sealdah market remained closed.

 Dasgupta said some shop-owners in south Calcutta were threatened when they tried to pull up the shutters. The Lalbazar control room received around 25 complaints from shop-owners forced to down shutters.

 ?No one keen to keep shops open should be stopped,? warned Dasgupta. ?We are also keeping a close watch to ensure that no one tries to take advantage of the situation and push up prices.?

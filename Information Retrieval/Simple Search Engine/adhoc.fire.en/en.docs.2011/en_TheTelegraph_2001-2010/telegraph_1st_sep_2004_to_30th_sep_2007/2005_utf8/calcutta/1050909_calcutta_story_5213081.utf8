 For the sake of an heir

 Based on a true story from the court files of Bihar, Waarish tells a gruesome tale of lust, abuse of power and superstition. In his obsession to produce an heir, Chiranji Chowdhury, a wealthy, childless landlord, tries to seduce Gulabi, his wifes maid, and beget a child from her. He offers her impoverished father, Dinanath Pujari, land, property and other monetary gains in lieu. The landlord also promises that after the birth of his child, he would marry off Gulabi to Raghu, a motor mechanic with whom she is in love. Gulabi knows very well that unless she agrees to be the victim of his lascivious desires, she will suffer a fate similar to that of other young girls of her village. On her father?s advice, the superannuated Chowdhury tries to get back his long-lost virility by offering an infant-girl as human sacrifice. Meanwhile, Gulabi gets pregnant by Raghu, and they both flee to save themselves from the grasp of the landlord, determined in his desire to sire a child. Direction: Rishi Mukhopadhyay.

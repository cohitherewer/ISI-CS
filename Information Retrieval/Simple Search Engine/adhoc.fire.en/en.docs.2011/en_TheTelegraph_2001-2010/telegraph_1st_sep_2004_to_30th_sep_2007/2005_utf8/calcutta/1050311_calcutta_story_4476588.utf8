 Six days after little Gudiya was mauled by an Alsatian, trapped in the darkened home where she worked as a domestic help, her future remains dogged by uncertainty.

 The chirpy eight-year-old is fit to be discharged from hospital, but she has nowhere to go for now.

 Her mother visited Gudiya during the day, but according to hospital authorities, there was no move on her part to take the girl away.

 ?The woman identified herself as Shanti Subba. She lives on the footpath with seven more children and said she cannot afford to take Gudiya back and feed her,? said S.B. Purakaystha, president of AMRI Hospitals, where the girl is recuperating.

 The girl bears ugly wounds of the horror she underwent on the evening of March 4, after her employer Swapna Chanda had locked the front door of their Agarpara home from outside, before leaving for a few hours.

 Gudiya was attacked by one of the two pet Alsatians and by the time neighbours broke down the door and rescued the girl, she had been bitten badly on her face and back.

 Thursday found her confined to the hospital bed, with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee sending word to the AMRI authorities that Gudiya be kept in the south Calcutta hospital amidst tight security. This followed a stream of visitors landing up at the hospital and voicing interest in taking Gudiya with them. 

 Inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee called the hospital on behalf of the chief minister. ?He said the chief minister was concerned about the well-being of the girl and we assured him that the girl won?t be handed over to anyone without the proper legal procedure,? said Purakayastha.

 There was no sign of her employers, but the first to queue up, as early as 4 am, were some youths from Agarpara. Then followed a steady stream of NGOs, eager to lend a helping hand. 

 ?With so many visitors turning up, we have decided to throw a tight security ring around Gudiya,? said AMRI president Purakayastha.

 With three anti-rabies injections administered and three to go, the girl appeared in good spirits on Thursday afternoon. 

 She was playing with the nurses, seemingly untouched by the wounds she bore and untroubled by what lay ahead.

 Later on Thursday, superintendent (North) Parveen Kumar told the hospital authorities the police would help determine on Friday where Gudiya?s first steps outside the hospital would take her.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Arrests for power theft

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Seven persons have been arrested across the city and its outskirts in the past few days for power pilferage. 

 Based on complaints lodged by the CESC, sleuths conducted raids and rounded up the offenders. The raids, police say, will continue for a few more days.

 Sources in the CESC claimed they had been receiving frequent complaints of power theft from Mukundapur and its adjoining areas. A raid followed, during which officials of the power utility noticed large-scale hooking.

 Acting on the basis of the complaint lodged by them, Purba Jadavpur police raided specific spots in Mukundapur and Sahid Smriti colony and arrested three persons. Five hookings were disconnected.

 Similar raids were carried out in Bhadreswar, about 25 km from the city, in which two persons were arrested in the Angus Jute Mill staff quarters. Police at Uttarpara, adjoining Bhadreswar, also arrested two persons for power theft and removed wires used for tapping electricity illegally.

 In another incident, a group of CESC engineers from the power utility?s loss control cell were roughed up by residents of a house on Ironside Road when they tried to disconnect a meter that had been tampered with. 

 The engineers had earlier found that the meter, registered in the name of Gopal Chandra Pasari, had been tampered with and power was being stolen.

 The engineers first served a disconnection notice, but when the offenders refused to surrender the meter, they reached the site to cut supply. 

 The residents of the building then allegedly detained the engineers. They were later rescued by Karaya police.

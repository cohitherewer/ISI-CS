 Wonder weaves

 Available in vibrant hues and varied designs, durries help liven up any interior, says Himika Chaudhuri

 If the Calcutta dust and soot prevent you from touching up the interiors of your home with silk carpets and textured upholstery, there is a common-sense chic solution at hand.

 Colourful, easy-to-maintain and great-on-the-pocket durries can define your summer style. Made primarily from jute and cotton, these washable weaves can do wonders for your rooms, sitting pretty on bedcovers or sofas, low-lying seating or floors.

 Available in stripes, dots, geometric designs and floral prints, these ethnic mats can be used to add colour and a chic touch to any area of the home.

 D?cor basics

 I have used durries to do up everything from the drawing room to bedrooms and even the childrens study, says interior designer Manjari Sahay.

 If a single colour bedspread seems boring at times, place a colourful durrie on the lower half of the bed to keep it clean and add an element of cheer.

 If you dont want to place a big durrie on the bed, use two small ones near the base, coordinating the colours with the bed-sheet, adds Sahay. Thin ribbon durries can be used as a runner across the breadth of the bed also.

 In the drawing room, options of using durries increase manifold. Apart from replacing carpets, they can be used to cover sofas or be thrown on the floor with some cushions to become a low seating area.

 Even with ornate and heavy furniture, one can place a durrie under a glass-top table instead of a carpet, adds Sahay.

 Abroad the trend of using small durries (the size of a hand towel) on sofa backs and handles as a cover has caught on. It is a great way to add a touch of Indian-ness and colour at the same time, observes Sahay. 

 Pick up points

 Calcutta doesnt offer as wide a variety of these home accessories as other cities.

 The double-coloured variety in soft summer shades of pink and yellow is on sale at Shoppers Stop, priced between Rs 200 and Rs 500.

 Cocoon on Theatre Road has a small but interesting collection of durries. The state emporia in Dakshinapan have a steady flow of attractive items. The winter fairs at the Maidan are also good hunting grounds.

 Maintenance

 The USP of durries is the easy maintenance regimen they require. In Calcutta, the pollution levels make it impossible to maintain carpets, as they attract a lot of dust. Durries, on the other hand, are easy to clean, stresses homemaker Poorvi Pande.

 Light and mobile, its no problem to lift a durrie, wash it and put it out to dry without a helping hand. Just soap and water are enough to clean a durrie and no special petrol washes or vacuum cleaning is required, adds interior designer Nupur Sethi.

Adding alcohol to a cup of hot coffee can provide 

a soothing yet intoxicating warmth, while heightening the effect and flavours 

of the coffee. The heady intensity of the aromatic alcohol and steaming coffee 

enhances the coffee-drinking experience. At the ITC, we have introduced a wide 

selection of spirit-based coffees across all outlets of the chain.

The combinations of coffee and spirits are limitless, 

based upon your particular taste in both. Among the most popular spirits that 

can be combined with coffee are rum and whisky, followed by liqueurs such as brandy 

and Cognac. Apart from these, one can go for more exotic liqueurs like Amaretto, 

Creme de Cacao, Anisette and coffee-based liqueurs such as Kahlua and Tia Maria 

(which will obviously give you a double dose when combined with coffee), or the 

orange-flavoured Cointreau. Fortified coffees are usually after-dinner drinks. 

Here goes recipes of some of the drinks from our selection. 

The methods for all of them are the same, one has to build up the coffee, layering 

the ingredients in order.

 Women cops yes, but not decoys

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Policewomen are refusing to play the role of decoys to trap molesters.

 They have played decoy for years, in order to catch a molester red-handed. But now, a majority of the women?s squad of city police is refusing to carry out the orders.

 The explanation the policewomen offer is that they are from good families and have a basic education. So, they cannot be expected to play honeytrap on city streets any longer.

 The policewomen?s refusal has put the city police administration in a fix. After their success during Durga puja, it was decided that women would be posted at different points to trap molesters during Diwali.

 During Puja days, over 40 molesters were arrested, most of whom fell into the trap laid by the policewomen.

 ?We are trying to make them understand that we work for Calcuttans and providing them with a trouble-free festival is our first priority,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Elaborating on why they are raising objections, a woman police of constable rank (the post from which the decoys are mainly recruited) said: ?Before joining the service, we did not know we would find ourselves reduced to this. In accordance with our superiors? instructions, we have to take up position on roads pretending to be streetwalkers. The dark places where we are asked to stand are notorious red-light areas.?

 Echoing the sentiments, another policewoman, who was not ready to be named, said: ?You have no idea what situations we have to face. Though our male colleagues in plainclothes keep a close watch on us and intervene whenever a molester passes lewd remarks, it is a very uncomfortable situation. The foul language we hear, the kind of men we have to confront, are unthinkable. Sometimes, they come close and grab us before our male colleagues come and arrest them.?

 The hostile policewomen feel there are many other ways of trapping a molester. 

 ?We have explained to our superiors and placed the reasons of our objection before them. We have clearly stated that presenting the people of Calcutta with a peaceful festive season is also our prime duty. But no woman can support the way we are being used,? said another member of the detective department?s women?s grievance cell.

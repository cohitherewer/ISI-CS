 Rumours sparked a rampage in a south Calcutta school on Friday, leaving classrooms vandalised and students and staff members wounded.

 Class X students of Gandhi Colony Bharati Balika Vidyalaya, on Bagha Jatin Road, off Netajinagar, hit the warpath when word spread that some of them would not be able to appear for Madhyamik 2006.

 ?They panicked over the unfounded reports, ransacked classrooms and attacked staff members. A number of them sustained injuries and a few fell unconscious. They had to be hospitalised for treatment,? said an officer from Jadavpur police station.

 The school had recently admitted to Class X 42 girls who had dropped out from various other schools. 

 The headmistress had acquired permission from the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education to allow them to sit for Madhyamik.

 At around 12.30 pm on Friday, a wave of panic hit students when they heard that the ?last date for permissions? was Friday and that the 42 new students would not be able to sit for the exams.

 As around 150 girls gathered, some broke down while others raised the battle cry. 

 Targeting classrooms, the girls pulled down curtains and smashed benches.

 As scuffles broke out, nearly 45 girls were taken ill or injured and had to be rushed to the nearby Bijoygarh General Hospital. All of them were discharged by evening. When parents heard of the news, they, too, gathered outside the school and raised a racket.

 Headmistress Kanak Pal, who was not in school when trouble broke out, alleged that the incident was the outcome of a conspiracy by a section of teachers. ?I had submitted all the papers for permission to the Board authorities on Thursday, the scheduled date. There is no reason why they (the 42 new students) would be denied permission to sit for the exams, though the process will take some time,? said Pal.

 She blamed some teachers more than the students. ?They were set up by a section of teachers who told them they would not be allowed to sit for the exams,? she claimed, adding that resentment had been brewing among these teachers ever since she took over as headmistress in March and went about ?revamping the system?.

 Teachers, however, insisted that the girls had heard from sources that they would be denied permission and when the headmistress did not turn up, they panicked.

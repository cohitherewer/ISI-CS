The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Jig to Jakarta, zip into Bali

 - Indonesia eases out tangles, visa on arrival at airport for Indian tourist

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Trips to Bali or Jakarta have been freed of visa tangles. Come August 1, a visitor from any part of the country will be given a visa on arrival at Jakarta airport.

 The Indonesian government had long been toying with the idea of boosting tourism, which had witnessed a brief slump after the December 26 tsunami and earthquake. The steady flow of tourists from India, even after that fateful day, had steeled the government?s resolve to formalise the decision.

 ?From August 1, any Indian travelling to Indonesia will get a 30-day tourist visa on arrival at Jakarta airport. This will definitely help improve the ties between the two countries,? an Indonesian embassy spokesman said over the phone from Mumbai.

 With around 200 Calcuttans visiting Indonesia every year, the announcement has enthused the city?s travel fraternity no end. ?It?s fantastic news not just for those planning to go there, but also for us, who faced a harrowing time getting the visa papers done,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI).

 The papers are supposed to take three working days to be processed in Delhi. But as Calcutta does not have an Indonesian visa office, a traveller from the city had to wait for seven to 10 days after routing the papers to Delhi or Mumbai. On some occasions, Calcuttans even had to travel to Mumbai or Delhi for visa interviews.

 The travel agents have decided to approach airlines for an attractive package for Indonesia, similar to the ones available for other locales in southeast Asia. At present, Thai Airways, Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines have flights between Jakarta and Calcutta.

 Kumar Mitra, manager of R.J. Tradewings, has started getting ?very encouraging? feedback from his clients. ?We believe the tourism industry will get a huge boost with this visa relaxation,? said Mitra.

 ?We had always planned to go to Bali. With the visa rules being relaxed, I have decided to go for a weekend holiday with my wife and children,? said Jaydip Ganguly, a city-based businessman.

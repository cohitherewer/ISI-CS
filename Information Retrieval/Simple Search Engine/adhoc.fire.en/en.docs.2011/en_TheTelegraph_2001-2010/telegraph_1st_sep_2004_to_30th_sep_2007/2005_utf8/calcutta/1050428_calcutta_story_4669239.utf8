 Residents of Ghosh Bagan Lane, near the Tallah pumping station, vented their ire over the slow pace of slum development work in the locality by assaulting a civic supervisor and three contractors on Wednesday morning. 

 The injured were rescued by the police and admitted to a local hospital.

 The residents are disappointed with the development project, launched more than a year ago under the aegis of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Under the project, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is supposed to construct 540 toilets and develop the sewerage system of the locality.

 But the residents alleged that precious little had been done over the past year. ?So far, they have completed only around 340 toilets. Whenever we raise our voice against the slow pace of work, we are told that we do not have the right to ask questions,? complained Bhulu Debnath, a resident.

 One of his neighbours alleged that the building material used in the toilets was of ?extremely poor quality?. 

 ?Right from the cement to the iron girders, everything they are using is sub-standard. We have drawn local councillor Suman Singh?s attention to the matter, but nothing has happened.?

 On Wednesday, the residents lost their cool when the supervisor, Dilip Gupta, visited the area. ?How long will you take to complete the task?? a resident asked him. 

 As an altercation ensued, a mob gathered on the spot and assaulted Gupta. The crowd then moved over to the construction site and beat up the contractors.

 ?They assaulted me even after I told them that I have done nothing wrong,? Gupta later said.

 Tarak Dhar, another resident of the area, alleged that a few persons engaged by the councillor had been collecting money from the residents for the project. ?We met ADB representatives and they told us that we are not supposed to pay anything,? said another resident.

 Councillor Singh, however, denied the charges. ?The ADB has never objected to the quality of work. The residents, too, have not informed me of anything,? Singh claimed.

The entire batch of 247 graduating is yet to be placed, but the trends from the placement starting points, referred to as Slot Zero and Slot One, suggest that big bucks and great opportunities are chasing budding managers from Joka like never before.

 According to data released by the cell, 15 companies, as compared to six in 2004, were present at Slot Zero and made 51 offers, of which 42 were accepted.

 The other stand-out feature of Placements 2005 is the entry of private equity firms, which pick up stakes in start-ups and fledgling companies and become strategic partners. ?IIMC has always been a happy hunting ground for investment banking companies and consultancy firms. Now, we have these private equity firms recruiting exclusively from Joka, which is a healthy trend,? he added.

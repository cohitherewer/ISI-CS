 Monitor method in trade madness

 - Players 

rule out transparency, merchant bodies eye effective regulation

 It reaches over 1.8 million city homes, generates a monthly revenue of around Rs 30 crore (modest estimate) and creates employment ? direct and indirect ? for 30,000 people in the city. Realising its potential, the biggest corporation of India Inc is weaving its future plans around the cable and satellite television industry.

 The numbers are right and the prospects bright, but there is something terribly wrong with the structure of the industry, or rather the lack of it. ?The cable TV business is more than 10 years old, but it still remains a most opaque industry. Conducting clean and transparent business in this industry is impossible,? says a major player now at the exit door.

 While other industries (the cellular phone phenomenon came to India at the same time as cable TV was reaching urban households) have matured over the same period and fostered competition, the cable and satellite television industry has remained stuck in its state of infancy.

 From arbitrary pricing of products (monthly cable bill ranging from Rs 80 to Rs 350) to absence of delivery of services (channels going on and off air at regular intervals), the consumer is clearly at the receiving end.

 ?Unlike most commodities, this sector does not have a standardised market retail price (MRP),? points out a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) spokesperson.

 Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, Indian Chamber of Commerce, picks the monopolistic situation at the retail level as one of the major problems of the sector. ?If one has to suggest a strategy to remove all these distortions, setting up a regulatory body is the obvious solution. This will not only bring in transparency in prices, but will also ensure better service for customers and technology upgrade for the industry as a whole,? feels Arif. 

 The supply side ? broadcaster, multi-system operator and, finally, the cable operator ? has its own problems, with under-declaration at the centre of a continuous tug-of-war among the three stakeholders. The CII suggests conditional access system (CAS) as a way out: ?If effective regulation is put in place, CAS could resolve issues of both supply and demand.?

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has made a feeble attempt to instil some method to the madness, but except for a temporary ceiling on the monthly cable bill, nothing has changed at the ground level. And there is no real reason for things to change. ?The margins are very high for the operators and they don?t have any incentive to change the existing system, unless forced to do so,? sums up an industry insider.

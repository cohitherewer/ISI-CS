The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The great Bengali dream

 ANJAN DUTT is set to chase just that, in Calcutta and in Houston, for his next film. The director and his core team take Pratim D. Gupta through the whys and whats

 Riya and Raima Sen will come together in (below) Anjan Dutt?s new film

 Not titled, nor banking on any namesake. Yet, it can turn out to be the first crossover film from this part of the world. Film-maker Anjan Dutt has taken it upon himself to launch Brand Bangla in the West (and also on the national platform) through the medium of cinema.

 ?Why can only Punjabis and Gujaratis make crossover cinema,? asks an animated Anjan, referring to the Monsoon Weddings and Bend It Like Beckhams. ?We have to admit that we Bengalis are stuck and it?s high time we came out of this. We can?t just keep hanging on to Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray. They are greats, but they are not the last people from here. We have to go out there and express ourselves.?

 And that?s what Anjan?s new film wants to do. Produced by Joy B. Ganguly under his Moxie India banner, the untitled venture in English examines the Bengali and his Bengaliness. ?It was, in fact, Joy?s idea and I just loved it the moment he narrated it to me,? reveals Anjan. ?Having lived in the US, he?s seen how a Bengali community lives there and how attitudes change with every generation. So we have spun a script around that and tried to look at the two worlds ? here and there.? 

 Come January 26 (Republic Day is a co-incidence, they insist) and Anjan will start shooting the Calcutta leg of the film before flying off to Houston for the US schedule. Says producer Joy: ?Since it involves a whole lot of characters ? 300 was the last count ? we are collaborating with the members of the North American Bengali Conference (NABC) in Houston. A lot of them will not only be part of the cast but will also help out in production work. In fact, after the post-production in April and May 2006, we are planning to have the film?s premiere at the annual NABC get-together in end-June-early-July next year.?

 What?s more, Anjan plans to get American film school students and graduates to work on the film, once he goes to Houston in November for a recce. Says the film?s executive producer Arindam Sil: ?The logistics are such that we have to use maximum hands there in the US. We are even getting the main cast to not just stay in front of the camera but to help out with the production. It?s going to be a big family trying to create something beautiful.?

 And the main cast? The Sen sisters, Riya and Raima, will be working together for the first time but, hang on, they don?t even have a single scene together.

 But couldn?t Anjan do a Bhansali and make Paro and Chandramukhi face off on the dance floor or something? ?The two characters are in two locations altogether and there?s no way they could appear in a scene together,? explains the director. ?But there is a lovely twist, which will bind the two throughout the film. To be very honest, only after casting them individually and separately, did it dawn upon me that they haven?t been in a film together.?

 Mumbai-based Shayan Munshi and Tollywood regular Parambrata Chatterjee have been pencilled for the two male leads in the film. ?Both of them look the characters more than anything else,? says Anjan. ?We are having a short workshop in early January with the main cast members and hopefully, by the end of it, they will be really living their characters.?

 Workshop apart, Riya and Shayan are going to be trained by a call centre executive to get their accents, of Bengalis staying in the US, right. Like all Anjan Dutt productions, the film will be laced with a whole lot of music, to be composed by son Neel. ?The script has a scope for a lot of different kinds of music ? baul, jazz, disco? I am even planning to have the popular Bengali bands to sing in my film. Apart from the IT sector, if there?s one set of Bengalis really doing something out of the box, it?s definitely the bands.?

 And will Anjan himself have a Hitchcockian appearance? Arindam insists that the director will walk past in some frame, but it?s a clear no-no from Anjan ? ?I have such great friends like Dhritiman (Chatterjee) and Victor (Banerjee) around. Why do I need to appear??

 Maybe to express yourself, sir!

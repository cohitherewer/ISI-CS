 Pro vice-chancellor, academic, Calcutta University

 There is some justification in restricting the entry of outsiders into campuses of colleges and universities. Recent incidents have shown that people from outside are generally to blame for untoward incidents in educational institutions. But it is doubtful whether a ban on outsiders would improve the law-and-order situation radically. Moral and social degradation, triggered by globalisation, has been reflected in the breach of campus decorum. A nosedive in the value systems of the students is also to blame. Having said that, some sort of regulation is definitely needed. Like in universities abroad, there should be no-go zones on the campus that can be accessed only after a security check. Part-time research scholars who visit the campuses need to be issued identity cards.

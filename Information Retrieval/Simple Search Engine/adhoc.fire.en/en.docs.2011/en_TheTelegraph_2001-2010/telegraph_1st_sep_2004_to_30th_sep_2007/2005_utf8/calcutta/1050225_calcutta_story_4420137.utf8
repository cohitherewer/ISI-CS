 Riya Sen: Oscar flavour

 Our girl at the Oscars ? that?s what Riya Sen will be this weekend. The 24-year-old granddaughter of Suchitra Sen and younger daughter of Moon Moon Sen will be leaving town for Los Angeles early on Friday, with a hectic 72 hours up ahead.

 But Riya isn?t complaining. ?It?s all so sudden and unexpected,? she smiles. ?Whilst on holiday in the US last year, I met the creator of The Margarita King, Giovanni, who insisted I work with him on a prestigious ad film. I, of course, didn?t think twice and did it for the fun of it.?

 With The Margarita King being one of the official drink sponsors for the Oscars, Riya has been roped in as brand ambassador and touted as the ?beautiful Indian princess? coming to attend the Oscars.

 ?More than my acting background, they seem to be rather taken in by the fact that I come from a royal family (father Bharat Dev Varma carries the blue blood of Tripura, Baroda and Cooch Behar). Everybody abroad still pictures India as an exotic place with lots of royalty,? says Riya.

 For her surprise stint in the Hollywood Boulevard spotlight, Riya?s wardrobe focus will be ethnic.

 And the big night at the Kodak Theatre on February 27 will find the star of such films as Jhankar Beats and Style in a Tarun Tahiliani lime green sari.

 The specially-created sequinned embroidered backless blouse with metallic straps ?is a prized piece in itself?, insists Riya, who now lives in Mumbai and holidays at home in Calcutta. ?Tarun?s sister Tina has even taught me a style of draping it,? she reveals.

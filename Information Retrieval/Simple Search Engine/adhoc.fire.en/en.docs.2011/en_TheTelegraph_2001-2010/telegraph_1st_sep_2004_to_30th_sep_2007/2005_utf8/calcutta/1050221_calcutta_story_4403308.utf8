 About 30,000 sq ft of space with 6,000 sq ft of playground area, subject choices like journalism, French, drama and music, separate rooms for co-curricular activities, 20 students to a class, gym, age-oriented libraries? Welcome to The Cambridge School.

 Affiliated to Cambridge University, UK, the school started off in 2003 with Classes IX and XI. Last year, it added Classes VIII, X and XII. From June 13, it will add nursery to Class VII, and admissions kick off from February 21. 

 With a 50 per cent rejection rate on applications just for the higher classes (the school receives ?10 to 15? admission applications per day), the demand can only get higher, feels founder, administrative director and economics teacher of the school Sarojesh Mukerjee.

 ?We deliberately chose a UK system, because we didn?t want students to be restricted to the Indian boards of education. They are very restrictive and regurgitative,? says Mukerjee. ?Also, there is a need for a school like this in a city the size of Calcutta, particularly for the children of NRIs, who don?t fit into the system here when they come from abroad.?

 The school isn?t the only one to offer O and A levels in Calcutta, but it is the first one to be affiliated to an international university. There are 170 students in the school from all around the world (the maximum capacity) with the limit rising to 500 in June. 

 There are 25 teachers, some with online training in the Cambridge system. The syllabus is updated every year, and all other activities apart from academics are not extracurricular, but co-curricular. There are also special tutorials for students who need it, ?to avoid the tuition racket?, says Mukerjee.

 Nonda Chatterjee, former principal of Calcutta International School (CIS) and now principal of The Cambridge School, feels that awareness, and, hence, the demand for the British system is on the rise in Calcutta, spurring parents towards such schools. ?Earlier, there was only CIS. Now, there are others.?

 The first batch of students who will be passing out from the school this year have already received offers from universities in Georgia and Boston, and London School of Economics. ?Uday Agarwal, a student of our school, was the highest scorer in SAT in India,? adds Mukerjee.

 The 10,000-sq-ft building that houses the school now, on Satyendranath Majumdar Sarani, near the Ashutosh Mukherjee Road-Hazra Road crossing, belongs to the Mukerjee family and is on rent to the school. To accommodate the additional classes, the adjoining building, measuring 20,000 ft with 6,000 sq ft of play area, has also been rented out to the school by the Mukerjees.

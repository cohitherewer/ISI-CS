The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Laugh out loud

 Navjyot Sidhu, Perizaad Kolah and Shekhar Suman in The Great Indian Laughter Challenge

 Give your vocal chords some rest. Kick off those dancing shoes. It?s time to laugh your way to stardom. The Great Indian Laughter Challenge, the new talent hunt on STAR One, is all about the search for fresh comic talent to help churn out television software aplenty.

 ?We have an 11 pm show every night called The Great Indian Comedy Show,? says Ravi Menon, head of programming of STAR One. ?We suddenly realised that apart from the likes of Javed Jaffery, Sajid Khan and Shekhar Suman we were struggling to find comic talent for our daily programme. So the show resulted from our actual need. We, of course, made sure that this process of scouting talent and creating a bank of comedians was made hugely entertaining.?

 So the phone lines were thrown open for all those who wanted to make people laugh. More than 200,000 calls came in, from Bengal to Bareilly, Kerala to Kolapur. And 50 were shortlisted to flaunt their funny bone in front of the two judges, Shekhar Suman and Navjyot Singh Sidhu, with the pretty Perizaad Kolah as the host.

 While Sidhuisms on the show will be as regular as Sourav?s low scores, the spotlight will be on raw talent during the hour-long programme. The Sherryspeak for The Great Indian Laughter Challenge: ?Comedy kuyein ki tarah hai ? har kuyein ka pani ka swad alag hota hai.?

 But the star attraction of the show will be the funniest of them all, Johnny Lever, who will walk in as a guest in one of the final episodes.

 ?Stand-up comedy has never been encouraged here in India before,? Lever tells Metro. ?In the US, stand-up comedy is a rage. It is so different from film comedy, from the comedy that happens in front of the camera. It?s really encouraging that something like this is happening on Indian television.?

 For Lever, the key lies in observation. ?To be a good stand-up comedian, you have to watch others very closely, their actions, their body language,? he says. ?Comedy can happen out of mimicry, out of different languages, even out of sound effects. But the toughest thing is to be original. You have to start creating funny items after you have finished copying other comedians.?

 For the winner of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge, to be called Laughter King, STAR One is planning a separate comedy show. ?I think more than monetary prizes, this kind of exposure for someone from, say, a small town is much more worthwhile. Not only the winner, we are also planning to use the final 10 contestants in our shows,? says Menon.

 The small-screen laugh riot premieres on Friday on STAR One at 10 pm. Keep laughing.

 Animal effect on career course

Feng Shui

Pinky Kapoor

 In Feng Shui, the tortoise is believed to bring 

in great career-related opportunities

Q: My son (DOB 3.8.?74) has done 

his M. Com and worked with two organisations in three years. However, for the 

last couple of years he has been looking for a job but to no effect. A picture 

of a white horse with a red border hangs on the southern wall of his room. I am 

an ailing retired man. Please suggest remedies.

Sumit Ganguly 

The Solution: According to your son?s pillars 

of destiny, he is a strong fire person and the horse is a direct symbol of fire 

energy that?s disturbing him. To improve his job prospects, surround him with 

earth, water and metal colours. You should replace the existing painting with 

one of a tortoise on a white background with a black border and a gold frame. 

Hang this on the northern wall. In Feng Shui, tortoise is believed to bring in 

great career-related opportunities. Keep plenty of green bamboo plants in the 

east of your house or the living room. They help to absorb the negativity connected 

with health problems and revitalise the atmosphere. 

Q: I have acquired three pictures 

recently and will require your advice on where to hang them. In the first there 

are tulips, big trees, a green lawn and a big house. It says, ?what?s mine is 

yours and what?s yours is mine?. The second one features trees, a lawn and a dark-green 

house. It says, ?speak to the earth and it will teach you?. The third has more 

houses with roofs made of grass and says, ?it is easier to pull down than to build?. 

Chandana S.

The Solution: The first painting depicts mutual 

trust between couples and is best suited for the marriage corner of your bedroom, 

as it will give a boost to your marital relations. Earth is the element of receptivity, 

sincerity and yielding. Earth is always a giver and its nature is to remain stable 

in spite of pressures. You can hang this painting in whichever area of your life 

that needs grounding and stability. This could be north for your career and business, 

south-east for wealth and prosperity, east for health, or north-east for mental 

strength and stability. The last painting motivates us to construct and hence 

this is best suited for the north-east corner as this is connected with our knowledge 

and intelligence. 

Q: We have moved into a flat that 

was occupied by someone else earlier. There are storage lofts almost everywhere 

in the house ? above the entrance passageway, above the toilets and the corridors 

that lead to the bedrooms. There are cabinets up to the ceiling that extend to 

the doorway of the bedroom. Is it advisable to have so many lofts? 

Kritika Sharma 

The Solution: Feng Shui doesn?t recommend having 

too many lofts in a house as they tend to store inessential things. Lofts are 

connected with the future and hence obstruct growth. You must do away with the 

loft that starts from above the entrance passageway. It is not advisable to enter 

the house with so much pressure overhead. Also knock down the lofts that lead 

to the bedrooms. The cabinets should be used to store light items like linen and 

quilts.

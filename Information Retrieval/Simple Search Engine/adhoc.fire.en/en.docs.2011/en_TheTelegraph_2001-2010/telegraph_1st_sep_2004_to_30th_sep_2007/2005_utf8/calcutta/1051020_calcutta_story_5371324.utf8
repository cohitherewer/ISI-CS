 A show of restored paintings, prints and photographs, all dating from the early 1900s, opened on Wednesday at the Calcutta Club. Seeing the collection, one wouldn?t guess that the 14 oil paintings had, only a few months ago, been almost unrecognisable behind layers of dark varnish. 

 The torn canvas and disfiguring past attempts at repainting and restoration have all been made less visible. The 80 rare lithographs and black-and-white photographs have, likewise, been saved from insect attacks, the effects of age, fungus and acid in the paper.

 Calcutta seems to have woken up at last to the fact that with a little more effort, the past can be preserved for posterity. The current show is part of a project undertaken by the Indian Council of Conservation Institutes (ICCI), Lucknow, to preserve the ?Material Heritage of Bengal.? 

 The ICCI, a division of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, (INTACH), has simultaneously launched a new conservation centre (its 10th all over India) at 240 B, AJC Bose Road.

 ?Most of the Calcutta Club collection was restored on the premises in a special laboratory we had set up. It was during the one-and-a-half years which the project took that we realised the need for establishing an art conservation centre in Calcutta,? said G.M. Kapur, convener of the new INTACH Calcutta centre.

 Already, various private collectors, hotels and galleries have sought out the centre. Works of various artists crowd the modest workshop. Here a Jamini Roy, there a portrait of Tagore?, all awaiting resurrection. The centre is planning a more elaborate arrangement to store works.

 ?We have had very few offers from institutions, though. We are the ones making proposals. Like last week, we learnt that the high court has a good collection of paintings and other historic documents. We are going to draw up a plan to restore them and hope for approval,? said O.P. Agrawal, synonymous with restoration projects here and abroad. 

 Starting with the Archaeological Society of India, Agrawal has headed the restoration section of the National Museum and was the founder of ICCI, the first Indian centre for research in restoration techniques in 1985. ?At ICCI, one has the funds and facilities for different kinds of solutions to restoration problems,? said Agrawal.

 Awareness about restoration is increasing, said Agrawal, and the team of restorers in India is growing in number and expertise. But the museums and other institutions, in whose care the historical and artistic treasures rest, are yet to wake up.

 ?Our museums must pay more attention to restoration and storage facilities, especially since less than 20 per cent of the collection is displayed. There are museums where the objects don?t even get an annual dusting. The reason, I feel, is that no curator or director is held accountable for the loss of paintings through negligence in restoration or storage or even for not generating enough funds for the same,? said Agrawal.

 ?Ten years ago, we had approached Visva-Bharati, offering to restore the frescoes by Nandalal Bose and other paintings. The then vice-chancellor had shown some interest but with his exit, everyone seems to have forgotten that,? rued Agrawal.

 ?Rabindra Bharati University, which has such a wonderful collection of paintings, is equally indifferent. We had approached Pratap Chandra Chunder with a proposal, but he said that nothing could be done because of an ongoing litigation,? said Agrawal.

 The Calcutta centre is following up a ?labour of love? ? restoring sculptures and paintings in St Paul?s Cathedral. A statue of Jesus has some fingers missing and the bust of Bishop Heber needs a cleaning.

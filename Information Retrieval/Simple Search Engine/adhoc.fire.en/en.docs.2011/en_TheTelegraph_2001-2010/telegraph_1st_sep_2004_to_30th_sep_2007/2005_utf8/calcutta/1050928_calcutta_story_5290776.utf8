 The more restrictions are imposed on the pujas, the more will artistes like us be deprived. Take the bar on height of the idol that was imposed a few years ago. Reduction in height meant a reduction in the price of the idol. A 14-foot idol with good worksmanship can fetch us Rs 70,000 while the same quality of craft at 10 feet will not cost more than Rs 50,000. After this year?s new regulations, if organisers cannot put up enough stalls their budget will be reduced. Also if the pandal becomes smaller, the idol too will have to be reduced proportionately. We are losing out on both counts. Common people accept the inconveniences happily for these few days. The tradition of Puja is beyond restrictions but the glamour will definitely be dented.

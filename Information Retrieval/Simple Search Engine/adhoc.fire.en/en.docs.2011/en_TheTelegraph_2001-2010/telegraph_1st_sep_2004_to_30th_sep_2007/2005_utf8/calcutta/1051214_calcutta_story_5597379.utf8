 Price on Buddha head

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The CBI on Tuesday announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for anyone providing specific information about the Buddha bust stolen from the Indian Museum on December 29, 2004.

 The CBI?s economic offence wing in New Delhi notified the reward in the papers with an assurance that the identity of the informant would be kept a secret.

 ?We had informed the Interpol about the missing Buddha head dating back to the Gupta era but they are yet to provide us any leads. The award is aimed at eliciting a response from those who might have some information but are afraid of sharing it,? sleuths said.

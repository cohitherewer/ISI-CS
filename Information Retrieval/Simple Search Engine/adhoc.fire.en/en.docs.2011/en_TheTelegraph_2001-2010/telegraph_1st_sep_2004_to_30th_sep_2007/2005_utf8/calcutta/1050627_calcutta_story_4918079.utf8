 Cyber laws in the pipeline

 S. Halder: Cyber crimes are steadily on the rise in our country. Do Indian advocates have adequate exposure to this new type of crime?

 Cyber crime is an emerging area. Recently, police have started a wing to tackle it, but such crimes are still treated under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code. A set of new laws are under consideration. Once they are enacted, advocates can familiarise themselves with them. Unless there are proper laws and the process of tracking cyber crime is in place, it won?t be possible to tackle it.

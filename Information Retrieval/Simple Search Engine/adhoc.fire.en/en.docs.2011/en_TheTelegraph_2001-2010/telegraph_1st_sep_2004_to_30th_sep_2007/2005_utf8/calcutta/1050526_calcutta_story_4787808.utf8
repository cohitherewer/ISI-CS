 Virtual wow

 Gorillaz: Demon days ahead

 What?s different about the band 

 the Gorillaz? The members ? guitarist Noodle, vocalist 2-D, 

 bassist Murdoc Nicalls and drummer Russel Hobbs ? do not 

 exist in real life! But that didn?t stop the virtual band?s 

 debut album in 2001 from selling over six million copies. 

 Now, they are set to release the follow-up, Demon Days, and fans have the chance to get their artwork featured on the album. Channel V?s Draw The Gorillaz contest, starting May 23, lets anyone post a creation of the Gorillaz in action. It could be Gorillaz playing cricket, or protesting against a loony politician. Contributors can log on to vindia.com and send in the entries. A lucky winner?s drawing will be featured on the new album. 

 The Gorillaz was conceived as 

 the first ?virtual hip-hop group? by Blur?s Damon Albarn 

 and comic creator Jamie Hewlett. Demon Days is a 

 darker and more intense affair than 2001?s Gorillaz and 

 features collaborations by Neneh Cherry, MF Doom, Ike Turner, 

 the London Community Gospel and more. 

 Rituparna: Victory 

 sign 

 Shadow lines

 If everything works out fine, 

 this summer will see Jeet and Rituparna Sengupta pairing 

 up for the second time after Ashok Dhanuka?s moderately 

 successful Aakrosh early last year. Chhayapath 

 is the story of a Muslim girl and a Hindu boy fighting 

 social bias for a life together. 

 ?Rituparna plays the Muslim girl who is sold off by her uncle and aunt to a gang of goons. Then, the hero rescues her from the mafia and love blossoms between the two. But the hero hails from a Brahmin family and after some initial resistance, his parents accept the girl,? says director Bidesh Sarkar.

 ?Jeet is supposed to play the leading man but his dates are yet to be finalised,? adds Sarkar, the maker of Shakti, Jiban Trishna and Parichay.

 Also starring in Chhayapath 

 are Soumitra Chatterjee, Ranjit Mullick, Sabyasachi 

 Chakraborty, Anuradha Roy and Labony Sarkar. While Soumitra 

 plays the hero?s father, Sabyasachi is a corrupt ex-armyman. 

 Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet and Asha Bhonsle will do the playback. 

 Jadoo: The comeback

 Mini magic

 Jadoo is coming back to television 

 this summer. Season II of J Bole toh Jadoo is on 

 air with all new episodes at noon every Sunday on Nick. 

 The alien of Koi? Mil Gaya fame who debuted on the 

 small screen on Children?s Day had 6,60,000 kids tuning 

 in since then, out of which 40,000-plus kids responded to 

 Jadoo?s appeal for help in the 15th and final episode of 

 J Bole Toh Jadoo Season I by participating in the 

 ?I want to be with Jadoo? contest, promoted on Nick and 

 sister channel MTV. 

 One winner will get a chance to star with Jadoo in multiple episodes to be aired on Nick in mid-June. Speaking on Season II, Pradeep Hejmadi, director, business and operations, Nick India, said: ?The plan was always to bring back Jadoo on Nick... In Season II, look out for even more amazing animation, action, music, humour and fascinating characters.?

 In the new series, Nick has focused on localised content and situations, based on well-known mythological stories. Also entwined in the plot will be subtle social messages. 

 Said Hejmadi: ?For kids, the best 

 learning comes through subtle but effective messaging from 

 role models. Jadoo is just that and he?s entertaining too.?

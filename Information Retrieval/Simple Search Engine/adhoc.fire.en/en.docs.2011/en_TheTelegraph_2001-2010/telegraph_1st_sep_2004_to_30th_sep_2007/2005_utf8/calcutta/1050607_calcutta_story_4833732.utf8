 Impressions of life

 Art has the instinctive virtue of reaching out to our hearts, of arousing our dormant emotions and passions, to enable us experience to the fullest the simple joys of everyday life. The ongoing exhibition of the recent works of the members of The Frame attempts to portray the private worlds as inhabited by the artists, offering an insight into their inspirations and aspirations, and their pursuit of happiness in an imperfect, insensitive world. Bhaskar Bhattacharjee interweaves geometrical shapes and surrealistic forms in his paintings, achieving a unity of design that mirrors his interest in combining the mythological with the modern. Influenced by ancient art, Debasish Samanta paints incidents from daily life with raw vigour and sharp attention to detail, forging a natural bond between primitive and contemporary art. Imposing in structure, Kumud Ranjan Halder?s paintings evoke parallels and contrasts between dreams and reality in urban life. The canvases of Prangopal Ghosh (Landscape, picture above) are spontaneous vehicles of self-expression, enriched by a lyrical symbolism that imparts to his art a universal dimension. Other participating artists are Sandhyakar Kayal, Soumitra Kar and Susanta Mondal.

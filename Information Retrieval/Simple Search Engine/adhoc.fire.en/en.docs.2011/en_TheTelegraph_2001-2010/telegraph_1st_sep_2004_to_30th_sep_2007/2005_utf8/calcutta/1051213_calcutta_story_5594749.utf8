The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Movie Meter 

 Ek Ajnabee 

 A desi take-off on the Denzel Washington-Dakota Fanning-starrer Man on Fire, this Apoorva Lakhia film is about an ex-armyman Suryaveer Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) who takes up the job of a child?s (Baby Rucha) bodyguard in Bangkok at the instance of friend Shekhar (Arjun Rampal).

 The original ?angry young man?, Amitabh Bachchan returns to action as the no-nonsense man-on-a-mission. When he is not going bang-bang at the baddies, he is metamorphosing from ?just a bodyguard? to ?Surya Bear?, the loveable father figure to the 10-year-old Anamika. At 64, having films conceived for and written around him, the Big B is single-handedly rewriting the Bollywood script. 

 The support cast is refreshingly good ? Arjun as the friend-turned-foe, Rucha as the adorable friend-seeker, Perizaad Zorabian as the devastated mother and Vikram Chatwal as the fallen father.

 A far cry from his debut debacle Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost, this is stylish with a capital S, from using the physicality of Amitabh to Bangkok as a character.

 Loopholes in the basic plot (why, pray, would Arjun need a ?kathputli??) and the excessive violence of the saloon sequence.

 In the name of being slick and technically sound, it loses out on emotions and doesn?t have the much-needed relief pauses punctuating the action sequences.

 First weekend watch: 88 % at INOX (Forum), 82% at INOX (City Centre), 82 % at 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi)

 Last word: The best way to wish the man a speedy recovery is to catch him where he belongs ? on the big screen, and walking tall with bullets aplenty in his body

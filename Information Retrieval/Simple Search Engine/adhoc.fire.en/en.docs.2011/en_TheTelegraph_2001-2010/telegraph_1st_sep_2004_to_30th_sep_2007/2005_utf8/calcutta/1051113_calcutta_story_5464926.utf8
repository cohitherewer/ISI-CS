The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Good cure, bad comfort

Doctors must realise that the patient experience is 

a package of medical advice and medical service

Shiloo Chattoapadhyay

A 

friend had just moved into Calcutta. As luck would have it, within a few months 

of his stay here, he developed an ailment that required surgical attention. He 

called me for help and I took him to a surgeon I knew. This was a handsome man 

who emitted unmistakable signs of modernity, intelligence and a huge amount of 

professional confidence. He took only a few minutes to grasp the findings of all 

the clinical tests that were already done. After necessary examination, the conclusion 

was confirmed, a surgery was imperative.

My friend had a nervous query: ?Do I have a non-surgical 

choice?? Our doc replied: ?Sure. Grin and bear the pain.? I was glad that we came 

to him. Sense of humour is a rare trait in the medical profession.

A few days later, I took my friend to one of those 

private nursing homes that dot the bylanes of Calcutta. Our very impressive doctor 

had recommended this one. He usually does his surgeries here. After filling up 

the admission form, the man at the reception told my friend to go to his appointed 

room. There was a minor problem. The lift was not working. I asked for a stretcher; 

the man at the reception explained that it was too early to get people to carry 

the stretcher. So my friend, who was medically advised not to take too much physical 

strain, had to climb the stairs to reach his fourth-floor room.

The single room was large enough but not clean enough. 

The toilet had been used, the sweeper had not come yet. Later, my friend wearing 

a gown that looked distinctly unclean had to walk to the operating theatre that 

was on another floor. After the operation, a stretcher was organised but adequate 

manpower was still missing. Some of us lent a helping hand. Mercifully, my friend 

did not have to spend too much time in this nursing home.

There is a moral of the story. Service of a surgeon, 

or any doctor for that matter, is bought on the recommendation of other patients 

or fellow medical professionals. This word of mouth is generated from past experience. 

So every patient that a doctor treats becomes an animated advertising. This much 

is well known and acknowledged. A doctor obviously does his best to ensure that 

the word of mouth he gets is positive. After all, the most crucial aspect of a 

patient?s experience is medical ? was he cured well enough?

There, however, is the other part that is gaining 

in importance. A doctor?s service is increasingly becoming a package, a bundle 

that includes medical advice as well as medical service. The service is usually 

outsourced by the doctor from a pathological laboratory or a nursing home. The 

patient experience of the ailment includes these, along with his interaction with 

the doctor.

True, the quality of the doctor remains the main driver 

of image. No patient in his senses will prefer a bad doctor just because of a 

good nursing home. The danger is that the realisation is dawning that goodness 

of a doctor is not an adequate insurance against infection of surgical wounds 

or aggravation of an ailment due to lack of attention.

My friend is hale and hearty. He swears by the surgeon 

but would advise anyone who would care to ask to avoid the particular nursing 

home. A doctor cannot ensure the timely attendance of a sweeper in a nursing home 

he recommended. Yet he may pay for it in image terms. There lies the danger. And 

the danger is not purely commercial. Even morally, a doctor surely would rather 

be known as a healer and not an abettor of ailments.

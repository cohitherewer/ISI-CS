 Mumbai cops seek Ansari crime details

 KINSUK BASU

 During the few weeks that he had a cellphone to himself in his cell at Presidency jail, Aftab Ansari used it extensively to call up his contacts and threaten traders, even in faraway Mumbai.

 Officers from the detective department of city police stumbled upon this ?operation? only recently, when the Mumbai crime branch sought details about Ansari and his present status in connection with a case of extortion and criminal conspiracy. 

 The case (reference number 97) dates back to 2004, when Ansari was lodged at Presidency jail.

 In a letter to the city police, deputy commissioner (CID), Mumbai, Dhananjay Kamalakar, has asked his counterpart in Calcutta to furnish details of the cases against Ansari soon.

 While the letter does not state the reason for this urgency, officers claim the point is not hard to miss ? take Ansari on transit remand to Mumbai.

 Admitting that the letter has been received, city detective chief Gyanwant Singh said he had asked the officers concerned to furnish the details. ?They have sought certain details and we will furnish them,? Singh said. 

 If the letter is any indicator, Ansari and several others had conspired to kidnap a trader and extort money from him.

 ?Going by the specific sections under the Indian Penal Code, it appears Ansari has been tagged in a case of kidnapping for ransom (364 A of the IPC) with a few others who had conspired together with a common intention of committing crime,? said an officer of the detective department.

 The criminal investigation department of the state police has gathered evidence that even a few months ago, Ansari had used a mobile phone inside his cell to ask associates to call up city-based realtors for money.

 Officers of the detective department also feel the plea from the Mumbai crime branch, close on the heels of Ansari?s conviction in the American Center attack case, has been timed just right.

 About six months ago, Ansari had filed a petition in Calcutta High Court seeking permission to move to Delhi to face a trial. A division bench disposed of the petition, observing that he could move only after the completion of the American Center attack trial.

 ?Evidently, the Mumbai crime branch was aware of this and was waiting for the trial to get over,?an officer of the law department said.

 ?Now, the branch can make a formal application to the high court here and place an appeal to take him to Mumbai,? he added.

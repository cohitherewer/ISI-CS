 Special compliments that make you feel all the more special. Thats the crux of cosmetic label Ponds Googly Woogly Contest that kicked off across all major cities in India on October 25.

 As part of this national contest, women above the age of 18 were asked to write in the best compliment they had ever received about their beautiful skin in a bid to be crowned Ponds Googly Woogly Princess. The 15 regional winners will now vie for the finals to be held in Delhi or Mumbai in January.

 The city chapter of this national contest came to Calcutta on Wednesday afternoon. And to crown the princess of the city was Ponds Miss India Universe 2005 Amrita Thapar, who visited the residence of winner Priyanka Roy Choudhury, at 66, Ballygunge Gardens.

 For Priyanka, who entered the contest just by chance, it was like a dream come true. This is simply unbelievable. I had gone to a shopping mall where the forms for this contest were being given out. It was my mother who insisted that I go for it... The compliment that always mattered the most was that of my mothers who appreciated my cute features and smile, she gushed, receiving the gold crown along with a hamper of Ponds skincare products from Amrita.

 The beauty queen, looking pretty in a pink sari, congratulated Priyanka and said: I am really happy to be in Calcutta. I spent quite a few of my growing-up years in Siliguri. And I can even read and write Bengali. The women of Calcutta are very pretty, with good features and great skin.

 Visual abstractions

 A marked predilection for the abstract world defines the art of Nabanita Banerjee. Fresh, mural-like and monumental, her paintings give the impression of a powerful cosmic design within which man is entrapped unbeknownst to himself. The ongoing exhibition of her paintings, mainly done in acrylic on canvas, is a testimony of her maturity as an artist, firmly moored to her own artistic beliefs. Constantly experimenting within the bounds of her own creative domain, she nevertheless manages to communicate with the common man, interspersing identifiable motifs and symbols in the body of her abstract configurations. Ostensibly painting tangled images of nature, Banerjee?s keen, sophisticated artistic perception lifts her works from the realm of non-figurative abstractions to a space where it is possible to discern a unified meaning and purpose in them.

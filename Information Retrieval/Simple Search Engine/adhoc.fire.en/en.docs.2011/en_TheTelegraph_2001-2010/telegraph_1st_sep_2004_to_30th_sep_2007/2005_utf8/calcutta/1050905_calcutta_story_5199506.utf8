 Mom, game amp; child 

 The new STAR Plus game show Mum Tum Aur 

Hum, and (below) host Shruti Seth 

 It won?t leave you richer by Rs 2 crore but it?s one show that can certainly bring you closer to your child. And for once, kids don?t have to be subjected to the ?18 years or above? tag. STAR Plus?s new game show, Mum Tum Aur Hum, to beam every Monday to Thursday at 8 pm from September 18, fuses fun and family.

 Created by Siddhartha Basu and his team at Synergy Communications, ?the action-packed game show tests the understanding between a mother and her child?. And for a change, it?s not a licensed version of an international show but an original creation. 

 ?We at Synergy came up with the concept after we discovered (through research) that there was a viewership interest in the mother and child as a unit rather than as individuals in different shows,? says Anita Kaul Basu, Siddhartha?s wife and one of the producers of the show. ?So taking off from there we created a gaming area and came up with this show which brings about a new sense of bonding between the mother and the child.?

 Through three rounds, the mother and child have to ?think together, play together and should be in sync with each other?. While Round One is called the communication round, Round Two is the buzzer round, and Round Three the jackpot round. All the games are fought against the clock, ?in the midst of action and distraction?. 

 The game show will be hosted by the pretty Shruti Seth, known for her veejaying stint on [V] and the fun TV serial Shararat, which has already made her quite a popular face with kids. 

 The set for Mum Tum Aur Hum, created in Delhi, is like a house in itself having everything from a bedroom to a drawing room to a study to even a garden. ?It?s not a house, house as such but there?s that house effect,? says Anita. ?The rooms are used to play the communication round trying to get as close as possible to a real setting.?

 Anita and her people at Synergy are well aware that it is the toughest to shoot with animals and children. ?Yes, it?s challenging,? she says having already shot for a few episodes of the game show. ?Dealing with adults is very easy compared to kids. But at the same time they are much less guarded. So the naughtiness, the innocence come through and it makes for great television.?

 Mum Tum Aur Hum has prizes in store for every stage of the show and the jackpot is an all-expenses paid trip for four to exotic destinations like Maldives, Mauritius, Sydney, New Zealand and Dubai for four nights and five days. 

 ?After KBC 2, prize money has indeed become an important factor for game shows. But at the same time money is not the motivating factor for all game shows. What?s more important for a show like this is the experience of being part of a process so creative and dynamic. And that makes mothers very open to their kids participating in a show like this,? Anita signs off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

A scandal rocks the circuit yet again even as your 

cup brimmeth with cheer over the success of Indian sport. The weekend banter couldn?t 

get chirpier!

Shooting stars

 Bollywood stars descending on the cityscape is no 

longer new to Calcutta. Yet, a multi-starrer being shot on familiar ground always 

makes for a great talking topic. The latest film shooting in the news is Aparna 

Sen?s 15, Park Avenue. Sen has turned a pretty Salt Lake house into the 

New York address. What the curious passersby throwing just a cursory glance at 

the cars and crew van are unaware of is the bevy of celebs huddled inside. Quite 

a pack there is too, from ?mother? Waheeda Rehman to ?daughters? Shabana Azmi 

and Konkona Sen Sharma, Abhijaan co-actor Soumitra Chatterjee, and Aparna 

herself. 

Privacy vs paparazzi

Suddenly the lip-crossed couple Kareena and Shahid 

seems to be in the clear. It took a court ruling in London to clear the privacy 

issue, at least for the moment, by passing a judgment in favour of Mick Jagger?s 

daughter Elizabeth and her boyfriend. Though the duo was captured on a closed-circuit 

camera in a nightclub, engaged in ?sexual activities?, and the ruling prohibits 

the distribution of the footage, it doesn?t mean you can?t indulge in a little 

good-natured back-biting on the scandals doing the rounds in your circuit!

 Cricket craze

There?s nothing like an India-Pakistan face-off to 

catapult cricket on top of the sporting spirit of the country. Even if you aren?t 

quite a Test cricket addict, Calcuttans have special reason to cheer when Team 

India travels to the city. With Sehwag in slam-bang mood and Sachin falling just 

short of his record-breaking century at Mohali, all eyes will be on the Eden. 

One pair of eyes that could make a huge difference ? to the temperature and the 

traffic ? is that belonging to the Pakistan Prez. With Musharraf and Maharaj, 

Sachin and Sami, be prepared for an all-action week ahead.

 Still on sports

The Indian sporting arena has never been more colourful. 

If the cricket green isn?t your favourite colour, turn to the asphalt of Formula 

One and keep your eyes trained on Narain Karthikeyan, of course. With the boy 

from Coimbatore successfully completing his debut race in Melbourne last week, 

he shares mind and media space with the queen bee of Indian sport, Sania Mirza, 

as its crown prince!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Central experts to vet zoo milieu

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 It?s time for Calcutta Zoological Gardens to either abide by the directives of the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) or face the music.

 Two specialists have been empanelled by the CZA for a visit to the Alipore zoo to evaluate whether its directives are being followed, after years of reminders.

 During the visit, the experts will also evaluate the possibility of setting up the proposed alternative zoo off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 S.K. Patnaik, retired additional principal chief conservator of forests under the Orissa government and a former director of Nandan Kanan zoo, and A.T. Rao, retired professor, Orissa Veterinary College, are on the panel.

 ?A former zoo director and a veterinarian, who is an expert in zoo medicine, form the expert team,? explained Bipul Chakrabarty, scientific officer of CZA, from New Delhi. 

 The CZA has asked the experts to complete the evaluation process by March.

 In 2003, recognition had been granted to Alipore zoo on the condition that it adheres to the CZA?s recommendations.

 The recognition helps the zoo to get funds from the CZA for various projects and facilitates exchange of animals with other zoos across the country and abroad.

 One of the main conditions set by the CZA is appointment of a full-time curator for the zoo. ?We haven?t received any response in the matter,? Chakrabarty said.

 He added that the Alipore zoo did not have a master plan, management plan or animal collection plan.

 ?For 10 years, the CZA has been asking the Alipore zoo to take necessary measures. This time, it wants to be firm,? an official of the body said.

 Among other things, the CZA wants the number of eateries in the zoo to be reduced to improve hygiene.

 CZA scientific officer Chakrabarty said: ?We have been told verbally that the state government is planning to set up an alternative zoo on a plot off the Bypass. The entire arrangement will be examined ? whether only some animals will be shifted from Alipore and if the present area will be used simply as a bird park,? he elaborated.

 Director of Alipore zoo Subir Chowdhury refused to comment on whether the CZA conditions had been fulfilled.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trains held back for the delayed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With commuters forced to cross Howrah bridge on foot or scramble on to overcrowded ferries, the railway station was the scene of chaos for much of Friday afternoon.

 Traffic jams and diversions only made matters worse, and many frantic travellers arriving late were out of luck.

 But six long-distance trains were delayed marginally keeping in mind the crisis beyond the platform.

 Three Eastern Railways trains were held back. The 2301 Howrah-Delhi Rajdhani via Gaya, scheduled to leave Howrah at 4.15 pm, left the station 20 minutes late. The delay helped 23 passengers running late to catch the train.

 The 5959 Kamrup Express also left 10 minutes after the scheduled departure time of 5.35 pm, while Coalfield Express left the station 15 minutes behind schedule.

 In the South Eastern Railways sector, Purulia Express, Steel Express and Sri Jagannath Express were all held up by 25 to 30 minutes.

 ?We were informed about the unusual situation that must have delayed many. We also gathered from the low occupation numbers that many passengers had failed to reach the station on time,? said Virendra Prasad, senior station manager, Howrah station.

 ?In case of local trains, many passengers might have failed to catch their usual train, but they would always be able to catch the next train coming in. Passengers on the long-distance trains would have suffered,? added Prasad.

 Many travellers had to trek across the bridge with their luggage in tow. Like Dibyendu Roychoudhury, on his way back home to Asansol with two big pieces of luggage.

 ?When I reached the area, the traffic was not moving, and I got off the taxi and started walking across the bridge,? he explained. His two-year-old niece was frightened to tears by the agitated rush of people around her.

 A group of students returning home to Chandernagore was running far behind schedule.

 ?Thanks to queues at the ferry ticket counter as well as the rain, we spent well over an hour going from Babughat to Howrah, which usually takes no more than 20 minutes,? complained Kaushik Mukherjee.

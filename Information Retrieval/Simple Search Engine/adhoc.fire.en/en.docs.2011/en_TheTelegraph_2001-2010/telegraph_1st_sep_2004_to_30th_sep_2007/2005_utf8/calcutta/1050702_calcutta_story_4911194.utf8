 Bricks that build character

Eye on Calcutta 

 Renu Roy

 What makes our city stand out? Perhaps the architecture of its heritage buildings. So join the preservation fight

 Whenever i discuss our city with foreigners, especially from the West, we invariably land up talking about, or listening to something which is referred to as ?character?.

 However forcefully I may have argued in favour of Calcutta?s characteristic, I have often later wondered what it really is. Few of my friends have been able to put their finger on it, and fewer foreigners, including Geoffrey Morehouse, have been able to explain where it really resides, even though they may have described it wonderfully well. 

 So, what is character? It seems to be something whose presence we immediately recognise, or whose absence we certainly acknowledge when we travel to other cities both within the country and beyond. It even goes to the extent of observing that Delhi has character, while New Delhi does not. 

 Rephrasing the problem, I have tried to consider what is it in a city that gives it character? What is it that we recognise in Rome and not in Milan, in Florence and not in Turin? in London and not in Coventry, in New York and not in Toronto? Since I have only been a passing visitor to these cities, and since goggle-eyed tourists are not perceptive travellers, I thought that perhaps a closer consideration of the city I know best might just provide the answer. And the answer did come in a flash as I was walking through a narrow north Calcutta lane towards the grand building of one of my aristocratic friends. 

 It is architecture that gives a large measure of character to a city, largely because they tell stories and over time they develop a persona. They have a distinct narrative that Tagore brought out so brilliantly in his short story, The Hungry Stones. Calcutta has a lot of hungry stones, and those are the ones we have just begun to recognise as heritage buildings. 

 The news that one of our leading corporate houses would provide significant funding for the restoration of an old mansion in Dalhousie Square (a name that seems more appropriate in the context than the characterless BBD Bagh) was a comforting reminder that people around me were becoming increasingly conscious of the need to protect history and nurture heritage. We have often been accused of being a people with a long and fascinating history, but unfortunately, with little respect towards it.

 I shall not go into a tiring list of the number of our heritage buildings, their antiquity and their claims to fame. There have been a few surprises for me when I set about to discover the narratives behind some of them. But before that, I decided to take a close look at what constitutes a heritage building. Did you know that a Municipal Act established only in 1980 has fathered this concept? According to the letter of the law, a heritage building is one whose ?preservation and conservation is done for historical, architectural, environmental or ecological purpose?. 

 There is also a legal description of something called a Heritage Precinct, which refers to the immediate environs of the particular building. The ambience has been defined as the quantitative and qualitative aspects attached to the heritage building necessary for its appreciation.

 Victoria Memorial, Writers? Buildings, Town Hall, National Library and Governor House join famous residences like that of the Tagores, Rammohun Roy and Chittaranjan Das as landmarks that we all know. Yet perhaps, we do not even flash a glimpse at them as we whiz past. But if you do, and you ponder for a moment, can you even imagine an Esplanade without Governer House, or a riverside without the high court and the Town Hall? You certainly could, but it would not be the same city. Accusations of nostalgia, and living in the past notwithstanding, a large proportion of the city?s character does accumulate from these unique specimens of fine colonial architecture.

 But it is the lesser-known heritage buildings that seem to contribute more in terms of character in the unobtrusive and quiet manner in which they continue to influence the ambience of our city. Next time you are in those parts of the city, I invite you to take a pause in your busy day and look at the Bethune School across the Hedua, or the Observatory at Alipore, or the Brahmo Balika Bidyalaya at Garpar. I assure you that you will be enriched in a magical moment that puts you in touch with your own history. Its forgotten corners will touch you vigorously, with nostalgia, and a sense of pride and belonging. The innocuous footpath on Bowbazar Street outside the Indian Association Hall will come alive with the fiery rhetoric of Surendranath Banerjee, and the early architects of Indian freedom. Traffic in the heart of the commercial district may stall for a moment when you pay homage to the tomb of Job Charnock.

 This is not about nostalgia but about action, especially for those who do own heritage buildings, and may even be unable to look after them in the manner in which history deserves. There are others who care, but who may not be able to show that they do till you ask for help. Ours is a special city, where absolute strangers have been known to jump into a battle that you thought was only your concern.

 So do take a few moments off to visit the Greek Orthodox Church in Kalighat, and the splendid Synagogue on Ezra Street, and one will realise the dimensions of our heritage, and the vast frontiers of experience that this city still holds for us. 

 When you are walking down SN Banerjee Road next time, think about the Bourne amp; Shepherd Building, which not only is part of history, but also contains history in the priceless glass negatives of old photographs that it still houses. Or walk further down the same road and look at the house of the mother of this city ? Rani Rashmoni ? that now plays hosts to the spice merchants of Jaanbazar. Take a pause outside the Jorabagan Police Station and look up at the architecture. Don?t just dine at the Grand Hotel; remember to give it a small share of the precious attention it richly deserves. Don?t stop at seeing a film at Rupabani, but acknowledge its importance. I assure you that you will come away feeling much bigger, as part of a greatness that is not lost, but is just waiting patiently for you to re-discover it. 

 Commercial Calcutta has a lot to do to remind people of the heritage which they stand for. Did you know that Mackinnon amp; Mackenzie Building, Gillander House and Kanak Buildings are part of your heritage? That the GPO is originally Fort William? There are others hidden from the public eye, still private property. Yet as history, they are all in the public domain, like the Freemason?s Hall on Park Street, or the Rajbaris in Sovabazar and Jorasanko. There may be many other Hungry Stones waiting for your attention and concern!

 Or will you cry out like Meher Ali in the Tagore story ? Tafaat jaao, sab jhoot hai! Sab jhoot hai!

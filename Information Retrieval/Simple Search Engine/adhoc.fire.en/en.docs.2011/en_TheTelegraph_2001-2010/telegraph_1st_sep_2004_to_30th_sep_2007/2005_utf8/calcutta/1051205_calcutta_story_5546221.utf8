Move over tattoos and body painting, its time 

to go desi with bindi art, points out Anumita Ghosh

From inspiring lyricists to compose classic melodies 

like Teri bindiya re and Bindiya chamkegi, to flagging of innovations 

in K-serials (the Ramola Sikand of Kaahin Kissii Roz kinds), bindis are 

much more than just a beauty accessory.

And what was once a red dot on a womans forehead 

symbolising shakti, has undergone several innovations through the decades. 

The latest experiment ? an entry into the world of body art.

Yes, move over tattoos and body painting, for, bindi 

body art is the new thing on the beauty block.

Bindi body art is essentially a temporary form. From 

contemporary motifs that are in to the more traditional designs, you can 

fashion bindis in numerous styles and patterns.

Stones, sequins, beads, glitters and spiral golden 

wires are the ingredients that make up these elaborate bindis. For a compact effect, 

the bindis are pasted on a semi-hard transparent plastic base.

When I started dabbling in bindis, the idea 

was to make them more than plain velvet ones in ordinary shapes. Then as body 

art came in, bindis took a whole new dimension. Today, body art bindis are fast 

catching on, says Jasmine Chanchani, who has been specialising in this form 

of art for almost 15 years now. 

Jasmine, who retails from her residence at 2/A, Ronaldshay 

Road in Alipore, also uses onyx, pearls, garnets, rubies and emeralds for the 

bindis that are further decorated with gold-plated silver.

The bindi tattoos can be pasted with a special gum 

that is available at most cosmetic stores. These can be reused a few times if 

you handle them well and preserve them carefully.

Bridal beauty

For most Bengali brides, the wedding makeover is quite 

incomplete without the artistic sandalwood paste pattern on the forehead. 

Jasmine recommends replacing this traditional make-up 

with a splash of bindis on the forehead.

For this, a longish or even broad circular ornate 

bindi is placed between the brows. Then, following the shape of the brows a line 

of pretty decorative bindis are placed in close succession. 

While the simple ones are in one single line, the 

more elaborate ones have additions like dew-shaped or pyramid-shaped bindis strung 

alternately.

While deciding on your bridal bindi pattern, there 

are certain essentials that you need to keep in mind. 

Those with a broad forehead can go for elaborate 

designs, complete with a neat bindi maangtika. However, if you have a thin 

forehead it is always advisable to go for sleeker designs, says Jasmine. 

The other obvious thing to watch out for is the colour 

co-ordination with your bridal attire. The stones or sequins used in the 

bindi should preferably follow the same colour story as the outfit, points 

out Jasmine. 

While solid hues of pink, red, orange and yellow rule 

the wedding evening, for the reception you can always go for sober shades like 

peach and cream.

Apart from the forehead, the other zone the bindis 

can adorn on D-day is your upper arm. If you are wearing a short-sleeved 

blouse, then a stick-on bindi tattoo can be used to form a baajubandh, 

says Jasmine. 

This can be done with a nice compilation of bindis 

in an inverted pyramid shape in the middle, while a few lines of sequins can be 

used to cover the whole width of the arm.

Its almost a must for the bride to flaunt real 

ornaments on her big day, but her friends can always opt for bindi jewellery. 

Add funk to your traditional garb by replacing those regular neckpieces or nosepins 

with bindi ones. In detailing and finish, they are no less than your chokers and 

chains.

The baajubandh and neckpieces are easy 

to handle. The other advantage is you can always have a greater variety and mix 

and match them according to your outfit or the occasion, says Jasmine.

Party point

Party dressing is no longer just about minis and cocktail 

dresses. Be it sensual crepes and chiffons, or ethnic straight skirts, the desi 

look is back with a bang. 

If you are in a sari, team it with a noodle strap, 

backless choli or halter-neck.Complete the sensuous look with a striking 

bindi tattoo just below your shoulders. 

For parties, simple and smart is the mantra. 

Colours like turquoise, purple and pale pink win maximum votes, claims Jasmine.

Butterflies, geometric patterns and abstract designs 

are the hit motifs for party bindi tattoos. 

If you are daring enough and have a body to show off, 

a bindi tattoo near the navel can be a very hot style statement.

Wear a simple, short top with your skirt or denim, 

make the belly button bindi design the focal point and watch em gape.

 Axe that tree, grab the turf

 A drive down VIP Road to enjoy the lush greenery may soon be a thing of the past, as illegal settlers continue felling trees to make way for their dwellings.

 Not till long ago, more than 1,500 full-grown trees lined the four-km stretch between Ultadanga and Baguiati, which belongs to the public works department (PWD).

 About two years ago, encroachers started trickling in and started felling trees indiscriminately to make space for their shanties. Over time, entire colonies have come up along VIP Road, in Kestopur, Dum Dum Park, near the Lake Town footbridge and at Golaghata.

 Illegal settlement is highest in Kestopur and near the Lake Town footbridge. Trees on Bangur Avenue have been the latest casualties in the land-grab spree.

 As of now, the count of full-grown trees along the stretch has come down to some 1,000. Residents of the area fear these, too, will come under the axe if the practice is not stopped soon.

 Surprisingly, the authorities concerned don?t seem to have the slightest inkling about how to tackle the situation. ?This is a non-forest land, belonging to the PWD. So, it is PWD?s responsibility to maintain these trees. We have no authority to look into the matter,? said A.K. Chakrabarty, divisional forest officer (DFO), North 24-Parganas.

 Conceding that his department had received complaints of tree-felling, PWD minister Amar Choudhury said: ?We don?t have the necessary manpower to tackle the situation. We are looking into the problem.?

 Fearing police action, the settlers are now resorting to sly tactics to clear the land of trees. ?Now, the people are following a more vicious method. They are killing the trees by spraying poison (DDT or insecticide) on the roots. Once the tree is dead, they are cutting it. To cover up the misdeed, they are uprooting the trunks completely, not even leaving behind the stump,? said an officer of Lake Town police station. 

 ?Whenever we receive a complaint of tree-felling, we rush to the spot. But we fail to make arrests for lack of specific charges. The settlers return to finish the job when our officers are not at the site,? he added.

 ?We have to fell these trees for our shanties and for cooking fuel. Police often harass us over this issue. So, we are being forced to use chemicals and dump garbage to kill the trees before cutting them,? admitted Raju Das, a resident of Kestopur colony.

 ?Neither the forest department nor is any other agency paying much attention to the rampant tree-felling. We are helplessly watching the greenery vanish,? rued Ashish Chakrabarty, a resident of Kestopur.

 Shankar Ghosh 70

 A leader in the field of percussion ensembles, Shankar Ghosh has set the rhythm for every classical great of the country, including world-renowned music geniuses like Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan. With a rare ability to visualise future trends way ahead of time, his compositions are distinguished by vibrant, dynamic, sonorous beats, gaining him immense popularity among music lovers of all generations. Ghosh also founded a unique all-drum orchestra, for which he composed melodies by tuning drums at different pitches. Among his most memorable performances are the closing act of the New Delhi Asian Games and his recital at the centenary celebrations of the BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in London. As the living legend steps into his 70th year, Remac, McDowell?s, Patton, Tata Steel, Gallery Royal, Open Doors and Cocoon host A Maestro Turns 70, a programme which, besides paying tribute to his musical talents, also celebrates his birth anniversary. On the occasion, Sa-Re-Ga-Ma will release a four-CD biography pack of his work.

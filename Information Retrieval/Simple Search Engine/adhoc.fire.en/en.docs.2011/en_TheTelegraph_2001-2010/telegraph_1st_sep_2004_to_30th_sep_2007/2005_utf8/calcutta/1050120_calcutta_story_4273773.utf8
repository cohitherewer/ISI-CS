The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Talk of clearing air

 JAYANTA BASU

 A change of mindset, effective legislation and a switch to LPG were some of the ideas mooted for cleaner air

 Suggestions never stopped flowing ? on how to check auto emission in the city ? but there was no one from the government or the police to weigh their implications.

 The occasion was a panel discussion, Meeting Auto Emission Norms ? Emerging Issues amp; Challenges Before the State, organised jointly by The Telegraph and Millennium Institute of Energy amp; Environment Management (MIEEM) on Wednesday.

 It was attended by, among others, automobile expert S.M. Ghosh, environment activist Subhas Dutta, state pollution control board?s P.K. Roy and representatives from Indian Oil and Hindustan Motors. 

 The transport department, public vehicles directorate and police chose to abstain.

 The suggestions that filtered out of the brainstorming session include a change in the mindset, proper legislation and converting autorickshaws to cleaner fuel.

 Asked why Indian Oil has opened only five liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) dispensing stations after promising around 70 a year ago, deputy general manager Indrajit Bose said: ?Auto LPG doesn?t have much demand in the city.? 

 After spending about Rs 45 lakh to set up an LPG station, at least 80 per cent of the fuel remains unsold, Bose added. ?The only way to improve the situation and give a momentum to the clean-fuel drive is bringing about legislation.? 

 He assured the gathering that once the government took the initiative, oil companies would come up with at least 25 LPG stations in the city ?within short notice?.

 Dipak Munshi, chief general manager of Hindustan Motors, admitted the need for such legislation, but refused to take responsibility for the cars, even the new ones, that fail pollution tests. ?Once a car is registered, there cannot be any emission warranty,? argued Munshi.

 He was countered by automobile expert S.M. Ghosh, who stated that the auto-fuel policy called for ?legislation regarding emission warranty and recall system for vehicles with emission-beyond-specified norms?. According to Ghosh, hardly one per cent of the cars in city conformed to the new Central Act.

 Pollution control board?s P.K Roy claimed that 90 per cent of the mechanics running the upgraded auto emission testing centres are incapable of handling the modern equipment.

 Green activist Subhas Dutta stressed the need for a change in the government?s mindset. ?Even the high court has observed that the state government is not doing enough.?

 Dutta?s suggestion: ?To start with, the government should try to implement the existing laws sincerely. It will take care of much of the problem.?

 MIEEM president S.S. Dasgupta said his institute would prepare a white paper on the issue and hand it over to the government. But does the city?s death by poison air really bother the government?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Poll breather for hawkers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eviction of hawkers from pavements will have to wait till the city gets a new mayor.

 The high court has given the state government three months to evict encroachers from pavements. But as the civic polls are scheduled for next month, the Trinamul Congress-BJP board has decided to leave the job to the new regime.

 ?Let the next mayor carry out the court order,? incumbent Subrata Mukherjee said.

 He, however, welcomed the court?s directive. ?Such an order was necessary to save Calcutta from a section of dishonest politicians and police officers, and musclemen.? 

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly last Friday had directed the police to remove hawkers and other encroachers from the footpaths of eight roads in the central business district. 

 The thoroughfares include Strand Road, KK Tagore Street, Chitpore Road, NS Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kalakar Street and AJC Bose Road.

 Civic conservancy officials said the implementation of the court order would call for a drive on the scale of Operation Sunshine, launched on the night of November 24, 1996. The operation focussed on 21 major roads.

 Thanks to bickerings within the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, there has been no second attempt to drive away encroachers from pavements.

 In June 2001, when mayor Mukherjee had planned an eviction between Victoria House and Victoria Memorial, Trinamul leader Madan Mitra had vowed to resist the move if the hawkers were not provided with a suitable rehabilitation package first.

 The net result of the political patronage: a jump in the hawker count from one lakh to around two lakh, since the government decided eight years ago to ban hawking on the 21 roads.

 ?We did not know before launching Sunshine that a large number of influential political leaders received regular payments from hawkers,? a conservancy official said. According to an estimate, an effective ban on hawking would leave the leaders poorer by at least Rs 10 crore annually.

 Each hawker, the official claimed, has to make a daily payment of Re 1 each to three major trade unions ? Citu, UTUC and Hawker Sangram Committee.

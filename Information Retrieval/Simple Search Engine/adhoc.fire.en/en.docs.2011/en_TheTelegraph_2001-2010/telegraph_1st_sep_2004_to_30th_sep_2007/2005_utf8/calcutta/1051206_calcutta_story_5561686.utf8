 A term describing mixtures, combinations and link-ups, Hybrid Forms closely interconnects film, television and digital media to produce documentary films that show ?life as it really is?. In the last two decades, young generation of German filmmakers extensively experimented with hybrid film techniques and forms that deliberately ignored traditional rules and boundaries between genres. Hybrid Forms: New Trends in Documentary Films presents films that reflect such new approaches to documentary filmmaking. To be screened this evening, The Housewife?s Flower (a scene from the film appears above) is a comedy whose style recalls the popular docu-soaps currently running on German television. Scenes condensed and intensified through staged arrangements and dramaturgically skillful montage, along with a total absence of commentary, strengthen the documentary aspect of the film. Consisting of a blend of the fictional and factual approach, it also satisfies needs of authenticity. Direction: Dominik Wessely.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 No billboard in wetlands

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government on Wednesday decided to remove all billboards within the periphery of the East Calcutta Wetlands, including the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, in two months? time. 

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, who also chairs the East Calcutta Wetland Management Authority, said all structures constructed inside the wetlands after 1992 will have to be identified.

 ?The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) commissioner has been asked to compile a list of structures that have come up inside the wetland periphery after the 1994 high court judgment which banned any construction within this area. The list will be ready in a month. The government will then decide on action to be taken against offenders,? said environment secretary Asim Barman on Wednesday evening. 

 About 300 such structures exist, said department officers. As for billboards, the agencies which have put them up will be asked to dismantle them within two months, or else the government will pull them down, said Barman. 

 This was decided at the first meeting of the recently-constituted East Calcutta Wetland Management Authority, chaired by chief secretary Deb at Writers? Buildings. 

 All 15 members of the authority, including secretaries of the environment, forest, land and land reforms, fisheries and panchayat departments, along with the CMC commissioner, were present. 

 ?It was also decided that billboards will be put up in 12 places along the wetlands, including Bantala, declaring the area to be under the East Calcutta Wetlands. The notice will also say that since the area falls within the wetlands, people should not buy property here,? said an environment department official.

 The government will set up four sub-committees to look after the different zones of the wetlands. Forest secretary Ashok Patnaik will chair the committee on bio-diversity conservation.

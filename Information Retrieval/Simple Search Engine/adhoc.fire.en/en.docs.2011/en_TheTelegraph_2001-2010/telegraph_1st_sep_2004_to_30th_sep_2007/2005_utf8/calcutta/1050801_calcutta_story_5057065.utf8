 Durga puja: Business bridge. A Telegraph picture

 Driving eco-tourism in the tea gardens, mentoring small entrepreneurs, creating content for distance education, facilitating easy access to Silicon Valley? And of course, getting drenched in Puja pageantry.

 Happenings, the NGO that, in tandem with West Bengal Tourism, undertook the first orchestrated initiative to wrap-sell the Durga puja overseas two years ago, is keen to carry the story a step forward, by marrying entertainment with business this festive season.

 In this, the third edition of Happenings? Mahotsav, a large section of the 100-plus guests is expected to do some serious handholding to buoy business in Calcutta, while in town for the Pujas. ?We have tied up with The Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE), which will help locals build bridges to further their businesses,? Viji Iyengar of Happenings tells Metro.

 Friends of Bengal, a catalyst body formed at an informal meeting of Happenings officials and NRIs in the US last month, has already mobilised a start-up corpus of $25,000 for a pilot project in Calcutta. 

 While telemedicine, education and tourism have been identified as thrust areas, the sharp focus will be on the small entrepreneur.

 ?There?s so much money around the world to invest, but nobody hears of Calcutta. Networking is the key and that?s what we have set out to do with Happenings, using the Global Services Network platform,? says Alo Ghosh, global charter member of TIE, who has taken over 1,500 Calcuttans to the US through his software firm Techna rooted in Silicon Valley.

 Ghosh, who has been spreading the good word about Calcutta, expects more than 20 arrivals from Silicon Valley for the Happenings Puja push this year. ?They would be relatively wealthy people, most of them successful in some start-up business and looking for investment or networking opportunities here,? he says.

 With the carnival caravan bringing ?focused tourists? to Calcutta, the action group driving the initiative hopes to cash in on the sentiment factor. ?There is so much skill in small businesses here, which needs to be harnessed and projected in the big league. Our endeavour is to bring business acumen to the small sectors and allow as many entrepreneurs as possible in Bengal to plug in and utilise our resource pool,? Ghosh adds.

 Friends of Bengal will also ensure that small and medium business personnel from the state travelling abroad can use the 70-odd offices of TIE worldwide. ?We realised that without a business orientation, the Pujas can?t be propelled too far. At the end of the day, people have to make a living out of it. So Mahotsav isn?t just an NGO model any more, it?s a business model,? stresses Iyengar.

 Happenings is confident education in Bengal can take a big leap through this bridge-building exercise. Digital education for every child and teachers? training institutes will be prioritised, with overseas funds and inputs mobilised for centres of excellence. Paramedical facilities at a low cost through satellite link and eco-tourism in the tea estates (?our tea trade is getting hammered by Sri Lanka?) are also on the agenda.

 TIE is convinced ?IT alone can?t solve all the problems?, and is keen to promote handicrafts, jute, costume jewellery and designers of Bengal as well. ?We will provide them marketing support and tutor them on how to kill distance by selling their wares on the web,? says Ghosh.

 Happenings hopes real stakeholders, like the airlines and hotels, can pick up the Puja branding thread from next year. ?We will be there to provide our expertise free and play the role of a catalyst,? Iyengar signs off.

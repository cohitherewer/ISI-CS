 If you are in trouble on the city streets late at night, there will be cops at hand to bail you out, the chief minister and police commissioner had promised while inaugurating 64 roadside police kiosks at the Lalbazar headquarters.

 A promise fulfilled only partially in the two months that have passed since then. 

 Some of the kiosks are still incomplete and without a power connection. The policemen refuse to sit in the dark kiosks.

 Last month, the kiosks were at the centre of a controversy after Metro exposed how power was being hooked to illuminate them. 

 The police brass had tried to pass the buck to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), saying that the civic body was paying the CESC.

 When contacted, CMC secretary Sajal Bhowmik spelt out: ?Of the 64 kiosks, we had provided power only to the 14 that were inaugurated by the chief minister. The civic body has no idea about the rest of the kiosks.?

 On a visit last week, Metro found that the kiosk at the Khanna crossing on APC Roy Road had not yet been completed ? there was no power connection and the windowpanes had not been installed.

 Another kiosk, near the Central Metro Railway station, was also without power. The policemen on duty were being forced to sit outside.

 One of them said: ?There is no power connection. It would be pitch dark inside, but for the streetlights. It is not possible for us to spend the night sitting inside? it is better to sit on the pavement.?

 Yet another kiosk without power is in the Gouribari area. The structure is also incomplete. No policemen could be found inside or around it during the visit.

 Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner of police (organisation), refused to accept that the facilities at the kiosks are less than adequate.

 ?There is no problem at any of the kiosks. I have not received any information about the men on duty at the kiosks facing any difficulty. There were some problems earlier regarding power supply, but those have been sorted out with the CMC,? he asserted.

 Cops on kiosk duty have to counter other problems as well. ?Those who look after the kiosk often keep it locked. Hence, we hardly get to sit inside. Sometimes, there are disruptions in power supply from the portable generators,? said an officer of Baguiati police station, deployed at the kiosk near Joramandir, on VIP Road.

 A few kilometres down the road, the kiosk near gate no. 1 of the airport was tapping power illegally from an adjacent lightpost.

 Shyamali Mishra, spokesperson of the private agency that erected the kiosks, stated that there were no infrastructure or power problems at any of the kiosks. 

 ?For more information, get in touch with the joint commissioner (organisation). The police are maintaining the kiosks now,? she said.

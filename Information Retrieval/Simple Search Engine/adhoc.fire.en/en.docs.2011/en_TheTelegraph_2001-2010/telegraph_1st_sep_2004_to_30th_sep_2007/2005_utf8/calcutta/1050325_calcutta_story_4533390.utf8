 For your hair only

 Veena Ben Shroff returns to city of her birth to celebrate her 80th birthday in style. And she brings with her a unique collection of hair ornaments, photographs and other hair accoutrements (numbering over 700 pieces) for city connoisseurs. A pioneer hair stylist and an avid collector of traditional hair ornaments, Shroff developed an early interest in traditional hairstyles as depicted in ancient sculptures and paintings. Visits to temples, museums and libraries have been her life-long pilgrimage. During her travels, she collected rare and unique hair ornaments from every part the country. She has a wonderful collection along with photographs depicting the hair ornaments, their use and her styles, copied from the sculptures. The elaborate hair styles of erstwhile Bollywood film stars, Sandhya in Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje, Vyjayanthimala in Amrapali and, much later, in Mira Nair?s Kamasutra, are all her creations. Her hair pieces have been an integral part of fashion shows by top-notch desigers, including Rohit Bal and Ashish Soni. The grand old lady continues her quest for the best and shares her artistic passion with like-minded Calucttans. Hosted by Crafts Council of West Bengal.

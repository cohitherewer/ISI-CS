The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campus call, near amp; far

 Students turn target clients as they 

 open up to off-beat courses away from home

 Michael Dias saw an advertisement 

 in the paper announcing the arrival of Air Hostess Academy 

 in Calcutta. At The Telegraph Careergraph Live Career 

 Fair last month, he signed up for a course in aviation and 

 hospitality management. The former student of St Thomas 

 Boys School is planning to tackle the year-long course along 

 with a BA correspondence degree from Indira Gandhi National 

 Open University and a part-time job. 

 Michael has company while choosing 

 a career path off the beaten track. The road less travelled 

 is now crowded with his peer group making the transition 

 from school to college. 

 And dearth of choice is not a 

 problem plaguing students when it comes to courses and campuses. 

 Not when their range of options includes medical degrees 

 in Russia or China, management or IT diplomas in Canada 

 or Singapore. Not with US and UK universities starting up 

 campuses in Mumbai and Calcutta and vocational courses like 

 jewellery designing and animation being available in the 

 city itself. Then there are traditional favourites like 

 English, law or economics, at a JU or a Xaviers, in Oxford 

 or Cambridge.

 An explosion of new courses and 

 institutes in the city, around the country and abroad adds 

 up to a win-win situation for students ? provided they know 

 what they are going in for, how and why.

 Making the right choice is not 

 as easy as it sounds, with the biggest hurdle being the 

 lack of guidance and qualified counsellors, resulting in 

 confusion, say those in the know. ?Students should avoid 

 getting swayed by the glitz and glamour and stick to the 

 facts,? feels Snigdha Gohain, a Calcutta-based career counsellor.

 Holistic help is often at hand 

 at the admission and career fairs galore trundling through 

 town, peddling education dreams and promising practical 

 means to make them come true.

 ?Education is big business,? says 

 Sanjeev Bolia, CEO, Afairs, organiser of the Admissions 

 Fair, being held at the Ice Skating Rink till June 20. Bolia 

 has been organising education fairs for the past 14 years. 

 The Admission Fair is the second one for Afairs this year, 

 with the Career Fair held in May and the promise of ?several 

 more? in the coming months.

 ?A big chunk of outstation students, 

 particularly in south India, is from Bengal. So the number 

 of institutions participating in the fair has gone up substantially. 

 Last year, there were about 20 from Karnataka; this time 

 there are 40,? adds Bolia.

 The four-day Career Fair had a 

 footfall of 15,000, and a similar figure is expected for 

 this one, with spot admissions to institutes home and abroad 

 being the star attraction.

 Blairland vs Bushworld

 Everyone?s jumping on to the book 

 bandwagon to cash in on the growing student segment on the 

 move. So, foreign institutions offer scholarships and participate 

 in education fairs, banks offer loans, a Singapore Airlines 

 slashes fares and an American Express promotes travellers? 

 cheques just for them.

 But where do they ? the students 

 ? prefer to go off to these days?

 ?The number of those going to 

 the UK has increased phenomenally in recent years,? says 

 Debanjan Chakrabarti of British Council, Calcutta. ?One 

 of the main reasons is financial help. Banks offer loans, 

 of course, but there is also the fact that a lot more British 

 institutions are offering scholarships for undergraduate 

 study. The relaxation of work-while-you-study rules in the 

 UK is another factor.?

 High-profile places like London 

 University, Oxford and Cambridge remain most popular, but 

 newer institutions like Leeds Metropolitan, Reading and 

 Oxford Brookes are also attracting students, who, according 

 to Chakrabarti, are ?more canny and aware now?. Around 16,000 

 UK visas were issued to Indian students in 2004.

 The lure of Blairland is matched 

 only by that of Bushworld, with student traffic to the US 

 on the rise. ?The East and West coasts are still on top 

 of the list, but there is a movement to the southern part 

 of the US, because it?s cheaper,? observes Sunrit Mullick 

 of the United States Educational Foundation in India, Calcutta.

 Coast or course, awareness among 

 a generation in the Net know is essential. ?Students need 

 to be extremely careful about courses abroad and new institutes 

 and private colleges in India,? advises Pervin Malhotra, 

 director of the Delhi-based Caring (Career Guidance India). 

 ?For instance, they should find out if the medical colleges 

 in Russia and China that are so popular are recognised by 

 the WHO. There?s no point wasting years of your life on 

 a vanilla degree that?s not recognised in India.?

 Fancy brochures do not reflect 

 the quality of a college, she warns. A safeguard is to check 

 the global and national rankings of foreign institutions. 

 Education consultants taking hefty fees and not delivering, 

 and the quality of teaching on Indian campuses of foreign 

 institutions not being up to par are some other pitfalls 

 students need to look out for, Malhotra cautions.

 Most importantly, students need 

 to know their own aptitude, observes Snigdha Gohain. ?There 

 are around 2,000 courses available in India. Which one is 

 good or bad depends on the student?s ability. We can?t all 

 be Kalpana Chawla. But everyone can be good at something, 

 once they figure out their aptitude,? she observes.

 Southward bound

 Harsh Gupta wanted to go to Christ 

 College in Bangalore. But the ex-student of MP Birla School 

 was persuaded to stay back in the city by his father. He 

 made a pact with his parent ? ?I?m going to Bhawanipur College 

 for a B.Com in finance, where attendance is not a must, 

 so I can work in my father?s firm?.

 Six of his friends are headed 

 for the garden city. As are most of Isha Majumdar?s friends. 

 The former student of St John?s Diocesan is staying on in 

 Calcutta. But many of her batchmates are off to Bangalore, 

 followed by Hyderabad and Pune, for degrees ranging from 

 B.Com to law to engineering to hotel management to mass 

 communication.

 Within national boundaries, southern 

 comfort scores the highest. ?Bangalore is the most popular 

 destination for students now, followed by Pune,? says Afairs 

 CEO Bolia. At the ongoing Admissions Fair, of the 110 stalls, 

 there are 40 institutions from Karnataka, 10-15 from Tamil 

 Nadu, 10 from Maharashtra and 10 from the north.

 Another trend this year is the 

 comeback of traditional degrees like economics and law, 

 but in its more ?modern varieties? like cyber and corporate 

 instead of criminal and civil law. But even that is sometimes 

 hard to get, with demand exceeding supply.

 For Saimantika Mitra, the search 

 for a good college to study psychology began well before 

 her HS exams. Her first choice is Mumbai, where she camped 

 for a few weeks, doing the rounds of colleges along with 

 friends. With psychology scarce in top-rung city colleges, 

 Saimantika must move out.

 But she?s determined not to repeat 

 the mistakes of some others. One of her batchmates applied 

 for home science in a south Calcutta institute, where admission 

 is on a first-come-first-served basis. She deposited Rs 

 20,445. If she gets admission elsewhere and leaves, only 

 Rs 5,000 will be refunded.

 Some like Saimantika?s friend 

 are trapped, but many more, armed with awareness, head off 

 near and far to pursue creative passions and commercial 

 careers.

 Fix-it nod for roads in north

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Those happy with the pace of the pre-Puja road repairs have reason to be happier. 

 More roads, especially in north and central Calcutta, are set to be concretised after the festive season. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta announced on Monday that an additional Rs 21 crore would be allotted for concretising some arterial roads in north and central Calcutta after the Pujas. 

 These include the Shyambazar five-point crossing, Bidhan Sarani, College Street, Nirmal Chandra Street and Rabindra Sarani (Chitpur Road).

 ?Tram tracks on these roads will be removed. They will be relaid after the roads are concretised. Work will start in November,? Dasgupta said at Writers? Buildings. 

 Over the past 10 days, the finance minister had been making surprise checks across the city to ensure that pre-Puja road repairs were completed on time. Having allotted Rs 15 crore for ?urgent? repairs, Dasgupta had threatened to withhold payment if the contractors delayed work.

 Expressing satisfaction over the current state of roads, Dasgupta said on Monday: ?Around 90 per cent of the repairs are complete. When I made my last check, at Triangular Park, on Panchami morning, I found the contractors had been working overnight.? 

 Repairs on College Street, Vivekananda Road (near Hedua), Nirmal Chandra Street (near Lohapatty) and Rabindra Sarani have not been completed, the minister added. ?A thorough overhauling of these roads will be undertaken in November. The momentum built over this fortnight should continue.?

 According to Dasgupta, Chitpur will prove problematic, as the level of the bitumen road is much higher than the tram tracks running on it. The bitumen surface will have to be scraped off before concrete is laid. 

 Earlier, the minister had announced the allotment of Rs 42 crore for concretising Lenin Sarani, BB Ganguly Street, MG Road, and the stretch between Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Bidhan Sarani. ?Now, the overall allotment will go up to Rs 63 crore,? he said.

 Observing that there was a great imbalance between road infrastructure in north and south Calcutta, Dasgupta said: ?North and central Calcutta were neglected over the past five years. I am determined to bridge the gap.?

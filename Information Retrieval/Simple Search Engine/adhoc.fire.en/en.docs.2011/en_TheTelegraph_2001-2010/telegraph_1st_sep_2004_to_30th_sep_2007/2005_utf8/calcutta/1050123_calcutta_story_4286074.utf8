 Party Hopping

 Party priority: I am all 

 for private parties, though I do make occasional rounds 

 of the nightclubs around town once in a while. For me, a 

 party must have some trappings. I thoroughly enjoy dos where 

 either the hosts or anyone from among the guests puts up 

 an impromptu musical performance. Things like these always 

 make a party more memorable. Since I have been associated 

 with music all my life, I enjoy parties where music is the 

 focal point.

 Best bash: Rashid Khan?s 

 son?s first birthday party is the best I have attended in 

 a very long time. A performance by singer Talat Aziz left 

 me spellbound. With good friends for company, good food 

 to gorge on and the lovely weather to make things even better, 

 I just felt lost in the beautiful ghazals that he 

 was rendering. I just didn?t want to leave.

 Party priority: For a 

 party to be a hit, you need a great crowd. The guestlist 

 is what makes or breaks a party for me. You can?t expect 

 to have a blast with a bunch of boring people around you. 

 Chilled-out, young-at-heart people are a must to make a 

 party a hit. I guess the crowd is the deciding factor even 

 when people go club-hopping. Food, drinks and music are 

 more or less the same everywhere, but it?s the people hanging 

 around that differentiates a good nightclub from a shady 

 one. 

 Best bash: Just before 

 my wedding in December, I had organised a small house party 

 to have fun with close friends. It wasn?t a bachelor party 

 in the real sense of the term, but it was meant to be a 

 celebration for the great days I?ve enjoyed throughout my 

 bachelorhood. It was a private affair with home-cooked food, 

 good drinks, a lot of old English music and trance and, 

 of course, a lot of laughter and leg-pulling. It was a real 

 relaxant, and was perfectly timed at the beginning of a 

 hectic marriage schedule.

 Sengupta

 Actor

 Party priority: For me, 

 a party is successful only if there are the right kind of 

 people around. Even now, the parties that I enjoy most are 

 the ones where I get to meet old friends. Guitars in hand, 

 we sing along with some old numbers and chat our hearts 

 out. I?ve known them for years and with them I can truly 

 be myself, without having to put up any pretensions. They 

 don?t treat me as a celebrity just because I am a film star. 

 I am perfectly at ease with them and such parties are very 

 relaxing. 

 Best bash: Celebrating 

 the first New Year?s Eve as a married man was obviously 

 fun. On this December 31, Nilanjanaa and I invited some 

 friends over to our new house. My friend Naveen Pai dropped 

 by with his wife Ahalya and there were some stags as well. 

 We wanted to have a house party where we would all cook 

 dinner together. We decided to keep only pasta on the menu. 

 Though we ended up being jammed in the kitchen for most 

 of the evening, we didn?t actually spoil the broth. 

 After a bout of chitter-chatter, 

 with our tummies full, we decided to go for a long drive. 

 While the initial idea was to drop by at a nightclub, the 

 long queues outside were enough to indicate what the insides 

 would be like. 

 So we skipped the idea and drove 

 around the city and its outskirts till dawn and went home 

 after watching sunrise on the Hooghly.

 Designer

 Party priority: The key 

 stimulating factor to enthuse me to go to a party would 

 have to be IQ levels. Interesting intelligent people from 

 different walks of life are always a pleasure to meet, even 

 if it often ends up making me realise how little I know. 

 Best bash: This season 

 I?ve missed almost all the best parties as I?ve either been 

 travelling or have been too exhausted after work. However, 

 one party that I particularly enjoyed was an impromptu session 

 at our place with old school friends who were here visiting 

 with their families over Christmas. Great anecdotes from 

 their current careers, lots of laughter, some gossip, good 

 wine and takeaway biryani from Shiraz (our cook was on leave) 

 resulted in a relaxed evening to be cherished for a long 

 time to come. 

 Raima 

 Sen

 Actress

 Party priority: Great 

 food, music and good wine is bound to make a party a lot 

 of fun, but it?s the people that can really make or break 

 it. Without like-minded people around, you can?t let your 

 hair loose and just be yourself ? and, if you can?t be yourself, 

 no party is fun!

 Best bash: One of the 

 best parties I have been to in recent years was Venky?s 

 New Year?s Eve bash 2003 in Pune. Located on different levels 

 of a hilltop, with the most exotic array of food, free-flowing 

 drinks and great music, the party was bound to be a hit, 

 even before it started.

 What?s more, I was surrounded 

 by my closest friends and family throughout the night and 

 danced to the beats of my kind of music. All in all, I had 

 a complete blast that night and would love to re-live it.

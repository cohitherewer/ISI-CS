The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Message in the medium

A sleeping belief that often wakes up is that all advertising 

is motivated. So, we must be spoon-fed the good news

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

There 

is this new campaign running on television from ICICI Prudential insurance. It 

is not run-of-the-mill advertising. In visual terms it stands out. Its soundtrack 

is even more interesting. Near chipmunk quality of the voice, rhyme in the script, 

and use of Hinglish ? all these together are reminiscent of another automotive 

battery ad. Yet it still feels fresh and makes the listening experience pleasurable. 

The punch line of the ad ?No chinta only money? is likely to become a popular 

mnemonic.

Given what it is trying to sell, the timing of the 

ad is also very apt. The Union budget does make ordinary people put their financial 

antenna up. Will I take home less? Would the new car I intend to buy become costlier? 

Would I be taxed on the summer holiday in Europe? Budget also reminds people that 

a month remains of the current financial year. There is a sense of urgency in 

the air. Management of personal tax, that oft-discussed, seldom-acted topic, can 

no longer be left on the backburner. There can be no better season.

Yet, all these positives of the campaign may, and 

I repeat, may just hide a couple of potentially dangerous issues. In simple English, 

the ad says save tax now and earn pension later. Great, I want to do both. Who 

would not? But then, what is the catch? We are not used to hearing unadulterated 

good news in advertising. Indeed a sleeping belief that wakes up in such situations 

is that all advertising is motivated. After all, the sponsor of the advertising 

is spending lots of money to send the message to me. He would be expecting to 

make a profit. Obviously, that profit has to be at my expense. The million-dollar 

question is whether this ?good medicines are bitter? theory is guilty for raising 

such questions.

Yet, the form used in the advertising does a difficult 

job very well ? it helps the ad to cut through the clutter and makes repeat viewing 

pleasurable. Most importantly the campaign delivers a simple and an unequivocal 

message. Not an easy debate to resolve.

There is this other issue that this ad raises. Granted 

that people today are in general far more investment savvy than before. Equity, 

Sensex, mutual fund, debt fund are far better known terms today than say in the 

Eighties. Still, there exist people who remain distant from the financial world. 

They are not necessarily ill-equipped in terms of numeracy or knowledge. They 

usually have apathy and a resultant mental block. As a natural corollary they 

also usually do not have a broker at hand or a tax consultant on call. To this 

group, this ad may lure but will be unable to break the Newtonian law; everybody 

continues in his state of rest or motion unless. 

The question that begs a debate is whether the current 

campaign should have had an accompaniment. May be another campaign that tells 

you what to do next? May be a direct marketing programme that engineers human 

intervention to break the inertia? After all, the barren land that ?no chinta 

only money? ploughed so well merits to be nourished further.

I was explaining the arguments of this column to an 

ex-banker friend. He pointed out that the current ad does give a phone number 

and an electronic contact for further information and action. I am a certified 

member of the finance-averse community. The fine print did not register. Even 

if it did, I would not have made the move.

I need to be fed with a spoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From Virani to Veer

 Ronit Roy during a visit to Calcutta

 Exit Mihir Virani and Rishabh Bajaj. Welcome Kunal Veer Pratap Singh. After his early blockbuster Jaan Tere Naam, followed by a string of B-grade flops, Ronit Roy had re-discovered himself as an actor in Ektaa Kapoor?s K-sagas, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kasautii Zindagi Kay. Now he may have to quit both the serials for the sake of his new avatar in the just-launched Shobaa De-written saga Sarrkkar ? Rishton Ki Ankahi Kahani.

 While Ronit is not ready to talk about it (?no comments please?) TV town is abuzz with talk of Ektaa gearing up to replace him from the two hit soaps if he doesn?t leave Sarrkkar and give more dates to her productions.

 That?s something Ronit may not be willing to do. ?Sarrkkar is my quest to do something different,? he tells Metro. ?My character of Kunal in the serial graduates beautifully over a period of time. It doesn?t stagnate with regular twists and turns after every 25-30 episodes.?

 The look of his character in the serial, along with those of Divya Seth and Rohit Roy, has led many to believe that Sarrkkar is taken straight out of the lives of the Gandhis. ?I think it?s largely the political background that is making people get that image. Then again, what we do on television and in films is inspired from reality. But if it is actually a docudrama on the lives of the Gandhis, that hasn?t been conveyed to me.?

 Sarrkkar also allowed Ronit to work with his brother Rohit for the first time, who incidentally is playing his screen brother in the serial. ?We have already shot 40-45 episodes and it was great working with Rohit,? recalls Ronit. ?We got to chat a lot during the shooting schedules. What?s most interesting is that both our characters in the serial are very close to our real-life characters.?

 Ronit, who recently appeared in a cameo in Subhash Ghai?s Kisna, is still open to big-screen opportunities. ?I don?t get good film offers because people in the industry believe that I am too busy on television. I want to do quality film roles, not cameos. Kisna I did because Subhashji is like a dad. I would be happy to be associated with him in any possible way, even if it is just one shot.?

 And with the controversy of him being fired from Ektaa?s K-team growing by the day, Ronit just wants to hibernate. ?I have had a jam-packed three years. My wife is pregnant and is in her ninth month. I would now like to learn ? everything from being a better actor to a good dad. The burnout factor is fast approaching me and I really need to take a break. I would hibernate soon unless something really different comes about.?

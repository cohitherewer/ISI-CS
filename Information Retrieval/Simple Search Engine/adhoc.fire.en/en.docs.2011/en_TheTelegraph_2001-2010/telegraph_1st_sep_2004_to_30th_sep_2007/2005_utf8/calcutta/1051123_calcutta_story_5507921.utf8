The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Indrani Halder

 Actress and television anchor

 The rates of multiplexes are so high that they are meant for a particular class. It is true that this class was forced to visit single-screen theatres when the multiplex option was not there. When my film Dahan released, people commented that so many luxury cars had not been seen outside a hall like Bijoli in a long time. This class is preferring the multiplexes now. But otherwise the single-screens have a different audience. Yet in this competitive market, the hall-owners have to refurbish the halls to survive. This has been our demand for long. The seats are broken, the bathrooms stink, the air-conditioner is absent or malfunctioning... why should people come? I am sure that multiplexes will spread to the district towns as well.

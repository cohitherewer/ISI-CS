 Two years after Bapi Sen gave his life to protect a woman from aggressors on New Year?s Eve, his was the face that launched a campaign in Calcutta.

 Everyday Heroes was an event organised on December 30 by a group that had decided it was time to take a stand and speak out about violence against women. And for once, men would be at the frontline.

 This would also be the trigger, hopefully, for a ?white ribbon campaign? in the city. Just like sporting a red ribbon means supporting the battle against HIV/AIDS, the white ribbon has been adopted by men playing an active role in battling violence against women.

 ?Wearing a white ribbon is a personal pledge never to commit, condone nor remain silent about violence against women,? is the global movement?s mission statement (www.whiteribbon.ca).

 The evening at Oxford Bookstore started off with a forceful monologue by volunteer Tess Joseph about a woman?s resistance to being reduced to stereotypes (she is gentle, smart, compassionate, forgiving, sacrificing and so on). ?It is time to work with men and boys to try and understand things differently,? said moderator Roop Sen.

 Male-bashing was definitely not on the agenda. While men were clearly the perpetrators of violence against women, the discussion included a call for ?a little bit of compassion? and an attempt to understand what makes men resort to violence as a form of self-expression.

 A discussion about aggressive behaviour encompassed its causes, what forms it can take and how we as a society can fight it. But is it reasonable to expect everyday people to have the courage to face a mob of armed men (?How many would be willing to stand up for a man in the same position?? asked Sumit Roy).

 But protest against violence can take less dramatic forms as well. ?Thousands of others may protest violence on a daily basis but the media doesn?t highlight them,? pointed out Anuradha Kapoor of Swayam.

 If it is fear that prevents men from speaking out, the same stops women as well. Why didn?t the woman who Bapi Sen saved speak out, asked the audience. 

 Are the roots in adolescent confusion? Is sexual repression to blame? Is it all about who is in power, who is not, and how to stay in power? Are the stereotypes that men are forced to live up to the cause?

 No solutions were possible ? nor expected ? out of such an evening. But raising the issues and asking the questions could be the start of a wider campaign taken up by men.

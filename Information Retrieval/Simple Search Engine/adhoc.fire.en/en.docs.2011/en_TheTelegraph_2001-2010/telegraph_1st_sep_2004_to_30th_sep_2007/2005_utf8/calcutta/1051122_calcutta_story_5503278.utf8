 The event: The GoodLife Talk Show. The venue: Brindaban Gardens Complex on 98,Christopher Road. The star guests: actress Chaiti Ghosal, gynaecologist Dr Pranab Dasgupta and, of course, Rita Bhimani. The topic: Eat Healthy, Think Better, Live Longer.

 With a line-up so impressive and a topic so relevant, one could expect nothing less than a full house on Sunday evening. And thats precisely what it was at the residential address off Tangra.

 The session started sharp at 6 with Rita putting the first question of the evening to Chaiti, who looked beautiful in a black dress. 

 Asked about her day-to-day beauty regimen, the actress replied: The first step towards remaining beautiful is drinking a lot of water. I begin my day with a glass of water and end my day with the same. I believe everyone should make it a part of the daily routine. Besides, being able to think beautifully is also of extreme importance because what you think internally is reflected on your face. I try remaining happy and content all the time, and hence I think it shows.

 Chaiti then directed a question at Dr Dasgupta, asking him the exact volume of water a person should drink on a daily basis. At least 2.5 litres everyday. And this can be in the form of any fluid. Fruits like apples, oranges and bananas that have high water content will also suffice. Even tea, but of course without milk, adds to the fluid intake and is good for the heart. So, for once your wives should not be complaining about the number of cups you gulp down everyday, the doctor joked.

 The next question was put forward by the ladies of the house: what could be done about the majority of women who had a tendency to neglect their health, concentrating rather on the well being of their families.

 Chaiti said: This is a very sad thing and I agree that it happens with most women. Very often after marriage, women forget all about themselves. But they should realise that since they are the driving force behind every family, it is extremely important that they keep themselves fit. You have to start feeling good about keeping fit and make the other members of your family see that there is absolutely nothing wrong about your attempts to keep fit. If you dont keep yourself in the best of health, how will you be able to look after your family? And stop being dependent on anyone else to look after you. The day you do that, you will see that you have become much more conscious of your own well-being.

 Sujit Sen then asked the doctor about the precautions one needed to take while drinking water and what one should ideally go for ? water from the Aquaguard or bottled water. Water from the Aquaguard, because no matter how safe bottled water is, there is definitely some amount of chemicals in them that could be harmful for your system. So always go for water purified naturally, was the doctors prompt reply.

 A volley of questions was then directed to the three guests of the evening, ranging from the harmful effects of soft drinks, the negatives of a late marriage and the good effects of milk.

 A quiz on The Telegraph also brought a smile to the faces of the gathering as every right answer brought with it a prize.

 The session that carried on beyond an hour drew to a close with a group of youngsters wanting to know from Chaiti and Rita some short cuts to stay in shape.

 The actress of Neel Seemana and Ek Akasher Niche fame said: Honestly speaking, there are no shortcuts to staying fit. You have to lead some sort of a regimented life. Draw up a routine for yourself. Make time to work out either at home or in a gym. And also eat a balanced diet. If you consume a whole lot of oily food and soft drinks, you cannot expect to lose weight and stay in shape. Keep aside at least an hour for yourself every day and see how it does wonders to help you stay fit.

 Rita, on the other hand, suggested a low carbohydrate and high protein diet. Start your day with a bowl of fruits, some juice and include a lot of greens in your daily diet. This will help you stay in shape for as long as you want, smiled Rita.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Journey from J to Jinnah

 Creation of the perception is the 

 key area in marketing. When the brand is a human being, the 

 task is tougher

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Mr 

 Lal Krishna Advani?s resignation has created quite a stir. 

 Much has been written about its political implication. Much 

 more will be discussed in the future. I have neither the 

 intention nor the competence to add to that volume. Of interest 

 to me is Mohammed Ali Jinnah. I will confess, thanks to 

 this newspaper, my knowledge about him has increased manifold 

 in the last few days. That of course is not saying much, 

 my knowledge was near zero earlier. What I have learnt about 

 him has impressed me no end ? purely from a marketing standpoint. 

 But before I come to that, let 

 me hasten to concede that I am fully aware that politics 

 is serious business. Much deeper issues are involved in 

 it than those that are connected with the world of selling 

 soaps and shampoos. Yet at its core politics and marketing 

 have one common ground ? they seek to change people?s mind 

 by creating images and impressions. To a student of marketing, 

 it is this similarity that makes the theatre of politics 

 a great learning ground. 

 Let me now come to the point. 

 An article on the edit page of this paper few days back 

 informed that ?Jinnah was born Mohammad Ali Jinnahbhai. 

 He refashioned this to M.A. Jinnah in London?. His nickname 

 was J. He never wore a tie twice and was a true Sahib in 

 his lifestyle. The same man then gave up his Saville Row 

 suits and suede shoes. He wore sherwanis and Jinnah caps. 

 Spoke in Urdu. He created a credibility that made him known, 

 to quote the same article, ?as the quintessential Muslim 

 politician who roused Muslim religious sentiments to win 

 for himself the state of Pakistan?... 

 When I got educated about this 

 journey from J to Jinnah, what amazed me was the degree 

 of change. A man changed his personae to what can mathematically 

 be described as ?to the power of minus one? of the original. 

 It must have taken gargantuan effort to achieve that transformation, 

 albeit externally. Every mannerism had to be audited to 

 see whether it fits the new image. What was at stake was 

 a whole nation. He eventually won the trophy. 

 In marketing addas across the 

 country, we have all discussed the remarkable feat of the 

 bath soap which credibly promised freshness of lime without 

 having a drop of lime juice in it. Also hailed is the case 

 of a single blend of tobacco, which in two different states 

 of India had been marketed in two avatars. The name, the 

 pack and the advertising had been diametrically opposite 

 of one another. In one state, the blend was promoted as 

 delivering the subtle taste of mildness and in another it 

 was branded as the epitome of manliness and strength. Both 

 brands offered the same smoke, mind you. 

 Marketing greatness is often assessed 

 by the distance between the objective reality of a brand 

 and the subjective reality created in the consumer mind. 

 A good product selling on its own merit is, sadly, seldom 

 considered a marketing feat, however strenuous it might 

 have been to communicate that goodness. Be that as it may, 

 creation of the perception, is the key performance area 

 of marketing. 

 In an inanimate brand the makeover 

 is not by any means easy to handle. When the brand is a 

 human being and the trophy is popular mandate, the degree 

 of difficulty soars a million times. They call the people 

 in marketing dream merchants. The real whiz kids sit in 

 the parliament.

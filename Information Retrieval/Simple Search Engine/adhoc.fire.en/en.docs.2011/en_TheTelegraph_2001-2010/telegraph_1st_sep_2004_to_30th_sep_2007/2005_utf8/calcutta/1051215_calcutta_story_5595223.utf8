The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tourism push for rail hub

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The 100-year-old grand edifice housing the South Eastern Railway headquarters, Bengal Nagpur Railway (BNR) House constructed by Nawaba Wajid Ali Shah and the swing bridge?

 Almost every neighbourhood of Garden Reach bears the impress of the Raj. And the railway authorities are now planning to turn it into a tourist hotspot.

 ?We have plans to start heritage tourism in Garden Reach and Metiaburuz, where relics of the British and Nawabs are abundant,? said Subhasis Ganguly, chief heritage officer of South Eastern Railway (SER).

 The authorities will soon talk to the state tourism department on possible collaborations.

 As a first step towards introducing heritage tourism, SER will celebrate the centenary of the headquarters building (picture above). ?The celebrations will start on April 10 next year,? said Debashish Chanda, SER chief public relations officer.

 Construction of the building, which had once housed the headquarters of erstwhile BNR, was started on April 10, 1906. It was commissioned a year later, when J. Masson was agent (equivalent to general manager). The building cost more than Rs 7 lakh. 

 The mansion, standing on 53,613 sq ft, has been restored to its original form and the authorities are planning to seek heritage status for it.

 The history of the building has been well represented in a book, Garden Reach: A Railway Story, written by Saibal Bose, an SER official.

 The 48-page book also provides information about BNR House, the residence of SER general managers. Wajid Ali Shah once lived in the house, modelled on Metcalfe Hall. It was completed in 1844. 

 ?Apart from these buildings and other bungalows, there are several other historical sites nearby,? heritage officer Ganguly told Metro.

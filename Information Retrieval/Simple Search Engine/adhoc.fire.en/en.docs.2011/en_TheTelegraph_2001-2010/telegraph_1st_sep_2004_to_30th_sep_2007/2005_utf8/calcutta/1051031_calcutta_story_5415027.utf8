 Dignity for women with a past

 RICHA BANSAL

 She was in rags. She used to lodge herself in a corner of the verandah or bundle up on the terrace to while away the nights. If she was lucky, she would some times get a little space in the room. Even for this, she had to do household chores at the age of 75.

 Food was sparse, depending on tips from the customers or her mistress after running errands for them the whole day. If the mistress desired, she would spare the leftovers of one meal a day on the odd day or two.

 This was the story of Belarani Chowdhury?s life, a retired sex worker of Sonagachhi, till quite recently. 

 Unfortunately, barring the 50 lucky retired sex workers, including her, who are now covered under a programme by Women?s Interlink Foundation (WIF) and HelpAge India (HAI), two NGOs that have made the first-ever attempt in the country to restore some dignity to their lives, several others continue to lead a pathetic existence.

 Shunned by society and rejected by their kin once they are past their prime, these women live a life of abject poverty, neglect and humiliation. 

 Hounded by their past, they do not even have the option to beg.

 To alleviate their helplessness, WIF and HAI started a programme last year under which they have adopted 25 each of the most vulnerable women from the redlight areas of Kalighat and Sonagachhi. ?But the need is much more,? says Nishikant Saha of WIF. ?We could accommodate only 50 right now because of limited funds.? 

 They have provided these women with clean clothes, monthly rations, a monthly allowance of Rs 50 and amenities that they require. A sum of Rs 50 is a princely amount for these women. 

 Says Chowdhury: ?Till they came, I could hardly garner Rs 30 a month by the odd jobs I did. Sometimes, it was even less. Most of the time I used to survive on muri and chhatoo once a day.? The Kalighat women were a little better off, says Saha, because they could at least eat the bhog offered at the temple. 

 Now, not only do these women cook, have two proper meals a day, brush their teeth and bathe with soap, they can also avail of the much-needed medical check-up started by the NGOs from September by paying a token fee of Rs 5 each time. 

 Most importantly, they can live with dignity.

 Says Sushmita Ghosh, regional director, East, HAI: ?This is the first time there has been an attempt to do something for aged sex workers in the country. But despite our assistance, two of them died and two went missing.? 

 Saha says: ?We will have to think of employment suitable to their age, as most of them are either 70 or above.?

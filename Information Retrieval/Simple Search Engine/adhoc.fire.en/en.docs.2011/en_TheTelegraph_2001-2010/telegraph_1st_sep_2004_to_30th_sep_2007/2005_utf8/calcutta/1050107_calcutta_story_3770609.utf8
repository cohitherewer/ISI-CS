The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ethnic chic, modern mood

Zeeshan Jawed, Himika Chaudhuri

Residents 

of Salt Lake do not have to trudge to Hindustan Road to pick up trendy kurtas 

and colourful bandhnis anymore. Fabindia opened its second outlet in Calcutta 

and 19th in the country at City Centre on Thursday. 

 ?The city and its adjoining areas are growing by leaps and bounds. There is a very good demand for our products in Salt Lake and Lake Town, so the idea to open up at City Centre,? said Shilpa Sharma, Fabindia project general manager. 

 She added that the final decision was influenced by quite a few factors. ?The very nature of the mall is in tune with the repertoire of Fabindia for one. Second, the Salt Lake population has a considerable amount of disposable income,? explained Sharma.

 But if you are looking for furnishings you will still have to visit the south Calcutta address because the one at City Centre is stocking only garments at the moment. ?We have a space constraint at this store. Since garment is a fast-moving category, we decided to start off with it first. We may keep furnishings in a year?s time, depending on the demand,? said Pallabi Basu, manager, Fabindia.

Rural rage

 What was conceived as a casual idea by four people nine moths ago has materialised into a novel endeavour to promote the rich handicrafts of rural Bengal. 

 The results are up at an exhibition by Urban Village, the organisation that started it all, for everyone to see. From Gambhira masks to shitolpati (mats made of cane), the exhibition features handicrafts from around the state. 

 Debkutir (DC 27/26, Salt Lake City, opposite Julie House), the venue of the event, has been abuzz with activity since Thursday, Day One of the three-day exhibition, which promises to be any gift shopper?s and handicraft lover?s delight. 

 ?The effort to bring rural Bengal to the doorstep of urban Calcutta has involved holding numerous workshops with the artisans to train them in producing things that would appeal to the taste of the city buyer,? said group member Shuby Sharma. 

 Thus denim and silk have been paired with shitolpati to produce trendy handbags for the crushed skirt and spaghetti top die-hards. Dokra junk jewellery, also up for sale, matches the mood. Santiniketan batik has graduated from bags and found its way into card holders and address books. 

 Those with a yen for authentic chic cannot afford to miss out the Gambhira masks on display, originally worn by tribes in north Bengal during their traditional dances. 

 Prices start at Rs 50 and go up to Rs 2,000.

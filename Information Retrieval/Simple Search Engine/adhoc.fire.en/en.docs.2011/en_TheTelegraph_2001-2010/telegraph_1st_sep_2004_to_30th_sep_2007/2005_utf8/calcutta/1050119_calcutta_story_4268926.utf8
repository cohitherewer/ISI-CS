The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Develop slums, build a sphinx

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: What would you want Calcutta to be blessed with in 2005? More letters will appear next week

If wishes were horses...: A new-look city

Nina Talukdar, 

 Gol Park

I want a breath of fresh air in 2005. With pollution 

on the rise, diseases are becoming common, even among children. We have been reading 

about our government?s schemes to clean up the city air, but not a single project 

has taken off. It is high time that instead of discussing ideas which cannot be 

implemented or waiting for some miracle to happen, at least a simple tail-pipe 

emission standard is set for all vehicles, irrespective of their age.

Stuti Agarwal, 

 Beleghata

It will be good to see Calcutta blessed with more 

educational institutions in 2005, so that the student community has the option 

of staying in the city for higher studies rather than moving to Pune or Delhi. 

Setting up educational institutes will surely help in arresting internal brain 

drain and actually attract students from outside.

Gunjeet Wadhwa, 

 Rai Bahadur Road

In 2005, I would want Calcutta to be blessed with 

more Business Process Outsourcing companies. More national and foreign companies 

should set up their establishments here. That would bring in money to the state 

and offer employment to millions. 

Santosh Chakravarty, 

 Unique Park

How fantastic it would be if Calcutta has a huge pyramid 

and a colossal Sphinx, which are Egyptian monopolies, so to say! With the sanction 

of the Centre and the army, the ideal site for the construction of the pyramids 

would be the Brigade Parade Grounds. Only the best builders should be employed 

to construct the pyramids, which should be properly maintained from the start. 

A blissful byproduct of building such pyramids will be a total stoppage of the 

meetings of political parties.

Pujasree Chatterjee, 

 Rashbehari Avenue

In 2005, I want women of Calcutta to feel safe in 

their own homes at least. Every women should be given basic respect and the right 

to choose her lifestyle without any interference from men. 

Payal Srivastava,

 Address not given

I truly wish for a McDonald?s outlet in the city. 

While most of the other fast food chains have set up shop in Calcutta, to eat 

at McDonald?s, one has to travel to Mumbai or New Delhi. McDonald?s would be the 

best gift for everyone this year.

Suvadip Goswami, 

 Maheshtala

Calcutta is one of metropolises of the country. The 

year 2004 gave us flyovers, multiplex etc. But alas! We have no McDonald?s outlet. 

If there is a McDonald?s shop in the centre of city, we food-lovers shall be benefited. 

So, here?s to the opening of a McDonald?s showroom here.

Yashita Banerjee,

 Rashbehari Avenue

This year I want Calcutta to be counted as a pollution-free 

city where we can inhale pure air. Calcutta?s air is contaminated by poisonous 

gases released from vehicles and industries, causing diseases like bronchitis, 

asthma and other lung problems. Only a green revolution can stop this. Let us 

plant saplings.

Ashok Kumar Ghosh,

 CIT Road

Slum development programmes should be undertaken; 

main thoroughfares should be free of slums, unlike the plot opposite to the VIP 

Market on CIT Road in the Phulbagan area. Underground urinals, like those in western 

countries, should be constructed. 

Bhupendra Nath Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park 

During the summer and rainy seasons, thousands of 

people in the city suffer due to water-borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, 

gastroenteritis and diarrhoea. People living in slums and shanties are the worst-hit. 

Easy availability of pure drinking water will solve the problem. I would like 

to request the authorities to supply pure water to all parts of the city. That 

will be a boon in 2005.

Col. Saumya Datta (Retd.) 

 Haji Mohsin Road

I only observed increasingly negative attitude among 

the people of Calcutta during 2004. Hence I pray to the Almighty to discipline 

our citizens. Please make government servants more polite and dedicated to work. 

Once this is achieved, the development of Calcutta will take place automatically. 

Also, I earnestly desire that some of our politicians distance themselves from 

criminals and the corrupt.

Aliasgar Poonawala, 

 Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road

It is becoming extremely difficult for pedestrians 

to move about freely on the roads. There are no proper bus-stops for private buses 

and minibuses. Clearly designated bus-stops are the need of the hour.

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum

There are many roads in Calcutta without footpaths. 

In many other roads, the footpaths are badly damaged. Even Chowringhee Road does 

not have a proper pavement throughout its stretch. Pedestrians are at times forced 

to walk on the carriageway due to absence of footpaths.

Arunita Mukherjee, 

 Santoshpur.

The last year did bring us Big Bazars and 89 Cinemas, 

but did our life improve significantly because of that? Our city should be cleaner 

in 2005. Garbage should be regularly removed, vats and bins should be placed at 

proper locations and people dirtying the streets should be fined. A clean-up drive 

would go a long way in changing perceptions about the city.

Sandhya Banerjee, 

 Salt Lake 

Our foremost aim should be to make Calcutta pollution-free. 

And it is not just the responsibility of the government. People should stop throwing 

garbage on the streets and do everything to keep the city clean. 

Shaona Saha, 

 Chandernagore

It is we, the people, who can change Calcutta by bringing 

a stability in the population which is increasing day by day. Population is the 

prime reason behind almost every problem cropping up in Calcutta. More population 

means transport snarls and scarcity of jobs. The policy of family planning seems 

to have lost its way. I feel that the government should restrict the number of 

births to two per family. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata.

The benefits of development should reach one and all. 

No one should have to go without food, shelter, clothes and education. Their rights 

to healthcare and human rights should also be safeguarded. 

Md Tarique Nisar, 

 Collin Street

In 2005, the government should endeavour to solve 

the problems of hunger, drinking water and shelter that plague Calcutta. However, 

any developmental initiative should be in harmony with nature. Veneration for 

the Mother Earth and for the nobleness of human spirit should be cultivated as 

substitutes for organised religions and ideologies.

Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Burdwan

It is true that a number of flyovers, multiplexes, 

food stops and shopping malls have come up in the city in the last year. But they 

are beyond the means of poor people. I am one of the thousands who travel to the 

city from the suburbs to earn their daily bread. I still find the streets choked 

with traffic jams. A bus still takes an hour to traverse 10 km. Handcarts and 

rickshaws still run amok. A traffic snarl-free Calcutta would top my wishlist 

for 2005.

Kiran Maiti,

 Birati

Let Calcutta move at a faster pace. That is the first 

condition for the city to develop. Nothing is more important.

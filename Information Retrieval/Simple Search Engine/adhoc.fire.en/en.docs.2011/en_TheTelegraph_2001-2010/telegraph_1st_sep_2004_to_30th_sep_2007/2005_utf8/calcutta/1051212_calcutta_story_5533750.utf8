The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Book trip for brand builder

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 To transform a brand name into a generic term in less than 30 years takes some doing, but Madan Birla can stake claim to that achievement.

 A former managing director and preceptor of FedEx?s leadership institute, Birla worked closely with Frederick W. Smith, founder and CEO of FedEx, to transform the company into a $32-billion behemoth, and made it synonymous with air and ground cargo and freight transportation.

 In Calcutta for the launch of his book, FedEx Delivers, Birla spoke extensively about his 22 years at FedEx. 

 He attributed the success of the company to intense customer focus, constant innovation and the leadership process.

 FedEx Delivers talks about the company becoming an international powerhouse and a global brand within a relatively short period of time, by tapping into the creativity and commitment of its employees and its customers.

 Birla described India as a ?big expansion area? for FedEx. He had words of encouragement for Calcutta as well. ?The city is certainly on the move. The traffic and infrastructure situation has improved drastically, and I have to say, that the state government is making the right moves to attract investors,? he stated.

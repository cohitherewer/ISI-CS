The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rising from the heap

 He has worked with Mira Nair in Monsoon Wedding. Albeit in a bit role. Played a meatier role in Anurag Kashyap?s Black Friday. The no-show hasn?t helped. But now, Dibyendu Bhattacharya is all set to share screen space with Aamir Khan in Ketan Mehta?s biggie The Rising: Legend of Mangal Pandey. The 30-year-old Bengali from Thakurpukur has treaded the difficult path to follow his acting passion but has finally found a place among the stars. 

 A graduate from the National School of Drama, Dibyendu has no qualms in accepting that it was sheer luck that helped him bag a role in the big-budget Bobby Bedi project. As Kripashankar Singh, one of the sepoys who form the central core of the film, Dibyendu also got to watch Aamir the actor from close quarters.

 ?One had only heard of his professionalism and perfectionist trait, but working with him over the months, I got to see those tales turn real,? says Dibyendu, who has moved on from his humble background and now made Mumbai his home. 

 Much like the Laagan eleven, Rising sees Dibyendu as a part of the super six. ?From the time the script reading sessions started, Aamir made it a point to be present for most of our meetings. Even on days when he didn?t have a shot he would be present on the sets to see how things were shaping up,? adds Dibyendu. 

 If the Aamir edge gave him the experience of a lifetime, Vikram Bhatt?s Aetbaar helped Dibyendu realise another dream. ?I played John Abraham?s friend in the film and that?s when I first met Mr. Bachchan on the sets,? he recalls, still starry eyed about the brief interaction. 

 ?He has a great sense of humour. I was doing this action shot with him where I had to fake a high kick aimed at him. Mr. Bachchan behaved like it had actually hit him and said, ?Dheere bhai, bura ho raha hoon!?, which sent the entire unit bursting out in laughter.? 

 Dibyendu hopes The Rising will do for him what Aetbaar and Black Friday couldn?t. ?I have worked very hard, like everyone else in the crew, and I want people to take notice of me.?

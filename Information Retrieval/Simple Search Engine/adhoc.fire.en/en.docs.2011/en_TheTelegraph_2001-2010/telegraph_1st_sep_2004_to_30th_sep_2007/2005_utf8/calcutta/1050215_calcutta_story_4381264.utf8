 Christiano Ronaldo: Pin-up boy

 Pepe Jeans London has signed up 19-year-old Manchester United star, Christiano Ronaldo as Pepe?s face for 2005. The Portuguese international footballer has been paired with supermodel Jessica Miller for the advertising campaign to roll out globally (including India) from March 2005.

 Commenting on the new advertising campaign, Chetan Shah, country head, Pepe Jeans India, said: ?Sport in England is best remembered the world over for its richest club, Manchester United. Christiano Ronaldo is one of the club?s biggest and most prized possessions and dubbed as the next David Beckham. Pepe Jeans saw an exciting opportunity in him ? he gels perfectly well with Pepe?s characteristic attitude.?

 While Ronaldo has been a stunner on the field, switching from left flank to right with quicksilver ease, Jessica shot to fame overnight after her chance meeting with celebrated fashion photographer Inez van Lamsweerde. Since then, Jessica has featured in advertising campaigns for Armani, Fendi, CK, Blumarine and Chloe and has also been featured in the Pirelli Calendar. 

 As for the campaign, the visuals by photographer Steven Klein are ?smoky, sexy and raw?. The shoot is conceptually based on a mixture of two movies by legendary film-maker Michelangelo Antonioni ? Zarbriskie Point (1970), the epic story of late 60s? America seen through the portrayal of two of its children and Deserto Rosso (1964), the story of a factory in Ravenna, Italy, where waste product from the plant pollutes a local lake.

A moment from LOC: Neighbours all

 After the skyrocketing TRP ratings of Kkavyanjali, STAR Plus is ready with its next big ?un, Life Out of Control (LOC). The new serial is an out-and-out comedy revolving around a restaurant called St Martins Spice ? Indian Restaurant in central London. The humour arises out of the constant conflict between the head chef, an Indian named Gurpreet Singh Mallik, and the head waiter, a Pakistani named Chand Mohammed.

 Gurpreet and Chand are the bitterest of enemies who often turn the restaurant into a war zone with plates and glasses in place of bullets and guns. The owner of the restaurant, Britisher Simon York is in a precarious position as he keeps cursing his forefathers for partitioning India. What?s worse is that York can?t fire either of them since his clientele loves Gurpreet?s curries and the Moghul treatment given by Chand.

 Produced by Rajeev Mehra of Eagle Films, the sitcom stars Manoj Pawa, Chand Mallik and Tom Alter in the three main roles. LOC hits STAR Plus on February 25 and is slotted for every Friday between 8.30 pm and 9.30 pm.

Mughal-e-Azam: Old is gold

 The Valentine?s saga continues on the small screen as we wait for the second episode of Outback Jack on STAR World. The show, which premiered last Thursday, is about a dozen girls competing for their Mr Right. The show creates the ultimate test of love as 12 high-maintenance women vie for the affections of a rugged Australian adventurer. 

 But it ain?t that easy! To meet Jack, the women will have to parachute into the middle of the untamed Australian outback. What?s more, once they are there, they discover that the potential man of their dreams is not living a life of luxury, but roughing it out on one of the world?s most unforgiving terrains. Over the course of eight episodes, these pampered women will be put to the test, to see which one of them has the stamina to survive in the outback and win the affection of their handsome hero Jack. 

 At only 28, Jack has already accomplished an amazing collection of feats. The east Melbourne native has earned numerous titles and medals in swimming, judo, karate, grappling, football and horseback riding. An accomplished mountain climber, he climbed 7,000 metres to the Mount Thurong peak. In addition, he is a tri-athlete, an avid trail bike racer, white water rafter and skydiver.

 ?It?s a real-life romantic comedy. These are women who don?t like camping. Most of them have never even been camping. The outdoors? Bugs? Forget about it,? said Bruce Nash, the programme producer. ?They?ll be going on dates, but it?s dinner in a tree house or things involving camels and horses.?

 So, to be a part of the fun fatale watch Outback Jack, every Thursday on Star World, 10 pm.

 Almost half a century after it was envisioned and executed, K. Asif?s Mughal-e-Azam has been selected for the prestigious Berlin Film Festival this year. In its 55th year, the festival authorities have invited the freshly coloured magnum opus, to be showcased under the Retrospective and Homage category. The 14-day festival has kicked off last Thursday. 

 The Retrospective section of this year?s festival is dedicated to the profession and impact of production design. It is structured around five topics that reveal various mechanisms and aspects of production design. The series will encompass 45 international films from the past 65 years. The Retrospective brings German and international films back to the big screen ? often as a restored version or a new copy and films are placed in their historical context. In the past, films showcased in the category include such classics like Citizen Kane, It?s A Wonderful Life, Wizard Of Oz, Star Wars and Exorcist.

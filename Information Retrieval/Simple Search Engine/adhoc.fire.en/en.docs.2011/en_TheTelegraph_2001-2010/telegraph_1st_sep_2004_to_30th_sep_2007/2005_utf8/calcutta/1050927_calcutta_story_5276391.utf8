The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Park a car to clog the bridge

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 Traffic snarls, seemingly never-ending, on the approach roads to Howrah bridge have forced many to miss their trains, and are a nightmare for daily commuters between Calcutta and its twin city.

 The approach roads are clogged the entire day, except for a few hours at night, thanks to countless illegal parking lots on them and under the bridge. Commuters have an especially harrowing time during the peak hours.

 Rows of cars, Matadors, motorcycles and even heavy vehicles are parked with unfailing regularity in no-parking zones on Strand Bank Road, Brabourne Road, Strand Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street and in Raja Katra. Cycle-vans and handcarts, too, are not rare.

 The illegally-parked vehicles not only reduce the road space, but choke the intersections where the bridge meets the roads.

 Deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim admitted to the problem, but blamed Puja shoppers for the chaos. ?Most of these shoppers illegally park their cars on the roads. The area is crowded and unplanned and there is little parking space. Our department conducts raids regularly and fines errant vehicle-owners. The raids will have to be intensified,? he added.

 Local residents, however, say police are hand-in-glove with those who run the illegal parking spaces, a claim confirmed by a youth who works in one such parking lot. ?We pay enough to police. Whenever there is a possibility of a raid, we are warned days in advance,? said the youth.

 Most parking lots are a stone?s throw from the local North Port police station and quite a few operate right across it. According to the youth, a four-wheeler is charged anything between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 and a two-wheeler Rs 400-500 per month for a 10 am-4 pm slot. Short-duration fees are also in place. 

 Suresh Yadav, a businessman in Howrah, is one such person who faces harassment daily because of the clogs caused by illegal parking. 

 ?This is a regular menace for us. I use the bridge to get to my office in Calcutta and it takes me more than half-an-hour at times to cross the area. A traffic booth has just been erected there, but the cops on duty are nothing but mute witnesses to the chaos,? complained Yadav.

 Be it rolls, chow mein, roti-tarka or biryani, the day is not far when tourists need not be afraid of contracting enteric diseases after savouring edibles from roadside stalls in the city.

 After conducting a series of programmes on how to maintain hygiene while cooking, storing and serving food for roadside stall-owners, the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health has earmarked some streets in Calcutta where the vendors are now selling ?safe? food.

 The institute has proposed to the state and Union tourism departments that the names of the streets, as well as the stall-owners, be included in their guides, so that tourists can enjoy street food without fearing health problems.

 According to officials, the streets earmarked are Camac Street, Elgin Road, Chowringhee and Shakespeare Sarani.

 ?A number of vendors across the city are now selling safe food. We have so far trained more than 2,500 vendors. The programme is still on,? said Indira Chakraborty, a senior scientist of the institute and the programme head.

 Studies have revealed that nearly 150,000 vendors operate in the city, selling more than 300 varieties of food.

 The most popular items include phuchka, chana-batura, fish fry, dahi-vada, roti-sabzi, biryani, egg rolls and sweets.

 Officials said a special training module ? the Calcutta model ? has been used to train the vendors. The authorities plan to use the module for similar training programmes in Delhi, Mumbai and Pune.

 According to the officials, there are proposals from countries like South Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar to conduct training programmes based on the Calcutta model.

 The institute, in collaboration with police and Calcutta Municipal Corporation, launched the programme in 2003 following complaints that food vendors had a poor sense of hygiene, the officials added.

 As part of the programme, vendors are taught how to keep their stalls and utensils clean and free from contamination. They are also told what kind of edible oil they should use and what diseases their customers can suffer if hygiene is not maintained.

 ?We have benefited from the training. We all wear aprons now and provide mineral water to customers. The number of our customers has increased,? said a vendor in the Camac Street area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Teenager sold by sister?s husband

 A STAFF REPORTER

 She?s only 14 but life?s turned into a living hell for her. Already, she has gone through a 12-month confinement in a brothel in Mumbai, and another three in a small, dingy room in central Calcutta, thanks to her brother-in-law, who had sold her.

 The girl narrated her tale of woe before the detective department. Subsequently, officers of the Immoral Trafficking section arrested her brother-in-law Rezaul Karim at Basirhat, in North 24-Parganas, and two others ? Gautam Halder and his wife Angoora Bibi ? at Mathurapur, in South 24-Parganas, on Thursday night. 

 All of them were arrested on the charge of selling the girl and forcing her into prostitution. Since she has no place to go, the court sent her to Liluah Home, the state-run refuge centre for destitute women.

 Rajesh Subarno, deputy commissioner (special) of the detective department, said the girl?s rescue followed a raid on a house on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road on September 4. 

 ?We arrested a procuress, identified as Sabitri Chakraborty, and six other sex workers. The girl was not present when we raided the place. She returned only after the officers left,? he stated.

 She was brought to Lalbazar police headquarters by a passerby who found her loitering on Kaiser Street. The girl had gone out to buy food during the raid. When she returned, she found no one in the house. She immediately fled. Then, she started roaming aimlessly.

 The girl told police that she was staying with her sister and her husband Rezaul at Satberia village, in Basirhat. 

 ?In July last year, Rezaul took me to Mumbai, apparently to find me a job. There, I was bundled into a small room and the torture started from the next day. I was asked to entertain people. Even though Rezaul visited the place frequently, he never tried to rescue me. Then I realised that I had been sold.?

 The girl was cooped up there for a year. Then, one morning, Rezaul asked her to leave with him and brought her back to Basirhat. She was practically kept confined in the house. Her sister did not dare to raise her voice against her husband.

 After 10 days, Rezaul again left the village with the girl and took her to the house on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. 

 ?I was taken there in July and forced to do the same job that I did in Mumbai. Since the day Rezaul left me here, I have not seen him. I realised that I had been sold for a second time,? she recounted.

 Later, police first picked up Rezaul from his house. After interrogating him, police came to know of Gautam and Angoora who had helped Rezaul take the girl to Mumbai.

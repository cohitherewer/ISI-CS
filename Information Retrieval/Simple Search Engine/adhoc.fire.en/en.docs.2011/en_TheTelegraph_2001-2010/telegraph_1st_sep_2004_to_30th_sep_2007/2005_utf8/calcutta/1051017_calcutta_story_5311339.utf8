 When the whole city was gearing up for the Pujas, Taj Bengal was busy setting the mood for Christmas, still a good two months away. 

 This, in order to ensure that Calcuttans have their cookies and cakes ready in time for Christmas.

 Chefs of the hotel along with German consul-general Gunter Wehrmann and percussionist Bikram Ghosh got together one afternoon for the annual cake-mixing ritual at the hotel bakery amidst much fanfare.

 The ingredients included everything from almonds, apricots, black currant, candid gingers, figs, glazed cherries, sultana, dates, apples, melted butter, golden syrup and honey to clove powder, cinammon powder, natural flavours, brandy and rum.

 The hotels executive chef Sujan Mukherjee explained: This ritual of cake mixing has more than an element of history attached to it. Right from the medieval times, it has been a part of Christmas celebrations all over Europe. We will ferment this mix for the next two months and then go on with the process of baking, so that the goodies are ready just in time for the Christmas week.

 The entertainer that he is, Bikram got all excited as he mixed the ingredients enthusiastically. It feels great and the smell is simply intoxicating! I am waiting to lay my hands on the final product that comes out of the oven, he said.

 So, bid adieu to the Pujas and get set for Christmas.

 Colour plus

 Puja 2005 may be over but you do want to look your best for the host of festivities still lined up right through the season. 

 The latest collection at Purple on Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue offers an eclectic blend of fashion and festivity worth checking out.

 Be it Indian wear, western wear, shoes, bags or accessories, bright splashes rule the racks. Weve used a lot of splashy colours as our collection is a reflection of the celebration mood all around, reveals co-owner Pooja Nihalani.

 A lot of zari and hand embroidery adorns the Indian wear. The kurtis are an inspiration from the Moroccan style that are embellished with turquoise and coral stones. 

 Some of the tops and kurtis have an interesting neckline adorned with jewellery.

 Our collection is ideal for mix and match. Each can be teamed with the other to make for perfect fusion wear, smiles Pooja. 

 The accessory section does not disappoint with bags in shell and metallic embellishments and belts metallic, shell and beaded. The sandals are decorated with stones and crystals.

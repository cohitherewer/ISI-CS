The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rethink on primary schools 

 BIKASH RANJAN BHATTACHARYA, mayor of Calcutta, met readers of The Telegraph at his residence on July 10 to answer their queries. Participants included Partha Das, Chandana Roychaudhury, Ezaz Ahmed, Md. Mustafa, Aniruddha Prasad Roy, Sambhu Charan Roy, Malay Ghosh, Chandrasekhar Sil, Jayanti Mukherjee, Tanmoy Bhattacharya and Sampa Saha

Sampa Saha: The primary schools run by Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are not doing well. False enrolment is rampant and there aren?t more than 20 students in most schools. Rs 16 crore is spent every year to run the schools. Can?t they be turned into vocational centres for uneducated slum-dwellers?

 I have been thinking along the same lines. The concept of civic primary schools for the downtrodden has lost relevance since the state government has made education free upto the Madhyamik level. Vocational training centres are, however, lacking. It won?t be much of a problem for the CMC to start such centres.

Md. Mustafa: The civic health infrastructure virtually collapsed during the Trinamul tenure. Will you take steps to revitalise the system?

 The collapse of the civic health infrastructure is causing people to rush to government hospitals for minor ailments. We have a plan to involve NGOs in the civic health set-up. 

Ezaz Ahmed: Calcutta Girls? College in Goaltuli Lane, close to the CMC headquarters, has a student strength of over 500. It functions on the campus of a civic primary school, with very few students. Can?t the school be merged with a nearby CMC school? 

 It is surprising that a civic primary school and a girls? college affiliated to Calcutta University have been sharing a campus. As I said earlier, we are doing a rethink on civic primary schools. Since the schools no longer appeal to the lower middle-class people, we have a plan to convert them to vocational training centres. I need to consult the status report of the school. If the number of students in the school is found to be very low, I have no objection to it being merged with another civic school in the locality. 

Jayanti Mukherjee: Thanks to CMC Act 1980, law-abiding and tax-paying house-owners have been subjected to all sorts of harassment and penalisation by the civic body, when almost an equal number of flat and house-owners have been enjoying all types of utility services absolutely free since they are owners of illegally-built houses or flats. 

 We must tax the unassessed buildings. I am planning to introduce a self-assessment scheme for owners of such houses. The state government, too, is planning something along the same lines. The introduction of self-assessment of property tax is inevitable. It is physically impossible for a handful of inspectors to assess all buildings. Inspectors will be there just for sample cross-checking.

Jayanti Mukherjee: Are you also going for a voluntary disclosure scheme?

 We will have both self-assessment and voluntary disclosure schemes. Without voluntary disclosure of the living space in sq ft, it is impossible to collect the annual property tax on it. Under the self-assessment scheme, a rate of annual valuation per square foot will be announced for residential and commercial use. If inspection reveals that a house-owner has deliberately under-assessed his property, he will have to shell out a hefty penalty.

Malay Ghosh: Corruption among civic inspectors is rampant.Your predecessors have failed miserably in crushing the inspector raj. Can we expect success from you?

 A recast of the civic Acts is urgently needed, but it can?t be done overnight. Citizens have an important part to play in the fight against corruption. While people have the right to expect honesty from civic officials, they should also stick to the rules. I request you to be more alert and inform me when a civic inspector or his tout demands money.

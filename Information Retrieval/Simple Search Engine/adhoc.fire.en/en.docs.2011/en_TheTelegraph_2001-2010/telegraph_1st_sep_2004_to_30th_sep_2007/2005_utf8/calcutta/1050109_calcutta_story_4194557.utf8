The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Local setting, global feeling

The focal point of the club?s symbol is the lotus-and-rose 

motif suggesting the meeting point of European and Indian values. And till 1960, 

Calcutta Club had followed its tradition of having one European and one Indian 

president in alternate years.

When the International Evening made its debut in 1979, 

it instantly became the most successful and popular social happening in the history 

of the club ? an evening that epitomised the institution?s motto of cross-cultural 

camaraderie.

The brainchild of then president Amitava Roy, it had 

initially started in 1979 as an international food festival with all the city 

consulate offices taking active interest and participating wholeheartedly, recalls 

Dhrubajyoti Banerjea, executive committee member.

?The families of the consular diplomats used to bring 

home-cooked food typical of their respective countries and put up stalls hawking 

the fare. They also brought imported liquor to add cheer to the party. The Germans 

got their beer, the British got their Scotch whisky and it was a hearty blast 

for all,? says Banerjea.

As the US and UK, French and German diplomatic missions 

boasted a strong presence in the city during those days, there were often cultural 

troupes from those countries visiting Calcutta during winter. 

?We always requested the consulate offices to ensure 

that the visits coincided with our International Evening and more often than not, 

they obliged,? adds Banerjea, busy editing the souvenir for this year?s event.

But with the diminishing importance of consulate offices 

in Calcutta ? ?from the mid-90s? ? consular participation has dwindled. While 

Bangladesh and Nepal are regulars, others have cut down the size of their city 

staff. That reflects on their response to the event, which has lost some of its 

old appeal and ?authentic foreign cuisine? USP.

Thus, while food was the fulcrum before, nowadays 

it?s more pop culture with DJ music and lucky draws. ?We give out contracts to 

various star hotels to recreate cuisine from different parts of the world,? says 

club president Bhaskar Sen.

The International Evening (file picture) is traditionally 

held in the third week of January and falls on the 22nd this year. Sen, while 

lamenting the relatively low-key involvement of the consulates of late, is still 

confident of an ?impressive field? this time: ?We are expecting participation 

from consular representatives of countries like Portugal, Chile, Malaysia, Philippines, 

Thailand and possibly Sweden, besides Bangladesh.?

The club management expects a turnout of around 5,000, 

with fusion music, dance troupes and DJ beats to supplement the numerous food 

stalls. The theme for this year?s event is One World ? One Vision, with architect 

Dulal Mukherjee doing the theme d?cor.

?No matter what, the cosmopolitan, socio-culturally 

sensitive Calcuttan does not want to miss a date with International Evening. It?s 

an evening to celebrate friendship through fun, food and festivity,? says Sen. 

Part of the funds collected on the occasion is reserved for the ?weaker sections 

of society? and contributed to the Governor?s or chief minister?s relief fund.

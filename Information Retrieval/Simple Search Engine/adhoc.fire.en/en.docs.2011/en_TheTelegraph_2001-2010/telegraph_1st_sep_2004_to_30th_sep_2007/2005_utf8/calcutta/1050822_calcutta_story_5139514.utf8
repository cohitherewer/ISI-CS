The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Airport halt to civic job

 JAYANTA BASU

 A pass-the-buck game between the airport authorities and the civil aviation ministry has jeopardised a proposed solid waste management facility.

 The facility, to come up on 14 acres at Fatellapur, under North Dum Dum Municipality, has to have a no-objection certificate from the civil aviation authorities, as the site is around 16 km from the airport. Any project within 20 km of the airport has to be approved of by the ministry.

 ?We have done everything, including obtaining an authorisation certificate from the state pollution control board, but the airport authorities have been holding back permission for more than a year,? said Ratan Neogi, member of the chairman?s council, North Dum Dum Municipality.

 ?There are some problems with the permission,? admitted Asok Bhattacharya, minister for municipal affairs and urban development.

 The airport authorities have cleared the height of the project, likely to be between three and four metres, but they fear that waste dumped in the facility will attract birds, posing a threat to air traffic.

 A state pollution control board official, however, said: ?The bird factor has been taken into consideration and the project report ? with inputs from National Productivity Council and Karnataka Compost Development Corporation ? has long been submitted to the airport authorities.? 

 The project, being overseen by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), has been planned in a way to ?eliminate the possibility of the bird menace?, the official added.

 ?The file containing the reports has been sent to the ministry, which has the final authority to grant permission,? said D.K. Goswami, deputy general manager (airport), Calcutta.

 However, according to ministry sources, the permission can be granted only after the local authorities endorse the experts? claim, which airport officials refuse to do on the grounds of a lack of expertise.

 ?We are suffering for someone else?s lack of expertise. Around Rs 1.5 crore has been sanctioned for the project, and equipment already purchased is lying idle,? said Neogi.

 The CPCB has committed 50 per cent of the installation cost of about Rs 5 crore. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will bear the rest. North Dum Dum and New Barrackpore municipalities, which will benefit from the project, will share the land cost.

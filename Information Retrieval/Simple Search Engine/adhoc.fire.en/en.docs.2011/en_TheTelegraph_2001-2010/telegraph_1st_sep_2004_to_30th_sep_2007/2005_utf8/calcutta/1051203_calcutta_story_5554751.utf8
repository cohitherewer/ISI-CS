 Of discipline and despair

 He has been able to make dancers out of teenagers who have never heard a note of music, but are now good enough to be role models for the community at large. Whether dancing to a traditional alaap, Louiz Banks?s jazz or the Pung Cholom drummers of Manipur; performing in closed auditoriums, on moonlit gardens, around artistic installations, a pool or a hotel balcony ? Astad Deboo has wowed audiences in Europe, South East Asia, the US and Australia.

 There seems to have been a sea change in public opinion from the late 1960s, when Deboo recalls ?the cultural aficionados in India were not very open and there was a lot of opposition?. But has there really been a change in the Calcutta mindset?

 When Contrapositions was presented on November 29 by Deboo and his team from Clarke School for the Deaf, Chennai, the ITC Sonar Bangla banquet was only three-quarters full. But Contrapositions found countless admirers the following morning and evening at GD Birla Sabhagar.

 ?Reactions vary in different parts of the country. Audiences in the West have learnt to be very open, but even so not everybody can be expected to conform. As an artiste, one can only try and present one?s work,? says Deboo, who initially trained in kathak and then went on to explore traditions overseas.

 ?The morning show (on November 30) was heartening because about 600 children had turned up, most from special schools for the deaf. For a change, my dancers were able to converse freely with the audience and shake hands with them. It was what I had always wanted ? making these talented dancers role models for their own community.?

 Contrapositions (the inaugural piece for the 20th Deaflypics in Melbourne, January 2005) is based on the navarasas, the nine emotions of Natyashastra. To the evocative music of Amit Heri, Deboo and the seven young girls in costumes of blue, red and amber created a marvellous kaleidoscope, giving glimpses of man in relation to the universe, his varied physical and spiritual adventures.

 The display of discipline and physical control in Contrapositions is awe-inspiring. Apart from the ?mathematical system of gestures? (based on counts of 8 to 12), Deboo has had to ?sketch little scenarios? for his dancers who cannot react to the music, but can ?think about sad or happy incidents in their own lives? and adapt their facial expressions accordingly.

 ?I don?t do anything unless I am sure,? claims the virtuoso, despairing of the rapid erosion of emotions with the growing mechanisation of the modern age. ?In the West one hardly ever talks directly to a person, whenever you want something you click keys or speak into a machine,? says Deboo. But Contrapositions is not just that, he warns. The audience must be totally involved in the presentation and must ?make their own interpretations?.

 Currently ?based in an aeroplane,? because ?there are so many programmes, workshops, training sessions?, Deboo points out the need for more platforms for contemporary dance to really grow in India. ?There are dancers working in Chennai, Calcutta, Mumbai and other places but there are not enough presenters. And people don?t bother to show up for contemporary dance shows unless there is a foreign choreographer involved,? says the 58-year-old who left India in 1969 and has continued his quest across Japan, Europe, China, Indonesia, Australia and the US.

 After choreographing for M.F. Husain?s Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities, Deboo has been flooded with offers from the likes of Ram Gopal Verma and Shyam Benegal, but he says ?Bollywood is not the end of the quest for me?. 

 Instead, he is proud of his 17 years spent working with deaf artistes. ?I am more comfortable with them and there is a need to project their talents. Over the years, I have found the necessary infrastructure to support these projects,? he says.

 Contrapositions will be staged in Bhubaneswar on December 3, World Disability Day. On January 18, Deboo and a mixed team (dancers both with and without hearing impairment) will present Rivers, based on Amir Khusru?s poems, in Washington DC.

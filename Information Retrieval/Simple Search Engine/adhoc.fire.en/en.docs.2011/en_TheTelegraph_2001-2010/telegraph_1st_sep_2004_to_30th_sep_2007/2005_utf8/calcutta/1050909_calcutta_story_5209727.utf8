The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Singapore buoyant on biz ties

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Town planning and cutting-edge biotechnology, tourism and educational centres of excellence, environmental engineering and restoration of heritage facades ? Singapore is keen on handholding missions with Calcutta in various sectors.

 ?There has always been a special connect with this city and we can play a catalysing role in many areas in Calcutta if the environment is right and logistics support is good,? Lee Lorling, deputy high commissioner of Singapore, told Metro on Wednesday.

 Lorling, on her maiden visit to Calcutta to ?understand the soul of the city?, stressed that the island nation was keen to engage India economically in many sectors, and that following the investment-scouting trip of ?Mr Bhattacharjee?, Bengal?s stock has risen significantly among Singapore?s business community.

 But for trade ties to consolidate further, better air connectivity is a primary requisite, she stressed: ?A more liberal, open-sky policy, like China?s, could help add momentum.? 

 Alan Tan, first secretary, (commercial) agreed the winds of collaboration were now extremely favourable. ?Our open-door policy can open up many fronts of concord,? Tan hoped.

 Lorling felt one such accord area could be Bengal?s top educational institutions. ?We could look at R amp;D tie-ups with IIT Kharagpur or IIM Joka, besides long-term student exchange programmes involving our universities,? she said.

 A group of professionals from Singapore-based biotech firms on an exploratory visit to Calcutta facilitated by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) eastern region, shared the deputy high commissioner?s buoyancy on business.

 ?India has very strong fundamentals in pharmaceuticals, and cellular therapy ? a new global line of treatment ? could well be the next big thing here,? said Jonathan Liau, business development executive, Cellsciences.

 Fellow Singaporean biotech company Cordlife is weighing the possibility of setting up a tissue banking facility in town. ?The chief minister?s visit, and all the pro-investment noises he made there, have been very well accepted in Singapore and there?s a new interest in Calcutta,? said Arijit Mookerjee, Cordlife?s group financial controller.

 Many more collaborative arrangements in the healthcare sector of Calcutta are possible, felt Simon Hoo, business development manager of Cygenics, another Singapore biotech major. ?We work in tandem with top healthcare providers in Singapore and similar arrangements could be worked out here,? Hoo said.

 The biotech group, along with Lorling, met commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen on Thursday. ?Yes, they are keen to set up a stem-cell unit and have spoken to health department officials. They also inquired about taxation laws and procedures here and the deputy high commissioner stressed on the need for more flights,? Sen said.

 Sumit Dabriwal, chairman of CII?s infrastructure core committee, said talks are on with some Singapore institutions for setting up medical colleges in or around Calcutta. A Singapore infrastructure delegation is expected in November.

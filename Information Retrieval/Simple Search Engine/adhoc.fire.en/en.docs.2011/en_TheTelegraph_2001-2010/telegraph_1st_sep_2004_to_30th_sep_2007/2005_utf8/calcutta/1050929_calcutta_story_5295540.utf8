 A cut above most others

 Anusha Lihala is in Class III, but she knows more about pain and suffering than many of us. Struggling through it all with a smile, she was awarded the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence on Wednesday morning at Science City auditorium.

 Diagnosed with beta thalassaemia when she was seven months old, the solution was bone marrow transplant. The Lihala family breathed a sigh of relief when her sister?s marrow matched hers. Five months later, the toddler suffered graft versus host disease.

 Anusha?s condition improved following trial-drug treatment at John Hopkins University, USA, but she still has joint contractures and needs plastic surgery to improve her face. And she lives with the pain. Yet, the student of Cambridge School continues to attend class and participate in various other activities.

 Anusha was one of 14 children honoured for their courage in facing life?s challenges head-on.

 There was another Class III student, Deepak Malik. The Army Public School student has Duchene Muscular Dystrophy. The fatal disease has already claimed the use of his legs. He lives on a daily dose of medicines and acute pain, and the prognosis for the future is further deterioration. Yet, Deepak is the class topper.

 Joint winners of the award on Wednesday were Anusha and Priyanka Saha, a Class VIII student of BD Memorial Institute, who has been single-handedly nursing her invalid parents for the past two years. Within two months, both her parents suffered cerebral attacks. She tends to them, looks after her younger sister, does part-time jobs and finds the time to study and participate in school activities.

 Anusha and Priyanka apart, the others awarded certificates of honour were equally ?courageous, confident and compassionate?, to borrow words used by chief guest N.R. Narayana Murthy.

 Youngsters like Ambreen Khatoon. The Class X student of Ashok Hall lost her mother at childbirth. The 15-year-old took up the household reins, looking after her infant sister and ailing grandmother. She also excels in sports.

 The Infosys chief mentor, who called for the country?s youth to be more ?proactive?, singled out Vikash Sharma for this virtue. The Class IX student of Hariyana Vidya Mandir reacted at the right time and went out of his way to save the life of fellow-student Dipika Khanna when she met with an accident on way to school. 

 Vikash stopped, pulled her out of the vehicle she was in, took her to the nearest hospital and alerted her family.

 ?We must stand up and act and speak with courage,? stressed Narayana Murthy.

 Courage was a quality available in abundance at the Science City auditorium. 

 Take Manali Roy, who is deaf but passed Madhyamik 2005 in the first division from Khanpur Girls High School. She manages by lip-reading and is now studying humanities in Class XI. 

 Or Usto Roy Dakua, diagnosed with leukaemia in 2001. The illness meant missing many school days. In 2005, three years late but undaunted, he sat for the ICSE exam and passed with 79 per cent.

 And there were the Singh siblings. Amandeep, 7, Sukhjit, 10, and Sukhjot, 11, lost their father to malignant malaria in 1998. Last year, their mother died of brain fungus. Yet, the three students of La Maternelle school have one aim: ?Hum jo kuch bhi karenge, achha karenge.?

 A cut above, is how these children were described on Wednesday morning. Children like Soumya Santra, the Don Bosco Liluah student diagnosed with beta thalassaemia when just 10 months old. He is now head of the school literary club, plays the synthesiser and is an avid debater and elocutionist.

 Or Sayantan Mukherjee. Born with one arm, the Class IV student of MC Kejriwal Vidyapith is a karate champ. And despite suffering from Gullen Burry Syndrome, leaving him with physical weakness and speech problem, Varun Desai, 14, of Bridge International School, is back in school and eager to excel.

 Washed art

From ancient times, Indian art has been associated with water-based mediums, collectively referred to as watercolour. The colonial era saw the emergence of transparent watercolours as opposed to the opaque forms used earlier. Trends and Techniques: Watercolour in India highlights this genre of painting as it evolved from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day. Featuring works inspired by the famous ?wash? technique of Abanindranath Tagore, the guache of Jamini Roy that attained perfection in its rural simplicity and Hemen Majumdar?s British style of painting (picture above), the show presents a picture of tradition in ?active continuity?. Ganesh Haloi?s individualistic expressions in guache, the unmistakable luminosity of the watercolours of Shyamal Dutta-Roy and Paresh Maity, among others, make this exhibition a tribute to all those artists who have collectively raised this art to the zenith of artistic excellence.

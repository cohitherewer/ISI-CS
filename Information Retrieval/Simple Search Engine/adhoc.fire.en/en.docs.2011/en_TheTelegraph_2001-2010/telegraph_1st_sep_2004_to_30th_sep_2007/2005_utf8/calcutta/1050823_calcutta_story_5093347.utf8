The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Multiplex bar holds no water

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Next time you go to catch a film at a multiplex, make sure you?re travelling light ? no sharp objects, no tobacco products, no food items and no water from home.

 For some, like Dibendu Ghosh, being stopped from carrying water of their choice is reason enough not to enter a multiplex. The cause: violation of a fundamental right.

 ?On August 11, I had gone to watch Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya with a friend at a multiplex off EM Bypass. I was carrying a bottle of boiled water, as I always do. I was stopped at the gate, told to deposit the bottle at the counter and purchase water from inside. I did not agree and demanded a refund for the ticket, which was not given? I was denied my fundamental right,? says Ghosh.

 The letter of law supports him. According to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, auditorium authorities have no right to prevent audiences from bringing in potable water with them.

 According to Article 21, restraining a person from carrying potable water inside an auditorium for his own consumption is against the principles of natural justice.

 The multiplexes voice their own reasons for regulating water flow, ranging from safety to sales. ?There is a tendency among some to mix alcohol with water. Colourless spirits like vodka and gin are difficult to detect just by seeing the bottle. So, as a safeguard against indecent behaviour, we only allow bottles picked up from our counters to be taken in,? says Subhasis Ganguly, general manger, INOX, City Centre.

 ?We have a uniform policy across all multiplexes in the country of not allowing outside water, but we do make exceptions for pregnant women and senior citizens,? adds Vikas Syal, general manger, INOX, Forum. ?Also, we have adequate provisions inside. People can buy water from the Refuel counters. If somebody is not willing to buy it, we have filtered water that can be consumed in plastic glasses.?

 Revenue stream, of course, plays a vital part in the clampdown on food and beverages. ?F amp;B sales is one of the biggest revenue-earners for a multiplex,? admits a spokesperson for 89 Cinemas.

 Going by the rulebook, an auditorium cannot stop people from carrying water in, stress civic officials. ?No auditorium can obtain civic sanction declaring that the public will not be allowed to enter with potable water for personal consumption,? says Aloke Ghosh, a law expert of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. That is something the multiplexes are blind to or blas? about.

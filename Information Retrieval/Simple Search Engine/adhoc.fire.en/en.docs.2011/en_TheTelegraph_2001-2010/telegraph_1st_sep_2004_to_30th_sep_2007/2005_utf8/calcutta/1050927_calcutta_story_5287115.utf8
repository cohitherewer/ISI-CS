The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Six pujas booked for blocking road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Metro on Monday morning did a round-up of some rule-flout pandals

 With a week to go for Mahalaya, the stage is set for a showdown between traffic-stopper pujas and road-rule enforcers.

 The fire services department on Monday booked six puja committees for not abiding by the stipulated norms. 

 The blacklisted organisers: Vivekananda Sporting Club, Simla Sporting Club, Tarun Sporting Club, Youth Recreation Club, Singhi Park and Balak Sangha.

 The complaints were lodged for violation of Section 23 of the Fire Services Act, 1950. All these organisers will have to modify their pandal structures to ensure that not more than 50 per cent of the road is used up. Besides, there should be enough clearance ? at least 12 ft ? for free movement of fire tenders.

 The six puja committees have got provisional no-objection certificates from the fire services department, but following Monday?s rap, they will have to ?mend their ways? to be eligible for the ?final nod?.

 Also, next year, these puja committees will not be provided the provisional no-objection certificate without a spot verification by the fire services department.

 ?We are not trying to clamp down on any puja. But certain guidelines have been framed to ensure there are no mishaps during the festival days and we just want to ensure that puja committees abide by them,? said Gopal Bhattacharya, deputy director of fire services.

 All puja committees will be called for a final review on September 28 by fire minister Pratim Chatterjee.

 Monday?s move follows a joint inspection by senior police and fire officers across northern and central parts of the city. In the south, fire services officers did the rounds by themselves.

 ?Most of these puja organisers had completely encroached upon the roads, leaving no room for any vehicular movement. The warnings were sent out well in advance and so we are not ready to accept any excuse,? said Bibhas Guha, divisional fire service officer of the central zone.

 The rap could also have a direct bearing on rewards. In a bid to ensure greater regulation of recalcitrant puja organisers, the fire services department has decided to interact with various puja award committees to ensure that no pandal violating fire-safety rules is considered for the festive felicitations.

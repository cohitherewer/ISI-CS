 The reward for catching a killer: a daily run around the Maidan and a cut in calorie count. If that sounds hard, Beena?s not complaining. The seven-year-old Labrador is old enough (well over 40 in man years) to know that cracking a case is its own reward.

 One of the pair that makes up the Tracker Dog Squad of the Calcutta Police, Beena helped sleuths solve the murder of 71-year-old Laxmi Narayan Sundaram of Bishop Lefroy Road.

 ?We got her when she was barely two-and-a half months old. Ever since her brilliant performance, we have put her on a new schedule to get the best out of her,? beams Provash Mondal, officer-in-charge, Dog Squad.

 After arriving at the Sundaram murder scene, Beena sniffed out the escape route of the killers, which helped cops track them down. She has also helped sleuths solve two other murder cases, including the gruesome death of Chandra Kant Tiwari of Bow Street in 2002.

 But even ace crime-trackers need to watch their waistline. ?Since Beena has a tendency to gain weight, we will ensure her calorie intake remains between 1,500 and 1,600 per day, while most dogs like her would need between 1,500 and 2,000 calories,? adds Mondal. Breakfast is 500 ml of milk with roti and dinner is meat and rice, with a break on Thursdays for doi-bhaat.

 While the golden girl has taken this is in her stride, she has taken exception to the rain, as it gets in the way of her hour-and-a-half Maidan jaunts. ?Since it was raining, she couldn?t go out on Monday and cried through the morning,? says Kushal Singh, her handler. To compensate, she went for a walk around the Police Training School instead.

 A new training schedule is also being worked out for Beena and her associate, effective mid-July. It will stress on general obedience, specialised detection and endurance, along the lines of the course for dogs at the BSF National Training Academy in Gwalior. This, experts claim, will help Beena and Seema work more efficiently on unusual surfaces or at crime scenes that have been tampered with.

 All Beena has to say is woof.

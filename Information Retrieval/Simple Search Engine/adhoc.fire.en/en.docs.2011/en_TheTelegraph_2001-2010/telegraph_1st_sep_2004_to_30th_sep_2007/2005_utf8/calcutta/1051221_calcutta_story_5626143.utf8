 Bangalore crime casts security net

 OUR BUREAU

 The call centre crime in Bangalore has forced Salt Lake Sector V to take note of the security loopholes and make a concerted move to plug them.

 The things to do placed on the table during a meeting on Tuesday ranged from companies providing a database of drivers and casual workers to improved cop coordination.

 The meeting involved senior district police officials, representatives of 35 IT companies and government officials.

 ?We hold these meetings every month, but the Bangalore incident necessitated this one. We have to ensure that the Bangalore incident is not repeated in Calcutta,? said Bikram Sen, special secretary of the department of information technology.

 Sen, who holds additional charge as managing director of Webel, added: ?The main purpose of Tuesday?s meeting was to find out what kind of administrative assistance was required by the IT/ITES sector.?

 Among the proposals mooted at the meeting were the creation of a database of all transport vehicles and drivers used by the companies and setting up a taxi refusal booth .

 Other points that were debated included a helpline for sexual harassment and increased police patrol in Sector V.

 According to a police official, a database of drivers and casual workers would be prepared on the basis of information provided by IT companies.

 Vehicles carrying the employees will be provided with helpline numbers in case of an emergency.

 ?Night patrol in Sector V will be increased and overall security of the area would be beefed up,? he assured.

 IT companies also demanded setting up of a full-fledged police station in Sector V. At present, a police outpost oversees security in tech hub.

 ?A foolproof security mechanism must be devised and we are helping the IT companies to streamline the security system,? said Vageesh Mishra, inspector-general of police (South Bengal range).

 G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, state IT department, said: ?Since Sector V is set to become an industrial township, coordination with the civic and police administration is vital.?

 Latest lehnga look: Rachana goes glam

 Tollywood actress Rachana Banerjee flaunts a bridal ensemble by designer Chandrani Singh Flora. The Italian crepe lehnga embellished with intricate threadwork, sequins gotah and mirrorwork has been paired with a brocade corset in red and blue. ?Usually women go for cholis with lehngas, but I wanted to give Rachana a very different and glamorous look, so I teamed it with a corset. In fact, corsets are catching on these days, and many of my NRI clients want to wear them with lehngas,? says Chandrani. Picture by Pabitra Das

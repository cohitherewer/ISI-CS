 ?I used to sit at home all day, thinking bad thoughts and wasting my life. I couldn?t even finish Class X. I was bored. Now, I?ve found something I am good at, that I love doing, and I can also earn a living, which is good for my self-confidence,? says Indranil Sengupta. The 30-year-old patient of schizophrenia has learnt fabric painting at the NGO Turning Point, and has sold his works through outlets like Akriti, at City Centre. 

 Mental illness can destroy an individual if not treated. But with a little bit of assistance and guidance, patients can lead fruitful lives as contributing members of society, explains Ishita Sanyal, founder-director of Turning Point. 

 Like Indranil. The resident of Bansdroni is a good quizzer (favourite topics ? country capitals and Mohun Bagan trivia), an avid football fan, an excellent elocutionist, a poet and a music-lover. He rediscovered his talents after years of counselling and medication, and has even made it on TV.

 ?I?m proud of his achievements, but I worry about the future, not knowing what will happen to him after we are gone. How will he look after himself? It is all very uncertain. Maybe if he keeps at the fabric painting, he can perfect it over time and make something of himself,? mother Atasi said. 

 It?s a concern that Kakoli Bera?s mother Bharati shares. Kakoli is very good with her hands, from jute to embroidery, drawing to fabric painting. She even looked after the house, living on her own, when her mother was in hospital with lung problems and thrombosis. ?But I don?t know what will happen later. My son lives abroad, so I can?t even leave Kakoli with him. I don?t know what she will do in future?? Bharati trailed off.

 For now, though, these individuals are making a mark through Turning Point?s Learn And Earn project. Their products were so popular at Akriti, that the Salt Lake store extended the exhibition by a week to next Sunday. 

 Also dropping in at the shop to was Kohinoor Nandy. The 23-year-old does the office work, buying of supplies and other essential tasks, at Turning Point. His mother still isn?t sure of his capabilities ? ?she won?t let me do things at home, even going to the shops? ? but at the NGO, he tirelessly does what is asked of him, including ironing. He is even pursuing a BA degree from South Calcutta Correspondence College.

 ?Support and acceptance is what they need more than anything,? adds Sanyal.

 - ONE MAN?S VINYL DISC COLLECTION WORTHY OF MUSICOLOGY MUSEUM

 The Beatles pressed in Communist Russia and stereophonic at that, or a bootleg of Joan Baez?s first recordings in 1959, featuring collaborations with American male folk artistes like Bill Wood. From RD Burman?s only English offering Pantera to Moheener Ghoraguli?s last-recorded album Drishyaman. Or the only four songs ever recorded by Dinendranath Tagore?

 Kalyan Kamal Roy calls himself a ?listener? and the ardour with which he has pursued his pet passion over the years, has spawned a vinyl disc collection worthy of gracing a musicology museum. A framed poster of the Fab Four adorns the wall of his Anil Roy Road residence next to his painstakingly-assembled listening post, and the 40-year-old even has in his rare collection the skiffle music of Lonnie Donegan, a major inspiration for Lennon-McCartney.

 ?It all started with the German-made Garrard radiogram at home and my grandfather?s old gramophone,? recalls Roy, for whom, the complex acoustic guitar-piano-flute prelude in Debabrata Biswas?s Tora je ja bolish bhai? served as a lullaby when barely a toddler. He took lessons in classical vocals and later lent his voice to Antarmukh?s ?alternative? album Shono. But it was his penchant for pop and rock ?n? roll music that triggered his enviable collection, which has now topped 5,000 records, mother pressings all.

 ?It was Lunchtime Variety on radio that opened the doors to western music sonically for me and ABBA?s Honey Honey in The Best Of ABBA was one of my first impacts and maiden acquisition, much to my late father?s chagrin,? Roy reminisces. While the odd Sachin Dev, Hemanta and Asha kept trickling in, the quest for overseas chords kicked off in earnest once he discovered Free School Street and later Wellington Square.

 Now, his priceless ensemble boasts gems like the lost masterpiece Grape Jam by Moby Grape, Les Paul?s 10-inch LPs, Woodstock Two from the same epic event, as also Dark Side of The Moon ? not by Pink Floyd, but by contemporary outfit Medicine Head. Also finding pride of place on his shelves is Susmit Bose?s Train to Calcutta, ?one of the first indigenous efforts in English music?, an album the singer himself doesn?t possess.

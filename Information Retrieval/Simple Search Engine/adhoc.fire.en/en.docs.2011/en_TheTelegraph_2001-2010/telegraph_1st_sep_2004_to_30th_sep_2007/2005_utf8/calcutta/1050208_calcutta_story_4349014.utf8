 Freedom cash in twin lots

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sum of Rs 22.5 lakh was the price the Jhawar family had to pay for the safe return of Roma.

 Relatives of the Jhawars revealed that the ransom was split into two: Rs 20 lakh was paid to one team and Rs 2.5 lakh to another.

 As soon as Roma?s elder brother Rajesh received the first ransom call around 8.45 am on Friday, their uncle Shankarlal, a resident of Salt Lake?s BA block, started calling up friends and family members to spread the word about the emergency.

 Around 9.30 am, another uncle of Roma?s, a building materials supplier and also a neighbour, arrived at CB 68 and took over the task of networking and raising the ransom amount.

 Around 12.30 pm, the friends of the Jhawars met at Shankarlal?s flat and decided to collectively raise the initial ransom demand of Rs 50 lakh.

 Funds organised, the group then met again in the evening and informed Roma?s father Satya Narayan that the money had been arranged.

 All through this, negotiations were on with the abductors, over Roma?s cell phone. Initially, brother Rajesh was handling the calls but by evening, the elders had taken over.

 Negotiations scaled down the ransom amount to Rs 22.5 lakh ? Rs 20 lakh to be paid at Kankurgachhi and another Rs 2.5 lakh near the Ultadanga railway station.

 Around 3 am, a relative of the Jhawars reached Kankurgachhi in a black Santro with a black bag containing Rs 20 lakh. At around the same time, two others in an Indica reached Ultadanga station and dropped a packet containing Rs 2.5 lakh near a shanty.

 Back at Kankurgachhi, shortly after the Santro arrived, a Maruti Omni pulled up. As planned, the light inside the Santro was switched on to confirm that there was no one else in the car.

 As the relative stepped out with the cash bag, one of the windows of the Omni slid back and Roma peeped out. A man with his face covered in cloth took the bag, before Roma was allowed to proceed to the Santro and be driven away.

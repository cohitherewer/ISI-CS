 21st Century tools to ride retail crest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Organised retail in eastern India is projected to cross the Rs 100-billion mark by 2010, according to a CII-Images study.

 The study report, released at the retail summit on Thursday jointly by state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and New York-based retail anthropologist Paco Underhill, also forecasts a Rs 4,500?crore investment in the pipeline for retail and shopping centre development.

 ?The CII has played an important catalytic role in the retail revolution here, and we are doing our best to keep the momentum going by trying to improve purchasing power,? the minister told the forum.

 He added that West Bengal has sought power from the Centre to amend the Urban Land Ceiling Act ?so that we can control urban growth?.

 At the same time, an alternative model with ?enough greenery and housing for poor? was also being readied, with the proposal already circulated among various ministerial departments.

 The report, East India Retail: 2010 and Beyond, mentioned that retailing in the East constituted Rs 2,20,000 crore of the total private consumption spending in fiscal 2004-05. 

 ?Still, organised retail in east India is at a nascent stage and will take at least three more years to grab a share of even one per cent, powered chiefly by Calcutta,? said Amitabh Taneja, chief, Images Group.

 What could be done to accelerate this evolution? The 53-year-old Underhill, who tracks consumer behaviour across the world and enriches clients like Saks, Fifth Avenue, Starbucks and Adidas with his critical inputs, offered a clutch of ideas for the sizeable audience to chew on.

 ?To grow your business in Calcutta, you need to look for ideas where the money is young, for instance, in Moscow, Mexico City, Dubai or Istanbul. The age of social stratification in retail is over. Now, across all strata, the consumer is well-informed and the sooner you can embrace 21st-Century tools to get closer to your customer, the faster you grow,? Underhill said during his three-part ?performance?.

 From tenant education to controlling the circulation pattern and speed effectively, providing quiet refuge for the elderly to identifying ?guerrilla marketing opportunities? to clutter-free signage (?you don?t want a firehose of information, just a dipstick?), the ?urban geographer? unveiled solutions galore.

 Earlier, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka and Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd supremo Kishore Biyani spoke in one voice, saying the country ?was not ready for FDI in retail? yet.

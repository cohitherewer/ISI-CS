The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 LO-CAL

 Derek O'Brien

 A simple way to bid goodbye to 

 Calcutta, 40 degrees. Kalimpong beckons. This hill station 

 is one of my favourite getaways. It has all the beauty of 

 Darjeeling, without the crowded Mall. Maybe next year, it 

 will be Kurseong. But before that, I will watch Neil OBrien 

 conduct the DI Open Quiz on Saturday, May 28, from 4 pm. 

 Four-member teams, spot registration. See you there.

 The centennial of the Bengal Smoke 

 Nuisance Act, 1905 is being celebrated in Calcutta. The 

 erstwhile British authorities enacted this legislation in 

 anticipation of the completion of the Victoria Memorial 

 in the city, as they realised that smoke pollution would 

 be harmful for the white exteriors of the landmark. It is 

 believed to be the oldest such legislation in Asia, and 

 one of the oldest in the world.

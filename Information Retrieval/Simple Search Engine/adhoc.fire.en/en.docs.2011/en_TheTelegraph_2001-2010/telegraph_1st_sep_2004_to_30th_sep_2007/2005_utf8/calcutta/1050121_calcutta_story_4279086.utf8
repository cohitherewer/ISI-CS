 Inked deal returns blackout duo

 - Tennis, football fans gear for action after ?amicable? end to dues dispute

 Wayne Rooney: Back on beam

 The action?s back, and just in time. On the eve of Sania Mirza?s showdown with Serena Williams in the Australian Open, ESPN STAR Sports returned to over 50 per cent of the cable and satellite homes in the city denied the twin sports beam for close to two months.

 The channels staged a comeback after a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between ESPN STAR Sports and the two multi-system operators (MSOs) on which the beam had been blocked ? Indian Cable Net (formerly RPG Netcom) and Manthan ? owing to a dues dispute.

 The deal was inked in the presence of Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (I) of police (detective department) at Lalbazar. Pandey signed the MoU on behalf of the government as arbitrator.

 ?The matter was amicably resolved between the parties,? said Pandey on Thursday evening, adding that according to the agreement, all pending payments will be made by March.

 ?We signed a fresh contract with the two MSOs and sorted out the differences,? an ESPN STAR Sports spokesperson said from Delhi, refusing to divulge the terms and conditions of the MoU.

 According to sources, however, Indian Cable Net and Manthan have made payments of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 30 lakh, respectively, to the broadcaster to settle outstanding disputes. The rest will be cleared in the next two months.

 The MoU, reportedly, also contains terms at which the broadcaster would be paid for the next two months ? both price and subscriber base ? by the two MSOs.

 Hopes are now pinned on the cable census being completed by the state government for payment break-up after March. The census, the first of the kind in the country, aims to determine the number of cable homes in the city and curb under-declaration.

 If tennis fans will be served well with the return of the Australian Open action, football fans can kick off with the Arsenal-Manchester United clash on February 1, before moving into the Champions League knockout stages.

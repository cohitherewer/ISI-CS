 The mystique

 What: Tribute to Greta Garbo

 Where: Crown cinema

 When: November 10-17

 Born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson in Sweden, the life of this Viking beauty is shrouded in a veil of intrigue. She worked in a barbershop and then in a department store before making her way to films, first in Stockholm and then in the US. 

 Garbo did Queen Christina in 1933, before giving the performance of her life in Anna Karenina (she got leading man Laurence Olivier fired from the film to make way for former co-star and lover John Gilbert) two years later. Her comic side came forth in the 1939 film Ninotchka. In a tribute to Garbo, all three films are being screened by Cine Central at the International Forum of New Cinema, as part of the Calcutta Film Festival.

 What: J.J. Milteau Quartet blues concert

 Where: Kala Kunj, the Kala Mandir basement

 When: November 8, 7 pm

 Paris-born harmonica virtuoso J.J. Milteau touches down to play some soulful jazz with his breathtaking technique. The harp player who ?rides the blinds of blues, jazz and rock music with innate poetic sharpness? has performed and recorded with famous French singers like Francis Cabrel, Yves Montand, Patricia Kaas, Charles Aznavour?

 Milteau started playing the harmonica after listening to little-known but inspired blues artistes on his travels. Travelling is his passion ? Milteau has toured all over Europe to the US and Canada, African nations, Central American republics, Caribbean Islands and the Dominican Republic. The Calcutta show is presented by The French Association and Lafarge.

Manisha plays wife to Prosenjit, who is a filmmaker and has a love-hate relationship with a child. There?s a rift between the couple over having a child ? while Manisha hankers for a baby, Prosenjit is averse to the idea. And then, her screen hubby starts drifting towards costume designer Raima Sen?

 The birthday

 Where: 20G Park Street

 Stars, scores and songs

 What?s the magic mobile number this November? It?s 8243. Cool wallpapers, latest ringtones, logos, cricket updates and more, all with a simple SMS, courtesy Hey Ya!

 The mobile content providing service has just launched its website, www.heyya.co.in, and on offer is a host of goodies. Yahoo! is partnering Hey Ya! for the service.

 ?So far, users were aware of the content only through print advertisements. Now they can actually sample the wallpapers and ringtones before downloading them. They can also have access to a much larger collection,? said a spokesperson for Hey Ya!

 Specials include an array of gorgeous Malaika Arora wallpapers, ringtones of the latest singing sensation Amit Sana as well as evergreen hits of Kishore Kumar, jokes to tickle your funny bone and the day?s horoscope.

 The ringtones are further spread across categories like mono tones, polyphonic tones and true tones to offer something to every handset.

 Cricket enthusiasts should find the score updates and schedules useful. Simply send an SMS with the word ?bat? followed by the country code (?ind? for India) and receive the score. For a schedule of matches to be played in the next one week, punch in ?bat sch?.

 A reference section comes in handy for a quick look at which keyword to use when ? ?img? for logo, ?hwall? for wallpaper, ?bat? for cricket, ?play? for java games? Besides these, quiz, jumbled word contest and tambola are scheduled to start soon.

 There are also plans to launch a Hey Ya! beauty contest for men. Contestants can send in photographs and the winner would be decided through SMS votes. Hey Ya!?s Mobiley Pujo contest had seen over 400 applications from pandals in and around the city. Of these 300 were selected and mobile users could download the image of the idol by SMSing to 8243.

 Gun-toting writers, turf war and blood bath ? Page 4 transports the cultural world of intellectuals to the den of dons. Conceived and directed by Bratya Basu for Lok Krishti, Page 4 is a strange world where the mad scramble for awards and appreciation mirrors the gang rivalry and power struggle of the mafia. Here, shootouts among writers are a common occurrence.

 ?It?s a reflection of my existential crisis. The circle I mingle in is very suffocating. The way the awards are given and the way one is cornered, I feel our world resembles the way the mafia operates. I think everyone faces such problems and I am a part of it,? says Basu, back to stage direction after his feature film Teesta.

 ?In terms of characterisation, I have not attacked anyone deliberately or ?undeliberately?. The closest likeness to the character of the don in the play could be me. Because like him I do several things together ? I stage plays, make films and write as well. As a theatre director and actor, I feel that people kill each other?s humanity when they engage in a verbal battle,? he adds.

 The title of the production was inspired by Madhur Bhandarkar?s Page 3. ?If the film revealed the underbelly of the glamour world, I decided to weave the play around the cultural world, and hence the name Page 4,? says Basu. ?Personally, I feel it?s a much more strong political statement than Sateroi July.?

 Page 4 also marks his return to acting after a gap of four years ? the last time he was on stage was for the play Chatushkon. ?I didn?t want to act this time, but everybody insisted that I would suit the role,? he says, having directed yet another play for an ensemble other than his own group Ganakrishti.

 ?Working with Ganakrishti, I was cocooned in a comfort zone which I wanted to break. At Lok Krishti, I got very good co-operation from all the members. Together we were able to create a different energy level and a great deal of discipline,? says Basu.

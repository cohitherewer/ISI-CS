The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Revival strategy for day clinic

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 After having tasted success with its mega-hospital venture on Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital is on an expansion mode. 

 The target is to revive Apollo Gleneagles Clinic, in Gariahat, with another multi-crore project.

 Known as Apollo Duncans in the 90s, the clinic ? a daycare centre ? hardly had any patient when Gleneagles replaced the Duncans group and started the revival project a few years back.

 On Saturday, Apollo Gleneagles announced that it was pumping in another Rs 10 crore for the centre?s expansion.

 Efforts are on to acquire more land for the project. Besides, more storeys will be added to the building.

 ?Of late, the centre has been doing very well. We have assessed the situation and decided to pump in at least Rs 10 crore and turn it into a multi-speciality centre, offering all kinds of treatment,? said V. Satyanaryana Reddy, chief executive officer of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in Calcutta.

 That is not all. The clinic, unlike all the other daycare centres, will also have facilities for patients to stay at night after ?moderate to critical surgeries?. 

 Reddy stressed: ?In every sense, it will be a mini-hospital and the treatment will be comparable with the best in the city.?

 The hospital has recently started a full-fledged urology clinic, where ?difficult surgeries? of the prostrate gland and kidney stone, and various other urological procedures are being conducted.

 ?The urology unit has been very successful. In a few weeks since it started, we have performed around 100 procedures. People seem to be happy with the facilities at the unit,? said uro-surgeon Amit Ghose, who recently joined the Gariahat clinic. 

 ?We will have a state-of-the-art cardiac care unit, where angiogram and other treatment facilities will be available at a very affordable cost,? said Reddy. Around 100 patients on an average visit the clinic daily.

 Apart from surgeries of the gall bladder, appendix, rectal and other laparoscopic procedures, the authorities have decided to open diagnostic and treatment facilities in cardiology, ENT and ophthalmology in the near future.

 ?We have been carrying out a lot of surgical procedures of late and once we have more equipment, things will be even better,? added surgeon B. Ramana.

 Other than surgeries, Ghose also has plans to start a kidney and a prostrate club for patients to share their views about the diseases.

 ?We have seen that awareness on the preventive aspects can check many diseases, and with the patients sharing their experiences, there is bound to be a positive impact,? Ghose added.

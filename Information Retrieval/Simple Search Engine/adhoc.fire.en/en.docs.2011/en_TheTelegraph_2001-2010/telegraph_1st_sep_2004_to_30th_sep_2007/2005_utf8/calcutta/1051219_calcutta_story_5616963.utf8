 Copper network must for broadband

 Sourish Misra: Some cable operators are offering broadband for Re 1 per hour. Is that really possible? Can I get broadband through my mobile phone?

 The cable operators are duping people. Broadband starts from 256 kilo bits per second (kbps), while the cable operators do not offer more than 144 kbps.

 Internet access through mobile phones might be possible, but you cannot have broadband on your cell phone. Broadband requires copper loop. No telephone operator, even those offering 3G services, can provide you broadband without copper loop infrastructure. That is why I will advise you not to surrender your BSNL landline connection.

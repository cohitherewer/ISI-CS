The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Toon treat with incredible effect

Plan a Party

 Zeeshan Jawed chalks out a theme bash based 

on the latest Hollywood animation flick

 Do

 Get hold of loads of Incredibles toys, masks 

and T-shirts 

 Get a tattoo artiste to paint characters from the film on the kids 

arms and faces

 Plan a light menu, mostly snacks 

Don't

 Stick to the sound track from the movie. 

The music should be peppy enough to drag the little feet to the dance floor

The Indian animation film industry might still be 

taking baby steps, but the success stories of Hollywood ventures like Finding 

Nemo and Shark Tale have proved that animated adventures are a big 

draw if they can tickle the funny bone and/or create a heroic halo.

The latest craze amongst the kids happens to be The 

Incredibles, which has been in the news for various reasons. Shah Rukh Khan 

(undoubtedly the Mr Incredible of Bollywood) and son Aryan have lent voice to 

Hum Hain Lajawab, the Hindi version.

The Incredibles, of course, has also been nominated 

for the Oscars in the best film category alongside movies like Sideways, 

Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator.

So, before the winter vacations give over, it could 

be a great idea to throw an incredible party for your kids and their friends.

Goodies galore

Theme parties without the appropriate goodies can 

be a dull affair. To get the flavour right, comb every toyshop if need be. The 

movie is still on the big screen in town and shops are stocking The Incredibles 

merchandise. Planet Toys in Forum and The Enclave is witnessing a surge in 

demand for The Incredibles toys.

?Theme toys are always swift-moving. Whether Spiderman 

or Pokemon, Harry Potter or Nemo, we have registered brisk sales every time the 

movie version has been released. Incredibles is definitely the flavour 

of this season. And the goodies are priced to suit the budget buyer,? says Mayur 

Kumar Agarwal of Planet Toys.

Instruct all the kids to come dressed in T-shirts 

with characters from The Incredibles printed on them. Decorate the house 

with Bob Parr, Helen Parr, Dash, Frozone and Syndrome. Hire a tattoo artiste and 

get the characters from the movie to adorn the kid army?s arms.

Distribute flying discs amongst the kids. The ones 

at Planet Toys have colourful characters from the movie painted on them. When 

it?s time to call it a day and the kids are on their way back home, hand over 

movie posters and pencil toppers. The Incredibles merchandise is priced 

between Rs 35 and Rs 1,200.

Light bite

Fun and food ? in that order ? are the two things 

kids want from a party. Combine food with fun and serve in plates, bowls and glasses 

that have the colourful film characters printed on them. 

Stick to a light bite. Chips, noodles, soups, mini 

pizzas, grilled sandwiches and burgers won?t be a bad idea. Have masala cola, 

iced-tea and cold coffee to wash it down.

Tune talk

The sound track of The Incredibles is available 

in almost every music store in town. But it is doubtful how far it can go to bring 

the kids to the dance floor. The idea, after all, is to get the kids to groove.

?If it is a theme party for kids, the music has to 

be really commercial. They love nothing more than dancing, so some hip-hop music 

is a must,? says DJ Girish.

so, rewind to the Nineties and dig out some runaway 

hits from that decade. We all moved to Macarena and Barbie Girl. 

And do not forget to distribute The Incredibles masks before they all hit 

the dance floor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?They didn?t feel my need for 14 years?

Making a comeback at 86, music legend NAUSHAD 

embarks on his second innings with Taj Mahal. He tells Pratim D. Gupta 

why he chose to go into hibernation and what separates yesterdays melody 

from todays madness

Before Taj Mahal, when was the last time 

you gave music to a Hindi film?

It?s been 14 years. Teri Payal Mere Geet (Govinda, 

Meenakshi Seshadri) was the last film I scored the music for. There was Guddu 

(Shah Rukh Khan, Manisha Koirala) before that. I have, of course, been involved 

with the remastering of the Mughal-e-Azam soundtrack.

Why this conscious distancing from Bollywood music?

Mere vichaar alag hain. Unke alag hain. 

I didn?t like the projects that were being offered to me. Picturein bahut 

aati thi lekin main nahin karta tha. The youngsters are into something completely 

different these days. But it?s also a fact that they are watching what they are 

being made to watch, hearing what they are being made to hear. Nanga dance, 

daaku? yehi sab to 14 saal se ho raha hai? And all the children 

are growing up watching all this all the time. 

But didn?t you feel frustrated at not being able 

to produce music all these years?

Never. Main likhta raha. I have been writing 

all this while. One of my books also got published in London. As far as money 

is concerned, mujhe rupaiya thodi khana hai, do roti khana hai sirf. 

Also, I don?t think people felt my need anymore.

According to you what is plaguing the film and 

music industry?

The new generation, including the film-makers, has 

no clue about our history and culture. Ask the youngsters about something traditional 

and they wouldn?t know anything about it. 

Kumbh ka mela unhein pata nahin, Benaras ka 

mandir unhein pata nahin, saawan ka mela unhein pata nahin? They don?t 

know enough.

What made you change your stand and agree to do 

Taj Mahal?

It is an interesting film about the lives of Noor 

Jehan?s sons. Also, the producers of Taj Mahal were after me right from 

the start. I had refused initially but they convinced me saying that only I could 

do justice to the music for the film. So in the end, un logon ki baat rakhne 

ke liye I decided to do the music for Taj Mahal.

Why do you think both the film and the music of 

Mughal-e-Azam worked even after 54 years?

Hamare music ki buniyaad pe jo gaane bane 

hain, woh tab bhi jaise sunai dete the, aaj bhi waise sunai dete 

hain. Ragas like Bhairavi and Darbari sound the same irrespective of the year 

it is being heard. They don?t change with time. So the songs based on these simple 

ragas would appeal to everyone all the time. 

Even for Taj Mahal, a classical-based song 

like Mumtaz tujhe dekha jab Taj Mahal dekha is being loved by the young 

and the old. Raga agar dilchasp ho, to ek apnapan rehta hai and 

that?s why it works.

 You have got Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty to sing for 

Taj Mahal?

Yes, and he is a very good singer. More than being 

a very good singer, he also has a very good temperament. Despite being such a 

big singer, he would always bow down while meeting someone. That?s why God?s blessings 

are always with him. His daughter (Kaushiki) too is a very good singer. I remember 

I was the first to introduce her on stage. I just hope that both father and daughter 

continue to sing and give us more beautiful songs in the future.

Will Taj Mahal be just a one-off assignment 

for you or will this be the starting point for another sparkling innings in film 

music?

It all depends on the kind of projects that are offered 

to me after this (Taj Mahal). If I like some film idea, main zaroor 

karoonga ? I would definitely do it. But the film has to be a social or a 

love story.

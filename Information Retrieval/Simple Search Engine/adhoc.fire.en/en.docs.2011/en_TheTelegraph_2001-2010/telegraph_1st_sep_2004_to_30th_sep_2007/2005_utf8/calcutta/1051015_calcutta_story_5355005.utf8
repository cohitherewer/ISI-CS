The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For cabbies, crash course in civility

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Refusals and harassment of passengers ? a taxi ride in the city has been synonymous with these two for ages. Now, an attempt is being made for hassle-free journeys.

 Bengal Taxi Association (BTA) and Calcutta Metropolitan Taxi Drivers? Association are working on a plan to train cabbies on how to behave with passengers.

 ?We will teach drivers the basics of good behaviour. Passengers should not feel they are being harassed or duped,? said BTA general secretary Bimal Guha. 

 ?Drivers must not be harsh. When a passenger boards a taxi, the driver should welcome him. When he gets down, the driver must ensure he is not leaving behind anything. These small gestures will help improve the relation between drivers and passengers,? he added.

 More than 30,000 drivers will be enrolled in the multi-phased training, which kicks off after Diwali. 

 The public vehicles department (PVD) is flooded with complaints from taxi passengers daily. ?The complaints range from refusal and rash driving to harassment of passengers by drivers. In many cases, we take steps, like cancelling the licence or imposing a fine on the errant driver,? said H. Mohan, PVD director.

 He expressed the hope that the training would be ?very effective?, but stressed that the sessions must be regular.

 According to police, most of the complaints come from the two terminal stations ? Howrah and Sealdah ? and the airport. ?Passengers from outside are often taken for a ride by drivers,? an Government Railway Police officer said.

 The government, too, feels the behaviour of a section of taxi drivers creates a negative image of Calcutta among outsiders.

 ?With the reputation of the city and the state changing fast because of the IT boom, it?s time the drivers changed their behaviour. They must undergo training on how to behave and must also know the city thoroughly,? said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary in the state IT department. 

 ?The taxi drivers are the first contacts in the city for outsiders. The training for drivers will help boost Calcutta?s credibility,? said V.V. Babu, chairman, CII?s IT committee for eastern region.

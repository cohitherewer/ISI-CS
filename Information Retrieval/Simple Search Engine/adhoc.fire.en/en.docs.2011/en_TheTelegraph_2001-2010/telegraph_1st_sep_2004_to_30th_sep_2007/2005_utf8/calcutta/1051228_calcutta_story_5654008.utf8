 You share your birthday with...

 Ratan Tata 

 You have the spark in you that motivates people. You are never scared of challenges or hard work. You maintain high standards and have a fine eye for detail. Your live-and-let-live policy keeps you from consciously harming others. You need a big share of luxury to work at your best. You are averse to interference and like to work independently. ? Kusum Bhandari

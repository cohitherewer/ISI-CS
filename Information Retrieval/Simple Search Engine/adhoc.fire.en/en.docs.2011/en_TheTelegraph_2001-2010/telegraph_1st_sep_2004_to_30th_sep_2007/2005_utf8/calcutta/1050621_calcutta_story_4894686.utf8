 Tatas seek cheaper land for hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Tata group wants to keep its commitment of building a state-of-the-art cancer hospital in Calcutta. 

 But the future of the project depends on whether or not the government can subsidise the land at Rajarhat.

 Tata Memorial Trust officials, who met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday evening, have selected a New Town site for the project.

 ?The rate at Rajarhat is Rs 2 crore per acre. The Tata officials sought a concessional rate. The chief minister has agreed to look into the request,? said a senior state government official, who was present at Monday?s meeting. 

 Tata Memorial Trust has sought a 20-acre plot for a 150-bed hospital and a cancer research centre. 

 The first phase of the project, which involves the hospital, will require an investment of Rs 75 crore. An outpatients? department facility, a research centre and a nursing school will come up on the same campus at a later stage.

 After Apollo Gleneagles, the Tata group will be the second such big healthcare group to invest in Bengal, if things work out according to plan.

 Around 60,000 new cancer cases are reported in Bengal every year, with Calcutta accounting for 5,000. 

 According to city experts, the most common cancers are of the breast, lung, head and neck and lung, and the cervix.

 ?The chief minister has promised us that land will be allotted in 10 days? time,? said R.K. Krishna Kumar, director, Tata Sons Limited, at Writers? Buildings. 

 Kumar, along with the director of Tata Memorial Centre, Ketayun A. Dinshaw, flew down from Mumbai to meet Bhattacharjee and make a presentation to him. 

 Chief secretary Ashok Gupta, health secretary Kalyan Bagchi and other state government officials also attended. 

 ?We will be back in 15 days with a blueprint of the project,? said Kumar. 

 On his visit to Calcutta last year, Ratan Tata had promised the chief minister that he would build a state-of-the-art cancer hospital in the city.

 According to officials of the chief minister?s secretariat, the Tata authorities have been in touch with Bhattacharjee?s government. 

 ?They were shown three or four sites before they selected Rajarhat. The project depends on whether they can wrest the land at a concessional price,? the official added.

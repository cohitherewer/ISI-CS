 It's Your Birthday So...

 Emotional and artistic, you?re sure to rise and shine. You?ll excel in any field, though you?d prefer to avoid very strenuous work. You aren?t afraid of slogging, provided your efforts are appreciated and compensated. You speak with conviction, but often overlook the consequences. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya?s stand on heritage is just the opposite of predecessor Subrata Mukherjee?s.

 In March 2001, Mukherjee had said concern for ?heritage-feritage? was a luxury Calcutta could ill afford. But mayor Bhattacharya thinks ?preservation of heritage structures is one of the primary duties of the civic authorities in a civilised society?.

 According to him, only a real estate broker can raise his voice against heritage preservation, fearing a shrinkage in the availability of land.

 The mayor, however, pointed out that running a campaign and issuing notices to the owners of heritage structures are not enough for preserving the city?s varied past. 

 ?We have to create funds for protecting the structures. I will soon take up the matter with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.?

 The mayor argued that preservation was not just the responsibility of the civic authorities ? the state government and the Centre, too, should pitch in with funds, as a heritage structure is the property of the entire country.

 He also rooted for alternative avenues to raise funds, such as imposition of heritage cess on the sales of liquor and cigarettes, food bills in upmarket eateries and long-distance railway tickets.

 The city has more than 1,300 heritage structures of various categories and quite a few are in a bad shape, said chief municipal architect and town planner Anindya Karforma.

 Meanwhile, a seven-year-old wait for the restoration of a 150-year-old building, where the country?s first currency note was printed, has ended. 

 Restoration work of Currency Building, for which the heritage committee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is looking for an old photograph or the construction plan, has been undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India.

 The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which was in charge of the structure, wanted to pull it down and build a multi-storeyed office building in its place. 

 The contractor engaged by the department had demolished the massive central dome and skinned the plaster near the main entrance, when an expos? serialised in The Telegraph forced the civic authorities to lodge an FIR against the demolition.

 Though timely intervention by the CMC had saved the landmark edifice at 1, BBD Bag (East) from destruction, conservation was delayed for a considerable period because of a legal battle and unwillingness on the part of the CPWD, a civic official said.

 After dilly-dallying for over seven years, the CPWD has finally agreed to engage a consultant for restoring the building. 

 Former Governor Viren J. Shah and former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha both had expressed ?deep concern? over the deplorable condition of the mammoth building and had called for ?immediate intervention? for its preservation.

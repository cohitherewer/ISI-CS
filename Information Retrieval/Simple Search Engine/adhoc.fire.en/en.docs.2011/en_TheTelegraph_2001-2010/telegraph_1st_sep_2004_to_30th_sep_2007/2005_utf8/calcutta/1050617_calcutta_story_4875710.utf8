 Matrix, a signature brand of LOreal, was launched in the city at a hair show on Thursday evening. 

 A two-hour hair transformation took place on half-a-dozen models to introduce the range of 30 hair colours that the brand has brought to Calcutta.

 From natural blends for the conservative to reflects for the wacky and hi-tones for the wild, the colour palette in the new range shifts focus from subdued browns to bright reds.

 This is a national launch of the product and Calcutta, with its growing awareness, is a large market for hair-care products and colour, explained Melroy Dickson, education manager for the brand.

 The line will be available through top hair salons in the city. We are educating hairstylists about the product line and they should be able to use these on customers soon, he added.

 While the older clientele is expected to go for highlights in softer shades, the younger lot could opt for chunky colouring with a number of vibrant hues on offer.

 The 30 colours introduced here are quite different from what is available in the US, where the label has a stronghold. We had to bring colours that would suit the Indian skin tone and tastes, revealed the manager.

 As Habibs hairstylist Pankaj Killa pointed out, the products cost at least 30 per cent less than rival brands, and have similar effects.

 When we came here seven years ago, most women didnt want any style other than a bun or a braid. This awareness and willingness to experiment is a giant leap forward, felt Dickson.

 Besides the colour, Biolage Therapies, a hair-care range that complements the dyes, was also launched. 

 FIFA fare

 While the victory of Argentina over Tunisia may have been a predictable affair, the party which took place at Prince of Cal, where the match was telecast live, packed in a few punches.

 The lounge bar at Souravs hosted the event, organised by ESPN to create awareness about the ongoing FIFA Confederations Cup 2005 in Germany.

 West Bengal, Kerala and Goa are three states where soccer is a rage. We are trying to promote soccer in these territories, said a spokesperson for the channel.

 Indian team skipper Bhaichung Bhutia was the special invitee for the evening, and doubled as quizmaster, asking questions related to the football event.

 After the match, spectators left their cosy couches to make their way to the dance floor, where the DJ kept them busy with tracks like Kajrare, Teri toh, Woh lamhe and Dhol vajda.

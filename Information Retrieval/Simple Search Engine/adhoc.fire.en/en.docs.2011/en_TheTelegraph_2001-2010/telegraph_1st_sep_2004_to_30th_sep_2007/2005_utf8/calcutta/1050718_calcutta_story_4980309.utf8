 Admission-time test in English for parents

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Want your child to be taught in English? If the answer is yes, parents conversant only in vernacular tongues better go back to school themselves.

 Guardians unable to read, write or comprehend English are bringing down school standards and are posing a disciplinary challenge, according to a number of city schools.

 The result: admission procedures will shift the focus from young children to their parents.

 At the extreme end, parents? lack of English literacy can cause severe problems, claim some city schools. 

 Like when Rakesh?s (name changed) parents didn?t show up to meet his school principal even after a note was sent home through the son.

 The English-medium school authorities called home. It turned out that the Class VII student?s middle-aged businessman father cannot read or write English. The 13-year-old had no trouble translating ? and transforming ? the note?s contents. ?Your son is doing very well. We are happy with his performance,? was his version.

 So now, city schools and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination are gearing up to address the issue from the application stage. 

 Admission procedures at the kindergarten level will be restructured to reject applications of students if neither of the parents have basic knowledge of English.

 ?It was never a criterion for parents to know English in order to admit their wards in our school. But after noticing incidents of children fooling parents, we have made it compulsory for at least one of the parents to have a basic understanding of English. Either the father or the mother must at least know how to read and write,? said the principal of Rakesh?s school.

 Rakesh was granted the admission in kindergarten through a formal admission test, in which he had fared well. But, his parents? aptitude in English was not taken into consideration at all.

 Currently, young children seeking admission are put through rigorous tests. They are asked to spell words, identify letters and numbers. Now, physical fitness and mental alertness will be the main criteria, while parents will have to prove their mettle.

Memories and magic moments

 I remember watching Utpal Dutt?s Manusher Adhikar for the first time at Minerva theatre in the mid-Sixties. I wasn?t married then and my in-laws had taken me to see the play. Even till this day, the play remains fresh in my mind, be it the acting or the quality of the production itself. 

 The other unforgettable play I saw around the same time was Chowringhee, a commercial production by film actor Bikash Bhattacharya. Ajitesh Bandopadhyay?s Paap Punya, which I had seen at Academy of Fine Arts, also had a profound influence. 

 Quite a few plays of Habib Tanvir have had a similar effect on me. I would wonder if one could ever put up a production matching up to Tanvir?s Mrichchhakatika.

 My memories of the first play that had a lasting impact was Theatre Guild?s Uttorer Balcony. Written by Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, the play was staged under my father?s (stage veteran Shyamal Sen) direction. 

 I read the play much later and realised that the production was way ahead of its times. Another of my father?s productions, Thana Theke Ashchhi, also created a deep impression. This production featured Ajitesh Bandopadhyay, who would often take me to watch plays, and Tripti Mitra. Watching them as they rehearsed in our home was quite an experience. 

 I also need to mention several other performances that have inspired me to a great extent... Ajitesh Bandopadhyay in a solo act in Nana Ronger Dinguli, Chetana?s Jagannath, Sambhu Mitra in Galileo, Theatre Workshop?s Sohaik Gelo Juddhe, Ashok Mukhopadhyay?s Bela Abelar Galpo, Chupkatha?s Janmadin, Rangakarmee?s Lok Katha, Ramaprasad Banik?s Paakhi, Goutam Halder in Meghnad Bodh Kabya and Bashonabrikhyamule under Chandan Sen?s direction.

 Long ago, I had seen a Russian production, an adaptation of a Chekhov play, and was bowled over by the way it used space. That was around 1989, and the play turned out to be very inspirational. I used to watch the productions of Ajitesh Bandopadhyay, which nurtured the creative mind. 

 The fact that I watched Utpal Dutt at work and also got to act in one or two of his productions left a deep impact. His Manusher Adhikar was a particularly great learning experience. One could learn how to build up a play.

In Germany, several opera houses have now been turned 

into theatres which is why their productions have a deep stage to work on. Working 

on a flat space back here really irritates me.

Bratya Basu, Ganakrishti

 Nilam Nilam, a production by theatre group Gandhar, had haunted me for a long time. I was in Class XI when I saw this adaptation of Arthur Miller?s Price at Academy of Fine Arts. The story revolved around two brothers and their bond with their father but the relationship hinged on the economic aspect. 

 I now feel the structure was a bit weak but it has stayed on with me and even exerts a sort of unconscious influence on my playwriting.

Dolly Basu, Chupkatha

 It?s very difficult to mention just a few productions, but Nilam Nilam, directed by Asit Mukhopadhyay, had a tremendous impact on me ? in terms of the content and the naturalistic style of acting.

 Later, Chupkatha?s Dui Tarango helped me evolve both as an actress and a director. This was my first directorial work where I directed myself and hence was very challenging. Akarik, too, is a landmark in my life as I played a middle-aged Bengali mother at a time when I couldn?t speak the language very well. Later, working on Janmadin which centred around Hellen Keller turned out to be very emotionally enriching. 

 Though I missed out on the golden era of Bengali theatre, I remember watching Sambhuda?s Raja Oedipus which left a lasting impression.

 Suman Mukhopadhyay, Tritiyo Sutra

 In terms of subject and narrative structure, Jagannath, directed by my father (Arun Mukhopadhyay), had a tremendous impact. The way the production broke the barriers of language and created a new idiom was very refreshing and novel. Weaving in political messages, Jagannath showed rare artistry. 

 Later, I was also hugely impressed by Bibhas Chakraborty?s Madhab Malanchi Koinya, particularly by the way a ballad was adapted on stage. I was also heavily influenced by German performer Pina Bausch?s dance theatre.

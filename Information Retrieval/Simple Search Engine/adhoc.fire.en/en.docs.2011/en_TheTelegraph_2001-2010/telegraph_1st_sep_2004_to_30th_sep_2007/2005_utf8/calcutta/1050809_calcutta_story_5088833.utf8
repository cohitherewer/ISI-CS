 Civic revenue drop hints at laxity

 The revenue earning of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in the first four months of the current fiscal has dropped sharply.

 While the average earning per quarter during Subrata Mukherjee?s tenure had been Rs 55 crore, the April-July period has yielded just Rs 38 crore.

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som recently held a meeting with the controlling officers in the assessment and revenue department to find ways to boost revenue before the Pujas.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said: ?The figures for overall financial soundness of the CMC publicised by my predecessor five months ago was inflated. We must harness other avenues for the creation of resources without imposing extra burden on the middle class.?

 A senior revenue official pointed out that after the second waiver-of-interest scheme, the failure on the part of the new civic board to chase the defaulters with the threat of punitive action sent the wrong message to the house-owners who are habitual defaulters.

 The political changeover at the board thwarted former mayor Mukherjee?s plans to take exemplary action against defaulters who continued to be indifferent to the opportunity to clear their dues.

 ?I am not against taking harsh steps against the defaulters, but my first target will be to attach their vacant plots as it will help generate more open space for the common people,? mayor Bhattacharya said.

 The CMC had collected Rs 130 crore and Rs 150 crore from the tax-payers through the first and second waiver-of-interest schemes, respectively. The increase in collection in the second scheme was the outcome of Subrata Mukherjee?s move to attach landed properties of some of the defaulters who had not responded to the scheme. 

 Besides, in 2003-2004, the municipal commissioner snapped water lines to 48 commercial establishments when they failed to cough up their outstanding water tax. 

 Soon, more than 4,500 out of the 4,800 defaulters paid up and the collection totalled to Rs 10 crore.

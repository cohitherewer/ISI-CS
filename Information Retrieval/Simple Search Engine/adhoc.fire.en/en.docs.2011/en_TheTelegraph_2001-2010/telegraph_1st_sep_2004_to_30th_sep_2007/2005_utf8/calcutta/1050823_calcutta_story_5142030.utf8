 Clear clutter for cash flow

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 The south-east sector of a house is associated with wealth and hence this area should be kept clutter-free for the cosmic energy to flow freely. This area should be energised with paintings or pictures of a river with sailing boats and the horizon. Fresh green plants and mirrors also help enhance cash flow

Q: I am a 55-year-old man, financially disturbed at present. I had earned a lot when I was young, but all my money was used up helping needy relatives and friends. Now when I need money to get my children married off, nobody wants to return my favours. Could Feng Shui help me in any way?

 THE SOLUTION: The south-east sector of the house is associated with wealth. If this area is unduly cluttered, then the flowing cosmic energy gets stuck and stagnates in this corner, thus restricting the in-flow of cash. 

 Clear the clutter and create space so that this area can breathe with fresh energy. Then energise it with healthy green plants and a large mirror. Open your vistas with pictures of pretty rivers with sailing boats and horizons. 

 Create a cash corner in the south-east of your bedroom that has wealth-related items like bank deposit receipts, financial documents and cash. 

 Write an affirmative note on a green piece of paper that you have received your money back from your relatives and friends. Do not forget to specify their names and place it in a green envelope and keep it in the south-east corner of the bedroom. This works effectively when you write with full conviction and faith and place it here on an auspicious day.

 Wall woes

 Q: Earlier, our main door would open into the living room. But for the sake of privacy we got one wall erected at a distance of five feet from the main door. Now we feel that we enter into a dark passage and are confronted by the facing wall. Please suggest a remedy so that privacy is also maintained and the claustrophobic feeling that we get on entering is also taken care of.

 THE SOLUTION: When the main door opens into a spacious area, the in-flowing cosmic energy magnifies and flows smoothly into the house. When this energy enters a dark passage and is also confronted by a wall, its flow gets restricted, uncomfortable, suffocated and disturbed. 

 In your case you should knock down the upper portion of the wall, so that it does not touch the ceiling. 

 Alternatively, keep the small passage very well lit even during the day and hang a painting of deep woods on the wall so that it suggests depth and reduces the suffocation effect. 

 North bound

 Q: We have a large flat where the room in the north is used by the servants for sleeping during the day. At night they move to their quarters to sleep. Since this room is used by them, nobody takes any interest in it. It is badly cluttered and is mostly used for drying and ironing clothes. I have realised that the northern part of the house is connected with business. I wonder if this is the reason why my husbands business is not doing well? Please suggest ways to make this room more productive.

 THE SOLUTION: You can enjoy this extra room by converting it into an entertainment area. If you place your television set and music system in the north, it will activate this business area. Keep your sofas towards south and west. 

 Paint the room in shades of blue. Alternatively, the northern wall can be painted in blue and the rest in a neutral shade. 

 The upholstery and furnishings, with rugs and artefacts, should also be in hues of blue. Add some nourishing metal element in the room with artefacts made of silver, copper, bronze or brass.

 Duct dilemma

 Q: Unknowingly we bought a house where there is a duct in the centre of the flat. The apartment is designed such that all the four toilets have windows opening into this duct for ventilation. The health of all my family members is deteriorating day by day. Could the duct be the cause of our ailments?

 Ananya Arora

 THE SOLUTION: It is undoubtedly inauspicious to have a duct right in the centre of the flat. This is the most pious area of the house, known as the Tai Chi zone, from where cosmic energy radiates to all the different directions of the house. 

 Moreover, this is the sacred heart of the house that is connected with the health of its occupants. When windows of all the toilets open here, they pollute this holy area. 

 The best solution is to change this flat, otherwise illuminate the duct with strong lights that can be thrown from all windows of the toilets towards the vacuum. The lights will overpower the negative energies circulating here.

 Park Street, once Calcutta?s capital corridor of entertainment, now robbed of much of its old sheen, will come alive with strains of live music again, at least for an evening next month.

 Fete de la Musique, or World Music Day, will be celebrated by Alliance Francaise de Calcutta, in association with The Park, on June 21 with a string of concerts concentrated mostly along Park Street. Launched in 1982 by the French ministry of culture, the festival is held in more than 100 countries every year on June 21, the day of the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere.

 From Flurys to Barista, Trincas to Sourav?s, a myriad mix of saxophone and percussion jazz, urban folk and classic rock, fusion and electronica, will serenade the city music buff, livening up the entire stretch till well past midnight.

 ?The concept of the carnival is that of a free, popular fete open to any participant, amateur or professional, who wants to perform in it. It brings together all styles of music and gives people the opportunity to communicate with each other through the music,? says a spokesperson for the French cultural institute.

 In keeping with the motley mood, Paul Mullick will kick off the celebration at Flurys at 4 pm with his romantic sax, with C. Manuel on the keyboard. 

 The French Association then celebrates French music, ?la chanson francaise?, through songs by students.

 Kesivan Naidoo drums up a pesky percussion beat at the Oxford Bookstore Cha Bar (5 pm) and Anjan Dutt strums his country-blues ballads celebrating the city he lives in and the dreams and failures of common people. Lightside, the young acoustic rock duo of Rahul Guha Roy (vocals, guitars) and John Bose (vocals, guitars, bass) does unplugged versions from Denver to Dylan, as well as contemporary stuff at the Park Street Barista (6.30 pm).

 Usha Uthup goes back to where it all started (Trincas 7.30 pm), Hip-Pocket belts out classic rock covers at The Atrium (7.30 pm), Skinny Alley does its alternative thing at Sourav?s (7 pm) and Krosswindz plays its world rock repertoire at Someplace Else (9 pm). DJ Loopkin from France takes charge of the console at Tantra at 10 pm. East-West fusion band Class Apart and the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra are also part of the Fete de la Musique ensemble.

 ?It?s not as if this clutch of concerts planned over an evening can bring back the glory days of live bands to Park Street. However, what it can realistically do is make people rethink on the concept of dining with live music,? says Nondon Bagchi. He feels if the format succeeds, holding a festival ?spread across three or four days next year would be a good idea?.

 Sashi Puri of Trincas, a pianist and music teacher herself, feels even a single evening of widespread live music can go a long way in resuscitating Park Street. ?Music is a universal language of communication and one of the most pleasurable ways of dining with,? she says. Trincas has been doing its bit to promote upcoming city bands and plans to carry the effort forward.

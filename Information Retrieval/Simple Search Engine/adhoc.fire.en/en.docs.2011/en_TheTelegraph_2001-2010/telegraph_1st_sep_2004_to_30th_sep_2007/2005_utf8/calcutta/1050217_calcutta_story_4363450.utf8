The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Buzz brews over a cuppa

ZEESHAN JAWED

Where are you most likely to find adda ranging from 

King Gyanendra?s coup to Sania Mirza?s glasses (or groundstrokes), from the review 

of Black to the preview of The Rising? If getting into Google is 

not your thing, just head for the nearest coffee-house. From a rendezvous on the 

sly to an intellectual debate, coffee places are all-action addresses these days.

Goodlife sits in on an adda at one such 

popular haunt?

The place

Caffeine (pictures by Rashbehari Das), 133A 

Southern Avenue, Calcutta 29 (near Gol Park)

The flavour

A feeling of freedom and a flavour that?s fine. But 

there is more content besides your cuppa in Caffeine. Home away from home is how 

owner Rajdeep Ghoshal puts it. The familiarity factor also plays a very big part. 

?More than half of my clients know me by my first name. The edibles available 

here might be available elsewhere, but the same hospitality and the comfort level 

are hard to come by,? claims Rajdeep.

The platter

From finger food to fries and soups, a quick bite 

to the main course, there is enough on the platter to satiate everyone?s appetite. 

The fast-food category consists of burgers and sandwiches. The burgers come with 

stuffing of smoked chicken, smoked paneer, mushroom and cheese, or vegetables 

and cheese. They are served with Macaroni salads and French fries. Prices range 

between Rs 50 and Rs 65.

Caffeine has even introduced meals. ?There was a huge 

demand for a wholesome meal in the caf? by those dropping in around noon or after 

8.30 pm. But the meals are very snacky,? says Rajdeep. At Rs 70-Rs 80, there?s 

chicken or vegetarian pasta with bread and chicken or vegetarian curry with rice. 

The sip

Coffee, says a Turkish proverb, should be as dark 

as night and as strong as love. From spicy scent to fruity flavour, the choice 

of brew is quite something. The beverage bouquet consists of hot, warm and cold 

coffee. Caf? Mexicano (coffee garnished with nutmeg and cinnamon and laced with 

chocolate syrup), Viennese Coffee (Caf? au Lait garnished with cinnamon and cocoa), 

Caf? a la Orange (caf? au Lait served with orange crush, orange essence and whipped 

cream), Espresso Macchiato (espresso served with a dash of foamed milk), Caf? 

Au Lait (espresso with milk and topped with foam) and Chocolaccino (a hot chocolate 

coffee shake) are the hot picks. Prices per cup range from Rs 25 to Rs 40. 

The Hot Mocha and Irish Mocha are hits, priced at 

Rs 45. Iced Caf? au Lait, Cold Coffee Milk Shake, Iced Caf? a la Orange, Mega 

Mocha Shake, Caffeine Cooler and Iced Cappuccino are part of the cool offerings. 

There is Lemon and Darjeeling tea, too, priced at Rs 25.

The look 

The entire d?cor of the 38-seater is done in white. 

?Those who come here add colour to the place. Moreover, one should be given a 

chance to interpret the colours according to his or her own mood,? smiles Rajdeep. 

Couples meeting for the first time usually occupy the ground floor, while the 

older ? and bolder ? ones shift to the first floor which has far less distraction.

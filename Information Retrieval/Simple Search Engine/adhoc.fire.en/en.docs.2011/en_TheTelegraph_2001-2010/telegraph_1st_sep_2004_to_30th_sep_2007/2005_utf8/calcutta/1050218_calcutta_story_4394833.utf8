The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Calling all Calcuttans

On December 27, while images of destruction were being 

flashed everywhere, our minds raced back and forth between sadness, helplessness 

against the surging tide and the feeling that we should be more than mere mute 

witnesses. We pledged to do all we could to raise funds for the tsunami victims. 

Thus YuthScape was formed. We believed it was just 

a matter of consolidating our efforts. YuthScape worked for three weeks to bring 

to the city One World, a music concert in aid of tsunami victims, on February 

12, on the La Martiniere for Boys grounds. 

Featuring Shayne Hyrapiet, Insomnia, Fossils, Dhwani, 

Aasma and ex-Viva girl Neha Bhasin, the concert was attended by only a thousand 

people, against an estimated 10,000. 

At first, we were discouraged. Corporates and college 

heads politely invited us only to shrink back at the mention of the tsunami (?How 

does it matter if our contribution at all made a difference or there is more to 

be done. We donated a day?s salary and the sufferers should be more than thankful.?). 

Organisations were interested only if we pooled our 

resources into their funds so that their names would find prominence. Students 

shrugged (?The waves rode down south, why are we getting so worked up??).

On the verge of giving up hope, we got a call from 

past district governor Rotarian Shekhar Mehta, of Rotary Club of Mahanagar, inviting 

us to join his initiative, Together We Will (TWW). He had seen our appeal on the 

Internet. Then began a journey of hope, trust, spirit and the will to be proactive 

in the face of obstacles.

Comprising BP Poddar Foundation, Calcutta Foundation, 

The Art of Living, Silver Springs and Rotary Club of Mahanagar among others, this 

open-ended initiative had already been to the tsunami ravaged areas in the Andamans 

and identified the nature of help required. Joining hands was to ensure the money 

raised reached the affected. 

TWW lent us its support. With people like Shamlu Dudeja 

of Calcutta Foundation, who was instrumental in Steve Waugh endorsing the campaign 

and who scripted all our literature, Rotarian Ramesh Khaitan, who arranged for 

air tickets at half the rates and kept us going through all odds, Rotarian Rajani 

Mukherjee, Bishop P.S.P. Raju, who helped us get the venue, Rotarian Vinod Khaitan, 

Kavita Ajmera, Ritika Poddar, Sandeep and Shashi Nowlakhha, Rotarian Ronaq Gupta, 

Rotarian Anand Sureka, Ankush Khanna of Hawk Security, Jimmy Tangree of 93.5 Red 

FM ? YuthScape could not have asked for more help in times of crisis. 

The most touching part was when, in response to an 

appeal for volunteers in newspapers, strangers came forward. Acquaintances left 

us to grapple with our shortage of manpower. We got calls from elderly people 

willing to volunteer, when youngsters wouldn?t. 

The fundraising was about music uniting the youth 

and their sentiments towards this cause. Here, too, we were in for a rude shock. 

Some local bands haggled over money, while out-station stars Neha Bhasin and Aasma 

accommodated us as much as possible. Neha gave back her token money after the 

event, and came armed with a self-composed tsunami song. Dhwani volunteered to 

perform for free. Insomnia was with us. 

While the Calcutta Municipal Corporation supported 

us, the state ruling party was making an impressive display of its might through 

the Brigade Parade rally, bringing life to a stand still. Many couldn?t make it 

because of the traffic. Actress June addressed the crowd, Barry O?Brien was there. 

We thank TTIS for backing us, Airtel for organising a fundraising initiative 

at such short notice, Red FM and TWW. 

Calcuttans, this relief effort was not just about 

us. It was about you. For an effort to be successful, it needs the support of 

the masses. It is a misconception that too much has been done already. Our aim 

was to build houses, a school and donate bicycles in Hut Bay and adjoining islands. 

For the mostly unresponsive youth, the concert was 

not able to fully realise its goal. We appeal to all you youngsters. We are the 

the future. We can change the world.

Whats on your mind this week 

Thank 

you

I write this little letter to thank three people for 

the absolutely wonderful poems published in Young Metro on February 1. 

It feels good to read such nice thoughts first thing in the morning amidst a heap 

of violence reported daily in newspapers. Your eyes by Arnab Pal, Love 

and loss by Tuli Das and Secret of the wind by Alice Laha. Thanks a 

lot. Way to go!

From the heart

With Valentine?s Day just past, we ponder if this 

is the relationship that could eventually mean everything to us. My advice is 

never to worry about the relationship that you are involved in. Just live your 

life and love will find you. There?s no simple formula to guide you to the perfect 

relationship, the best choices depend on knowing your partner well. If you gifted 

your Valentine with something special, it?s not the price tag but the thought 

behind the gift that matters. Indeed, an imaginative gift could help heal the 

most tender emotional wounds. The answer lies in your heart.

Love amp; money

Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; 

Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers? eyes?

William Shakespeare wrote these words four centuries 

ago. They still remain true. Unfortunately, commercialisation has become the controller. 

Money can buy love. Valentine?s Day has become a day of spending for jingling 

pockets, and a day of dismissal for the empty ones. People don?t seem to value 

the essence of the day anymore. Does it mean that the not-so-well-off are not 

capable of love? We should always remember that without a rich heart, even the 

wealthiest is poor. A show of love through wealth is deceptive. Valentine?s Day 

has become a day when shopkeepers look forward to good business. Love has become 

an image, reflected in the mirror of wealth. It, too, has changed its course to 

commercialism. We show love with gifts now.

Protest path

February 14 has come and gone, another controversial 

day. Every year it has become a ritual for the VHP, Shiv Sena and other radical 

groups to protest against this day. I can?t understand why they suddenly emerge 

from ?nirvana? just before Valentine?s Day. Why don?t they protest the cultural 

pollution throughout the year? When they were in government, they didn?t raise 

their voices against the scurrilous remixes that derogate our old classical songs 

and actors. I also argue against couples who display overt affection in public 

places. Love does not require such obvious physical displays.

Shubhajit Chakraborty,

Say a prayer

Valentine?s Day is a day for love. It has come and 

gone, but we can still pray for the victims of the tsunami disaster. Let?s be 

the Valentine for those who lost everything. Little love from little hearts can 

be bigger than the monster. Think about them and pray for them. They don?t want 

to watch romantic films in multiplexes or have candlelight dinners. They want 

help. Help from you ? Young Metro readers. Let?s go ahead together to rehabilitate 

them in the spirit of St Valentine.

Unknown 

gift

The first day when we were introduced 

we just became friends. 

Then on, we met 

Shared our thoughts and feelings. 

Cared for each other?s sentiments. 

Gave helping hands in need. 

And 

Walked together in every act and deed. 

And, we never got to know 

When and how our friendship 

Turned from 

Good to better and 

From better to best.

Wings of Dria

And in the summons of dust 

I have seen Dria 

Spreading her violet wings 

and circling to her hut on the moon 

Flying over the lonely rooftops of Richard Cory 

And I turned to a painting 

Of the lost sailor, 

as her wings brushed by my curtains 

And I smelt her arms again 

Beyond the compass? 

The blood from the gloves 

Of the dead soldier 

Strikes the keys of the old typewriter 

And it prints Dria?s name 

In the paper creeping out 

Like the hidden flower?. 

So she asks the dark phantom, 

?and then, what is my surname???

 Cop chided for changing doctor name

 JULIUS GOMES AND DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) of Alipore has ticked off a police officer probing a case of an abortion without the mother?s consent for changing the name of an accused doctor in the chargesheet.

 Sub-inspector Biswanath Mondal, attached to Canning police station, was summoned to the court on February 7. 

 He apologised for his ?mistake?, that had prompted the accused doctor?s lawyer to pray for his client to be discharged from the case. 

 Mondal was ordered to rectify the faulty charge-sheet and submit it afresh on February 25, which he did, but the accused doctor did not come that day. 

 Another accused, Pradip Nath, proprietor of the nursing home where the abortion was carried out, was present and accepted his copy of the rectified chargesheet.

 The SDJM, thereafter, ordered Shyamal Ranjan Sarkar, the accused doctor, to appear in court on March 23 and receive his copy of the rectified chargesheet. ?If my client fails to do this, an arrest warrant will be issued in his name,? said lawyer Dipit Basu, representing Sarkar.

 For Anima and Sanjib Ghosh, who lost their twins in 2004, justice is elusive. 

 Sarkar, attached to a private nursing home, was the pregnant Anima?s consulting physician in January 2004. An ultrasonography report, dated January 14, confirmed that she was expecting twins.

 On April 4, 2004, Anima complained to Sarkar of uneasiness and pain in her lower abdomen. The doctor examined her and prescribed medication. On June 1, 2004, Anima returned to the nursing home, because the pain was intolerable. 

 Sarkar ordered another ultrasonography and prescribed more medicines. 

 Under his instructions, she was admitted for delivery on June 3, 2004. According to Sarkar, the ultrasonography report stated that one of the foetuses had expired.

 Anima was wheeled into the operating theatre. Half an hour later, her husband, Sanjib, and other relatives were told that an abortion had to be conducted. 

 The Ghoshes then lodged a first information report with the local police station, and Mondal was given charge of the investigation.

 On January 31, Mondal submitted the chargesheet against Sarkar and Nath, but he had changed Sarkar?s first name from ?Shyamal? to ?Sunil?. Lawyer Basu promptly filed a petition before the court, seeking discharge of his client from the case. The hearings were stalled till the confusion was cleared.

 The accused persons in the case have been charged with Sections 315 (act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

 Folk frolic

 Folk theatre has always been one of the most popular mediums of mass entertainment. Combining an intoxicating concoction of razor-sharp wit, rustic simplicity, bold topicality and brazen frankness ? hallmark of all folk-drama ? Ashvin Gidwanis new comedy, Tamasha Mumbai Ishtyle, promises to offer the audience an evening of infectious mirth and merriment. The story of a childless king and queen of ancient Bharatpur and their endless efforts to have a child, its plot is rich in the usual comic ingredients. Colourful characters like the loyal Pradhanji, a bumbling hawaldar who dreams of becoming a police commissioner, a godman, a deeply spiritual businessman and a US-returned ?doctor?, all add to the madness that ensues. And to top it all, the king becomes pregnant, by mistake! A bright, funny, laugh-riot, the performance is made even more lively with glamorous dancers dancing to folk-fusion music, extravagant costumes, sets and lighting, all making for a truly enjoyable experience. Direction: Bharat Dabholkar.

 Foreign job racket bust

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has busted a racket engaged in luring youths from the city and adjoining areas to Europe with the promise of employment. 

 The candidates were first sent to Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic. From there, they would sneak into neighbouring countries like Italy and look for jobs on the strength of fake documents.

 Three persons have been arrested. The CID believes that more members are at large. The racket was in operation for the past two years. At least 10 youths were sent to Europe.

 ?The victims were forced to pay between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. In addition, Rs 1.35 lakh was demanded for visa work. Since the members even managed to provide the youths with forged government documents needed to obtain trade licences, we have to probe deep to get to the root of the fraud,? claimed Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general (CID Operations).

 Among the three, Anshuman Gupta and Partha Mitra were arrested in Howrah station on Sunday, while they were about to leave for New Delhi by Kalka Mail.

 Acting on a tip-off, a team of officers first confirmed that the duo was on the train and then accosted them in their compartment.

 On the basis of the leads provided by the two, Indranil Mitra was rounded up from Habra. 

 While Gupta is a resident of Ballygunge, Partha and Indranil hail from Gariahat. The three were remanded in police custody for a fortnight. The cops have recovered at least 20 fake passports from Indranil, who is a schoolteacher.

 The youths sent to Europe generally claimed to be representatives of Indian companies ? all fictitious ? seeking to participate in an international trade fair. 

 For the application, the racket would furnish details of an Indian company, including its audit report, export profile and a list of clients. 

 Once the clearance arrived, the candidates would proceed abroad and after the visa expired, tried to slip into neighbouring countries.

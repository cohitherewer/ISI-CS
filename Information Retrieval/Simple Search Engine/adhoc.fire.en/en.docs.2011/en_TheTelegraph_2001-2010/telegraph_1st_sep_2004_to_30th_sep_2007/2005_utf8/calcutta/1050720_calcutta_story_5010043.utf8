The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Minister sets stiff housing target

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In the next 20 years, 2.2 million houses have to be built in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) to accommodate a population increase of about 10 million, housing minister Goutam Deb said in the Assembly on Tuesday. 

 As per the figures, 90,000 residential houses will have to be built every year to put a roof over the head of everyone in the state.

 ?That is a tall order, considering that at present, 15,000 to 16,000 houses are built every year,? the minister added. 

 ?At present, the total population of the CMA is 13.2 million. The projected population for 2025 is 22 million. Right now, the CMA has 3.28 million residential houses. The projected number of houses 20 years later is 5.46 million,? Deb explained. 

 The demand for houses will be the maximum among the middle class, which comprises between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the population. 

 The housing minister said that during the BJP?s tenure, the Centre had insisted that the state governments act as facilitators in housing, and not ?providers?, but the Left Front government in Bengal did not acquiesce.

 The present Union government has still not made its stand on housing clear to the state government, Deb added. ?We cannot build, and neither are we keen on building, 90,000 houses every year. It would be good even if we meet 10 per cent of the target.? 

 Without the government?s intervention, a large section of the population would find it difficult to buy real estate in Calcutta and its suburbs at ?reasonable and affordable prices?, felt the minister.

 ?The government has to see to it that either through easy loans or through some other form of intervention, these people are able to afford houses,? he elaborated.

 ?The price of a sq ft of residential space in Calcutta is much lower than in Delhi or Mumbai. That is because 10-15 per cent of the houses are built by the government, the housing board or government-controlled joint-sector companies,? the minister claimed.

 ?It is due to the state?s intervention that it was possible for a flat near Ruby Hospital, off EM Bypass, to be priced at Rs 62,000 some years ago. You can get a flat, albeit a small one, at New Town for approximately Rs 1 lakh even now. People from the lower income groups and cooperatives can still afford houses in Bengal,? stressed minister Deb.

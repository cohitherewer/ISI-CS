 Networking bonanza

 KAUSHIK GHOSH

 Allied Telesyn, the largest private networking company in the world and one of the five largest networking companies, is consolidating and expanding its presence in the city.

 Following an interface with customers and partners in Calcutta, the US-based company founded by a Japanese in 1987 has rolled out two new programmes.

 The first programme offers buy-back option to customers to phase out old networking technology with new-generation products. 

 Those enrolling for the programme will be offered training and specialised support. The second programme provides incentives to the company?s partners.

 The programmes would also be rolled out in Bhubaneswar and the Northeast.

 ?It is boom time in the east. A lot of companies, including IT companies, are setting up offices in the region,? said Rajesh Sahore, country manager of the company, after the launch.

 ?Even the smallest of them will require networking solutions in one form or the other. We want to be the first mover in the market and capitalise as it expands,? he added. 

 Allied Telesyn provides end-to-end networking solutions, with research and development facilities in nine cities all over the world and manufacturing units in China and Singapore. It also offers security solutions.

 The eastern region was the biggest market for Allied till recently, but it lost out to the other players in the past couple of years. 

 It now wants to recapture lost ground and strengthen its presence.

 ?We don?t do direct business, and operate through distributors. So a lot of people are not aware of our name. We want to change that,? explained Sahore.

 A Calcutta office is on the anvil. The company is headquartered in Mumbai and has offices in Delhi and Bangalore.

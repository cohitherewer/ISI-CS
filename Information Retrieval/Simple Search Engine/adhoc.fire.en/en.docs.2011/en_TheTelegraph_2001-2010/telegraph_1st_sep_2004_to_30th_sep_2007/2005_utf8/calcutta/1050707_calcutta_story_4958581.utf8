The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Transit wish list placed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Assembly standing committee on transport wants work on a number of city projects to start ?as soon as possible? and an early resumption of work on projects that have been lying incomplete.

 These include construction of the Kidderpore flyover (incomplete for the past five years), and adding an arm each to Vidyasagar Setu to link it with Foreshore Road in Howrah, the Park Street flyover for access from Mayo Road and the AJC Bose flyover to connect it with APC Road.

 The committee, in its report submitted to the Assembly on Monday, expressed concern over the delay in beginning or resuming work on these projects, causing inconvenience to commuters.

 The committee has recommended that a vast plot owned by Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), near the Vidyasagar Setu approach, be beautified. It has also asked the transport department to start planning for a flyover at Moulali and a second highroad over Lockgate Road.

 ?Vehicular movement will improve and traffic chaos will lessen a lot if the projects are implemented. The HRBC will have to take effective steps ? tie up with private partners, if needed ? to implement the projects,? said standing committee chairman Sadhan Pande.

 HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee said steps had been taken to resume work for the construction of the Kidderpore flyover.

 Twenty-six clubs from all over the country and abroad, around 500 people in attendance and three days of sports and entertainment ? all in the top clubs of Calcutta.

 The Inter-City Club Sports Carnival, in association with The Telegraph, is set to roll this year from November 11 to 13.

 Nine city clubs ? Calcutta Club, The Bengal Club, The Tollygunge Club, Calcutta Cricket amp; Football Club (CC amp;FC), The Calcutta Swimming Club, Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), The Bengal Rowing Club, The Calcutta Racket Club and The Saturday Club ? would play host.

 We expect participation from clubs in other parts of India, besides those in Bangladesh, Singapore and Malaysia, said Shyamal Mitra, convener of the carnival.

 Events include golf, cricket, tennis, squash, snooker and bridge tournaments as well as entertainment in the evenings. The carnival will conclude at The Saturday Club on November 13.

 Its a great opportunity for visitors to get a feel of club life in Calcutta, offered Dipak Dutta, the first convener of the carnival, held in 1997, primarily at the initiative of Calcutta Club.

 The idea emerged years ago when we thought that no matter what the perception of Calcutta was in other areas, club culture was something we could feel proud of, explained Mitra.

 The 1997 inaugural edition was a small-scale affair with participation from only 15 clubs. After a break, the carnival was revived in 2003, with Dutta in the forefront again. Since then, the event picked up steam and turned into an annual affair. The estimated budget for this years event is Rs 15 lakh. Besides travel, all other expenses of the visitors would be borne by the organisers.

 This is a wonderful forum for reunion and gives us the chance to interact with our counterparts in Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore. But I think its a better idea to take it to other cities as well instead of just rotating the event among the Calcutta clubs, observed Arjun De, president of the principal hosts, The Saturday Club.

 The golf tournament, to be hosted by RCGC on Saturday, will be played in a Stableford format, with participants making up four-member teams. The best three scores will be counted.

 This event provides us with a platform to showcase not just our unique club ethos, but also the changing face of the city to outstation clubs and those from abroad. It helps that even friends and relatives of participants come down for the event and spread the good word about Calcutta, said Satbinder Singh of RCGC.

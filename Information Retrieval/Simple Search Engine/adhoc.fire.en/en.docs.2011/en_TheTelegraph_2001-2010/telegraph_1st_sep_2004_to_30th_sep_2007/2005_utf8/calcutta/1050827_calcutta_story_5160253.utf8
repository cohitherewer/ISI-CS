The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Traffic policemen on duty should help emergency services like ambulances and fire tenders to negotiate congested roads in the city. If necessary, traffic sergeants can also escort these vehicles till a distance. Usually, we find that ambulances ferrying accident victims and other ailing persons traverse through no-entry zones and also move on the wrong side of the road. This increases the risk of accidents. In such situations, it becomes even more important that the cops be more vigilant to ensure smooth passage of these vehicles.

 Kalyani is one of the most important towns of Nadia. Apart from Kalyani University and BC Roy Agricultural University, which are opening up new vistas for education, three big hospitals are located here. However, many bright students of the district are unable to pursue medicine as there is no medical college here. It would be prudent if the state government sets up a medical college at Kalyani.

 Commuters often miss the train at Sealdah station, especially during rush hours, because of a dearth of adequate number of ticket counters. Apart from the regular passengers of suburban trains, many people come to the station to see off their relatives or friends. These people crowd along with regular local train passengers at the counters for platform tickets. Sometimes, only two to three counters are kept open despite the rush. This leads to a chaotic situation in front of the counters. Authorities must open a separate counter for selling platform tickets. While passengers are always requested to be responsible and buy tickets, authorities should also ensure that facilities are in place to help them purchase tickets.

 The area from Esplanade Metro station, opposite Oberoi Grand, to the Rani Rashmoni Road-Jawaharlal Nehru Road crossing is extremely dirty. It needs to be cleaned and beautified at the earliest.

 It is only after several visits to the ration shop that one gets to buy kerosene. On the other hand, it is freely available in the open market for around Rs 28. There must be a nexus between the ration shop-owners and the vendors in the market.

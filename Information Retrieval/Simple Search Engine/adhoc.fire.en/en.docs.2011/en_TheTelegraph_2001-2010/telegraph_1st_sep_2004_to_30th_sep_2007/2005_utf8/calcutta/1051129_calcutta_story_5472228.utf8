 Saturday night fever peaks midweek

 - It?s hipper now to shun the weekend melas and party in peace on Wednesdays, Fridays

 Weekdays versus weekends. Wednesday versus Saturday. Classy and high-spending versus higher footfall and lower bill amounts.

 The Wednesday and Friday crowds, confirm nightclub managers, comprise young professionals and entrepreneurs who want to party in peace, with their kind of people. For them, weekends are either for private parties or for a quieter time spent with friends and family.

 ?Wednesdays and Fridays are mostly dominated by those who don?t like the mela-like Saturday atmosphere,? says Sovan Mukherjee, manager, Shisha. The profile: young and cool.

 Anirban Simlai, director, F amp;B, The Park, adds the ?classy? quotient to the weekday party scene. ?People coming in on weekdays are more hip, simply because they are the ones who are the educated and successful lot, exposed to various global flavours, thus having a different attitude.?

 Crowd segregation has now entered the realm of brand identity, and equity. Think Someplace Else, the popular pub at The Park, and you think Hip Pocket on Wednesdays and Fridays. ?This is very strategic, because we have identified the crowd that we want to target on these two good days,? reveals Simlai.

 Event manager Amit Hathiramani goes a step forward: ?Your weekday crowd strength goes to show how strong your PR is. Basically, a good crowd on weekdays signifies the closeness of the club family.?

 The genesis of the weekday-weekend great divide can be traced back to an effort by the nightclubs to create a non-Saturday party habit. Bunty Sethi, of Starstruck, recounts how midweek mania was built up to plug the dull days and rev up revenue generation.

 Enter, the Ladies? Wednesday or later the House Friday. ?It was necessary for us to offer people different stuff, simply because the clientele was so different,? observes Sethi.

 Now, the weekday crowd can be credited with much of the business generation at these night haunts. D.K. Jaiswal of HHI confirms that the ?big spenders drop in on Wednesdays and Fridays?.

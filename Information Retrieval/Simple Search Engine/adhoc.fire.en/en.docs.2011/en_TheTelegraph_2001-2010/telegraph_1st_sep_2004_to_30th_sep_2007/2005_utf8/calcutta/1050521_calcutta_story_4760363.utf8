 Tagore rites snap son et lumiere lines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rabindra Bharati University observed Tagore?s birth anniversary on the Jorasanko campus on May 9. The day before, the annual convocation of the university was held there.

 The fallout was a defunct son et lumiere, that used to depict ?Tagore?s house and the Bengal renaissance? through light and sound. The show has not been held since May 10, the day university officials and engineers detected that underground cables installed for the show had been damaged.

 For the two functions, the university had constructed a huge pandal on the lawns of the campus. 

 Sources said excessive digging to erect the pandal had damaged the cables.

 The museum committee, entrusted with the show, met on Friday to discuss the problem, but reportedly could not decided on ?anything concrete?.

 Vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee, however, denied that preparations for the convocation or Rabindra Jayanti had anything to do with the snags in the cables.

 ?As far as I know, the light-and-sound show has been lying defunct for the past few months. A downpour in the first week of May damaged the system,? she asserted. ?The museum committee has discussed the problem at length and I hope we will be able to restart the show soon.?

 Senior officials contradicted Mukherjee. ?There was absolutely no problem with the show till May 8. The decorator who erected the pandal was not told about the underground cables. Had he been aware of them, his men would have been more cautious while digging up the lawns,? said an official.

 The son et lumiere was introduced in 1997, when Subhankar Chakraborty was vice-chancellor. The Union tourism department had sanctioned Rs 10 lakh for the project. A committee was set up with dramatist Manoj Mitra, Kanishka Sen and some university officials to decide on the content. 

 The university charges Rs 10 from viewers and the show is very popular among Tagore scholars, even those who come from abroad to visit the poet?s ancestral house.

 Since the introduction, the system had developed snags several times. But repairs were always prompt, and the show had never been discontinued.

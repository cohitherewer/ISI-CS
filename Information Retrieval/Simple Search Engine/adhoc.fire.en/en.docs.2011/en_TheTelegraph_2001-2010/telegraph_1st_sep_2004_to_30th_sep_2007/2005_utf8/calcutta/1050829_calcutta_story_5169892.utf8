The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fear has a new name

 Some of the stunts that contestants have to perform in Fear Factor 

 Eating tarantula rolls and cockroach sushi. Drinking bullfrog-blended swamp water. Hurling cow stomachs at each other. Ugh? Well, not really. Some of these images make for the best television worldwide. 

 Little surprise then that Fear Factor won NBC?s highest ratings for a summer premier, was the top-rated French Canadian programme and was also one of the most watched shows in Russia.

 And now, after travelling 106 countries, the Endemol show is getting a desi avatar on Sony Entertainment Television. Fear Factor India is perhaps the first real foray into adventure reality television in the country.

 Says Tarun Katial, executive vice-president and business head of Sony: ?There are enough reality contests for creative people and even our channel has had its share in Indian Idol and Fame Gurukul. But we figured out that there?s no reality contest on television for a macho man or a brave woman. That?s when we thought of bringing Fear Factor to India.?

 The first season of the show will play out over 13 episodes. Each episode will have three sets of stunts and the winner of every episode will take home Rs 10 lakh. The winners of each episode will then feature in a grand finale where Rs 1 crore is up for grabs.

 ?It?s the first time that India will get a first-hand taste of an adventure reality show. A completely different kind of emotion is involved in a contest like this. It will also give variety to the reality shows already on air,? adds Katial.

 To be hosted by actor Mukul Dev, the show will be telecast on weekends, a continuation of the channels? attack on the Friday-to-Sunday television programming. Fear Factor India will be shot some time in September in the exotic locales of Kuala Lumpur alongside the Indonesian and Malaysian versions.

 So get ready for a tight ropewalk between skyscrapers or a blind scramble through a rat-infested underground tunnel, all of which, the channel assures, will be ?very safely done?. 

 The auditions (August 27-29) for the first season were carried out in Mumbai only and the finalists are to be picked by Wednesday. And what about the NBC version of the show aired on AXN where the TRPs have reportedly dropped below one? ?AXN is part of our bouquet. So strategic planning should take care of the differentiation between the two shows,? Katial reveals.

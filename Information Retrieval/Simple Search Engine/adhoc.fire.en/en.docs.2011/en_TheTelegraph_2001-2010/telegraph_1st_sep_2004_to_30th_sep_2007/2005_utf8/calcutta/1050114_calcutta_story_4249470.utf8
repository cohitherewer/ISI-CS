The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Green goes to the pits

There?s a flurry of excavation on the Maidan as it falls 

foul of the fair, yet again. Toilets are being dug and pipes laid, with the keepers 

claiming to be in the dark. Metro explores... 

Digging and destroying. Carving kitchen craters and 

open-pit toilets. The Maidan is being fouled up to play host to the fairs, all 

over again.

There was no respite in sight for the city?s precious 

patch of green on Thursday afternoon when Metro made the rounds of the 

Maidan.

The stretch in front of Victoria Memorial has been 

spared this year, thanks to judicial intervention. 

The high court has forbidden the zone bordering the 

heritage hall from being used as a fair ground, but allowed selective use of the 

rest till an alternative venue is ready.

Calcutta High Court on Thursday asked the state government 

to file a report after conducting an inquiry into the alleged abuse wreaked upon 

Brigade Parade Ground by organisers of fairs and religious programmes.

A division bench of Justice Asim Kumar Banerjee and 

Justice Rajendra Nath Sinha passed this directive after petitioner Subhas Dutta 

submitted a bunch of photographs displaying the damage done to the greens. Uttam 

Majumdar, counsel representing the army, also backed Dutta.

The division bench asked government pleader Rabilal 

Moitra to visit the grounds and file a report on January 20, when the matter comes 

up for hearing again.

For now, a large stretch of the Maidan barely beyond 

the no-fair belt is being mutilated before being gobbled up by the Calcutta Book 

Fair and the National Handloom Expo. 

And what?s more, preparations for a third fair, Lexpo, 

will start soon, almost bordering the Memorial. A spot check of the mess on the 

Maidan:

Book Fair venue (off Park Street extension)

Nearly 2,000 workmen are washing clothes, bathing 

in the pond, burning wood to cook and using the spot as one big toilet. General 

secretary of the Publisher and Booksellers? Guild Tridib Chatterjee defended the 

move to dig up ?20 makeshift toilets? for their daily use (Picture on left by 

Aranya Sen). ?We will clean up the area before the fair is inaugurated on January 

25.?

The lush look was all but gone on Wednesday, with 

contract labourers cleaning out the remnants of green.

?Babu, we have just finished digging out the crater 

for kitchen waste and the open-pit toilets. So much more remains to be done,? 

said one of them.

National Handloom Fair (adjoining Book Fair, towards 

Memorial)

Construction is on in full swing, with Victoria Memorial 

as mute backdrop. Earth is being excavated, pipes are being bored deep into the 

ground, sanitary toilets are ready to be constructed (Picture by Aranya Sen), 

but with the refuse to be dumped in a pit ...

?The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will clear the 

waste every day,? claimed A. Kundu, deputy director of the state directorate of 

handloom and textiles. ?We have all the necessary permission and the restoration 

will be done once the fair is over,? he added.

Guardian grumble

?I didn?t have any idea that these things (the 

large-scale digging, creation of open-pit toilets, laying of pipeline) were being 

done? This, of course, cannot be allowed. I will go tomorrow and have a look myself.? 

? Major General Z. U. Shah, GOC (Bengal Area)

?Open-pit toilets are definitely not permissible? 

? Ranvir Kumar, DC (headquarters)

?I have nothing against the fairs but they should 

be fair to the environment and the citizens? The largest lungs in the country 

for any city cannot be choked in this manner.? 

? Subhas Dutta, petitioner

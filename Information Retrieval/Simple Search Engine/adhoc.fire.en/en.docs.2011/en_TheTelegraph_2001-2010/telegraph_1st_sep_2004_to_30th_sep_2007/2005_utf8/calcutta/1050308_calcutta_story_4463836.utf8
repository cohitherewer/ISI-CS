 The sparkle of diamonds blended with the vibrant hues of spring to unfold a dazzling affair at the Pala, ITC Sonar Bangla, on Sunday evening. 

 Tropi-Cal 2005 ? presented by Swarovski and Sananda ? saw the national launch of the spring-summer 2005 collection of the Austrian crystal major. The refreshing line of accessories was showcased through a fashion show, where models walked the ramp draped in designer Abhishek Dutta?s latest collection of ensembles.

 The new line of crystal accessories, titled the Tropical Collection, draws inspiration from the flora and fauna of the tropics.

 Maritime motifs ? starfish, sea horses, shells and flowers ? dangle from necklaces, bracelets and earrings, accentuating the tropical theme. Shades of ocean blue, turquoise, coral, salmon and sand radiate a summery feel. 

 The jewellery comes in various theme designs. The Heather series is in shades of coral with filigree floral motifs, while the clear designs of the necklaces, bracelets, rings and dangling earrings of the Haley set reflect the blues of the ocean. Hatty features multi-stringed designs with mother-of-pearl discs, shells and crystals, while Halina blushes in a delicate coral-look with rose and turquoise crystal beads. The enamelled Hella pieces sparkle with crystals set in a special technique.

 The collection also includes other accessories that harmonise with the jewellery. These include handbags for day and evening wear, as well as wallets and purses. The bags, in the same hues as the jewellery, come in a combination of suede and leather with cut crystal stones or crystal mesh. 

 The pieces adorned the necks, arms and ears of models Pinky, Priyanka Pal, Pooja, Tanushree, Shrestha, Sanchita, Konkona and Neeraj, who flaunted clothing from Abhishek?s spring-summer line. 

 The show started off with a line of western wear comprising cocktail dresses in chiffon and georgette in vibrant hues of pink, purple, turquoise and yellow. Asymmetrical hemlines and a bit of layering gave the clothes a flowing feel.

 The second sequence un- veiled a totally different look with a textured collection of skirts, tops and trousers. Denim combined with prints in browns and neutrals gave the clothes a rugged feel.

 The third range, called Disco, was somewhat similar to the first one, in terms of the fabrics and the palette.

 A line of lehngas was displayed next, which provided a welcome break from the western wear collections. Various kinds of lehngas ? skirt-line, A-line and fishtail ? teamed with corsets and bustiers in combinations of yellow, blue, pink and purple.

 The ethnic flavour continued in the final collection for the night. Saris in chiffon and georgette in the same vibrant palette came with a lot of innovations in the pallu.

 The show was choreographed by Ashish Banerjee of Rampedge, who also gave a modern dance performance in the beginning.

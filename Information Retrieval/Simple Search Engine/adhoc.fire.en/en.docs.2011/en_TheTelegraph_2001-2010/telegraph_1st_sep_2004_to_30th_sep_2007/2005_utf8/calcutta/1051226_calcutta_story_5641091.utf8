 Timeout

 The loss of values and ideals is a dangerous but unavoidable concomitant in a world being swallowed up by an all-consuming avarice and the lust for power and wealth. Octopus, produced by Dasarupak, Silchar brings to focus the forces in society that compel people to make such moral and ethical compromises. Ma Durga Opera is a performing troupe of a remote, virtually forgotten village. Amidst the winds of change sweeping over this tiny hamlet, members of the group struggle hard to remain steadfast to their own principles. All around them they find people being swept away by the tide of coarse commercialism, easily succumbing to temptations of comfort and prosperity laid before them. Yet, Ma Durga Opera stays true to its guiding philosophy and sense of values, ever optimistic of sailing through their troubles with the power that love and honesty gives them.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Octopus, by Dasarupak, Silchar 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Purbasree, EZCC

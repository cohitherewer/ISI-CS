 Ball goes West 

Soccer ball in free-fall

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 If the Indian Football Association (IFA) is planning to take football to the schoolboys in a bid to revive the game, it?s about time. For, the popularity of football is free-falling.

 The demand for the leather ball that has traditionally scored with boys in backyards here is dropping dramatically, even as cricket rides the Maharaja wave. 

 ?I used to sell 40,000 pieces annually even seven years ago. Now the figure has plummeted to around 20,000,? admits Sanjay Agarwal of Mermandis, with claims to being the sole manufacturer of footballs in the state. 

 Sales in the showroom have been hit the hardest. For a while, cricket-tennis balls, used for gully cricket and neighbourhood tournaments, filled in the production blanks. 

 But with the football flop spelt out in sales figures, the 31-year-old has been forced to kick-off business in the West.

 Over the past three years, Agarwal has made inroads into markets as far as Britain and Scandinavia. His client list includes Kandoo in the UK, Roth in Germany, Dynamo in Norway, Margsmatt in Iceland and Ago in Finland. 

 The traditional ball-makers in the country are centred in Meerut or Punjab, but Agarwal feels India has failed to take advantage of the export market. ?Pakistan exports 20 times more than us,? he observes, adding that it is the neighbour?s success which spurred him on to foreign turf.

 ?Pakistan?s forte is the quality of stitching. Stitching of balls is a major rehabilitation scheme in their prisons. China, too, is a big player, but in the moulded balls (basketball) segment,? explains Agarwal.

 The subcontinent had suffered a setback when charges of using child labour had made big players like Puma and Adidas back out ?about four-five years ago?. But the makers have cleared their name and business has turned around.

 Agarwal?s biggest supply flies out to Norway. ?At present, I am executing 16,000 footballs for this season. The league there uses my product.? But it is England that is traditionally India?s biggest client. 

 ?The advantage of doing business abroad is that though clients are tough to convince, they do not shift loyalties quickly,? feels the young entrepreneur.

 The balls have to undergo strict tests before they reach the feet of European stars. ?First, there is the field test to check durability and bounce. Then there is a check for adaptability to climatic conditions. The ball can become hard in extreme winters. Financial negotiations start only after the product passes these tests.?

 And it is not just footballs that are rolling out of the Mahestala factory. ?I make rugby balls, too, mainly for markets abroad.? He has recently received enquiries over e-mail from the Scotland Rugby League. Soon, it might be the turn of rugby to scrum and run for the Calcutta ball.

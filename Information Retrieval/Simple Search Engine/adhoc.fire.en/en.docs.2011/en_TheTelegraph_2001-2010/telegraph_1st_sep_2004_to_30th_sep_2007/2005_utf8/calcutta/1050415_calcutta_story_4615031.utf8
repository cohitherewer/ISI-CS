 If you haven?t studied till Class X and do not boast of any specialised skills, but have a penchant for sports like swimming and wrestling, go right ahead and set up a gymnasium. That?s what VR Talwalkar did with Talwalkars, on Charni Road, Bombay, in 1932. 

 Today, Talwalkars is a national chain and a name to reckon with in the fast lane of fitness. On Thursday, Talwalkars opened its first outlet in the city, at 14A Burdwan Road and unveiled its vision of ?affordable fitness? before Calcutta. The Alipore address has been built over an area of 4,000 sq ft.

 ?The city is now a booming market and people have woken up to the need to be fit. They are also faced with various lifestyle-related problems and diseases. So this is the best time for Talwalkars to come to Calcutta and provide fitness solutions,? said Madhukar V. Talwalkar, son of the late VR Talwalkar.

 The gymnasium chain has a presence in Mumbai, Pune, Kolhapur, Chennai, Kanpur, Lucknow, Surat and Hyderabad. ?This is our first venture in the city but we have 31 centres operating all over the country. In the next six months, we will have three more centres coming up at locations like Ballygunge, Park Street and Salt Lake,? added Madhukar.

 The Talwalkar nutrition programme promises to provide ?simple, effective and scientific methods? to lose or gain weight, with fees ranging from Rs 32,500 to Rs 35,500.

 The fitness programme consist of body sculpting, body shaping, general fitness, massage and personal exercise programme (PEP). ?The workout regime is supported by massages, power supplements and a body-toning programme. Most personnel are from our centres in Mumbai so they are well equipped to handle every problem,? claimed Madhukar.

 While the PEP cost is pegged at Rs 7,000 to Rs 19,000, the executive fitness package costs Rs 22,000 annually.

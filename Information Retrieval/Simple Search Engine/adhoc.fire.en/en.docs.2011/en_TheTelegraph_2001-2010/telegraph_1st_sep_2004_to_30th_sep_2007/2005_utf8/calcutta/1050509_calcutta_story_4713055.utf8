 Photo clue leads cops to crook

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Armed with a photograph of a domestic help who had robbed her employer of Rs 1.2 lakh, the city police?s anti-burglary section arrested her on Friday, almost a month after Maniktala police drew a blank in the case.

 On March 6, Kavita Shikari had made off with Rs 1.2 lakh from the residence of employer Amalendu Mukherjee, a 75-year-old professor. 

 Mukherjee had kept the money in his almirah. ?After Kavita fled, I became certain that she had taken the money,? Mukherjee said.

 Days after a complaint was lodged at Maniktala police station, a team reached the Mukherjee residence and took away the recent photograph of the domestic help that Mukherjee had with him. However, the team failed to trace her, despite conducting several raids.

 On Saturday night, K.N. Sarkar, officer-in-charge of Maniktala police station, was transferred to the enforcement branch by city police chief Prasun Mukherjee. 

 Although the transfer is being officially described as ?routine?, insiders say that Maniktala police?s failure in cracking the case, which the anti-burglary department took just a day to investigate, forced the higher authorities to take the step.

 On Friday, an anti-burglary team from Calcutta Police raided Kavita?s house in Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas. She was arrested and a substantial amount of the loot was recovered from her possession. A raid was also conducted at Kavita?s in-laws? in another locality of Kakdwip.

 ?I live with my daughter and son. I had employed Kavita about a year ago. At that time, I kept her photograph. I guess it has paid off,? sighed Mukherjee in relief.

 ?From March 6 to May 5, the police could not do anything. I had been to them a number of times,? Mukherjee recalled.

 Then, one of Mukherjee?s students came to his aid. ?The girl?s father was a retired senior police officer. He heard me out and arranged for a meeting with the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), on May 5,? he added.

 ?When the professor reported the theft, we immediately asked the burglary department to take up the case. It was successful in arresting Kavita, and later, tracing her husband Shyamapada, who also had a hand in the crime,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 The city police have time and again advised people to keep all the details and photographs of domestic helps, drivers and any other person hired by them for work. 

 ?Very few people implement our suggestion. Professor Amalendu Mukherjee is a commendable exception,? said a senior detective department official.

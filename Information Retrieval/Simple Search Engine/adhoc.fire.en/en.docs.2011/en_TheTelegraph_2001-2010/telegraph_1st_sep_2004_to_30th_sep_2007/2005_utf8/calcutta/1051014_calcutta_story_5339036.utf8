 A slew of gifting options to match every occasion, an autumn-winter collection that mixes elements of elegance, fantasy and extravagance, and an array of new outlets in various formats.

 Spaces, the first organised retail player in home fashion, providing holistic home furnishing solutions in bedcovers, bath robes, bedspreads, cushion and pillow covers, bolsters, quilts, table linen, tablemats, towels, curtains, accessories, etc, under one roof, is extremely bullish on growth.

 We are opening 42 new stores in 21 cities in the next six months, of which 23 will be pure fashion outlets, says Anshuman Singh, CEO, Welspun India domestic division. 

 Part of the Rs 2,000-crore Welspun group, it has opened exclusive Spaces stores across India.

 Spaces, which is already present in City Centre, is planning at least four new stores in Calcutta in the next 18 months, according to Singh. 

 While a Welspun factory outlet is being housed in the Metropolis mall of Hiland Park, the company is scouting for retail racks everywhere around town.

 Having reached an inflexion point, we are trying to sign up with every new mall. The future Spaces stores would be much bigger ? 6,000 to 10,000 sq ft, as opposed to the current format of 1,500 to 3,000 sq ft ? as we aim to become the first multi-brand outlet in home furnishings here, declares Singh.

 While the Tommy Hilfiger store-in-store concept will be carried forward to the new pure-fashion outlets, talks are on with other top-draw brands.

 The group has also tied up with Jindal Artinox for ceramic ware, stainless steel showpieces, dinnerware and gift items.

 There are family and corporate gift options ranging from Rs 101 to 10,001 in a la carte or buffet formats. And they come in three themes ? Sparkle, Cheers and Occasions.

 Says Singh: Gifting a home furnishing item can never go wrong, unlike the usual flowers, dry fruits and sweets, of which often there is an overkill during the festive season.

 In its bid to evolve the home furnishings market, Spaces is introducing a completely new concept of coordinates, with a whole colour story running through the entire home, and going beyond textiles. 

 Its a touch surprising that in Calcutta people still shop mostly for apparel during the Pujas, and we are trying to change that through a string of features in Spaces, stresses Singh.

 From a free interior designer service and creating a software to help customers coordinate from a range of home furnishings, to having an in-store design studio, mock showrooms and even a ladies entertainment area for social functions ? a host of solutions are being offered.

 Setting up a home fashion helpline and introduction of a launderette service are also in the pipeline. 

 We want to emphasise that home fashion is not just for the elite. Spaces is all about super-premium service at affordable prices, the CEO signs off.

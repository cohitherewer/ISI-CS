 Quips amp; slips in counting house

 St Lawrence School (ward 70) 11 am

 Confident that she will emerge victorious, Aparna Neogi, Trinamul Congress candidate, decided to celebrate in advance, as news trickled in that she was leading by 250 votes with the last round of counting already underway. 

 Posing before the television camera and with her supporters, Neogi was seen singing and dancing (Picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). 

 The traditional green abir was about to brought out when the bad news came: ?Didi, we have lost. Asha Banerjee (CPM) has won in the last round.?

 A crestfallen Neogi was later seen sitting in a corner on a chair, apologising to everybody. ?Sorry, ekta mistake hoye gechhe?. I have lost by 31 votes.? 

 There?s many a slip between the cup and the lip. 

 Don Bosco High School (ward 63) 11 am

 ?I?m winning, I?m winning. The CPM is wresting back this seat after 50 long years. It was a long wait, but we have finally created history,? was what Nawal Joshi, CPM candidate chanted, when news spread that Ajit Panja, former Union minister and MP, was cornered. ?Ekhono to ashol baksho khola hoyni, ami to jitboi (let them open the main ballot box. I?ll win),? he said. 

 Joshi, who was trailing Panja by just two votes before the start of counting in the last leg, was confident of winning, until Panja did a turnaround. A little later, Joshi was seen leaving the counting centre, totally devastated. Panja had won by a thin 259 votes. Well! confidence is good, but not over-confidence.

Alipore Multipurpose Govt High School (ward 132) 12.30 pm

 Trinamul Congress councillor Sovan Chatterjee wiped his forehead and heaved a sigh of relief, before quipping: ?Recently, I read that a ship (MV Faiz) had sunk in the Bay of Bengal, but the captain did not desert the ship and died. In our case, the captain (obvious reference to Subrata Mukherjee) was the first to leave the ship.?

 A voice in the crowd quipped:?But rats are the first to desert a sinking ship. When are they going to do so?? 

 Chatterjee tried to find the person but could not. He perhaps forgot that one should always look before talking.Sabita Das , who was denied a Congress ticket, won from ward 55 as an Independent candidate. Congress workers from her ward had heckled PCC president and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee at the Congress headquarters last month when the leadership had denied her the ticket. She lost as a Congress candidate from the same ward in 2000. ?However, I still consider myself a genuine Congress worker and will work for the party,? she asserted.

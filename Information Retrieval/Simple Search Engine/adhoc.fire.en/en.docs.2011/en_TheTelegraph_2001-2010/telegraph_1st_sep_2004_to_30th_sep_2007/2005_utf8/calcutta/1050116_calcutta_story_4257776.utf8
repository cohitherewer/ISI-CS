Power to the people 

Party Hopping

June

actress

Party priority: The right kind of people, food 

and beverages are vital for a good party. I immediately walk out if there?s the 

wrong kind of people. 

Best bash: There were some amazing parties 

in town in December. But the one that Harsh and Madhu Neotia threw on New Year?s 

day just rocked. I met everybody from my fraternity and had a great time.

Bikram Ghosh

percussionist

Party priority: The ambience and warmth of 

the host makes my party. These days, I don?t like loud music at all. I prefer 

lounge parties with a small gathering and good food.

Best bash: The best party we had in recent 

times was one at my place. Some of my father?s percussionist students had come 

down from Europe and all of us jammed on the terrace and had a candle-lit dinner.

Party priority: I am not much of an eater, 

as my diet allows me to eat only a few things. I don?t drink either. So none of 

these makes a difference to me. I just need the music to be really good and a 

young and vibrant crowd. I would never want to go for a party where there are 

serious things being discussed. Life is too serious, anyway. 

Best bash: I don?t party too much. It?s usually 

house parties or a brief session at the nightclubs around town. The party I enjoyed 

the most in recent times was the evening do at Bhaichung?s village in Sikkim on 

New Year?s Eve. The marriage rituals had just gotten over a day ago and we were 

totally relaxed and in a mood to chill out. The party was out in the open in the 

picturesque location of Sikkim. The whole village had turned up to share his joy 

and there was a free flow of good food, drinks and lovely Nepali and Sikkimese 

music. This was something totally different from any of the other celebrity parties 

that I have otherwise attended.

Riya Sen

actress

Party priority: Great music, good wine, cheesy 

nibbles, interesting people and, of course, me make a party really rock! 

Best bash: The best parties I?ve been to are 

those which I happened to attend by chance, without any prior planning. I think 

the most fun I?ve had at a party till date was at my own birthday party last year 

at Enigma in JW Marriott, Mumbai. 

Taking me completely by surprise, it was thrown by 

a very dear friend and attended by many other pals of mine out there (read: Ashish 

Chaudhuri, Zaheer Khan, Fardeen Khan and his father Feroze Khan, Sanjay Dutt and 

Netanya Singh).

Pinky

model

Party priority: I think it is the people who 

make or break a party. Be it the host or the guest, having like-minded people 

who have similar ways of having fun is important. Though many hosts try and get 

an eclectic mix of people to make a party interesting, more often than not the 

hosts end up forming small groups and chat among themselves, spoiling the fun. 

Going to a party which has my kind of people is a must for me.

Best bash: I think first-time experiences are 

always precious. Therefore, of all the parties that I?ve attended recently, the 

one I enjoyed the most was a sit-down Christmas lunch at my husband?s friend?s 

house last month, complete with cake and wine. I really enjoyed it simply because 

the comfort level was very high.

Rahul Saraf

MD, Forum

Party priority: It?s the people who make the 

party. Since the host usually doesn?t have enough time to attend personally to 

each and every guest, it?s important that the guests are able to mingle.

Best bash: The most memorable party for me 

in recent times was one organised by an old school friend. There, I met many pals 

I hadn?t kept in touch with since I left school. It was also a party without pretensions 

? no one was bothered about what you were wearing or which car you had come in. 

It was the most relaxed party I?d attended in a long time.

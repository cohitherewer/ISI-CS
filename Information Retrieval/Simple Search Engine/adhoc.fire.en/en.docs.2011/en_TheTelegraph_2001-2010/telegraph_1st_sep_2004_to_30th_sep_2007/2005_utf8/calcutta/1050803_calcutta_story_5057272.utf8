 Kitchen tips for chefs 

 KINSUK BASU

 Keen to give a fillip to the fast-growing hotel trade in the east and deliver authentic Pan-Asian cuisine to those who will not settle for anything other than the original, the captains of the hospitality industry have decided to organise the first-ever training sessions for chefs.

 The date is yet to be finalised, but the organisers are planning to hold the session in October. Some of the best chefs in this part of the world will be invited to conduct the course.

 Besides the predictable choice of Chinese, Thai and Indonesian dishes, the thrust will also be on tandoori delicacies, for which experts will be flown in from the land of the Nizams.

 ?A cuisine is like a language that keeps changing with the needs of time, bringing into its fold certain elements of foreignness. It?s not that we are not up to the mark, but it always pays to learn from the best in trade,? said Alok Chaudhury, secretary-general of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), which is organising the event.

 The session will be a short one ? three days at the most. The classes will be capped by an interactive session, where experts and the participants will discuss details of preparing certain dishes, among other things.

 ?At the end of it, the participants will have to fill in an evaluation form. This is very important, since the feedback will help us improve the course,? said a member of the association.

 The organisers are also planning to introduce a string of similar courses on guest relations, body language and stores management. ?We are looking forward to grooming the hotel staff with multiple skills,? Chaudhury signed off.

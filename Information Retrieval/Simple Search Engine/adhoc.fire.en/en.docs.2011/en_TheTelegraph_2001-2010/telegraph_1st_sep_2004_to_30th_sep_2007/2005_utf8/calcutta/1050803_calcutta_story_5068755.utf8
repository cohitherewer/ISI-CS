 John Abraham in Taxi No. 9211: First take

 After quite an extended break, film-maker Ramesh Sippy is producing three films in one go. There?s Bluffmaster, directed by son Rohan Sippy, starring Abhishek Bachchan, Riteish Deshmukh and Priyanka Chopra. Taxi No. 9211, directed by Milan Luthria, stars Nana Patekar, John Abraham and Sameera Reddy. And the third film is Fear, directed by Vikram Bhatt with an all-new cast. 

 The shooting for both Bluffmaster and Taxi No. 9211 is underway. Bluffmaster was supposed to star Aishwarya Rai in the lead, but she backed out (citing date problems) and Priyanka was signed in her place.

 But it is on the sets of Taxi No. 9211 where the sparks are burning bright. Says director Luthria about Nana: ?He is the most misunderstood actor in the industry. He loves his work and is a perfectionist. He is so much in tune with his role that when others around him on the sets are not on the same wavelength, he feels a disturbance in the environment.?

 That?s some compliment.

 Wasim Akram: TV time

 If you?re a Disney Channel fan, then you?ve probably caught Kim Possible on the telly. But now, she needs your help to save the world. The case: crack Code Tod. The means: special code-seeker spy goggles. In fact, 22 lakh spy goggles are available to school kids around the country to help them intercept the secret code and assist Kim in saving the world.

 Teen superhero Kim Possible is an average girl next door, who, with the help of best friend Ron Stoppable and computer genius Wade with his Kimmunicator (and Ron?s pet Rufus), saves the world from the baddies. 

 Kim?s arch enemy the evil Dr Drakken is relaying secret codes to his cronies to destroy the universe. Then, it?s back to family and homework. This time though, she needs help to foil Dr Drakken?s plans. 

 The secret codes will be relayed between 5.30 pm and 6 pm, Monday to Friday, till August 12. Armed with their spy goggles, kids can email, SMS or mail their entries. 

 The correct answers will be rewarded with daily and weekly prizes of micro digital spy cameras, video CD/audio MP3 players and gaming mobile phones. At the end of the 15-day period (the contest began on July 25), one lucky winner who cracks all 15 codes will get a laptop.

 He is arguably the best left-arm bowler of all time and has dabbled in TV commentary post-retirement. Now, Wasim Akram will hold forth as a sports presenter on ESPN STAR Sports? newly re-launched sports bulletin, SportsCenter.

 Akram?s foray into programme anchoring is a step forward from his being a part of ESPN STAR Sports? ?Few Good Men? commentary team and his contribution as a judge on the reality show Harsha Ki Khoj.

 SportsCenter has been re-launched in Hindi, with Poonam Sharma, Darain Shahidi and a team of in-house reporters assisting the former Pakistan great.

 ?I have enjoyed every moment of my innings as a commentator on ESPN STAR Sports. My endeavour has been to contribute to the enjoyment of a cricket fan. I am excited about my anchor?s role, which will give me an opportunity to discuss a variety of sports,? Akram said.

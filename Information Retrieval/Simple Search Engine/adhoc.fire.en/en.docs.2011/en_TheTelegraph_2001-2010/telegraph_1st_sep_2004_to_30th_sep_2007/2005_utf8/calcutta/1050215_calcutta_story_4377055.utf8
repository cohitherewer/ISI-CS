 An original perspective

 Firmly anchored to her roots, Sukti Subhra Pradhan is an artist who has successfully surveyed the panoramic scope offered by Indian painting. In doing so, she has nurtured and developed an individual style that distinguishes her as one who respects tradition in art and at the same time is enthusiastic about venturing into newer, broader creative horizons. The ongoing exhibition of her paintings (in tempera) focuses on men, women and nature, in an attempt to analyse them together from the artist?s own perspective. Driven by her innovative instinct, Pradhan has introduced two consummate, original concepts into Indian painting. First, some of her canvases depict only a pure ?idea?, unalloyed with any extraneous imagery that can blur the single, important symbolic element of her compositions. Second, she does not use nature as merely a prop for her subjects. Instead, she presents nature as her principal subject, where people are dwarfed in comparison with it or blend into it completely. Never ceasing to contemplate, introspect and self-analyse, Pradhan?s artistic journey leaves its footprints in her uninhibited sweep of lines, a fearless combination of contrasting colours and vivid, vernal, promethean ideas that see her constantly enriching and re-inventing herself as a truly modern artist.

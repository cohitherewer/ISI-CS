 Emirates eyes direct Dubai link from city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Destination Dubai was a favourite this festive season, with jam-packed flights and long waiting lists. From next summer, the flight frequency is set to soar.

 Buoyed by the increasing number of Calcuttans travelling to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the kingdom?s national airline, Emirates, has decided to launch its city operations from April 1, 2006. 

 Emirates plans to take off six days a week, except Saturdays. Sources said Emirates would fly out of Calcutta at 10.30 am, reaching Dubai in five hours and five minutes. On Sundays, the flight would take off at 10 pm from Calcutta. The airline expects around 500-700 passengers a week.

 ?The best part of this flight would be first-class cabin service. It?s about ultimate comfort and luxury. Also, with our array of connecting flights, one can move on to European destinations,? said a spokesperson for the airline from New Delhi. Emirates would announce details of its Calcutta operations within two weeks, he added.

 On December 23, UAE officials from New Delhi visited the city and held a round of talks with the Airports Authority of India. 

 The entry of Emirates, close on the heels of the Royal Jordanian airline?s exit, has given the travel industry in town something to cheer about at the end of an eventful year. ?It should contribute towards improving the image of the city,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman, Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI). 

 On Wednesday, members of TAFI and Travel Agents Association of India wrote to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, urging him to step in and prevent the Royal Jordanian pullout.

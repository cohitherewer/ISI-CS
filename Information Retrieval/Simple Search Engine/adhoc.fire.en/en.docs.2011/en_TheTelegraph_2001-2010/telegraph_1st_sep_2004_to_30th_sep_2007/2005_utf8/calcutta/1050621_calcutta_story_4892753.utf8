The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 August debut for cobbled MSO

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 In May, the city had witnessed multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable buy out rival Indian Cable Net, bringing the MSO count down from four to three. Come August and the number is set to return to four again, with the debut of a new MSO.

 Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services plans to start operations by August 15, with around 50 cable networks under it. 

 ?We will cater to nearly a lakh households in areas like Ultadanga, Kankurgachhi, Lake Town, Bangur, Nagerbazar, Baranagar, Baguiati, Dum Dum and the adjoining areas,? says Mrinal Chatterjee, one of the promoters of the company.

 The new MSO will be formed with breakaway cable operators from the existing MSOs. The largest chunk would be from SitiCable, the market leader with around 60 per cent of the cable and satellite homes in the CMDA area. 

 ?There will also be operators joining us from Manthan and CableComm,? adds Chatterjee, whose own cable network, Akash Sutra, functioning in areas like Dum Dum and Bangur, will become a franchisee of the new MSO.

 Since SitiCable?s takeover of Indian Cable Net, several operators had been planning to break away and create control rooms of their own. Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services is likely to be the first among them to actually do so.

 ?The existing MSOs are only bothered about their profitability and not customer demand. That is one of the main reasons we are forming the company,? explains Chatterjee. 

 Customer satisfaction will, thus, be prime on the new company?s agenda. ?We will place the channels according to their demand and not how much carriage fee they pay us,? he claims.

 In the prime band (the first 40 channels), the company plans to beam top four channels in all the categories, from regional to general Hindi entertainment and news to kids, based on their TRP ratings.

 Video-on-demand services, allowing viewers to choose music videos with the help of their telephone keypad, will also be available ?from Day I?, along with purely audio channels airing Bengali classics.

 Besides television, Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services plans to provide broadband Internet services. ?In the near future, we would be offering basic telephony as well, for which we are in talks with existing players,? Chatterjee says.

 The project cost is around Rs 2 crore, with the control room set-up, at Bangur Avenue, costing around Rs 50 lakh. ?We are finalising the deals with broadcasters and almost all of them have agreed to provide us with the decoder boxes,? Chatterjee claims.

 North Calcutta and North 24-Parganas will be the current area of operation for the company.

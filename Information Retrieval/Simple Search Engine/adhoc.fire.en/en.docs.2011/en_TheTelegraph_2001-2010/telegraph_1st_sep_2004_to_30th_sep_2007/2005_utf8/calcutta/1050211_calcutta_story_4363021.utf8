The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Guild wins time for fair clean-up

 - Cops soft, mayor firm on cash for litter pullout

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Police on Thursday gave the go-ahead to Publishers and Booksellers Guild to clean up the book fair venue in the next four days. The guild?s deadline for completing the work ended on Thursday.

 The revised deadline, however, might have to be pushed back further, unless the war of words comes to an end between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the guild over who should clean up the garbage.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Ranveer Kumar said on Thursday evening: ?We received a prayer from the guild authorities asking for an extension of the clean-up deadline. After verifying that the work was on and cannot be completed immediately, we are considering the appeal.?

 Guild officials supervised the clean-up work throughout the day. They said the dismantling of stalls would continue all night.

 The venue, however, remained messy, with garbage piling up in several spots. Electricity poles ? at least 400 of which had been put up ? hadn?t been taken down till late in the evening. 

 Sudhangshu Dey, ground convener of the guild, said they hoped to complete the dismantling work by Friday and the restoration work within the next few days.

 The restoration work includes clearing of garbage and filling up the holes in the Maidan where poles had been erected.

 According to Dey, some of the transformers will take a few more days to remove. ?Workers are simultaneously dismantling stalls, clearing garbage and washing the ground,? he explained.

 ?We had to ask for an extension. How can we leave without finishing the work?? asked Kalyan Shah, guild president. 

 Guild officials elaborated that the garbage was being accumulated in one corner of the book fair grounds for removal by the civic body.

 ?The CMC hasn?t told us anything about not cleaning the garbage, so we are expecting them to do the work like every year,? Dey said.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, however, asserted: ?We are not going to touch the garbage unless they pay us amusement tax, which they have said they won?t pay. Aloofness is the only option before us. Let us see what they do in the end.?

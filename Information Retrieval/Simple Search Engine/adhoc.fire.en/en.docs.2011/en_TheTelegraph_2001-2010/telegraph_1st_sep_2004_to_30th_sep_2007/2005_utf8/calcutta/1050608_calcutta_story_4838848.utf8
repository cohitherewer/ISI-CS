The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Meteor who didn?t know when to stop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From owning a small namkin shop on Kalakar Street, in Burrabazar, to building one of the biggest brands in the packaged namkin market in the country, Prabhu Shankar Agarwal played an important role in making Haldiram?s a household name. 

 The multi-storeyed plush restaurant, Pure Food, on VIP Road, prime real estate properties in various parts of the city and proximity with political leaders are evidence of the meteoric rise of the eldest son of Rameshwar Agarwal. 

 ?Prabhu Shankar?s net worth is no less than Rs 75 crore. He is a very shrewd businessman and is always on the look-out for new business opportunities,? said someone who has known the family for over 30 years. 

 This urge to expand his business drew the son of a humble Rajasthani halwai to the world of real estate. Prabhu Shankar was arrested on Tuesday on charges of engaging a gang to kill a tea stall-owner, who was creating an impediment to his grand plan of constructing a highrise in Burrabazar. 

 The Agarwals are from Bikaner in Rajasthan, where the family?s patriarch Haldiram was a famous halwai. The family?s business has grown in Calcutta in the past 20 years and Haldiram?s stores ? the Agarwals own more than 15 across the city ? offer an entire gamut of namkins, sweets and speciality Rajasthani preparations. 

 According to the family friend, Prabhu Shankar played a pivotal role in expanding the business. Bhikharam Chandmal, the most-sought-after namkin brand before Haldiram?s entry, was reduced to a distant second as he started taking business decisions. 

 From setting up a state-wide distribution network to developing a franchisee-based model, Prabhu Shankar gave a marketing push to the business. 

 Though the brothers ? Ashok, Mahesh and Rabi ? parted company, Haldiram?s has remained a strong brand name. ?He even started a price war with the other Haldiram?s stores,? said a businessman in the sweets and savouries business. 

 But property-related disputes kept him busy for the past few years and Prabhu Shankar?s acrimony with his brothers intensified. A senior Congress leader from Rajasthan is involved in resolving the family dispute, suggested sources. 

 ?Prabhu Shankar worked very hard to expand his business, but he did not know where to stop, and that?s why he has landed himself in trouble,? said the family friend.

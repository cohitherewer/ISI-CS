 Know India through aerobics moves

 Pataka, tripataka, ardhapataka ? the group chants. Their hands move and fingers fold correspondingly. ?These are hastamudras mentioned in Natyashastra,? explains the teacher. The next moment they sit in padmasana to do voice training. At the end, they are handed printouts on the Vedic basis of Indian culture.

 This is aerobics, with a huge difference. ?Classical aerobics involves as much education as breathing techniques,? says Nandini Sinha, who has taken a copyright for the form.

 It all started with the kathak dancer taking up an assignment with the Indian embassy in Indonesia. ?During my stint there as well as during dance tours abroad, I saw how necessary it is to know about one?s own country to stand up to others. With globalisation ironing out our distinctiveness, the education system should encompass a know-India course.?

 This feeling led her to formulate classical aerobics. ?I give students a taste of all facets of our heritage to rouse their interest. For instance, in Indonesia, we had a demonstration on the ways of wearing a sari for a class of 25 girls of Far-East nationalities. At my farewell party, all of them came in a sari. That was my little contribution to spreading our culture,? the 38-year-old smiles.

 Similarly, voice culture and the introduction to Indian music through a song, be it a bhajan or a folk song, induced many to explore Indian music. ?I have known my students to pursue yoga, dance or meditation as well.?

 The draw differs depending on the country. ?In Indonesia, where Bollywood is really big, guardians came enquiring whether incorporating dance in aerobics meant I was teaching Hindi film-style moves. But when they saw what this course was about, they turned to me to get their children acquainted with their Indian roots.? Here, in contrast, aerobics is what pulls people. ?They come expecting to shed weight by jumping around, but the first class, starting with stotra paath, is enough to break the illusion. To date, not a single student has opted out.?

 Nandini?s students here are the mostly the aged. But the add-on elements draw the likes of Bharat Baid. The 28-year-old businessman?s passion is theatre and he has signed up to improve body flexibility. ?I am told that bhav (expression) and mudras will be part of the next level,? he says.

 Groom case buried

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 With Rajiv Bhattacharya pleading ignorance about what had happened after he lost consciousness in Ultadanga till his arrival in Mughalsarai, the city police are not too keen to proceed with the case any further. 

 ?We are not interested in meddling in someone?s personal life. Rajiv has returned and that is all that matters. He is now a free man and is welcome to leave for London according to his schedule,? police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said on Tuesday.

 After returning from London on May 29, Rajiv Bhattacharya had gone missing on June 1, soon after he withdrew money from a private bank and did a little shopping. 

 Bhattacharya was scheduled to get married two days later. He was found in Mughalsarai station on June 3. 

 While preparing to bury this particular case, police clarified that there were several inconsistencies in Rajiv?s story and there was evidence enough to prove this.

 ?Rajiv, for instance, had said in Mughalsarai that he was spotted by officers of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on the Mumbai Mail and then handed over to the Government Railway Police (GRP). But back in the city, Rajiv claimed that when he regained consciousness, he found himself lying in a hospital bed, surrounded by GRP and RPF officers. This is clearly jarring,? Mukherjee said. 

 Police have tracked down the ticket collector who had charged Rajiv for converting a sleeper-class ticket into a reserved one during his journey from Dhanbad to Mughalsarai. ?The man told us that Rajiv had then introduced himself as Rajiv Sarkar,? said an officer. He added that there was no injury in Rajiv?s private parts, contrary to his claims in Mughalsarai. 

 According to police, the IBM Global executive had changed trains several times during his journey from Ultadanga to Mughalsarai via Burdwan. 

 Police have found out that in Burdwan, he stayed at a hotel and even called up his IBM office in Salt Lake twice, the first call being made at 4 pm on June 1. It was at Burdwan that Rajiv had bought himself a kurta-pyjama set to change from the trousers and shirt that he was wearing when he left. 

 With chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya claiming on Monday that Rajiv was not abducted, police are busy folding up the case.

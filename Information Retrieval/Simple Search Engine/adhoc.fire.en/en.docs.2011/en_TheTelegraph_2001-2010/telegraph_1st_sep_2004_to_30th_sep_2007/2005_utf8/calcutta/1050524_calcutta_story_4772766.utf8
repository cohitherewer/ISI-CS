 Umbrellas barred in parks

 ?Indecent? behaviour by youngsters in parks in the city and its adjoining areas has forced the forest department to impose a slew of restrictions on visitors.

 To start with, visitors to all eight parks under the department will not be allowed to carry into them certain items, like an umbrella, a big piece of cloth or newspapers.

 ?We have banned umbrellas as we often spot boys and girls kissing behind one. For similar reasons, people will not be allowed to sit behind bushes or walls,? said Somenath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests (urban and recreational forestry).

 The maximum number of complaints about indecent behaviour have been received from Banabitan, in Salt Lake, popularly known as Central Park. 

 ?Our men at the park, during their regular rounds, have to ask at least two dozen boys and girls daily to behave themselves,? said a forest department official.

 ?Even the most liberal of individuals will not approve of the way a section of youngsters often behaves in the parks. Some of them even stoop to having sex behind bushes or umbrellas. This can never be tolerated,? said deputy conservator of forests Mukherjee.

 According to the officials, complaints had poured in from Eden Gardens, too. ?Such incidents were also reported in the past. But now they are happening in alarming numbers, to the extent that some people have stopped visiting the park,? said a keeper at Eden Gardens.

 Lest the situation spins out of hand, the forest department has temporarily shelved a plan to keep the parks open till 8.30 pm. 

 ?There is a public demand that the parks be kept open beyond 5.30 pm, but as the lighting is not adequate, we can?t take the risk of keeping the gates open till late in the evening. Once we instal enough lights, visitors will be allowed to stay in for a few hours more,? Mukherjee asserted.

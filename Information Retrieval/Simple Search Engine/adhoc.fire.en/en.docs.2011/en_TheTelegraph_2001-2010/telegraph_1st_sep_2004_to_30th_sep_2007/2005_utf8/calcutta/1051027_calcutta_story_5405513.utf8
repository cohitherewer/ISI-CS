 Preserved for ever: Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen on celluloid 

 The article ?Recording angel of the city?, September 22, brought back some memories. 

 Like P.T. Nair, I hail from Kerala. In February 1945, I first came to Calcutta at the age of 16, when Lord Burrows was the Governor of Bengal. I am 76 now and have stayed on. I go back to my home state only as a tourist. My two daughters and son were born and brought up in the city and they are in no way different from Bengalis of their age. 

 I retired after working in newspapers for 40 years and took up a job in a college. My byline has appeared in many city newspapers, including Hindustan Standard. 

 I made my first trip to Calcutta from Cochin in a third-class compartment of Howrah Mail. The ticket cost Rs 13. Clad in a dhoti and shirt and clutching my belongings ? a tin box and a bedroll ? I got off at a neat and clean Howrah station. A job broker approached me at the station itself and gave me the address of an office and Rs 10 as advance salary. 

 I put up at a hotel owned by south Indians on Lake Road where a dormitory bed and two meals a day cost Rs 12 per month. At a departmental store in Esplanade, which is still there, I purchased a shirt and a pair of trousers and shoes for Rs 15. 

 First-class tram fare from Lake Market to Dalhousie was one anna then. There were counsellors in the coaches who advised passengers to travel by tram. Newspapers used to carry strip advertisements like ?Travel by Tram? and ?Use Electricity?. 

 There was a small board in front of Metro Cinema, saying: ?No admission to Indians?. 

 Adjacent to the GPO, there was a small, vacant plot barricaded by brass rods, with a board proclaiming that the spot was once the ?Black Hole of Calcutta?. I have seen the ?great Calcutta killing? and the burning of trams to protest the introduction of sales tax by C. Rajagopalachari. The headquarters of almost all multinationals, foreign banks and airlines were in Calcutta at that time. I have also shopped at the British departmental stores on Chowringhee ? Whiteaway Laidlaw amp; Co, Hall amp; Anderson and Army amp; Navy Stores ? none of which exist anymore. 

 N.S. Mani,

 N.S.C. Bose Road. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should be complimented for his initiative to restore, reprint and archive the films of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen (?Uttam-Suchitra for the future?, September 26). Cineastes of the future will thus not be denied the charms of the golden age of Bengali films. However, it must be admitted that the step should have been taken much earlier. 

 Besides the films of Uttam-Suchitra, there are many films of Uttam-Supriya, Uttam-Sabitri and others that deserve to be restored. The necessary steps should be taken as early as possible. The government should release funds so that the project can be pursued in right earnest. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 It is wonderful that the West Bengal Film Development Corporation is reprinting some classics starring Uttam Kumar. No one has been able to take the mahanayak?s place in the Bengali film industry, since his death in 1980. Even youngsters, prefer Uttam-Suchitra starrers to current films. the film development corporation?s move is praiseworthy. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 Since Uttam Kumar has made an indelible impression on the minds of the Bengali film-lovers, the move to restore his movies deserves to be applauded. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report ?Estate, 90, under threat?, September 28, it is undesirable that Anglo-Indian, Chinese and Muslim residents of the dilapidated Bow Barracks have to worry about their future address. The urban development minister should immediately allot flats to them since they are willing to pay the price. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 We, Calcuttans, should be proud that people like Jamila Khatun, Jagannath Bera and Manika Bhowmik live in our midst (?Grit puts kids in school?, September 29). They are the Kohinoors of Bengal. All those who have helped their cause deserve applause for, the value of the right kind of support cannot be overestimated. However, most of us, even with all the backing we want, do not scale the heights that these heroes have. Kudos to Metro for bringing those who have triumphed against the odds into focus. The coverage will give confidence to those who have lost all hope of getting proper education because of poverty. 

 Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road. 

 ?Roadblock pageantry?, September 26, highlighted how the big Puja organisers are hell-bent on breaking pandal rules. It is disheartening that the law enforcers find themselves at the mercy of the organisers and can hardly take action against them. Court intervention is the only hope for harried Calcuttans. 

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street. 

 The article ?Fantasy frame, feelings true?, September 28, argued that Paheli deserved its Oscar nomination. The cinematography of the film was praised in the piece. Unfortunately, the three accompanying photographs were of the two stars of the film. There weren?t even mugshots of the director Amal Palekar and cinematographer Ravi K. Chandran. 

 On the same page, ?Everyman?s Gandhi link? on the film Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara once again carried the photographs of the stars, who are known faces, but not of the director Jahnu Barua. 

 Prantik Sanyal,

 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road. 

 ?Cat-and-mouse at airport?, September 28, made for sad reading. The airport employees are not doing the work for which the tax-payers are paying them. Their attitude ? ?...we might have to use force? ? is shocking. They should be brought to book. Immediate privatisation of the civil aviation sector is the only way to prevent such strikes. 

 Chameli Pal, 

 Batanagar. 

 Apropos the pictures published on the front page of Metro on October 12, the first image from the left is of the Mohd. Ali Park idol, while the next one is of College Square. The captions must have been reversed by mistake. 

 Avishek Ghosh,

 Narendrapur. 

 Apropos the article ?Chinese whispers? (September 27), the name of our CEO is Rajeshwar Mishra and not as stated. 

 P. Narayanan,

 Business manager, Orind Refractories Ltd.

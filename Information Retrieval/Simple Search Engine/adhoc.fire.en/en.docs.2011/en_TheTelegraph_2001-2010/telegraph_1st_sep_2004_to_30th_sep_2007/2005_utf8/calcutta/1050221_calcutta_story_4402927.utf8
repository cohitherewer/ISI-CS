The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Focus, 100 years of physics

 SANTANU STHANAPATI, director of Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) met readers of The Telegraph at his office on February 16 to answer their queries. Participants included Soma Ghosh, Arijit Adhikary, 

Mrinal Kanti Bandopadhyay, Sandip Banerjee, Mihir Maity, Ananda Sur and Srinjoy Basu

Srinjoy Basu: How does your museum propagate scientific ideas among the people?

 We are a part of National Council of Science Museums, which has 28 branches all over the country. Our target audience is students studying between Class VII and Class XII. We try to demonstrate scientific and technological phenomena through models.

 We have eight more units under the museum ? in Bhubaneswar, Patna, Purulia, Burdwan, Siliguri, Digha and Dhenkanal. The units also exhibit models that explain the basic principles of both physical and biological sciences, so that the interest of the students is kindled.

Mrinal Kanti Bandopadhyay: The year 2005 has been declared as International Year of Physics. Are you organising special programmes to celebrate this?

 We are aware of the importance of this year. We will open a gallery to showcase major developments in physics over the past 100 years.

 We will also renovate and reorganise the atom gallery and display new exhibits that will attract students towards physics.

 Earlier, the gallery highlighted basic scientific principles. With the passage of time, students are getting more and more acquainted with complex theories. If they can see practical demonstrations of those theories, they will be able to grasp the concepts better.

Soma Ghosh: Many of your exhibits deal with principles not included in the school curriculum. Why are you exhibiting such models?

 The school curriculum is designed to make students acquainted with the basics of a subject. However, if a student fails to understand what is taught in class, he or she can supplement the information in text books with the knowledge acquired here. 

 The models that we exhibit in the 12 galleries provide a wide range of concepts to students about the application of acquired knowledge. The demonstrations further enhance their understanding of a subject.

Srinjoy Basu: I regularly visit your museum during vacations. I often find that many of the models are out of order. Why don?t you take proper care of the exhibits?

 We have full-fledged electrical, electronic and mechanical workshops to repair exhibits when they go out of order. We try to ensure that the number of faulty exhibits do not exceed five per cent of the total number of models displayed.

 The maintenance work is hampered because the museum is open on all days of the week. While other museums carry out maintenance work on holidays, we do not get that opportunity. 

 A major problem with some of the models is that they are not custom-built, and come in sets. So when a specific part breaks down, we have to change the entire set. Repairing such models generally takes a long time. Moreover, as many of our models are self-instructional, rough handling causes a lot of problems. 

Ananda Sur: Every year, you organise a science fair where students display models. Some of the models are very innovative. Why don?t you preserve these models permanently to encourage the students?

Models made by students are generally crude in nature, 

and therefore cannot be put on permanent display. The models exhibited in the 

museum must be self-explanatory and self-operative. We can, however, adopt the 

ideas of the students and improvise and create models in our workshop, which may 

then become exhibits. As far as encouraging students is concerned, we present 

merit certificates and prizes to the students who build innovative models.

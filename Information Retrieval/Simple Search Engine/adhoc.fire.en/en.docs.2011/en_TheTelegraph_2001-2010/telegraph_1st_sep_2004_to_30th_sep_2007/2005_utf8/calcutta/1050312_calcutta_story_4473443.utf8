The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 During a recent visit to College Square, I found a few youngsters sitting in 

a huddle next to the Vidyasagar statue and taking drugs. Taken aback by their 

insolence, I asked them to stop the wrong-doings. But they turned a deaf ear to 

my plea. I kept repeating my appeal. In the meantime, a small crowd had gathered 

around us but not a single person came forward to support me. Proof enough of 

the moral decadence in our society! After a while, the youngsters left the spot. 

How are the authorities allowing them to openly abuse drugs in a public place? 

The area has a number of educational institutions and many students might fall 

to the deadly addiction. Police should keep drug peddlers away from the area.

 On February 8, I obtained IT challan no ITNS 280 from the website of the Income 

Tax department against my PAN. When I went to State Bank of India, Chinsurah branch, 

to deposit advance tax they did not accept the printout of that challan. They 

insisted on a hard copy of the challan issued by the IT department. I could not 

fathom why the copy of the challan I presented was not accepted despite being 

an authentic one.

 If fire-resistant jute material is used to build pandals, the risk of a fire 

breaking out can be greatly reduced. In the early part of my career, I had worked 

as a supervisor in a jute mill. The procedure of making the fabric fire-resistant 

is very simple. The fabric is passed through a chemical solution on a trough. 

The processed cloth is then passed through a machine which dries it. The Indian 

Jute Industries Research Association on Taratolla Road may be contacted by manufacturers 

for guidance. The extra cost incurred in producing the fire-resistant fabric is 

also quite low. 

 Sarit Kumar Niyogi, Murari Pukur Lane. 

 Northern Park, also known as Subhas Udyan, in south Calcutta is quite popular. 

However, the hedges bordering the park are not watered. Part by part, the metal 

fencing around the park is being stolen. The park is surrounded by parked cars 

and vehicle-repair shops. A few eateries have also opened along the park.

 Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row. 

 Probably because of the forthcoming elections, the municipal body has turned 

a blind eye to the structures being illegally constructed in the Tiljala police 

station area. A particular building on Picnic Garden Road has made no proper provisions 

for entry and exit points, with least regard to CMC?s building plans.

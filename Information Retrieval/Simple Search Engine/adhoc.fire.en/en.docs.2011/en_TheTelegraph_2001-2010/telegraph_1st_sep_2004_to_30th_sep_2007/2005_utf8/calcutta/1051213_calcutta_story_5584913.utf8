 Table tricks

 After hosting a series of cookery sessions for the past few months, The Stadel Poorna Annapurna workshops will focus on beauty and homecare for the next sequence.

 The first workshop of the new series was held recently at the JD Birla Institute at 11, Lower Rawdon Street.

 Sixty students pursuing the home science certificate course picked up interesting tips on napkin folding, table setting and vegetable carving from Arup Chatterjee, restaurant manager at The Stadel. 

 Lifestyle consultant Rita Bhimani threw light on topics like table manners and party hosting.

 During the second workshop, slated for December 17, participants will get to know more about flower arrangement from Anita Kejriwal. 

 Arup Chatterjee will also showcase various theme-based table settings for different occasions like kitty parties, tea parties and special festivals.

 The third workshop in January would deal with personal grooming issues like make-up, haircare and personality development.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The luminescent indicators demarcating lanes on several roads are malfunctioning. In the past, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the city police had had to import the indicators, which glow in the dark. However, of late, many of them, on roads leading to Dalhousie via Race Course Road and passing near the Raj Bhavan, are not functioning. Immediate corrective measures can save public funds from going waste.

 Sumant Poddar,

 Kyd Street. 

 A shop opposite Gariahat Pantaloons, has set up a bamboo and jute structure encroaching upon the footpath. As a sale is on at the outlet, the structure is used to store bags and belongings of the shoppers. It is causing much inconvenience to the pedestrians. The civic authorities and police are indifferent to the problem.

 A month ago, I had witnessed an accident at the crossing of Howrah Amta Road Bankra and Salap junction. A crowded bus fell over on a wall at the site of the construction of a flyover there. The main gate of the bus was blocked, while the emergency door was found permanently sealed. Many passengers were trapped for quite some time. They then climbed out of the exit of the driver?s cabin. Bus staff have confirmed that immediately after the mandatory check by the transport authorities, they seal the emergency door. The transport department should force the bus owners to keep the emergency doors in working condition so that they don?t get stuck in the event of an accident.

 The DVC bridge situated on Golsi-Goshgram Road in Burdwan has been lying unattended for a long time now. It is posing a threat to vehicles and pedestrians alike. The railings of the bridge are also broken at places. Under these circumstances, a fatal accident can happen any day. I request the PWD minister to look into the matter and repair the bridge at the earliest.

 While passing through the area on July 26, I noticed that the sodium vapour lights on the Brabourne Road flyover had not been switched on till as late as 6.30 pm. It was quite dark and drivers were facing much difficulty. It is astonishing that while other flyovers are lit up on every other occasion, the high road near the commercial hub of Calcutta is neglected in this manner. 

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park.

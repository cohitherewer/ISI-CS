 Twenty years ago, they had got together to raise money for poverty relief in Africa. On July 2, the whos who of the musical world are uniting again to make poverty history.

 Live 8 is a series of free concerts to be staged on July 2 at London, Philadelphia, Paris, Rome, Berlin, Johannesburg, Tokyo and Toronto and Moscow. 

 The list of performers includes Coldplay, Dido, Elton John, Joss Stone, Madonna, Mariah Carey, Paul McCartney, Pink Floyd (performing together again after 24 years.), REM, Robbie Williams, Sting, U2, Alicia Keys, Maroon 5, Stevie Wonder, Rob Thomas and many more.

 The good news for music lovers in India is that the entire marathon concert will be beamed live on VH1 starting 6.30 pm on Saturday.

 Organised by Bob Geldof, who put together a similar effort in 1985 called Live Aid, the concerts aim at putting pressure on the G8 countries to double aid, fully cancel debt and deliver trade justice for Africa. 

 The concerts have been timed to precede the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland from July 6 to 8.

 U2 and Paul McCartney will open the show at Londons Hyde Park. From London, the concert moves on to Paris, Berlin, Rome, Philadelphia, Barrie and Tokyo, before winding up in Johannesburg, South Africa.

 The VH1 coverage will also include a news special Chris Martin: Two Fingers to Poverty at 5.30 pm, hosted by the Coldplay vocalist, followed by in-concert performances by the bands participating in Live 8 at 6 pm.

 Around 85 per cent of the world population is expected to tune in to the concert through the Internet, television, terrestrial and satellite radio, and even on cell phone.

 An extra 55,000 free tickets are to be released for the Hyde Park concert after city authorities agreed to allocate more audience space. It will also be extended an extra 90 minutes. Bob Geldof recently appeared on stage at the Glastonbury music festival to appeal for support.

 Live Aid, the concerts held in London and Philadelphia on July 13, 1985, has managed to raise over $100 million so far.

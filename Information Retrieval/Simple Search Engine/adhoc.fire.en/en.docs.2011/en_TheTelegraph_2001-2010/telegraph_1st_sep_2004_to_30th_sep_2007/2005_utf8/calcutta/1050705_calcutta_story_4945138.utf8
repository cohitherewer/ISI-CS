 Law loophole leads to drowning deaths 

 - Guards allow criminals free reign of tanks

 Water warning: The swimming area at Hedua, plagued by lax security and archaic rules. A Telegraph picture

 The drowning of a youth in College Square on June 26 is a pointer to the neglect of the tanks under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 Tallah Jheel Park, College Square, Deshabandhu Park, Hedua, Lansdowne-Puddapukur and Kidderpore-Padmapukur are the six tanks in the city under the civic body.

 ?On an average, two people drown in the tanks every year. Barring one or two, the victims were not members of the swimming clubs, but were taking a dip in the tanks. We can?t stop such people because of a dated civic rule,? said Bhaskar Sinha, general secretary, Sports Development Council (SDC), an arm of the CMC?s parks and gardens wing, which supervises the tanks. 

 The rule, which makes it mandatory for the authorities to allow free access to the tanks, was chalked out more than 170 years ago. 

 ?Unfortunately, the archaic rule is in effect even now. So, we can?t stop anyone from bathing in the tanks. Slum-dwellers from the neighbourhood take advantage of the rule to misuse the tanks. Many don?t know how to swim. It is natural that some of them will drown,? Sinha explained.

 He added that the 25-year-old who drowned in College Square the Sunday before last not only didn?t know how to swim, but was ?drunk?. 

 ?Criminals, even armed ones, sometimes force their way into the water, disturbing members of clubs who swim in the tanks. Several people jump into the tanks from high diving boards in an inebriated state, inviting trouble for themselves and the SDC,? Sinha continued.

 To make matters worse, the security guards at the tanks are often found wanting in their discharge of duties.

 ?Two guards have been posted at College Square by the CMC. They draw regular salaries, but no one has ever seen them keeping an eye on swimmers. The situation is similar at the other tanks,? stated the SDC secretary.

 ?We have repeatedly requested the civic body to either force the guards to be diligent while on duty or allow the SDC to employ private security guards. But nothing has been done,? he alleged.

 According to the council, at least 10,000 people, including children, take a bath in the six tanks, all of which have more than one guard on duty round-the-clock.

 Criminals, however, still raid the premises and decamp with property. ?On the night of July 1, parts of the fence around the statue of Anagarik Dharmapal, founder of the Mahabodhi Society of India, was stolen from College Square,? Sinha said.

 Alarmed at the increase in incidents of drowning in the tanks, the SDC has requested the civic body and the state government to empower it to bar unauthorised and inexpert swimmers from the tanks.

 ?Times have changed and rules should be changed accordingly. What is the point of following a 170-year-old rule if it makes things difficult for the authorities as well as the swimmers?? wondered Sinha.

 He added that under pressure from the SDC, the state government and the CMC had decided to bring about changes. Reforms to the existing rule were chalked out, but the file mysteriously disappeared after reaching the mayor for final approval. 

 CMC officials declined comment on the matter. Municipal commissioner Debashis Som could not be contacted.

 Mayor-designate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, however, promised: ?We will definitely look into the matter after taking charge. Discussions will be held with all concerned and a solution will be arrived at to prevent further mishaps at the tanks.?

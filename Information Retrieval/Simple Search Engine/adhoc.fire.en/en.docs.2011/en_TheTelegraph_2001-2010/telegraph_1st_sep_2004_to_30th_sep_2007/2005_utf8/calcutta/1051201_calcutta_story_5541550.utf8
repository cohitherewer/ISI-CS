 Male models, in Calcutta? Must be kidding. That could well have been the reaction of ramp-watchers at the regional round of the 12th Mr India contest on Wednesday. Of the 30 short-listed aspirants, only seven were from the city. And even among them, most just couldn?t match up ? if some fell short of the minimum height stipulation of 5 ft 10, others had the height but lacked the gait and the attitude.

 ?Even compared to last year, there has been a deterioration in the quality,? rued model coordinator Sujoy Chatterjee, one of the judges for the east zone round. 

 ?Some were good-looking but couldn?t carry themselves or lacked fluency in their communication. Others let us down in the swimsuit round,? added Sujoy.

 Co-judge Shresthaa tried to explain why male models were all but missing in action in this metro. ?Here, modelling is synonymous with the fairer sex. So, we have fewer men taking up modelling seriously. Even if we have raw talent, they are not channelised properly,? said the successful model, now poised to move from Calcutta to Mumbai.

 This does put ramp managers and fashion designers in a spot. ?Most men in the city do not look at modelling as a full-time career option, often due to the poor pay structure. Many move to serials,? says Sanchita Kushary Bose of event management company The Dream Merchants.

 Fashion photographer Indranil Mukherjee points out how city men on the ramp ?walk mostly as fillers? and there is hardly any work for them otherwise. So, for a ramp show, if a leading local female model pockets anything between Rs 3,500 and Rs 10,000, her male counterpart will have to stay content with no more than Rs 3,000.

 If designer Shantanu Goenka partially blames ?the paucity of designers catering to mens? outfits?, one designer who does dress men prefers to look beyond Calcutta for a clotheshorse. ?I prefer models from Delhi and Mumbai, like Upen Patel and Zulfi Sayyed, who have the right attitude to carry off the clothes,? says Sharbari Dutta.

 If leading city model Neeraj stresses the need for ?education? to make the Calcutta male more competitive on the national ramp, Sujoy, Shantanu and Indranil blame part of the poverty on the lack of grooming institutes for male models.

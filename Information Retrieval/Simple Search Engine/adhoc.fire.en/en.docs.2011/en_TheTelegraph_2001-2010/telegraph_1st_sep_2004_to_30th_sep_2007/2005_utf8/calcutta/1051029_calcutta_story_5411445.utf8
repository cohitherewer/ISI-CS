The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stars amp; the city

 Jaya Bachchan and Jaya Prada. Soha Ali Khan and Mandira Bedi. And then there was Raveena Tandon? Three in the spotlight, one at a private function and the other in a private space. All lovely ladies, and all right here on a festive Friday

 SOHA ALI KHAN starred in the premiere of Rituparno Ghosh rsquo;s Antarmahal at Fame, the city rsquo;s new multiplex at Hiland Park. JAYA BACHCHAN, the film rsquo;s producer, joined in, with neta Amar Singh. With Abhishek Bachchan and Jackie Shroff bound by filmi commitments on foreign shores, the spotlight was on Chhotobou Soha, Borobou Rupa (Ganguly) and, of course, Jaya B. ldquo;I am a little nervous today as it rsquo;s a very different role and a very special film, rdquo; said Soha, with a dimpled smile reminiscent of mom Sharmila Tagore.

 RAVEENA TANDON

 remained the elusive one, on her third and final day in town. The Bollywood beauty, on a screen sabbatical for daughter Rashaa, arrived just in time for her birthday (October 26). The family had to shelve travel plans to Sikkim as both mother and daughter came down with a bad bout of cold. So, she has stayed put behind closed doors at ITC Sonar Bangla, apart from regular sessions at the spa. ldquo;I rsquo;m glad to be in Calcutta, but sad that I can rsquo;t go around town, rdquo; said Raveena, scheduled to leave for Asansol to inaugurate a Kali puja on Saturday. 

 JAYA PRADA was here to add glitter to a reception celebrating the election of Assembly Speaker H.A. Halim as chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association rsquo;s executive committee. The actress-turned-politician, who returned to the Bollywood screen opposite Amitabh Bachchan in Khakee last year, spent time at the high-profile party hosted by Sundeep Bhutoria. ldquo;I am quite fascinated by the Bengali d eacute;cor, the Bengali cuisine and the cultural functions here, rdquo; smiled Jaya Prada.

 MANDIRA BEDI made a pretty picture as she passed through town to inaugurate a showroom by designer Jyoti Khaitan on Loudon Street. The lady, who added spice to cricket coverage and made noodle-straps a national fashion statement, stuck to full ethnic gear (ornate lavender sari teamed with a silver halter blouse). ldquo;It always feels nice to come to Calcutta. After all, it rsquo;s the city where I was born. This time, though, the visit is just for a day and I don rsquo;t even manage time to see my mashi, rdquo; smiled Mandira, between autographs and accolades. Picture by Pabitra Das

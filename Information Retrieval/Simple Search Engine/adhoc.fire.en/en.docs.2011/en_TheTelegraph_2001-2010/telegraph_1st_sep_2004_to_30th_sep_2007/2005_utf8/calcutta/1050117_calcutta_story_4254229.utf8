The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New unit to set taxi tickers right

 - Over 

10 per cent meters tampered with, admit unions and owners

 A STAFF REPORTER

A barrage of complaints about tampered taxi meters 

from commuters has prompted the transport department to set up a state-of-the-art 

calibration and testing unit in Salt Lake. 

 The government has joined hands with a Singapore-based company to set up the proposed centre on a build-operate-transfer basis. The Rs 5-crore project will come up on 60 cottahs near the Salt Lake stadium. 

 Officials of the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) and the consumer affairs department will jointly check the taxi meters and calibrate them. 

 More than 10 per cent of the taxis plying in the city have faulty meters, doctored to cheat passengers, admit taxi unions. Taxi owners have conceded that the practice often results in inflated fares. 

 Officers said on Sunday that the proposed unit will be the first of its kind in the country. The method used to test and calibrate the meters will be state-of-the art, they added. 

 ?The Singapore-based company will fund the entire project. Instead of the existing practice of checking taxi meters, a new system, known as the Fifth Wheel Method, will be adopted to prevent tampering. We have already got the land and work on the project will start soon,? said TIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee. 

 Under the existing system, a public vehicles department officer boards a taxi and directs it to run two km from a particular point. Fifteen or 20 taxis follow him to cover the same distance. The officer checks all the meters to spot faulty readings. 

 Transport experts said the process is unscientific, providing enough scope for tampering. The process also takes up a lot of time, and at best, 100 taxis can be tested in a day. Lack of adequate infrastructure and manpower makes it impossible to check the meters of taxis plying in the city. 

 TIDC officers claimed that the new system will save a lot of time. The proposed unit, with the capacity of handling about 500 taxis a day, will take only four minutes to check a meter. Every taxi operator will have to pay Rs 385 to get his meter checked. According to the motor vehicles rules, it is mandatory for taxis to get their meters tested twice a year. 

 Bimal Guha, president of the Bengal Taxi Association, too, admitted that some drivers often tamper with the meters to cheat passengers. ?The association does not support such dishonest practices. I have urged the police and the transport department to impound taxis with faulty meters. We will render full cooperation to the government to set up the new unit,? he said.

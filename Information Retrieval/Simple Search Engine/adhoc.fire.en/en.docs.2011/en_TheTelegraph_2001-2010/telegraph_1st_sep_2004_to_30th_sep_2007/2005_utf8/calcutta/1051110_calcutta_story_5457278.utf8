 Campus in arms over warrants

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The campus of Jadavpur University was a grim reminder on Wednesday of the long-drawn students? agitation four months ago. 

 Academic activities were paralysed as students of the faculties of engineering, science and arts boycotted classes, staged demonstrations and took out rallies to protest the arrest warrants issued against nine students for allegedly assaulting policemen on June 10.

 In a midnight operation on June 10, police had cracked down upon some students when they refused to call-off a fast-unto-death. 

 It is learnt that following the incident, the South 24-Parganas police had filed a case against the students in Alipore court, complaining that some of the agitators had beaten them up and hurled brickbats at them. The warrants issued on Tuesday were on the basis of those complaints.

 ?We had no information about the warrants. It is surprising that the police went to arrest the students all of a sudden, whereas the matter had been settled long before,? said Parag Banerjee of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu).

 Seven of the nine students appeared in court on Wednesday, but their cases did not come up for hearing. The remaining two could not show up as they had graduated and are working outside Bengal.

 Protesting students on the campus alleged that a Shibpur police team had gone to the residence of one of the students late on Tuesday when he was not home and showed the arrest warrant to his parents.

 A group of agitators met university registrar Rajat Bandopadhyay on Wednesday afternoon and submitted a memorandum seeking the authorities? intervention in the matter.

 ?No student should be harassed for an issue that has already been settled. We have written to the police officials concerned on the issue,? Bandopadhyay said.

 However, police officers offered a different reason for the warrants. ?The students should have appeared in court earlier and informed in writing that the university had absolved them of all charges,? they said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tailpipe case closed

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The six-year-old case on automobile emission was disposed of in no time on Friday. A division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly on Friday allowed petitioner S.M. Ghosh to ?withdraw? the case.

 ?My client is satisfied with the steps taken by the state government with regard to the introduction of computerised auto emission centres across the city. So, he is no longer interested in continuing the case,? said lawyer Samarjit Ghosh, appearing on behalf of Ghosh.

 He said the emission testing centres were ?doing very well? in city, so there was no possibility of pollution due to tailpipe emission.

 ?As the petitioner himself does not want to continue the case, we are allowing him to withdraw the petition,? said the bench.

 Adding a twist to the tailpipe tale, petitioner Ghosh told Metro late on Friday that he had not given his lawyer the brief to withdraw the case. 

 ?I am only partially satisfied with the developments,? Ghosh stressed.

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta, who was earlier asked to assist the court in this matter, opposed the prayer of Ghosh?s lawyer and told the court that he was keen to continue the case. But the division bench did not take cognisance of his plea.

 ?Half of the city?s air pollution is caused due to automobile emission. The court?s intervention is necessary, as the government has not taken any steps in the matter,? asserted Dutta.

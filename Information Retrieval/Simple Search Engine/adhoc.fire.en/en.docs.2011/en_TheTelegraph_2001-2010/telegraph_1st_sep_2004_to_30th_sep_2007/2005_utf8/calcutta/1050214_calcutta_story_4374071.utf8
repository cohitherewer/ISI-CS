 From junk jewellery to semi-precious, precious and bridal ornaments, high-end solitaires to old ?Kundan? repertoire ? the Maharajah?s finery studded with rose diamonds, pearls and coloured stones, ethnic pendants to ornate chandeliers?

 A golden gift awaits Calcuttans this Bengali New Year, as Fort Knox, the first dedicated jewellery mall in the east, gets ready to throw open its glittering portals by March-end.

 ?This is essentially an effort to bring in a semblance of organisation to the city?s gems and jewellery sector, a Rs 100 crore-plus market a month. It will also give the highly skilled local artisans a readymade platform to showcase their wares,? says Ashok Bengani, president of the Fort Group, developing the specialised mall.

 The 80,000-sq-ft narrow-focus mall on Camac Street aims to string together under one roof a rich array of branded and unbranded options from all over the country and overseas, while offering ?invaluable exposure? and opportunity to local stakeholders at the same time.

 ?The unsung karigars from Calcutta have traditionally added to the shimmer of the lines of Sotheby?s, Tiffany?s and Christie?s through their unmatched dexterity in handmade jewellery,? says Bengani. Fort Knox aims to bring to the fore their ?unique core competence? and give them a chance for a dialogue with an international audience.

 A gallery, to be housed on the second floor of the mall, will invite designers from all over India to exhibit their stuff and facilitate commercial deals. ?It means the retailers won?t have to visit jewellery fairs to hunt for latest designs and trends. Original creations and new ideas will come calling to their doorsteps,? Bengani stresses.

 The prestigious second floor will also have contemporary ethnic jewellery from Jaipur?s Amrapali, the ?only Indian brand to be called to the Milan jewellery show in 2003?, apart from Delhi-based designer Naina Balsara. Frazer Hawns of London, with its sought-after silverware and amazing range of corporate gifts, will also set up shop.

 Mumbai brands will have a strong presence on the first floor, with the likes of Sheetal and Kiah, Cygnus, Adora and Orra sharing rack space alongside local names Zenith, B. Motiram and G. Sharma amp; Sons. The Sheths will bring along their signature jewellery from the South as well.

 ?Most of these brands now want to step out of the confines of a shop-in-shop concept and venture into the arena of serious buying in a market segment where branded products are growing by 28 per cent every year,? the Fort Knox developer points out.

 Apart from designer branded watches and high-end antiques, the mall will offer rare diamond solitaires certified by the Gemological Institute of America. ?Today, Calcutta?s youngsters have a significant disposable income, thanks to the proliferation of BPOs and call centres. We will target that segment as well and give them a chance to acquire life-long assets,? Bengani observes.

 Apart from the ground-level anchor and the five floors of gems and jewellery, there will be three floors housing offices and a multi-cuisine food court on the top floor, complete with a lounge bar.

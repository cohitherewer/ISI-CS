 Kanishkas is playing host to its annual Tussar Utsav from December 15 to December 17. The exhibition includes an exclusive collection of tussars handpicked from the looms of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.

 Tussar is a fabric with a lot of heritage woven around it. Different regions weave their tussar differently and have a distinctive character. The idea is to provide customers variety. And tussar essentially being a winter fabric, theres no better time for an exhibition, says Prateek Raja of Kanishkas.

 Unusual temple borders, tie and dye ones with block prints and mud print, plain and printed bodies, tussars with kalamkari work, Kashmiri work and kantha? The collection is an assortment of all kinds. The block-printed saris use detailed geometric patterns, floral motifs, traditional symbols and figure designs. The colour palette ranges from bright pinks and green to earthy hues of peach and blue. Then you have specially-woven matkas from Bengal, dupattas and fabrics. 

 Prices start at Rs 1,950. The exhibition timings at 2/1 Hindusthan Road are between 10.30 am and 8 pm.

 Add-on

 Coffee Day Xpress, the national chain of food and beverage kiosks, has come up with a smart solution for all those on the go.

 Great new add-ons like the Criss Cross Cheese Twist, Xpress Fusion Chicken and Green House Sandwich have been added to the menu card. 

 Apart from old favourites like Cappuccino and Mocha, the bright kiosks will now also retail treats in the form of Coffee Delite and Choconut, all for that sugary sweet ending.

 With each of the items priced between Rs 20 and Rs 27, the good times just got better at the takeaway unit of Cafe Coffee Day.

 Spring, and even summer, came early to Dublin as Hidesign, a chain of leather garments and accessories, held a fashion show on Friday night.

 ?Hidesign products are designed with the core objective of providing our clients with international standards, fashion and style,? said Dilip Kapur, president of Hidesign.

 ?For the present collection, the inspiration has been taken from the moods and colours of spring. While red is the predominant colour, browns, whites and blacks have also been used,? added Kapur.

 For the bags, honey colour still remains the favourite along with blue and cream. The jackets have tinges of pink and yellow along with the conventional black and brown.

 Attribute it to the presence of celebrity models like Gauhar Khan and Indrani Dasgupta or the invitations circulated, Dublin was packed to capacity. The show kicked off at 10.30 pm, well behind schedule. But all was forgiven once the elegant collection was unveiled. 

 The show was divided into three sequences. First up was officewear, with models in formal jackets, carrying hip briefcases and travel bags. While the women?s bags were marked with elephant prints on textured leather, those for men were in classic vegetable-dyed tan leather.

 In the second round, models sashayed down the ramp dressed in chic jackets and carrying decorative bags. The casual cross-body bags, that can be used at work and play, are a sure-fire season must-have. The same for men came in textured leather with webbed designs. Finally, the sports jackets won the day. The bright prints, body-hugging fits and the gloss were too much to resist, as were the lived-in leather jackets. 

Star struck

 Partying privately may well be her style, but glam girl Katrina Kaif knows just how to send the mercury soaring. She was to be the centre of attention at the launch of Starstruck Retro Lounge on Saturday night.

 ?This isn?t going to be a disco as we?re going to follow the basic essence of a lounge,? says owner Bunty Sethi. 

 Done up in Italian furniture, this cosy nightspot at Forum will be playing exclusively retro and lounge music.

 Forlorn bar intends to set up court clinic

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 After waiting for years for the state government to provide the facilities, the Bar Association of Calcutta High Court has decided to set up a modern clinic on the court premises at its own cost.

 ?Our association has taken the decision as the healthcare of the 10,000 lawyers, 10,000 litigants, 3,300 staff members and the judges is at stake,? said Sardar Amjad Ali, president of the association. 

 Acting Chief Justice Altamas Kabir has lent his full support to the venture and has asked Ali to find suitable space on the court premises for the proposed clinic. 

 ?On Friday, Justice Kabir went around the court compound to get a better perspective of the problems faced by the lawyers. We showed him a few sites where the clinic could be set up,? said Ali.

 At present, a small medical unit, manned by a government doctor and an assistant, is taking care of the health problems of the judges, lawyers and the common litigants during court hours. 

 However, this unit also caters to the New Secretariat building and the city civil and sessions courts. 

 ?It is an impossible task for a doctor to attend to all the calls in such a vast area. Moreover, the same doctor has to visit Writers? Buildings, too, once a day,? said Uttam Majumdar, former secretary of the bar association.

 He pointed out that the high court authorities, the bar association, the bar library club and also the incorporate law society had made repeated appeals to the state health department in the past for more medical facilities in the court. 

 A few years ago, the health department had assured the high court that it would set up a fully-equipped medical unit and appoint at least two physicians to address the healthcare needs of the advocates and judges. 

 An ambulance for the unit was also promised. 

 ?But, the government has not kept its promises. Earlier, a number of litigants and advocates, including some who had heart ailments, had fallen seriously ill but had to wait for hours to be taken to hospital due to the unavailability of an ambulance in the court compound. Some even died in the delay to be taken to hospital,? said Ali.

 The high court bar association will also arrange for an ambulance at the proposed health centre, Ali added.

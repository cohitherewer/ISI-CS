 Ray of light in pockets without power

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) launched a scheme on Tuesday to bring light to some pockets in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and parts of east Calcutta. Around 50,000 people live in these areas, spread over 83 sq km. 

 Once under panchayats or adjoining municipalities, the areas were merged with the CMC in 1984, during the tenure of the previous Left Front board. 

 The areas include Anandanagar, Panirala, Khanpara (in Behala) and Makaltala (ward 57, in east Calcutta). 

 The main reason for these places remaining in darkness is that the residents cannot afford the cost of setting up a supply infrastructure in their neighbourhoods.

 Under the Urban Electrification of Non-Electrified Areas Scheme, the civic authorities will provide financial support to bring these areas within the spread of the CESC network. A new development-expenditure head has been created for the scheme.

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som has asked the borough executive engineers of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur to identify the ?no-light? and ?no-power? zones by this week.

 ?The financial liability of the scheme will be determined only after the executive engineers submit their lists,? mayor Subrata Mukherjee explained in the CMC.

 A ?no-light? zone is without streetlights, but the households have power lines. A ?no-power? zone means even the households do not have power connections.

 The civic body will provide only streetlights in the ?no-light? zones. In ?no- power? zones, it will provide streetlights and also bear the cost of erecting additional poles for supplying power to households. 

 According to an estimate, the Corporation will have to set up around 2,000 posts. The civic body will make all the arrangements, but residents will have to get the connection from the posts on their own.

 Opposition leader in the civic body Nirmal Mukherjee (CPM) alleged that the mayor had launched the scheme keeping in mind the ensuing elections.

 The mayor?s reaction: ?What?s the harm if people from the lower middle-class get permanent benefits because of the polls??

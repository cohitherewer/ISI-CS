The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Back on the beat

 Kajol and Ajay Devgan on the KBC sets, and (below) Sarika in Kal...

 She?s been missing from the Bollywood scene for quite some time now but this Friday you can catch Sarika on the big screen again in Kal ? Yesterday and Tomorrow. If you miss her at the theatres in the morning, you can check her out as the celebrity judge on the sets of Fame Gurukul.

 ?I found my role in Kal very interesting and the loads of layers in the character made me say yes to the project. I think that?s enough for an actor,? Sarika told Metro.

 Kal is not a one-off assignment for Sarika and she will be seen in other film projects in the near future. ?I have two other films, Sacred Evil and Parzaniya, ready for release. Once these films hit the theatres, I will sign more films,? she said.

 For Sacred Evil, which is based on a book by Ipsita Roy Chakraverti, Sarika came to Calcutta for the shooting. ?I have always found Calcutta very beautiful, being tucked away in lanes and streets.?

 Kajol amp; crores 

 They have been seen in films and commercials but never before on a TV show. But this Sunday, Kajol and Ajay Devgan will take to the small screen as they get ready to be quizzed by Amitabh Bachchan on Kaun Banega Crorepati.

 Known to be a very private couple, it is the cause that got Mr and Mrs Devgan to the hot seats in order to earn as much money as possible for charity. The money won by the two will go to the Chennai-based Mahesh Memorial Trust which is dedicated to cancer research and has eminent film-maker Mani Ratnam as the trustee.

 So catch the Ishq jodi this Sunday, 9 pm on STAR Plus.

 Movie munch

INOX (City Centre) has introduced the Blockbuster amp; Breakfast promotion where you can check out the new movies of the week on the weekends for just Rs 70 and enjoy a combo meal for Rs 40.

 Baiji in Berlin 

 Anwesha, a documentary on courtesans of Calcutta and the decline of their art, directed by Sanghamitra Sarker, has been chosen for the Berlin Film Festival. The film focuses on the fate of baijis, who had become part of the babu culture of Bengal. Though these women had nurtured classical music and kathak, the original performers have fallen on hard times. They have all but disappeared from the Bowbazar area, where they once lived.

 The film is more of a montage of rare photographs of the baijis and clips from Satyajit Ray?s Jalsaghar, famous for its sequences of chamber music. It begins with a narration of the history of these nautch girls, as they used to be called, from their well-documented performances during Durga puja at the Sobhabazar palace in honour of Lord Clive.

 The development of thumri is traced from the days of Wajid Ali Shah. Lengthy performances by Reba Muhuri have been thrown in, with a short piece by Girija Devi and Ramkumar Chattopadhyay.

 There are glimpses of a kotha in contemporary Bowbazar along with performances by a baiji, whose style has become quite filmi for the benefit of her clientele ? businessmen, not royalty. Cinematography is by Soumendu Roy.

 CBI steps in at museum

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sleuths of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the theft of the fifth century sandstone head of Buddha from the Archaeology Long Gallery of Indian Museum on December 29, conducted a spot investigation on Friday.

 The detectives also interrogated the employees and security personnel of the museum and recorded their statements. 

 According to CBI officials, the museum staff will be interrogated again on Saturday.

 ?We will cross-check their statements. We may examine the staff and other museum personnel on a daily basis,? said an official.

 The CBI sleuths did not rule out the involvement of people working at the museum. 

 ?That is why we are focussing on the staff. The people who were supposed to look after the particular gallery are under our scanner,? said another CBI official.

 The agency will collect the piece of the glass that was seized by the detective department during the course of its investigation.

 ?A number of fingerprints have been found on the glass, which may provide us with vital leads. Collection of fingerprints of the museum staff will be started in a day or two,? said the CBI official.

 ?Our investigation is on its preliminary stage. We will contact city detectives to share information,? he added.

 The museum authorities have prepared a detailed report on the security arrangements on the campus and identified the loopholes. 

 The report will be handed over to the CBI.

 The theft has delayed the Centre?s move to engage the Central Industrial Security Force for monitoring security at the museum.

 cops sniff murder in ?suicide?

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 62-year-old man, a former central government employee, was found dead at his house in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Tuesday morning. 

 While the family members of Ahindra Nath Mondal said he had committed suicide, police are not ruling out murder. The body was found in a pool of blood, with the throat slit.

 Family members told police that Mondal had been suffering from depression of late, and he kept to himself most of the time.

 What has caused the sleuths to suspect foul play was the cut mark on the throat. ?If a man commits suicide by slitting his throat, there are likely to be more than one cuts. But in this case, there is only one mark on the throat. Moreover, we have found a few strands of hair in his fist,? said an officer working on the case.

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said all family members would be interrogated. 

 ?It may appear a suicide, but murder cannot be ruled out. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, which will help us establish the cause of the death,? he added.

 Mondal lived in Mission Pally with his wife and one of two sons, who works in a private firm. 

 His other son lives in Behrampore, while both his daughters have been married off.

 Moffazzal Hossain, a neighbour, said the Mondals seemed to be happy, though they did not mix much with their neighbours. ?As far as we know, the family did not have any financial problems.?

 ?In the morning, Mondal?s wife Basanti Devi went out for a walk. Her husband and son Susanta were at home,? said another neighbour.

 On her return, Basanti Devi found her husband lying amid blood in his room. His throat was slit and the weapon was lying beside the body. 

 As she cried out, her son, sleeping in an adjacent room, rushed in. He later informed the neighbours of his father?s death.

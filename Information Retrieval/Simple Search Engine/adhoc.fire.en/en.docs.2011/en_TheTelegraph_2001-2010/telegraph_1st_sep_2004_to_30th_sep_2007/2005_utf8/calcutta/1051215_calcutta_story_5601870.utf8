The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Police plan lake unlock

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With less than 24 hours left for the settlers at Gobindapur rail colony to leave, the administration on Wednesday resolved doing everything possible to ensure the process was not tainted with blood.

 Officers of the city police and their counterparts in South 24-Parganas met the Government Railway Police top brass and agreed on a blueprint for peaceful implementation of the Calcutta High Court order on eviction. 

 Police, sources said, would try not to force out a single individual, but would ensure no one stays back. A mix of tact and force is what they will apply on the settlers, from eight in the morning till midnight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A kind-hearted ?witch?

 The stage adaptation of Tarashankar Bandopadhyays Daini, Nandikar?s Chokh Gyalo demonstrates the groups successful efforts in creating a new dramatic language. It skillfully weaves together various elements of theatre like narration, dialogue, music and poetry to offer an innovative dramatic experience. A touching tale that traces the tragic circumstances of Surodhuni, an old woman branded as a witch, it tries to analyse certain negative aspects of human attitudes and behaviour. Superstition and irrational beliefs of the unlettered village-folk make them think that she is responsible for any misfortune that befalls the villagers. Feared and shunned by all, she lives by herself in an isolated grove. She even begins to believe that she is evil. Yet, normal human feelings of love and tenderness dwell in her heart. When her gestures of sympathy and affection are savagely brushed aside, she can bear it no more. Performance: Swatilekha Sengupta. Direction: Goutam Halder.

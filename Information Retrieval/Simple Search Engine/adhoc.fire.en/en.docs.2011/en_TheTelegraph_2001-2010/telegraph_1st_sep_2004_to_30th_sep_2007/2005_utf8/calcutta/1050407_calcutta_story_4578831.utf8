The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tradition tales

MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

She dresses much of India?s modern-day royalty. But 

that is not why you should pick up the Costumes and Textiles of Royal India. 

Ritu Kumar?s multi-textured book is not only a sensual delight, it chronicles 

millennia of the country?s rich past.

Released in 1999, this book was published by Christie?s 

Books Ltd. It begins in ancient India and moves through the centuries from the 

Vedic times to the 20th Century, exploring the wealth of design. Illuminating 

text is illustrated with vibrant photographs, including those of modern royals 

dressed in family heirlooms.

Kumar, known best for her sumptuous ethnic ensembles 

seeped in traditional crafts, has been a student and practitioner of fast-disappearing 

strains of textiles and handicrafts. She started out in Calcutta, working with 

rural artisans, and has continued to do so through the decades.

As she said in one interview after the release of 

the book: ?For over a century, nothing had been done to preserve certain hoary 

traditions. After patronage from royalty dwindled, middlemen who cared a damn 

about authenticity and quality stepped in and hastened the decline of traditional 

craftsmanship. This set me thinking. I had to do something... Revive the old and 

present it in such a fashion that it appeals to the new generation.?

The spirit is reflected in this beautifully-produced 

volume, and in presenting a window into dying traditions it calls out for a preservation 

of these. 

Kumar explores the changes of political climate and 

technology that have coloured the way India dressed ? from the mixed cultural 

signals of colonialism to electricity ? many of which have been potent forces 

in leading to the homogenisation of many local variations and nuances.

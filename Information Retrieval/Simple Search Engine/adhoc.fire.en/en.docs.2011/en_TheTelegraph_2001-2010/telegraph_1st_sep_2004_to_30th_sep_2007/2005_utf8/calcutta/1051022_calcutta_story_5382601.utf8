 Wheel steal outfit back

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city police had all but written them off. But three thefts in 24 hours have confirmed that a gang of seasoned motorcycle thieves is still active in the city.

 ?Following extensive raids in and around the city, two-wheeler thefts from the roadside had almost stopped for a few months. We thought the lifters had left the city. These three incidents have proved that they are back in business here,? said a detective department officer.

 The first theft was in the Gariahat area. According to the complaint lodged with the police, the Hero Honda Splendor (WB01B 2554), parked on Ramani Chatterjee Street, was lifted between 9.20 pm and 9.40 pm on Thursday. The operation was carried out neatly, despite the two-wheeler being under lock and key.

 Another incident took place in Bhowanipore. Hardeo Singh parked his Bajaj Pulsar (WB01U 2377) in front of 19/C, Padmapukur Road on Wednesday night. When he returned to the spot later, his two-wheeler was nowhere in sight.

 The third incident, under Lake Police station, also involved a Bajaj Pulsar (DL5 SS 1678). It was parked in front of 443/1, Lake Gardens.

 The incidents have taken sleuths of the motor theft section at Lalbazar off-guard. They have now been asked to activate their sources to trace the thieves. ?The modus operandi suggests that it was the handiwork of the same gang that was active in the recent past,? an officer said.

 The absconding two-wheeler thieves have been identified as Masud Rehman, alias Rana Hamid, Ashraf Dafadar, alias Ashu, Azarul Dalal, Monirul Mistry, Hafizul Mandal, Mohabbat Mollah, Mohammad Akbar, Sanjit Majumdar, alias Sanjib Bhai, and Kajal Ghosh, alias Shyam.

 Last year, the rising incidence of two-wheeler theft in the city had prompted then deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department to discuss the issue in an all-India crime conference in Delhi. 

 A thorough probe had revealed that most of the motorcycle thieves were from Bangladesh and were hand-in-glove with operatives in Calcutta.

 ?The engines of Indian motorcycles fetch good money in Bangladesh?s grey market. The buyers there use the engines to convert a country boat to a mechanised one. Sometimes, they also fit it to van-rickshaws, used for ferrying people and goods,? said an officer probing the case.

 Former city detective department chief Soumen Mitra and his officers had visited Indo-Bangla border areas in Bongaon and Basirhat, in North 24-Parganas, to gather information on the network of motorcycle thieves. They had also taken up the issue with Border Security Force. Thereafter, a number of stolen motorcycles were seized when they were being smuggled into Bangladesh. Widespread raids in Calcutta had also brought down the incidence of motorcycle theft.

 Fraud realtor denied bail

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday rejected the bail plea of Subhajit Dutta Roy, a realtor arrested for allegedly obtaining a loan from a bank by fraudulent means.

 Opposing the bail plea, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah told the division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice S.K. Gupta that police had ?intensified? the probe in the case.

 Dutta Roy had sought a loan from the BBD Bag branch of HSBC bank for developing a building on Rajendra Road, under Bhowanipore police station jurisdiction. 

 As demanded by the bank authorities, Dutta Roy produced the ?owner? of the building and introduced her as Sefali Rani Ghosh.

 ?Dutta Roy informed the bank that the woman had agreed to allow him to develop the building. He also furnished the voter?s identity card and other documents of the woman and obtained Rs 73 lakh as a loan,? the public prosecutor said.

 Bank officials later traced the real Sefali Rani Ghosh, who told them that she had not entered into an agreement with any developer. 

 ?After obtaining her voter?s identity card and other documents, the bank authorities tallied them with the papers submitted by Dutta Roy. All the documents of the realtor were found to be forged,? Safiullah said.

 Dutta Roy was arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by the bank with Hare Street thana on September 7. A bank employee, Chhandak Chakraborty, was allegedly part of the conspiracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New Town highway awaits nod

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After a 10-lane arterial road through the heart of the township, the state government is set to sanction a six-lane highway connecting New Town in Rajarhat with Madhyamgram. 

 ?The seven-km highway will extend behind the airport. The project will be implemented by a private party on a build-operate-transfer basis,? announced transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury on Wednesday. 

 The proposal has been tabled before the finance department for its green signal. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Wednesday said he would consider the proposal.

 After sanction from the finance department, the proposal will have to be cleared by the state cabinet, officials said.

 A 10.5-km arterial thoroughfare connecting Salt Lake with VIP Road, now runs through the township. 

 Minister Dasgupta on Wednesday met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Writers? Buildings to review transport department proposals that have been awaiting the finance department?s nod for a long time.

 Transport secretary Chowdhury and finance secretary Samar Ghosh, as well as officials from their departments, attended the meeting.

 The finance department is considering a proposal by the transport department to employ a private agency to collect toll on Vidyasagar Setu. 

 As per the proposal, cameras will be installed on the bridge to identify and catch toll evaders. 

 Recruitment of motor vehicle inspectors to fill 30 vacant posts and computerisation of regional transport offices also figured on the agenda of the meeting. 

 Officials said recruitment of the inspectors has already been cleared by the finance department, while the computerisation proposal was under scrutiny.

 ?In order to start the conversion of over 2.8 million blue books in the state to smart cards, we need technological support in the form of high-power computers and related equipment. We will procure the equipment after getting the go-ahead from the finance department,? said a transport department official.

 The state-wide smart card project will first start with six districts around Calcutta, before spreading to other parts of the state. 

 The directorate of public vehicles is engaged in replacing blue books of 800,000 vehicles in Calcutta, after which it would start replacing driving licences.

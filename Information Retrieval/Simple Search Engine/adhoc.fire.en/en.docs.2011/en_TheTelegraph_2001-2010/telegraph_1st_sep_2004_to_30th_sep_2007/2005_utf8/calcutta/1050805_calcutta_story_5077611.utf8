The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Somebody stop him

 He is billed the best kisser in Bollywood having locked lips with all his heroines from Mallika Sherawat to Dia Mirza to Udita Goswami. But going by his diary, Emraan Hashmi can easily be labelled the busiest actor in tinsel town. With a bag full of films, including everything from a young college flick to a suspenseful murder mystery, Emraan is the man of the moment.

 ?I have never sat back and analysed what is going right or wrong,? Emraan tells Metro. ?There have been hits like Murder and Zeher and flops like Footpath and Tumsa Nahin Dekha. I have taken up roles very instinctively. There have been many film offers where I have loved the role but I have turned them down thinking the commercial fortunes of the project. The one criterion for me has been ? will it appeal to a larger audience??

 That?s something his next release Aashiq Banaya Aapne should do, feels Emraan. ?It is a love triangle filled with moments from college life. It?s about these three friends, played by Sonu Sood, Tanushree Dutta and me. It?s my first college-college film. The director Aditya Datt is a young 21-year-old and he has used a lot of his own college experiences in the film.?

 Once the college caper is done with, Emraan will be seen in his first multistarrer, Vivek Agnihotri?s Chocolate. ?I play this drummer in this bunch of musicians? a young cool character. Yes, there are insecurities when you have to share space with other actors but I didn?t get into all that. I just went by the director?s vision. There were talks of me having a problem with the director but I never had any problem with Vivek. It was about some money issue which was sorted out soon enough.?

 After exploring the ?deep, dark secrets? of Chocolate, Emraan will slip into the shoes of Abu Salem in Anurag Basu?s human take on the underworld don in Gangster. ?I know the role was first offered to Sanjay Dutt and Shoaib Akhtar but I have no issues with that. I won?t cry and ask them, ?Why did you go to them first?? I am confident of doing a good job since my negative characters in Footpath and Murder were well appreciated.?

 Then there?s a special cameo being written for him in Mohit Suri?s Kalyug, starring Kunal Khemu, Deepal Shaw and Shruti Suri. Jawani Diwani has Emraan try some romantic comedy opposite Celina Jaitley. He?s also in Anant Mahadevan?s Hitchcockian thriller Aksar. And if that?s not all, the Bhatt camp is scripting another film around him. Phew!

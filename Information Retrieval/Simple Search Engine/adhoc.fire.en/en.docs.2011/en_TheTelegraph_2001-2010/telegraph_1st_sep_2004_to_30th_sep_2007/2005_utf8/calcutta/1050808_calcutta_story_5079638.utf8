The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 On July 21, while going to office, the driver of the minibus, on route S-184 (Birati-BBD Bag), suddenly stopped the vehicle at Golaghat. The conductor and the helper jumped off and started arguing with two men who had apparently not purchased tickets. It was around 9.30 am and the office-goers were getting late for work. So, we requested the driver to move on but he didn?t listen. In fact, the conductor declared that the bus wouldn?t proceed till all the passengers had got the tickets. It took around eight to 10 minutes for everyone to buy tickets. Those of us who were in a hurry had to get off and opt for other transport to reach our destinations in time. Is there any rule in place, like the one for taxi refusal, that can be used to punish such ill-mannered drivers and conductors?

 A trip to Keoratala burning ghat on July 24 to cremate someone turned out to be a harrowing experience. Initially, the priest who carried out the rituals said that he would accept ?anything nominal?. Later, he clearly asked for Rs 100. The person manning the operations at the electric furnace demanded Rs 500 to 700 when the body had been half burnt. A rate chart should be put up at the crematorium so that people, already shaken by the loss of a dear one, don?t have to go through such an ordeal. Also, a device could be installed which gives a signal when the body has been fully burnt. It is very bothersome to keep inquiring time and again whether or not the body has been cremated.

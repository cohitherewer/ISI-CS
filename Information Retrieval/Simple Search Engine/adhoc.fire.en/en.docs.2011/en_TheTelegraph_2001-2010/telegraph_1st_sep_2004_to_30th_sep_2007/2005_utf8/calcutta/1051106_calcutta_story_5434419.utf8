 Youth focus in fun and fitness

 The Calcutta Swimming Club (CSC) is all geared up to bring back the footfalls to Strand Road.

 ?We must realise that the membership profile at the club is getting younger by the day and at present, nearly 50 per cent of our members are below 30,? says Ravi Todi, who at 36 is one of the youngest presidents at the club.

 From introducing a minimum-billing system and a plastic card to launching a programme for surrendering inactive membership, Todi, who took over the reigns recently, is keen to ensure optimum use of the club by making the place hip and happening.

 ?We have to look at the long-term picture and shore up the funds-flow situation. In December, we want to call an extraordinary general meeting to get a resolution passed that would enable dormant, elderly and migrating members to surrender their membership at a pre-ordained value,? says Todi.

 While late-night fast food has been introduced on Friday Club Nites and Saturday disco nights, and bar hours extended till 11.30 pm, plans are being drawn up to reinvent the worn-down Pub Bar as well.

 ?We want to convert it into a vibrant lounge-bar with an aqua theme and a funky feel, which could become the preferred pad for our young members,? Todi declares.

 Upgrading the eight guestrooms is also on the agenda. ?With five-star facilities at three-star rates, we want to push up occupancy level from the present 54 per cent to 75 per cent,? the president stresses.

 Sports and fitness is another thrust area. The format of the intra-club swimming competition is being changed, while other sports like snooker, billiards, table-tennis and bridge are being given a leg-up.

 ?For facilities like tennis, which we don?t have, we are tying up with other clubs. Alliances for kick-boxing and yoga are also on anvil. We want to build and nourish a talent pool that can take part in the annual inter-club meet and bring accolades for CSC,? says Todi.

 The event calendar is also set for a churn. While Bollywood has remained the principal theme all through, the new committee is bent on broad-basing the product-mix. More stand-up comedy shows, kids? programmes and interactive gigs are being lined up.

 The Children?s Day fun programme is slated for November 12 and December will see a big pre-Christmas bash for children who had a ball at the Diwali firecrackers show.

 The Saturday Kingfisher Nite with a live band from Bangalore has caught on with the youngsters and more such western gigs are being planned.

 ?We also want to continue with the ladies? coffee meets and introduce anti-stress seminars and finishing workshops with designers. The whole idea is to make people come to the club and enjoy in a relaxed ambience,? signs off Todi.

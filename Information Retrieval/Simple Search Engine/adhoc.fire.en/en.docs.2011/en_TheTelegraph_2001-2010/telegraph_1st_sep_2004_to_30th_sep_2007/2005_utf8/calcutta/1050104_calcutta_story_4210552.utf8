The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Weight and watch, fit and fat

 Plus-30 for Russell Crow, plus and minus 50 to Tom Hanks. Matt Damon minus 40 and then another 20. Renee Zellweger, up 20, down 20 and up 20 again. Adrien Brody, down 30. Charlize Theron, plus 30. Most famously, Robert De Niro, up 60. And now, Christian Bale, minus 63.

 That is how many pounds actors have famously lost and gained to create a character.

 Acting essential, or Hollywood?s most happening stunt? Taken as a sign of the ultimate commitment, the scales of opinion are tilting towards decrying the often-unhealthy process of bulking up or paring down in method acting?s latest fad.

 The most recent transformation is Christian Bale?s 63-pound weight loss to play a paranoid factory worker suffering from insomnia in The Machinist. While some critics are wondering why the actor would resort to such drastic measures for so minor a film, other are gasping at the feat performed by the next Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins.

 While actors and actresses usually have top dieticians and fitness instructors at their disposal for the fat-to-fit transition ? or the other way round ? there are still significant risks involved. Bad Boys star Martin Lawrence spent three weeks in hospital, suffering hyperthermia after running in a sweat-suit in the heat to lose weight for Big Momma?s House. He went into coma and was on the ventilator for a week.

 Donnie Wahlberg?s five-week liquid diet for M. Night Shyamalan?s The Sixth Sense led to an eating disorder that needed a year?s recovery time.

 For the role of a heroin-addicted soldier in Courage Under Fire, Matt Damon shed 45 pounds. He ended up with an adrenal gland disorder. It also won the notice of Steven Spielberg, who snapped him up for Saving Private Ryan. And it didn?t stop him from slimming down by another 20 pounds for his frightening character in The Talented Mr Ripley.

 Robert De Niro?s role in Raging Bull required him to bulk up by 60 pounds. For The Godfather, he put on around 20 pounds, for which he travelled to Italy for wholesome, authentic mafia food.

 But the biggest gainer may be Vincent D?Onofrio, who packed in 70 pounds for Stanley Kubrick?s Full Metal Jacket in 1987.

In comparison with these, Renee Zellweger plumping 

up by a mere 20 pounds seems paltry. But considering that she put on the fat for 

Bridget Jones? Diary (picture top), shed it for Chicago (picture 

above), and found it again for Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, it sounds 

downright dangerous.

 Charlize Theron bettered her by 10 pounds and an Oscar. In 2003, Monster saw the South African stunner put on 30 pounds and bag the golden statue for best actress.

 There is no better example of commitment to a character by an actor, and to authenticity by a production, than Cast Away, in which Tom Hanks plays a man stuck on a deserted island. He first put on 50 pounds to play a portly FedEx employee. Shooting was put on hold for a year so the star could lose it all again to achieve the emaciated look required post-exile.

 Back home ? well, at a stretch ? Aishwarya Rai was asked to put on weight for Bride and Prejudice, somewhat inexplicably. But that was a look that went well with Rituparno Ghosh?s scheme of things in Raincoat.

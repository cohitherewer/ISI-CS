The magic of the classic drape is hard to ignore for 

any Indian woman. The most versatile of all Indian attires, the sari makes its 

presence felt on every occasion with equal elan.

While women in almost every Indian state wear the 

sari in a different manner, fashion designer Shaina N.C. further expanded the 

scope of the attire a few years ago by creating 17 new drapes in which it can 

adorn a woman?s body. 

oser home, designer Jyoti Khaitan draped the sari 

in three different ways on model Sanjukta at her Ballygunge Circular Road studio 

called d?studio. 

Skirt style

If you?ve always wanted to flaunt a gorgeous lehnga 

at your best friend?s wedding, don?t fret that you didn?t have the time to get 

one tailored. Instead, create the same effect with the most elaborate sari you 

have in your wardrobe, in a matter of minutes. 

Jyoti has used a rich red georgette sari with intricate 

zardosi work in antique gold to drape like a lehnga on Sanjukta. 

The sari has a striking border with crystals and beadwork and hence is an ideal 

choice for this particular drape, which requires a heavy border. 

The skirt of the sari has been distributed all over 

Sanjukta?s waist with four even pleats, placed at equal distances from each other. 

The heavily-embroidered double border has been placed around her neck in such 

a way that it falls on both shoulders, giving a very heavy look. While the skirt 

looks like a lehnga, the pallu plays the role of the dupatta. 

This is ideally worn with a bustier.

Pallu pleats

If Jyoti recommends the previous drape for a wedding 

ceremony, the next one she feels is more suitable for one of the side shows during 

marriage celebrations. For this she chose a striking georgette sari in peacock 

colours, with resham, gota and stone work.

For this style, the pleats in the skirt of the sari 

have to be placed on the left side. The pallu goes from the right shoulder 

to the left. It ends with a knot on the left shoulder, giving off a fan-like look. 

A brooch helps to keep the pallu in place.

Tier talk

The final style is recommended by Jyoti for cocktail 

parties. And for this she chose a black georgette sari with resham and 

stone work along the border and small floral butis at the base. 

For this, the sari should be tucked into the right 

waist with a pleat. This has to be followed with another pleat on the left side. 

After this, turn the sari around and just drape it in two layers without any pleats. 

Three layers of the border should be showing distinctly, at some distance from 

each other. The pallu is placed like a regular one, but Jyoti has passed 

it through a metal ring to give a slim look.

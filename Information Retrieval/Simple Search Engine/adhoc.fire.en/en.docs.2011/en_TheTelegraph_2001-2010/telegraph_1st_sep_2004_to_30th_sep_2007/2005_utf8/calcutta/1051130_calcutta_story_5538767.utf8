 Eden to reopen in winter

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ending an eight-month stand-off with the army, the state government is likely to reopen Eden Gardens this winter.

 The government had shut down the park on March 22, after the army asked the forest department to discontinue collecting an entry fee.

 In a meeting with the army brass on Tuesday morning, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb reportedly agreed to reopen the park and operate it for the moment without collecting the entry fee.

 ?We had a fruitful discussion with the government. They have assured us that Eden Gardens will reopen this winter,? stated Arun Roye, general officer commanding, Bengal area, after the meeting at Writers? Buildings.

 According to a government official, the park is likely to reopen on February 25.

 Branding the state government ?elitist?, Fort William had demanded that the entry fee be withdrawn immediately. The subsequent decision to shut down the park had irked the army. 

 ?We have conveyed our views on the matter to the government. Eden Gardens is for the common people, and the state shouldn?t make a profit out of it,? added Roye.

 He, however, conceded that entry to the park should be regulated to keep at bay unwanted elements.

 ?We hope there will be a system to keep out unsavoury people and prevent nefarious activities. That will be the responsibility of the police,? Roye elaborated. 

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy and forest secretary A.K. Patnaik also attended the meeting.

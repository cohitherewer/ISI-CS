 Woman jumps to death, body untouched for identity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A woman jumps to her death from a highrise. The body is spotted by the residents of the apartment and police are informed immediately, but the body lies on the cold stone floor of the courtyard for the next four hours, till it is finally removed by police.

 The macabre drama was played out on Wednesday morning after 58-year-old Shipra Basu, a resident of Netaji Nagar in Tollygunge?s Regent Park area, climbed the tallest building in her neighbourhood and jumped from its seventh-eighth floor landing.

 ?The body was spotted by a domestic help around 6.45 am and it was removed only around 10.30 am,? complained Arundhati Sengupta, secretary of the residents? association of Regent Tower, where Shipra committed suicide.

 ?All the while, the body was lying between the two blocks of the building, watched by more than 100 local residents,? she added.

 But the delay in removing the body, police argued, was for the sake of identification. ?It took so long because it was clear that the deceased was from the locality and someone could identify her. Officers were asking residents to identify the woman,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

 ?Initially, we had no clue about her identity. Then, we noticed a ladies? bag lying on the landing. Inside it we found a piece of paper with some phone numbers. Only one of the several people we contacted could give us some details,? Sengupta said.

 Finally, two of Shipra?s family members came forward to identify her.

 Police said Shipra, an employee of Food Corporation of India and wife of yesteryear actor Dilip Basu, was a ?victim of depression?.

 Shipra, whose husband had featured in supporting roles alongside Uttam Kumar in several films, had slipped out of her apartment early on Wednesday and after a five-minute walk reached the highrise.

 The security guard of Regent Tower, Mahesh Das, spotted Shipra walking towards the staircase.

 ?It was around 6.30 am when Das saw Shipra near the lift. She said she would go to a relative?s flat. When Das asked for the flat number, she said she knew the way to the flat but not the number. Das let her go,? said association secretary Sengupta.

 After a few minutes, the guard heard a thud but didn?t pay much attention. On hearing the screams of the domestic help, he ran out into the courtyard.

 A neighbour of Shipra, said: ?She used to speak to us once in a while. I think she was suffering from some kind of depression.?

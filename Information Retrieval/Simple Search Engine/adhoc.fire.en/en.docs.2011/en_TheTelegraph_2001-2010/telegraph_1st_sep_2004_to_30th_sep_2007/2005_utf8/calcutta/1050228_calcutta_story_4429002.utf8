 Indemnity spurned, eviction sole option

 OUR BUREAU 

 As most of the squatters along the railway tracks between Dhakuria Bridge and Tollygunge station have turned down a government offer to rehabilitate them if they move out on their own, forcible eviction is the only option left for the government, officials emphasised on Sunday. 

 By the Calcutta High Court verdict, if the squatters hand over possession of the land and, at the same time, obtain appropriate acknowledgement on this score, they will be able to stake claim on any future rehabilitation scheme. ?However, there has hardly been any response,? an Eastern Railway official said. 

 The eviction of nearly 4,000 families along both sides of the tracks is scheduled to start on March 2.

 ?Only a few squatters have taken the declaration forms, but not a single one has been deposited,? an Eastern Railway officer said on Saturday. A division bench of Calcutta High Court has been kept open for the squatters from February 15 to March 1, so that they can voluntarily give up possession of land. 

 The government has chalked out strategies for eviction of squatters along the three-and-a-half km stretch. About 3,000 shanties have come up there, providing accommodation to 20,000 people.

 At a high-level meeting at Writers? Buildings this week, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and senior railway officers worked out ways in which the eviction drive will be undertaken. 

 ?The eviction will start on March 2, as per the high court order,? Deb said after the meeting. The drive will be conducted jointly by the state and city police. The area covers Tollygunge, Lake and Charu Market police stations, under the city police, and Regent Park and Jadavpur police stations, under the state police jurisdiction.

 Deputy commissioner of city police (headquarters), Ranveer Kumar said: ?We discussed the strategy on how the eviction drive would be coordinated between the state police, city police and the railways.? Officers said another meeting will be held on Monday.

 In September 2004, a division bench of Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice Alok Kumar Basu of Calcutta High Court, on the basis of a directive from the Supreme Court, had asked the Eastern Railway to evict squatters along rail tracks with the help of the state government.

 In December 2004, the bench ordered that the state police shall remove the squatters, while Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), with the assistance of CESC, shall pull down the structures. 

 The railway administration has been ordered to remove the post-eviction debris within a week of the operation. The railways have been ordered to erect barbed-wire fencing along the entire plot in such a manner that it will not be possible for anybody to encroach upon any part of it. 

 Construction work should be completed within three weeks with the help of police. Three weeks after completion of the work, a report should be filed individually by police, railway authorities, CMC and CESC to the court.

 The spectre of eviction has spawned cries for rehabilitation. Pradesh Congress president and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee has written to the chief minister, demanding rehabilitation for the squatters.

 On Sunday evening, Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee threatened to launch a dharna if police used force on the squatters.

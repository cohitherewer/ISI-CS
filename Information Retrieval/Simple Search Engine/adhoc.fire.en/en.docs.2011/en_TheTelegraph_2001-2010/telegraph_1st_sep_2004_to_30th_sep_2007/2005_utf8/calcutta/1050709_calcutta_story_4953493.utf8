The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Waterlogging has already become a common feature in most low-lying areas in the city. Before the start of monsoon many pavements were relaid with tiles and the gaps in between them were filled with sand. This was also done in front of Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s (CMC) headquarters, on SN Banerjee Road. With the onset of rains, the sand has been washed out of the gaps and this has turned the pavements slushy and slippery. Now, the new civic board should find a solution to the problem. They can, perhaps, seal the gaps between the tiles with cement. Whatever be the end result, in the entire process of relaying the footpaths and carrying out repairs a lot of tax-payers? money is being wasted.

 Sumant Poddar,

 Kyd Street. 

 The drivers of heavy vehicles and taxis have scant regard for traffic rules early in the morning. I am a regular morning-walker at Victoria Memorial and I often witness incidents of rash driving. Even if the errant vehicle is intercepted and asked to bring down the speed, the drivers take to arguing instead of accepting their fault. Perhaps, the absence of policemen on the roads gives them a free run. Calcutta Police patrol vans seem to be pathetically incapable of disciplining these drivers. I request the traffic police and the transport department to enforce road rules strictly in the morning.

 Both the pollution control board and the state government fuss over noise pollution levels only during the Pujas. The rest of the year they overlook the ever-increasing noise pollution on the city?s main thoroughfares, which undoubtedly is the result of faulty traffic management and poor maintenance of public transport. Many of the public vehicles, including autorickshaws, do not attach silencer to the vehicle. Residences, offices, educational institutions and hospitals on main roads are forced to keep the windows shut to keep out the noise. This cuts of natural ventilation and causes much inconvenience to people. A huge amount was spent by the Exide group to renovate the exteriors of Exide House to make it sound-proof. But not all can afford that kind of expenditure. Serious efforts on the part of the administration and pollution control board is necessary to control the menace. 

 Jagdish Kumar, 

 Chittaranjan Avenue. 

 Krishnagar stadium, with a seating capacity of 20,000, was constructed more than three decades ago. Apart from a few IFA shield and Ranji Trophy matches, it has witnessed no significant sports activity. The galleries are now in a worn-down and broken state. Authorities should arrange a few matches at the stadium to revive the interest in live sports amongst local residents.

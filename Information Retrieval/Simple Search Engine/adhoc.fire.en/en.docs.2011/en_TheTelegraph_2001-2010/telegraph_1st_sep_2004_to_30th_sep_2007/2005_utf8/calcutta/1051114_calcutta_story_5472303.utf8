The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 A wag, a woof and a ramp romp to remember

 Reshmi Sengupta

 For once, the focus of a fashion show was not on skin but on fur, not on oh-so-hot models but on oh-so-cute dogs. And it was all for a cause

 They walked the ramp, sometimes barking, sometimes wagging their tails and sometimes squatting on the ground. The show-stealers at Claws, Paws, Tails amp; Style, a fundraiser organised by Animal Relief and Care Society, in association with The Telegraph, were clearly the four-legged furry creatures who strutted on to the stage with the flourish of professional models.

 Proceeds from the fashion show, held at the CC amp;FC on Saturday evening, will go to Animal Relief and Care Society, an NGO, to build a full-fledged treatment centre for animals.

 The celebs

 The city celebrities who took to the ramp for a cause included dancers Priti Patel and Sharmila Biswas, artists Shuvaprasanna, Shipra Bhattacharya and Piu Sarkar, actors Arindam Sil and June, percussionist Bikram Ghosh, emcee Madhumanti Maitra, and designers Mona Lamba, Pali Sachdev and Snehasish Bhattacharya. Led by the now Mumbai-based Shonal Rawat, the bevy of models featured Amrita, Sudipta, Ishika, Konkona and Riya.

 They were all dressed by Snehasish, Sayon Mitra, Jayshree Chatterjee and Darbari the boutique. A separate section on accessories displayed gold and diamond jewellery from BC Sen. 

 The evening anchored by Oindrilla Dutt also featured music by Anjum Katyal and Francis Lepcha.

 The stars

 For once in a fashion show, plunging necklines and rising hemlines did not matter. The spotlight was all on the dogs ? of various shapes and sizes, talents and temperaments.

 Some sprang towards the first-row children, while a few were even reluctant to take a stroll. Some were bewildered by the lights and the din, while the rest seemed to love the flashbulbs and the frenzy.

 The pet patrol kicked off with Piu and the tiny Chihuahua snuggled in her arms. Next up was Madhumanti Maitra, carrying a Pekingese and then dragging a Dachsund and a German Shepherd. 

 June matched steps with a portly St Bernard busy sniffing around, before returning first with a Basset Hound and then with a Pug. Shuvaprasanna turned up with wife Shipra and a Pug, while Arindam Sil showed off his precious Louis, a Shitzoo imported from the Philippines. Designer Snehasish made an appearance cradling his toddler son and Chikoo, his cultured Pom.

 The line-up of dogs also featured a Lhasa Apso, Spitz, Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd and Golden Retriever. Just a few refused to romp the ramp.

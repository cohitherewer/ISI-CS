 Goddess grants lease of life to art form

 The theme chosen by Bandhab Sammilani, of Maharaja Tagore Road, in Dhakuria, for this year?s Durga puja will be a first in terms of d?cor for the autumn extravaganza. It will also grant a new lease of life to an art form on the wane and open an avenue of income for the women of rural Bengal.

 The goddess and the pandal at the Sammilani?s 2005 community puja will be bedecked with nakshikanthas, generally embroidered by women in rural Bengal.

 Just a couple of years shy of its golden jubilee, the Sammilani?s pujas are noted for their innovative themes. 

 This year, the rural habitat of yore will be depicted through the nakshikanthas. Old women in villages excelled in making nakshikanthas. The stitch is seldom used these days, except on clothes.

 It had influenced Bengali poet Jasimuddin to pen Nakshikanthar Math, which depicted life in the villages through the eyes of Rupai and his fiancee Saju.

 ?Not many people know how to stitch nakshikanthas. In our puja, the idols will be made of thread and draped in clothes bearing nakshikantha motifs. A large nakshikantha will adorn the pandal,? stated Lekhak Roy, one of the Puja organisers. 

 According to Roy, poet Debasish Bhattacharya was the inspiration behind the novel venture.

 His designs are being implemented by around 20 women, working round-the-clock at Raimonikhaki village, in Raidighi, South 24-Parganas, about 100 km from the city. They are being supervised by Raju Das, a designer and a member of the club.

 The idols are being made at Dankuni, in Hooghly, about 40 km from Calcutta, under the supervision of Bhattacharya. 

 ?Our endeavour is to revive an almost forgotten stitch and help rural women become self-sufficient. Our puja will, hopefully, act as a showcase for their craft,? said Bhattacharya. 

 Kutty Brahma, another puja organiser, said the club would consider its efforts successful if visitors liked the theme.

 ?We would be happy to popularise a dying culture. The artisans who stitch nakshikanthas belong to the economically-weaker sections. With the help of the government, the art form can become the source of sustenance for many artisans. If that happens, we would feel that we have done something good,? he added.

 Minati Purkait, one of the artisans, said all of them were balancing the stitching with their household work. ?It is a pleasure to work on the nakshikanthas,? she said.

 Class X student Barnali Kansai is also involved in the stitching. ?I feel really happy when I see a piece of finished work. I generally work after school,? she remarked.

 The women will visit the city to decorate the idols and the pandal after completing the basic stitching at Raimonikhaki, said Apurba Banerjee, another member of the Sammilani. ?If necessary, they will explain the intricacies of the nakshikanthas to us. We are going in for a totally new look,? he signed off.

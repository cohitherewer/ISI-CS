The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City trails in fuel switch

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The chief minister has not shown the same zeal in cleaning up the city air as in attracting investment. And Calcutta?s dismal performance in replacing old commercial vehicles with compressed natural gas (CNG) models, vis-?-vis other Indian cities, is a reflection of that.

 The December-31 deadline for the replacement of old autorickshaws in the state is fast approaching, but only 3.5 per cent of the owners have so far complied. The government is content merely serving notices. It failed to thrash out an exchange scheme with automobile manufacturers even after a series of meetings.

 ?Wait for the deadline and then see what happens,?? maintained transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. ?The socio-economic condition here is different from other cities. Do not compare us with anyone.?

 The difference in progress is too stark to ignore. All three-wheelers and other commercial vehicles in Delhi and Mumbai already ply on CNG, while nearly 90 per cent of the autorickshaws in Bangalore have switched to the green fuel. Between 40 and 60 per cent of the vehicles in other major cities have emulated their lead. The entire process will be completed in another six months in most of these centres.

 In Hyderabad, over 30 per cent of the autorickshaws run on CNG. Buses and taxis more than a decade old have been forced off the road six months ago. The state government has arranged bank loans to help the owners buy new vehicles and has set up a task force to ensure enforcement of the rules and oversee the replacement process.

 Chennai is not lagging behind either. Forty per cent of the three-wheelers and most of the old taxis and buses have been replaced. The state government is offering a 25 per cent subsidy on the cost of new vehicles. Bank loans have been arranged for the rest of the amount. Even the commuters are being asked to avoid polluting vehicles.

 Ahmedabad, too, has stolen a march on Calcutta, with half its commercial vehicles running on clean fuel.

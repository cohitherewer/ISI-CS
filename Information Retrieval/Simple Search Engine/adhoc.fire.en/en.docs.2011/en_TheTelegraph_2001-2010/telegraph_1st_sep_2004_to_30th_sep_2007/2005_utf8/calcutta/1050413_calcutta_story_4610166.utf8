Balancing art amp; commerce

After campus caper Rok Sako To Rok Lo, management guru

He shares with Reshmi Sengupta his plans of rolling out six films every 

financial year

 What are the six films your company Planman Life 

will be making this year?

Well, two of these will be directed by Rituparno Ghosh 

? one in Bengali, one in Hindi. There will be one by Aziz Mirza, one by Anjan 

Das, and one by a new director, as we want to promote new talent. Aziz Mirza will 

be the creative director for that one. The sixth film will be directed by me. 

This plan stretches for the period April 2005 to April 2006.

Our idea is to make six films every year ? six in 

2005, six in 2006, and increase the number in the third year. Next year, there 

will be one film by Anjan Das, one by Ritu, one by Aziz Mirza and one by a new 

director. We are also trying to make one with Mani Ratnam.

The first to go on the floors will be Ritu?s Bengali 

film starring Prosenjit and Konkona Sen Sharma. He had narrated the story to me 

and I just loved it. Ritu is planning something very unusual in this film. You 

will find both Prosenjit and Konkona in double roles. He will start shooting in 

the last week of May.

For his Hindi film, I have given Ritu the storyline 

and he will do the dialogues and screenplay. And for this, we will be approaching 

a mainstream cast. For the Aziz Mirza film, we are working on the storyline and 

cast.

 What is the thought behind this mix of Bengali 

and Bollywood films?

We want to balance art and commercial cinema. We want 

to make some extremely meaningful films every year, which will not have to bother 

about the commercial aspect. After the film is made, we will think about marketing. 

On the other side are the mainstream films, which will take care of the box-office.

 What made you think of signing Rituparno?

I am fond of his style of film-making. He is among 

the finest when it comes to portraying relationships on screen. 

 That means if Rituparno makes a Raincoat kind 

of film for you, which got a lot of critical acclaim but wasn?t a box-office success, 

it is fine with you?

Yes, absolutely. I don?t mind if the film doesn?t 

break even. Good, sensitive films are what we want from him.

 And how binding would the terms and conditions 

be for Rituparno or for the others?

We are not going to impose anything. But I am sure 

Ritu will have no problem in accepting anything that we can explain logically. 

This fear factor is just not there. 

We would select a storyline from the ones the film-makers 

give us, find the right cast that would draw the audiences and market the films 

in a proper way. Both Aziz Mirza and Ritu have their favourite actors and actresses, 

so a lot will depend on that.

 What is the budget in each category?

For the Bengali films, we are allotting Rs 75 lakh 

to Rs 1 crore for each project, because even the best marketing can?t get back 

more than that in this slab. For Hindi films, we have broken up the budget in 

three tiers. First, there are the Rs 3-crore films with new directors and new 

cast. Then, the Rs 6 crore films, where there will be two mainstream film stars. 

For instance, those like Chalte Chalte or Hum Tum. The last is Rs 

15 crore which will be multi-starrers.

 What kind of a film will you direct after Rok 

Sako To Rok Lo?

It will be of the school film genre again. The film 

will deal with the life and ambitions of 20 kids. It will be a musical in which 

dialogues will be carried forward through songs. We seldom have musicals in Hindi 

films. 

 You had tried the school genre in Rok Sako 

To Rok Lo. What went wrong with that film?

The generation that grew up on Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander 

found no novelty in Rok Sako?. They had Aamir Khan in mind while watching 

our film. So, I lost the entire above-30 audience. But it did well among the school 

crowd, the Class XI and XII section. 

A lot of things in the film were not right. It could 

have been cut short by 20 to 22 minutes. I got carried away by personal instincts; 

I got too involved with what we had shot. I couldn?t delete anything. But it has 

been a learning experience. I need to do a lot of homework before I direct again. 

 What did you think of Manjari Fadnis and Yash 

Pandit?s performances? You are repeating them in Anjan Das?s Phaltu?

I was very satisfied with Manjari. And I think Yash 

has got a lot of potential. Maybe he was awkward in some scenes. But Anjanda?s 

film will help him big time. 

 Is the Bengali film with Anjan Das the one starring 

Mithun Chakraborty?

Yes, and I am trying to persuade him to make it in 

Hindi. A good film in Hindi has a far greater reach than a Bengali film dubbed 

in Hindi.

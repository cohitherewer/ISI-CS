 Wiser from their experience last Friday, when the city was lashed by showers, anxious authorities of the Calcutta Book Fair contacted the Met office on Tuesday to find out what the gloomy sky had in store.

 ?But the weather office assured us that there were little chances of a heavy shower. So, we are not worried,? said Kalyan Shah, president of Publishers and Booksellers Guild. 

 The Book Fair had to be kept closed last Saturday as the ground had become slushy and waterlogged after the previous day?s shower.

 As a precautionary measure, the officials said, the electrical contractors have been asked to check whether Tuesday?s light rain has caused any damage to the labyrinth of circuits on the ground.

 ?If we have light rain on Wednesday, there won?t be a problem. We are now prepared to brave even a few heavy showers. Last Friday, we were caught unawares,? said Shah. 

 ?The crowd was good this afternoon. But, people started leaving early to avoid the rain,? he rued.

 Met officials foresaw the possibility of rain in the city and in south Bengal on Wednesday. Chief of regional meteorological centre at Alipore K.K. Chakraborty said moisture-laden winds were blowing in from the Khyber Pass region. ?This western disturbance has already caused rain in Bihar and Jharkhand. We also expect rain tomorrow,? he said. 

 He held out hopes of the sky clearing by Thursday.

 Officials added that there was also an upper-air trough of low pressure over Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Bihar, extending up to Maharashtra, that was sucking in moisture from the Bay of Bengal. ?The cloudy sky and the rain are the impact of the two systems,? an official said.

 But the North Wind has not been blocked completely. ?We are receiving chilly winds from the North, despite a rise in minimum temperature,? an official added.

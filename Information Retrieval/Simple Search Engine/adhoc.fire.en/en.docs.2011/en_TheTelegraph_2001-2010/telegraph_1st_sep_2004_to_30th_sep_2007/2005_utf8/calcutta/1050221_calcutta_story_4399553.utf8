The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon appetease

Victor Banerjee

Attention please. This car is backing up? ? spluttered 

and blubbered out of the darn mud-caked backside of our jeep; over, and over, 

and over again, in an indescribable oxidental (sic) accent that tried shooing 

off a two-tonne deaf rhinoceros that had decided to park right up against our 

front fender. Dusk in Kaziranga is magical; but not when your exit out of the 

sanctuary is blocked by one of its Jurassic residents.

Eventually, as the sun began to set, I asked our driver 

to take us back to a forest campsite where visitors hadn?t spent a night in 30 

years or more. A flock of glistening red jungle fowl took to the air and then 

veered towards the sunset and one beautiful cockbird landed on the branch of a 

blossoming simul tree. Its flowers and the bird?s plumage catching the 

dying red rays of the sun is a sight I shall not forget: until we took the wrong 

turn and ended up at a river where a herd of hog deer were drinking water beside 

the fresh pug marks of a Royal Bengal tiger.

We once again spat out of the rear of our clattering 

vehicle that ridiculous recorded message to the wild; presumably to clear the 

thick jungle of unwary jay walking elephants. We sped away in a cloud of fine 

Brahmaputra silt dust and arrived at the campsite to the horror of the Forester, 

who had been living there, cut off from civilisation for nine long years. We disembarked 

like three white ghosts and it took 15 minutes of patting our hair, faces and 

clothes to emerge from the powdered dust and half look like humans.

Within seconds, the Forester was laughing and jumping, 

up and down, with a huge pot belly bobbing, down and up, in the kinetically opposite 

direction. He was over the crescent to see humans other than the three companions 

he had lived with for almost a decade. Without bothering to hear our story, he 

talked nonstop for half an hour about the dangers of being there, the poachers 

he had shot, the buffalo that had gored him and a small elephant that visited 

the camp once every month to steal and eat his salt rations. By now our only sources 

of light were his torch and mine and two hurricane lanterns in one of his tents. 

Then out of the dark emerged a short figure bearing three very welcome steaming 

steel glasses of raw tea liquor seasoned with salt. 

The Forester turned to the short guard and said something 

in rapid Assamese. The guard grinned baring all his pan-eroded teeth and 

bent over and whispered something into the Forester?s ear. They both doubled up 

laughing and the guard turned and disappeared into the darkness.

Minutes later, another guard who looked like he hadn?t 

eaten in years and had tied his trousers tight with a belt whose end hung loose 

between his legs, appeared with a stack of firewood and a shovel. In minutes he 

had dug a little hole in the ground, poured some kerosene on a handful of dry 

twigs and had a bonfire going with a few logs crackling and sizzling in it. In 

the dark I could hear a lot of excitement. The first guard reappeared grinning 

wider than when he had left.

?He bringing some alive borali from home. You are 

berry lucky. He came back just only today apter pipteen days libh? laughed our 

Forester. In the light of the fire I could see several fresh fish about eight 

to ten inches long in a flat earthen dish. ?I will make a spesal dinar. Please 

wait?. He sent the guard off with several orders. Called him back, and shouted 

out a few more. Things were happening and I knew not what.

Guard No. 2 walked back in with a knife and an aluminium 

dish. By the light of the fire his fingers flew across nodules of ginger and cut 

them into little pieces. He did the same with two onions and two green chilies. 

I heard a branch being ripped off a tree and was worried it might be the small 

elephant paying us a visit. The Forester seeing the panic in my eyes laughed out 

louder than before and said, ?Done warry. Not haati. Jast guard tearing banana 

branch?.

By now the grinner was back. The fish had been skinned 

down to a mound of flesh. He picked up the chopped onions and ginger and chillies 

and threw it on the fish, sprinkled a little precious salt that the baby elephant 

had spared them and then proceeded to run his fingers through and thoroughly mixed 

it all, careful not to make a paste of it. He now pulled out a few bamboo skewers 

from his pocket and began to pat the ground fish on them like sheek kebabs. 

He handed me a stick and nodded. I helped pile up a few skewers.

By then Guard No. 2 was back with three thalis 

(plates) and a huge banana leaf. Now No. 1 showed us how to wrap some of the fish 

in a piece of banana leaf, skewer it and roast it in the fire until the leaf had 

burned black on all sides. He then unwrapped each little packet we had made and 

out came a small bottle of raw mustard oil (that I can only presume was his hair 

oil) and I was shown how to pour a few drops of oil over the fish while Guard 

No. 2 miraculously produced, from yet another pocket, some crinkled and crushed 

coriander leaves wrapped in a pharmacists bill. ?Eat sar. With some rice,? ordered 

the Forester. The rice that was uncovered was the food they had cooked for themselves. 

We were obviously depriving these wonderful people of their own rations. ?Cmon, 

sar. Getting cold!? How could I refuse? Wow!

I could, and may yet one day, give you a sophisticated 

charcoal barbeque recipe for Pura Mas or Mas Patol Dia, but that somehow will 

never taste the same as when you roast it yourself over a log fire in winter. 

As the summer birds appear and fans begin to swirl slowly overhead, you probably 

have a couple of weeks left to take the family out on a picnic and try out this 

wonderful Assamese dish. Enjoy it as a salute to forest guards whose great deeds 

otherwise go unsung.

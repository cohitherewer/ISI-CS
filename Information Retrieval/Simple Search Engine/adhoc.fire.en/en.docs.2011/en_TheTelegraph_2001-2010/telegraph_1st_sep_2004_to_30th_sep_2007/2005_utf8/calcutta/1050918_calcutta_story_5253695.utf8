 The premiere of Bratya Basus second directorial venture, Teesta, saw the film fraternity ? including actors, film-makers and technicians ? trooping into Nandan on Friday evening. 

 After the two-hour screening, the celebrity brigade drove to Fort William ? despite the drizzle ? for a party thrown to mark the films release.

 Among the show-stealers were Teesta leading lady Debasree Roy, looking stunning in a heavily-embroidered green silk sari. She was flanked by leading man Badshah Moitra and co-actor Pijush Ganguly.

 Also spotted mingling with the crowd were ex-footballer P.K. Banerjee and writer Nabaneeta Dev Sen.

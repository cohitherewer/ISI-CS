The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Too much of Bachchan

AdLib

If AB keeps saying this is good and that is good, the 

goodness becomes that less credible

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

on the first Sunday of this year, Adlib had 

talked about three of the significant marketing happenings of 2004. Some readers, 

however, felt the discussion about these were not adequate. It may not be a very 

good idea to ignore such feedback. First because this is a column devoted to marketing. 

Readers might actually expect me to practise what I preach. Also, I agree with 

the feedback. In the next few weeks, we will take each of those events by turn. 

And we kick off with the Big B issue: is he endorsing far too many products on 

TV?

There are many reasons why a celebrity is put into 

the advertising for a brand. Not the least important of them is the opportunity 

it presents to the family of the owner of the brand. The chance to meet the star 

and take a keepsake photograph is of overwhelming value. If you do not believe 

me, consider this. Amitabh Bachchan?s portfolio as an advertising model has a 

large majority of family-run businesses!

The second most important reason is, however, business 

related. Put a star in the ad and it has a better chance of being noticed. The 

logic is simple. You are on a minibus ride from Barasat to BBD Bag. During the 

journey you would see thousands of faces and hundreds of cars. You will not remember 

most of them after you reach your destination. 

Yet, if you happen to see Bipasha Basu driving past 

you near the airport crossing, you will not forget the experience in a hurry. 

This benefit during a peak time ad break on television is invaluable. Bigger the 

star, higher the retention value. Hence the crores that AB can command for a three-day 

shoot and a 30-second screen appearance.

Of course there is the other issue of endorsement 

value. If Big B says Red Eveready is a great battery, it must be so. He would 

not associate himself with a hanky panky product. This is the expected thought 

process in the viewer mind.

What has Mr Bachchan done to dilute this situation? 

He has advertised for far too many brands. On that minibus trip of yours, if every 

other day you saw Bipasha driving past you your encounters will slowly become 

forgettable. Even on the issue of endorsement, rarity value counts. If AB keeps 

saying this is good and that is good, then the goodness becomes that much less 

credible.

Brands can do very little about this. At the time 

of signing him, the only guarantee is that no other brand competing in the market 

will be advertised by AB. Interestingly, it is possibly not considered that when 

it comes to the battle for catching viewer attention, Navratan oil competes with 

Hajmola, pencil batteries with Chyawanprashes. So the brands do not really know 

what share of AB?s advertising screen presence they are buying. Very unusual purchase 

that.

Friends of Mr Bachchan will say he can do nothing 

about this either. He is being offered the contracts and there is no reason why 

he should look a gift horse in the mouth. This, indeed, is a hit-and-run policy. 

AB should know that what he brings to the party, like good cognac, tastes best 

in sips and causes hiccups if gulped. He should perhaps choose only a few brands 

to endorse and make those few pay for the others that he rejects. At the moment, 

however, neither the buyer nor the seller is bothered.

It possibly is a blind buy and a bind sell.

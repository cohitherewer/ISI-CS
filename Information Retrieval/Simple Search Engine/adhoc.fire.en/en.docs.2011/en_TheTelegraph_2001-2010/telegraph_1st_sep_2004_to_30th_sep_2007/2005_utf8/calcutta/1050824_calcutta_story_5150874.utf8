 Dial M For Murder (1954)

Director Alfred Hitchcock

Cast Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings

Plot Ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice (Milland) plans 

to murder his wife (Kelly) for her money. He blackmails an old college associate 

to carry out the murder, but when things go wrong he sees a way to turn events 

around to his advantage.

 Hitchcock bought the rights to Frederick Knott?s 

hit stage play and then hired Knott himself to write the screenplay for the film.

 This is unofficially the first Hitchcock ?blonde? 

film (his series of movies with blonde actresses like Janet Leigh, Tippi Hedren 

and Kim Novak).

 The film was shot in 3D, using low-angle shots with 

lamps. But there was only a brief original release in 3D, which was followed by 

the conventional ?flat? release.

 The much-anticipated Hitchcock appearance happens 

in a reunion photograph ? that also includes Jimmy Stewart ? around 15 minutes 

into the film.

 The film has been remade into many movie and TV versions 

in many countries including the Michael Douglas-starrer A Perfect Murder and 

the Bollywood potboiler Humraaz.

My Wife?s Murder (2005)

Director Jijy Philip

Cast Anil Kapoor, Suchitra Krishnamurthy, Nandana 

Dev Sen, Boman Irani

Plot A man (Anil) accidentally kills his wife 

(Suchitra) after a fight over the alleged affair with his office assistant (Nandana). 

What follows is a cat-and-mouse game with the investigating police officer (Boman).

 A true story, this was the first ever idea that producer 

Ram Gopal Varma wanted to make a film on but went on to make Shiva, instead. 

 The film was initially planned in two versions, Galti 

Se and Jaan Bujhke ? one where the man kills his wife by accident and 

the other where he kills her intentionally.

 Varma produced a Telugu version of the same film 

called Madhyanam Hatya, which sparked a lot of protests from women?s groups 

for showing a man killing his wife.

 Anil used to cycle his way to the film sets because 

he wanted to get into the middle-class skin of his character.

 He had also given up smoking but had to take it up 

again for the scenes in the film where he smokes out of tension.

 Muse and the music

 From ghazals to Bollywood and Indipop chartbusters. The Rathod couple, Roopkumar and Sonali, is charting an all-new musical course, involving everything from Indo-Pak bus rides to Oscar-winning music directors.

 In the city for a performance, both the Rathods were unanimous in their conscious efforts to rid themselves of the ?ghazal singer? tag stamped on them over the years. 

 ?I have grown up listening to the Beatles and the Bee Gees and ghazal was always last on my list of musical preference,? says Sonali. ?But now that I have made a name as a ghazal singer, I would like to use the platform to explore newer grounds in music.?

 Sonali has already collaborated with the legendary Japanese music director Ryuichi Sakamoto, who had composed the Oscar-winning score for The Last Emperor, for a world music album named Zero Landmine. 

 ?Ustad Sultan Khan and I were the only two Indians in the compilation which featured some of the biggest names in music from different parts of the world. We were invited to Tokyo where we performed our eight-minute song live with 200 musicians. It was a great experience,? Sonali recalls.

 The singer is now working on her first Indipop album titled Indian Soul which has music by Leslie Lewis and lyrics by Mehboob. ?It?s not ghazal, not even pop,? says Sonali. ?It?s everything about myself ? it?s like me humming to myself with the audience allowed to tune in. It?s something on the lines of Norah Jones ? singing straight from the heart.?

 While Sonali is trying to make a foray into Indipop, husband Roopkumar is hitting the right notes as a music director in Bollywood. ?The dialogue writer of Woh Tera Naam Tha heard me and the producer signed me on straightaway. After that Madhoshi happened, where the film?s title was changed once the makers heard my song Madhoshi hai. Then I did two tracks for Zeher and another one for Nazar.?

 That one Nazar number, Main jogan ban gayee, sung by Shubha Mudgal, is not only a big draw in Pakistan (with Meera playing the leading lady) but has also been the theme track for the Aman Bus Seva that has been started recently across the Indo-Pak border. 

 ?Meera?s mother told her, ?Yeh gaana tere pe picturise hua hai ? yeh ek achcha kaam kiya tune?. Mahesh Bhatt saab said, he hasn?t heard such a powerful song in his entire filmi career,? says Roopkumar with a touch of pride.

 So what?s stopping the two from collaborating for a film song as they have done often for ghazal tracks? ?We both have just started out. I?m sure we?ll work together for a special project in the future,? the couple signs off.

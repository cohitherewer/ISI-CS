 ways wanted to go to BED with your favourite stars? Well, Wednesday was the chance to fulfil fun fantasies, as some of Bollywood?s biggest descended on the brand new night haunt in town thrown open to Calcutta?s party people.

 A joint effort of actor Aditya Panscholi and the Vohras (father Bipin and daughter Megha), BED at 7, Ballygunge Circular Road, is all about bars, entertainment and dining.

 A whole lot of entertainment was in store at the opening as the hottest bods of Mumbai?s tinsel town stormed the stop opposite Max Mueller Bhavan with party space, restaurants, pub and disco. Suniel Shetty, Neha Dhupia, Mallika Sherawat, Jackie Shroff, Koena Mitra ? it was a feast for all eyes.

 The first stars to arrive, close to 10 pm, were Mallika and Gulshan Grover, followed by Koena. Mallika, in a strappy A-line dress, kept her distance before having ?a bit of a blast with close friends?.

 City girl Koena, stunning in a shimmery golden top, looked quite at home and pleased as punch, having just bagged Suparn Verma?s Boss, opposite Fardeen Khan ? and that too, at the expense of Bengali hot babe Bipasha Basu!

 Koena?s other Boss co-star Aditya Panscholi was the man of the moment, though. Not only did he walk the ramp but was a gracious host to his Mumbai friends. ?The bond within the film industry is so strong these days that just a phone call from Aditya and we all are here,? said badman Gulshan. ?And knowing him, if he is the force behind BED, it?s going to rock, big time.?

 Known for his grey avatars on the big screen, Aditya was all humility on Wednesday. ?I am not that good with words. I just hope you like the place and come here again and again,? smiled the actor who recently made his celluloid comeback with Sanjay Gupta?s Musafir and plans to open many more BEDs across the country.

 Suniel Shetty joined the party around 11 pm and was immediately the centre of attention. At his witty best, Suniel went berserk when prodded to speak about BED to a radio station over the cell phone. ?Aap koi bhai to nahin? I am scared to talk on strangers? mobiles.?

 But the actor-turned-producer was happy with the party place. ?I am not that aware of Calcutta?s nightlife. I?ve come here only for a few occasions by the evening flight and left early next morning. And tonight there are too many people to really understand the scope of the place. But it has shaped up quite well,? said Suniel.

 With Jackie Shroff and Neha Dhupia adding class and curves to the Bollywood brigade, the Tollywood caravan was all but derailed. The Deboleenas, Arunimas and Koneenicas were as lost in the crowd as a ?toddler in a topless bar? (Sidhuism No...).

 Finally, it was time to disco as DJ Pre-anjana took charge of the console. Suniel, Gulshan, Neha and VJ Anusha (remember her in the Lut gaye item number?) hit the floor and partied Mumbaiya style. Till late in the night, there was a buzz at BED of Sanjay Dutt dropping by, but with Shabd releasing today, he must have been otherwise occupied.

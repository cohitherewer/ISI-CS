 One-stop style shop

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 LIFESTYLE ZONE 

 A recent addition to the citys increasing list of one-stop shopping destinations, Chemb in City Centre is home to an assortment of designer outfits, trendy bags, fashion accessories and stylish houseware. A venture by designer Amita Bajoria and husband Deepak Bajoria, the store upped its shutters for Calcuttans last month.

 Our store caters to wardrobe needs and more. While the clothes are created by Amitas label Chemb, the accessories and home d?cor items are sourced from various brands, says Deepak.

 Clothes line

 The apparel section throws up ethnic, Indo-western as well as western silhouettes. A wide range of kurtis, ponchos, tops, salwar suits and saris offers plenty of choice. Kurtis with asymmetrical hemlines and embellished with floral and abstract motifs make for both casual and party wear. 

 Sensuous crepes and georgettes are stylised with prints, threadwork and zari. Also on the racks are flowing skirts, tops and ponchos for trendy teens. The prices range from Rs 1,400 to Rs 8,000. However, the prices of saris go up to several thousand rupees.

 Carry on

 The clothes range is complemented by a collection of stylish bags from Sanguine. 

 A line of smart bags with splashes of white, black, blue and red can be paired with western wear and Indo-western stuff, while another range with floral motifs in beads and embroidery is a good bet to go with ethnic clothes. For a dash of funk, one can choose from the colourful totes with whacky buttons.

 The range also includes swimming bags, picnic pack-ins, toilet bags, wallets in checks and stripes and mobile holders. Prices range between Rs 350 and Rs 750.

 Stone story

 The extensive range of chunky jewellery at Chemb includes earrings, wristlets, anklets, toe rings and neckpieces. Stone and crystals are very much in fashion now. A line of stone-studded accessories from Fits is very popular with college goers, says Deepak. The jewellery section also houses stone-studded watches, bracelets, brooches and bindis. 

 You can lend some colour to your tresses with fashionable hairclips, combclips and scrunchies. And to pack in all these, there are ornate jewellery boxes on offer.

 Kids stuff

 The little ones can choose from a wide array of hair clips, with motifs ranging from flowers and bows to Mickey Mouse and Barbie. The clips have a good finish, the colour does not come off easily and the rounded edges do not hurt the kid, claims Deepak. Also on offer are rings in splashes of pink.

 Home d eacute;cor

 This section boasts a host of home essentials, showpieces and knick knacks. From innovative vases, lamp shades, cane bins and a wide range of CD cases to dressing table accessories, candles and photo frames, the range is really wide. A show stealer here is a line of coffee cups and glasses in combination of glass and steel. The other highlights are fashionable bathroom accessories ? soap dispensers, soap cases and toothbrush holders in porcelain, acrylic and plastic.

 We also have a lot of interesting gift options that we keep on changing. We try and display stuff keeping in mind coming festivals. Right now we have a lot of gift items for Rakhi, adds Deepak.

 When it comes to road repair, finance minister Asim Dasgupta has gone from neutral to fourth gear, hitting the fast lane of funding.

 Last Thursday, he refused to open the pre-Puja purse strings. A day later, he released Rs 5 crore for a festive facelift of some streets.

 Less than a week after that, Dasgupta announced an allocation of Rs 15 crore for ?urgent repairs? to some arterial roads and tram tracks in the run-up to Durga puja.

 Of the Rs 15 crore sanctioned, Rs 11 crore will go towards road repairs in 125 municipalities, while Rs 2 crore will be spent on repairs of tram tracks. Another Rs 2 crore will be sanctioned to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) for repairs on EM Bypass, the Rashbehari connector and Kona Expressway.

 ?The money will be released from the Rs 273-crore PWD budget for road repairs this year. Temporary repair work will be conducted on a war footing and will be finished before the Puja,? Dasgupta said on Wednesday. 

 ?We are aware that there is very little time. Hence, work will be carried out round-the-clock, if needed,? he asserted.

 The HRBC will repair around 33 km, including stretches of MG Road, Strand Road, College Street, Lenin Sarani and the stretch between the Shyambazar five-point crossing and Galiff Street.

 The CMC will pitch in with around 17 km, covering Kalighat Road, Hazra Road, Judges? Court Road, Diamond Harbour Road, Chitpur and the stretch from Karl Marx Sarani to Kidderpore tram depot.

 The finance minister went around town on Saturday evening to see for himself the condition of some of the city?s thoroughfares.

 With additional commissioner of police (I) Goutam Mohan Chakraborty, deputy commissioner (traffic) Javed Shamim, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Ranjan Banerjee in tow, Dasgupta inspected Lenin Sarani, BB Ganguly Street, the Shyambazar crossing, Judges? Court Road, MG Road, Rashbehari Avenue and Karl Marx Sarani.

 Work on concretisation of Lenin Sarani, BB Ganguly Street, MG Road and the stretch between Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Bidhan Sarani will commence after the festive season. For this, Rs 42 crore has been sanctioned.

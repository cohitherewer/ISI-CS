The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Chit-chat chambers 

Nothing adds more spice to a boring day 

at work than a piece of juicy gossip. Sangita Sultania G. Roy explores 

the tattle zones at the workplace

HOT SPOTS: The corridors and the canteens 

are the ideal places to catch up on office gossip 

Here?s calling all gossip mongers to do a chatter 

check in the colourful corners at your workplace. For if you are not entwined 

with the grapevine, you are likely to be dropped off the radar and into the dark 

oblivion of solitary confinement. So, let?s chat...

Wash words

You sneaked umpteenth trips to the loo as a kid to 

bunk classes or to bully that sissy. Nature?s call is not the only reason why 

this room beckons now, either. The washroom is still the best place to catch up 

on the latest in office and beyond as reflexes are relaxed and scandals come tumbling 

out. 

so a good place to indulge in some same-sex bonding, 

which makes it just the place to exchange notes on that cute guy in office or 

catch the latest update on who?s dating whom. Just make sure you don?t let out 

too many of those loo secrets and get left out of the loop.

Talking points?

 A to B: ?Heard, C is seeing D?s boyfriend??

 B to A: ?And E dumped F to two-time with G 

and H, howzzat?!?

 Corridor cram

If you haven?t found much use of the office corridors 

beyond entry and exit points, you haven?t exploited its immense potential yet. 

It is just the place to make eye contact with the dashing intern away from the 

strict gaze of the boss. So, the next time you pass them by, don?t pretend like 

you haven?t noticed.

Hanging out in the corridors on your way in or out 

of work is also a good way to eavesdrop on inter-departmental banter, without 

being accused of stretching the lunch hour too far!

Talking points?

 X to Y: ?Howdy, you new around here??

 Y to X: ?Yeah, been there and done that with 

Altd, Bcorp and Ctech though, how about you??

Canteen crave

If you?re blessed with an office canteen, there?s 

no forgiveness for missing out on the spicy nuggets doing the rounds in office 

and beyond, unless you choose to go tone deaf!

The college canteen was the place where time stood 

still between endless rounds of steaming cuppas and never-ending adda. The office 

cafeteria is best treated as a dynamic retreat to grab a quick bite along with 

an extra helping of power talk to make up for the breakfast news you missed. What 

makes the canteen especially delectable is that it provides for everybody ? from 

the hot-headed union leader to the cool observer, quietly gorging on all the gossip 

around.

Talking points?

 P to Q: ?Looks like a promotion?s due for M??

 Q to P: ?Sure is easy if you get N to do the 

dirty work for you and take all the credit yourself. You know what I?m talking 

about, don?t you??

Bar barrage

Being a regular to the neighbourhood bar is a must 

to appear ?with it?. Also a good place to meet industry insiders and crack a good 

deal or two along with jokes at the boss? expense! 

And if you want to glean that secret out of the boss? 

pet, lead them down to the watering hole and watch the unsuspecting bloke melt 

and mumble. 

Just keep your fingers crossed that the boss doesn?t 

decide to play Sherlock Holmes while you are at it!

Talking points?

 R to S: ?You sure know good book-keeping dude. 

What?s the secret??

 S to R: ?Drip some honey and watch the old 

man surrender, sweetly!?

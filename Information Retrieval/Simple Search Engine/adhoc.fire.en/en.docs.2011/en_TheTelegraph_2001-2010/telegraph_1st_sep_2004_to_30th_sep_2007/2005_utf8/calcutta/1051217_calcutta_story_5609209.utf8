 Certain stretches of the narrow footpath along the southern flank of AJC Bose Road, from Ballygunge Circular Road to Sarat Bose Road, are in a deplorable condition after being dug up by various public utility agencies. Ever since the construction of the flyover, this footpath has been a headache for pedestrians. To avoid the uneven sidewalk, people have taken to walking on the road instead. Will the civic body wait for a few mishaps to happen before reacting to the problem?

 Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore. 

 On December 8, when I was on my way to drop my granddaughters to school, two private buses, racing against each other, brushed past my car near Bhabani Bhavan. We narrowly escaped an accident. The city traffic police are still lax about checking such speed thrills among the private buses. They need to act fast or there will be blood on the streets every day.

 During a recent visit to a relative?s house at Serampore, I found the streets of the town overrun with a sizeable canine population. The dogs have a run of each and every lane and bylane. Many of them were not in good health and some were very violent. The municipality should carry out drives to sterilise and vaccinate street dogs in the area so that their population stays under control. 

 Prantik Sanyal,

 SP Mukherjee Road.

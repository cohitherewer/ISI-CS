 Stress cry in suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The family of Sumit Mullick, 45-year-old engineer from Calcutta who committed suicide in a Jamshedpur hotel on Saturday, has blamed pressures at the workplace for his death.

 Mullick?s mother, brother and wife reached Jamshedpur on Sunday to receive the body. The family lives on Russa Road. Mullick had been working with a private company.

 ?Non-cooperation of company officials had forced him to think of quitting the job and moving to Pune,? claimed Mullick?s wife Rita. 

 ?He, however, did not disclose who were putting pressure on him,? she added.

 Police have ordered an inquiry on the basis of the family?s charges.

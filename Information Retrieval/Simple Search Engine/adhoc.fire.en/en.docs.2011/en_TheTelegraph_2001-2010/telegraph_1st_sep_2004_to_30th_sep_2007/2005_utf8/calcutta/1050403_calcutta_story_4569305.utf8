The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Recommends

 THE DVD

 (Landmark, Rs 600) He may have been a failed opera singer, 

 but Meat Loaf has had his share of fame and fans. This intimate 

 concert sees him taking the audience through his most popular 

 songs, including I?d do anything for love (but I won?t 

 do that), Rock and roll dreams come through and 

 Bat out of hell. Bonus: 53 minutes of extra footage.

 THE EXHIBITION

 (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, April 6 to May 

 11, 2 pm to 7 pm daily) Belonging to the most influential 

 authors of contemporary German photography, Moses partly 

 positions himself in the tradition of German portrait-photography. 

 The exhibition, displaying 46 of his selected photographs, 

 will be inaugurated on April 6 at 6 pm by Erhard Zander, 

 consul general of the Federal Republic of Germany. 

 THE RACE

 (STAR 

 Sports, April 3, 5.30 pm) After Narain Karthikeyan?s fast 

 drives at Melbourne and Kuala Lumpur, the focus now shifts 

 to Bahrain for the year?s third Formula One. While the Indian 

 in the yellow Jordan tries to improve on his position, it?s 

 need for speed for Michael Schumacher, though, as he gets 

 ready to slip into a brand new scarlet Ferrari, the 2005 car.

Life

 Still singing a soulful song

 Music Zone

 After 25 years in the world of geet and ghazal, PANKAJ UDHAS is on a roll with yet another album and a world tour, says Pratim D. Gupta 

 Pankaj Udhas, seen in the picture above during one of his Calcutta trips, will visit the city as part of his all-India concert tour 

 Its his silver jubilee year in the world of music and Pankaj Udhas is leaving no note unturned to make it special. For the past 25 years, I have taken a lot of pain in making the ghazal form popular amongst the audiences. And here in an industry where people come and go, I have been fortunate enough to survive all these years. So I really want to make this year special, he said from Mumbai.

 So first up is Pankajs new album, which comes after a gap of one-and-a-half years. Its totally different from my last album, In Search of Mir, which was dedicated to the poet Mir Taqi Mir, who used to write 250 years ago. The new album is called Hasrat, which means desire in Urdu. It is very much a Pankaj Udhas album that cuts across all ages and is for everyone between 16 and 60 years of age.

 The songs in Hasrat have been scored by Nikhil-Vinay, known for their compositions in Sonu Nigams early Indipop albums and the Anubhav Sinha hit Tum Bin.

 They have given some really great music for the ghazals and geets, says Pankaj. The poetry is by some new people in the arena. The best thing about the album is the tremendous variety. Two videos are already playing on air and the response has been quite good.

 Next up in the 25-year celebrations is a global tour covering almost every big country on the world map. I want to personally go and thank people, show my gratitude to them. I have already visited Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Then there will be tours to UK and the rest of Europe and also West Indies and America. Finally, Ill go to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. After the world audience is thanked, Pankaj will embark on a 25-city concert tour in India around October-November.

 Once the live performances are taken care of, Pankaj will release his long-in-the-making album with the late Ananda Shankar. He has been instrumental in starting fusion music back in the 60s and 70s. But he has always recorded instrumental albums. I have actually sung his tunes with some wonderful poetry. Its quite mindblowing in terms of content. We had recorded the album together but its only now that we are releasing it.

 Apart from this album, Pankaj plans to release a DVD of his live concerts some time in October.

 Amidst all the rejoicing there is some regret, too. I had taken a lot of pain in making ghazal expand from 1,000 to 10,000 people, says Pankaj. But now, the focus has shifted completely. There is again a gap that has been created by the younger generation and the electronic media is not helping matters at all. They are not promoting this kind of music.

 He is angry with Bollywood, too. The film and its music industry are vicious circles. They have reduced music to just some item numbers. They do not know how to use music and songs effectively. There has always been a positive scope for my kind of music in films. I think songs like Jeeye to jeeye kaise (Saajan) and Chitthi ayee hai (Naam) helped in taking the story forward? These days, I do not like singing in Hindi films.

 With Bollywood a no-no, it is the world of Indipop music where Pankaj continues to enthral select audiences across the world.

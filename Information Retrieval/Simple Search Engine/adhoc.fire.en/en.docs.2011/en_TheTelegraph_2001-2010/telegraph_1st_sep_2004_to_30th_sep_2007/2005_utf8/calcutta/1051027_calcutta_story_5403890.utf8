 Two brothers drown on way to school

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two brothers, on their way to school, died when they went to a pond for a wash and slipped into it. The incident took place at Brahmapur, in the Regent Park area, around 9 am. 

 Somnath Jana, 12, and Rabi Jana, 10, were students of a local primary school. While Rabi?s body has been found, cops are yet to trace Somnath.

 ?The parents had no clue about the incident till late in the evening, when they turned up at school in search of their children. The teachers told them the two had not been spotted either in school or in the locality. That prompted the parents to come to the police station,? said an officer of Regent Park police station.

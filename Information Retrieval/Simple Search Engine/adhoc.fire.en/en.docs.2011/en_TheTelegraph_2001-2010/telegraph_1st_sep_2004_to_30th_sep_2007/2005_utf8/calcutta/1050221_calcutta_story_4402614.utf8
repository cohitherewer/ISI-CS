The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Whistle-stop Sania in skipper chant

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 The Team India skipper has been as full-blooded in her praise as he is in his lofted drives.

 On Sunday, Sania Mirza, the new pin-up icon in the Indian sporting scene, responded with a volley of compliments on Sourav?s home turf.

 ?I wonder how he handles the tremendous pressures of being the cricket captain. The fans and the media are so demanding!? exclaimed Sania, while tucking into succulent portions of Gosht ke Panje, Reshmi Kebab and her favourite biryani.

 ?Food is my weakness and I am strictly a non-vegetarian,? she told admirers and mediapersons during a sumptuous lunch at Sourav?s ? the captain?s multiplex restaurant on Park Street ? with younger sister Anam, father Imran and mother Naseema. 

 Sania, who had a photo-shoot at Prince of Cal, was bowled over by the lounge bar.

 More than her culinary preferences, what shone through during Sania?s whistle-stop visit to Sourav?s city was the mutual admiration they have for each other, evident at the Siliguri tsunami fundraiser, where Bhaichung Bhutia shared the dais with them.

 Sania and Sourav were greeted by hordes of fans and jostling photographers at Sealdah station in the morning as they arrived from Siliguri on the Darjeeling Mail with the Mirza family.

 Sania, in smart track pants and long-sleeved T-shirt, didn?t betray any signs of fatigue as she stepped off the train. 

 But those waiting through an hour-long delay to get up-close with the tennis star and Dada were left stranded on the baseline as the duo, along with Sania?s family, were whisked away amidst tight security.

 The next port of public call for the Hyderabad high-flyer was the Calcutta Muslim Orphanage, in Shariff Lane, off Ripon Street. 

 It was love-all as Sania, now in a traditional brown salwar-kameez and accompanied by former Indian Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali, spent 45 minutes with the orphan girls.

 ?I consider myself very small, but if I can in any way inspire you through my success, I would think I have achieved something meaningful in life,? she said, willingly obliging autograph and photograph-seekers.

 She also handed over a token donation for the orphanage to Md Salim, minister for minorities welfare. ?It is really nice to see how these girls are being taught to fend for themselves,? said a touched Sania. 

 Prior to that, at a brief meet-the-press at her hotel, most of the passing shots were, again, praises for the Indian skipper?s ability to handle pressure.

 ?This past month, I have been hounded by fans and the media and it?s extremely tough to cope with the glare. But Sourav handles it with such poise!? she gushed. 

 Father Imran disclosed that Sania was desperately looking for a foreign coach and that her endorsement with Sahara was ?more or less finalised?. Details of her other deals would be made public soon, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wilt shadow on wallets 

Late rains and yield pains

 - Seared standing crops nudging vegetable prices upwards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The searing heat is about to claim its next victims ? your wallet and menu.

 With the monsoon being delayed by 10 days already, prices of vegetables are bound to rise, warn officials of the state agricultural department. The prices of lady?s finger (bhindi), rich gourd (jhinga), snake gourd (chichinga), parwal, gourd (lau), pumpkin and bitter gourd (karela) are expected to shoot up.

 ?The standing crop of vegetables and greens is being affected by the long dry spell and the heat wave. There are chances that some of this crop will be damaged,? said D. Konar, director of agriculture, on Friday at Writers? Buildings.

 While districts in north Bengal have received rain and are faring comparatively well, much of south Bengal has been badly affected by the heat wave. Districts like North 24-Parganas, Nadia, Hooghly, Murshidabad and Burdwan account for a majority of Calcutta?s green vegetable supply.

 ?The monsoon usually arrives by June 8 to 10. Since the crops are not getting rainwater, farmers will have to spend an additional amount on irrigation. This will further push up prices of vegetables,? said Konar.

 Already, prices are nudging their way upwards at Kolay market in Sealdah, Gariahat market, New Market and College Street market.

 ?The prices of parwal, lady?s finger, green chilli and brinjal have gone up by between Rs 2 and Rs 5. Vegetables like gourd are virtually vanishing from the market, since they grow on tender vines, which are wilting in the scorching heat,? said a vegetable trader at Kolay market.

 Officials are asking farmers not sow crops till it rains. ?We are asking farmers to reserve some seeds for when the rains are regular to prevent a bad yield,? explained Konar.

 Quality has already become a concern. ?For the past seven days, we are surviving on parwal and potatoes. The quality of vegetables like pumpkin, lady?s finger and jhinga is abysmal,? said Mitali Chowdhury, a Gariahat housewife.

 The government will wait for another 20 days before declaring a drought situation. ?Our farming has been delayed and disturbed due to the late rainfall. However, we hope the monsoon will arrive in a week?s time,? said Konar.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Homoeopath Bholanath Chakraborty passed away in his Howrah home on Thursday. He was 80 and is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

 The family said the physician had been suffering from cardio-respiratory problems for the past seven months. The end came at 4.30 pm. 

 His final rites will be performed at the Shibpur crematorium on Friday.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee and former parliamentarian Tapan Sikdar visited the Chakraborty residence and conveyed their condolences.

 Chakraborty was born on August 26, 1925, at his maternal uncle?s house in Hooghly?s Chinsurah. He completed his B.Sc from the University of Calcutta in 1946. 

 He bagged his DMS degree from Calcutta Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital in 1950; and held degrees in homoeopathy from the Faculty of Homeopathic Medicine, London and Coombe Hospital, Dublin.

 Chakraborty received a string of awards during his lifetime for his contribution to homoeopathy.

 The physician?s list of patients can read like a who?s who. It includes former leaders Prafulla Chandra Sen, Atulya Ghosh, Nurul Hasan, actor Amitabh Bachchan, singer Lata Mangeshkar, actresses Supriya Devi and Suchitra Sen and skipper Sourav Ganguly.

 Safety boost at tech hub

 A STAFF REPORTER

 To improve security in Salt Lake?s Sector V, police will hold special training sessions for the security guards working in offices in the IT hub.

 The cops will also collect information about the security system in place in each of the IT and BPO companies.

 The guards will be trained in crisis-handling, reading telltale signs of danger, taking appropriate measures in case a crime is spotted from a distance and intervention if the employees are manhandled or detained by criminals.

 The first-of-its-kind training will be imparted by senior police officers. The security guards will also be provided with training in their offices. 

 The decision was taken on Wednesday at a meeting between representatives of the IT organisations and district police chief Parveen Kumar. General manager of WEBEL Subrata Majumder and the joint secretary of the urban development department were also present. 

 ?Only training is not enough. We would like to have the details of the security guards on duty at night so that we can keep an eye on them. Even they would feel reassured with the police around. It would be great if the companies provide us with detailed lists,? Kumar said. 

 It was decided at Wednesday?s meeting that stretches of the roads within Sector V and those leading to it would be done up on an emergency basis. 

 Streetlights will be installed and debris removed to ensure free movement of traffic. Night vigil in the area will also be beefed up. 

 The police have urged the IT companies to offer employees to help them in traffic management in the zone during rush hour.

 ?One of the ways to manage traffic better is to induct more personnel, but it would be good if the companies spare us some of their employees,? Kumar explained.

 It was announced at the meeting that the government was planning to set up a parking lot with a food mart in Sector V.

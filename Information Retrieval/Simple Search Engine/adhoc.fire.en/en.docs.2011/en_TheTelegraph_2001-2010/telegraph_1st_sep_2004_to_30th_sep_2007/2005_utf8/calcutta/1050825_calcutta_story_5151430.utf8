 At the Frankfurt Book Fair: A key platform for communication, a growing market for trade

 Book-reading sessions and networking meets for translators, speed-dating between publishers and film producers, theme-based forums for exhibitors to use as venues for their events, arts and culture carousels?

 There could be a significant slice of Calcutta at the Frankfurt Book Fair next year, as the city gets a rare chance to showcase not only its fabled romance with the written word, but its multifaceted contemporary persona to a focused global audience.

 India will be the Guest of Honour country at the Frankfurt Book Fair 2006 and the authorities of the world?s ?biggest marketplace for ideas, books, electronic media and the international rights trade? feel it presents a unique opportunity for India?s cultural capital to underline its core and nascent strengths.

 ?We are aware of Calcutta?s passion for books and have been swayed by the energy of the city?s own unique open-air book fair,? says Claudia Kaiser, director international department, Frankfurter Buchmesse. She is on a three-city Indian tour to promote the Frankfurt Book Fair, which has a history dating back 500 years.

 With around 1,800 exhibitors from Anglophone countries, Frankfurt Book Fair is the biggest event of its kind for the English-speaking world. 

 Besides being an important platform for communication, it is also of steadily growing importance for trade in rights and licences. 

 ?It is the most important public event in the domain of books, offering a wonderful stage to trade, network, learn and exchange ideas. We feel Calcutta, with its myriad tapestry of literary and cultural accomplishments, can be a strong component in India?s performance in Frankfurt,? Kaiser adds.

 The fair authorities will provide a 2,000-sq-m space for the India pavilion to host cultural events, while a separate enclosure will be set aside for the publishers. The Frankfurter Buchmesse uses its foreign office funds to invite 40 to 50 publishers from different countries and each gets a stand to display its books.

 ?It?s a marvellous avenue for the small publishers to hawk their wares in the world market, because Frankfurt is a very important trade hub in Europe and many of the visitors at the book fair are opinion-makers,? observes Martin W?elde, director, Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB), Calcutta.

 MMB, which is working closely with the Frankfurter Buchmesse to make the Indian show a ?huge success?, is keen on substantial Calcutta participation at the string of arts, culture and music shows all over Frankfurt planned around the book fair.

 ?India is very much the flavour in Germany now, with Bonn also planning an India theatre festival, and Calcutta could make the most of this opportunity in Frankfurt next year. However, it?s most important to showcase what?s contemporary and not harp just on history and folklore,? stresses W?elde.

 In 2004, over 270,000 visitors from across the world converged on Frankfurt to view the collections of 6,691 exhibitors and 79 national and collective exhibitions from 110 countries, featuring more than 350,000 titles alongside book-related products and services. 

 The fair authorities expect the numbers to grow further this year, with Korea the Guest of Honour country.

 Besides, The Frankfurt Rights Catalogue is the world?s biggest rights and licences database, offering around 19,000 titles with extensive bibliographic details, cover illustrations, information on rights and contact partners in the publishing companies and agencies.

 ?Besides our theme-based forums and films/TV centre, the translator centres we launched at the 2003 edition have also been received extremely well. They provide the much-needed opportunity to book translators to hook up with each other and voice their opinion,? says Kaiser.

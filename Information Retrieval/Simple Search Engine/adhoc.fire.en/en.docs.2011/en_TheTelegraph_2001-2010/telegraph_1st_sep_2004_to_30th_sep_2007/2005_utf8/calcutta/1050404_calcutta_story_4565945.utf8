 Surrealistic visions

 A blend of imagination and poetic fantasy animates the enchanted world created by the paintings of Bidyut Ghosh. The ongoing exhibition of his works witnesses the young artist attempting to refine his expressions of the world through objective impressions born of a mature social consciousness and sensitivity. Yet, a magical, mysterious quality characterises his paintings, fusing realism with figments of dream-like illusions to project a view of life that is at once familiar and imaginary. On his artistic journey, Ghosh mostly traverses across complex, urban terrain, evolving a racy, cosmopolitan visual imagery, loaded with symbolic meanings. Female forms, infused with an almost eerie sensuality, are common to most of his works, signifying mental and moral associations with diverse concepts like romance, idealism, liberation, power, temptation and even concern for the environment.

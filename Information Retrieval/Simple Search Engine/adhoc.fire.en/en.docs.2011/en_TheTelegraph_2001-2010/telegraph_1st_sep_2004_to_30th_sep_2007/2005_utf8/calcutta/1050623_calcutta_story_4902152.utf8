The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School in growth fast lane

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It began in Pune five years ago. Now, expansion in the fast lane is the motto for International School of Business and Media (ISBM). Having set up shop with 66 students in Calcutta in 2004, this year the new admissions were 100. In addition, more space in a new building has been acquired and new courses added.

 Two new campuses, in Delhi and Bangalore, are in the process of being launched. And future plans include branches of the institute in the US, UK and China in the next couple of years. ?In fact, we are in talks to acquire a private university in the US,? said Pramod Kumar, founder-president of ISBM. The plans for Calcutta include ?one big campus soon?.

 The new course launched last year is the three-year undergraduate BBA degree. Another addition this year is a B.Tech in information technology, in association with Allahabad Agricultural Institute (deemed university). ?We want to consolidate the courses and build on the reputation before we start any more,? added Kumar, in town for the orientation ceremony of ISBM?s new batch.

 Although the first batch of the Calcutta branch will graduate in 2006, 100 per cent placement for students is a record the institute plans to keep. Helping to achieve that is eight-month placements with reputed organisations like ICICI bank, LG electronics, DSP Merrill Lynch, STAR News, CNBC and even on the production team for Mira Nair?s The Namesake.

 ?Our institute in Calcutta is very cosmopolitan, with students from Nagpur, Raipur, Kanpur, Bangalore, Lucknow, Jamshedpur, Bhubaneswar and other cities,? observed Kumar. ?We plan to increase the number of students regularly, but the selection process is very meticulous. We have also added several faculty members this year.?

 An interesting point, he added, was that while the management courses (Rs 3.5 lakh for two years) have almost three-fourths male students, the media courses (Rs 2.5 lakh for two years) are brimming with girls.

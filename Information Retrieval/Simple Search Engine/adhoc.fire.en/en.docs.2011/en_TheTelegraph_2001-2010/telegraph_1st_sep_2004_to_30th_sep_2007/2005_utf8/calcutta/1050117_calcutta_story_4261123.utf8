 Bitter new year for Bollywood

 - January jinx grips tinsel trade as new releases elicit lukewarm response

 It?s the lull after the storm. After a bright end to Bollywood 2004 in the form of big hits like Veer-Zaara, Mughal-e-Azam and Hulchul, the January jinx has struck again, leaving the industry and theatres reeling under the reel rout.

 Over the years, the first month of the calendar has proved to be the cruellest month for the tinsel trade. What?s been worse is that unlike last January, even the old releases were unable to sustain their success in the New Year.

 ?It?s been a very average month,? says a spokesperson for INOX. ?All the new films have had very bad initials. Even the Veer-Zaaras and Swadeses have stagnated, unlike in 2004, when Baghban and Kal Ho Naa Ho were continuing the good work months after their 2003 releases.?

 Festive fatigue, reopening of schools and colleges and no big releases have added up to cine-goers steering clear. The lull has also forced Bollywood biggies to push back their releases ? Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black to February 4 and Dharmesh Darshan?s Bewafaa to February 18 ? to avoid the January flop juggernaut. ?It can be superstition on their part,? says Arijit Dutta, president of EIMPA. 

 Of the January releases, while the Shahid Kapur-starrer Dil Maange More sank to the slogan controversy, Pooja Bhatt?s Rog and Vashu Bhagnani?s Vaada collected less than 60 per cent in their first week at the city multiplexes. 

 As for last Friday?s releases, Elaan and Insan, a cumulative star count of Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan, John Abraham, Arjun Rampal and Mithun Chakraborty hasn?t had any effect on the till. ?The openings of the two films have been very average,? is the verdict from the city multiplexes. ?These days, stars do not guarantee anything,? says Pooja Bhatt. ?At least I failed on my own terms.? 

 All eyes are now on Subhash Ghai?s Kisna, which releases this Friday and hopes to defy the January jinx. ?It should open big, with the showman returning after a gap of two-and-a-half years,? says Prashant Srivastava of 89 Cinemas. 

 If the ?warrior with the flute? saga does the same magic for Kisna as it did for Ghai?s Hero, Bollywood can open its account this year.

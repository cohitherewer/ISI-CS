The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eye donation, free cremation

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 An eye-opener for the nation ? the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is planning to exempt cremation fees for those who donate their eyes.

 The proposal was placed before mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya on Wednesday by the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, which functions under the state health department, and the NGO Swajan.

 ?The idea is acceptable, as the exemption will encourage people to pledge their eyes. We will be happy to make our contribution to the cause. Some incentive and honour should be given to those who pledge their eyes,? the mayor told Metro on Thursday.

 The final nod, however, will be given after the mayoral council approves of the proposal.

 If the go-ahead comes, the corporation will be the first civic body in the country to take such a bold step in encouraging eye donation. 

 Himadri Dutta, of the ophthalmology institute, said that in a state which lags behind several others in eye donation, the proposal is aimed at honouring those who pledge their eyes. ?We hope others will follow their example.?

 The proposal seeks ?total exemption? of the cremation costs for those who have pledged their eyes to the eye bank of the institute. The relatives of the deceased will have to produce the certificate of donation for getting the charges waived. 

 Information relating to eye donation and the forms will be available from medical units of the civic body in various wards. Besides, the corporation has been asked to put up posters and billboards across the city, including at the crematoriums.

 The information and public relations department and the health department of the civic body will work in tandem with the institute in creating awareness about eye donation.

 Bhaskar Sinha, head of Swajan, said: ?There is a lack of awareness among the people on the subject. Our proposal is aimed at furthering the cause of eye donation.? 

 The organisation, along with the ophthalmology institute, has been working on an awareness programme at Medical College and Hospital.

 The level of awareness in some other states may be higher than in Bengal, but the national average is far from satisfactory. Against a requirement of around 200,000 corneas a year, only around 21,000 are collected.

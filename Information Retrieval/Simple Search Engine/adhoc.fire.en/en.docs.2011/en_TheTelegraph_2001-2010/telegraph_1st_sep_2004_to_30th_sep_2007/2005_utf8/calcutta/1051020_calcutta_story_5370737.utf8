 Park Circus open bids to boost coffer

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic parks and gardens department has decided to go for open bidding to let out the Park Circus Maidan to circus companies.

 Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan explained on Wednesday that the civic body?s income from the patch of green would increase manifold if it introduced open bids, instead of negotiating with middlemen of circus companies, as is the practice now. 

 The other proposal to boost revenue, he pointed out, is to raise the charge for hiring out the park by at least three times. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation now earns Rs 2.2 lakh a year by letting out the Park Circus grounds to circus companies. 

 The grounds have traditionally been the venue for circuses in December and January. Four companies had applied to the civic authorities to use the grounds this year, but two of them later withdrew from the fray.

 Khan is also hoping that trade fair this year will be hosted on the Park Circus grounds.

 Following the high court ban on organising fairs on the 1,950-bigha Maidan and the civic body?s decision to set up Citizens? Park there, Khan thinks the 65-bigha Park Circus grounds are the next biggest and the only available open space with a well-connected communication network.

 The Trinamul Congress, however, criticised Khan?s plans, pointing out that fairs and circuses would make the enclosed grounds out of bounds for children.

 ?The Left Front board has turned out to be a baniya. Its main objective is to earn money, not to serve the people. Circus is a sick industry and the board is doing no good by raising the charges,? pointed out leader of the Opposition Javed Ahmed Khan.

 Trinamul Congress chief whip Anup Chatterjee said: ?The CPM, before the polls, had promised better business to new entertainment centres along the EM Bypass. That is why the board is charging money for pujas in parks and is planning a hike in charges from circus companies.?

 The parks and gardens wing has started preparing a list of community pujas in CMC parks that were organised without obtaining clearance from the authorities. 

 Seven such pujas have been identified in north Calcutta alone. 

 These are Chorbagan Sarbojanin, Shraddhananda Park Sarbojanin, Jorabagan Sarbojain, Jorabagan Chhatra Samhati, CIT Park Young Blood, Girish Park Hindu Mahasabha Puja and Girish Park Sarbojanin.

 Community pujas were held in 81 parks belonging to the CMC and around half of them did not have the approval of the authorities.

 ?We will inform the local thanas about the unauthorised pujas, so that police can take steps against them when they approach the authorities for puja permission next year,? said mayoral council member Khan.

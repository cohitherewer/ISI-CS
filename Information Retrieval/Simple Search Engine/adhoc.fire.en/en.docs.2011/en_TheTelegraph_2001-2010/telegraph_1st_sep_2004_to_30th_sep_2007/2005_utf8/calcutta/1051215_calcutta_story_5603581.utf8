 Aamar jibon ekhon dance aar dance, says an ecstatic Pompi Mondal from her home in Birati. And why not? The 15-year-old has come out on top of the nationwide dance contest on STAR Plus, Kaboom. In the finals, to be telecast this Saturday at 8 pm, Pompi will be adjudged joint winner with Mumbai girl Swapnali Kadam.

 ?I have been dancing for the last four years,? Pompi tells Metro, hesitant to reveal and rejoice with three days still to go. ?I have learnt ?modern dance? from Master Kutty and throughout I have been only into solo dancing. I never wanted to get lost in a crowd.?

 Kaboom is not Pompi?s first triumph at a dance hunt. She had won the mega finals of Sony?s Boogie Woogie in 2003 and even taken part in Item Bomb on Zee TV in 2004. ?My age was a bit too much for Item Bomb and so I lost out. But now there?s no looking back.?

 In the finals, Pompi was not the only Calcuttan vying for the crown. Prosenjit Biswas and Neha Marda were two others from the city to make it to the Top Five. Before the finals, all the aspirants had gone through a rigorous training programme under choreographer Ahmed Khan.

 But there was a surprise in store for the Kaboom finalists when none other than Sridevi appeared alongside Prabhudeva and Javed Jaffery to judge the last round. ?I couldn?t have imagined in my wildest dreams that Sridevi will watch me perform,? gushes Pompi. ?After my performance to the song Lucky lips, she said that she had never seen a girl perform break dance like me before.?

 It?s not Sridevi, but main Madhuri Dixit banna chahti hoon for Pompi. ?Aami acting korteo khub bhalo pari. So I want to be a dancing actress like Madhuri. I am planning to shift base to Mumbai as soon as possible,? the voice, full of dreams, trails off.

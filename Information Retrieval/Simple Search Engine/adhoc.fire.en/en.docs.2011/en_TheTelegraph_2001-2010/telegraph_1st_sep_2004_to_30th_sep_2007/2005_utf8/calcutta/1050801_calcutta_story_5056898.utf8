 Soon, sunlight for security

 - Electronic system to protect shrines in remote places

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 If you feel insecure in a place of worship in some remote area, post-Akshardham, you need not lose your sleep. 

 A state-of-the-art security system is just about to hit the market, courtesy the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA). 

 Buoyed by a string of success in reaching out to the masses in remote corners with the solar electricity model, the WBREDA has now come up with a mechanism aimed at providing security to temples and shrines in far-away places and rural pockets. 

 The solar energy-driven electronic system can be connected to the nearest police station or any other security agency to ensure immediate cover in case of any emergency, including an attack.

 ?The uniqueness of the system lies in the fact that you don?t need any electrical connection to run it. There is no need to man it either. The entire system will be powered by solar panels which will, in turn, charge up electronic systems. These electronic systems will maintain security over a certain campus,? said S.P. Gan Chowdhury, special secretary of the power department and director of WBREDA.

 The system, according to insiders, has been devised keeping in mind several shrines and archaeological sites, along with other precious assets of several key departments, including the ones of the meteorological departments located in remote areas.

 ?Let?s take the example of a Met office situated about 1,000 feet above the ground on a hilltop. If providing manpower round-the-clock is a problem, this system will be of immense help,? explained Gan Chowdhury.

 ?Even if it is installed, say 500 feet below, it will detect any unauthorised entry and will be able to ring an alarm bell or send a signal to the nearest police station or security agency,? explained an officer of the department.

 The entire system consists of some electronic devices, connected to the power systems charged by solar or any other renewable energy-based power generators. Thin copper or iron strings will be placed around the complex to be covered. If anyone touches or even stumbles upon this wall, the system will immediately send alarm signals,? added the WBREDA officer. 

 A detailed model of the system has been prepared and will be displayed soon. 

 ?There is already a model displayed in the Energy Park for viewers,? Gan Chowdhury claimed.

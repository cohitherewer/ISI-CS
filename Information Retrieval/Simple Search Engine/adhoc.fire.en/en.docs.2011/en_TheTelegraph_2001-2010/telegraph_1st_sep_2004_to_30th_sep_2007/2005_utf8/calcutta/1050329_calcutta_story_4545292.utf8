 Curry-culum, or how to cook up a chef

 SUBHRO SAHA

 How to select, prepare and cook meat or seafood. How to control and order stock. How to implement food-safety procedures.

 For the clutch of new restaurants opening up in town almost every month and for the existing ones going in for expansion, one of the biggest recipe roadblocks is finding cooks and chefs with ready kitchen skills.

 A change is finally simmering in the culinary cauldron. KK?s Regency Culinary Academy, ?Calcutta?s first exclusive commercial cookery institute?, set up in technical collaboration with Regency International Centre for Hospitality, Leisure and Food Studies, Adelaide, will open its Salt Lake campus this June.

 ?In Calcutta, there is a definite dearth of trained kitchen personnel. Every new place that opens is feeling the pinch, often having to woo crack chefs from star hotels with fat pay-packets. This one-year course is dedicated to churning out cooks and chefs primed to join the industry on passing out,? says Pradip Rozario, formerly executive chef of the Taj Group of Hotels, Mumbai, and technical director of the academy.

 The curriculum has been designed to provide students with immediately usable skills in both a commercial kitchen as well as in kitchen management, according to Michael Hogenbirk, executive manager of the Adelaide-based Regency Institute TAFE. Regency International, part of the Regency Institute of TAFE complex, is the ?key provider of vocational education and training in Australia with its world-class curriculum in various fields of hospitality management?.

 The initial batch of 20 students will participate in a competency-based training programme that covers both practical and theoretical kitchen subjects. Course material will come from the Australian collaborator, which will also send visiting faculty to train local teachers at the Salt Lake academy.

 ?It?s a positive step that will add instant value to the city?s burgeoning restaurant trade, faced with a severe shortage of trained cooks and chefs,? says S.K. Khullar, owner of Amber and senior vice-president, Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India.

 The course will comprise varieties of Asian and Continental cookery, including management and health aspects. Live kitchen training will be provided at K.K.?s Fusion, the world cuisine restaurant next to 89 Cinemas owned by chef Rozario, and ?focused attention? will be given to industry exposure for the students in reputed hotel and restaurant establishments.

 On completion of the course, students will be assisted in procuring placements both in India and abroad, Rozario promises. ?Most diploma students passing out of catering colleges make a beeline for the star hotels and a standalone restaurant is always a second option for them. While a Taj or an Oberoi would have its captive institute, smaller places are made to languish for want of adequate skilled hands in the kitchen, quot; he says.

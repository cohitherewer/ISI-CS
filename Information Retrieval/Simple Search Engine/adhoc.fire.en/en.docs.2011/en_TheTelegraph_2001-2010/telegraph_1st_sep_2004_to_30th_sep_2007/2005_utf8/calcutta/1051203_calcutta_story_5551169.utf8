 High-fibre diet for Bachchan complaint

 When Rima Choudhury, 52, was wheeled into a city hospital a week ago with acute abdominal pain, which later turned out to be diverticulitis, little did she know that a few days later, Amitabh Bachchan, too, would fall prey to the disease.

 For decades, diverticulitis was known as ?sahebder rog? ? a disease common among Westerners for their consumption of low-fibre diet. But with more and more Calcuttans taking to western lifestyle and food habits, diverticulitis is not that rare in the city now. 

 The disease, however, is still considered ?elitist?, as almost no cases have been reported from among the lower middle class in the city and its adjoining areas. It was first widely reported in Britain and the USA in the late 1890s and early 1900s, when the rage for processed food peaked.

 ?Unheard of in the city till a few years ago, we are receiving at least a case a month these days and at times, even two cases,? said Mahesh Goenka, head of the gastroenterology department of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.

 Diverticulitis is caused when the walls of the large or small intestine weaken because of an increasing spasm and give away, forming small pouches on either side. The pouches are called diverticula and each is filled with stool and other toxic substances, which can cause perforations in the wall of the intestine.

 This can lead to fluid spilling into the peritonium or abdomen (what happened to Bachchan), causing infection and formation of abscess.

 Diverticulitis occurs when the pouches become infected or inflamed and cause pain around the left side of the lower abdomen, exactly where Bachchan felt a pain a few days ago while attending a conference in Lucknow.

 At times, the disease takes a serious turn, with bleeding and blockages. Bleeding occurs when a small blood vessel in a diverticulum bursts.

 ?Blood comes out with stool and the scarring caused by infection may cause partial or total blockage in the large intestine. Bowel movements get affected as the colon does not function, necessitating an operation,? said surgical gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi.

 The infection can also cause cancer, as constipation, one of the causes of diverticula, has a cancer-triggering effect. ?Although rare, cancer cannot be ruled out, but generally diverticulitis can be treated with antibiotics and surgery,? added De Bakshi.

 Doctors blame bad food habits for diverticulitis. ?I have not come across any patient who consumes fibre-rich diet regularly and has still fallen prey to the disease. We have been advising patients to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits and not indulge in processed food,? Goenka added.

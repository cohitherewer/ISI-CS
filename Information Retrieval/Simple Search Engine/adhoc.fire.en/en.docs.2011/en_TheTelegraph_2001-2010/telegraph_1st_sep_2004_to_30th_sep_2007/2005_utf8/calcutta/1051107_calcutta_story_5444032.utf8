 Clueless about break-in

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The police remained clueless on Sunday about a break-in, allegedly last Friday, at a multi-storeyed apparels and accessories store at Gariahat.

 Praveen Agarwal, owner of the outlet Prapti, lodged a complaint with police, claiming a break-in had occurred at his outlet at 14/1, Gariahat Road and Rs 1.52 lakh in cash was missing, police said on Sunday. No arrest has been made so far.

 The toilet window was broken to gain access into the outlet. After cleaning out the cash locker on the ground floor, the same window was used as the escape route. 

 The toilet window overlooks Gariahat Road and is clearly visible from the road. A police team patrols the entire area at night. However, no one was seen either scaling the wall or breaking the window grille and entering the shop.

 The 7,000-sq-ft outlet is crammed with branded garments and fashion accessories. 

 In the inner office, high-end mobile phones, costing between Rs 20,000 and Rs 40,000, are kept, as the owner has five cellular phone outlets in the city. One phone outlet is adjacent to his garment outlet.

 ?We don?t know whether other valuables were taken. We are yet to check the stock,? said Anuja Agarwal, wife of Praveen and executive director of Prapti. Deputy commissioner of police (south) N. Ramesh Babu said a probe has been launched.

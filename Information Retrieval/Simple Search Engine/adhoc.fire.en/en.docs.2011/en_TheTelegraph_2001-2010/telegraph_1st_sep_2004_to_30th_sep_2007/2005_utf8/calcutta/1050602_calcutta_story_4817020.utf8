 RESHMI SENGUPTA

 Tanmoy Bose and Anoushka Shankar 

 Paul McCartneys high profile annual concert for a cause, Adopt-a-Minefield, featured two Indian musicians this season. On May 28, city-based tabla exponent Tanmoy Bose and sitar player Anoushka Shankar graced the Sofotel Hotel banquet hall in Dusseldorf alongside McCartney and Cat Stevens (now Yusuf Islam).

 Tanmoy and Anoushka opened Saturdays soiree with a raagmala based on raag manjh khamaj, which went on for about half-an-hour. Those who sat in the audience musing on the music included tennis great Boris Becker. 

 It was very rewarding for me to play at such a prestigious event. After us, Paul performed some of his compositions along with Stevens, said Tanmoy from the US.

 The concert-cum-gala dinner was followed by an auction of McCartneys guitar and other memorabilia, the proceeds from which will go to the Adopt-a-Minefield project. The organisation works to raise awareness about landmines and their victims.

 McCartney and wife Heather Mills, who hosted the event, are patrons of Adopt-a-Minefield, which works in collaboration with the UN. Since 2001, the Beatles star has played a crucial role in drawing global attention to the plight of landmine survivors.

 Five years ago, McCartney started off the annual concert with Paul Simon on stage. Among the other musicians who have performed for McCartney and his cause are Stephen Stills of Crossby, Stills and Nash, Brian Wilson of Beach Boys, James Taylor and Neil Young.

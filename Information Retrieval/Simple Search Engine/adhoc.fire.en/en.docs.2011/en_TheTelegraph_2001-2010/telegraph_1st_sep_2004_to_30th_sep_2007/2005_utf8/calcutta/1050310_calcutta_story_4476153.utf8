 A new horizon? Party cadre marches ahead 

 We all appreciate that the Army is taking a keen 

interest in keeping the Maidan clean. At the same time we are eager to see that 

the fairs and festivals which have become a part Calcutta?s life continue. 

 We are equally eager to see that the entire Maidan area is planned as a multi-functional open space. The transport terminals, the little club houses with their little playgrounds, the criss-crossing roads which make the entire area fragmented into many useless spaces, can all be rearranged or relocated to make the Maidan a grand arena of a great Metropolis. 

 In this context, may we not raise a question regarding the continuation of the huge defence establishment in the very heart (or lungs) of the town? 

 There is no other metropolitan town in the world where an army headquarters of comparable dimensions exist right in the centre of the city at its own peril. It also occupies the largest tract of the only riverfront approachable directly from the central business district depriving the people of the best part of their city. 

 Surely the strategic considerations of Job Charnock do not apply now. The 19th century Act which established military control over the area has long outlived its circumstantial compulsions. The enormous fund allocated to defence should be adequate to shift this base to somewhere more suitable for today?s requirement. 

 We should not also close our eyes to the huge building activities going on within the military zone. Voices were heard recently against some proposed development by the army on environmental grounds. But the loss of open space is a much more serious matter than even cutting down some trees. 

 One look at the map of Calcutta will convince anybody of the gross nonconformity of the Fort, a forbidden area, with the land use pattern of the city. It stands as a cruel barrier between the Maidan and the riverfront. 

 We should raise our voice against this misuse of prime land and press for opening up of the area for public use. A permanent fair ground can be built there.

architect and town planner, AJ C Road. 

Apropos the report ?Cadre turns broom brigade?, February 14, it is interesting to note the way the ruling Reds cleared the Brigade Parade Grounds after a rally. Before this, no political party had bothered to clean the ground, knowing fully well the environmental damage they are causing. 

 The CPM has set an example that other parties should follow. It is heartening to know that at least one party has evolved with the times. 

Rabindranath Kar,

Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

The report ?Alert over air pollution peril to baby in womb?, February 17, was shocking. The findings of the US-based National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences once again underlines the need to control air and other types of pollution in the city. The next generation of city residents is being crippled while the government pushes back the introduction of eco-friendly fuel in the city. 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road.

Everyone except the people ruling us seem to be concerned 

about the problems caused by pollution. The government has turned a deaf ear to 

court orders and the recommendations of the pollution control board. Paucity of 

funds should not be an excuse for delay in the execution of planned projects. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala. 

Apropos the report ?Safety drill, deadly roads?, February 18, traffic policemen should travel incognito in buses and minibuses for at least a fortnight to list traffic offences being committed by the drivers. The drivers should then be booked for the offences. If necessary, their driving licences should be cancelled. I believe, initiating this kind of a drive will drastically reduce the number of road accidents. 

Md Moinuddin,

Ballygunge. 

Apropos the report ?Home truths shock rights panel chief?, February 16, the authorities of Kishalay should understand that they are not running a jail. The residents of the home are entitled to the freedom and rights enjoyed by common people. We hope the chairman of state human rights commission will take steps to ensure that the rights of the inmates are protected. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

Beleghata. 

The report ?Track the fixer: Me ? He?, February 17, reminded me of a speech made by Professor Kaldor from Oxford University at a joint session of Parliament in the mid-1950s at the request of Pandit Nehru. The professor said he was amazed at the natural expertise of Indians in shirking responsibility and evading accountability. The same tradition of passing the buck continues. 

Jatindra Nath Bhowmick,

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 

 Apropos the report ?Spare kids, cries mother?, February 15, it is tragic that children are forced to attend the divorce proceedings of their parents. This may cause psychological scars in children that take a long time to heal. The parents should at least try to find a way to keep the children out of their dispute. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee, 

Nayapatty Road. 

Apropos the report ?Tips on right upbringing?, February 16, it is imperative that proper attention is paid to raising children right. Inept handling of tender minds can lead to disasters. We should seriously dwell on the issue to secure the future of the country. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

Lake Town.

 During summer and monsoon, many Calcuttans suffer from cholera, dysentery, gastroenteritis and diarrhoea after drinking polluted water. It is wonderful that the city has been chosen to be the first metro where specially-treated water will be distributed as part of an UN project (City bags UN safe water project, February 17). 

Bhupendra Nath Bose,

Dum Dum Park. 

 The report ?Those monsters of the road?, February 10, was a treasure trove of information. It provided valuable tips on safeguarding the interests and rights of bus commuters. 

Diptimoy Ghosh,

Salt Lake.

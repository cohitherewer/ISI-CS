The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Paul Simon 

You like to go slow and steady at work. Friends confide in you and count on you in times of distress. The grit to fight in spite of all odds will propel you to success. You always have the bigger picture in mind while plunging into a venture. You are a poet at heart. 

? ? Kusum Bhandari

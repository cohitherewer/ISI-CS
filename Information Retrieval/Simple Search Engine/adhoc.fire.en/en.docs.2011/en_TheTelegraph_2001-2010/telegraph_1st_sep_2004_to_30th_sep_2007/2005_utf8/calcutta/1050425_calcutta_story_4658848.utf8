 Shekhar Suman: Comic cut 

 After singing and acting contests, it?s time for a laughing competition on the small screen. STAR One, the new channel from the STAR bouquet, has launched The Great Indian Laughter Challenge ? a nationwide search for the best comic talent in the country.

 But perhaps more than the contestants, it will be the judges who will steal the thunder. The two funny chatterboxes Shekhar Suman and Navjyot Singh Sidhu are coming together for the first time to check out the sense of humour of the participants.

 The big-ticket prize for the eventual winner on the show includes a double dhamaka ? an entry to the ensemble cast of The Great Indian Comedy Show on STAR One, and a chance to host an all-new comedy programme on the channel.

 For all those wanting to try out your timing in front of the Big B of the small screen and good ol? Sherry, call up the specially IVR-activated number or send in your comic clips on VHS or VCD to the address. It?s promoted across the STAR network as ?Number lagao, Hamein hasao, Kismet ki ghanti bajao?. 

 STAR One has also tied up with Caf? Coffee Day to enable more and more people to participate through its large network of outlets across the country. Sixty of the best entries will be chosen to participate in the final rounds of The Great Indian Comedy Show.

 The last date of entries is April 30.

 Beauty and the Beast: All-time delight

 The movie made cinema history when it became the first full-length animated film to receive an Academy Award nomination in the Best Picture category. It also won a Golden Globe for Best Picture (Best Comedy or Musical) in 1991. And now, it?s on your television screen.

 In case you missed the April 23 premiere of Beauty and the Beast, catch the classic Disney tale on Disney Channel on April 29 at 6 pm.

 The story is of Belle, a young beautiful girl whose life revolves around reading books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father Maurice, who is an inventor. One day, Maurice gets lost in the woods and stumbles upon an enchanted castle belonging to a prince cursed to live the life of a beast. Angry at the trespassing, the beast throws Maurice into a dungeon. Belle seeks out her father and trades herself for her father as prisoner. Find out what happens next as you ride through the stunning world of Disney animation at its best. The channel has more movie treats to offer in the future ? from Aladdin to Pocahontas and Toy Story to George of The Jungle.

 Nicole Kidman: Packed kitty

 She may be hitting the headlines these days for her latest film The Interpreter, but Nicole Kidman already has her hands full with other projects, too. 

 The 37-year-old actor and Oscar-winner plays a witch in Bewitched, a rebel white female musician in American Darlings and lends her voice to an animated penguin in Happy Feet, among others.

 In Bewitched, a producer remaking the classic sitcom Bewitched, Will Ferrell is an actor taking on the role of Darren from the television show, while Nicole plays the actress hired to play Samantha in the show. But the fact is she?s really a witch. Slated for release later this year, the movie is directed by Nora Ephron.

 American Darlings, also slated for release in 2005, sees Jennifer Lopez team up with Kidman in a pre-World War II period musical drama. A white female swing band joins forces with a group of black and Hispanic musicians at a time when women were ostracised from playing in male-dominated clubs. The sex barriers shatter soon after President Roosevelt declares war on Japan and the women suddenly start playing in the hottest clubs. 

 Happy Feet, a comedy adventure written and directed by George Miller, is set in the land of the Emperor Penguins in the heart of Antarctica. The penguins sing, and each needs its own special song to attract a soul mate. The hero, Mumble (played by Elijah Wood), son of Elvis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) is the worst singer in the world, but is an ace tap dancer.

 The all-star voice cast also includes Brittany Murphy, Hugo Weaving, Robin Williams and features the dancing of legendary tapper Savion Glover.

 The workload, however, took its toll on the health of the leggy Australian, who complained of exhaustion recently. But everything seems to be okay now after Kidman retreated to her hometown Sydney for a well-deserved three-month holiday earlier this year.

 Kidman also resolved that she must learn to say no to movie offers more often, because if she?s offered a film she really wants to do, and with a great script and director, she finds it virtually impossible to refuse.

 Her latest movie, Sydney Pollack?s The Interpreter co-starring Sean Penn, looks set to light up the box-office. Her character speaks ?Ku?, a mock language based on Swahili and Shona, and works at the UN as a French-English interpreter. The UN, where the film was shot in New York, hopes that the movie will be able to make the place look cool and attract more tourists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Telly teen tips

The cast of Star One?s ?most happening show?, Remix, 

get together to give Calcutta?s party animals a few tips about how to make the 

most of the new year. 

Tia, Anvesha, Yuvraj and Ranvir bring advice from 

their different walks of life to the table to tell guys and gals how to look their 

very best in 2005. First are the golden rules, then, take each one?s word for 

it.

BOYS

If you drink, don?t drive

Don?t compromise comfort over fashion

Always carry enough cash (chivalry is never dead!).

GIRLS

Before applying or reapplying make-up, make sure your skin is absolutely clean 

(this will help preventing blocked pores)

Get a cut to complement your face, body, hair texture and lifestyle

Spend some time deciding your cut ? consult your hairdresser and be confident 

and comfortable before you actually take the plunge

If you decide to colour you hair, think about the shades you usually wear and 

are comfortable with. Remember to use colour-specific shampoos and have regular 

protein treatments.

RANVIR

Hair gel is in. Spike your locks or keep them straight

Jackets are the epitome of machismo, be it leather, denim or suede, put them on

Think funky while choosing club wear.

YUVRAJ

Tattoos are the funkiest eye catchers; if you are scared, get a temporary one. 

They won?t hurt, but they will also come off soon

Avoid the keds and floaters, go formal

Lie low on neck accessories.

ANVESHA

Bold is the flavour of the season ? the dare-to-wear attitude

Red is the colour of this festive season, be it hair, clothes or shoes

Fun handbags with dangling sequins will add to the flirty mood. Glittering beaded 

danglers and charm bracelets are good investments

Go for lots of accessories

The sporty look is in. Match it up with T-shirts, bags with numbers on them and 

sneakers.

TIA

If you?re spending New Year?s Eve in a nightclub where everybody dons the latest 

trends, it?s important for you to look the part and stand out of the crowd

Short skirts are on if you have long legs and want to flaunt them

Matching lipstick and nail varnish ? plum and blackberry colours look good

Fabrics marked for the coming season: wrinkle-free

Incorporate animal prints in textures such as lycra, linen and wool together. 

Blended fabrics are the mark of the day

Lady-like dark winged eyes with some soft lavender shadow

Pouty lips are back in vogue

Rosy wind-blushed soft look for the cheeks.

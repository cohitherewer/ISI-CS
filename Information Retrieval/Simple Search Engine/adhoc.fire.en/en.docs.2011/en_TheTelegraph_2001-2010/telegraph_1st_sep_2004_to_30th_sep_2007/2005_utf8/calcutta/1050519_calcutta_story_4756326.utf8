 Diamond-cutting edge to varsity, industry tie-up

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 The main building of Jadavpur University

 The much-touted university-industry partnership initiative is set to kickstart on Thursday.

 The Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI) will enter into a memorandum of understanding (MoU), with Jadavpur University for commercialisation of as many as seven projects successfully developed by different departments of the blue-ribbon institute.

 Top university and BNCCI officials and scientists of the university will sign the MoU in presence of state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen at Writers? Buildings on Thursday. The aim is to facilitate commercial exploitation of diverse projects in keeping with the emerging local needs ? environment and skin-friendly herbal products to high-tech medical device and waste management.

 BNCCI, according to top officials, would take up the responsibility to find entrepreneurs to set up industry based on the developments achieved at pilot scale by scientists of various JU departments. ?It could be from amongst its members and businessmen from its affiliated industry associations,? said a top official of the chamber. 

 The chamber, which has an entrepreneurship guidance outfit, could also motivate people to take up the projects, he added.

 According to the official, the entrepreneur willing to take up the projects would get all existing incentives. The state government, which is keen to see these projects successfully implemented, might come up with a package and venture capital funding for the entrepreneurs willing to take up the projects, sources said.

 According to the chamber official, the most promising of the projects is precision diamond- cutting technology. With Manikanchan, the economic zone for gem and jewellery, fully operational, there is a strong possibility for diamond-crafted jewellery units coming up. This would automatically give rise to the demand for electro-mechanically operated diamond-cutting tool developed by JU for precision cutting of diamond.

 The computer-operated electro-mechanical drug delivery device developed by pharmaceutical technology department of JU is another promising area which, the official noted, could attract BNCCI members who run private hospitals and nursing homes. The device would help quick administration of drugs to patients in a critical state who refuse to take them orally or get injected. The device would help a patient with quick inhalation so that the drug could be administered and act on the patient within a time frame.

 The other attractive area is manufacture of vegetable dye for the textile industry from flower extracts. Other items which could be made from flower extracts are alta, sindur and gulal. These direct skin contact products, currently made from chemicals, may become popular if herbal alternatives are available.

 Technologies for preservation, packaging and increased shelf life for locally available fruits, palm-based health drink which would work as an antacid and can be used for gynaecological treatment, low-cost housing, pollution control and waste management system for industrial units without relocation would also be included in the MoU for eventual commercialisation.

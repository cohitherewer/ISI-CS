 Protest withers Botanics plants

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Saplings and medicinal plants at Shibpur Botanical Garden are withering as about 500 garden employees are on an indefinite ceasework since April 4 to protest the new work schedule. 

 Two nurseries and the medicinal plant garden, popularly known as Charak Uddyan, are badly hit due to the agitation by three employees? associations. Gardeners have stopped watering the plants. 

 Realising the gravity of the situation, Botanical Survey of India (BSI) issued a notice on April 7 and threatened to initiate disciplinary measures against the agitating employees. 

 The notice, issued by head of office A. Pramanik, read: ?The situation is so grave that the authority has no other option but to take stern disciplinary action to keep office decorum and discipline in order. Accordingly, disciplinary proceedings for all such illegal activities and misconduct will be shortly initiated as per rules against the erring employees.?

 The CPM-controlled BSI Employees Association (BSIEA) launched the agitation on April 4, the day the new work schedule was introduced. It required employees to report for duty at 6 am on every working day. 

 The agitating employees had gheraoed joint director G.S.Giri, who is in charge of the garden, and abused him.

 Pramanik stated in his notice: ?It is being observed that members of BSIEA are resorting to an indefinite dharna against implementation of a revised schedule of technical and scientific staff and officers of the garden with effect from April 4. Other non-recognised and self-styled associations, too, have stopped working in the name of agitation. All efforts are being made by the administration to convince the aggrieved association members.?

 He added: ?Complaints are being received that some self-styled associations in complicity with some retired union leaders are continuously provoking others over the public address system to start a violent agitation against the administration.?

 Referring to the April 5 meeting between Giri and union leaders, Pramanik said: ?A mob of arrogant leaders hurled abuses and threatened the official with dire consequences.?

 Giri has already met senior BSI officials at their headquarters in Salt Lake and expressed his helplessness in handling the situation. 

 He had also skipped his duty for several days after the agitation began. Following Pramanik?s notice, the association decided to withdraw the agitation from April 19. 

 Instead, the members will organise protest meetings at various offices of BSI.

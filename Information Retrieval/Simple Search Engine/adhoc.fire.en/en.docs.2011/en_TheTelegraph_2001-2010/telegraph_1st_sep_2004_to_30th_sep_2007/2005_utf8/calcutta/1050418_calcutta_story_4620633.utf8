The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Has anybody visited the MP Birla Planetarium of late? The structure?s beauty 

is marred by a makeshift hotel on the eastern side of Chowringhee Road. Thanks 

to the shop, a lot of garbage is strewn around the place. Also, a part of the 

fencing around the planetarium is non-existent. Will the planetarium authority 

or the civic body take steps? 

 Chandan Ray, Shakuntala Park. 

 Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Elliot Road, Royd Street and the lanes branching off 

them are in a precarious condition. The authorities have done nothing so far to 

repair these roads, which has put the residents in great hardship. This area has 

a large number of schools and the children suffer a lot commuting on these roads. 

The motorists and rickshaw-pullers face a big challenge balancing their vehicles. 

I would request the local civic authorities as well as the elected representatives 

of the area to take up the matter with the authorities.

 Inayat Hussain, Marquis Street. 

 Although Bengali is the official language of the state, most government correspondence 

avoids its usage. Almost all official letters are being written in English only. 

Even the municipalities and panchayats are issuing all letters and certificates 

in English. Besides, traffic signboards in and around the city are also in English. 

What if a visitor to the city from the district doesn?t know English? How can 

he be self-reliant in finding his way around? 

 Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia.

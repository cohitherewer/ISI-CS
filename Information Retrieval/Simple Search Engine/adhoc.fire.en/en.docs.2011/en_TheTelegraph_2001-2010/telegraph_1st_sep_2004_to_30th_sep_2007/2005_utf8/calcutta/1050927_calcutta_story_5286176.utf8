 Lush beauties

 One of the most successful artists in the post-40s age group, Subrato Gangopadhyay began his career as an illustrator. Although he still does the occasional cover for puja numbers of prestigious publications, his paintings comprise some of the most saleable commodities in the Calcutta art mart today. Realistic but in a colourful, lush kind of way, his works are very appealing to collectors. They often feature beautiful women and girls in exotic or bucolic locales with a festive look about them. Hence Gangopadhyays great popularity as an artist to whom goes the credit of refurbishing a large hall in Bengal Club.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Subrato Gangopadhyay

 When: Till October 5, 2 pm - 7 pm (except Sunday)

 Where: Gallery Katayun

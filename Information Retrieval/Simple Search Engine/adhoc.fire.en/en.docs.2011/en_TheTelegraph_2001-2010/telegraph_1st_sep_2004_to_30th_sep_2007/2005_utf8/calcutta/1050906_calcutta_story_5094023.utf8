 Jingles all the way

 (From top) An NBA game in progress; the NBA jingle Let rsquo;s Get It Started 

 is a rage at nightclubs

 The party people are grooving to it and the DJs are swearing by it? Lets Get it Started is clearly much more than the NBA jingle.

 Performed brilliantly by the Black Eyed Peas, the original track was titled Lets Get Retarded. The lyrics were changed for the NBA campaign and it went on to become a bigger hit than the original.

 According to some city-based DJs, the ditty has found favour with the ever-fickle night club gang, enough for them to keep playing it on their turntables, night after night.

 But this is not the first musical combo of play and party. Rewind to 2002, when Nike released its World Cup promotional, The Secret Tournament, featuring superstars Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Totti, Figo and Raul, among others, playing to the re-mixed version of Elvis Presleys A Little Less Conversation, mixed by DJ Paul Oakenfold and JXL.

 The innovative campaign caught the public eye but more than that, the jingle caught the ear, volleying it to the top of the charts.

 oser home, the Pepsi jingle Oye bubbly composed by music director duo Vishal-Shekhar became quite a rage by itself, while the Umeed se dugna jingle for KBC 2, which catches the Bachchan baritone in rap mode, also got the dance floors going.

 Tune trend

 The striking feature here is that all these tracks started out as jingles or even as polyphonic ring tones, but went on to become chartbusters on regular music countdowns.

 So how does one decide what is popular or mainstream music? The Free dictionary (online, of course) defines popular music as any genre of music having a wide appeal, though, only for a short time.

 ternative musical formulas are making their presence heard in todays music scene. Characterised by melodic invention, colourful instrumentation and rhythmic vitality, even jingles, which normally arent more than 30 seconds in duration, have the means to become anthems.

 DJ Sammy of Tantra, however, has a contrasting view. The KBC 2 jingle wouldnt really fit in the nightclub mould. The tempo of the beat does not really acclimatise itself to regular airplay in the nightclubs. Alternative music forms are definitely making an impact, but the fad really hasnt caught on here, in Calcutta, as yet? Different genres of music are being developed and fine-tuned all the time. Drum Bass and Two Step are definitely two genres that should capture the publics ear, because of their up-tempo.

 Without straying too far from the mainstream, these forms have created a niche for themselves, especially with the advent of technology in the creation and production of new-age music. Genres such as electronica, house, garage, trance and industrial house have entered the mainstream consciousness using different musical formats and innovative recording techniques.

 Soundtracks from computer games such as Tomb Raider, Doom, Super Mario and Quake are extremely popular and command cult status.

 Says DJ Akash: Usage of computer games and video game soundtracks have been in vogue for quite a while, with the soundtrack of Super Mario being a prime example. I have used the soundtrack quite a few times, with some success. The recent fad of using jingles as club tracks has caught on as well, but it has to be selective, because the duration of the jingle isnt more than a minute at the most. The usage of loops has to be creative, otherwise there is a good chance of spoiling the effect.

 Digital music in all its forms has become a major entertainment medium for the under-30 set and the with constant musical revolution, the quirkiness of an alternative form is steadily bringing down the barriers of what is considered popular music.

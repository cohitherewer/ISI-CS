The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The nutty professor

 Continuing its exploration of absurd drama and the possibilities it offers in terms of intelligent humour and entertainment, Theatrecian presents The Lesson, an adaptation of a play by Ionesco. Though beginning on a comical note, it confronts the audience with more serious issues pertaining to obsessions, psychological delusions and abuse of power. The play discusses these problems through emotionally charged and violent interactions between a student and her schizophrenic professor. During an arithmetic lesson, the teacher gets annoyed when he realizes that his student can add but not subtract (?integrate? and not ?disintegrate?, as he puts it). His mentally disturbed condition becomes even clearer while he takes a lesson in linguistics, when he launches into a fantastical tirade on the origins of language. Language, seen here as an instrument of provocation, is handled with wonderful dexterity, taking the dialogue beyond the scope of the text. Directed by Bobby Chackrabarty.

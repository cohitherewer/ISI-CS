 Canal project ready to sail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The cloud over the canal navigation project cleared last week after housing minister Goutam Deb granted the executing rights to West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC). The transport department had vied for the rights.

 WBIDC, the nodal agency of the scheme, got a detailed project report prepared by I-Win, its joint venture with ICICI. I-win floated a tender and shortlisted three companies intending to execute the project on a build-operate-transfer basis.

 The tussle started after Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC), an agency of the transport department, floated another tender inviting bids to execute the project.

 WBIDC brought the matter to the notice of the government. The housing minister, who had sanctioned Rs 20 crore for the project, intervened in the matter and cleared the confusion.

 The decision on the execution rights was taken after a meeting last week between Deb and officials of the transport and irrigation departments and WBIDC. 

 The minister asked transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury to cancel the second tender and asked WBIDC officials to go ahead with the scheme.

 ?We have cancelled the tender following the directive of the government and conveyed the information to I-Win, which will monitor implementation of the project,? said a senior TIDC official.

 Deb attributed the confusion to a communication gap. ?The matter has now been sorted out. I expect the project to sail through smoothly,? he said.

 As part of the project, the 20-km stretch of three canals will be cleaned, dried, excavated and filled with water from the Hooghly. 

 In addition, the drainage channels emptying into the canals will be diverted and the banks developed.

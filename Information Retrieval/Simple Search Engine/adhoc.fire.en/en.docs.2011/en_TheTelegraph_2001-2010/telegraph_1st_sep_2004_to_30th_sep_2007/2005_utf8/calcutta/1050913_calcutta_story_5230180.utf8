The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sleuth chief flayed for bulletin goof-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Monday censured city detective chief Gyanwant Singh for the ?goof-up? that led to the publication of ?bribe rates? in Calcutta Police Gazette and ordered an inquiry against two persons involved with the printing of the bulletin.

 Though no one has been named, insiders in the home department claimed the inquiry would find out the role of the head assistant to Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department, and the printer of the Gazette. Both are on staff of the Calcutta Police Directorate, but are not police personnel.

 Acting police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarty has said in his report that Singh, the final authority in approving of the write-ups, was at fault, but added that the officer was hard-pressed for time because of the security arrangements that had to be made for the delimitation commission session at Mahajati Sadan on September 8.

 Singh cleared the write-ups a day before, when he was busy with the security preparations, the report said.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said there had been ?lapses on Singh?s part? and that he would be ?censured in writing?. But apart from that, the government will not take any action against him because of his ?good record?. In fact, the probe announced on Wednesday will be carried out by Singh. The report will be submitted in a week.

 Repeating what he had said earlier, Ray said the publication of the ?bribe rates? was not a mistake, but a ?deliberate? act. The hint was that those responsible for it wanted to malign the image of the force.

 Published on September 8, Part IV of the Gazette claimed that an undertrial at the Sealdah court lock-up can have foreign liquor by paying Rs 200 or speak on a cell phone by paying Rs 100 to a policeman. If an undertrial wants to talk to an outsider, the rate is Rs 50. 

 The authorities have found out that someone had kept the draft, containing the bribe details, in a heap of papers on the head assistant?s table. The slip was marked ?printer? ? meaning it was to be published in the Gazette. 

 This, it appears, was done by an officer of the detective department, who knew that the head assistant usually did not go through the write-ups. 

 And, as usual, the head assistant passed on the draft to the printer, who forwarded it to deputy commissioner Singh for approval.

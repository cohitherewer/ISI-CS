Life

 Tracking time with toons 

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Chic and trendy, clocks today are very much an integral part of home decor. And just in case you are on the lookout for something that not only helps you track time, but adds funk to the way your home feels, lifestyle store Nik Nish is the place to check out.

 ocks fitted in cartoon characters come in bright shades of red, blue, pink and yellow. While some sit with long legs dangling, others give a cheerful thumbs up. Some flash a smile while the more naughty ones wink at you!

 Then you have the heart-shaped ones with extended spring boot-clad legs and a capped head. Its a journey to the fairytale world with clocks that look like colourful countryside houses, chimneys, tweeting birds, dogs playing and all. Table clocks with animal attachments grab your eye, too.

 While flower-shaped clocks with broad petals are suitable for a little girls bedroom, the ones shaped like sweet lime are apt for the kitchen.

Is your little one learning the first know-your-animals lessons? Then get him or her timepieces adorned with a little orange lion along with her cub, a mother giraffe with her baby, pretty owls, an adorable cow smiling away to glory, beetles or even elephants in bright splashes of red, blue and citrine.

 The aquatic world includes fancy fish with broad red lips and some with green hats on. 

 Small study-table clocks come in different shapes ? baby frocks, shoes and even slippers. 

 Little tykes are sure to love the ones that look like footballs, tyres, steering wheels of cars and ships. 

 The teen brigade can go for those that look like denim-clad legs with boots in place.

 It is the time of the year when you exchange warmth, greetings and gifts. These serve as good gift items that suit all ages. These clocks made of plastic primarily stand out for their fine finish, colour combination and an attractive appeal on the whole, says a spokesperson for Nik Nish.

 You also have a wide variety of wall clocks to choose from. While some look like apples, others resemble frogs, elephants or even pigs. Wall clocks that look like slippers embellished with motifs of footballs, strawberries or flowers are worth a try.

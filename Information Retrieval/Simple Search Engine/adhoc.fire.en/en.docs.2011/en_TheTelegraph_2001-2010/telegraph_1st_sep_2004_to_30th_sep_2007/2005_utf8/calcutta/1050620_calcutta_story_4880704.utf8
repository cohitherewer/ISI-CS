 Green guard at New Town

 - Expert drafted to monitor quality of work, environment 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), the implementing agency for New Town at Rajarhat, has engaged an expert to oversee all work and ensure quality and environment protection.

 Former member of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and former engineer of the public health engineering department, Biman Bose, has been engaged as director-general of Hidco in charge of quality control and environment.

 Hidco managing director Sumantra Chowdhury said the move was aimed at ensuring that work was carried out using the best materials. 

 ?The development of New Town is on in full swing and work on different infrastructure, like water supply, drainage and sewerage is in progress. We want to ensure that all the work is done without compromising on quality,? Chowdhury explained. 

 ?We have taken several steps to speed up work to complete infrastructure within the time-frame and, at the same time, maintain quality. The expert will be responsible for ensuring quality,?? the Hidco managing director added.

 According to Hidco officers, though there are engineers and architects to supervise work in the township, who fix specifications for everything, including quality of materials to be used, they remain caught up with the task of meeting deadlines. Besides, as the volume of work is rapidly increasing, the engineers are overburdened. A separate team to oversee quality is necessary.

 ?New Town should be a model township. It has already made a name for itself all over the country and has won accolades from various quarters, including the Centre, for its unique concept and progress of work. We have told the joint-venture companies, who are building highrises in the township, to maintain quality in every field,?? managing director Chowdhury said. 

 The new team led by Bose will ensure that things are done as per plan and specifications. They will test materials and initiate measures in case any fault is detected.

 For environment protection, the team will go into tree planting, beautifying parks and gardens, protection of waterbodies, solid waste management and keep an eye on auto emission. ?The thrust is on protection of environment. We do not want to turn the township into a concrete jungle,?? Chowdhury said.

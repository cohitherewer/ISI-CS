 A moment from Pyaar Vyaar And All That

 Pia, a petite girl with a lethal gait, walks into college. Heads turn and eyes light up. And Roxette croons: She?s got the look. Trust MTV to make a Hindi serial rock. Pyaar Vyaar And All That premiered on November 14 and has already made ears perk up with the use of Western chartbusters as background scores.

 Cyrus Oshidar, MTV Networks India senior vice-president (creative and content), refuses to call it a soap. The reason is obvious. MTV?s first serial was steered by mush-masters Balaji Telefilms. Kitni Mast Hai Zindagi ?plummeted after the initial eight weeks? of riding the curiosity crest generated by the Balaji-MTV combination. ?The kids did not connect,? Oshidar admits.

 So this time the brief is clear ? ?melodrama nahin chahiye?. Though Pyaar Vyaar? is a Cinevistaa production, it?s MTV that is dictating the tone and tenor. ?The shooting was done mostly outdoors, in Goa,? explains Oshidar. Adds supervising producer and head of fiction, Vaibhav Modi: ?We have shunned manufactured reality. There are no wrought iron beds against red walls.?

 The story is about the coming of age of four youngsters. It charts their journey through their dreams as also their changing interpersonal dynamics. In their first year in college, they are grappling with sexuality, HIV, stepfathers and peer pressure.

 The serial, on air Monday through Thursday (8 pm), has made good use of the EMI Warner library at MTV?s disposal. ?English chart-toppers are being used for the first time in Hindi serials,? stresses Modi. So there will be Backstreet Boys, Michael Learns to Rock, Mariah Carey and Bryan Adams singing for Kush, Lara, Pia and Gaurav.

 Pyaar Vyaar? is looking at a seasonal format, whereby the first season will have 40 half-hour episodes. ?This gives me the liberty to have a clear-cut plot,? Modi says. Each episode has been planned with three-four milestones where songs can be used. So when Lara, a girl from a dysfunctional family, has a showdown at home with her mother, there is R.E.M. singing Everybody hurts. Modi claims the sudden switch of languages just does not jar. ?The language the characters speak is colloquial.?

 If MTV is breaking into fiction, it is because it seeks to build the habit of ?appointment viewing? among youth. ?In India, music is not a way of life as in the West. We want to grow in other ways,? Oshidar says.

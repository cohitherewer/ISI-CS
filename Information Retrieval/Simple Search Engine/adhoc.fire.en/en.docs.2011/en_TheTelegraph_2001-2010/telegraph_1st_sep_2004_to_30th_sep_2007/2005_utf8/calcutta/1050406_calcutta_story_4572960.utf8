The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop dreams, flop schemes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Undeterred by their dismal record of incomplete projects, the city police have announced plans to provide a security blanket to Calcuttans at night.

 As part of the project, policemen will be deployed at all road intersections in the city at night. A section of officers is already on the job.

 The move was initiated on instructions from police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. With several nightclubs and discos coming up in the city over the past couple of years, he has directed his men to improve security after dark.

 ?Our aim is to increase the visibility of policemen on roads at night. People?s lifestyles have changed. They now return home late at night from offices, as well as hang-outs,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

 It has been decided that a police outpost with telephone facility will be set up at all the intersections.

 ?An officer will man the post through the night. Whenever he notices a problem, he will contact his police station or the control room at Lalbazar,? the officer added. 

 Many policemen are, however, sceptical about the success of the project. 

 ?A number of projects were adopted in the past three years. Now, all the projects have become a thing of past,? scoffed another senior officer.

 ?Five of the projects could not be continued for more than a month because of infrastructural problems. Surprisingly, no one bothered to test the waters before implementing the projects,? he added.

 Heading the list of unsuccessful projects are two by the traffic department. Seven years ago, the department had attempted to make CR Avenue snarl-free by introducing a synchronised signalling system.

 Earlier, it had introduced bus bays. An order was issued to take legal action against buses overstepping the lane. Both projects proved non-starters.

 The city police authorities had trained nearly 50 sub-inspectors from police stations across the city at Lalbazar to work for street children. 

 The officers, who were given the designation of Child Welfare Officers, were supposed to ensure the welfare of streetchildren. This project, too, flopped.

 The welfare officers maintain that it is impossible for them to work for the children, given their responsibilities at the police stations.

 The traffic department had also planned to deploy plainclothesmen in private and government buses to monitor the mistakes made by rash or law-breaking drivers. The project continued for only a week.

 Dues 

dispute clouds 

STAR

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A significant section of the cable amp; satellite households in the city is set to give its favourite TV programmes a miss, as four STAR channels are likely to go off air on Tuesday due to a payment dispute.

 The entertainment major is locked in a dues battle with Indian Cable Net ? an arm of multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable ? which, STAR claims, has outstandings of over Rs 2 crore.

 One of the problem points is STAR?s second bouquet, comprising STAR One, Hungama, Disney Channel and Toon Disney. STAR had issued a public notice that Indian Cable Net was liable for disconnection.

 Indian Cable Net had moved Telecom Disputes Settlement amp; Appellate Tribunal on the matter. The MSO had also told the tribunal that it was unwilling to continue running STAR?s second bouquet. The tribunal allowed Indian Cable Net to return STAR?s decoder boxes in that case.

 For the past two days, viewers across the SitiCable network in the city had been receiving scrolls on their TV screens informing them that STAR?s four channels were liable to go off air due to STAR demanding Rs 28 per subscriber from them.

 ?We have decided to discontinue with the four channels in the interest of the consumer. According to our internal survey, consumers are not willing to shell out more for them,? said a SitiCable official.

 Manthan ? another city MSO ? is also likely to follow suit, as a ?mark of solidarity?, say sources. The two MSOs currently occupy around 70 per cent of the market.

 ?Indian Cable Net or SitiCable is yet to return our decoder boxes? We?ll wait and see what happens,? a STAR spokesperson said from Mumbai. STAR India also moved Delhi High Court on Monday, challenging Trai fixing a ceiling on monthly subscriptions. ?We feel pricing should be left to market forces,? the spokesperson added.

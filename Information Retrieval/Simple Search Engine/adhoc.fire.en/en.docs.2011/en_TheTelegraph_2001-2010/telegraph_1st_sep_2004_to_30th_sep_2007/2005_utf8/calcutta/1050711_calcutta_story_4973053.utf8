The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Graduation ahead in three parts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Students who intend to reappear in the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) 2006, after missing a berth in the engineering and medical courses this year, may abandon such plans.

 From this year, it will not be easy for first-year B.Sc students to bunk classes to prepare for the next JEE.

 Calcutta University will finalise on July 12 a proposal of the state higher education council to break its undergraduate courses (BA, B.Sc and B.Com) into three parts, abolishing the existing 2+1 (Part I and Part II) structure from the academic session beginning August.

 Under the 1+1+1 scheme, the Part I examination will be held at the end of the first year. This means students will have to attend classes on a regular basis right from the time they join college.

 ?The 1+1+1 scheme has been discussed at various levels. There should not be any problem for us to implement it from the academic session beginning next month if the syndicate approves it on July 12,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).

 Over the years, the government has noticed that a large number of students who fail to figure on the JEE (engineering as well as medical) merit list at the first go, take admission to the B.Sc course in various colleges, including prestigious ones like Presidency and St Xavier?s. 

 Thereafter, they concentrate on preparing for the JEE. A good number of them succeed in the JEE the next time. 

 Another large group of students, who fail to manage a rank on the JEE merit list even the second time, go ahead with preparing for the B.Sc Part I examinations the next year.

 The government is unhappy with the trend for a number of reasons. 

 Education in government-aided colleges is highly subsidised, and the government feels it is a waste of money if students block seats in B.Sc courses in this way.

 If a student leaves a college in the second year, the seat has to be kept vacant for the entire course, as it is not possible to fill it up at this stage. 

 After a series of studies, the state higher education council has found that a good number of students, who try their luck in the JEE more than once, may not have the aptitude for engineering or medical courses but they do have the potential for higher studies in basic sciences. 

 But these students cannot perform well in the B.Sc Part I exams because they ?waste? the whole of first year preparing for the JEE.

 ?We will not be able to conduct world-class research in basic sciences and compete with other countries if we are unable to exploit the best brains in the field of science,? pointed out Shyamapada Pal, member of the higher education council and also a Calcutta University syndicate member.

 Small talk

 World Environment Day may have come and gone but theres reason enough for you to stick to vegetarian fare. Be sure to steer clear of exotic meats or you might find madam Maneka on your hide faster than you can say Pataudi! Help yourself instead to liberal scoops of juicy gossip?

 Hunter hunt 

 The first pin-up boy of Indian cricket has fallen from grace. Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis royal habits appeared in rather bad taste as he was caught near Dadanpur village in Haryana travelling in two convoys with three carcasses including one allegedly of a black buck, an endangered specie. Keep a few arrows in your own quiver ? looks like the beastly trait runs in the family, remember Saif caught shooting the same helpless black bucks in Rajasthan a few years ago? Game outside the cricket pitch doesnt become Pataudi. Looks like he took his title of Tiger to heart. Well, why blame him? His son got away scot-free and the nawab thought the likes of them have a license to kill. That should see you through the dinner. Just remember to lay off the Shark Fin Soup.

 Saffron sobs

 The party only gets better as another biggie bites the dust. Take a dig at the frailty of the political game as Lal Krishna Advanis high praise for the secular Jinnah while visiting Pakistan did more than ruffle a few saffron feathers back home. The opposition leader has suddenly become a traitor in the eyes of his own opportunist rank and hard-liner file. Dont miss the twist in the resignation drama unfolding in the Capital. Will Advani do a Mamata and reconsider? 

 Holly huff

 If political upheavals and enthusiastic admissions have left the gossip monger in you a little disappointed of late, tune in to the latest reports of Mr Pitt and Ms Jolie sharing fabulous chemistry on screen in Mr amp; Mrs Smith. First Jolie vehemently denied involvement with Pitt, saying she couldnt even dream of going around with a married man as her father cheated on her mother. Then, our man Pitt held forth about the bounty on his head and bemoaned the wastage of so much money to get coveted pictures of him on a beach with Angelina and her adopted son Maddox. But the director of the film seemed to have other ideas. He expressed fear that fans of Pitts estranged wife Jennifer Aniston will boycott the film, enraged as they might be on seeing the graphic and realistic lovemaking scenes on celluloid. A likely story, you might smirk. Likely to get fans queuing up on the double for some good old-fashioned vicarious lovin.

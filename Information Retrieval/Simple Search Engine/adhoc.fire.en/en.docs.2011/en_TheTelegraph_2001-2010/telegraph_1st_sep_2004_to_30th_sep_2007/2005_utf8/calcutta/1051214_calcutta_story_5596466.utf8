The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A rush to reach the 

islands

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 After a perfect wedding, Vaishali and Rajiv had planned a dream honeymoon in the emerald isle of Andamans. Accordingly, a suite in a star hotel had been booked. But with no seats available on any Port Blair-bound flight, the couple had to cancel the trip.

 In the countdown to the eve of tsunami anniversary, tourism is back with a bang in the Andamans. And registering the maximum footfalls are, of course, Calcuttans.

 ?It?s chock-a-block. All our flights are full and we are even operating additional flights. Phone calls for reservations are simply not stopping,? a spokesperson for Indian airline told Metro on Tuesday.

 Judging by the flow, the island administration estimates more than 10,000 tourists will land up in Port Blair and on the adjoining islands in the run-up to December 26.

 ?We now have around 2,000 tourists and the number is growing every day. Tourism is definitely back here,? asserted Kuldip Singh, director (tourism), Andaman and Nicobar Island Administration.

 Most tourists heading for a sun-soaked holiday on the pristine beaches of the 530-plus islands are from eastern and southern India. Some are even travelling all the way from Delhi, via Calcutta.

 Among the must-see spots are Barren Island, Neil Island, Havelock, Mayabunder and Jollybuoy.

 ?Our thrice-a-week trip to the Barren Island is a favourite among tourists. The fear has finally disappeared,? said Rana Mathew, pubic relation officer of the tourism department.

 Chawla Mazumdar, personal manager at Fortune Resort in Bay Island, believes ?public memory is short, even with regard to tsunami?. 

 The reason for this optimism: all rooms in this star-category resort have been booked days in advance.

 ?We have planned several package tours this season and it is definitely a full-house situation,? she added.

 Other hotels, like Sentinel and Shompen, too, recorded ?satisfying business? last month. ?Our bookings were 90 per cent in November and we have reason to believe that the days leading to the New Year will be equally good,? added Geetesh, general manager at Sentinel.

 Travel agents in Calcutta, too, are happy. ?The feedback is very good. For those who have missed the tsunami-eve trip can go there in January. The weather is fine for a great holiday there,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

 The island authorities have also planned special programmes for tsunami survivors on December 26.

 As people start moving into New Town, Rajarhat, it has dawned on the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government that the township is fast becoming a concrete jungle. Following a prod from the chief minister himself, officials of the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), the implementing agency for New Town, have asked the forest department to draw up an afforestation plan for the township.

 The Rs 20-lakh project includes planting 5,000 saplings across the 700-acre Action Area IA in monsoon. The spots identified for the project include the boulevard, the flanks of the eight-lane road running through the township and the area around the bus depot coming up in Action Area IA.

 ?The prod came directly from the top. At a time when the state government is laying stress on greening Calcutta, we cannot ignore New Town, which is being touted as the new showpiece of development,? a senior forest department official said.

 The meeting that drew up the blueprint for greening the township was held at the Hidco office last Friday and was attended by forest secretary R.K. Tripathy, chief conservator of forests (social forestry) Rakesh Sinha, deputy conservator of forests (urban and recreational forestry wing) Somnath Mukherjee and senior officials of the implementing agency, including managing director Sumantra Choudhury.

 ?We have identified some vacant areas that offer the scope for landscaping and gardening. We will soon conduct a detailed inspection and chalk out a comprehensive afforestation plan,? said Somnath Mukherjee.

 The department has drawn up a list of 52 varieties of flowering, fruit-bearing and evergreen trees, as well as ornamental plants, to deck up Action Area IA.

 Flowering and evergreen trees like krishnachura, radhachura, ashoke (both red and yellow varieties), palash, teak, silver oak, jacaranda, rose wood and varieties of cassia will be planted at an interval of 10 feet along the road. 

 ?We want the forest department to undertake this project because they have the expertise. The saplings planted will be surrounded by gabions to protect them from animals, as well as humans,? said Hidco managing director Choudhury.

 Housing minister Goutam Deb, also chairman of Hidco, will review the progress of the greening drive.

 The forest department has started producing the saplings at its nursery in Rajarhat. Sources said the afforestation should have been taken up two years ago, so the saplings would have been of some height by the time the residents started moving in. 

 Though the forest department opened a nursery in the township in 2002, hardly any plantation has been carried out. 

 Last year, Hidco had hired some private contractors to plant around 500 saplings in Action Area IA. However, not many of the plants survived.

 ?If the forest department is involved in the process, its staff will take care of the saplings in the first three years, which is the most crucial period for their survival,? an official explained.

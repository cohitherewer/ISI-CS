 The City Diary

 Six women were arrested in two adjacent flats in Lake Gardens on Wednesday afternoon for allegedly running a sex racket. Police said the operator was 30-year-old Chandana Das, also known as Manisha. All six had given the impression to neighbours that they were sisters. 

 Deputy commissioner (special) of the detective department Rajesh Subarno said the arrests followed a week-long probe into the activities of the six women. He said Chandana had rented the two flats in a multi-storeyed building on the plea that she would stay with her sisters. ?Those who stayed with her were between 18 and 20 years, and were from fringe areas like Thakurpukur, Sonarpur and Khardah,? Subarno said.

 What aroused police?s suspicion were advertisements in newspapers, published by a woman seeking friendship from males. The advertisement carried a cell phone number, which was Chandana?s. Sleuths came to know her name through the service provider and made inquiries about her. 

 The raids took place around 3 pm. ?No male was present in the flats, but we came across some evidence which confirmed our suspicion. The women were grilled separately and they contradicted each other. They were brought to Lalbazar,? said an officer. 

 Around the same time, two men and two women were arrested on Free School Street under the Immoral Traffic Act. 

 A public interest litigation was filed on Wednesday in the high court challenging the legality of the industrial strike called by Citu on September 29. Petitioners? counsel Idris Ali said a division bench last year had declared bandhs and strikes illegal, following a Supreme Court judgement on the issue. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Tuesday night pulled down illegal billboards across the city. Two billboards at NRS Medical College and Hospital were among those pulled down. Mayoral council member Faiyaz Khan said the civic authorities had prepared a list of illegal billboards, especially on EM Bypass.

 Rekha Das, 42, committed suicide on Wednesday morning by hanging herself from the ceiling of her Raja Manindra Road house, in north Calcutta. Police said the woman was single and was suffering from depression. 

 Twenty-four Bangladeshi fishermen were arrested in Shyampur, Howrah, late on Tuesday. They were arrested under the Foreigner?s Act.

 A team from Topsia police station arrested Nata Riyaz, a murder accused, late on Tuesday. Riyaz had allegedly murdered Mohammed Ahmed in July.

 A 53-year-old man was killed on Wednesday afternoon after a bus knocked him down on CIT Road, in Maniktala. Police said the victim, Samarendra Nath Das, was a resident of Uttarpara, in Hooghly. The driver of the bus fled with the vehicle. Das was taken to ESI Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

 To cope with the rush caused by the transport strike, the interval between Metro Railway trains was reduced from eight to seven minutes between 9 am and 11 am and from 5 pm to 9 pm on Wednesday, officials said.

 Salauddin and Chand, both in their twenties, were arrested on Wednesday for plotting a raid on a petrol station at the crossing of Hyde Road and CGR Road, in the West Port police station area.

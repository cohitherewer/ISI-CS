 Water wonders bring in wealthy ways

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Constructing a waterfall in the north or south-east of the garden invites wealth and prosperity into the house. However, care should be taken to ensure that the waterfall is neither too steep nor too gentle. The strength of the water should also be taken into account, ensuring that it is neither too strong nor too slow

Q: We want to extend the northern portion of our ancestral house and construct a water feature in the garden. Please provide Feng Shui guidelines that will bring wealth and prosperity.

 Nirmal Desai

 The Solution: Do not extend the northern side of the house as by doing so you will ruin the shape of the house. The north-east and north-west corners will get reduced and that will not be too beneficial for you. These two corners are vital for the occupants of a house as blessings, peace and help from mentors and from heaven flow from here. 

 One of the most powerful methods of inviting prosperity and wealth is through the construction of a waterfall in the north or south-east corners of the garden. Care should be taken to ensure that it is neither too steep nor too gentle. The strength of the water falling should also be neither so strong that its Chi becomes destructive, nor so slow that it resembles a trickle of water, which will not be effective at all. 

 If constructed outside, there are certain Feng Shui principles to be followed. It should be built facing the main entrance so that the flow of water, synonymous with wealth in Feng Shui, works to your advantage. 

 If it cannot face the main door, then its flow can be directed towards a large window to invite the waterfalls auspicious Chi into the home.

 Cash charms

 Q: My family is passing through a very bad phase of late. We have had accidents, illnesses and court cases recently. My finances are also depleting. Are there any Feng Shui lucky charms to ward off evil and bad luck? 

 Jayant

 The Solution: According to the Flying Stars theory, there are certain conflicting stars that bring about such problems in a persons life. It is quite possible that you are occupying a negative Chi room in the house. 

 Try changing your bedroom and hopefully the new room will have better flying stars so you will get some relief from your present situation. 

 You can also carry a picture or an amulet of a pair of fish in your pocket or wallet as an enhancer of good Chi. This will protect you from any unwanted happenings. 

 A pair of fish is believed to be a very lucky charm that protects you from bad luck. It is among the auspicious signs that appeared on the footprints of Lord Buddha. 

 To stop drainage of wealth, you must ensure that the taps in the toilets and kitchen are not dripping due to plumbing problems. This will have a direct impact on your bank account.

 Cutting Corners 

 Q: I have bought a corner plot where there is a cut in the corner. The architect has designed the house in such a way that there is a cut in the building as well that runs parallel to the cut of the plot. I am feeling uncomfortable with the design and would like your guidance regarding this. I understand that the north-east sector of the house should have a temple, but can the toilets and dressing rooms that have heavy storage be placed in the north-east of the individual bedrooms? 

 Vikram

 The Solution: The cut in a corner plot may be unavoidable, but do not make the mistake of creating the similar cut in the building. It should be designed in such a way that all the four corners are intact and all the walls meet at right angles.

 Toilets and heavy storage in the north-east corner of any room is never recommended according to Feng Shui because this is the pious zone of mental peace, education and gods blessings. 

 It is best to have doors here as this allows auspicious energy from the north-east to flow into each room. This will also rule out provisions for storage. 

 Healing greens 

 Q: The eastern side of our house is completely blocked. We are having a lot of health-related problems in the family. I was wondering if this could be due to the blocked east. If so, please suggest Feng Shui remedies.

 Shantanu Banerjee

 The Solution: East is the direction from where the suns universal life-giving force flows into the house and nourishes the health of each and every resident. 

 Since you do not have windows in the east, try to create positive energy by putting up wallpaper or a painting that depicts the rising sun with growing trees and flowers. 

 Enhance the ruling wood energy of this area by placing fresh healthy green plants and flowers, as opposed to artificial silk ones. 

 Do not place any metal objects or furniture here as these will be detrimental to the growing wood energy. Also, ensure that photographs are not displayed in metal frames. 

 Make sure to not store metal cutlery or a tool box containing sharp nails, screws, hammers, nail-cutters, scissors, needles and blades here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trader seeks rights help

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The family of a trader in Rabindra Nagar has had to do without water for the past seven months, allegedly for daring to raise its voice against local CPM leaders. 

 Gopal Sarkar, the trader, has run from pillar to post to have his water supply restored, but to no avail. As the last resort, he has petitioned the state human rights commission.

 In May, hoodlums ransacked and forcibly shut down Sarkar?s shop on the charge that it encroached on government land (the report of the incident appeared in Metro). A promoter, who is also a member of the CPM, allegedly backed the toughs. 

 ?I was away on personal work. Some men, armed with bamboos, entered the shop and started beating up the workers. My wife rushed to the shop and managed to control the situation. On her way home, in the same neighbourhood, she saw some men working on the water supply line. They said they were cleaning the channel,? stated Sarkar. 

 The water supply stopped soon after.

 The family comprises 35 members, 15 among them children. ?Since May 28, we have had to either fetch drinking water from a tap, which is nearly 10 minutes away, or purchase it,? Sarkar added.

 The trader met the chairman of local Mahestala municipality Kali Bhandari, but the latter expressed his inability to help.

 When contacted, Bhandari said: ?We don?t have the authority to cut off water supply. So, how can we take the responsibility of restoring the connection??

 Local councillor Babul Chakraborty, of the CPM, allegedly refused to grant Sarkar an audience, saying he has ?no time to listen to bogus complaints?. 

 Sarkar then approached officials of the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority. One of them told him that the authority had not cut off the line and that he should approach Mahestala municipality.

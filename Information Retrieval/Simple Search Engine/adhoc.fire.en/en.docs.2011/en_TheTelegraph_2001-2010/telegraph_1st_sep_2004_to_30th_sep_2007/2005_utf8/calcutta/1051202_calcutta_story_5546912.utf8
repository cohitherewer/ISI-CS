The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A jazz-rock combine

 After the blues magic of French virtuoso Jean-Jacques Milteau and the multi-layered baroque tapestry of German ensemble Leipziger Barocksolisten, it?s time for all that jazz again in Calcutta.

 Lifting the curtains on the season will be an evening of high-octane jazz-rock collage, with Jeff Sipe, one of the most talked-about drummers in the world today, teaming up with Austrian guitar phenomenon Alex Machacek and his wife Sumitra Nandunjan on vocals.

 Presented by Dalhousie Institute (DI) and organised by Congo Square in partnership with AbstractLogix, the December 8 concert on the DI lawns will also feature home-grown slide guitarist Debashish Bhattacharya, who performed alongside John McLaughlin on Remember Shakti in January, and city-based tabla exponent Tanmoy Bose.

 ?This is the first time that Sipe, of Apartment Q-258 fame, will be performing in India and his collaborator Machacek?s guitar playing has been compared to that of the legendary Allan Holdsworth. This will be a fitting appetiser to the Jazz, Blues and Beyond series slated for the third week of January,? says a spokesperson for Congo Square.

 Sipe, who as a youngster had been mesmerised by the speed of ELP?s Carl Palmer on his massive kit, is clearly the star at next Thursday?s gig, having collaborated with the likes of Jimmy Herring (on Project Z), Shawn Lane, Aquarium Rescue Unit and Phil Lesh.

 His memories of ?eastern countries? (he spent part of his childhood in Vietnam and Thailand) are of climbing trees and geckos slithering across the lawn. Now, he is ready to break fresh ground in the east with this brand new concord.

 While Miles Davis? Bitches Brew was the ?beginning of the best of his life?, the early fusion of Mahavishnu Orchestra was a huge influence as well, unfurling the greatness of the Billy Cobhams and Jack DeJohnettes.

 Calcutta can savour some of Sipe?s ?conversational style fusion music? he created with a duo he met in 1996, a duo the city is extremely familiar with. Swedish-born bass extraordinaire Jonas Hellborg, who keeps coming back, and ?Memphis guitar monster? the late Shawn Lane, who leaves behind the legacy of his lacerating licks.

 Machacek is regarded as one of the most talented contemporary guitarists from Europe, ?capable of doing legato like Holdsworth and staccato a la Steve Morse?. The Austrian, who exploded onto the scene with his Featuring Ourselves in 1999, is also adept at using computers in his compositions.

 Wife Sumitra, of Indian origin, whose new album Indian Girl presents a ?collection of finely woven pop numbers in a jazz setting?, will embellish the guitar-drums medley with her vocal range, also in an Indian debut.

 Congo Square, the non-profit society formed in 2002 to promote jazz and blues music in India, has been responsible for bringing in over 30 international jazz groups comprising leading musicians from the US and Europe.

 ?Our core group was proactive in promoting both overseas visitors and Indian talent, including epoch-makers like Shakti, Joe Williams, Mingus Dynasty and Shawn Lane. Our goal is to reach out to the maximum possible music lovers in Calcutta with a melange of jazz, blues, jazz-rock, rock ?n? roll, fusion?,? the spokesperson adds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 AnotherMetro suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 White danger lines on platform edges, Rabindrasangeet, funny films, sermons and penalty threats notwithstanding, yet another suicide took place in a Metro Railway station on Monday morning. 

 Arjun Punjabi, 45, jumped on the tracks of a Dum Dum-bound train at Central station and was killed on the spot.

 A Metro spokesperson said Punjabi had been waiting at the platform since 9 am. He jumped on the tracks as the train was entering the station at 9.08 am. 

 Although the driver applied the breaks, the train ran over Punjabi, resulting in his death. Services, disrupted for more than an hour following the suicide, resumed between Dum Dum and Girish Park station at 9.15 am. 

 Services between Tollygunge and Maidan were restarted five minutes later. Five pairs of trains were operated between the pairs of stations till normal services were restored at 10.30 am, said officers.

 Thousands of commuters were inconvenienced, as the disruption took place during peak hours. Punjabi?s suicide was the fourth at a Metro station this year. There have been seven suicide attempts in the Metro this year.

 Since Metro started operations, there have been 133 suicide attempts in its stations and 62 deaths. The highest number of suicide deaths on Metro tracks was recorded in 2001-02, when 13 people died. The figure was nine last year. 

 The highest number of suicide deaths ? seven ? has occurred at Kalighat and Jatin Das Park stations. Central station has so far seen six suicide attempts and three deaths.

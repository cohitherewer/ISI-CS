The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I had applied for a passport on May 31 after spending the entire day queueing 

at the passport office and depositing Rs 1,000 as processing fee for the same. 

On November 9, I received a computer-generated letter, sent by ordinary post, 

asking me to submit a PP form at the office within a month, failing which my application 

would be cancelled. Surprisingly, the letter was dated August 22. That means it 

had taken two months and a half for the letter to reach me. I had provided my 

mobile phone number on the application form. Shouldn?t the passport office notify 

such important matters over phone, or at least send the document by courier/speed 

post? Apart from all the effort I had put in, the Rs 1,000 I had deposited was 

also wasted.

POINT COUNTERPOINT 

 The applicant is supposed to fill up the PP form with his/her personal particulars 

and submit it to us. Usually, we send important documents to the applicants by 

speed post. Even if we have the phone numbers of the applicants with us, we don?t 

have the wherewithal to call up each of them regarding every issue. As of now, 

we are trying to respond to important e-mails and faxed letters from applicants 

through phone calls. It will take at least a year for us to put in place a system 

whereby applicants are called up in urgent matters. 

 M.K. Singh, 

Regional Passport Officer.

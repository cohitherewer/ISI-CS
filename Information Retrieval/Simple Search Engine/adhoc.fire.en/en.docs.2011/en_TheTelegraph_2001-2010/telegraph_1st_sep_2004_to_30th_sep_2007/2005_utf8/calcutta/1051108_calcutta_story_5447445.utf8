Tongue Twister 

A laid-back place with a personal touch and none of that part-of-a-chain feeling make Pam rsquo;s Cafe an ideal hangout, says musician and foodie NONDON BAGCHI

 The other day I spotted a well-thumbed, dog-eared copy of PG Wodehouses Right Ho, Jeeves. It was a 1950s Penguin publication, when all their paperbacks had the same design and the colour scheme told you to what category of literature the book belonged. At the tables around were other well-thumbed works by authors such as Woody Allen, Satyajit Ray, Arati Gangopadhyaya, Richard Bach, Arthur C. Clarke and others. J.D. Salinger and Richard Farina would fit in well here.

 I was sitting in a cosy, inviting little caf? in new Alipore, tastefully done up in cane and glass furniture, airy and bright, interesting bric-a-brac on the walls and shelves and in all an informal, laid-back place with a personal touch and none of that part-of-a-chain feeling about it.

 Pams Caf? is the name of the place and Pam is an acronym for Pallavi, Anindita and Madhusree who went to university together and always wanted to set up their own eatery. And now, years later, their plans have borne fruit. The books and other browsing material suggest that no one is in a hurry; you can relax and chill out and a group of six young people a couple of tables were doing doing just that, taking full advantage of the holiday season (it was Id that day), chewing the cud over an extended brunch.

 Foodwise, the USP of Pams is its selection of Frittatas, which are basically Italian omelettes that can be made with an amazing variety and combination of ingredients, the most consistently used ones being cheese and onions and to an extent, potatoes. All sorts of vegetables and herbs can be used ? broccoli, mushrooms, chives, truffles, zucchini, green, red and yellow peppers, spinach, tomatoes, corn, beans, parsley, tarragon, basil, dill and so on.

 Seafood, ham, bacon, sausage, shredded chicken and freshwater fish also go into Frittatas and all the permutations make for a wealth of healthy snacking, though Frittatas can form the mainstay of a fully fledged meal as well ? breakfast, lunch or dinner. Frittatas have come into tex-mex cuisine as well.

 The basic difference between omelettes as we know them and Frittatas is that omelettes usually have the cooked egg folded around a stuffing, whereas in a Frittata the egg mixture will form a base over which the other ingredients will be put ? sometimes the egg mixture is poured in over ingredients that have already been sauteed ? and importantly, a Frittata is always finished off by taking the frying pan off the fire and finishing it off in an oven by placing it under a grill to set the cheese and brown it lightly.

 At Pams, they make small Frittatas for an individual appetite ? not the big ones that can be cut up like a pizza. At present, they have four varieties ? Pasta Frittata (onion, tomato, green pepper, pasta and peas), Mushroom Frittata (mushroom, macaroni, onioned pepper), Chicken Frittata and Chicken Mushroom Frittata. Of course, all of them have cheese. And since they do a good tuna fish sandwich, may I suggest they use tuna in a Frittata as well?

 Sandwiches at Pams come plain or grilled, with a healthy stuffing. Interesting ones are Cheese and Raisin, Jam and Cheese, Potato Chaat Sandwich and a popular choice yet to feature on the menu (which will be in a state of flux and experimentation for some tome) is Cheese, Corn and Tomato with a layer of mint-coriander chutney over the butter. They do Club Sandwiches as well. Momos, steamed and fried, complete their selection of savoury items. 

 Then there are tea cakes? home made ? plain, chocolate or coffee flavoured and an assortment of cookies. A dessert item they do is Cr?me Brulee ? vanilla or coffee flavoured. Eight kinds of hot coffee, six of tea, milk shakes and a section called Coolers where the iced teas and coffees and mocktails are to be found. 

 The health-conscious will note that all the savoury dishes I mentioned earlier are cooked in olive oil. The postal address of Pams is 31, Ramtanu Lahiri Sarani, Block D, New Alipore. If you come south off the Majerhat Bridge and take the left turn into New Alipore from the Taratala crossing traffic light, Pams is at the end of the first turning to the right.

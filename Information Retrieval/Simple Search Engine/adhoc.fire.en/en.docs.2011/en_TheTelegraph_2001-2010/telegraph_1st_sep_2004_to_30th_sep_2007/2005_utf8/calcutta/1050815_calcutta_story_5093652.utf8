The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Syllabus shift offers national options

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Weighed down by an unwieldy Higher Secondary (HS) syllabus, students aspiring to become doctors and engineers from schools affiliated to the state council have to limit their efforts to taking the Bengal joint entrance board test only.

 But with the spilt in the curriculum, which comes into force from 2007, the students can sit for more national-level tests. ?Mark my word, Calcutta will soon produce more doctors and engineers, compared with other metros,? said an upbeat school education minister Kanti Biswas on Sunday.

 The optimism is shared by educationists. South Point School principal Jayati Solomon said: ?The split in the syllabus will definitely open up more scope for our students to sit for the national-level exams.?

 Starting 2007, HS questions will be based only on the syllabus of Class XII ? unlike the present system, in which the papers are set on the combined curricula of classes XI and XII.

 As this will considerably ease the load on students, they will have more time to prepare for the IIT-JEE and other national-level tests, such as All India Entrance Examinations in Engineering, Pre-Medical Test, Air Force Medical College entrance test and the Vellore Institute of Technology test.

 Now, even the meritorious students from the state council-affiliated schools do not take these entrance examinations. And the handful who do, do not fare well. The only option left for these students is the state-conducted joint entrance examination, as its curriculum is largely based on the HS syllabus.

 Most of the other entrance tests, on the contrary, follow the curricula of the Central Board of Secondary Education.

 Citing an example of the poor response to the all-India tests from the state, sources in the education department said not more than 5,400 students from HS council-affiliated schools across the state sat for the IIT-JEE this year. The figure from the city was less than 3,500.

 The number of candidates from states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and even Jharkhand varies from double to five times the figure from Bengal.

 In anticipation that the situation will change once the new system takes effect, city institutes engaged in coaching students for the state-joint entrance test have started restructuring their courses.

 ?Participation of Calcutta students in the national-level exams are now going to be far higher,? said Debdutta Sreemany, director, Pathfinder Educational Centre. ?Students have started thronging our institute to prepare for these tests.?

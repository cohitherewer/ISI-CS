 Rampage blame on laxity

 - Cops in a huddle, three-prong security shield for township

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Policing in Salt Lake had slackened over the past few months and it needs to be beefed up, a top cop said on Wednesday.

 ?People following a system for several years tend to become complacent and that?s what has happened in Salt Lake,? said Vageesh Mishra, inspector-general of police (south Bengal range), after a high-level meeting on improving security in the township.

 On Saturday night, a gang of four robbers had raided three houses in Salt Lake and raped a 15-year-old in front of her parents. The incidents have prompted a shake-up.

 ?We have drawn up a three-point action plan to make policing more effective in Salt Lake,? said Mishra.

 He announced that senior officers, including those of additional superintendent of police, sub-divisional police officer and deputy superintendent of police ranks, will henceforth conduct night patrolling in the township to oversee security arrangements.

 ?The number of officers in the community mobile service will be increased, and foot and vehicle patrolling and raids intensified. From now on, the service will be manned by an inspector,? the inspector-general elaborated.

 ?Police will depend more on the community. They will work in tandem with residents of the blocks,? he added.

 Private guards engaged by each block will be integrated into the policing system to bolster the safety shield. Domestic help and labourers working in the township will be provided with identity cards.

 ?If outsiders are found moving around in the township without their identity cards, they will be rounded up,? asserted another senior Salt Lake police officer.

 The meeting, which lasted over two hours, was also attended by deputy inspector-general of police (Presidency range) H.P. Singh, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar, the additional superintendent of police and the sub-divisional police officer of Salt Lake and three inspectors-in-charge of the township police stations.

 The three arrested in connection with the Saturday night raids ? Ziaul Laskar, Hasan Laskar and Khairul Mollah ? were produced at the Salt Lake sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court on Wednesday. They have been remanded in judicial custody till August 9.

 On Tuesday, Rabiul Laskar, the fourth member of the gang, was arrested in his home in Patharpratima, South 24-Parganas. He was also remanded in judicial custody. The identification parade will be held on July 29.

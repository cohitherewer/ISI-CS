 Loads of balloons, cut-outs of 

 a pretty Cinderella, a fairytale castle, horse-driven carriage, 

 Mickey, Tweety and Pooh? Ramp d?cor that matched the occasion 

 perfectly at the kids fashion show organised by Dalhousie 

 Institute (DI) on November 13.

 We came up with the concept last year and started with 23 kids. This year we have 49 participants. Brimming with enthusiasm and talent, these children have been an integral part of the whole preparation, smiles Denise Smith, council member in-charge of entertainment. 

 Compere Justin Alford introduced audiences to four fashion sequences ? traditional; spots, stripes and checks; casuals; party wear.

 Dressed in beautiful salwar suits, short kameezes with parallels to match and ghagra-cholis, the girls made a grand entry with diyas in hand. The boys followed in formals and sherwanis. 

 Next was the casual-wear round where the tiny tots sashayed smart minis matched with trendy boots, tie-on tops, T-shirts, funky three-quarters, denims and frocks. A little one dressed as Batman stole the show here.

 The kids even walked the ramp with their favourite playtime friend in hand. Some carried Barbie, others a copy of Harry Potter, some came with Beyblades and still others with a walkman or a handycam.

 Polka-dotted frocks, smart checks and stripes on shirts ruled the next sequence. Then mothers walked in graciously with their kids dressed in gorgeous party wear. 

 Finally, it was a set of cool dads who did the ramp round with babies in their arms.

 The show was choreographed by Nicola Gomes and Nabin Das was in charge of make-up. 

 The clothes were sponsored by Little Shop, Citimart and Magnolias Maggi Kiddies Corner. 

 To add to the fun, the children also put up self-choreographed dance items. They danced to chartbusters like Tauba tauba ishq main kariya and Just chill. 

 Nice nails

 Health specialists, hair specialists, skin specialists... And now, internationally-trained nail gel specialists.

 A nail gel session, the latest offering from June Tomkyns, promises nail enhancement, protection of brittle nails and an overall fashionable look for your hands and feet.

 One can also go for an artificial nail extension where nail specialists determine the suitability of the length, keeping in mind the customers daily routine, says Magda Roux, a beauty therapist with specialisation in the nails.

 Magda has trained the first crop of students at June Tomkyns in nail gel methods.

 Satya Narayan Das, Alevina D Souza, Esther Barker and Sharon Rodricks ? the first batch of trained nail gel experts ? were handed over certificates on the completion of their course, by June Tomkyns and the Kinectics Nail Academy, USA, recently.

 The short course trained the students on the basics of the proper use of nail products and the right techniques for a manicure. 

 It requires expertise for even very small things such as filing the nail without damaging the surface, or cleaning the nail plate before a nail gel session, explains Magda. 

 For those planning to take a try, a nail gel session lasts two to three weeks.

 Skin care

 VNS Marketing, the company that launched Mineral Line in Calcutta, has brought yet another skincare range to the city. Called Purederm, the line comprises products like nose strips, anti-wrinkle gel patches, daily facial cleansing cloths, oil blotting facial masks and feminine wipes, among others.

 The launch was marked by an interactive session at Middleton Chambers where representatives of Purederm demonstrated some of the products on city models Shreya and Barnali.

 Conducted by beauty consultant Bandana Mokta, the session displayed effective results of nose strips, 70 per cent mineral mud mask and age-defying eye gel masks.

 These products are suitable for all skin types and instant results are proven, says Bandana.

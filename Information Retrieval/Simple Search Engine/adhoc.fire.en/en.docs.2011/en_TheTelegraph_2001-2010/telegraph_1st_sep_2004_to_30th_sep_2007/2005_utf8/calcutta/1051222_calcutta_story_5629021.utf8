 Rare surgery saves housewife?s limb

 - PROSTHETIC REPLACEMENT IN CITY

 SUBHRO SAHA

 A rare tumour prosthetic knee replacement surgery at a Calcutta hospital has saved the limb of a young homemaker and propped up the image of the city?s healthcare delivery system immensely.

 Santosh Mohta, 38 and married with two sons, felt excruciating pain in her left knee joint with difficulty in walking. She was diagnosed with giant cell tumour (a locally aggressive tumour) at the upper end of the left tibia bone and operated on two years ago.

 ?When the tumour recurred recently, we took her to Chennai to consult a bone tumour specialist, but there wasn?t any definitive opinion,? says husband G.R. Mohta. The family lost all hope of saving Santosh?s leg when a visiting orthopaedic surgeon from Chennai suggested amputation.

 ?This was a hammer blow we couldn?t accept. After all, she is so young and has to raise the children,? says father M.K. Baheti. The fear of amputation took them back to orthopaedic surgeon Vikash Kapoor at the Armenian Church Trauma Centre off the EM Bypass, who had seen Santosh before.

 ?It was a very aggressive tumour and would have devoured the bone. We had three options ? fuse the knee, which would have rendered the joint immobile forever, amputate the limb above the tumour zone or go in for a most-advanced tumour prosthetic knee replacement,? Kapoor tells Metro.

 The team at the hospital chose the third option, using a hitherto untried process. The upper part of the leg bone (both tibia and fibula) was resected out and replaced with a GMRS (global modular replacement system), a latest-generation prosthesis supplied by a US firm.

 ?The GMRS tumour proximal tibia prosthesis replacement surgery with such an advanced knee replacement system was performed for the first time in the country,? stresses Kapoor, who led the surgical team. Santosh, who is recovering well, has been advised rest for six weeks to enable the muscles attach to the prosthesis.

 ?The price of this advanced prosthesis is Rs 4.5 lakh. But it?s the faith the family had in the city?s healthcare system that is commendable. The challenge here was to save the blood vessels and nerve supply to the lower portion of the limb and we replaced the entire bone segment. She will now have a functional leg for at least 20 years,? says Kapoor.

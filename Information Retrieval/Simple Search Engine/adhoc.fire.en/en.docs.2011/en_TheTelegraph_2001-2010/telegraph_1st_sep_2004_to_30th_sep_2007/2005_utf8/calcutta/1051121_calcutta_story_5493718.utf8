The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sync lights for car flow

 KINSUK BASU

 The blueprint of change is almost ready. In response to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s appeal for recasting the city?s traffic system, Calcutta Police have decided to synchronise traffic flow in four areas to ensure snarl-free movement. 

 Of these, the focus would be on the EM Bypass, the road tipped to take on heavier traffic in the days ahead. 

 If things fall in place, police claim a drive from the Ultadanga intersection to the Park Circus seven-point crossing should take not more than seven to eight minutes. 

 The signals will be synchronised in a manner that a driver will not have to stop at at least five intersections till the Park Circus crossing, like the Bypass-Maniktala Main Road junction, the Bypass-Beleghata Main Road intersection and even Parama island. 

 The two other zones where movement will be synchronised are Park Street and Chittaranjan Avenue.

 For someone planning to hit Park Street from AJC Bose Road, the plan aims to ensure that he does not have to stop at the Wood Street and Free School Street intersections before reaching JL Nehru Road. 

 While this might sound too small a phase for synchronisation, for police it remains a vital stretch, particularly during the peak hours. 

 Traffic police are taking a cautious approach on Chittaranjan Avenue. 

 In keeping with its previous effort to convert this arterial road into a ?green zone?? which later didn?t work out ? police will go in small phases, carefully monitoring the results in every phase. 

 To begin with, traffic movement will be synchronised on a small stretch from the Ganesh Chandra Avenue-Chittaranjan Avenue crossing to Colootolla Street, off the School of Tropical Medicine. 

The smallest stretch to be synchronised will be Writers? 

Buildings to the Mangoe Lane-Old Court House Street intersection.

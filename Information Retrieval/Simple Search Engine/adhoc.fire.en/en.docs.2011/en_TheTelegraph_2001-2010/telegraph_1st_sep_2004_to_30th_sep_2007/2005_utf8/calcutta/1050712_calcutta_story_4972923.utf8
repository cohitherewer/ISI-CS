 Mango for the monsoon

 - Show to popularise Uttar Pradesh produce

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The sultry summer days might be over in Calcutta, but the mango season need not be.

 Keeping in mind the Calcuttans? never-ending love for the golden fruit, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has taken the initiative to popularise in the city mangoes grown in the state. If the government has its way, sipping fresh mango juice or having mango kulfis while watching the rains might just become a way of life in Calcutta. 

 As part of the popularising mission, an exhibition of UP mangoes will be held on the Agri-Horticultural Society grounds in Alipore on July 16 and 17.

 ?There will be plenty to choose from. Free sampling and tasting will be offered. There would also be provision to buy the fruit. The idea is to give people here a taste of the fruit at a time when the local variety is disappearing from the markets,? an official of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) said on Monday.

 The show is being organised by the UP government, in association with the Agri-Horticultural Society, with support from APEDA.

 Apart from fresh UP mangoes of the chausa and daseri variety, among others, mangoes from Bengal will be on display. Products like squash, mango chutney and mango mustard sauce will also be available.

 ?For the Calcuttans, the best situation would be if the golden fruit is available in the markets at reasonable rates, throughout the year. Even if that is not possible, reasonably-priced mangoes can be made available in city markets till August,? the official stated.

 He added that the main idea behind the show is to extend the mango season. ?People here tend to think that quality mangoes are available only in summer. We want to change the mindset and make them feel that fresh mangoes can be had even during monsoon.? 

 A Mango Mahotsav was held between June 30 and July 3 on the Agri-Horticultural Society grounds, where over 200 varieties of the fruit from UP, Bihar and Orissa were on display.

 The department of food processing industries and horticulture had also organised a successful promotion for mangoes in Singapore. Organised in association with APEDA and a local cooperative from June 9 to 15, the promotion included meets with buyers and sellers.

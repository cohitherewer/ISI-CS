 Their counterparts have already done it in Mumbai. But better late than never for a clutch of classical musicians in the city to come forward in aid of tsunami survivors.

 Getting together under the banner of Birds on their Wings, renowned classical musicians from the city and outside will stage a nightlong concert on February 12 at the Science City auditorium. But the Dover Lane-style concert will go a little beyond enthralling connoisseurs of Indian classical music, and garner funds for the survivors of the killer waves.

 The line up of performers should enthuse most music lovers: Shiv Kumar Sharma on santoor; Rajan Sajan Mishra, Rashid Khan and Subhra Guha on vocals; Purbayan Chatterjee on sitar; Ramesh Mishra on sarangi and Sanatan Goswami on harmonium.

 A special treat will be the tabla players. The list includes Swapan Chowdhury, Kumar Bose, Anindo Chatterjee, Subhankar Banerjee, Bikram Ghosh and Samir Chatterjee.

 The event, organised by Ragranjani and Mrittika, will hand over Rs 1 lakh to the Chief Minister Relief Fund. 

 Besides waiving their performance fees, the musicians themselves will contribute individually to the cause.

 ?As responsible citizens, musicians of Calcutta have come together to share their grief and help the survivors,? said Vijay Kichlu of ITC Sangeet Research Academy, who has been instrumental in getting the musicians together, at the announcement of the concert on Wednesday.

 ?Besides the aid for tsunami survivors, this movement has a long-term objective,? explained Kichlu.

 ?The younger generation is drifting away towards western culture and forgetting the excellence of our own traditions. It is essential we preserve it and create an environment of good music which is rich, full of excellence and devoid of gimmicks,? he added.

 Yogdaan, a similar effort in Mumbai led by Zakir Hussain, saw Indian classical music exponents such as Pandit Jasraj, Kishori Amonkar, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Sultan Khan and others raise money for the relief and rehabilitation efforts.

 Pandit Jasraj had made a personal donation of Rs 1 lakh.

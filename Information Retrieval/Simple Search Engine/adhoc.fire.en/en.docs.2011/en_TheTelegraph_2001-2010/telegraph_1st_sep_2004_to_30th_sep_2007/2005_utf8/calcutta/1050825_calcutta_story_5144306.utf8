 Tailoring a twin treat

 She has been creating couture for the Japanese for nearly two decades now and promoting Indian culture and fashion in the land of the rising sun.

 After working there for more than 17 years, designer Jayasree Chatterjee is back in her hometown. And as a comeback gift, the lady has two design studios up her sleeve, both of which will be inaugurated today.

 Located at 8, Circus Market Place in Beckbagan and 7, Sarat Bose Road, both the boutiques have been named Jayasree, after the designer. 

 While the Beckbagan store will house causal wear, the Sarat Bose Road one will offer more high-end stuff, says Chatterjee.

 Her casual wear or pret collection comprises kurtis, salwar suits, skirts and light saris, all priced between Rs 500 and Rs 4,000. 

 It is, however, the couture line that Chatterjee is more excited about. The couture line has a royal look, but its not overtly opulent. Having worked in Japan for several years, I have known the beauty of minimalism and subtlety, she smiles.

 Saris, lehngas and ethnic skirts in rich fabrics like brocade, pure silk, chiffon, crepe, georgette and tussar have been worked upon with zardosi, aari, kantha and chikankari.

 The palette is rich and vibrant, with reds and magentas aplenty. The line is priced at Rs 3,000-plus.

 My ultimate aim is to combine elements of Japan and India in my creations, says the designer who has always worked with Indian natural fabrics and ethnic craft forms.

 Going places

 After having unveiled his creations in the halls of the Indian Embassy in the UK last month, Calcutta designer Pritam Panda is set to showcase in Singapore now.

 The stylist will launch his latest line at the Singapore Fashion Festival 2005 on August 26.

 The festival that started from August 20 is Singapores most-awaited annual fashion event. The first four days of the fashion week was devoted to the trade fair, with 76 designers from various parts of the globe strutting their stuff. The last two days feature shows by 10 designers.

 I would be showcasing 38 ensembles, most of which would be skirts in various shapes, paired with corsets, camisoles, kaftans, along with a few saris. The collection is called the Desi Diva Girl, reveals Pritam.

 High on glamour, the collection emphasises ornamentation of the fabrics with semi-precious stones, Swarovski crystals, metal plates cut and moulded into floral patterns, patchwork, zardosi and Kashmiri work. 

 The colours are bright, juxtaposed with muted shades and vice-versa, mostly reds, blacks, Pakistani greens and beige.

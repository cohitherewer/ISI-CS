 Just one young designer by the name of Arjun Khanna dared to unveil an exclusively mens collection on the final day of the recent Lakme India Fashion Week (LIFW) 2005 in Delhi.

 For the most part, designers at the countrys most hyped fashion event used a sprinkling of mens silhouettes to complement their womens wear lines, while others gave the men a complete miss.

 While Indian haute couture is undeniably biased in favour of women, city designers point out a discernible change in demand, which they feel, has evolved from its blue-shirt-black-trouser code of old.

 ?Even five years ago, men in the city wore a mundane and stiff look. They were averse to experimentation and fashion was considered a womans prerogative,? feels designer Sayon Mitra. But this mindset is now changing. ?Its visible in the flamboyance in mens dressing these days,? he points out.

 With global mens wear majors opening shop in the city and the ?metrosexual man? becoming the most happening thing to be, guys are getting their style in place. The big brands are fuelling the fetish, making latest international designs and fabrics available in town. Major brands unveil separate spring-summer and autumn-winter collections, unthinkable even a few years ago.

 ?Mens fashion in India is evolving very fast. These days the latest international trends hit India almost simultaneously. But they are of course customised according to the taste and needs of Indian men,? says B. Chaudhary, general manager, sales and marketing, Blackberrys. The brand launched its spring-summer 2005 line in the city on Thursday.

 When it comes to summer dressing, pastels rule the racks, with focus on whites and off whites. While the palette is much the same this year too, there is innovation with the textures.

 ?White and shades of white rule mens wear in summer. This time, however, we have played around with the structure of the fabric, mostly linen. For instance, self stripes and checks woven into the fabric give the shirts a very interesting look,? adds Chaudhary. 

 Trousers, which are most neglected by top designers, have had a makeover, thanks to the brands this season. Like the shirts, trousers are sporting structured designs. ?The favourite fit this season will be the straight leg,? explains Chaudhary.

 With the emergence of lounge culture in the city, a new genre has been born ? lounge wear or casual evening wear. Pastels dominate the palette in this segment too, but the monotony of the colour story is broken by interesting cuts and prints. Polkas in vibrant hues dot mens shirts. Spread collars and square cuffs are the visible innovations.

 ?For the metrosexual man, the day doesnt end at 5 pm. Unwinding and chilling out with friends in the evening is an integral part of his schedule. And this is where lounge wear comes in,? says designer Abhishek Dutta.

 The spring-summer collection from Arrow is a good pointer towards this seasons evening wear trend. The Arrow Urban collection is divided into Encircled and Motifs. Polka dots in jacquard weaves dominate the Encircled collection. The colours used are black, navy blue, sea green, cherry red, yellow and sky blue. When it comes to fabrics for men, linen is the star, followed by fine cotton, stretch cotton, and light denims.

 Two lives lost in scooter joyride

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Two teenagers were killed and a third seriously injured in a road mishap in Howrah early on Monday. 

 Brothers Ayush Tibrewal, 14, and Aditya Tibrewal, 15, went for a scooter ride along with cousin Ravi Jain, 14, at Liluah Colony, a kilometre-and-a-half from their residence at 18, Joybibi Road. 

 While they were returning around 5.30 am, a lorry coming from the opposite direction hit the scooter on GT Road, near Liluah Chhota Gate. Aditya was thrown off by the impact of the collision. 

 The lorry dragged Ayush and Rabi about 15 metres from the spot. Rabi was killed instantly while Ayush died on his way to a local nursing home. 

 Aditya was admitted to the nursing home with critical injuries. 

 Police impounded the lorry but the driver fled.

 The boys, who studied in Class VII, had recently learnt to ride a scooter and couldn?t resist a spin at dawn, a member of the Tibrewal family said.

 ?I don?t know what to say. Rabi, who was the son of Ayush and Aditya?s maternal uncle, came to spend his holidays at our place on Saturday. He stayed in Cossipore with his family. We repeatedly told the boys not to take the two-wheeler on to GT Road, but they wouldn?t listen,? lamented the boys? uncle, Radheshyam Tibrewal. 

 Ayush and Aditya?s father Ashoke is a businessman. The three were riding his scooter. ?We are not even trying to console Ashoke and his wife Sarala. They are beyond consolation,? Radheshyam lamented.

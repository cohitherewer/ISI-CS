 Wrangle ends on Maidan custody

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The legal battle between the Central and state governments over the control of Brigade Parade Grounds came to an end on Thursday after the high court disposed of the case. 

 ?Both the Centre and the state government are like brothers now. There should be no more conflict over the custody of the Maidan,? the court observed.

 Both Rabilal Moitra, government pleader, and Uttam Majumdar, who represented the Union government, admitted that no differences existed on the Maidan issue.

 ?Now they (the state and the Centre) are jointly planning to beautify the lung of the city. In many of the issues relating to the development of the Maidan, they are taking similar views,? petitioner Subhas Dutta told the court. 

 The case came up for hearing on Thursday before the division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice R.N. Sinha. The court expressed its satisfaction over the role of the state government, army, political parties and also environmental activists, including the petitioner, in taking up programmes to beautify the Brigade Parade Grounds.

 ?The army has decided to allow some private parties to beautify the Maidan. Some of the parties have already come forward with their plans. But there is a dark side to the matter. The army as the custodian of the Maidan cannot allow private companies to make profits through their development programmes,? Dutta told the court.

 Without taking any names, he said ?there are certain organisations that are destroying the environment for the sake of their businesses and coming forward to make gardens on the Maidan?. 

 The army should find better reasons for allotting plots to entrepreneurs, he added.

 Dutta criticised the army for its dual policy in allowing private parties to introduce entry fees in the areas developed by them.

 ?The army has allowed an organisation to introduce an entry fee in the park on the Maidan. But it is not allowing the state government to collect Rs 2 from the visitors of Eden Gardens,? Dutta claimed.

 Appearing for the army, R.N. Dutta assured the court that no private company will be allowed to put up barbed-wire fencing on the Maidan.

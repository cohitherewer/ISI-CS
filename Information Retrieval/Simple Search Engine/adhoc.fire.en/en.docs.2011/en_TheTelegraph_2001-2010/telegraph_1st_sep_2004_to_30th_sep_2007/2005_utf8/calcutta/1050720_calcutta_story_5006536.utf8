 Travel wide, north by north-west 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

Q: My father is a chartered accountant holding 

a high post in a multinational company. He is very busy and can hardly take out 

time for a family vacation. Even when he manages to make time, something or the 

other happens at the last minute. Either he has to travel urgently for a business 

trip or some family member falls ill. Many a time we have packed our suitcases 

only to unpack them again. Please help.

Tejas

The Solution: 

The north-west area is known for its movement, representing travel. Next time 

you plan a holiday, place your travel tickets and other documents in this corner. 

Do not forget to place a family photograph alongside the tickets. Putting a picture 

or a model of the mode of transport along with your packed suitcases in this area 

will surely see you through to your holiday destination. If you are still doubtful, 

highlight your destination on a map with a yellow pen and write the word visited 

in block letters.

Q: My daughter is going to Pune to pursue a 

BBA degree at a reputed college. Though I am very happy, I am also a little worried. 

She is leaving her protected environment and will now have to face the real world. 

I am afraid she could fall into bad company and lose focus. What steps can be 

taken to ensure she stays away from bad elements?

Devyani

The Solution: Congratulations 

on your daughters achievement. Advise her to carry a family photograph to 

place on the eastern side of her room. This will keep her connected with her family 

and provide her with the strength needed to face obstacles in her academic life. 

Also advise her to place her mentors photograph, poster and motivating quotes 

on the northern wall of her room. She will draw inspiration from these and will 

never deviate from her desired aim. Such a focused environment will prevent her 

from falling into bad company. Moreover, strong upbringing and the moral values 

inculcated in her by you will always be with her. Have faith in your values and 

have faith in your daughter.

Q: The entrance to my passage is very narrow. 

I plan to buy a large mirror to give a spacious effect to it. However, if the 

mirror is placed here, it will reflect my kitchen and the stove. Is this advisable?

Kusum

The Solution: Mirrors 

are considered very powerful because they magnify the energy of whatever they 

reflect. Here the mirror would reflect your stove and hence the fire energy. Too 

much fire energy in the house would increase the temper of the family members. 

Since it is very close to the entrance, it will have a greater impact. The family 

members will experience unnecessary difference of opinions leading to arguments 

and quarrels. I would suggest either shift the stove to a place where its reflection 

does not appear in the mirror or place the mirror where it reflects something 

more positive, pleasant and comforting.

Q: I have finalised a flat on the third floor 

of a five-storied building. In the building layout, the south-west area has been 

planned as a kitchen space, but the family living on the first floor has converted 

it into a master bedroom. Even I am planning to do the same. But the second and 

fourth-floor residents are sticking to the building layout. Should I go ahead 

with my plans?

Rajan

The Solution: 

The south-west is the best area for a master bedroom. However, in your case, I 

would suggest you do not make this your master bedroom, as it will be sandwiched 

between the kitchens on the upper and lower floors. This can cause disturbed sleep 

and health problems according to Feng Shui. Sleeping in a room that has a bedroom 

above or below it is certainly a better option.

 From the travels of Tintin through Peru, the Ottoman Empire and Tibet to the deplorable garbage situation in Goa; from the rustic eastern highlands of the country to the rich heritage of Rajasthan ? fashion focussed on things far and near this weekend as the city witnessed the fall/winter 2005-06 edition of the Blenders Pride Fashion Tour (BPFT).

 The multi-city fashion event, that will roll on to Chandigarh, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune, was kicked off in Calcutta on Friday with the star-studded combination of designers JJ Valaya, Raghavendra Rathore, Rajesh Pratap Singh and Wendell Rodricks.

 Held in association with The Oberoi Grand, the two-day style extravaganza was flagged off with the subdued elegance of Rathore on Friday, while the second half of the evening was taken over by Valayas vibrant show. The early part of Saturday was reserved for Prataps structured look, while Wendells signature sensuous style formed the grand finale.

 The list of catwalkers included ramp-scorchers like Deepika Padukone, Sheetal Malhar, Jesse Randhawa, Dipannita Sharma, Viveka Babaji, Nina Manuel, Carol Gracious, Joey Mathews, Kiran Rao, Michelle Innes, Shonalika Shetty, Diandra Soares, Upen Patel and Muzamil Ibrahim.

 Desert drapes

 Simple sophistication was the message from Raghavendra Rathore, with his line bearing the classy touch the prince of Jodhpur is famous for.

 Slim-fitted jackets, cigarette pants, flowing kurtas and floor-hitting dresses, tops and skirts of different cuts presented a global line made of rich traditional Indian textures.

 The colours were subdued ? black, brown, silver, grey and neutrals. Prints in floral as well as abstract motifs enhanced the clothes.

 Comic couture

 Unveiled on the ramp next was an extension of JJ Valayas India Fashion Week collection. From the inspiration to the accessories, the similarities were too many to ignore.

 Valayas collection for the fall/winter season is a tribute to the genius of Georges Remi, popularly known as Herge, the creator of the worlds favourite reporter ? Tintin.

 The collection revolves around three components of the Tintin series ? Prisoners of the Sun, Bashi Bazouk and Tibet ? drawing from the various countries they are set in.

 The first line inspired by Peru was in black and ivory, with Inca motifs and woven fabrics further accentuated by rough wool and crystal embroidery and beaded detailing. The second sequence ? drawn from a Captain Haddock expletive ? was based on Bashi Bazouks of the Ottoman army. An antique palette, subdued surface treatments, lots of layers and textures defined the look. The show culminated with a vibrant line inspired by Tibet ? corsets, raw silk embroideries and vivid prints jostled with modern styling and detailing.

 Haute high

 Expectations were high at the beginning of Day II, as the countrys hottest young design talent Rajesh Pratap Singh showcased in Calcutta for the first time. And Pratap did live up to every bit of the expectations.

 Trademark structured and fitted silhouettes ? tunics, puff-sleeved shirts, long dresses, trousers, jackets and skirts of various shapes and textures ? formed the line.

 With a cult feel and folk influences, the rustic collection is drawn from the eastern highlands of India, with a spicy modern adaptation. The palette comprised lots of black, shades of grey, wines and greens in a collage of traditional textiles from the hills. Wool, wool blends, felts, silk jacquards and some leather shaped the clothes. Understated elegance was the name of the game with minimal surface ornamentation and uniform floral motifs.

 White magic

 After wowing Calcutta with a gorgeous spring/summer line through BPFT earlier this year, Wendell Rodricks was back in the city with yet another stunner. Signature dreamy drapes in pristine whites defined the Goa-based designers White Wizard look for the forthcoming season.

 Yards of flowing fabrics ? chiffons, crepes, nets, lycra and jersey ? enhanced with reels of ribbons, created an ethereal effect.

 Its a very young and sexy collection for the global woman. These are ensembles one can wear to red carpets. And the palette is of course my favourite white, said Wendell, the only designer who came down to the city for the fashion tour.

 While last Februarys edition of BPFT saw his men in whites, this time the colours were reversed with the guys draped in all-black.

 Wendells finale was, however, a deviation from his style story of the evening, as the stylist used his creativity to fight for yet another cause.

 A black dress, paraded on the ramp by model Deepika Padukone, was made of plastic bags, as a protest against the deteriorating garbage situation in Goa, his home town. Unfortunately, the protest point was lost on most in the audience.

 The garbage disposal system in Goa has completely broken down in the past few months and the entire place is in a mess right now. This is shameful since Goa is a major tourist destination. The government must so something about it and mine is just a small endeavour to highlight the menace, explained the designer.

 HS tips to study all, score more

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The old formula of pick-and-choose preparation for the higher secondary (HS) examinations is being foiled.

 After making the HS course objective in nature to compete with the ICSE and CBSE boards, the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education is now preparing a fresh set of guidelines on the right route to study the course under the revised system.

 To ensure that students best benefit from the revised HS course and question pattern, the dominant directive seems to be: ?Do not pick and choose chapters?. 

 The council, for the first time, has decided to allot equal marks weightage to each chapter in every subject. 

 An official of the council said: ?It is a must for every HS examinee now to study the whole syllabus in each and every subject thoroughly.?

 A study carried out by the council before preparing the guidelines has revealed how HS students have been adopting ?a number of wrong methods? in preparing for their exams for the past 28 years. 

 For instance, more than 90 per cent of HS examinees in a particular year were found to not touch topics on which questions had been set the previous year. The students would adopt such a strategy as the council generally did not repeat a question in two consecutive years.

 Another finding revealed more than 50 per cent students were basing their preparations wholly on the question papers of the past five years. 

 This was prompted by the impression that an examinee could easily get a good number of ?common questions? from that past pool.

 And those taking an even greater risk would pare down their preparations to topics and chapters on which questions were based every alternate year.

 ?We have plugged all these loopholes and designed the syllabus and also the question pattern in such a way that no student will be able to get through the exams by adopting any of these strategies for selective studies,? said the council official.

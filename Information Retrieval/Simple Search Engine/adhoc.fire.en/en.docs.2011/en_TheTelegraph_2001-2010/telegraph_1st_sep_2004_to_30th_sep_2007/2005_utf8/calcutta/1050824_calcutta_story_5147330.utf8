 North Point School, Darjeeling: Getting the old boys together to raise funds

 Come September 17 and teachers, principals and students of schools in the city and beyond will come together for a fun quiz, aimed to bring the alumni associations of institutions together. Organised by North Point Alumni Association, the quiz is ?just an excuse to get the old boys to get to know each other better?.

 To be held at the Oberoi Grand, the quiz, to be conducted by Barry O?Brien, is open to ex-students mainly, but even teachers and principals can represent the school. There?s also no limit to the number of three-member teams that a school can send in. After a written preliminary round, the top teams will fight it out in the final, expected to be a heady concoction of ?everything from food to fashion to films to the more serious stuff?.

 ?Apart from making it an evening to remember, we want to collect funds for our alma mater,? said Mukesh Mulchandani, secretary of the association. ?While we are kicking off with the quiz show, we have many other plans to make the association actively involved with cultural activities.?

 There?s already a lot of interest being generated, with former students of St Xavier?s, Calcutta Boys, La Martiniere, South Point and Loreto confirming their presence. Also gearing up for the fresh round of mind challenge are known faces from the quizzing circuit, like Souvik Guha, Tathagata Chatterjee and Philip Antunis.

 To make the occasion even more fun, spouses of students are being allowed to be part of the teams. What?s more, there?s a special prize for schools sending in the most number of teams for the quiz.

 ?More than teams participating or winning the quiz, what?s important is to have large crowds from each school egging their team on and really getting into the act,? said O?Brien. ?So, while the brainy few will sit at the quiz table, the passionate ones will scream away from the audience.?

 After the quiz, there will be dinner and dance to round off the reunion act. ?Although it is DJ music, the songs will be mostly from the 60s and 70s. There will be a peep into the 50s for the really old boy and maybe an odd number from the 80s,? added O?Brien.

 The remarkable improvement in students? performance in English over the past year is one of the biggest surprises of Higher Secondary 2005.

 Compared with last year?s success rate, the pass percentage in the 2005 examinations has increased by nearly five per cent. After announcing the results, officers of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education said the overall success rate had improved this year because fewer students had failed in English.

 ?We have not been able to carry out a detailed analysis of the 2005 results yet. But a quick comparison of the performance in English over the past three years definitely indicates a satisfactory success rate this time,? said Gopa Dutta, council president.

 In the past few years? Higher Secondary results, the maximum number of failures was in English, and the current trend indicates that the pass percentage can rise considerably if large-scale failures in the subject can be checked. 

 In 2004, the overall pass percentage in Higher Secondary was 62.60 per cent. That is, 37.40 per cent of the students had failed, nearly 35 per cent of whom were unable to clear the English exam. The remaining two per cent had failed in other subjects.

 This year, the number of students unsuccessful in English is less than 30 per cent. 

 Kanti Biswas, school education minister, said the government had sanctioned a number of teaching posts for Higher Secondary, many in English. ?We have made it a point to ensure that each and every school maintains high teaching standards in English,? the minister said.

 Council officers feel that the performance of students in English will be better in the years ahead as the syllabus has been substantially revised this year. Modern teaching techniques will be introduced from the current academic session as well. 

 Better performance in other subjects, too, has contributed to the success rate. Failures in economics, chemistry and mathematics are lower this year. 

 Biswas said the council will soon set up a committee to find out how the standards of English teaching and performance can be bettered. 

 ?First, we will have to identify the regions where students are not faring well in English,? Biswas said. ?Thereafter, we will take remedial steps. This should go a long way in improving the performance.?

 Old boys? club goes beyond borders

 - Now, a Singapore chapter 

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 ROOTS: Father P.C. Mathew (centre) in Singapore for the inauguration of the new chapter of the St Xavier?s College (Cal) Alumni Association

 Annual reunion bashes, a rare event or two and, in between, long periods of hibernation. If that is the stuff college alumni associations are meant to be made of, the St Xavier?s College (Cal) Alumni Association is not treading the beaten path.

 Since its inception in 1985, the alumni association has been busy with various social and philanthropic activities. And now, it?s taken the first step towards having a presence beyond national boundaries by setting up a Singapore chapter.

 ?We are very much alive and highly dynamic. Opening the chapter in Singapore was just the first step. Very soon, the alumni will have chapters in West Asia, USA and Europe? Xaverians based in Singapore have assured us of their continuous support in all alumni ventures,? says Father P.C. Mathew, principal, St Xavier?s College, and president, St Xavier?s College (Cal) Alumni Association.

 To start with, members of the Singapore chapter have already set into motion a series of initiatives aimed at providing a financial support structure for students on the Park Street campus who are unable to support themselves through college.

 Says Imran Zaki Siddiqui, general secretary of the alumni association: ?Arvind Agarwalla, one of the driving forces behind the Singapore chapter, has set up a trust fund that will provide loans to students unable to meet the financial requirements of the course. The student will have three years after he/she graduates to pay back the loan.?

 Agarwalla has also pledged to recruit students from the college as interns to work in his software company.

 This, said Imran, was an embodiment of the Xaverian motto of Nihil Ultra, signifying a sense of universal brotherhood and belonging. There was once ?a Xaverian club started by the students?, recounted Father Mathew. ?Rabindranath Tagore was the first Xaverian to give concrete shape to the alumni association in the late 1930s, and he was, in fact, its first president.?

 But the association could not sustain itself, until the St Xavier?s College (Cal) Alumni Association came into being in 1985, with students high on nostalgia in the wake of the institution?s 125-year celebrations.

 The Holy Grail for the association will be the successful completion and inauguration of the college?s new address at Salt Lake. The campus, which plans to incorporate a state-of-the-art media centre, courses in bio-science, information technology and management studies, is scheduled for inauguration in 2010, when St Xavier?s celebrates its sesquicentennial year.

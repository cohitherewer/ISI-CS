The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kudos for changing climes

 Erhard Zander, outgoing German consul-general, reminisces about his stint in a city in flux

 When i arrived, it was quite a surprise. Calcutta was one of the German diplomatic missions selected for cost-cutting, and I told myself it can?t be true. Of course, I could not assess the complete situation, but there was no mistaking the climate of ongoing development. A lot of things were coming up, just like a mushroom farm ? suddenly it?s there for everyone to see.

 It was strange because when I went back to Germany after a year, I had to sort of apologise. ?Why are you in Calcutta?? they asked. I said: ?Why, it?s a very interesting place, even for German economy?. Of course, few believed me because to most, Calcutta was only about Mother Teresa. But after three years, that has changed completely. For those who are in the export business in Europe, know that India is a big chance for economic cooperation, next only to China.

 The perception of Calcutta and, indeed, India has changed. Now when I say I have come from India, they ask me, ?What can we do for you?? When you are here for too long, you don?t see the changes, but it?s noticeable. Whether all of it is good, I don?t know. Like all old cities, it?s a compromise. On one hand, you need space for development, on the other you have to preserve what?s nice and precious in Calcutta. 

 I think India and Calcutta will find their own solutions. Now Indians travel a lot outside, and when they come back, they know what to do. The government has changed too. It?s very favourable now. So, while I?m a little sad because I?m leaving, at the same time, I?m glad that my successor will come to a completely different environment than the one I came to. So he has to pick up, so to speak, from where I left. 

 Now, shopping malls are everywhere, things are changing. Foreign investment is coming to Calcutta and also the willingness of Indians from elsewhere to invest in Calcutta is encouraging. They would now like to have a foot in the door of the city. So the trick for me was how to get German investment into Calcutta. Here, Mumbai has an edge, simply because it is closer to Germany, even if by just two hours. The good news though is that Lufthansa has reopened its office in Calcutta. That?s a first sign that they are looking at Calcutta in a positive vein. Also Siemens has been here for a long time. And unlike China, here you don?t need foreign directors, because almost everyone speaks English and that?s a huge plus.

 Shortly after I arrived in Calcutta, there was a big seminar organised here and the topic was ?The EU ? a model for modern India?. Now, I would turn it around to ?India ? a model for EU?. What I want to say is we can learn from each other. The tenacity of Indian business, specially the small enterprises, is tremendous. The intensity with which they pursue their aims is praiseworthy. I have never seen an Indian give up, while in Germany, they often give up before even starting because they feel it might not work out. We have lost the drive and can look to India for inspiration.

 I don?t think Calcutta is a lazy city and the tag doesn?t do it justice at all. Of course, the idea here is kind of ?thought before action?. And if anything, the climate invites you to talk and think. It?s green, things are growing and you know somebody will provide the food, all year round. In Europe, there?s a season when there?s no food and you have to prepare. So Calcutta is really advantaged in that respect. Also, Bengal is so rich in agriculture, a strength which should be leveraged. Processing food is a great opportunity. That?s where the money is, trying to preserve it, and not allow food produce to go waste or get spoiled.

 I have hugely admired (state IT minister) Mr (Manab) Mukherjee and (principal secretary, IT) Mr (G.D.) Gautama. They are trying very hard to project the city in good light. However, it?s not such a good idea to put all your eggs in the IT basket. The IT sector can?t absorb 80 million people. It can at best be a cash cow for the rest of the economy, to develop other sectors. So you must identify areas where money is needed and one such area is food and food processing.

 A lot of changes will take place in Calcutta over the next few years, and a company like Metro (the German wholesale foodstuff major) can act as catalyst, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises in the food sector. Again, if Posco sells steel in Orissa, that will reflect on Calcutta. They might have a factory there, but Calcutta is the real logistics hub for the region. If Orissa is gaining because of steel, it?s good for West Bengal too. It?s competition, but that?s healthy. Also, it?s good when your neighbours do well, because they are your best customers. 

 I was told as a diplomat, the first thing you must learn is how to play golf, and I couldn?t pick up the game. But I know golf is an excellent communicator, where you meet people very informally, without any commitment. And I?m happy the Consular Corps golf tournament has created an effective platform for positive branding of the city. 

 Perception has changed for people who have genuine interest in Calcutta, not for those who simply know Calcutta is somewhere east of Germany. Thirty years ago, we wanted to be friends with India and had movies on Indian villages screened back home. From a public relations point of view, that doesn?t make much sense. You must influence people who make decisions and have the money. 

 So, the next step, something West Bengal hasn?t quite done yet, is to invite people to come and look at what you have to offer. It?s ok to wait for business delegations, but it?s better to actively invite them and get them here. For instance CeBIT was a great thing, because suddenly you had Calcutta there, talking to people and businesses from around the world. The city has been like a bride who sits at home looking for a husband, instead of going out and finding one for herself.

 Paying a pilgrimage to Mother House is fine, but it?s like an old church; it?s history. What Calcutta lacks is a proper city centre. You have a lot of beautiful spaces, and in between, you have slums. Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square can both be wonderful vehicles to attract tourists. You need things like the Metropolitan Building makeover. You need this, because any foreign investor will come here once and then come back with his wife. If the investor says ?yes?, and the wife says ?wait, what will I do out here?, nothing will come out of it. That?s something which can be easily addressed, because Calcutta by nature, is a very green area, whereas brown is the predominant colour in many parts of the country. Look at the Maidan here, it has so much possibility!

 As I pack my bags and look back at the past three years, I gather a clutch of fond memories to tuck away, the fondest being about Calcutta?s people. They are witty and warm, not mean and cynical, and very friendly to foreigners. Calcutta embraces everybody. Also Calcuttans are very tolerant, they don?t enforce their will on my behaviour. 

 PS: Please don?t get rid of your trams. Believe me, it could be the best system in the world. In Germany, they got rid of trams in many cities in the 50s and 60s, and now tears are rolling.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Agents boycott carrier 

 Our Special Correspondent

 Singapore Airlines? Diwali Dhamaka offer ? of a Singapore round trip for just Rs 5,900 in November and December ? has a string attached, which threatens to make the scheme a non-starter in the city. 

 Travel agents in Calcutta decided on Thursday ?not to support? the carrier for its refusal to refund a large chunk of the tax component of the fare to those who cancel their ticket. 

 The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) and the Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) unanimously decided to give the ?least preference? to Singapore Airlines.

 ?If a person has not travelled, how can you deny him the refund?? asked Alka Rathi, TAAI chairperson (east). 

 The airline claimed it would refund the airport tax (Rs 700), which forms a small part of the tax component. The rest of the Rs 5,000-plus tax, comprising the fuel surcharge and the administration fee, will be held back.

 ?Airlines introduce fares and promotions to offer the best to customers and attach some conditions for availing of these offers,? said Bharat Mahadevan, manager (east) of Singapore Airlines. 

 ?This is practised by several players in the industry. Also, the rules under the computerised reservation system state that for the lowest fare (T-class, under which the Diwali offer falls), the air fare, fuel surcharge and administration fee are not refundable. The airport tax has to be refunded, but only after a processing fee is paid,? he added.

 TAFI secretary Manish Choubey, on the other hand, said: ?The airline?s tax component is more than the fare. It?s strange that they have refused to refund the fuel surcharge, even if a person has not travelled.?

 The travel agents have also decided to boycott gatherings the airline will organise. ?Recently, another Singapore-based airline had announced that it would refund the taxes. What Singapore Airlines is doing is unacceptable,? added TAFI chairman (east) Anil Punjabi.

 Keeping with its reputation of springing a surprise every now and then, Singapore Airlines had recently announced a special fare of Rs 5,900 for a round trip to Singapore and Rs 6,000 to Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Bangkok.

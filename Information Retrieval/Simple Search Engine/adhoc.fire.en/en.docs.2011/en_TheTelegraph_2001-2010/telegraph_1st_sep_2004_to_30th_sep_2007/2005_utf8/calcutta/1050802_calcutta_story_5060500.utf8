 My initiation into the cuisine of Andhra Pradesh was during a short holiday to Gopalpur-on-Sea near the Orissa-Andhra border. We had not checked in to a regular hotel but had rented a couple of rooms and had the option of organising our own food or eating out at one of the small places they had on the single little main street of this resort.

 We managed to go one better. A middle-aged Telegu lady with an infectious, toothy grin, weathered by sun and sea offered to cook for us. We would have to provide the raw materials ? fish and vegetables mainly, and she would get all the condiments. Good deal. I found myself looking out for when the local fisherfolk were going to return to shore with the days catch and for a few days we feasted on spicy, fiery curries full of chilli paste both red and green, sometimes flavoured with coconut milk or paste, sometimes green with coriander. Pomfret ? the smooth, silvery ones as well as the larger, darker variety with scales ? mackeral, large crayfish and on a couple of occasions shark meat, formed our diet. Somedays we bought chicken and there would always be lentils, vegetables and rice. Who could ask for more?

 We all realised that our favourite south Indian haunts back home in Calcutta, however inviting, only featured a small part of southern cuisine. All that has changed with the opening, just over a year ago, of Tamarind at 64, Sarat Bose (Lansdowne) Road, where, with dedication and enthusiasm, they take you on a voyage of discovery of the different gharanas of south Indian cuisine: Hyderabadi, Andhra, Chettinad, Malabar and Coorg mainly, though it is never possible to classify too strictly.

 Going through the menu makes for some absorbing, serious reading. They have struck a fine balance between the vegetarian and non-vegetarian riches that southern cuisine has to offer, and the choice is extensive. After my first visit there, having experienced the wide range of flavours ? some familiar, some intriguingly new ? from mellow and subtle to robust and invigorating ? I went back for an educational session, full of curiosity. 

 I was shown small bowls full of spices, some of which I had not seen before, typical of Chettinad cuisine, such as kalpasi (a kind of dried flower), Marathi mugh (a kind of small fruit), a very thin cinnamon bark that peels off in rolls to look like a cigar and tastes much more subtle than the cinnamon we know, sukku (a form of dried ginger) and kodampuli (kokum). It was also interesting to know that they use star anise. 

 In fact if you order Mutton or Chicken Chettinad, the gravy is made by heating groundnut oil and first putting in bayleaves, the cinnamon I mentioned, kalpasi, Marathi mugh and star anise. To this is added chopped onions and tomatoes, ginger-garlic paste, chilli, coriander and turmeric powder, crushed black pepper and a separately made paste of roasted chickpeas, grated coconut, aniseed and poppy seeds. 

 Of course, water is used to regulate the consistency and the result is a smooth, well-blended and delicious sauce garnished with that most delightful southern condiment ? the curry leaf.

 Another delicious item is Nandu Varuval, which is dry crab cooked in Chettinad spices, but this a dry item. Fennugreek, aniseed and mustard seeds are set spluttering in oil and to this is added sliced onions ? a blend of chilli, turmeric and coriander powder in water, tomato puree and tamarind juice. The crab is cooked in this mixture and the same paste of roasted chickpeas and grated coconut is added. The dish is cooked over a slow fire till almost dry and is garnished with curry leaves. 

 Vegetarian items to recommend are Bangala Dumpa Veppudu from Andhra which is baby potatoes cooked with red chilli paste, ginger and garlic. This is a starter and a good main course item is Vada More Kozhambu from Tamil Nadu, which is cocktail vadas made with urhad dal cooked in a south Indian style, non-sweet kadhi. My personal preference as an accompaniment to all these items is plain appam, though there are many options including just steamed rice and vegetable pulao.

 Other temptations, under starters, are Dakshini Yera, which is prawns marinated with garlic, red chillies and lemon juice and deep fried, Nandu Vedai ? crab meat patties mixed with southern spices and grilled or deep fried ? and chicken or mutton marinated with coriander and cloves and tossed with curry leaves, Coorg style.

 There are many permutations and combinations possible, but my gut feeling is that while one can mix and match dishes from several of these gharanas, the Hyderabadi stands apart and a visit to Tamarind to sample this cuisine would mean sticking to items Hyderabadi. 

 There is a good choice from classic biryanis and Keema Murgh Pulao to the delicious Haleem (they also do a vegetarian version) and Chicken Korma to the sinful dessert Double Ka Meetha -? bread fried in pure ghee and served in rabri.

 Any excuse for another trip.

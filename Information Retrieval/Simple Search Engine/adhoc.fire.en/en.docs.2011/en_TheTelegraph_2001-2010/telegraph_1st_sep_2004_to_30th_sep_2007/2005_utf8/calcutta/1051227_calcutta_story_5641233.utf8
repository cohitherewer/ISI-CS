 Ponchos and patialas, corsets and kurtis, lime green and lavender mdash; all these and much more dotted the style diary of the year. Shradha Agarwal lists some of the top trends

 The year 2005 witnessed style in an all-new avatar ? the smooth metamorphosis of the I-dont-care-whats-in-fashion attitude into one that truly cares. No more throwing on just another kurti with your favourite pair of blues and no more shunning of filmi fashion influences.

 Calcuttans, in 2005, were perhaps more with-it than ever before, inspired by ramp or screen. This year marked the comeback of volume, starkly contrasting with the earlier obsession with fitted garments and body, says design guru Sabyasachi Mukherjee. Proof in the form of applause for the blouson blouses and voluminous skirts abroad and the wide acceptance of the kalidaar kurta, ghera skirt and poncho back home.

 Presenting the GoodLife pick of the popular trends 05.

 Item numbers

 Ponchos, corsets, embroidered churidaars and skirts ruled as the hottest item numbers of the year. Ponchos that emerged last fall catapulted to new heights this year. Perfect to hide not-so-perfect curves and create an illusory curve or two, ponchos in crepes, chiffons and georgettes ? embellished or otherwise ? were seen everywhere, teamed effectively with denims and then dressed up with earrings and a metallic clutch.

 We also saw the rediscovery and rise of corsets. Suddenly, this Victorian garment, used quintessentially as innerwear, became the rage amongst the party people.

 Designer Sunipa Samadder relates the acceptability of the corset craze to increased fitness awareness in the city. Its a perfect way to show off your toned body and also to lend shape to your tummy, she says. According to Sunipa, the multiple use of this garment, with saris and skirts alike, also helped earn a thumbs up from the crowd.

 Leather, brocade, denim and printed ? corsets were all over, confirms fashion designer Abhishek Dutta. Panelled with zippers or tie-ups, Abhishek gives full marks to Calcuttans for venturing from the stretch version to the proper boned corset. 

 This year saw increased interest in the churidaar too. Heavy embroidery with a dash of sequins, gota or patti, the bottoms have never been this jazzy before. With its plain Jane days over, the churidaar had indeed arrived in full form with ornate detailing and design.

 Skirts continued to reign, on and off the ramp, in various versions, lengths, cuts and layers. The fabrics were varied too, some silk and others linen. Funky detailing, some interesting fringes and cool combos were seen throughout the year. But the year definitely belonged to the boho-chic flared, long skirt, says Sunipa.

 Filmi fever

 I had no clue that Babli outfits would be such a rage, smiles Aki Narula, the man behind the design plan. But rage they sure were, since literally everyone was seen wearing them. Be it a college campus or a high society do, Rani Mukherjees silk fitted kurti with brocade collars and cuffs, paired with the patiala, not to forget that embellished jhola, was sported by all. The Babli brigade even went all out to copy the styling ? those dangling earrings and that hair scrunchy on their wrist!

 Why did this super-success formula work? It clicked because you dont need a perfect body for this ensemble, explains Aki. The flattering cut of the kurti, the sheerness of the salwar and the deep necklines, all added to the oomph quotient.

 Bengal shone too, with Parineeta blouses and saris doing the star turn. The puffed sleeves, the traditional taant saris, draped perfectly, all of it was back in the limelight. The mens wear saw a turn towards smart ethnics too, post- Parineeta. The Saif-Sanjay kurtas went down well because of their contemporary twist, reveals designer Snehasish Bhattacharya.

 Cool cuts

 Those who knew nothing but A-lines and kalis till the other day, were at home with jargon like princess lines or empire cuts. Local tailors, small boutiques and couture studios, everyone everywhere wanted to sport a style line or two. No boxy cuts for Calcuttans anymore, as they stepped out in style.

 The flared trousers and jeans also gave way to straighter pants. Calcutta did wake up to a more structured line of garments, says designer Sayon Mitra. Not only winter wear, this time the city took the structured route to even the summer wardrobe. The fabrics differed as always in the two seasons, but shape-wise, there wasnt too much variation, adds Sayon.

 Tone talk

 Emerald, lime, pista, bottle, florescent or olive? but green it must be. Add a few shades of purple and that pretty much sums up the high fashion colour code this year.

 Though green wasnt on my hot list earlier but right now, I must admit, I have really developed a liking for this hue, smiles Sabyasachi. Maybe it was the overall organic mode that we all are in, be it food or lifestyle? And green being the foliage colour is refreshingly inspiring.

 According to Abhishek, the partiality for purple was the trickle effect of the international colour forecast. Purple was huge all over the world, he says. And the reason why the colour clicked here was the easy adaptability to our colour palette. Cream and beige might be huge globally, but when it comes to the Calcutta market, vibrant colours do the trick, adds Abhishek.

 Even if people werent in the mood to don an entire green top, adding an olive or a lavender accent was an equally done thing. Other than complete garments of these two colours, finishing touches in a tone of green or mauve broke the monotony beautifully, says Sayon.

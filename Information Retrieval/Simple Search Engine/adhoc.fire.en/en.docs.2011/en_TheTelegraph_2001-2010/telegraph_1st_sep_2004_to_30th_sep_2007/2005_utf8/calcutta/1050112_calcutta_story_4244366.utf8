 Celine Dion: Winner all the way

 Not as much as in Bollywood, of course, but music in the form of original soundtrack plays a significant role in Hollywood movies, too. As the Oscar season hots up, the race for best original song and background music is about to begin in earnest.

 Over the years, best song nominees have included some of the most well-known voices from the music industry across the age and genre spectrum ? from Elton John to Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion to Vanessa Williams, U2 to Bon Jovi and Bob Dylan to Eminem.

 The 76th Academy Awards, held in 2004, saw Annie Lennox walk away with the golden statuette for Original Song with Into the west from the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. For company, the song had Belleville rendez-vous from The Triplets of Belleville, A kiss at the end of the rainbow from A Mighty Wind, Scarlet tide from Cold Mountain and You will be my ain true love from Cold Mountain.

 If the ex-Eurythmics vocalist won big last year, the year before it was rapper Eminem who edged out stiff competition from U2?s The hands that built America (Gangs of New York) and Paul Simon?s Father and daughter (The Wild Thornberrys) to emerge on top with Lose yourself from 8 Mile.

 Elton John and Eminem: And the Oscar goes 

to...

Some of the songs nominated or declared winner did 

well commercially, topping the charts and subsequently turning into classics, 

while others have come into the spotlight only for their Oscar connection. Berlin?s 

Take my breath away from the Tom Cruise-starrer Top Gun, Starship?s 

Nothing?s gonna stop us now from Mannequin or the Jennifer 

Warnes and Bill Medley duet (I?ve had) The time of my life from Dirty 

Dancing or even Bryan Adams? (Everything I do) I do it for you from 

Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves are some of the commercially successful examples. 

 However, the Oscars haven?t seen many one-hit-wonders with artistes like Berlin being the exception rather than the norm. These days, soundtrack albums increasingly feature heavyweights and the Oscars have found a song from almost every major artiste, often more than once.

 Gordon Matthew Sumner or the singer better known as Sting, for instance. In the past four editions of the awards, Sting was nominated thrice. In 2000, it was My funny friend and me from The Emperor?s New Groove, while the next year featured Until from Kate amp; Leopold and 2003 featured You will be my ain true love (which he composed but didn?t sing) from Cold Mountain. Unfortunately, the ex-Police frontman didn?t win even once.

 Repeat performers include Canadian rocker Bryan Adams (Everything I do? and Have you ever really loved a woman from Don Juan De Marco), Celine Dion (Because you loved me from Up Close And Personal and My heart will go on from Titanic) and Phil Collins with Two hearts from Buster and You?ll be in my heart from Tarzan. 

 Songs from animated movies have done particularly well at the Academy Awards. Be it Phil Collins? You?ll be in my heart (Tarzan), Vanessa Williams? Colours of the wind (Pocahontas), Elton John?s Can you feel the love tonight (Lion King) or A whole new world (Aladdin), almost each time a song from an animation has been nominated, it has won. 

 Sting: In the hunt

Some other winners in this genre include Beauty 

and the beast (Beauty and the Beast), Under the sea (The 

Little Mermaid) and When you believe (The Prince of Egypt). 

In fact, the 67th and 64th editions saw three songs from Lion King and 

Beauty and the Beast, respectively, compete with each other for the best 

song title.

 Who will take home the golden statuette this year? Frontrunners include Old habits die hard from Alfie by Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart, Josh Groban?s Believe from The Polar Express, Elton John?s Peter?s song from Finding Neverland and Jon Brion?s Strings that tie to you from the soundtrack of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

 We are all ears for January 25 when the nominations are announced.

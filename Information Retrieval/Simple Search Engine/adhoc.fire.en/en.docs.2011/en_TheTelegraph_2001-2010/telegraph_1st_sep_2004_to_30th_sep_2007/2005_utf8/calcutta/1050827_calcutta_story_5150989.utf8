The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spurt in soliciting near cinemas

 - Housewives from districts turn to flesh trade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There is a spurt in prostitution in front of prominent cinemas and bus stands, and this can be quite a nuisance for passersby, particularly women, according to the detective department of Calcutta Police. Over a dozen arrests were made in the past few weeks. 

 The women, mostly housewives, hail from the districts. 

 Plainclothesmen of the anti-immoral trafficking cell of the detective department arrested six such women in front of Roxy cinema in two separate raids, apart from recently busting such rackets from near Purabi and Metro cinema recently. Tracking one such racket, sleuths raided an apartment in 6/3B, Umakanto Sen Lane, in Chitpur, and arrested Premlata Shaw, Shambhunath Shaw and Mani Kumar. 

 ?We have received informal complaints from women, who wait at bus stands near these cinemas, or wait outside for a while before entering the halls. There are people who approach, disturb and make indecent proposals to these women,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department.

 ?Imagine being approached by men with dirty proposals while you wait for your friends to arrive at a cinema hall! Such was my experience when I stood in front of Roxy a few days ago. Ultimately, I had to leave the place,? narrated a woman executive of an automobile dealership company. 

 Calcutta Police arrested over a dozen women near cinema halls in the past month, highlighting a spurt in such a racket.

 The women loiter near booking counters, gates and passageways in front of the cinemas. Their clients are mostly young men, single or in a group. Once the prospective customer is located, advances are made. After some bargaining, a deal is struck. 

 Then, the men buy tickets for their female companion and move into the halls. Sometimes, these women book tickets in advance, mostly in a secluded corner. 

 Rooms are booked in various hotels and private residences surrounding the halls for the discerning customer. The price, apart from the ticket, ranges from Rs 100 to Rs 500.

 When a customer escorts a girl to a hotel room, the price tag jumps. After interrogation of one of the arrested women, the sleuths raided a residence in Chitpur. Three persons were arrested, including the owner of the house. 

 ?There is a sharp rise in this kind of a racket in and around major cinemas. We have conducted a number of raids to bust these rackets. These women, mostly house-wives, hail from the suburbs and other areas. They tell their families they are going out to work. In reality, they hover around halls looking for customers,? said an officer of the detective department?s anti-immoral trafficking cell.

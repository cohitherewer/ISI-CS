The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The pain and pathos 

 There have been grumbles galore from Young Metro readers about the lack of poetry lately. Sorry, there rsquo;s too much to print and too little space. But here goes...

 THE DIARY

 All that you were

 Burning the past with a frown and glare

 Running down your troubles and your cares

 Bleeding the past till it?s all dry now

 Slamming the deadly silence down

 Destroying all that once was

 And all that you were

 They?re trying to fan the flames

 Trying to stop what must be changed

 Selling away your old premonitions

 Along with the pain and derisions

 Purchasing a new way of thinking now

 Bringing the deadly silence down

 Burying all that once was

 And all that you were

 The alchemist forges a new world

 For the once teary-eyed dancing girl

 Trina Dasgupta

 Revisiting Cinderella, 10 years down the line...

 Are the skies 

 too violet these nights? 

 When the blue owl peeps 

 from the tree-trunk blackhole 

 to nibble 

 at the cobwebbed corners 

 of a life lived and left 

 in another galaxy... 

 and you search 

 below the winter palash 

 for the rustle of memories 

 of dimpled cheeks 

 and pimpled noses 

 you used to play with 

 in another universe 

 ...and waiting eyeballs 

 shining in gold rings 

 on your fingers 

 follow the stale moon across the sky... 

 Cinderella, tonight 

 would you cry 

 would you die 

 would you lie would you hide

 the sand grains in your eye 

 with the nubile young bride 

 would you stand by the sunset door 

 waiting for the days to pass by? 

 Cinderella, would you 

 still say ?I do?

 to dreams that aren?t 

 charming any more?

 Butterfly of dreams

 The languor of a lazy afternoon

 Too weak to drift me to sleep 

 The soul is restless 

 In spite of the placid waters 

 It can hear the waves 

 Within the hearts 

 Whispering secrets to the night 

 Shadows melting into each other 

 Disappearing into the darkness 

 Somewhere a purple fox jumps 

 And the moon shoots back to the sky 

 From the well it was trapped in 

 Moonlight maladies, midnight madness 

 Like paint smeared on a canvas 

 Into a blur they call art 

 A broken sandcastle on the beach 

 The rusty swing, now empty 

 And memories of running barefoot 

 Through the fields with those yellow flowers 

 I never knew the name of? 

 Graffiti etched on my heart 

 The tinkle of a thousand wind chimes 

 As if they rang in the hope of the Big Bang 

 Sinking into a whirlpool 

 That ends in a navel 

 Someone shut up these voices in my head 

 Like zombies chanting a voodoo spell 

 Silence this delirium please 

 This centrifugal insomnia 

 My pillow seems to smother me 

 Oh sing me a lullaby to sleep, won?t you?

 My yesterdays are corked 

 Into that bottle of old wine 

 Promise I won?t touch it today 

 I?ll wake up early tomorrow 

 To see the sun that burns the shadows 

 And rules the sky 

 I am patient for the dawn 

 This is just chrysalis? 

 I will fly someday 

 Suheli Goswami,

 Freedom uninterrupted? 

 The white sash slips from my hands? 

 Flying, blown away by the breeze 

 The breeze that was meant for me 

 To liberate me, of guilt, wrong 

 To sing for me a freedom song? 

 My sash trips and falls into a vacuum 

 A void of silence and dense fumes 

 Created by dirty desires of want, 

 need, greed?period?(dot.dot.dot) 

 now trapped in a trance alone? 

 My enchanted beauty gels with the mist

 Thinning as it strays into the unknown?

 A freedom that has lost its meaning, 

 Only to become more demeaning?

 What?s on your mind this week

 Perfect pair

 Two of the most ancient cultures, two of the most populous countries, two of the fastest developing countries, two surging economies, two IT leaders, two future superpowers... two best pals? The tiger and the dragon always strive to differ. One is the biggest democracy, the other the finest-operating communism. The two South Asian giants, India and China, have much in common, yet have strong individual identities. They have so much untapped potential. Both have their own areas of superiority, yet of late, they have acknowledged each other?s strong points. But they are still not the best neighbours. It is too early to predict a new New Delhi-Beijing rail-link or a bus service via Nathula. Still, we hope the two countries take steps towards a more stable and powerful South Asia.

 The scene of the Sabarmati Express accident

Dirty politics

 The Sabarmati Express accident provides a small peek into the dirty Indian political system. While the supporters of Narendra Modi and Laloo Prasad Yadav were engaged in profuse mud-slinging, innocent passengers succumbed to these politicians? collective irresponsibility. During the elections, voters have to choose between the Modis and Laloos because the options are limited. In such a scenario, the validity of Indian democracy comes under the scanner. Redemption may only lie in mass political education and effective judicial activism.

 Being Bengali

 This Nava Varsha was a revelation of sorts for me. I saw people wearing their Bengali identity with pride and I realised that this day is not so much a celebration of the new year as it is a celebration of Bengalihood. I had the perfect Bengali day with a more than perfect Bengali lunch of pulao, kosha mangsho, chingri machher malai curry and cholar dal. Of course, no Bengali celebration is complete without the satisfaction of the (in)famous Bengali sweet tooth and for me it was with aamer chutney, chomchom and the quintessential mishti doi. I enjoyed the meal more zealously than I would have on a normal day. Mamar barir adda, watching the India-Pak match, laughing giddily with my cousins, having lunch together, the outing with ma-baba in the evening now all seem so essential, without which the day seems incomplete. Now the adda is over, the food?s been eaten, the new clothes have been worn and even the match has been lost, but within me is a wonderfully indescribable feeling that I hope you will understand.

 Vivek Oberoi: Doing good

Star power

 People in the public domain have a certain social responsibility. It is heartening to see them support causes like HIV/AIDS awareness, polio vaccination and anti-smoking campaigns. Stars like Vivek Oberoi inspire us to do our bit for people in distress. Sadly, some stars openly indulge in distasteful habits like smoking. The masses who idolise them blindly follow their example and emulate them. It is time our favourite actors stopped being so nonchalant and tried to be role models to those who adore them.

 Fond farewell

 I remember the day I entered school as a nervous child. I spent 13 important years of my life in the school. There are hundreds of incidents and events which happened during this period. Surprisingly, in the past one month I have been at home, instead of forgetting the past I find myself recollecting and reminiscing those precious years which passed in the blink of an eye. The school uniform, badges, teachers, friends, exams, annual prize days, and fests were part of me and my identity. When I think of Zeitgeist (our annual inter-school fest), I seem to remember the minutest details, but will any of it come back? I was sheltered, cocooned and loved. Today I am alone, left with memories and tears. My advice to those in school is to enjoy every moment to the fullest. Before you realise it, the farewell day will come knocking on your door.

 Good relations

 It is good to know that India and Pakistan are having good times with CBMs (confidence building measures). But politicians and the media should not use the abbreviation CBM ? it was used a couple of years ago to denote continental ballistic missile.

 Correction

 The report on Callisto 2005 in Young Metro published on May 17 stated that Debotima Mukherjee won the best instrumentalist award at the fest. However, it was I who won the best instrumentalist award in Indipop as well as western music.

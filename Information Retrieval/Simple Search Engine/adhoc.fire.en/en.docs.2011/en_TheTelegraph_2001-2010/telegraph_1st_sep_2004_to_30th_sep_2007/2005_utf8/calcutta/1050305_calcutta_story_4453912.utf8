The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The chief minister?s ?do it know? mantra is yet to reach the Public Vehicles 

Department office at Beltala. To get a simple work done, such as getting the financier?s 

name deleted from the vehicle registration certificate (hypothecation deletion), 

one has to first approach counter no. 1 on the second floor. He would have to 

bear with the stink and the dirty surroundings. He would be lucky if the counter 

opens before 11.15 am, though a display board says it is supposed to open at 10.30. 

A receipt is issued and he is asked to come after two weeks on a specified day. 

On the second visit, he submits the receipt but is asked to drop in again in the 

evening. Then, a few more rounds to another department on the top floor follow. 

Once the clearance is obtained from this department, it is back to counter no. 

1. If all goes well and the file reaches there, the applicant has to deposit the 

fee at the first floor?s computer section. Now, the file again takes time descending 

from the department on the second floor to that on the first. Ten days after the 

payment, finally, the amended certificate is ready. The applicant, however, has 

an alternative to the umpteen visits ? appoint a tout.

 Betar Jagat, a fortnightly booklet containing a detailed list of programmes 

aired on AIR, Calcutta, and small write-ups on the artistes has been stopped being 

published for quite a few years now. It was a very useful booklet and helped people 

keep track of the various interesting programmes aired. I request the authorities 

to start publishing the booklet once again.

 During a recent visit to Ernakulam and Bangalore I noticed that the basic characteristics 

of the roads and buildings in the shopping areas of the cities are similar to 

that in Canning Street and Old China Bazar Street here. But the main difference 

is that we didn?t find any vehicle parked on the roads there. There were no encroachments 

of pavements by hawkers and vendors either. Our civic body should follow the example 

and implement the rules here strictly.

 A busy feeder road connects Budge Budge Trunk Road at Nangi More and Nangi 

Ferryghat, intersecting the Sealdah-Budge Budge rail line to the north of Nangi 

station. In the past few months, with the real estate boom, the land along this 

road is also developing fast. Inevitably, the importance of the road, known as 

Kasimuddin Road, is increasing. Maheshtala Municipality has given its tacit approval 

to the road being renamed Nangi Station Road. This move is akin to disowning local 

sentiments and forgetting the past. A little thought must be given before renaming 

a public property.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dance, dark to dawn

 RCGC

 The line-up for the big night 

 at Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) figured high on the glamour 

 scale. With Bollywood babe Rashmi Nigam (of Popcorn Khao... 

 fame), item girl Payal Rohatgi and VJ-turned-television 

 hostess Ruby Bhatia hogging the spotlight, it was all happening 

 at the second oldest golfing club in the world. With Munna 

 Maharaj serving it up, and a space theme d?cor in place, 

 RCGC was definitely a site to be seen at. While Rashmi and 

 Payal sizzled to popular remixes, Ruby ensured the night 

 flowed freely, interacting with guests and steering the 

 show. Next it was DJ Akash?s turn to take control of the 

 console as he churned out hip-hop, popular remixes and Punjabi 

 hits.

 Tollygunge Club

 If you had to do some trend-spotting 

 on New Years Eve, the Tolly was a good stakeout point. 

 From winter whites to ponchos, flowing skirt to classic 

 LBD (?little black dress?, for those who don?t know or feign 

 ignorance) ? the fashion factor was really high at the club. 

 DJ Austin ensured that the crowd remained glued to the floor 

 past midnight as he belted out some pop picks, with retro 

 numbers like Summer of 69 and Its 

 my life drawing some of the loudest cheers. The band 

 Moonwind took over after him. Though the crowd began to 

 thin gradually after ?04 slipped into ?05, a lucky draw 

 conducted by the club, with exciting gift hampers and wine 

 bottles as prizes, saw many of the party people flocking 

 back again.

 CC amp;FC

 Sandeep Vyas was very much the 

 star of the show here. From Koi kahe to Summer 

 of ?69, with a Babuji, zara dheere chalo thrown 

 in for variety, the singer in trademark vest and tight jeans 

 had the dance floor packed and the dancers dishing out some 

 fancy footwork in keeping with the midnight mood. It was 

 a non-stop party on the ground, with the DJ picking up the 

 tempo ? and spirits ? with the usual song suspects, like 

 Disco ?82 and Dekh le. The CC amp;FC ground 

 was buzzing with activity as the bonfires spread a little 

 warmth and the adda hotted up. Some of that must 

 have rubbed off on the bevy of beauties in short skirts 

 and sleeveless dresses.

 CSC

 A pair of foreign tourists doing 

 a fancy rope-work on the dance floor, an elderly couple 

 doing an energetic jig to Sean Paul and Shaggy tunes, young 

 girls in mini-skirts and their mothers in saris dancing 

 the night away? Vignettes of a night well spent at Calcutta 

 Swimming Club on New Year?s Eve. It was very much a family 

 affair, and though the party was a little slow to start 

 with ? the dancing did not begin till 10 pm despite much 

 prompting by DJ Jam from Hyderabad ? there was no lack of 

 enthusiastic fun. Finally, it was time for singer Nitin 

 Bali to take the stage. Starting from 11 pm, the Baliwood 

 man rocked ?em all, with his own Chhoo kar mere man ko 

 remix to groove tune humdum suniyo re.

 Space Circle

 The setting was some distance 

 from the city centre, but the mood was rocking. At the new-age 

 club off VIP Road, the party was a hit. With Mumbai-based 

 DJ Ruskin at the console and Delhi-based band Silk Route 

 on stage, the crowd had more than its share of fun. Dressed 

 in their December 31 best ? dominated by blacks and reds 

 ? club members and their guests were all geared up for a 

 night to remember. If DJ Ruskin?s Hindi tunes and remixes 

 helped flood the dance floor, the entry of Silk Route with 

 Jadugar from their album Boondein stopped 

 the awe-struck audience in its tracks. 

 DI

 An auction of Sourav Ganguly?s 

 gloves and Leander Paes? racquet was the highlight at this 

 Ballygunge address. The star sports gear went under the 

 hammer just after the calendar turned, managing to raise 

 Rs 70,000 (Rs 40,000 for the Team India skipper and Rs 30,000 

 for the Davis Cup hero) for tsunami relief. While Arun Lal 

 rushed Sourav?s autographed gloves from Eden Gardens after 

 nets, Leander?s parents, though holidaying in Goa, sent 

 across the racquet within half-an-hour of learning about 

 the auction idea. Cause aside, there was quite a lot of 

 serious partying at DI. The sound of Hip Pocket, featuring 

 singers Koel and Rajiv, kept people on the dance floor as 

 festivities carried on till 4 am.

 Calcutta Club

 New Year?s Eve was a low-key affair 

 at this grand ol? address, with Shiva playing to an almost 

 empty dance floor. But one look at the F amp;B corner and 

 one realised where all the action was. The Grilled Fish 

 and Reshmi Kebab figured high on the pop palate stakes.

 Saturday Club

 The revellers at the Wood Street 

 address were in for a surprise when the two exotic dancers 

 from Ukraine kick-started the evening. ?The members were 

 thinking their patience would be tested with a long wait 

 ahead. But we decided to start off with our trump card,? 

 said DJ Feroze. The routine with the candles was too hot 

 to handle. The visual treat over, it was time for the audio 

 blast. With Wired, a local four-man band, rolling out some 

 high voltage rock ?? roll, the night came alive. But excitement 

 peaked only after the Bollywood bugle blew post-midnight 

 with DJ Feroze belting out current Hindi chartbusters.

 Students set on court route, thaw on campus 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Anticipating expulsion from the university, one had already moved the high court, while another accepted his role in the September 2003 agitation. 

 The remaining three, along with their legal counsel, are now planning their final move in court.

 With this, the students? agitation at Jadavpur University has come to a close. 

 ?The examinations are over and no classes will be held for a while, so we have decided to stall our movement,? said Fetsu general secretary Amit Chakraborty.

 ?Three of the students who were suspended, Sudipta Sarkar, Satadal Chakraborty and Arun Kumar Majumdar, will move court. Fetsu will support them in this move. That will be the tone of the agitation,? he added.

 Earlier, suspended student Samrat Roychoudhury had taken his case to court. 

 ?I have been told that special arrangements will be made so that I can take the examinations,? said Arnab Roychoudhury, who had surrendered before the authorities.

 Meanwhile, the university authorities also indicated that the impass? that had rocked the Jadavpur and Salt Lake campuses since April 12 was finally over. 

 ?It is being considered to hold the semester examinations once again for the final-year students on May 28 and 30. The decision will be finalised in the coming week,? said Manoj Mitra, dean of the faculty of engineering and technology.

 Representatives of Fetsu have submitted a memorandum to dean Mitra and controller of examinations P.K. Sengupta, demanding announcement of the examination dates at the earliest.

 ?We are happy with the decision. However, there should be a proper gap between the date of announcement and that of commencement of the examinations,? a Fetsu representative said. 

 ?Also, it should be ensured that the semester examinations are not slated on dates clashing with other competitive examinations for admission to various postgraduate engineering courses,? the students? representative added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Before the civic elections, Trinamul Congress supporters had suspended their 

party flag, measuring around 10 ft, from a string parallel to the highest point 

of the Gariahat flyover. Many months have passed since then and the flag, now 

soiled, is still in place. From a distance the flag looks like our Tricolour. 

The Trinamul workers should keep in mind that since the party flag resembles the 

national flag, care should be taken to remove it post-election campaigns even 

if they give two hoots for visual pollution. 

 Joyeeta Ganguly, Jodhpur Park. 

 Water accumulates in the Woodburn Park Road and Lee Road areas. Even after 

a light shower, the entire drainage system of these areas gets clogged. Garbage 

vats (three on both roads), construction sites and roadside shops also dot the 

area and give it a congested look. The accumulated water takes a long time to 

drain out. Don?t the people in these areas pay taxes to the government and the 

Corporation? It is high time that the authorities revamp the drainage system in 

these areas. 

 Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Commuters face a lot of trouble at Behala Chowrasta. Autorickshaws parked on 

the western flank of Diamond Harbour Road, leading to Biren Roy Road (West), are 

a nuisance. Policemen are seldom seen at the junction despite regular traffic 

snarls. At times, the local residents step out and manage traffic on the roads.

 Prod has cops in Puja flap

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Forty-eight hours before submitting its report to the high court on steps being taken to ensure that its directive regarding Durga puja is being adhered to, police on Wednesday went on the defensive, trying to shield some organisers.

 In its defence, the cop brass claimed, its excuse to the court would be that smaller roads and bylanes could be given a concession, since traffic movement during the Puja days was mostly confined to the arterial roads.

 In its compliance report, police would add that during the festival, most revellers chose to park their vehicles at a distance from a pandal and walk down to it.

 However, this was not to suggest that the organisers could get away by refusing to abide by the court stricture, said police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 He claimed that there was no specific threat during the Pujas, and even if there was anything to worry about, police would ?silently? tackle the problem.

 ?We want people to enjoy the Pujas in the best of spirits,? added Mukherjee.

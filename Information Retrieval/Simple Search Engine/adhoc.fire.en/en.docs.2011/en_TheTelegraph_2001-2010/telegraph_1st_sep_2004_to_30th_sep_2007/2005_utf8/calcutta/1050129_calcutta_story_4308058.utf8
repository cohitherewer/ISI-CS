 Salon front for sleaze racket

 A STAFF REPORTER

 When a man walks into a beauty salon and asks for a facial, he might actually be dropping a well-known coded signal for sleaze.

 After Sapna Modak ? a police officer?s estranged wife ? was caught running a sex racket at her Camac Street salon on Thursday night, police have collected clues about what really goes on in ?around 30 per cent? of the city?s 800 beauty parlours.

 After interrogating 17 suspects on Friday, sleuths have learnt that the modus operandi of such operations has drastically changed over the years, and once again, the cell phone is in the spotlight.

 In the past, explained police, a client would walk into a parlour chewing pan masala or gutka. That used to be the first sign that he was looking for more than just beauty treatment.

 Now, most requests are put through over the phone and large numbers of regular customers do the rounds of the illicit circuit.

 The first signal is a request for a facial, according to police. If a client agrees, the parlour attendant gives him some privacy, usually by drawing a plastic curtain around his chair. 

 While the session is in progress, he is asked if he is interested in a massage. Another positive would lead to the final offer, for which he would be charged anything between Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500.

 Sex rackets shrouded by salon fronts are a trend that started in the mid-90s, in the Tollygunge and Behala areas. They have since spread across the city.

 ?Now you can see parlours advertising quite openly, calling for young, attractive female employees,? said an officer of the Immoral Trafficking wing, which is putting together a list of suspect beauty parlours.

 ?A crackdown will be initiated as soon as possible,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department). Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (South) echoed the threat.

 There have been sporadic raids on shady outfits in the past, but this will be the first organised operation.

 The police hope to stop not only the illicit businesses, but also will try to catch the clients red-handed.

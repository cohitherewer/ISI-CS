 Mocktail masti to beat the heat

 Plan a Party

 A summer cooler bash 

 can be a good way to celebrate the spirit of the season, says 

 Himika Chaudhuri

 Do

 Opt for an air-conditioned 

 room with the view of a terrace garden. You can also 

 hire a lounge if the crowd is large enough

 Base the mocktails on refreshing seasonal fruits, 

 like litchi, watermelon or tender coconut

 Organise some interesting games to keep the guests 

 busy 

 Dont

 Try your hand at 

 exotic concoctions

 Be dressed in formals

 A poolside party, a wet and wild 

 bash, a rain dance ? some common suggestions for celebrating 

 the spirit of summer. But what if you are not a water baby 

 and would like to find other ways to cool off in the heat? 

 A summer coolers mocktail 

 party could be a good way to get into the mood of the season, 

 says event manager Gurpreet Sethi, who specialises in organising 

 womens and childrens parties.

 Diving into a glass full of virgin 

 Pina Colada or the desi cooler Cola Sikhanji while 

 catching up on spicy gossip could well be a cool way to 

 spend a summer afternoon. 

 Venue and decor

 On a summer noon, the best place 

 for a mocktail do would ideally be a chilly, glass-walled 

 room on a roof-top garden overlooking the cityscape. While 

 the greens around will act as a cool tool, the sunshine 

 rushing into the room will brighten up the mood.

 We also recommend the poolside 

 as a favoured haunt for a mocktail party. If the women are 

 adventurous, they can even be in their sarongs and swim 

 wear and relax by the pool while sipping glasses of coolers, 

 adds event manager Sonu Arora, also a womens party 

 organiser. 

 A resto-bar or a lounge booked 

 for the afternoon can also be the venue for a mocktail party 

 if there are at least 150 guests for the do. 

 The d?cor has to be happy 

 and vibrant, feels event manager Riya Mitra. So, doing 

 up the place with drapes in soft colours like pink, blue 

 and pista (the usual mocktail colours) could ring 

 in a dreamy and feminine effect. A funky style with 

 the walls done up with loads of balloons, masks and large 

 cut-outs of fruits is also an option, adds Gurpreet. 

 Beverage bests

 The exotic mixes with lavish names 

 that one sips at city bars and restaurants might not be 

 easy to whip up. So, for a home party it is mandatory to 

 pick some easy recipes. 

 The best bases for home-made 

 mocktails are watermelon juice and tender coconut water 

 (daab), feels celebrity bartender Irffan. Watermelon 

 juice, spiced up with some masala and lemon juice is an 

 interesting combination. Variations of iced tea are 

 also an option, adds Irffan. You can make some black 

 tea boiled with ginger (a cooling agent) and add lemon juice, 

 sugar syrup and garam masala to it. Cool it, and 

 dress it up with mint leaves and serve it chilled. 

 Smoothies with banana, honey and 

 yogurt as the base, topped with fresh fruits make for low-calorie 

 cool drinks. One can get cucumber juice and add it 

 to the usual Soda Sikhanji for better taste and cooling 

 effect, adds the cocktail expert. 

 For munchies, oil-dripping fries 

 are a strict no-no during summer, so roasted and grilled 

 vegetables, chicken or fish should be better bets. 

 Feminine funk

 Going feminine is mandatory 

 at a mocktail party where the dress code need not be formal 

 at all. Bright hues and floral prints should be the look, 

 feels designer Chhuti. Thus, bright colours and flowy comfortable 

 fabrics should be the order of the party. 

 Pinks, yellows and oranges could 

 rule the range of ponchos and kaftans that are a must if 

 you want to flaunt a mini skirt. For those in flowing 

 skirts, summery tops have to be well fitted with smart cuts, 

 she observes. 

 Being an afternoon gig, flats 

 in the footwear section and large colourful bags could complete 

 the look. 

 Games galore

 Some games in between the 

 drinking and munching sessions would do well to inject some 

 action into the relaxed do, says Riya, who recommends 

 a mix of the usual tambola and innovations like a mocktail 

 fancy dress contest. 

 You can ask the guests to 

 dress up in the colours of a mocktail of their choice and 

 carry a pitcher of the same with them, she suggests.

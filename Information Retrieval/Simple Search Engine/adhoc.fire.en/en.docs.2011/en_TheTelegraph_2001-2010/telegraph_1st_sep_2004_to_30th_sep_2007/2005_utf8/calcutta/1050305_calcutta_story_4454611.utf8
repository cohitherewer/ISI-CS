The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Nod for wider feeder road

 - Uplift by July for approach to Chitpur rail terminal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Friday finalised the project of widening and improving Canal East Road, which will service the upcoming Chitpur railway terminal.

 The 2.7-km-stretch, from BT Road to Maniktala Main Road, will be widened to 10 metres and paved with mastic asphalt. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has already sanctioned Rs 11.7 crore for the purpose.

 The project was finalised at a meeting on Friday morning, chaired by transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and attended by HRBC and transport department officials, engineers and deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Sharma.

 Chowdhury said the work would commence next week. ?We plan to complete the work before July, by when the monsoon usually sets in,? he added. 

 Transport engineers said the road will be a ?major relief? to the congested BT Road, Raja Dinendra Street, Shyambazar five-point crossing and the Chitpur area. It will serve as a feeder for all north-bound vehicles entering the Chitpur terminus. As Chitpur will not be an end terminal, dispersal of traffic from there has to be fast, officials pointed out.

 Though initially plans were drawn to concretise the road and its pavements, the transport department decided to settle for a bitumen surface, topped with mastic asphalt, keeping in mind the water pipelines running beneath the road surface. Tantia Construction will carry out the work.

 Once widened, the road connecting BT Road with the EM Bypass can be used by traffic from Gariahat and AJC Bose flyovers to proceed towards Lake Town and Dum Dum. ?Traffic bound for Dakshineswar and Dunlop can use this road to reach the Shyambazar crossing,? said A.K. Das, executive traffic and transportation engineer. 

 ?Also, if south-bound traffic from BT Road and the Shyambazar crossing takes this road, it would help reduce congestion on Raja Dinendra Street and APC Road,? he added.

 ?The CMDA will take up widening of Canal West Road soon. Once commissioned, both roads will be declared one-way ? one leading into the terminus and the other dispersing traffic from it,? another official said.

 Leftover JBIC funds will be used for dereservation of tram tracks and concretising of roads in other parts of the city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

World on a platter

Smita Roy Chowdhury tucks into the 

varied culinary creations at Grain Of Salt

Kitchen Caper

Authentic flavours from around the world ? that?s 

what multi-cuisine restaurant Grain Of Salt set out to offer the Calcutta connoisseur 

when it opened its doors in 2002. Three years down the line, executive chef Debojyoti 

Sarkar laments the lack of knowledge and spirit among Calcuttans when it comes 

to experimenting with varied cuisine. This probably explains why the phrase multi-cuisine 

has almost become synonymous with the cliched combination of Indian and Chinese, 

with a sprinkling of Continental, in most eateries around town.

But not at master chef Sanjeev Kapoor?s flagship restaurant. 

Elaborate sections of Indian, Chinese and Thai are matched by an equally varied 

European spread on the menu, while the hookah bar Shisha even offers food flavours 

from Lebanon. But it?s the banquet menu that gives the kitchen the maximum scope 

for innovation with Burmese, Mongolian, Japanese and Indonesian, in addition to 

the regular Indian, Chinese, Thai and Continental fare.

?The exotic Oriental cuisine is very much in demand 

at private parties, but diners at the restaurant usually stick to Chinese and, 

at best, Thai if they are opting for this category. So we have kept these only 

to the banquet menu,? says Sarkar, adding that Burmese, Mongolian and Indonesian 

cuisine are very similar to Thai since coconut milk forms the base, and the flavour 

of lemon grass is staple. ?So, if people have a taste for Thai food, there?s no 

reason why they won?t like Burmese, Indonesian or Mongolian. But the knowledge 

and the eagerness to try out new kinds of food is lacking,? he laments.

Another Oriental experiment at the restaurant that 

flopped badly is the Japanese hot rock, which had to be closed down after a run 

of a few months. Chef Sarkar mourns: ?It?s very unfortunate that people failed 

to appreciate the concept of a Japanese hot rock, which is such a major hit in 

other Indian cities like Mumbai.?

Surprisingly, the French fare offered by the eatery 

has gone down quite well. In fact, the French Chicken Steak and Lamb Steak are 

among the pop picks on the menu. Demand for the Italian section, though high on 

the Continental list, restricts itself mostly to the pasta and risotto. And even 

in that the authentic flavours are sometimes rejected in favour of alterations 

to suit familiar tastes. ?We were using the authentic Italian Arberio rice for 

our risotto. But people are so used to the Basmati used by most eateries that 

they started complaining,? adds Sarkar.

The 22 Camac Street restaurant is, however, open to 

alterations to suit the guest?s palate, ?provided it?s within our means?. So, 

while spice levels in a dish can be modified on request, certain ingredients that 

are not allowed entry into the kitchen cannot be incorporated (with pork and beef 

topping that list). ?We are a Marwari organisation and serving pork or beef might 

hurt the sentiments of many of our guests,? explains Sarkar.

So, the meat options at Grain Of Salt are limited 

to chicken and mutton, both of which are sourced locally. As are most ingredients 

used in the kitchen. From fish (including lobsters), to vegetables, the local 

market takes care of all the supplies. It?s only some sauces like plum and Hunan 

that are imported from Singapore.

The kitchen has separate divisions for cold cuts, 

tandoor, Indian, Oriental, Continental, bakery and banquets, all of which 

have their own teams supervised by Sarkar.

?Teamwork is the most important ingredient in the 

kitchen,? says the chef. He adds that even the new menu is decided through the 

collective endeavour of the staff. The menu is changed every six months, retaining 

old favourites while replacing the slow-moving items with new ones. After the 

new card is drawn up at the Calcutta end through a menu engineering report, it?s 

finalised with Sanjeev Kapoor?s approval.

A lot of menu engineering also goes into planning 

the content of the lunch buffet, one of the main draws at the eatery. The buffet 

offers a wide selection of 10 vegetarian salads, four non-vegetarian salads, four 

vegetarian main courses, two each of the Indian, Continental and Oriental main 

courses, two rice dishes, one noodles, a few varieties of chaats and 10 

types of desserts. While the number in each category is kept the same, a new menu 

is offered every day maintaining a balance of basic tastes and colours. ?The colour 

combination in a buffet is as important as the flavours. A buffet must look visually 

appealing with a mix of various hues,? concludes Sarkar.

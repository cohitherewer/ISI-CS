 Blood audit to check wastage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With blood banks in the city struggling to cope with a severe shortfall in supply, the health department has introduced an audit in the state-run hospitals to check wastage. 

 A study has found that at least 40 per cent of the blood requisitioned for operations is poured down the drain as surplus. This has worsened the shortage and affected the state coffers.

 To prevent doctors from asking for more blood than is necessary, a special form has been distributed at state-run hospitals. 

 In the form, surgeons will have to mention the number of units of blood requisitioned for an operation and the number of units utilised, stated director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. 

 If the utilisation of blood is less than the amount requisitioned, the doctors will have to explain why.

 ?We have received requisitions for blood from hospitals even for Caesarean deliveries,? said a senior technician of the Medical College Hospital blood bank. 

 At Medical College, he pointed out, dozens of donor card holders have to be turned away, while over 100 units of blood returned by relatives of the patients are poured down the drain every day.

 Unutilised blood, returned either by the relatives of the patients or the doctors, cannot be preserved. It is disposed of to pre-empt infection risks.

 Before being preserved, every unit of blood is put to test for malarial parasite, Hepatitis B and C, HIV and syphilis. Storage cost of a unit of blood (300 ml) is Rs 900. The government charges only Rs 50 for a unit from those with donor card and Rs 500 per unit if there is neither a card nor a donor. 

 Central Blood Bank, at Maniktala, and the Medical College blood bank have been functioning with less than 50 per cent of their average stock strength.

 The central blood bank usually maintains a stock of 3,000 units. At present, it is stocking only 1,000 units. 

 The average daily collection at the Medical College blood bank has come down from 1,600 units to 550 units. 

 ?The outbreak of dengue, the Puja, the weeklong rain and Ramazan have caused the shortage,? explained Kamal Datta of Central Blood Bank. 

 According to him, 44 blood donation camps had been cancelled in the past few months, resulting in a net shortfall of 4,000 units.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rights slap on elite club

 - Denial of full membership to women ruffles PWD feathers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The public works department (PWD) on Friday slapped a notice on Calcutta Club for ?violating women?s rights? and carrying out commercial activity on government land.

 ?The club still denies full membership to women. It is violating women?s rights even while operating from a government plot,? said PWD secretary Kalyani Chowdhury on Friday. The club building is located on 12 cottahs of PWD land at the busy AJC Bose Road-Jawaharlal Nehru intersection.

 According to Chowdhury, when the government sought a clarification on the issue last year, the club, in a written reply, had stated that its selection procedure was ?rigorous?.

 ?We wanted to know what ?a rigorous selection procedure? meant. But the club didn?t respond to that. No other club has such an attitude in this time and age,? the PWD secretary added.

 When contacted by Metro, club president Bhaskar Sen said: ?Let me first see the grievances listed by the PWD. Only then can I comment on the matter.?

 Earlier last year, the PWD had refused permission to the club for expansion of its existing building. The women?s rights issue came to the government?s notice through the 2003?04 winter issue of the club magazine, where it was observed that ?ladies continued to be denied full membership and voting rights?.

 In another segment of the journal, it was noted that ?following the precedence of racial equality asserted at the time of the Club?s inception, wives have now established their gender rights not only by the facility of signing bills, but also ensuring that separate (and prime!) hours are set aside for ladies at the Health Club?.

 PWD secretary Chowdhury said that in May 2005, the department learnt that Ganesh Departmental Store of Burtola Street was selling goods from an outlet on the club premises. Apparently, anybody could buy from the shop in cash or with a credit card, without going through the formalities of providing a membership number or signing a slip.

 The PWD?s notice has asked the club why it was running the store from government land and why the state shouldn?t realise market rent, along with arrears, for the commercial activity.

 ?The club pays a monthly rent of Rs 20,830 for use of the prime government property. We haven?t given permission for any commercial activity there,? said Chowdhury.

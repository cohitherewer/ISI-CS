Zoo to save, not enslave

 The king of the jungle in a cage: The concept of an urban zoo is being contested. A Telegraph picture

 A zoo must act as a rescue-cum-conservation centre and not as an exhibition gallery... Calcutta-based animal welfare NGO People for Animals (PFA), which had challenged the concept of an urban zoo in Calcutta High Court through a public interest litigation (writ application no. 1950) in 1998, has found global voice to its crusade.

 Strategic partner Compassionate Crusaders Trust (CCT) ? the PIL was filed based on its findings and analyses ? was the sole city representative at the biennial animal welfare conference, Asia for Animals, held at Novotel Clarke Quay, Singapore, from June 22 to 24.

 The forum strongly endorsed CCTs focus on the zoo?s role as a conservation centre and lauded its slogan, ?Life imprisonment without any court of appeal?, according to Louis Ng, president and executive director, Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres), principal organiser of the conclave.

 ?Any kind of subjugation of a weaker species leads to apprehension and eventual loss of freedom,? said Debasis Chakrabarti, who did a presentation on ?Rescue centre operation? at the Singapore forum on behalf of CCT.

 The emphasis of Asia for Animals 2005 was on consolidating experience in the region, with an eye to developing new strategies and facilitating change. In the main sessions, representatives of government agencies and NGOs debated topics like ?disaster relief amp; recovery?, ?ZooChek work in Asia?, ?stray animal management?, ?rescue centre operations?, ?tackling illegal wildlife trade??

 Chakrabarti called for a concrete road map for all rescued animals, both short and long-term, ?so that they can fend for themselves once they are returned to the wild, and the zoos have to play a pivotal role here?. 

 Shubhabrata Ghosh, who had inspected over 30 Indian zoos for CCT funded by ZooChek Canada, and was the other representative from the city, underlined the need to stop subjugation in the name of exhibition/performance in zoos and circuses.

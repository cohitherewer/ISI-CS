 The diversity of a multi-cuisine restaurant, the informal appeal of a college canteen and the in-the-moment motto of a coffee shop ? a food court is a melange of all these and much more. Riding on the shopping mall and multiplex boom in the city, food courts are a new addition to Calcutta?s gourmetscape. The trend was kicked off by Burp, the food court at Forum, followed closely by Hangout and Yo Foodies at City Centre and The Metropolis respectively.

 Primarily meant to be hangout zones for shoppers and cine goers, these thrive on the need for snacky bites and sips along with some chill out space. While volume keeps their business ticking, it?s variety that forms the backbone of these multi-cuisine stops. 

 ?Business at food courts totally bank on footfall and so it always makes sense to set up one in a multiplex or shopping mall. A standalone food court won?t be such a lucrative proposition,? says Malay Ghosh Dastidar, manager of Burp. He adds: ?It?s very important for a food court to dish out as many kinds of cuisines as possible. A good assortment of cuisines can cater to people of varied tastes. Also, one doesn?t come to a food court with the pre-conceived idea of enjoying a lavish meal of a particular cuisine, so one must get a wide platter to choose from.?

 Packing in outlets of standalone restaurants is the route taken by the food courts to cater to diverse palate. While Burp has 15 counters set up by restaurants like Ar-Han-Thai, Pizza Hut, Raj Veggie Point, Badshah Quickys and Chatpati, Hangout has roped in nine eateries including Bombay Shiv Sagar, Dakshini, Gourmet Calcutta and Lemon. Yo Foodies, however, has eight outlets of its own dishing out different cuisines. 

 ?A food court should have the resources to serve four different cuisines on a table of four. This is not an easy task considering the heavy flow of guests during peak hours. We have 200 covers and on weekends we get eight times the number. And at a food court everyone expects fast service,? says Manish Pandey, manager F amp;B, Ambuja Hospitality Division.

 While all the food zones serve the routine Chinese, Indian, Tandoori and South Indian fare, there are some exotic cuisines on offer too. Burp, for instance, takes pride in specialising in Arabian and Mexican, along with a huge separate counter dishing out a variety of chaats. Yo Foodies, which is currently hosting an Iranian food festival, also cooks up Bengali and Mexican flavours. It?s fast food, however, that scores highest with visitors at all these stops. Pizzas, burgers and dosas, washed down with mocktails and juices, throw up the pop picks.

 Though both Burp and Hangout have leased out counters to individual restaurants, the food is prepared in the kitchen at the mall. ?None of the eateries supply the food from their standalone restaurant kitchens. To ensure that the food is freshly prepared, we see to it that everything is done in their separate kitchens inside Burp. We have a gas bank on the terrace from which we have given connections to all the kiosks,? says Malay. 

 ?The food counters at Yo Foodies are all run by our staff. We ensure that no two counters serve the same kind of food,? says Vishal Kapoor, spokesperson for Yo Foodies.

 ong with quality, service and ambience, another factor that plays a vital role in the popularity of food courts is the pricing. ?People tend to spend less time and money in a food court. Anyone who wants to splurge on food would go to a speciality restaurant and not a food court and hence the pricing has to be very affordable,? says Manish.

 After the Frog Princess, it?s the Nayar Sisters who take centre stage in designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee?s design drama as the young stylist gets set to recreate his magic at the Lakm? India Fashion Week (LIFW), starting April 20. 

 ?I think an interesting name adds value to a collection. My Frog Princess line aroused a lot of curiosity,? says Sabyasachi, explaining the thought behind the unique name of his forthcoming line.

 ?When I lived in the suburbs, there was a Nayar family staying close by, comprising three sisters and their father. The sisters used to wear a lot of men?s clothes, including their father?s oversized shirts, and since they were all of the same age group, they used to interchange their outfits. ?My line for LIFW is influenced by them in the sense that it?s totally made of interchangeable pieces. It?s a collection of many separates put together,? says ?Sabya?.

 Every garment in this collection, he goes on to explain, has a sister garment, sporting the same look, in a different colour maybe. And these outfits will be presented in groups.

 Sabyasachi?s ?most feminine and glamorous collection till date? flaunts a retro look with a muted palette comprising old English colours. Lots of sequins, Swarovski, applique, old school badges and loads of floral prints embellish the dresses, tops, skirts, jackets and saris.

 ?This is an ultra-feminine collection for people who love dressing up. It?s all about baroque, but in a very mundane manner,? smiles Sabyasachi.

 The line, based on fashion forecasts for spring-summer 2006, is likely to hit the racks at Browns and international fashion week ramps after storming LIFW on April 25.

 If Sabyasachi terms his collection the most glamorous till date, for designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh, it?s her ?most relaxed line ever created? that she?ll showcase at LIFW on April 23.

 The collection, inspired by jazz, draws influences from the decades between 1920s and 1950s ? the era of fashion revolution. 

 The laidback collection flaunts a loungy appeal. Lots of linen, cotton as well as tweeds make the ?languorous, caf? style? clothes.

 ?Rebellion percolated down to the toe nails of the 1920s. With her short hair, turned-down hose and powdered knees, the 20s lady more than just symbolised a revolution in fashion. She was the soul and spirit of the jazz age,? explains Kiran.

 She goes on: ?Though jazz was born in the 1880s, it was most noticed in the 1920s and has survived through the social ups and downs of the later decades. Jazz and fashion co-walked the path of life. As one twisted, the other turned. They were twins of their times. Soulmates in spirit. As fashion changed, jazz evolved. From classical to fusion, country to continent. Jazz was fashionable and fashion was jazzy. This collection is a tribute to these feisty friends.?

 The collection looks at fashion from the 20s through the 50s. Hemlines and waist lines move up and down from low waists to empire lines.

 ?What differentiated jazz from the earlier styles was the widespread use of improvisation, just like fashion suddenly burst forth from the restrictions of the Victorian age. Like jazz music, fashion through these decades meant a new piece that often bore little resemblance to what went before. It was spirited, it was original and it was inspired. This collection bridges the 20s with the 50s and every decade in between,? concludes Kiran.

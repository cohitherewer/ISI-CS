 Cut-off for tech study proposed 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Aspiring engineers and technologists may soon find it difficult to secure a berth in colleges even if they figure on the merit list of joint entrance examinations (JEE). 

 To ensure quality teaching in engineering institutes and good jobs for fresh technology graduates, the government is considering a proposal to make it mandatory for students to score a minimum percentage of marks in Higher Secondary or equivalent examinations to be eligible to study engineering.

 Under the present system, science students can secure admission in both private and government-run engineering colleges if they clear the Higher Secondary or equivalent examinations after figuring on the JEE merit list.

 The proposal to introduce cut-off marks has been put forward by the authorities of a section of private engineering colleges, officials of the state higher education department said.

 Several private engineering colleges claim to have quality infrastructure and teaching staff. Authorities of some of these colleges feel that there is a lack of adequate number of meritorious students. 

 ?We need to have good students to impart quality education. It is the standard of teaching that helps an institution to earn its reputation. We can improve our academic standard substantially if we get adequate number of good students,? said P.K. Ray, director of MCKV Institute of Engineering, a private engineering college in Howrah.

 Officials of the private engineering colleges said most multinational companies are recruiting fresh graduates not just on the basis of their performance in the engineering course, but also on the basis of their performance at the Plus-II level.

 ?Companies like the TCS, CTS and Microsoft have different recruitment rules, but they all prefer students who have scored high marks throughout their career. We must have enough good students in our institutes if we are to make engineering education market-savvy,? Silajit Ghosh, director, Future Institute of Engineering and Management said.

 The government, following a directive of the Medical Council of India, has made it compulsory for students aspiring to study medical courses to score at least 50 per cent marks in physics, chemistry, biology and English in Higher Secondary or equivalent examinations.

 ?We are aware of the proposal of the engineering colleges. This is a sensitive issue and we will be able to take the final decision after discussing the matter with officials,? Samir Bandyopadhyay, registrar, West Bengal University of Technology, to which all private engineering colleges are affiliated.

 He added that there is no scope of introducing the system from the current year.

 Alvida, for now

 Kajol, Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan in the Koffee with Karan finale

 The camera pans in on the shooting floor enveloped in semi-darkness. As the light comes on, the host in white introduces the guests in black ? ?Padmabhushan Amitabh Bachchan and Padmashree Shah Rukh Khan, the two most powerful men in the Hindi film fraternity?. 

 It?s only fitting that the dynamite duo features in the finale of what has emerged as the power chat on Bollywood. Koffee with Karan, a Friday night fixture on STAR World, is set to take a break. And it is bowing out in style. 

 ?It feels great to have done a show which became a talking point in conversations,? says Ravina Kohli, director of the show. ?But we had to stop as we have completed 26 episodes, as planned.? Of the 26, the Abhishek Bachchan-Preity Zinta episode generated the highest TRPs, she adds.

 A sneak preview of the season-end 90-minute special reveals a much-restrained Karan Johar. No quips or innuendos or verbal caught-you-there. Holding forth, after all, is Amitabh Bachchan, ?also called God in the industry?. Yet he remains endearingly human in his humility. ?I never thought I would be a leading man? I would have been happy with passing roles,? he says, seated between the twin stars of GeneratioNext. Even after ample interviews and a couple of biographical tomes, there is more to know about the man who has spent three decades and more in filmdom. 

 Walking down memory lane of initial rejections, he tells the two of ?something very strange? that happened in the late 60s ? the control on projects a leading man could have. How many of us know that it was the six-film embargo that forced Jeetendra out of a film called Pyar Ki Kahaani and paved Bachchan?s path to greater things than the bit roles he was doing in Saat Hindustaani and Reshma Aur Shera?

 Shah Rukh, too, reveals his start-up 

 troubles ? Divya Bharti?s silent grimace or Juhi Chawla?s 

 voluble ?eek? on meeting a hero with ?hair all wrong? for 

 his initial projects like Deewana or Raju Ban 

 Gaya Gentleman.

 Three other guests join the conversation ? Kajol, Jaya Bachchan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. An entire section is dedicated to praising Black beauty.

 ?We have done the rapid fire round differently. Karan leaves the judging to a panel of Bhansali, Farah Khan and Farhan Akhtar,? Kohli points out. And why not? The winner?s coffee hamper is a lot heavier.

 The channel promises to return with its ?most-talked about production with a new mix of celebrities,? according to Ajay Vidyasagar, senior vice-president, marketing.

 Meanwhile, Karan is lounging in the US, working on his next film, Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna, and preparing for his birthday bash. It will soon be time to disco.

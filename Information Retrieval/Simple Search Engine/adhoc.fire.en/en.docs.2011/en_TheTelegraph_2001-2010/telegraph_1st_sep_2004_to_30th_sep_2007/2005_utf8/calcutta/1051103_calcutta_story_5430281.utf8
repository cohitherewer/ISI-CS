 With a bouquet of 47 foreign films from 32 countries, the 11th Calcutta Film Festival is ready to roll from November 10. The eight-day gala at Nandan will train the spotlight on present-day film-makers with a generous sprinkling of classics.

 ?We have stressed on contemporary films this time. So, almost all the films are made between 2004 and 2005,? announced chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, flanked by festival chairman Soumitra Chatterjee and festival director Ansu Sur, on Wednesday.

 The inaugural evening, to be attended by information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy and film-maker Mrinal Sen, will screen Christophe Barrister?s The Chorus, a French-Swiss-German production. Koel Mullick and Sayantani Ghosh will be the thali girls.

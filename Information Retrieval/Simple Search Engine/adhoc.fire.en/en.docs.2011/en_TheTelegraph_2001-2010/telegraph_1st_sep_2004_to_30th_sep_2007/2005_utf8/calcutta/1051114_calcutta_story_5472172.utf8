 Mosquito calendar to check diseases

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is working on a mosquito calendar for all wards of the city. 

 Vector control officer of the CMC Debasish Biswas said the civic health supervisors have been directed to submit the index values of different parameters, vis-?-vis the larvae density of three major types of mosquitoes ? Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus ? found in Calcutta.

 While Anopheles stephensi spreads malaria, Aedes aegypti is responsible for transmitting dengue and Culex quinquefasciatus is the potential vector of filariasis. 

 ?To control mosquito-borne diseases in the city, one needs information about the quickly changing dynamics of the vectors, hence, the mosquito calendar. It will be of major help in reducing the incidence of diseases and monitoring vector control activities,? Biswas explained.

 ?It is quite problematic to measure the adult mosquito index due to vastly changed behavioural pattern following large-scale use of DDT in the late 50s and early 60s. So we have decided to measure the density of larvae in the structured format,? added the vector control officer.

 The data will be generated monthly and stored at the central vector control office in Moulali. The first set of reports is expected in mid-December.

 The major indices to be studied include house index (percentage of positive households), container index (percentage of positive containers) and the Breteau index (number of positive containers per hundred households).

 World Bank malaria expert Supratik Bose, who visited the city a couple of months ago, stressed on vector control for controlling diseases like malaria or dengue.

 ?This is a very important project and the CMC should have initiated it earlier,? opined A.K. Hati, entomologist and former director of School of Tropical Medicine (STM). He urged the CMC to make use of similar date compiled by the STM a few years ago.

 According to CMC sources, Environment Governed Integrated Organisation, an NGO, had developed a malaria-control model called ?micro area malaria control strategy? a couple of years back, where the emphasis was on study of the mosquito larvae. The project, which was lauded by experts, is set to enter the implementation phase.

 Marc of a model

 You can take a model out of modelling but you cannot take modelling out of a model. You can say that again! smiles former supermodel Marc Robinson.

 But now, I have slipped into the role of an event director and fashion choreographer. I make shows happen and teach the models to put their best foot forward,

 Saturday was a Bada Din for Marc as he was in town to choreograph the Indian Leather Associations trade show in Taj Bengal.

 From stills to cinema (Anjan Dutts debut where Marc starred opposite Tara Deshpande and shared screen space with Shabana Azmi), ramp to road shows, the 36-year-old has been there, done that.

 Along with Milind Soman, Marc did more than his bit to change how youngsters looked at modelling as a career option.

 Modelling then was non-existent in India. And there were hardly any male models. Not that the scene has changed drastically for male models now, but modelling has become a career... though a short-lived one to some extent. With Milind and me, things somehow clicked. Hence began a journey of ramp shows and advertisement campaigns, recalls Marc.

 The mans popular appeal peaked after he starred in the path-breaking Kamasutra ad campaign with Pooja Bedi in the mid-Nineties. It raised a few eyebrows, his fees and his fan following.

 But courting controversy is something Marc has learnt to live with, and with a wry smile. From careless whispers about Preity Zinta to kissing VJ Sophiya Haque in front of thousands at an award function... Intentionally or unintentionally, I am in the news, shrugs Marc.

 Then came a stint with the big screen that did not quite proceed to plan. I guess I took the decision of getting into movies 10 years before it should have happened. Thus, I did not get my kind of roles and I could not work in the typical boy-meets-girl genre that was in vogue at that time. But some of the movies being made currently are very interesting and I see myself fitting into some of these roles, he admits.

 Then came a crossroad at which he turned his back on modelling and acting to head for something more meaningful. That meant Marc J Robinson, his own company.

 I had walked the ramp for more than 12 years and I could do it for another 12 years. But nothing would come out of it but stagnation... I was in the greenroom with the models for this show and was thanking my stars that I no longer have to go through the motions of rehearsing the entire day, applying heavy make-up, learn my steps and change my clothes swiftly between sequences, says Marc.

 Every day now is a new day. Spotting a good talent, co-ordinating the show and putting it together is so much fun. I am enjoying this phase now.

 Ramp or no ramp, The Body is still just right. When we had our kid, all my evenings were spent with the family. I could not follow my fitness regime and put on 11 kg. But six months of running and I was back in shape.

 Though not too happy with the band of boys in modelling, he is hot on the girl gang. His face for the future: Deepika Padukone.

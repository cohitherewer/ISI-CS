The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scanner trained on sleaze salons

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Police are gearing up to launch raids within a week or two on sleaze rackets operating from beauty parlours, hotels and other establishments.

 ?We are chalking out an elaborate plan for the raids, which will stretch across the city,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department-I). ?Our request to those running the rackets: stop before we raid your premises.?

 Elaborating on his department?s line of thinking, Singh said: ?If a young couple wants to spend time together, we have no problem. But having sex in exchange of money is something we won?t tolerate.?

 An officer of the detective department?s immoral trafficking wing said several beauty parlours and centres for herbal treatment, body massage and physiotherapy are being used for running sleaze rackets. ?We have come to know what really goes on in around 30 per cent of the city?s 800 parlours.? 

 In January, the estranged wife of a police officer was caught running a sex racket at her Camac Street salon. 

 A doctor and a businessman, along with six young girls, were arrested from a massage centre in Tollygunge on February 23. 

 Again in February, a doctor was arrested in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, for running a sex racket at his chamber.

 The modus operandi of the sleaze business has changed drastically, another officer said. ?Now, you can see people advertising openly in all leading newspapers. The words in the advertisements indicate they will provide something more than just beauty treatment.?

 The officers have been asked to follow advertisements published in the weekend editions of all newspapers. ?We will keep a close watch on all beauty treatment centres being publicised. Once we are sure of catching offenders red-handed, we will carry out raids,? said another officer working on the case.

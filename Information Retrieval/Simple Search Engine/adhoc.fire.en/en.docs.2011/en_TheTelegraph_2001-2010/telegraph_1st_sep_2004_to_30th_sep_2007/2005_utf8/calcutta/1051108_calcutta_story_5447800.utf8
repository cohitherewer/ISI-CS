 Jewel thieves at the shops

 - Post-Diwali stock update throws up list of missing items 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dhanteras last week was a mixed bag for two prominent city jewellers. Higher footfall did keep the cash registers ringing, but thieves made off with some of the moolah. 

 While decking up the shop for Dhanteras, the employees of a reputed ornament showroom on 22, Camac Street, found that some small jewellery items were missing. On inquiry, they found that no one had seen the pieces for weeks.

 Most of the missing jewellery was tiny and came as attachments with larger pieces. They were on display in the shop?s showcases.

 A subsequent search failed to unearth not only the displayed items but also connectors and studs kept in boxes stored in the shop?s cupboards.

 The employees went through the inventory to discover that close to 175 gm of gold, valued at Rs 1.25 lakh, was unaccounted for. 

 The shop-owner immediately informed the police. 

 ?We found out that Rajesh Sharma, one of the staff members, had been removing tiny gold items for months, knowing very well that no one would bother to find out more about their disappearance. He was a hard nut to crack, but after prolonged interrogation, we succeeded in making him confess,? said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 

 Sharma, in his early 20s, used to hand over the stolen items to a receiver in Burrabazar, who paid him in cash, said the cops. 

 He did this for several weeks, without the shop emplyees realising it, the investigators added.

 Sharma had earlier worked in a jewellery shop in Jaipur and knew a great deal about the business. After moving to the city in December 2005, he had landed the job at the Camac Street shop through his brother-in-law?s contacts. 

 While the cops managed to crack the case fairly quickly, they are clueless about the theft at another jewellery shop on Camac Street. 

 A stock update after the Diwali break had revealed that a pair of diamond earring, worth about Rs 40 lakh, was missing from the shop. 

 The salespersons later concluded that a couple had stepped out with the earrings without paying for them. 

 According to the staff, the cash memo for the set had been forwarded to the payment counter. 

 The two were standing in the queue to pay for the earrings, but left quietly later. The security personnel did not search them.

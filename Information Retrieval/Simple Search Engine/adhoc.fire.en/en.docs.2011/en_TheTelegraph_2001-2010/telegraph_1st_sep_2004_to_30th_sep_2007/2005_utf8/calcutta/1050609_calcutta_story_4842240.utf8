The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green buses to hit streets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 New Bharat Stage (BS) II buses will ply on various routes in the city and suburbs in a couple of months. The vehicles will be run by private operators under overall supervision of the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC), a transport department subsidiary. 

 ?We are preparing a panel of private operators who will be issued permits to run the buses,? said WBSTC managing director Asit Mondal.

 ?The routes are being finalised keeping in mind the demand of the people and business viability. We expect the buses to hit the streets within two months,?? he added.

 The conditions laid down by the corporation specify that operators must possess BS II vehicles, have experience in running public transport, bear the cost of operation and upkeep and pay statutory fees.

 ?On our part, we will allow the operators to use our terminals, workshops and booking counters. Administrative help, too, will be provided to them. The operators, in return, will have to pay a monthly fee, which will be finalised after assessing the returns from each route,? Mondal told Metro.

 The corporation?s decision flies in the face of the recommendations of Consulting Engineering Services (CES), engaged by the state government to suggest ways to restructure public transport bodies by downsizing their staff and reducing the area of operation.

 The CES has suggested that the WBSTC need not ply buses ? the corporation now runs some long-distance vehicles, including the Calcutta-Dhaka bus ? and should focus entirely on water transport.

 Asked about the rationale behind the move, a corporation official said: ?The WBSTC is the only transport body in the state that makes a profit and does not take subsidy. We have reached the position after putting in a lot of effort. Now, why should we restrict our operations when there are enough avenues to expand?? 

 Managing director Mondal explained that the corporation was embarking on the venture as it would bring in profits without too much investment or liabilities. 

 ?We had earlier engaged private operators to ply long-distance buses. The venture was successful. We hope to repeat the model,? he said.

 As of now, the Calcutta State Transport Corporation plies buses in the city and the South Bengal State Transport Corporation operates in the neighbouring districts. ?Unlike those corporations, we do not have any jurisdiction limitation. We can operate vehicles anywhere in the state,?? said a WBSTC official.

 It takes a tonga to travel and earn

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Almost the entire village has gathered to see the progress of three men and a tonga in a blazing West Midnapore afternoon. For, most of the local residents have never before seen a horse or a tonga. 

 The trio in the tonga ? Sanan Mullick, Md Azamuddin Sheikh and Narayan Pal ? has had similar receptions on the 380-odd-km journey.

 When Dr Shantanu Bhattacharjee of the NGO Bengal Rural Welfare Service (BRWS) rode in Mullick?s tonga in Deogarh, Jharkhand, ?it occurred to me that we could use it to promote eco-tourism and employment in Amlashol and Kankrajhore. So, we decided to buy tongas from Deogarh and give them to poor and handicapped people in Amlashol and Kankrajhore,? he explained.

 The first one to receive the gift was Lal Madhab Soren, a tuberculosis victim who lost a lung to the disease, in Amlashol. Although a vet of sorts, Soren has never seen a horse, is often afraid of going near the big animal for fear of being bitten and doesn?t understand the neighing. 

 Deogarh tongawallas Mullick and Sheikh were deployed to drive the vehicle to Amlashol, with BRWS employee Narayan Pal accompanying them on the week-long journey. 

 Travelling through Purulia and West Midnapore, they sometimes covered 30 km a day, sometimes 100, depending on the road conditions, weather and Lalu the horse?s health.

 It was an experience to remember. ?There were crowds all around us, people asking us where we were from, what we were doing, where we were going, what the tonga was? They were all so curious and excited,? recalled a bemused Mullick on Friday, in Calcutta to meet tongawallas.

 Villagers often poked and prodded at the contraption to check its authenticity. Cows and raging bulls ran away from the horse, stray dogs circled the animal and howled and barked in apprehension and wonder.

 In Kashipur, the three men camped out in front of the rajbari, while Lalu stopped right in front of the police chowki in Adra and wouldn?t move. The officers were amused at their story and told the trio to rest there for the night.

 ?These villages are often in the middle of nowhere, with no communication or connection to the outside world,? said Pal. ?The word has spread. People from neighbouring areas, including Jharkhand, are asking me about the tonga. They want one in their villages, too.?

 BRWS has provided training to tongawallas in Amlashol and Kankrajhore, and will support the maintenance. Two more tongas will be donated soon. 

 ?We hope the tongas will become a means of transport and sustenance for them,? added Bhattacharjee.

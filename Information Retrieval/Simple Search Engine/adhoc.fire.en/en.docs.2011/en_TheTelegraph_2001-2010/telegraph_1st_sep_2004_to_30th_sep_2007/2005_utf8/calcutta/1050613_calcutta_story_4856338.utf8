 Swarovski: crystal class calling

 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Crystal ware, say interior designers, is not in fashion any longer. But walking into the exclusive Swarovski outlet in Forum forces one to wilfully ignore design dictates and blow up savings to acquire the exquisite crystal collection ranging from showpieces to jewellery, watches and even tiaras.

 Born two years ago, this crystal destination ? the only Swarovski outlet in eastern India ? is the perfect place to window shop and treat your eyes to some fantastic creations. 

 From wallet-watchers to the eminently extravagant, there is something to tempt buyers on all kinds of budgets.

 The classy d?cor of the store adds to the shopping experience, with a red-and-black colour scheme on the walls and black leather sofas on a raised dais for guests lending an ambience of luxury. Swarovski lights on the ceiling that look like a clutter of stars are a final winning touch.

 Gift galore

 Tiny crystal pieces for your loved ones in various themes promise to be a gift for life. The love struck can pick a bunch of crystal roses or one single flower in a crystal tub. There are gifts for specific occasions like fare-wells that include a crystal yacht, a train engine and even an aeroplane. Little puppies, teddies and unicorns are hot favourites. 

 Accessories

 The jewellery range includes earrings, bracelets, pendant sets, chokers and even tiaras in various designs and sizes. Crystal-studded watches or those with crystal dials are available at the higher end. Cheaper accessories include key chains and cell phone danglers.

 For a dazzling touch of utility around the home, pick up flower vases, coasters and napkin holders. 

 Showpieces

 From air to underwater, butterflies and birds, fish to fantasy creatures, the crystal miniatures cover it all. 

 The current hot pick is the Disney collection that has just been launched this month. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Daisy Duck figurines would be any fans dream possessions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ill throw lots of coins 

 once Mr Bachchan appears on screen

 ABHISHEK BACHCHAN tells Pratim D. 

 Gupta about his GOD, his Rani, and the mindblowing experience 

 of shooting for Bunty Aur Babli

 Abhishek Bachchan and 

 Rani Mukherjee do a Veeru and Jai in Bunty Aur Babli. 

 Serious is one word that is not associated with 

 the film at all, says Abhishek

What was it like sharing screen 

 space with your father for the first time?

 Mr Bachchan is GOD. He is simply 

 awesome. He is like a rock star in the film. I think, he 

 is back with a bang. It is a privilege working with him. 

 Especially for me, since I have been watching his films, 

 loving his films since childhood? It?s mind blowing. 

 Did it help to have your father 

 in the same frame or did it mean added pressure?

 When you have Mr Bachchan and 

 Rani as your co-stars, then there is absolutely no pressure 

 on you. When you have such brilliant co-stars then your 

 performance also improves a lot. Throughout the film I was 

 behaving like a son asking my father to help me out with 

 scenes (laughs). 

 I think Mr Bachchan steals the 

 show in this film. Shaad (Ali) and I are going to go and 

 watch the first day first show and throw a lot of coins 

 on screen once Mr Bachchan appears. I have not been so excited 

 about watching a film in a theatre for a long, long time. 

 This is the fourth time you 

 are coming together on screen with Rani Mukherjee. How has 

 she evolved as an actress from the days of Bas Itna Sa 

 Khwaab Hai? How has the chemistry grown between the 

 two of you? 

 Rani is an absolute terror on 

 the sets (laughs). Jokes aside, Rani is one actor 

 that I am absolutely comfortable with. She understands me 

 as an actor, anticipates my reaction on screen and handles 

 the scene well. Our timing is also very good. I think it 

 is our comfort levels in front of the camera as co-actors 

 that is termed as ?chemistry? on the screen. 

 Actually it was a big family on 

 the sets ? Shaad, dad, Rani and I were all very close and 

 that can be seen on the screen. 

 Shaad is another childhood 

 friend you are working with, after Rohan Sippy and Goldie 

 Behl. What was it like?

 Shaad was an even bigger terror 

 than Rani if that is actually possible. The entire unit 

 was very young. Throughout the film, we had to maintain 

 a high degree or high tempo? Bunty Aur Babli exhibits 

 that high level of energy on screen, all the time. With 

 Shaad and Rani around, that got much easier. So, serious 

 is one word that is not associated with the film at all 

 ? only fun.

 How was it shooting in Calcutta 

 for Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal? 

 Rituda is a family friend? 

 I have shot for two films in the city ? Yuva and 

 Antarmahal. Shooting in Calcutta was an absolute 

 delight. 

 Dhoom, Bunty Aur 

 Babli, Dhoom 2... is it a conscious switch from 

 the serious action genre to comedy? 

 My character in Dhoom was 

 not really comedy. I also don?t think that my role in B amp;B 

 is comedy driven. In fact, Sarkar, my next release 

 and another film with dad, has a very serious theme. 

 You are performing on stage 

 for the first time ever for the IIFA Awards in Amsterdam 

 in June... 

 Well? it means lots and lots of 

 hard work. Also, continuous practice and more practice?

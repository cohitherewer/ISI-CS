 Woman in realtor murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Meena Nayak, wife of a Baguiati-based gangster, was arrested on Sunday for the murder of Pranab Deb, a realtor and brother of former CPM legislator of Mograhat Anuradha Deb.

 ?Meena conveyed her husband Rajesh?s instruction to Deb?s assassins,? claimed an investigating officer. 

 Rajesh was arrested a couple of months ago on charges of extortion. He is lodged in Dum Dum jail.

 North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said: ?Meena took charge of her husband?s gang some time ago. She appointed the killers and provided them with shelter after the murder.?

 Kumar added: ?Rajesh?s gang had almost dissolved after his arrest. The gang members were stealing machinery parts from shutdown factories on Deb?s instructions.? 

 The gang members ?identified as Gadai, Babu, Surojit, Manoj Shaw and Guddu ? had recently shifted allegiance to Meena, angering Deb.

 ?Rajesh realised that Deb had become powerful in the Baguiati area, a territory he once controlled. Through his wife, he tried to extort money from Deb, but failed,? stated the investigating officer.

 ?The plan to eliminate him was chalked out immediately. Meena engaged Gua Manoj, Kanai, Mamu, Hatkata Nandu and Bachha Raju ? all wanted for murder and extortion ? to execute the killing,? he added.

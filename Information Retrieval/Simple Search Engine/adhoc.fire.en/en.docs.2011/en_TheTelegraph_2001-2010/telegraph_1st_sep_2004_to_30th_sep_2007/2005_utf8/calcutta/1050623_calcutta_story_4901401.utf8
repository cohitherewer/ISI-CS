 Metaphysical musings

 The symbolic concept and its physical embodiment comprise the two counterpoints in art. Across the world, human form has been the traditional focal mode of artistic expression. In India, however, realistic and abstract art have co-existed from time immemorial, perhaps owing to our culture, which is deeply rooted in spirituality. The back-to-back exhibitions of paintings, Kaaya, the form O Maaya, beyond the form, are an exposition of the twin modes of figurative and non-figurative representation in contemporary Indian art. Currently on display are works in the Maaya, beyond the form series, providing art lovers the opportunity to explore the universe with a vision that surmounts the palpable. Featuring works in oil, watercolours, pastels, ink, acrylic on canvas and paper and mixed media, the show is a silent, sophisticated comment on the power of the formless in art. Participating artists include Arindam Chatterjee, Jayanta Roy, Mona Ghosh, Nirban Ash, Rathin Kanji, Tamal Krsna and Tanmoy Biswas (Rhapsody in Blue; picture above). Curator: Ratnottama Sengupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It?s like Alice on the beach

 - CITY-BASED DISC JOCKEY GIVES ANIMATED AVATAR TO 80S HIT

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 SWEET AND INNOCENT: The heroine of the video

 Remember Kumar Gaurav and Vijeta Pandit running around trees singing Yeh Zameen Ga Rahi Hai in the 80s? blockbuster Love Story? The song is making a comeback in a remixed avatar, courtesy city-based disc jockey, DJ Lloyd.

 But more than the song ? featuring vocals by local lass Bithi ? it?s the video that is set to create a stir. ?This is the first 100 per cent animated Hindi music video,? says Lloyd, the Mumbai-based table-turner who moved to Calcutta a few years ago.

 The video starts off with a bored and depressed ?young girl of today? looking for something interesting to do. 

 ?She spots a sea shell and as she puts it to her ear, instead of the usual sound of the waves, a song starts playing,? explains Lloyd. Through the music, she enters a fantasy beach with dolphins and seagulls. ?It?s like Alice on the beach,? Lloyd laughs.

 Compare that to the skin show put on by every new remixed video and it?s clear why the DJ chose to do without live actors. ?The finished song sounded so sweet and innocent that I couldn?t visualise any person doing it. And the animation turned out to be great as well,? says the music consultant of B.E.D (Bars Entertainment and Dining).

 The remixed track is a part of a Yash Raj Music compilation album that features top DJs in the country such as DJ Aqeel and DJ Kiran, besides Lloyd.

 The five-minute music video has been conceptualised and produced in Calcutta. ?The final touches are being applied right now and the video should be ready for airing by November 7,? says Rabindra Banthia of Citytech Corporation, the animation company working on the project.

 The cost of the 45-day production is ?around Rs 5 lakh?. ?We have used standard 2D animation tools but the quality is of international standard,? Banthia offers.

 Prior to this, Bengali band Chandrabindoo had experimented with an animated video for its song Juju.

 After the animated experience, Lloyd is a little loath to return to live actors. ?I?ve decided that in future, all my videos will be animated.?

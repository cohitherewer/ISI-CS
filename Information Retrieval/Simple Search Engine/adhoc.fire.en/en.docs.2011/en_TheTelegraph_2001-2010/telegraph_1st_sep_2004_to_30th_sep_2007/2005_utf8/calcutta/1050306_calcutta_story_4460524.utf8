Fridays will never be the same again on Park Street. 

That tall claim comes from the skipper?s lair, no less.

For Prince of Cal, the lounge bar-cum-nightclub at 

Sourav?s on Park Street, has just stepped out of convention cease with a concept 

called Lifestyle Calcutta.

?While you are spending money on food and beverages, 

the only recreation in a nightclub is music. But there are so many who never make 

it to the dance floor as very few nightclubs in Calcutta spare a thought for the 

bigger picture,? starts off Kanishka Mazumdar of Sourav?s. 

Enter, Lifestyle Calcutta to plug the gap in the field.

?Lifestyle has never been bigger. We just want to 

expose people to the latest in the circuit,? explains Kanishka. 

So, Fridays at Prince of Cal will come alive with 

a variety of activities. Every month, the focus will be on one lifestyle-related 

concept. From fashion apparels to funky accessories, from sports equipment to 

business accessories, every lifestyle item would be given due attention.

For starters, the entire month of March will witness 

a fashion fiesta. Dressed in the creations of budding designers, models will walk 

down the aisles every Friday. The first in a series of such fashion shows took 

place on March 4, with the models displaying both ethnic and western wear. Ornate 

saris and embroidered salwar kameez ruled the makeshift ramp. Designers 

under the spotlight included Chandrani Singh Flora, Jayeeta Mukherjee and Naina 

Jain.

After fashion, food. So, TS Eliot?s cruellest month 

will find Sourav?s dishing out a wide variety of food for the soul. Chefs from 

all over Calcutta would display cuisine through next month, till a new lifestyle 

theme takes over in May.

Salsa swing

The Starstruck Retro Lounge is the new hub of action, 

or so it would seem if one were to track the weekend revelry roster of the club.

After sizzler Katrina Kaif formally opened the long-awaited 

lounge in Forum last month, the place has already hosted some starry events including 

a high-profile party for a host of Mumbai models, and performances by the talented 

saxophonist Tamara. This weekend saw a couple of young Salsa dancers ? Calcutta 

bred, if you please ? who put up an interesting performance as part of the soft 

launch of Rigo, the latest bottled drink from the house of Bacardi.

The white drink that is lemony in taste has almost 

double the alcohol content of Breezer but is far milder than a peg of the common 

kind. 

Though a larger launch is in the party pipeline, the 

evening at the new retro lounge was enough to make a mark on the city?s fun circuit.

Sipping on the newest entrant at the bar, Calcutta?s 

party makers tuned into a host of retro numbers before DJ Sumedh made the slight 

exception of playing hip-hop to pump up the volume and get the party going. 

Fusion flair

The mercury is creeping up and the silks are giving 

way to the chiffons and cottons. With summer steaming in, a wardrobe makeover 

is a must. The leather jackets and pashmina shawls you flaunted at parties till 

not so long ago are headed for the locker and stylish ponchos and smart skirts 

are all set to take over. 

The styles and trends of this summer as predicted 

by some of the best-known designers from across the country were showcased through 

a fashion show held at Espee boutique, the house of fashion that gave Sabyasachi 

Mukherjee his first break and is hard at work providing a platform for young designers 

of the city. 

?The colour palette this season is muted and we are 

moving away from the really bright pinks and yellows,? says Purnima Chawla of 

the shades of the season across all collections ? from the young label Couturewala 

to the acclaimed creations of Rohit Bal.

The show had some of Calcutta?s best-known ramp rulers 

sashaying across the store donning Sabyasachi?s flavour of the season ? chiffon-sleeved 

corduroy kurtas ? to saris with in-house labels.

?We have some excellent ponchos and kaftan-style tops 

from Ranna as well as skirts from Sunita Shankar. Varun Bahl has also sent us 

a classic collection of western formals,? says Sangita of the fusion and western 

offerings at the Rawdon Street store.

Though sequin-worked saris are slowly slipping out 

of the fashion scene, the trend is still pretty mixed with a lot of heavy saris 

flaunting zari, stone and sequin work. 

A special sari with kalamkari work created 

by Mayura with a plain base and heavy pallu promises to attract the subtle 

dresser. 

?In keeping with the festive feel, we have introduced 

a discount on our in-house label,? says Purnima, all set to see the summer stock 

moving.

Starbust

It was touted as the night you could rub shoulders 

with the party people. The ?Catch the Page 3 Live night on the Red Carpet? at 

Virgose, HHI, was supposed to witness a dazzling do engaging Tollywood toppers. 

Actresses June, Indrani Halder, Chaiti Ghoshal and Pallavi Chatterjee were some 

of the invitees for the night.

The party kicked off at 9 pm and witnessed a decent 

turnout. But Chaiti Ghosal was the solitary Tollywood flag-bearer. ?We want to 

make Virgose a happening place for parties. People in the city who love to party 

should make Virgose their ultimate destination,? announced a spokesperson for 

the hotel.

And what does the place have to offer to the party 

people? ?Good food, abundant alcohol and good music have always been the ingredients 

of a happening party. And, we do have all three,? insisted the spokesperson.

There is a missing link, though: a designated dance 

floor.

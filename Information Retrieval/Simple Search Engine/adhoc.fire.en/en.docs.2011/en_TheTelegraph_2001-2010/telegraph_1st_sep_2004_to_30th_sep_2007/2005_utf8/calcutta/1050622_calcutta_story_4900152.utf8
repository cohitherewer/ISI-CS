 Katie Holmes at a photocall for Batman Begins in Rome

 Born Kate Noelle Holmes on December 18, 1978, in Toledo, Ohio, the all-American girl shot to fame by the time she was 20. Holmes went from relative unknown to, as indicated by a 1999 Teen People ranking, one of the ?21 Hottest Stars Under 21?. Although it was a national model and talent convention that first got her noticed ? it landed her a trip to Los Angeles when she was 16 ? and it was there that Holmes auditioned for a role In Ang Lee?s movie The Ice Storm.

 Acting was in her blood. Holmes first appeared in high-school productions, and finally made her name as Joey Potter on the television programme Dawson?s Creek. She has entered the big league as Tom Cruise?s girlfriend, but is now also making a name for herself as Rachel Dawes in the film Batman Begins. 

 In the film, she plays the tough-as-nails lawyer in the district attorney?s office, battling crime in Gotham City. She?s the love interest of Bruce Wayne, alias Batman. But even off-screen, she claims to have been quite taken by her sexy co-star Christian Bale. In fact, she went weak in the knees when she got to ride in the famous Batmobile with him dressed as the superhero.

 ?It was so exciting to be cast in this movie. I?ve been a fan of (director) Chris Nolan?s. And, I read the script and I loved the story,? she gushes. ?When I read the role of Rachel, I was really impressed with her. I love her sense of integrity. And she?s such a fighter. She?s so strong-willed and, she really sticks to her beliefs. And, I like that.?

 With a father and a sister who are lawyers, it wasn?t a stretch to portray her character, says the girl whose favourite actor is another Tom, Hanks. 

 But it?s, of course, Cruise who?s the centre of attention. ?You know, I?m so happy right now. And, I?ve never been happier. I?m so in love. It?s great. I love Tom.? Having dealt with media attention since the age of 17, Holmes says she has no problems with coping.

 Working on Batman Begins was ?another great project to work on?, adds the 26-year-old, who wore a Ritu Beri outfit for the premiere of the film. 

 ?And I?ve learned so much. It was wonderful working with Chris. He?s such a professional. And, he always had such a clear vision of the movie that he wanted to make. And so, that makes all of our jobs much easier. And yet, he?s also a great collaborator, so, I learned a great deal from him. And I had so much fun making this movie. I mean, we had the Batmobile, and we had Gotham City. And I was, like, in London, in Chicago. I mean, I had a great summer.?

 As for Christian Bale, apart from his good looks: ?I?ve been a fan of his work for so long. And it was such a pleasure working with him. He?s such a professional and such a dedicated actor.?

 A two-day seminar, a panel discussion and an international award ceremony. The spotlight is set to swing on sports in the next few days, with events centred around three distinguished sport scholars visiting the city.

 J.A. Mangan, executive editor of International Journal of the History of Sport, John MacAloon, professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, and Brian Stoddart, pro vice-chancellor (research) of the University of La Trobe, will speak on good governance in sports, felicitate Jagmohan Dalmiya for his contribution to world sport and participate in a seminar on studying games at Calcutta University (CU).

 Mangan has edited the International Journal of the History of Sport since its birth. On its 25th anniversary, the journal is honouring legendary FIFA president Sepp Blatter, former International Olympic Committee chief Juan Antonio Samaranch and former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Jagmohan Dalmiya with achievement awards. The felicitation of Dalmiya, credited with changing the power equations in the cricketing world, takes place in the city on July 16.

 MacAloon is also a historian of the Olympic Games and the International Olympic Committee, while Stoddart is considered to be an authority on aspects of sports culture. The three academicians have penned several books on sports.

 The trio will kick off its Calcutta trip with a panel discussion on good governance at the American Center on July 14. The next two days will find them at Studying Games: Cultures, Politics, Media, Commerce, a seminar co-organised by CU?s Sports Studies Centre.

 The evening of July 15 is reserved for a discussion on 22 Yards to Freedom, authored by Boria Majumdar, and cricket. 

 ?This is the first time that three such towering figures would be present together in the city,? said Majumdar, who is an associate fellow of the CU centre and deputy executive editor of the International Journal of the History of Sport. ?It will also be a boost for the discipline of sports here,? he added. The final event on the trio?s list is the award ceremony on July 16 at a city hotel.

 Reel revolution, behind the screen

 - Technology tie-up at theatres replaces print with microchip to curb piracy, cut costs

 RESHMI SENGUPTA

 The perforated print is out, the microchip is in. A reel revolution is sweeping single-screen theatres, behind the screen.

 Several halls are replacing film prints with a digital set-up that is anti-piracy, cost-effective and guarantees better screening quality. The technology trickled into town last month, starting with Paradise and Roxy.

 ?It benefits all those involved. The producer saves on the print cost and also gets fast returns as the system allows a film to be released simultaneously in various halls. Most importantly, it curbs piracy. The print carriage is not involved and so there is no scope for copying,? says Arun Mehra, owner of Paradise and Roxy.

 The digital set-up introduces a new member in the producer-distributor-exhibitor chain ? the service provider, sitting in Mumbai, who procures a copy of the film from the producer and beams it via satellite to the halls.

 ?We have developed a software by which we can capture a film in the digital format, store it in a server, upload it to the satellite and beam it to the halls,? says Usman Faiyaz of United Film Organiser (UFO). ?We provide the halls equipment for free but charge an installation fee of Rs 25,000 and a refundable deposit of Rs 2 lakh.?

 Around 128 theatres across India have opted for the technology till date, with 65 being from Bengal. ?By this system, you save on the print-buying cost (Rs 60,000-70,000) and print-carrying cost (around Rs 15,000 per week). It is particularly helpful for films that don?t run for more than a week or so. Besides, the system ensures better picture clarity and sharpness of sound,? says Arijit Dutta, owner of Priya, which will soon switch to the new system.

 Above all, the digital format ?can curb 90 per cent of piracy?, a big threat to the industry. Copying from the print of a new release and flooding the market can now be virtually eliminated. The hi-tech move has, however, sparked a controversy ? some say, orchestrated ? among a section in the local film industry. ?The beaming is in violation of the West Bengal Cinematograph (Regulation) Act,? alleges the Bengal Motion Picture Employees? Union.

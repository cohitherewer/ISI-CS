 The Cha Bar at Oxford Bookstore on Wednesday was the venue for the launch of Moments of Magic, a cookbook with recipes from 43 countries. The focus of the book is on the vitality of food through minimum cooking using traditional recipes adapted for maximum nutrition.

 The book comprises healthy and appetising recipes from countries across the globe. It connects readers instantly to the ?goodness of earth? and brings them into the global food web. Bina Ramesh Naik, a medical practitioner specialising in paediatrics, has compiled the recipes from countries like China, Tibet, Japan, Korea and Poland.

 The Oxford event was the second in a series called Karmasutra ? mind, body and spirit. Karmasutra shuns central authority and encourages a network of various groups working towards world peace and universal love.

 The first leg of the three-part programme dealt with Buddhism and spirituality, while the second focused on the basis of body beautiful: healthy eating.

 ?The body is like a shrine and it must be kept healthy. People worldwide are realising the importance of healthy food and the book gives access to hundreds of healthy recipes,? said chef Shaun Kenworthy.

 Rack range

 Stori, a national brand in men?s wear, that set up shop in City Centre a few months ago has stocked up a cool summer collection.

 Specialising in semi-formal and casual skirts and trousers, one can hope to pick up a wide range in pure cottons from this outlet.

 Right from the smart office shades of blues and creams to crazy printed patterns just right for the weekend, the array of uppers is impressive.

 ?We have just introduced a new range for the party people of the city which promises to jazz up the late evenings,? says Manoj Kumar B of Stori.

 Woven from a yarn that has satin weaves along with the cotton to add a dash of radiance, the new satin evening range comes in seven colours, from ivory to choco brown to black. ?These pieces have been treated with a wrinkle-free process,? explains Manoj.

 For the lower half, the wrinkle-free pure cotton pieces are in various styles. Prices start at Rs 1,000.

 Bridal touch

 Now, Varda Goenka of Diagold brand fame, has drawn inspiration from the look of the Raj and created jewellery that is decidedly traditional in look. Titled Bride and Prejudice, the range finds her working with coloured stones, precious and semi-precious, to create heavy pieces perfectly suitable for formal occasions.

 ?This line is definitely different from the lines we have designed so far, but keeping the marriage season in mind, we expect this line to do well,? says Varda.

 An exhibition of the jewellery will take place at three Diagold outlets of Lee Road, City Centre and Metro Plaza, from April 26 to May 7, by rotation. Along with the new collection, the eternal wedding favourites jadau and navratna will also be showcased.

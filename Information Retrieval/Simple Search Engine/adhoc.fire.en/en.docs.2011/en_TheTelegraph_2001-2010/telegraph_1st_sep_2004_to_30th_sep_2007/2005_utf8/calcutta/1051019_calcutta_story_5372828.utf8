The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Big buzz from Bollywood

Four screens with a flurry of firsts, coming to town 

this Diwali. Pratim D. Gupta takes a virtual tour of what south Calcutta 

cine-goers can expect from the maiden Fame multiplex

If you have lived the movie at Elgin Road, Swabhumi 

and Salt Lake, now fasten your seatbelts for a filmi ride at Hiland Park. 

Fame (Hiland Park), the city?s fourth multiplex, is set to open its doors on October 

28, just in time to bring in the biggest of Diwali blockbusters, with add-ons 

sure to change more than a few movie-watching manners.

?We are here to fill the gap,? says Shravan Shroff, 

managing director of Shringar Cinemas, in town to supervise the final touches 

to the four-screen multiplex off the southern tip of the EM Bypass.

?We may have lost the first-mover advantage but that 

has, in turn, helped us to learn the gaps that exist and try to do away with them. 

We have done detailed research and surveys before entering the Calcutta market.?

And what are these gaps? ?Well, people in Calcutta 

are not happy with the food on offer at the plexes,? reveals Shravan. ?We are 

getting local street food like phuchka and chowmein to our Hiland Park 

property apart from the standard samosa and popcorn. This roadside flavour 

prepared in hygienic fashion would certainly help give our patrons something more 

than what they are used to.?

Then come the ticket prices. ?I think Calcutta pays 

a lot more to watch movies,? feels Shravan. ?There are some in this city who are 

ready to pay more for extra comfort but there is also a price-conservative section. 

Keeping that in mind we will decide on the ticket pricing which should definitely 

be lesser than our competition (read INOX and 89 Cinemas).?

With reduced ticket prices come added leg space. The 

last rows of all the four screens will have a leg-room of 28 inches as opposed 

to the usual 21 inches. So, 76 of the 897 seats will be Royal Class sofa chairs 

which come at a 15-20 per cent premium. Also, the row-to-row spacing is more ? 

1,120 mm as opposed to the usual 1,000 mm. 

What?s more, there?s nothing unofficial about the 

cosy corner. Special couples? seats called Romeo amp; Juliet chairs will help 

the lovestruck get up close and personal at a safe distance from prying eyes.

?It?s even ok if they don?t watch the movie,? laughs 

Shravan. ?We would love to reach out to the younsters in every possible way. And 

word-of-mouth publicity really works amongst collegians. We will even get ushers 

to welcome the Juliets with a rose!?

Apart from those lucky college-goers, Fame (Hiland 

Park) is looking at the residential catchment comprising Hiland Park, Udayan and 

all the other apartments till the fringes of Jadavpur and the Santoshpur connector. 

?Ninety per cent of our patrons should be from this area and the rest will be 

from the periphery,? feels Shravan. ?We are not expecting people from Salt Lake 

coming down to watch movies here.?

What Shringar Cinemas does expect is an immediate 

buzz as soon as the Fame experience hits Calcutta. So everything from free home 

delivery of tickets (anywhere in the city proper) to Internet and SMS booking 

will start from Day One. 

?For the Net booking, we are having a dynamic and 

live ticket search engine,? says Shravan. ?You will get to choose your tickets 

from the entire grid, which is not the case with other multiplex chains. They 

usually give you a row to choose from. We are tying up with a call centre for 

these support services.?

Using the mall to the fullest is also something that 

the Fame people are taking into account. ?We are going for discounting tie-ups 

with all the local retailers. So, maybe you can buy something at a shop and get 

a discount coupon on the popcorn. And in the same way, you can watch a movie with 

us and get a discount coupon redeemable at one of the retailers,? Shravan explains.

As for the movies, Shringar Cinemas aided with its 

distributing chain will exhibit all kinds of films ? Bollywood, Hollywood, Tollywood 

and even, from down south. ?As with multiplex culture, we will have seven to eight 

movies to choose from and the focus will be on Bollywood, of course,? Shravan 

says. ?Quantum did a qualitative research for us and the results showed that Hindi 

films are most popular with the people here.?

There will be movie premieres aplenty, something which 

Fame has become synonymous with in its Mumbai properties at Andheri, Malad and 

Kandivali. ?We will also have the Bus To Bollywood contest here,? says Shravan, 

having got a great response to the same in the Fame property at Nasik. ?The contest 

winners will fly down to Mumbai and stay there for a couple of days, where they 

will get to interact with all their favourite stars and tour Bollywood.?

While the proposed properties at Rashbehari Avenue 

and Prince Anwar Shah Road haven?t yet been acquired by Shringar Cinemas, they 

sure have big plans for the region. 

?Not just in Calcutta, we are looking at other towns 

in Bengal,? Shravan reveals. ?Our target is the elite group that still travels 

to single-screen theatres. With the best facilities that we have ? Christie?s 

projecters, Dolby digital sound and imported seats ? we hope we can woo the viewers.?

As for the launch of Fame (Hiland Park), it may not 

be a big dhamaka straightaway. ?We may go for a soft launch and then get 

stars down in the following week, that is Diwali,? Shravan signs off.

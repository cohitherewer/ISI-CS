 Woman returns money found in taxi

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A woman employed in a private company on RN Mukherjee Road handed over Rs 70,000 that she found in a taxi to the police on Thursday evening.

 Sashwati Mitra found a bag containing the notes in the taxi she had boarded around 8 pm for her Kasba Connector residence. She asked the driver to take her to Hare Street police station after he told her that the previous passenger had got off on Amherst Street.

 Police later found out that Prasanta Dutta, a bank officer, had left behind the money in the vehicle around 1.30 pm on Thursday. ?We are waiting for the driver to turn up to identify the owner,? said officer-in-charge Premabrata Majumder.

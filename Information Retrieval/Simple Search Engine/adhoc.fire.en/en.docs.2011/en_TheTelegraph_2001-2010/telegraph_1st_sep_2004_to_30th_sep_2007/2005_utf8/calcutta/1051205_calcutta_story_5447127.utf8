The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Big bucks from circus open tender

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A 45-day lease of the Park Circus Maidan to a circus group this year will earn the civic body Rs 12 lakh. A lease for the same duration last year had fetched just Rs 1.8 lakh.

 The reason for the huge hike in revenue rake-in is the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)?s decision to go in for open tenders to lease out the grounds to circus groups.

 The bid for the Park Circus Maidan was won by Ripon Street-based Ajanta Circus. The second-highest bidder quoted only Rs 4.51 lakh.

 The civic body?s move, however, has not been welcomed by the Opposition ? comprising the Trinamul Congress, Congress and the BJP. 

 Their grouse stems from the CMC?s tendency to earn money from a sick industry like the circus.

 ?A charge of Rs 12 lakh ? that, too, for using a part of the grounds ? for 45 days means a rate of over Rs 26,000 a day. We have no objection if the CMC fixes this as the minimum rate for organising any function at the venue,? leader of the Opposition Javed Ahmed Khan said.

 A. Rajan, member of Indian Circus Forum, said he had met mayoral council member (information and culture) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan with a prayer for help for the survival of circus, a traditional mode of entertainment. 

 He had pointed out to Faiyaz Khan that the governments of Orissa and Gujarat had slashed the tax on the circus industry to a great extent. 

 In Gujarat, the charge for holding a show is Rs 200 a day and in Orissa, a group has to pay Rs 100 for an acre a day.

 Asked about Rajan?s grievance, Khan told Metro: ?I told him we are ready to consider a proposal to help the circus industry by waiving the charge for CMC land and the amusement fee on tickets. But not a single proposal has come from either Indian Circus Forum or any individual group.?

 For Ajanta Circus, this will be its second show (kicking off on December 15) on the Park Circus Maidan, after 2002.

 ?We will present three new items this year and the most thrilling will be the one in which motorcycles speed down a wire,? said Vicky Raju, owner of the circus.

 Television serials and other forms of electronic entertainment, coupled with the enforcement of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1970, have taken away much of the attraction of circus. ?To offset the loss, we are trying to rope in gymnasts and trapeze players from various countries. The days are not far when you will enjoy a sample Sumo wrestling or archery as part of the circus show,? said Raju.

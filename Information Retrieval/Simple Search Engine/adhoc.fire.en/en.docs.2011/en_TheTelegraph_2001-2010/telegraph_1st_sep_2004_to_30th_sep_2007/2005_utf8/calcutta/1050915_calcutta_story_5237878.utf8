The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court suit against JEE pattern shift

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) board?s plans to change the question pattern from 2006 has suffered a jolt, with students moving the high court against the decision.

 The students claimed they had not been given sufficient time to prepare for the examination. They filed a petition earlier in the week, seeking an injunction against the JEE board. The first hearing is expected in a few days. 

 Metro had earlier reported that several students and their guardians were opposed to the introduction of the new format of multiple-choice questions and were contemplating legal action.

 About 70,000 students, of whom at least 30,000 are from Calcutta, appear for the JEE every year. For most of them, the decision to discontinue with essay-type questions came as a bolt from the blue, more so because the Higher Secondary examination pattern has not undergone any significant change since 1978. 

 In the petition, the students said they must be given enough time to prepare for the entrance examination. Their counsel, Allauddin Mondol, stated: ?Most students and guardians are peeved at the manner in which the board went in for a change. My clients have decided to seek justice in court.? 

 Under the new pattern, students are supposed to choose the correct answer from four options. So far, only essay-type questions have been asked in the entrance exam.

 ?The JEE board did not consider a lot of factors, including the serious inconveniences caused to students. Even meritorious students might fail to adjust if the new system is introduced in a hurry,? counsel Mondol added.

 A JEE board spokesman said it was determined to go ahead with the new system as it would help the students to appear for other competitive examinations.

 As reported in Metro, the book of model questions and answers brought out by the JEE authorities has also irked the students. The book was found to be full of mistakes.

 With months to go for the exam, the book is the only means by which students can find out about the new question pattern. 

 The board has sought expert opinion on the book.

 A revised edition will take some time to be published, according to board officials.

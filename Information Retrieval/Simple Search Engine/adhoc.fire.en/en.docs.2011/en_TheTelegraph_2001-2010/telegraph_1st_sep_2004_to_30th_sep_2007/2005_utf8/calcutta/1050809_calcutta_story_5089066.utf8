 Bring home nature nuggets

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Pictures or paintings connected with nature like landscape, flowers and orchards that suggest growth, abundance and fruitfulness, act as enhancers of prosperity. These should be used to decorate the walls of the south-east sector of the house as this area is associated with good luck and material wealth. The walls of this area should always be painted in soft shades of green

Q: My late grandmothers photograph hangs on a wall of our drawing room and greets the eye as soon as one enters the house. We all loved her a lot and this is our way of showing respect. Does Feng shui approve of this placement? Secondly, our guest room is located in the south-east sector of the house. What kind of pictures should we hang there and what colour scheme is best suited for this area?

 Chandana S.

 The Solution: Since you love and respect your grandmother so much, you are absolutely right in placing her photograph at a focal point of the house. Otherwise, according to Feng Shui the east sector is associated with elders and this is the area where gratitude to them is expressed.

 The south-east sector of the house is associated with blessings and good luck where energy manifests itself in the form of material wealth. This part of the house should always be painted in soft shades of green, which symbolises tree energy that suggests growth. Pictures or paintings connected with nature like landscapes, flowers and orchards that suggest growth, abundance and fruitfulness act as enhancers of prosperity.

 Work woes

 Q: I am a software engineer from NIIT (DOB 25.11.1973, 11.30 pm). I have started mail order and data conversion jobs from my home. In spite of hard work and sincerity I am not getting my due. Please suggest ways that will help me get new projects and also recommend auspicious directions and colours that will help me do well in my field. 

 Boom

 The Solution: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a strong wood person and are being nourished by three elements of water. These being prominent in your chart, you have started outsourcing related business. This year is definitely stressful for you because metal is in power. Metal brings stress to a wood person. 

 Next year you are moving into fire and earth period, which means further expansion in business and financial gains. You have a very bright future from 2009 onwards, where you enter into pure money period. That should be the booming period of your life. 

 East is your most auspicious direction and it also represents new beginnings, opportunities and start of a new day. Please see to it that this sector is not cut or missing and cluttered in the house. If this is the case, you will have to work harder because the flow of new opportunities gets restricted. 

 This imbalance is corrected effectively by first clearing the clutter and then introducing the tree element. Tall fresh healthy green plants when placed here help generate the boost you presently need for new projects. You can also stimulate this area by placing a music system here. This is an effective tool used in work areas as it always helps create movement that results in continuous flow of business. Finally, surround yourself with fire and earth elements and their respective colours like red, maroon, beige, cream and yellow.

 Bath bane

 Q: I have two sons born in 1995 and 1998 respectively. Both my sons are otherwise very active but inattentive when it comes to studies. They are also always fighting among themselves. Recently we shifted to a new flat that has a bathroom in the north-east corner. I know this is not auspicious according to Feng Shui, so please suggest a remedy for this. Also let me know what I can do to aid my childrens progress and development.

 Mita Saha

 The Solution: North-east is the zone of tranquillity, inner peace, wisdom and education for its residents. Having a toilet in this vital part of the house that is also connected with gods blessings is not a good idea. The best remedy would be to convert it into a wash area and remove the commode from there. Alternatively, paint its walls in pure white and place a full-length mirror on the outside of the toilet door to negate the negative effects of the toilet. 

 The room in the north-east, next to the toilet, should be turned into the childrens study. The prevailing composed energy here will calm down their aggressive temperaments and help them concentrate on their studies, which will result in their progress and development. 

 They should be made to study in the north-east corner of the room. While studying they should face the wall that doesnt share the toilet wall.

 Door dilemma

 Q: I am planning to build my dream home that is still in the designing process. I would like you to give me valuable guidelines on the placement of doors in a hallway that would lead to different bedrooms.

 Archana Agarwal

 The Solution: A hallway that has too many doors opening into different rooms is potentially chaotic. You should design them in such a way that the doors are placed at regular alternating intervals to allow smooth and easy movement of Chi. 

 They should never be made to face one another as this suggests lack of privacy and conflict. A door that partially overlaps or cuts halfway through the opposite door is considered extremely inharmonious and suggests unfriendliness between the residents using the two bedrooms. 

 Never design a door that is situated at the end of a long hallway as it will receive secret arrows in the same way as a dead-end house does. Ensure that they do not open out and bang into each other as this may injure the residents.

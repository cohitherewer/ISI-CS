 Silent Conversations, Divine Element, Re-emergence? Some arrangements in Blume 2005 that took place on August 31 and September 1 at Joytirmai Seva Mandir, 37/1/A Garcha Road.

 The exhibition was organised by Prithvi, an academy teaching flower arrangements from its premises at 26/2 Ballygunge Circular Road.

 On display were 24 floral exhibits under three categories of Sublime Minimalism, Weave a Spell and Floral Couture, based on current international flower trends.

 Flower arrangement as an art form is not recognised in our country yet, unlike other art forms like painting, singing and dancing. Floral art has not been able to create a niche till now, said Kavita Poddar, founder of Prithvi. There are a handful of institutions that have taken the initiative in this art form to put it on the global map.

 Pushp Bitan, formed by Kavita and her colleagues supporting this art form, is one. It is, in fact, a member of the World Associations of Flower Arrangers (WAFA). WAFA was formed by flower arrangers all over the world. From each country, only one floral art organisation can become a member. From India, Pushp Batin got this honour in 1990, said Kavita, in the floral field for over 20 years now.

 She started out by arranging flowers at birthdays, small parties and marriages. Around a decade back, I decided to stop all commercial operations related to this art. It was then that I decided to open Prithvi and tried to promote this art. The most important thing about this is ideation. Otherwise, everything is simple, said Kavita.

 The objective of WAFA ? to create awareness about this unexplored art form and establish international flower trends ? was mirrored in the Prithvi show. 

 The ingredients used are all easily available ? bamboo shoots, foliage, different type of grasses, twigs, wood pieces and flowers.

 Word ? and value ? of the floral art is beginning to bloom. 

 At any given time, Prithvi has more than 25 students learning various nuances of flower arrangements. People have taken to it well but the art is still in its nascent stages, said Kavita.

 Tress talk

 Chic styles, vivacious colours and cuts promising to make heads turn ? 55 beauticians and hair dressers lapped up essential tips on all this and more at a hair and beauty seminar in Peerless Inn.

 Lata Khanchandani, a cosmetologist from Mumbai, gave a live demonstration on the technicalities and intricacies for the perfect cut, colour and style. Having trained in the likes of Toni and Guy Hairdressing Academy, Morris Academy, Kimarie Hair Training and Beauty Centre and Nalini and Yasmin Hair Academy, she now has a host of beauty salons and a school in Mumbai.

 The experience gained from the academies and by attending seminars has taught me the importance of knowing the art well. A professional approach is only possible when you know the appropriate methods of application in parting, distribution, elevation, angles and cuts, said the 62-year-old.

 The interactive session included demonstrations on a host of cuts like forward graduation, natural inversion, round layers, square layers and long layers, on models. Participants like Mahua Majumdar even received a complete makeover.

 I have used shades of ash, red, copper and silver for the complete effect, explained Lata. Cuts like the creative step cut have been her trademark. After all, hair styling is all about adding your own artistic touches. If you want a quick hair cut in minutes that is the perfect combination of style and grace, the creative hair cut is the choice, smiled Lata.The seminar was also used to display Forever Living, a brand of Aloe Vera products from the US, promising hair re-growth, toning and weight loss.

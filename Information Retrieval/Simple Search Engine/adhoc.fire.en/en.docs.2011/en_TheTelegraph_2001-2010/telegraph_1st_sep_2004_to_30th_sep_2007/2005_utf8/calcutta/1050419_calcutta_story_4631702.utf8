The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Late-night jewel heist off airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Exactly a year ago, a car belonging to two businessmen was hijacked at Teghoria, on VIP Road. Early on Monday, half-a-km from that spot on the same road, a Gujarat-based trader was robbed of his valuables at gunpoint.

 Shortly after touching down at Calcutta airport from Mumbai late at night, 50-year-old Hemendra Soni was on his way to his Burtola house when the robbers struck at Kaikhali.

 The gun-toting gang stopped the car and demanded that the passengers hand over their possessions. 

 Soni, who was travelling with his son, Hitendra, 30, and nephew Himangshu, 27, had no choice but to hand over cash and ornaments worth over Rs 5 lakh. 

 Soni spent the night at Baguiati police station lodging a complaint. ?With so many flights landing in the city at night, there is virtually no choice but to travel at this hour,? explained Soni.

 The district police, often criticised for lack of strict vigil on the VIP Road-EM Bypass section, went into an overdrive on Monday, in their effort to track the robbers. 

 ?We have found some leads. The car was last seen speeding towards Rajarhat New Town,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 Early on Monday, Soni left the airport lounge with his son and nephew Himangshu. The three men got into their car around 2.30 am.

 The Ambassador sped down VIP Road towards Ultadanga. After the first few minutes across the almost-deserted road, Himangshu, who was driving the car, noticed that another Ambassador was tailing them.

 Soni asked Himangshu to allow the vehicle to pass. But the Ambassador, instead of driving past, veered dangerously towards their car, bringing them to an abrupt halt near Kaikhali.

 Within seconds, four young men, armed with home-made revolvers, emerged and asked the three to step out of their car. Two gangsters pressed revolvers to Soni?s temple.

 Soni was carrying a consignment of ornaments belonging to a Burrabazar-based trader. The robbers took the ornaments, kept in a bag behind the rear seat, and emptied the pockets of Soni and of the two young men, before driving away towards Rajarhat. The Sonis rushed to the police station.

 ?The ornaments were insured and we are not ruling out anything, even a staged robbery,? said police.

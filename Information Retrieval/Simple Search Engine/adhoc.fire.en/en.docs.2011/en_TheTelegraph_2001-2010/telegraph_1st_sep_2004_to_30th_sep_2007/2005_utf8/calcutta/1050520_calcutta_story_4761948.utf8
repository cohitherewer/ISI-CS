 Marksheets prolong wait

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The results of the ISC and ICSE examinations were made available on the Internet on Wednesday, but the examinees have not been able to breathe easy, as they haven?t received their marksheets yet.

 Examinees thronged schools from Thursday morning in the hope of collecting their marksheets. They had to return home disappointed, as none of the schools had received the marksheets from the council. The authorities, too, had no idea about when the marksheets would reach the schools.

 For the examinees, it meant more tension, as some of the websites where the results had been made available carried the fine-print that they would not bear any responsibility for errors in marks.

 ?We can be certain about our marks only after we get the original marksheets,? said a student of a south Calcutta school. ?Even though the websites carried subject-wise division of marks, we need to double-check the figures,? she added.

 Moreover, since many science students have been disappointed with their ISC marks, they are keen to get hold of their marksheets.

 ?I have fared surprisingly badly in physics. I want to see my marksheet to be sure that there is no mistake,? said a student of a reputed central Calcutta boys? school.

 Parents were equally tense. Bula Basu, whose son studies at Don Bosco, Park Circus, complained: ?When the council decided to declare the results on Wednesday, why didn?t it make arrangements to ensure that the marksheets reached the schools within 24 hours of the declaration of the results. After all, it only takes a few hours for a courier to arrive from Delhi.?

 Montoo Rakhit, principal of Calcutta Girl?s School and coordinating convener of the ISC examinations, confirmed late in the evening that she had received the ISC marksheets.

 ?I have informed the zonal conveners about the arrival of the marksheets,? she said.

 Most schools, however, had no idea that the ISC mark-sheets had arrived.The ICSE marksheets had not reached the coordinating convener for the examinations, Richard Flynn.

Aakriti: Bengal beauties

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

LIFESTYLE 

ZONE

The cosy corner stall in the front block of City Centre 

in Salt Lake may not catch your eye. But don?t miss it if you are on the look 

out for some authentic handicraft from all over the state. Indeed, Aakriti, a 

one-stop store that houses everything from dokra to shola, kantha 

to ox-horn, is the perfect place for those who want a taste of the good life 

gone by.

Started as an effort to provide a platform to city 

NGOs working to revive dying art forms from across the state, this store has now 

become the regular address for visitors ? national and international ? looking 

to take back a little piece of the City of Joy with them. Not only does the traditional 

handiwork of artisans do well to draw arts enthusiasts, there is an added attraction 

for customers who want to lend a hand for social causes: the proceeds from sales 

are channelised back into the contributing NGOs.

Metal and earth

With a large number of stores stocking dokra, 

Aakriti has made it a point to stand out. Here, not only are the pieces finely 

crafted, the motifs are also considerably different. Particularly attractive is 

a series depicting villagers at their daily chores. Terracota figurines ranging 

from abstract forms to religious deities are cheap picks at the store. Large wooden 

sculptures of goddess Durga make a bold Bengali statement.

Nokshi kantha

The last generation of home-made kanthas was 

when grandmom strained her eyes to embroider an elaborate design. Not only have 

these become a rarity in most households, embroidered kanthas that make 

excellent decorative pieces are very difficult to come by even if one were ready 

to shell out a good amount of money for it. However at Aakriti, a wide range of 

authentic pieces created by villagers are in stock.

A piece of traditional Bengal, a kantha could 

be a great gift for an international guest or a perfect wall adornment in an ethnic 

home. One can also pick up a range of kantha-stitch adorned jackets, salwar 

suits and short kurtas from here.

Ox-horn utensils

Unlikely as a medium for kitchen goods but endlessly 

artistic are the utensils carved out of ox-horn. In shiny black or brown, you 

find everything from bowls to spoons and even salt and pepper shakers. Innovating 

on the product line, one NGO has introduced items like a rosogolla server 

? a spoon with perforations that help to strain out the syrup. A big hit with 

home-makers, these items, though a little heavy on the pocket, promise to jazz 

up the kitchen.

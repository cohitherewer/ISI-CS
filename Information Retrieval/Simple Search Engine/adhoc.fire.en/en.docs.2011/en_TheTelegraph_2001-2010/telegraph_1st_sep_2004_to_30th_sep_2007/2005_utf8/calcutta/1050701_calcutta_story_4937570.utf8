The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Footwork for future 

Talent they have aplenty, and now with the means to 

make their dreams come true, these budding cricketers are all set for a long innings.

 Subhajit Banerjee is all of 14 years old, but already a star in his own right. The budding cricketer scored over 900 runs in the last eight matches he played. Now, the boy from Barasat is on the fast track to fame and fortune, with a little help.

 The captain of the Mainland-Sambaran Cricket Academy junior team is not the only bright spark. There are plenty more, like Swagatam Sur and Asif Pradhan. The team is still high on the victory in the Ambar Roy Memorial Sub-Junior Cricket Tournament, having defeated Durgapur Cricket Club. On Wednesday, the youngsters were felicitated by Anjan Chatterjee, director, Mainland China.

 But the spotlight was shining firmly on Subhajit, who is all set to head off to either Australia or England for professional cricket coaching, sponsored by the Mainland China Group. ?This is an honour,? smiled the all-rounder. He practises four to five hours every day, apart from the Thursday, Saturday and Sunday morning sessions with coaches Sambaran Banerjee, Debopam Sarkar and Debabrata Bhattacharya at the academy. 

 ?I do fall behind in my studies, especially when there are matches, but my teachers are very supportive. Sometimes they even call me home to give me extra classes so I don?t suffer,? adds the Sourav Ganguly fan, who began playing at age six. Winning trophies for the school team also helps. The student of Satya Bharati School, Barasat, wins individual prizes for his batting and bowling talents in most matches, from Shyam Park to Siliguri. 

 On Wednesday, each member of the team was given a kit bag, T-shirt, cap, track suit, sneakers and a memento, as well as a Rs-5,000 cash prize. Subhajit, Swagatam (best all-rounder) and Asif (best bowler) won Rs 7,500 in cash. 

 For all three boys, family support is essential to achieve their dreams ? Ranji Trophy to Team India. ?My parents always watch my matches when they happen to be in Calcutta,? says Subhajit.

 ?But getting away from school for every match is not easy, unless the Cricket Association of Bengal provides a letter,? says Swagatam, a Sachin Tendulkar die-hard who travels to Calcutta from Chandernagore three days a week, bright and early, for coaching at the academy. 

 ?We also play for our schools, so it helps,? says Asif, a spin-bowler from Don Bosco Park Circus. The Harbhajan fan is determined to get his off-spin just right to make it into the big league ? professional cricket.

 Both Sambaran Banerjee and Anjan Chatterjee agreed that the boys had a long way to go yet. But here is talent that needs to be nurtured and encouraged. The plan is to rope in the likes of Mohinder Amarnath or Sunil Gavaskar to coach the boys in batting at the academy.

What?s on your mind this week

Weather 

woes

At the end of the long and sweltering summer, monsoon 

has finally arrived. But our complaints against mother nature have not ceased. 

Only days ago, Calcuttans were groaning in the terrible heat and were cursing 

nature. Now, they are offended by the wet weather. People are now awaiting the 

winter. It is in man?s nature to complain and no matter what mother nature has 

to offer, we are never satisfied. Satisfaction can come provided we live in the 

present, enjoy the present and not expect too much of the future. The past is 

unforgettable, the present is inevitable and the future is acceptable.

?Is it true? Someone said they?re banning smoking 

on screen. Is this a joke? Do they think Feluda has a bad effect on youngsters?? 

I?m sure this would have been Satyajit Ray?s reaction if he had heard the ridiculous 

idea. But it?s true. Smoking has been banned on screen. A desi version 

of Sherlock Holmes will henceforth have to solve crimes without lighting up his 

trademark pipe.Whether it will help cut down on air pollution is debatable, and 

whether it will help the young stay away from the perils of smoking is another 

issue altogether. I?m not condoning consumption of tobacco. But banning smoking 

on screen is a logic beyond reasoning. Why is alcohol not banned as well? We see 

on TV Chandler Bing (Friends) being boycotted by his friends every time 

he lights up. And we?ve had movies like Hum Tum where the heroine takes 

a puff and is disgusted by its taste. These are a few instances where smoking 

is condemned, perhaps with little or no effect. Sanju Baba, Vivek Oberoi et al 

play smoking, gun-toting villains, and yet somehow, some of us feel that cigarettes 

have a worse effect than murders on children. If everybody were to take up smoking 

after seeing their hero on celluloid, they?re sure to follow up with machine guns 

and go on killing sprees, too. The best way is to expose children to the darker 

side of life and let them make their own choices. Adults can guide them, but chances 

are the child will follow the smoking example of a family member. Now that smoking 

is banned on screen, it has become more ?cool?. If the world can survive the visual 

onslaught of smoking through classics like the Godfather, Breathless 

and Schindler?s List to name a few, so can we.

 Ban bandhs 

It is disheartening to see bandhs so frequently in 

Bengal. The one on June 27 saw transport come to a standstill in Calcutta, to 

protest the rising prices of diesel and petrol. Is this the only way to seek a 

solution? Rarely is a constructive result achieved through bandhs here. It leads 

to a day of loss at work, school and college. The elderly and sick have to face 

undue inconvenience. It is high time political parties resort to alternative means 

to make their voices heard instead of increasing the problems of common people, 

which they seek to eradicate through these bandhs.

 A letter of retribution... 

Rose,

 Thank you for my spurious past,

 Engraved in impeccable lies,

 Eclipsed by a cryptic lady,

 And her illusory eyes.

 Bayonets of time still haunt me,

 Cutting my veins every time,

 Asking for a laconic ?showcause?,

 For your legendary crime.

 My melancholic dreams and lonely tears,

 Get buried in the brimming ashtray,

 ? Handcuffing my mirror image,

 Blackening out the serene day.

 Your petals were never so nefarious,

 That cast a curse on my brain,

 Was my love so fickle,

 To get slaughtered in this pain?

 My idyllic songs have vanished,

 In the multi-hued sky,

 Empty spaces get shorter,

 And I search for a place to cry.

 Stabbing this feeble dreamer,

 Tell me, what have you got?

 Forgive me if I am guilty

 Punish me if I am not.

 The hours pass like centuries,

 Freudian thoughts seem to burn,

 What?s my fault ?

 To love you or to give love in return?

 Your nemesis,

 Meghomallar.

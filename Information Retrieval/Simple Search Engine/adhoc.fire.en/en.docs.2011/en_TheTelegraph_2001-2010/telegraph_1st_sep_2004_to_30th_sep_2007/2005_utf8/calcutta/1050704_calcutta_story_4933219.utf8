 500-cr plan for wetlands

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The government has formed a new board to look after matters related to the protection and development of wetlands.

 The chief secretary will chair the seven-member board, comprising secretaries of the departments of environment, fisheries and land and land reforms, the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas and two representatives from NGOs.

 According to Writers? Buildings officers, the board?s prime responsibility will be to monitor and oversee the development of the East Calcutta Wetlands, a Ramsar site.

 ?We have taken up a Rs 500-crore comprehensive plan to develop and beautify the 12,500-hectare East Calcutta Wetlands. The board will supervise the implementation of the project, interact with the Centre and take steps to remove the hurdles in implementing the project. The board will be the sole authority in this field,?? said environment secretary Asim Barman.

 ?We have sought formal permission from the high court on the formation of the new board and expect to obtain it soon. We will issue a notification after obtaining the court?s nod,?? Barman said. 

 Permission from the high court was essential, as the development of the East Calcutta Wetlands has been taken up under its instructions, Barman explained.

 Greening of the entire area is part of the comprehensive plan. A botanical garden, bird sanctuary and an amusement park will be set up, and eco-tourism, horticulture and water sports will be developed.

 ?The Union forest and environment ministry has approved the draft proposal and a detailed plan is awaiting its approval. The Centre has assured financial assistance for the project. We are trying to get funds from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World Bank,? the environment secretary said.

 ?Since it is a Ramsar site, the Centre is holding talks with these two foreign funding agencies,? he added.

 The East Calcutta Wetlands have been recognised by Wetlands International as ?an international ecological site?? under the Ramsar convention. Once included in the list by Wetlands International, under a convention signed in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar, no land-use is permitted in the waste-recycling region other than those that support the wetlands or wetlands-related practices. 

 According to estimates, over 500 acres have been encroached upon by a shantytown of fishermen. ?We are taking several initiatives to remove the squatters. We may provide them with an alternative livelihood by involving them in the project?s implementation,? said an officer of the environment department.

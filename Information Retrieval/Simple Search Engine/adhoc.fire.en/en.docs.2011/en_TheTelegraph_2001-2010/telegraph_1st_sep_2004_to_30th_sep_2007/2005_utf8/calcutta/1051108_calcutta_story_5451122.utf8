The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Wait for a watershed

 It has been years since he did Josh, but Sharad Kapoor still savours the film. The Shah Rukh Khan-Aishwarya Rai-starrer has, till now, been the high point of his 11-year-old career in Bollywood. Both SRK and Ash have gone places since then, but Sharad is still waiting for that one watershed moment in his celluloid life. A tarot-card reader has predicted that it will be sometime in mid-June 2006 and Sharad sure is keeping his fingers crossed.

 ?Struggling for a place in Bollywood hasn?t been easy but I have had a great experience. I have a big flat and many cars now,? says the Calcutta boy who left home to be in the movies with ?Rs 300? in his pocket and debuted along with Sushmita Sen in Dastak.

 In town to celebrate Diwali with friends and family, Sharad caught up with old acquaintances (one of them being Tollywood hero Jeet) and dropped in for dinner at his Outram Street restaurant Tangerine.

 Back in Bollywood, he has around three films going on the floors ? You and I (tentative title) to be directed by art director Arup Adhikary; Anees Bazmi?s Radheshyam Sitaram, co-starring Aishwarya Rai, Suniel Shetty and Raj Babbar; and Nexus from Venus Films, with Vijay Raaz as co-actor.

 ?I will play the main villain in Radheshyam Sitaram. It?s a comedy revolving round the mafia. In You and I, which is a story of two couples, I play a cop. Nexus is about world terrorism where I am a jihadi and it?s a very loveable character,? says Sharad, adding after a pause: ?You know I started as a lead but got lost somewhere. When Josh happened, I didn?t even have my family?s support...?

 With the roles of leading men eluding him and a new hero being born every three months, is he feeling even more insecure? ?No, not at all,? Sharad protests. ?We are senior actors and that?s not a problem.?

 Yet, if Bollywood doesn?t have much to offer, the doors to Tollywood are always open. There?s a dearth of heroes in the industry here and the offers are trickling in, but they just aren?t good enough to enthuse Sharad.

 ?I have done a couple of films here, including Satarupa Sanyal?s Kalo Cheeta with Rituparna Sengupta . But now I won?t agree if the proposal isn?t really good,? he stresses.

 Tollywood?s loss can be traced to its technology and its professionalism (or rather the lack of both). ?In Mumbai, the equipment set-up is much better and I am used to working in fixed hours. Here people get late and that is a bother,? Sharad reasons.

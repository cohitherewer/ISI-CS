The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gastro spurt in rain wake

 - Contamination cry from flooded zones

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The depression has led diseases to the city. 

 Gastro-enteritis laid low many in Calcutta, even as parts of Tiljala, Topsia, Behala and Ekbalpore remained under water on Monday. 

 From the morning, patients started trooping in at the Infectious Diseases hospital in Beleghata with complaints of diarrhoea, vomiting and fever. By late evening, as many as 84 had turned up at the hospital with symptoms of acute gastro-enteritis. 

 Officials at the hospital feared the figure would cross 130 by midnight, a possibility that the civic officials and the mandarins of health did not rule out either. 

 ?Patients, mostly children below 15, have been turning up with symptoms of gastro-enteritis. Their number was significantly high on Monday. It appears that most of them are victims of water contamination, following the incessant rains over the last six days,? said Dr Asok Bannerjee of the Beleghata hospital.

 The majority of the patients were from Topsia, Tiljala, Beleghata, Bangur, Entally and Kalighat ? areas where waterlogging was severe. 

 ?My daughter started vomiting a couple of days ago. She was better yesterday, but has been suffering from loose motion since the night. She could barely speak this morning,? cried Sampa Bhattacharya, mother of one-and-a-half-year-old Sneha. The Bhattacharyas live in Bangur.

 The paediatric wards of the other hospitals, too, were filled up with gastro-enteritis patients. Many needed an immediate shot of intravenous fluid. According to doctors, children are vulnerable to gastro-enteritis since their immune systems are not fully developed. 

 ?We were apprehending an outbreak of gastro-enteritis,? stated Apurba Ghosh, director, Institute of Child Health.

 The civic officials, however, claimed that they were yet to hear of water contamination in any part of the city. 

 ?Allah in logon ko maaf nahin karega (Allah will not pardon these people). Just look at our condition. The water has remained stagnant on the roads. We are forced to wade through human excreta. The civic officials have done nothing,? complained Mohammed Swraff, of 55/1K, Tiljala Road.

 Some residents of the area blocked Tiljala Road and Abinash Choudhury Lane for half-an-hour on Monday afternoon to protest civic apathy. The blockade was withdrawn after police intervention.

 The civic officials claimed that they had asked councillors and borough chairmen to remain prepared to handle problems arising out of water contamination.

 ?The executive borough health officers have been asked to keep halogen tablets ready for distribution,? said Deb Dwaipayan Chatterjee, health chief at Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

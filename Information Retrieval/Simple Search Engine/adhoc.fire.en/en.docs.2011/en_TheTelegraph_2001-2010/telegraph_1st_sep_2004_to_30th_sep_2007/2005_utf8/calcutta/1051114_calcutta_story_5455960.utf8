Life

 Blossoms then and now

 Nothing says it more beautifully than a bunch of red roses, or birds of paradise should we say. Happy Birthday, sorry or I love you ? whatever the message may be, the medium surely hasnt changed. But with international florists setting up shop in Calcutta, the multiplicity of the medium has surely undergone a sea change.

 Gone are the days when those looking to say it with flowers would head straight for the row of shops at New Market. With nowhere else to go, shoppers had to ignore the thorn prick of the rose sticks strewn on the slushy market floor.

 Cut to 2005: ordering exotic flowers such as oriental lilies, orchids, gerberas and daisies can be as simple as the click of a mouse or a breeze through air-conditioned comfort.

 Ambience 

 For those stuck in the old-is-gold mould, some of the shops at New Market, like A. Bose Pvt Ltd, are still worth a trip. A. Bose, for one, has been in the business for over 115 years. Theres no d?cor to talk of ? just a few showcases and stools laid out amidst the heap of cane baskets, ribbons and flowers ? but theres no missing the sense of nostalgia that pervades the place.

 While some shopkeepers are busy doing up bouquets, others sprinkle water on their ware. This happens to be the place where the British, Calcuttas elite, hotels and business houses would order their flowers from.

 Says a spokesperson for A. Bose: Very little of the clientele my forefathers catered to remains today. The quality of the crowd now is highly cosmopolitan, the class factor largely lacking.

 Miles away from the old-world charm of New Market, walking into the channel music-aided, cool showrooms of Ferns and Petals or Right Florist is a very different experience.

 Fresh and dried flowers, candles and pebbles arranged innovatively replace the ubiquitous cane baskets piled on the ground. And if you are confused at the variety of options, trained help is at hand, too.

 Says Indira Agarwal of Ferns and Petals: We provide everything from personalised arrangements to little things needed to do up homes. People get everything they want under one roof. And todays shopper is very concerned about the ambience, even if it is just flowers.

 Pocket pinch

 The flower row at New Market, no doubt, remains the budget destination. Price tags begin at Rs 50 and the exotic, expensive ones costs anything between Rs 700 and Rs 800. 

 At boutiques, the same kind of bouquets, only differently styled, start from Rs 150 and easily go into a few thousands, minus the delivery charges.

 Even with such competitive prices, we are struggling to make ends meet. This is because the number of customers over the past few years has gone down. The long-pending Parkomat slated to come up in front of the market is also a major cause for this drop. These days, no one wants to walk that extra mile. Also, since we do not offer tele-ordering, we are losing out fast, laments a shopkeeper at Coondoo Florist, a shop amongst the chain of 20-25 florists in that little history lane.

 According to Rajesh Rathi of Right Florist, most people want more than just value for money ? the right ambience, easy order and delivery.

 These are clearly areas where we score much higher than the old flower shops. The ambience and packaging matters a lot to the new-age customer, adds Rathi.

 Delivery 

 While the shops at New Market would go only to the extent of delivering to city addresses ? that too after youve placed the order in person ? these newer shops are well equipped to deliver flowers with ease, both, nationally and internationally. Right Florist even gives you the option of placing your orders online. People dont mind spending an extra buck if they can get the flowers of their choice delivered at their doorstep, ordering from the comfort of their homes, says Rathi.

 Old market over new, anyone?

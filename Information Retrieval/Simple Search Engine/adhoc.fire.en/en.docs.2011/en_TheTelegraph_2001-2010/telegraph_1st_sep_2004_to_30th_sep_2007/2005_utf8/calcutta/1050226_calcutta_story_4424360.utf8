The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Signature store, customer connect

 - Distinctive domain concept at City Centre spells brand boost, sale spurt

 SUBHRO SAHA

 From a 100-Hz, 44-inch projection TV with an XD engine for clarity enhancement to a high-end Blackberry or a computer-aided vehicle tracking system. A sensuous hazelnut truffle or a sinful scoop of shrikhand? All in focused, uncluttered formats, independent of and outside the confines of multi-brand outlets.

 Speciality flagship stores are in, stacking their retail racks with a myriad mix to disseminate brand information and raise recall. And City Centre ? desperate to convert footfalls into sales figures ? is treading the speciality store route to show and sell well.

 Take the Airtel outlet, the first of its kind in the country, offering information on services and new technology, besides customer-care solutions. ?The response has been very encouraging, with around 150 walk-ins on an average every day,? says Rohit Kapoor of the Airtel touch-feel outlet.

 For those who sell as well as showcase, the distinctive domain is translating into customer connect. At the LG Lifestyle Shoppe in the same mall, footfalls top 400 on weekends, says proprietor Jiten Chawla.

 ?It?s a win-win situation for both the customer and the retailer, where the former gets access to new products and the store benefits from the mall?s captive footfall,? says Harsh Neotia, who developed Salt Lake?s City Centre.

 The Charles Correa signature project has been first off the blocks with such flagship stores, housing novel outlets like Just Linc, a ?complete writing solution? store, displaying pens ranging from Rs 2 to Rs 6,300.

 Belgique Chocolates, which promises to have ?perfected the European art of chocolatiering to suit the Indian palate? and Amul?s ?first food parlour in the East? are also speciality stores in the same mall.

 Abhijit Das, eastern operations head of international property consultants Chesterton Meghraj, feels City Centre has pioneered the trend of unique speciality stores in Calcutta malls. ?Such flagship stores were present at high-street locations before, but this is the first time they are coming together inside a mall context here,? he says.

 All upcoming malls would be factoring in speciality stores to fit into their formats, adds Das, with strong brands like Titan and Wellspun scouting for flagship store space.

 Sumit Dabriwal, developer of The Metropolis, feels this is more an initiative to create brand personality ?where you take the brand out of a basket of commodities and control the total customer experience to ensure better recall?. The Hiland Park mall is also in dialogue with retailers for flagship stores.

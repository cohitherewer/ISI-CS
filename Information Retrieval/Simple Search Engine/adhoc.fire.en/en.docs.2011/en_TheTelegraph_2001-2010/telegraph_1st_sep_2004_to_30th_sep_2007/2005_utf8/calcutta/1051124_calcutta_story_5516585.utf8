 I changed action to comedy

 Thus spake JACKIE CHAN when Pratim D. Gupta caught up with him in Mumbai. The Rush Hour man smashed the myth about violence, lambasted all things American

 How do you feel on your first trip to Mumbai, which produces the maximum films in the world?

 It?s an honour. Even a few months back, I was shooting in this country, in Hampi. I always wanted to come to India but I have a very tight schedule. Not just my movies, I have to travel a lot for my charity work. I could come to Mumbai for just one day. I am off next to London and then after two days, I start a new film in China.

 What prompted you to shoot a portion of The Myth in India?

 Around five years ago, I was planning to make a movie in India. It was mainly because of the locations. Locations help my action sequences. A photographer friend of mine had given me a picture book of an Indian royal family. And I knew I had to shoot there. I was planning an Indiana Jones kind of a movie. I sent a script to an Indian producer. He sent me his script. The two cultures were so different that I didn?t like his script and he didn?t like my script. I then decided that one day I will shoot a film in India.

 How did you find India when you shot here?

 The government really helped us a lot. The Indian crew, I found, was very friendly and professional. There were mountains and they were all going up and down, walking for hours. They were always smiling. 

 Did you expect such a craze for you here?

 (Smiles) I had no idea. People here are too crazy about me. I have to hide wherever I go. I learnt it more while shooting for the film. The local people would stay the whole day on the sets just to watch me. It?s strange why they like me so much. 

 Have you ever seen an Indian film?

 In the last couple of years, I have seen a lot of Indian movies. Don?t ask me the names ? I can?t remember them. But the colours, the dance, the camera movement? It?s about time that we should change our style and call Indian film-makers to make films your way. In fact I want to make a film in two versions. One for the world and one for India. The Indian version would have singing and dancing.

 You have your own specialty too ? mixing comedy with action? 

 To me, action is not a violent thing. Twenty years ago, I changed action to comedy. There are so many children around the world who watch my movies. So I can?t show violence in my action. Compared to American violence, the violence in my movies is zero. There?s no blood. My movie doesn?t have dirty words too. So many of my fans are children.

 Your stunts are legendary. Do you still work out everyday?

 Yes, everyday I still practise martial arts. Many of my bones have broken in the process but I never gave up. Even if it took me 15 years to get into the American market. In the beginning, they didn?t like my blend of action and comedy. But today they all want to learn the Jackie Chan style.

 Why haven?t you gone for a co-production with India?

 I don?t know how the Indian film market functions, how many theatres there are, how many prints you need, but I will learn. India, China, Japan, Korea? we have to all come together against American movies. The American culture is becoming too strong. Everywhere you go, you have young people listening to American music and watching American movies. We have to protect our own culture. And we have to do it through movies.

 You haven?t directed a film since Drunken Master? 

 I know. I am planning to direct a movie soon. 

 What other projects do you have in hand now?

 The next film I am starting in December is called Project BB. It?s how we all steal a baby and how everyone gets involved including the mafia, the police? it?s a big comedy. Then you will see a different Jackie coming up in the Shinjin Story. It will be shot in Japan and be based on a true story. Then there?s Rush Hour 3. 

 Any plans to shoot Rush Hour in India? 

 Rush Hour 3 will be shot in New York and Paris... Maybe Rush Hour 4. Even if Chris Tucker doesn?t come, I will come and shoot here!

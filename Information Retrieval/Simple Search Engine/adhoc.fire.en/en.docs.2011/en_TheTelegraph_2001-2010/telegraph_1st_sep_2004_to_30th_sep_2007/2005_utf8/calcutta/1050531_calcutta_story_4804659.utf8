 An invisible divide

 A marvellous blend of history and imagination, Little Thespians Yaadon Ke Bujhe Huye Savere leads the audience on a journey of emotional exploration and discovery of the painful paradoxes of life. Based on the unhappy, last days of Mughal emperor Shahjahan, the play vividly recounts the wretchedness of the old king, abdicated from kingship and imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb. The Hindi adaptation of Ismail Choonara?s A River Across the Unseen Divide, it faithfully reproduces the theme of melancholy, which pervades the entire play. Gazing restlessly at the Taj Mahal, the monumental edifice he had built to commemorate his love, Shahjahan, is ironically haunted and tormented by the memories of his past. A note of tragic poignancy is struck when, on hearing the gentle murmuring of River Yamuna, he fails to realize that it is the obstacle between him and his destination of desire. Direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala.

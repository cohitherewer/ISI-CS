 Conduct rap for doctors

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 After a four-hour wait outside an oncologist?s chamber, Aloke Mukherjee lost his temper when the doctor started talking to another patient on the phone. After a quarrel, Mukherjee lodged a complaint with the hospital authorities. The doctor, too, left in a huff.

 Bedside manners ? or the lack of it ? is a growing problem not only for patients, but for hospitals too. A list of common complaints (see box) and ever-spiralling costs are the symptoms of ailing medical ethics, feel some experts.

 Hospital authorities are desperately seeking solutions to doctors? attitude problems, leading to angry patients and relatives.

 ?As hospital administrators, it is our job to ensure the doctor-patient relationship is at its best, which is now a growing cause for concern,? admitted Amit De of Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) and a functionary of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI).

 The AHEI, a conglomerate of 12 top private hospitals of the city, recently called a meeting to discuss the issue. ?There are some doctors who are very busy. Many are not but they still have a lot of attitude problems,? said an AHEI official.

 Unavailability of doctors when they are required the most is frequently forcing junior doctors or resident medical officers to look after patients.

 Lack of patient counselling by doctors is a major concern. Ask 50-year-old Sunirmal Adhikari about it. ?Despite many requests, doctors treating my daughter, suffering from a degenerating neurological disorder, would never give us the true picture. By the time we learnt what was wrong, her condition had deteriorated considerably,? he lamented.

 ?Apart from waiting for hours outside the doctor?s chamber, I also have to contend with the bad behaviour of his attendant,? complained Raj Kamal Chowdhury.

 AHEI officials are also trying to involve the state government in improving the deteriorating work ethics in government hospitals.

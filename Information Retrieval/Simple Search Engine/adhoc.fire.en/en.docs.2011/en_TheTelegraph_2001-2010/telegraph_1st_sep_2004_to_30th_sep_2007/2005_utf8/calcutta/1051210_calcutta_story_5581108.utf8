 Trucks slam brakes for ban

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Essential commodities will face the crunch from December 31, if truckers do launch an ?indefinite strike? to protest the government?s decision to ban pre-1990 vehicles from that day.

 The predictable pressure tactic in the countdown to what is still, officially, the deadline to phase out old, polluting vehicles might not be carried through if the government does extend the date by another six months. There has been no announcement yet, but a pushback till after the polls is on the cards.

 ?At least 100,000 trucks will have to be withdrawn if the government order is effected,? said Satyajit Majumdar, general secretary of the Federation of Truck Operators? Associations of Bengal, which has called the strike.

 ?We earn from our vehicles and we will not phase them out unless an alternative arrangement is made. Instead of just 100,000 vehicles, all trucks in the state will go off the road,?? he added on Friday.

 Medium commercial vehicles like Matador vans and tempos, too, will join the strike. However, trucks coming in from other states will not be stopped.

 Traders fear stocks at retail and wholesale markets in Burrabazar, Posta, New Market and Mechhua will run dry at the beginning of the year if the government fails to avert the strike.

 Around 5,000 vehicles from various states supply the city?s wholesale markets daily, carrying essential food items.

 ?Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has not responded to our pleas to revise the phase-out order or make arrangements for owners of old vehicles to buy new ones,? Majumdar said.

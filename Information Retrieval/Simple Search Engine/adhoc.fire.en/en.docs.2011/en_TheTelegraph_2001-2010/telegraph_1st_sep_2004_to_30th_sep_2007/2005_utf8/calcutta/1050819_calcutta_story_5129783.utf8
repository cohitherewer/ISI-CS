 Dengue whiff in girl death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Doctors suspect that the death of 14-year-old Priyanka Das, a Behala resident, at a city nursing home on Monday, was caused by dengue.

 Gautam Buddha Ghosh, who treated Priyanka, said the girl had developed symptoms typical of the disease, like high fever with body ache and a rash all over the body. 

 The disease, however, can be confirmed only after getting the final reports.

 ?There is not much doubt about our diagnosis, but a clearer picture will emerge tomorrow,? said Ghosh. ?The girl had been suffering for the past 15 days, but her parents did not take her to a doctor. We did not have much to do, as the disease had already reached a critical stage,? he pointed out.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya on Monday pledged to provide affordable dengue antigen test facilities in the 63 malaria clinics run by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in the city.

 Bhattacharya made the promise in the civic house meeting held during the day to discuss the dengue situation in Calcutta. Eleven people have died of the disease in the city, while over 3,000 have been afflicted by it.

 The mayor also announced that Cathedral Relief Centre will run a free dengue antigen test camp beside Pratt Memorial School, on AJC Bose Road, from September 27 to October 9.

 Trinamul Congress and BJP councillors repeatedly pointed out during the civic house that the middle-class and lower middle-class people cannot afford the price charged by private clinics for the dengue antigen test. 

 They stated that private clinics were charging Rs 1,200 for a dengue antigen test, even though it cannot cost more than Rs 200.

 The participants at the civic house reached the consensus that one entomologist is not enough for a city as large as Calcutta. 

 Bhattacharya said instead of recruiting entomologists, vector control employees would be given training on the subject.

 On September 30, the CMC has convened an awareness programme on dengue and malaria for councillors in the council chamber. It will be the first requisitioned meeting of the civic body since 1985.

 The Opposition displayed posters, models of mosquitoes and mosquito nets inside the House on Monday. They also covered the microphone with a mosquito net before speaking. 

 Trinamul leader of the Opposition Javed Ahmed Khan, chief whip Anup Chatterjee and councillor Firhad Hakim, and BJP councillor Debabrata Majumdar criticised the mayor for delayed response to the dengue menace. 

 When Bhattacharya claimed that only 2,249 people had been affected by dengue and only nine had died of the disease, the Opposition members protested and said the number of people affected by the disease was several times higher.

 ?It is tougher to include a name on the mayor?s list of dengue deaths than to include a name on the voter?s list,? commented Khan.

 Bhattacharya and mayoral council member (health) Subodh De hit back by saying that if the previous Trinamul-BJP civic board was serious about controlling the breeding of mosquitoes, the dengue outbreak would not have occurred.

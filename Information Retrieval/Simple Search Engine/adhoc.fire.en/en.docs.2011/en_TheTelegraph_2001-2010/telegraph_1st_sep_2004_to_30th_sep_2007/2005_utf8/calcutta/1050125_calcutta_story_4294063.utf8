 Dark day replay at IT hub, airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barely 24 hours after the lights went out on the main runway at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, the state?s IT hub faced a blackout through Monday afternoon.

 Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), the nerve centre of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s resurgent Bengal, went without power for over two-and-a-half hours on Monday as two sub-stations in the area collapsed almost simultaneously, following a technical hitch.

 While the bigger players, like Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Wipro, switched to their generator sets ? installed at a hefty cost ? to conduct business as usual, productivity at smaller units took a hit.

 Webel Bhavan, headquarters of the state government?s nodal IT agency, too, suffered badly, as darkness descended on the sprawling campus in Sector V. ?We do not have generators, so we had to stop working,? admitted S.K. Mitra, managing director, Webel.

 ?This is a nuisance. We understand there were problems, but such instances are disturbing, as we promise 24x7 working conditions here,? said Mitra, adding that the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) had been repeatedly reminded to carry out preventive maintenance.

 Board officials said that around 3 pm, a feeder breaker burst at the 132 KV sub-station in Sector V, followed by snags at another breaker and a current transformer at the 33-KV sub-station.

 ?The double fault led to power failure in the area. Engineers rushed to repair the snags and the sub-stations were restored around 5.20 pm,? said an SEB official.

 Work was thrown out of gear for close to three hours. ?This is the second time in less than two weeks that we are facing such a situation,? grumbled an IT-preneur, left stranded near the lift in one of Saltlec?s intelligent buildings.

 ?Computers couldn?t be switched on, the air-conditioners stopped working? It was a bad day,? said a techhie, voicing the sentiments of Saltlec.

 Not far from the IT hub, the airport witnessed an action replay of a power snag. 

 If on Friday cable damage had plunged the main runway into darkness for more than two hours, airport officials detected a similar fault on Sunday.

 Sources said the cable of Instrumental Landing System (ILS) was found damaged at around 11.30 am. ?Checks at two-hour intervals have now been made mandatory,? said a source at the airport.

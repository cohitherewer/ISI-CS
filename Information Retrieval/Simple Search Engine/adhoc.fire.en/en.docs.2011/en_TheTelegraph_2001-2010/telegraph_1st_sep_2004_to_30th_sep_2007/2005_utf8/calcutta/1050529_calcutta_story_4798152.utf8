 Sun, sand and a serene beach. Add to it some drop-dead gorgeous babes in next to nothing and guys flexing their muscles at the drop of a surfboard and you have the perfect midnight masala on the idiot box. Prince of Cal at Souravs: The Food Pavilion tried to do a Baywatch on Friday night. What followed left one wanting to drown rather than be saved.

 Baywatch was the theme of Fridays fashion show in the long and listless series of fashion shows called Lifestyle Kolkata.

 The news of the Baywatch night hardly created any excitement amongst revellers. In fact, the event management crew outnumbered onlookers and models, who took a leisurely walk around the nightclub.

 For those few who sat through the pointless exercise, red was the predominant colour in designer Soma Chatterjees wardrobe line-up, while the fabric front comprised swimsuits made of crochet, net and crepe.

 For girls

 If girls just wanna have some fun, Big Ben, the English-style pub at Kenilworth, is a good place to head for, every Wednesday night. Thats when the night haunt hosts womens specials that see a series of fashion shows at the nightstop with models walking around in creations by a host of less-heard-of designers of the city.

 The result is an evening of fun and fashion as women, with their men in tow, get to eat, drink, dance and catch some fresh outfits every week.

 The midweek bash this time showcased the collections of Swapna Das and Lipika Chakroborty. The duo draped models Tanushree, Rusa, Sejuthi and some others in saris, salwars and kurtis. 

 The clothes could well be part of your wardrobe if applique, hand-painting and patchwork appeal to your sense of fashion.

 Hot zone

 The Friday night party temperature soared at The Red Kitchen and Lounge as the Bacardi Night Shift got underway. The cramped party venue had a host of known party faces rocking till morning. The party animals found their personal trappings amidst the range of Bacardi shots, games and, perhaps, the mini-skirt-clad hostesses. 

 Tollywood turned out in full strength with Pallavi Chatterjee, Arjun Chakraborty and wife Nilanjana, Arindam Sil and wife Shukla, Abhishek Chatterjee, Deboleena Dutt, Rachana Banerjee and June ruling the dance floor.

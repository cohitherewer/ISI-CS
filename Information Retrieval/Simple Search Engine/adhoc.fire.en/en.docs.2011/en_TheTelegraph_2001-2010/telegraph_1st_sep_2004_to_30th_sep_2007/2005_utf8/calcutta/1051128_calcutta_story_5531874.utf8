The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Ed Harris 

You are positive, considerate, always aiming to do good and rarely flying off the handle. You have difficulty telling a lie, though you?re masterful at spinning gentle untruths. You like to lead, rather than follow. You have an insatiable appetite for activity and always strive to keep things peaceful. You can?t help worrying over small things and constantly re-examining everybody?s agenda. ? Kusum Bhandari

 New Town?s New Year build boon 

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Owners of New Town plots can start construction from New Year, as the stalemate over approval of building plans has been resolved.

 The government has promulgated an ordinance amending the Town and Country Planning Act, empowering Hidco to frame building rules and sanction plans for the Rajarhat township. 

 The agency, however, will cease to enjoy the power once the township gets an elected civic body.

 ?Plot-owners can start construction from next month. By the time the buildings are ready and residents move in, the township will have a competent civic authority,? said Pradyut Biswas, general manager of Hidco, implementing agency of New Town.

 The ordinance amending the Act states that any development authority or planning body engaged in the construction of the township can frame building rules and sanction plans. Accordingly, Hidco and CMDA have been declared planning bodies.

 Hidco has allotted over 5,000 plots to individuals and cooperatives, but not a single owner could start construction for want of a set of building rules and a sanctioning authority. Though Hidco is the implementing agency, it did not have the authority to frame building regulations.

 Following complaints from plot-owners, the government had initiated a move to set up the New Town Development Authority (NTDA), on the lines of CMDA, for framing building rules, supervising development work and providing civic services to residents till a full-fledged municipal body is established.

 Hidco had forwarded the proposal to the Centre, which sent it back seeking a series of clarifications. The process got delayed interminably.

 Housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb then took up the matter with urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and decided to amend the Town and Country Planning Act to make up for the absence of a development authority.

 ?Thousands of plot-owners are eager to start construction. Their wait will end soon. We will hopefully finalise the rules in a fortnight,?? general manager Biswas said. 

 As for the Centre?s queries on the proposed NTDA, he added that the clarifications had been sent and nod for setting up the body might come soon.

 Hidco chairman Deb said officers and engineers were making all efforts to provide the best infrastructure and other amenities in New Town.

 Familiar tales, new format

 - ANIMATED VERSIONS OF SUKUMAR RAY CLASSICS AIMED AT SAVVY KIDS

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The video compact disc cover of Sukumar Ray?s classic, for the new generation that prefers viewing to reading 

 One is a collection of tales about the antics of a somewhat eccentric but always desperate young boy. The other is one of the most loved fantasy stories for children in Bengali.

 The link between the two is the genius of Sukumar Ray. His timeless creations have enthralled generations of Bengalis, and in the recent past, those unfamiliar with the language as well, through translations.

 Now, an effort is being made to reach Ray?s work to a different generation. One that is more comfortable with a compact disc than a book and would prefer to see stories played out on screen in colour and sound than in black-and-white on the printed page.

 Animated versions of Pagla Dashu and Ha Ja Ba Ra La have just been released in video by Sagarika Music. ?We had been thinking about children?s projects for quite some time,? says Subhabrata Duttagupta, sales and marketing in-charge for Sagarika. ?Particularly after some mythological stories released in animation form by our Mumbai branch received a good response from various parts of the country.?

 The first choice for the company, while thinking children, was Sukumar Ray. ?We felt it was our duty to introduce his work to the younger generation,? offers Duttagupta.

 The quality of animation, however, is a concern. ?We don?t have the infrastructure, so it would be unfair to compare it with the Disneys and Cartoon Networks,? points out Duttagupta. But the attempt is to open up the market for the animation format, he adds.

 The Ray creations apart, Sagarika has also released the animated version of Hanumaner Lankakando, an episode from the Ramayana about the monkey-king burning down Lanka.

 Besides offering respite from the ?violent computer games?, Sagarika feels the VCDs would also prove to be a ?healthier? option as gifts. ?Often, we are in a fix over what to give a child on his or her birthday and end up with the same old stuffed toy or chocolate bar. Priced at Rs 95, these would be a better alternative.?

 Sagarika is tying up with schools, children?s publishers and stores that stock children?s clothes and toys, for promoting the titles.

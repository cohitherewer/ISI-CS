The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Many ?executive? buses of Calcutta State Transport Corporation do not halt at authorised bus stoppages even when seats are vacant. That these buses charge much more than the normal state buses, and hence, earn a huge revenue for the government is hardly of any concern to the drivers and conductors. The E-buses are preferred by office-goers and students to reach their destination on time. But thanks to the low frequency and the absurd conduct of the drivers, these buses are now losing business to private chartered buses.

 Certain pockets of Birati, particularly Sarat Colony and Chandpur Pally, are reeling under frequent power cuts for long durations over the past few weeks. CESC seems to have neither an explanation for nor a solution to this problem. It is learnt that minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya also resides in this area and is aware of the crisis. Business at cyber caf?s is also suffering a lot. Can the CESC officials please look into the matter?

 Ameet Sengupta,

 Jessore Road. 

 Thanks to the lack of civic sense of Metro Rail passengers, stations like Chandni Chowk have become very filthy. Also, the trains are not maintained. Sometimes, the doors open with a jerk or don?t open at all. Metro is Calcutta?s pride. Passengers and the authorities should keep the stations and the trains clean. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park.

 Chariots of fervour

 As the wheels of Lord Jagannath?s chariot creak into life for the 287th time onto Diamond Harbour Road in Barisha, the city?s oldest chariot festival celebrated by the Savarna Ray Choudhury family adds another year to its journey. As the count crosses 700 at the Mullicks? free-for-all meal at Marble Palace, it is a tribute to the family deity Lord Jagannath, seated in rajbesh some distance away on His chariot. As the men of the Laha family take to the streets of north Calcutta barefoot, pulling the German silver chariot, passers-by stop in their tracks to lend a pious hand.

 In many corners of Calcutta, rathajatra is a family festival celebrated over a week. Some still grandly spill onto the public domain, while others have scaled down the extravaganza but can hardly keep the affair within closed doors. 

 Savarna Ray Choudhury 

 Calcutta?s ?first family? lined up a couple of firsts this year. What with central minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi inaugurating the ceremony and Lord Jagannath sporting a turban instead of the customary crown. 

 Says Probal Ray Choudhury, scion of the family?s eldest wing and joint secretary of Barisha Sarbojanin Rathajatra Utsab Committee: ?Since its inception in 1719 till 1911, it was the saalgramshila that used to go on tour on the chariot.? Ancestor Lalkumar Ray Chaudhury installed the deity in 1911. The wooden chariot in use now was made in 1984 at a cost of Rs 15,000 with partial public contribution. ?We had craftsmen over from Puri who finished work in 14 days,? recalls Gorachand Ray Choudhury, Probal?s father. 

 Tiny packets, bearing the words ?287tama Barisha rathajatra utsab mahaprosad?, are piled on the table. They have to be folded and packed with naru, goja, pyanra, batasha and a tulsi leaf. ?All the sweets are prepared at home under the supervision of my mother, except the batasha,? the 25-year-old says. The packets, numbering around 500, are to be tossed to devotees during the procession as Harir looth, along with bananas and a quintal of batashas. 

 Swords and spears are getting a polish, too. The Lord?s party is impressive ? three flag-bearers, three umbrella-bearers, four staff-bearers, four bodyguards and five drummers. Three band parties play the charbari, shehnai, dhol and kansar alongside 14 dhakis and saints from the mutt performing Harinaamsankirtan. 

 The procession sets off after a coconut is cracked. One lane of the main road is taken up by the chanting crowd. Probal is in charge of procession management. There is a core team of volunteers with laminated photo-identity cards. They are helped by 50 scouts and a posse of policemen. 

 At the end of the three-hour journey, the lord of the universe rests at the residence of neighbour Hiralal Bose in Bosepara, till Ultarath.

 Marble Palace

 Lord Jagannath is the household deity at Rajendro Mullick?s ivory white mansion, adorned with myriad sculptures in marble. The festival was instituted in 1802 by his father Nilmoni, who also built a temple in the adjoining garden. Rajendro converted the entire estate to a debuttar property, ensuring that Jagannath is worshipped with equal fervour over the years with its income. 

 ?The highlight of our festival is daridranarayan seba that continues over the week. If a couple of hundred flock here round the year for meals, the figure quadruples on the big day,? smiles Hirendro Mullick, a member of the sixth generation, sitting in a room bearing witness to the golden days of Calcutta?s babu culture in every article of use.

 Outside in the garden, the five-storeyed chariot, painted afresh in white, is dragged to the door of the temple, ready to seat the Lord on a silver throne when He is brought out in red regal finery. ?Every employee of the estate has his role assigned for the puja.? Like Mullick himself, the priest, his helpers, the cooks and the hymn-singers are all from families that are in their sixth generation of service to the Lord. Danre bhog (offering taken standing) is offered twice ? once in front of the Laxmi temple and again at the end of the journey at the eastern-most corner of the complex, where the chariot stays till Ultarath. The Mullick rath never trundles out on the streets. ?But people are welcomed in, both to view the deity and enjoy the fair that takes place on the occasion,? he says. 

 At the end of the journey, the idol returns on the shoulders of the family members for arati. ?It starts with a kirtan composed by Rajendro Mullick himself.? 

 The days before rathajatra are just as busy indoors. ?My 80-year-old aunt, along with other elders, holds forth on the 55-item-strong list of bhog items.? Just as Jagannath?s attire changes in accordance with the appearance He assumes, the menu too differs on each day of the week till Ultarath. For days ahead, bori (one of the five mandatory fries) is dried on the roof-top and the kasundi (to be offered on one of the days before Ultarath) is stored in two huge Japanese vases. The evening before, vegetables are to be chopped, spices ground and betel leaves filled in and folded? ?The youngest choose the last as that provides the most scope for adda,? he laughs.

 The Lord?s kitchen is serious business, though. All 12 ovens will be lit, with a giant handi cooking two kinds of khichuri. ?Eighty kg of rice for khichuri, 20 kg for paromanno?? one of the four cooks reads out the list to take to the market. All in the name of food for the gods, no less.

 Lahabari

 The present generation may know it as the address where actor Sanjay Dutt discovered himself as a dhunuchi dancer during the puja sequence in Parineeta, but the Lahas at the Pasteur Laboratories building have been worshipping their deities for decades. ?The present chariot dates back to 1948. My grandmother Radharani Debi ordered the construction of the 10-feet structure,? explains Debanko Churn Law, the second of three brothers. Before that, a modest four-foot rath was in use.

 ?My fondest rathajatra memory is of touring the streets, perched at the base of the structure. It is the same with children of this generation,? the 61-year-old smiles. Brother Mriganko and nephew Subhendu nod in agreement. 

 The route of the chariot is fixed ? Bidhan Sarani, Vivekananda Road, Keshab Sen Street and back home. ?It is a tough job keeping the structure on course. Earlier, passersby were so enthusiastic about pulling the chariot that men had to be deployed to hold it back to maintain the right speed. Now volunteers are fewer in number. Yet muscle power is still needed to dig the wheels out of potholes. Another task is to make it turn left or right.? Once, he recalls, the chariot broke a wheel in course of the journey. ?Since then, we have added four more wheels as a precaution.? The weight is considerable, with two Brahmins fanning the Lord and many others climbing on.? Groups chanting hymns follow the rath along with the male family members walking barefoot. 

 The three brothers have another task. Once arati is done and bhog offered in the prayer room, they carry the idol downstairs for installation, sweeping and sprinkling holy water on the path ahead. The Lord then puts on his crown, necklaces and arms of gold to carry a lotus and a chakra in each. ?The first pull of the rope in the garden is reserved for us as we do not step out on the streets,? says Mamata, Debanko?s wife. 

 Dawbari

 Rathajatra is doubly auspicious for the Daws of Vivekananda Road. On the occasion, the kathamo, or the wooden structure supporting the Durga idol, is also worshipped. ?The kathamo is made of garan wood from the Sunderbans,? says Samarendra Krishna Daw, the eldest of the family of gun-makers. Even till the 1960s, garan was readily available and cost around Rs 45 a log. ?Now they refuse to take a paisa less than Rs 350. Even then supply is a headache. We use bamboo slices for the other four deities,? he adds. After this ritual, work can start on making the idol, on the thakurdalan itself.

 A fruit of the season has to be offered to the Lord. ?It is jackfruit in our family. We are not allowed to taste the fruit beforehand,? explains brother Kumarkrishna. Sweets, money and a sacred thread complete the plate of offerings. 

 The chariot does not tour the streets anymore. ?We have only heard of the days when it went out, accompanied by armed guards in uniform bearing the name of our ancestor N.C. Daw.? With income from the debuttar estate dwindling, such pomp is a thing of the past. ?Still, we try our best to observe all customs,? 74-year-old Samarendra states.

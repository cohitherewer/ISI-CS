 The concept of community colleges is very popular in the West, particularly in the US. In India, a community education system is emerging. On April 6, the American Center organised a panel discussion and digital teleconference on the issue. 

 It was part of a USIS effort at education tie-ups between East and West, initiated by Bhaskar Rajah, director of cultural programmes. Introducing the topic, Rajah pointed out that Indians form the second largest community among academic faculty in the US, while Chinese are the largest community of students. The panelists for the discussion were Shyamal Sanyal, pro-vice chancellor, JU, Ratneswar Bhattacharya of Kalyani University, Dikshit Sinha of Visva-Bharati and Kalyan Dutt of JU.

 Sanyal stressed on the importance of spreading community college education in rural India, where technical education is vital for the uplift of society and the economy. Sinha started from where Sanyal stopped, emphasising Tagore?s idea of popularising community education in villages near Visva Bharati, in Santiniketan, still in practise. 

 Bhattacharya presented exhaustive statistics on the sad literacy rate in India and inadequate community education programmes due to reluctance on the part of colleges and universities. Hence the slogan ?education for all seems dreams too good to be true?. 

 The discussion was followed by a teleconference with Robert G. Templin in the US, who had paid a visit to south India to see the community college system. Some teachers and social workers in the audience asked for his suggestions. He hoped that some kind of a collaborative programme of community college education would be thought out soon by those at the helm of affairs in both countries. He further hoped that in India, vocational courses would no longer be relegated to the back seat.

Songs of praise

 The South Carolina Singing Men flew all the way from the US to India to perform for music-lovers this month. Before Calcutta, they performed in Bangalore. St Paul?s Cathedral was the venue here. The event was supported by Calcutta School of Music. They also performed at Carey Baptist Church and Assembly of God Church. 

 The programme started with an instrumental ensemble. There was a lot of variation in the moods of the different movements. The second movement of the piece was sombre and grave, with technical precision and attention to musical effects. The third movement was, what we commonly call today, When the saints go marching in.

 Next were the more religious songs. One thing that has to be remembered in choral singing, especially church music, is that harmony plays a major role. A lot of balance in the voice is required. If one voci blends with another, the effect of the piece is lost. Characteristic of early church music is harmony. In later years, the range of singing became higher and higher. So, without proper balance and thorough control of the voice, it is virtually impossible to sing these songs to perfection. 

 The South Carolina Singing Men sang Alleluia and Holy, holy, holy, after which was the Latin Cantate domino (O sing ye to the lord) and Cantique de Jean Racine, an extraordinary composition by Gabriel Faure accompanied by keyboard and violin. Then came the long-awaited Mozart?s Gloria in Excelsis, with a blend of everything, from modulations to harmony. 

 When I survey the wondrous cross relives the pain and suffering that Jesus Christ underwent before he was crucified. Praise you for the cross was beautiful, too. The entertaining Southern Gospel ensemble He made a way was up next. In the US, the Southern Gospel is very popular. 

 After I hear a voice a-praying was an amazing song called Dry bones. It started off with strong tenors occasionally lending a modern sway to the song. Eventually, clattering and hammering of various contraptions with brilliant coordination and technique portrayed the song of bones. 

 That?s why we praise Him was followed by a handbell ensemble, something very uncommon in this city. Brightly polished English handbells are rotated forward with stretched arms in order to produce a very distinct sound, different from Swiss handbells. After a wonderful depiction of the song How great thou art was a moving performance of Amazing grace, accompanied by the violin and handbells. There was more, including the Accapella ensemble He will carry you, and Midnight cry. The show ended with The lord bless you and keep you. 

 The performance was a grand display of choral music, bringing in all the shades of music with different emotions and sentiments. After the programme, I had a chat with one of the singers, Edgar Horton, who said he was very happy to perform in Calcutta and happy to see young people like me attending the concert. ?The city is extraordinary in all dimensions, and I love it,? he smiled.

 Perfect poet

 How should I put forward this article? As a budding poet meeting a great one? An interview of the famous given to a struggling reporter? As a conversation between two writers? Javed Akhtar ? no introduction needed. Me ? no introduction as such. Except that I was lucky enough to chat with Javed saab. 

 He was a guest at Crossword?s first birthday. I confess, I was not prepared to take an interview. I just knew I had to try. The man is the epitome of earthy dignity, to say the least. He agreed to give me an interview in his car on the way back to the hotel. An everlasting smile to accessorise his crispy cool khadi-hued kurta pyjama, he spoke slowly and deliberately ? a man who has life?s experience in his peaceful eyes and fresh hope in the power of words.

 A car full of screaming girls nearly caught up with our vehicle. (Wasn?t that reserved for Bollywood heroes? You get an idea of his popularity!) Never does he show any condescension towards his juniors ? in fame or age. His thoughts ? 

 ...On movies: ?The audience doesn?t want good stories. It wants everything! The director doesn?t go hunting for just a good story. He goes with a shopping list that includes action, comedy, sensuality, etc. In the end, he just wants hangers to hang all these things from, which the public wants to see. Pyaasa, Mother India, Mughal-e-Azam? They had great stories. But they were not everything. It?s very tough to have a movie that includes most aspects but also remains sensible. Maine Pyar Kiya, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Lagaan ? these could be termed so. When I wrote scripts, I used to be greatly involved. I shared a wonderful relationship with directors like Ramesh Sippy. I used to take part in deciding the cast, locations, look of the films, even the minor roles. But now as a songwriter, I think of the situation of the song basically. And about the characters, their emotional state, expressions??

 ...On son Farhan: ?It is his privilege to ask for my suggestions. I don?t impose my unsought opinions on him. We don?t have a generation gap. It is the difference in personality two human beings would have. We have the exact same sense of decency and decorum. But I?m dramatic, he?s subtle.?

 ...On wife Shabana Azmi: ?What we have is a win-win relationship. It?s very meaningful. But it?s not that we never fight. We are basically friends with mutual love and respect for each other?s talents, minds??

 (Here, I got a strict few words, but with a mischievous smile, about not being prepared with information about his book. I apologised with a sheepish grin and confessed my ignorance.)

 ...On future ideas: ?I want to write a collection of articles on different topics that are important to me; some 12-15 articles. I have written a script. There is always this toying with ideas of directing or producing. But I?ll probably give it to a good director.?

 As he signs his name for me, he leaves my last question (an attempt to appear smart) unanswered: are his thoughts in verse? Does he think in poetry...?

Helping hands

 Swaraj Mukherjee is very sweet and loving. He is a year-and-a-half old, very lively and mischievious. But Swaraj is struggling to survive, fighting a complicated heart ailment that requires surgery. His father, Saradindu Mukherjee, cannot bear the entire expense of his son?s operation. 

 Mukherjee, a former Indian cricketer, received many a helping hand from fellow Bengalplayers like Deep Dasgupta, Nikhil Haldipur, Sambaran Banerjee and other generous souls. Besides, an organisation managed by students came forward for Swaraj. 

 Telipara Chhatra Kalyan Samity, a group of youth, organised a cultural evening at Nazrul Manch on March 29 to raise funds for Swaraj. Singer Indrani Sen kicked off the evening. Next was Rupankar, who said: ?Swaraj won?t understand my songs at this age. But I pray that my songs save his life.?

 To end the evening was Bangla band Cactus, with Phirbey na. Lead singer Shidhuda signed off with: ?I hope Swaraj will definitely come back (phire ashbe).? 

 It was wonderful to see all the artistes performing in aid of the toddler. There were a few hiccups, but the initiative was well worth the effort. All the best to Swaraj.

 Unequal economy

 The speaker at this year?s Arijit Mukherjee Annual Memorial Lecture at IIM-C, was Prof Debraj Ray, Julius Silver professor of economics and director of graduate studies at New York University and centennial professor at London School of Economics. He delivered the second memorial lecture on ?Market versus luck: thinking about evolution of inequality?. 

 Prof Ray proposed an altogether different view on evolution of inequality. He suggested that inequality of wealth is generated by historically given occupational structures and not exclusively by the market. He argued that inequalities would grow more in faster growing economies. Globalisation, in this context, bringing to the market a wide range of products, services and occupations, is a great contributor in creating inequality. Small policy interventions at this juncture, he said, could bring in desired safeguards. 

 The lecture instituted by Mr and Mrs P. Mukherjee, parents of late Prof Arijit Mukherjee, is presented annually, alternating between Carlson School of Management, Minneapolis, and IIM-C. Dean Denis Albert from Carlson School of Management came to Calcutta for the occasion and honoured the Mukherjees with mementos of appreciation from his institution. 

 Prof Arijit Mukherjee, born in Calcutta in 1962, was widely recognised as a leader in experimental economics. He also did extensive work on financial disclosure, auditing and design incentives in organisations. With his untimely death in October 2000, his friends, colleagues and students lost an inspirational figure. His legacy of research and influential thinking is honoured and continued through efforts like the memorial lecture.

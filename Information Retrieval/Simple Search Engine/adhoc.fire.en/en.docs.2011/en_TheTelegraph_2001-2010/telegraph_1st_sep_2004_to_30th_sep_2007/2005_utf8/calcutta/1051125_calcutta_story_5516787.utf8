 A fateful wedding

 Offering an insight into the bigotry, superstition and prejudice that prevailed in 19th century Bengal, Antarjali Yatra is a strong indictment of a social system that practised grave injustices on women in the name of religion. Featured in EZCC?s monthly theatre show, the play, written by Kamal Kumar Mazumdar, also brings to the fore the hypocrisy and false piety of the upper castes. Compelled to adhere to the strict norms of Hindu koulinya protha (customs for upper castes), or else be socially ostracised, Lakshminarayan marries off his beautiful, young daughter, Jashobati, to an old, dying man. As the wedding rituals are carried out at the burning ghat where the groom lies on his deathbed, none protests the cruel fate that she is being forced to accept. When the farcical ceremony is over, the newly-wed bride waits all by herself for her husband to die. Only Baijunath, a low-caste dom, expresses any feelings of compassion or humanity for her. Direction: Ashis Chattopadhyay.

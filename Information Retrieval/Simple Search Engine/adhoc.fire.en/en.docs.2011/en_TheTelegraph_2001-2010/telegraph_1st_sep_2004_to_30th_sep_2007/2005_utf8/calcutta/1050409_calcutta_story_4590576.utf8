 At a time when the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is discouraging strikes and bandhs in industrial units and offices and initiating measures to improve work culture in Bengal, his party activists have been holding an indefinite ceasework at the Shibpur Botanical Gardens since Monday, to realise some of their slew of demands.

 In the past two decades, the garden had not witnessed any agitation by employees and the work atmosphere had been quite good. 

 But the situation took a turn for the worse last Monday when the CPM-controlled Botanical Survey of India Employees Association launched a ceasework for an indefinite period and sat on a dharna at the office of joint director G.S. Giri to press their demands.

 Realising that the agitation will continue, the garden authorities have pressed the panic button at their headquarters in Delhi and sent a report on the ongoing agitation, sources said on Friday.

 About 500 malis (gardeners), mazdoors, garden overseers and supervisors, all of whom are active members of the CPM-controlled association, put up posters in Giri?s office and shouted slogans continuously against the garden authorities. The latter have recently introduced a new work schedule for employees.

 Work at the garden came to a standstill following the employees? agitation. Employees associations owing allegiance to the Congress and the Trinamul Congress joined hands with the CPM union to organise the indefinite agitation. 

 Watering of trees, especially in the nurseries, has stopped since Monday. Baren Ghosh, secretary-general of the CPM-controlled association, said on Friday that the authorities had recently introduced a new schedule for the employees, asking them to report at the garden at 6 am on every working day. 

 ?Earlier, the gardeners and other employees used to report for duty at 10 am. This practice has been followed since 1979. It is not possible for us to accept the new schedule,? Ghosh said.

 He said the employees have demanded introduction of shift duties for the gardeners and others who are directly involved in overseeing the garden and the plants. ?But the authorities are not ready to concede our demand and are forcing us to accept the new schedule,? Ghosh complained.

 Joint director Giri, who is in charge of the garden, could not go to work on Friday because of the agitation. ?I will not tell you anything about what is happening at the garden. We are working hard to improve the work culture there,? was all he proffered.

 Botanical Survey of India officials said a number of projects had been take up to beautify the garden and these will be hampered by the agitation. 

 A few years ago, the authorities had banned picnics inside the garden. They are now constructing two pavilions to be rented out to visitors who want to spend the day there.

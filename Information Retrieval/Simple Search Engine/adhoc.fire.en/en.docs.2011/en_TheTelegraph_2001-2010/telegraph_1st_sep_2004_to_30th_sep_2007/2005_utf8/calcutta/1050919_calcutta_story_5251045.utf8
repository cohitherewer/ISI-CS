 Tree census for green cover policy 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Faced with the task of monitoring tree-felling, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to embark on a census of Calcutta?s green cover. 

 The exercise, officials hope, will help the government enforce felling norms better.

 ?We want to know what the city?s exact green cover is. The census will also help us ascertain the foliage density ? number of trees in every square kilometre ? and make effective plans for management of greenery,? a senior official of the forest department said on Sunday.

 The decision to undertake the census, to be conducted jointly by the forest and environment departments, was taken at a meeting at Writers? Buildings last week. 

 Chaired by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, the meeting was attended by forest secretary Ashok Patnaik, environment secretary Asim Barman, urban development secretary Nandita Chatterjee, project director of Calcutta Environment Improvement Project Rajeev Sinha and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 Officials said that apart from counting trees, the census will include preparations for framing a ?comprehensive policy? for preserving the city?s green cover in the next 10 years.

 An official said: ?Afforestation drives will be undertaken in areas that have a large number of old trees. Besides, ornamental trees will be planted in vacant plots.?

 According to sources, what prompted the officials to decide on measures to conserve Calcutta?s biodiversity was a communique from the chief minister?s secretariat. 

 Chief minister Bhattacharjee, himself a nature enthusiast, has reportedly expressed anxiety over rampant felling of trees.

 The government has also decided to set up nature interpretation centres at Millennium Park and Rabindra Sarobar. The centres will exhibit models, posters and photographs of trees.

 One such centre, on the Sunderbans, is coming up at Aranya Bhavan, in Salt Lake.

 The forest department has also suggested creation of ?nature trails? for children at Rabindra Sarobar, Banabitan (Salt Lake) and Subhas Sarobar. ?The idea is to educate children about flora and fauna, going beyond textbooks. They should explore the biodiversity around them on their own,? an official said.

 Transfers trigger hospital tumult 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Work in almost all the departments at NRS Medical College and Hospital was disrupted for over two hours on Friday morning, when the principal was gheraoed twice over transfers without replacement.

 Around 10.30 am, 70-odd senior doctors turned up at the office of principal Purnima Sau Mondal and demanded that the authorities look into the problem. Around 12.15 pm, a group of junior doctors joined the protest.

 Thereafter, it was the turn of the students ? around 150 of them, all supporters of the SFI, gathered outside the principal?s office and protested the transfers, particularly that of Maitreyee Banerjee, an assistant professor with the haematology department.

 Mondal could not offer an assurance. Her statement that the matter would be reviewed on Monday prompted the senior doctors, including assistant professors, to decide on a ?pen-down strike? for an hour, starting 11 am, at the outdoors on that day.

 This is the first time in recent years that senior doctors are resorting to a token protest on the hospital premises.

 As the authorities were clueless about the snap demonstration, admission of patients was greatly affected. 

 Queues at the outdoors, too, kept lengthening. In the absence of the junior doctors, nurses had to run the show in some departments. 

 Defending the protest over the transfers, head of the surgery department Manas Gumta said: ?There was no other option. At least 25 teachers, including six heads of departments, have been transferred in the past six months. Not a single vacancy has been filled.?

 Gumta, also secretary of the NRS unit of the Association of Health Service Doctors, added that the doctors had tried to explain the situation to the health secretary and other officials, but in vain. ?With so many patients, the system is collapsing.? 

 The authorities, caught on the wrong foot, are now groping for alternatives. 

 ?Monday, being the first working day of a week, records the maximum number of patients at the outdoors. You can imagine what an hour?s strike means in this situation. We have no idea how to handle it,? said acting superintendent Dilip Kumar Jha.

 The students, on their part, will decide after Monday how to continue with their agitation. ?We are at the receiving end of this transfer policy,? said Chiranjib Nag, joint secretary of SFI?s NRS unit.

 Township pips city to cable count

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 What the government could barely get started in eight months, some private players ? in a bid to ?streamline and regulate? the chaotic cable industry ? have managed in two.

 A sample survey reveals the number of cable and satellite homes in Sector I, II and III in Salt Lake City to be 20,663. The survey, conducted by market research agency ORG-MARG, was completed in October 2004, around the time the state government announced a cable count for the entire CMDA area ?within 90 days?.

 According to the survey, the total number of households with television sets in the three sectors is 23,208, of which 89 per cent have a cable and satellite connection.

 ?There are some 12,800 plots with around 20 per cent yet to have houses built on them,? explains Rana Das, managing director of Link-men Services, which caters to nearly 90 per cent of the homes covered by the survey. ?Besides, there are 87 housing estates with around 11,000 flats in them,? Das adds.

 Of the 20,663 cable homes, only two per cent (455) have two or more connections, while the average monthly rate paid by all households is Rs 199.

 ?The moment there is word about a survey, operators get scared,? says Das. ?We wanted to bring in a level of transparency and volunteered to have the survey done in our area.?

 But why wait so long to make the results public? ?We were waiting for the state government to complete its survey. In fact, when details of connections and operators were sought some time back, we submitted copies of our survey findings to the SDPO and the local police stations.?

 The government-backed survey, however, has turned out to be stillborn. The survey was proposed in October 2004 at a meeting chaired by Arun Bhattacharya, principal secretary to the chief minister, with a deadline of January 2005, that has subsequently been pushed back several times.

 Link-men claims to have conducted a similar cable survey in Salt Lake, internally, in 2002 which had produced similar results.

 The cost of the Rs 4-lakh ORG Marg-survey was borne by Indian Cable Net (then RPG Netcom), the multi-system operator recently taken over by Zee group?s SitiCable, which provides feed to the 100-operator-strong Link-men.

 The Salt Lake survey, however, leaves out Sectors IV and V, as well as the non-residential buildings in the three other sectors. Some market analysts are sceptical of a survey for Salt Lake throwing up such low figures. ?The actual figure could be higher and the survey may have been conveniently commissioned within only a part of Salt Lake,? says a trade veteran.

 But no one disputes the fact that it?s a significant start for an industry badly in need of a way out of the cable chaos. And that the government can learn a vital lesson from this.

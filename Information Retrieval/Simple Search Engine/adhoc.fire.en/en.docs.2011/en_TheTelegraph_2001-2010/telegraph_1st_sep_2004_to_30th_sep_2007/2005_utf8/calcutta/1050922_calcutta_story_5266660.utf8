 The supermarket success has invaded south Calcutta. After Elgin Road and Salt Lake, C3 mdash; The Market Place opened the doors to its third and biggest store, in Gariahaat Mall, on Wednesday. With more than 10,000 products, a vast array of cold cuts and a Kookie Jar caf eacute;, the 12,800 sq ft supermarket is all set to be the market hub.

 ldquo;This is the biggest C3 store in the city. We have a huge market here. We are looking at a pool of 2,00,000 people. Moreover, several thousands commute via this connector. Nowhere in Calcutta would we find such dense footfalls. To cater to such a big market, we required a bigger format, rdquo; says Rohan Ghosh of C3. 

 The ldquo;upwardly-mobile Bengalis rdquo; living on the fringes of the city figure prominently on the target list. 

 Besides homecare products, cosmetics, toiletries, provisions, ready-to-eats, snacks and chocolates, several experiments are also lined up.

 C3 is ready to make a big impact. More than 20,000 pamphlets have been printed in Bengali and circulated in the adjoining areas. The leaflets contain directions to the store and the product mix on the racks, ldquo;to encourage even domestic helps to step in and pick up provisions rdquo;.

 There are also racks exclusively stocking pet food and health food. ldquo;The pet food segment is not organised, but people often walk into our other stores and inquire about food, soaps, brushes and shampoos for their pets. So we decided to dedicate a rack to this segment, rdquo; explains Ghosh. 

 The health food section will have zero-calorie snacks, diabetic potatoes, jams and organic food. 

 Another addition will be the home puja ingredients segment, with small idols, flowers, candles, incense sticks and more.

 ldquo;Our main clientele here would be Bengalis, so we are trying to squeeze in everything of their preference, including sweets and non-vegetarian items. The idea is to pitch C3 as a friendly neighbourhood store, rdquo; adds Ghosh. 

 In the offing are a pharmacy and low-alcohol beverages.

 As a value-added service, there will be home delivery in the locality. The store timing is 9 am to 9 pm, but it will stay open longer as footfalls increase. Skilled personnel and right rack arrangements will make the shopping experience more comfortable, assured Ghosh, in keeping with the C3 promise of comfort, cost and convenience.

 Festive buys

 Looking your best and standing out in a crowd is an essential part of the Pujas. Helping the ladies do just that is the boutique Soumyas Creation at 57/9, Ballygunge Circular Road, with an exhibition of costume jewellery and garments.

 Apart from in-house designs are items from Self Help Handicrafts Society and three groups of dokra, Madhubani and vegetable-dye artisans.

 The jewellery includes handcrafted neckpieces and earrings in thewa (gold work on glass), jadau, kundan and filigree, priced between Rs 600 and Rs 2,000. Expensive but exclusive are the Victorian designs with an antique finish, at Rs 1,500.

 For the young and fashionable there is trendy jewellery, hand-knotted with silk threads and enhanced with beads and semi-precious stones, moderately price at Rs 200-250. Elegant bangles in gold adorned with semi-precious stones like uncut emeralds and rubies are available upwards of Rs 900.

 Says proprietor Sudatta Chakraborty: For the Pujas, we have some very exclusive stuff at moderate prices, to reach out to a wider clientele.

 In the sartorial section, there are cotton tops in bright colours and vegetable-dyed T-shirts. But the stoles, made by women weavers of Fulia, steal the show.

 The crushed variety can be picked up for Rs 600, while the plain ones with a silk finish are priced at Rs 300. To go with the clothes are silk batuas at around Rs 250.

 Cotton cushion covers in soft tones, dokra artefacts and Madhubani paintings are also on offer at Soumyas. The exhibition is on till September 26, from 10.30 am to 7.30 pm.

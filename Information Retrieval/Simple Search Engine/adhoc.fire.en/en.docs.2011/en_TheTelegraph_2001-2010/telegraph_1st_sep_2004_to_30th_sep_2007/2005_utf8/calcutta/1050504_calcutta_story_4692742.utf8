 Residents stranded in house collapse

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Even as a portion of their residence crumbled to the ground, they clung to their belongings and refused to be rescued, fearing the loss of the only place they know as home. The authorities shrugged responsibility and claimed there was nothing they could do.

 Sixteen people, mostly women and children, remained stranded on the second floor of an old three-storeyed building at the intersection of BB Ganguly Street and Nirmal Chandra Street till late on Tuesday night, after a first-floor balcony collapsed, along with the only staircase, around 1.30 pm.

 ?We have arrested the owner of the building on the charge of negligence in taking care of the property and endangering the public,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 The fire department rushed two engines to the spot. Fire fighters rescued about 30 people from the building, that houses offices as well as residences.

 ?Four families resided on the second floor, and more people lived on the terrace. Most of the male members were rescued, but the women refused to come down,? an officer of Muchipara police station said. 

 According to him, the residents who refused to be rescued had expressed the hope that the owner of the building would make alternative arrangements for them.

 The house-owner, however, refused to accept responsibility, claiming that the rent he received was too meagre.

 ?We had spoken to officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation regarding construction of a makeshift staircase to bring down the stranded people. But they said it was not their responsibility,? the Muchipara police station officer added.

 Local Trinamul Congress councillor Amiya Mukherjee also denied any responsibility in relocating the residents.

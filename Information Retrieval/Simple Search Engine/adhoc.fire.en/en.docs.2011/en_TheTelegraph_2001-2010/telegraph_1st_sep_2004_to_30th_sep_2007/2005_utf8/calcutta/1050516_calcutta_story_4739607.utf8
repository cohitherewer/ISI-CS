 Attitude: dishing out dream decor

 IPSITA DEB

 The chic facade in crimson with the word Attitude scribbled on it couldnt have escaped your attention if you have passed through Loudon Street of late. And if you decided to check it out, the stark red interior of the plush store would surely have bowled you over.

 Lifestyle furniture store Attitude upped its shutters in the city in end-April, promising a revolution in designer home interiors. Set up in collaboration with Denmarks Tvilum Scanburk, the worlds largest manufacturer of furniture, the store offers a sleek range of imported home furniture.

 The 2,500-sq-ft studio houses a wide range of ready-to-assemble furniture, displayed in complete sets to recreate a homely ambience. For instance, a dining table set is complete with the right accessories including a napkin holder with napkins and the sofa sets are accompanied by a dummy television. While a computer table shows you how it would look when actually in use with a computer and other add-ons, the cabinets are adorned with knick knacks.

 Inside story

 Today, people have become style conscious about everything in life and that is reflected in home interiors as well. These days, one doesnt buy furniture for functional purposes only. A lot of thinking regarding stylisation goes into it, says Gaurav Goenka, CEO, Attitude.

 Careful planning is required before choosing your look. Nowadays, like fashion, we have trends in furniture too. For instance, the exotic African designs are a rage globally right now, adds Goenka.

 What adds value to the shopping experience at Attitude is the stores Room Planner service that helps people to make the most of their interiors. This section on the website www.attitude.in lays out the perfect plan for a room when you feed in its measurements.

 Furniture front

 Be it coffee tables, computer tables, dining room sets, wooden cabinets, beds with bedside tables, fancy chairs, plush sofas, shoe racks or even automatic dustbins, the store leaves nothing out in the furniture field. 

 These come in a variety of shapes and sizes. So if a circular table on display isnt exactly what you had in mind, there are plenty of options to choose from in the stores masterbook, which houses the different designs available in each item. For example, chests may be of the Trio, Escape, Cubic, Next, Naia and Sway varieties. 

 Wood as the base with steel and silver trimmings gives each piece a simple, yet elegant feel. On the home accessories front, theres a wide array of lampshades, mostly in white at the moment, with a promise of more to come. 

 Space Saving

 Space-saving furniture, which capitalises on one of the most neglected spots in the house ? the corners ? is the strongest trend globally, reveals Goenka. Attitude caters to this need of modern homes with most of its designs being space-friendly. For instance, a dining table whose glass cover appears to be suited to seat four can actually be pulled out from underneath and converted into a six-seater. Similarly, a rather flat and sleek three-ft tall cabinet actually hides a wrought iron shoe rack that can store as many as 24 pairs of shoes.

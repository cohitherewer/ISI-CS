The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 A dash of slash

On the eve of Flipsydes India tour, 

Subhajit Banerjee catches up with vocalist Piper

 Oaklands own Flipsyde is a hot new hip-hop act that is impressing both charts and critics alike.

Piper on vocals, Steve Knight on vocals and guitar, 

Dave Lopez on guitar and D-Sharp on the turntable formed an unusual quartet (in 

picture left) in 2003 to create some unusual music. 

 Their breakthrough single Someday has been chosen as the theme for the Winter Olympics, and the debut album We the People, released in July, is topping charts in several countries.

 As a part of international music channel VH1s Hip Hop Hustle, Flipsyde is touring India this week. Yet again, Calcutta is not on the list ? the band plays in Mumbai on November 23 and Delhi on November 26 ? but GoodLife caught up with Flipsydes Piper over phone, on Friday.

 Where are you right now?

 Im walking down a street in San Francisco. Weve just done our soundcheck and will take the stage in a while?

 Why is the band called Flipsyde?

 We believe there are two parts to every story. And also because we, the band members, represent so many different things.

 Your music has been described variously; how would you describe it?

 I call it slash music, hip-hop slash, rock slash? Its hip-hop music combined with elements of rock.

 Your album is called We the People and you also wrote a song called US History. How involved is Flipsyde in the politics of the time?

 Were not politicians, experts or international relation students. But like many people in the Bay Area, we pay attention to politics. When were on stage, people feel were singing for them? were rapping for them. 

 Thats where the album title comes from. As for the track US History, I wrote that song to explain the US Constitution to young boys in juvenile prisons who didnt know how to read.

 Which artistes, particularly among contemporaries, inspire and influence your music?

 Each of us has very different influences. As for me, I love Brazilian music, Motown and artistes like Ray Charles, Tupac, Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg?

 What about Eminem, with whom you were scheduled to perform?

 Hes great. Unfortunately, he fell ill and we could not share the stage during the Anger Management tour. Black Eyed Peas, with whom we have toured and would be touring again soon, are also wonderful.

 Your song Someday is a hit and has also been chosen as the theme song for the Winter Olympics. How does it feel?

 It feels beautiful, man? magnificent. The song and the album is charting everywhere ? Germany, UK? But we are just here to play the music and thats whats important.

 You play in India next. What is your image of the country? Have any of you been here before?

 This would be our first trip. I expect to hear good music, eat great food and meet some beautiful women. As for the image, you hear all kinds of stories. 

 Recently, there were bombs in a marketplace and a train wreck, both of which claimed a lot of lives. 

 But often were not exposed to the positives of a country, so I would want to reach there and formulate my own opinion.

 Why are you playing at just two venues?

 I have no idea. If it was up to me, Id love to play everyday that were there. But it may be because of the logistics.

 What projects are you working on?

 Weve just recorded an underground mix tape with 23 songs. Its all over the Internet. Were also touring Europe next month.

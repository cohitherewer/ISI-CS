The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ad freeze to save the eye

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The war against visual pollution has found its prime target: the billboard.

 The civic authorities are drawing up a code to limit the number of billboards dotting the city?s eyeline. ?Calcutta needs a set of regulations to get rid of the billboard jungles,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said on Monday.

 He has asked municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to take steps to pull down illegal billboards, as well as those blocking the view of buildings with historical significance.

 ?We have prepared a list of billboards in BBD Bag that are to be pulled down for the sake of preserving the area?s aesthetic beauty and honouring its history,? said Bandyopadhyay. ?We?ll forego part of our income to preserve heritage.?

 The civic body will also seek the government?s help in the mission, as several billboards in the BBD Bag area are on plots owned by the public works department.

 According to mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, some pockets will be declared no-billboard zones. ?The rest of the city will be divided into areas and we will set down the maximum number of billboards that can be erected in each,? he added.

 Khan blamed slack surveillance by the civic authorities for the abnormal rise in visual pollution. The walls and skyline of the city are now almost entirely covered with gaudily-painted billboards of food, furniture, innerwear, cement, iron and steel and shoes.

 Nearly two years ago, the civic authorities had imposed restrictions on the erection of billboards and limited their size to 200 sq ft in the city proper. 

 ?Ignoring rules, various companies and agencies have put up oversized billboards in the past five years,? said mayoral council member Khan. 

 Even psychologists feel crude billboards have an unsettling effect on viewers. ?The problem is definitely acute in Calcutta,? said psychoanalyst Ujjainee Roy. ?In most cases, the billboards do not serve their purpose. Whenever you are confronted with a billboard or graffiti jungle, you tend to turn your head away,? she pointed out.

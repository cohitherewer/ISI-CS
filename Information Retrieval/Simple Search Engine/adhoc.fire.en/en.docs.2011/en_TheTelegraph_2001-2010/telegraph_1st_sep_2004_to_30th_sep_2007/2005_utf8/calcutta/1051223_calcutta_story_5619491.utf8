 Hang out your stockings this Christmas Eve, as chances are that good ol Santa might actually be delivering goodies at your doorstep. This childhood dream could actually come true, thanks to an innovative venture by the Caf? Coffee Day chain.

 As part of this special scheme, customers can walk into any Caf? Coffee Day (CCD) outlet, pick from a variety of trendy gifts and order them along with personalised messages for their loved ones. The gift will be delivered by Santa Claus, who will move about town in a special Christmas van on December 24.

 The range of gifts includes Christmas cakes like Chocolate Fantasy, Black Forest, Butter Scotch and Passion Fruit Pastry, all priced between Rs 160 and Rs 175, gift hampers with Fruit Cake, Chocolate Cake and Nutty Crunch priced between Rs 210 and Rs 260, Oxford Bookstore gift certificates worth Rs 250 and Nik Nish gift vouchers worth Rs 100.

 Says Riddhi Dave of CCD: Calcutta is a very special city for us. This scheme is our little way of thanking our customers.

 Recipe roster

 Recipes straight from the cooking pot of a master chef who has worked in the kitchens of London, New York to Oman? Thats the fare that makes up Sitangshu Chakravartys debut book Best of India ? The Choicest Regional Recipes. The book by the globe-trotting chef was launched at Oxford Bookstore.

 Though I dont believe there is anything called Indian cooking, the aim is to popularise regional Indian recipes across the globe, said Sitangshu.

 Some of the recipes in the book include Karela Gosht and Chukandar Gosht from Uttar Pradesh, Shakkar Ka Murg from Maharashtra, Ande ka Halwa from Madhya Pradesh, Methi Pakori Curry from Delhi, Adai Cutlets from Tamil Nadu and much more.

 The dishes I have put down might have fancy names, but the ingredients are very simple. I believe cooking should be an easy process, said Sitangshu.

 Present at the launch, which saw the demonstration of some recipes, were musician Nondon Bagchi, Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies and Rita Bhimani.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Security in scurry for Young Turks

 KINSUK BASU

 Call it a knee-jerk reaction to Tube blasts far away or a cautious step to bolster security, the city police have decided to recast the team covering all vital installations and induct young faces, fit and agile enough to react fast.

 The move comes after the special branch (SB) decided to take a hard look at the officers presently deployed to cover the vital installations ? including Metro Railway ? and found that some of them had poor eyesight and were not fit enough to deliver during emergency.

 The officers were mostly a disgruntled lot and had low self-esteem, believing they have been ?dumped? by being posted in the special branch.

 ?We have taken a few steps, including bringing in certain replacements, who will be able to react fast. The changes, obviously, can?t be shared with the public,? said Pradip Kumar Chattopadhayay, deputy commissioner of police, special branch.

 The new team, according to insiders, will comprise mostly young officers, who have recently been transferred to the branch from various police stations, as well as the detective department, and have a relatively high level of physical fitness.

 The officers will coordinate with the Metro Railway Police and help frame a more effective policy on ?day-to-day? security at the stations and pre-empt any attack, including sabotages, on the premises.

 The bomb disposal squad, too, is being revamped. A group of seven young officers will be sent for specialised training in explosives under the National Security Guards in Maneswar. Another team is being trained by the army in Kanchrapara, North 24-Parganas.

 ?Unlike in London, serial blasts are not something unheard of here. We just can?t afford to lag behind in security,? said joint commissioner (armed police) Zulfikar Hassan, explaining the need for the specialised training.

 Possibly in keeping with the demands of time, the city police have already acquired a robot from Germany to handle any emergency arising out of explosives. 

 Named RMI-9 (Remote Mobile Investigator), the Rs-40 lakh robot can handle complex situations. It can destroy an explosive device using water jet or walk down a flight of stairs to pick up a bomb. The robot has a monitor fitted to it, which helps officers direct it from a distance.

 ?We are geared up to take on Osama if he decides on Calcutta the next time and this is not just a passing statement. We are into very serious business. We have some of the latest gadgets to handle explosives,? says a senior officer of the bomb disposal squad.

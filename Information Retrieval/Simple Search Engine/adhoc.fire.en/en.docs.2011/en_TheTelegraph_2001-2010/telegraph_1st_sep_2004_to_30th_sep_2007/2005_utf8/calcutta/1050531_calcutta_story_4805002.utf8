 Mouthful of Mediterranean magic

 gastronomic variety Italian cuisine has to offer

 Italian cuisine has caught on in Calcutta. However, we are comfortable mainly with pizzas, pastas and a few baked items like the classic lasagne. And this is just the tip of the iceberg; a tiny scratch on the surface, in the same way as thinking about Indian food as Chicken Tikka Masala and Tandoori Chicken would be. 

 A memorable experience was a lazy Sunday lunch at an Italian restaurant by the river Thames, in the most perfect weather, courtesy of a much-travelled friend and culinary aesthete. 

 Apart from the fine wine and a delicious selection of cheese and bread, the item to remember was Pigeon Spatchcock which is grilling the pigeon after splitting it open from the back, spreading it out, flattening it and fixing it with skewers to keep it flat. It is then rubbed with lime and kept for several hours in a marinade of olive oil, chopped parsley, onion, ginger paste and lots of salt and pepper before being grilled, preferably over a charcoal fire. The accompaniment was Watercress Salad.

 There were also some very inviting fish, seafood, veal and lamb items, but alas, ones appetite is a finite thing. 

 The meal was completed ? dessert, and coffee ? but not a shred of pasta anywhere. 

 An eye-opener for me, and a few weeks later, I unearthed a book from any mothers trove of treasures, published in 1953, written by Robin Howe, on Italian cooking. 

 In his introduction, he has this to say: Italian cooking is Mediterranean cooking at its best. It offers colour, variety and gastronomic adventure? Those who judge Italian cooking lightly claim that it is all spaghetti, garlic, olive oil and tomatoes. Certainly these basic ingredients are vital to Italian cooking but they are by no means the only materials used and whether they are flavourings or backgrounds, they can be used in many different ways? 

 The book has an amazing variety of recipes and apart from starters, soups, pastas and risottos (rice dishes made by boiling rice in stock) and the regular meats, there are recipes for pheasant, quail, turkey, pigeon, about 15 different kinds of fish, rabbit, hare, wild duck, fieldfare (birds like thrushes, snipe, blackbirds and sparrows), eel and frogs legs! 

 But to get back to the present. Reconnecting recently with Rikki Dewan, pioneer of home-delivered pizza in Calcutta (he set up Don Giovannis about seven or eight years ago), I was pleased to find out that he opened a new 120-seater place called China Bistro at 119A M.A. Ahmed Road (Ripon Street), serving Italian and Chinese food.

 The Italian menu is good. It is not all that adventurous, but it is well thought out with a comprehensive selection of soups, starters and salads, followed by a choice of pastas and baked dishes. And of course, there are pizzas. I have not tried any of the soups, though the selection of five items is well-balanced and the most substantial one is the Chicken Tomato Soup with pasta and vegetables. 

 Of the starters, there are three items I tried and liked. Tomato Basil Bruschetta was the first. This is fresh tomatoes finely diced, seasoned with basil, salt, black pepper and olive oil and served on crunchy bread. An Italian form of cheese toast was next. Bread with a healthy dose of garlic butter is toasted and then topped with mozarella cheese and baked. There was also Roasted Chicken Pizziola which is roasted pieces of chicken cooked in fresh tomato sauce, oregano, parsley onion and garlic. 

 I have always liked Rikkis preference for tuna fish because it is one of my favourites, and also to be found in many Italian recipes. At China Bistro, they serve Tuna Fish Pate on crunchy bread (a starter) and they also have a mixed salad with tuna fish and olives. 

 An excellent item among the main courses is the Spaghetti Carbonara which is spaghetti cooked with a cheese-bacon-egg, yolk sauce seasoned with black pepper, oregano and parsley and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese. They also do a spaghetti with Bolognese sauce which they do with minced chicken or mutton instead of beef and this I thought should have been redder (i.e. more tomato paste) and more gravyish. Tasting sessions are one thing, but to have a course-by-course Italian meal at China Bistro has to be a worthwhile experience. 

 The Chinese menu is an extensive one with many tempting offerings and the place has a compact selection of Thai items as well. I have tried a few and in my view the quality is quite consistent. 

 The combination of strictly Italian, Chinese and Thai cuisine under the same roof is a first for Calcutta.

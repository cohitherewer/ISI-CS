 Monsoon makes it, finally

 - Widespread heavy rain unlikely right away

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After a series of heat waves frazzled Calcutta from the beginning of this month, monsoon finally arrived in the city on Monday. However, weather officials said there was little chance of immediate widespread heavy rain, as the monsoon current over the Bay of Bengal is weak.

 ?Even though the monsoon current has covered Calcutta today, the situation is not favourable for widespread heavy rain, as the monsoon current is weak over the Bay of Bengal,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore.

 Officials said that on Sunday night, the city received heavy pre-monsoon showers. But till Monday evening, there was no rain in the city.

 ?For the two to three days of heavy rain ? that is usual with the onset of monsoon ? we require a low pressure or a depression in the Bay of Bengal. But even though we have a cyclonic circulation over the north Bay ? 1.5 km to 4.5 km over sea level ? for the past few days, it is not strong enough,? said Debnath.

 The monsoon is yet to cover the two Midnapores, Purulia, Birbhum, Bankura and Burdwan.

 ?While the monsoon is weak in Calcutta, we have received reports of heavy rains from Mumbai. The monsoon is active in parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat following low-level cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea, which is likely to intensify,? an official said.

 The cyclonic circulation over the north Bay, however weak it may have been, helped the monsoon travel to south Bengal from the north over the past 24 hours, officials said.

 Debnath said the monsoon current touched north Bengal on June 17, which is 12 days later than usual. ?Thereafter, for two days, the monsoon current did not move at all. Then on Monday, it moved into Gangetic West Bengal but is yet to cover south Bengal entirely,? he added. Since June 2, when the mercury shot up to 40.6 degrees Celsius, the norm has hovered between 37 degrees and 38 degrees.

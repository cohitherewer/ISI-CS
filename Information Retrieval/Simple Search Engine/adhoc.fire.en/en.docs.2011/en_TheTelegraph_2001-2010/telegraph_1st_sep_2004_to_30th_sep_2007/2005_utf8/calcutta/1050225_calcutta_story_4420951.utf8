 Failed 2004, passed 2005

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A student, who had ?failed? last year, was to sit for this year?s Madhyamik examinations on Friday. But he came to know on Thursday that he had already ?passed? them last year. 

 Gobinda Biswas, the student at the receiving end of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education?s bungling, doesn?t know how to react, for he has lost a precious academic year. 

 ?Gobinda appeared as a regular candidate in Madhyamik 2004. But when the results were out, the board failed to send his marksheet. They told us that he had failed in two subjects, history and physical science, and so they did not send us his marksheet,? said Asit Ganguly, headmaster of Bipinbihari Vidyapith, in Madhyamgram, where Gobinda studies. 

 According to the school authorities, in 2004,when the admit card was sent to the school, there was a mistake in Gobinda?s date of birth. He, however, had appeared for the examinations using that card, and after the exams were over, applied to the Board authorities to rectify the mistake. 

 But once the results were out, his marksheet wasn?t sent to the school, because the problem of the error in the admit card was still pending and the school authorities were told that he had failed in two subjects. 

 Gobinda had prepared to appear for all the papers this year, instead of just the two subjects in which he had ?failed?.

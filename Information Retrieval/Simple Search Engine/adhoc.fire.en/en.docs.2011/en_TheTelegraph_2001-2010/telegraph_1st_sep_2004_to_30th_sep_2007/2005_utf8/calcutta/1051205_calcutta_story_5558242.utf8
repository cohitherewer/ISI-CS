 As the year draws to a close, it?s time once again for parents to start worrying about school admissions.

 A three-day fair at Ice Skating Rink, featuring top schools from the city and the rest of the country, aims to make the tough task a tad easier.

 ?The India amp; International Premier Schools Exhibition has 35 schools participating, with 25 of them from places such as Darjeeling, Dehradun, Gurgaon, Rajasthan and one from Singapore,? said Sanjeev Bolia of Afairs, the organiser.

 Most participants at the fair either offer only international baccalaureate programmes through bodies like University of Cambridge International Examinations (UCIE) or in addition to ICSE and CBSE degrees.

 ?We are mainly targeting the international schools,? said Rakeshbanta Singh of UCIE. Around 120 schools in India are affiliated to the body, including a few from West Bengal. 

 ?We want to create awareness here and if the number of schools seeking affiliation increases, we may open a centre in Calcutta,? he added.

 The only international presence at the exhibition, Bhavan?s Indian International School, Singapore, is also looking to raise the awareness level in the city.

 ?We have a waiting list of 250 students in Mumbai and we expect some queries from Calcutta by the end of the fair,? said Shailesh Temurnikar, director of the school. Of Bhavan?s 1,700 students, 150-odd are from India.

 Though most outstation residential schools charge a few lakhs per year, they also offer scholarships for the needy and the meritorious.

 ?With good schools opening up in the city, the number of students going to the residential schools in the hills has come down,? offered Raju Agarwal of Himali Boarding School, Kurseong, a 28-year-old institution with 1,100 students. ?But we have received some serious inquiries at this fair,? he added.

 According to the schools, the international baccalaureate programme is gradually gaining a wider acceptance. ?Two years ago, students were doing the programme but without thinking. Today, they are asking why they should do the course,? said Lalage E. Prabhu of Gurgaon-based Pathway World School, one of the first in the country to have a Wi-Fi campus.

 Presentations on the relevance of Cambridge International Examination and on ?How to awaken the genius in your child? are the other highlights of the fair.

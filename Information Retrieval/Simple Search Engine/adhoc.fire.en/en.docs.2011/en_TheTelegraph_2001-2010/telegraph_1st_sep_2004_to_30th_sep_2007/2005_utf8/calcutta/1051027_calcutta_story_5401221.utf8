 Eleven years of elegance

 Espee, at 37, Shakespeare Sarani is celebrating its 11th anniversary in style. Having kick-started with a fashion show on Wednesday, the fun-and-fashion mood is set to carry on right through the Diwali countdown.

 Catching the rays of the morning sun were two crystal-studded outfits by Rina Dhaka that set the pace of the show, as city models Priyanka Pal, Tanushree, Ria Mitra, Lovely and Bidita sashayed around in one stunning outfit after another.

 Espee stocks ensembles by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Ranna, Rina Dhaka, Geisha, Kimono, Sunita Shankar, Wendell Rodricks, Mayura, Preeti Meshram Kapoor, Ravage Classic, Preeti Jhawar and Anjana Bhargav.

 It also houses accessories by Joolz, Burnt Sienna, Beena Seth, Anaaya, Tanvi Shah and Namrata Kanoi.

 The collections, a happy melange of various individual styles, tastes and sensibilities, reflected a cheerful festive spirit. Other than the traditional gota patti and sequinned fare, one came across interesting geometric patterns, frays and kitsch influences too, thus displaying once again Calcutta?s newly-acquired yen for experimentation.

 ?The tastes have changed and the embellishment-obsessed clientele has given way to the more global woman. Hence, our in-house collection emphasises texturisation and silhouettes, paying more attention to finer finishing details,? says Sangita Kejriwal of Espee.

 The fabrics ranged from net, chiffon, georgette, silk to crepe. The designer labels began from Rs 5,000 and the in-house pret was priced at Rs 850-plus.

 For Espee, the journey now dates back a decade. After introducing high fashion standards and big-league labels to the city, now what?

 ?Well, we have just begun supplying our in-house stuff to Kimaya in Dubai and Delhi and to Ensemble in Mumbai and Delhi. As far as Calcutta goes, Espee is always going to click here because it always takes two to tango! We?re happening, only because the city?s happening,? offers Purnima Chawla of Espee.

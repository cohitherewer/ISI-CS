 Go slow with the books, let kids get real

 - Teacher of teachers sees schools moving rapidly to abstracts at the cost of experience

 Get real. That is the message coming from a major section of academics involved in primary education in the United States. 

 ?A child may know the difference between seven and five on a white board in class but he may not be able to relate to the same numbers while handling candy,? says Stan Chu, professor at the Bank Street College of Education in New York City, specialising in early childhood and elementary teacher training. 

 Chu, along with Sandra Silverman, teacher-educator of California state ?A? department of education, is in town to train teachers at The Heritage School. After holding a workshop, they are now supervising the implementation of the new techniques.

 ?It is a problem across the world. Schools are moving too quickly to abstract symbols at the cost of real experience. We need to go slow with the children,? Silverman concurs. As a result, older children have trouble applying to life what they learn in class. 

 Chu recently implemented the direct experience method during his stint at Rato Bangala School in Kathmandu, one of Nepal?s most progressive schools. ?Experience with material skills lays the foundation for abstract thinking,? he emphasises.

 Another warning is against exams based on memory. ?It is wrong to place the entire emphasis on content. Unfortunately, there is a strong movement towards content-only tests. But there is also a counter-movement,? Chu points out. 

 He cites the system run by the International Baccalaureat Organisation, where there are no exams at the primary level and the stress is on the investigative way of learning. ?In contrast, the A level or the American system of Advanced Placement Program is heavily content-driven.?

 There are no straight answers on the ideal age for kids to use calculators or computers, though. ?While children should do simple calculations mentally, they can use the calculator where they get bogged down with menial calculations in working on complex patters that may take days to do in class otherwise,? Silverman points out. The dilemma exists for the computer as well. ?While it is far more enriching to go outdoors and play instead of being stuck with computer games, one cannot deny the vast library that the Net opens up,? Chu feels.

 The teachers at Heritage School are happy at the exposure. ?This investigative approach taught us how to conduct activities that encourage students to arrive at conclusions and build up a scientific temperament,? says headmistress Meenakshi Atal.

 Meanwhile, Chu asks: ?How long is the room?? As guesses fly in metres, feet and yards, the teacher of teachers smiles, strides across the room and says: ?Fourteen seconds long?.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Private construction companies often employ inexperienced and untrained people to operate cranes and other heavy machinery. Several accidents take place at these sites, claiming lives or severely injuring labourers. But the incidents are hushed up. It should be made mandatory that only trained people operate big machines at construction sites.

 A few days ago, I bought a pack of 15 capsules of Winofit from a medicine shop in Salt Lake. Though the maximum retail price (MRP) printed on the pack was Rs 79.50, inclusive of all taxes, the salesman asked for Rs 80. The shop-owner could not give me a satisfactory reply when I demanded to know why I have to pay more than the MRP. Such malpractices by dishonest traders can be stopped only if we, the buyers, voice our protest.

 When Calcuttans are reeling under the extreme heat and humidity, invariably, the air-coolers inside some Metro Railway stations are ineffective. On the stretch between Netaji Bhavan and Central stations, the air-coolers of only two stations, Maidan and Esplanade, seem to be functioning properly. Adding to the discomfort are fans inside the compartments. In peak summer, the cooling systems inside trains are unable to cope if the passenger count increases. There is no reason why the system cannot be improved and technical snags repaired promptly.

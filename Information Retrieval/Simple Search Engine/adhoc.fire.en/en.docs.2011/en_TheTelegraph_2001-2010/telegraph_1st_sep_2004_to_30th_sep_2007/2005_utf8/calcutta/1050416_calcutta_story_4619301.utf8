The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In jail but active in crime

 Realtor Bijon Kundu: Under duress

 The bars of a prison are no bar for Jishu Jain, accused of several extortion cases in Tollygunge, to run his world of crime outside. Lodged in Alipore Central jail for years, Jain had got his men to assault and fire at Bijon Kundu, a real estate developer in Parnasree, Behala, and continues to threaten him for money.

 It all started on April 7, 2000, when Jain?s men raided Kundu?s office and demanded Rs 5 lakh. Kundu?s refusal prompted the criminals to hit him on the head with a revolver butt and then fire a bullet into his right shoulder.

 An injured Kundu was taken to Vellore after a brief treatment in a city hospital, but the doctors there failed to remove the bullet. 

 ?Today, I am crippled and have to move around on a wheelchair. But Jain continues to threaten me from inside the jail through his henchmen,? Kundu told Metro on Friday. 

 He has informed superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta of the matter and will also approach the state human rights panel.

 Kundu alleged that during his stay in Vellore, Jain?s men had grabbed 12 of his prime plots and taken possession of seven flats in Behala by producing a forged power of attorney. ?My wife and little daughter were at home then. One of the illegal occupants is a member of the CPM?s Behala local committee. I have brought this to the leadership?s notice,? he added. 

 Jain had even called Kundu a few months ago over a cell phone and warned him of dire consequences if he did not oblige his men.

 Jail sources said the vigil on Jain has been intensified following information that some of his associates had met him in the guise of his relatives two months ago. 

 Additional superintendent of police (industrial) H.K. Kusumakar said:?Those who are threatening Kundu are all members of Jain?s gang.? Fearing a second attack on his life, a police picket has been posted in front of Kundu?s house.

 The developer has lodged complaints against five men, three of whom are in jails. ?We are looking for the other two,? Kusumakar added.

 Malay Roychowdhury, a member of the CPM?s Behala (West) zonal committee, said he had received Kundu?s complaint about the partyman.

 ?If the allegation is true, we will take against against him,? he added.

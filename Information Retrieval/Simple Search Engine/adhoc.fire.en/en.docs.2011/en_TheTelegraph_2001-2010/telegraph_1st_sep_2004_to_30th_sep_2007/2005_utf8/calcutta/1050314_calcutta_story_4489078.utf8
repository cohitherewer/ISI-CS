It was a blend of star shower and flower power on Sunday evening at the Agri Horticultural Society of India as the spotlight was shared between the sylvan greens and the screen goddesses. 

 On a day that started with sporting heroes lending muscle to the city?s ?first real marathon? and ended with political heavyweights engaging in a war of words, it was evident where the glam quotient topped the charts.

 The Alipore address went berserk as Dada and the didis flew in from Mohali and Mumbai to inaugurate the Videocon Rose Garden. With Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly leading the loaded guest list comprising Mallika Sherawat, Mahima Chaudhuri and Sonali Bendre, the electric and eventful half-hour was everything from a floral flood to a starstruck stampede.

 Over 1,400 roses of 180 varieties, from the beautiful Browneas to the bizarre Shaved Brushes, punctuated the greens as everyone flocked to catch a glimpse of the star brigade. With the Society?s president Alka Bangar?s promise to make the Rose Garden ?one of the best in the country?, the start couldn?t have been more explosive.

 SOURAV GANGULY

On the field, he may be a natural born leader of the 

Bhajjis and the Balajis but when it comes to sharing space with the Sanias and 

Sherawats, the Prince of Calcutta seems to allow his crown to slip. He was the 

last to arrive all right but his red carpet entry in his red Merc and designer 

striped shirt seemed thanda in front of Mallika?s murderous meanderings 

inside the flower turf. While the organisers tried to explain: ?All this crowd 

is because of Bollywood?s Mallika Sherawat?, our captain cool kept saying: ?Can 

we just keep moving?? as he tried to make his way through the mob to look around 

the greens. Dada was confidence personified as he cut the inauguration ribbon, 

a couple of days before walking out for the all-important Eden toss.

 SONALI BENDRE

The first to arrive and the first to leave, the Hamma 

hamma girl was the only star who could walk and look around the new garden 

as the shutters went crazy over the other starry imports. ?It feels good amongst 

all these roses,? smiled Sonali, as she did her homework on the flower varieties 

before catching them up, close. 

 Looking slimmer, Sonali was all grace and gorgeous in her pink kurta. Unfortunately for Bendre backers, she didn?t hint at a screen return, while confirming her presence on the stage in Aapki Soniya.

 MAHIMA CHAUDHURI

All smiles and all white, the Pardes girl was 

all flowing at the Alipore greens. ?I am loving the Calcutta crowd,? Mahima shouted, 

as she obliged the hordes of autograph seekers and the hovering lenses. After 

cheering Sourav on to cut the inauguration ribbon, she was more than happy to 

talk about her forthcoming films. ?Don?t worry, I?ll be back on the big screen 

soon enough,? Mahima promised.

 MALLIKA SHERAWAT

No wonder, her next film is titled Bachke Rehna 

Re Baba. The Murder queen was the showstopper in her sexy orange number 

but she kept dodging the cameras and the camaraderie. ?Why are they asking me 

questions about cricket?? she asked, as she took a quick stroll inside one of 

the green houses. Don?t worry, the 17-kisses-a-film lady did recognise the captain 

but she was not ready to talk films, flowers or flannels. Kis kiski kismat, 

you see! ?No byte, no byte,? she cried long after the media had left her in the 

comfortable interiors of her Hyundai.

 Twin thrusts for civic efficiency

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The government has formulated two policies to improve the functioning of civic bodies across the state and also decided to introduce a Bill to modify the tax system.

 ?We want to replace the present annual rental valuation system with a unit area-based valuation,? urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Tuesday.

 According to the minister, the present system does not allow the civic bodies to collect revenue on the basis of individual assessment of citizens.

 ?The system entails collection of taxes on the basis of the valuation of a particular area. We are now trying to prepare a profile of each individual and collect taxes on the basis of his assets and the services he avails of,? Bhattacharya said. 

 A Bill will be tabled in the Assembly this year to give shape to the proposed system.

 The state government will first implement the system in the Calcutta Municipal Area. 

 ?The other civic bodies will be brought within its purview in phases,? the minister said during a workshop on Best Practices in Urban Local Bodies: Sharing of Experiences, organised by state government.

 The two policies the government has formulated are related to solid waste management and urban health. 

 The first will aim at generating awareness among the masses regarding waste management and the second will address health-related issues. 

 In the workshop, the municipalities and municipal corporations showcased their achievements and shared with one another their experiences in providing civic amenities to the citizens.

 Bhattacharya stressed the need for people?s participation in bringing about a change in the functioning of the civic bodies. Because of rapid urbanisation, the civic bodies are faced with challenges that cannot be met by technology alone. ?Peoples? participation is a must,? he asserted. 

 Chitra Chopra, secretary in the Union government?s department of urban employment amp; poverty alleviation, said: ?Experiences of all civic bodies should be documented so others can learn from them.?

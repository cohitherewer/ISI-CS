 Threat to Buddha, Ansari cell beef-up 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government has thrown a security blanket around international gangster Aftab Ansari, lodged in Presidency jail, following leads from intelligence agencies that he has been maintaining contact with a terrorist group active in some parts of the city.

 The move follows a letter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee from ?a well-wisher?, warning him that he and his family could be targeted by the group, which has a base in east Calcutta. 

 The letter was sent to Bhattacharjee?s Palm Avenue residence and to his office at Writers? Buildings.

 Sources said four deputy jailors from other central jails have been requisitioned to strengthen security near Ansari?s cell. 

 They are being assisted by senior warders. Barring lawyers, no visitor is allowed to meet the undertrial.

 Ansari, arrested in connection with the attack on American Center and abduction of shoe baron Parthapratim Roy Burman, has been lodged in cell 9 of the high-security jail since 2001. His trial in the American Center case is being conducted in a makeshift court on the jail premises. 

 Principal secretary (jails) P.K. Agrawal said on Monday: ?A special security ring was thrown around Ansari early this week, following intelligence inputs about the under-trial?s links with a terrorist group. Ansari?s cell is under round-the-clock vigil by senior officers and warders.? 

 Armed forces from the city police and a number of warders are manning the nine watch-towers around the jail. 

 ?We have asked for more armed forces to further intensify the vigil,? Agrawal added.

 The authorities have not ruled out the possibility of a section of warders acting as a conduit between Ansari and the world outside. 

 ?We are also trying to find out whether the accused has been passing on information to his associates through the jail staff. And to pre-empt any such possibility, we are regularly changing warders at cell 9,? said an officer. 

 Jail sources said inspector-general (prisons) Joydeb Chakraborty had paid a surprise visit to Ansari?s cell three days ago, following reports that the accused had been passing on information to his associates over a mobile phone. However, no cell phone could be found on Ansari or in the cell.

 Officers said Ansari has threatened to move the National Human Rights Commission against the ?unprecedented? security. ?He has repeatedly threatened us with dire consequences if he continues to languish in the jail,? said an officer. 

 Jail superintendent S.R. Hossain, however, asserted that the security around Ansari would not be slackened under any circumstance.

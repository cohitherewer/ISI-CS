The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Barge had papers in order

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Howrah Pontoon Bridge, the first bridge on the Hooghly connecting Calcutta with the western side of the river, constructed in 1874, demolished in 1945

 The barge, whose mast was stuck under Howrah bridge, used to ferry fly ash to Bangladesh and had permits to ply on the Hooghly, officials of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) said.

 IWAI, a body controlled by the Centre, is authorised to issue permits to passenger and cargo vessels to ply on the Hooghly. The West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC), which operates passenger vessels, also obtains permits from IWAI.

 ?We had issued a permit to the self-propelled barge, MV Moni, to ply on the Hooghly within the Calcutta and South 24-Parganas jurisdiction and enter the territory of Bangladesh. The barge has the necessary sanctions for ferrying fly ash to Bangladesh,?? IWAI director Manas Saha said.

 ?Preliminary investigation reveals that there was no foul play. The vessel was on its way to Ghusuri to get its hydraulic machine repaired,?? the IWAI director said. 

 ?After speaking to the master and a quick on-the-spot assessment, I feel it was just an accident,? asserted Saha. 

 MV Moni had passed beneath Howrah bridge a number of times before, but had never encountered such a situation.

 ?According to rules, vessels that intend to ferry goods abroad have to secure a permit for each trip. MV Moni used to do so,?? Saha added.

 He said he would submit a report to Delhi on the matter. 

 ?I have spoken to the master of the barge and inspected the bridge where the mast was stuck. I have to visit the spot at least two or three more times to assess the damage to the bridge and check the vessel before preparing the report,?? he explained.

 Saha said the mercantile marine department would conduct a separate probe into the incident, apart from another inquiry by the Calcutta Port Trust and the River Traffic Police.

 ?We shall also alert other vessels to check the height of their masts because during the monsoon, the river water level rises and such accidents are quite likely to occur,? he added.

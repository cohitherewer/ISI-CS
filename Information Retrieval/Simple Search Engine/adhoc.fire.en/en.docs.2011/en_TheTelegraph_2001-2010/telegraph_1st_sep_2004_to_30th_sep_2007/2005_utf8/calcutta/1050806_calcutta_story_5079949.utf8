The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 2 held for train heist

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Criminal Investigation Department on Friday arrested two men in connection with the robbery of Rs 99 lakh on the Geetanjali Express a month ago. The accused, Ramjeet Singh and Suman Kumar Pathak, were picked up from Chapra, in Bihar. 

 Two other accused had been arrested earlier.

 On July 8, four armed men had boarded the compartment in which two guards were carrying cash belonging to a private bank. The gang robbed the money at gun-point.

 Police said Suman was waiting on Mumbai Road, near Khemasuli halt, between Kalaikunda and Jhargram, and helped the robbers flee. Ramjeet had allegedly booked the tickets for the four.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Skip and slide, hip-hop style

Skip. Scratch. Slide. Night in and night out. Even 

as you ?shake your body?, the music around you is not what it used to be. The 

hookah may be in place and so may be your partner, but the groove?s not the same 

anymore and certainly not the sound. 

Like every year, 2004 saw the music at the discos 

moving on to uncharted territories. While some beats stayed in tune, some lost 

pace and some pitched back. 

It was a whole new world that the DJs turned on for 

you, a world slow, smooth and supple.

Slow mo

 If 2003 was a whole lot of commercial music, 2004 

was all about hip-hop and R amp;B. ?Every music has its own phase,? says DJ Vicky 

of Winning Streak. 

?As of now, hip-hop has taken over the disco completely. 

Eminem?s hip-hop was huge in 2003,? he adds. 

But it is not the international version of the music 

genre. ?It is a more slow, more commercial, hip-hop format known as soca music,? 

says DJ Akash. 

?The normal hip-hop is too fast and hard for the Calcutta 

crowds, and the language used is often beyond comprehension,? he adds.

DJs saw the hip-hop coming. Says DJ Saranjit of Incognito: 

?India always takes time to adapt to a trend. Hip-hop has been ruling elsewhere 

for a long time. It is only now that we have warmed up to the music.?

And it is not just the music. ?Even if you see the 

way they dress these days in the disco, you can realise that the hip-hop culture 

is here to stay,? says DJ Harish of Dublin. 

?Loose pants and jackets, sleeveless T-shirts with 

numbers written on them, baseball caps ? what more do you want?? he asks.

Bolly folly

No disco night in Calcutta is complete without a proper 

dose of Bollywood medley. ?You don?t need to worry when you play Dekh le 

and Bheegey honth,? says Akash. 

?A thousand new genres may come and go but Bollywood 

is compulsory and indispensable. Even a foreign star like Tata Young is there 

at the discos through Dhoom macha le,? he feels.

But there is a change in Bollywood music too, says 

Harish. ?Earlier, the Bollywood beats used to be slow and unworked on and DJs 

had to work really hard to make them acceptable at discos. But now you take any 

Bollywood album and the tracks are so composed that they are ready to be played 

at the nightclubs. You don?t need to work on a It?s the time to disco.?

From Sanan sanan to Saaki, Bollywood 

has its crowd. ?You cannot cross out Hindi film music,? says Saranjit. 

?Like there has to be one member in the family who 

loves Bollywood movies, there is one member in every group who is addicted to 

Bollywood music at the discos,? he adds.

House full

With hip-hop ruling and Bollywood refusing to shift 

base, there is a question mark over the existence of house music. For some DJs 

like Vicky, house music is a thing of the past. ?House music is definitely moving 

out of the discos,? he says.

But there is also a voice against this view. Says 

DJ Girish of Shisha: ?House is the sound of the world. It cannot go anywhere. 

Every hit track in town has a bassline which is basically house music. You take 

a Bin tere sanam or a Disco 82, all these hit disco numbers have 

house music as their basslines. Everyone can make people dance to Koi kahe 

but the speciality lies in making someone move to a diffused sound ? house 

style.?

For some DJs, house music has to come in a new avatar. 

?The music in the Calcutta discos has shifted from the US to the UK. There is 

a lot of European sound that is being lapped up by everyone. Even house is now 

about the very melodious Euro trance music,? says Saranjit.

Rising stars

 They first made their appearances at the city discos 

in 2004 and are billed to be the biggest stars in 2005. They come from different 

continents and have different origins but they do produce the same kind of sound. 

So the men of music to listen forward to this year are Rishie Rich, Juggy D, Jay 

Sean and Dr Zeuss.

?You cannot put them into separate categories like 

hip-hop or R amp;B or UK Bhangra. They form a part of one single music category,? 

says Harish.

?Their music is already so popular. It?s only going 

to grow more and more. Tracks like Stolen by Jay Sean and Angel Eyes 

by Raghav are going to be huge in the days to come,? says Akash. 

Listen ahead

l the disc jockeys around town are unanimous in their 

prediction that 2005 is going to be the year of hip-hop music in the city. But 

not everyone feels it will sound the same.

Says DJ Girish: ?Anything which goes overboard will 

go out. So by middle of this year, expect this mix of hip-hop and R amp;B to get 

repetitive. What will rule is hip-hop with a Latino touch. Even reggae will come 

back in a big way. Just like Superstar and Turn me on became such 

cult stuff this year, expect new stars from the West coming with new sounds.?

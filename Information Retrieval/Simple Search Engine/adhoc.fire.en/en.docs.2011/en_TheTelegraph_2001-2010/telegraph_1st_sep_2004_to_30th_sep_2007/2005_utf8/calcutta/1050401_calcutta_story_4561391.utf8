The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Collage of fact and fiction

The first is a folk fantasy, the second a social drama. 

Adding to the rich repertoire of Nandikar are tales by Abanindranath Tagore and 

Tarashankar Bandopadhyay. Reshmi Sengupta goes behind the scenes of the 

two productions

 Sohini Sengupta rehearses for Bappaditya

The dark auditorium of Girish Mancha is empty, barring 

a few Nandikar members scattered all over. With the feeble light that filters 

in from the stage, one can figure out Tapas Sen hurling instructions about lights 

from the front row.

Rehearsals are on in full steam for two new Nandikar 

productions to be directed by Goutam Halder ? Abanindranath Tagore?s Bappaditya 

and Tarashankar Bandopadhyay?s Chokh Galo.

Featuring the mother-daughter duo, Swatilekha and 

Sohini Sengupta, in solo acts, Chokh Galo premieres on April 9 at Girish 

Mancha and Bappaditya at the same venue the following day.

?The two roles are completely different; they have 

different philosophies. The narrative styles are different, too. Besides, Sohini 

and Swatidi have distinct styles,? says Halder, who himself has riveted 

viewers with solo performances in Meghnadbodh Kabya and Barda.

The prince?

Halder has assigned the tough job of performing all 

the characters in Bappaditya, stretching almost an hour and a half, to 

wife Sohini. As she flits in and out of the five personas ? Bappaditya, the three 

women he is enamoured of, and the narrator ? Halder sprints from one end of the 

auditorium to the front row to correct a step.

?Bappaditya is a very popular text for most 

kids and I have always wondered why it has been particularly popular with girls. 

Much later, I realised that the character of Bappaditya had certain traits which 

women are very fond of,? says Halder, supervising every conceivable aspect of 

this production, as also Chokh Galo.

?Here are three different women ? king Salim?s daughter, 

the princess of Solanki and Deb Bandar?s daughter ? and all of them are fascinated 

by him. Because Bappaditya embodies a combination of femininity and masculine 

strength.?

Hence, Halder decided to have only one actor performing 

all four characters, plus the narrator. ?For this I needed an actress who could 

sing, dance and have the depth to depict the transition of a village boy to a 

king. And I don?t think it would have been possible without Sohini,? adds Halder, 

as his wife delivers a long dialogue, falters and picks up the cue again.

In between her kathak and martial movements, Sohini 

breaks into a folk song, with some support from a chorus. A band of musicians 

on stage renders some classical compositions. 

?The Rajasthani ambience, the palace, the folklore 

and the Muslim background? all this makes you think of classical music,? explains 

Halder, grabbing a quick bite before the second rehearsal.

? and the pauper

As the curtains go up on the barren stage landscape, 

a beam of light falls on a wrinkly old woman raving and ranting with a begging 

bowl in her trembling hands. Yet, it?s not entirely a mad woman?s muttering ? 

her words make sense. She is, what society has made her to believe, a witch, and 

hence a social outcast.

By the look of it, Swatilekha Sengupta seems poised 

to surpass her solo act in Shanu Roy Chowdhury, where Halder had assisted 

in directing the production.

?This play is about witch hunting, a social evil prevalent 

in our times too. We have a lot of superstitions about eyes, which takes on different 

connotations and meanings in different contexts. In Chokh Galo, we see 

the woman through the eyes of men and strangely enough, this woman actually believes 

that she is a witch. It?s a social commentary on the patriarchal set-up,? says 

Halder, who has adapted the play from the original Tarashankar Bandopadhyay story 

called Daini.

?For a stage production, I look for a text which is 

striking enough as a story. I am not worried about how far it will be adaptable 

on stage,? says Halder.

Apart from enacting the witch, Swatilekha will, like 

her daughter, don the garb of the narrator as well. ?Kathakata, where a 

narrator comments on the play and its characters, is ingrained in our theatrical 

tradition and the actor performing this role has to have a very strong philosophy. 

Because it turns out to be a process where the performer assesses his worldview 

with that of the narrator?s,? adds Halder, who has digitally scored the music 

for Chokh Galo.

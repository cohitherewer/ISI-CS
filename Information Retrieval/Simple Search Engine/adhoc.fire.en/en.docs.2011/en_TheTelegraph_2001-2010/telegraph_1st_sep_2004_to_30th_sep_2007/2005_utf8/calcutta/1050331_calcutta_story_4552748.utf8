 Swim like a fish in 16 days

 The sparkling pool at Hyatt Regency, to host swimming coaching sessions soon 

 The heat is on and what better way to beat it than with a splash in the sparkling blue? Citizens of Salt Lake are getting some reprieve from the scorching summer with swimming coaching sessions starting at Club Prana, the ?wellness centre?, at Hyatt Regency.

 So far, residents of the suburb could only make a beeline for Bidhannagar Swimming Association in BF block to cool off during the summer months. Those looking for personal attention and five-star treatment had to settle for crowded pools and stinging chlorinated water. Besides, it could be months before you ended up getting a swimmer?s certificate.

 Though it costs quite a packet at Prana ? Rs 3,000-plus for members and Rs 4,500-plus for non-members ? you could start to swim like a fish in 16 days flat! They don?t provide a formal certificate, but personal attention and expert guidance are the USPs being touted by the hotel.

 The first session starts on April 5. In the 16-day session, novices will be coached by a group of three trainers headed by ex-national swimming champion (junior) Manish Jaiswal.

 Beginners will be taken through the paces of how to float on water, how to position the body, feet and arms right, kicking, breathing, hand movement and finally, freestyle.

 ?One can only learn the freestyle stroke in such a short period, but we also provide an orientation of various other styles,? says Manish.

 Personal attention apart, the club promises a clean and comfortable time in the water. ?We have a 24-hour filtered water circulation system in our pools. So we don?t need to maintain a high level of chlorine that is often damaging to the skin and hair,? says Joseph Skaria, manager, Club Prana.

 A dab of moisturiser to avoid dryness after a swim and swimming caps to protect long hair is all Manish advises by way of skin and hair care.

 For those who don?t quite fancy a tan, there are evening coaching sessions at the club from 4.30 pm to 5.30 pm. Otherwise, one has to make a trek to the Salt Lake hotel bright and early at 7.30 am.

 The client profile is expected to be between four and 12 years of age, with a few adults thrown in.

 Strokes of genius

 Capturing the many-hued wonders of the world around us, Baniprosonno recreates in his works of art a magical universe brimming with the richness of life, its power and passion. The ongoing exhibition of his paintings and illustrations offers an insight into the spirit and soul of this brush-wielding wizard. Featuring his works in oil on canvas, acrylic on paper and an assortment of sketches and drawings, the show fascinates by virtue of its sheer variety and expanse in terms of treatment of themes and ideas. To appreciate Baniprosonno?s creations, it is important to view them from a purely personal perspective, where the viewer must imagine sharing a private, intimate companionship with his works. The use of raw, earthy colours, painted in bold, sharp strokes, produces in his works an energetic, dynamic and almost life-like quality. It is this ability to transform simple images from everyday life and investing them with profound significance that bears testimony to his creative genius.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Small talk

 Switch off your phone en route to your weekend party and save up on the sizzling bytes that ruled the airwaves this week. When at the bash, steer clear of all objectionable substances, stick to chattering about those who got caught in the act instead!

 Pataudi pickle

 Cluck, cluck, the nawab turns fugitive. At 65 years, a weak disposition has finally caught up with the tiger, snigger, snigger! As the hunter turns hunted, evading arrest for killing an endangered black buck, pick on something your own size, we say. Assail him some more for showing utter disregard for the law of the land and not heeding court orders to show up for investigations. Will someone tell the likes of him to wake up from royal stupor and smell the democracy?

 Bidapa hash

 This fashion exponent sure fell into a freaky chakra, getting caught in Dubai with two g of marijuana in his bag. The fraternity is out on a limb to bail him out of the jam, but the talking point is the foolishness of it all. You would think the style bhai would have a modicum of sense and realise that carrying marijuana on your person could be injurious to your image when going through customs. But maybe he was too dazed to think straight.

 Puff huff

 And there is bungle in Bollywood too. The ban on smoking on screen ? big and small ? may be a simplistic diktat, but the loops in the smoke-rings leave room for a lot of haze, and hee haw. You can portray smoking in period films if a character was a known smoker, but try depicting your average dude on the street with a penchant for the puff, and your film is likely to be snipped. As of October 2, the light goes out on all evil smokers. But there is the small matter of foreign films, and how warnings will be worked into all old films and shows and who will monitor it all? Still awaiting a solution, and wondering whether it will all go up in smoke.

 Jacko jinx

 Abroad, at least, there was some measure of relief for Michael Jackson fans. The pop icon is finally acquitted in the child molestation case. But will his musical career make a recovery? Industry pundits doubt Jacko can make a thrilling comeback. But his loyal band of followers in this part of the world can keep their fingers crossed as the air is rife with predictions of a world concert tour to bounce back from the financial mess he is mired in following the long-drawn legal battle. But Michael Jackson in Calcutta? Why not, considering his popularity has taken a tremendous beating in the US, but fans in Europe and Asia are reportedly unperturbed by the scandal. Rock on!

 The renewed chill in the air is just the excuse to tuck into some hot, spicy food. Hyatt Regency has been quick to scan the weather report and come up with a Hyderabadi food promotion at its Indian specialty restaurant Guchhi, starting January 16. 

 Favourites like Mutton Biryani, Tawa Fish and Mirch Baigan ka Salan already find pride of place on the main menu and so haven?t been included in the new spread.

 Instead, recipes like Dalcha Gosht (boneless lamb cooked in a handi with yellow dal), Murgh Korma (chicken cooked in yoghurt gravy), Machhali Salan (bekti cooked in spicy gravy with tomato, tamarind and coconut milk), Nahari Gosht (lamb stew cooked with herbs and spices), Hyderabadi Dum ka Murgh (chicken cooked in sesame seed and peanut gravy) and Royalla Pulusu (prawns cooked with coconut, red chillies and bellpepper) form part of the non-vegetarian section on the new menu.

 The vegetarian options are as many, if not more. Baghara Baigan (brinjals cooked in tamarind, coconut and peanut gravy), Bendekaya Velpudu (ladyfinger cooked with chana dal, coconut and green chillies), Paneer Tamatar Tuk (paneer cooked with sesame seeds and curry leaves), Achar ke Aloo (baby potatoes cooked with achari masala), Tarkari Meloni (mixed vegetables cooked in spinach gravy) and Khatti Dal (Hyderabadi chana dal flavoured with tamarind and garlic) are the dishes to look out for.

 ?A lot of our clientele is non-Bengali, especially from the Rajasthani community that prefers vegetarian food. So we have to pay special attention to this section,? said Anil Khurana, corporate India chef of the hotel chain. 

 The food is more on the spicy side as most vegetarians like it that way, observed the chef, adding that Hyderabadi food is spicy and sour, with added emphasis on peanuts, coconut and curry leaves for flavouring.

 Treasure trove

 Khazana, nestled in the lobby of Taj Bengal, is the place to be. For, The House of Indian Treasures is having a rare sale till the end of the month on practically every item in the store, ranging from women?s apparel and jewellery to select leather products and exquisite silver and bronze artefacts.

 The gold-plated marble and silver artefacts, gemstones, old bronze items, stools and boxes, sandalwood figurines of animals and goddesses that are usually found here are marked at a discount of 25 per cent. These are handicrafts that have been carefully sourced from states like Rajasthan and Gujarat.

 Paintings by eminent artists can be picked up for a 25 per cent discount, too. The interiors section has the same discount on cushion covers and bedcovers made from silk brocade and other rich fabrics.

 The women?s apparel section has 15 per cent off on its lehngas, embroidered Madhubani salwar-suits in silk and cotton and patchwork stoles and shawls. Jamewar prints and Swarovski-studded shawls can be found on silk pashmina.

 Brocade and sequinned lehngas and woollen trousers and skirts with chiffon kurtis are items worth a buy. The exquisitely-designed silk scarves and georgette dupattas are further slashed with a 25 per cent discount on silk and silk-chiffon.

 For the men, there is a wide range of ties, kantha and pashmina mufflers, sherwanis and embroidered kurta pyjamas on which there is a 20 per cent discount. 

 Finally, the relief on costume jewellery. With original prices starting at Rs 250, 25 per cent off is significant when it comes to the specially-crafted sapphires, garnets and other precious and semi-precious stones on pure silver neckpieces, earrings and bracelets.

 ?We wanted to start the New Year with festive discounts to bring in cheer with a badge of affordability,? says Simanti Nair, manager, Taj Khazana.

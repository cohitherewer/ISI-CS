 Jassi amp; Armaan: Made for each other 

 Dressing up for D-day 

 This is one wedding that is going to be celebrated in every drawing room. After months of dilly-dally, Jassi is finally ready to exchange vows with the man of her dreams, Armaan Suri. No wonder Sony Entertainment Television has already roped in some of the biggest names in the industry for this grandiose event. 

 Ace fashion designer Neeta Lulla, known for draping Aishwarya Rai, will be designing the bridal outfit for Jassi. Lulla has rustled up five exclusive wedding outfits for Jassi to choose from. And the lucky one is a pink lehenga-choli with an aquamarine and orange dupatta. It weighs five kg with exquisite work including zardosi, crystals and semi-precious stones. 

 ?I have worked very closely with the Bollywood fraternity and dressed up many actors for the big screen,? said Lulla. ?This is the first time a leading character on television will be wearing my creations. This is going to be a special day in Jassi?s life and we are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that she looks stunning.?

 Jassi?s bridal jewellery ? necklace and earrings made in white gold set with emeralds ? is being provided by Neelam Jewels, owned by actress Neelam Kothari. The cost of the jewellery is around Rs 10-15 lakh. Be part of Jassi?s wedding celebrations, starting Monday, 9.30 pm.

 A show on Play TV: Win win

 If you didn?t get a call from Kaun Banega Crorepati, don?t worry. The new beam from the Zee stable, Play TV, is on air as India?s first interactive gaming channel. According to business head Amit Goenka, audience interactivity is waiting to explode on the Indian screen. ?There are 55 million cell phone users here... over a billion messages are sent daily.?

 Three games are being shown on Play TV. In Guess ?n? Win, a picture of a celebrity is digitally distorted. A respondent who sends the correct SMS is randomly picked by the computer and called up live on air and asked three questions. Getting them right wins booty like an iPod, an MP3 player, a TV and a washing machine. Priya Roy of Calcutta had caught the 3 pm show while she was at her sister?s in Delhi. Her lucky answer won her a DVD player. 

 From 7 pm to 7.30 pm is Ulta Bid where viewers have to bid for products showcased on the show. The lowest unique bid wins. ?People have won a cellphone for Rs 1.26 and a digital camera for Rs 2.60.? 

 The third programme, based on the UK show Grab a Grand, is Malaamal. Beamed from 8 pm to 9 pm, it involves cash prizes of incremental amounts as the rounds progress. A chat show is also held every night. ?The topic is of interest to the youth ? going out on your first date, how to find out if your partner loves you, even safe sex?,? adds Goenka.

 The channel is getting ?tremendous response? from the rural sector and small towns. ?Everyone understands the SMS technology,? says Goenka. Housie, christened Houzee, will start next, on a Sunday slot. To be simulcast on Zee TV, it will be hosted by Javed Jaffery.

 It?s the newest American sitcom on Indian television. But Arrested Development is not all sweetness and light ? the Bluth family is dysfunctional enough to make the Simpsons look normal. George Bluth Senior is in prison for financial irregularities in his company. Son Michael (Jason Bateman) tries to save the business, with almost no family support. 

 In the next episode, Visiting Ours, on STAR World (Thursday, 9.30 pm), Michael tries to find a way to stop visiting his father in prison, to get to the bottom of the accounting practices. He tries to get the information from his father?s assistant Kitty. 

 Meanwhile, Lindsay Bluth Funke (Michael?s opportunist twin sister played by Portia de Rossi of Ally Macbeal fame) and her husband Tobias visit a marriage counsellor. But there is a twist in the tale when Tobias is nearly seduced by the male therapist.

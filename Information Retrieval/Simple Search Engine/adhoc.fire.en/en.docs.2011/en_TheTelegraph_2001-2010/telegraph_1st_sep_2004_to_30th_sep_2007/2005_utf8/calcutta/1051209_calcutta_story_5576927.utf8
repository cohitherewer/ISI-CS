 Protest by Rick pals 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Carrying placards and photographs of Rick Nath, some 2,500 schoolmates of his took out a silent procession in Behala and New Alipore on Thursday morning to protest the gruesome killing of the five-year-old.

 Rick was murdered and dumped in a septic pit at the residence of neighbour Bela Bose last week. After finding the body, an angry mob had set Bela and her husband, Rabindra Nath, on fire and severely beaten up their son, Kaushik. Bela died of burns.

 The students marched from their school, St Joseph and Mary, to Triangular Park in New Alipore. The placards read: ?Ei sundor prithibir sundor Rick, tomake osundorera muchhe phelte pare na (Rick, you belong to this beautiful world and no evil can wipe you out).? They also observed a minute?s silence.

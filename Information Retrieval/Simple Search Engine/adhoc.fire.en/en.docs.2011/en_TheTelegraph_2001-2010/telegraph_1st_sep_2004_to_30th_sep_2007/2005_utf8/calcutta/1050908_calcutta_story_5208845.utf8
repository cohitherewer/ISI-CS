 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya was on his way to an appointment on Wednesday morning, when a breathless civic officer informed him over the cell phone that a portion of the road above the underground parking lot outside New Market had subsided. The mayor immediately headed for the spot. 

 Bhattacharya was still on the road when the officer called again. This time, to say that everything was okay and like many others, he and his colleagues had been misled by a rumour that had spread like wildfire through the city. 

 The rumour triggered panic in the New Market area. Several police officers and mediapersons rushed to the spot in the morning for first-hand information.

 According to shopkeepers in the area, gatekeepers of nearby buildings and a few porters spread the word after noticing an elongated, deep hole on the road adjacent to the Parkomat.

 Within minutes, more than a hundred people had converged on the spot and the mayor, too, was headed there, cancelling his appointment. 

 Officers of New Market police station said they had received a call informing them of the ?road cave-in?. The cops soon set out to verify the truth.

 ?I found that a crowd had gathered on the road in front of my shop, when I arrived around 9 am. A couple of bystanders, probably rickshaw-pullers, told me the road had collapsed. Only much later did I learn that a contractor had dug the road to repair a drainage line,?? said Sukumar Ghosh, owner of a textile store.

 Khalil, who hawks on the pavement in front of Globe cinema, said the road was perfectly alright on Tuesday night, but had developed a crater the morning after. 

 ?I believed the rumour because I could not figure out the origin of the hole,?? he offered.

 The fears were put to rest only after one of contractor?s employees, who had dug the road at night, asserted that the hole was made to repair a drainage line.

 ?As Puja marketing has already started, we excavated only a small portion of the road. We did the job at night so that the traders and the shoppers were not inconvenienced. We resumed our work during the day,?? the labourers stated.

 Ironically, the contractor had been employed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to repair the damaged drainage line and connect it to another drainage channel that had recently been constructed.

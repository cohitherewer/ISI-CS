 Flat sale to cut state losses

 - CIT plots, supermarkets up for grabs across the city 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Under pressure to curtail expenditure, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government will soon start selling dilapidated flats in state-owned housing estates in prime areas of the city at low rates, ranging between Rs 66 per sq ft and Rs 77 per sq ft.

 Officials announced on Friday that the urban development department had decided to sell off 3,000 flats. 

 In the first phase, 700 flats will be up for sale.

 Unable to bear the maintenance cost of the flats, the government will first approach the tenants. If they do not show interest, outsiders will be provided the option of buying the flats, owned by Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT). 

 ?The per-sq-ft-rate of ground and top-floor apartments has been fixed at Rs 66. The rest of the flats will be sold at the rate of Rs 77 per sq ft,? a senior official of the department said on Friday. 

 The flats are spread across the city, in housing estates in the Kasba, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Chetla, Lake Gardens, Maniktala, Ultadanga and Entally areas, among other places.

 ?For several years, many of the tenants are not paying rent. The CIT is incurring heavy losses,? added the official. 

 The organisation was spending 10 times more in maintenance than it was earning as rent, he stated. ?In cases where the tenant will not buy the flat but continue to occupy it, we will evict them.?

 Losses incurred in maintaining the flats have been mounting since the state government stopped grants for the purpose in 1997. 

 Other sources of income, by way of taxes, have also dried up. ?A fixed deposit of Rs 40 crore has been exhausted in paying salary and meeting other expenses,? stated another official. 

 Sources said the CIT was also planning to sell off some of its supermarkets and land for revenue. The organisation owns 11 supermarkets in the city, including the markets at Jadavpur, Lake Gardens, Kasba, Chetla, Deshapran Sashmal Road, Tollygunge Circular Road and Maniktala.

 It could put 300 acres of unutilised prime land up for sale as well. Most of the plots have been grabbed by encroachers, who are running businesses from there.

 The CIT employees? union has criticised the move. ?Instead of trying to utilise the assets, the government is planning to hand them over to land sharks,? alleged P.B. Nag, joint general secretary of Development Employees? Joint Action Committee.

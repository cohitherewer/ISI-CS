 The toll collection building on Vidyasagar Setu could do with a fresh coat of paint. Its walls have been defaced by betel stains and make for a very sorry picture. Whether the responsibility of dirtying the place lies with the people manning the toll counters or the drivers who pass by, is debatable. Also, some of the concrete pillars holding the approach flyovers to the bridge seem to be in bad shape. Portions of the railing, that have been damaged after vehicles rammed into them, have still not been repaired. The government should carry out the long overdue maintenance and repair work.

 On June 21, I attended a seminar at Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the environment for women working on night shifts. The same platitudinous issues on women?s empowerment, separate toilet facilities for female employees and self-restraint on the part of men, were harped upon. Such events should result in something more innovative and worthwhile.

 Garbage, construction wastes and parthenium shrubs have engulfed most of the vacant plots in Salt Lake?s Sector I and II. Prior to the civic polls, some of the internal roads were given a facelift. But no attention was paid to clear the mess on the vacant plots. Residents in houses adjacent to such plots live in constant fear of snakes and insects since the onset of monsoon. The mosquito menace is also intolerable. Will the new civic board look into the matter on a priority basis?

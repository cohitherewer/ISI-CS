The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sister act

 A hilarious take on Shakespeares Macbeth, as well as a robust comedy in its own right, Theatrecians latest production, The Wyrd Sisters, promises to offer the audience an evening of pure fun and entertainment. Based on Terry Pratchett?s fantasy novel by the same name and adapted for the stage by Stephen Briggs, the play turns conventions on its head to present a unique, if not bizarre, philosophy of life. The action begins with Duke and Lady Felmet ruling tyranically over the kingdom of Lancre, having killed the old king Verence. Spurred by the fatuous advice of their loyal but half-hearted Fool, they plan to totally dominate the kingdom. However, their corrupt designs are in grave danger of being foiled by a most unexpected opposition. Three witch sisters are determined on their mission to put the murdered king?s baby son back on the throne someday. Powered by inspired, impressive performances by all the main characters, the play is directed by Dhruv Mookerji.

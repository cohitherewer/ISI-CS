Behind the bar

You might swear by your peg of vodka or rum, but how 

much do you know about the origin and blends of these liquors? Read on for some 

liquid facts.

Gin

Distilled from grain. Its distinct flavour comes from 

Juniper berries, along with a variety of mixed herbs and spices. There are three 

main varieties of gin ? dry, golden and sloe.

Dry gin: a low sweet variety of gin

Golden gin: a dry gin with a golden colour 

due to the ageing process and storage barrels

Sloe gin: a liqueur made from blackthorn bushes

Rum

Distilled from sugarcane and molasses. First produced 

in the West Indies in the 17th century, many of the main producers still reside 

there today. There are two main variations ? light and dark.

Light rum: the original rum from the barrels, 

less flavoured with a white or gold colour. Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 

are the major producers

Dark rum: a rich syrupy-flavoured rum from 

added caramel. Barbados, Guyana and Jamaica are the major producers

Vodka

Distilled from potatoes or corn and wheat. Traditional 

alcoholic beverage of the Baltic states, Poland and Russia. Today vodka is produced 

all over the world and has become the most popular mixed beverage in the United 

States. The Russian vodkas are usually distilled from potatoes while the Americans 

distil it from corn and wheat. The filtering process is what gives vodka its flavour.

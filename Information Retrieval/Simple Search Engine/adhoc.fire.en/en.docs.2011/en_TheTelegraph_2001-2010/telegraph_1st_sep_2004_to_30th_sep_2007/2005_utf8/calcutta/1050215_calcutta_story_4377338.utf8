The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three little words in three letters 

Personal touch on the wane

 - Valentine?s army prefers to say it by SMS rather than by poetry on cards

 The message might be the same three little words (yawn or yippee, as the case may be), but Romeo (and, increasingly, Juliet, too) is finding new ways to be heard.

 If you like to be romanced with verse penned by your paramour, time for some tough love: the truth is you aren?t likely to get poetry (even courtesy greeting card companies) thanks, in part, to that omnipotent upstart ? the SMS.

 Landmark has registered a slump of ?more than 25 per cent in Valentine?s Day greeting card sales?, compared with a couple of years ago, reveals Gautam Jatia.

 ?Even two years ago, we would see brisk sales,? he adds. Now, he feels, purchases may have lost steam due to the popularity of the more spontaneous SMS.

 Some of these lazy lovers do opt for the digital route, as they do for just about every holiday and special occasion.

 ?The number of short messages has increased marginally, but the response to contests ? voice and SMS ? was phenomenal,? says an Airtel spokesperson. The ring tone promotion for the Valentine army wedded to technology also received good response, reports the cell phone service provider.

 Gautam Shroff, owner of the Archies outlets at City Centre, Kankurgachhi and 22 Camac Street, says greeting card demand has stagnated, shrinking fast in the upper-middle class and middle-class markets.

 ?It is the people who do not have access to cell phones and computers who are still buying cards,? he explains.

 The industry, which has also lost out to e-card services, is no longer depending on bulk. Rather, it is looking towards high-value cards to keep it going.

 The focus of the consumer has also shifted to gifts, adds Vikash Kanoi, director of the Hallmark and Expressions stores in the city.

 ?A couple of years ago, people would come in to buy cards and also pick up small gifts. But cards are no longer a consumer driver, gifts are,? feels Kanoi.

 Some young, sensitive souls still prefer to do it the old, slow way. 

 Asif Salam, a student of Ashutosh College, buys a card and flowers or chocolates for his Valentine, as well as cards for all those he loves ? including his mom ? on February 14.

 ?We do send SMS, like an all-user one, for friends, and for those people who are out of town. But usually, it?s cards,? he says.

 The personal touch is important for Stuti Agarwal, too. ?Most of my friends have given each other cards. Even if it?s an SMS, a phone call always follows,? she adds.

 But is it possible that V-Day has also lost some of its charm? 

 ?You bet. If you meet your love interest every weekend at the disco, the significance of February 14 is obviously reduced,? says a somewhat peeved store-owner hit by the slump in sales of mush merchandise, despite the phenomenally high footfall.

 With browsers outnumbering buyers, revenues failing to match up to marketing expectations, and tech tools running the written word close, is it time already to reinvent the Valentine?s Day wheel?

 Gucchi, the Indian speciality restaurant at the Hyatt Regency, is playing host to Flavours of Awadh, a festival that dishes out a delectable repertoire of royal delicacies from the land of the nawabs. 

 Originally from Afghanistan and Iran, this cuisine came to India once the nawabs settled in and around Lucknow. Awadhi food is a harmonious blend of distinct flavours. In our festival, we promise authenticity of the cuisine, says chef Sandeep Pandey.

 The non-vegetarian platter offers traditional delicacies like the Gosht Gaulati Kebab (Lucknowi-style lamb patty flavoured with mace and cardamom and shallow fried) and Murgh Rezala (Lucknowi chicken preparation with coconut and poppy seeds). 

 The vegetarian section is equally wide with dishes like Paneer Mehrab (a traditional cottage cheese preparation), Shabnam Kastoori (fresh mushroom stuffed with processed and cottage cheese, marinated with yoghurt and cooked in tandoor) and Lauki Lazeez (small sweetgourd filled with khoya, dry fruits and finished with thick gravy). 

 The other highlights of the menu are biryanis ? Subz Biryani and Gosht Pardha Biryani. 

 Apart from the usual roti and naan, the festival offers special accompaniments like the sweetened Shirmaal and Lucknowi Kulcha.

 The Awadhi affair is on till August 28.

Rain menu

 If waterlogged streets and slushy stretches dampen your spirit during the monsoon, heres a reason to cheer. Trincas, the multi-cuisine restaurant on Park Street, is celebrating the rains with a food fiesta titled Barshar Bahar. 

 On at the eatery till September 16, the festival is cooking up some spicy and crispy bites to pamper the monsoon palate.

 With sudden downpours, cloudy skies and wet roads, this is the time when one actually starts feeling the monsoons in full swing. And what better way to enjoy the rains than savour some hot and spicy fare? smiles Shashi Puri, co-owner of Trincas.

 On offer are crunchy munchies that include a variety of crisp golden pakoras like Crunchy Paneer, Egg Crunch Munch, Chatpata Prawn, Fish Karara and Subzi Mandi.

 There are tandoor treats like Paneer Lal Tikka, Paneer Malai Kebab, Chicken Lasuni Kebab and Hariyali Mutton Seekh Kebab, all served with yoghurt dips.

 The sizzlers have been innovatively named Taka Tangs and are cooked in special in-house spicy masalas. We have named it such because it matches the sound while one cooks it on the tawa, says Puri. Sizzling delights include Mushroom and Green Peas Taka Tang, Chicken Taka Tang and Fish Taka Tang, served with a choice of naan, roti and steamed rice.

 To accompany the food, there is an interesting variety of mocktails or Pegga to choose from.

 Prices of the dishes range between Rs 60 and Rs 180.

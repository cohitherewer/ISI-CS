The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rebuilding life with music

 Calcutta prides itself in being known as a city full of kindness, warmth and compassion. Thus it comes as no surprise that Calcuttans from all walks of life are pitching in generously to provide relief to tsunami survivors. Joining citizens in their noble efforts is Oxford Bookstore, which hosts a fund-raising concert (Our Planet, Our Life amp; Our Duty) for the benefit of our country?s tsunami victims, specially children, thousands of whom have been seriously injured, orphaned or left homeless and destitute. Featuring popular singers Anjan Dutt and Usha Uthup along with Paban Das Baul, Santanu Bandopadhyay, Neel Adhikari and Neel Dutta, the concert promises to draw music-lovers who share a common grief for the tsunami disaster. Also performing at the concert will be bands like Class Apart, Krosswindz and Wired, livening up the afternoon with their distinctive brand of pulsating, feet-tapping music. Proceeds from the concert will be donated to the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund.

 Event: Fund-raising concert for tsunami victims

 When: Today; 11.30 am - 4.30 pm

 Victim kin seek cop help

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The relatives of Indranil Chatterjee, who was crushed to death under the wheels of a police jeep last Tuesday, knocked on the doors of the state administration on Friday. 

 They sought to drive home the fact that the 32-year-old executive was the sole breadwinner, and his family was in dire straits now.

 Indranil?s uncle Dipak met deputy commissioner (south division) N.R. Babu and deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim to seek financial help from the city police.

 Chatterjee also went to Writers? Buildings to meet the personal assistant (PA) to the chief minister to seek a job for Indranil?s widow, as the killer vehicle belongs to the chief minister?s department. Chatterjee said the PA is on leave and he will visit him again on October 25.

 Indranil was killed around 7.15 am when his motorcycle collided with a police jeep at the intersection of Queen?s Way and Cathedral Road, in the Maidan police station area. He was on his way to his workplace at Tarakeswar. The jeep driver was arrested and later released on bail.

 Chatterjee was assured of financial help by both Babu and Shamim. ?The deceased?s family will get a compensation of Rs 10,000, as per rules. Besides, we have told them to file an application for additional help and we will consider it,? said Shamim.

 CU eyes ties with campus in Singapore 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After the industrial tie-ups initiated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the academic alliance between Calcutta and Singapore is also moving towards a new high.

 Singapore-based Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) has evinced interest to sign a memorandum of understanding with Calcutta University (CU) on developing academic collaboration between the institutions.

 One of the main areas in which CU and ISAS plan to carry out research is India?s historical connections with Southeast Asia. 

 The two institutes also intend to identify the potential of cooperation between India and Southeast Asia, and also with China.

 It is learnt that chief minister Bhattacharjee during his recent tour of Singapore had addressed a gathering on ISAS premises.

 ?We are keen to collaborate with CU,? said ISAS institute manager Hernaikh Singh, in a written reply to CU authorities on Tuesday.

 The Peace Studies Group centre of CU?s history department had earlier sent a proposal to the ISAS expressing its interest to embark on an academic collaboration on conducting research activities on issues concerning contemporary South Asia.

 ?The Peace Studies Group and the ISAS are working on many common issues like resurgence and the increasing vibrancy of South Asia. Both CU and ISAS will benefit in a big way if the MoU is signed,? said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), who is also a senior teacher in the history department.

 According to preliminary talks between the two institutions, the proposed academic links could be initiated through faculty exchange, joint seminars, workshops, joint publications, and most importantly, collaborative research.

 Some of the other issues which the two institutions are planning to jointly work on are regional relations and cooperation, good governance, public health and education, business history, minority rights, environment management and globalisation, and human security.

 Researchers and scholars of other disciplines in CU, like political science, economics and sociology, are also involved in the research carried out by the Peace Studies Group. The research focuses primarily on South Asia?s regional peace and security.

 The tie-up between CU and the ISAS will improve the research standards, vice-chancellor Das said.

 Sources in the university said officials from the ISAS are likely to visit CU soon to finalise the agreement. 

 The ISAS has already sent a draft of the MOU this week to the university for its consideration.

 The proposal was immediately placed for discussion in the university?s syndicate body meeting where the members unanimously decided to sign the agreement with the ISAS, sources in the university said.

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Look 

hard before getting involved in anything. You honour every commitment you make. 

Though you work best in a team, you need the space for independent thinking, too. 

Take time off at times; it improves your efficiency. You need a partner who?s 

mature and serious and patient with you. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 KBC2?s weekend attack

 Bachchan?s back as the lovable small-screen quizmaster

 Ummeed hai toh aap aasman chhu saktey hain? That?s all you?ll get to hear in the booming Bachchan baritone for the next three months till Kaun Banega Crorepati 2 hits the airwaves on August 5. With the teaser campaign surfacing on the small screen from 9 pm tonight, the countdown to the biggest game show on Indian television starts ticking.

 With the winning jackpot doubled to Rs 2 crore this time, KBC2 can well rewrite the TRP records during its 85-episode run on STAR Plus. ?Apart from the prize money, we haven?t really changed anything from the first edition,? Synergy Communication?s Karun Prabhakaran, executive producer of the show, tells Metro.

 In its first outing, KBC not only resurrected Amitabh Bachchan?s sagging fortunes but also redefined primetime viewership on weekdays (Monday to Thursday) for STAR Plus. ?KBC 2 will be beamed on weekends (Friday to Sunday) this time,? revealed a STAR spokesperson. ?We have recently finalised the deals with the telecom companies. The phone lines for participation will open from June 6.? 

 In the first set of 11 promos, specially created by advertising agency O amp;M, Bachchan just announces the return of the blockbuster quiz show. Unlike last time when lines would be perennially engaged the day they were thrown open, people can apply for a KBC2 berth through SMS. 

 So it?s time to brush up the GK books again for a fresh shot at the 15 questions. Then, be fast with your fingers, choose 50-50, take the audience poll and dial-a-friend to be confident and sure enough to lock the Rs 20 million answer.

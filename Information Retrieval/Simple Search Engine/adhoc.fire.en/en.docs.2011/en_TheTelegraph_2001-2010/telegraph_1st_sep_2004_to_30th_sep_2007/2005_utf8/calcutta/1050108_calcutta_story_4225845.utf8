 Police earn court frown

 - Return goods, stop illegal raids on online lotteries, says order

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government was chided by Calcutta High Court on Friday for conducting ?illegal raids? on the retailers of online lotteries and seizing their equipment.

 The court directed the police to return the impounded equipment and not to conduct raids on the outlets till February 28, when the matter will come up for hearing again.

 Justice P.C. Ghosh, however, asked the retailers to furnish an undertaking to the police that they will not sell tickets of single-digit lotteries. ?The retailers will have the right to sell tickets of all weekly lotteries conducted by the other states,? the order said.

 Dubbing the police raids an ?over-exercise of power?, the judge observed that it would have to be decided first how far the state can enforce a Central Act, like the Lotteries Act, 1998. Hearing on this issue will be held on February 9.

 Justice Ghosh?s interim order came on a petition by Encorp-E-Service Limited, a dealer of online lotteries conducted by Mizoram and Meghalaya. The petitioner challenged the authority of the state government to conduct raids on online retailers and impound their equipment.

 Petitioner?s counsel Ajit Panja alleged that police were unnecessarily harassing the retailers, though they were plying their trade after paying all taxes. He also challenged the state government?s decision to ban online lotteries. The government could only take steps on the basis of criminal complaints against the retailers, Panja pointed out.

 Additional government pleader Debasish Kar Gupta submitted that police had started a drive against online lottery dealers on the basis of an FIR lodged by the director of a state lottery. He had alleged that the organisers and dealers of online lotteries were violating the Lotteries Act.

 The raids had revealed that the retailers were not using the logos of the state governments on the tickets. ?This is a criminal offence,? Kar Gupta said. The judge ordered the retailers to use the logos on the tickets they sell to the public.

 This is the third time while hearing the case that the high court has rapped police for stepping beyond jurisdiction while conducting the raids.

 At Writers? Buildings on Friday, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said his government would continue the drive against the retailers in accordance with the law. ?We will soon publicise the steps we will take against the retailers and dealers of online lotteries,? the finance minster said.

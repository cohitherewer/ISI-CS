 An ice-bar, a sprawling discotheque and a multi-cuisine restaurant ? all this and much more promise to make Venom a real value-add to Calcuttas nightlife.

 The last new entry of the year, in the citys ever-lengthening list of party haunts, this nightclub on the eighth floor of Fort Knox, the jewellery mall, will throw its disc doors open to Calcutta on Wednesday.

 GoodLife got the first glimpse of the new party address at 6, Camac Street, on Tuesday.

 The entire place is spread over 11,000 sq ft. The action for now will be limited to the 4,500 sq ft disc. The ice-bar and the restaurant will only be ready by March 2006. 

 The discotheque itself is divided into three segments ? a VIP zone, a sports section complete with a pool table, and the dance floor.

 The chic, modern decor of the place and the birds eye view of the cityscape that the glass walls of the bar offers are the highlights of Venom.

 None of the discs in the city are situated so high up. I am sure this would give a different high to the party people of Calcutta. We also have the biggest dance floor, spread over 400 sq ft, says owner Bunty Sethi of Anticlock and Winning Streak fame, about his New Year gift to Calcuttans.

 The other high points of the place are the strobe lights and the sound system. We have various small lights tucked away in different parts of the club. The sound system is from Electro Voice, says DJ Vicky.

 In the VIP section, every table boasts a TV where people can watch the songs being played at the console.

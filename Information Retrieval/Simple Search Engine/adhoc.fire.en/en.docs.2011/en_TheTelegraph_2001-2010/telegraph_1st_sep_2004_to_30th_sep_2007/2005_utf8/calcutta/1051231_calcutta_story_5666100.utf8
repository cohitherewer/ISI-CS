 The many shades of black

 Which is the best film of the year? At the end of it all, the audience went for a movie with no song or dance, no sex or action. As Black rsquo;s beauty continues to shine, we bring the curtains down on our Best of 2005 Film Poll. Watch out for the lucky winners..

 1. It may be at number five in Time rsquo;s Top 10 foreign films of the year, but for Calcutta, Sanjay Leela Bhansali rsquo;s songless wonder has always been the best film of 2005. With 60.2 per cent votes, the story of Michelle and her teacher is the people rsquo;s favourite again. The February release was the starting point for a string of hits for both Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee

 2. Number one and number two couldn rsquo;t be less alike. With a rocking soundtrack, some stunning lenswork and Bollywood rsquo;s favourite jodi, the Shaad Ali film was as colourful as Black was monochromatic. But it became bigger and better, as Kajra re continued to tickle the fancy mdash; and the feet mdash; of the nation.

 3. The Nagares may not have been a patch on the Corleones, but audiences lapped up the Bachchans rsquo; baap-beta act, much to the relief of Ram Gopal Varma. Here, the desi Godfather is ranked third

 4. The small wonder on the big list, Nagesh Kukunoor rsquo;s pint-sized gem with largely unknown faces is clearly the champion film of the year. Telling the underdog tale with a controlled flourish, the film finds itself ahead of big-budget blockbusters in fourth position

 5. No film could jab at the funny bone quite like this Anees Bazmee hit. The film just manages to squeeze into the list ahead of Page 3, Paheli and Parineeta

 ...and the worst of 2005

 Mr Ya Miss ? Because the plot was thinner and the acting flatter than the actress-director?s tummy

 Kisna ? Because Ghai?s appearance was the most awaited frame and Vivek Oberoi is not even an Arun Govil 

 Neal ?N? Nikki ? Because FTV has a more interesting lingerie show and Shah Rukh Khan is the best and only impersonator of Shah Rukh Khan

 Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav ? Because the former Bihar chief minister was the best thing about the film

 James ? Because WWE comes every night on Ten Sports and too much flesh is not good for the heart

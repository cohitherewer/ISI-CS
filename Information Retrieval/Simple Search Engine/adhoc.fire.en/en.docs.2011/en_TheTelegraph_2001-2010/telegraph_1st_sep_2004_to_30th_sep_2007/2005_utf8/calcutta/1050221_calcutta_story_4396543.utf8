The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The nature of my work takes me on tours across the country frequently. Recently, 

I travelled in an AC 2-tier compartment of Geetanjali Express on my way back to 

home from Raigarh. While moving about in the train with a friend, I noticed that 

electric points for charging cell phones were provided in the AC 3-tier coaches. 

The coach attendant informed us that the facility can be used by passengers on 

a first-come-first-served basis. While it is very thoughtful of the railways to 

provide the much-needed facility, I fail to see why AC 2-tier passengers are deprived 

of the service when they pay a higher fare? I request the authorities to provide 

the service in all the coaches irrespective of the class of travel.

 The AC 3-tier category was introduced only around six years back. Hence, most 

of our AC 3-tier coaches are relatively new compared to the AC 2-tier coaches. 

And most of these new coaches have been built with electric points for charging 

mobile phones keeping in mind the convenience of our passengers. We are trying 

our best to provide this facility in all the AC 2-tier coaches. The AC 2-tier 

compartments in Rajdhanis have already equipped with cell phone charging points. 

We thank the passenger for appreciating our efforts. We also take note of his 

suggestion that the facility should be provided in AC 2-tier also as those passengers 

pay more than AC 3-tier passengers.

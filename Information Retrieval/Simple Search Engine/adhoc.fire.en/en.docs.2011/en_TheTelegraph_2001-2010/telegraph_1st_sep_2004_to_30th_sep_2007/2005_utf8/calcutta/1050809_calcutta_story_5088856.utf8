 Imagine yourself immersed in a book in the reading room of National Library, when suddenly you realise to your horror that your cell phone and other belongings are gone.

 Thefts have become quite common inside the reading rooms and library, including Bhasha Bhavan. 

 Recently four such thefts have been reported, despite the presence of 24 of the library?s own security guards, in addition to 40 newly-recruited guards from a private agency. 

 The victims have lodged complaints with Alipore police station. The authorities, on their part, stated that readers and members are responsible for looking after their personal belongings. 

 The latest theft was reported last Friday when a cell phone and a credit card belonging to a reader was stolen while she was reading in Bhasha Bhavan. 

 The credit card was used to illegally buy goods worth Rs 1,200. The reader, a resident of Salt Lake, lodged a complaint with Alipore police station the next day.

 A similar theft had taken place on July 29, when another reader lost his cell phone from Bhasha Bhavan. 

 A bicycle of another member, Biplab Kumar Bose, parked in the corridor of the Old Annexe Building, was stolen. The unsuspecting member was busy reading in the newspaper section of the library?s reading room. 

 Days before that, the bicycle of Anil Shaw, a member of the library staff, was stolen from under the staircase of the main building. 

 ?According to the latest complaint, the reader kept her mobile phone, which was switched off, and her credit card on the table while she was reading. After some time, when she looked up, both were missing,? said an officer of Alipore police station said.

 ?When the bank was contacted, she was told that Rs 1,200 was withdrawn from her account. Outsiders are not allowed inside the reading rooms, therefore our suspicion points at fellow readers and the employees,? the officer added.

 Library director Sudhendu Mondol said no written complaints had been received. ?Looking after cell phones and other personal belongings is the sole responsibility of the members. We discourage members from bringing cell phones inside the library and advice them to switch these off while reading. Regarding security, we have recently recruited additional personnel from a private agency.?

 The staff association members, responsible for providing service to readers in the reading rooms, reiterated the authorities? version.

 ?We are helpless in this kind of situation, we are here to ensure service to the readers, not to keep a watch over their personal belongings. It is the responsibility of each member,? said Saibal Chakraborty, general secretary of the National Library Staff Association.

 ?A number of employees, as well as library members, use bicycles and we have space specifically earmarked for their parking. If things get stolen due to the owners? callousness, we are not responsible,? he added.

 The guards keep a vigil 24 hours of the day.

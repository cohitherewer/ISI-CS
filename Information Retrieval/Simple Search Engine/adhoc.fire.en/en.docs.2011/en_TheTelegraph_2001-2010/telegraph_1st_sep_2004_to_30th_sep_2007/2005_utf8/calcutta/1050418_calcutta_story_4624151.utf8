 Crash course in handling plastic waste

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jadavpur University, in collaboration with the Central Board of Workers? Education (CBWE), will organise a training programme for workers at plastic-recycling units and those engaged in collection of plastic waste.

 The university?s mechanical engineering department has developed a machine for recycling plastic waste and also evolved a technology to upgrade the existing machines.

 ?Our move is aimed at providing the proper knowledge to those involved in plastic waste recycling ? from collection to recycling to selling the recycled plastic to manufacturing units,? explained Sadhan Ghosh, a professor of the mechanical engineering department and principal investigator of plastic waste management.

 He had held talks with a bank to ensure interested entrepreneurs get loan for purchasing the new machine.

 The first batch will be trained on April 18 and 19 at the CBWE office on Sarat Bose Road. A fresh batch will be trained at least once every month at various places.

 Those who attend the training will be given pocket money of Rs 75 each, along with booklets and other material which provide details of scientific plastic waste management.

 At present, nearly 3,000 plastic-recycling units are operating across the city and more than 3,000 workers are engaged in the trade. 

 But the units are all functioning in a disorganised way ? neither do they have modern technology nor are those running them equipped with the latest knowhow.

 ?Once we train the workers, instal new machines and introduce a scientific system of plastic waste management, our efforts to rid the city of the plastic menace will be fruitful,?? said West Bengal Pollution Control Board member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar.

 The board, along with the Indian Plastic Federation, has started a pilot project in the Chetla-New Alipore area to collect plastic waste from households and send them to recycling units. 

 The system, officials said, has not been extended to other areas for want of trained collectors. 

 The urban development department has planned to introduce plastic waste management in Salt Lake with help from the pollution control board and the civic authorities.

 Portraying the muse

 Tagores literature and philosophy of life have served as a source of inspiration and motivation to poets, painters and even to common men. Tumi Ki Keboli Chhobi, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Charbak Sen, a self-taught artist, writer, photographer and filmmaker of repute, represents his personal tribute to the Poet. Comprising black-and-white paintings and drawings of Tagore, as well as vignettes and scenes from his works as visualised by Sen, the show embodies a trend of thought that connects and internalises the lives of Tagore?s characters with that of their creator. Demonstrating a mature skill in painting and sketching with pencil, charcoal and sauce powder, the portraits on display, with great attention to detail, present a rare, life-like quality.

 Event: Exhibition of paintings on Tagore by Charbak Sen

 When: Till May 31, 11 am - 8 pm

 Where: Gallery Kanishka?s, 2/1 Hindu- stan Road, Calcutta 29

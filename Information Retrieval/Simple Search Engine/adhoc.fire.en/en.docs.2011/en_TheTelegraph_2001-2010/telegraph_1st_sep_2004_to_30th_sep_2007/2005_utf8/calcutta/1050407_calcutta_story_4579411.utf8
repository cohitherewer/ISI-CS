The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Because the show must go on

 Name a Calcutta institute where the musical talents of big names cutting across generations, such as Ajoy Chakraborty, Manas Chakraborty, Ustad Sahid Parvez, Haimanti Shukla, Bappi Lahiri and Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta were nurtured? The answer is Children Music Conference, which Sunil Krishna Ghosh of the Pathuriaghata Ghosh family had initially started way back in 1957 as All India Children Music Conference.

 Although it closed after four years, it was revived in its present avatar in 1964. Since then, till 2004, this non-commercial organisation has held several concerts where child performers have been in the limelight. But the 85-year-old Ghosh, who is still remarkably fit in spite of his years, and strikingly handsome at that, fears that after him there will be nobody around to keep the show going.

 Sunil Krishnababu belongs to a musical family. His cousin Bhupendra Krishna had started the All Bengal Music Conference in 1934, which subsequently closed in 1953, and has remained since a cherished memory. Ghosh himself wanted to become a musician and had trained under Waliulla Khan of Dhaka and guitarist Sujit Nath. In spite of his deep interest he never became a musician. 

 After Ghosh revived his music organisation for children, he began to work out of 8 B, Shyampukur Street. Its president used to be Swami Prajnananda Maharaj. Now, it is former state governor Shyamal Sen.

 Personalities such as Uday Shankar, Deshabandhu Chittaranjan and his wife Basanti Debi, VG Jog, Jnanprakash Ghosh, Birendra Krishna Bhadra and Sukumar Sen had encouraged and inspired Ghosh to continue with his task of nurturing musical talent. Some well-known names continue to support him.

 The aim of the organisation is identifying talent from all over the country, grooming them from infancy and organising performances for them so that their talent is appreciated by a larger audience. What is outstanding is that there is never any talk of money. No question of selling either tickets or talent. 

 Ghosh has been associated with children?s organisations from his youth and this gave him the idea of opening the organisation. His only concern today is that Children Music Conference may die out after him.

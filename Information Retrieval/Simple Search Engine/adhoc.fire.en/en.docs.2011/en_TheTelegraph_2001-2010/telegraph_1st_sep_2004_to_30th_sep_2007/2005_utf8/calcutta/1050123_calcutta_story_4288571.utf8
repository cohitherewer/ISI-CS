The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Old vs New

 The chimes of change are being heard 

 louder than ever before. Calcutta is a city in transition, 

 with the trendy new coming up against the traditional old. 

 Here?s a quick look at what?s brewing...

 Coffee 

 House

 The look and feel are the same, 

 the product basket seems timeless, and the charm ? for a 

 few ? has not faded.

 ?Frankly, we are not interested 

 in making it a modern caf? outlet. This place has a different 

 appeal which still attracts footfall,? says Deepankar Dasgupta 

 of the most famous landmark on College Street since 1945.

 Despite the competition and changing 

 profiles of students (the prime target group), the adda 

 address attracts around 700 to 800 people on a normal day 

 (the count crosses the 1,000 mark on Saturdays). Coffee, 

 pakora and cold coffee top the choice chart. Quality 

 fare and affordable too ? the highest price tag on the menu 

 is boneless chilli chicken, Rs 40 ? is something the India 

 Coffee Workers Co-operative Society, running the show since 

 1958, vows never to dilute. But it is trying to minimise 

 losses, the only ?weak point?, through initiatives like 

 taking Coffee House offerings to institutions beyond College 

 Street and packaging culture with coffee.

 Coffee 

 Shop

 Place: Park Street;

 Age: 2 years; 

 Average daily footfall: 300-400

 Highest price tag: Kaapi Nirvana Rs 76,

 Lowest price tag: Chocochip Cookies Rs 15

 Crowd profile: The yuppie brigade?s hangout, from 

 students to young professionals.

 Strengths: The location, the vibrant atmosphere and 

 the fact that it?s in 

 Weakness: Space crunch at peak hours

 Voiceover: ?The variety is not available at traditional 

 coffee shops. Also, the ambience suits the young and trendy? 

 ? Sudipta Sengupta, GM, marketing

 College 

 Street

 Browse, what browse? College Street 

 still plays it by the book ? no-nonsense, over-the-counter 

 sales. ?From books on medical science to literature and 

 astrophysics to fiction, we offer everything. We also guide 

 our buyers,? boasts Arabinda Dasgupta of Dasgupta and Company, 

 in the business since 1886.

 Creating a comfortable ambience 

 can only be part of selling, he stresses, arguing why College 

 Street stores continue doing brisk business. ?I can offer 

 you more than 60,000 titles and that is my strength,? says 

 Dasgupta.

 The weakness? No parking facilities 

 and poor infrastructure in the area are all that the old-timer 

 would admit to.

 Crossword

 Name: Crossword

 Place: 8 Elgin Road

 Age: 9 months

 Average daily footfall: 1,000 (weekday); 1,500 (weekend)

 Average monthly sales: 4 lakh (weekday); Rs 7 lakh 

 (weekend)

 Strength: Depth in merchandise and browsing facility. 

 Customers are allowed to go through sealed books, take books 

 to the cafeteria and read.

 Voiceover: ?Earlier, people would send their drivers 

 with a slip to buy books from College Street. But the readers 

 now need to spend time with books... And this is a bookstore-cum-hangout?

 ? Sidharth Pansari, MD.

 Single-screen 

 Theatre

 Even as Priya Entertainment branches 

 out to Burdwan and Midnapore, its owner Arijit Dutta has 

 no option but to count down to the closure of Globe.

 Established in 1827 as Grand Opera 

 House, Globe has been an entertainment landmark for decades. 

 But over the past few years, it?s all gone wrong with plummeting 

 footfall and mounting maintenance costs.

 ?It pains me to shut it down but 

 I can?t go on losing anything between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000 

 every week,? says Dutta.

 While the price tag of everything 

 from the ticket to the popcorn may be just a fraction of 

 its multiplex counterparts, the appaling condition of the 

 theatre ? and its surroundings ? is reason enough for viewers 

 to steer clear. Even multiplex success stories like the 

 Chokher Balis and the Villages have struggled 

 to bring in the audiences.

 As Globe joins a growing list 

 of city cinemas closing down, the multiplex vs single-screen 

 theatres battle couldn?t be more lopsided. 

 Multiplex

 Name: INOX (Forum)

 Place: 10/3 Elgin Road

 Age: 16 months

 On offer: A ?truly international movie-viewing experience? 

 ? Christie?s projection system, Harkness screens and Dolby 

 digital sound. The attached caf? Refuel serves coleslaw 

 sandwich and bhelpuri. The events every week and 

 freebies on offer add to the movie-going experience.

 Average weekday ticket sales: 3,000

 Strengths: Up to 24 shows a day, up to 13 films to 

 choose from, a choice of movies from not only Bollywood, 

 Tollywood or Hollywood but even Tamil, Telugu and Punjabi 

 blockbusters. Large families can split up, choosing films 

 to go to, according to taste.

 Weakness: The price of the tickets, the food, the 

 car park ? all add up to a big costly outing.

 Way forward: A third INOX in town

 Voiceover: ?INOX is an entertainment destination. 

 INOX Forum is our most profitable property in India. The 

 returns from INOX City Centre are improving? ? Sumanta Ray, 

 regional marketing manager

 Garment 

 Shop

 Mohan?s at B-93 New Market has 

 seen it all ? the ups, the downs and the down under (also 

 known as Parkomat). This 35-year-old garments shop stocks 

 menswear and boasts a clientele that has stayed loyal for 

 10-15 years. The customer-is-god approach is what brings 

 them back, despite the behind-the-times setting. But the 

 survival kit is renovation, post-Parkomat of course. ?We 

 have lost out on the younger crowd because the malls provide 

 lifestyle along with clothes. Moreover, there is so much 

 available under one roof that people who are pressed for 

 time prefer going there,? admits Naresh Sakhrani.

 Retail 

 Megastore

 Name: Pantaloons; 

 Place: Gariahat and Camac Street

 Age: August 1997 (Gariahat); June 2001 (Camac Street)

 On offer: Apparel, cosmetics, perfumes, jewellery, 

 home linen, crockery and a cafeteria.

 Average monthly footfall: 75,000 at Gariahat and 

 1.1 lakh at Camac Street

 Strengths: Wide range; not too swanky to be intimidating, 

 not run-down either; motivated staff

 Weaknesses: Due to the ?next-door? image, the elite 

 stay away; failure to tap the marriage market.

 Way forward: A move towards fashion apparel and replenishment 

 of racks every 45 days, taking into account low attention 

 span of GenX buyers.

 Voiceover: ?It gives the new independent customer 

 freedom of choice and comparison, in a great ambience with 

 huge variety, young and enthusiastic sales associates and 

 no pressure to buy. It?s basically a chillout zone? ? R. 

 S. Rekhi, head operations (east), Pantaloon Retail (India) 

 Ltd

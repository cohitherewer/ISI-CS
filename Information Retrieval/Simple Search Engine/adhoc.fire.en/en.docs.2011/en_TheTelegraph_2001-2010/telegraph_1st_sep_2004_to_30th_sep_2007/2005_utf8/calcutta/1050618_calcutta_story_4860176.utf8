 Good deeds make happy wards

 OUR BUREAU

 The Kidderpore-Watgunge-Chetla belt used to be among the most neglected in the city. But in the past five years, a cross-section of residents admits, it had witnessed a spate of development activities.

 Residents of these areas, comprising wards 75 and 82, thank their councillors more than the civic board for this. Faiyaz Ahmad Khan, Left Front councillor of ward 75, and Firhad Hakim, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 82, both are popular in their areas.

 ?If a councillor has the zeal for development, it becomes immaterial who runs the board,? said Khan, who represented Kidderpore-Watgunge in the outgoing board.

 Over the years, water scarcity has been the bane of the area. The problem has eased a bit now, though buckets and containers can still be seen around corporation taps. The supply pressure is so low that taps are placed well below the ground level.

 Residents are hopeful that the ordeal will end soon, as a five-million-gallon water treatment-cum-booster station is set to be commissioned by August. The plant is being set up at a cost of Rs 36 crore.

 ?Water pressure continues to be low, but our councillor has assured us that it will be normal from August,? said Pramila Ghosh, a resident of Munshi Prem Chand Sarani. 

 The past five years have also seen completion of two community halls, construction of a library that is almost ready to be inaugurated and the filling up of a dry pool with water. 

 The last project (executed with funds from Asian Development Bank) is being billed as a breakthrough, as the pool at Leonard Square had dried up more than 50 years ago. Repeated attempts to fill it up with water proved futile.

 A few kilometres away is Chetla, represented in the outgoing board by Firhad Hakim. The area has at least 27 slums, which have seen no development for decades.

 Drinking water used to be a major problem. Over the past 20 years, the residents have grown accustomed to fetching water from taps sunk below the ground level. 

 Now, nearly 90 per cent of the problem has been solved. Pipelines have been drawn from a local factory, a booster pumping station has been commissioned in Kalighat and six deep tubewells have been sunk. 

 The slums have been given a facelift, with installation of halogen lamps and around 100 stand-pipes. Pavements, which used to be in poor shape earlier, have been improved.

 Chetla has also earned the distinction of being the only ward that has in place a proper ?plastic collection system?. A group of ragpickers has been assigned to go door-to-door and buy used plastic items. ?This prevent drains from getting clogged by plastic,? Hakim said.

 In stark contrast to 75 and 82, stands ward 76, where a host of basic civic amenities are still a far cry ? water crisis and a drainage problem persist, vats are not regularly cleaned and malaria has not been checked.

 Residents alleged that though the ward had been represented by a Trinamul councillor, Rama Basu, the party-run civic board had done nothing for them. 

 ?Our councillor is absolutely inaccessible. Who should we approach to with our problems? Last time, the people voted her as Mamata Banerjee herself had promised that her party would solve the problems,? said Mohan Talukdar, a local resident.

 Councillor Basu admitted that being a professional, she was not always available to the people, but stressed that she had done her bit for the ward.

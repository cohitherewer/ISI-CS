The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Comic capers

 Full of comic absurdities and hilarious situations, Garur Garir Headlight has all the ingredients to provide an evening of delightful entertainment. It introduces us to a wealthy widower, Swabalambi Ghosh, who nurtures a desire to set up a play-troupe. Seeking members who will form the group of his dreams, he advertises in the local newspaper. This initiates a flood of responses, albeit from persons inexperienced in the theatre profession. A confectioner expresses interest in being the playwright, and as for actors, a partly-deaf, retired army-man, a stammerer, a flirtatious youth, an opera actor, a couple of street-hoodlums and an extortionist respond to his queries. An eccentric individual fills up the post of the director. And, when no actress is available for the group?s maiden performance, Ghosh gets his sister-in-law to play the role. A researcher in human emotions and psychology, she starts experimenting her theories within the troupe, setting off a series of funny and, at the same time, interesting turn of events. Direction: Saroj Roy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Carnival that counts

 The prelims of The Great TTIS Challenge will see thousands of participants striving to make a mark in the mother of all school fetes. V. Shubha takes a peek at the action on Day One

 It?s like 300 school carnivals at one place,? said Karan Malhotra of Mother International School. And he wasn?t off the mark. The Great TTIS Challenge is indeed the biggest school fest-cum-carnival that Calcutta has ever seen. Over 2,100 schoolboys and girls from 109 schools in Calcutta and its suburbs are participating, all brimming with confidence.

 ?I am exceptional. That is why the crowd loved me,? beamed Ankit Aditya, in a sequinned orange sherwani, hair gelled into place. Just a minute ago, the Class VIII student from Barasat?s Aditya Academy had won quite a few hearts in the audience with his dimpled smile in the Fashion Parade. This was one of the highlights in the preliminary rounds that got underway at Rotary Sadan on Thursday.

 Come on DJs, it?s now the time/With a new blend, and with new sublime/You better stand up and cheer for us/For we?re really dangerous? ?I had to get the audience in the right mood before my teammates strutted the ramp. So I put together a few lines on the spot,? said S. Srinivasan of Class XI. ?Watch out for him tomorrow in the western music category. He has been into rap for the past seven years,? vouched Rupa Basu, teacher-coordinator of AK Ghosh Memorial.

 ?Never mind what my favourite song is. What?s yours?? asked Jimmy Tangree, pretending to be a caller on a live show on radio. ?That would be Hum kaale hain to kya hua... So here it is only on Red FM. Stay tuned in with Jeet,? retorted Debojyoti Majumdar of Salt Lake School, a participant in the War of RJs.

 Out on the lawns of Rotary Sadan, Agniva Ghosh and her friends from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan were in splits. Arre Jayshree..., she mimicked one of her favourite characters in a television serial (Hansa of Khichdi). Agniva was preparing for 3 Minutes to Fame, a talent hunt to spot the best entertainer.

 But Thursday was not all fun and games, as serious competition marked the prelims of Fusion Dance, Turn Coat (debate), Ad Spoof, Fashion Parade and War of RJs. The elimination rounds of some other contests like Antakshari, Street Play, Western Group (music), Eastern Solo (music) and Unconventional Orchestra will be conducted at the same venue on Friday and Saturday.

 The frenzy of the participating teams was indication enough of what awaits the campus crowd at The Great TTIS Challenge on December 15, 16 and 17 at Swabhumi. The festivities will get underway with a treasure hunt, a Beyblade championship, games, jugglers, fire-eaters and face painting.

 A flood of individual and team entries have poured in for Creative Writing, Collage, T-shirt painting, Tug of War, Flower Arrangement, Sudoku, Cartoon drawing and Fusion Dance.

 But all eyes will be on the Champion of Champions crown that would go to the best all-rounder. Apart from mega prizes, the winner will be adjudged the TTIS Face of the Year.

 ?We often get to see the same faces in other school festivals. Sometimes the same student wins in a particular event in all the fests for a few years in a row. Lack of competition is the reason,? pointed out Sumita Kar, a teacher with Delhi Public School, New Town.

 ?But winning in The Great TTIS Challenge would mean much more. Apart from being a lot of fun, it would be a more accurate assessment of where the participant stands,? added Ruby Agarwal of Howrah, as daughter Riddhi sashayed down the ramp in her mother?s wedding sari.

 Amongst loads of grand prizes to be won at the fete is the chance to learn radio jockeying with Red FM or intern with The Telegraph or design TTIS merchandise.

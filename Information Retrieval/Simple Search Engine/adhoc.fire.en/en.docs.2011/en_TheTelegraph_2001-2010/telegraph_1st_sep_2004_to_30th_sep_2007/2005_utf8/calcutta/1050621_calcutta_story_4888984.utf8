 Striker?s aim for English league

 - SAO PAOLO CRADLE FOR SOCCER PLAYER

 He?s a fan of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Raul and admires Paul Scholes for the way he ?gets into amazing positions all the time?. And 17-year-old Paul Chiraag is determined to get himself into a position of rare strength and make a pro career in the sport that he eats, sleeps and dreams.

 Bhaichung Bhutia, Indian football?s sole saleable icon, donned the colours of English Second Division outfit Bury FC and created quite a flutter back home. Chiraag, ?Jeet? to his parents and friends, who turns out for East Bengal Juniors in town, has his eyes set on an even higher plane. He wants to play in the Premiership!

 Daydreaming, most would say, dismissing his aspirations as out of sync with turf truths. But for Chiraag, this isn?t a mere flight of fancy. He has already flown to Brazil to train in a Sao Paolo academy, under the wings of East Bengal senior colleague Douglas Da Silva. The Brazilian rates him extremely highly and has taken active interest in trying to ensure proper exposure.

 Next stop for the Man United fan is Birmingham, in England, and a possible trial at any of the top clubs in the area. The talented Bengali rookie, who had turned out for the Singapore under-15 national side ? his father Pradeep was a Singapore-based NRI ? migrated to Calcutta three years ago.

 A torn ankle ligament and his ?O? level exams (from CIS) kept him away from his beloved football for a while, but the striker never lost sight of his goal. ?I had written to David Davies of the English FA, expressing my desire to make a career in soccer in Europe, and I was pleasantly surprised when I got a prompt reply,? smiled Chiraag, days before catching the flight to Sao Paolo.

 ?If we knew you were coming and when, we would try and get you some form of trial at a relevant academy or centre of excellence near to where you are staying? We would do everything we could to help,? Davies (?my cousin sister?s friend?s dad?) wrote back to him. And Chiraag was off, even pouncing on the Sao Paolo half-chance created by Douglas, with whom and the late Christiano Junior, he used to train at the Neelachal housing complex in Kasba.

 ?He?ll be in England for around 10 days for the trials, which will hopefully materialise, and we hope Mr Davies? acknowledgement should be good enough,? said mother Arunima, a constant fountain of encouragement.

 The boy himself has his feet firmly on the ground, though. ?I know I?d be thoroughly outclassed in Sao Paolo. But I shouldn?t be deflated and use it as a learning curve. My goal is playing for a European club and if I get a chance to show my skills in England, I will give it my best shot,? said Chiraag, who took his first soccer lessons from his grandfather, an accomplished player in his time.

 The Pauls, including four-year-old kid brother Roshan, are keeping their fingers crossed, and praying to ?Almighty Jesus to land him a club, because it means so much to him?. 

 Nonetheless, even if Jeet has to return empty-handed for the time being, his family and friends believe it would be just a short break before an emphatic restart.

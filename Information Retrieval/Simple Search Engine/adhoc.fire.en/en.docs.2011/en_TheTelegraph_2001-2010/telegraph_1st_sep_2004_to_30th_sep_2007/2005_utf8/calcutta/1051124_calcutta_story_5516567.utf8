 Ek Khiladi

 Ek Haseena 

 The story of a con man, trained in the underworld and with an easy grasp of lucre, law and lasses, stars Feroz Khan, Fardeen Khan, Koena Mitra and Kay Kay. Produced by Rangita Pritish Nandy.

 DVDs of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino movies may be piled up in his closet but that does not help writer-director Suparn Verma make a kick-ass film. He may call his dance bar Sin City and make his characters use the F-word freely, but he doesn?t have the cool quotient to con the viewer.

 The lead pair of Fardeen Khan and Koena Mitra is an apology in the name of acting. The khiladi may have a stylish dad and an American accent, the haseena a sexy figure and hardly any clothes to cover it, but emoting is just beyond them.

 The plot is too contrived and awfully verbose. And the smart twist at the end of it all doesn?t even have the shadow of the Shyamalan effect. As they say in cricket, the slower delivery just wasn?t carefully disguised.

 Slickly shot and edited, the picture-in-picture usage has finally come of age in Bollywood. Also, the start is definitely attention-grabbing.

 Great music by Pritam doesn?t let you sneak out for a smoke or a coke. Jhoom and Ishq mein jhootha stand out because of picturisation.

 The love-making scene between Fardeen and Koena is steamy and sexy. No-holds-barred for once, from the couch to the shower to the bed! 

 Last word: What the f*** (so says Fardeen)! Watch it, if you have to, as a series of music videos punctuated with poor storytelling and pathetic acting.

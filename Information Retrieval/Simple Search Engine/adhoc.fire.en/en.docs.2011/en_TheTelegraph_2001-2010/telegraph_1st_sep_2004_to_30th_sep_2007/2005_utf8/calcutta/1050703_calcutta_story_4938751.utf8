The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Panache pads up to pace

 The story and the drama make the Shoaib 

 Akhtar-Zohra Sehgal face-off such a hit

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Who 

 is this Shoaib Akhtar? The old lady (Zohra Sehgal) says 

 it rather disparagingly. And then to find out, she walks 

 into the stadium with a bat in her hand. Shoaib dismisses 

 her with a gesture that seems to convey, ?Go home naani, 

 play with your grandchildren.? She retorts, ?Dar gaya?? 

 Shoaib bites the bait. He runs in to bowl from the top of 

 his mark. The ball hits the glass before it reaches her. 

 A huge sigh of relief later, naani appreciates the 

 speed of Shoaib and the strength of the glass. The brand 

 is aptly named Stronglas.

 Why does this happen? In a crowd 

 of hundreds, most ads are not even hated ? they are ignored. 

 Some graduate to evoking a chuckle. And there are a few 

 like the Stronglas ad, which are enjoyed irrespective of 

 whether they are being seen for the 7th or the 17th time. 

 The curious issue is, what in an ad creates that viewer 

 affinity?

 I realise that this is a difficult 

 question. This recognition comes to me not because I know 

 enough advertising but because I know enough people in advertising. 

 Indeed, I asked around and the best answer I got was, it 

 is a very creative ad. To an uninitiated person like me 

 it did not make much sense.

 I was wondering what I would say 

 if someone asked me why I had seen Junglee 16 times. 

 Well, if that someone was my father, some 40 years back, 

 I would simply deny that I had seen the movie. But then 

 he has stopped asking me questions of any kind anymore. 

 Be that as it may, can I answer the question? Let me see. 

 Was it because it was Saira Banu?s debut film? Or was it 

 because of the Ehsan tera song? That I was a die-hard 

 Shammi Kapoor fan must have encouraged me, one way or the 

 other. True, none of these are complete answers, but in 

 some way each throws a little light on my madness. It is 

 beyond debate that the real explanation would lie beyond 

 these. Yet analysing these visible contributors often helps. 

 It may actually inspire another hit movie, not necessarily 

 another Junglee.

 What about the Stronglas ad? Were 

 there discernible contributors here as well? For the teenaged 

 girl crowd, the presence of visibly virile Shoaib must have 

 helped. Zohra Sehgal performed brilliantly; I, for one, 

 have become a fan of hers. Then there was this build-up 

 of tension between the two like in an India-Pakistan match. 

 Perhaps that gets to the viewer every time he sees this 

 ad. Or is it also the amity between Shoaib and the old lady 

 in the last shot? Maybe we all enjoyed that lump in our 

 throats. Again like in the case of Junglee, none 

 of these may offer the complete explanation but each carries 

 germs of truth. Indeed, beyond these exists something else 

 that possibly binds these golden dusts of truth together.

 The commercial message of this 

 advertising is very simple ? Stronglas is a strong glass. 

 For a start, this easy to understand claim has been further 

 translated for the viewer in a way that everyone can relate 

 to. Strong glass means even a Shoaib delivery cannot break 

 it. This undoubtedly viewer-friendly brand claim was still 

 to be woven into the emotional medium of the ad ? the story 

 and the drama.

 And there lies the greatest hook 

 of this ad. The story and the brand claim are not even like 

 two acts of a play, together they create a single theatre. 

 Maybe that is the trick. Maybe that is what my friends were 

 referring to as creative advertising. Stupid me.

 - Jadavpur debut for oldest branch of medicine in next session

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The pharmaceutical engineering department of Jadavpur University is set to have a new discipline

 Ayurveda, the most ancient branch of medicine in the country, is set to be included as a mainstream engineering and science subject at Jadavpur University (JU).

 The full-time four-year undergraduate course in ayurvedic pharmaceutical engineering, being launched in collaboration with the state health department, will make its debut in the next academic session, beginning in June 2006.

 It will be run at a private institute in Kalyani and the state government has agreed to allow the students to use its garden of herbal plants nearby for experiments.

 Barring two institutions in south India, no other centre in the country offers a full-time undergraduate course in ayurvedic pharmaceutical engineering.

 JU at present runs a full-time Bachelors course in pharmaceutical engineering (B. Pharm), meant for those interested in the production of allopathic drugs.

 ?Ayurveda is India?s oldest healthcare system and has always been in demand among people of all ages. Our decision to introduce the course will make this branch of medicine even more popular,? said Partha Pratim Biswas, a member of JU?s executive council.

 The university?s decision to run the course is in tune with a recent directive of the state government and the Centre, making it mandatory for every ayurvedic drug-manufacturing unit to have at least one pharmaceutical engineer.

 Being an ancient discipline, ayurveda is still associated with traditional ideas and concepts. ?We aim to produce engineers, as desired by the Centre and the state government, who will use these traditional concepts and also apply techniques of modern science and engineering,? Biswas pointed out.

 For instance, only iron hammers and pots are now used for smashing ingredients used for making ayurvedic drugs. The new course will teach students how an alternative method, approved of by modern science, can be employed for the purpose. Also, the students will learn the latest knowhow for maintaining the temperature of the herbal extracts while preparing medicines. 

 The JU course will start with 60 students, who will be admitted through the state joint entrance examinations.

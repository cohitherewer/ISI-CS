The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Nicco Park, in Salt Lake, is a popular amusement park. Every day, thousands 

of visitors, including tourists from other states and even abroad, come to this 

park. Most prefer taking the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and entering Salt Lake 

via Chingrihata. However, the road and footpaths from Chingrihata to Nicco Park 

are not up to the mark. The authorities should maintain the stretch throughout 

the year.

 A large number of voluntary and non-governmental organisations are going around 

the city collecting funds for the tsunami victims. Though the intention and the 

effort are praiseworthy, the organisations are often concentrating on certain 

localities of the city, giving the residents a harrowing time. Some are even competing 

with each other in the donation-collection drives. The clubs and organisations 

should rise above such partisan attitude and should come together in the noble 

effort. They can decide on which pockets each should concentrate on and, in the 

process, save both time and energy.

 My family and I were in for a shock when we went to a circus on Park Circus 

maidan on December 28. Along with the fire game, a few indecently-clad women also 

performed a belly dance. On the other hand, the trapeze show lasted only three 

minutes and we hardly noticed the clowns. It was a very sad experience. Why do 

circuses need to transform themselves in this manner to survive competition from 

other forms of entertainment?

 Telefilms in Tolly recovery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Is budget a constraint if the story is good? Will telefilms help Tollywood recover? Can a forum of artistes and other film industry members be formed to set product standards? 

 These and more questions and suggestions emerged at the inauguration of the 3rd Bangla Telefilm Festival at Nandan on Friday.

 Stars from the small and big screens, producers, directors and satellite channel head honchos descended at the venue to provide a boost to telefilms, 20 of which will be screened at the nine-day festival that gets underway on Saturday.

 ?There are a lot of social issues that, due to commercial aspects, directors are unable to deal with on the big screen. The small screen, particularly telefilms, allow that,? said Ansu Sur, director of Calcutta Film Festival, which is co-organising the event. ?But I urge the channels to increase the budget, which is getting smaller by the day,? he added.

 While both Tara chief Ratikant Basu and Zee Bangla head J. K Ray agreed with Sur, Basu insisted that ?when there is a good story, the budget will be found?.

 But it was veteran actress Sabitri Chatterjee who stole the show with her impromptu speech. ?I had no idea that for the past two years, such a festival is being organised and had Bumba (Prosenjit) not invited me for this programme today, I would never know,? she said. ?In our times, we had a lot of talented people who only gave to the industry and we did not have the medium to honour them. I?m glad that times have changed,? Chatterjee observed.

 ?This festival is also for study and discussion of telefilms,? said actor Soumitra Chatterjee. ?And I hope it helps to spread the scope of the genre, benefiting the Bengali film industry.?

 Satyajit Ray?s documentary Rabindranath was also screened on the occasion.

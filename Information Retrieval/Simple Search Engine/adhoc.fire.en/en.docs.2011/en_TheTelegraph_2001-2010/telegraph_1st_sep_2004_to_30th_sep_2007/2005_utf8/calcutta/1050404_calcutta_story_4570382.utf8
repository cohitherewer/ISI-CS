 The Roman Catholic community of Calcutta went into mourning on Sunday, with special Mass being offered in all the 40-plus churches and chapels located within the city limits in memory of Pope John Paul II.

 The archbishop of the Calcutta archdiocese, Lucas Sircar, expressed his deep sorrow from the Basilica of Our Lady of Bandel, in Hooghly, where he has been away for the past few days.

 ?I came here to pray for the Holy Father?s swift recovery four days ago. I received news of his demise by SMS around 2 am, and have decided to stay on here and pray to God so that his soul rests in peace in His House. It is a very sad time for us. The Pope was a global messenger of peace,? the archbishop said.

 He added that three Indian cardinals will travel to the Vatican in a day or two to vote for the next Pope, though no representative of the Calcutta Archdiocese or of the West Bengal Roman Catholic community will go.

 Representatives of the Calcutta Archdiocese said the 200-odd Roman Catholic educational institutions in the city ?will be requested to observe a holiday on the day of the funeral?, and a public mass will be organised for all community members on that day.

 The Sunday of Divine Mercy, as the Sunday following Easter Sunday was called by Pope John Paul II, coincided with the day of his death, and parallels were drawn between him and Jesus during Mass in several churches.

 At Mother House, on AJC Bose Road, a notice on a blackboard read: ?Our dearest Holy Father went Home to God at 1.07 am IST.? Inside, around 500 sisters of the Missionaries of Charity were offering a special Mass, conducted by Fr Francoise Marie from France. 

 In his sermon, Fr Marie said: ?For us, the Holy Father has not died; He has gone to the Life, to the House of God. He is going during Easter, for the feast of Divine Mercy ? he was the channel of mercy.?

 Sister Nirmala, superior general, Missionaries of Charity, said: ?I will be going to the Vatican for the funeral.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ride or riddance prod for CSTC

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Improve your performance or make way. 

 That?s the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s new message to recalcitrant Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) employees.

 The government has already told the CSTC authorities that it will not be able to continue subsidies, and the corporation will have to take steps to become self-reliant by increasing its revenues and make maximum utilisation of its fleet. 

 The government is also in the process of restructuring the corporation by downsizing staff strength with financial assistance from the UK?s Department for International Development.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has conveyed the government?s message ? increase revenues and productivity or pack up ? to CSTC officers in a recent meeting with his departmental officers.

 The CSTC plies nearly 1,200 vehicles on different city and long-distance routes, with manpower of over 8,000.

 On Tuesday, CSTC bosses held a marathon meeting with depot managers, engineers and inspectors and made it clear that they would have to improve their performance or face stern action.

 CSTC managing director Asok Bhattacharya said the move is aimed at improving work culture and increasing productivity. ?I have reminded all the depot managers and inspectors that we are supposed to serve the public. We will not tolerate any irresponsibility or dereliction of duty that leads to commuters suffering and the CSTC getting a bad name,?? Bhattacharya said.

 He said the CSTC had organised workshops and orientation camps to improve the performance of drivers and conductors. Yet, most buses are neither properly checked and cleaned nor repaired before they set out on their journey. State buses stranded mid-journey are a common sight. 

 Passengers pay for their remiss, as their tickets are not refunded. The buses often speed past stops even if passengers are waiting. Thus, state buses have become synonymous with inefficiency.

 ?We are trying to restore people?s faith in the state bus. The organisation is getting a bad name owing to a small section of irresponsible employees. They must change their attitude and we are involving the employees? association in this exercise,?? said the CSTC managing director.

 A team comprising senior officers will be set up to conduct surprise checks on depots to ensure that all vehicles are properly maintained.

 ?We have already increased our income by Rs 2 lakh a day from ticket sales. Our target is a daily income of Rs 18.5 lakh to Rs 25 lakh by the end of this year and we are taking all steps to meet the target,?? the managing director signed off.

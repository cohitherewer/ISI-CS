The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All?s fair in race to beat fairer sex

 - After gels, lotions and salon sessions, new male whitewash cream sweeps market clean

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Saif Ali Khan: Looks good

 Scene One: A 19-year-old boy slides into a departmental store in central Calcutta, looks shiftily around and then pops the question, softly: ?Do you have XXXX?. Then, surreptitiously: ?Are you sure this will work?? No, he is not buying his first condom, but the fairness cream meant for men, launched in September-end.

 Scene Two: A sister picks up a special gift for Bhaiphonta. Not chocolates or cell phones, it?s a full pack of fairness cream for her teenaged brother.

 ?Mirror, mirror on the wall/Who?s the fairest of them all?? The query has remained the same, but the voice is often a baritone. Men are fair game for the beauty business as the M amp;B adage of tall, dark and handsome is whitewashed.

 The over-the-counter sale of the new male fairness cream is a strong market measure. ?For the first four weeks, we had set a sales target of Rs 50 lakh for Calcutta. The target was achieved in a little over two weeks, and without celebrity endorsement. We did not expect this in Calcutta,? admits Mohan Goenka, director, Emami.

 The Calcutta male may not exactly be sneaking into girls? hostels (as shown in the advertisement for the fairness cream) yet, but he?s sure raiding the racks. At C3, the men are picking up hair care and skin care products as if fairness is more than just a fad. ?We do not even have any specific rack for men in this category, but the hair conditioners, gels, skin lotions and moisturisers are moving fast,? says a spokesperson for C3.

 An equal number of men and women are walking into beauty salons. ?The need to look good is now being expressed because of the availability of both icons and services. We have people coming in wanting to look nice and fair. Their icons are Bollywood boys like Saif Ali Khan, John Abraham or Salman Khan,? says Varsha Mitra, regional manager, Kaya Skin Clinic.

 John Abraham: Icon 

Skin treatment, hair treatment, removal of unwanted hair from the face, manicure, pedicure ? all that the metrosexual male wants is everything. Even average billing of Rs 5,000 for one sitting doesn?t dissuade him.

 The trend, they say, is influenced by a major shift in the way girls look at boys, not just in the dating game but also in the marriage market. ?The words ?fair? and ?handsome? have been recent additions. More than 50 per cent women visiting our site use them. Now, when men post their profiles, they emphasise their skin tone and looks, alongside religion and social status,? says Biswapriyo Chandra, regional manager (east), BharatMatrimony.

 And regular users insist that painstaking skin-care tactics are more than just skin deep. ?If you look good, you feel good and draw more attention from the fairer sex,? says young businessman Imtiaz Ahmed, a regular when it comes to fairness creams and beauty salons.

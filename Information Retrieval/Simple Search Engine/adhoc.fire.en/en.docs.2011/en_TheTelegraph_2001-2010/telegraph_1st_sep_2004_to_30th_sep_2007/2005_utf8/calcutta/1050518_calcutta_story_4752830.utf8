 Lee Alison Sibley on the ramp: One of the fun moments captured on camera for the documentary

By now, the Sibleys will have packed. After three years in Calcutta, the American diplomat couple is set to fly back on Wednesday night. But they have also packed for delivery a gift that will present a brighter face of Calcutta in Washington D.C.

 Last December, over Thanksgiving dinner, the Sibleys mooted a film on the city to be directed by a team of Calcutta University mass communications students, guided by Mahendra Kumar, an associate of Ritwik Ghatak.

 It was my idea, smiles Lee Alison, at a farewell party on the Srijan rooftop. Officers in the US are reluctant to take up postings in Calcutta because of the negative image of the city ? all disease, poverty and dirt. There are not enough documents on the city for them to see either. It will be lodged at the Overseas Broadcasting Centre to be viewed by every officer coming to Calcutta.

 The 15-minute film is an overview of where an officer of the consulate can stay, shop and play, zooming in on the chambers of the consuls residence as well as the Maidan and the malls. We made a list of the things we love to do in Calcutta and handed it over to Sanghita, George says. 

 Recalls Sanghita Chatterjee, director and conceptualiser: On Saraswati puja, we set out with the camera. George wanted to visit the Botanical Gardens and talk about the hash group. The visit to the Calcutta International School, where children of the diplomats study, proved lucky as it was the sports day there. The Maidan took time as many shots were wasted in trying to catch the consul connect a delivery with the bat. The Sibleys work with the Samaritan Help Mission in Howrah was canned as well.

 Few back home know Calcutta to be the cultural capital of India. Also its such a friendly place. I have talked about that while being honest about the problems, explains George, who opted to work here after hearing of the city from friends.

 What is not talked about in the film is Lee Alisons Rabindrasangeet (Phoole phooley dholey dholey) which makes the melodious background. 

 She breaks into the song on her way out. Ki jani kisher lagi pran kore hai hai ? I know what my heart will miss. It is Calcutta, she sighs.

 But they have made sure that the city will not miss a fair representation when their successors take their posting pick.

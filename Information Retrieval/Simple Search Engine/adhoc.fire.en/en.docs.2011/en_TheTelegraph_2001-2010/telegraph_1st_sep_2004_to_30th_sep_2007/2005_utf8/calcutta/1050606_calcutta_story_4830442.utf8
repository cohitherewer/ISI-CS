 Hospital revamps kid ward

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Not just a friendly ambience, but also new equipment to take better care of toddlers. 

 That?s the refurbished and revamped paediatric ward at Mission of Mercy (MOM) Hospital and Research Centre. The Park Street hospital inaugurated its improved children?s ward on Saturday, in the presence of its co-founder Huldah Buntain on the 16th death anniversary of her husband Mark.

 The two missionaries came to India in October 1954. Fifty years later, Buntain continues to work for the underprivileged in Calcutta and the eastern region. MOM Hospital offers over 40 per cent of its patients free treatment. 

 Although upgrading the ward will be an ongoing process, a ventilator and new equipment for the neonatal intensive care unit have so far been procured. Around Rs 20 lakh has already been spent on the bright and cheerful ward, which has 30 beds. 

 ?MOM is a multi-speciality hospital, with over 100,000 patients a year. But it was once known for its paediatric care. That has been diluted over time, but we are hoping to bring it back into focus,? said executive director Sanjay Prasad. 

 ?Five children from our blind school have been operated on here, and have regained partial vision,? said Buntain. ?All the money is from donations, and we really want to thank our donors, in India and Calcutta of course, but also in Germany, Austria, UK, USA, Australia and Canada.? 

 In about two months, the hospital?s diagnostic centre will also be upgraded. The initial investment is Rs 1 crore, to buy new equipment. 

 ?It will be housed on the first floor of AG Towers, and will have a blood bank as well as a pathology lab, where all types of tests can be done,? explained Prasad. The nursing school, currently on the first floor, will be shifted to a floor above, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Streetcars, as desired

 JAYANTA BASU 

 Almost a decade ago, Melbourne tram conductor Roberto D?Andrea and artist-cum-activist Mick (earlier Michael) Douglas came to Calcutta to drum up support for the city?s struggling tramways, and the project Tramjatra ? a symbol of friendship through trams between the two cities ? was born. 

 The project came to fruition, as it were, with the formal release in the city of the commemorative book Tramjatra ? Imagining Melbourne and Calcutta by Tramways published by Yoda last Thursday. 

 ?In many ways, the project has been a unique journey over the past decade, with so many new people joining the effort, almost like a tramway ride. The book is meant to be a documentation of that journey,? observes Douglas, its editor. 

 Roberto, who had set the ball rolling by striking up friendship with tram workers of Belgachhia depot in 1994, believes that ?Tramjatra catalysed favourable responses for the continuation of a system, which has come back almost throughout the world.?

 While writers Buddhadeb Guha and Nabaneeta Dev Sen launched the book, there was a public relaunch by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and Calcutta Tramways Company officers at the Esplanade tram depot the next day.

 The project has been a spin-off of a letter (documented in the book) from city-based tram activist Debasish Bhattacharya, who in 1994 had appealed to international experts for ?help? to ensure the continuation of trams in the city. The state government had decided to phase out trams then. 

 ?The tramways system is being forced to die a natural death,? says Bhattacharya, founder-member of Tramjatra. 

 ?The project has provided a platform to raise relevant issues,? adds another participant in the project. 

 Tramjatra 2005 has a novel component called ?shared lung? ? a striking blue-and-white logo depicting the tram routes of Calcutta and Melbourne in the double lobes of that body part. 

 On Friday, city tram conductors wore bright blue shirts emblazoned with the logo instead of their khaki uniforms. Calcutta-based NGO, Tomorrow?s Foundation, that works with destitute children of Kalighat, made the shirts. On Saturday, minister Chakraborty, too, donned a ?shared lung? shirt.

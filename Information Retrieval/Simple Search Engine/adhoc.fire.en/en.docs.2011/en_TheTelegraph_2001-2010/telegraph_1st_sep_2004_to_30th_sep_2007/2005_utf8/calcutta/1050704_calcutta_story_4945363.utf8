The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Grants review has varsity on backfoot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University had been caught unawares when it received a University Grants Commission (UGC) directive a few weeks ago, asking it to provide details of academic activities of each department to become eligible for funds under the 10th Plan.

 The directive, a mid-term review of various projects sponsored under the Plan, was a clear indication that the Centre would no longer encourage outright grants to universities. This was the first time, officials said, that the UGC had asked for details of the functioning of all 69 departments and what the authorities proposed to do to further their activities.

 Earlier, the UGC would satisfy itself only with utilisation certificates of previous grants before making fresh allotments.

 In the latest directive, which had set June 16 as the deadline for sending replies, the UGC asked how many teachers had participated in seminars in the past three years. The university was also required to mention the venues and the names of the organisers of the seminars.

 The questionnaire asked for the number of teachers who had visited abroad for attending seminars, the number of seats in each course run by the university, the response from applicants and the occupancy.

 ?The university found itself in a spot to answer some of the queries,? said an official engaged in preparing the report. ?Of around 600 teachers, only a few had attended seminars in the past three years.?

 ?The questions indicate the UGC is now stressing overall academic achievements. It will no longer provide grants just by judging project-wise performance. The flow of money will be blocked if the overall performance is not satisfactory,? said an official overseeing projects funded by the UGC and other Central government agencies.

 Though bulk of the university?s annual expenditure of around Rs 90 crore is provided by the state government, the UGC also grants a substantial amount ? around Rs 10 crore ? for research.

 Pro vice-chancellor Suranjan Das , also a member of the UGC, said the university had compiled a report containing answers to the queries. ?A team went to Delhi last week and submitted the report.?

 Stuck below, stalled above: Passengers turn 

pedestrians with the bridge off limits to vehicular traffic during the barge hit 

 The article ?Vehicles take a walk?, June 28, portrays 

a sad picture of an appallingly unconcerned state government that sponsored a 

bandh to make up for its failure to force the Centre not to hike fuel prices. 

 The Alimuddin Street bosses even had the gall to congratulate the people of West Bengal for being spontaneous partners in the bandh. The transport minister?s advice of walking to workplaces was a crude joke. Did he himself walk to Writers? Buildings? 

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had called a bandh for the same reason on December 3, 2004. The Left Front, however, chose to oppose that bandh tooth and nail. State CPM secretary Anil Biswas had then blithely said: ?Bandhs have now lost their relevance... people will not accept such bandhs.? 

 What is most ludicrous is that the Left Front is supporting the Congress-led government at the Centre that was instrumental behind the rise in the petrol price. 

 Peoples? interest hardly matters to the Left. If it did, the state government would slash the additional tax levied on fuel in West Bengal. In comparison to the neighbouring state of Jharkhand, a litre of petrol and diesel costs more in Bengal by Rs 2. 

 Since bandhs have become an integral part of life in Bengal, the state should make arrangements to ensure that healthcare does not suffer on such days. 

 Because of the bandh, surgeries were put on hold. The non-availability of transport also kept patients away from health centres. Even outstation patients were stranded at railway stations. Isn?t it the obligation of the state government to make transport available at strategic points so that people do not suffer due to the whims of the party? 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, in the process of freeing himself from the shackles of militant trade unionism, should appreciate that bandh serves no useful purpose. Rather, it acts as an impediment to industrialisation.

 Apropos the report ?Barge bang off course?, June 25, it is almost unbelievable how a vessel?s mast rammed against the belly of Calcutta?s most famous landmark, the Howrah bridge, and damaged it badly. Such an incident, the first in the history of the 62-year-old bridge, portrays Calcutta Port Trust authorities and River Traffic Police in poor light. Both failed miserably to safeguard the most enduring icon of the city. Not only were the port authorities and river cops not vigilant, they had also lacked the foresight to take pre-emptive measures. River Traffic Police launches should have been patrolling the area round the clock. Had even one launch been there, MV Moni would not have dared to head down the course it did with the tide rising. The river cops arrived on the scene only after the damage was done. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road.

The collision of the steamer mast with the Howrah 

bridge caused a monetary loss of Rs 1.5 crore in addition to paralysing traffic 

to and from Howrah station, thus causing untold hardship to thousands of people. 

Callousness on part of the crew of MV Moni was responsible for the calamity. 

The inland water authority must counsel vessel crew so that such mishaps are not 

repeated. 

B.N. Bose,

It is distressing to learn that the 62-year-old Howrah 

bridge was damaged after being hit by the mast of a barge. Given the historic 

significance of the bridge and the nostalgia associated with it, foolproof measures 

should have been taken by the port trust to ensure its safety. 

Prahlad Agarwala,

Majdia, Nadia.

The sailor of the barge that got stuck under the bridge 

should have gauged that it was dangerous to sail along the route he took. One 

wonders why he did not try to stop the vessel, when he could see the bridge was 

too low to allow easy passage. The authorities should not resort to stop-gap measures 

that are easier on the pocket while repairing the bridge. 

Arjun Chaudhuri, 

Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane. 

The Howrah bridge is a part of Calcutta?s heritage. 

Most residents attach deep sentimental value to the bridge. Calcutta Port Trust 

should ensure that every endeavour is made to keep the bridge in good condition 

and any sort of violation should be dealt with firmly. The owner of MV Moni 

might pay for the repair of the bridge, but he cannot ever compensate for 

the wound he inflicted on the hearts of each and every Calcuttan. 

Purnima Vasudeva, 

Alipore. 

It is shocking that the Calcutta Port Trust authorities 

had ignored a directive three years ago from the high court to dredge the Hooghly, 

This caused more silt to accumulate on the river bed. Although Rs 400 crore is 

allotted annually for the upkeep of the Hooghly, their lackadaisical attitude 

has defeated the intentions of the government. 

Govinda Bakshi, 

Budge Budge. 

 The claim by Sajal Datta, president of the association of 12 ?top? private hospitals in the city, that the credibility of only the ?middle-level? nursing homes in the city might have been tarnished in recent times is ridiculous (Health tourism takes flight out, June 27). The impressive infrastructure of top private hospitals may have little to do with the treatment of patients. Hospitals do not treat patients, doctors do. Does Datta mean to say that doctors who work in the top hospitals are more efficient than those in middle-level nursing homes? 

 The argument that better doctors are affiliated with top hospitals does not have any rationale in the Indian medical scenario. It is common knowledge that they move from hospital to hospital to maximise their earnings. 

Kunal Saha, 

Ohio, USA.

 Bikash Bhattacharya broke his leg in a pothole before the municipal election. All pedestrians risk their life and limb but such accidents get little publicity unless they happen to a mayoral candidate. Bhattacharya?s is back on foot as the new mayor (Mayor in repose, June 23) Now he should give priority to repairing the streets. 

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

Bandpur. 

 It is astonishing how a seven-month-old baby girl was abandoned on a pavement on BT Road in broad daylight (Dumped infant finds new home, June 25). Incidents of babies being abandoned have become common. Something must be done to save these babies. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala.

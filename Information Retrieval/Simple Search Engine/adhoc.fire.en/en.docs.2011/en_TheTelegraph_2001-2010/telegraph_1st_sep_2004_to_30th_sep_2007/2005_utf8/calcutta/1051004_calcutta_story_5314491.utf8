 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 It was a night of fireworks, a wild and cheering crowd, a drizzle that stopped short of being a wet blanket on the proceedings, and a meeting of the two Bengals to create some memorable music.

 Rock Jugalbandi Chapter II saw nearly 15,000 music enthusiasts filling up the enclosure at the Salt Lake stadium helipad grounds on Sunday night. Had it not been for the rain during the day, organisers later claimed, the number would have been much higher.

 LRB from Bangladesh was the prime attraction last time, but this time around, Ayub Bachchu and his men were overshadowed by the presence of fellow countryman James and his Nagarbaul.

 It was Jamess first public performance in the city. I had heard so much about the music lovers in Calcutta, but somehow, I didnt get the chance to sing here all these years, the artiste had told GoodLife prior to the Sunday gig.

 When he did sing, though, the bond with the audience was instant.

 Chants of joy guru greeted the man in a black kurta, jeans and trademark long curly locks.

 His response: Ekhane dushtu chheler dol achhe? Tahole ektu dushtumi hok (Is there a gang of naughty boys here? Then lets make some mischief)!

 Then on, it was a run through classics like Ma and Didimoni, accompanied by a tight backing band and some blazing guitar solos from the singer. 

 By the time James ? inspired by bands like Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and Dire Straits, and folk music on the streets of Bangladesh ? finished and allowed LRB to take over, his first night out in the city was a super success.

 The evening had opened with Bikram Ghoshs Folktail. Chandrabindoo then kicked off the band act. 

 Through hits like Juju and Brahma Janen, the band which leaves on its US tour this week, set the mood for the music to follow. 

 The fireworks were a regular affair ? raining confetti on the crowd ? from Chandrabindoo itself.

 The only jarring (and noisy) note of the concert was struck by Fossils. The band was too busy aping the antics of heavy metal acts on stage. Gimmickry with feedback and indecipherable lyrics didnt help much either.

 LRB was its usual rocking self, with frontman Ayub Bachchu engaging the crowd in singalongs and performing his medley of hits.

 The night ended, a little after 10 pm, with a jam involving Ayub Bachchu, Bikram Ghosh and guest drummer Nondon Bagchi.

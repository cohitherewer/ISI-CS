 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) does not want to lose out on revenue this year from stalls set up in parks during the Puja.

 The practice till last year was that the organisers shared with the civic body only a fraction of what they would charge from the stalls. The authorities had often alleged that organisers would never report the exact number of stalls they had allowed to come up on the pandal premises.

 This Puja, the CMC will form a committee that will visit all mega and medium-budget pujas and count the number of stalls, the size of each and the total area of the fairs.

 The organisers will be made to pay for each of the stalls. The authorities have already informed some mega-budget organisers, such as Park Circus, Ballygunge and Deshapriya Park, about the decision.

 Details of how to go about the job have been passed on to all borough heads.

 ?Puja fairs are essentially commercial activities, bringing in money for the organisers,? said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

 ?Organisers often get away with quoting a figure far less than the real count. The civic body could not do anything as there was no system to cross-check the claims. This led to a considerable loss of revenue for us,? Khan added.

 The civic fathers woke up to the extent they are fleeced by organisers after an inspection of Rathyatra fair grounds.

 Almost everywhere, the organisers were found to have duped the CMC on the stall count. The officials had visited Chetla Park, Ramlila Maidan and Park Circus, among others.

 Durga puja organisers, perhaps expectedly, are not happy with what the civic body is planning to do. ?Last year, we had paid Rs 2.5 lakh to the civic coffers for the fair. It seems the authorities are looking for more this year,? said Raghu Dasgputa, of the Park Circus Puja Committee.

 ?We work on a tight budget and most of our funds come from advertisements and banners. If we are forced to pay more, things may take an unhealthy turn,? he warned.

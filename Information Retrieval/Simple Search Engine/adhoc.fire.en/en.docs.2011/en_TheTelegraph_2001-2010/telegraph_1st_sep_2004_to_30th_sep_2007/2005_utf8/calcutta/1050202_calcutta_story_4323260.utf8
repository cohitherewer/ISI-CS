 A woman?s cry for justice

 Despite the hue and cry about the need for womens emancipation in the modern civilized world, a large section of women in our society continues to live in abject misery and humiliation. Mostly predominant among the backward classes, what makes the condition of women belonging to minority communities all the more pitiable is that any attempt to protest or escape from subordination and oppression is bound to be futile. Kasba Arghya?s Simar brings to focus the flaws and imperfections of a social system that prevents women from asserting their rights and, in so doing, indirectly supports their abuse and violation. Sirin, the young wife of Akhtar Hazi, is victimised by society on the grounds that she does not respond to the old man?s carnal instincts. Ironically, Minu, Hazi?s daughter from a previous marriage, can share Sirin?s personal trauma. After a failed suicide attempt and a complete loss of faith in society?s laws, Sirin is left with two options: meekly returning to the existing fold or surviving against the odds on her own. Direction: Manish Mitra.

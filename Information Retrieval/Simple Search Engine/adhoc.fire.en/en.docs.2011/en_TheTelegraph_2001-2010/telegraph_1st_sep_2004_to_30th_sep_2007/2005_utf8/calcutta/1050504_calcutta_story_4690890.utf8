 Driven by faith and a faint sliver of hope, a frantic father has come to Calcutta from Pondicherry in search of his son. The air force man?s family, posted at Car Nicobar, was torn asunder when the December 26 tsunami struck the Andamans. He saved his wife from the waters and was reunited with his eight-year-old daughter. But son 12-year-old V. Sreenivasan, or Arvind, has not been seen since the killer waves crushed the island.

 Now, information that many evacuees have been brought to Calcutta and an astrologer?s word that the boy is alive, possibly in a place called ?Bankura or Bankra?, has brought Sergeant M. Venkatraman to town.

 After arriving in Bengal on April 28, the determined father first headed for Bankura. A search there produced no results, so he went to Bankra, in Howrah. With no luck there either, Venkatraman contacted Childline, which helped him register a missing person?s report at Bhabani Bhavan and Lalbazar. The search will now begin in homes across the city, on station platforms and through Childline ? an emergency service for distressed children ? in the districts of Bengal, in Chennai and in Port Blair.

 The morning after Christmas, Venkatraman?s life changed, forever. The early riser was watching TV when he felt the quake. He, wife Uma, son Arvind and daughter Vaishnavi rushed out of the house. Knowing that another quake could soon follow, they, along with distressed neighbours, waited outside. ?Already, we could hear howls ? death howls ? around us,? he recalls. Then, from the shore around 150 m away, the screams were heard. The wave was on its way.

 ?My friends had two scooters. I put my daughter on one and my son on the other,? he explains. Then, he and Uma ran as far as they could. ?I told her that this is the last time we will see each other? That if there is another life we will be together again.? But they didn?t give up hope. Uma held on to her husband?s legs, the only anchor she could find.

 The wave hit, and soon, Venkatraman could no longer feel his wife?s weight. He managed to keep his head above water and grabbed a tree. ?Then I saw a finger above the water. I grabbed the arm. It was my wife.? After he shook her back to consciousness, the struggle continued as the waters kept rising, with wave after wave battering the island.

 As the water receded, Venkatraman put his wife on a felled tree trunk, while he half-floated, half-walked, with a badly injured knee. They reached the district headquarters in Malacca, and then headed towards Kakana village, on slightly higher ground. There, Vaishnavi was crying for her mother, in shock, but safe. Arvind could not be found.

 By the next day, shock had given way to fear. ?We thought the island had broken and it would drown any moment,? recounts Venkatraman.

 He tried to persuade his wife to leave with their daughter, but she refused. 

 So, when an aircraft landed to take survivors to Chennai, the three of them left together.

 In Chennai, the search continued for a few days. Finally, they went home to Pondicherry.

 ?We would visit five or six temples every day,? says the serviceman, who joined his unit of choice in Tambaram, Chennai, after a month?s leave. A number of astrologers were consulted. ?They all said that my son was alive, 100 per cent.?

 That, coupled with information about evacuation to Calcutta, prompted Venkatraman and his two brothers-in-law to make the trip.

 ?God never works directly. He works through people around us,? says the father, determined not to leave town without his son.

 (The father?s plea: If anyone has information about Arvind, please contact Childline at 26439793/4 or 9830798595 or the family in Pondicherry at (0413) 2341337, 2250224.)

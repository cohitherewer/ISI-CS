The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Find me the festive spirit

Why does Puja advertising focus on what people do during 

those magic days, rather than what they feel?

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

Vicky 

was not in Calcutta during the Pujas. On the morning of Mahalaya, when at least 

half the city was feigning uninterrupted attention to the radio programme, he 

was being served a cold dinner at 39,000 ft above sea level. Through the window 

he was foolishly looking eastwards searching for the first rays of sunlight. The 

darkness that greeted him betrayed no ethnicity. Only the Beethoven symphony over 

the earphones reminded him that he was a few thousand miles away from ?ya devi 

sarvabhuteshu?.

His return journey was punctuated by a sojourn in 

Mumbai during the three days of Durga puja. Although the crowded metropolis was 

busy otherwise, there were plenty of pujas organised. Vicky did have the opportunity 

of visiting the Tejpal auditorium and the Shivaji Park to see the Thakurs. In 

one suburban puja, he also witnessed aarti on Ashtami evening. The atmosphere 

was no different from any pandal in Calcutta. The dhak and the kansar 

ghanta, the dhup and the dhuno, the first-time sari and the 

long-time sindoor ? every ingredient that make a perfect Puja evening was 

there.

Strange as it may sound, Vicky still felt that he 

had missed Puja this year.

That possibly is the point. Puja in Calcutta is often 

described in terms of a set of rituals. True, offering anjali, eating khichuri 

or pandal-hopping are all essential and irreplaceable ingredients of Durga puja 

in Calcutta but they collectively do not even begin to define the spirit that 

envelopes our city during the fortnight. As a result, the same rituals performed 

in another locale often do not have the same effect on a bystander.

The spirit is possibly intangible and multidimensional. 

It has been said before many times, Puja is no longer a religious ceremony; it 

is a celebration of culture, ethnicity and tradition. On the whole, it is a state 

of mind that is best understood in terms of its difference with the rest of our 

day-to-day existence.

Puja still sees a lot of event-specific advertising. 

From soaps and shampoos, motorcars and mobile phones, quite a few choose to buy 

media space during this season. All of them wish to associate their brand with 

the fun-filled days of the Puja. The hope is that the association will rub off 

during the rainy days.

The intention is noble but often the execution becomes 

lazy. Many advertisers do nothing more than adding the three-eyed motif representing 

Goddess Durga to their regular campaign. Some are more serious and they spend 

money to create an ad or sometimes a full campaign. They also do not get full 

value. The ads that are created often focus only on the rituals.

It is possible that the business dividends are not 

considered large enough to deserve the cerebral strain of capturing the underlying 

spirit of the Puja. There, of course, is the other possibility. The obsession 

with portrayal of the rituals of Puja often emits a whiff of hypocrisy. The intimacy 

with the culture that they portray appears shallow. Their unfamiliarity with the 

spirit becomes apparent.

That makes one wonder ? is their understanding of 

the Puja restricted to what people do rather than what people feel on 

those golden days?

It is not an entirely unexpected folly. Marketing 

itself is often mistaken as a set of business activities rather than the spirit 

of doing business.

Advertising merely follows the big brother.

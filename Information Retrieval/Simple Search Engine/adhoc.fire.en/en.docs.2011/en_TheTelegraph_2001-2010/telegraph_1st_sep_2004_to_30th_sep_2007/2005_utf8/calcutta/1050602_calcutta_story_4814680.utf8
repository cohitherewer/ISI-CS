 Aged, alone and target of thieves

 - Salt Lake?s senior citizens keep windows and doors bolted, but there?s always a sense of unease

 The 70-year-old widow sleeps with all her windows closed and the doors to every room locked. She has been a resident of Salt Lake for the past two decades but dares not stay home alone after dark. And she prefers to remain anonymous for fear of drawing criminal attention to her AE block address, where robbers have already struck twice.

 That they are the most vulnerable targets is an awareness the aged and the alone in Salt Lake are forced to live with every dark night. And things are going from bad to worse, as petty thieves are replaced by gun-toting goons.

 ?Earlier, the robbers would strike when the house was empty. They would only carry tools to break in. Now, they are armed and much more dangerous,? said the wrinkled old woman, the day after the robbery and shootout shook the adjoining BD block. ?I?m afraid to sleep with my windows open because it?s like an open invitation to get robbed,? laments the woman, whose greatest fear is that some sort of gas will be sprayed through the window and her home robbed.

 Her neighbours in AE block, the Dutta Chowdhurys, have also had their house robbed twice. Once, the goons entered through the vent of the exhaust fan. Jyotirmoyee Dutta Chowdhury, a 76-year-old nurse, has lived in refugee camps, been to ?East and West Pakistan? in troubled times, and had many a harrowing experience. But she feels more helpless now than ever before. ?We keep a domestic help in the house at night? but there is always a sense of unease,? says she.

 Jyotirmoyee?s sister-in-law, a widow, lives in BE block, a stone?s throw from the Monday night robbery site of BD 229. The former school principal has a rational argument for not really being afraid: ?I do take all the precautions I can, but more importantly, the thieves are well-informed, they know who has valuables at home.?

 For Asoke Bagchi and his wife Sadhana, living with the fear is a way of life in Salt Lake. Their daughter and son-in-law live on the first floor, but the elderly couple lives alone on the ground floor. ?Most houses in the area have been robbed at one time or another. Nowadays, however, only the homes of the well-to-do are targeted. The gangs are organised and know what they?re doing,? says the 81-year-old man of the house. The front door opening at night is always a source of scare for Sadhana, 73. ?I tell the domestic help to keep the door locked all the time.?

 AE block residents pay Rs 30 per month for private securitymen to patrol the area. But while one corner is being patrolled, homes in every other lane remain vulnerable ? none more so than those housing the elderly.

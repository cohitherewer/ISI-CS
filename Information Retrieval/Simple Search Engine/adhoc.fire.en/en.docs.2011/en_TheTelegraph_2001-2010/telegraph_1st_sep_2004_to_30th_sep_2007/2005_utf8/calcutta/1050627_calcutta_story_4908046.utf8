The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Repair work was started on many roads with great enthusiasm 

 before the civic polls. Now, it has been stopped in many 

 places. When the work was on, corners of roads were used 

 to pile up sand and large logs of wood and also to build 

 fires. Tar is still widely used for the repairs, for which 

 bitumen has to be smelted using a coal fire. As bitumen 

 melts, heavy brown smoke billows from it. A pall of smoke 

 also emanates from the fire. When this smoke enters through 

 the windows of a room, the smothering odour refuses to go. 

 Why cant some environment-friendly material be used 

 instead of bitumen?

 Almost a decade ago, I was duped by a fruit vendor outside 

 the subway leading into Howrah railway station, near the 

 state bus stand. The purchase weighed 250 g less than a 

 kg. Even now, a horde of vendors station themselves close 

 to the subway entrance and carry on with their unfair trade 

 practices. The presence of policemen in the vicinity fails 

 to act as a deterrent. The authorities must take action 

 against them.

 The entry to Behala bazaar, on Diamond Harbour Road, wears 

 the look of a garbage dump. The civic body must do something 

 about it.

 Around 40,000 sq ft in an upmarket pocket dedicated to environment. A jamboree to spread awareness about sustainable development, which alone can lead to a safe future. Green songs by popular Bangla band Chandrabindoo.

 All these and much more ? an environmentalist?s dream in a city choked by air pollution ? will feature in a fair to be held at Science City from February 16 to19. 

 It?s being organised by the state pollution control board, in association with the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce.

 ?The fair is meant to spread environmental awareness and inspire people, especially youths, to wield the green baton,? pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee told Metro.

 ?Apart from spreading awareness, the event will highlight current environmental problems and their possible solutions and share ideas with various stakeholders,? he added.

 A green fair is a rarity: the only states that hold such events regularly are Maharashtra and Delhi. In Bengal, a non-government organisation holds a green fair, on a much smaller scale, in Chandernagore. 

 The Science City fair, to be themed on Towards a Sustainable Development, will remain open from 1 pm to 7 pm. No entry fee will be charged.

 The Central Pollution Control Board, West Bengal Forest Development Corporation, the DVC and Calcutta University have agreed to take part in it. 

 ?Close to 100 industries have confirmed their participation,? disclosed Samir Ghosh, chairman of the fair committee.

 Ghosh felt the fair, to be organised at a cost of Rs 30 lakh, would be the ?cheapest and the most popular way of spreading the right message to all concerned?. 

 Seminars, talks and exhibitions have been lined. ?Musical programmes, plays, dances and puppet shows will be held for the cause of a greener environment,? said a board official.

 ?We appeal to everybody to join our effort? It?s the public participation that we are looking forward to,? added board chairman Banerjee. 

 Gauging the success of the inaugural effort, the board will decide on turning the fair into an annual event.

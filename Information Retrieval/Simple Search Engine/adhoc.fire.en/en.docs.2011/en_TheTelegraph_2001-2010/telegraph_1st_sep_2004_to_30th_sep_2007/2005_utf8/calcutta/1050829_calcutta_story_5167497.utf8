 Death after bid to save marriage 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Neighbours tried to save their marriage. But the efforts backfired and Subhas Mazumdar, 27, committed suicide in his Behala home on Sunday within hours of ?reuniting? with his wife the night before.

 Subhas swallowed sleeping pills bought from his brother?s drug store around 6.30 am on Sunday. He was pronounced dead at a city hospital around 8.30 am. He lived on Netaji Road, in Behala, and ran a public call office.

 According to the neighbours, Subhas?s family had not taken kindly to his marriage with Uma in 2004, whose family was from Patna and who had settled in Santipally, close to her in-laws?. 

 A few days ago, Uma went to her parents? house for Rakhi. On Saturday night, when she returned home, her in-laws allegedly did not allow her to enter. 

 Some influential local people organised a meeting to unite the couple that night. Subhas, his father, mother and wife took part in it. Thereafter, Uma returned to her in-laws?. Police were clueless about the suicide motive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dupe slur on IT firm

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Malyaban Gupta thought his life had changed when he got in touch with Buddhadeb Gupta and Sanjeev Shah of Future Technology Foundation (FTF). 

 After all, they had promised him a job in the IT sector in America ? for Rs 1,50,000.

 A year on, the youth from Behala has hit a dead-end, Gupta and Shah are missing in action, and the cops are struggling to pick up the scam trail that has also tripped many other youths seeking a career in software.

 On Wednesday, the Bidhannagar (North) police carried out a raid on the Salt Lake premises of FTF.

 ?We carried out the raid but Sanjeev Shah was not in office. He is said to be absconding,? a police official of Bidhannagar (North) police station told Metro on Wednesday evening. Gupta, the other accused in the case of fraud, is believed to be based in the US.

 ?Malyaban is not the only victim. There have been at least 15 to 20 boys who have been duped. Basically, FTF runs a bodyshop in the illegal sense. It has sent a few boys to America, but they have all returned, complaining that the living conditions were inhuman,? said a former official of the company now under a cloud.

 The rest, like Malyaban, have never made it anywhere close to America.

 Last year, when Malyaban had shelled out Rs 1,50,000, he had even been given a money receipt for the amount signed by Gupta, who had gone to the aspirant?s Behala home along with Sanjeev Shah to collect the amount.

 Malyaban was asked to go to the FTF office in Bangalore and train for SAP and marketing techniques, in September 2004, while the company ?processed his H-1 visa?. 

 But within four months, the company?s Bangalore operations shut down and Malyaban was back at the Salt Lake office door in December.

 ?I was manhandled and thrown out of the office. My request to have my money refunded was not heeded, and I was asked never to come back,? Malyaban told Metro.

 Realising he had been duped in a job scam, Malyaban filed an FIR this May with Behala police station. 

 The details were verified and the signature on the money receipt was matched with Gupta?s bank account signature. Then, an arrest warrant was issued by an Alipore court in July. 

 The arrest warrant was given to Bidhannagar (North) police station, as the company?s office fell under its jurisdiction.

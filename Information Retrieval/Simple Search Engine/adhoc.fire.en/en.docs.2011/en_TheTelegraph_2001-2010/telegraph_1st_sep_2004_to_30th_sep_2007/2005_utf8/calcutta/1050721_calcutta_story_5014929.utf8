 Frown sends police on clue hunt

 - KASBA TWIN MURDERS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Wednesday told the South 24-Parganas police to get their act together and arrest the culprits of the gruesome twin murders in Kasba.

 Close friends Piyush Saha, 25, and Bimal Chakraborty, 28, went missing on Sunday evening. Their mutilated bodies were found the next morning near a canal at Prantik Pally, in Kasba. 

 With the Opposition raising the issue of the ghastly killings in the Assembly on Tuesday, it was learnt that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself inquired about the incident and the developments in the police investigation.

 On Wednesday, South 24-Parganas superintendent S.N. Gupta was summoned to Writers? Buildings to brief the police top brass about the latest findings. 

 ?I have informed all the senior officers about the developments. We have also come across some more leads and are examining them at the moment,? said Gupta.

 Police spent all of Wednesday interrogating Dilip Das, who had been the last person to interact with the two victims before they left his house after attending his son?s birthday party. Police also questioned four youths detained in connection with the case.

 Inquiries revealed that Piyush and Bimal traded in readymade garments, as well as building material. 

 While Piyush lived in Kasba, Bimal was a resident of Jadavpur.

 ?The murdered traders were known to have met quite a few women in recent times and we have a strong suspicion that one of these women might be able to throw light on the case,? said a senior police officer.

 Apart from a failed love affair, police are also trying to find out whether business rivalry had anything to do with the killings. 

 ?It seems quite a few persons were involved in the murder. Both the men seem to have been murdered around the same time and at the same place,? an officer added.

 Ever since the twin murders came to light, local residents and Opposition leaders have been projecting Kasba as an area infested with criminals. 

 A few months ago, the bodies of a woman and her lover were found buried in a desolate factory in the area.

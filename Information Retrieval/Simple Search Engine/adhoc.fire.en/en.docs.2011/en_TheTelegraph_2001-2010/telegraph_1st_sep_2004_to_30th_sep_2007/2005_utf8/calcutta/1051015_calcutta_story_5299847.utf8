The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Abattoirs blind to pollution checks 

 - STATUS OF SLAUGHTERHOUSES 

 JAYANTA BASU 

 In defiance of orders of the Supreme Court and the Central Pollution Control Board, slaughterhouses in the city, and elsewhere in the state, are being run without any effective environment control in place, not even effluent-treatment plants.

 Recently, the state pollution control board had called a meeting of all 126 municipal bodies in the state to discuss the ?status of slaughterhouses? and steps taken for installation of ?pollution-control systems?, as recommended by the central board. 

 Two-thirds of the municipal bodies attended the meeting, but none submitted an action plan ? another requirement of the central board ? for combating environment degradation caused by slaughterhouses.

 ?The deadline to submit the action plans to the central board passed on August 18. The municipal bodies should now submit detailed action plans on each and every slaughterhouse at the earliest,? said state board chairman Sudip Banerjee. 

 He suggested that the civic authorities consider the ?viable bio-methanation technology? to tackle the problem.

 How is the Calcutta Municipal Corporation faring on the issue? Mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan told Metro: ?We have ordered officials to prepare a status report on the situation. An action plan will soon be finalised and submitted to the state green board.?

 Acting on a writ petition in 2003, the Supreme Court had ordered that all slaughterhouses in the country must instal effluent-treatment plants. The central green board was directed to pass on the order to state boards.

 The central board, however, is yet to hear from the state boards regarding compliance of the court order and preparation of a guideline to enforce it. This prompted the apex court on July 12, 2005, to ?take a serious view of the matter? and ask the central board whether it had approached the government for action against defaulting boards.

 The risk posed to the environment by ?unsafe? slaughterhouses in Bengal can be gauged from the fact that it is the biggest meat-producing state in the country. 

 The average daily production stands at 427,000 tonnes, most of which comes from Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24-Parganas. 

 In Calcutta, around 300 animals, mostly cows, are killed daily at two major slaughterhouses. 

 Asif Khan, who lives close to a slaughterhouse in Metiabruz, said: ?The area turns hellish during monsoon. Apart from polluted effluents that spill over the drains, a three-inch-thick coat of cow dung covers the roads near the spot where animals are tethered.?

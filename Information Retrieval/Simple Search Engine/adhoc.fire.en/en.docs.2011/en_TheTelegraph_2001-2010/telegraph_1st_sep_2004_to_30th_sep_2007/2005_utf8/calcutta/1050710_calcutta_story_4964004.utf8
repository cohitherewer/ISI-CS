 Health the high point at 100

 From trivial twaddle to vigorous gyming, the erstwhile Ladies Annexe at The Calcutta Club has turned full circle, as the hallowed institution decks up for its centennial bash.

 The Lawn House, gifted to the club by the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, Jitendranarayan Bhup, in 1920 in memory of his late father Nripendranarayan ?for the exclusive use of ladies? has reinvented itself as a contemporary health club, set to swing open its doors this week.

 The Ladies Annexe, as it came to be known, was the site for ?kitty parties, gossip and frivolous chatter? and also for serious business, says D.J. Banerjea, chairman of the centenary research advisory committee.

 Her Excellency, the Countess of Reading, lunched with the International University of Women ? British, Indian, American and colonial units at the Annexe. Also, during the tenure of club president Sir B.L. Mitter, permission was granted to the committee of the National Indian Association (women?s branch) to hold ?special gatherings? there.

 ?That was the time when ladies were not allowed in the main building and the Annexe provided an alternative platform for them to meet and socialise,? Banerjea adds. Quite a few member wives were prominent figures in the association. Lady Jadumani Mookerjee, wife of Sir R.N. Mookerjee, was founder-member and the first Indian president of the association?s city branch.

 ?We had a rudimentary health club in the Ladies Annexe, but following years of neglect, it has virtually ceased to function. So we decided to completely overhaul the place and gift the members a brand new pad to exercise and stay fit,? says club president Bhaskar Sen. The club is approaching a distinguished century and the management is gearing up for a gala celebration (kicking off on April 14, 2007).

 The entire courtyard in front of the club building has been converted to mastic asphalt with underground drainage, a commemorative stamp is being launched, a video orientation footage prepared for members and all the priceless paintings and lithographs restored. Still, the health club clearly is the pi?ce de resistance of the centenary year preparations.

 ?I have tried to resurrect the heritage fa?ade of the old structure, opening up spaces in front. However, inside the shell, it?s a very contemporary and functional health club,? says Ayan Sen. The 32-year-old architect doing the design solution for the health club has returned from MIT to set up his own practice in town.

 The 1,000-plus sq ft gym area will be fitted with latest equipment, while the health club will also have ?a proper downtown spa?, sauna, steam and massage rooms. All non-load-bearing partition walls were broken down and false ceilings used to conceal services.

 ?I have attempted to juxtapose the modern with the old, creating an apt young and vibrant foil for the more intellectual activities the club is known for,? says Ayan. Coming back to the city after 13 years, he has found a ?new energy in Calcutta, the aspiration to build, conserve and rise from the ashes?.

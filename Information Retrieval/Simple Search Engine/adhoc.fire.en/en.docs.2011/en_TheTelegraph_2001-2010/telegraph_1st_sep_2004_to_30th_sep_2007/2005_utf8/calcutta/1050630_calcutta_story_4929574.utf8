 Behind the bar

 The first step, and the most important one, of flaunting a bar at home is to learn the basics of bartending. Without proper knowledge of the right techniques of mixing and stirring, the finest of beverages that you proudly possess can hardly be put to best use. 

 Goodlife provides a guide to bar basics.

 Mixed cocktails

 Single liquor cocktails: Start with a glass full of ice. Pour the liquor or liqueur. Add the mixer and stir. Add the garnish 

 Multi-liquor cocktails: Start with ice in the shaker. Pour the liquors or liqueurs in first. Add the mixer. Shake the drink and strain into a glass with ice. Add the garnish and serve

 Shaken vs Stirred

 Shaken: Masks the flavour of alcohol by allowing the drink to become watered down. Turns clear liquors and liqueurs cloudy

 Stirred: yields a stronger alcohol-flavoured drink

 Frozen cocktails

 Start with two cups of ice in the blender. Pour the liquor(s) and liqueur(s) in first. Add the mixer(s) and fruit(s). Blend for about 15 to 30 seconds. Pour into the two glasses. Add the garnish and serve

 Flaming drinks

 Take a tablespoon. Fill half of the spoon with a liquor. Carefully light the liquor in the spoon. Hold the spoon out at arms length and slowly pour the liquor into the drink. Extinguish before drinking or serving

 Shots and mixed: Blow out the drink or use a wet napkin and cover the top of the glass

 Punches: Pour in extra of one of the mixers until the flame extinguishes

 Shooters

 Start with ice in a shaker. Pour the liquor(s) and liqueur(s) in first. Add the mixer. Shake the drink. Strain into several shot glasses

 Layered shooters: Slowly pour each ingredient, in the order they are listed, into a glass without mixing

 Preparing the glass

 Salting the rim of the glass: Use lemon or lime slice and rub it along the rim of the glass. Flip the glass over and dip it into a bowl of salt

 Chilling the glass: Store the glasses in a freezer or fill the glass with ice before serving. Flip your glasses over, stick the body of the glass into a bowl of shaved ice

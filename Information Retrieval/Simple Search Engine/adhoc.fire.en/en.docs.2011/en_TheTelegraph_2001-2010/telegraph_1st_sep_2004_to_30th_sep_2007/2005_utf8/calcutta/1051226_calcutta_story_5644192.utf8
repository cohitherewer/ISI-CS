 Most institutes for the challenged are more daycare centres and do not have 

facilities to provide vocational training to the students/inmates. The objective 

shouldn?t be just to take care of the handicapped people, but to teach them skills 

so that they can become independent and earn their own living. The government 

should open more schools in the city to provide vocational training to the challenged.

 The frequency of buses on routes 235 (Bidhannagar-Amtala) and 40A (Babughat-Thakurpukur) 

has reduced over the years. Office-goers who are dependent on these routes face 

much problems on weekdays. The transport authorities should consider allowing 

more private buses on routes from Bagbazar to Amtala, via Chittaranjan Avenue, 

BBD Bag and Diamond Harbour Road, and from the airport to Joka via Jessore Road, 

Maniktala Main Road, Esplanade and Thakurpukur.

 Hundreds of illegal constructions are coming up in wards 77 and 78. The Ekbalpore 

police are hand-in-glove with the unscrupulous builders. Some of the local administrative 

officials and politicians are also involved in the racket. We are helpless and 

don?t know who to approach to stop the constructions. 

 Amir Hossain, Ekbalpore.

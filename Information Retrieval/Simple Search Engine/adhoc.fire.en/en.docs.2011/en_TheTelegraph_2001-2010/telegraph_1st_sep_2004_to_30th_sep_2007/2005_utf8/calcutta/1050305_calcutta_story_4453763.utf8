 Gems of genius

 Every year, one of the city?s leading jewellery houses sets out to discover riches in a rather alien field. Jewels of Tomorrow is an annual festival of music and dance, organised by A. Sirkar, to allow budding artistes a chance to polish their skills.

 This year, the event was held at Gyan Manch with three performers. Leading the pack was Subhash Dey, a visually-challenged actor and director, performing sections of various well-known literary works along with his troupe, mixing drama with vocals and dance.

 Avijit Kundu, a young pianist who started training just four years ago, was next in line. He took home loud applause, playing pieces from Bach.

 It was kathak dancer Mitul Sengupta who was the talk of the evening, with her blend of kathak and flamenco in a graceful performance. Her solo was as interesting as her jugalbandi with tutor Rony Ghosh, which saw Mitul mirroring Ghosh?s tap dance steps in kathak. They were accompanied by Utpal Ghosal on tabla and Jayanta Banerjee on sitar.

 ?The effort is to provide a platform to introduce this talent pool to our clients, who in turn might be able to give them a break,? says Brinda Ganguly Sirkar of A. Sirkar.

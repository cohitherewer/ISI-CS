The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A trek, a tryst amp; a camera

 - Manchester trio scours city for found-and-lost friend

 KINSUK BASU

 Every fall, the trio from Manchester packs its bags for India. The one thing in life that Charles Brierley, Phillip Garratt and Gordon Beverly cannot do without is a long trek through this country once a year.

 This year is no different, except that they are also on a search mission in Calcutta. The three are determined to return a Zenit camera to its owner, whom they met in Nepal year before last and whose name or address they are not aware of.

 ?We have no clue about this man, except that he was from this city,? says Phillip, a wine merchant from Oldham, Manchester. ?A chirpy little man with a beard, we had met him along with others of his group during our trek to the Annapurna base camp in Nepal.?

 After a trek downhill, the three had sat down for a drink when they met the group. A brief exchange of pleasantries later, the group left the valley in a cab. It was then that the Britishers found the man had left behind his camera in a bag. There was no address.

 ?For days we scoured Nepal for the man. But neither he nor any others of the group could be located. After much deliberation, we decided to carry the camera with us,? says Gordon, a government officer in Manchester.

 Back in Manchester, the friends developed the film in the camera and collected prints that captured the hills in their snowy grandeur, with the man posing against their backdrop. They stored the prints on a CD and carried it to India, hoping the pictures would help them spot the man. 

 ?Now that we have planned to trek the eastern Himalayas, we thought it would be great if we found him in Calcutta,? adds Charles, who runs a hotel in Oldham.

 Despite the uncertainties, Phillip exudes confidence that he and his friends will be able to trace ?the man? in the ?crowd of faces? in the city. 

 Once they are through with the mission and the trek, each of the three friends plans to carry back home a ?sweet token? ? a Royal Enfield Bullet.

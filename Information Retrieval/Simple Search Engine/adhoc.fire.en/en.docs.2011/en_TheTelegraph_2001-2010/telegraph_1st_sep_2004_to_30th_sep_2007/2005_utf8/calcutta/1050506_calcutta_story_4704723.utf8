 Matters of metals

 Minerals and ores spring to life at the new gallery opened in Birla Industrial amp; Technological Museum this week. Subhajit Banerjee reports

 A study of metals on the pages of the textbook can be as interesting as perhaps learning swimming through books. But when extraction processes are displayed through models and a chunk of iron ore is showcased in front of your eyes, things suddenly spring to life.

 To celebrate its 46th anniversary, Birla Industrial amp; Technological Museum inaugurated its Metals gallery this week. The gallery focuses on iron and steel, aluminium, copper and zinc. ?Metals occupy a very important place in our civilisation,? says museum director Jayanta Sthanapati. ?We have focused on these four metals and their alloys particularly for their multiple uses in our lives.?

 The 210-sq-m gallery welcomes visitors with a life-sized model of a fifth century BC blacksmith preparing to forge the metal into a sickle. Then on, it?s a journey into the world of ores, furnaces, converters and other aspects of metals through flow-charts, touchscreens, interactive models and multimedia presentations. The last section is a quiz on metals where the visitor is asked questions based on what he has seen and learnt.

 There are also exhibits on ore samples, extraction and properties of metals, a model of a zinc furnace in Udaipur dating back to the 18th century, cross-section of a blast furnace, history of tribal iron-making and lots more.

 ?The Metals gallery is our first programme under the five-year plan we have undertaken to celebrate our golden jubilee,? says Sthanapati. ?Instead of rushing to update everything in the museum in the jubilee year, we are starting early to do a better job.?

 The museum had a gallery dedicated to mines and minerals back in the 60s, but years of wear and tear and data becoming outdated called for a new gallery.

 The golden jubilee celebration plan includes adding new galleries besides renovating and updating the existing ones. Fascinating Physics opens in December, which will look at major contributions made in the field of Physics in the past 100 years, followed by other new galleries in the coming months.

 ?The display and communication techniques are changing rapidly. We plan to update all the 11 galleries by 2009,? offers the director.

 With summer vacations on in schools, it?s an ideal time for the young ones to find out how learning can be fun. ?We try to supplement school education and target students from classes VIII to XII.? Besides the target group, however, the metal gallery has already seen visitors from the industry as well.

 It took the museum two years to plan and complete the gallery, with assistance from Steel Authority of India, National Metallurgical Lab and IIT Kharagpur. ?The curator, R.S. Chaudhary being a metallurgical engineer also helped,? Sthanapati added.

 Though funds are not a problem for this Central government-funded organisation which functions under the National Council of Science Museums, shortage of skilled workers is. ?All the models and exhibits are conceptualised, designed and made in-house. But the government has frozen recruitment, so we feel a little under-staffed,? Sthanapati says.

 What?s on your mind this week

 Crime most foul

 Constable More raped a minor in the Marine Drive police outpost in Mumbai. A few years back, Nilkamal Ghosh and his associates gangraped a woman from a nearby slum in the police barracks itself. Dhananjoy Chatterjee, security guard of a South Calcutta apartment, raped 14-year-old Hetal Parekh.

 All three incidents have one thing in common; the protector turned predator. They also prove that we cannot trust our cops.

 The only difference is that in the Marine Drive case, protests by the people of Mumbai ensured the immediate suspension of Sunil More. It is likely that the constable will get away scot-free, as our law has plenty of loopholes.

 Very often, rapists go unpunished in this country due to lack of evidence and its manipulation. The victims are silenced by threats or are discouraged from speaking out due to social stigma. Even if the rapist is convicted, the punishment meted out is too lenient.

 Rapists should be given capital punishment as rape does not merely cause physical injury but leaves deep mental scars. The victim is often forced to spend her days in shame and disgrace.

 Intellectuals raise a hue and cry over death sentence. Their view is that the state doesn?t have the right to take one?s life. But then, does a rapist have the right to deny a woman a normal life?

 There is also an argument that capital punishment is not a deterrent. If it is not, life imprisonment, too, will not be much of a deterrent. 

 It?s high time that rapists, even if they are policemen, are punished in an exemplary manner. Rape cases should be heard only by women judges and quickly disposed.

 Unequal law

 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board?s (AIMPLB) proposals to document marriages, regard women as ?owners of household? and denounce the system of triple talaq, among others, are praiseworthy.

 Such legal provisions and recognitions have been long awaited. But the fact remains that women are still at a disadvantage under the Muslim marriage laws.

 The very fact that Muslim women are still debarred from initiating a divorce in India under the new model nikahnma, goes to show that high-sounding, inspirational coinages like women?s emancipation, women?s empowerment and the like are still mere fanciful word-jugglery when it comes to married Muslim women.

 In a community regarded as a minority in the secular country of India, the female voice is all the more feeble, as epitomised by the nearly 3:1 representation ratio in favour of the males in the AIMPLB.

 Sans power

 Over the past few months power cuts have become a common feature in Calcutta, bringing with it a host of problems, particularly for the students.

 In the absence of power, people are having to sweat profusely with the mercury touching 38 degree Celsius. As a result of the power cuts, students are bearing the brunt of the sapping heat at night and in the mornings after commuting to schools and colleges in the sun.

 This summer has become a nightmare for Calcuttans. We are all looking forward to and praying for rains. Hopefully, the CESC will act on an emergency basis to provide some respite to the people.

 M?lange

 Words melt into ripples 

 Hues cascading sky 

 Silhouettes emerging unending 

 Silent murmuring thoughts 

 Neon glow signs 

 Come alive 

 Plaintive scathing blue 

 Racing flat horizon 

 Swoop swish dive 

 Wet ink black crow 

 Tilted sweeping gathering 

 Cable wires 

 Thick thin near far attractive 

 Lines vertical horizontal 

 Pictures paintings canvasses 

 Cramming words 

 Divulging 

 Spinning like a carousel 

 Throw the beads free 

 Steps racing?.faster and 

 ...a thud?. 

 Eternal 

 Plumbing pipes 

 Beautiful 

 Sturdy 

 Soft and smooth 

 In the halo 

 Glow pink white blue 

 Like a hawk 

 The steel thaws the sky 

 Fading unconscious woken limbs 

 Sieving potion through clouds 

 And god spoke in one voice 

 ?You are a child 

 Mooning gawking consuming

 Dreams.?

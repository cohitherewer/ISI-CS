 Lifestyle look and workout wows

Kolkata, a series of fashion shows that has now become a regular event at Prince 

of Cal, the fourth floor lounge of Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion, hosted four new 

faces from the fashion business last Saturday.

 Having moved away from garments, the starting point for the shows that took off about four months ago, the thrust is now on giving accessories a party platform. Jewellery, bags and shoes were the centre of attention this weekend as models flaunted a range of accessories on Indo-Western outfits.

 ?We wanted to bring to our viewers the entire gamut of young designers of the city who are working so well, not just in garments but also in accessories,? said Kaushik Banerjee of Images of India, managing the series.

 This week, the spotlight was first on Vasundhara Mantri, a young jewellery designer who has already made a name for herself in the industry. Namrata Kanoi was next with interesting and affordable footwear and bags. Up next was Sunanda Dutta?s range of innovative jute bags. Finally, the focus shifted back to clothes with Soma Chatterjee?s popular fusion styles.

 Fun funda

 Being part of the audience of a quiz is not the most interesting way to spend a Saturday evening, unless the format of questions transforms it into an entertaining affair complete with musical performances, dance and some amateur catwalk, too.

 The Lifestyle Quiz at Tollygunge Club presented by Open Doors last weekend made up for all this and more as six teams and at least 200 people sat through a one-and-a-half hour round of questions fired by some of the city?s better-known names.

 In the absence of a permanent quiz master (Derek ?Brien, who would otherwise have been the obvious choice, decided to switch roles and joined one of the teams instead). Everyone from Kishore Bhimani to Shaun Kenworthy, Partho Datta and Oindrilla Dutt thus took turns at asking questions that ranged from sports to music to food.

 The preliminary round of the quiz held earlier the same evening saw some contestants shifting from the stage to the audience as 24 made it to the finals. Derek?s team, that was faring unimpressively at the start, emerged winners with a clean sweep in the live food-tasting and mocktail-sampling rounds.

 ?It was a special evening since Derek was quizzing as a team member after a really long time,? said Oindrilla of Open Doors who conceptualised the live rounds and did most of the questioning on films and music. Kishore Bhimani?s questions were largely drawn from famous sporting events and characters.

 Tolly members lent a spontaneous hand as young beauties strode the stage to show off a heel or a sleeve on which questions were asked while others sang and danced in the live question round. Each of the winners went home with gifts worth Rs 4,000.

 Gym glam

 Addlife announced its third-year plans on Saturday amid much fanfare with model-turned-actress Malaika Arora Khan coming down to inaugurate the event.

 The new expanded weight section includes novel strength training equipment comprising a free weights-cable-pulley machine called the Cable Crossovers. This can be adjusted to varying exercises with varying heights. It provides the opportunity to perform exercises for almost every body part.

 The cardiovascular equipment ranges from treadmills to cross trainers. All these have been specially imported from Precor, USA. 

 At the inauguration, directors Ritika Kumar and Ritu Gupta said: ?The fast-changing trend in the fitness fraternity and the success achieved have led to the expansion at Addlife.? 

 Cool cuts

 Diva on 19 Mahanirban Road, off Rashbehari Avenue, has launched a new summer range to mark its first anniversary in April. The georgette, chiffon and cotton ensembles are in cool summer colours like whites, pinks, blues, lemons, etc. 

 The highlights of the summer range here are hand-painted georgette salwar suits, kurtis and ponchos embellished with sequins and beads. Another introduction is patchwork with brocade trimmings on cotton fabrics.

 Diva?s wide variety of georgette and chiffon ponchos make for a very summery evening look. These could be printed or embellished with beads, tassels and sequins. Georgette khari-printed skirts in a variety of colours is another standout. As are georgette and cotton shirts with lacy frills and trimmings for a feminine look. The churidar-kurti range can be found in cotton with resham embroidery. Chiffon dupattas, printed Mangalgiri suits, jute cottons with khari work are other introductions at the store.

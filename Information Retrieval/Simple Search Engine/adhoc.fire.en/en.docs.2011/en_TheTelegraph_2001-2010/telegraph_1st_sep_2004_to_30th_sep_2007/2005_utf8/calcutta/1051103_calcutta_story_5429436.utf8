 A veil of silence continued to shroud model Sharan Mishra on Wednesday, as she was shifted from one Gariahat nursing home to another, seeking better medical facilities for her burns.

 ?There was no proper OT set-up at Revival nursing home (near Bijon Setu). So, we decided to shift her to The Gariahat Kidney Care Centre (at Hindusthan Park). The doctors are hopeful of her recovery,? Sharan?s brother-in-law S.P. Tiwary told Metro soon after the shift was carried out.

 Sharan, a leading model from Calcutta who had made it to fashion shows in Paris and Milan, had set up work base in Delhi. She had come home to husband Umang Tiwary when, on October 19, she was badly burnt under mysterious circumstances in their flat near Malancha cinema, in the Tollygunge area.

 The 23-year-old model was first taken to MR Bangur Hospital and then shifted to Revival on October 21, with ?60 per cent burns? on her upper body.

 When and how did Sharan?s clothes catch fire? No clear answers are forthcoming yet.

 Rajesh Barasia, the doctor supervising Sharan?s treatment, told Metro: ?It has been 13 agonising days, but she has not spoken a single word about it to any of the medical staff attending to her. I constantly talk to her while treating her, but even I am not aware of how the accident occurred. She has been talking about everything but ask her about the accident, and she just keeps quiet.?

 ?I was the first to examine her when she was admitted in very bad condition. Her entire face, torso and abdomen were burnt and I did not even expect her to survive the next 48 hours. But she fought back to life. Now, her condition is stable but not completely out of danger. Such cases do not improve overnight,? added Barasia.

At the Hindusthan Park nursing home, Sharan is confined to the intensive care unit with no outsider allowed to get close.

 Husband Umang, a third-year student of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, has left for the Sunderbans.

 ?I have some shooting. My family and Sharan?s family will take care of her,? he had told Metro on Tuesday evening.

 His brother, S.P. Tiwary, refused to elaborate on the hows and whats of the mishap. ?We do not know what had happened that day. Even Umang has not told us anything about it? Everyone is just hoping that she recovers soon,? he said.

 Many of Sharan?s friends in the modelling world learnt of the mishap from the Metro reports. ?She?s an introvert who kept to herself even when she came down to Calcutta for a break? Her world seemed to revolve around Umang,? said a model who has known Sharan from the day she started.

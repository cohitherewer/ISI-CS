 Cops clear out mall Romeos

 The next time you visit City Centre with your family, you need not worry about security. 

 You can sit out on the steps leading to the mall or enjoy a meal in the food court without unpleasant surprises; at least, that?s what the police claim. 

 The City Centre management also feels that visitors have noted a difference in the quality of the crowd at Salt Lake?s favourite hangout. It credits raids and vigil by the cops for the development.

 In the recent past, numerous women visitors had been subjected to rude comments and indecent proposals, and had even been stalked from City Centre, giving the mall a bad name.

 The matters came to a head around a month ago, with actress June and telefilm director Anindita Sarbadhicary being harassed by a group of students outside City Centre.

 ?I have had horrible experiences at the mall. Absolute hooliganism prevailed on the premises. Groups of youths passed lewd comments at women and couples. I had given up visiting the place,? said Samir Dutta of Palm Avenue, who would often drop in at the mall over the weekend to catch a movie at INOX.

 ?The last time we came, we were scared to sit on the steps. We are feeling safe today. We haven?t seen any hooligans yet,? added Snigdha, Samir?s wife. 

 Sumanta Sarkar, a resident of Salt Lake?s KB block, echoed the feeling. ?Before the police action, the ambience at City Centre was not quite healthy. It now seems much better. We haven?t come across any group passing comments at women,? stated Sarkar, a regular visitor to the mall. 

 Ayushman Ghosh and his wife, residents of Salt Lake?s BC block, said the eve-teasers would target single women visiting the mall.

 With an average daily footfall of 10,000 on weekdays and a whopping 40,000 over the weekend, the mall management would have found it impossible to take the Romeos to task, without the help of the administration, admitted Vineet Verma, City Centre CEO. 

 ?As per the feedback from customers, the quality of the crowd has definitely improved,? stated Verma. ?Young people are welcome to the mall, but they must know their limits,? he added.

 The CEO thanked the police for their cooperation. ?We have our own security personnel, but they are not empowered to arrest or detain anyone,? he explained. 

 Apparently, the harassment of June and Anindita earlier this month by five schoolstudents have mobilised the police. 

 Not only were the five arrested, 20 more youths were rounded up by plainclothes cops in subsequent raids.

 Policewomen in plainclothes have been deployed at City Centre, backed up by a team of policemen. One officer and two constables in uniform have also been posted to assure the public. 

 In addition, security has been stepped on the steps to the mall and in the food court.

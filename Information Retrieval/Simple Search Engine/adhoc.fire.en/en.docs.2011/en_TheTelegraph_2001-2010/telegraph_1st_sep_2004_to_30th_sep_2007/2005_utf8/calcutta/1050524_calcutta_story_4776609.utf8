The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Success rate up, schools upbeat

 - Commerce scores high in CBSE Class XII tests

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The success rate crept up and the mood was buoyant on Monday, as Class XII results of the Central Board of Secondary Examinations (CBSE) were declared.

 ?The performance of schools located in Calcutta and Bengal is good this year. But we are unable to provide exact statistics on Calcutta, as we have not compiled a city-wise data on performance of students,? said a senior official of the CBSE from Delhi. Bengal schools, however, fall under the Allahabad region.

 Officials of institutions affiliated to the Delhi-based board confirmed on Monday that the overall performance of students in reputed CBSE schools in the city was an improvement over last year.

 The Kendriya Vidyalaya schools could say it in figures. ?The pass percentage in the Kendriya Vidyalayas in Calcutta has increased by more than two per cent this time,? said V.K. Srivastav, assistant commissioner of Kendriya Vidyalaya schools of the Bengal circle.

 The success rate is 92.10 per cent this time, against 90.2 per cent last year. ?Students of Calcutta are doing very well,? said Srivastav, adding that the success rate was as low as 81 per cent in 2003.

 ?We are happy that most of our students have got a first division this time. We are happier because many of our students have scored 90 per cent and above in one or more subjects this time,? said Sharmila Basu, principal, Birla High School (Girls).

 ?This year?s results show a drastic improvement in overall performance of students, particularly in commerce and business studies,? said Jaya Mishra, examination officer of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy.

 The toppers included Abhigyan Mundhra (science) of Apeejay School, with 93.8 per cent, and Avantika Deora (commerce) of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, scoring 93.6 per cent. Among the Kendriya Vidyalaya schools, Priyanka Priyadarshini (science) of Ballygunge scored 93.2 per cent in science.

 In keeping with the national trend, girls from a number of co-educational schools in the city outscored the boys. The commerce scores left most smiling, while some science scores left a lot to be desired, complained some students.

 ?After many years the current year?s results show 100 per cent success in commerce,? said a senior official of the Fort William branch of Kendriya Vidyalaya.

 Topper Avantika Deora of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy said: ?I now plan to study economics and my first choice is Delhi.?

 The one blot on the Calcutta report card, said officials and principals, was that the number of students scoring 90 per cent and above in aggregate was less than in other cities.

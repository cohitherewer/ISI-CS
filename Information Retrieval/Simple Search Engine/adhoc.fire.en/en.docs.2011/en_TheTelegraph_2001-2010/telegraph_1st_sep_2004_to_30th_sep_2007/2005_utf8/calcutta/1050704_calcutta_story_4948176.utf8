 Tom Cruise with Katie Holmes: In a different 

world

The original book by H.G. Wells in 1898 was a pioneering 

work in the field of science fiction. The radio series by Orson Welles in 1938 

enthralled millions of Americans, even convincing many that the invasion was real. 

Then there were the films ? from George Pal?s version in 1953 to the 2005 blockbuster 

by Steven Spielberg. 

 But from the first, it was more than just a sci-fi piece of work about aliens and earthlings. It was a means at hitting back at the political situation of the time. For Wells, it was the British empire ? a depiction of the colonisation. The reason the radio broadcasts fooled people into believing the invasion was real was because it was on the threshold of World War II, when the prospect of invasion was very real.

 Pal?s epic was made during the Cold War era, with many seeing the aliens as representing the communists. Even the spectacular Independence Day, starring Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, released a few years after the first Gulf War, is based on the basic theme of War of the Worlds, but with large doses of American patriotism ? everyday heroes defeating the invaders.

 And finally, it comes down to the Tom Cruise-starrer War of the Worlds, released worldwide on July 1, just in time for the American Independence Day weekend (July 4). With the events of 9/11 still fresh in the world?s memory and the war in Afghanistan and Iraq floundering, the relevance of the film is unmistakable. But to catch the allegories of real life depicted on reel, you?ll have to watch the movie.

 Godzilla: Toon time

 The giant lizard has terrorised Americans in its various avatars on celluloid over the years. But Godzilla turns an ally of the humans in a new animated series, scheduled to premiere on Animax on July 11.

 The animated version begins with biologist Nick Tatopoulos finally destroying Godzilla, with the help of French Secret Service operative Phillipe Roache, before the beast can level the whole Tri-State area. However, it appears that Godzilla has left behind an heir. During a routine check on the city?s subway tunnels, Nick finds the monster?s last-surviving hatchling. But rather than attacking Nick, the creature forms a bond with him.

 Later, when unexplained environmental anomalies and mutant monsters begin to threaten to destroy the world, the new Godzilla becomes an important ally, as Nick, Godzilla, and his research team HEAT (Humanitarian Ecological Analysis Team) travel around the globe trying to save humanity.

 Animax has lined up a lot of promo activities for Godzilla. The motion picture will be aired on July 10 at 6 pm, a day before the series goes on air. There will also be a contest, The Great Godzilla Egg Hunt, where viewers will be required to count the number of times they spot the Godzilla egg during the series. Answers can be sent in through SMS or email. Prizes include Sony PlayStation 2, TV sets, bicycles, cameras and Animax goodies. 

 The channel will also visit 160 schools (40 per metro) between June 28 and July 8 to promote the tales of the giant lizard.

 With the world of soaps and serials depending on twists and turns, the key-phrase in Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin has suddenly become pre-nuptial contract. In the show, Angel (played by Rakhi Tandon) has convinced Armaan to draw up a pre-nuptial contract for his marriage with Jassi. But more than the storyline in the popular Sony serial, it is a question thrown at everyone ? whether pre-nuptials are necessary before exchanging vows?

 For small-screen actor Manav Gohil, who?s married to telly actress Shweta Kawatra, it?s the done thing these days. ?With divorce rates going up, I think it?s a safe idea. It?s beneficial for both the husband and wife,? says Manav. But wife Shweta doesn?t believe in paperwork. ?Mera vishwaas koi kaagaz ka tukda nahin ho sakta... it?s all about depending on each other,? she says.

 Even the popular Kyunki? husband-and-wife pair Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan have conflicting viewpoints. Hiten says: ?Our fathers and grandfathers never had to sign such pre-nuptials but they were very much together all the time and happily married.? But Gauri feels: ?There?s nothing to lose as such. In fact, it can be very useful for us, ladies.?

 While you can make your judgment on the issue, you can check out what Armaan and Jassi finally do about their pre-marriage contract.

 Reena Kapoor: Telly fresher

 The Rajashri soap Woh Rehne Waali Mehlon Ki? is slowly getting steady with the TRP but looks like it will take some time to challenge the reigning saas-bahu sagas. To increase the visibility factor, Sahara One, which airs the serial at 9 pm Monday to Thursday, has launched the Real Life Rani Contest, inviting viewers to write in with their own bittersweet stories from life. The prize could be a date with Rani, played by Reena Kapoor, and much more. 

 ?My character is bubbly and delicate, yet very strong. She comes from an affluent background but gets married to a middle-class family. It?s all about how she takes it in her stride,? says Reena, who, some may remember, had played Preity Zinta?s friend in Kundan Shah?s Kya Kehna. To clinch the coveted role of Rani, Reena admits to having gone through a round of auditions, elbowing out ?some 700 girls?. 

 The man she gets married to is the handsome Arjun Punj, whose claim to fame is the popular Zee serial Sanjeevani and a couple of music videos. ?The brief from Sooraj Barjatya is to do a very controlled kind of acting. He sees the rushes and dismisses scenes where there?s an excess,? says Arjun, waiting to make the switch to Bollywood.

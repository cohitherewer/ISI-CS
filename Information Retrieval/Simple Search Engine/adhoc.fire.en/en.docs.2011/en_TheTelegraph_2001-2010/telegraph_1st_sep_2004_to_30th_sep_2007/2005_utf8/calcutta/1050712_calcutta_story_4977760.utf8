The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road chaos likely for Kalam visit

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The city is likely to witness large-scale traffic disruption on Wednesday because of road restrictions for President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s visit.

 According to the schedule, President Kalam will arrive in Calcutta on Tuesday evening and attend at least six functions throughout Wednesday.

 City police said all measures were in place to ensure minimal traffic disruption. 

 However, in case the schedule overshoots at any one of the venues, chances of snarls and the resultant chaos remain high.

 ?The diversion of traffic at any point will begin about 10 minutes before the President?s convoy passes through. But soon after he reaches the venue, we will open the roads. In case of any difficulty, despite our best efforts, people will have to bear with us,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 The President?s itinerary:

 July 12

 8.05 pm: Arrival at Calcutta airport

 July 13

 10 am: Jadavpur University (JU)

 11 am: Mahajati Sadan

 12.20 pm: Rabindra Sadan

 1.15 pm: Nandan

 3.30 pm: Bengal Engineering and Science University

 5 pm: Science City

 6.30 pm: Departure

 Officials fear that the venues where the President is most likely to exceed the apportioned time quota are JU and Nandan, where he will interact with students.

 In keeping with such apprehensions, the traffic police have decided that north-bound traffic from JU will be diverted along Raja Subodh Mullick Road 10 minutes before the President arrives at the university. 

 Similarly, traffic heading towards Esplanade from the Shyambazar five-point crossing will be diverted along APC Road and SN Banerjee Road about 10 minutes before the presidential convoy reaches Mahajati Sadan, on Chittaranjan Avenue.

 One of the prime concerns for the traffic police is maintaining a steady flow on Chittaranjan Avenue, as the President?s convoy might take the road a number of times on its criss-cross route across the city. A high-level meeting was held on Monday at Lalbazar to chalk out security arrangements for the visit.

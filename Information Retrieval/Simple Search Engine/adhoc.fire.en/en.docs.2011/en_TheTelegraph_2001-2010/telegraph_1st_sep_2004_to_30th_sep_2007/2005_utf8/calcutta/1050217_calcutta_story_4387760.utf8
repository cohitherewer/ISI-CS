 Alert over air pollution peril to baby in womb

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The government?s refusal to clear the Calcutta air has claimed its most hapless victim ? the newborn.

 Medical experts on Wednesday highlighted the role of air pollution as a pre-natal peril, causing chromosomal abnormalities in babies that can lead to cancer.

 Citing a recent research report published by the US-based National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), revealing that DNA of babies can be damaged before they are born if their mothers are exposed to pollution, city-based doctors called for the immediate introduction of eco-friendly fuel in the city. 

 ?Most paediatric cancer cases in Calcutta are genetic in nature, where pollution can play a major role. It is now time to check pollution levels and undertake proper measures to save our children,? said haemato-oncologist Sharmila Chandra.

 Calcutta is among the most polluted metros in the country, with an average suspended particulate matter (SPM) level of close to 300 microgram per cubic metre, way above the acceptable limit of 140 microgram per cubic metre.

 Paediatric cancer cases comprise 15-20 per cent of the 60,000 new cancer cases reported in city hospitals every year, and specialists say the numbers are rising alarmingly, with at least 50 per cent suffering from leukaemia.

 ?Blood cancer among the paediatric age-group has been rising significantly and solid tumour cases are very few, which strengthens our belief that environmental pollution is playing a big role,? said cancer surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay.

 Gynaecologist Ratnavali Chakraborty, who has treated many women with high exposure to pollution, was not surprised at the US report: ?It is known that pollution has a highly adverse effect on the chromosomal level of human beings. Maximum exposure to air pollution damages the chromosomes beyond repair and, unfortunately, the baby has to bear the brunt of it.?

 During the NIEHS study, experts found environmental exposure to specific combustion pollutants during pregnancy to be the cause of chromosomal abnormalities in foetal tissues in around 60 babies.

 A few months ago, city-based oncologists had stated that the highly carcinogenic unsaturated hydrocarbons, emitted from diesel exhausts, were causing a spurt in lung cancer cases.

 ?If chemical carcinogens, floating in Calcutta?s atmosphere, can damage the lungs if inhaled regularly, there is no reason why it cannot wreak havoc with a newborn?s health,? said oncologist Subir Gangopadhyay.

 A heady mix of fragrance and fashion wafted through the December night on Saturday when French perfume giant Christian Dior came calling to the city. 

 Diors latest fragrance, Miss Dior Cherie, was launched at Roxy, the cocktail bar at The Park, in the glittering presence of the citys celebrities. 

 Miss Dior Cherie is the modern twisted version of the 1947 classic Miss Dior. Miss Dior Cherie has been re-interpreted for todays independent and elegant woman. Poised between tradition and modernity, the bottle proclaims its contemporary beauty and designer looks, said Fiona Caroline, training manager of Euro Traditions, the sole distributor of Dior in India.

 The top notes of the perfume are green mandarin and strawberry leaves, while the middle notes are caramelised popcorn and strawberry. Fresh patchouli and crystalline musk make up the bottom notes. Classy yet edible, it is bound to lure admirers closer and closer, Fiona stressed.

 Bottles of 100 ml and 50 ml cost Rs 3,815 and Rs 2,735, respectively. The fragrant is available at Shoppers Stop in Forum and City Centre.

 To set the Dior mood, the Roxy d?cor was done up with a huge cut-out of the perfume bottle placed at the entrance, while big cartons of caramelised popcorn added to the perfumes spell. In the backdrop, the screen at the nightclub flickered with images of the Dior Fall-Winter Collection 2005-2006.

 There was a whiff of freshness on the ramp too. A bunch of models from the Northeast ? Mitali, Sujata, Priyanka, Mehrun and Saba ? was brought down to display the Dior exotica. Guwahati-based fashion designer Abhijeet Singha came up with a very sporty yet feminine collection for the girls. Blue denim was blended with white to create some eclectic outfits. 

 Short skirts, well-cut jackets, sensuous satin camisoles and boots made the style statement, with metallic buttons, large zippers and silver earrings.

 I was asked to design clothes for todays young woman, who is sexy and at the same time elegant, said Abhijeet, who also choreographed the show and earned the Dior thumbs up. 

 The background score for the ramp romp was lifted straight from Diors Paris show. 

 Among those spotted sniffing the fruity French flavour were actress June, accompanied by sister Apsara, and designer Shamlu Dudeja. 

 The star quotient soared high later in the night when Manisha Koirala dropped in after a daylong shoot for Rituparno Ghoshs Khela.

 The guests were served sleek glasses of Passion Mimossa, a sweet cocktail of Champagne and black currant liquor, apart from red and white wine, vodka and whiskey. 

 The platter for finger food featured Oriental Chicken Tikka, Risotto Balls and assorted Lebanese snacks.

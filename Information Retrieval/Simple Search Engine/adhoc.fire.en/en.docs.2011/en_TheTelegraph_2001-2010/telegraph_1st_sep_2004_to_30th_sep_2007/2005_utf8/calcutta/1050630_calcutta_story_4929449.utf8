The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three new platforms, five new trains

 - RAILWAY SHAVES TIMINGS, ADDS COACHES

 Eastern Railway on Wednesday introduced its new timetable and announced several changes in the service. General manager Shyam Kumar said on the occasion that three additional platforms would be built at the Howrah terminal and five more trains would be introduced.

 ?All these changes are in accordance with our commitment to provide our passengers with better services,? Kumar said at Sealdah station. The three new platforms at Howrah, he said, will be used in an emergency ? such as when the commuters? rush becomes too much for the existing platforms.

 Of the five new trains, three are suburban ? one in the Howrah division and the rest in Sealdah. The trains in the Sealdah division will ply on the Hasnabad and Barasat routes, while the one in Howrah will run to Chandanpur, Kumar said.

 Of the other two new trains, one is the Malda Town-Bhagalpur Intercity Express, which will run six days a week, barring Sunday, and the other a weekly express to Muzaffarpur. The train will leave Howrah on Wednesdays and Muzaffarpur on Tuesdays.

 Kumar also announced the introduction of spot reservation against availability of seats. All Rajdhani trains have been brought under the scheme.

 Among the other major changes are the reduction of the journey time of 14 mail/express trains, the Lalgola Fast Passenger and two more passenger trains by 15 to 120 minutes.

 The journey time of the Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani, via Patna (Up), has been reduced by 25 minutes. The weekly Howrah-Dehra Dun Upasana Express has been made superfast and the time for the Up and Down journeys has been reduced by 75 and 20 minutes, respectively.

 The routes of a number of trains have been extended. The Howrah-Malda Fast Passenger has been extended to Balurghat, while the Ahmedabad-Dhanbad Parasnath Express (weekly) will run up to Asansol.

 Eight local trains, too, will run a longer course. From July 1, the Prinsep Ghat-Barasat service will run up to Hasnabad, the Sealdah-Barrackpore train up to Naihati, the Hasnabad-Barasat to Dum Dum Junction, Prinsep Ghat-Barrackpore to Ranaghat, Howrah-Seoraphuli to Tarakeswar, Tarakeswar-Seoraphuli to Howrah, Howrah-Chandanpur to Gurap and the Sealdah-Dankuni up to Baruipara.

 Three more AC 3-tier coaches and an extra pantry car have been tagged to the Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express. Extra coaches have also been added to three other long-distance trains. 

 On the upkeep of trains, Kumar said ?individual coach maintenance? would be phased out and in its place would come ?full train maintenance system?.

 The advantages of the new system, he elaborated, include a reduction in the shunting time of coaches in maintenance yards. ?Besides, it will also ensure equal attention to all coaches and same changes in the passenger amenities for the entire train,? Kumar said. Presently, individual coaches undergo maintenance separately according to requirements.

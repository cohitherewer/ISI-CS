The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City singer in final countdown

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Shilpi on song at the Samsung [V] Super Singer in Mumbai 

 She has made it to the final 10 of a nationwide talent hunt being televised on Channel [V]. Yet few know of her exploits in her Ichhapur neighbourhood. ?I am not exactly in the limelight here,? smiles 20-year-old Shilpi Paul, back home well after 10 pm following a rehearsal for a fusion workshop in south Calcutta.

 The girl, who has been true to her name in her choice of vocation, starts the day early with riyaz before going out for classes. She is in the third year at Barrackpore Surendranath College, studying the pass course in microbiology. ?I know it is a difficult subject, but my mother is as much for education as my father is for music,? she explains.

 Her trip up the Samsung [V] Super Singer path started through a lucky tilt of the scales in her routine. ?I was in the locality of Hyatt Regency for some work on the day they were holding the city auditions there. If I wrapped up early, I thought, I would try my luck there.?

 Shilpi was perhaps the last one to pick up an audition form before the police started a lathicharge to control the surging crowd of aspiring crooners at the venue.

 After three songs and three nods from judge Adnan Sami in successive rounds ? Raina beeti jai and In aankho ki masti and Jodi tor daak shune keu in chorus ? she landed a ticket to Mumbai for the zonal round, with nine other singers from Calcutta. 

 After two more rounds, it was down to 25, with three from Calcutta. ?In Mumbai, we were to stay for four days in the hotel, without any contact with our parents,? recounts Shilpi.

 On the second day, the participants, now further reduced to 15 by Sami and A.R. Rahman, recorded a song composed by Himesh Reshammiya. ?The song meant for us was easy. I preferred the tune for the male contestants,? she says, humming the first line of Tere kandhepe sar rakh ke, that got her into the top 10.

 The round will be televised on Thursday at 9 pm. But Shilpi is not sure whether she will get to see the show at home.

 ?The channel is not part of our regular cable bouquet and I have to beg and plead with the cablewallah to tune in.? On most days she plays safe and cycles off to her aunt?s place where [V] is a certainty.

 It is not the thought of seeing herself on television that excites Shilpi. ?Being on TV now is no big deal. Girls who start learning how to sing today can be seen on some local channel tomorrow,? shrugs the 20-year-old. Her interest lies in judging her own performance. ?During the contest, I was too tense to gauge how I had fared.?

 Other than getting a taste of how singers can plan a busy day (?Yoga, psychological training, rehearsal with orchestra, then the actual performance in the evening? there was hardly time to breathe during the last few days?), Shilpi feels she has not gained much.

 ?I am specialising in ghazals, with a government of India scholarship. I have to send the authorities in Delhi a progress report every six months. A performance at Dover Lane Music Conference would score much higher with them,? she tunes off, feet firmly on the ground.

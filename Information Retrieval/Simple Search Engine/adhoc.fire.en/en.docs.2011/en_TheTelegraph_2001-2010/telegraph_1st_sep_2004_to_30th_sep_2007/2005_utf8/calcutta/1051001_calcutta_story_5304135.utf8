The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Plumed drums beat death knell

 A well-decorated dhak means a wealthy patron

 Not just the pulsating beats, the colourful plumes adorning the drums, too, draw Calcuttans to dhakis during their annual Puja visit to the city. But seldom do people realise the number of birds that are killed illegally by hunters every year to decorate the dhaks.

 A survey by the Friends of Wetlands and Wildlife (FWW), along with Calcutta University?s marine science department and Marine Biological Research Institute, reveals how thousands of birds, many of them protected, are killed for plumage, that goes into decorating the drums.

 According to the survey, almost all of the 1,200-odd dhakis who perform in some 2,000 pandals in the city use feathers of protected species. Among the favourites are egrets and herons.

 Alarmed at the findings, the forest department has asked divisional forest officers (DFOs) to put an end to the killing of birds. ?We have asked the DFOs of Nadia and Murshidabad to take immediate action. We are also talking to Calcutta Police,? said chief conservator of forests Atanu Raha.

 A few of the dhakis interviewed by Metro said they could not use feathers of poultry birds for decoration, as they are considered inauspicious. ?Besides, egrets always seems to bring us luck. We don?t kill birds, we only buy the plumes,? said Swapan Mondol, a resident of Krishnagar, Nadia. 

 Montu Jana, a dhaki from Burdwan, said: ?Fake feathers are not very attractive, and everyone knows that an attractive drum gets us a good puja organiser.? 

 A kg of egret feathers, he added, comes for Rs 400-500. 

 Investigations have revealed that 18,000 to 21,000 birds are killed by hunters every year in various districts ? including Murshidabad, Nadia, Burdwan, Birbhum and Bankura ? for plumage. 

 ?Our survey revealed that only flight feathers are used to decorate the drums. Feathers that are four to five inches in length and unruffled are plucked after the birds are killed,? said Gitanath Ganguly, working president of FWW.

 ?After the survey, we got in touch with the Zoological Survey of India and they confirmed the identity of the birds,? he added.

 A maximum of 15 to 20 feathers are obtained from a single full-grown bird. At least 40 bunches of sliced feathers are required to make a feather tail for a drum and to make a single tail, 150 to 200 birds are needed.

 BBA course seats go a-begging

 - Infrastructure lack blamed for college vacancies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After introducing the bachelor in business administration (BBA) course with much fanfare three years ago, Calcutta University (CU) is finding it difficult this year to fill up seats. There are few takers for the course at most of the CU-affiliated colleges.

 Worried principals of a number of colleges teaching BBA have approached the university authorities to explore all possibilities to ensure that the seats get filled up this year.

 Fewer students are expected to go in for BBA this year as students have performed very poorly in the common entrance test held by the university.

 There are about 320 seats in the BBA course. Nearly 300 students have passed the common entrance test this time, CU officers said. 

 It is learnt that the course has failed to attract aspiring students mainly for two reasons. The course is self-financed and students are required to pay high tuition and other fees, compared with other undergraduate courses like BA, B.Sc and B.Com. 

 Second, the infrastructure available in most of the colleges offering the course is not on a par with what the country?s reputed business schools offer.

 ?This is a serious problem. We (the university) have called an emergency meeting next week to find out a solution. We cannot let the colleges run the course with a bulk of their seats remaining vacant,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs). 

 It is essential for the colleges to get all their BBA seats filled up because none of these institutions get any assistance from the government for running the course. 

 The colleges have to depend on students? fees and it is difficult for the institutions to keep the courses going if the bulk of their seats remain vacant year after year, the officials added. 

 Concerned at the problem, the CU authorities are considering a proposal to allow colleges to admit students directly this year, if too many seats remain vacant. 

 The BBA course was introduced to open avenues for students having an aptitude for modern business studies. The university decided to admit students through a common entrance test to ensure transparency. 

 Among the colleges in the city that offer BBA courses are St Xavier?s, Scottish Church, Bhawanipur Education Society, Asutosh, APC College and Deshbandhu. 

 ?St Xavier?s and Scottish Church are the only two institutions where the seats get filled up according to their capacities. It is difficult to find takers for the seats in the remaining institutions,? said a senior official of the university.

 According to him, after examining the past two years? trend, it was found that students take the common entrance test with a view to finding a berth in the two top colleges ? St Xavier?s and Scottish Church.

 Today silver and stones have become a fashion statement, complimenting current jewellery trends like never before. To experience the world of silver jewellery and showpieces, take a peek into Saakshi, that opened at City Centre on July 17.

 The meena jewellery in silver with folk and tribal influences are from Rajasthan, claims Nikhil Kothari of Saakshi. The range in oxidised silver is popular with trendy teens, college-goers as well as corporate women. Simple designs with or without stones are good to matches for western outfits.

 With gold plating, the colour comes off easily due to humidity or water. To ensure longevity of the colour, we use the process of gold forming. Electroplating makes the jewellery last longer. The cut and finish of the American diamonds are exclusive. Our aim is to provide customers quality cut and finish that look real, yet is safe wherever and whenever, explains Kothari.

 The jadau, kundan and polki range with traditional designs from Jaipur come in precious as well as semi-precious stones. They can be matched with maang tikas, anklets, bangles and toe-rings.

 The lockets and pendants in American diamond are suitable for everyday wear. The heavier necklaces are pack-ins for special occasions.

 Also on offer is the Victorian range. We have Victorian sets with both gold and silver as the base. Those with silver are trendy, adds Kothari.

 Apart from the necklaces, balis and jhumkas, the bridal range includes maang tikas, haathfuls, key rings and baju bands.

 Also on offer are figurines and other showpieces in silver. The prices of the jewellery start at around Rs 600.

 Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and Ewan McGregor were considered for the role of Neo before it went to Reeves.

 Reeves was recovering from a neck surgery during the four-month training with martial experts. He had to wear a neck brace throughout the period.

 Dus (2005)

 Director Anubhav Sinha

 Cast Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Abhishek Bachchan, Zayed Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Esha Deol, Dia Mirza, Raima Sen, Pankaj Kapoor, Gulshan Grover

 Plot Terrorist Jamwal wants to blow up a football stadium in Canada but to do that he has to get the Indian Anti-terrorist Squad out of the way. 

 Dus was a dream project of director Mukul Anand which had to be shelved because of his sudden death. The film about terrorism features Sanjay Dutt, Salman Khan, Shilpa Shetty and Raveena Tandon. 

 Director Sinha didn?t like what he saw of Zayed in his first film Chura Liya Hai Tumne and didn?t want to cast him initially.

 Pakistani star Jawed Sheikh had an important role in the film but due to damage of raw stock his portions had to be left out.

 Sanjay Dutt loved the script so much in just three minutes that he called up Abhishek, who was in Calcutta then shooting for Yuva, to join the cast.

 Gulshan Grover, considered to be one of the dus characters, doesn?t have a single dialogue in the whole film.

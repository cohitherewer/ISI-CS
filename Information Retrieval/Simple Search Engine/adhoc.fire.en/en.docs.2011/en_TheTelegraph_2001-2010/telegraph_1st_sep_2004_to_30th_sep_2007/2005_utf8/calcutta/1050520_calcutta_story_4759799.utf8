 Twilight tempest

 Private and intimate human relationships are the most prone to vulnerability as they are born from our deep-seated desires and emotions. Exploring the complex and fragile nature of such relationships and the disturbing impact they can have on normal family life, Sayaks production, Saanjhbela, tells the tale of Shrimoyee (Swatilekha Sengupta), who is suddenly thrust into an emotional and moral crisis. A middle-aged, single mother of two teenaged children, her life is thrown into total disarray with the arrival of Alokesh (Meghnad Bhattacharya), a man with whom she shared a secret relationship in the days of her adolescence. Her personal predicament wreaks havoc in her relationship with her son and daughter, threatening to destroy the apparent serenity of her quiet, placid life. The conflicting emotions, mental agony and dilemma experienced by both Shrimoyee and her children highlight their severe stress and emotional trauma, making their plight all the more poignant.

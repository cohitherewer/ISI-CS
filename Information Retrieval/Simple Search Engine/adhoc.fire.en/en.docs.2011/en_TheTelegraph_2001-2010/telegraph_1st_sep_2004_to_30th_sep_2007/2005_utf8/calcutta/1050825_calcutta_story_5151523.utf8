 German Black Forest, Coffee in Chocolate Rulade, Apple Covalado Pie, Mocha Delight? The accompaniments that go with your coffee are undergoing a total revamp. In keeping with the global trend, the Caf? Coffee Day chain is giving its food section a new look.

 Caf? Coffee Day predominantly is a coffee outlet but the food (or snacks, as they are popularly known) served here is also a favourite with the people. It forms an integral part of the chain. The food fusion in our outlets across the country are carefully researched and localised, says Subbanna Kannur, country head, food and beverage, Caf? Coffee Day. 

 But the trend all around the world is changing. The cookies and pakoras are giving way to desserts, which not only taste good but also look inviting. As the biggest coffee chain in the country, we are committed to introducing our consumers to global eating trends, adds Kannur. 

 Moreover, there has been a constant demand for new accompaniments at the outlets due to the changing eating habits of people. And the factors behind the trend are many. 

 A cup of coffee has always been a great timepass for people. A lot of time is spent gossiping over numerous cups of coffee but the environment in which they did it earlier has undergone a major change. The venues have become swank and upmarket. Similarly, the quintessential black coffee has given way to mochas and frappes. With all this happening, people also want a change in the food they are eating. The typical Chicken Pakoras are out, says Kannur. 

 Secondly, there are those who depend on their nearest coffee shops for their meals. So, the food served has to be filling.

 The food and beverage head of Caf? Coffee Day strongly recommends the Sizzling Brownies. 

 The concept is being introduced here for the first time. It is a warm dessert topped with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. We thought if we give it a sizzling effect, it would also have a visual impact, says Kannur. 

 The sizzling brownies are moist, dense, chewy and chocolatey. It is a mix of melted butter and chocolate served piping hot and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. 

 The new range of desserts would be served at all Cafe Coffee Day outlets within the next two weeks. 

 The pocket pinch would be Rs 75-plus.

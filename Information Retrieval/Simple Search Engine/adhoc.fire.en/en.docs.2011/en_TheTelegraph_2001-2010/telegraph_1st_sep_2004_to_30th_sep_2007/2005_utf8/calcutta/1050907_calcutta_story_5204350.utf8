 Double deceit

 A humorous play with a subtly delivered socio-economic message, Manmoyee Girls School addresses critical issues pertaining to the problem of unemployment in an entertaining manner. Damodar, a philanthropist zamindar, wishes to open a school to educate the women of his village. He invites applications for the post of teachers, on the condition that only married couples can apply. Desperately seeking jobs, Manas and Niharika, who are total strangers, apply by pretending to be husband and wife, and get appointed. What follows is anybody?s guess, as the two are forced to behave as though they are married to each other for the sake of retaining their jobs.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Manmoyee Girls? School, produced by Samikshan

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

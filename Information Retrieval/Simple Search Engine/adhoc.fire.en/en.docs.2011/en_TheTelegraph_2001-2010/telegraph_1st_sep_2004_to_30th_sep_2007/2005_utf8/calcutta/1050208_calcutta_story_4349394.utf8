 In the net for Rs 10-crore chit fund fraud

 - Police ferret out Mahestala felon from Midnapore haven

 DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES

 Cracking a racket that siphoned off more than Rs 10 crore from its investors, police on Monday arrested Mriganko Shekhar Guria, 45, a resident of Basudebpur, under Mahestala police station, on the southern fringes of the city.

 ?Guria is the kingpin of an unauthorised chit fund, in operation for approximately five years. We came to know of the racket after some local residents complained about him,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). 

 ?Guria has been absconding since January 24. We received a tip-off about his whereabouts and arrested him at Chandipur, in Midnapore.? Gupta added: ?We have also detained two of his associates.?

 In January, enraged residents of Budge Budge, Mahestala, Metiabruz, Birlapur and some adjacent areas had met local CPM leader Sandip Mondal and complained about Guria. They claimed to have invested large sums of money with him, and complained of not getting any returns of late.

 On January 18, representatives of the aggrieved subscribers meet Guria in the presence of Mondal, and made him promise to repay the money within a week.

 However, on January 24, when some of the investors turned up at Guria?s house, they found it locked. Neighbours told them that the family had left town.

 The furious investors then met local MLA Mursalin Mollah of the CPM, who reported the incident to the superintendent of police. 

 A complaint was registered and police started to keep a watch on the area.

 Grilling the Gurias? domestic help, police found out that one of the children had mentioned going to Midnapore to visit relatives. From that lead, the investigating team traced Guria to his hideout and arrested him.

 Guria used to support his wife and two kids by giving private tuitions, police said. 

 ?He is a great conversationalist, with an ability to gain people?s confidence. That much is evident from the way he has been duping people,? said an officer of Mahestala police station.

 ?He has revealed how he would chat up the guardians of his students. He would tell them how he supplemented his meagre income with a chit-fund business, and coax them to invest small sums of money, promising 10 per cent returns,? the officer added.

 Guria also provided local shop-owners with loose change for a commission. 

 Over the first two years, he increased the interest rate to 20 per cent, attracting individual investments to the tune of Rs 5 lakh.

 Guria even set up a furnished office at Kanchannagar and had become popular by donating generously to local clubs and to charity.

 Trouble broke out in Kaltala, near Dum Dum, after a 30-year-old man, Biswanath Mondal, alias Bishu, was found murdered in a playground on Thursday morning. 

 With twin murders within a fortnight being reported from the area, residents are panic-stricken, while criminals roam free. 

 Police suspect the murders to be fallout of turf battles. Bishu had earlier been arrested on murder charges.

 ?Biswanath has a murky past and had served an eight-month jail sentence two years ago in connection with a murder in the area. He had links with some criminals and the killing may be a fall-out of gang warfare. We have started an inquiry,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.

 Local residents on Thursday spotted the body of the man in a pool of blood on a local playground, barely a few hundred metres from his residence, and informed police. 

 Before police arrived, local people had identified the body and informed his family members. ?It was terrible. The head was partially smashed and there were multiple marks of injuries on his body, inflicted by some sharp weapons.? said Amitava Sen, a neighbour. 

 Lila Mondal, mother of Bishu, said that on Wednesday, around 11 pm, some youths called Bishu out and they left together. 

 ?After that, I came to know this morning that he has been killed,? said the widow. 

 Local people were disturbed by the murder. ?Only a fortnight ago, a local youth, Guddi, was murdered in the area. A year ago, a youth named Manik was killed. In 2002, Shankar was found dead on the road. Besides these killings, extortion by local gangs, who double as suppliers of building materials, has become a regular feature,? alleged a septuagenarian resident of the area. 

 The allegation was echoed by other residents of the area, who blamed police inaction as one of major reasons for increasing violence in the area. 

 ?The criminals are roaming free but police are not acting against them. While we see them almost every day, we cannot dare to raise our voice against them,? complained a resident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Woo-tourist blitz in killer wave wake

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 A new diving centre on Phi Phi Islands. A boat trip to Khao Lak. And delightfully low rates for a visit to these exotic locations in southern Thailand, ravaged by a tsunami not so long ago.

 Under the ?Loving Andaman Sand and Sea? project, the Thai government has come out with a slew of packages to woo tourists from Calcutta to its southern destinations. 

 To boost the packages, Thai Airways is planning to increase the number of flights from Calcutta. At present, five flights operate between the city and and Bangkok. 

 Plans are ready to allow Calcuttans the best available connecting flight to Phuket, Krabi or any other destination in Thailand, at a 30 per cent discount on the already-slashed domestic fares.

 ?To us, Calcutta represents a big market. It?s time efforts were made to turn its potential into a reality,? said Satish Kapoor, district sales manager (eastern zone), Thai Airways.

 Every year, around 100,000 Calcuttans travel to Thailand. And with the host government announcing the alluring packages, Calcuttans are increasingly turning their focus to the south of the country.

 ?For the past few weeks, our offices have been flooded with inquiries about Phuket, Krabi or Phi Phi Islands. I am hopeful that in the next few weeks, at least 2,000 people will fly to these locations,? said Kumar Mitra, manager (outbound tours), RJ Tradewings.

 ?All of a sudden, travelling to southern Thailand is a lot cheaper than visiting Goa, Kulu or Manali. Besides, the Thai trips are worth every single rupee a tourist coughs up. A three-night (all inclusive) package for Goa costs around Rs 21,000 per person, and for southern Thailand around Rs 19,000,? Mitra added.

 The Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) hopes that within a few weeks, Thailand will draw around 4,000 people a month from the city. A majority of these people are expected to head for the south. 

 ?We have just returned from an extensive tour of the south. You can hardly figure out that the areas had been devastated by the December 26 tsunami. The reconstruction work has been superb and the feedback from the people visiting Phuket now has been very encouraging,? said TAFI chairman Anil Punjabi. 

 In a bid to counter threats from other airlines, such as Singapore Airlines, which has launched a non-stop Singapore-New York flight, Thai Airways will launch a Bangkok-New York non-stop 16-hour flight on May 1. 

 ?People from Calcutta will get priority in bookings on the new flight,? said Kapoor.

 Youth beeline at bookstore

 - Fav titles score as Net chatting and telly lose charm among young adults

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Chatting has lots its chirp and the idiot box attracts fewer eyeballs. Reading seems to be the latest preoccupation of the young adults. Evidence: step into any of the new-age bookstores and you?ll find children in various corners with their heads burrowed in their favourite titles. 

 Not so long ago, books played a third fiddle to cable television and the Net. But there has been a renewed interest in reading. And the Harry Potter series and Siddharth Basu?s quiz books have been major drivers in sending the kids in a beeline to the bookstores. 

 ?Young adults constitute up to 60 per cent of the footfall in the Park Street store. These kids are either in high school or college,? says Rajiv Chowdhry, COO, Oxford Bookstore. 

 The trend has been taking shape for the past couple of years with more and more kids losing interest in television and chatting on the Net. The annual growth in this segment is an eye-opener. Landmark has witnessed a steady growth of 25 per cent. Crossword, on Elgin Road, has seen a similar growth of 30 per cent annually.

 If Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl are popular in the slightly younger age group, J.K. Rowling is a universal favourite. The preferred categories are fiction, classics and general knowledge. Every time these youngsters make a purchase, the bill amount is between Rs 250 and Rs 400. 

 The importance of this segment is lost on none. ?The young adult segment forms a major part for the publishers and booksellers now,? says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword. He adds: ?The children spend a good amount of time in the store, going through the books.? 

 The new bookstores, a far cry from the dark and dingy boi para stalls, have also played a vital role in attracting footfall. The cool environs, good organisational skills and a variety of topics arranged neatly on the racks make book-buying a pleasure.

 Even today?s parents encourage their kids to read. ?The parents prefer their kids buy books rather than compact discs, which are priced far lower. They equate reading with good academic performance,? signs off Jatia.

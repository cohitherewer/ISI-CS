 Mandira Bedi: Special appearance

 She?s the first lady of cricket, and has graced the big and small screen in a myriad roles. Mandira Bedi will appear on television on Monday night in yet another persona that will have her fans in splits. Catch her as a highly neurotic actress in the show Sarabhai vs Sarabhai on STAR One on January 31, at 9 pm.

 The quintessential high society family will play host to Mandira, in the role of a well-known Bollywood actress who bedazzles the depressed Mr Sarabhai with her charm.

 Maya Sarabhai (Ratna Pathak Shah) is her usual socialite self, but husband Indravadan aka Indu (Satish Shah) is of the opinion that there is no ?magic? left in their marriage. In fact, he feels Maya has started behaving more like his mother than his wife.

 In these stressful circumstances, Indu meets Bollywood babe Cookie (Mandira) and promptly falls in love with the neurotic actress. Indu confides in Sahil (Sumeet Raghavan), asking for help in hiding the bare facts from Maya ? Cookie?s plans of a quiet, romantic dinner with Indu. 

 In a twist to the comic tale, Maya finds a jar of cookies at home and assumes Indu is eating forbidden sweets behind her back. She fires the servants. Indu overhears, and thinks Maya knows about Cookie, the actress. 

 Nevertheless, he wants to propose to Cookie. But the illicit romance is ruined when she tells him that he reminds her of her dad. Indu returns home dejected and Maya has an argument with him about ?cookies?. Both, however, are talking of different cookies. 

 To round up this tale of love and laughter, Indu wins Maya?s heart when he tells her he did it all to win her attention. Maya is pleased, but doesn?t realise that her husband is referring to Cookie, the actress? Tune in to this special episode.

the Mantra mahurat. Picture by Aranya Sen

 At a sprawling house in Alipore, editor-turned-director Rabi Ranjan Moitra is busy shooting his spooky film Mantra, involving a child and his doll. 

 Last Friday found the director assembling his actors for the mahurat of Mantra, which is also the first Bengali feature film to have rolled out of the RPG Saregama stable. Apart from the cast comprising Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Locket Chatterjee and Swastika Mukherjee, Tollywood?s leading man Prosenjit dropped into to catch up with the goings on.

 The battle to decide Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri is on in full swing in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana. To unravel the political tangles for the viewer, STAR News has launched on-the-ground initiatives to connect with the aam junta and explore the ?real issues?. 

 The election special programming package includes daily bulletins, opinion polls, live debates, exit polls, counting-day specials, travelogues, satires and more. The coverage kicked off with the daily news bulletin Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri, at 5.30 pm and at 8.30 pm from Monday to Friday.

 The channel has rolled out two election raths, which are traversing through the three states, visiting around 50 towns in a month-long exercise creating awareness on the debates titled Kahiye Netaji conducted in the towns, encouraging people to participate. It provides the electorate with a platform to quiz their local netas, and is telecast live and uncensored every day at 6.30 pm.

 Also, three STAR News teams are touring towns in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana, presenting detailed reports on each, from history and culture to the problems facing the people and the political developments, as well as conversations with residents and local leaders. These reports are beamed daily as part of the election bulletins, in Magadh Express and Haryana Roadways.

 Take a light-hearted look at the elections through Pol Khol, cartoons and other satires. The programming includes specials for each polling day and the counting day. It will end with a post-poll special.

 Mahesh Rangarajan, noted political analyst and commentator, is the STAR News resident expert throughout the election coverage, with analysis and commentary on the drama as it unfolds.

 For one, it was a welcome note. For the other, it was time to say goodbye. More than a thousand episodes later, Alpha Bangla?s longest running soap Ek Akasher Niche has wrapped up to pave the way for yet another family entertainer, Ek Din Pratidin. The cast and crew of both the serials gathered at Alpha Sourjo, the event organised at Moksha, to celebrate the occasion a week ago. 

 Anindo Banerjee, director of Ek Din Pratidin, introduced the lead pair Aparajita and Rishi Kaushik and others who will enact the drama unfolding a clash of traditional and modern values, Monday to Friday. 

 Facing the camera after a long time will be veteran actress Bharati Devi. The event also found the favourite characters from Ek Akasher Niche hit the dance floor and sway to tracks belted out by Bangla band Kalpurush.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You 

express yourself better in writing than with the spoken word. You are honest, 

with a strong morale. A career linked with science or mathematics will suit you 

best. There will always be scope for travel in your life. A little more time for 

a loved one can work wonders in the relationship. ? Kusum Bhandari

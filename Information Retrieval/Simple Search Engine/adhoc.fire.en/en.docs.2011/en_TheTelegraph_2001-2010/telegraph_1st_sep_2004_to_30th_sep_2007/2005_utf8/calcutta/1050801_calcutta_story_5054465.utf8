 After a hot and sweaty summer, the monsoon brings with it a fresh spirit that inspires creativity. Its a time for people to express themselves through any creative medium, be it dance, poetry or art. Its also a time when one feels really happy and wants to look good. Thats the kind of spirit we have captured through our work, say fashion designers Tapash Biswas and Sudhir Ranjan Nayak. 

 The duo, selling its work under the label Stae, operates from their workshop at 29/7, Lake Place.

 A splash of colours to brighten up the dull rainy season is the designer duos latest offering. Light pastel hues like baby pink, soft lilac, lime green and sky blue are combined with brighter shades like red, electric blue and deep orange.

 The ready-to-wear ensembles are adorned with subtle embellishments. Interesting hemlines and elegant cuts are the high points of the line. These are teamed with bags that are either printed or embellished with chunky colourful stones and stylised sequins. 

 The saris are adorned with graphic prints that lend a dash of modernity to this traditional attire. Intricate detailing coupled with high-quality tailoring is our forte, says Tapash. 

 The saris feature a lot of panelling and ornamentation with hand-embroidery. 

 Georgettes are the mainstay of the monsoon collection, with almost 90 per cent of the garments made of the flowy fabric.

 Prices start at Rs 7,000 for both saris and kurta sets.

 Woody whiff

 Shoppers Stop at City Centre recently added a few fresh fragrances from the house of Jean Paul Gaultier to its existing array of perfumes. 

 In association with Baccarose Perfumes Pvt Ltd, two new womens scents were launched by fashion designer Agnimitra Paul. 

 Jean Paul Gaultiers fanciful creations echo his zest for life and hence are sprinkled with spirited humour and bursts of laughter, said a spokesperson for the brand.

 The two fragrances are Classique and Fragile. Classique has a very feminine rosy smell, blended with orange blossom, ginger, vanilla and woody amber. 

 Fragile, on the other hand, bears a whiff of tuberose, with a mixture of musk and fruity fragrances. 

 Both the scents can be found as perfumes, eau de toilettes, deodorants, bath lotions and shower gels. 

 The latest line for men is Le Male, which reminds one of the pear and fringe pump sprays at barber shops. Essences of lavender, orange, cinnamon and cumin combine to create a distinctly woody smell. 

 This range is available as after-shave lotions, deodorants, easy-to-apply shower gels and soaps. 

 The scented products for both men and women are priced between Rs 2,500 and Rs 4,800.

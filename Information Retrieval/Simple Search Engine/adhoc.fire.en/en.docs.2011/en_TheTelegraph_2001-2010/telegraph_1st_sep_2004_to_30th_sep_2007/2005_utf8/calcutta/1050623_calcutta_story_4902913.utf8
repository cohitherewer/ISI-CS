The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Failed student passed by court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of the high court on Wednesday upheld the judgment of Justice Indira Banerjee, of the same court, directing Calcutta University to declare an M.Sc computer science student ?passed? in his second-year examinations.

 The court had stated that the student had been ?mistakenly? declared unsuccessful by the authorities.

 The student, Abhisekh Banerjee, a resident of Salt Lake, had been declared unsuccessful in the final examinations of the second-year of the course. According to the marksheet, his failure to obtain pass marks in one of the theoretical papers was the reason. Banerjee had scored 14 out of 100 in the paper.

 He wrote to the university authorities, pointing out that as per the norms, a student should be declared successful even if he fails in a theoretical paper.

 ?If a student obtains more than 240 out of a total of 600 marks in theoretical subjects, he should be passed even if he fails in one of the papers,? Banerjee wrote.

 The student had scored 280 out of 600 marks in the theoretical papers.

 He added: ?According to the existing norm, a student will have to get at least 50 per cent marks in the practical papers to pass the examination. I have got more than 80 per cent marks in the practical examination.?

 After the university authorities declined to pass him, Banerjee moved Calcutta High Court.

 His lawyers ? Shaktinath Mukherjee and Uttam Majumdar ? argued that the university authorities had violated norms by not passing their client in the examinations.

 The lawyer appearing for the university told the court that the norms framed by the university are changeable.

 ?It is the discretion of the university whether or not a norm will exist or be changed,? he said.

 After the hearing was over, Justice Indira Banerjee observed that the contention of the petitioner was right and directed the university authorities to declare him passed.

 The university moved an appeal against the judgment of Justice Banerjee before the division bench of Justice Prabir Kumar Samanta and Justice R.N. Sinha of the same court.

 The division bench, after hearing both sides, upheld the earlier judgment by Justice Banerjee.

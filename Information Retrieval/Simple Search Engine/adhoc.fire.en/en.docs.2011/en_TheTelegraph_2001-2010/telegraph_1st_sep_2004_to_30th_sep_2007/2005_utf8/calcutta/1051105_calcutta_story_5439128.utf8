 Passport in cool comfort

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The regional passport office (RPO), close to Writers? Buildings, will be air-conditioned soon, regional passport officer M.K. Singh said on Thursday.

 ?We have been suggesting that the government consider the proposal in view of the growing demands on this office for services,? Singh said. 

 The passport office, at 4, Brabourne Road, registers a footfall of a few thousands every day in connection with issuance of passports, inquiries and processing of papers. It has to work in tandem with police and various government agencies.

 ?Queueing cannot be stopped at the RPO because of the growing demand for various services,? said Singh. ?For example, this office has to issue not less than 500 passports a day, in addition to the substantial volume of paper work, handling of queries and interviews with members of the public and government agencies. But we have been thinking of providing relief to our patrons who visit the office braving sultry weather and heavy rain.?

 The ministry of external affairs was initially hesitant, because air-conditioning meant additional investment considering that a new RPO building is already coming up at Ballygunge Park Road. Since it will take several years to come up, the proposal was okayed.

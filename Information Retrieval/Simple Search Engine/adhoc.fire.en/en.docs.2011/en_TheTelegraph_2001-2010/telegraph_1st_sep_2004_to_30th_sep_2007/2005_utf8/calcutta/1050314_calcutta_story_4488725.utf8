 Parking bar near intersections

 Soumya Halder: Luxury buses often queue up along APC Road near the Khanna cinema crossing. This creates a bottleneck at the busy intersection, causing unmanageable traffic snarls. Also, the problem of traffic congestion near Hatibagan is getting worse every day.

 Though it is the responsibility of the traffic department to look after the matter and sergeants often make rounds of the area, police stations, too, try to ease traffic snarls. We generally do not permit parking of vehicles near busy intersections like Khanna. I have made a note of the complaint and will certainly look into the matter.

 Regarding traffic congestion near Hatibagan, the road space has become very narrow and inadequate for the huge volume of traffic passing through the area. The problem is compounded by the illegal autorickshaws. Visitors to the Hatibagan market often walk along the main road, further narrowing the space for vehicles. We understand that as the hawkers occupy the pavements, the pedestrians have no choice but to use the road. You cannot blame the police alone for the situation.

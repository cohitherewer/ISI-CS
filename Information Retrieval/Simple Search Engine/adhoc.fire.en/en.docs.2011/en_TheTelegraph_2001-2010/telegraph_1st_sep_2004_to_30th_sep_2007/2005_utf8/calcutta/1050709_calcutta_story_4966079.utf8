 If you have straight hair and you want it to look curly for a change, there are many style solutions that can help you achieve the desired effect. 

 An easy option, of course, is to get it permed, but, this effect is long-term and a rather drastic step if the intention is to get some bounce into your hair. For soft curls that last just about till your next wash, there is a far more gentle option. Hair stylist Raman Bhardwaj at A.N. John takes the tong route, in which a curling iron is used to produce soft curls with plenty of bounce.

 Lack lustre

 If you have straight hair that is limp and dry with no body whatsoever, your hair style may have to be changed first. Here, Raman shortens Cheenas hair and styles it in soft layers with an asymmetrical fringe running across her face. 

 Straight stride

 Starting off with clean, damp hair, Raman applies a small amount of mouse like LOr?als Tech Ni Art Volume Plus with Liss Control Plus spread evenly across the roots, middle and ends and of the strands.

 Thereafter, Cheenas hair has been blast dried, or blowdried, straight.

 Curvy cut

 Using curling tongs, start curling the hair from the nape, tristing it in a cylindrical fashion. Continue moving up the scalp, taking small sections of hair, ensuring none of the strands are left out.

 Once dry, spray on a light coat of some kind of holding spray to set the hair in the desired manner. 

 Open out

 Run fingers through the hair in a slow, careful movement from the middle right through to the ends to open out the curls.

 This lends a natural look, as opposed to the artificial one created if the hair is left as it is post spray. A wide-toothed comb may not be a bad idea either. Another light touch of holding spray must be used to ensure the curls do not come undone altogether. 

 Frontal fringe 

 Make sure not to curl the hair around the fringe area. Straighten the asymmetrical fringe around the front hairline instead. The combination of a straight fringe with a body of curls gives a sleek look.

 Final look

 No more effort is required. The look is complete. Ensure the hair falls on both shoulders equally, with the fringe skimming over the eye. If you want to add some sheen to the soft, feminine look, gently rub on a dab of gloss control.

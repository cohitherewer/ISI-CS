 119 posts of judges filled in law leap 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Life may soon change for the better for people in the city and elsewhere in the state who are forced to spend a substantial part of their time shuttling between their homes and courts.

 The government has decided to appoint 119 magistrates across the state to improve the judicial system and clear pending cases.

 In November 2004, the state government had set up a panel to fill up over 200 vacant posts of judges. Appointments have been given to fill up 119 of them. ?The rest will be absorbed in due course,? said state law minister Nisith Adhikari.

 Of the total 568 subordinate courts across the city and the state, 207 do not have judges at all. As a result, the number of pending cases in subordinate courts has increased to 11 lakh.

 The want of judges also plagues some of the major courts in the city. At Calcutta High Court, 19 posts of judges are lying vacant. 

 In the past two financial budgets, the Centre had provided the state with funds for creating 135 fast track courts. But the government managed to create only 104 such courts and the money for the rest had to be returned to the Centre. 

 As a consequence, the Centre also recanted sanction for another 50 fast track courts.

 One of the main reasons for the lapse on the part of the state government was the scarcity of judges. According to rules, anybody less than an additional sessions judge cannot head a fast track court.

 Presently, Howrah Court, Sealdah Court, Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrate Court, City Civil and Sessions? Court and both civil and criminal courts in Alipore have only half the number of judges required. 

 Calcutta Labour Court, Small Causes Court, Land Tribunal and Debt Recovery Tribunal are run by a meagre 20 to 30 per cent of the required number of judges.

 ?The state government is trying to cripple the judiciary because it is exposing many of its misdeeds. The government is only introducing new laws to put lawyers in tight spots,? alleged Uttam Majumdar, general secretary, West Bengal Lawyers? Association.

 The law minister labelled the scarcity of judges as an ?artificial crisis? created to embarrass the government. ?No state can afford having so many judges,? he said.

 Sanatan Mukherjee, chairman, West Bengal Bar Council, countered: ?The minister is saying this to save his skin. He has done nothing to better the system.?

 A 2003 Supreme Court judgment makes it mandatory for states to have at least one judge/magistrate for every10,000 people. Going by this, West Bengal should have more than 4,000 courts.

 The state has challenged the judgment in the apex court, citing lack of funds. It has asked the Centre to bear the costs if it is forced to adhere to the judgment.

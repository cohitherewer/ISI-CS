 Tired of the same old standards belted out by bands increasingly hard to tell apart, lovers of live music ? and a drink or four ? discovered something fresh, young and Boom-Bass-Stick, this weekend.

 And if this is the talent of tomorrow, there is more than some hope for live western music in Calcutta, agreed most.

 The occasion was the launch of Crystal Grass and Jack Rabbit, winner and runner-up, respectively, of Boom-Bass-Stick: The Band Hunt, presented by The Telegraph Metro and Someplace Else (SPE).

 It was Jack Rabbits turn on Friday. The six-member progressive-blues band plugged in a little after 9 pm, loosening up with Tom Pettys Freefallin. The early start helped the band get into its groove before the pub filled up. The ride chugged along through America, Kula Shaker, U2 and more, and even encompassed two original compositions called Smoking it Up and Kiss by Fire.

 It was an opportunity of a lifetime, gushed Inam Hussain of Jack Rabbit, after the show. We even got our bassist, who had left the band to go abroad, to play for us for the last time. Jack Rabbit had a strong group of fans present, including friends and family, who cheered and jokingly jeered the band alike.

 Their style of playing reminds me a lot of Grateful Dead, offered Nondon Bagchi, ace drummer and one of the judges of Boom-Bass-Stick: The Band Hunt.

 The ride neared its end close to 11 pm, with Zombie by the Cranberries, which had impressed the judges during the contest. More! screamed the packed pub. Jack Rabbit obliged with their final song of the night, Lola by the Kinks.

 The practise ? everyday since they learnt of the SPE date, sometimes even for 12 hours ? had clearly paid off.

 Saturday night was a somewhat different story. From Prodigy to Prince, Michael Jackson to the Beatles, and a liberal sprinkling of Janis Joplin, Alicia Keys and almost everything in between. If nothing else, it was the range of Crystal Grass that bowled over the crowd expecting something special.

 Probably no other band at SPE has ever opened its set with a Prodigy song. The message from Crystal Grass was clear from the start ? wake up and pay attention to the music. From 10 pm to midnight, music lovers could do little else.

 The advantage was that almost all of us are part of another band called Insomnia and we are quite familiar with Someplace Else, offered Rahul Mehra. But playing with your own band is quite something else.

 Princes Musicology ? also the encore song ? was a huge hit, as was Collective Souls Gel and Michael Jacksons Give In To Me.

 The wide range was also responsible for a slightly mixed reaction. No sooner had the band veered a little off the beaten track (Pink Floyd, U2 and Dire Straits standards, of course) than the crowd began to thin a wee bit.

 But for those looking for great music, Tanya Sens brilliant vocals ? with able support from the six-member band ? proved a perfect mix.

 Come wrap-up time and some friends of the band joined in to jam. When they ended, it was clear that the band hunt winners had won over SPE as well. Crystal Grass will be back at SPE, Friday the 23rd.

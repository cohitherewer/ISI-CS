The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Where the twain meet

 Spandan, in association with the British Council and The Telegraph, presents a one-of-a-kind event that brings together Indian and Western music in a form and style hitherto not experimented. The brainchild of celebrated author Amit Chaudhuri, who is also a well-known vocalist in the north Indian classical tradition, This is Not Fusion attempts to dissolve the notes of discord that apparently exist between the two kinds of music. As its title suggests, the concert is much more than a meeting point of Western and Indian musical traditions. It seeks to harmoniously intersect the two musical lineages so as to create a new, beautiful language of music out of them. The blues, jazz, Spanish scales, folk melodies and Indian ragas come together in this performance by Chaudhuri, who sings Hindustani classical, accompanied by Amyt Datta (guitar), Debabrata Mitra (keyboards), Mainak Nag Chowdhury (bass) and Mayookh Bhaumik (tabla). An enchanting exploration of the common musical motifs and themes shared by the East and the West, this is one event that music connoisseurs can hardly resist.

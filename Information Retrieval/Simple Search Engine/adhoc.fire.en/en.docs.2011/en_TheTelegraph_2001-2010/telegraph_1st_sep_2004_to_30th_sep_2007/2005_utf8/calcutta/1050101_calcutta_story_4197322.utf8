 Drive despite court order 

 - Online lottery will be wiped out, asserts minister

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Only a day after Calcutta High Court announced an interim stay on the police drive against online lotteries operated by retailers in and around Calcutta, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government reaffirmed its decision to ?wipe out? the lotteries.

 ?Our objective is to wipe out such lotteries from the city and elsewhere in Bengal,? said finance minister Asim Dasgupta. ?We are determined to continue the police drive against the operators and retailers of online lotteries? They are ruining families? Our government cannot allow this to continue,? Dasgupta said.

 A high court vacation judge on Thursday issued the interim order following petitions by director of Sikkim State Lotteries L.P. Barphungpa and PAN India Network Infravest Private Limited, the sole distributor of Sikkim Online Lotteries. 

 The order restrained the city police from initiating any measure against Sikkim Online Lotteries. 

 Talking to mediapersons at Writers? Buildings, Dasgupta on Friday said the government had, so far, closed down 85 per cent of the outlets in Calcutta and in the districts. The rest will be closed down soon.

 The companies against which the state government has taken action are Playwin, Smartwin, Lotto, Super Lotto, Smart Lotto, VI, Dhandhanadhan, Technost, Sunshine, Classic ON-line and Lotus. 

 ?We had banned online lotteries in 2002. But the operators had ignored the government order and continued to function. We had been forced to take action against online lotteries to protect the poor, who were investing all their savings in them and were being driven to penury,? the minister claimed.

 Asked whether the government will continue the raids on lottery agents even after a case was filed in the high court against the state government for closing down hundreds of online outlets, Dasgupta replied: ?We will tell everything in the court as the case is pending there.? 

 ?You will be informed about all action the government takes,? he added.

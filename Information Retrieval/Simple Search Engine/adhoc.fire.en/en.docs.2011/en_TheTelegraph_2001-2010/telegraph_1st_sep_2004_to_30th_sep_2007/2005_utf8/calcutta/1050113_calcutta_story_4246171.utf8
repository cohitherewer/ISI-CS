 Civic bodies draw flak for filthy river

 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has rapped Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for supplying polluted Hooghly water to the city.

 The green bench of Calcutta High Court has already threatened penal action against the municipalities responsible for polluting the Hooghly.

 ?The river water is polluting the city. The CMC should stop supplying the water immediately,? WHO has said in its letter to the civic body.

 Thousands of vehicles are washed with the Hooghly water supplied by the CMC, which, according to a WHO survey, is very harmful for the city. ?The roadsides are also being damaged due to the use of the water,? the survey claims.

 Environment activist M.C. Mehta had registered a case in the Supreme Court, seeking its intervention in the Hooghly water pollution problem.

 The apex court assigned Calcutta High Court to hear out the case in the state.

 A green bench of the high court asked the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to conduct an inquiry into the problem. 

 The inquiry revealed that the discharge from the factories and 75 municipalities on either side of the river were primarily responsible for polluting the water.

 On the basis of the court?s directive, the pollution board took steps against the factories, forcing them to treat their discharge before it is emptied into the river.

 ?Even after repeated appeals, the municipalities have not taken similar measures. The bench had directed the representatives of 56 municipalities to attend court or face the consequences,? said environment activist Subhas Dutta, who is handling the case in high court.

 A number of councillors have expressed concern over the attitude of the civic authorities in dealing with the problem.

 Mayoral council member (water supply) Shovan Chatterjee has admitted in the monthly meeting of the CMC that the 10 gallons of Hooghly water supplied in the city is not fit for human use.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said the supply of Hooghly water in the city would be gradually decreased.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Catherine Zeta-Jones in Chicago

 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is not known for smiling down at musicals or even comedies. But with a spate of Broadway hits and classics making the journey from the stage to the silver screen of late, Metro takes a look at films from the past that found a working (often magic) formula. After all, greater recognition for this genre can only help the cause of Bollywood films finding global recognition?

Chicago: The Rob Marshall film that 

most recently managed to break through the prejudice (it was the first Best Picture 

winning musical since 1968?s Oliver!) is still considered in some quarters 

to have been an unlikely winner in 2002. Starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, who won 

the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the vixen Velma Kelly, Renee 

Zellweger as the ambitious Roxie Hart and Richard Gere as the hopelessly charming 

money-digging lawyer Billy Flinn, Chicago was a visually stunning, breathtakingly 

flawless marriage of topic and treatment. 

 Set in 1920s Chicago, the film version of the play written by Bob Fosse and Fred Ebb, with music by John Kander, explores with dark humour themes of ambition, fame and a system just waiting to be manipulated. As for the music? It was smart, sexy and sassy, and accompanied by some surprisingly good dance moves from the entire cast.

The Sound of Music: This all-time favourite 

film won the Best Picture award in 1965, beating Doctor Zhivago. Little 

can be said about this film that hasn?t already been said. The story, based on 

the true-life tale of the Von Trapps, was written by Howard Lindsay and Russell 

Crouse, with music by Oscar Hammerstein and Richard Rogers. 

 It was first performed in 1959, till 1963, and has been called Hollywood?s last great musical. In fact, the movie starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer was one of the last musicals to win the leading laurels.

My Fair Lady: Another musical that has 

become an inseparable part of growing up. My Fair Lady has its roots in 

George Bernard Shaw?s Pygmalion, written by Alan Jay Lerner with music 

by Frederick Loewe. Its original stage cast was Rex Harrison in the role of Henry 

Higgins that he retained and, interestingly, Julie Andrews as Eliza Doolittle. 

But the film-makers didn?t think Andrews would be a crowd-puller (released as 

it was a year before The Sound of Music) and replaced her with Audrey Hepburn. 

Not only did Cary Grant reportedly turn down the role of the cranky professor, 

he refused to watch it unless Harrison played it.

West Side Story: This modern-day interpretation 

of William Shakespeare?s Romeo and Juliet (here it?s Maria and Tony) ? 

which also has the master touch of The Sound of Music?s producer-director 

Richard Wise ? won the Best Picture award in 1961.

 With music by Leonard Bernstein and choreography by Jerome Robbins, this tale of love in the time of ethnic diversity and conflict is best known by the energy of its dance sequences.

 The unsung heroine also deserves special mention: Marni Nixon appeared as Sister Sophia in The Sound of Music and dubbed for both lead actresses Audrey Hepburn and Natalie Wood in My Fair Lady and West Side Story. She was also the uncredited voice of Anna in The King and I.

 The big ones that lost: Just a glimpse at the musicals that were passed up for the Best Picture award will show the Academy?s resistance to song and dance. 

 It includes some of the classics of cinema: The Wizard of Oz (1940, passed up for Gone With The Wind), The King and I (lost in 1957 to Around the World in 80 Days), Mary Poppins (was up against and lost to My Fair Lady in 1965) and Fiddler on the Roof (defeated by the action-thriller The French Connection in 1972). Just one year before Chicago, Moulin Rouge effectively revived the genre, but lost to A Beautiful Mind.

 This year, the only real contender is the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Weber?s The Phantom of the Opera, nominated for art direction, cinematography and original song.

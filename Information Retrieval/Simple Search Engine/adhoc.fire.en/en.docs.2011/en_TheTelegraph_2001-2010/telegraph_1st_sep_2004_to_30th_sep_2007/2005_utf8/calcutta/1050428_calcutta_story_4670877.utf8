The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Six hours to a sentence

 - Verdict wait stretches through day, pushes kin to brink

 A STAFF REPORTER 

The wait seemed endless.

 An hour-and-a-half after a bell sounded at 11 am inside the Presidency jail complex, most thought the proceedings had come to an end.

 A large crowd had gathered outside the compound, waiting to catch the drama of the American Center verdict, live, more than three years after the attack. 

 As tension peaked, huge gates suddenly opened to make way for a fleet of cars. Police officers waiting outside promptly stood up. Journalists, huddled outside on a lawn, rushed to get a glimpse of the action.

 But this was just one moment like many through the day. The wait hadn?t ended yet. 

 Journalists retreated, as did the huddle of curious onlookers, wondering how long it would take the session to come to an end and the judge to deliver his final verdict.

 ?It will be a long session and we are sorry about it. All of you will have to bear with us,? explained a senior police officer on duty outside the jail around 12.30 pm.

 Inside, officers from both the special branch and homicide wing of the detective department took turns stepping out of the courtroom for some fresh air. 

 An hour later, word spread that judge Basudeb Majumdar would be leaving for a while. The security cover was in position ? wardens, police and commandos ? as an Ambassador rolled out of the gate. The judge was gone for his only break of the day, the only time the tension at the jail compound eased.

 The judge returned an hour-and-a-half later. ?Uni eshey gechhen? aar koto kkhon (He?s back? How much longer could it take)?? asked one onlooker into his cell phone.

 The TV cameras were in position. Photographers jostled for the front row as police officers closed ranks.

 Finally, around 5.30 pm, the gates opened to let the lawyers out. Aftab Ansari?s lawyer emerged first. 

 ?The judgment is out. All seven have been sentenced to death,? announced Sayed Shahid Imam, sweat trickling down his face. His associates were ready with the media brief.

 ?It has been one of the longest sessions in my experience,? said Sarfiraj Ali, an assistant to Abu Baker Dhali, one of the lawyers fighting the convicts? case.

 Outside, anxious family members of the seven finally reached breaking point.

 ?We have been waiting for so long, only to hear that it is a death sentence! Is this human?? asked Kafil Alam, brother-in-law of convicted Hasrat Alam.

 Conflict over headmistress 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Airport English High School witnessed turmoil on Thursday over the suspension of its headmistress by the school?s managing committee. 

 Headmistress Rina Chatterjee was handed over the suspension letter after a decision taken by the committee earlier this week. Police were called in after the committee claimed Chatterjee had refused to accept the suspension.

 ?The order is illegal. The managing committee, which took over in 2004, bears a grudge against me,? Chatterjee said. 

 K.K. Baul, vice-president of the committee, said Chatterjee?s appointment was illegal and she had fixed her own salary. ?Her activities have been reported to the office of the chief minister,? Baul added.

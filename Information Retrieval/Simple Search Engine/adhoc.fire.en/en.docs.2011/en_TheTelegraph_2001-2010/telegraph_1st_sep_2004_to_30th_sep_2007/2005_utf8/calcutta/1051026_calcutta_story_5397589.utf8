The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flight fight over London

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The scramble for the London pie in the sky is hotting up and it?s the passenger who?s licking his chops.

 With Air-India taking British Airways head-on for the Calcutta traffic to London, record rates, super sops and heightened hospitality is the order of the pre-winter day.

 After matching the airline flight for flight (both have three a week), the national carrier has rolled out reduced fares ?Rs 18,990 round trip ? to tide over a lean-season crisis.

 British Airways offers an economy fare of Rs 19,000-plus.

 The Maharaja is also offering all first-class and business-class US-bound travellers free hotel stay in central London. ?The hotel stay is a goodwill gesture and an added incentive for all our US-bound passengers,? said Biswajit Mukherji, sales manager (east) Air-India.

 The immediate cause for the red carpet is the first real slump in Air-India bookings since its take-off on June 18, blamed on the holiday season when Southeast Asia is said to be the preferred destination.

 But the real reason could lie with the watch dial. British Airways has been hitting Air-India where it hurts ? scoring with better connectivity to European and American destinations from London.

 With British Airways flights landing much earlier (afternoon) in London, through passengers have a healthy head-start compared to Air-India, which arrives much later in the evening.

 ?We are working on our connectivity at the moment, but our early evening arrival time in London is ideal for over 70 per cent of our passengers who fall into the VFR (visiting friends and relatives) category,? countered an Air India spokesperson.

 The British Airways proclamation that it is ?the way to fly? is also based on its being ?very professional and prompt in its services?, felt Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 British Airways is going big on flexibility and finesses ? ?manage my booking? service for passengers to take care of their own travel plans; ?world traveller plus? for a premier economy cabin allowing more space, comfort and privacy.

 Air-India is making its way to the passenger?s pocket through his stomach, offering everything from ?a low-calorie and diabetic meal? to a wide variety of vegetarian dishes.

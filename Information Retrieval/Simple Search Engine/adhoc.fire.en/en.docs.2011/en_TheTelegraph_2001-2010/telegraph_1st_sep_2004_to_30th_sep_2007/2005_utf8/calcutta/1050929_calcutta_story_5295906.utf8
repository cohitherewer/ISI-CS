 Realtors? life term upheld 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday upheld the life term of three realtors, who 10 years ago had brutally killed a chartered accountant, Bideswari Prasad Agarwal.

 The trio had accused Agarwal of instigating poor people of Sanatan Mistri Lane, in Howrah, not to hand over their lands to them.

 The convicted realtors ? Ramlal Chowdhury, Ramraj Shaw and Bhawani Prasad Shaw of Howrah ? had poured a bucketful of concentrated nitric acid on Agarwal inside a Howrah court compound on February 20, 1995. 

 Two other realtors, Nebulal Shaw and Mahabir Shaw, also accused in this case, died during the trial.

 Residents of Sanatan Mistri Lane held rallies demanding exemplary action against the accused.

 Nebulal had suffered a massive heart attack and died inside the courtroom while a witness was deposing against him. Mahabir was murdered by his professional rivals.

 Additional sessions judge, Howrah, B.K. Majumdar, on August 30, 2000, had found the accused guilty of murdering Agarwal and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for life.

 Grand old men with their golfing way of life

 It?s a tale of two courses only old-timers remember. And although no one quite knows who had designed the two championship courses in the first place, they all hail the ?unheralded genius? who gave the world?s oldest golf club outside the British Isles its twin jewels.

 While the classic lines and deceptive degrees of difficulty of the existing or Old course are signature elements in the design, the extinct New course, which used to lie where the sprawling Golf Green neighbourhood with its spear-like TV tower now sits, was by no means a facile putt.

 ?The New course looked difficult and played tough, while the Royal (the current course) looks like knife through butter when you tee off, but can eat you up on a bad day,? says 82-year-old Raj Naidu, a member of Royal Calcutta Golf Club for the past 48 years.

 Naidu remembers how he and other new (?B?) members had to wait in the wings for two years before they became ?A? members and could set foot on the coveted Old course. ?No matter how good you were, they wouldn?t allow you on the Old course till you spent those two years soaking up the club?s ethos and doing the Triers? Tankards,? recalls Kuldip Singh, who at 79 still plays a round or two.

 Immediate past captain Ashit Luthra, whose father S.M. Luthra pioneered the Addicts Golfing Society of Eastern India in the early 70s, also remembers how they used to ?beg people to let us play just one hole on the Royal?. It was generally only women and children who had use of the New course, and ?B? members were kept ?out of the way of more accomplished golfers?.

 In 1968, more than 90 per cent of the par-72, 18-hole New course, which started from the 10th shamiana, went with 63.8 acres ?carved out and given away?, says club CEO Manmohan Singh.

 The rest was integrated with the current Royal course. But memories don?t fade easy and most senior playing members remember the big tank at the eighth, the ?charming? 14th or the ?king cobra? 17th, so called as it used to house a colony of cobras.

 A.P. Dutta, who at a ripe young 80 still plays 18 holes everyday, misses the old thatched-roof shamiana, while Naidu laments how the playing period has been stretched ever since Peter Thompson redesigned the Royal. ?Earlier, it never needed too much time to get off the greens and get on to the tees and we got ?slow-play? letters if we didn?t finish in three-and-a-half hours. Now, it has become longer and more generous, with lengthy walks from greens to tees,? he points out.

 It?s not just the bygone New course that old brigade misses at the Royal. The new tenor towards ?close-circuit cliques? and ?more personal golf? has also not gone down well. ?Earlier, a junior exec could go up to an MD and ask, ?Sir, will you play a four-ball with us?? That camaraderie on course is sadly missing today and each group is like an island,? complains Naidu.

 Nonetheless, the club which hosts the second oldest tournament in the world after the British Amateurs in the East India Amateurs (earlier called the Indian Amateurs), is upbeat.

 ?Of course, we can?t bring back the New course. But a lot of work has gone into our Old course on the occasion of the 175th anniversary and it is playing better than ever before,? declares the CEO.

 The entire institution got a facelift to mark the milestone and, as a bonus, there is a move afoot to revive the Addicts Society as well!

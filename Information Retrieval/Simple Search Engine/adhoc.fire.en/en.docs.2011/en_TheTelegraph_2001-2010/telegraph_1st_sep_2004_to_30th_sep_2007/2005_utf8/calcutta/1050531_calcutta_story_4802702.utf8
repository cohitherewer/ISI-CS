The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor may lose love?s labours

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s ?gifts to the city? could well be unveiled by his successor, with the commissioning of the Lindsay Street plaza, scheduled for May 31, 2004, being deferred to September 2005.

 At a meeting last week with officials and builders handling the New Market project, a livid mayor realised his rival would steal his long-overdue moment of glory if he doesn?t return to office after the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) elections in June.

 ?These are my ideas and that man (Bikash Bhattacharya, CPM nominee for mayor), if elected, will claim credit for them,? thundered Mukherjee.

 The Rs 33-crore Lindsay Street Parkomat project, pointed out the mayor, is a combination of three elements.

 Nearly 40,000 sq ft at street level will be turned into a pedestrian plaza, including a 4,000 sq ft fountain, kids? corner and coffee shop. 

 The second feature is a two-storeyed underground market. The third is a car park for 275 cars, also underground.

 ?I really wanted to commission the projects during my tenure, but it is not certain whether they will be ready by the second week of June,? rued the mayor.

 Despite mounting pressure, Simplex Projects Limited, which is building the complex, said it would only be ready for unveiling in late September.

 Unforeseen factors faced on the ground have led to the delay, said Simplex officials. 

 It will now be inaugurated in two phases ? the pedestrian plaza and shopping mall before the Pujas and the Parkomat by Christmas.

 ?We are planning two festival gift packages for the city,? said B.K. Mundra, chairman and managing director, Simplex Projects.

 Besides seasonal disturbances, like the monsoon and the Pujas, the construction work suffered setbacks following protests from local residents and traders in the locality, explained Arup Chaudhury, vice-president (engineering), Simplex Projects.

 Work started in April 2003 and December 2003 was the first tentative deadline for commissioning. 

 The project is a joint venture between the CMC and Simplex on a build-operate-transfer basis. The builders will run it for 20 years ? during which time Simplex will share five per cent of the gross revenue with the CMC ?before handing it over to the civic body.

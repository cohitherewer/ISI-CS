 Mango may rule the monsoon fruit basket, but some imports from the east are trying to compete with the king of the season.

 Rambutan and mangosteen are poised to invade the city produce racks.

 These fruits from Thailand are the stars of an ongoing promotion organised by the Royal Thai Consulate General in Calcutta at ITC Sonar Bangla and C3, City Centre.

 We have recently signed a Free Trade Agreement with the government of India. Amongst the 82 items, rambutan and mangosteen have been listed as two fruit items that can be traded freely, said Tharadol Thongruang, counsellor (commercial) of Royal Thai Embassy, in the city on Sunday with a delegation to promote the imports.

 Fruits like mango and banana are huge hits with the people of Calcutta. We want them to have a taste of these fruits from our country which we are serving here in the purest and juiciest form, added Thongruang.

 Rambutan and mangosteen are the most common fruits in stores and markets in Thailand through June, July and August. In terms of availability and popularity, they can be compared to mangoes and bananas in India.

 Rambutan is an oval fruit with crimson or yellow skin with short, fleshy hair. After removing the shell, you will find translucent and succulent flesh that is crisp and sweet. Mangosteen is also oval in shape with six or seven fleshy, translucent segments inside. These fruits are grown in the province of Surathani.

 While the fruits are currently being served at ITC Sonar Bangla, and can be sampled at C3, they will be readily available on the shelves in a month or so. 

 We have been negotiating with many companies and few have shown positive interest. The prices of the fruits will range between Rs 100 and Rs 150 per kg, explained Thongruang.

 Childs play

 Timbaktoo, the video game parlour in Forum, celebrated its second birthday on Sunday, with model-actress Piu Sarkar dropping by.

 The video game parlour on the fourth floor of the mall, spread over an area of 2,700 sq ft, upped shutters on July 6 2003, with a wide range of video games. The most popular games are Daytona USA 2, a car racing game, Motor Cross Go, for bike racing enthusiasts, shooting games Time Crisis 2 and Silent Scope, Stop-the-clock and Kiddie Rides.

 The selection of the games ensures young people enjoy them. And one can always spot adults as well as children having fun here, smiled Neha Tiwary of Timbaktoo.

 Pool party

 A raincloud hovered over Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) on Saturday night and no one was seen complaining. Seagrams Dare to Belong H2O Party was an evening of wet and wild fun, with showers making up for the lack of the real downpour.

 The swimming pool was one of the top draws at the rain dance, with kids creating a cosy corner for themselves on the shallow end, and the young and restless party people taking over the rest of it. 

 The music made sure that those who fled the pool only got as far as the makeshift dance floor. DJ Suraj played time-tested tracks like Bindaas, Mein saat samundar and Dekh le. Dus bahane and Baras ja were the new entrants on his play list.

 I will only play tracks which people have heard before and want to listen to and dance to. No experimenting, stressed the table turner.

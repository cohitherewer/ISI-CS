 Bribe nets tax officers 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a sting operation, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers arrested two income-tax (IT) officers on Friday on the high court premises while they were taking a bribe of Rs 300 from a businessman. Both the officers were caught red-handed by CBI sleuths.

 According to CBI sources, they received a complaint from a businessman, whose name cannot be disclosed, that an IT officer, identified as Gobindo Ghosh, was demanding money from him. 

 ?Ghosh told the businessman that he would get back Rs 5,967 as tax refund. The businessman wanted to know how he would get back the money,? said an officer, adding: ?Ghosh then told him that a cheque would be sent to his residence by post.?

 Ghosh called up the businessman and asked him to wait in an office on the high court premises. When they met, Ghosh asked him for Rs 500. The businessman said he would return a few days later.

 The businessman then went straight to the CBI?s Nizam Palace office and lodged a complaint with its anti-corruption wing. 

 ?We told him to accept the offer and play along with Ghosh. That was the only way of catching the man red-handed,? said an officer.

 The businessman bargained with Ghosh and scaled down the deal to Rs 300. 

 Ghosh told him to come on Friday to an office at Government Place (West), on the court premises. Thereafter, two CBI officers, pretending to be businessmen seeking advice from the IT officer, also went inside the room and sat quietly in one corner as Ghosh was handed over the money.

 After accepting three currency notes of Rs 100 denomination from the businessman Ghosh counted them twice. He then passed the money to his colleague, identified as Pallab Dhar, who was sitting next to him. Dhar, too, counted the notes and kept them in his shirt pocket.

 ?As soon as Dhar put away the money, we identified ourselves. We took out the money and wrapped it in cloth to keep their fingerprints intact. They were taken straight to our Nizam Palace office for interrogation,? said the officer.

 The CBI will search the residences and offices of the two to assess their assets.

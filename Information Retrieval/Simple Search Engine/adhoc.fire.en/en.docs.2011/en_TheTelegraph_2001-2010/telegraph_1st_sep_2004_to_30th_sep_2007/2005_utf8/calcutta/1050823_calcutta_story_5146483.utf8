 Karan Johar with Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee: Ready to roll

 After months of casting and scripting, Karan Johar is finally ready to roll out his next directorial venture, Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna, already being called KANK. Although Karan has produced Kal Ho Naa Ho and Kaal in between, KANK will be his first film as director since the big-budgeted blockbuster Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.

 ?I have had my stint on the small screen as of now, always being put on trial as the host and how good I am in making my guests comfortable,? Karan told Metro, referring to his popular STAR World show Koffee With Karan. ?Now, I am ready to start my film and it goes on the floors from September 1.?

 If the K3G cast was big, KANK goes bigger. The film, again exploring man-woman relationships, stars Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Preity Zinta, Arjun Rampal and Kirron Kher.

 Calling KANK his toughest challenge till date, Karan is ready to call the shots even as sets are being put up in Mumbai. After a short desi stint, the KANK team is off to New York for a marathon shooting spell. Initially, the producer-director had planned to shoot in London, then in Australia before deciding on the Big Apple.

 The film has already had its share of controversy even before the first take has been canned and it?s all in the name. The title Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna was registered with Aruna Irani who graciously relinquished it. But a certain Bishwaroop Chowdhury then claimed to have the rights to the title. 

 While Karan is adamant to keep his hard-fought title, the name game is far from over.

 Jeet and Koel: Hit pair 

 Celebrating the timeless music of Mohammed Rafi, Bengali film magazine Anandalok along with Sagarika Music held a special contest where readers were to pick 10 of his all-time best songs. Of the thousands of entries that poured in, nobody could get all 10 right but 26 lucky winners got close enough to win special prizes.

 Monday morning saw Tollywood stars Jeet and Koel, fresh from their latest hit Juddha, handing out the prizes to the winners at Crossword bookstore. 

 The Rafi Top 10 featured gems like Nafrat ki duniya (Haathi Mere Saathi), O duniya ke rakhwale (Baiju Bawra) and Yeh duniya yeh mehfil (Heer Ranjha).

 Residents of the Garden Reach area have moved a public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court, seeking directions regarding the prohibition of vehicle movement on Kidderpore Bridge no. 1, commonly known as Swing Bridge. 

 Petitioners? counsel Jaymalya Bagchi told the court on Friday that Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in May last year had closed the bridge to vehicles because of its poor condition. ?My clients are facing severe problems during office hours because of the closure of the bridge,? the lawyer said. The closure also causes massive traffic snarls in the adjoining areas. Bagchi sought an order asking the CPT to renovate the bridge at the earliest.

 he division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutt admitted the petition and asked the respondents ? Calcutta Municipal Corporation, South Eastern Railway and the state government ? to file affidavits stating their stand in this regard.

 ppearing for Singh, advocate Arunava Ghosh told the court that the people of the state had a ?very bitter experience? in the past few elections. ?Left Front cadre captured booths and rigged the elections,? he alleged. Ghosh sought an order asking the poll panel to withdraw the ban. 

 he division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutt admitted the case and asked the election commissioner to file an affidavit on the notification.

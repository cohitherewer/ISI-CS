 Trans-Atlantic connectivity to plug into and play with global vendors. Trendy tankards and cosy couches at the New York-on-Friday-nights-style Manhattan Lounge to attract not just the ?Morgan Stanley youngsters? from Sector V, but the cream of corporate Calcutta. Basketball and business club, multi-cuisine food courts and online grocery mart?

 Envisioned as the answer to the need for ?life? at work, Globsyn Crystals, the 350,000-sq-ft new-age twin towers set to come up in the heart of Salt Lake?s IT district, aims to redefine the modern workplace.

 A brainchild of Globsyn Technologies chairman and CEO Bikram Dasgupta of Infinity fame, Crystals aims to create an environment that ?bespeaks of efficiency and comfort, competence and fun?.

 Work on the two towers, Crystal 1 and Crystal 2, designed by Hong Kong-based architecture firm Z amp;Z Architectural Consultancy and to be executed by the Sureka Group, is expected to be completed by January 2007.

 The backbone of the twin towers, coming up on Globsyn?s Sector V campus, will, of course, be the tech area, offering 28,000 sq ft footplates of ITES and BPO spaces. 

 Apart from hi-tech office space, there are plans to add technology for a voice-based centre built in with both Asia-Pacific and Trans-Atlantic connectivity. A space for round-the-clock global video-conferencing will also be provided.

 ?Infinity was progressive in 1996. Crystals will answer today?s needs. With more and more companies adopting the BPO mode of services, there is a shift of focus in requirements for the modern upwardly mobile professional, more so in IT. While the right systems at work must be put in place, allied facilities at play are as important,? says Dasgupta.

 The Manhattan Lounge promises to be the ?ultimate chill-out zone? in Sector V, with groovy beats and choicest single malts, where the corporate crowd can unwind at the end of a hard day?s work or bring in clients to wind up a business deal.

 The on-campus 24x7 online superstore, grocerybazaar.com, will be designed to facilitate working professionals? schedules along with offline offers. 

 Branded, subsidised food courts, offering cuisine from across the country and a fancy mocktail bar, would further liven up the place.

 ?Crystals give us the opportunity to memorise, analyse and predict. They also remind us of the soul and clarity of thought. The design and architecture of Globsyn Crystals will represent the theme ?crystals?, enmeshing technology with soul, thereby creating life around it,? explains Dasgupta.

 The futuristic work-and-play property, besides banks and beauty salons, will also boast a high-end business club. 

 The first 25 memberships to this exclusive bastion would be by invitation only, with names like Shiv Nadar and Narayan Murthy in the starting line.

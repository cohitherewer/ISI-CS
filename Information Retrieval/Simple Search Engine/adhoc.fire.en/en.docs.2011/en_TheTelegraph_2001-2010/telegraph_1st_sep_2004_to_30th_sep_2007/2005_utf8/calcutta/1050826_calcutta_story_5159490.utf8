The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All-action girl

 Jennifer Garner as Elektra

 Marvel Comic fans got a tantalising glimpse of her in the 2003 film Daredevil, starring Ben Affleck. This Friday, Jennifer Garner hits the halls in Calcutta as the comic book action hero Elektra, body-hugging red costume in place. 

 Not long after recovering from seemingly mortal wounds, the lady in red has severed all ties with the world, living only for her next assignment. But in an unexpected turn of events, she is forced to make a decision that can steer her life in a new direction or destroy her. 

 Key players in Elektra?s journey are Stick, a blind martial arts master responsible for Elektra?s ?resurrection?, and Mark Miller and Abby Miller, a father and daughter on the run from The Hand, a powerful syndicate whose members practice the dark martial art of ninjitsu.

 The film-makers made the most of Elektra?s special qualities ? she possesses no super-human physical powers, but makes maximum use of her incredible physical prowess and martial arts skills (Garner practised for many hours). She also has the ability to see into the future, a skill known as Kimagure, which she has honed through countless hours of deep meditation.

 ?She?s fighting the inevitability of her own humanity,? says Garner. Elektra gave her the opportunity to explore a character she had created on screen earlier. ?At the end of Daredevil, we left Elektra at the beginning of her real darkness. When we pick her up in this movie, there?s a wall of ice around her. She?s so isolated from the outside world that she doesn?t even know she?s isolated anymore.?

 Elektra hits 89 Cinemas with three shows, INOX City Centre with two, INOX Forum with two, and New Empire with four shows.

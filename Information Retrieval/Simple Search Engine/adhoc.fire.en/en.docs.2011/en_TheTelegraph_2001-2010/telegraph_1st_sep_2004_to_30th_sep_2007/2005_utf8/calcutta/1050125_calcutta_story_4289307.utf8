 A training academy for the city?s oldest law-enforcing unit, Calcutta Mounted Police, will come up on the Maidan, off Manohar Das Tarag and opposite Grand Hotel. 

 Apart from regular training sessions, the academy will conduct show-jumping, obstacle-clearing, short sprints and command executions.

 Police will also take on the responsibility of cleaning up the stretch ? overrun by weeds and littered with garbage ? and preserving the trees. Insiders claim preliminary talks have elicited positive response from the army, which owns the Maidan.

 ?The stretch we have chosen has been lying unutilised for years. The academy will be a small step on our part towards preserving the city?s lungs. Besides, open training sessions at the centre will attract tourists,? explained police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 The police chief and other senior officers, including deputy commissioner (headquarters) Ranvir Kumar and inspector of Mounted Police Dipak Das, visited the spot on Saturday morning. 

 Earlier, the city police had joined hands with a steel giant to construct Elliot Park. As for the training centre, the authorities plan to landscape the grounds on the lines of the National Police Academy, Dehra Dun. 

 ?If required, we will also set up grass steps for the public to sit on and witness the show. The whole idea is to give a new, aesthetic look to the stretch,? commissioner Mukherjee said. 

 The Mounted Police started its journey in 1840 with only two sowars and a dafadar (officer). Their task was to carry messages to the harbour master and also to inform him whenever a ship was sighted.

 Two years later, the unit was asked to patrol the Maidan area. Since then, the greens have been under its vigilance. 

 With the recent purchase of 20 horses from Faridkot (at Rs 83,000 each), the unit now has 80 horses and two ponies. The horses are trained at the Bodyguard Lines in Alipore and the Race Course.

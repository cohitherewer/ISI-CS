The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Towards a free future

- Software guru shouts out against patents 

TechTalk

His ?pleasure card? reads ?sharing good books, good 

food and exotic music and dance, tender embraces, unusual sense of humour?. His 

message to the masses: ?... say free software, say mukto software?.

That?s Richard Stallman, an activist and St IGNUcius 

of the Church of Emacs by his own admission, and good old father of free software 

and a genius with flowing hair and beard for us geeks.

In the city as a guest of the state information technology 

department, Stallman preached the future of free software to a packed Paribesh 

Bhavan auditorium on Friday, enlightening and entertaining the audience in equal 

measure.

The man

For decades, Stallman has been a champion of free 

software, as opposed to proprietary software like, say, Microsoft Windows. He 

founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the free GNU (pronounced guh-noo) 

operating system and is an academic, computer scientist, political campaigner 

on freedom, patents and more.

He has won numerous awards, including honorary doctorates, 

a fellowship from MacArthur Foundation, known as the ?genius grant?, and the Rubinsky 

Award.

The message

Free software, according to Stallman, means software 

that respects the user?s freedom, allowing him to understand how it works and 

make changes and improvements.

?There are four kinds of freedom that proprietary 

software denies the user,? says Stallman. ?Freedom Zero allows you to run the 

program as you wish, freedom One allows you to help yourself by studying and changing 

the source code, freedom Two lets you be a good neighbour by distributing copies 

to others, and freedom Three allows you to help the community by publishing a 

modified version of the program.?

Proprietary software also spies on the user, reports 

back his actions, and displays advertisements. ?But in free software, we can?t 

get away with malicious features, because the user will throw it away.?

Why then do people still use proprietary software? 

?Two reasons,? answers Stallman. ?Inertia, like the one operating system they 

see all around. The other is companies like Microsoft do things to win the support 

of governments and schools so they can keep everyone else in line.?

Stallman is dead against gratis copies of Windows 

distributed to schools. ?It?s the same model tobacco companies follow by offering 

free cigarettes. They want to make the user dependent. They want the children 

to grow up addicts. The schools shouldn?t accept them and say this isn?t right.? 

It?s time to think long-term and not just the here 

and now, feels Stallman. ?Proprietary software means a society of subjugation. 

There would be economic consequences, too. Microsoft will first spread the software 

and later ensure that each and everyone pays. Then, India will hit a train-wreck. 

To prevent that, computer usage in India must be changed over to the free software 

track.?

Patenting is another issue Stallman feels strongly 

about. ?Prevent patents on software ideas. You need to combine thousands of ideas 

to create a program that has something new. How can you do that if each of them 

is patented??

Bengal bytes

?I am glad to know that the West Bengal government 

is taking steps to teach free software in schools, but teaching even a bit of 

Windows alongside must stop completely. You can?t give a lot of fresh fruits and 

a bit of tobacco to kids,? Stallman offers. ?Students have to read a lot of code 

to become good programmers. If they cannot study the source code of a program 

they cannot do that. Free software also teaches a child to share and be a good 

neighbour and a good member of the society.?

Fun factor

At the end of his almost hour-long talk, Stallman 

takes out a cloak and a ?halo? (which he later admitted may have been a computer 

disc in its previous existence), wears them, proclaiming himself St IGNUcius of 

the Church of Emacs, and blesses everyone?s computer. ?One of the advantages of 

being a saint of this church is that you don?t have to practise celibacy,? he 

concludes.

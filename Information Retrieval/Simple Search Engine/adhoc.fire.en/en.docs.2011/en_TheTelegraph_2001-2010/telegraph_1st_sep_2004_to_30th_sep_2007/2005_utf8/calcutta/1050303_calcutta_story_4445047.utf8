 What?s the outcome of disagreeing with an officer attached to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s police force? 

 A sound thrashing, as the Gambhirs of Jhowtala Road found out on Tuesday.

 Having refused to pay Rs 3,000 demanded by a doctor of Calcutta Police Hospital for a damaged tail-light, Akshay Gambhir, 25, was beaten up by a dozen policemen in broad daylight, on Gurusaday Dutt Road, near the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM). The cops roughed up his relatives, too. 

 When Gambhir tried to protest, the cops bundled him into a police van and took him to Ballygunge police station, threatening to frame him on charges of assaulting them.

 On the intervention of Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south), however, the police station was forced to record a complaint (GD No. 82, dated March 1, 2005).

 ?A departmental inquiry is on. If anyone is found guilty, appropriate legal action will be taken against him,? Sharma said on Wednesday.

 Playing down the incident, Amal K. Patra, officer-in-charge of Ballygunge police station, said: ?It?s not a serious matter. There was an altercation between the doctor and Gambhir.?

 Much after Gambhir lodged the complaint, the doctor concerned, Dibyendu Mahajan, lodged a counter-complaint, stating that it was Gambhir who had attacked him first. He said Gambhir?s injuries were caused by a fall he suffered when he ?got into a scuffle with policemen?.

 According to the complaint lodged by Gambhir, around 2 pm on Tuesday, Gambhir?s wife Keerat, 22, and his maternal aunt were driving down Gurusaday Dutt Road towards Syed Amir Ali Avenue in their Maruti Zen. 

 As the car crossed BITM, one of its side mirrors brushed the tail-light of a Wagon R, allegedly standing in a double-lane parking space. 

 The complaint stated that when the cars stopped at a red light, Mahajan came up to the women and lambasted them.

 Mahajan then called the police on his mobile. Keerat called her husband and father-in-law. 

 In his complaint, Gambhir said though he offered to pay Mahajan for the repairs, the police caught him by his turban and rained blows on him.

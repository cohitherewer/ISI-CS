 Killing on Howrah platform

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Unable to bear the swift ?rise? of his 18-year-old friend Raju, who would make a living by selling empty water bottles left behind by passengers on trains, a 21-year-old youth killed him by dropping a concrete mass on his head.

 The incident took place on platform 7 at Howrah station early on Friday, leaving the cops rattled and passengers terrified.

 ?It appears that the assailant had struck between 3.30 am and 4 am, when Raju was fast asleep,? said Sheikh Taj Mohammed, inspector-in-charge, Government Railway Police (Howrah). ?The youth had picked up a concrete chunk from the siding and dropped it on Raju?s head. We have identified the killer, but it would not be proper to divulge his name now.? 

 Raju and a group of others, between 18 and 24 years, slept at the northern end of platform 7 at night. Most make a living by collecting empty bottles and other items, including food packets, left behind by passengers of long-distance trains.

 ?Over the past few weeks, Raju and his assailant had often clashed over which platforms each would operate on. Raju reportedly refused to limit himself to a few long-distance trains and that had led to a quarrel,? an officer said. 

 Amid security concerns raised by passengers, cops claimed that they could not do much to tackle this ever-growing band of vagrants, who refuse to stay at vagrancy homes to make fast money. 

 ?Not just water bottles, they also pick up iron pieces from the yard and sell them off. We have tried to shoo them away, but in vain,? the officer claimed.

 Twelve-year-old Sujata Sardar, from the Sunderbans, has lost her mother and is abandoned by her father and stepmother.

 Five-year-old Rinki Bose, from Ranaghat, is an orphan.

 Nineteen-year-old Sandhya, whose parents are suffering from leprosy, has learnt Bharatanatyam in Varanasi. 

 The three of them and hundreds of others are now waiting to meet their ?mother?. That?s Therese Binsteiner, an 81-year-old from Bad Reichenhall, Germany, who has been relentless for the past 24 years in offering support to leprosy and TB patients, and orphans and destitutes in Calcutta and other parts of the country.

 A retired waitress, Binsteiner raises funds for her mission by running an inn at her house near the picturesque Black Forest. Apart from providing lodging facilities to tourists, the inn sells old clothes and vegetables, which she grows in her garden. 

 ?I learnt about the plight of leprosy patients in India from a newspaper article in Germany and decided to do something for them,? Binsteiner told Metro at Pranab Kanya Sangha, in Madhyamgram (North 24-Parganas).

 She provides funds for the Sangha?s orphanage for girls. ?Last year, the Union tribal affairs ministry had granted funds to support 50 girls. Nine months have passed, but the first instalment is yet to arrive,? Binsteiner rued. 

 ?It?s difficult to support these girls in the absence of a permanent grant,? added B.K. Banerjee, a Sangha official. 

 Binsteiner has written to Sonia Gandhi, requesting her intervention. ?I had met her husband Rajiv in 1981 when I first came to India on the leprosy mission. He was very nice and encouraged me in my work,? she recalled.

 Binsteiner has founded Madhyamgram-like institutions in Indara and Maharajgunj (UP), Junagadh, Bangalore, Jamshedpur and other places across the country. She also supports a tuberculosis unit in Barajuri, Ghatshila, and a home for children of leprosy patients in Varanasi. 

 At 81 and afflicted with several ailments, including tuberculosis, Binsteiner is in no mood to relent. ?I want to set up a rehabilitation centre for AIDS patients on a one-and-a-half acre plot in Bangalore,? she said.

 Binsteiner also writes in several journals and takes part in radio and TV talk shows to spread awareness about leprosy and tuberculosis.

 Among those who stand by her with their unstinted support are her 41-year-old son Rudolph, Berlin-based Pranab Banerjee and his wife Liselotte.

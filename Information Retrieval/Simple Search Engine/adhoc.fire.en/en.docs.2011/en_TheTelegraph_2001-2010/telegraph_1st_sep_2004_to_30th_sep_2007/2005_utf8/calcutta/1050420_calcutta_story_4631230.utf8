The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Bentinck Street remains dark cyclically. Some nights, the entire street is 

blazing with lights. Then again, semi-darkness. Some nights, only a single street 

light burns. That continues for almost a week. This can be quite scary late at 

night. It is quite risky to walk down because there are drunk men and women all 

along Prinsep Street, opposite Orient cinema, which is closed. Why do not the 

authorities concerned keep the lights in order? 

 Urmila Nayak, 

Khardah. 

 I noticed that the two supports of the footbridge at the base of the Dhakuria 

flyover, that had blocked the footpaths, have been relocated after my letter on 

the same was published in this column on March 28. I thank the authorities for 

taking prompt action. 

 Aloke Surana, 

Baguiati. 

 Half-an-hour of rain on April 10 evening flooded many roads and bylanes across 

the city. The stagnant rainwater was ankle-deep on some roads even till the next 

morning causing difficulties for students in going to school. Most roadside drains 

and underground sewerage lines are blocked in many places and overflow after even 

a light shower. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation should take steps within this 

month to prevent city streets from flooding after the occasional heavy showers 

during summer months. Working now will also help keep the problem at bay during 

monsoon. 

 B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum. 

 I regularly commute on the Bongaon section, under ER?s Sealdah division. In 

the already crowded compartments, some passengers often occupy more seating space 

to play cards. They also smoke and cause much inconvenience to non-smokers. Arguing 

with them on the issue is usually futile. The railway authorities should implement 

the smoking ban more strictly on local trains. 

 Debyani Basu, 

Saptagram. 

 With so much of construction activity going on along EM Bypass, especially 

near Science City, shouldn?t there be a footpath along the road? Residential estates 

and office buildings are coming up on the stretch. The civic body and the construction 

houses should take up the responsibility of constructing footpaths, at least along 

the portion of the road where the buildings are located. Footpaths will prevent 

pedestrians from walking on the road and reduce the risk of accidents. 

 Sumant Poddar, 

Kyd Street.

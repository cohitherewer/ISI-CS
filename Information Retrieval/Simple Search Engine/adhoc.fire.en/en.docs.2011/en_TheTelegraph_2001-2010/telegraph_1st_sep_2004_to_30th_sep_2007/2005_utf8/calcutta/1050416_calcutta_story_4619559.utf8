 A cruise to the sunny shores of the Bahamas or the cool climes of Alaska are not just popular choices for Western holidaymakers any more. As the Indian market matures and luxury getaways become increasingly popular, so the options increase. Calcuttans have been lapping up Alaskan cruises for the past couple of years. They?re diversifying to the Mediterranean, northern Europe, the Caribbean and of course, Southeast Asia. Now, there?s a short Indian offering.

 Star Cruises has launched its India option, with a four-night trip starting in Mumbai and stopping at Goa and Kadmat, on the Lakshadweep Islands. SuperStar Libra, currently in service in the US, will arrive in Mumbai in September and after a series of showcase events, will kick off its regular four-night cruise, as well as two-night trips to Goa and one-night weekend getaways from October 2. Plans include four special cruises to Kochi and Goa for December 25, as well as January and February 2006.

 ?We expect about 85 per cent bookings,? COO of Star Cruises Chong Chee-Tut said at the Calcutta launch of the cruise. He added that while more awareness of cruises was required in India, the market had grown over the past few years. ?For a relatively new market, short trips are better,? he explained. Sumit Banerji, sales and marketing manager, east, north India and Nepal, said Calcutta and the eastern region have caught on to the cruising trend. ?Our cruises are very popular here,? Banerji observed.

 Prashant Binnany, CEO of Discovery Travels and Tours, eastern India distributor of Princess Cruises, PNO, Cunard, Seabourne Princess, Ocean Village and Swan Hellenic, says cruises are favourites with Indians because of the convenience factor. ?Everything is under one roof. In that sense, it?s particularly popular with marriage parties. For Star Cruises? new product, we already have a few inquiries for marriages. PNO is going to launch a Singapore cruise specifically targeted at the Indian market, from February next year.?

 What the cruise offers is a hassle-free holiday with a bit of sightseeing and plenty of fun and frolic. Little wonder that some in the city are set to sail.

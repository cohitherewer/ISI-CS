 Kiddie corner at eateries

 First Innings, the restaurant at the Stadel, in Salt Lake, has had a children?s menu for some time. Fun names like Garfield?s Favourite (lasagne, of course), Jughead?s Ecstasy (burger and fries) and Ninja?s Pride (pizza) have been devised. The concept has huge potential, feels Stadel?s Anil Bhutoria.

 Parents may feel uncomfortable about taking young children to formal or smoky restaurants, but the city has few options.

 Pizza Hut is one of them, which has proved to be a hit with kids ? and not just because of its cheesy, carbohydrate-laden treats. The service mantra of the international chain is to ensure its tiny customers leave happy.

 Kids are handed balloons, drawing sheets, crayons and puzzles, are greeted specially and are thrilled by song-and-dance routines performed by the hosts. Add to that favourite foods like garlic bread, potato wedges and cheese pizzas, and the kids are all smiles. Feedback has been consistently positive from families with pre-teens, who dominate the crowd on weekends and make up around half the crowd on weekdays too.

 Kids? dining-out needs are also being catered to in a big way by food courts. Both Burp at Forum and Hangout at City Centre have play areas, and it is add-ons and not separate food choices that win youngsters? loyalty, says City Centre CEO Vineet Verma.

 ?Kids keep going back to McDonald?s not because of the burgers but for the toys they get with the Happy Meals,? he observes.

 To capture its audience ? 75 per cent of which is families with under-14 children ?special events like quizzes and fun activities where freebies are given out have been organised occasionally. 

 With eateries going for growth, they are banking on children to champion their culinary cause.

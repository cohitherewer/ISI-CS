 Tribute to a brother

 The stage adaptation of Munshi Premchands story, Bade Bhai Sahab, Nandikars production Borda introduces us to a solitary, elderly gentleman as he recounts his childhood memories. While giving an interview to a television channel, he remembers his elder brother (borda), who was his guardian, as well as his teacher. An idealist and a strict disciplinarian, his brother also had his oddities and idiosyncrasies. At the same time, the protagonist fondly recalls his brother?s upright morals, his deep regard for family values, traditions and bondings and his love, affection and care for his younger brother, that is, himself. Through happy or sad, but emotionally invigorating incidents, he reveals his borda?s selfless devotion and pursuit in imparting him the best possible education and upbringing. Full of humour, but touched with an implicit, gentle pathos, the story cleverly satirizes the importance of institutionalised education. It also brings alive the elder brother?s character in a manner that endears him to all and earns him our highest respect. Direction and acting: Goutam Halder.

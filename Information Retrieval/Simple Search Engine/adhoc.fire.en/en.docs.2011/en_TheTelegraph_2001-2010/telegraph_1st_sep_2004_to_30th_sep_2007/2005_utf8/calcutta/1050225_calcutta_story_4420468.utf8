The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Piracy cry in beam block

 - STAR, Sony blackout threat over default tag on MSO

 A STAFF REPORTER

 And the Oscar goes to?

 Around 2.5 lakh cable and satellite households in the city will remain clueless about the Academy Awards early on Monday, as another round of beam battle threatens to hold them to ransom. They are also likely to miss out on the final countdown to the Indian Idol.

 The STAR and Sony bouquet of channels are poised to go off ? on ?charges of piracy? ? from a large chunk of multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable?s Calcutta Communications network late on Friday. The blackout will hit areas like Ballygunge, Park Circus, Camac Street and Jodhpur Park.

 ?There are around 25 cable networks and a few five-star hotels that Calcutta Communications provides signals to, but does not pay for,? said a spokesperson for Indian Cable Net, the MSO that doubles as distributor for the STAR and Sony bouquets.

 The Academy Awards will be beamed on STAR Movies on February 28, while crucial episodes of the penultimate rounds of Sony?s Indian Idol will be shown through the week.

 ?Sony, STAR and Zee had jointly conducted a survey recently and found discrepancies of around 25,000 households with the list of connections provided by Calcutta Communications. They have also been rampantly connecting operators from other MSOs,? alleged a spokesperson for One Alliance, which handles the Sony bouquet, along with channels like Discovery, Animax and MTV.

 ?Also, despite several reminders, they have avoided entering into any formal business agreement with us. We have informed the consumers through a public notice as per the directives of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,? the spokesperson added.

 STAR and Sony have written to the defaulting MSO to immediately discontinue the ?pirated feed? and pay up the past dues or face switch-off.

 With SitiCable in no mood to recognise the claims, let alone accept the demands, the beam blackout looks certain on Friday night.

 ?If they had a problem with the figures we provided, they should have clarified it with us,? Soumen Roychowdhury, vice-president of the Zee group-owned SitiCable, told Metro on Thursday. 

 ?There were no documents provided with the letters and there is no question of paying up,? he added.

 This beam block comes even as the state government is struggling to complete a cable census to determine the number of cable and satellite households in Calcutta. The move to check under-declaration and end cable disputes has floundered, with hardly a handful of operators, accounting for just about a lakh cable connections, responding to the declaration draft.

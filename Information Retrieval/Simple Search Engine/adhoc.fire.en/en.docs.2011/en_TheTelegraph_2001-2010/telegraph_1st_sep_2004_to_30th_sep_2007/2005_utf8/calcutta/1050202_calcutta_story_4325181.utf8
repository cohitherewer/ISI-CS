 Expelled boy gets tour snub

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Trouble broke out at Augustine?s Public School in Howrah on Tuesday after the school authorities declined to take Bodhisatwa Chatterjee, rusticated on Monday for violating the school dress code, on an excursion to Millennium Park. 

 The tour was cancelled because several children and their guardians contested the school authorities? approach to the dress code and the punishment meted out to Bodhisatwa for not wearing the regulation sleeveless sweater.

 ?Unless Bodhisatwa is allowed to board the bus, we will not allow this excursion to proceed,? shouted angry residents of the locality.

 A large group of Chhatra Parishad activists blocked the road in front of the school for more than three hours on Tuesday to protest the expulsion. The activists appealed to the school authorities to take the boy back in his class.

 ?We will seek justice from the Howrah district magistrate,? shouted the leader of the group.

 ?A student who refuses to follow the dress code will not be allowed in the school any more,? asserted A.K. Augustines, secretary and disciplinary-in-charge of the school.

 She added that the school would wait for the disposal of the police case filed by the Chatterjees, seeking intervention in the dress code issue.

 Dilip Chatterjee, Bodhisatwa?s father, said that since he had already paid for the tour, the school authorities were bound to take his son on the Tuesday excursion. 

 He threatened to bring charges of extortion against the school authorities.

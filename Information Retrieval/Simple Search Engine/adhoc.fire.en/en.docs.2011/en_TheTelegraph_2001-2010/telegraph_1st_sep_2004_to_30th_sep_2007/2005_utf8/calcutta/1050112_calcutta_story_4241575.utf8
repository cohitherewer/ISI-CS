The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Airline big treat

 - Roomier 

planes, extra flight 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Singapore Airlines is in expansion and revamp mode. While travellers will soon get to enjoy the results, in the form of the world?s largest aircraft, Calcutta is in for an extra treat.

 The A380s are set to soar in 2006, by which time the city might have a fourth Singapore Airlines flight. ?We have not spoken to the government yet, but we are planning to launch one more weekly flight on the Singapore-Calcutta sector,? Bharat Mahadevan, regional manager, east, Singapore Airlines, said on Tuesday.

 There?s plenty of traffic to keep it going, despite the entry of Malaysia Airlines on January 29. In June 2003, Singapore Airlines added bigger aircraft to accommodate more passengers, and in April 2004, a third flight was added. 

 ?The average annual capacity from Calcutta has been about 70 per cent. So we are confident,? added Mahadevan. The biggest project for Singapore Airlines, however, is the A380s, with seating capacity of 555. ?But we will have less than 500, to create more space.? 

 Singapore Airlines frequent flyers? inputs were taken through a series of workshops, from Sydney to New York, with their ideas on a dream air travel experience. Staff and customers designed their ideal cabin. These ideas were then taken to designers, from luxury car-makers to hoteliers and aircraft-makers. 

 The result will be the customised A380s, 25 of which ? 10 on firm order and 15 on option ? cost the airlines $ 8.6 billion. ?The first and business classes will be different, economy seats will change and the in-flight entertainment will be completely revamped,? explained Mahadevan. Services will take off from March 2006. The A380s will replace the Boeing 747s, which will be phased out of service. 

 The added advantage for the customer ? lower ticket prices.

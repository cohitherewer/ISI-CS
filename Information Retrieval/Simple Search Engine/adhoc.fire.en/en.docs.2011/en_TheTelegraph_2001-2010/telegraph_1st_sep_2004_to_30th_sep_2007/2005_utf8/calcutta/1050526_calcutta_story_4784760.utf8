 Water woes ease in project deluge

 - 390 

 cr spent on infrastructure 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If the wars of the future are going to be fought over water, then Calcutta could well be an oasis of peace.

 The water supply department, for the first time in the post-Independence era, is passing a summer without deputation or agitation about scarcity of potable water.

 The city has not witnessed this year the traditional summer scene of long queues in front of roadside taps from early morning, clashes over collection of water from community taps and continuous use of hand tubewells till late into the night. 

 According to mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the reason is simple. ?Between 2002 and 2004, Calcutta Municipal Corporation completed the single biggest expansion of the city?s water infrastructure by pumping in Rs 390 crore from its own resources. The result is that Calcutta has become self-reliant for the next 25 years,? he said.

 Chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury said the department used to receive over 400 complaints every day regarding water scarcity during May- June. This year, the 21 centres of the department are receiving about 40 complaints a day, including those regarding choked ferrules, pipeline breach and turbidity, he added.

 Till last May, Roychaudhury pointed out, at least 40 per cent of the city households did not have access to filtered surface water and had to fetch bottles of it from other areas for cooking their meals.

 ?Almost 90 per cent of the city households are now getting supply of soft and treated piped water. The situation will improve further after the distribution networks are laid in some pockets of the city, where residents still use deep tubewells,? the chief engineer stated.

 ?I am getting compliments every day over telephone and through letters from households in Garfa, Behala, Bansdroni, Kasba, Bagmari and Ranikuthi,? he claimed.

 The residents of the areas are now getting treated surface water after pipes were laid connecting the localities with Tallah-Palta or the Garden Reach networks. The booster pumping stations, on the other hand, have increased the water pressure.

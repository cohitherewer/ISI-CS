 Tribal talk

 The latest to be inspired by Indian handloom and art is the new lifestyle boutique Vidishas at Salt Lake. Inaugurated by Tollywood actress Koneenica Banerjee on Wednesday, the store is home to ethnic crafts, embroidery items, glass paintings and wax modelling that are inspired by the interiors of Bengal.

 I have always had a fascination for our traditional culture and heritage and this enterprise is an effort to promote it. My emphasis is also on eco- friendly items, says Vidisha Poddar, owner of the BE block boutique.

 Candles in geometric shapes come in vibrant splashes. For those with an eye for floral designs, there are pretty candles adorned with roses, glitters and sequins. There is also an interesting range of lantern, roll, block and floating candles. 

 But the show stealer is the range of bigger candles in bamboo holders from Assam, engraved in tribal style.

 The assortment of table lamps are ethnic and innovative. Made of water hyacinth, handmade paper or cane, they make for perfect home decors. Ceiling shades in bright red borders and embellished with leafy motifs are definite eye catchers. 

 Shades with mirror work, checks, sequins and applique work are also on offer.

 Trendy jute bags come in hues of blue, yellow, red and green. The bags are aimed at teenagers and college goers. Hence, they are fashionable yet spacious, adds Vidisha.

 The cushion covers in sober shades come in fabrics like jute, tussar and satin. Ganesha figurines and horses that are made of moulded jute come in all sizes. Also on offer are dokra showpieces, handmade paper photo frames, telephone diaries, folders, mobile covers, table mats, magazine racks in cane and a host of other knick knacks. 

 Prices range from Rs 45 to Rs 4,000. 

 Rural art

 Inspirations, the exhibition being held at Aakriti in City Centre, provides a glimpse of the artistic talent that abounds in rural Bengal.

 The exhibition is an initiative to improve the economic status of rural artisans, says Shyamashree Sen, president of Nimble Fingers, organisers of the show that is on till August 21.

 The inauguration was attended by Piu Sarkar, Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya, Sanchita Bhattacharya and Shuvaprasanna.

 The interesting dokra, wood and paper artifacts are suitable pack-ins for home decor. The vibrant assortment of aprons and laundry bags are embellished with applique work. Glass paintings stand out colourfully at the counter and there are terracotta rakhis on display. 

 Interesting paper masks are definite eye-catchers. Also featued at the exhibition are mat curtains, buffalo horncraft, mittens, gel candles and a host of other bric-a-brac.

 At such exhibitions, the craftsmen come in contact with customers and gain a better insight into the likes and dislikes of the urban consumer. In the long run, it will help the artistes create decorative yet utilitarian articles, feels Sen.

 Those with a creative urge can attend the workshop on paper masks as part of the exhibition at Aakriti on August 20, from 4 pm. 

 Gem grabs

 An assortment of gems in myriad colours set in gold is on display at JewelCo in HHI. The jewellery house has brought out an interesting collection of pendants, chandelier earrings, circular bracelets, small trinkets and amulets.

 Pratap Lodha, owner of JewelCo, says: For Raksha Bandhan, we thought wed come out with a mixture of delicate and heavy jewellery sets that are ideal as gifts from a brother to a sister.

 The styles are both traditional and contemporary, with Victorian stylisation forming an intrinsic part of the collection. 

 Stones used include sapphire, ruby, garnet, diamond and even amethyst, with the choice of gold also given to the consumer. 

 Youngsters usually prefer white gold, while yellow gold is still the favourite with the older generation. Weve decided to keep several pieces using both finishes so that people can have their pick, says Lodha.

 All the jewellery sets are priced upwards of Rs 10,000.

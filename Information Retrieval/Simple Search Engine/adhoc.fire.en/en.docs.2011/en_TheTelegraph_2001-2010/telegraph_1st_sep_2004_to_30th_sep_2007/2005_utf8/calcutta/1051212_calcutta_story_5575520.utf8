 Syllabus shift for soft skills

 - Young IT experts lack work ethics, communication ability

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The robust and growing information technology (IT) sector in the state has exposed its soft underbelly ? professionals, especially newcomers, are frustratingly low on ?soft skills?. 

 Communication ability, time management and work ethics are some major areas most young IT experts from the state are found lacking in. Industry companies, in a fret, have approached institutes to reframe their syllabi.

 ?There is a rising demand for manpower in the sector and an increasing number of jobs are being created. But in terms of skills, some serious gaps are emerging,? said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary in the state IT department. ?There is a need for modifying the syllabi. Interactions between the academia and the industry are being held to find ways to bridge the gap.?

 The authorities at West Bengal University of Technology hinted at changing its curriculum. ?We keep getting complaints that students passing out of our university are low on soft skills,? said vice-chancellor Ashok Ranjan Thakur. ?We will reframe the syllabus and tune it to the needs of the industry.?

 The university, in collaboration with the British Council, has already introduced a ?pilot scheme? on communication skills. ?Some other organisations have also approached us and we are planning a one-on-one between the institutes and the organisations to make the programme effective,? Thakur added.

 A study by the Indian Chamber of Commerce points out: ?There is a lack of communication skills and presentable personality (among professionals) ? a prerequisite for employability. Courses on personality development, conversation, presentation skills, dress sense and etiquette will go a long way in enhancing employability of the pool and better performance of the same.?

 Bhaskar Das, of Cognizant Technology Solutions, feels that young professionals are also found wanting in interpersonal and teamwork skills. ?Their attitude and readiness to take up an organisational role are far from satisfactory.?

 Indu Kattar, of Wipro Spectramind, thinks ?it?s time we took note of the reality and train students in communication skills, time management and work ethics.?

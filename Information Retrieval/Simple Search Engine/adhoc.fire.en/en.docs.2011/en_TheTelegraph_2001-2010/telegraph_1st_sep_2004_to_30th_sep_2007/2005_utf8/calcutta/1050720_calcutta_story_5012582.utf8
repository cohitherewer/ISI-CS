Filmi Funda

Cactus Flower (1969)

Director Gene Saks

Cast Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman, Goldie 

Hawn

Plot Julian Winston (Matthau), an easy-going 

bachelor dentist, is stringing along his dizzy mistress, Toni (Hawn), by telling 

her he has a wife and children. When Toni tries to commit suicide, he promises 

to marry her. When Toni insists on meeting his wife, Winston convinces receptionist-nurse 

Stephanie (Bergman) to pose as his wife, leading to hilarious situations.

 The script was based on a French play by Pierre Barillet 

and Jean-Pierre Gredy, which was brought to Broadway in 1965 and ran to packed 

houses for three years before Hollywood picked up the catchy plot.

 Goldie Hawn won both the Oscar and the Golden Globe 

in the Best Supporting Actress category for her big-screen debut.

 A little known actress, Tuesday Weld, was first offered 

the role of Toni which finally went to Hawn.

 The original music for the film was composed by Quincy 

Jones and included the song A time for love is anytime, written by Cynthia 

Weil and sung by the ?Queen of R amp;B?, Sarah Vaughan.

 Cactus Flower also included the classic Neil 

Diamond number I?m a believer.

Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya (2005)

Director David Dhawan

Cast Salman Khan, Sushmita Sen, Katrina Kaif

Plot A remake of the Gene Saks film, here Dr 

Sameer (Salman) is an orthopedic who lies to lady love Sonia (Katrina) about being 

married to nurse Naina (Sushmita).

 This is the first film to feature the three Khan 

brothers ? Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail ? together. While Salman and Sohail have 

full-fledged roles, Arbaaz just has a cameo at the end. 

 The actress who plays Salman?s mother, Beena Kak, 

is, in fact, the former tourism minister of Rajasthan who even had a tete-a-tete 

with Bill Clinton when the former US President came to India.

 Like his previous scores, Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya, 

Hello Brother and Tere Naam, music director Himesh Reshammiya has 

a chunari song in the film ? Ishq chunariya...

 Sohail came up with the title of the film from his 

baby boy Nirvan, who keeps shouting ?Kyun? Kyun??

 The earlier Salman-David Dhawan film Mujhse Shaadi 

Karoge also had Sameer as Salman?s screen name and featured Vikram Phadnis 

as the costume designer.

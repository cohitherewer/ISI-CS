 Finding fitness, body and soul

 In the early 90s, when cable TV was in its nascent stages, MTV was music to the ears of a country that had grown up on a meagre diet of Chitrahaar and Binaca Geet Mala. Suddenly, there was Michael Jackson and Madonna being beamed into homes round the clock. And, in between videos, chatterboxes would sneak in a line or four.

 Ruby K. Bhatia was one of those first few star video jockeys. The leggy lass hosted the first countdown show, BPL Oye, on the Indian small screen, which climbed to the number one slot.

 Ruby may be less visible nowadays, but you can spot her as the hostess of the STAR Plus show Body and Soul which deals with health-related issues.

 I am really enjoying being on the show. After 12 to 13 years of work, I wanted to take a sabbatical and go travelling when this show came my way. Now, it is like killing two birds with one stone, says the ex-VJ on her short trip to the city on Saturday for a tsunami fundraiser. 

 The subject of the show is close to her heart. It is essential to keep ones mind and body fit. What sort of individual you are depends on how you feel mentally and physically, adds Ruby.

 Ruby has tried more or less everything with varying degrees of success. Though she found her fame as a video jockey, she has also dabbled in modelling for music videos, anchoring and acting. But now, one sees little of her on the small screen. 

 I have worked enough for others. Now I think it is time for me to work for my body and soul. It is time I discover myself. I am totally into a fitness regime now, she reveals. 

 Another factor keeping her away from the camera is the dearth of challenging material. I would not fit into the serials (read: the saasbahu soaps) that are being aired nowadays. One has to be considerably dumb to act in them, she smiles.

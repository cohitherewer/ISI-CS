 UGC centre at Shibpur

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An autonomous institute under the University Grants Commission (UGC) plans to build a state-of-the-art research facility at Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) at Shibpur.

 The research centre of the UGC Department of Atomic Energy Consortium for Scientific Research (UDCSR) has been located on Jadavpur University?s (JU) Salt Lake campus for the past 10 years.

 ?We are indebted to JU for its support. However, because of a space crunch, we have no scope to expand our facility on the campus. Besides, we want to have a building of our own, so we approached the BESU authorities for an acre on its premises,? explained A.K. Sinha, UDCSR?s centre director.

 ?Our board of management has decided in principle to provide land to UDCSR on our campus,? said N.R. Banerjea, vice-chancellor, BESU.

 ?We plan to allot a plot alongside the newly-constructed science and technology building,? he added.

 ?The atomic technique is used in cross-disciplinary research in subjects like biology, chemistry and environmental sciences. Researchers in these fields will benefit immensely from our proposed centre,? Sinha explained.

 On the other hand, BESU intends to take advantage of the opportunity and optimally utilise the proposed research facility. 

 ?We don?t want the UDCSR to go to some other state due to non-availability of land in West Bengal and miss out on this opportunity,? BESU vice-chancellor Banerjea pointed out.

 ?Moreover, our researchers and students will benefit immensely if such a multi-disciplinary research centre is available so close at hand.?

 Centre director of UDCSR Sinha said a 30,000-sq-ft laboratory complex, training centres and residential facilities are being envisaged as part of the new set-up for visiting scientists and researchers. 

 ?The initial investment might be around Rs 3 crore. We may, however, require more funds,? he said. 

 ?There are not many such research facilities available in the state. Hence, our centre will be a boon to the students,? Sinha signed off.

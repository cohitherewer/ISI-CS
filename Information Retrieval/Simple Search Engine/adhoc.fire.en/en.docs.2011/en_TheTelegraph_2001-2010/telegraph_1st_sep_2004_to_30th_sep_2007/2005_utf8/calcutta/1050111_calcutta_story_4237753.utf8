 Subhas signals fare hike

 - BUS UNIONS WANT MINIMUM TICKET AT Rs 4.50

 A STAFF REPORTER

 We did not want to hike the fares. I had anticipated 

that with oil prices falling in the global market, the Centre would slash prices 

by about Rs 4.50 per litre. Since that has not happened, we have to take some 

steps Subhas Chakraborty,

state transport minister

The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is set to increase the fares of buses and minibuses very soon. 

 Indicating this on Monday afternoon, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said a revision of fares was justified, since the Centre had not rolled back oil prices, despite prices falling globally.

 ?We did not want to hike the fares. I had anticipated that with oil prices falling in the global market, the Centre would slash prices by about Rs 4.50 per litre. Since that has not happened, we have to take some steps,? Chakraborty said at Writers? Buildings. 

 The new fare structure will be announced by January 15, the minister added.

 The transport department has come up with a proposal for the new fare structure, following a meeting of the representatives of two major bus unions with the minister on December 31. The proposal is being discussed at the party-level.

 It was learnt that the minimum fare is likely to be Rs 4. Transport lobbies have demanded a minimum fare of Rs 4.50.

 In the last fare revision in June, the state government had not increased the minimum fares of buses and minibuses, despite pressure from the transport lobbies. Fares for the other stages had gone up by 50 p.

 This time, the unions are keen to see a hike in the minimum fares. Department officials said that though the minister was not keen on hiking the minimum fares, he had to relent.

 ?The diesel price has gone up by Rs 3.69 since the last fare revision. We told the minister that we wanted an increase in fares at all stages,? said Sadhan Das of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.

 Swarnakamal Saha, president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, said: ?We are expecting a minimum fare of Rs 4. If we don?t get that, we will launch a state-wide agitation.?

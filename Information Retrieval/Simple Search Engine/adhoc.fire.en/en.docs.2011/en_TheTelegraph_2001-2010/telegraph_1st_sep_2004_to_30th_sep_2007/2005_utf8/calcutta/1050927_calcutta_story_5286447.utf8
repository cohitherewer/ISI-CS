The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Colours of a kaleidoscope

 Lady Brabourne College, in association with The Telegraph, organised its annual fest Kaleidoscope 2005 on September 22, 23 and 24. St Xavier?s College bagged top honours in The Telegraph Debate, with the second and third places going to Presidency College and the host college, respectively. A fashion show, choreography , eastern music and western music were the other hit events.

 Parash Pathar put up a guest performance on the second day of the fest. All the whacky and fun events like Medley and Vertical Limit were lined up on the third and final day. The vivacious and versatile compere Arvind kept the audience glued to their seats with his wit and sense of humour. The extravaganza ended with some pulsating remixes by DJ Craig.

Rooting for raga

 Spicmacay, the voluntary youth organisation committed to conserving and promoting Indian cultural heritage, has begun its activities once again with gusto. Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia performed on September 13 at IIM Calcutta, as part of Virasat 2005.

 Panditji expressed his joy at returning to the campus after an eight-year hiatus. However, an invitation to the house to request a raga failed to elicit any response.

 Pandit Chaurasia performed raga Yaman in madhya-laya jhap taal and in drut teen taal. He explained that raga Yaman, an ode to the moon, was apt for the occasion with the silver orb in the sky. Accompanied by Vijay Ghate on the tabla and Sunil Avchat on the flute, he then played raga Marwa in madhyam-laya teen taal.

 Many of the students were forthcoming when Chaurasia asked them to try and win prizes by identifying the tunes he played.

More to math

 Today?s children demand a visual or an illustration on everything that they are taught, from literature to history, physics to economics. But math is abstract. Hence, the difficulty for teachers to explain the nitty-gritty of the subject. And then, there is the rush to complete the syllabus.

 The two factors sow fear in the child?s mind ? one that grows with time, translates into failure and, finally, settles forever as hatred.

 Keeping this in mind, on September 13, Prism Educational Source Centre had organised Chethana ? a mathematics workshop at St Lawrence High School, Ballygunge. Professor Savikri Rao, from Bangalore, discussed various games through which math can be made more interesting. Classroom Math Games (CMG) is not a new concept. It was in use even in gurukuls in ancient and medieval India.

 The subject also encompasses psychomotor skills, like drawing, colouring, model-making and geometrical constructions. However, even in renowned schools in India, the psychomotor skills are not taken proper care of in the hurry to finish the syllabus, said Rao.

 The seminar was repeated in Mahadevi Birla school on September 15.

 New look, old charm

 If you happen to walk into Presidency College anytime soon, you may get the feeling that they are bringing down the entire campus. With the sound of hammers and drills all around and sights of men perched upon bamboo structures knocking the plaster off the building walls, you may even stretch your imagination a little further and assume that it is, probably, a group of disgruntled students protesting one thing or another.

 Fear not, for the entire exercise is aimed not at demolishing the structure, but renovating it. The hammers, though, are loud enough to put a high-watt bass-guitar at the college fest to shame! The professors are certainly getting good vocal exercise having to shout out lectures.

 Jokes apart, the college is getting a really good makeover in its preparation for the upcoming NAAC inspection.

 The main-building, already painted, and with lights lining the front staircase, looks quite a sight. And, incredibly enough, there are no trademark graffiti on the walls!

 Former students of the English department would have preferred to hold onto the large room no. 22 (the main room for the English department classes), but it has been truncated to make space for a computer room.

 Nevertheless, the warm ambience is not even slightly amiss. And when you spot an excited session of adda at one of the rickety tables inside Promodda?s canteen, you know that there are some things that just won?t change.

 Plans afoot to privatise park

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has sought permission from police for appointing a private firm to maintain Citizens? Park, commissioned by former mayor Subrata Mukherjee and opened days before the civic polls.

 ?The park is a white elephant? We?re saddled with a liability, which is not at all aesthetically pleasing,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. ?Maintaining it at our cost will push back development activities by around Rs 60 lakh a year. We have decided to invite private parties to run the show.?

 What had provoked the mayor?s pitch for private participation in the Rs 9-crore park, next to the Victoria Memorial Hall, was a file sent to him by mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan. The member proposed that Rs 70 lakh be kept aside every year for the park?s upkeep.

 The proposal for private participation, however, cannot be implemented unless police gives its nod. ?The area was handed over to the CMC by police for setting up a park. Without the cops? consent, we cannot engage any private party,? explained civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 He has directed director-general (civil) Udayshankar Sengupta to submit a status report, listing the possible avenues to earn the park?s upkeep. ?We would like to make it self-sustaining. Before pushing for privatisation, the mayor wants to make sure that the space is capable of earning its keep, around Rs 70 lakh a year,? Bandyopadhyay added. 

 A section of civic engineers, however, is against the proposal, arguing that allowing a private firm to mint money in a park set up with tax-payers? money will lead to severe public criticism.

 ?We hope the present board will not make the mistake committed by the CMDA in the case of Millennium Park,? said an engineer. He pointed out that if at least 5,000 people visit the park daily for eight months a year, the authorities can earn Rs 60 lakh annually. ?Again, a thousand joggers mean an additional annual revenue of Rs 12 lakh,? he added.

 The civic authorities have decided that the private partner will get its share of the ?gate money? ? tentatively fixed at Rs 5 a person and Rs 100 (monthly) for each jogger ? and can also run a food court on the premises.

 Also opposing the proposal is the leader of the Opposition in the CMC Javed Ahmed Khan. ?If a mayor feels nervous maintaining a park, how can the people expect a better city from him? Our mayor is penny-wise, pound-foolish. He is talking about a financial burden of Rs 70 lakh a year, but he has already imposed a permanent liability of Rs 10 crore a month, as power bill, on the CMC,? Khan added.

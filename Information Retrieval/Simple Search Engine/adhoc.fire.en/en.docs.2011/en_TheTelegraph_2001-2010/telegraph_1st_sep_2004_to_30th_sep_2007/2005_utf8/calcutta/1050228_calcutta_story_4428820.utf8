The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From innocence to experience

 The journey from childhood to adulthood is an endless procession of events, episodes and experiences, upon which are founded our values, beliefs and philosophy of life. Day In, Day Out, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Manoj Roy, traces the complex journey of the mind as travelled by the artist through infancy, adolescence, youth and maturity. Reflections of early childhood are characterized by beauty and simplicity, represented through rustic scenes full of bright, fragrant flora. Paintings depicting early youth are marked by curiosity, a questioning attitude and a state of mind that constantly challenges lifes paradoxes and contradictions. The clash of ideals is far more pronounced in works that are built around the theme of adulthood. As the artist progresses from innocence and naivete to knowledge and wisdom, his inner world, ironically, goes from light to darkness. Yet, Roys works clearly express optimism, a desire for peace within the self through spirituality and oneness with the environment.

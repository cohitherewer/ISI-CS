 Citu largesse for illegal autos 

 Traffic-stopper: Autorickshaws at Tollygunge crossing.

Bimal Bhattacharya: The main roads in Tollygunge are choked by autorickshaws. In several pockets, peak-hour traffic comes to a halt because of them.

 I know of the problems caused by the three-wheelers, many of which don?t even have valid licence. Since some of the major thoroughfares are within my Assembly constituency, I had repeatedly spoken to the officers-in-charge of various police stations. I had informed the chief secretary about the matter, and even the chief minister.

 But as you know, these illegal autorickshaw drivers are directly supported by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and the Citu-led unions. I feel that even the chief minister?s intervention couldn?t improve the situation. Matters have reached this stage because of a few leaders of the Left Front, who have crippled the administration and are preventing any action against law violators.

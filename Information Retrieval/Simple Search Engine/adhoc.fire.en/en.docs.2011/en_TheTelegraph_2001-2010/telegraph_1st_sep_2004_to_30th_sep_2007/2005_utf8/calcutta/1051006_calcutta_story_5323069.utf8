 Three-and-a-half years old, Rimi Sardar does not know much about her affliction, except that it does not allow her to play like other children. Confined to the house all year long, festivals pass her by. Not so, this Puja. 

 On Chathurthi, she will travel with her parents from their residence in Champahati to a puja in Calcutta, where, she has been promised, the ?uncles? will shower her with chocolates, balloons and lots of love.

 The daughter of an ambulance driver is one of the few thalassaemic children in the state who have been infected with HIV during blood transfusion. She is part of a long list of guests invited by Barisha Shakti Sangha to inaugurate their puja this year. 

 ?We are not into any gimmick. We had stumbled across Rimi?s case and decided to probe deeper. Once it emerged that she hailed from a humble background, we decided to do something for her,? said Tarun Mukherjee, secretary of Barisha Shakti Sangha. 

 The resolve was given shape by other members the club. They decided to part with Rs 25,000 from their puja budget for the treatment of Sankha Nath Sardar?s ailing daughter.

 Besides, 10 members of the club have decided donate Rs 100 each every month to the family for Rimi?s treatment.

 ?I have no words to thank them. On June 20, when experts at the School of Tropical Medicine confirmed what a doctor at NRS Medical College had suspected, I was completely shattered. I had got every single bottle of blood for her from the Central Blood Bank, and still, she got infected,? lamented Sardar.

 He continued: ?I was struggling to meet the cost of her thalassaemia treatment when she got AIDS. That was the final straw and I almost gave up. The offer of help from Barisha Shakti Sangha has re-ignited hope in my mind.? 

 Once Rimi was infected, Sardar shifted base from Basanti to Champahati to ensure proper supply of anti-retroviral drug for the girl. He started driving the ambulance of a local club to feed his family. 

 ?There is a desperation on her part to grow up like her elder brother Raju. I can feel it. Every day, she tells me that she wants to join her brother?s school in Champahati. I just listen,? said a sobbing Kanak, Rimi?s mother.

 The members of Barisha Shakti Sangha are not willing to stop at a Puja gift alone for Rimi. They have lined up a string of shows at Sarat Sadan in January to collect funds for her treatment.

 ?Besides, we would also appeal to those present during the inauguration ceremony of our puja, including artists Prakash Karmakar and Bijon Chaudhury, to chip in and do something to help the Sardar family,? signed off Mukherjee.

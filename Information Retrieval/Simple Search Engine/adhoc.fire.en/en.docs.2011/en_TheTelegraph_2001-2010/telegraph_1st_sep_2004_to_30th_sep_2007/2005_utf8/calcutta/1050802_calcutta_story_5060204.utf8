The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Newsy moments

 Telling stories worth a thousand words, pictures are powerful vehicles that convey, most effectively, the unfolding drama of events and incidents that makes it to the headlines of newspapers every day. Bringing these images to millions of readers is the challenge of the photographer, who has to capture the essence of a message in a single moment and within the limits of a compact frame, often by risking his own life. Visually narrating information from the field of action, photographers undertake perhaps the toughest responsibilities by way of delivering news to us. Freeze Frame, the ongoing exhibition of photographs by lensmen of leading newspapers and magazines, is an attempt to grant recognition to these photo-journalists for their exceptional efforts. Showcasing old as well as recent pictures that have eternally captured many significant events and milestones of our history, the show features works by photographers of The Telegraph, The Statesman, Hindustan Times, The Times of India, The Asian Age, Bartaman, Aajkal and Outlook, to name a few.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by photo-journalists

 When: Till August 13, 11 am - 8 pm (except Sunday)

 Where: Gallery Kanishka?s, 2/1 Hindustan Road, Calcutta 29

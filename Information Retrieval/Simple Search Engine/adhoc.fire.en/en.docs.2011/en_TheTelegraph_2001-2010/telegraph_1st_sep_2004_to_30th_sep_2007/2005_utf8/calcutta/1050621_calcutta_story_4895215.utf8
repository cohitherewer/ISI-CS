The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Best of both worlds

 Pankaj Kapoor and Shreya Sharma in Vishal Bharadwaj?s Blue Umbrella

 He gave Macbeth a new meaning in Maqbool. And after all the blood and gore, Vishal Bharadwaj has gone back to doing what he loves most ? making films for children. Having made the critically acclaimed Shabana Azmi-starrer Makdee that travelled to every children?s film festival around the globe, Vishal has almost wrapped up the celluloid adaptation of Ruskin Bond?s Blue Umbrella.

 ?I was dabbling in several projects after Maqbool,? Vishal tells Metro. ?I was in talks with Shekhar Kapoor about a project, which didn?t happen then but work is still in progress. At that juncture, I met UTV?s Ronnie Screwvala and we discussed several stories and then zeroed in on Blue Umbrella. Ruskin Bond is one of the greatest writers of the country. I am really happy that we have been able to film one of his stories. That kind of film wouldn?t have been possible without the support of UTV.?

 Blue Umbrella, which stars Pankaj Kapoor (who got a fresh lease of acting life as the don Abbaji in Maqbool) and child actor Shreya Sharma, is about a 10-year-old girl Biniya who discovers a beautiful blue umbrella which goes missing in her idyllic mountain village in north India, leading to a series of interesting events.

 Once Blue Umbrella is unfolded to audiences across the world, Vishal will start working on another UTV production, Mr Mehta and Mrs Singh, which should easily be his first commercial foray into film-making. ?It?s a love affair of a lifetime,? says Vishal. ?More of a mature love story which spans 30 years and looks at the institution of marriage.?

 And Vishal has got none other than Aamir Khan to say yes to the role of the business tycoon Mr Sharma in the film. ?After watching Maqbool, Aamir called me over for dinner where we discussed ideas and wanted to work together. It will be very challenging to show him from the age of 25 to 55 in the film.?

 The film, expected to roll in August 2006 and to be completed in just two months, hasn?t yet got a heroine opposite Aamir. ?There are a couple of other characters but it?s mainly about these two people ? Mr Sharma and Mrs Singh. We are meeting a lot of actresses and should finalise the leading lady soon.?

 After Blue Umbrella, Vishal was supposed to start another film altogether, Timbaktu, starring Aishwarya Rai and Vivek Oberoi, based on a novel Pas de Quatre, written by Australian author I.A.R. Wylie. 

 But the film has been kept on the backburner as of now with Vishal plunging neckdeep into devising different looks for Mr Mehta and Mrs Singh over the 30-year period in the film.

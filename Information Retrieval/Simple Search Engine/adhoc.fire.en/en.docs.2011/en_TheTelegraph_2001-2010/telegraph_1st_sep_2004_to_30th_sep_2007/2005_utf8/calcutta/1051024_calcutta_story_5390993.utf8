The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Birds amp; beasts in distress

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The bitch was drowning in a drain near SSKM Hospital, while her puppies barked like mad to attract attention.

 This alerted some passersby, who called up People For Animals, a welfare organisation assigned to take care of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s (CMC) dog pound. Doctors and volunteers of the organisation rescued the dog.

 After an on-the-spot treatment, the bitch and her litter were released. Similar accidents ? like a dog being trapped in the College Street area and a bull injured in Salt Lake ? were reported from across the flooded city.

 It is not only the people of Calcutta but also the stray dogs, cats and birds, which are at the receiving end of the incessant rain. Calls poured in at the office of People For Animals, from various localities, asking for help for stranded and distressed animals.

 ?We are working round the clock for the rescue and treatment of the animals that are either marooned or injured. Owing to the heavy rain and waterlogging, stray dogs, cats and even birds are suffering,? said Debashish Chakraborty, managing trustee, People For Animals. 

 ?Food is scarce and many of them are injured as they fall into drains and manholes. People are alerting us about birds that have fallen from their nest,? he added.

 The eight vehicles and 40-odd personnel of the NGO are pressed into action to help the animals in pain. 

 They are taken to the CMC dog pound and Ashari animal shelter for treatment.

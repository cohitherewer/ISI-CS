 A night of song and dance

 What rhythm rules when the Disco Dancer comes to town (and no, we arent talking of Mithunda here)? Disco, of course. Thats precisely what happened at Big Ben on Saturday night, when Bappi Lahiri made his presence seen, heard and felt.

 In town for the Channel [V] Karaoke Nite on Saturday, Bappida was accompanied by VJ Sarah Jane, VJ Archana and Channel [V] Super Singer Ravindra Upadhyay.

 The Kenilworth pub was packed (the biggest crowd it has seen in recent months) and everybody was waiting for the tune-and-trinket man. Bappida finally arrived around 11.30, all smiles and full of enthu.

 And he played to the galleries ? or rather the dance floor and the barstools ? in style, belting out his hottest hits like Yaar bina chain kahaan re, Raat baki, Bombay se aaya mera dost?

 Retro rage

 B.E.D (Bars, Entertainment and Dining), too, was gripped by disco fever on Saturday night. The retro rage was evident in both the ensembles of the party people and the beats from the console. 

 Long hair, baggy shirts with vibrant floral prints tucked into bell-bottoms and high heels, the crowd looked hip and happening.

 The music was a lot of Michael Jackson and Madonna punctuated with our very own Bappida. Dont Stop Till You Get Enough, D.I.S.C., I am a disco dancer and Disco deewane were just some of the tracks spun by DJ Lloyd.

 This night is our tribute to the scintillating 70s and 80s when disco came to India and was a huge hit. Even today, if the tracks are thrown in at the right party at the right time, they score over ruling party tracks. Also, party people from the previous generation identify with this genre of music, says Lloyd.

 Mumbai music

 Underground, the new night spot at Hotel Hindusthan International, played host to DJ Kiran from Mumbai on Saturday night.

 The DJ, whose re-mixed version of Tere liye from Veer Zaara is currently topping the charts, entertained the full house with latest party tracks like Dus bahane, Kangna, Dhol vajda and, of course, his own hit number.

 The advantage of playing in Calcutta is that you can start off late when the crowd starts building and continue till early morning. This is not possible in other metros where the clubs close even before the party begins, said Kiran.

 On Saturday, the party began as early as 11 pm at the discotheque modelled on the London Underground, when the DJ took control of the console.

 Trio treat

 As winter sets in with a nip in the evening air, theres one place in town where the men are feeling hot under the collar. Tantra, you see, is playing host to three Hooter girls.

 Stefanie, Kataryn and Rachael, all from the US, are setting the bartop ablaze at the night haunt at The Park till December 10.

 During the early part of the night, the trio will do a little bit of everything from bar tending to playing hosts, but the real action starts post-midnight. The girls will entertain the guests with their freestyle dancing. And they will do something new every week, said a spokesperson.

 On Saturday night, the trio gave its first performance to a packed house.

 Do-good do

 The All India Anglo-Indian Association, in collaboration with The Telegraph, HSBC and Dalhousie Institute (DI), played host to a fund-raising musical extravaganza on Saturday night.

 Education and helping elderly people have always been the major concerns. The proceeds from this event will be employed to aid senior citizens, said Barry Brien.

 The association is involved with old-age homes like the St Josephs Home, St Vincent Home and Tollygunge Home.

 As band Shiva belted out foot-tapping numbers like Every Breath You Take, the crowd had a blast on the dance floor. But the elderly couples were the real treat to watch. 

 Then it was Rila Briens turn to steal the spotlight, with peppy numbers and some Sacrifice, too. Singers Shayne Hyrapiet and Francis Lepcha later entertained the crowd with popular English tracks. To add to the fun, prizes were given to the the best dancing couple and the best jiving couple.

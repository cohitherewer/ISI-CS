The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clash on the street cuts off traffic

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Supporters of CPM and Forward Bloc clashed in Bhowanipore on Thursday morning, causing bumper-to-bumper snarls on arterial roads.

 At least 200 supporters of the parties fought a pitched battle for a couple of hours from 8 am. 

 Police had to resort to lathicharge to separate the warring groups.

 Traffic was thrown out of gear on SP Mukherjee Road, Asutosh Mukherjee Road and AJC Bose Road. Vehicles headed south and west were stuck at the JL Nehru Road-AJC Bose Road intersection.

 According to police, the clash was the fallout of a rivalry between two leaders.

 ?The groups had clashed late on Tuesday. We lodged a case of rioting against the leaders. But they turned violent again this morning,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 One person has been arrested in connection with the latest round of violence.

 ?The trouble between the groups started after Khokon Jana left the Forward Bloc and joined the CPM. He was at loggerheads with local Bloc leader Subhasish Dutta,? said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.

 ?The enmity was at a personal level. It was given a political colour on Thursday,? he added.

 The followers of the leaders first attacked each other with sticks, iron rods and bricks on Ramesh Mitra Road on Thursday morning. 

 They pelted stones indiscriminately, endangering vehicles and passers-by.

 Another officer of the police station said: ?As soon as we heard of the incident, we sent a team to the spot. But the cops could do nothing as they were heavily outnumbered. They informed the police station, and we in turn, sought help from Lalbazar.?

 The situation was brought under control by a large contingent of cops from Lalbazar. ?The supporters dispersed only after a lathicharge,? stated the officer.

 A case of rioting was started against the two leaders after the clash on Tuesday night.

 ?As today?s incident is a continuation of the earlier violence, the same charges will be applicable to the supporters,? he said.

 Police had no information regarding the number of supporters injured in the clash.

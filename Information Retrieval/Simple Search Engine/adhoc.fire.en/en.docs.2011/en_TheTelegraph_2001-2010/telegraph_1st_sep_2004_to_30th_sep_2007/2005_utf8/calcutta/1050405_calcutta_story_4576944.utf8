 It's Your Birthday So...

 With 

your effortless charm, you?re quite a crowd-puller. You have many friends and 

they like you for your generous and helpful nature. You?ll make a good salesperson. 

You are never demanding and always adaptable. Keep in touch with your inner self. 

You are apprehensive about forming close emotional ties because you fear the responsibilities 

they entail. ? Kusum Bhandari

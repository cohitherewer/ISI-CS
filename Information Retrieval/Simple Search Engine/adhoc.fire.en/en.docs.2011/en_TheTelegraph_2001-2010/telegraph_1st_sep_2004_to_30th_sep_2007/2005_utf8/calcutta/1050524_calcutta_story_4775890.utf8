 The authorities at Indian Museum and National Library are finding it difficult to run the organisations to the optimum level, thanks to certain curbs imposed by the Centre on recruitment of staff at these two premier city institutes.

 Both institutions are faced with an acute shortage of staff, and both are impeded by the Centre?s recruitment policy in rectifying the situation. The vacancy chart reads: 75 at the museum (sanctioned strength 260) and 265 at the library (strength 781). 

 Due to the shortage of staff, the museum authorities have closed down a number of galleries. Similarly, cultural exchanges between National Library and institutions in 95 other countries have been affected, as there is no senior official at the gift and exchange department of the library.

 Stock verification at the library is not being carried out properly as 22 of the 25 posts in the department are vacant.

 Both institutions are finding it difficult to fill up the vacant posts because of the Centre?s policy. The government has set up a screening committee ? comprising secretaries of the departments of culture, education, tourism and finance ? to monitor the recruitment process of prominent institutions, like the museum and the library.

 ?This committee was set up following the Centre?s decision to optimise the direct recruitment scheme. Under the scheme, we have to keep the committee informed about our staff requirement. And without the panel?s consent, we cannot fill up a vacant post,? said a senior museum official.

 The galleries at the museum that have been kept closed include that of painting (art section), ecology, geology (which houses precious stones and fossils) and insect (zoology section). ?We require at least eight employees to run a gallery. But presently, we are not in a position to engage more than one for each,? said director Shaktikali Basu.

 Basu admitted that following the recent theft of a Buddha head, the authorities were apprehensive about keeping all the galleries open. ?No one will spare us and listen to our problems if another exhibit gets stolen. So, we don?t take the risk of keeping the galleries open without adequate security,? he added.

 A senior official said at least 300 employees were required for all 38 galleries. Basu told Metro that he would take up the issue with the Union government. ?I have already informed them about the problems we are facing in running the museum.?

 National Library director Sudhendu Mandal said he had approached the Union department of tourism and culture and sought help in filling up the vacant posts.

 Baby deaths suit spiked, litigant fined 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) on the death of four babies in a day last year at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the petitioner.

 While dismissing the petition, the judges observed that a special bench of the Supreme Court had ruled that high courts should not entertain PILs that are filed for personal or political interests.

 This was the first time since the apex court issued the order that the high court fined a public interest litigant.

 The high court division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutta ruled that petitioner Abdur Rahaman, who had demanded compensation for the families of the victims, failed to produce enough material to substantiate his case.

 The fine ? cost of the case ? was imposed as the judges found that the petitioner had actually wanted to malign the authorities of the hospital.

 Rahaman, represented by counsel Idris Ali and Sreemoyee Mitra, moved the PIL in October 2004 before the division bench of Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi of the same court. 

 Demanding a CBI probe into the deaths, the lawyers claimed that the four children had died during a power cut in the hospital on September 27, 2004.

 They argued that the babies died of suffocation during the period of the power cut ? around an hour-and-a-half ? as the hospital did not have an alternative supply line.

 The bench, presided over by Justice Kabir, had admitted the petition as a PIL and observed that the allegations made by the petitioner were serious. While adjourning the case, the bench had asked the state government to file an affidavit stating its stand. 

 Following Justice Kabir?s appointment as chief justice of Ranchi High Court, the matter was assigned to the division bench of Justice Ganguly and Justice Dutta.

 On Friday, as the matter came up for hearing, government pleader Rabilal Moitra filed a report of a medical board that had probed the deaths, instead of the affidavit that the previous bench had asked for. The medical board?s report ruled out power failure as the cause of the deaths. 

 ?The cause of the deaths is not related to power failure. All the patients were very sick during admission,? the report said. 

 The bench expressed satisfaction over the report and concluded that Rahaman had filed the petition to serve his own interests.

 Counsel Ali later said he would move an appeal against the division bench order.

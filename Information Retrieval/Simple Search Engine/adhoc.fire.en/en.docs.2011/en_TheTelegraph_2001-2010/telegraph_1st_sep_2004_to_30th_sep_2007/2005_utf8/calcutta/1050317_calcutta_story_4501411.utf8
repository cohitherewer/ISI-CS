 Court slaps fraud tag on cop over eviction

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday censured the officer-in-charge (OC) of Behala police station, Swapan Basu, for his perceived role in having a tenant evicted out of a house on the basis of a court order that did not apply to her.

 ?You are a fraud. There are many allegations against you. Try to rectify yourself, otherwise you will have to face the consequences of misdemeanour,? Justice Pranab Kumar Chatterjee told the OC in a packed courtroom.

 The judge asked OC Basu to help petitioner Krishna Chakraborty re-enter her flat on Sourin Roy Road, in Behala, from which she was evicted in November. 

 ?You will break down the wall erected in front of her flat by the flat-owner at your instance and deploy armed guards for the protection of the petitioner,? the court directed.

 The judge also asked landlady Haripriya Nath to pay Rs 3,400 to Chakraborty and said ?she will stay in the flat until the trial court passes any eviction decree against her?.

 OC Basu, however, insisted: ?We have acted on the instruction of the court.? 

 When the court asked him why he did not take action after tenant Chakraborty lodged a complaint with his police station, Basu did not have a satisfactory answer. 

 Last Monday, the judge had directed Basu to appear before him and produce all documents relating to the eviction of Chakraborty, whose case is pending in Alipore court. 

 The court passed the order after Chakraborty moved a petition alleging that court officers, in connivance with Behala police and her landlady, had broken open her flat and taken away all her belongings. 

 She told the court that her landlady had filed two separate eviction suits ? one against her and another against the tenant of the adjacent flat. 

 The landlady had obtained an eviction decree against the tenant of the other flat.

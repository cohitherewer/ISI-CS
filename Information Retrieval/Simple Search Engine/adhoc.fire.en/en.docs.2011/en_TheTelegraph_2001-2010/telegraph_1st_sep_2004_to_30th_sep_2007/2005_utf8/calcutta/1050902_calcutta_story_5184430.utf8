 Its a name to reckon with when it comes to traditional weaves, natural dyes and block prints. And those are precisely the highlights of an exhibition that Weavers Studio is hosting till September 3.

 At the 5/1, Anil Moitra Road store, the show titled Autumn Celebrations in Sunset Hues displays an exquisite range of saris, stoles, dupattas, scarves, kurtis and salwar suits.

 The festive fever is fast catching on and the exhibition gives Calcuttans an opportunity to revel in some great designs in traditional fabrics, says a spokesperson for the store.

 Promoting talented weavers from all parts of the country has always been our agenda and this exhibition does the same, she adds.

 The collection on display includes saris and dress materials in tie-and-dye, Shibori, batik and mud-resist, created by weavers from Rajasthan and Kutch, as well as in-house craftsmen.

 The flowing georgettes, sensuous crepes and elegant tussars come in myriad shades of red, yellow, orange, blue, black and green and are adorned with a fine medley of floral and geometrical motifs.

 The unstitched materials in sober pastels as well as bright hues are embellished with intricate kantha stitch and various interesting prints. They could be ethnic options for skirts, tops, kurtis and stoles.

 The exhibition also houses a range of Maheswari woven and hand-block printed saris and fabrics from Rehwa and Khoj. The kurtis are adorned with a host of interesting embroidery forms, kantha, applique and chikankari. The dupattas come in cotton, silks and tussars. 

 Stoles with patchwork in a combination of colours as well as plain ones are definite eye catchers. Also on offer are experimental surface-textured textile scrolls.

 Natural fabrics have always been our forte and thats what this exhibition is all about. All these fabrics can be worn throughout the year with equal ease, says the spokesperson.

 The price of the saris and unstitched materials start at Rs 2,850. The kurtis are priced at Rs 2,500 and above, while stoles and dupattas start from Rs 450.

 Fusion fare

 Leena Taneja started off as a fashion designer last year and this January she launched her own studio at P-16, Gariahat Road. Within a year of her design debut, the lady has bagged an opportunity to showcase at a Bride and Groom Fair in Bangkok, to be held between September 10 and 12.

 Dressy evening fusion wear is Leenas forte and thats the line she will be taking to the fair. The fair not only showcases bridal wear, but a fair amount of trousseau clothes as well. So, Ill display everything from bridal lehngas, saris, corsets, salwar suits, kurtis, skirts, kaftans and tops, says Leena, who also designs a range of fashionable belts.

 Natural fabrics like georgette, silk, chiffon and brocade shape the garments, which are embellished with Swarovski crystals and sequins with very little prints. Shades of red, pink, orange, magenta, yellow and turquoise comprise the palette.

 While most of Leenas creations can be picked off the racks at her studio that bears her name, the bridal lehngas are mostly done on order. 

 The pret pieces are all priced between Rs 1,000 and Rs 7,000, while the lehngas start at Rs 35,000.

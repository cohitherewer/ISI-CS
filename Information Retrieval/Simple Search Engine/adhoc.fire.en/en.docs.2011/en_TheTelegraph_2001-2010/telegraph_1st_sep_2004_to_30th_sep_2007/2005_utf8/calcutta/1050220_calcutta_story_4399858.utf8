 Trendy, yet rooted in tradition

 The foundation day 

 celebrations at Hindusthan Club. Picture by Rashbehari 

 Das 

 It was some 60 years ago in pre-independent 

 India when 15 strong-willed individuals decided to protest 

 the advent of alien British culture and form a social club 

 where they could spend their leisure in the presence of 

 their own people, following traditions and customs that 

 were truly Indian. Thus Hindusthan Club came into existence. 

 Even today, this remains the only 

 non-alcoholic and all-vegetarian club in the city, just 

 the way it was conceived decades ago, to distinguish it 

 from the other British establishments. You are likely to 

 find the most frequent night clubber enjoying a quiet evening 

 with his family, sipping Soda Shikanji and digging into 

 vegetarian food at this Sarat Bose Road address. 

 On Friday night, the club celebrated 

 its 60th foundation day through a function that could give 

 some of the major social dos of the city competition. One 

 couldn?t blame some passersby who mistook the brightly lit 

 10-storey building for a luxurious marriage venue. 

 Done up in flowers and lights 

 with two horse-mounted security men standing guard at the 

 door, this new club building that will be inaugurated formally 

 in March was indeed looking regal. 

 Pretty hostesses decked up in 

 Rajasthani finery greeted guests at the door and the premises 

 resounded with the sounds of shehnai. With a member strength 

 of 1,917, the turnout on the big day was phenomenal. Whether 

 the open space around the building or the large lounge and 

 the banquet hall inside the club, everything was chock-a-block 

 with member families. 

 ?Some members are more than three 

 decades old in this club while there are others who have 

 just joined, and yet they mingle like one big family,? says 

 club president G.D. Bhaiya. 

 Indeed, that?s what the larger 

 picture looked like on Friday evening with smiling faces 

 chatting up each other, singing along with the live band 

 or just queuing up for the 36-item spread. 

 Yet, the picture just a few years 

 ago was devoid of this grandeur. The club was a humble bungalow 

 where families met for weekend meals feasting on Aloo Puri, 

 Chhole and a host of vegetarian goodies.

 Having bought over the property 

 that was once rented out in 1995, the club authorities decided 

 to give the building a makeover. The result is a fabulous 

 centrally air-conditioned structure that has everything 

 from banquets to guest rooms, lounges to wedding halls. 

 ?Once the place is opened for members, it will be the first 

 club of its kind in India,? announces Bhaiya. 

 The no-onion, no-garlic fare remains 

 a favourite with the members even today. For the foundation 

 day too, Rajasthani specialities were dished out in keeping 

 with the theme of the evening. From Dahi Vada to Mewa Khichri 

 (a sweet yellow coloured mix of dry fruits with sewai), 

 all this and much more was on offer. 

 Drinks included Kesaria Doodh 

 served hot from the clay oven, Chhanch and Bela Sherbat. 

 ?We have been following traditions 

 for the last 60 years, and we hope to continue doing it 

 in the years to come,? signs off Bhaiya on behalf of the 

 members.

 We Ask You Answer

 Potter spell on book-dodgers

 Today?s question: Has Harry Potter taken children back to books? More responses will be published next week

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Bandpur, Hooghly

 Harry Potter is popular only among children studying in elite English-medium schools. No one knows the wizard?s name in the rural areas and hence, it would be an exaggeration to claim that he has taken children back to books. Moreover, those who read Harry Potter books do not necessarily read other books.

 The Harry Potter series is a craze among the students of English-medium schools in the city. Kids from the suburbs and district towns are hardly moved by the wizard?s spells. Therefore it is too much of a generalisation to say that Harry Potter has taken all children back to books. Also, computer games and cartoon channels remain the top draw for urban youngsters.

 Today?s children are computer savvy, but they are also addicted to net surfing and computer games. They simply do not have the time to read. That they are touching books at all owes much to J.K. Rowling. The swelling sales figures and the serpentine queues say it all. However, it is our duty to keep alive this interest in books.

 The fact that the various forms of audio-visual entertainment have not diminished the sale of Harry Potter novels says much about their power. Once the books are translated into the regional languages, they would top all sales charts.

 The Harry Potter films, with their excellent special effects, have certainly taken children back to books. To ensure that the maximum number of children get to see the films, they should be released at Nandan.

 The Harry Potter novels have certainly hooked students of English-medium schools. My granddaughter, who studies in Class VI, insists on reading the exploits of the young wizard the moment the books are published.

 The Harry Potter novels have introduced kids addicted to computer games and television to the pleasures of reading. That is apparent from the sale of the books.

 It is undeniable that Harry Potter has not only taken children back to books, but has become an intrinsic part of their lives.

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Collecting Harry Potter books has become the favourite past-time of kids. To some extent, it has also become a status symbol for parents. Children love fantasy and therefore enjoy reading any book that captures their imagination, whether it is by J.K. Rowling or someone else. The Harry Potter movies and cartoon channels, however, are taking children away from books.

 Ramen Sen,

 Despite millions of copies of Harry Potter books being sold every year, most youngsters prefer to watch the saga on the silver screen. On the other hand, good Indian books are suffering due to lack of glamour and publicity. It would be a gross exaggeration to say that J.K. Rowling has managed to turn cartoon fans into bibliophiles.

 I think Harry?s magic wand has succeeded in bringing children back to books. In the process, the young wizard has managed to mesmerise adults too. Harry Potter films have mindboggling special effects, but one always gets the feeling that the books offer much more. 

Nemo,

 Harry Potter books have certainly cast a magic spell on kids of all ages. It is a fact that J.K. Rowling?s works have taken children back to books.

Basanta Chowdhury,

 Kankinara

 Harry Potter films are a tremendous inspiration to the children. The young wizard never turns his back on a challenge and manages to achieve almost the impossible. His exploits have certainly encouraged children to go back to the books and study hard. 

 Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,

 Dum Dum Park

 There was a time when the primary hobby of children was reading, but with the advent of computer games, books were losing their importance. Thanks to Harry Potter, reading is making a strong comeback.

R.M. Paulmazumdar, 

 Address not given

 Harry Potter hasn?t taken children back to books. Children have always loved reading. But they are compelled to read a lot of text books and seldom find the time to curl up with novels. Television too has eaten into their leisure hours.

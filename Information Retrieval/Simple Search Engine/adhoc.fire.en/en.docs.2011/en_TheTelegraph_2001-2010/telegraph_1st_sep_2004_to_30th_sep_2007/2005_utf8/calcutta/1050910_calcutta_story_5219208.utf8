 Dengue sham irks court 

 - Civic body, govt told to get on with serious damage control 

 OUR BUREAU

 On a day when the death toll touched 17 and another 128 cases were reported from the city and districts, Calcutta High Court rapped the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the government for their failure to contain dengue.

 The dengue death count rose on Friday with Snigdha Bhattacharya, 23, a resident of Baguiati, succumbing to the disease. Eighty-five fresh cases were recorded in the city.

 Hearing a public interest litigation filed by four residents, a division bench comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Amar Ganguly on Friday directed the government and the CMC to play a more active role in preventing the virus from spreading and to submit a report in seven days.

 ?Instead of quibbling over whether it is an epidemic or an outbreak, the effort should be to control the menace and not indulge in irrelevant disputes,? the chief justice said.

 The division bench asked the CMC to conduct more cleanliness drives around the city and directed the civic body to establish contact with general physicians in most wards.

 If anyone succumbs to dengue fever or is suffering from classical dengue, CMC officials should send a team to collect blood samples from the patient and test them for both dengue and malaria.

 ?This is the only way to confirm the exact death toll and the number of people suffering from dengue and malaria in the city,? said Justice Ganguly.

 To ensure that most Calcuttans rushing to CMC health centres get proper medication and counselling, the court further directed the Corporation to keep its 26 dispensaries open till 10 every night.

 At present, the dispensaries are open from 8 am to 6 pm. The bench also urged the CMC to engage extra staff for this purpose, if required.

 The court went on to ask the civic body to spray city streets with van fog machines that had been recently procured from Nagpur.

 But virologists and entomologists have warned that fogging machines would only drive the mosquitoes from one place to another.

 Friday also saw the government health department going into a huddle following the arrival of three entomologists from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). 

 The team will be conducting field visits to ascertain whether the presence of larvae has diminished or increased since dengue-preventive measures were taken.

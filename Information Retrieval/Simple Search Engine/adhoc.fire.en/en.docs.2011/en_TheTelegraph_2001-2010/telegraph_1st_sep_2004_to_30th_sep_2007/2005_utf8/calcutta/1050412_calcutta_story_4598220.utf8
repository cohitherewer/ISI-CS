 Park boon for jewellery artisans

 - Five 

units in howrah to house gold and zari workers 

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Units in and around the city producing handmade zari and gold work are in for a major boost, with the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government set to start parks for them.

 Five mini parks will be established in Howrah district to house the units. A zari park will be set up in Jagadballavpur and a gold park in Domjur. The rest of the parks will be in Panchla.

 While Manikanchan, the gem and jewellery park at Salt Lake, is a centre where large manufacturers and exporters produce machine-made jewellery, the new mini parks will focus on the works of artisans.

 ?We are setting up these small parks to make entrepreneurs out of artisans,? Gopal Krishna, managing director of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), said on Sunday.

 ?We found out that there is a need for improvement of infrastructure and betterment of the working conditions of small manufacturers of gold and zari products,? he added.

 A large number of zari artisans are based in Panchla and Jagadballavpur, while Domjur is known for artisans adept in stone-cutting, polishing and making gold ornaments. Owners of jewellery shops in Calcutta get their work done by the Domjur artisans through middlemen. The craftsmen are often deprived in the bargain.

 The three areas in Howrah were identified for setting up parks during a survey. ?We spoke to the artisans and workers about their needs and requirements, and how the two related sectors could be boosted,? the WBIDC managing director said.

 There are at least 25,000 artisans in Panchla who earn their living doing zari work. In Domjur, around 30,000 artisans do gold work for livelihood. Most of them work in poor conditions, without proper light, even though their job involves intricate and difficult designs.

 There is also a lack of toilets and proper health facilities. The productivity of the artisans is further hampered due to pollution problems.

 The government felt that small parks would help the artisans better than one large park for all of them. 

 ?The idea was to take the parks closer to where the artisans are settled, rather than bringing them to a huge park which might be quite a distance away from where they are now based. So, we decided to set up five small basic units in the three blocks,? Krishna explained.

 Each of the five mini parks will be spread over an area of around two acres, and will have 16 rooms on four floors. Each room will accommodate 25 to 30 artisans.

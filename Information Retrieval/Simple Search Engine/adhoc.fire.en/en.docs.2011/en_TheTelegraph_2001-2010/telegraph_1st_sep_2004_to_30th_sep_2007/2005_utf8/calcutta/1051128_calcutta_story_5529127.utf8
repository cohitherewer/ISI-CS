Surajit Neogy: Why aren?t pavement-dwellers being allowed to vote despite a legal amendment empowering them in 1993? An NGO had submitted names of over 700 pavement-dwellers for inclusion in the electoral rolls. The names were not enrolled on the plea that they were Bangladeshis.

 Bulk forms are not accepted any more. You can only deposit applications for your family members. To be eligible to vote, one has to be over 18, an Indian citizen and of sound mind. If an aged person wants to enroll for the voters? list, the officials are justified in questioning him. Pavement-dwellers may not have documents related to their address. In such cases, a local inquiry can be conducted. Testimony from witnesses and neighbours can help prove their bona fides.

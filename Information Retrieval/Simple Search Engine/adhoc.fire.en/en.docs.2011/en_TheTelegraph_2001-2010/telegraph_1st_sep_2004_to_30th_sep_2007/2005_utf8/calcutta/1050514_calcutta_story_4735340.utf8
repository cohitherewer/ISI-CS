 with sister-in-law Sruti has infused Aksh, the designer

 Skin deep

 A talk on beauty never fails to find an audience, even if one ends up listening to the oft-repeated sermons on cleanliness, balanced diet and drinking lots of water.

 A group of ladies chose to spend a rather hot Friday afternoon in the cool confines of Hyatt Regency, partaking of ready advice from a Kaya Skin Clinic spokesperson on regular skin care.

 If the opening over was more like a skin refresher, what followed could take one to the path of rejuvenation with Kaya detailing its services under three broad categories of enhancement, problem solving and anti-ageing. Microdermabrasion, rehydration, laser therapy, glycolic peels, botox, non-surgical face lift, photo facial are some of the tools of the trade leading to skin polishing and brightening, face and eye rejuvenation, permanent hair reduction, pigmentation and acne-scar reduction, sun spots and wart removal and more. 

 Leader call

 He was invited to address an audience of young leaders from various spheres of work. And Ambuja scion Harsh Neotia managed to pass on more than just plain rhetoric during his half-hour speech, cutting a figure of a mentor with a philosophical bent of mind at the meet organised by the Young Leaders Forum (YLF) at ITC Sonar Bangla Spa Caf? recently. 

 While espousing the cause of aspiring for leadership qualities, Neotia also touched upon the importance of deep-rooted values. 

 The measure of success is the extent to which we are able to conduct our business ethically, he stressed. Neotia went on to confess, Even in my organisation we dont always manage to be as ethical as one would want to. We either dont have the time to take the tough road or dont have the courage to face the consequences. 

 With that Neotia left his audience to pause and ponder.

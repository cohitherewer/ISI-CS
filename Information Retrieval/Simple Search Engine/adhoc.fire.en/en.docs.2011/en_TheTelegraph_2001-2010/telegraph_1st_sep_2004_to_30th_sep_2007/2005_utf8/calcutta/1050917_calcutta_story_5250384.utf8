 You share your birthday with...

 M.F. Husain 

You are not fussy, can mix with all and be the life of a party. You are adept at following the path of least resistance. Your determined nature makes you trustworthy but not always trusting of others. You are always approachable and open to discussion, as long as you have the final word. You are self-motivated and careful about your budget. Working alone is your style. ? Kusum Bhandari

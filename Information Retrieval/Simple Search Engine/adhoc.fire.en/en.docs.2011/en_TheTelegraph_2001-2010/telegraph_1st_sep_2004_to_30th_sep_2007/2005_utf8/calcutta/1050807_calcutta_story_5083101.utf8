 Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) is the new mantra for executives on the move, allowing them Internet access at airports, cafes or street corners. The only problem in Calcutta ? and even across the country ? is the abysmally low number of hotspots (access points) needed to get connected.

 Enter Vdata, a tiny device that allows high-speed Internet connectivity on a laptop without the need of a network cable or a mobile phone.

 ?Vdata works like a mobile phone, allowing data speeds of up to 153 kbps, as well as the option of making calls and sending SMSs,? says Rajesh Puri, chief operating officer (east) of Tata Teleservices. Tata Indicom launched the product around one-and-a-half months ago.

 Vdata is a wireless network card, smaller in size than a credit card, which fits into the PCMCIA-II slot of the laptop. Besides connecting to the Internet or the local area network (LAN), voice calls can be made and received through an earphone connected to the card.

?The connection is limited only by network availability. 

So, a subscriber can use the product in over 2,000 cities in India where we have 

a presence,? Puri says. ?CDMA technology, on which our service is based, allows 

better data handling than GSM,? he claims.

 The card can be purchased with a one-time payment of Rs 10,000. Subscribers can choose between various voice and data plans. The calls are charged at standard voice rates.

Since the launch, the company has sold 200-odd cards 

in the eastern region. ?We plan to sell around 10,000 cards in the east by the 

end of this financial year, with Calcutta accounting for 80 per cent of the sales,? 

Puri offers.

 Other eastern centres with Vdata demand include Durgapur and Jamshedpur. 

 The target buyer for the company is ?everyone who uses a laptop?, the largest chunk of which comprises the business traveller.

 ?It?s a very new concept and a little difficult to explain to those who are used to the modem and phone idea,? admits Puri. 

 Promotional programmes include product demos at corporate offices and free trials, billboard advertisements and tapping of laptop sellers.

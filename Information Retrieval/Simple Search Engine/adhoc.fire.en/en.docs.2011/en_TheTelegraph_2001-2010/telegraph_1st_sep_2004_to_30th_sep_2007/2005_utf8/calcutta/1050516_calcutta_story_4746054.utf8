The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

The red, red carpet at Cannes this summer

 If there rsquo;s one film festival in the world which is more about moves than movies, it has to be the annual Cannes Film Festival. The 58th edition which kickstarted on May 11 has already set many a heart aflutter with the red carpet invasions by some of the most beautiful faces around the globe. Metro brings to you the leading ladies who have set the French Riviera on fire

 Be indian:

 Jury member NANDITA DAS went all ethnic on Day One of the festival as she rode the red carpet in a stunning red sari, bejewelled in gold

 Wow: 

 One of the jury members for this year rsquo;s festival, Mexican actress SALMA HAYEK was, as usual, the most clicked lady as she walked on the red carpet for the opening ceremony and the official projection of French director Dominik Moll rsquo;s Lemming 

 Fame frame:

 Model-actress-heiress PARIS HILTON is, as they say, famous for being famous. She bloomed in a floral gown as she presented her film Pledge This, by US director William Heins, at the Cannes Film Market on the sidelines of the festival

 Hear and there: 

 SOPHIE MARCEAU hogged the lens and the limelight as she arrived for the in-competition screening of Canadian director Atom Egoyan rsquo;s film Where the Truth Lies

 Calcutta calling: 

 KIERA CHAPLIN, better known as Charlie Chaplin rsquo;s granddaughter and who came to Calcutta to shoot Rajshree Ojha rsquo;s film Yatna, flaunted her skull tattoo and ringed jewellery as she strode out for one of the film screenings

 Found in translation: 

 She wasn rsquo;t in scarlet but it was advantage SCARLETT JOHANSSON when she appeared for the out-of-competition screening of Woody Allen rsquo;s Match Point, where she stars opposite Irish actor Jonathan Rhys

 Cut out:

After the dressing debacle last year, AISHWARYA RAI took no chances in her third outing at Cannes as her gowns sported the right cuts at the right places. A former jury member at the festival, Ash is a favourite with the shutterbugs, whether appearing with her mother for a film premiere or teasing the lens with international supermodel 

Laetitia Casta

 Bolt from 

 the blue: 

 She may not be a storehouse of tinsel talent but Czech model ADRIANA KAREMBEU had enough to floor the photographers as she made a fleeting appearance on the much-sought-after 

 red carpet

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Price sop for fliers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The monsoon has set in and it?s raining discounts.

 With all 1,500 Singapore Airlines seats on special offer ? Rs 4,000 return to Singapore and Rs 6,000 return to Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok ? sold out in a day, Indian Airlines (IA) has announced fare slashes up to 60 per cent to boost national travel this season.

 Sahara Airlines promises to beat the national carrier with a revised rate card to be announced on Thursday, while sources said Jet Airways was mulling major price sops for fliers.

 But Wednesday belonged to Indian Airlines and its ?easy fares? , dubbed a ?modified version? of the existing special fares. 

 ?Fly-select fares, apex fares and positioning flight fares have all collectively come under the ambit of easy fares,? explained an Indian Airlines spokesman.

 The unique feature of the easy fare plan is that, unlike the apex fare, there would be no time limit on purchase of tickets. Instead, reservations would be made under the four levels depending upon choice and availability of seats. 

 For instance, the fare on the Calcutta-Delhi sector will be Rs 7,621 (Level 1), Rs 6,121 (Level 2), Rs 5,121 (Level 3) and Rs 4,121 (Level 4). 

 Once the allocation for one level is complete, the passenger will automatically be booked in the next level.

 ?We have more plans for the future and will announce them very shortly. These include passenger comfort as top priority,? said the spokesperson, adding that ?a heavy rush for Level 4? would prompt the airlines to ?explore whether a substantial number of tickets can be kept for it?.

 Beyond boundaries, Singapore Airlines is already having to explore new options ? Rs 6,000 return to Singapore and Rs 8,000 return to the other three destinations, an offer for 60 seats per flight from July 22 to August 19.

 ?If that?s sold out, too, we would definitely be open to more offers,? said Bharath Mahadevan, manager, eastern India, Singapore Airlines.

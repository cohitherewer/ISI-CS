 Worth their salt

 Calcutta knows the difference between its brownie and its mud-pie and can be sharp in its riposte if the kebab is not cooked to perfection. But it also gives you a second chance. It is this second chance ?grabbed with both hands? that has enabled Grain of Salt to stay on course in its quest for culinary excellence.

 ?It?s been one big learning curve for us these past two years and our endeavour is to harness all the feedback and create a palate pick that suits the taste of the city gourmet,? says Pankaj Tandon, administration head of the 22 Camac Street restaurant. 

 The world cuisine eatery has just unveiled its new menu for the third year of operation. The new spread is an eclectic blend of perennial favourites, past rages and fresh fare. Some of the standout items from the set of forthcoming attraction are Hupak Fish (poached fish finished with poached egg and spring onions), Mozzarella Crostini (garlic toast with blanched tomato, topped with slices of mozzarella cheese and pesto) and Golden Fried Chicken (minced chicken stuffed with olives and freshly coated).

 ?Our credo is to constantly reinvent to give the diner what he/she wants and a single set shouldn?t be persisted with for too long. While we have introduced new dishes like Fried Mozzarella Sandwich (mozzarella cheese stuffed with home-made cheese and deep fried), some old favourites had to be brought back on public demand,? says Sanjay Mukherjee, assistant F amp;B manager.

 Sham Savera, a signature dish of master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, the talisman behind the popular Camac Street haunt, is among the golden oldies returning to the tables. Also back are the Black Currant Kulfi and the Orange Caramel Custard. ?There were lots of requests for these items as also for Mediterranean cuisine and we are beefing up our West Asian fare at Shisha (the hookah bar) as well,? adds Mukherjee.

 While on the world cuisine front, there?s the Irish Stew (chunk of lamb cooked in traditional style with vegetables) and the Peppered Mushroom (marinated fresh mushroom in lime and black pepper and grilled), the deshi khazana gets a makeover as well. The Mallika-e-Dariya (fish marinated with Indian spices and char-grilled in tandoor), the Gosht Galouti (succulent lamb mince marinated to softness and grilled) or the Vilaiti Subz Lababdar (American corn, broccoli, red and yellow bell pepper with tomato-based gravy) are worth sampling.

 ?There?s a healthy competition among our Oriental, Indian and world cuisine kitchens and every morning we have a review meeting. A lot of very concrete and useful feedback is obtained from the buffet clientele, which also helps us fine-tune our fare,? says director Nitin Kohli. The new menu card for Grain of Salt has a story printed on the left-hand-side pages to make the dining experience ?more interesting?.

 Chef Kapoor agrees on the need to constantly upgrade the experience. ?A little inventiveness, understanding of the local palate and love can go a long way in winning diners? hearts. People of Calcutta are well aware of what they want and we treat their preferences as our guiding light,? he says.

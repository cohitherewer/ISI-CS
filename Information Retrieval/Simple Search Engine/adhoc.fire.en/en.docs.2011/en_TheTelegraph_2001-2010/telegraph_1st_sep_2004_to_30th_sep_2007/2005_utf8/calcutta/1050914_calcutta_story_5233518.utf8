 Calcutta calling for research firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the information technology (IT) industry in the state registering exponential growth numbers, research and consulting company International Data Corporation (IDC) has decided to make its presence felt in Calcutta.

 ?Everyone is talking about Calcutta and its growth potential. We are here to reach out to a larger audience,? said Ajith Sankar, who looks after software and services research in the globally-renowned agency, on Tuesday, after the inauguration of IDC?s India Security Vision 2005. The event, to be hosted in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune, too, was IDC?s first programme in the city. 

 State IT secretary G.D. Gautama inaugurated the programme, attended by representatives from various IT and IT enabled services (ITES) firms. Business continuity, regulatory compliance and future-proof IT infrastructure ? the participants discussed a gamut of issues related with data security. 

 ?We are trying to facilitate interaction between the CIO (chief information officer) community and the vendors and, thus, promoting awareness on security issues,? said Sankar, adding that the next programme lined up for Calcutta would be on data storage. It will be held in October. 

 According to IDC?s research, safety and security of information assets will continue to be the key concern for corporations. The estimates suggest that the security software market to be over US $ 130 million by 2009. 

 ?Security software is the fastest growing segment in the entire IT spectrum. It grew by around 45 per cent last year and we think the compounded annual growth rate over the next five years will be around 30 per cent,? said Sankar. 

 Telecom and banking and finance industry would be the main drivers of growth, besides the manufacturing and government sector, he added. 

 He, however, declined to link some recent high-profile media expos? in the business process outsourcing industry with the expected growth. 

 ?Bigger Indian companies are investing heavily in security systems and client expectation is driving them towards protecting information. But that?s not enough, as the companies should prepare their security policies to minimise the risk,? summed up Sankar.

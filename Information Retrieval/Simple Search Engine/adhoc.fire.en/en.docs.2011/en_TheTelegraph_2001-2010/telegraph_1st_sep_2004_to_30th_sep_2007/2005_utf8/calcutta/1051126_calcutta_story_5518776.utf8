 SOUMITRA DAS

 The participating artists inaugurate CIMA?s annual exhibition on Friday. Picture by Rashbehari Das

 Many absolutely new names make their appearance in the CIMA annual exhibition, Contemporary Forms, that opened on Friday evening. Their practices are diverse but they have one thing in common ? they would like to break out of the mould, trying to strike out on their own, which is an admirable, though intimidating, endeavour.

 They try to stand tradition on its head, using clever, cheeky images often meant to shock viewers out of complacence. Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar has given a twist to the banal calendar images of Ganga as she descended on the dreadlocks of Shiva.

 Bagchi Sarkar?s single entry, where her medium is acrylic on canvas, has the look of one of those garish calendars. The river springs forth from the eyes of the goddess, somewhat like the torrent of tears that nearly drowned Alice in Wonderland.

 Joydip Sengupta, too, has contributed a single canvas where his take is on photographic reality.

 Kingshuk Sarkar used giant sheets of Japanese handmade paper on which he paints in black watercolour. The work entitled Mudra 1 shows a wildman with his head on his hand. In the second work, graceful calligraphic strokes ripple across the horizontal frame like a serpent in pre-Columbian sculpture.

 Madhuri Kathe?s canvases in soothing blues, charcoal grey and white evoke the solitude of nature. She uses gauze and paper to create a textured surface.

 Sumitro Basak?s visual pun has a strong design element. Titled Handy ?Kick? it shows a man?s hand that has turned into a foot. It looks striking in cream and red with serrated edges.

 Pompa Panwar is inspired by the surroundings of Santiniketan, where she lives, and the changing seasons. She builds up an entire work around the image of the mango.

 The second painting, Summer Special, is a combination of three canvases divided into three sections from the top. The first shows rainclouds. The second, greenery. The third is the saffron ground over which fly helicopters, leaving in their wake a flight of startled white egrets.

 Chintan Upadhyay?s clever drawings of hydra-headed erections, gonads and places of worship are sly digs at fanaticism.

 There are two other sections ? on tribal and folk art, and the contributions of senior and known artists. The brilliant tribal paintings from Madhya Pradesh remind viewers of similar works being systematically destroyed at Bharat Bhavan.

 Huge heads of Durga in profile and Buddha full frontal, painted in oils, dominate the two canvases of Paresh Maity, better known for his watercolours.

 There are two artists from Bhopal ? Akhilesh and Yusuf. Akhilesh?s canvases are usually stark, save the occasional ripples on their smooth surface. He uses splashes of colour this time. With pencil, paper and acrylic Yusuf creates the texture of crumpled leather on what looks like pages of a copybook.

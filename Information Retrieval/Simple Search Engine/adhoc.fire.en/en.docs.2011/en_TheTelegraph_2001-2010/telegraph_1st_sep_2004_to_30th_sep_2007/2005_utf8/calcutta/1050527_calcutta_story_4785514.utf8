 Take a trip to Malaysia or sample its cuisine in Calcutta ? it just got simpler with the Malaysian government opening up options to tuck in and travel. Taj Bengal, along with Malaysia Airlines and Tourism Malaysia, has now brought Malay flavours to town.

 By The Way, the 24-hour multi-cuisine restaurant at Taj, is whipping up exotic dishes. Chefs Sellamal Vengketraman and Mariam Bt Ibrahim have been flown in from Kuala Lumpur and are known to be patronised by the Maharaja and Prime Minister of Malaysia.

 High commissioner for Malaysia Zulkifly Abdul Rahman inaugurated the festival amid a performance by a Malaysian troupe. The number of Indian tourists to Malaysia was 40,000 in 1999 and the number went up to 200,000 last year. With direct flights and special promotions, we expect the number to rise further, said Rahman.

 India, he added, is among the top 10 countries that contribute significantly to Malaysian tourism.

 Theres another tempting offer for holidaymakers. Malaysia Airlines is providing a 10 per cent discount on fares on the Kuala Lumpur-Calcutta-Kuala Lumpur sector to all visitors to Taj Bengal during the 12-day festival, added regional manager of Malaysia Airlines Mohamed Safri Abdullah.

 The regular fare to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore from Calcutta is Rs 10,530 and the fare to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore with Langkawi or Penang included is Rs 15,790, valid from May 15 to October 31. This is eligible for the 10 per cent discount.

 Back at the dinner table, Roslan Abdullah, director of Tourism Malaysia, observed that Indians have started developing an adventurous approach towards cuisine.

 Sanjay Sethi, general manager, Taj Bengal, said the festival will be an extensive tour into Malaysian kitchens.

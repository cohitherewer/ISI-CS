 An endless anticipation

 A faithful reproduction of Samuel Becketts Waiting for Godot, Dream Theatres Godor Pratikshay undertakes a bizarre and surrealistic exploration into the meaning of life. As Vladimir and Estragon, the two central characters, wait for the mysterious, ever-elusive Godot, their partly absurd, partly ominous conversation starkly exposes life?s futility and hopelessness. Vladimir?s confused, intellectual outbursts, coupled with the emotional Estragon?s incoherent ranting, mirror the conflict between the self and the alter-ego, as also express the bitterness, anguish, desolation and isolation suffered by all men. Trapped within the infinite emptiness of modern civilisation, they seek to escape, but in vain. Their only hope of liberation from life?s all-consuming void seems to rest in Godot, who symbolises for them, and perhaps for all of us, a release from an aimless, inconsequential life. Their search for Godot could, in fact, be interpreted as a journey to an unknown destination; a quest that will lead them on towards realising their hopes and dreams for the future. Design and direction: Gautam.

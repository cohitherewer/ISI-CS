 Shirt biggie goes bigger

 Subhro Saha 

 It invented the semi-stiff, built-in collar and the front-open shirt in the late 19th century and was picked by Queen Elizabeth in 1923 as the official supplier of shirts to the Royal family. 

 It then metamorphosed workwear from an insipid palette of blues, greys and whites to more dashing collections like Inferno (blazing shades of orange) and Enigma (shades of blue), or the more recent Evolve, culling the cream from New York and Milan.

 Now, Van Heusen, the biggest formal shirt brand in the world, has unleashed its power dressing wardrobe on Calcuttas burgeoning retail racks with the largest Indian store in its high-profile chain till date.

 The 5,600 sq ft upscale outlet just opened on Wood Street (opposite Pizza Hut) has pegged the initial 12-month sales target at a buoyant Rs 3 crore.

 And why not, asks Hemchandra Javeri, president, Madura Garments, a division of Indian Rayon and Industries Limited, which owns the Van Heusen brand in India. Calcutta has reached an inflexion point and we believe theres a huge opportunity here, with the real estate, retail and IT sectors booming.

 Brand head Shitalkumar Mehta agrees the market momentum in Calcutta is strong enough to sustain an elite store of this magnitude. 

 We have had a very positive response to our range of products in Calcutta, including our high technology-driven product range, which gives us the confidence to set up shop on this scale.

 From the whitest white shirt money can buy to the Oxy-Rich range, the True-Tech non-iron shirt to the Ice-Touch brigade, which promises to stay five degrees cooler than the ambient temperature, and the flexi-waist trousers, Van Heusen has been at the forefront of technological innovation.

 This IQ in clothing is our uniqueness. You can call us the BMW of garments and we promise inner confidence through class and constant reinvention, stresses Javeri.

 The first floor of the Wood Street mega store will house an exclusive suiting wing, with classy lounge seating and a suiting expert to provide the right inputs.

 One in every three shirts sold in the US is a Van Heusen. However, though theres great chemistry with the US parent, our Indian range is completely indigenously conceived and produced, Mehta declares.

 The group usually sends its designers to Europe for the latest fashion trends and based on the feedback, the premium lifestyle brand is evolved.

 Javeri gives equal credit to franchisee Giriraj Maheswari of Creative Polypack for making the giant store dream in Calcutta a reality. The comfort level the group shares with the franchisee often determines the scale and nature of operations.

 Madura Garments is planning another two Van Heusen stores in town, as satellite outlets to the main Wood Street hub. 

 The groups sharp focus right now is retail. We have 25 exclusive outlets all over the country, which should go up to 60 soon. Wood Street will be our flagship for this region and an entry point to the east, explains Mehta.

 The brand head is confident the Calcutta flagship can compete with the two best-performing stores in the chain ? South Ex-II, New Delhi, and Brigade Road, Bangalore.

 We are planning a 7,000-sq-ft store in Connaught Place, the biggest by any brand, the cost of setting up which would be more than our highest turnover, he says.

 Till then, Wood Street holds pole position.

 Turf club signals truce tax

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) has waved the truce flag at Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) by agreeing to pay Rs 35,000 a year as amusement tax.

 Club lawyer Samaraditya Pal asked Calcutta High Court to allow him to withdraw the case against the CMC. A three-year legal battle between RCTC and mayor Subrata Mukherjee came to an end after Justice Soumitra Sen allowed the withdrawal.

 In 2002, the CMC issued a notice to RCTC demanding Rs 10 lakh as five years? amusement tax. The club moved a writ petition before the high court challenging the validity of the notification.

 Pal argued the CMC had no right to claim amusement tax from RCTC as the race-course land was under the army and not the CMC, and that racing does not come under the purview of amusement tax, according to the Bengal Municipal Act.

 CMC lawyer Aloke Ghosh countered that his client had the right to collect tax as the club was earning lakhs through sundry events.

 The civic body supplies drinking water and clears garbage from the race course as well as from the Russell Street club premises.

 The mayor also threatened to stop civic services to the club if it refused to pay the dues. Later, the CMC revised its decision, directing the club to pay Rs 1.75 lakh in arrears and Rs 35,000 per annum as amusement tax.

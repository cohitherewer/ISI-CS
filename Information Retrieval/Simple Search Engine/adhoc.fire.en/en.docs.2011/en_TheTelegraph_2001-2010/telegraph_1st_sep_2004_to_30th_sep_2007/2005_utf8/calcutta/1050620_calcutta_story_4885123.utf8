Life

 Size doesn?t matter

Space-saving furniture is the biggest trend 

in a market in which living areas are rapidly shrinking and needs growing, finds 

Ipsita Deb

 With real estate prices on the rise and sprawling homes shrinking into tiny apartments with little room to spare, space-saving furniture is a term rapidly catching on in the urban market.

 If used wisely, keeping design, placement, style and the latest innovations in mind, this concept could well be your way into a zone thats spacious, defying carpet area and the number of rooms at your disposal.

Wasted areas

 Space-saving furniture, which capitalises on one of the most neglected spots in a house ? the corners ? is a big trend globally, explains Gaurav Goenka of lifestyle store Attitude.

 There are a number of ways you can make the most of otherwise wasted areas. Placing pieces of furniture that are not rectangular but slightly curved helps ensure the corners are taken care of.

Features like U-shaped cabinets and L-shaped duvets 

come to good use and can be found in a number of chic styles at most furniture 

studios.

 Most of the floor space underneath furniture is also wasted, a situation that can be easily remedied.

 A pull-out drawer can be installed under the bed for bed linen, clothes, shoes, toys and such. The awkward area beneath the bathroom washbasin can be converted into a cupboard to form a vanity unit.

Similarly, low tables or small centre tables with 

hinged lids make wonderful storage chests in disguise.

 At Attitude, one can find a flat and sleek three-ft tall cabinet that actually hides a wrought iron shoe rack that can store as many as 24 pairs of shoes. The flatness of the cabinet is the key feature as it provides space to accommodate things around it as well as lending a stylish touch.

Multi-purpose

 Beauty, style and comfort are all desirable qualities in furniture, but sometimes what you really need is a piece that does tricks ? disappearing acts, transformations or acrobatics. Like a bed that folds up to reveal a cabinet, a chair that turns into a step stool or a coffee table that turns into a dining table.

 The glass top of a dining table that seems big enough for four can actually be extended by pulling out an additional panel from underneath it, making it large enough for six.

 A table that can be folded and stacked away when not in use, a sofa-bed or a cabinet that can be converted into a bar are a few more examples of how to maximise your living space.

 Though pull-out sofa beds are still the most popular item, others are slowly catching up, like fold-down beds which can be housed in an alcove and dropped into position overnight and folded back up again during the day. 

 Fold-down tables in a small kitchen are also useful as they can be kept out of the way while the meal is prepared and lifted into position when it is time to dig in.

Modular move

 The modular approach, in which one can buy pieces of furniture piece by piece, based on ones needs, is another space-saving boon. The combination of buying single pieces and rearranging them in various ways is an absolute necessity, especially in small apartments, says designer Gopa Ray.

 exible in design and application, modular furniture systems provide options that use as little floor space as possible. Beds can be manufactured for all mattress sizes, bunk beds add height rather than cramp space and fold-away tables provide an opportunity to expand space in just about every room.

Roomy rules

 Freedom of movement in small spaces is critical as is the ability to combine all needs within the limited space. 

 For instance, the living room can double as a den and sometimes can even be converted into a guest room. 

My study is a private space for work during 

the day but with all the gadgets stored away, it becomes an unrecognisable bar 

for entertaining in the evenings. Using rooms in various ways eases space constraints 

and allows you to have all the rooms you want even if your place is a simple two 

BHK, says designer Anita Mansatta.

 Low seating also serves to enhance a feeling of space. I have a low Japanese futon in my bedroom that doesnt cramp the space, adds Mansatta.

 Finally, using smart technology is another ? if expensive ? space saver. If budget permits, go for a plasma TV, while extendable screens are another good bet. Junk your desktop for a laptop. Built-in microwaves, one-stop grill-roast-baking ovens and sleeker refrigerators are abundant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Design duo in fashion final

 Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla might have given the city?s aspiring couture brigade the thumbs down a week ago, but there are two young talents who have managed to impress the ace designers. The jury for the auditions of Star One?s Lakme Fashion House selected two contestants from the city ? Ruhee Shah and Ruth Alison Narjinari ? to participate in the finals of the reality show to be held in Mumbai.

 While the initial decision was to choose four contestants from each metro to be part of the 16 who?ll go through the seven-week grind, the jury comprising Abu, Sandeep and Anamika Khanna found only two from Calcutta fit for the finals.

 The final prize ? a six-month internship with Donatella Versace in Milan plus the opportunity to showcase at the Lakme India Fashion Week 2005 ? is what both Ruhee and Ruth are eyeing. But to be one of the top 16 young designers from across the country is an achievement in itself, feels Ruhee. ?Abu Jani came up to me personally and said ?your work is very good?. That itself is a big achievement for me,? she says. 

 After passing out from the fashion design department of NIFT in 2000, Ruhee had stints with a couple of export houses and Sabyasachi Mukherjee. It was her determination to develop her own style that saw her launching her label Crux a couple of years ago, which she supplies to boutiques like Moksh and Intrigue. 

 Ruhee is right now trying her hand at designing both western wear, mostly skirts and tops, and ethnic outfits including saris and salwars. All of these bear touches of what she believes is her forte ? combination of traditional embroideries from various states of India. So, one would find threadwork from Rajasthan, Kashmir, Gujarat, Bengal and a few other states adorning her outfits. The skirt, top and jacket that she showcased at the auditions bore her trademark embellishments, too. ?Though I am doing both western and Indian clothes now, I think I am particularly good at designing ethnic wear,? says Ruhee.

 And that?s where she differs from Ruth, who likes to project western wear as her strong point. A former student of fashion design from Wigan and Leigh College, Ruth too started her career with an export house before joining designer Sayon Mitra. Her forte, she explains, is crochet and Macreme work ? a technique of knotting. And it is the use of this technique in the knee-length skirt, top and jacket that she designed for the auditions that helped Ruth make her way to the finals.

 With just a day left for the two to fly to Mumbai for the final round of the contest, last-minute preparations are keeping them busy now. While Ruhee is trying to improve on her sketching, which she feels is her ?weak point?, Ruth in concentrating on ?construction of garments, basics of draping and pattern-making?.

 The 16 finalists will be made to perform various fashion-related odd jobs for seven weeks, starting February 2. There will be an elimination at the end of every week, based on SMS votes from viewers all over the country. The final winner will be chosen by a jury comprising Versace, Naomi Campbell and local film and cricket stars.

 But it?s the event, more than the prize, that both Ruhee and Ruth are looking forward to. ?It will be the experience of a lifetime,? smiles Ruhee. Ruth agrees: ?Though I am a bit nervous, I am looking forward to the whole experience.?

 Nostalgia nuggets

 A quiz by the hills, of the hills, from the hills. But for everyone. Nostalgia, the quiz organised by the North Point Alumni Association, along with The Telegraph, not only turned back time but also transported the packed Oberoi Grand ballroom to the Darjeeling mall and the Kalimpong cafes on Saturday evening.

 Conducted by Barry Brien in his characteristic style, the 30-question written preliminary round picked the best eight teams on stage from the many old-school teams that had registered. 

 The three-member teams mostly consisted of alumni members of schools, but sometimes even spouses of ex-students figured in the Q amp;A scheme of things. 

 Of the questions in the elimination rounds, the ones that stood out included unrecognisable pictures of John Wayne and Sunil Dutt.

 The teams that made it to the final round were Dr Grahams Home (Kalimpong), Loreto (Darjeeling), North Point (Darjeeling), St Columbus (Delhi), South Point, St Xaviers Collegiate School, St Xaviers College and Calcutta Boys. What followed was an audio-visual rollercoaster through the hills, as the teams fought it out in a close battle of the minds.

 Barry came up with some mindboggling gems. Sample this: In an up-country Anglo-Indian house, what is a runaway Jack? Answer: The Indian-styled potty which just runs away? Then, if an adolescent guy tells his friend shadow lagabi what does he mean? Answer: To draw a moustache with a pen or mascara to look like a man!

 The visual rounds were equally engrossing with pictures of two celebrities morphed into a single face and separate places, personalities and things connecting to a single thing or person. What possibly can bring John Abraham, Ashoke Kumar and Lawrence Olivier together? Well, all their names have the names of Calcutta schools ? St Johns Diocesan, Ashok Hall and St Lawrence!

 After many such mind-crunchers and the tie-breaks that followed, St Xaviers College won the quiz, with Calcutta Boys and St Columbus first and second runners-up.

 Quiz over, it was time to honour the hands that had nurtured these students. Two teachers were honoured for their lifetime contribution in not just the field of education but to humanity at large. Like Swati Basu of Holy Child School who had once saved a girl from committing suicide by risking her own life.

 It was Basu who came up with the words for the evening: We cant create a rose, we can just help them bloom to the fullest, she said as she was being felicitated.

 so getting a standing ovation was Ramona Quadra of St Thomas Day School who could just say thank you, eyes welling with tears.

 After the celebrations and felicitations, it was time to hit the bar and then the buffet table. 

 And as the organisers had promised, the dance did happen even if it wasnt exactly a floor fit to groove. 

 But then again, you dont need to cajole the old folks to rock. They know more than anyone else how to make the night one to remember.

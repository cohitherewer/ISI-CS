The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The City Diary

 As many as 4,000 executives of Calcutta Telephones and West Bengal Telecom began an ?indefinite non-cooperation? from Tuesday, disrupting the service availed of by around 1.35 million BSNL landline subscribers in the city. The protest is part of a nation-wide movement, by around 50,000 officers, demanding implementation of the conditions stated in the agreement for their transfer from DoT to BSNL in October 2000.

 n the first day of the agitation, landline users could not connect to mobile subscribers of Airtel, Hutch and Reliance for a few hours in the morning. The situation, which returned to normal later, may further worsen as repair work is not likely to be undertaken as long as the agitation lasts.

 ills cannot be paid at BSNL centres across the country as accounts officers, too, will join the protest from Wednesday. Sources said the stalemate, if not resolved soon, might result in a cash crunch for the organisation.

 he United Forum for BSNL Executives said the management should ensure smooth functioning of the organisation, as it had been notified about the agitation on January 19. Calcutta Telephones officials could not be reached for comment.

 ne of the clauses in the transfer agreement was that ?executives in BSNL will be allowed upgradation to the next higher IDA pay scale on a time-bound basis, varying between 4-6 years?. Amit Gupta, state secretary of the All India BSNL Employees Association, alleged that the management had failed to honour the commitment.

 Gold ornaments studded with precious stones, worth around Rs 7 lakh, have been stolen from a house in Jugal Kishore Das Lane, in the Amherst Street police station area. The theft was discovered on Monday night, when 69-year-old Giribala Gorai, who stays alone in the house, saw that the cupboard in which the jewellery had been kept was broken. 

 olice said Gorai could not recall when she had last seen the ornaments. In her complaint, she stated that she had not opened the cupboard locker since the death of her husband a year ago. Gorai suspects a domestic help, who had quit a few days earlier after serving the family for years, was behind the theft. 

 Malabika Konch was not allowed to fill up the form for the Higher Secondary (HS) exams as she could not arrange the fees in time. On Tuesday, Justice Jayanta Biswas of the high court not only ordered the HS council to allow the girl to fill up the form, but also asked the authorities to waive her fees, if possible. 

 Treat this order as mandatory. If you (the council) do not allow Malabika to fill up the form, she will appear in the examination by virtue of the court order,? the judge ruled.

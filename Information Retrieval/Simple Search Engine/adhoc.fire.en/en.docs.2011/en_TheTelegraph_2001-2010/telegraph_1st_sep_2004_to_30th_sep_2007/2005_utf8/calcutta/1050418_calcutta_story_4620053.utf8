Life

 Soul style amp; forest feel

at LIFW later this week 

 In a fashion industry largely focussed on women?s clothing, here?s someone who has made men?s wear his forte. Calcutta-based designer Lalit Jalan, along with wife Sunita, has been quietly catering to the wardrobe requirements of some of the most famous men in the country for the past 15 years.

 And what many of us don?t know is the fact that the designer duo has been showcasing at the Lakme India Fashion Week (LIFW) for the past four years and is all set to unveil designs on the country?s most prestigious ramp this year, too.

 ?This is the fifth year we will be having a ramp show at LIFW. While in our store Hunar we only specialise in traditional men?s clothing, for our shows we also do a lot of women?s wear,? says Lalit, adding that what women wear comprises 30 per cent of the collection to be displayed at LIFW on April 24.

 The four collections to be showcased by the designers have a common theme binding them. 

 The pret line portrays the ?confused soul of the global wanderer? through the clothes, which also ?crystal gazes into the future and holds answers they are searching for?.

 Natural fabrics like cotton, silk and linen have been blended with synthetic in all the lines.

 An element of ?deformation? has been added to the normal line with special detailing and features like gathers, pleats, tucks and layers. 

 ?Lots of layering and multi-coloured circles bring out the layers of thoughts that the confused soul goes through. We have shown the same embroideries in different colours to produce the same effect,? reveals Lalit.

 For men, the collection offers shirt, pant, short kurta, kurta shirt, sherwani and jacket. Designs for women include saris, jackets, skirts, pants and kurtis.

 ?Though the silhouettes are western, there?s an Indian feel to the garments. And the Indo-western clothes are mostly party wear,? he adds. 

 The palette for the entire collection starts with cream, beige and white, and slowly introduces aqua blue and aqua green.

 The subdued clothes are brought alive by surface development with texturing and ornamentation and embroidery merging with prints and dyes.

 The collection is accessorised by beaded necklaces, bold bracelets, nose rings, gloves, masks and long bags.

 The husband-wife designer story from Calcutta continues with yet another duo set to make an appearance at LIFW this year. 

 Designers Swapan and Seema Suhasaria have participated through stalls at the fashion week in 2002 and 2004. This time, too, the couple will give the ramp a miss in favour of their stall at the event.

 ?A ramp show at LIFW means 10 times more pressure than putting up a stall. And since we already have big export orders and are in the process of opening another store in Delhi soon, we had to skip the ramp,? explains Swapan.

 Known for their trademark wedding lehngas and saris, which they retail from their studio called Vachi on Sarat Bose Road, the designers this time have given their traditional repertoire a fresh twist.

 As yet another stately tree falls to the axe of human greed, as yet another petition goes up to save the greens, Swapan amp; Seema will bring to LIFW 2005 their collection inspired by the rainforests.

 ?Our collection is inspired by the verdant world. It?s young and trendy, with an international feel that unites the world in its concern for the forests. The line is not quite flamboyant and exudes free spirit with its non-conformist style,? explains Swapan.

 The creations use flowing embroidery and cuts that have been ?motivated by the serenity of life in the stark wilderness?.

 The palette comprises various hues of browns and greens that spell the magic of the forests. They have used an assortment of fabrics like hand-spun cotton, georgette and silk that create a flowing and sensuous feel.

 Trousers, tops and skirts are given new twists with detailed pleats and gatherings. Lots of shimmer and sparkle embellish the garments.

 In contrast to the western wear line, the saris and lehngas are gorgeous with antique zardosi, gota, sequins, thread work and velvet aplenty. Yet, the same theme of the rainforests is carried forward in this ethnic range too. 

 ?Every design has been inspired by the forest ? from circles that depict life-giving raindrops to the haphazard lines of the tree branches. It is a collection which is as feminine as the life-giving tree. It is a tribute to every woman who loves life,? smiles Swapan.

 And of them there will be aplenty in the audience.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Facility lack sparks CU agitation

 - One 

classroom and Laboratory for 105 tech students 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 At a time when promotion of information technology (IT) is one of the priorities of the state government, more than 100 students of the Calcutta University?s IT and computer applications department on Tuesday launched a movement against lack of infrastructural facilities in their department.

 The agitating students alleged that even though four years have passed since the launch of the M.Tech in IT and master in computer applications (MCA) courses at the university, the infrastructure has remained inadequate.

 The university has failed to provide the kind of infrastructure that has been made mandatory by All India Council of Technological Education (AICTE) for running such courses, they added.

 To protest the apathy of the university authorities, the students boycotted classes on Tuesday. They said the boycott would continue indefinitely. 

 In a memorandum submitted to vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee on Monday, the students had threatened to start a fast-unto-death programme if their demands were not met within a week.

 Responding to the government?s appeal to universities asking them to take an initiative to promote study and research in IT and computer applications, Calcutta University had launched the courses.

 ?There is only one classroom for 105 students, a single laboratory and no library,? Santadeep Das, an MCA student and assistant general-secretary of the SFI-controlled students? union of the university, said.

 According to the rules of the AICTE, the national level apex body that frames and regulates rules concerning running of engineering and technological courses, there should be a minimum of five classrooms, nine laboratories, one library and one reading room for 105 students.

 The students said they had approached the authorities several times over the past four years, asking them to look into their problems. But nothing had been done so far, they complained.

 ?We wonder how the AICTE had granted permission to the university to start offering the courses with such poor infrastructure,? the students said.

 The students pointed out that they were paying Rs 3,000 per month as tuition fee, in addition to other fees, for studying the courses. Post-graduate students of other courses pay between Rs 100 and Rs 150 per month.

 The university received funds under the World Bank?s Technological Education Improvement Programme for the two departments. Nearly 100 computers were purchased with the money. But they are lying unused, as there is no space to set them up.

 Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), said: ?Some of the problems of the students are genuine. We are taking steps to improve the infrastructure in the departments before the end of the month.?

 KFC is pushing for more seats and plotting for more outlets. Subway is busy baking more bread and planning to multiply. 

 Now, it?s time for Pizza Corner and Coffee World to bite into the Calcutta food and beverage pie.

 Global Franchise Architects (GFC) is set to launch its two brands, Pizza Corner and Coffee World, in Calcutta ?by April 2006?.

 The Swiss company, with a largely southern focus, first came calling with Chennai?s Pizza Corner in 1996. Since then, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad have been its bastions, with a stray foray into Delhi and Mumbai. 

 Now, Calcutta is calling out loud.

 ?Calcutta has been on our radar for quite some time now and we have been tracking the development and the success of various brands in Calcutta. Fast food is flying fast off the racks here. If anything has to happen, it has to happen now or else we will miss out on the chance,? says Anoop Sequeira, CEO, GFA (India).

 Pizza Corner operates in three formats ? sit-in, home delivery and the Express located in malls and food courts for quick service, low pricing and limited menu. The first Pizza Corner outlet in Calcutta will follow the sit-in format, with a plush look and feel.

 ?The dine-in area ranges between 1,500 and 2,500 sq ft. In Calcutta, we are looking for a place with a good mix of local and floating population, close to offices and residences. These restaurants will also have play areas for children, providing fun, food and relaxation,? says Sequeira.

 The prices will be affordable with lots of local taste, stresses the CEO.

 The Coffee World outlets, however, target the premium segment, with rates on the higher side and fare that is international. ?The Coffee World outlets have a swanky feel with lounge seating. The food is international with sandwiches being a major draw,? says Sequeira.

 But does the Calcutta F amp;B table have space for more players? Of course, say the existing ones. ?The Calcutta market has huge potential and entry of other brands will give people more choice,? says a Caf? Coffee Day spokesperson.

 ?The pizza market is excellent and it will grow with more players coming in. Since the time we opened up and Domino?s and Pizza Hut came in, the market has grown three times. But they (outside players) must add local taste and keep the prices affordable,? says Rikki Dewan of Don Giovanni?s.

 There are 38 Pizza Corners and four Coffee World outlets in India, but 60 Coffee World outlets in Thailand. ?Pizza Corner is growing out of India and Coffee World is growing out of Thailand,? says Sequeira.

 After the south, the east has been earmarked for an aggressive marketing plan. 

 ?Once our supply chain is in place, we will be rolling out many more outlets in Calcutta and then in the entire eastern region,? promises the CEO of the Swiss company that has signed Esha Deol as brand ambassador.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Feluda, the juggler of roles

 Six-ft-something and that piercing gaze. You can?t help thinking Feluda when you look at him. But it is also not hard to see how he has lent muscle to Satyajit Ray?s suave and gentle sleuth. ?I don?t have the good looks of Soumitra Chatterjee, and so Sandip Ray has used my rugged looks to his advantage,? says Sabyasachi Chakraborty with that arresting smile.

 This Friday, it?s a thriller of a different kind that will have one of our busiest actors in the throes of despair, when Sandip Ray?s Nishijapon releases across the state.

 Almost two decades after he first caught the public eye, playing the handsome Gora in Tero Parbon on Doordarshan, Sabyasachi has emerged as the ubiquitous character actor of our times.

 Just take a look at the roles and the genre of films he?s juggling. A family man in Nishijapon, a good cop in a potboiler, a doctor in two offbeat films, a village head in a social drama, the father of a bridegroom in a slapstick comedy, a father again, this time to Saif Ali Khan, in Parineeta.

 And yet he feels he can do more. Like what? ?An action thriller like The Dirty Dozen. I want to be part of a film where I would play an ex-armyman training a group of unruly men,? rattles off Sabyasachi, with a twinkle in his eye. ?I am just tired of looking glum-faced and doing serious roles. I think I have done too many of those in the last few years.?

 Sabyasachi clearly revels in the variety of roles he is being offered. ?Even in a film like Shankar Roy?s Sangram, I played a cop who is a little different than the run-off-the-mill. In Avijit Dasgupta?s Dwitiya Basanto, I am a doctor and my wife is Rituparna Sengupta. In Je Jon Thake Majkhane, which is still on the floors, I play a doctor again. But here I am divorced from my screen wife Debasree Roy. Something completely different is Manush Bhoot, where I will play the head of a village.?

 Being the bridegroom?s father in Partha Sen?s comic caper came as a whiff of fresh air. ?I love doing comedies and I loved doing Ek Ekke Teen. It?s an out-an-out slapstick comedy. I am in dhoti-punjabi and Soumitrada (Chatterjee) plays my elder brother. There was a laugh riot on the sets as all comedy actors of Tollywood were shooting together,? grins Sabyasachi, who is desperately trying to cut down on television work.

 The small screen had eaten up most of his time last year and he is in the mood to take it easy. ?2004 turned out to be too much for me. I had lots of anchoring to do. I have stopped doing mega-serials as they have a very erratic schedule. It?s a drain on me, physically. And I am also tired of the same dialogues, same sequences, same patterns. The telefilms, on the other hand, are quite a refreshing change and I think I will do them on and off.?

 Directing TV serials is yet another aspect that Sabyasachi has shied away from, having called the shots for around 100 episodes of the Rahasya Galpo series on ETV. ?I don?t enjoy doing it anymore. There?s so much budget constraint? Someday I would like to direct a film, an action thriller. I also have some of my father?s stories in mind.?

 Amidst all the madness, the priorities in life remain crystal clear. It?s films, theatre, wildlife photography and roaming in the jungles? in that order, says Sabyasachi, who refuses to relinquish his roots. ?I would sleep on trunks when my parents did theatre,? he recounts, before adding: ?I will not quit theatre because it?s what I had started out with. I work from A to Z in Charbak?s productions. I am involved with the planning, sound effects and lights, which is not possible in cinema. After three months of preparation, you can get the direct audience reaction on stage. Every show is different and you can improvise daily.?

 The live act is something for which Sabyasachi is ready to let go a lot, even a bit of Bollywood. ?I am not prepared to stay out of Calcutta for a long period because that affects my rehearsals. I had given up on Monsoon Wedding and Lagaan. For Lagaan, I needed to be away for 62 days. And besides, I need to be told a month in advance so that I can plan my work here, something which the Bollywood people seldom do,? he explains.

 But there?s a stronger reason behind his reluctance to make a dash for Hindi films: ?You know, I feel I can deliver my best only in my mother tongue. The same doesn?t happen in any other language.?

 After Mani Ratnam?s Dil Se, Sabyasachi did appear in Raj Kumar Santoshi?s Khakee a year ago. ?There, I got to work with Amitabh Bachchan, which was a dream come true. I don?t know if Jayadi (Jaya Bachchan) had a hand in getting me the role or not. While working with her in Raja Sen?s Desh, I had told her that I would love to work with Bachchan. I was shooting for Bombaiyer Bombete when Rajkumar Santoshi called me up for a role. I was supposed to play a cop initially, but later I was given the politician?s role, which had more scenes with Bachchan,? says Sabyasachi, who harbours another Bollywood dream ? to work with Paresh Rawal.

 ?That is my last wish as far as Hindi films are concerned,? smiles the die-hard Feluda fan.

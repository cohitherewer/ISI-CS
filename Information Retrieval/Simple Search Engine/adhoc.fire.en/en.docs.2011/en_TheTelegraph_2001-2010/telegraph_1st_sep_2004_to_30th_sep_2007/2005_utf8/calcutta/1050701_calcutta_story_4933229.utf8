 What happened when Raghavendra Rathore met Jacqueline Kennedy; why Sabyasachi Mukherjee attempted suicide thrice after he came to Calcutta from Chandannagore; how Rohit Bals lush childhood days spent in Kashmir influenced his work over the years...

 Such unknown nuggets of information about the lives of Indian designers have been captured in print for a chronicle of contemporary fashion history. 

 Called Indian Fashion, the book by Hindol Sengupta is the first comprehensive documentation of the countrys vibrant fashion industry.

 The volume features the works, life and times of 32 of Indias most renowned designers. Biographical profiles of each are accompanied by Q amp;As and never-before-seen photographs and sketches of the designers works. 

 The book boasts a foreword by design doyenne Ritu Kumar and separate sections on the Fashion Design Council of India, the countrys apex fashion body, and National Institute of Fashion Technology, the premier training institute.

 In India, we dont have a sense of contemporary history in most fields. Particularly in fashion, theres no documentation whatsoever. But we must change that to be able to grow as an industry. We must build the necessary infrastructure for aspiration. My book is the first step towards that, said Hindol. 

 The book, he stressed, will particularly benefit fashion students and writers, who till now hardly had an encyclopedia of modern fashion to refer to.

 While the book was unveiled during the India Fashion Week in Delhi earlier this year, the Calcutta launch took place on Wednesday evening at the Oxford Bookstore with much fanfare. 

 The citys design honchos ? Anamika Khanna, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Mona Lamba, Pali Sachdev and Sabyasachi Mukherjee ? unveiled the book in the presence of a select audience.

 The process of penning the book had proved to be an unforgettable experience for Hindol. I thoroughly enjoyed interviewing each designer. In the process I came across some very interesting bits of information about each of them that the world does not know, he revealed.

 I had some very hilarious experiences too. For instance, Ravi Bajaj got up in the middle of the interview and declared that he wanted to give up the whole business of designing, he grinned.

 To hear out each designers take on fashion was one of the most enjoyable parts of composing the book, according to the young author. My favourite quote in the book is by Suneet Verma. He says fashion is the politest way of talking about sex, laughed Hindol.

 The launch of the book was followed by a panel discussion by the designers on global trends in Indian fashion. Moderated by the writer, the talk saw the speakers giving voice to their perspective on Indian fashion in the global context.

 Post 9/11, the world is going through an ethnic influence in fashion. And India is scoring along with all other countries with strong cultural pasts. This is just the time for Indian fashion to make its mark internationally, explained Sabyasachi. And the process has begun quite successfully, agreed all five.

 On a visit to Rome recently, I saw the Indian kurti making its presence felt on the racks of big designer stores as well as roadside haunts. In Singapore I came across DKNY dresses with brocade borders and Prada skirts with Kutch mirror work. It only goes to prove that Indian fashion is increasing achieving global prominence, said Kiran.

 To stop catering to western outsourcing units and developing our own fashion identity is the way forward, felt Anamika. We designers must stop servicing outsourcing units. Instead, we must delve deeper into our countrys vast repertoire of crafts and team them up with international silhouettes to make our own signature Indian style, she said.

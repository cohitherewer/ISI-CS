The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chill not winter overture

 - Minimum temperature drops, power demand follows suit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 There has been a nip in the air for the past few days, and on Sunday and Monday, the minimum temperature dipped to about 18 degrees Celsius, an almost two-degree drop from last Saturday?s 19.7 degrees. 

 But the Met office insists the low temperature is not the harbinger of winter, though Calcutta may expect a further drop in the minimum temperature in the days to come.

 The weather office said winter is still far away. ?This is only a temporary phenomenon. This is not the onset of winter,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

 ?The sky was clear for the past two days and that allowed the North Wind to flow in unhindered to Calcutta and the districts,? the director said.

 The temperature, however, is likely to rise slightly on Tuesday, owing to an incursion of moisture in the upper air from the sea following a south-westerly windflow. ?This moisture will lead to partial clouding of the sky over Calcutta and so the temperature will rise,? he said.

 From Wednesday, the minimum temperature is likely to drop below 18 degrees for a couple of days, as there is the possibility of snowfall in Kashmir. ?The snowfall is expected to influence the temperature in Calcutta,? Debnath added.

 The minimum temperature started dropping from Saturday. Officers said a high-pressure belt had formed over central India, pushing the North Wind towards Jharkhand, Bihar and Bengal. 

 ?The formation of a low pressure in the Bay of Bengal near Tamil Nadu is helping pull in the North Wind. Wind always has the tendency to flow from a high-pressure zone towards a low-pressure zone. We now expect a situation favourable for a clear passage of the North Wind for a few days,? an official said.

 Met officers gave the assurance that the low pressure in the sea had no chance of moving towards Calcutta.

 From Sunday itself, there was a change in the air. Fans and air-conditioners were switched off at night and the demand for power dropped.

 ?The demand for power in Calcutta was less on Monday evening than on a normal weekday because of the nip in the air,? a power department officer said.

 Last Monday ? the day before Kali puja ? the evening peak-hour demand was 1260 MW. ?Today, the demand fell by nearly 200 MW. This evening, there was a 1075 MW demand for electricity. So, the demand has fallen considerably because of the drop in temperature,? a CESC officer said.

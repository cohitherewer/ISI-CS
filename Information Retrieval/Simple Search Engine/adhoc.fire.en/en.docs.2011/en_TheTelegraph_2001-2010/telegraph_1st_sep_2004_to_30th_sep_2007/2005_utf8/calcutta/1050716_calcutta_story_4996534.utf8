 Chided son hangs himself with sari

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Unable to stomach his mother?s rebuke in front of his four-year-old brother, a 16-year-old Class X student of a Shyambazar school hanged himself from the ceiling of his room.

 Debasish Mondal used his mother?s sari to hang himself, leaving his parents in a state of shock, and neighbours at a loss for words. The suicide was discovered around 11.30 am, when Debasish?s uncle Shyamal Mondal came to the house at 129/A/2, Aurobindo Sarani, and found the door casually shut. 

 As he stepped inside, he saw Debasish hanging from the ceiling. 

 ?The body has been sent for post-mortem. Local people said the boy was very good in his studies,? observed Dulal Dey, officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station.

 Police claim it all started with Debasish?s mother asking his brother Subhas to take a bath before going to school. The four-year-old has been admitted to a kindergarten school in the neighbourhood this year, and the mother wanted to ensure that the child reached school on time. 

 ?Around 9 am, when the mother found that Subhas had still not taken his bath and was busy playing games, she started beating him,? said the investigating officer. 

 As the little boy howled, Debasish came out of his study to find out was up. As the mother dragged his brother to the bathroom, he started clapping with glee. 

 The mother was not amused. After finishing with her younger son, she walked up to Debasish and chided and even beat him up for his strange behaviour. Debasish never protested.

 Around 9.40 am, Debasish?s father Gautam ? a state health department staff ? left for his office Swasthya Bhavan, in Salt Lake. Before stepping out, he asked his elder son if he would go to school and was happy to know that he would. 

 That was the last time Gautam saw his elder son alive. 

 Soon after his father left, Debasish?s mother, too, went out with her younger son to his school. While leaving, she asked him to close the door from inside. 

 Debasish probably decided to end his life as everybody had left and he was all alone. According to police officers, he took out a blue sari belonging to his mother, rolled it to form a rope, and used it to tie the knot. 

 There was no one around when Debasish died, possibly around 11 am.

 Half-an-hour later, when Shyamal, the boy?s uncle, walked in, he was the first to see the body. There was froth in one corner of his mouth and the body was still warm.

 ?His uncle first raised an alarm, calling in the neighbours. Later, the mother, too, arrived from the kindergarten. As the news spread, some of Debasish?s friends, too, turned up at the house. We were subsequently informed,? said the investigating officer.

 As soon as the mother realised what had happened to her elder son, she passed out. The uncle called up Debasishs father Gautam in Salt Lake and asked him to return home immediately. 

 By the time Gautam returned, news of the suicide had spread all over the locality, and some neighbours had informed the police.

 Police did not found a suicide note in Debasishs pocket.

 Senbo back in business

 - Japan agency frowns on use of leftover flyover funds

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 January 2005: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee apologises for the delay in completion of the Park Street flyover built by Senbo.

 May 2005: The construction firm is back in business ? this time, apparently, through the back door.

 Contractor Senbo has clinched a fresh project for tram track de-reservation on Rashbehari Avenue.

 In October 2004, officials from the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) had read the riot act to Senbo and transport department officials over the repeated delays in finishing the Park Street flyover.

 The new contract is for the de-reservation, concretisation and relaying of 713 m of tram track from the Gariahat intersection to Triangular Park.

 According to transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, Senbo is using leftover funds from the Gariahat flyover project.

 JBIC, the funding agency for the project, might not buy the government line. Fusato Tanaka, JBIC official in Delhi, said he had ?no knowledge? of the latest development. 

 ?But the transport department cannot undertake any new project with leftover funds without our approval,? he said.

 ?Tram tracks were not mentioned anywhere in the Package II agreement with JBIC. The money is meant only for the Gariahat flyover,? added an official requesting anonymity.

 The Rs 64-crore deal, part of the Calcutta Transport Infrastructure Development Project, included the Gariahat flyover and at-grade improvements in Esplanade. Of this, Rs 18.63 crore has not been spent.

 While contractors Senbo completed the Gariahat flyover after an extension in the deadline in April 2002, work under the bridge is far from finished. 

 Work has just begun on re-installation of the main manhole at the junction. This involves laying and connecting 50 m of sewerage lines, and is expected to take about three months if there are no rain interruptions.

 But Senbo claims the new project was taken up as the state government does not want to return the unutilised funds.

 ?From a total of Rs 63.63 crore in Package II, we have spent around Rs 45 crore,? explains Senbo?s Kajal Sengupta. ?Since the decision for tram track upgrade was taken, Calcutta Municipal Corporation has also pressured us into taking up repair of the main brick sewer on Rashbehari Avenue near Basanti Devi College,? he added.

 Death probe met with silence

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A day after the death of Gouri Rani Chakraborty, health department mandarins got a taste of the state of affairs in government-run hospitals. 

 On Wednesday morning, patients in the female ward of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital told visiting officials they had not seen or heard anything on Sunday night, when ants had feasted on Gouri Rani?s bandaged eye.

 ?Some said they had gone for diagnostic tests, while others said they were either sleeping or too preoccupied coping with their own suffering to have noticed anything,? said Prabhakar Chatterjee, director of health services.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra had sent Chatterjee and director of medical education Jayshree Mitra on a one-hour visit to the hospital for first-hand information on the last 24 hours of Gouri Rani?s life and to cross-check allegations of negligence.

 ?It was quite obvious that the patients had been specifically warned to keep their mouths shut. No one knew what had happened that night, when Gouri Rani had kept crying out in pain. The inspection was a non-starter from the minute news leaked that the officials were on their way to the hospital,? said a senior health department official present during the inspection.

 Fed up with the silence, Mitra and Chatterjee returned to the health department headquarters in Salt Lake.

 ?We have summoned each person involved in Gouri Rani?s treatment. Even the family members will be asked to depose before the commission on Monday,? said Chatterjee.

 ?It is, however, obvious that Gouri Rani did not die of the ant bites but from uncontrolled diabetes. We will also examine what had happened in the private clinic in Barrackpore, where she previously underwent treatment. Until then, no one can be held guilty,? Chatterjee added.

 On Monday, the health department will individually examine the hospital superintendent, the nurses and the two doctors responsible for Gouri Rani?s treatment.

 Gouri Rani?s family has decided to move the human rights commission. ?We will never get her back. Our objective is to ensure that there is some accountability in the healthcare system,? said Amitava Kar, her son in-law.

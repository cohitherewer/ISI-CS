The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?Everyone is not going to sit silent...?

From a conservative Hindu family of Rajasthan to one 

of the best-known names in Indian theatre, USHA GANGULY has come some distance. 

After Rangakarmees return from Theatre der Welt in Stuttgart, Germany, as 

the only Indian group to perform there, she spoke to Subhajoy Roy about 

the stage past and present, about politics, people and plays

 Usha Ganguly was felicitated by Bharatiya

Your early days in theatre were not happy?

I joined Sangeet Kala Mandir and my first play was 

Mrichchakatikam. I attended rehearsals regularly but didn?t get the satisfaction 

of doing theatre. I was a dancer and it needed a lot of discipline, but there 

was no such discipline in the group. Nobody took theatre seriously. They used 

to come late for the rehearsals and used to gossip a lot. They lacked the philosophy 

of working in theatre. So I was very disturbed but I knew this was the medium 

to communicate with people and send across a message. Then there was a clash between 

me and some other members.

There was the Mr Kejriwal incident?

Yes. I was made an executive member. I selected a 

play called Mr Abhimanyu but it was rejected by the committee because there 

was a character called Mr Kejriwal. Then there was a problem regarding another 

play too. By then, I had been introduced to some friends from Bengali theatre. 

So I thought I must have my own group and left Sangeet Kala Mandir. Thus, Rangakarmee 

was formed in January 1976.

You preferred Hindi over Bengali. What have been 

the merits and de-merits of working in Calcutta?

Hindi was my mother tongue, so I was more comfortable 

with it. Many people told me ?you will not be able to earn fame in Hindi, so shift 

to Bengali because it is so popular in Calcutta?. But I didn?t agree. In fact, 

the Calcutta audience is most inspiring. They have watched our plays. Our plays 

like Rudali, Holi, Sarhad Par Manto have done excellently. If the theatre 

language is correct and the message is well conveyed, the audience will come and 

love it, whatever be the language.

In the past three decades, has there been any change 

in the outlook of the audience?

(Pauses) Yes, there have been some changes. 

They have become very choosy. They know what they want to see. They will not waste 

time and money by watching anything else.

Between Mahabhoj (1984) and Rudali (1992) 

you acted only twice in the five plays staged. Any particular reason?

It helps every director to direct if he or she is 

not in the cast. But the actress in me was gradually getting lost and I was forced 

to cast myself in Rudali as there was no one suitable for this role.

What have been the five corner stones of your success 

story?

I will say it has been hard work, group feeling (which 

is very important if you want to be in group theatre), dedication, clear conception 

and clarity about what we are doing.

How much of Rangakarmee?s work has reflected politics 

through the years?

Governments might have changed but the plight of the 

common people has not changed much. Lack of education and child labour still exist, 

the youth are still not treated properly, women are still raped? Our productions 

reflect these things. We have no political bindings. We are the real political 

people, not those leaders who do politics, because we are politically conscious.

Has the intellectual class in Calcutta forgotten 

how to protest?

(Pauses, then bursts out) See, everyone is 

not going to sit silent. Someone will protest. It can?t go on like this. That?s 

why the women in Kanpur came out and took the law into their hands. It might not 

be right but they had no other way out. And why specify a single city and state? 

It happens in entire India?

Your thoughts on contemporary Bengali theatre?

In the past 10 years, Bengali theatre has improved 

immensely. The best thing is that many young directors who are really good have 

come up and they are drawing from their own roots. The trend to adapt Shakespeare, 

Brecht? has been overcome.

There has not been much adaptation of Tagore in 

Hindi. Do you have any plans?

There are very poor translations of Tagore in Hindi. 

But I?m reading Golpoguchcha regularly and I might adapt any of those short 

stories. 

How was Theatre der Welt?

It was a great experience. We have performed in Bangladesh, 

Pakistan, New Jersey and Los Angles. But this was a completely different experience. 

The audience was very interactive. We had three shows of Kashinama and 

after each show they asked questions. We also rendered theatre songs. There is 

a ritual in Germany that until the audience stops clapping you will have to go 

on. So, with a cast of 40, we had to go around the entire house twice or thrice. 

It was really funny.

What is the difference between their theatre and 

ours?

They are moving towards form and we are moving towards 

text. And also, the government does more for theatre in Germany.

On a personal note, what are the three best plays 

you have seen?

(A long pause) Manusher Adhikar by Utpal Babu, 

Charandas Chor by Habib Tanvir, Char Adhyay and Raktakarabi by 

Sombhu Babu and Badal Sircar, respectively.

And Rangakarmee?s best three?

Court Martial, Lok-Katha and Rudali.

Finally, your favourite theatre director?

Habib Tanvir.

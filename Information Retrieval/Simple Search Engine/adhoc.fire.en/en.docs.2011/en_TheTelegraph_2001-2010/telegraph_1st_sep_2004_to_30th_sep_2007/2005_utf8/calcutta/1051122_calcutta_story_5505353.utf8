 Mayor plea for deadline extension

 OUR BUREAU

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya on Monday said he might appear in the high court to pray for an extension of the November 30 deadline to evict squatters along Rabindra Sarobar.

 ?The state government is looking for land to rehabilitate the shanty-dwellers. If required, I will appear in the court on behalf of the state government and pray for an extension of the deadline fixed by the bench to complete the eviction drive,? the mayor said.

 On the other hand, the squatters at Gobindapur have already chalked out elaborate plans to put up a stiff fight in case an attempt is made to evict them.

 Baburam Pramanik, who has been living in the shanties since birth, said on Monday: ?The first wall the police will face is a chain formed by women and children. They will have to removed from the site for the police to proceed further.? 

 He said rehearsals were on and that the women and children were being trained for the ?ultimate assault?. He added: ?We obey the court, but we cannot accept this verdict.?

 However, another shanty-dweller, Ashok Pal, revealed a more aggressive strategy: ?Police will have to offer explanations on the number of bullets fired at us while trying to evict us, but if anyone amongst us uses firearms, he wouldn?t need to explain anything. Imagine how many lives would be lost then??

 Since November 11, groups of squatters have positioned themselves at nine round-the-clock dharna manchas, guarding the shanties between Dhakuria and Tollygunge railway stations.

 The squatters said that mayor Bhattacharya and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya had spoken to local MLA Sougata Roy recently and offered to provide alternative land in Sonarpur for rehabilitating the settlers. 

 ?But we want land close by, so that we can continue with the work we are engaged in,? Pramanik said.

 Assembly chief whip Rabin Deb said at Writers? Buildings: ?When land is located, the court will be informed about it. The refugee, rehabilitation and relief department has some land in Calcutta and on its outskirts, like Kamarhati, Sonarpur and Baruipur.? 

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, however, said that there was no scope of a review, since the court had passed the final order.

 Nasha notes, horror high

 Going underground post 10 at night is a new phenomenon, the trend having been triggered by Underground, the latest discotheque in town.

 The new haunt at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) is attracting party people by the hundreds, even on weekdays.

 Due to thin footfall, a weekday is not generally action time for a night club. But people have been coming here throughout the week. Underground has filled a void in the city where many youngsters cannot party because their spending power is low, says HHI managing director D.K. Jaiswal.

 On Saturday night, the disc on AJC Bose Road throbbed to the beats of DJ Nasha from Mumbai.

 I was not expecting the place to be full so early in the evening, you dont get to see this anywhere. This city is so full of life, said the DJ in between turning his tracks.

 The boy from Mumbai regaled the crowd with party numbers like Dhol vajda, Kangna, Bin tere sanam and Dus bahane.

 Spooky night

 Tantra celebrated a full-on Halloween weekend. Titled House of Horrors, the session that began with youngsters jamming, carried on all night long.

 With a graveyard set-up outside and a pitch-black feel inside, the only relief was provided by the ultra-violet lights that beamed back and forth.

 The bartenders too were dressed in all-black and wore bloody masks for that eerie effect. A skeleton here and a ghost there did further justice to the theme.

 Though we didnt really specify a dress code, it was quite a pleasure to see the guests come dressed in Halloween gear, says a spokesperson for The Park.

 The menu, too, was altered to suit the theme and not surprisingly, blood was the hottest flavour of the night!

 Special cocktails and snacks in true scary spirit were circulated by even scarier bartenders.

 With the tagline reading Formidable Fearsome Frightening, lets just say that the experience was pretty much all that was promised and some more.

 Hide haute

 Dolphin Leathers, the leather accessories store in Metro Plaza and City Centre, launched its winter collection on Saturday evening at Tollygunge Club with a fashion show. 

 The collection called Kudos has been conceived and designed by NIFT graduate Sreyoshi Mitra.

 The collection includes handbags, wallets, portfolios, laptop cases, leather jackets and other smaller accessories. 

 The Kudos handbags are made of international leather quality that adds extra softness and depth to leather goods. The trendy jackets are beautifully styled in original leather for both men and women. These are carefully tanned to retain the suppleness and richness through years of wear. With style, we have stressed durability also, said proprietor Imran Zaki.

 The winter accessories are priced between Rs 400 and Rs 4,000.

 Eviction set Nov. deadline

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Friday set, for the second time, a fresh list of dates to complete the eviction of squatters along Rabindra Sarobar.

 According to the fresh order issued by the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly, the eviction will begin on November 10 and by November 30, the drive will have to be completed. 

 The debris will have to be removed by December 7, when the railways will have to fence off the area with barbed wire.

 From September 10, both the railway authorities and the state government will make formal announcements asking the squatters to leave the spot by November 9.

 Significantly, Friday?s order did not mention the rehabilitation of squatters. It underscored the Supreme Court order of January 2003 asking for their ouster.

 ?We express our hope again that a political will is shown by all concerned to effect smooth and peaceful implementation of the court order,? the bench added.

 The court order added that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the CESC would help the government and the railways in conducting the eviction drive. 

 ?While the CMC will supply the bulldozers and other equipment for demolishing the structures, the CESC will help in disconnecting supply lines,? the order said.

 Detained for blast at Purulia

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) detained three persons, including a woman in her late 20s, on Thursday in connection with the landmine blast at Kantabora, in Purulia, and the killing of Nilmadhab Das, officer-in-charge of Bandwan police station, in October 2003.

 They were interrogated throughout the night at the investigating agency?s Bhabani Bhavan headquarters. 

 ?The three are believed to be active members of the CPI (Maoist), the banned Naxalite outfit. The evidences collected so far indicate their links with the blast and Das?s killing,? said a senior CID officer.

 Two of the youths, identified as Dipanjan Chakraborty and Soma, were picked up from their residences in Maniktala and Beleghata, respectively.

 On October 11, a landmine exploded under a jeep carrying policemen into Kantabora forest, injuring three constables. Das, who was in another jeep, got down and rushed to the aid of the injured. Maoist Communist Centre activists then opened fire on the cops, killing Das and injuring two constables.

 The CID was asked to conduct a probe into the case a few days ago. A special wing, headed by deputy inspector-general (operations) Rajeev Kumar and deputy superintendent of police, special operation group, Subhankar Chatterjee, was formed to monitor Naxalite activities across the state.

 ?The CPI (Maoist) city committee includes three districts ? Calcutta, North and South 24-Parganas. The arrested trio was assigned to convince more people from the city and its adjoining districts to join the outfit,? said a CID official.

 Another arrest, this time by West Midnapore police, was made of a suspected Naxalite, Prasun Chatterjee, in Garia.?We have booked him under the Arms Act,? said an officer.

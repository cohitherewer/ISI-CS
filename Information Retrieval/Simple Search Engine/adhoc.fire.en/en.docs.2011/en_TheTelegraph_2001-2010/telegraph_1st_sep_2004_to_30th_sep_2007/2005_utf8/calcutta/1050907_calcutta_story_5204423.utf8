 Escape chaos, tour pandals

 Today?s question: Will the new pandal rules rob Durga puja of its grandeur? More letters will be published next week

 No elbow room: The Ekdalia Evergreen puja

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake

 Rules and regulations cannot dampen the Bengali?s enthusiasm for the Puja. There is no reason to believe that injunctions in the public interest would take the lustre off the autumn extravaganza. Pandals blocking the streets almost totally are a familiar feature in the city. Many face problems due to this. Often, there isn?t enough space for even ambulances to squeeze through. The time has come to act tough against such pandals.

Sohini Roy, 

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue

 The new rules will certainly lead to loss of grandeur of the Puja. Several popular pujas block major portions of important thoroughfares. If the pandals are made smaller, they won?t remain as attractive. 

 Iindranil Sengupta, 

 Salt Lake

 I don?t think the rules would in any way affect the grandeur of the Puja. It is welcome that the administration has come up with ideas to make it a little easier for people to commute between pandals. In recent years, puja organisers had hardly paid a thought to the movement of pedestrians and traffic.

 Vinay Dokania,

 Shibpur 

 The rules for pandals will not affect the Puja grandeur at all. Instead, visiting pandals would become easier. It would also become possible for the crowds to be managed more effectively, thus making the entire experience more pleasurable. Even security issues can be addressed properly once the rules are implemented. The public needs to be pragmatic about the proposed changes.

 Satyanarayan Das, 

 Metiabruz

 The new pandal rules will rob the Puja of its grandeur and cause problems for the revellers. However, people should co-operate with the police to ensure that there are no problems during the annual event.

 Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan

 Imposing reasonable restrictions on the organisers is not tantamount to reduction in Puja grandeur. Rules and regulations are intended to ensure that no one is inconvenienced during the celebrations. Every year, Puja organisers erect pandals that encroach on roads, throwing traffic out of gear. Due to the absence of any rules, the Puja committees do not bother to repair the roads damaged in the process. 

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street 

 Durga puja is the most important festival of Bengal, but that does not give its organisers the licence to inconvenience the public. It is a well-known fact that organisers of most of the popular Pujas put up large pandals on the streets without sparing a thought for the pedestrians and the traffic. The new rules will only make the festival more enjoyable without taking away its grandeur.

 Tuli Das,

 Salt Lake

 The new rules will pave the way for a more disciplined Puja. They will in no way come in the way of the enjoyment.

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge

 The new pandal rules will jeopardise the charm associated with the Puja. The authorities need to remain sensitive to the needs of the puja organisers, which, of course, does not mean that the latter should be allowed to get away with whatever they want. Putting up blocks on thoroughfares must be prohibited. However, most of the rules put forward seem unfairly stringent.

poushali chakraborty,

 Sodepur

 The glamour and grandeur associated with the Puja will have to be curtailed to a certain extent if the new rules are implemented. As per the rules, banners cannot be put up within 50m of road intersections. Some puja committees would thus lose out on advertising money. There should be a rethink on the new laws to ensure that they do not come in the way of merrymaking.

 Vinita Surana, 

 Camac Street

 No way. Pleasure is heightened if the celebrations are kept within limits. The coming Puja will be more peaceful and pleasant if the new rules are enforced.

 Payel Bhattacharya,

 Joka

 The new rules will make the Puja more enjoyable. The autumn event has become irritating for many citizens because of the lack of civic sense of the puja organisers. It remains to be seen whether the rules are strictly enforced. Otherwise, the situation would remain much the same.

 Payal Srivastava,

 Howrah

 The Puja festive spirit cannot be marred by a few rules. The proscriptions would only protect the people and lead to the betterment of the city.

 Swarnali Biswas,

 Beleghata

 I do not think the new pandal rules will in any way de-glamorise the Puja. In fact, they will lead to more enjoyable experience for the Pujas are not just about building the grandest pandal.

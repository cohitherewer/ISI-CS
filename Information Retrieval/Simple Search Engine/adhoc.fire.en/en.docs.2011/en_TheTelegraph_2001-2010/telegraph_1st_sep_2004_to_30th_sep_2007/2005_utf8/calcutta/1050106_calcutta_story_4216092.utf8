 Letters

Another year has passed by, bringing along 

its share of news good and bad, information useful and meaningless, developments 

welcome and woeful... 

Through the year, you have wielded the pen 

in anguish and ecstasy, hope and despair, spurring us ahead on the news trail. 

This recap of 2004 is a toast to you, the reader...

January 

Hike in liquor licence fee: 

A hike from Rs 10,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh will definitely force a re-think before people 

apply for a liquor shop or a bar licence (Giant leap for liquor licence fee, Jan. 

15). Though this may bring down the count of liquor shops and bars, this is not 

enough to erase alcoholism. 

Kunal Ray, 

Santragachhi. 

TTIS trip to Pakistan: These 

kids are better ambassadors than Vajpayee or Musharraf can ever be (Peace quest 

begets friendship fest, Jan. 19). 

Bhupen Bose,

Dum Dum Park.

February 

Abolition of HS merit list: 

I think students will lose interest in studies as there will be no 

scope for healthy competition (HS drops marks tally, Feb. 2). Will it not be funny 

if athletes are not declared winners and runners-up? 

Moumita Roy, 

Bally, Hooghly. 

Man in rags controls unmanned 

crossing: When so many trained traffic personnel are being paid to 

manage the traffic, a young man in rags has to rescue an important crossing, like 

the AJC Bose Road-Elliot Road junction, from chaos (Salute, conscientious constable, 

Feb. 17). Do the police expect such good samaritans to ?report for duty? whenever 

the men paid for the job take a break? 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road.

March

Evicted father in court: 

Eviction of old parents from their own house by son and daughter-in-law 

is now shamefully common (Ousted father gets son evicted, March 4). We want a 

national policy so that senior citizens can spend their last days peacefully. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

Beleghata. 

Factory guards lynch intruder: 

The report ?Factory guards lynch intruder? (March 22) was a disturbing 

read. How can private security guards take law in their hands? This is happening 

due to less importance given to the khaki force. 

T.R. Anand, 

Budge Budge.

April 

Woman molested at station: 

 We cannot afford a police force large enough to fight goons in every 

alley (Oasis of peace, station of terror, April 21). What were the onlookers doing 

when the goons were trying to molest the woman on the platform at Hridaypur? 

Shameek Bose, 

Address not given. 

Unruly leader let off: It 

is dreadful how, despite violating traffic rules and manhandling a constable, 

former Trinamul Congress MLA Sanjay Bakshi has been let off scot-free (Hostile 

leader, upright cop, April 14). This proves that politicians have elevated themselves 

above the law. 

Kajal Chatterjee, 

Sodepur. 

 Honest ragpicker refuses 

bounty: Why does the president of Time and Talent, Roma Bhagat, not 

help those who really need it and would appreciate it? (Ragpicker roots for freedom 

of footpath, April 24). She could, for instance, help the police officer who also 

found a bag with money and returned it to the owner. If the ragpicker does not 

want help, just leave her alone. 

Ramesh Daswani, 

Address not given. 

May

Green cover drive: For 

a few days during the forestry week in July, our officials work overtime, distributing 

saplings and planting a few themselves (Foolproof plan for afforestation monitor, 

May 15). No care is taken of the plants. The forest department should be ashamed. 

Madhabi D. Ghosh, 

Salt Lake. 

Band sues film for plagiarisation: 

The article ?Band cries Murder over tune lift?, May 20, failed 

to shock us since Anu Malik, the music director of the film, is reportedly more 

famous for his cheated scores than original ones. 

Kunal Ray, 

Santragachhi. 

Dasgupta razed: Dasgupta 

 amp; Co was not only the best bookshop in the city, it was a pilgrimage for booklovers 

(118 yrs razed in an hour, May 31). 

Anil Kumar Sen, 

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.

June 

Five trekkers die: The 

tragic end of five members of an expedition team came as a shock, more so as the 

mishap occurred in a year when the first Bengali set foot on Everest (Kasba mourns 

its felled constable, June 12). 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

Nadia. 

Censor chop on Hothat 

Neerar Jonyo: For heaven?s sake, let the viewer decide what he 

wants to see. (Sudden scissorhands slap for Neera, June 29). 

Kalyan Ghosh, 

Park Street.

July

Pregnant woman slapped in 

hospital: It is terrible how a pregnant woman was slapped to induce 

labour (Merchants of pain, not relief, July 7). Such barbaric practices belong 

to medieval times and not the 21st century when medical science has made such 

progress. 

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

Bandpur. 

Dumped new-born pecked by 

crows: The residents of Dum Dum witnessed, without a trace of guilt, 

the grisly scene of a new-born baby, dumped in a canal, being eaten by crows (Battered, 

bruised, dumped in a bag, July 9). Where goes our good sense when such incidents 

happen in broad daylight? 

Chandan Ray, 

Sarsuna. 

Mayor?s orchard scheme: Orchards 

on roads will attract ruffians who will pelt stones at trees to get hold of ripe 

fruits (Roadside orchards to woo back 

 birds, July 20). The plan might lead to accidents when children, lured by fruits, would run on the carriageway. Instead, saplings could be distributed among interested people at a nominal cost. 

A.F. K. Ahmed, 

Collin Lane. 

Food for astronauts: Apropos 

the report ?City boy helps dish out space menu?, July 22, we should be proud that 

Supratim Ghosh, an ex-student of Calcutta University, has discovered a special 

vegetable space menu for NASA. Kudos to him and his team in Pennsylvania. 

B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum Park.

August

Fourth anti-jaywalking campaign 

launched: I was fined on an occasion when the constable allowed the 

traffic to pass even when pedestrians were crossing the road (Rs 10 for jaywalk, 

900 pay, August 4). This compelled us to run helter-skelter to save our lives. 

Then we were accused of jaywalking! 

S.K. Limaye, 

Baker Road. 

Entry fee at Victoria Memorial: 

The question is whether the entry fee will only facilitate infiltration 

by mobile-toting affluent men and women, who are more often than not habitual 

offenders and couples with dubious intentions (Walk the greens for a fee, August 

11). 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road. 

Old vehicle phase-out postponed: 

Apropos ?U-turn over vehicles phase-out?, August 17, it is alarming 

how the government has succumbed to the pressures of transport lobbies. 

Rabindranath Kar, 

Sankar Ghosh Lane.

September

Poultry trade figures show 

escalating consumption: In the near future, a time might come when 

Calcuttans will cease to be known as a race fond of fish (Fowl wings into fish 

den, Sept. 4). 

T.R. Anand, 

Budge Budge. 

Award announced for honest 

cops: Aren?t all policemen expected to be honest and sincere in the 

first place? (Lalbazar laurels for its honest men, Sept. 9). 

K. Asokan, 

Salkia.

October

Hangman appeals to CM to 

ban jatras on rapist: It is ridiculous how operas in Chitpur 

are out to stage jatras based on the rapist (Dhananjoy Chatterjee) and his hangman?s 

lives (Spotlight glare scares hangman, Oct. 2). Let us allow the episode to die 

down. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

Majdia, Nadia. 

Contest for dhakis: 

Till this year, the dhakis were never given their due credit. 

(All sticks on the dhaak for puja talent hunts, Oct. 7). 

Sourish Misra, 

Salt Lake. 

November

Supreme Court restricts NRI 

medical seat quota: So long as the Joint Entrance Examination is there, 

admission to the course must be strictly on the basis of performance in the exam 

(NRI seats fixed at 15 per cent, Nov. 6). Reservation upto 15 per cent is quite 

justified though. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala. 

SUCI calls bandh: The 

sermons by the CPM trio Anil-Biman-Subhas hitting out at the SUCI-sponsored bandh 

reminds one of the saying, ?When man kills tiger it is sport, but when tiger kills 

man it is ferocity? (One-day match hitch, Nov. 17). Will they remember all this 

when Alimuddin Street calls a bandh? 

Santosh Chakravarty,

Unique Park.

Star theatre renovation bill 

is Rs 15.5 crore: If promotion of art and culture is an offence until 

all citizens are provided with basic amenities, then the Centre should be lambasted 

for spending millions for the maintenance of Taj Mahal, instead of helping out 

the poor (Star stumbles in glory trek, Nov. 23). We should be grateful to the 

Corporation for renovating Star theatre. 

Kajal Chatterjee, 

Sodepur. 

December 

Schools switch to ICSE Board: 

The HS Board is still clutching on to old ideas (Shift blues for HS 

Board, Dec. 8). 

Debaprasad Mukherjee,

Nayapatty Road.

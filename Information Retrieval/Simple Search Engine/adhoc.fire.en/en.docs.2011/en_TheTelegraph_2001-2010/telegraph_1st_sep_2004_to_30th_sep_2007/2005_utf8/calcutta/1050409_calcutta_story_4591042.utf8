 Canvas life to twin edifices

 - Self-taught artist reproduces governor house amp; Rashtrapati Bhavan

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Swaroop Mukerji with President Kalam at Rashtrapati Bhavan

 The president?s bodyguards in their ornate finery perched atop those regal horses, the splendid Ashokan lion sitting majestically in the sweeping hallway or the tranquil terraces of the governor?s house back home. Deft brushstrokes and vivid 

 hues have united two magnificent colonial edifices on the same canvas, Raj Bhavan in Calcutta and Rashtrapati Bhavan in the capital.

 Self-taught painter Swaroop Mukerji, often referred to as a ?street artist? who prefers to start and finish every piece of work on location, juxtaposing the magnificent with the mundane, has given these two imposing structures a different dimension through his twin series in mixed media, pen-and-ink and conte.

 ?I always felt Raj Bhavan is a great colonial monument with very limited exposure,? says the artist, who worked for six months on campus in 2002-03 during Viren J. Shah?s tenure to do 24 pieces on the governor?s house, which were later put up at the Bowrings auction. Mukerji then wrote to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, expressing his willingness to paint Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 After winning a yearlong battle with cancer, the 55-year-old city-based painter?s dream was realised late last year when he was invited by the President and did 41 paintings and drawings during his stay. The historical link in both the buildings and their distinctive characters fascinate the artist.

 ?While the governor?s house is purely colonial in structure and more serene and feminine, Rashtrapati Bhavan is a blend of colonial, Mughal and Rajputana architectural vocabulary, exuding an aura of masculine vigour,? Mukerji observes.

 His stress in the two series is not just on capturing the architecture, though. ?I have also tried to delineate the human elements and the flora and fauna inextricably linked to the structures. For instance, the Prez?s butlers and bodyguards or the backroom boys in the governor?s entourage.?

 Mukerji, who has exhibited in landmark venues like the Nehru Center, Indian high commission in London, the World Bank and The Milan Festival in The Hague, ranks his private exposition for President Kalam and his kin and colleagues in the Ashoka Hall as the ?most significant and satisfying? till date.

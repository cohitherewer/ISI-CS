Chit Ch@t

The law and I 

Once I flew on the wings of time 

Along a winding path in the lane of life 

The blissful beauty around engulfed my soul 

A moment that seemed like a poets ode 

I walked ahead, the path unknown 

And saw a solitary figure in a dark robe 

Curious but hesitant, I asked: What?s your name? 

You look so content, yet so alone 

Law, he smiled, that?s how I am known

I have devised how actions must be; 

What you should do and what must not be 

I have layed down all the rules of life 

Drape it around and you will survive 

Casting a blinding gaze at me thus, he turned to walk 

But this was my only chance and I knew I had to talk 

Law, I called back, we might never meet again 

So today you must answer as I question 

Tell me what is the law of a dream? 

The rules you lay for the feelings within 

What shall I do to celebrate mirth? 

What is the law for a broken heart? 

Which law will let me hold my love tight? 

What do I do on a sleepless night? 

Then Law looked at me; the wind made a sigh 

The blinding gaze gone, a tear in his eye 

You ask me of love Lady, with it even I am in awe 

Everybody fears or blames; but nobody loves Law

Ammonites

Here I am washed out of the sea,

You?d understand what it?s like

If only you were me

I saw the ammonite on the beach?s bay,

It was gleaming with light, 

Like a star at night,

On the wonderful beach?s bay.

?Oh! Ammonite, Ammonite, gleaming on the bay,

You look so beautiful twinkling today

Oh! Ammonite, Ammonite gleaming on the bay,

You look like a flower curled up on a rock,

On the wonderful beach?s bay.?

Cossilised for 1,000,000 years,

Covered in soil and sand,

Crunched up on the hard stony land.

And here I am, right here today,

But 1,000,000 years ago you were a creature,

At the wonderful beach?s bay.

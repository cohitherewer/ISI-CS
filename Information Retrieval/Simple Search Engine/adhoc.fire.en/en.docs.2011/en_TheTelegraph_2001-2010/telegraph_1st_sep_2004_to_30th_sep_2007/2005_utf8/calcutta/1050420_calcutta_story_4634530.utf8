Pather Panchali (1955)

Director Satyajit Ray

Cast Karuna Banerjee, Kanu Banerjee, Uma Dasgupta, Subir Banerjee

Plot Based on Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay?s novel about a poor family struggling 

to survive, the film looks at tragedy through the eyes of young Apu.

 The film was funded by the West Bengal Roads 

and Buildings Department in the hope that The Song of the Road would be 

a promotional documentary for the roads of the state!

 Time magazine described the film as 

the finest piece of filmed folklore since the ?father of documentary? Robert Flaherty?s 

Nanook of the North.

 When Ray ran into financial trouble during 

the making, and was even contemplating giving up the project, it was singer-actor-director 

Kishore Kumar who helped him out with Rs 5,000, getting Pather Panchali 

back on the road.

 After watching the film, celebrated exponent 

of French New Wave Cinema, Francois Truffaut said: ?I don?t want to see a movie 

of peasants eating with their hands.?

 The one film which moved Ray the most before 

he started scripting Pather Panchali was Italian Neorealist film-maker 

Vittorio De Sica?s Bicycle Thief, which he reportedly saw 55 times.

 In its 1992 poll of the 10 Greatest Films of 

All Time, the British Film Institute?s Sight And Sound magazine rated Pather 

Panchali at number six in the list alongside the likes of Citizen Kane 

and The Godfather.

Monster (2003) 

Director Patty Jenkins

Cast Charlize Theron, Christina Ricci

Plot The film is based on the true life story of Aileen Carol Wuornos, 

a highway prostitute who was executed for killing seven men in the state of Florida 

during the 1980s. Theron plays Wuornos while Ricci her lover Selby.

 In pre-production, director Jenkins and Wuornos 

were writing to each other for around eight months. The night before her execution, 

Wuornos had her best friend open up the archive of every letter they wrote to 

each other in 12 years for the film.

 To look like Wuornos, Charlize gained 30 pounds, 

sported false teeth and age spots, and also used a special gel to get those droopy 

eyes.

 Charlize won the Best Actress Oscar for her 

Monster role on 29 February, which happened to be Wuornos?s birthday.

 The credits list the Chemical Brothers track 

in the film as Come with us but in actuality it is Where do I begin, 

with Beth Orton singing it.

 Charlize?s power-packed performance in The 

Devil?s Advocate of a woman driven mad made Jenkins cast her in the role of 

Wuornos in Monster.

 For the role of Selby, Brittany Murphy and 

Kate Beckinsale were considered before it went to Ricci.

 Apart from Jenkins?s film, two other films, 

both documentaries, were made on Wuornos by Nick Broomfield. The 1992 film was 

called Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, while the second 

part in 2003 was titled Wuornos, Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer.

 Rules to reduce wedding worries 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, people belonging to the animal sign ram are weak water persons who need strength and nourishment from the metal element. The earth element represents marriage for them. Since in the next year earth will be in power, it rsquo;s a good year for such people to get married

Q: I am a regular reader of your column and I want your suggestion regarding my marriage prospects. My date of birth is 20.01.1980 and the time is 11.40 pm. My animal sign is monkey and the kua number is 4. My parents are looking for a suitable groom for me, but have not been successful till now. My bedroom is in the north-west of the house. I have displayed a picture of peony flowers and another one of a pair of mandarin ducks in the south-west corner of the room. I have also placed a purified crystal in the north-west of my room. But none of these seem to be helping in finding a match for me. I am very depressed and need your advice on what measures to take so that I find a life partner soon.

 The solution: Your animal sign is ram and not monkey because you were born before the Chinese New Year, which began on February 2 in 1980. So you go back into the previous year where the animal sign is ram and the kua number is 3.

 According to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak water person who needs strength and nourishment from the metal element. You have entered into this supportive period from this year.

 Next year the elements that are coming in power are fire over earth. Earth that represents marriage for you will get plenty of nourishment from the fire element next year to get the wedding bells ringing for you. 

 In the meantime, remove the peony flowers from the south-west corner as their wood energy drains away your water energy. Instead, place an earthen figurine of a couple that suggests the vital earth element in the marriage corner on a red mat and light a pair of pink candles in crystal candle stands every evening.

 Strengthen the earth element and its associated colours, which directly represent marriage for you, in your bedroom. Remember to remove any art in the home that depicts a solitary woman. If your bedroom has too much of feminine energy, then lighten up the environment and get a little masculine or couple vibes going instead.

 Match making

 Q: My DOB is 05.03.1973 and the time is 6.45 pm. My family is really worried about my marriage prospects since I am physically challenged. Please suggest the kind of woman I should look for, who will be compatible with me according to Feng Shui. Please mention the animal sign, element and age that will match with mine. Also suggest when I should get married.

 Sumanta Nundun

 The solution: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak metal person and need lot of nourishment from the earth element. Fortunately, next year is approaching with abundance of earth element. It will be a lucky year for you in respect of marriage. It will strengthen your weak self metal and you will be able to capture your spouse element that is wood. 

 Look for a partner who has plenty of earth and metal elements that can fulfil your requirements in future. Girls with the animal sign rat and ox make compatible partners. Avoid getting into a relationship with somebody who belongs to the ram sign. 

 Activate your personal marriage direction ? south-east ? with marriage-related objects. 

 Cut chaos

 Q: We have recently moved into a house that has a garden on all the four sides. There is a large cut in the south-east of the house. I am a regular reader of your column and understand that a cut corner in the south-east could affect our financial situation. Please suggest some powerful remedies.

 Anuradha Sethia

 The solution: Its always wise to balance any part of the house that has a cut, no matter what direction it falls in. A large cut in the south-east, which is connected with wealth, can affect your flow of cash and prosperity in future. 

 Sprinkle silver or regular coins in the south-east void of the garden, cover with soil and give an impression of completeness by creating flower beds around it. You must anchor the meeting point with a fruit tree or a bird bath. Illuminate this area with green lights hidden under the flower beds.

 Number notes

 Q: We are planning to buy a new car very soon. Does Feng Shui suggest some auspicious numbers that we can choose for our new vehicle? 

 Sarita Kejriwal

 The solution: The vibrational frequencies of certain numbers have greater power than others. In Feng Shui, individual numbers 7, 8 or 9 or numbers adding up to 7, 8 or 9 are considered auspicious. 

 Out of these, according to the Flying Stars 7 is a past number and does not carry much energy in the present age. Eight is the number of the current age that will continue to be lucky till 2024. 

 The number 9 has a special place in Feng Shui as it represents completeness and is uniquely auspicious. Any multiple of nine will always sum up to the number nine. For example, the resulting numbers 18, 27, 36, 45,81 and 99 all individually add up to nine. So it is advisable to go for the digit nine, which will give you prosperity and luck throughout your life.

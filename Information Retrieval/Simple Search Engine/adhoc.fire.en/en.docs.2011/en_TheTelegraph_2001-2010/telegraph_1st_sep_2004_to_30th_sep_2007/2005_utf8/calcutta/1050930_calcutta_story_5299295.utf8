The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Evicted win a roof over heads

 - Nonadanga housing estate receives displaced people

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sudhansu Das and his wife Bhakti will not forget the night of September 12, 2004, in a hurry. Their family of seven was evicted by the police from their house in Hatgachia, near Dhapa, on that night. 

 This September, a year later, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee gave the family the keys to their new home ? a flat at Nonadanga, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital.

 ?The apartment we have been given is too small for the seven of us, but we are happy to finally get a home,? said Das on Wednesday.

 ?A huge team of police had forced us to vacate our house amid heavy rain. My husband had purchased the plot at Hatgachia in 1984 and subsequently, built a house there. We had to move to enable the government to pursue some development project,? Bhakti recounted. ?I thought the government had taken away the roof over our heads for good,? she added.

 Raja Mandal and his wife Sangita were evicted from their house on Prince Anwar Shah Road six months ago to allow construction of a connecting road to the Lake Gardens flyover. Like the Dases, they received the keys to their new home at Nonadanga from the chief minister on September 16.

 Bhattacharjee looked pleased as he handed over the keys to the families evicted from different parts of the city to enable the government to carry out development projects. ?I am really happy to give you the keys. Even I live in a flat that is only slightly bigger than yours. These flats are good and I feel that you will be able to live here peacefully,? the chief minister told the gathering.

 About 100 families were evicted from Bondel Gate to construct the flyover there. Fifteen families lost their homes on Prince Anwar Shah Road as the government needed the land to build the Lake Gardens flyover. Over 150 families were moved from the Bypass to cull land for the Trade Fair Complex. 

 The state government, with financial assistance from the Centre, has built 448 flats at Nonadanga to rehabilitate the evicted families. ?We want to create a city without slums. We know it is a difficult job, but there is no harm in making a serious attempt,? Bhattacharjee had said during the inauguration of the complex.

 Ramprasad Haldar, an oustee who has been given a flat at Nonadanga, alleged that there is no electricity and water connection in the new housing estate. A Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) official assured him that everything would be in place once all the evicted families were allotted flats. 

 Each flat, measuring 219 sq ft, has been priced at Rs 44,000. The evicted families will have to pay an advance of Rs 15,000. The rest of the money has to be paid in two instalments.

 The CMDA is in the process of constructing another 1,742 one-bedroom, self-contained flats for the evicted families. They will be distributed among the homeless in phases.

 Dowry torture stink in girl?s suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Twenty-year-old Ananya Mondal was married to a Budge Budge businessman in February. On Thursday, she was found hanging from the ceiling of her bedroom, with marks of torture all over her body.

 Ananya had to die because her father was unable to meet his son-in-law?s demand and allegedly fell short by Rs 8,000. 

 Police are on the lookout for the husband and father-in-law, whose names have been mentioned in the FIR filed by the victim?s brother.

 Ananya, the only daughter of Atul Mondal of Sarsuna, in Behala, was married to Sanat Naskar of Mithapukur, in Budge Budge, after negotiation between the families. Sanat runs a fast-food business from a mobile van.

 Atul, who has a hardware shop in the local market, gifted gold ornaments and furniture, in addition to Rs 50,000 in cash, to the couple.

 The first month after the marriage was peaceful. The torture allegedly started from the second month. 

 Sanat and his father Dulal Naskar wanted a motorcycle and Rs 50,000, said Ananya?s family members. 

 Ananya?s brother Aloke told police that she had repeatedly explained to her in-laws that it was quite difficult for her father to obtain so much money and buy a motorcycle, but they did not pay any heed to her words.

 Sanat and his family members would torture her at the slightest excuse and even kept her without food for days together, Aloke said.

 He added: ?When Ananya visited our house on Poila Baisakh, my mother was horrified to see several wounds and scars on her body. My father tried to resolve the matter by gifting the motorcycle. Ananya was spared for a while, but the torture started soon after, this time for Rs 50,000.?

 After some days, Atul paid Sanat Rs 42,000. ?My father sold my mother?s ornaments to raise the money. He had planned to pay the balance in a month?s time,? Aloke explained.

 About 3.30 on Thursday morning, the Mondals received a call asking them to reach Budge Budge as Ananya was not well. 

 On reaching her house, Atul and Aloke found her hanging from the ceiling. The house was deserted.

 The body was brought down with the help of neighbours and subsequently, a complaint was lodged at Budge Budge police station. Adjacent police stations have been alerted about the absconding father-son duo.

 Airtel subscribers in south Calcutta will now connect better, thanks to a state-of-the-art relationship centre in Gol Park.

 The centre will offer service for query resolution, roaming activation, bill payments and any other problem that crops up for Airtel customers. 

 ?Being highly interactive, customers are assured a solution to every problem,? claimed a spokesperson for the second largest service provider to the city.

 Nishijapon actors Raima Sen and Parambrata Chatterjee dropped by to do the ribbon act. ?With technological advancement, there are going to be faults and solving these in a friendly environment is the ideal solution,? mouthed Raima, in a green salwar kameez.

 The actors? presence was justified better as Airtel also introduced its Nishijapon contest by announcing that the winner would be given the chance to have dinner with certain members of the film family ? Raima, Parambrata and Sabyasachi Chakraborty.

 Now that?s food for thought, especially if you want to dwell on the nuances of inner turbulence that Sandip Ray explores through the film set against the backdrop of a natural disaster.

 Chikan chic

 Expanding on the elegant art of chikankari, Nisha Beri is showing off a range of innovative summerwear at an exhibition at Moksh on April 19 and 20.

 Beri uses a combination of chikan work, laces, sequins and mukaish work to create intricate patterns on cottons and georgettes. She sticks to a cool palette of whites and pastels for daywear but uses darker shades to brighten up her eveningwear collection comprising salwar suits, saris and heavy lehngas. 

 Kebab binge

 The aroma of roasted meat welcomes you as soon as you step inside D?Fire Ice at 52A Sarat Bose Road. 

 The eatery that has become a pioneer of sorts in North Indian cuisine, is hosting a tandoori food festival to reclaim its position as a quality stop for kebabs and tandoori items. 

 Some of the mouth-watering items one can dig into are Shami Kebabs, Chicken Haryali Kebabs, Murg Dahi Bahar and Chicken Kadai.

 While mutton maniacs can dig into Hara Bhara Kebabs and Mutton Bada Kebabs, there is Fish Maharani for the fish lovers.

 And the vegetarians can find solace in Paneer Shabnam Bahar, Crispy Bhindi and Aloo Hyderabadi.

 The pocket pinch can be between Rs 60 and Rs 140. The festival continues till April 23.

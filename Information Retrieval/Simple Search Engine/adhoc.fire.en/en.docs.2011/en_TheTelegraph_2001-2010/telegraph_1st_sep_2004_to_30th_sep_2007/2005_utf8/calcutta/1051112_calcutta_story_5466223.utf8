 Students of the arts faculty are organising for themselves what they say are largely denied to them ? jobs. Under the umbrella of the non-political Forum for Arts Students, they are approaching companies to come and hold campus interviews. Their initiative bears fruit from November 19 to 22, when Google.com, Wipro Spectramind and some TV channels land on campus.

 ?Engineering students have a job in the pocket when they walk out of JU, thanks to on-campus recruitment. But nothing happens for us. So, we thought of taking things in our hands,? says Abhishek Mukherjee, a PG II student of international relations, adding that talks are on with banks and call centres, too.

 The organisers are busy spreading the word through posters and class campaigns, and compiling CVs for the interviews. ?The few companies which express interest in us come through personal contacts of our teachers. Even then, these are restricted to the English, economics and comparative literature departments. The other departments of the arts faculty are rarely in the picture,? says Nibedita Sen, who had to chalk out the components of a CV on the blackboard to make many prepare one. ?Their self-esteem is at such a low that they find it hard to believe that companies are interested in them.?

 Next up is a job fair, on November 26-27. Here, a student interface takes place with the companies, followed by a seminar on career prospects for humanities students. 

 Lending an arm is the Alumni Association, which is holding pre-interview workshops and allowing students to use its premises. ?We plan to tap our members in various firms and keep the process going,? says secretary Asit Pal.

 JU?s placement officer Siddhartha Bhattacharyya points to lack of opportunities in arts compared to engineering. ?If a company seeks arts students, we forward the communication to the dean of arts. It is not possible for us to contact the students individually. Their response to these offers is also not encouraging,? he says, admitting that there is scope to structure the process.

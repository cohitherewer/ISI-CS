 It was a beehive of activity all through Monday at the 43rd Travel and Tourism Fair in Calcutta, the final day of the expo at Netaji Indoor Stadium. Till afternoon, over 25,000 general visitors and 800-plus trade visitors had poured in at the event. The expectations were of ?at least 30,000? by the end of the three-day fair.

 The response from the participants was mixed. The main complaint was that with the delayed dates (due to the renovation of the stadium), most tourists had already done their Puja bookings. ?So, a lot of them are here just to pick up brochures,? said Mandip Singh of Gainwell Travel and Leisure.

 But the flip side is that there were several queries for the winter vacations, added Jharna Bose Singh of Modcons Tours and Travels. And, as always, domestic destinations scored over international, buoyed by the budget-traveller category.

 ?A tussle between terrorism and tourism has become a theme focal in the worldwide tourism industry today,? said Sanjiv Agarwal, chairman and managing director, Fairfest Media, organisers of the fair. 

 But for most tour operators and travel agencies, terrorism is taking a back seat. Case in point ? Nepal and Jammu and Kashmir are firmly back on the tourism map, while Help Tourism won a special award at the fair for their terrorism rehabilitation through tourism project at Manas National Park.

 Innovation and new destinations are other emerging trends, like the ?sold-out? forest camp near Jaldapara, offered by Modcons, another award-winner for ?promising new destination? in the national segment. ?Eco tourism is becoming very popular, among all types of tourists,? clarified Jharna Bose.

 Other new forms of tourism being developed in states like Karnataka, Uttaranchal and Rajasthan include rural or village tourism, festivals, camps, adventure, spiritual (yoga and meditation), religious (pilgrimage circuits), health and even film tourism. While Uttaranchal is spending up to Rs 80 crore to develop the sector, Rajasthan has a budget of over Rs 1,000 crore on various projects, including infrastructure.

 The fair was also a symbol of the private-public partnership being promoted by the states, with the state tourism boards? stalls housing travel agents offering special packages. 

 Even the country tourism boards, like Malaysia and Singapore, had city agents showcasing their wares. In fact, Gainwell had no stall of its own this time, but was represented in several different stalls, including Sri Lanka and Nepal.

 The same is reflected in the initiatives taken by the states. Several tourism ministers were in town ? Lt.-Gen. (retd) T.P.S. Rawat from Uttaranchal, Jugal Kishor from Jammu and Kashmir, R.B. Subba from Sikkim and Usha Punia from Rajasthan ? talking about sops and new ventures, wooing investors, travel agents and tourists.

 ?There?s a turnaround in the tourism industry, and things are definitely changing,? signed off Agarwal of Fairfest. And with over 200 participants, including 10 countries and 21 states, the future for tourism from this part of the world looks bright.

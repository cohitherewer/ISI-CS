Life

 Of musical snapshots

The harmonica concert treated listeners 

to a rich and varied collage of rhythms, says musician Nondon Bagchi

The harmonica can be one of the most moving, versatile and evocative instruments. It was evident from the first notes of Ode to Billie Joe rendered by the Jean Jacques Milteau quartet on Tuesday evening that this instrument was in the very best hands, that the musicians knew exactly where they were coming from, that they were steeped in their genre of music and that we were in for an evening of uninhibited communication.

 The quartet was Milteau on harmonicas, Manuel Galvin on guitar, Gilles Michel on bass and Eric Lafont on drums.

 During the evening we were treated to a rich and varied collage. Typical rhythm and blues in brisk shuffle time with high-energy solos that evoked images of a foot-stomping party. Or shades of Latin American music with Lafont playing on the snare drum rim, the cymbal cup and tom toms. And then a haunting ballad with a slow, soft rock feel or just a slight touch of funk and jazz progressions in another one.

 In keeping with their down-to-earth, informal approach, Milteau did not say much and we did not get to know the title of every piece but one particular tune was introduced as having found a place in recording history because it was the first boogie-woogie ever recorded, in 1928.

 The quartets rendition was strong and robust, a fastish shuffle, and there were many phrases and stabs played in unison with pinpoint precision and perfection, which in fact was a feature of many of their pieces, especially some of the endings, that left the audience breathless.

 Though the quartet must be properly described as a blues band, and blues (The DNA of jazz, someone said) is far more flexible and all-encompassing than many believe, there were times when they deviated completely.

 Milteau has travelled far and wide, and while describing the harmonica as an ideal companion for a traveller (with a humorous look over his shoulder at the drummer), he said he had picked up many musical snapshots over the years and this was clear in some of the pieces they played.

 One took us back to the seaside in his native France and this was completely European in flavour, evoking pictures of groups of people dancing to set pieces, sunny and carefree in mood.

 Another, dedicated to his parents, was a waltz, again very European. Yet another snapshot was inspired by his travels in South Africa ? lively, sunny and energetic with his melody line capturing the essence of the style.

 Only one piece was a slow 6/8 blues ? the mood of being in a bar in the early hours of the morning after a long night well brought out.

 Manuel Galvins guitar ? amplified acoustic guitar ? was the other main voice of the band, with some brilliant solos and interludes where he was highlighted. Also a virtuoso musician, he added character, charm, emotion and humour to the concert without ever disturbing the identity of a piece and going off on a tangent of his own.

 The unity of the musicians contribution was notable. Gilles Michel, who played a fretless, hollow-body electric bass had a mellow tone and flowed smoothly with the music and took a couple of mature, lyrical solos and Eric Lafont also fitted in like a piece in a jigsaw; the two solos he took were both in tempo, both following the structure of the piece down to the number of bars in each cycle, and yet within that discipline was able to incorporate an amazing array of rhythmic figures.

 The last piece and then the encore were both high-energy, up-tempo pieces, and Milteau, well warmed up by then, really showed his technical brilliance, breathing control and all.

 The encore reminded me of Sha Na Nas Lets Go To The Hop. Through the evening, with his different harmonicas going from soprano to baritone with effortless ease, Milteau showed that stories can be told without a word being spoken.

 Early this year The French Association had brought in a rock band called Louis Attacque and they chose an unusual open-air venue ? a street in the Bow Barracks, and it turned out to be a good idea.

 On Tuesday, the suitably intimate Kala Kunj (basement of Kala Mandir) was the venue and the audience was rocking. The Association is clearly making a statement about the right ingredients for good musical events. Not social ones.

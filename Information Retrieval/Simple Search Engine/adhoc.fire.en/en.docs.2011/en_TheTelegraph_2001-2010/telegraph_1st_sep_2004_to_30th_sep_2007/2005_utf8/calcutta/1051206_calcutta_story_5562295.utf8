The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 IT realtor eyes more acres

 - 400,000 sq ft office space ready by 2007 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ascendas, Asia?s leading provider of business space solutions, has sought more land in Calcutta from the state government, besides the 20-acre plot it is developing in Rajarhat.

 Chong Siak Ching, president and CEO of the company, called on the chief minister at Writers? Buildings on Monday. ?We apprised and updated him on the progress of the IT park we are developing,? said Harminder Singh, senior vice-president of Ascendas India. 

 ?We also discussed the possibility of being allotted some more space. We?d be happy if it?s adjacent to the plot we are working on in Rajarhat.?

 According to government officials, the company wants to develop the park into a special economic zone. The chief minister asked Ching to table a formal proposal in this regard.

 Ascendas officials also pointed out the unavailability of public transport in Rajarhat to Bhattacharjee. ?The chief minister said he would take note of it,? Singh added.

 The Singapore-based company?s Rs 400-crore project in Rajarhat?s Action Area II ? the single largest such investment in the city ? is likely to yield around two million sq ft of office space.

 ?The project is in the planning stage and we are in talks with local authorities like Hidco for the clearances and approvals. We intend to start work on the first phase by April 2006, which should be completed in 12 months.?

 The first phase ? likely to generate 400,000 sq ft space ? should then take three more months to be ready for companies to move in. ?We are tapping both our existing clients and new ones for renting space in the new IT park,? Singh said. The company?s client list includes IT and IT-related companies such as IBM, Intel, AOL and TCS.

 Ascendas ? with presence in 10 countries, including China, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman ? has built IT parks in Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad and is now looking at Pune and the national capital region for expansion in India.

 ?We plan to add around 13.3 million sq ft of IT space to the existing 1.8 million sq ft in the next 30 months,? said state IT secretary G.D. Gautama. ?We will do this through 13 IT parks in and around the city, and Ascendas?s is one of them.?

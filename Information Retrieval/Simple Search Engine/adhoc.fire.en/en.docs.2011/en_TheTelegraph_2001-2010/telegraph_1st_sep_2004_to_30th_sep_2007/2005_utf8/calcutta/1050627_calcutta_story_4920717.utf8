 Mallika Sherawat: 

 On a new quest

 Never mind that her latest Bollywood 

 release Bachke Rehna Re Baba has been a complete 

 washout at the box-office. What matters more is that slowly 

 and steadily Mallika Sherawat is well on her way to become 

 a global figure (literally). After her tryst with the Cannes 

 red carpet, where she swept Jackie Chan and a lot of others 

 off their feet, it?s time for Mallika to create waves on 

 international airwaves a la Aishwarya Rai.

 Yes, our Murder madam will feature on the CNN show Quest, on a special episode on world beauty. Quest has already had special series on comedy where the biggest names in international comedy and satire were quizzed to find out the secrets of their success. The popular show, hosted by Richard Quest, has already had celebrities like Angelina Jolie, Kate Moss, Madonna, Naomi Campbell and Goldie Hawn gracing the programme. Now, it?s the turn of Mallika. Only time can tell what she will do next, having ?restored Cannes?s reputation as a showcase for steamy glamour?.

 Priyanka Chopra with the winners: Screen switchMallika Sherawat: 

 After Mallika Sherawat and Urmila Matondkar, another Bollywood bombshell hits the small screen. In a growing trend in the world of showbiz, Priyanka Chopra joins the telly bandwagon and is slated to appear on Sony Entertainment Television?s Ye Meri Life Hai on Monday night?s episode.

 In the popular serial, Ronit decides against going to the college reunion since Poornima is not feeling well. Meanwhile Reema is excited about the evening. Pooja decides to speak to Akash about his plans to marry Reema. Meanwhile Yuvraj also goes to the reunion party to surprise Reema.

 It is this reunion bash where Priyanka comes as the chief guest and even talks about her new film opposite Arjun Rampal, Yakeen. 

 Also in another cross-promotion of sorts, Indian Idol finalists Rahul Vaidya, Prajakta Shukray, Vishal Kothari, Harish Moyal, Mukesh Pancholi and Ravinder Ravi belt out popular numbers in the reunion programme. 

 Finally, Priyanka presents the winning couple of the night, Pooja and Ronit, with the trophy. So, catch the special episode with the Aitraaz beauty at 10 pm tonight, on Sony.

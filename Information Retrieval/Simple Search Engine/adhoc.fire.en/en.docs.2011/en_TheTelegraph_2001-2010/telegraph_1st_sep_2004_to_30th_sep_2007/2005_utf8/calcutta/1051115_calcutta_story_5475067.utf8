The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dance of death

 Performed through dance, song, music and extended physical movements, Sansriti?s farcical satire Cadaverous brings to light the utter hypocrisy and indifference of the authorities and common people to tragedies and misfortunes suffered by their fellow men. It shows how extreme adversity in the lives of some can be turned into an opportunity for self-aggrandisement by others. In the play, Hamlapole, a little-known hamlet, suddenly grabs all news headlines as 23 of its villagers have died of starvation. Instead of trying to investigate the matter and take measures to prevent further such occurrences, political leaders, social bigwigs and the media alike utilise the news to fulfil their selfish ends. Soon enough, the hue and cry surrounding Hamlapole dies down, and the village quietly fades into oblivion. Direction: Anjan Deb. Also being performed this afternoon is Phataru, directed by Debesh Chattopadhyay.

 Event: Plays in Bengali, Cadaverous and Phataru, produced by Sansriti

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Page from past, call of future

Three months after capturing the Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay 

classic in the city, director Pradeep Sarkar is back to can the last few images 

for Parineeta. But he also has an eye on tomorrow as he returns to Victoria Memorial, 

not for phuchkas but to shoot a tourism ad, finds out Pratim D. Gupta

If you thought that the Parineeta parade in 

Calcutta was all over and the next thing on the Vidhu Vinod Chopra production 

would be on the big screen, well, you?ve got it wrong. Director Pradeep Sarkar 

will be back on Wednesday to can some more snatches of Calcutta for the final 

touches to the celluloid adaptation of the Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay classic, 

starring Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Vidya Balan and Raima Sen.

?A couple of ambience shots of the city streets was 

left to be taken and I have been pushing the dates back and back,? says Sarkar 

from Mumbai. 

?But with the film releasing on May 20, I had to come 

and get it over and done with. We were even contemplating capturing those particular 

shots by building sets in Mumbai but then decided against it because you can never 

get the real Calcutta anywhere else.?

So Sarkar and his team, headed by cinematographer 

Natarajan, will be shooting night-time Park Street on Thursday and Friday before 

returning to Mumbai to add the images to the ?almost ready? film. ?Since Parineeta 

the film is set in the 1960s and not in the 1920s and 30s as in the novel, we 

have to make the city streets look like that at night time. Jombe mone hoy?,? 

adds Sarkar.

But Parineeta?s not the only reason that will 

bring Sarkar back to the city. He also plans to shoot a 60-second commercial on 

behalf of his production company, Apocalypso Film Works, for the government of 

India. ?The ministry of tourism of the government of India has launched Atithi 

Deva Bhava, a social awareness campaign to create awareness among stakeholders 

of the tourism industry,? says Sarkar. ?They plan to train people like taxi drivers 

and tour guides to improve their behaviour and conduct to attract more tourists 

to the country. So they have got us to shoot two commercials for this new project 

? one in Mumbai and the other in Calcutta.?

Sarkar, who gave the city a taste of real Bollywood 

by getting the Saifs and Sanjus parked here for more than a month, won?t have 

any stars coming with him this time. ?No, I don?t need any of the stars for the 

couple of Parineeta shots left to be taken. As for the commercial, well, 

it is about the common man and I plan to have only ordinary people in the ad. 

While in Mumbai, I will shoot at the Gateway of India, in Calcutta it will be 

the Victoria Memorial,? says Sarkar.

As for the Parineeta promos, keep your eyes 

glued to the small screen. ?The teasers may come any time. Keep watching,? smiles 

Sarkar.

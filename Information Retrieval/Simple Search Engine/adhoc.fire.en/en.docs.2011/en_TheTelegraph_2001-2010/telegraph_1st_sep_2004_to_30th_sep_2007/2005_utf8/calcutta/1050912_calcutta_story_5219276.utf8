 Einstein, e=mc? and more

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics declared the year 2005 as the World Year of Physics. To celebrate, National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) is hosting an exhibition, A Century of Physics, at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) till October 9. 

 Rich with information, rare photographs and documents, informative panels, interactive exhibits and audiovisuals, the exhibition depicts how the basic principles of physics, enunciated by Albert Einstein, triggered a revolution in the understanding of the subject in the 20th Century. 

 ?Scientists are of the opinion that the 20th Century is the century of physics. Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein changed the concept of classical physics in their own eras. But 20th Century physics starts with Einstein. He revolutionised the concept of quantum physics. His equation e=mc? is the most famous one in the world,? said Jayanta Sthanapati, director, BITM.

 The exhibition is divided into five parts ? introduction (highlighting the life and times of Albert Einstein), understanding light, particle physics, properties of matter and understanding cosmology. A special attraction is Einstein?s explanation of his famous equation in his own voice. 

 The exhibition will keep moving for two years. The next stop is New Delhi, followed by Mumbai and Bangalore, before smaller centres like Bhubaneswar, Nagpur and Guwahati. 

 ?The exhibition started off well, but with school term exams on, students haven?t been coming in as usual. I?m sure the number will increase once the exams end,? Sthanapati said.

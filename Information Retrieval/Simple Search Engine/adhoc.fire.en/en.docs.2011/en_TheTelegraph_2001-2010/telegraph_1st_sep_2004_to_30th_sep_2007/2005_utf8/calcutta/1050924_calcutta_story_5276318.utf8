 South Eastern Railway (SER) will run 62 pairs of special long-distance trains to popular destinations during the Puja, against 39 pairs last year. 

 ?In addition, 813 additional coaches will be attached to regular long-distance trains, against 586 last year,? R.R. Bhandari, SER general manager, said on Friday.

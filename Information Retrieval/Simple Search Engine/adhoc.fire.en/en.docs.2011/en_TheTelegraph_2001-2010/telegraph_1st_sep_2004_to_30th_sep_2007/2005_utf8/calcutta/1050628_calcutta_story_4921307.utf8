Life

 Chit chat

 If you and your loved ones seem to live in different time zones, keep in touch the good old-fashioned way, with handwritten messages on paper strewn all over the house. 

 Bring back a touch of the personal in this sms age. Make your family smile by clipping love notes or more urgent things-to-do reminders on cute animal message holders.

 Adorable figures of animals like elephants and lions bear poles on their backs with clips attached to the ends, giving the decorative pieces a useful purpose, too.

Made of shiny and sturdy polystone material, the animals come poised in various postures like on all fours or standing on their hind paws. Some of these two-to-three inch items come fitted with springs on floral bases, which makes them bob when nudged. The designs are childlike and the contours fat and rounded, making them perfect for your childs bedroom. Its a good way for you to get around the nanny and make your presence felt even while away!

 The splash of colours is generous. Green, pink, yellow and purple lend cheer to miss you messages or a to-do list.

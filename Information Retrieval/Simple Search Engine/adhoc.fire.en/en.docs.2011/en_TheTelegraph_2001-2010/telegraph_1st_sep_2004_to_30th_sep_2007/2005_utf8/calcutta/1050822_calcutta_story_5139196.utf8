 Unrelenting vision 

 - Rabin Mondal?s exhibition

 Perhaps because Rabin Mondal?s works were all about the grim and unrelieved battle for survival, which never offered any palliatives or dreams to cushion the realities that are so hard to bear, that the 76-year-old artist was never quite popular either with the galleries or with buyers. 

 Of course, when the artist began his career, there were no galleries in Calcutta. Although he, along with some senior artists, were among the first to hold exhibitions here in a gallery in Park Mansion, where General Manekshaw would drop by.

 Mondal, who has spent the better part of his life in a Howrah lane, hardly ever got the recognition he deserved. Now, as many are aware, he has become a buzzword. 

 It is a sad reflection on the art world, with its internal politics and manipulations and unscrupulousness, that there is an attempt to turn the quiet and gauche artist into a star in the autumn of his life.

 A retrospective exhibition of the artist?s works from 1969 onwards has started at ITC Sonar Bangla. Organised by Delhi Art Gallery, the exhibition offers a sweeping view of Mondal?s unrelenting vision of strife. 

 His squat, scarred figures with broad-nosed tribal features seem to have stepped out of the imagination of a primitive artist.

 These are hairy, ugly, subhuman creatures that are human, nonetheless, like the Yahoos that Gulliver had met in his travels. 

 Faces are riven with pain and weariness and figures turn into masses of flesh and muscles. Christ is without his divinity. He becomes the symbol of humanity subjected to great suffering. 

 This dark vision was engendered by his times that had witnessed a famine and bloodshed, pre- and post-Independence. Earlier, his work used to look somehow dated, but now, as the grind of life in Calcutta becomes even more excruciating, his work has gained relevance once again.

 Some works come as revelations. There is one of a lone, naked figure in a harem, standing in front of an empty bed, about to be swallowed by the hugeness of the room.

 A king hides behind a wall as his assassin stands in the foreground. Another naked figure undergoes third degree. These are stark frightening images and realities that few artists would like to paint or confront.

 Mondal is also capable of creating works of great beauty. His image of a church has the serenity of a rosette window.

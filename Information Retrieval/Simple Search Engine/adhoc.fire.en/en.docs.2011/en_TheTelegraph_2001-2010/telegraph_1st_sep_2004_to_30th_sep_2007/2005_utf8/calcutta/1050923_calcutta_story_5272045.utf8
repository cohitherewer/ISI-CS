The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Double strike trouble at airport

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The airport will be out of bounds for fliers on September 29, courtesy two ?national? strikes scheduled for the day.

 One has been called by employees? unions against the proposed privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, likely to be joined by a 2,000-strong workforce, and the other by Left organisations against the Centre?s economic policies.

 Faced with the double blow, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is preparing contingency measures to ensure uninterrupted services. 

 ?Being an essential service provider, we have to come up with plans to tackle the situation,? said William Minz, general manager (aerodrome) and acting regional director.

 Though airport employees themselves have called a strike, several air traffic and communication personnel are resenting the move and demanding that civil aviation be officially brought within the ambit of essential service.

 ?Milk, healthcare and the fire department are essential services. Why not us? We have to take care of over 600 overhead flights, besides the scheduled take-off and landing,? said a spokesman for air traffic controllers at the airport.

 The scene on bandh days is largely the same: communication and air traffic personnel on duty the night before stay back and manage the day shift as well. ?As relievers fail to turn up, we don?t have a choice. Working under stress for such long hours can be disastrous,? the spokesman added.

 Branch secretary of the AAI Employees? Union, however, was categorical: ?We know we provide an essential service, but what about our security (post-privatisation)? We will go ahead with the strike.?

 A year ago, airport employees across the country had threatened to go on mass casual leave to oppose the privatisation move. 

 But civil aviation minister Praful Patel had pacified them by promising to consider an alternative proposal for developing airports. However, a few weeks ago, the government reopened the bids for the takeover of the two airports by private parties.

 The worst-hit, of course, will be the passengers. ?The number of cancellations on September 29 has increased,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

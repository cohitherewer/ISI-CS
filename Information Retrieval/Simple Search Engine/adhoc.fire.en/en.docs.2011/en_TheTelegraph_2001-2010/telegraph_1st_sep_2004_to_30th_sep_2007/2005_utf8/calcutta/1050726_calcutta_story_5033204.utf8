The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fitting in like a bar of Chocolate

 All set to make a splash with her debut, former Miss India Tanushree Dutta speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about her vision of an actress, her fever-pitch number and her dream to go Bengali

 Tanushree Dutta in Chocolate

 Another beauty queen in Bollywood. Isn?t it becoming too cliched?

 Beauty queens have always carried this stigma that they can?t act. But after they have proved themselves in the industry they are not asked this question. So, I guess, it?s part and parcel of being a newcomer that your looks are compared with your acting skills. But I have learnt to fight that. I have always had a vision of being an actress some day. I started off modelling, then went for beauty pageants and then into acting. Bollywood has been very open to newcomers. And if I deserve to be here, one day people will stop labelling me just a beauty queen.

 But it must be intimidating for any newcomer to face the camera alongside industry stalwarts like Anil Kapoor, Suniel Shetty and Irrfan...

 Of course. At first, I was really intimidated to be there. Such big names on the sets made me very nervous. But the makers, especially my director Vivek Agnihotri, and the cast members, made special efforts to make me feel relaxed and I gradually settled down.

 nHow do you fit into a film completely chock-a-block with men?

 Just like a woman fits into male-dominated areas in real life. (Laughs) But then again, Chocolate is not a male-dominated film. We women (she and Sushama Reddy) are very much there and fit in like bars of chocolates ? sweet, yet bitter.

 But don?t the hot dance numbers showcase you more than the script?

 Nothing like that. I have a very pivotal role in the film. Since it?s a thriller, I can?t divulge much. The songs are important for sure. The film has some great music by Pritam. I love all the tracks picturised on me. But the most special song has to be Bheega bheega? where I have this wet look in a pink number. I shot for the song in that wet costume three days in a row and on the fourth day I was down with 104 fever (laughs).

 You did start off doing a Bengali chat show on television?

 Yes, I remember I had to do the anchoring for a Bengali channel and even interview celebrities for the show. See, I always had a vision of becoming an actress but I didn?t know how to go about it and how much time it would take. So after those small-screen assignments, I signed up for the Miss India contest. But all I always wanted to do was films and I knew it would happen at some point of time. Now here?s Chocolate for a start. And trust me, I couldn?t have asked for a better debut. I am very happy.

 Tanushree with Emraan Hashmi in Aashiq Banaya Aapne

What other films have you signed?

 There?s one called Aashiq Banaya Aapne which is directed by Aaditya Datt and has Emraan Hashmi and Sonu Sood with me. It?s a young love story with a twist in the end.

 How about going for a completely deglamourised look in a Bengali film?

 I would love to do a film by Rituparno Ghosh or Aparna Sen. But they are maestros. For them to cast me in their films, they have to be first convinced about me as an actress. Once they know I can deliver, things will be on for sure.

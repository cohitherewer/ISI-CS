 Blame game over obese baby death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A blame game has broken out over how Lokman Hakim, the overweight 11-month-old, choked to death on Sunday afternoon at SSKM Hospital.

 Lokman?s distraught parents, farm labourers from Murshidabad, on Monday lodged a complaint of medical negligence with the SSKM Hospital authorities and the police, holding doctors of the paediatric department responsible for the boy?s death.

 Later in the day, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government went public with the autopsy report, that stated how Lokman had died after choking on regurgitated rice fed by his mother. And not because of a grain of rice getting stuck in the windpipe, as was believed on Sunday.

 ?His death was a case of aspiration pneumonia, which is caused when oxygen supply gets cut off with food particles getting lodged in the air passage,? said Debasish Sarkar, the doctor who carried out the post-mortem examination.

 Over the past few weeks, the 21-kg baby boy has been the focus of much attention. ?I felt bad when I came to know about the unexpected death,? said chief minister Bhattacharjee on Monday.

 ?There is nothing to suggest that the death occurred due to negligence,? added health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra.

 But the day after his death, Lokman?s parents raised angry voices against the hospital?s doctors and officials.

 In a strongly-worded complaint lodged with the SSKM authorities, Abdul Latif alleged that the doctors had forced his wife Gyanera Bibi to feed their baby semi-solids.

 ?Some of the medical staff at the hospital had even made fun of us? They said if we did not start Lokman on a semi-solid diet, his treatment for obesity would get hampered,? alleged Latif.

 Having been used to consuming about 1.5 kg of mashed or powdered rice and five litres of milk every day, Lokman had just started on a semi-solid diet in the form of rice pulp.

 ?Given his physical development and the diet followed by the children of similar age-group, we (the medical board) decided to start him on semi-solids,? confirmed P.K. Chandra, head of the paediatrics department.

 Both Gyanera and Latif also complained that no doctor was in sight when Lokman began to vomit. The main doctor, Supratim Dutta, arrived 40 minutes later, but by then Lokman was sinking, they alleged. Dutta, when contacted, said the doctors had tried their best to save Lokman?s life.

 Santanu Tripathi, SSKM superintendent, said preliminary investigations did not reveal any sign of negligence. ?The death seems to be purely accidental,? said Tripathi, poised to dash off his report to the government.

 Post-Puja revival for rally case

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The historic ruling of Justice Amitava Lala, banning rallies on weekdays, was almost forgotten ? it was last heard two years ago, when a division bench had put a temporary stay on it.

 Idris Ali, one of those who had initially moved the case, resurrected it on Monday by filing a petition in high court, seeking that it be taken up again at the earliest.

 He got an assurance from a division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Bishi that the matter will be taken up again for disposal. 

 But the judges declined to take it up pre-Puja.

 In October 2003, a division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice S.P. Talukdar had given a stay on Justice Lala?s ruling following a plea moved by the state government, and set a November 2003 date for a further hearing and possible disposal of the case. 

 But that never happened, and in the past two years, not a single hearing has been held.

 Moving the petition on Monday, Ali said: ?Thousands of citizens are subjected to regular harassment due to holding of rallies by political parties and others on the city roads. But for the past two years, not a single hearing has been held. This is a matter of great public concern and my plea is that it be heard at the earliest.? 

 Soon after Justice Lala?s suo motu ruling on September 29, 2003, banning rallies on city roads from 8 am to 8 pm on working days, almost all political parties came down on the judgment. The CPM held a rally to protest the judgment and party leader Biman Bose was openly critical of it.

 The state government moved an appeal against it, which led to a stay on Justice Lala?s ruling.

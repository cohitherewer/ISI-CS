 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY REVIEWS THE FASHION FAVES AT THE FILM FIESTA

 The dare bare act runs back to back at the annual film fiesta. So take your pick from halter, stringed, criss-crossed, straight straps and a hundred other styles on display in Cannes 2005.

 A classic statement on the red carpet, the bare back has taken fashion centrestage at formal evening dos for ages and the Cannes carnival is no exception.

 Says Delhi-based designer Nikhil Mehra: Backless styles never go out of fashion and they are seen at award functions and film festivals the globe over. But there are certain technicalities involved in flaunting a low-back outfit. One needs to have a longish torso with sharp and wide shoulders; voluptuous women should stay away from it. The hemline and neckline should also be different for all figure types. He goes on: To a short-haired woman I would give a halter-neck backless, while for someone with longish hair I would recommend cowl neck with bare back.

 Not just necklines, the style of the back itself can be quite innovative. A hot trend of the moment, it seems, is to use a piece of jewellery, a ring or metal chips, placed strategically in the middle to hold strings or straps. Ropes of Swarovski or other stones can also line the criss-crossed or straight straps.

 INDIAN IDOLS 

 Bollywood rsquo;s beauty brigade, led by the oh-so-international Aishwarya Rai, is not only making heads turn on the red carpet, it rsquo;s matching stylish steps with Hollywood rsquo;s leading ladies as well. So, our lehngas, saris and ethnic golds are seen shining bright amidst the rustle of satins and sparkle of diamonds.

 Aishwarya, though, has given Indianness the total miss, a statement her wardrobe shouted out loud at last years festival. The criticism for not wearing her nationality on her sleeve notwithstanding, the lady is living up to her international image quite well. So, flowing floral dresses and black cocktail gowns seem to be more her style than ethnic gear. And though the grumbles have gone down this year, theres no missing the few frowns.

 Says ace designer Ritu Kumar: Aishwarya is looking quite chic at Cannes, but theres no Indian touch to her wardrobe. Though it completely depends from individual to individual whether one would like to flaunt her nationality, I think she would have looked equally nice in chiffon saris. 

 The wardrobe Kumar has created for the other two actresses mdash; Mallika Sherawat and Nandita Das mdash; is a fine blend of the traditional and international, feels the designer.

 I have designed two saris for Mallika, which she hasnt worn till now. The saris are quite ethnic, but since they are crepes and are paired with cholis, the look is very modern, she adds.

 Till now, the sexy siren has been seen mdash; and photographed mdash; in bare-all lehnga-cholis in whites and neutrals with tone-on-tone embroidery. Too in-your-face is a common carp, though salivating men mdash; Jackie Chan downwards or upwards mdash; cant seem to stop gaping.

 For Nandita, casual chic is the code for Cannes. The dusky beauty started off with kurtis, moved on to traditional gear with red sari and heavy gold jewellery, only to slip back into salwar kameez. Ive designed a major part of Nanditas wardrobe. The casual look goes well with her personality and thats what Ive given her. Theres a very beautiful black sari with khari print which she is yet to wear, reveals Kumar.

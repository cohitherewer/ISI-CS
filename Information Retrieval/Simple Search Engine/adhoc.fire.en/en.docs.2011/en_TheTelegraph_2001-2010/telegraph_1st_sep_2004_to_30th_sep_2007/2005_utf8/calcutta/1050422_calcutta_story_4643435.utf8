 Con men in home stretch

 - 250 cheats from outside the state active in city, say cops

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Swindlers from outside the state have made Calcutta their happy hunting ground, catching the police unawares.

 By using a modus operandi different from city criminals, the con men have duped several citizens over the past month.

 A police investigation has revealed that swindlers from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have made off with about Rs 20 lakh in the past 30 days.

 Police suspect as many as 250 cheats from other states are now active in the city.

 ?We have asked officers of different police stations to look out for these criminals. Most of them look like well-established businessmen, making it difficult for common people to identify them. Policemen have been asked to warn people about the swindlers,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 The cops found out about the con men last month after more than 10 people, from travel agency-owners and hotel managers to taxi drivers, lodged complaints against them after being duped.

 ?We first found out about the style of operation of the con men on Wednesday after arresting two people in the Sarat Bose Road area,? Sharma added.

 According to police, a group of 50 swindlers, including women, are staying in Bandel, Hooghly, since last month.

 ?Members of the group travel to the city every day. They recently sold a brass necklace to a businessman in the Muchipara area for Rs 2 lakh, saying it was made of gold,? said an officer of the detective department.

 ?We are asking people to avoid entering into suspicious deals and contact police if something goes wrong,? he added. 

 An officer of Ballygunge police station said the arrested duo, Iqbal Ahmed Sheikh from Andheri, Mumbai, and Abhishekh Maheshwari from Jaipur, had rented an office on Sarat Bose Road a month ago.

 ?They approached businesses saying that they were owners of a company with an annual turnover of several crores,? he said.

 The two bought laptops and air tickets and rented a car against post-dated cheques. Complaints were lodged against them after the cheques were dishonoured. 

 The two were arrested after they approached a broker for renting office space.

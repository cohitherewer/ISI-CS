 Metro relives the four 

 hours and 40 minutes in which Gouri Rani Chakraborty fought 

 and lost her last battle to live... 

 3 am to 4 am: Gouri Rani 

 drifted into a coma. Nurses called doctors and she was administered 

 oxygen and antibiotic injections. Five doctors, including 

 resident medical officer and acting superintendent Subrata 

 Adhikary, went into a huddle. 

 ?We checked her blood sugar level and found that it was extremely high. The patient was already on drip and we increased the insulin level,? said Ashish Ghosh, one of the attending doctors. 

 Gouri Rani?s daughter Shikha and husband Robin, who were making frantic inquiries, were not told of her condition. ?Even the attendant, who was often conveying messages to us, could not say anything,? Shikha said. 

 4 AM to 5 AM: As Gouri 

 Rani lay still on the bed, breathing through the oxygen 

 mask, both eyes covered with bandage, the attendant (name 

 held back on request) told the family that ?something was 

 seriously wrong?. 

 ?What we found shocking was the attendant telling us that for an hour, no doctor had come to check her,? said Shikha. ?The attendant told us that one didi came to her bedside, checked the pulse, wrote something and went back. We were really worried.?

 5 am to 6 am: The nurses 

 checked Gouri Rani?s pulse, which was faint. The blood sugar 

 level was again checked. It had shot up further. The patient 

 was already in a deep coma. Another antibiotic was injected. 

 ?But we knew things were getting worse,? one of the doctors 

 said. 

 Outside, Shikha, Robin and a family friend were becoming impatient. Shikha wanted to get to the second floor, where her mother was fighting for her life. ?You have one red card and already an attendant is inside, so we cannot let you in,? said the gateman. ?My mother?s condition is serious and we want to know about her,? she pleaded. The gateman refused.

 6 am to 7 am: Gouri Rani?s 

 condition worsened and her pulse rate dropped further. ?The 

 doctors just came and went after a brief examination. They 

 did not give any medicine and were not telling me anything,? 

 the attendant later recounted to the family. 

 ?Do not create jhamela here. Get out of here if you have to shout. You cannot go inside,? the authorities told Shikha and Robin. ?We will not leave and you have to allow us to see how my mother is,? Shikha told them. 

 7 am to 7.40 am: The doctors 

 found Gouri Rani sinking and administered a life-saving 

 drug. They started a chest compression to keep her heart 

 beating. Finally, at 7.40 am, Gouri Rani stopped breathing. 

 She was pronounced dead.

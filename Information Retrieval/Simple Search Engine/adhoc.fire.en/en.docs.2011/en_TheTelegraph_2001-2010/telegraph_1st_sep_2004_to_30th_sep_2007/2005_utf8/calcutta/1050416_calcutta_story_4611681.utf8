The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Another car deadline set to bite the dust

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The state government seems set to safeguard its record of missing Supreme Court deadlines. Not so long, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government did all it could to duck D-day for enforcing stricter auto-emission norms.

 Now, it is poised to miss the May 1 deadline for introducing high-security number plates on all vehicles.

 The Supreme Court, in its judgment on November 30, had directed the Centre to introduce the number plates across the country from May 1. Cars, buses, trucks and other vehicles would be required to sport the specially-made metallic plates, with computer chips embedded in them, to help trace their location at any point of time. The plates would contain all relevant data about the vehicles and their owners.

 ?We don?t know when we will be able to introduce the number plates. It?s a completely new concept in the country and involves a highly technical process. All I can say now is that it will take some more time,? admitted transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 With a fortnight left for the deadline to lapse, the transport department is yet to arrive at a decision on awarding the contract. All it has done is invite tenders. Precious little has been done to expedite matters for the past five months.

 Sources said the government intends to cancel the tenders and start the process anew to accommodate claims of more bidders. Officials, however, find no reason for seeking fresh tenders, as the apex court had specified the criteria required for awarding the contract.

 The Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) had invited tenders in February and shortlisted three companies on the basis of their performance and experience.

 But the tenders were never opened. The offers of the three firms have been gathering dust at the TIDC office, as the government is now debating how to get more firms to apply.

 TIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee said the bids of the shortlisted firms had not been opened under orders from the transport department. 

 ?We have been asked by the government to wait for the next order,? he added.

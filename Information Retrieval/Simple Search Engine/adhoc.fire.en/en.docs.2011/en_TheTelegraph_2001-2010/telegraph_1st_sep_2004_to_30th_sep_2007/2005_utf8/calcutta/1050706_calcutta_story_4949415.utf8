The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 From 8 am to 2 pm, vehicles are allowed to enter Lord Sinha Road only from AJC Bose Road. After that, only south-bound vehicles are allowed entry from Theatre Road (from 2 pm to 8 pm). Apart from three reputed schools and a shopping mall, the offices of the deputy commissioner of police (special branch) and Border Security Force (south Bengal) are located on Lord Sinha Road. I have often spotted vehicles of these offices entering the road from the wrong side, flouting one-way norms. This results in increased traffic chaos on the already congested stretch. Wouldn?t it be possible for the vehicles of these agencies to avoid breaking road rules until and unless it is an emergency?

 The government should make it mandatory for all diagnostic centres to mention the name of the person who collects the blood sample in the reports. I had once come upon a very inexperienced employee at a clinic who kept tugging at the syringe while drawing blood. Not only was it painful but it could also have had serious consequences.

 The authorities should set up an alarm (a gadget similar to a burglar alarm) all along the underbelly of the Howrah bridge, about a metre below it, which will go off as soon as a vessel touches it. The system should be such that the nearest offices of the port authority and the river traffic police are also warned at that very moment. Such a system would make it possible to prevent a barge from causing extensive damage to the bridge even if it rams into it.

 Recently, on my way back from Bangladesh, I boarded a Four Star Consortium air-conditioned bus from Dhaka. On the way, the bus collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction. In an effort to save my face from hitting the seat in front, I cut my finger badly. We were rescued by fire brigade personnel and taken to the bus service company?s Benapole office. There was no provision for first-aid and the man in charge even refused to get us some ice to apply on the wound. Such rude behaviour was not expected of people handling tourists in our neighbouring country.

 Abul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Collin Lane. 

 The civic elections are long over, yet the posters, festoons, banners and graffiti are in place in most parts of Calcutta. After a few showers, they look even more ugly. It is high time that the new civic body orders the councillors to remove poll graffiti and posters.

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park.

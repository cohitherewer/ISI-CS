 Shut dose at polyclinics

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a massive drive over the past few weeks, the government has closed down nearly 40 polyclinics and diagnostic centres across the city as they have failed to conform to the newly-laid rules of the Clinical Establishments Act.

 ?All polyclinics and diagnostic centres and even nursing homes are supposed to seek a fresh licence under the Act, but most of them have not,? said health services director Prabhakar Chatterjee on Saturday, explaining the reason for the crackdown. ?The raids will intensify,? he announced.

 Of the 40-odd centres closed down so far, eight are in Behala alone. Over 60 doctors have lost their chambers. 

 ?The doctors cannot be blamed for what has happened. The onus of obtaining a licence lies with the owners, not the visiting doctors,? pointed out secretary Sanjay Banerjee of the Behala branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA). 

 ?We hope the government allows the centres to reopen their doors after penalising them so the doctors can get back their livelihood,? he added.

 The IMA has requested the government to look into the issue and sort it out as early as possible. ?The doctors had no idea what was coming, otherwise they could have taken up the issue with the owners,? secretary Banerjee continued. 

 After much delay and deliberation, including legal wrangles, the government decided to implement the Clinical Establishments Act this month. 

 ?Once this phase ends, we will take action against doctors who are practising in pharmacies,? director of health services Chatterjee asserted.

 Most pharmacies, post-crackdown, have barred doctors from practising on the shop premises. 

 ?We are small-time retailers. If the government shuts our shops, we?ll be in big trouble,? said Aloke Pramanik, a retailer in Kasba area.

 The government also proposes to make it mandatory for all privately-practising doctors to register themselves and their chambers with the health department, raising widespread protest in the IMA.

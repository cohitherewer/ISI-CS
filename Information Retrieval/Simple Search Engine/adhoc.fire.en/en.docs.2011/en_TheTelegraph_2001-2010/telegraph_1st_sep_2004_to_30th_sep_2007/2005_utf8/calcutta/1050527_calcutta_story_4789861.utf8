The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 More nurses join RG Kar agitation

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Shenaaz Begum, 50, was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Thursday following a bout of acute appendicitis pain. 

 Though she needed to be operated upon, the doctors turned her away as the hospital?s operating theatres remained shut for the second successive day due to a cease-work by the nurses.

 Earlier in the day, the 30-odd agitating nurses were showcaused for skipping their duties in operating theatres and the outdoor department. The agitation, however, continued, and 50 more nurses joined it in the evening, prolonging the stalemate.

 ?We have asked the nurses to join work immediately. Otherwise, disciplinary action will be taken against them,? hospital superintendent Pradip Mitra told Metro.

 ?We have sent the names of the agitating nurses to the health department,? he added.

 Till Thursday evening, with no sign of the cease-work ending, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra asked West Bengal State AIDS Control and Prevention Society director Suresh Kumar to resolve the impasse by speaking to the nurses. 

 Kumar?s marathon meeting with the hospital authorities and senior nursing staff did not yield any result, reportedly due to his refusal to meet all the agitating nurses for talks. He wanted to speak to a representative instead.

 ?The government has to listen to all of us. They cannot go on depriving us. If they want us to work in the outdoor department and the operating theatres, then they must recruit us there, and not just as bedside staff,? said a group of the protesters.

 The agitation has brought hospital services to a standstill, leaving the authorities with no choice but to cancel all surgeries and refuse admission of patients in the outdoor department, as well as for emergency surgery. 

 With a large number of patients being turned away from RG Kar, the other state-run hospitals are under pressure.

 ?Today, we received a number of patients who had initially been to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital,? said a senior doctor of the NRS Medical College and Hospital. 

 The nurses started their agitation on Wednesday to protest the ?indifferent attitude of the authorities?.

 ?A colleague was showcaused on Tuesday for no fault of hers. To protest the injustice, we have decided not to work in non-sanctioned zones, like operating theatres, labour rooms and the outdoor department,? said Anuradha Pal, in-charge of the operating theatre of the eye surgery department and a leader of the agitation. 

 She pointed out that only posts of bedside nurses are sanctioned at the hospital. If the nurses did not work in the other zones, no one could hold them responsible for impeding hospital services.

 The face-off between the nurses and the authorities started after Momina Khatun, nurse in-charge of the oncology department, was showcaused on May 6 for ?illegally occupying? the storeroom of the department. 

 On Tuesday, another notice was served on her, as the authorities found her response inadequate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

If you are a Cartoon Network fan and want to pack 

a spinach punch with Popeye, fly with the Powerpuff Girls and vanish with Sabrina, 

mark August 6 and 7 on your calendar. The channel is launching a nationwide campaign 

? Join The Powerpuff Generation. ?This is an opportunity to reach out to viewers,? 

explains Vivek Krishnani, director, marketing, Cartoon Network and Pogo. 

The hunt is for half-a-dozen kids (three boys and 

three girls) to anchor the new season of a popular Cartoon Network show. They 

will be flown to Mumbai to shoot as a ?Cartoon Network superpower?. The target 

age-group is seven to 14. ?The kids need to have the personality, sense of humour, 

communication skills and creativity that is characteristic of the Powerpuff generation,? 

Krishnani adds. 

The channel is covering 16 cities. ?Since our viewership 

of 22 million households is spread across the country, we are making sure that 

it becomes a truly national hunt,? he adds. So the hunt includes towns like Amravati, 

Kolhapur and Vijayawada as well. The auditions will take place physically in the 

four metros, with Bangalore being the first stop on July 31. Calcutta?s next, 

on August 6 and 7. The other 12 centres will be covered via virtual auditions 

by video-conferencing at Reliance Web World outlets. 

Enter the contest by submitting an entry describing 

a superpower you want to possess. The entry form can be submitted either by posting 

it to Cartoon Network or filling in the form online at www.cartoonnetworkindia.com 

or dropping it at the nearest Reliance Web World outlet. Look out for the form 

in an upcoming issue of Telekids. The channel is distributing the forms 

in 450 schools as part of a six-city contact programme. The deadline for submission 

is July 31.

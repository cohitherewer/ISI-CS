 Two students in hospital

 - Campus protesters? health fails, defiance strengthens

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two agitating students were shifted to hospital on Friday as the fast-unto-death launched by members of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) at Jadavpur University entered its fifth day.

 Of the seven striking students, Amit Chakraborty, general secretary of Fetsu, and Arun Majumdar, one of the five suspended, were admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) after they passed out. They have been put on drip. 

 ?Amit was taken to hospital around 2.30 am on Friday, while Arun was taken to CMCH in the afternoon,? said Parag Banerjee, assistant general secretary of Fetsu.

 He confirmed that Jayadratha Bhaduri, another striking student, had taken ill at about 8.30 pm on Friday. A large contingent of police was on the campus at the time but left soon after.

 ?The condition of the other protesters is also deteriorating. However, vice-chancellor Ashok Nath Basu showed no signs of softening his stand and withdrawing the suspension notices,? he added.

 A university official countered: ?The vice-chancellor met the students on Thursday and requested the five suspended students to apologise and show some sign of repentance, after which the matter could be considered by the executive committee. The vice-chancellor also asked the protesters to defer the strike. But they have not made their stand clear.? 

 The official said the students and their guardians were handed over the report of the medical team constituted by the university which directed the students to be shifted to hospital. ?It is obligatory on the part of the students to follow it,? he added.

 Fetsu has decided not to comply with the report, claiming it was handed over informally. ?The vice-chancellor had met us on Thursday afternoon. He had received the report by 7 pm the same day. Yet, it was given to us by some officials at 1.30 am on Friday. As for the students apologising, we are thinking over it,? said Fetsu assistant general secretary Banerjee.

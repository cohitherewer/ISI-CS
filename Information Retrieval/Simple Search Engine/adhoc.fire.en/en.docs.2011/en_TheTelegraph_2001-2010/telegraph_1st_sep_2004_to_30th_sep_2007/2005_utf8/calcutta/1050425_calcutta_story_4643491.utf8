The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You can rsquo;t get through this week without hellip;

 Skirting the issue

 Never mind if you are feeling too lazy to make a trek to the gym in the sudden swelter, feel free to guzzle barrels of chilled beer and hide that belly under the feminine flounces of a skirt. Yes, the convenient garment continues to be in this season (trust the Lakme India Fashion Week verdict if you don?t believe us), helping you tide over many a sinful bulge. If your problem is below the belt, take full advantage of the trend and donning a tight top with your pear shape under wraps. 

 Throwing a pool party

 If deception through a dashing drape is not your style, fight the fat while having fun. Make a splash with a pool party. Not only will you beat the humidity at its game, you can be the proud owner of a healthy tan (let?s call it a glow). If you want the bronze look to stay on trim limbs, make the splash-about a weekend feature.

 Taking stock

 The VAT scare is back. Even though it?s been assured by all that essential commodities won?t be affected during the 10-day traders? strike, this is no time to leave your pantry to the emergency two-minute noodle situation. Take more interest in the weekend shopping and indulge in bazaar-side adda over the pros and cons of the new tax regimen. 

 Watching Waqt

 Bachchan?s back post Black and this time, he?s got Akshay Kumar for company. When you throw in the top-of-the-pops Priyanka Chopra in the scheme of things, you are guaranteed a race against time to the ticket counters. If the main action lets you down and you find yourself looking at your watch to count the seconds till curtain call, the subplot with the reigning kings of comedy, Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav, might help time really fly.

 Medical students eye Russian centres 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 An increasing number of students from Calcutta and other cities,are enrolling in foreign universities to study medicine. While most are leaving for Russia, quite a few have set their eyes on institutes in China, Hungary and Romania.

 Just two years ago, only around 20 students from India used to study in Russia. Now, there are as many as 150.

 ?It is amazing to see the number of Calcuttans opting for Russian universities these days. Education in general cheaper there, the package on offer for foreign students is very attractive,? said Ashish Sonde, director of the International Foundation for Studies and Culture (IFSC).

 The organisation works under the cultural department of the consulate-general of the Russian Federation in Mumbai.

 Russian universities are offering packages that cost Rs 1.25-1.75 lakh per year, compared to around Rs 9 lakh charged by a reputed medical university in India under the capitation fee scheme. 

 In fact, several JEE-qualified students are flocking to foreign universities as the fees charged by them are only slightly higher than what the Bengal government charges (around Rs 4 lakh for the entire course).

 ?We are expecting around 100 Calcuttans to get enrolled in Russian universities by end-September,? Sonde said. 

 The favoured destinations include St Petersburg State Paediatric Medical Academy, Saratov State Medical University and the Kazan State Medical Academy.

 China, too, is luring a fair share of the state?s students. ?The packages offered by Chinese universities are very cheap. Students have to pay around Rs 7 lakh, including the insurance amount, for the entire course,? said Dr Amiya Maiti of AK Maiti Educational Foundation.

 According to an amendment to the Indian Medical Act, 1956, an Indian student wishing to study in a medical college abroad has to obtain an eligibility certificate. And on completion of the course, he or she has to appear for a screening test conducted by the National Board of Examinations, New Delhi, for registration. 

 ?Since the standard of education in foreign universities is good enough, the students can easily clear the test in India,? Sonde stressed.

 The duration of postgraduate courses in medicine and dentistry in Russia is three years. The universities do offer the courses in English, but the students need to learn the local language in the first year so that they can freely interact with Russian patients during clinical visits.

 Infusing life into dead earth is a passion that unites a group of artists from the Government College of Art and Craft, Calcutta. Proficient in creative design both by training and intrinsic sensibility, their work represents the perfect marriage of a poets maverick mind with a professionals deftness. In an attempt to present the pottery of Bengal in its true colours, this team of artists has moulded familiar, miscellaneous articles of daily use into traditional objects, conceiving, in the process, its own genre of poetry. Down to Earth, the ongoing exhibition of the group?s creations on clay, brings together a body of work that draws inspiration from Bengal?s ethnic canvas, yet speaks a language that transcends the limits of time. Participants: Partha Dasgupta, Arun Mukhoty, Manik Das, Manoj Kumar Das, Mousumi Roy, Payel Sarkar, Tanmoy Das, Soumen Basu and Gourab Malakar. Hosted by Arts amp; Ideas.

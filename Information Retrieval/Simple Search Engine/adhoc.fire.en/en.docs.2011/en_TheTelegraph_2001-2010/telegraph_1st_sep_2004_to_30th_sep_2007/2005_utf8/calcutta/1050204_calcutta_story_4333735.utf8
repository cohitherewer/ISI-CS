The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Honour rerun for architects? forum

 - Sole Third World invitee to green summit

 SUBHRO SAHA

 After the World Congress of Architecture and the World Water Forum, another feather in the cap awaits the Centre for Built Environment (CBE) and Calcutta in Wels, on the foothills of the Austrian Alps this March.

 Senior architect-planner Santosh Ghosh, president of the city-based non-profit society of ?like-minded? architects, city planners and environmental engineers, has been invited to speak at The World Sustainable Energy Days, to be held at the Stadthalle, in the Austrian city, from March 2 to 4.

 Ghosh, the ?sole representative from the Third World? at the prestigious green summit, will read a paper on ?Sustainability in public and commercial buildings? on March 3 in the section ?Bridging the gap between economy and ecology?.

 The meet is the largest annual conference in this field in Europe, providing a key forum in which the latest technological developments, outstanding examples and strategies are discussed and new partnerships forged.

 CBE, the only think tank in the country regularly invited to such global forums, had done the city proud earlier as well. 

 Its member architect Unmesh Kirtikar was the sole Indian speaker at the 21st World Congress of Architecture, held in Berlin in July 2002, presenting a paper on ?Future perspectives of Asian urban societies?.

 The organisation was again the only representative from Calcutta at the 3rd World Water Forum, held in Japan in March 2003. It has been invited to the fourth edition of the forum in Mexico City 2006 as well. 

 CBE members will conduct a session at the global forum on urban hydrology in Singapore (June 20-24), to be convened by president Ghosh.

 The centre, which has become the reference point in town for most architecture and planning students, has also been invited to participate in the Asia-Pacific conference on housing and globalisation, to be held in Kobe, Japan from September 6 to 8. The next World Congress of Architecture in Istanbul is ?a distinct possibility?, too.

 ?There is always a meaningful exchange of ideas at these global forums, and we get exposed to the best practices. CBE ensures a continuous back-flow of these critical inputs to not just the students, but grassroots organisations, professionals and various stakeholders,? says Kirtikar.

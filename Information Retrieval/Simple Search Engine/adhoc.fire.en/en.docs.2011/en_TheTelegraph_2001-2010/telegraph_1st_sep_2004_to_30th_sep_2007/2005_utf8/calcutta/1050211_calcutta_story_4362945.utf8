The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crusader congress to devise roadmap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tahir Khilji works with zananas in Lahore, a community of men who identify themselves as women. 

 Tulika Das gave up her life in Calcutta to live in villages of South 24-Parganas, to fight for the cause of the disabled. 

 Arvind Kejriwal launched the Right to Information campaign in Delhi, that has won kudos from all sectors. 

 Kate Kurawallah from Maharashtra has been working to bring the cause of dyslexia into the public eye?

 Each of these individuals is fighting for a cause he or she believes in, helping to change society and make lives a little better. These ?social entrepreneurs? are Ashoka fellows. The fellows from South Asia are in Calcutta for a three-day workshop to discuss strategies and make a road map for success.

 They are inspired either by their own experiences, or by the injustices they witness around them. Tahir, for instance, is a victim of abuse. ?Masculinity in South Asia is very rigidly defined, which I didn?t fit into. Being from a boarding school background, I had to suffer,? he says.

 Seven years ago, he co-founded the organisation Vision, to empower zananas, helping them get out of the vicious circle of abuse.

 Arvind is an income-tax official in Delhi, who has taken a long leave from work to concentrate on Parivartan, the organisation he helped start up in 2000 to beat extortionist corruption against the common man. 

 ?When I would see the problems people faced to get simple things done and solve everyday problems, I had to do something,? he says. He has helped countless people in Delhi to assert their rights and get the job done.

 As for Dr Subroto Das, based in Ahmedabad, nearly having his arm amputated in an accident on a national highway was enough motivation to set up an emergency helpline that now serves over 800 km in Gujarat and Maharashtra. The service is free, and has in its network, police stations, ambulances, hospitals and even metal-cutters.

 Summer?s red-hot racks

the Half-Blood Prince and Moby?s Hotel; Amartya Sen

 Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni and Shobhaa De may fast be disappearing off the shelves as of now, but are their days numbered? So it seems, what with a spate of much-awaited titles eyeing a summer release. And if the book corner is gearing up for a stiff fight over shelf space, the music gallery is no less crowded with loads of veterans slated to cut new discs. Here?s a round-up of the season?s potential lords of the rack.

 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (J.K. Rowling)

 Though the writer and her publisher have kept the book a tightly wrapped secret, fans have managed to piece together information about the much-awaited sixth volume of Harry Potter. According to websites tracking the book, Harry will spend his shortest summer holiday at Privet Drive, Wormtail will reappear and a new Minister of Magic instated. Also, there?s more about Voldemort?s birth. 

 The Solomon Key (Dan Brown)

 The author who ruled for most of last year is likely to sustain his dream run. After the tremendous success of The Da Vinci Code, Brown?s forthcoming novel is one of the most highly anticipated works. Speculation is rife about the read likely to feature Harvard professor Robert Langdon again. It will be set in Washington and focus on Freemasons.

 Saturday (Ian McEwan)

 The Booker-winning author of the best-selling Atonement is expected to do well with his upcoming title. The story follows a day in the life of a London neuro-surgeon whose comfortable existence goes topsy-turvy with a string of incidents, mundane and mind-blowing.

 The Argumentative Indian (Amartya Sen)

 This collection of essays by the Nobel Laureate economist will dwell on contemporary India in the light of its argumentative tradition.

 Also figuring on the must-read list are Paul Theroux?s Blinding Light, Kazuo Ishiguro?s Never Let Me Go, Umberto Eco?s The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana and Arundhati Roy?s collection of essays, The Ordinary Person?s Guide to Empire.

 From books to beats...

 Hotel (Moby)

 Play and 18 catapulted Richard Melville Hall aka Moby (Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick, was his great-great grand uncle) to superstardom. Expectations, thus, are sky high for the American music maker?s latest release. Lots of sampling, vocals by Moby himself and even a touch of political consciousness is likely to assure electronica nirvana and a little more. First single out: Lift me up.

 Guero (Beck)

 Video game sound effects, random shouting in Spanish, and rhymes about popsicles and vegetable vans could be the real highlights of Beck David Campbell?s latest. Guero, Spanish for ?white boy?, is his follow-up to 2002?s Sea Change, a moderate hit. There was a lot more freedom while recording this set, Beck has said, which prompted him to even attempt some rap songs. First single out: E-Pro.

 Bleed Like Me (Garbage)

 Personal and professional break-ups later (the band had called it quits a while back and singer Shirley Manson separated from her husband recently), the motley crew of producers, musicians and a singer is back. The passage of time hasn?t softened the music as the new album is said to be as hard-rocking as any Garbage album. First single out: Why do you love me.

 The Emancipation of Mimi (Mariah Carey)

 Is the squealing diva?s career well and truly over? Emancipation? might well prove critics wrong. First single out: It?s like that.

 New albums are also expected from Oasis, Coldplay, Nine Inch Nails, Dr Dre, 50 Cent, Rolling Stones, Foo Fighters, Dave Matthews Band, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and even reality TV star Paris Hilton.

Minstrel with a folk feel

Most of you have no idea who I am,? announced a tall, 

silver-haired American clad in denim and kurta with an acoustic guitar slung over 

his shoulder on a south Calcutta rooftop. ?And that?s good.?

 But by the end of a set of songs that barely spanned an hour, the 50-odd people who had gathered to hear James Durst sing, wished they had heard of him earlier. Or at least heard him sing.

 Durst is not a ?fusion genius? who ?loves to return to Calcutta? nor an ?international talent? making a cursory stopover in a city still replaying its music mecca glory. Instead, he has travelled around the world and made music for 40 years without hitting the charts or finding huge fan followings.

 ?Where have all the years gone, I wonder,? he told his audience between songs at Srijan?s ?informal adda in the womb of our staircase? on Friday evening. Armed only with an acoustic guitar (made in 1976 and with Durst since 1984), he sang songs of love, nature and protest, much in the tradition of Pete Seeger, one of his heroes.

 ?But it?s not strictly folk music,? Durst later said. ?Every song has its own flavour and I want it to be judged for its content and intent.? There was El condor pasa, a song popularised by Simon and Garfunkel, which Durst sang in Spanish as also other self-composed melodies like Internationally unknown, which was requested for an encore.

 The treat, however, was a rendition of Hemanta Mukhopadhyay?s Duranto ghurni, sung in Bengali without even a glance at the lyrics.

 All the songs had Durst asking the audience to join in, be it in humming a line or singing parts of the chorus or just clapping along. He was joined by his wife of eight years, Madhumita Chakraborty, for some of the numbers. Though the couple is settled in New York, Madhumita belongs to Calcutta and is one of the reasons for Durst?s visits to the city, this one being his fourth.

 Besides the music, what stood out was Durst?s sense of humour. ?It?s like church,? he quipped when some listeners trooped in midway into the performance, ?you have to sit in front if you?re late.? Again, when asked if he?d sing in French and Portuguese, Durst replied, ?that?s easy to answer ? no and no?.

 Barring the usual disturbances ? people walking in late or talking loudly and the cell phone ringing occasionally (prompting Durst to remark ?if you could tune your cell phones to the chords, it?d be great?) ? the audience heard and sang along with James Durst. 

 Next up is a tribute to the Weavers, Pete Seeger?s legendary folk group, that Durst and fellow musicians are organising. Seeger himself has described the effort as ?four wonderful people who?ve picked up where the Weavers left off?. 

 Those who wanted a little more music from Durst had the chance to buy his CDs. That was the sole strand of commercialism on the breezy summer evening that saw Durst fill many a heart.

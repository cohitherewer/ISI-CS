Behind the bar

Unless you?ve been hiding 

in a closet for the past year, you are familiar with the cultural revolution going 

on in the nightclubs and bars, where people dance to Salsa while drinking mojitos.

The MOJITO (pronounced moe 

? hee ? toe), in case you have been wondering, is the national drink of Cuba. 

It is as enjoyable as a summer vacation on the beach. It is made by combining 

mint (called hierba buena or good herb in its country of origin) with sugar 

syrup, lime juice, rum and club soda.

The word mojo means 

assemble or mixture and that is exactly what this cocktail is ? an enjoyable and 

harmonious mixture of aromatic and tasteful ingredients.

The original Mojito

Ingredients

1.5 oz Bacardi Carta Blanca (light-dry) rum, 12 mint 

leaves, half a lime, 2 dashes Bitters (optional), syrup

Method

In a Collins glass, place 12 mint leaves and the lime. 

Crush well. Add 2 dashes Bitters (optional), cover lime with simple syrup (or 

add 4 tsp sugar) and fill the glass with ice. Add the Bacardi, top off with club 

soda, stir well and garnish with sprigs of mint or a lime wheel.

The improvised Park Mojito

Ingredients

Crushed ice, half quarters of lime, large mint leaves, 

Bacardi 60 ml, sugar syrup 15 ml, freshly squeezed lime juice 10 ml

Mise-en-place (enough for 

10 Mojitos):

Half fill a jug with freshly 

squeezed lime juice. Take 10 limes, cut each into quarters. Cut each quarter into 

two halves. Drop these pieces in the jug with the lime juice and keep for at least 

an hour. Pluck fresh, large mint leaves (keep at least 50 g of leaves ready). 

Prepare 200 ml fresh sugar syrup, cool in a refrigerator and keep ready.

Method

Put 8-10 mint leaves in a shaker. Add 10 ml fresh 

lime juice from the jug, 2-3 half quarters of lime and 15 ml of sugar syrup. Muddle 

all the ingredients well with a wooden muddler for about 20 seconds. Do not make 

a paste ? just ensure all the ingredients are mixed well and the mint leaves are 

bruised and crushed. Pour the mixture into an old-fashioned glass. Fill the glass 

with crushed ice. Pour 60 ml of rum over the crushed ice. Stir well with a stirrer. 

Drop one lime quarter on top for garnish. Serve with stirrer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 People power in hazard halt

 SUDIP BANERJEE, chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Jayanta Sthanapati, Prabal Ganguly, Jiten Das, Sandip Banerjee, G. Laha, Sital Das, Sandip Ghanti, Ranajit Basu, Sailen Bhattacharjee and Sudhin Chatterjee

Ranajit Basu: Pollution and environmental issues, which were the concern of only the academics, are now widely discussed. Can you please explain the background of the environment laws?

 The word environment is derived from the French word environ, meaning encircle. Every law is born out of social, economic and political needs. The first environmental law in India was enacted in 1905. It was known as Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act and was passed mainly to preserve the beauty of the Victoria Memorial Hall.

 During the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan, it became apparent that the environment would suffer because of large-scale industrialisation. However, it was not before 1974 that a number of Acts were passed by the legislature to prevent the onslaught of industrial activities on the environment. 

Jayanta Sthanapati: Several plastic-manufacturing units are being set up in the residential areas of Jadavpur and Santoshpur. These units are polluting the environment. How can the board help us check the menace?

 Pollution cannot be monitored effectively in the state unless educated people step forward and inform us about polluting agencies in their areas. Since you have noticed polluting plastic-manufacturing units operating in a residential area, please write to us giving the details of the units? locations.

 After getting your written complaint, we will check whether the factories can operate in residential areas or not. In case they are not entitled to operate in residential areas, they will have to either close down or shift to an industrial zone.

 We will also find out if the factories need a no-objection certificate from the board. If they fail to produce the necessary documents, we are empowered to stop their operation.

Sandip Banerjee: Like environment cops in some European countries, we do not have specialised forces to tackle environmental problems. What are the enforcement bodies through which you crack the whip on polluting agencies?

 We mainly work with police, district administrations, factory directorate, municipalities and panchayats. We also coordinate with departments like the transport and fishery and agencies like Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

 Once a violation of pollution norms is brought to our notice, we determine which agency is responsible for looking after the problem. Then, we ask it to take necessary action.

 In this connection, I want to cite an example that will explain why there is a delay at times in solving a problem. Some months ago, a woman from Ballygunge informed me over the phone that there was a waterlogging problem in her neighbourhood. The water could not be drained out as waste from a plastic factory was clogging the passage. She had written to the chief minister and the President about the problem.

 When I asked her who was the local councillor, she failed to answer. We found out who the councillor was and informed him of the matter. The problem, which had lingered for over a year, was solved overnight.

Jiten Das: I have invented a gadget that will help clean hazardous waste. How can I get a licence from the board regarding its efficiency?

 We are not the competent authority to certify the efficiency of such a machine. But if it works on indigenous technology, we will definitely want to take a look, as it can help us and the civic bodies as well. For a licence, you have to apply to us in writing, giving the details of the machine and how it works. We can comment on the machine?s performance after our experts examine it.

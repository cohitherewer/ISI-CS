Wave a special ticket tag to wow the missing revenue 

stream at the Book Fair

SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

Subir 

Had An afternoon off. He checked with his wife Anindita. Like old times, they 

set out for the Book Fair.

As they got out of their car, Subir realised they 

were hopelessly out of place. Glances asked them: what are you doing here?

There were two counts on which they disqualified. 

Majority of the onlookers was below 25. Subir had crossed 50 a while ago. The 

awkwardness was unjustified, but real.

The major difference, however, rested elsewhere. Faces 

around them, those waiting to enter the fair, all carried unmistakable signs of 

tiredness. The journey to the fair had already sapped their energy. In comparison, 

the arrival of Subir and his wife was almost aristocratic.

The couple carried the awkwardness inside. The two 

did not dare to enter any stall ? most were too crowded for their comfort. Those 

that looked roomy had a mile-long queue. After walking for a while, they were 

not sure whether they were going anywhere. 

They were not even sure where to go. Sign posting 

was conspicuously absent. They kept walking. Soon they became tired? A place to 

sit, a toilet, maybe a drink? None was immediately available.

Exhausted, they turned back. Not a single bookstall 

visited. Not a single friend met. On their way back, Subir and Anindita kept recalling 

their last trip to boi mela ? when they were holding hands and studying 

in college?

Yet, the Book Fair is not suffering from lack of attendance. 

At Rs 5 a go, the entry tickets cost less than a bottle of cola. In addition, 

a promotion is running. The offer is generous: buy three entry tickets and get 

one free.

Filling up the fair grounds is not an issue at all. 

The real business issue may be making the most from the fair, in revenue terms.

How about luring Subir and Anindita? They are possibly 

ready to pay more to get in and spend many times more, once inside. They will 

pay for nostalgia. They will spend to remind themselves that they are educated. 

More importantly, they will spend to prove to themselves that they have arrived. 

They are the missing revenue stream for the Book Fair.

The real issue is whether Subir and Anindita can coexist 

with their past in the Book Fair. Maybe a Taj Mahal pricing is the answer: pay 

Rs 5 to enter during the day. After 6 pm, it is exclusively for those who can 

afford Rs 100 to enter (price of a movie in INOX).

That price would possibly give Subir what he needs 

? room to get back to his education days.

He will need a site plan to help him locate the book 

that he wants to browse, some information on what else he can experience at the 

fair and, of course, a few of his favourite things. Maybe a Kookie Jar to serve 

him pastries and perhaps a Flurys to serve him patties and tea?

This is easier said than done. Understandably, the 

current audience cannot be expected to enjoy being thrown out of the fair every 

evening at 6 pm. On the other hand, making the assumption that the affluent Calcuttan 

is inevitably uncultured and uneducated ? and therefore won?t make it to the Book 

Fair ? is not a very sound business premise either.

Not an easy problem to solve. But then who said making 

money was easy?

 Cool tools for class

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 From laptops that allow the little ones to say goodbye to the burden of schoolbags to student-friendly mobiles and electronic exercise books, a glut of gizmos for kids is set to hit the city racks in 2006.

 The Calcutta-based Techno India Group (TIG) is working with Indian and US companies to make the gadgets, most of them educational tools, available to students at affordable prices.

 While the technology and designing principles involved are not novel, the vision behind the endeavour, of reducing study-related stress among children, is.

 ?The entire school curriculum can be downloaded to the laptop, which we are going to launch soon. The students can, therefore, carry the laptop to the school, instead of bags filled with books,? said Satyam Roy Chowdhury, managing director, TIG.

 The laptops will support wireless connectivity with the school libraries. 

 It might even be possible for students to record lectures or tune into live feeds of classes from home.

 Even the specially-designed mobile phones, expected to cost a maximum of Rs 1,500, will allow access to libraries and education-related information.

 But the gadget with by far the most potential of helping students is the electronic exercise book.

 ?It will look like a pad, with an onscreen keyboard. The students can key in and save whatever they want and exchange the documents over the Internet. For example, if a student finds it difficult to solve a sum, he can instantly contact his teacher with the electronic exercise book and find out where he is going wrong,? explained Roy Chowdhury.

 Up to 5,000 pages of information can be stored in a central server for each user of the device, which is to be priced below Rs 10,000.

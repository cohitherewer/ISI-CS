 Cheque fraud net bust

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The CID has stumbled upon a racket engaged in siphoning off cheques ? issued by companies to pay dividends to share holders ? from the Airport post office, and cashing them through fake accounts.

 Two persons were arrested on Tuesday night and a search is on for the other gang members.

 Sleuths suspect some are from the sorting division of the post office. Around 1,000 cheques have been recovered.

 A preliminary probe suggests the racket had siphoned off around Rs 5 lakh in the past year.

 Subhas Chakrabarty, who lives near the airport, has been remanded in police custody till December 18, while Nandalal Khatik, a resident of Chiriamore, was admitted to hospital after he complained of heart trouble.

 ?The racket had spread its network far and we need some time to know how it worked,? said D.P. Tarenia, inspector general of police (II).

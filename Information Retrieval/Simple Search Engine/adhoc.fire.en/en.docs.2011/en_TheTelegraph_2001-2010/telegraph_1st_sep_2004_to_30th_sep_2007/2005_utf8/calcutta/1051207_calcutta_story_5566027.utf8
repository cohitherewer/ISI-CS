 Animal effect on money matters

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, people belonging to the animal sign dragon should be careful next year. The ruling animal next year is dog, which clashes directly with dragon. For protection, one should carry the picture of a rabbit in the wallet or keep one on the office table

Q: My husbands date of birth is 12.03.1964. I want to know his animal sign and kua number. He wants to take his business to great heights but fails every time. What should he do so that his business flourishes? Also, he gets depressed very fast. How can I get him out of this situation?

 K. Mundhra

 THE SOLUTION: Your husbands animal sign is dragon and the kua number is nine. His auspicious directions are east, south-east, north and south. Your husband is a strong metal person and has been uncomfortable since 2002.

 Water represents his mind and intelligence. He should hence be wearing clothes that are blue or black in colour. This will strengthen his mind and defend him against depression.

 The ruling animal of the next year, which is dog, clashes with his dragon sign. Give him protection with a picture of a rabbit in his wallet or on his office table from January 29, 2006 till February 18, 2007. The ruling fire element of next year should bring a change in his life. Expect something significant in the coming year.

 Study time

 Q: My son Prateek Nair was born on February 4, 1993. He cannot concentrate on his studies and finds it difficult to memorise his lessons. He makes silly mistakes, which result in poor grades. His room is situated in the extreme south of our flat and his study table is in the east. He faces the east while studying. His bathroom is situated in the north-east of the room. I know this is not auspicious, but the position cannot be altered. Please advise what I can do to improve his school results.

 Prateeks pillars of destiny reveal that he is a very balanced child with a good distribution of all the elements. The supportive wood element signifies high qualification for him. From 2003, he is under the influence of water element that brings a direct pressure on his self fire element. This element does not allow him to concentrate and grasp his lessons to the best of his abilities. 

 From 2007, he is entering his earth period that signifies creativity for him and his mind will be at its best. He will then be able to excel in his studies. As of now, instead of facing the east while studying, he should face his auspicious direction, which is north-east. He can also keep his books in this corner of the room. This will help him to memorise his lessons better. Place a mirror on the outside of his bathroom door to nullify the negative effect.

 Career choice

 Q: I was born on April 24, 1990, at 8.48 am. I will be appearing for my secondary exams in February 2006. The problem is that however much effort I put into my studies, I am stuck on a particular score. Can you please suggest a remedy for this? Also, I want to pursue hotel management as a career and want to know whether I will succeed in it.

 Arpita Agarwal

 Your pillars of destiny reveal that you are a strong earth person and the best profession for you will be related to the water element. The careers connected with this element are media, communication, banking, finance, accounts and marketing. If you have a desire to go for hotel management, then you should specialise in the marketing department.

 Do not worry about your board examinations. You are going through your status period that will give you good results. Make the most of this good time and study as hard as possible. 

 Direction wise

 Q: I am a stock market broker and also invest my own funds extensively in shares. I have been quite successful in my trading so far. I am now moving into a new office and would like your guidance regarding the arrangement of the desk and the computer through which I conduct the trades.

 Aditya Surana

 The positive energy of your working environment is affected greatly by the way you arrange the tools of your trade on your desk. Favourable positioning can greatly help you achieve your goals. First, determine the centre of your desk and then find the magnetic north. Place objects in sectors where they harmonise with the energy of that direction. Here goes the list of directions and what they symbolise.

 North-east: This stands for motivation and you should put objects here that encourage you to work harder. These can be materials related to financial forecasts and prospects of making good profits. This is an ideal place for you to keep your computer. In case you have a small television, that should also be placed here.

 North and north-west: Communication and organisation are what these two directions symbolise. You should place your diaries, planners and organisers here. Also apt for your mails, phone and fax machine.

 East: This is the zone for future dreams, the place for a souvenir of what you can achieve with your hard work. Place a photograph or showpiece of the thing you want next. 

 South-east: This direction is related to finance. You should place your cash boxes and the data of your good clients that give you great business here. Such clients represent wealth for you.

 South: This stands for public recognition. You should keep things such as awards and prizes here.

 South-west: Photographs or other mementoes of your family are apt here as the south-west symbolises harmony.

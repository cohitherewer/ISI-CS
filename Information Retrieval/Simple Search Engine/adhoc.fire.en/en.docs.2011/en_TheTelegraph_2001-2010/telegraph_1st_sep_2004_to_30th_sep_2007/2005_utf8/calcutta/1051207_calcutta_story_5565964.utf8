 Cops open eyes to open manholes

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has submitted a list of 12,000 manholes, whose covers have been stolen, to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, saying a lack of proper vigil is responsible for the state of affairs.

 At the same time, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharaya has allotted Rs 2 crore to replace the stolen covers. ?It will be a colossal waste of public money if they get stolen again,? the mayor warned.

 The civic body has also drawn up a list of five police station areas, where theft is most rampant.

 These are Narkeldanga, Amherst Street, Taltala, Entally and Tollygunge.

 Theft has been almost nil in the Behala and Garden Reach areas (borough XIII, XIV and XV), where there is no underground sewer network.

 The most affected areas are BBD Bag (south), APC Road, Amherst Street, Keshab Sen Street, Rabindra Sarani, MG Road, Canning Street, Creek Row, New Alipore, Gariahat Road (south), Lake Road, Bijoygarh, Bidhannagar Road, Ultadanga Main Road and Bagmari Road.

 The civic authorities? missive, issued by municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to police on Monday, followed pressure from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 A report on the missing covers and a request ? ?You may kindly instruct your officials to take prompt and active steps? ? have been appended to the letter.

 A senior civic official said the instruction to write to the police commissioner came from Dipankar Mukhopadhyay, principal secretary to the chief minister.

 The civic authorities reminded commissioner Mukherjee that former municipal commissioner Debashis Som had drawn his attention to the issue in March, April and June, but without any result. 

 Som has expressed concern over the rising number of manhole cover thefts and the consequent fatalities. 

 Since 1999, five persons lost their lives after falling into open manholes and gully pits. The toll includes one at CMC?s Palta Water Works. Besides, several hundreds have fractured their limbs.

 Officials point out that a similar spurt in theft of manhole covers was reported in 1998. According to them, the trend can be checked if stringent raids are carried out on shops and godowns of scrap iron dealers.

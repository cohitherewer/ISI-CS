 Foul-air fallout in Howrah 

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA 

 ?We can?t do this? was the response of a top official of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) to a circular by the district magistrate, asking the civic body to assess the industrial pollution level in the district and send her a report within two weeks. 

 District magistrate Nandini Chakraborty issued the circular a couple of days ago, asking the civic body to provide details of polluting industries in the report.

 ?I have asked the HMC to focus on Ghusuri, in Liluah. Lots of complaints regarding industrial pollution are reaching my office. We want to assess the industrial pollution scenario in the district,? she said. 

 ?We will decide on a course of action after reading the report,? she added.

 Getting the report, however, might prove to be difficult.

 ?Dumping everything on the HMC is not a good practice. We neither have the infrastructure nor the manpower to conduct such a study,? the HMC official said. 

 Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee concurred. He, however, added that the civic body would discuss the option of seeking help from the health and conservancy departments. 

 The West Bengal Pollution Control Board?s latest annual report (2002-2003) presents a grave picture of industrial pollution in Howrah.

 According to an official of the board, foundries in Howrah and Liluah are causing a great deal of pollution.

 ?We divide the industries according to their contribution to the overall pollution and categorise them under Red, Orange and Green groups,? he explained.

 Industries that get the Red tag are the most polluting. Industries with the Orange and Green tags are categorised as moderately-polluting and non-polluting, respectively.

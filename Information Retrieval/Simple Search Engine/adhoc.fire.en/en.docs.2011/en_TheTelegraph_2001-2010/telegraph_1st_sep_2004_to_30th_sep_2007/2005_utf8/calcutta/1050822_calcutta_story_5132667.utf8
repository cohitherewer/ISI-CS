 Bihar goons safe in city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Around 60 gangsters from Bihar ? comprising hired killers, dacoits and extortionists ? have been camping in the city for the past few months.

 The startling piece of information has come from Bihar police, who have requested their counterparts here to collect intelligence on the criminals. Several police teams from Bihar had come to Calcutta and raided probable hideouts in search of the criminals. But each time, they returned empty-handed.

 ?We are preparing a list of criminals from Bihar hiding in the city. Both the anti-dacoity and anti-rowdy squads have been pressed into action for this,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department.

 While gathering information on the gangsters, police have come to know that Bihar-based crimelord Shan Ali Khan, now lodged in Presidency jail, has been operating his network both in Calcutta and his home state. 

 ?Rafique Alam is his closest aide. Khan?s men in the city are extorting money from businessmen. In Bihar, they are fighting Ranvir Sena, an outfit involved in several mass killings,? said a detective department officer.

 Khan was arrested after he had committed two crimes in Calcutta in 2001. ?He had murdered a businessman in Kidderpore and looted several lakhs from his shop. After a few months, he had robbed Rs 5 lakh from an office on Hemanta Basu Sarani,? the officer added.

 A few months ago, New Market police station had arrested Mohammad Saikul and Mohammad Nessar in connection with an abduction and a murder in Roh, Bihar. A posse of policemen from Roh had then come to the city to take custody of the two. Before leaving, the team informed the city force that six other members of the gang were still in the city.

 According to police, criminals from Bihar find safe havens in Jorasanko, Posta, New Market, Watgunge and Garden Reach. ?We are facing problems in identifying and arresting them, as their names do not figure on our list of criminals. We do not even know what they look like,? said a sleuth.

Colonel Sanders Original Recipe chicken made with the secret blend of 11 herbs and spices is here. The magic formula that remains a closely guarded secret, locked away in a safe in Louisville, Kentucky, has finally made it to Calcutta. Eastern Indias maiden KFC outlet was unveiled with fanfare at City Centre on Wednesday, with the promise of more mouth-watering fare in the offing.

 We feel Calcutta is rocking and absolutely ready for its first KFC. This culturally active and intellectually evolved city has seen encouraging growth in the past few years and the extremely proactive government has been sending out positive signals to the retail fraternity, Sharanita Keswani, director KFC marketing, told Goodlife.

 The 70-seater Salt Lake outlet, inaugurated in the presence of actress Konkona Sen Sharma and children from CRY (Child Relief and You), expects an average daily footfall in hundreds, with a sharp-focus on youth.

 Our effort is to create a lively in-store ambience through a clutch of events and bubbly co-branding promos, contests and free gifts ? a conveyor belt of excitement, Keswani added.

 The chain, which is actively scouting for other sites in town, has plans to unfurl its second outlet somewhere in south Calcutta in the next six to seven months.

 After that, we will take it as it comes, but we are confident KFC will share a wonderful rapport with this food-loving city, she said.

 The signature chicken products on offer include Hot amp; Crispy Chicken, Original Recipe Chicken and Zinger Burger ? a zingy, spicy, crispy whole fillet of chicken in an oven-fresh sesame bun.

 The Colonel Burger flavoured with special herbs, the fusion Chicken Tikka Wrap Roll and Crispy Chicken Strips are some of the other chicken delights one can dig into.

 The fare, always served in a minute, has a fair share of vegetarian items as well, cooked in separate utensils using separate cooking oils.

 Vegetarians can choose from Veggie De-lite, Veg Crispy and Veggie Feast burgers, Paneer Tikka Wrap Roll, Veg Fingers, Veg Thali and side dishes like spicy curry, pepper rice and fresh green salad.

 KFC will operate its restaurant through franchisee Devyani International Pvt Ltd, also franchisee for sister concern Pizza Hut in the North and the East.

 We are excited to be here with a new brand. The response to Pizza Hut has been enthusiastic and we hope to replicate that buoyancy with KFC, said franchisee head Virag Joshi.

 With a pronounced emphasis on students and young professionals, Keswani promised attractive pricing options ? chicken and vegetarian burgers starting at Rs 23 and Rs 25 respectively, and very reasonably priced combo meals. 

 KFC has also brought to Calcutta its internationally benchmarked operations and procedures, training programmes, best practices and customer mania tools.

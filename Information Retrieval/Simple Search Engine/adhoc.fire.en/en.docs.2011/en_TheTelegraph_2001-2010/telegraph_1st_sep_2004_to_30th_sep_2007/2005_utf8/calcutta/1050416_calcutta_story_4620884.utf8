The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

All that maketh Nava Varsha

Beyond the formal trappings of religion, these are the 

rituals to observe on Poila Baisakh, Sudeshna Banerjee reports

So, 1412 arrived. Tip-toeing into most corners of 

town, marching elsewhere with new-found vigour. Park Street, the centre of celebration 

in cosmopolitan Calcutta, this year lit itself up in fairy lights, like it does 

in the Christmas-New Year week. Every food stop, with or without a star to show 

for its culinary prowess, announced a Bengali spread to woo the crowd, all too 

happy to seize the moment to eat, drink and be merry. And guess what? According 

to The Park authorities, over the past four-five years Poila Baisakh has emerged 

as a major money-spinner, with revenues increasing 25-30 per cent every year. 

This is the day when the babu is reborn. The dhoti-punjabi, spotless and 

starched, preserved through the year, declares the sartorial triumph of all things 

Bengali.

Yet there is more to Poila Baisakh than sudden remembrance 

of things past; certain traditions that go back beyond the here and now, time-honoured 

and true to heart. And then there are certain objects that have borne witness 

to these little rituals and remain innate to the birth of Baisakh.

Khata

Aaji jar jiboner kotha tuchchhotamo, Sedin sonabe 

taha kobitwer samo. Promothonath Bishi penned these lines in 1963 at Mitra 

Ghosh Publishers on the first page of what he christened Kheyalkhushir Khata. 

This khata became the Poila Baisakh jottings volume, compiled over the 

years at the College Street address. Another such khata came into existence 

at the neighbouring Dey?s Publishing in 1981. 

The Bengali New Year festivities at College Street 

date back decades. Recalls Syed Mujtaba Siraj: ?Authors would drop in at the bookshops, 

as would buyers and agents. Food packets would be distributed. The early hotspots 

for such gatherings were MC Sirkar, Bengal Publishers and Prakash Bhavan. Shirshendu 

(Mukhopadhyay), Shyamal (Gangopadhyay), Atin (Bandyopadhyay) and I were the regulars.?

The Nava Varsha gathering, which Sunitikumar Chattopadhyay 

used to call his ?muri club adda?, has given birth to many impromptu 

utterances preserved in the khata at the publishers?. Ashapurna Devi?s 

lines (in the Mitra Ghosh diary) are worth quoting: Bhebechhilam sheshe elam, 

porlam lokshane, labh lokshan kothay ghote kei ba sheta jane. From good wishes 

to worries about advanced age to comments on topical issues ? the authors? ink 

traverses every sentiment during this annual visit to the publisher. 

Adda

It is the palatial houses of north Calcutta that over 

the years have been witness to gatherings that embody the rejuvenation of the 

Bengali identity. At Batakrishno Dham, the ancestral house of B.K. Pal on Sovabazar 

Street, an adda was organised for those who perhaps cherish the day more than 

their descendants ? the senior citizens. More than a hundred people gathered on 

Friday in the first floor hall. The old wall-to-wall carpet, preserved with naphthalene 

and tobacco leaves, was brought out. The monogram BKP on it as well as on the 

glass window bore witness to the years when the family would host the Poila Baisakh 

adda. ?Sweets from the vien, reading of the Gita alongside song and poetry, 

a rifle-bearing durwan, people spilling on to the verandah? such was the day,? 

recalls Anup Pal, the third son in the current generation. 

Today, the family is happy to see outside organisations 

hosting similar programmes on the premises, with Medical Bank doing the honours 

this year. As the eyes twinkled and the voices came to life, Nava Varsha celebrations 

of childhood were recounted and changing trends chronicled, all under the chandelier.

Bindhyabasini Debi, all of a century old, was beyond 

all this. ?E monihar amay nahi saajey,? she sang without accompaniments.

Cashbox

A wooden box. Stern and squat. This is what holds 

centrestage at Adi Dhakeswari Bastralaya on Nava Varsha. ?This is the cashbox 

with which my grandfather Khetramohan Saha started the business in Patuatuli, 

Dhaka,? Sanjay Saha looks fondly at the structure, on which Ganesha and Lakshmi 

idols have been placed for worship.

When the family left before Partition, the Dhaka shop 

was confiscated as alien property. But the box came with them, gracing the Gariahat 

sari shop.

The box stays locked. No one knows what is preserved 

within. The shop is doing well. So no one wants to take a peek either. Benedictions 

have been sought at the Kalighat temple at dawn with the new accounts book (halkhata). 

But back at the shop it is the cashbox that counts. To ensure the flow of funds 

through the year.

Goalpost

?May the trophies keep rolling in.? The wishes, some 

silent, some vociferous, rent the Maidan air on Poila Baisakh morning as all football 

clubs worth their jersey colours took the field ? to worship the goalpost. 

A football receives as many offerings of flowers and 

bel leaves as does the Narayan shila. Then comes the ritual of a 

shot at goal.

?Our coach (Subhas Bhowmick) shot in two this morning. 

That is why perhaps the team scored twice today,? beams Debabrata Sarkar, executive 

committee member of East Bengal Club, after the win over Churchill Brothers.

The rituals count, after all!

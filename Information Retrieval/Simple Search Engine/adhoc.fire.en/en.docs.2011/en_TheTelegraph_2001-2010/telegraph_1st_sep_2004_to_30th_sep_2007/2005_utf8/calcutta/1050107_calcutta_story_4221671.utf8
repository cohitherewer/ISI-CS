 Preserve identity to save schools 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After identifying the challenges facing them in the new millennium, principals of Anglo-Indian schools on Thursday pledged to make the best of the qualities of children from the community.

 The principals, attending a four-day meet at Loreto House, were of the opinion that with more and more Anglo-Indians migrating to other countries, the best way to maintain the identity of their schools was to offer the maximum support to the ?very few? students from the community.

 ?In order to retain the character of our schools, it is important to have adequate numbers of Anglo-Indian children and staff. Our community must produce good students. Otherwise, there won?t be anyone to provide leadership in maintaining the identity of our education system,? said Gillian Rosemary Hart, principal of Welland Gouldsmith School and MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community of the state.

 During a presentation on ?the role of heads of Anglo-Indian schools in the new millennium?, Hart placed before the 130 participating principals a host of questions.

 ?Are we, in the multiplicity of daily problems and demands, forgetting the Anglo-Indian child altogether?? she asked.

 Hart regretted the fact that the 10 per cent of seats reserved in the schools for Anglo-Indian children are rarely filled.

 She urged teachers to offer more attention to the weak and underprivileged children coming from the community.

 T.W. Philips, secretary and treasurer of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools in India and principal of Wynberg School, Mussoorie, said that the schools were finding it difficult to fill up posts with qualified candidates from the community. He attributed the problem to emigration. 

 ?As of now, we have not had a problem, as non-Anglo-Indian principals and teachers are performing very well and are running the schools efficiently throughout the country,? Philips said.

 During Thursday?s parleys, the heads also analysed a host of questions relating to the improvement of the Anglo-Indian education system in the country.

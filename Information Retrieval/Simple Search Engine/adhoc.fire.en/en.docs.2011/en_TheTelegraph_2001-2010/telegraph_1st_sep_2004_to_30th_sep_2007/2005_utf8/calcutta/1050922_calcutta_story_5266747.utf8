 Watchdog whip on immersions

 KINSUK BASU

 The Hooghly banks, especially the ghats, will not resemble a garbage dump after the immersion of Durga idols this year ? but only if the civic bodies care to carry out a directive of the pollution control board.

 The environment watchdog, besides taking steps to prevent sound pollution during the Puja, has issued a whip to a string of civic bodies that waste left behind at ghats during immersion is cleared within 48 hours.

 Containers or vats will be placed at the ghats for organisers to dump puja waste, including flowers and leaves.

 A copy of the order has been sent to the city police headquarters in Lalbazar, as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is one of the agencies issued the directive. 

 All civic bodies have been asked to submit reports on the steps taken to implement the order.

 ?We want to ensure the quality of water in the Hooghly does not deteriorate after the Pujas,? said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the pollution control board.

 ?Waste, including bio-waste, is dumped indiscriminately on the banks during immersions. We want them to be removed within 48 hours. We have also suggested that the civic bodies charge a token amount from the organisers for the job,? he added.

 The order to the CMC states that immersion will be allowed only at designated ghats. Last year, the board had found that several organisers had immersed idols at ghats other than the ones marked for the purpose.

 On Wednesday, CMC representatives met officials of Calcutta Port Trust and other agencies to chalk out ways to enforce the board order.

 ?We have agreed to make some arrangements so that waste is not dumped at ghats,? said Sushil Sharma, mayoral council member (lighting). ?We?ll try to ensure that waste like plastic is not left behind.?

 As for sound pollution, the board has asked police to brief organisers on the sound limiters in microphones. Any violation, the board has warned, will invite severe penalty.

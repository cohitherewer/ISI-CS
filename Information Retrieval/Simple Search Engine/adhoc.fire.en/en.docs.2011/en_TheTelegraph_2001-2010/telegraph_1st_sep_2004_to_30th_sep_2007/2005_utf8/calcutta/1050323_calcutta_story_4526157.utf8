The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two boys held for thievery

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Mantu Mondal, 11, and Kalia Das, 12, are fast friends. Their bonding goes much beyond fun and games ? they rob people for a living by sprinkling itching powder on their necks. The two are kepmaars, in police parlance.

 On Tuesday, Mantu and Kalia were trailing a man who had withdrawn money from the United Bank of India branch in Taratala when cops nabbed them, along with 19-year-old Raju. 

 ?Ever since a robbery outside the bank in February, we have been on the lookout for the duo. Plainclothesmen took the two in custody while they were following a target on Tuesday,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (port). 

 According to police records, in February, Mantu and Kalia had the powder on a man?s neck and fled with his bag, containing Rs 7,000, from outside the bank.

 Both are residents of Madrasipara, in Bandel. Police said they used to take a train to the city about thrice a week and operate in Howrah, Sealdah, Dum Dum and Majherhat.

 Mantu and Kalia have confessed to robbing a person of his belongings at Dum Dum station a few months ago, police said.

 Their biggest operation was conducted outside the CESC office in Taratala in November, police said. The modus operandi was almost the same.

 The two were paid between Rs 100 and Rs 200 for each robbery. The police are on the lookout for the middle-aged man under whose instructions Manoj and Kalia operated.

 ?The gangleader would mark the target and disappear from the spot,? said a police officer. Police stations in the city have been asked to report similar robberies in their area.

 Modern mindscapes

 The need for man?s communion with nature is clearly felt in the paintings of Shyam Kanu and Jayita Borthakur. Beauty and the Beast, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, drawings and sculptures by the duo, is an expression of their effort to create through art, a common space where man can coexist in harmony with his natural surroundings. Breaking fresh ground in the new series of his paintings (Portraits of 21st Century), Shyam Kanu reveals himself as a master mindscape artist. Featuring portraits depicting the chaotic disorder of the human brain, which is preoccupied with complicated electronic gadgets, his works betray his own sadness at modern man?s over-dependence on technology. The other series, Body and the Birds, convey his deep-seated feeling that man and nature need each other to thrive in this universe. Painted in lyrical forms and colours, Jayita Borthakur?s works in oil (Fish, picture above) appear to be the portrayal of a woman?s mind in many moods.

 Event: Paintings, drawings and sculptures by Shyam Kanu and Jayita Borthakur

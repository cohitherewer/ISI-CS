 Aishwarya Rai?s manner of draping the traditional Bengali sari in Devdas made the style a rage at weddings throughout the country. Preity Zinta?s frizzy locks in Dil Chahta Hai saw girls going curly and straight hair becoming something of a fashion fiasco. And Rani Mukherjee?s kohl-rimmed eyes in Chalte Chalte brought the kajal back in sight and sparked off the trend of dark smudgy eyes and pale lips. The influence of Bollywood on fashion trends ? be it clothes, make-up or hairstyles ? is not a new phenomenon. And the latest style sector to be hit by filmi fashion is jewellery.

 While costume jewellery has been influenced by films on various occasions in the past, the trend of movies inspiring designs of real ornaments started with Devdas. And the latest Bollywood blockbuster to find favour with jewellery designers seems to be the Preity Zinta-Shah Rukh Khan starrer Veer-Zaara.

 Says Premendu Sadhukhan, sales-in-charge of Anjali Jewellers: ?The demand for kundan jewellery suddenly increased after Devdas was released. And the trend is still going strong. Even Bengalis are opting for kundan jewellery set on gold for weddings.? The demand for the Devdas-look in ornaments even prompted the store to come up with a range of costume jewellery designed on the same lines, where semi-precious stones replaced kundan and a blend of copper and gold has been used instead of pure gold. 

 ?We had designed a major part of the jewellery for Rituparno Ghosh?s Chokher Bali and recently for the tele-serial Sahib Biwi Gulam on Sahara Manoranjan. We have similar pieces up for sale at our store,? adds Sadhukan. So, there is baju bandh, rani haar, poshaki haar and firpo bala that have been inspired by similar pieces in Chokher Bali, while heavy kundan jewellery with elaborate waistbands draw from the designs used in Sahib Biwi Gulam.

 Diagold, a city-based jewellery brand with an outlet in City Centre, recently launched a line of Veer-Zaara jewellery inspired by the ornaments flaunted by Preity and Kiron Kher in the movie. The designer of the line, Meenakshi Modi says: ?The jewellery worn by the characters in Veer-Zaara were breathtakingly beautiful. I was so struck by the beauty that I decided to design a line inspired by the look. It?s basically jadau jewellery with a contemporary look to suit the taste of the modern woman.?

 The collection improvises on traditional jadau jewellery, with diamonds and other precious stones like emeralds, rubies, sapphires and amethysts set on a base of 24 karat gold. The line is available in two parts ? a range of heavy wedding jewellery influenced by those flaunted by Preity and a lighter range that is inspired by the jewels sported by Kher.

 ?Usually jadau is very heavy and can be worn to weddings or special functions only. But the kind of simple and smart designs that Kiron was wearing in the film are suitable for regular use as well. I have designed a similar line where I have modernised the jewellery to a large extent. For the heavier and more exotic wedding sets I have drawn inspiration from Preity?s ornaments,? says Meenakshi. The sets comprise neckpieces and earrings made of uncut diamonds and precious stones as well as South Sea pearls. They can be teamed with bangles and rings made of gold and studded with diamonds and semi-precious and precious stones.

 Brinda Ganguly Sirkar, jewellery designer of A. Sirkar, sums up: ?In recent times films have had a major influence on jewellery designs. Certain pieces like jhumkas dangling from bangles and chains with geometric designs have come from films. Also, traditional jewels like armlets and earrings with chain extensions made a comeback after they were showcased in movies.?

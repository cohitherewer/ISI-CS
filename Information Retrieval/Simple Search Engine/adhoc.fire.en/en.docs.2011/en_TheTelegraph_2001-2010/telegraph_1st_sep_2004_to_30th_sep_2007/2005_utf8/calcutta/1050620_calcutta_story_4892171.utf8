The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Nicole Kidman 

You?re sharp, ready for challenges and determined to win. You?re capable of gaining honour and recognition. You are sensitive and loving but uncomfortable with open displays of affection. You enjoy being with older and mature people. You may not have many friends, but you?re close to the few you have. You are not comfortable discussing your financial affairs. ? Kusum Bhandari

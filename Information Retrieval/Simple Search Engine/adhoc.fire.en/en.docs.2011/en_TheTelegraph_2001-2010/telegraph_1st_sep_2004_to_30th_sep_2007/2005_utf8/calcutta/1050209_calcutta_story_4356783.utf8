The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Penning of our dreams

 I saw a dream and such things happened?

 That?s what Amitabh and Rekha would have sung to each other had Silsila been dubbed in English. Luckily, Javed Akhtar?s new book Talking Songs is not just English translations of 60 of his songs. It also features him in conversation with Nasreen Munni Kabir, better known for his books and documentaries on Bollywood.

 Interestingly, the 60 songs are not Javed?s favourites. In Calcutta on Saturday to launch the book at Crossword bookstore, the writer was candid about the target readership of this new publication. 

 ?Nasreen kept telling me that Bollywood is huge in the West. Even our earlier book, Talking Films, was a big draw and found its place at most film libraries in their universities and colleges. So we thought of coming up with a book on Hindi film songs. They are chosen so as to present to the innocuous reader the entire range that a Hindi film song offers ? ghazal, qawwali, romantic number, song of separation, patriotic track, etc.?

 The book, divided into two parts, does offer a broad overview on the different thought-processes that Akhtar underwent while penning certain songs. But it is the seven-page foreword by wife Shabana Azmi that makes for the most fascinating of reads. She talks about how within Akhtar resides ?the modern and the traditional? and how he switches at will from the ?city person? to the ?small-town boy?.

 It goes on to offer interesting insights into the man. ?He can be philosophical without being pedantic, breezy without being trivial and sensitive without being sentimental,? writes Shabana. She also mentions delightful anecdotes like how the busiest Bollywood lyricist needs just unlined cheap fullscape double sheet to write on. An ordinary ballpoint pen or a pencil stub will do for him, even though Shabana?s father, the great Kaifi Azmi, needed a Mont Blanc to pen his thoughts.

Akhtar, who first shot to fame with his powerful screenplays 

in collaboration with Salim Khan, admitted that perhaps it was a writer?s block 

that made him more a lyricist than a storyteller. ?I didn?t have a story idea 

for a long time till I wrote Lakshya (picture below) for Farhan. If that 

is what writer?s block is then I did suffer it. But now I am writing scripts again 

? a new one in fact. It?s too early to talk about it, but Farhan may not direct 

it since he has written something himself. So let?s see who I can sell my new 

script to,? laughed the man who has bagged five National awards.

 It?s incredible to know that Akhtar?s favourite songs are largely unknown numbers. ?When some of your children do well in life, you don?t think about them and just let them be. You are only worried and thoughtful about the kids who haven?t done that well. Similarly, on those songs of mine which have become big hits ? from 1942: A Love Story to Refugee to Border ? I have nothing to say. People know about them. But songs like Shishe se bani ek ladki in Dastak deserved to be heard more.?

The man also bears no grudge against any music director. 

?Usually they give me a composition and then I write the song accordingly. But 

in many instances, I have been asked to write first and then they have set the 

words to tune. And they have done well. People like A.R. Rahman, Anu Malik, Jatin-Lalit 

? they are all extremely talented and that?s why they are there. They are also 

so fast in coming up with tunes.?

 Having produced recent chartbusters like the songs from Swades and Veer-Zaara, Akhtar is looking forward to the music of Ketan Mehta?s The Rising. ?Rahman has really done a very good job and the music should do well. While the songs are idealistic, they are not too preachy.?

 But why do his songs like Main hoon na and Main yahan hoon involve the presence of an external force always there to help out lost souls? A pause and a thought later: ?Hmmm, it?s obviously in the context of the film. But yes they also have to outlive the film. So they stay years after the films are gone??

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Run, sweat, win a prize for a noble cause

 - Mini-marathon fundraiser for poor kids? school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If you are fleet of foot and wish to contribute to a cause, head for Park Circus Maidan this Sunday morning, to take part in a five-and-a-half-km run to raise funds for a school for slum children. 

 The City of Joy Run, organised by Round Table India, in association with Exide and the NGO Awaaz ? A Voice for the Voiceless, is scheduled for February 20, from 7 to 8.30 am. 

 It will kick off from the Park Circus-AJC Bose Road crossing, continue past the race course and back, and finish at the front gate of Victoria Memorial.

 Around 4,000 tickets have already been sold, at Rs 100 for adults and Rs 50 for children. 

 Although the race is ?choc-a-bloc?, no one will be turned away, even at the last minute. 

 The proceeds will be donated to a school for underprivileged children in Tiljala, run by Awaaz, which works with marginalised women and kids.

 ?We at Round Table have a national education campaign, which aims at educating one million children by 2010. Since the launch in 2000, we have already attained 25 per cent of the target. We thought this was a good way of contributing to the cause, especially since Awaaz has similar goals,? explained Prashant Jalan, area vice-chairman of Round Table and convener of the run. 

 The idea was to get people to ?sweat it out? for the cause.

 ?When the NGO asked us whether we could help them raise funds, we readily agreed, since this is a noble cause. In cities like Mumbai, over a lakh people participate in such fundraisers. We expect to draw a lot of people, and hopefully we, too, will be able to generate funds,? said Satyabrata Ganguly, chairman of Exide, sponsors of the event. ?Sourav Ganguly has promised to come if he is in the city,? he added.

 A galaxy of stars and celebs have also signed up for the cause. The list includes Russi Mody, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Raima Sen, June, Prosenjit, P.K. Banerjee, Mithun Chakraborty, Bikram Ghosh, Jishu Sengupta, Nelanjanaa, Saba Karim, Arindam Sil, Tanmoy Bose, Devang Gandhi and Joydeep Mukherjee. 

 The healthy way of raising money has sheriff Chuni Goswami hooked. ?It?s a very good effort. As sheriff, I feel I should be a part of this. I always urge young people to run regularly,? he said. 

 Rahul Bose, who will be in town to dub for a film, has also registered for the run.

 The bonus for the toil is prizes worth Rs 1 lakh for the fastest three who cross the finish line.

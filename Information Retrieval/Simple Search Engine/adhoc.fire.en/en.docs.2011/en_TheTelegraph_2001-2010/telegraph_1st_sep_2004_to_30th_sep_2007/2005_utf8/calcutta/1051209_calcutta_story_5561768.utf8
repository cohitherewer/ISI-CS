 The chilly Sunday evening of December 4 saw the RCGC lawns playing host to ReGen Miss Cinderella 2005 beauty contest.

 The entertainment quotient of the show was very high with every round being punctuated by performances galore ? be it in the form of fashion or dance sequences.

 The show began on a classical note with dancers swaying to shlokas and mantras, but then soon progressed to foot-tapping chartbusters. 

 The highlight of the evening was, of course, Mumbai-based Zabyn Khan of Chocolate, Dus and Ek Haseena Ek Khiladi item-number fame, who regaled audiences with her hot moves to songs like Woh lamhey and Deedar de.

 The panel of judges boasted names like photographer Sanat Ghosh, radio jockey Jimmy Tangree, designer Sunipa Samadder, actress Sayantani, musician Aninda of Chandrabindoo, models Sreshthaa Paul and Sheena Chauhan, make-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar and Bangladesh high commission first cultural secretary A.T.M. Manimul Haq. The celeb quotient was further upped by the presence of actress June, who compered the first half of the contest. 

 Dipannita was adjudged Miss Cinderella 2005, while the first and second runners-up were Nandini and Beauty.

 With national footwear chain Shoe Line setting up shop in the city from this week, women have an exclusive store to go to for their accessory needs.

 The store at 2A, Justice Dwarka Nath Road, off Elgin Road, houses a wide variety of footwear like court shoes, sandals, mojris, mules and boots, sourced from different parts of India and Europe. The bridal collection of stilettos in stunning gold, silver and bronze steals the show.

 Bags in various shapes, sizes and colours include formal ones for the boardroom in sober colours, party pouches in silk and satin, and jute bags for the campus crowd. Then there are the sequinned bridal bags studded with semi-precious stones.

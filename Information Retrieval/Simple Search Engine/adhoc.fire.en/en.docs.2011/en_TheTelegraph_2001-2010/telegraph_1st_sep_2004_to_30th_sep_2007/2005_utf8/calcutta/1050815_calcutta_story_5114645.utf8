The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Funds delay project push

 BISWAJIBAN MAJUMDAR, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality, met readers of The Telegraph in his office to answer their queries. Participants included Reba Dutta, Rathin Kumar Saha, Bula Mukherjee, Bijit Chowdhury, Dilip Kumar Das, Dinesh Chandra Poddar and Tapas Sengupta

Bula Mukherjee: I am a resident of FE block. The park in the block and its adjacent roads are not properly lit. The foliage also obstructs the dim street lights, making things worse. With thefts and other crimes on the rise, we feel insecure. Can the municipality help?

 It is true that compared to Calcutta, street lights in Salt Lake are not as powerful. But the township seems gloomy after nightfall due to other reasons as well. Salt Lake being a planned township, the shops aren?t scattered everywhere, so the accompanying bustle and the background light is missing. The residents also prefer to keep their doors and windows shut, thus not letting out any light. The prolific growth of trees makes the township even darker.

 I have discussed the issue with finance minister Asim Dasgupta. To light up the 70 parks in Salt Lake with sodium vapour lamps, the municipality would need to spend Rs 1 crore. It would cost about Rs 50 lakh to clear the bushes and trim the trees.

 The finance minister has asked me to send a detailed proposal to the urban development department. We will state how much we can shell out and he has promised to arrange for the rest of the funds.

 Funds crunch is delaying the project. To repair roads we have to spend Rs 6.5 crore annually, while our income from property taxes is Rs 4.5 crore. 

Rathin Kumar Saha: The basic rule of building construction is to leave of at least three feet from the boundary wall, on all sides. But many house-owners are constructing servant quarters and toilets for them at the back of the building, in violation of the rule. Such a practice is also causing serious problems for the neighbours. What is the municipality doing regarding this?

 Building rules in a planned city are stringent and one cannot encroach upon the mandatory open space, whether on the front or back. But about half the buildings in Salt Lake have such illegal constructions. I won?t say all the constructions are unnecessary or deliberate. Sometimes such violation is triggered by genuine need ? like someone letting a family take shelter in the garage. In such cases, we neither support nor oppose the violation of rules.

 Another problem is that most plots are quite small, where the owners cannot provide space for the domestic helps. So the last municipal board planned to allow a 70-sq ft room on the roofs of the houses. There was a proposal to allow house-owners to add another floor. The civic polls were round the corner then and no decision was eventually taken.

 The proposal has now been sent to the urban development department. Once it?s approved, we can implement the rules strictly. In some cases, the municipality demolishes unauthorised constructions after inspection. But they are rebuilt. We do not have enough manpower to keep a strict vigil.

Bula Mukherjee: Garbage spills over from the vat along the road connecting tank no. 12 with Karunamoyee. This has been a common sight for many areas.

 For the past 16 years, I have been saying that the vats should be removed. Salt Lake might be a planned township, but there is no strategy for garbage disposal. This is very sad. Since 1982, the garbage is being dumped at Mollar Bheri. The West Bengal Pollution Control Board has now told us that it is a wetland and we cannot dump garbage there. We have drawn up a blueprint to solve the problem. The previous board had, in fact, started the process by discussing the matter with the CMDA and urban development department. As per the new plan, garbage will be collected from door to door. Also, the perishable, organic waste will be segregated at the source for easy disposal.

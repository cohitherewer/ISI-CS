The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Neighbours, kin shattered

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Posta, Sunday, 8 am: Mini Kanoria, 24, who was ?abducted? on Saturday evening, was having tea and snacks in a small room above a godown in Posta along with ?husband? Mohit Srivastava and two of his friends. She was in a red salwar and black kameez. 

 For her and Mohit, who had been residents of the same apartment block in Howrah, Saturday was the first night they spent together since their ?secret? marriage on November 22. 

 Then, the knocks. A friend opened the door. Within seconds, the room was full of cops and the four were rounded up.

Howrah, Sunday, 5.30 PM: ? Our world has crumbled. 

We don?t want to discuss this now. All the arrangements for my brother?s wedding 

were ready,? cried Sandip, younger brother of Vikas Khaitan, who was to marry 

Mini on December 15 (picture of wedding card on left by Amit Datta).

 The Khaitans and the Kanorias, of Howrah?s Khetra Gupta Lane and Nityadhan Mukherjee Lane, respectively, were ready for the marriage when Saturday?s ?abduction? of Mini by her ?registered? husband and his friends shattered their worlds. 

 The Khaitans had started distributing invitation cards. Metro saw one of them: a multi-page affair in calligraphic fonts. It spoke of the wealth and status of the family. 

 ?The family has already spent lakhs. As far as I know, a club on Belvedere Road in Howrah had been rented for the ceremony. The relatives had started pouring in,? disclosed a neighbour. ?The guest list was around 500,? revealed brother Sandip. 

 The Kanorias remained elusive. After much persuasion, a neighbour said on condition of anonymity that the Khaitans did not approve of the match as Mohit held a lesser station, both socially and economically. Besides, she said, Mini was two years older than him.

 Mohit?s apartment was locked. While his neighbours expressed disbelief, Vikas?s were too anxious to see the Khaitans get back to normal.

 ?I fail to understand why Mini went through this drama. Both she and Mohit were adults. Their action has tarnished the image of two respectable families,? said a neighbour of Vikas.

 Disputes, stability amp; amity in trading

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS), in association with the WTO Secretariat (Geneva) and the Centre for Studies in WTO Law, has organised an advanced regional seminar on the WTO dispute settlement system for Asian and Pacific economics, starting Monday morning. 

 A key objective of the five-day seminar would be to identify ways to provide increased stability and security to multi-lateral trading systems. 

 B.S. Chimni, director, NUJS, said: ?There has to be compulsory dispute settlement. We have moved away from the GATT dispute resolution system. Developing countries and economies need to have a better understanding of the distinction between mandatory and discretionary measures of solving trade disputes. The very fact that this system is based on compulsory third-party dispute settlement puts forward its uniqueness in the history of international relations.?

 The first of its kind to be organised by the WTO Secretariat (Geneva) in India, this seminar has drawn government officials from various South Asian countries, like China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Chinese Taipei and Singapore. 

 With the free market economy increasingly coming into play in most Asian economies, intellectual property rights (IPR) has assumed a greater role. With IPR, trade relations between nations has increased manifold, thereby leading to disputes. 

 Law minister of Bengal Nishith Adhikari said: ?The Indian Constitution considers dispute settlement to be an intrinsic part of justice.? 

 Yves Renouf, councillor of legal affairs, WTO, said: ?The adoption of the negative or reverse consensus principle, that leads to the automatic adoption of the panel, and the appellate body reports lead to a more comprehensive and transparent way of settlement of disputes.?

 A common theme of the seminar, enunciated by all the speakers, was that developing countries should be accorded special attention. ?The multi-lateral trading system must not benefit the developed economies only. The rich trading countries must not derive an undue advantage,? observed Adhikari.

 The law minister also enlightened the audience on the role played by Calcutta in the field of international trade. ?Bengal is the traditional seat for international trade. The British East India Company would be a prime example.?

 The introductory session was concluded by Renouf, who tried to put forward the importance of the system and its various achievements. ?A total of 302 cases that have been initiated by this system till date is sufficient indicator of its success. This seminar is aimed at capacity-building of the present member-countries on the working of this system.?

 The seminar is being held at Hotel Hindustan International, and will cover specific aspects of dispute settlement rules and procedures, as interpreted by the WTO panels and appellate body.

 A treasure called life

 Suspended between the milestones of birth and death is the expanse of time that we call life. Life presents us with a bouquet of emotions and experiences that makes us wiser and stronger so as to face it with greater courage and foresight. It also confronts us with its many mysteries so that we spend a large part of our lives contemplating the marvels, miracles and cataclysms of this universe. Yet, in trying to view it from a philosophical perspective, we unfortunately lose sight of God?s plan in bestowing upon mankind the gift of life. We miss out on living life to the fullest and enjoying the fruits of love, laughter and happiness that life showers upon us in glorious abundance. Based on a play by Luigi Pirandello and Krishna Sobti, this Theatron production helps us understand and appreciate the simple pleasures of life. It brings us closer to treasuring life?s experiences, no matter how trivial they may seem. A celebration of life and all that it stands for, it enables us to live every moment happily, for its own sake, and discover the sheer ecstasy and joy of just being alive. Direction: Saswati Biswas.

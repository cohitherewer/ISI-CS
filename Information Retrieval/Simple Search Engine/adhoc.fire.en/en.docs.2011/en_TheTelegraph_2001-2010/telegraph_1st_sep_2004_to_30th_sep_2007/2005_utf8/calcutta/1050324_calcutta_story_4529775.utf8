The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pre-monsoon spell chills

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A pre-monsoon shower, with gusty winds, cooled down the city on Wednesday evening. 

K.K. Chakraborty, acting deputy director-general at 

the regional meteorological centre at Alipore, said there may be rain on Thursday, 

too. ?Wednesday?s rain was more a pre-monsoon shower than a Nor?wester,? he said 

. Till 9 pm, 8.8 mm of rain was recorded.

 A low-pressure trough lay across Sikkim, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, north Orissa and south Bengal. ?This, along with a cyclonic circulation in the upper air, sucked in moisture from the Bay of Bengal and led to the cloud cover and rains,? he added. The maximum temperature on Wednesday was pegged at 32.8?C, two degrees below normal.

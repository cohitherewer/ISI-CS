The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Strokeless tag hit for a six

Eye on Calcutta

 Barry O'Brien

 A motivational speech works best when laced with real-life accounts. Sidhu is special as his stories are from his own experience

 When you?re around, you often go unnoticed; when you?re not, you are often missed! It happens in life; it certainly happens to the wife! 

 It?s happened to me. It?s been a couple of months since Ive kept ?an eye on Calcutta? and used a part of the newsprint allotted for this page. It feels good to know that some of you missed me; a few even wondered what had happened? No, you horrible gossip mongers, the editorial team and I had not fallen out and they didn?t have me kidnapped; neither did the wife and I fall out, for me to stage my own kidnapping; I was literally kidnapped ? spending a lot of time with the kids or just napping! 

 No kidding! I was doing the two things I enjoy doing most; but now that the kids have had enough of me and the naps have added enough around my waist, it?s time to get back to the real world of bylines, deadlines and waistlines. The last mentioned is the most difficult line of control since it involves self-control and abstinence from many a solid or liquid that you live for or die of! 

 At best, the wife is a Breezer and in terms of liquid preferences, we prefer to be poles apart. After weeks of hibernation and hunting Royal Stag at home ? I have moved up a notch from what for Directors has always been Special ? we recently attended a party hosted by the Teachers? school of thought. Though I do not scotch the principles they live by, malts have never melted in my mouth. Somehow, the patriotic taste buds only bloom when the flow is Indian angrezi. So, the attraction that evening at Taj Bengal had no liquid connotations ? it was the eagerness to find out, first hand, how solid Cyrus Broacha and Navjyot Sidhu were as entertainers and motivators. 

 It was up to these two achievers to ignite this prelude to the Teachers Achievement Awards and they did just that; but the night belonged to the sachcha sardar. The punny Parsi, a skilled one-line master and good for a couple of minutes before a song or a commercial break, was outplayed in every department of the game: originality, turn of phrase, delivery. If Cyrus was a colourful cocktail you enjoyed sipping but that left you searching for the punch, Sidhu swung like a pendulum from the wisdom and wit of an Old Monk to the charm and charisma of the ultimate Johnny Talker. Honestly, till that evening, in my book, Sidhu was no more than a vocal roller-coaster who often forgot to take his tablets to check regular bouts of verbal diarrhoea. 

 He is much better than that! At the risk of sounding a touch immodest, I believe I am a fairly skilled motivational speaker, particularly effective with young people; but Sidhu beats me hollow. To make a cricketing comparison: if I?m a Sidhu, he?s a Sachin! 

 I, too, speak to audiences for extended periods of time, like Sidhu did that night. I, too, speak from personal experience, but often have to refer to the likes of Karoly Takacs, the Hungarian soldier who lost his shooting-arm in a grenade explosion and came back to win gold medals in two successive Olympic Games, shooting with the other hand! But what makes Sidhu special is that his stories are all his own. Nothing?s borrowed! 

 By his own admission, Sidhu was a ?roadside Romeo? who would spend hours every day ?checking out the pretty girls?. He could actually tell you which locality they were from only by the colour and style of their salwars. After his father would wake him up every morning at 5 o?clock to go for a jog, he would bribe the servants to allow him to sleep in another room for a couple of hours. At about 7, he would ?come back? to his dad, having splashed water on his face and shirt. Sidhu Sr would feel sorry for his ?overworked beta? bathed in ?perspiration? and tell him to catch up on some sleep. The ?tired puttar? would catch a few more winks! 

 When I was a young journalist, cricket critic Rajan Bala was widely known for calling a spade, a shovel. It was around then that Mr Bala labelled Sidhu ?a strokeless wonder?. In those days that was enough to earn you a life sentence within the prison walls of Ranji Trophy, with almost no chance of parole. Predictably, we didn?t hear of Sidhu for four long years; till I saw a sardar hitting six after six at the selection nets before the Reliance Cup in 1987. I remember filing a copy mentioning that Sidhu would definitely make the team because he was hitting even Kapil out of the ground. My boss, Tiger Pataudi, asked me to look closely whether the sardar under the helmet was indeed the same ?strokeless sardar?. It was! The ?new? Sidhu went on to score five 50s in that World Cup ? a record! 

 I never got down to asking him how the transformation miracle took place, but I got the answer the other night, almost 20 years later. In fact, Sidhu made that the central peg of his talk. He told us about how he pasted the Bala judgement on his cupboard, took fresh guard and shed the shirker in him forever. Now, when his dad came to wake him up at 5 am, Sidhu was already out, rolling his personal pitch, having jogged a few rounds. 

 Now, the perspiration was real; though his bribing ways had not changed ? only the recipients and the reason had! He would spare a few bucks for local youngsters who would bowl to him late into the night. There were times when he batted past midnight in order to complete his daily target of 300 sixes. Often, his gloves would be soaked with blood at the end of a session. Little wonder then that the ?strokeless wonder? hit more sixes in international cricket than most! 

 Of course, it was not all serious! There were jokes flying around by the minute ? only this time the sardar jokes were by him, not on him. The shot of the evening was when Sidhu hooked Kapil Dev?s knowledge of the English language over the fence and admitted that the genius Jat had ?murdered? the treasure of Shaw and Shakespeare, after ?killing it a few times over?. But nothing, not even a galaxy of ?propah? journalists could frighten the genuine Jat from facing them at a press conference to be conducted in English. Sidhu says he tried to dissuade Kapil paaji, saying that it would be far more difficult than facing Jeff Thompson; but the gutsy Jat, who had faced the fastest bowlers without a helmet, was ready to take on the fastest talkers without a flinch. 

 The fourth estate came at him with: ?After Kapil, who? What about another fast bowler like Kapil? When will another Kapil be born?? 

 For all this, Kapil Dev ka jawab tha! He got to his feet, with: Okay, okay, no question more! My mother 62! My father gone! So no more Kapil Dev. No chance!?

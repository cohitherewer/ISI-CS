 The truth about painkiller

 - Biggest study on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 After Cox-II inhibitors, it?s time for the Ibuprofen and Naproxofen group of drugs to face the acid test on its safety standards and efficacy, especially if used on a long-term basis.

 In one of the biggest studies ever conducted recently, about three million patients? medication records were assessed by researchers from the University of Utah, USA, to check the incidence of perforations, ulcers and bleeding among patients regularly using Naproxofen (220mg) and Ibuprofen (200 mg) drugs. 

 These drugs are commonly known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

 And the result has been startling, to say the least, as the findings indicate that patients taking the twin drugs stand 2.5 to 2.74 times more chances of suffering serious gastro-intestinal (GI) problems. 

 It was found that in all cases, over-the-counter NSAIDs usage was associated with a statistically significant risk of serious GI tract illness.

 Reacting to the startling report just presented at the American College of Gastroenterology, Apurba Ghosh, director of the Institute of Child Health, said it was worrying that more and more doctors were prescribing such drugs, especially for children with a fever in the city. ?One must understand that paracetamols can be prescribed for fever and not NSAIDs as it is commonly used. We keep getting many children with serious GI tract problems, after regular use of NSAIDs,? said Ghosh.

 Although, nimesulide in a paediatric drop pack has been banned in the country, the suspensions and even tablets are regularly prescribed in the city by doctors for children. 

 ?Ibuprofen is one the most commonly prescribed drug for arthritis patients and with Cox II inhibitors (rofecoxib and valdecoxib) getting banned, NSAIDs have emerged as an effective pain killer. But what is more worrying is its misuse, especially among children,? Abhijit Chakraborty, deputy drug controller said on Monday.

 Another study conducted by the department of paediatrics, New York Medical College, found that dosages of Ibuprofen could result in significant bleeding, and ulcer formation in children. 

 ?The time has come for the medical community and patients alike to acknowledge that NSAIDs have shortcomings and in no way can be totally relied upon to provide safe relief from symptoms of fever and pain,? said Tarun Sahni, expert in general medicine at Apollo hospitals, New Delhi.

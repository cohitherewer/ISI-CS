The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor sop: tax slash on house rent

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 House-owners letting out premises will pay a lot less as property tax from the next fiscal.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s latest initiative will be unveiled in Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s coming budget, to be tabled on March 16, officials said.

 ?A large number of middle-class house-owners subsist on income from property rentals. They have long been pressing for some relief,? an official told Metro.

 The civic body now charges 40 per cent of the annual rental income as property tax, if the building is let out for domestic purposes. In case of a commercial let-out, the rate jumps to 60 per cent.

 In the next budget, the rates could be slashed to between six and 20 per cent. 

 The civic body, according to the proposed system, will charge a maximum of 20 per cent of the rental income of a building as property tax. Middle-class house-owners will be levied only six per cent.

 Besides the cut in property tax, the budget will also propose abolition of the ?corrupt practice? of calculating property tax on the basis of an arbitrary or a notional rent value of a premise. It looks set to be replaced by a ?unit-area value system? for each of the proposed four categories.

 Landed property will be classified on the basis of physical infrastructure, social services, income of the occupants and capital value of the land combined with the cost of construction. 

 The cost of construction will be determined following the Central public works department rate in 1998.

 The other significant determinants for property tax include age of the building (older structures will be taxed less; a graded formula has been evolved to link the rate with the age), occupancy status (lower tax for self-occupied buildings) and type of the structure (pucca, semi-pucca or kutcha).

 Welcoming the move, All Calcutta House-Owners? Association president Amar Mitra said: ?Better late than never. We have long been demanding a cut in property tax on houses let out on rent.? 

 Though the mayor refused to comment on the budget, he said, ?I believe the civic body should not claim a share of the rental income of a building as tax. It is the duty of the income-tax department.?

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and mayor Mukherjee both feel the present system has led to a rise in disputes and strengthening of the inspector raj. 

 Over 27,000 assessment-dispute cases of the civic body are pending before the municipal assessment tribunal, high court and the Supreme Court.

 Defending the tax-cut proposal, mayor Mukherjee said the civic body was guided by the principle of ?lesser tax but wider coverage?.

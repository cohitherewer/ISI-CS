 Thieves flee with temple ornaments

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Unidentified criminals broke into a Kali temple in Howrah town early on Wednesday and escaped with gold ornaments, said to be worth about Rs 1 lakh. About 1,500 devotees visit the temple every day.

 Police said the theft was reported from Hemnagar (Biradingi) Baroari Sri Sri Kali Temple at Biradingi, under the Dasnagar investigation centre of Jagachha police station.

 The temple?s committee member Ranjit Moulik said the sweeper of the temple, Parulbala Bhattacharya, came to the temple around 6.15 am and detected the theft. 

 The thieves had cut open the bolt of the temple door and taken away the ornaments on the 2.5-ft Kali idol.

 ?There were two pairs of anklets, two wristlets, two bangles, one crown and two ?tongues?. All were made of solid gold, worth about Rs 1 lakh,? Moulik said. 

 He immediately alerted the police and lodged a complaint with Jagachha police station.

 ?We have received a complaint. An investigation has been launched,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintend of police (town), Howrah.

 The temple is the only one dedicated to Kali in the area. It was established about 60 years ago, and has three smaller temples.

 These, respectively, house a Shivalinga, a Kali and Radha and Krishna idols.

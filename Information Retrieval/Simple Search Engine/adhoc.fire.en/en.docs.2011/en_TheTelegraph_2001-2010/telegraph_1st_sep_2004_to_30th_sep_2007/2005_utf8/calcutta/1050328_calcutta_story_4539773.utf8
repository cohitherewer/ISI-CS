 Calcutta?s oldest amusement park is getting ready to make a splash. A date of March 2006 has been set for a giant water park to come up at Nicco Park.

 Five acres have been earmarked, beside the bowling alley, for the Rs 6-crore mega ride, which boasts to be eastern India?s biggest wave pool. 

 ?We had plans since the inception for a water park, but were delaying it as we were not sure of its success at that point, mainly due to the orthodox mindset of Indians,? says Arijit Sengupta, CEO and director, Nicco Parks and Resorts.

 But a survey has revealed that Calcutta is now eager to wade in, provided three parameters are in place ? security, quality and proximity. 

 While Nicco Park is more accessible than any alternative amusement address, the authorities are making sure that the other two considerations match the best in business. 

 ?According to international stipulations, the entire volume of water should be filtered every two hours. That is exactly what we promise to do,? Sengupta explains.

 Experience is proving to be a bonus. ?Recently, we created the biggest amusement park in Bangladesh, about 30 km from Dhaka, called Nandan Park. It comprises both dry and water parks, like what Nicco Park has been envisaged as,? points out Abhijit Dutta, senior vice-president, operations and projects.

 A water park, Sengupta explains, makes sound business sense, too. ?The amusement park business is a seasonal one. The footfall dips in monsoon for a dry park. On the contrary, the peak seasons for a water park are summer and monsoon. So, with a complete package, we can hold the visitors through the year.?

 The water park will offer the pleasures of the beach in a city bereft of a seafront. 

 The look and feel will be tropical, with palm and coconut trees swaying in the breeze. Beach chairs will be laid out under thatched sheds on a sand-finished surface. 

 ?Our inspirations are the famous water parks in Thailand, Malaysia and Orlando in the US,? Sengupta says.

 According to senior manager, projects, Utpal Banerjee, the wave pool will be spread across 40,000 sq ft, including the beach area. 

 The setting will be laid out in rocks while a 40-ft waterfall will provide the backdrop. 

 There will be smaller mushroom falls in the pool itself, which will sink to 6 ft at the deep end. Computerised blowers will create a constant roll of three-four-ft-high waves. 

 From a tower, two body slides will come hurtling down from a height of 45 ft. One will be a four-lane wave runner slide that will take one up and down three-four waves in the 80 m journey downstream. The other will be a super spiral slide, that will end in a sofa landing. Another super spiral slide will start from a height of 35 ft on the tower. 

 A multiplay zone for the family, with a depth of 2 ft, will have slides for kids. 

 Nicco Park will have its own Niagara Falls, created at a side of the wave pool, splashing down on bathers below and drenching those going up close on the platform near it at 20 ft height. 

 Party animals can soak in the blasting music on the rain dance floor, equipped with strobe lights, mist machines and sprinklers. 

 The 42-acre park is known to add new excitements every season. But the water park, Sengupta confirms, will be ?one of our most ambitious projects to date?. 

 With the mercury reaching a new high every summer, this is one chill-out addition to the amusement map Calcutta can sure look forward to.

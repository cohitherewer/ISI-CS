 Tie em up with beads and baubles

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Tie them around your waist over your denims, wrap them around your neck over a tee, drape them across your wrist as a broad bracelet, and even fasten them around your hair as a funky accessory... Just keep innovating to play around with these strands of soft weaves.

 In a range of hues and bedecked with beads and sequins, these woven or knitted pieces are primarily sold as belts, but they lend themselves to stylisation galore.

 Mams Diva in Forum is home to an exclusive assortment of these multi-purpose belts. Thin, pretty black strands come adorned with mirror work.

 The crochet ones have big colourful sequins hanging in close succession to lend a gypsy feel. They come in shades of black and off-white, with colourful embellishments. Another variety offered at this store comes with large thread flowers knitted around small mirrors. You get them in three different combinations where blue is teamed with light yellow, pink and black.

 How much

 Shoppers rsquo; Stop: Rs 349, Mam rsquo;s Diva: Rs 250, Nik Nish: Rs 190 to Rs 250 

These are sourced from Thailand and Hong Kong and hence stand out because of their detailing and fine finish. You can wear them over kurtas, skirts or denims as an accessory, says Debashis Ganguly from Mams Diva. 

 At the Elgin Road outlet of Shoppers Stop, it is the sequinned variety that grabs your attention. Embellished with tiny sequins in splashes of chocolate brown and green all over, these belts are suitable pack-ins to add funk to your party garb.

 Nik Nish on Camac Street houses a pretty fluorescent orange set that is a fusion of strings of threads and beads. A spiral knot here and dangling orange balls there make up the complete effect. Another eye-catcher here is a beaded green variety that comes attached with stones.

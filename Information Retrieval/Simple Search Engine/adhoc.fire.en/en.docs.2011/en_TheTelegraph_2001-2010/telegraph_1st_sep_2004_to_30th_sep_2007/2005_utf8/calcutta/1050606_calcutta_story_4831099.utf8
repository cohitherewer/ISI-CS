 Buddha beckons CNG

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is trying to persuade the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to bring compressed natural gas (CNG) to Calcutta. 

 ?Preliminary talks with GAIL have been positive. They were unsure about finding franchises here. I have asked them to float tenders,? the chief minister said on Sunday, at the West Bengal Pollution Control Board office on World Environment Day.

 City transporters have been reluctant to change over to LPG since vehicles running on diesel cannot be turned to LPG mode. CNG, most feel, holds the key to clean air. 

 Asserting his government?s resolve to phase out pre-1990 commercial vehicles in Calcutta, Bhattacharjee said: ?Come what may, commercial operators will have to go by the age limit we have prescribed.? 

 He admitted that none of the transporters was willing to part with their old vehicles. ?We shouldn?t blame only private operators. Look at the kind of smoke our own buses emit,? he said.

 According to environment minister Manabendra Mukherjee: ?In 1997, around 50 per cent of Calcutta?s air pollution was caused by automobile emission, while industry accounted for 48 per cent. In 2005, automobile emission accounts for 55 per cent of pollution and industry for only seven per cent. Construction work accounts for 30 per cent.?

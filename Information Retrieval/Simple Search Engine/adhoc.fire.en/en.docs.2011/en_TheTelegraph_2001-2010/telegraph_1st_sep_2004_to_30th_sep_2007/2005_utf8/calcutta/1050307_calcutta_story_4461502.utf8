 Dog-maul employer gets bail, maid shots

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Swapna Chanda, who had locked her eight-year-old help Gudia, along with two pet Alsatians, at her Agarpara house on Friday evening, was arrested on Saturday night, only to be released on bail.

 One of the dogs, which was not tethered, had mauled Gudia for nearly two hours. The girl was admitted to AMRI Hospitals in a serious condition. 

 ?We have arrested Swapna Chanda because she could not produce the written consent of the forest department, needed for keeping such pets,? said Manoj Verma, additional superintendent of police.

 ?We are looking for her son Sudip and husband Parthasarathi, an excise officer posted in Kharagpur,? an officer said.

 Doctors at AMRI Hospitals said Gudia would be kept under observation for the next two days. ?She has been vaccinated for rabies and we are examining whether the neurological problems she had developed, because of the shock or the poison, are persisting,? said a doctor on Sunday.

 Swapna, a music teacher, had left for classes, leaving her mother and Gudia along with the pets. The lights were switched off to save electricity.

 For two hours, Gudia screamed while the dog, Jack, was mauling her. Neighbours gathered around the house but could not do anything, as the house was locked from outside. 

 Police on Sunday morning informed Gudia?s mother Shanta Jacob, who lives in Sankrail, about the incident. The woman has five daughters.

 Shanta later visited the Chandas? residence but refused to speak against the family. 

 She even hinted that she would settle the matter with them. Police said the Chandas had not informed the local thana that they had hired a help from Sankrail. 

 Neighbours have urged the police to send Gudia either to her mother or a state-run home, if her mother refuses to take her back.

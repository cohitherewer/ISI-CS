The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hollywood denied

 - Studios neglect poor-returns Calcutta when sending out prints to India

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Wonder why you never get to see the Vanity Fairs and the Finding Neverlands while friends and family in Delhi and Mumbai happily catch them in the theatres? Wonder why you turn to Page 3 when you go to New Empire or are greeted by B-grade Tezaab at Globe this week?

 Well, here?s the bitter big-screen truth: Calcutta, with 12 multiplex screens and fast-fading standalone English film theatres, just doesn?t figure in the priority zone for big Hollywood studios when they send their prints to India.

 The figure: Calcutta contributes ?less than two per cent of annual revenue for English films in the country?. The fact: the multiplex boom in town has failed to grow the number of Holly hunters. The future: Calcutta remains resigned to missing out on big Hollywood blockbusters or, at best, catching them weeks after other metros.

 ?In this age, where so much is spent on marketing, we do not look at Calcutta as one of the main markets,? says Vikramjit Roy, head, publicity and acquisitions, Sony Pictures Releasing of India Limited (formerly Columbia Tristar). ?Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore are the main cities when it comes to a romantic comedy and when it?s an action-adventure, we also look at Pune and Chennai as our main markets. Calcutta only comes after all of them in the priority list.?

 Calcutta?s growing gap with Hollywood also has to do with the Bollywood boom. ?At the moment, Calcutta is concentrating more on Hindi films,? says Arijit Dutta, ex-president of EIMPA.

 Dry-up in English releases

 ?Of late, English films have had a very rough ride. So, the releases have also dried up. Just box-office friendly Hollywood films like Spider-Man and Shrek have released in a big way,? adds Dutta.

 The present problems are rooted firmly in the past. ?Before the multiplexes, Bengal was a single-print territory for English films, at New Empire,? says Sumanta Ray, regional marketing manager of INOX. ?Obviously, it never gave returns and hence, our city just disappeared from the Mumbai radar.?

 The emergence of three cineplexes in the recent past has also failed to expand the English film-viewing market in the city.

 ?While in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, the multiplex mania has led to expansion of this market,? says Roy of Sony Pictures, ?the impact in Calcutta has been very little. The Nicolas Cage-starrer National Treasure will come to Calcutta on February 11, well after the Mumbai release. We call this a platform release, where we make most of the Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore markets in Wave I and then try our luck in Chennai, Pune and Calcutta in Wave II.?

 The bottomline, of course, is feasibility. As Ray of INOX says: ?It takes more than one lakh to make a print and then add the cost of shipping and promotion. The returns have to justify this cost. Earlier, it was a three-month lag between Mumbai and Calcutta releases. Now, it?s coming down due to the multiplexes.?

 There is hope, yet. Says Jacinto Fernandes, marketing manager of Paramount Films of India, which distributes Paramount, Universal and Dreamworks films in India: ?Only when it is a big film like Terminal or Collateral, we open big in all the metros, including Calcutta? With more multiplexes slated to come up, we expect Calcutta to become a bigger market.?

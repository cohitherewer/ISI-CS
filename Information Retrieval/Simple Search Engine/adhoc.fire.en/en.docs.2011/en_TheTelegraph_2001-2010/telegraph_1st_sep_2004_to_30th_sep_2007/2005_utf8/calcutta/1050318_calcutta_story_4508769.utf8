 Tagore?s timeless wit

 Tagore?s trailblazing plays, comparatively neglected by Bengali theatre, are enjoying a fresh lease of life. While Kuhak has revived the anti-orthodox Achalayatan, Anya Theatre and Rang Roop have gone for two nearly forgotten works deserving resurrection, Sodhbodh and Sesh Raksha.

 I consider Sesh Raksha one of Tagore?s two finest comedies. He wrote the original, Goray Galad, in 1892, but revised it at the request of the eminent director Sisir Bhaduri for the commercial stage in 1927. It proved one of Bhaduri?s hugest hits that year, transformed by his encouragement of audience participation, probably for the first time in Calcutta.

 Breaking the proscenium barrier, the dramatis personae invited spectators to join in the merrymaking at the end, to celebrate the two marital reconciliations and one wedding. Of course, Tagore had not intended it as just entertainment.

 Beneath the conventional romantic plot, he consistently chipped away at social rigidities. At a time when matchmaking was the norm, he farcically exposed its pitfalls and pleaded the case for love, instead.

 He presented two literate young women choosing their partners, at a time when most urban wives were uneducated. He even showed two of the marriages (one arranged and established, the other impulsive and impractical) breaking up due to different realistic pressures, and eventually reuniting, the spouses more mature. And he parodied the affectations of upper-class Bengalis for good measure.

 In the 21st century, most of these conditions have changed for the better. Nor has the director, Sima Mukherjee, unveiled any spectacular sleight of hand to match Bhaduri?s. 

 Yet, Rang Roop?s production is immensely enjoyable, both for Tagore?s timeless wit as well as for its good performances. Perhaps it remains relevant, too, since neither conjugal problems nor adoption of Western mores have disappeared.

 The whole cast acts well. Particularly noteworthy is debutante Miska Halim. Hers is an intelligent Indumati. As a perfect foil, Sima Mukherjee deliberately portrays a plain, older, unappreciated housewife with an unmusical voice, convinced that she does not appeal to her husband (himself quite the suave babu, played by Debasish Roychowdhury). Jayanta Mitra and Apurba Saha make appropriately moonstruck lovers as the poet and trainee doctor. 

 The two fathers, the strict Sibcharan and indulgent Nibaran, receive aptly contrasting treatment from Kalipada Ghosh and Asim Bhattacharya. 

 Those who think Tagore had no funny bone should see the scene where Sibcharan explodes when his son, who first rejected his choice, then requested him to arrange a match with another girl, reverses his decision and asks for the original choice.

 Edited ably by senior dramatist Mohit Chattopadhyaya to suit today?s lengths, Sesh Raksha does not drag. My only criticism has to do with the music: we would much rather hear the actors themselves sing (Gopa Nandi, for one, as Kamalmukhi, has a fine tenor) than a pro like Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta on the taped soundtrack, because live songs make a distinct difference.

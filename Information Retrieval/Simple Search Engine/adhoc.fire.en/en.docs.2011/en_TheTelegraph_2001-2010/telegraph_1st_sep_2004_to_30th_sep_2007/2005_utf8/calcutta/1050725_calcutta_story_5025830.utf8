 Ultra-cool code 

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Amitabh Bachchan for KBC2

 Electric colours. Sensuous fabrics. Easy-fitting silhouettes. Those will be the keywords as Amitabh Bachchan dons a brand new wardrobe specially created for the last leg of Kaun Banega Crorepati. The second innings of the biggest game show on Indian television is targeted more towards the masses and reaching out to the maximum number of viewers is the mantra for the host channel, STAR.

 The dress code for Bachchan, the quizmaster, has been an extension of this idea. And the men given the arduous task of making the man look ultra-cool are designer brothers Shantanu and Nikhil Mehra, known to balance the delicate and the rich, chiffon silks with leather, silk crepes with wool, Indian hand-woven jacquards with suede.

 Says Nikhil: During its first outing, KBC was a quiz show for intellectuals? very straight-up. The overall look was very classy and all Mr Bachchan was allowed to wear were bandhgalas, jackets and ties. As far as colour goes, there were lots of navy blues, blacks, bieges ? mostly very classic stuff. It was the changing colours of the tie that was the only respite from that mature look. But the brief given to us for KBC2 was to make him look like a rockstar. That was something which worked brilliantly since thats what we love doing.

 So the designer siblings Nikhil and Shantanu got cracking and got hold of some classic Bachchan movies of the 1970s. We watched films like Pukar, Silsila and Mr Natawarlal very closely before sitting at the drawing board, reveals Nikhil. 

 We cut out the ties completely and introduced high collars, patch pockets, zipper details. We have given Mr Bachchan a lot of co-ordinates. The leather jackets, too, are a big thing in the collection. For the printed silk shirts, we took inspiration from Bombay To Goa.

 Knowing the most minute details of the show was a must for the designers who had first found the spotlight after making Team India cricketers Zaheer Khan, Mohammed Kaif, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan walk the ramp in their outfits. 

 We couldnt have left anything to the imagination. We had to know the question tree, the script, the dialogues... This was very helpful when we came up with special buttonholes, keeping in mind the camera would go to complete close-up when Mr Bachchan signed and gave out the cheques.

 The young designers, whose fashion fundas are all about relaxed sophistication and subdued elegance with grandiose sexiness and decadent East-meets-West style, are looking at KBC2 as a platform to propel them to the top of the style heap. 

 We have been so consumed by KBC2 that we havent been taking our regular offers and have cut down on other work drastically, admits Nikhil. Recently, we did give Manoj Bajpai a different look in Fareb and have taken up the task of making Isha Sarvani look different in an untitled Ram Gopal Varma production.

 For the Mehra brothers to take up an assignment, the project has to strike a personal chord, offering a complete makeover challenge. And after KBC2 goes on air from August 5, they should have a lot more options to choose from. 

 As they admit: It doesnt get bigger than this ? we are dressing up the God of Indian cinema.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A rude awakening

 Exploring the dialectics of a reality in which there is no place for ideals, morals or principles, Sansritis production, Winkle Twinkle, highlights the contradictions and clash of beliefs we live with every day in trying to accommodate our past with our present. Like the storybook character Rip Van Winkle who woke up after sleeping for 20 years, Sabyasachi Sen also feels out of place when he suddenly reappears after mysteriously disappearing 26 years ago. Not only in the political environment, even among his family members he feels himself a misfit, trying in vain to understand the utter transformation of society. He finds his son treading a path that is in total contrast to his own ideals, his daughter irresponsible and apathetic to her social surroundings and his wife pathetically languishing in a web of faded memories. Most surprising of all, his homecoming, instead of bringing joy to his family, shocks them, disturbing, as it were, the fragile equilibrium of their daily existence. Written by Bratya Basu. Directed by Debesh Chattopadhyay.

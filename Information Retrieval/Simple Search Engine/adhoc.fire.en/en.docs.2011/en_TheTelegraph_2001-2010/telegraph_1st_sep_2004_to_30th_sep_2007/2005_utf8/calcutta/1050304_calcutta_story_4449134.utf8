The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk 

Spring is in your pocket, on the tennis court and 

on your telly. As you set about to celebrate a friendly budget and raise a toast 

to the teen tennis queen of the country, better know your basics before you babble. 

Gorge on the spring-summer guide that follows and enjoy it while it lasts!

Colour blind

A couple of years ago it was Denzel Washington and 

Halle Berry. This year it has been Jamie Foxx and Morgan Freeman. Are the Blacks 

finally emerging from the shadows of power play and prejudice?

While Ray and Million Dollar Baby may 

take some time to hit the Calcutta theatres (if they do at all), you can, for 

the moment, bask in Black glory ? and yes, with or without Amitabh Bachchan!

Tennis trump

Cricket is out, tennis is in. So is swooning over 

?cute? Sania, irrespective of your allegiances. Her sweet, down-to-earth persona 

coupled with her nerdy looks should be endearing even if you?ve not really caught 

her in action as yet. But Serena Williams has acknowledged her potential as have 

half-a-dozen other tennis titans and you can?t help but rave about how she?s on 

a roll, from Hyderabad to Dubai, despite carrying an ankle injury. Power be with 

Sania, with or without the Preity Zinta glasses.

Just landed

They didn?t strike gold at Kodak Theatre but they 

did hit our sympathy chords. And with The Aviator finally releasing today, 

Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese are the men of the moment. Catch the film 

if you can and watch billionaire Howard Hughes get the most grand celluloid tribute 

possible.

Budget baatein

PC?s budget proposals will rule the talk-shop this 

week. One can?t stop praising the reformer finance minister ? even the Left parties 

are going ga-ga ? for proposing an easier income-tax regime and releasing funds 

for social development. But no harm in questioning the rationale behind fringe-benefit 

tax and tax on withdrawal of over Rs 10,000 from banks. Thumbs up to PC for triggering 

a downward trend in the cost of goodlife ? airconditioners, two-wheelers, cars 

and even car batteries.

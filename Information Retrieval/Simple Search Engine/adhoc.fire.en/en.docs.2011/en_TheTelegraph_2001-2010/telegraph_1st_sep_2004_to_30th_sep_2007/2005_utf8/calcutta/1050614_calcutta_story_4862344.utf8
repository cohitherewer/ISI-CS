 Another land lease fraud in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A week into the lease-transfer of land in Salt Lake?s Sector V, the department of urban development has a word of caution for prospective landholders ? check your papers.

 The warning comes close on the heels of a detective department probe into a land-transfer racket. Gautam Mukherjee, an executive with an acoustics company in New Alipore, and his associates have been accused of promising people plots in Salt Lake Sector V and Rajarhat.

 Mukherjee was arrested in Cossipore on June 8 for duping a firm by showing its officials a letter that directed the state urban development department to offer a plot of land to it. For this, Mukherjee had taken Rs 70,000 as advance from the company, the probe revealed.

 Besides the signature of a senior officer from the chief minister?s secretariat, the executive and his four associates had allegedly forged the signatures of senior officers from various departments, including the urban development department. The investigators had found that the team used fake stamps and letterheads to win over customers.

 One of the the victims, Kashyap Roy from Madan Street, was initially promised land in Sector I, and then in Sector V. ?Mukherjee and his associates charged Rs 1.5 lakh for the deal, which made Roy suspicious, so he informed the police. There are other victims we are not aware of,? said a sleuth of the detective department.

 This is the second time in seven months that a fraudulent land racket has been unearthed in Salt Lake. The CID has been probing a similar racket since December.

 The kingpin was Samir Dey, a resident of BJ block. He had duped a dozen professionals by promising them land in Salt Lake. The CID is still on the hunt for Dey. 

 ?In case of doubt, buyers should contact the department and get their papers checked. As for as land transfers in Salt Lake are concerned, one should know that such transfers cannot take place,? warned K.S. Rajendra Kumar, principal secretary of the urban development department.

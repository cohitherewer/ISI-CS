 Why be a bartender if you cant be like Brian Flanagan (Tom Cruise) in Cocktail? If thats your line of thought, you should have been at a two-day crash course in town.

 The Smirnoff Bartender Training Workshop on September 23 and 24 saw bartending gurus Marco and Stewart mixing and stirring their expertise to really serve it up at the table.

 Held at the Grain of Salt banquet hall, 35 bartenders across the city learnt the nuances of shakin it up.

 Bartending today is no longer restricted to standing behind the bar and serving drinks. The idea of customer service is interaction and doing your job in style. It is a profession and an art that involves a lot of creativity, smiled Stewart.

 In workshops like these, bartenders learn to perfect their skills that put them on a par with global trends. These guys are really good and learning fast, added Marco.

 The participants lapped up interesting bartending practices that are now an international rage. 

 From juggling to freestyle, the session included interesting and innovative styles.

 so on the agenda were tips on using shakers, bottle handling, flips and action-packed bar tricks.

 Their first workshop was in Delhi. After the Calcutta session, the duo from Australia heads off to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Mumbai.

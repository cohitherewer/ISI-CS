 Other titles that stand out include Ram Gopal Varma?s Company, Raj Kumar Santoshi?s Pukar and Shekhar Kapur?s Mr India. 

 Shakira: Whenever, wherever

 Already in 12 million homes, VH1 India is now offering an all-expense paid 

 trip to some major international concerts through its Ticket to Ride contest. To take part, viewers need to tune in between 9 and 11 pm before August 22.

 Highlights include the Anger Management concert in Amsterdam on September 6, featuring artistes who have anger-control issues like 50 Cent and Flipsyde. There?s also a Bon Jovi Europe concert and the Hip Hop Honours awards in the US, and the grand finale ? the Shakira Europe concert in October. The winner gets to meet and spend time with Shakira.

 ?Our music mix ? 70 per cent contemporary and 30 per cent classic ? is working very well,? says Keerthan Adyantha, the new general manager of VH1 India. The response from the east is great, too, with ?the global telecast of Live 8 getting 0.8 ratings in Calcutta?.

 Recently emerging as the top Hindi news channel, STAR News has now launched Khabar Filmi Hai, a daily show on the latest in the film world. The show, started on August 16, will beam Monday to Friday, 8.30 pm.

 The half-hour Bollywood show will include the latest on inside gossip, premiers, parties and on-location interviews. A nostalgia segment is also being planned.

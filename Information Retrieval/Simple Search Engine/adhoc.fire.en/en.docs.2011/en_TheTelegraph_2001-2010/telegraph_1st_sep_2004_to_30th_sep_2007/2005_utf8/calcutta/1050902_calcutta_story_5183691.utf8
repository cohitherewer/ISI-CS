 Apply for passport via speed post

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come October, you need not travel all the way to the office off BBD Bag during rush hour and stand in long queues for filing in an application for a passport. You can do so through speed post.

 The external affairs ministry has tied up with the postal department to facilitate submission of application forms without coming to the passport office. 

 ?The application should be submitted to the speed post officer and it will be sent to the regional passport office,? said minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed, who was in the city on Thursday to inaugurate the All-India Passport Officers? Conference.

 Initially, 215 speed post offices will have the facility. The number will be 500 within a year, Ahmed said. In 2002, the ministry had opened a number of district passport centres to decentralise the process of issuing passports.

 The ministry is also coming up with a new-look passport. ?The new document will be sleek, with a fewer number of pages,? said chief passport officer R.R. Dash. ?It will be more user-friendly, and will have better security features to match international standards,? Dash elaborated.

 The details are being worked out and officials expect to complete the process in a few months.

 The minister expressed concern over the large number of pending passport applications, though the backlog has been brought down from two lakh last year to a lakh this year. ?We will undertake a drive at all regional passport offices from September 15 to 30 to clear the pending applications,? Ahmed said.

 Admitting that there were a large number of complaints of corruption against some passport officials, Ahmed said the internal agencies of the ministry were being strengthened to keep a vigil on them. ?These agencies will look into complaints of corruption and act against touts and middlemen,? the minister asserted.

 To deal with the fake passport problem, the minister said ?laminated passports and other devices are being introduced? to ensure that forged papers were identified easily. 

 Chief passport officer Dash highlighted several issues affecting speedy delivery of passports. ?In past few years, thanks to the boom in information technology and other sectors, there has been a spurt in the number of passport applications across the country. But the staff strength at our offices has remained almost the same,? he pointed out.

 ?Inadequate staff strength, shortage of space and other issues were standing in the way of speedy delivery of passports, forcing applicants to visit our offices several times. We are seeking feedback from officers on how to solve the problems,? Dash added.

 Another reason for the delay in delivery, officials claimed, was the time taken by the police to file their reports on applicants.

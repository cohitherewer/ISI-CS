The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stamp duty protest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The developers? fraternity in Calcutta has expressed disappointment at the Left Front government?s failure to announce a reduction in stamp duty for transfer of property in the state budget 2005-06.

 ?I?m surprised the finance minister didn?t mention a cut in stamp duty despite the Centre?s assurance that it would compensate the state for any revenue loss resulting from it,? Pradip Chopra, honorary secretary, Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Associations of India Bengal chapter, said on Monday.

 He expressed concern that Calcutta ?won?t be able to access the Rs 5,500-crore urban development fund? under the National Urban Renewal Mission without bringing the duty to five per cent, as recommended by the National Housing amp; Habitat Policy. It now stands at 11.5 per cent in the Calcutta metropolitan area.

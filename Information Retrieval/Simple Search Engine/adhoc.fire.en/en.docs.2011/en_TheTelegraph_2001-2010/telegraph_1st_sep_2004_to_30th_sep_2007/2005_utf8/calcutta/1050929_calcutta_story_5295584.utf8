 Annually, it provides Bengalis in North America the opportunity to have a feel of the music, art and literature back home. 

 But at next year?s North American Bengali Conference (NABC), the spotlight will also be on doing business in Bengal.

 ?We intend to promote the commercial rejuvenation of Bengal,? said Sanku Bose, general secretary of North American Bengali Conference 2006, to be held between June 30 and July 2, in Houston, Texas.

 Highlights of the event include a multi-tracked business conference covering energy, health, education and information and technology. 

 There would also be a round-table discussion on enterprise and leadership, and workshops on these topics. 

 The conference is partnering with the Houston Chamber of Commerce, non-profit organisations and government representatives to include corporate and government participation.

 ?We are planning to develop entrepreneurship courses that can be taught in institutions in Bengal. I saw at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence this morning the case of Ismail Mondol, a brilliant student whose father had to sell his land to educate him. We want to reach out to people like Ismail,? said Asoke Deysarkar, member of the business forum of NABC 2006.

 ?Houston has a thriving Bengali community since the 1970s and with the 26th NABC, we would be laying the foundation as well as charting out the roadmap for the next 25 years of the conference,? Bose added.

 A flock of musicians, authors, poets and stars of the small and big screens are scheduled to attend the programme. 

 Usha Uthup, Indranil Sen, Abhijit and Bengali band Bhoomi, among others, form the musical attractions. 

 The classical music artiste line-up includes Hariprasad Chaurasia, Koushiki Chakraborty Desikan and Kumar Bose. 

 Actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty is scheduled to direct the play Parabash, featuring Subhendu Chatterjee, Indrani Haldar and Rupa Ganguly.

 The film festival is likely to see attendance from directors Mrinal Sen, Sandip Ray and Gautam Ghose.

 ?The Bengali conference was started in 1981 from a small school in New York. Adda and khichuri were the prime attractions then. We have come a long way from that and plan to make a strong impression this time,? Bose said.

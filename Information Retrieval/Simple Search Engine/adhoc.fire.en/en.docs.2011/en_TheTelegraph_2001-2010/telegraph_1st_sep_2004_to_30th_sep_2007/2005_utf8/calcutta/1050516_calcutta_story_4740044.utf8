The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For Calcutta eyes early, the Jedi saga

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 The craze to catch the last episode of George Lucas?s 34-year-old movie franchise, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, is taking on epic proportions the world over, but it is 589 lucky Calcuttans who will get to watch it before most others. Thanks, of course, to longitudinal time difference.

 INOX (City Centre) will host a two-screen premiere on Thursday of the final Jedi saga on May 19 at 7.40 pm, which will make it one of the first theatres anywhere to screen Revenge of the Sith. 

 ?The time difference between India and the west will certainly make the Calcutta premiere one of the first screenings around the world,? confirmed the national distributors of 20th Century Fox?s biggest release in 2005.

 As always, Calcutta was almost overlooked when the premiere of the special effects-laden sci-fi film was being planned in India. ?We bounced the idea off the distribution company and after some deliberation, we got the nod,? reveals Subhasis Ganguly, general manager, INOX (City Centre). ?The premiere was only finalised on Saturday.?

 Revenge of the Sith, billed as the most emotional of the Star Wars films and labelled by Lucas as ?the Titanic of space?, will complete the series which includes two sequels and three prequels. 

 In an interview to Metro a few months ago, Kevin Burns, the director of Star Wars: Empire of Dreams, the documentary on the making of the six films, had said: ?When the third episode of the new trilogy (the prequels) comes out, the two families will be complete and the debate on which trilogy is better will be more justified.?

 With entry to the premiere being strictly by invitation, the scramble for passes is getting hotter by the hour. ?I have been waiting to see the film from the time my son and I downloaded the screenplay on the Net,? says actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty, a self-confessed Star Wars freak. ?To me, the film, including the characters, is a modern version of Dakshinaranjan Majumdar?s Thakumar Jhuli. Lucas is a master of story-building and none of the five films so far have let me down.?

 For those not making it to the premiere, Revenge of the Sith releases at INOX (Forum and City Centre), 89 Cinemas and New Empire on Friday. 

 And while the queue outside Grauman?s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood has been forming since April 2, you may not have to line up that long to book your seat, once the advance counters open on Wednesday.

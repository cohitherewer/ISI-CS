Life

 My space

 House Proud

 It rsquo;s your very own space where you can just be what you want to be and do what you want to do. A den can be all this and more, writes Riddhima Seal

 A place where you can cultivate the weirdest of hobbies, a place where you can hang out with friends and, above all, a place where you can be yourself and have just your kind of fun. This is what dens are for and including one such room in your house could indeed be a great way of adding that extra zing to your life.

 Size

 The size of a den, according to interior designers, should ideally be at least 12 feet by 12 feet. But then, it can vary depending on the size of your house and the purpose you will use it for.

 While determining the size of a den, you should keep in mind the kind of activities you want to pursue there. Very often, we have clients who want their balconies converted into their personal space, says interior designer Manjari Sahay.

 Flooring

 Doing up the floors of the den in an innovative yet informal manner is of extreme importance. The cheapest and best way to do up the floor is to put down grassmats all over and then throw in a lot of brightly coloured cushions on it to set the perfect mood for an adda session. However, dens are a very personal thing and what you want to do in there would depend a lot on the kind of person you are, says interior designer Ajay Issar. 

 Wooden flooring, though expensive, is also a very good idea. Whatever the flooring, one should always throw in durries, carpets and lots of cushions. 

 Walls

 Vibrancy is the name of the game when it comes to painting the walls. Bright shades like red, violet, Prussian blue and fluorescent green absolutely rock.

 Another unique colour scheme, feels Issar, is painting the floor, ceiling and the walls with the same bright colour. This would render a trance effect with nothing between you and the space, he explains. 

 A lot of people also prefer wooden panelling on the walls, but this goes best against a background of lighter hues, feels Sahay. Soft boards with a collage of pictures could jazz up the decor. 

 The curtains should be in sync with the walls.

 Lighting

 Mood lighting should be the thing for your den as it would give it the private space effect. Bright lights are a strict no-no.

 Neon bulbs for panel lighting are also very popular. Another innovative way is to do up the entire ceiling with tiny blue bulbs that would give the feel of being under an open night sky, with all other lights switched off. 

 Lampshades in bright hues of red, green, blue or orange are musts. 

 Furniture

 What you would like to keep in your den would depend largely on why its there in the first place.

 For instance, a person fond of reading would store a lot of books here and so a matte-finish wooden cabinet fitted to the walls would be just right. On the other hand, those who would prefer to just relax here can have recliners with a music system and even a television. 

 If you are lucky enough to have a small balcony as part of your den, then you could hang a rope jhula and place a small rocking chair there. Those who plan to have frequent bashes with friends should include a bar counter. 

 Seating arrangements, if at all in the form of chairs and sofas, should be low, as this helps add to the informal flavour of the room, insist both Sahay and Issar.

 Besides all this, there could be a thousand other ways in which you can do up your private little place. At the end of a tiring day, the essential mantra is to leave your personal mark somewhere in the decor ? something you most like coming home to.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Junk funk for your feet

From slim silver chains to chunky strings 

of stones and beads Himika Chaudhuri lists the options available 

in anklets

 The metrosexual man knows only too well how to give his counterpart a complex ? especially when it comes to adorning himself with pieces of fashion jewellery. While everything from diamond studs to neckpieces and even bangles have long been taken into the metrosexual male?s casket, the anklet is one of the few fineries that still remain in the ?only woman?s? category ? at least in the present. 

 From the traditional payel in silver, that was once a must for most married women in the country, the options have now widened with everything from beads, coloured stones and even glass making their way to jazz up these once subtle and jingling ornaments.

 With innovations in the look of the pieces, the wearer?s profile has undergone a change too. Now it?s more the teenybopper who hops into the silver jewellery store to pick up a singlet to flaunt with a mini skirt. 

 ?The highest-selling style in anklets is a thin chain of silver with a tiny dangler. Most of the college-going crowd picks it up,? says Norkila of Chamba Lama in New Market, one of the oldest silver jewellery stores in the city.

 For most fancy silver jewellery shoppers Chamba Lama remains the destination of choice, but another place to stop at for a pair of pure sterling (92.5 per cent) silver anklet is Heritage (Shop 65, New Market). This store also deals in some elaborately-crafted anklets in silver with semi-precious stones. The Cottage Industry outlet at Esplanade also houses a host of styles in traditional-looking silver anklets. 

 For the funkier versions with wooden and glass beads created according to your tastes, turn to the humble jewellers in the bylanes of New Market who can offer a string of colourful beads to act as an anklet for as little as Rs 20.

 The various options ranging from ethnic elegance to fashion funk are as follows:

Ethnic appeal

 These are as unimaginative in the design department as you can imagine. You wouldn?t want to wear them beyond the second day of your marriage ritual, and would definitely take it off before boarding the flight for the honeymoon. The thin ring of silver is usually decorated with little dots beaten into the metal with tiny danglers. Some have meenakari work on them. These are priced at Rs 100 onwards, depending on the width of the base chain. 

 so from the traditionalist school are the kundan anklets that are elaborately worked on and often plated with gold. ?These go best with bridal attires and the stones used are in bright colours to blend with the mood of a marriage,? says Mahesh Punjabi of Heritage. These look quite heavy and elaborate and are best avoided with western outfits. 

Oxidised oomph

 The rage for the black metal look has not worn off since it made its debut in Calcutta in the early 90s. The oxidised look still does well and the metal is now accessorised with beads and pieces of glass to add a dash of colour. A strip of oxidised metal beaten to form intricate designs gives the elaborate and dressy yet smart look. 

 With prices ranging between Rs 100 for a pair and Rs 100 for a single piece, it?s the handwork and the width of the ornament that decide how much you have to shell out.

Sleek sizzlers

 The biggest draw, according to all sellers, is the thin silver chain that most subtle dressers opt for. A snake anklet (a wide self-designed silver chain that gives the look of meandering water) is also a big hit.

 ?Since the style is to just wear a single piece, we don?t mind selling one piece from a pair,? says Mahesh. This policy holds true for all varieties, from the stark to the elaborate. Prices here range between Rs 150 and Rs 250. 

White magic

 The white metal pieces available mostly in chunky designs go well with the fusion look. Adorned with ghungroos (bells) and danglers, these are for the loud dresser. Pick these up for anything between Rs 40 and a few hundred per piece. 

Bead beauty

 Adding some colour to your feet was never easier. You can get a jeweller sitting in the bylanes of New Market to string a few beads together, according to your choice. From vibrant reds and oranges to demure black, the choices are many. Given that you can get one anklet for as little as Rs 20, it?s a good idea to keep a few combinations ready and match the shades to your wardrobe.

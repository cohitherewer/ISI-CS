The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Security boost at stations

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The district administration has drawn up plans to curb criminal activities at Howrah station and its adjoining areas.

 ?The problem cannot be solved overnight, but an effort has to be made, as the situation is very serious,? said police superintendent M.K. Bhattacharya. 

 ?Every month, we register more than a 100 cases related to pickpocketing, assault, rape, flesh trade and sale of illicit liquor at the station and its adjoining areas, including the stand for Calcutta-bound buses,? said a senior officer.

 Of the cases registered, more than 60 per cent are withdrawn following pressure on the complainants by political parties and the accused.

 Ramdas Yadav, who runs a shop at the bus stand, said the premises were overrun by criminals throughout the day. And their activities escalate at night. The situation has been so for several years and despite repeated complaints, police have not launched any drive, he alleged.

 Some shop-owners even complained that officers of Golabari police station, who often visit the place, demand ?cut-money? from the criminals as well as those running stalls near the station. 

 And not just at Howrah. The other terminal station, too, is plagued with such vice. 

 The station authorities are considering measures for Sealdah, too, similar to what has been planned for Howrah.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crew guilty, not waters

 A STAFF REPORTER

 High tide or human error? What could have caused MV Moni, the barge heading upstream, to get stuck under Howrah bridge?

 According to the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which maintains the bridge, the mishap could have been averted had the master of the ship sailed his barge by the navigation book and been more cautious.

 The port circulates charts predicting the schedule of high and low tides for the benefit of the shipping community. The chart is prepared by the Survey of India and the CPT distributes it well ahead of schedule.

 All ships as well as barges are supposed to follow the chart and draw up the voyage plan accordingly. The chart assumes even more importance here, since the Hooghly has treacherous channels.

 CPT chairman Anup K. Chanda said MV Moni should never have undertaken the voyage under the bridge at that time of the day. ?There was no error in the prediction of tide. The water was rising, but only as predicted. They should have been far more cautious,? Chanda told Metro.

 And even if it was planning to sail along the route, the barge should have stuck to the shipping channel and passed right below the centre of the bridge. Howrah bridge slants towards either bank. The barge was too close to the Howrah side while passing under the bridge, and hit it.

 As the 600-tonne barge deployed for inland water cargo movement was empty, most of the structure was above water, causing the mast to get stuck in the girder supporting the bridge.

 In panic, the crew made the next mistake ? trying to get another vessel to tug it out of trouble. As a consequence, further damage was inflicted on the bridge.

 ?It was clearly the fault of the crew and the master, who could not assess the situation,? said M.K. Saha, director (east), of Inland Water Authority of India (IWAI), the central government body for promotion of inland water traffic.

 ?They should have pumped water into the barge to make it heavy. That would have helped it dip further into the river and clear the bridge,? Saha added.

 Finally, there was no way out of the choppy waters but to chop the barge down to size. 

 ?The mast, as well as the master?s cabin, was sawn off to save the bridge,? said M.A. Bhaskarachar, CPT deputy chairman. So, after three-and-a-half hours of high drama on the Hooghly, the barge was extricated and Howrah bridge reopened for traffic.

 Priyanka Chopra: Colourful

 With off-screen Holi just days away, the on-screen festival of colours is right ?on time? with the teasers of Vipul Shah?s Waqt ? A Race Against Time all over the telly. The Anu Malik song Let?s play Holi, featuring lead stars Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra, is already a big rage on the airwaves. But all was not well on the sets during the shooting of the song with wet wet wet Priyanka in for a shock when she stepped on to a loose wire in her make-up van.

 The Aitraaz lady collapsed and fainted inside the van leaving the entire unit in a state of shock. With all efforts to revive her failing, she was rushed to hospital and the shoot was cancelled for the day. By next morning Priyanka was hale and hearty and shooting could be resumed straightaway.

 With the film from the maker of Aankhen set to release in end-April, Waqt?s Mumbai distribution has been taken over by Akshay himself. ?Waqt is very close to my heart. It?s more than just a business decision ? rather an emotional one,? says Bollywood?s khiladi star.

Ajay Devgan in Kaal: Deadly

 Karan Johar meets Ram Gopal Varma in Soham Shah?s directorial debut Kaal, starring Ajay Devgan, John Abraham, Vivek Oberoi, Lara Dutta and Esha Deol. With the promos of the forest thriller already on air, the buzz around the songless Johar-Shah Rukh Khan production is getting hotter by the day.

 Without a song Kaal may be, but the music inspired by the film is ready to rock town. Composed by the talented techie duo of Salim and Sulaiman, Kaal?s music is more of the bhangra hip-hip stuff we hear in lounges and discos.

 One of the highlights of the film is the item number performed by Shah Rukh and Malaika Arora Khan which comes with the opening credits. This Sunday, at 4 pm, STAR Gold presents a half-hour special show on Kaal?s music, punctuated with exclusive behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with some of the crew and cast members.

 It?s double dhamaka for English film buffs as STAR Movies brings you a weekend full of exciting entertainment with the premiere of two Hollywood blockbusters.

 First up on Saturday at 9 pm is The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen starring Sean Connery and our very own Naseeruddin Shah. About extraordinary figures having legendary powers to battle technological terror, The League... is set in 1899 and based on the best-selling and acclaimed comic book series by Alan Morre and Kevin O?Neill.

 Shah plays the legendary Captain Nemo from Jules Verne?s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. For his first major Hollywood movie, he trained with a karate master to do much of his own fighting stunt work as Nemo.

 On Sunday, at 9 pm, it is time for another sizzling action thriller, Silver Hawk, from cinematographer and director Jingle Ma. A formulaic superhero story set in the hi-tech future, the film boasts considerable visual flair and a touch of humour.

 It is an action-packed kung fu movie with Michelle Yeoh displaying her outstanding physical prowess. Co-starring Luke Goss ? the evil dude from Blade II ? Yeoh plays the femme fatale, The Silver Hawk, who has to protect the futuristic Polaris City.

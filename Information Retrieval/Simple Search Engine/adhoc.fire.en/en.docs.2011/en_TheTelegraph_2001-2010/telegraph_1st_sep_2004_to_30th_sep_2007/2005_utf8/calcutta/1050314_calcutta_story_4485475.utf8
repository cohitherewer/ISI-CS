The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get thru this week without?

Cheering Team India at Eden

No Calcuttan worth his cricket knowhow can afford to miss out on the second India-Pakistan 

Test from March 16. The teams trooped in on Sunday and the wishlist of off-pitch 

action lined up for them ranges from antakshari (!) to all-action nights 

at Sourav?s. But the focal point remains the field, for more reasons than one. 

Here are just a few. Team India flattered only to horribly deceive at Mohali, 

so Eden is where the series could be won and lost. Sachin Tendulkar fell six short 

of his 35th ton, so Eden is where today?s Little Master could eclipse yesterday?s 

Little Master. The Prince of Calcutta batted like a pauper in Mohali, so Eden 

could be where he regains his feet... 

Rooting for Jassi?s new look

The plain Jane of Indian television, who has had the gall to challenge the saas 

bahu prime time fiefdom, is getting a makeover and you can?t help but watch 

the drama unfold through the week with bated breath (or maybe not). A new hairstyle 

has done wonders for Jassi?s looks and one simply can?t wait for the nerdy specs 

and braces to go too. Take care not to switch channels, though, during the blatant 

product pushing and brand building exercise by the sponsors within the soap itself, 

for you are quite liable to mistake it to for a commercial break!

Catching Chai Pani Etc

If you are into urban multiplex-styled storylines, and with loyalty for a local 

talent, Chai Pani Etc could be your night?s ticket to entertainment this 

week. With Konkona in a double role, the ?satirical comedy? named after the familiar 

cry at government offices (minus the Etc, one presumes) is billed to be 

cool timepass.

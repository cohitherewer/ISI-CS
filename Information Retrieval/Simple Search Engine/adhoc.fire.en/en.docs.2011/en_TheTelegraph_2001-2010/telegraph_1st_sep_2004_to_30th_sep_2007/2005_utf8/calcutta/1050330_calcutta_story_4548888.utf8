The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rate cut binds agents against carrier 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?Our survival is at stake. We need to fight together. We have no choice. It?s a do-or-die situation.?

 This is how the year?s first joint meeting of the eastern region chapters of the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) and the Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) began on Tuesday afternoon. 

 The emergency meeting was called to draw up a one-point demand to protest Air-India?s slashing of ticket commission for travel agents from seven per cent to five per cent, effective May 1.

 TAFI?s eastern region chairman Anil Punjabi made no bones about the urgency of the situation. ?If we let them do this now, then it will soon fall to three per cent, and down to zero in the next few months. About 30 per cent of the 400,000 travel agents in the country will lose their jobs.?

 Early last year, the industry had run into the same problem with Lufthansa. Within two weeks of travel agents boycotting the German airlines, Lufthansa had done a turnaround. 

 It is hoped that a similar reaction will be evinced by the national carrier. The eastern region alone sells around Rs 3 crore worth of Air-India tickets.

 ?If the government does this, then all the other international airlines will immediately follow suit. So we can?t afford to give up,? stressed Sanjoy Sett, chairman, eastern region, TAAI. ?The government will also lose revenue, with reduction in sales tax and no TDS (tax deducted at source). In fact, TAAI president Balbir Mayal is supposed to meet ministers Praful Patel and Renuka Choudhury in Delhi today.?

 A task force was also created at Tuesday?s meeting, with two members each from TAAI and TAFI, to monitor the situation. ?Anyone who supports Air-India will lose the association?s support,? warned Sett and Punjabi. 

 Not that it was necessary. All the members present were in complete agreement.

 Members were also designated to meet state government ministers and MPs, and garner support from political circles. On Tuesday, however, the two associations marched up to Air-India?s office and handed the letter to the officials. It described the move by the national carrier as ?unjustified?, and showed ?complete disregard to the welfare of the single largest distribution arm of Air-India?.

 The north and south regional chapters of TAAI and TAFI have already placed their demands. The western region is the only one left.

 ?But from April 1, we will boycott Air-India sales and promotions, by order from our headquarters,? added Sett. ?We assure the airlines a virtually risk-free business, so we must be protected. The commission is our right. Even paanwalas get more commission than us.?

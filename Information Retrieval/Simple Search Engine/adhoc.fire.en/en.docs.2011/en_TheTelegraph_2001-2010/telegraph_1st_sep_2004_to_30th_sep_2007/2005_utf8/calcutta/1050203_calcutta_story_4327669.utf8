 Machiavellian tragedy

 A family drama with a dark Machiavellian twist, Mukhomukhis latest production Aarohan is built around the theme of lust for power and money. A story of theft and greed, plots and counter-plots, the play shocks us into the awareness that in today?s materialistic society, emotions like love and affection have ceased to exist, even within the family. The play revolves around Madhumita, who sees in her brothers? new business venture an opportunity to grab the maximum wealth for herself. Driven by evil ambition, she hatches a plot against her brothers; even her husband?s failing health cannot deter her from her sinister purpose. No less a match for her is her brother Tarakdas, who, too, does not hesitate to resort to dishonest, corrupt means to secure his ends. Aarohan confronts us with a world where siblings are pitted against one another in a bitter rivalry for extracting personal gain. Full of hatred, jealousy, selfishness and animosity, we discover, to our horror, that this is a world all too familiar to us. Drama, direction and acting: Soumitra Chattapadhyay.

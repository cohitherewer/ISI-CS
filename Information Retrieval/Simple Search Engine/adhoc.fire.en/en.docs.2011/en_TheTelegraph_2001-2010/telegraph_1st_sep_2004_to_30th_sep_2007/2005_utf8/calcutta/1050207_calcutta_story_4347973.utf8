The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

Gearing up for Valentine?s Day

If Valentine diamonds, flowers, candies and chocolates on offer have got you seeing 

red already, it?s a good idea to have a squabble or dump your date for the time 

being, anything to wriggle out of the love game which is getting more expensive 

by the minute. If you continue to wear your heart on your sleeve, however, try 

charming them with a candlelight dinner instead, which gives you an opportunity 

to impress them double by trying your hand at some of their favourite dishes. 

What if it?s far from palatable, you might ask. Well then, just kiss and make 

up!

Impressing Saraswati

The goddess of learning and wisdom is coming to town well after the book fair, 

so you can?t grumble about not getting enough opportunity to impress her. If you?ve 

been too tied up to read the fine print though, drag yourself to the neighbourhood 

library or bookstore before the lady in white finds out about your ignoble ignorance. 

If nothing else, treat the occasion as an excuse to 

bunk work and finish that paperback you?ve been sitting on for the past six months!

Planning a Mt Everest summit

So what if the idyllic Himalayan kingdom of Nepal seems out of bounds from your 

holiday itinerary for the time being? Rise higher than the din of monarchy vs 

democracy and plan an Everest trip instead. Peer down on the mess below from your 

cloudy abode with a superior air? That you won?t have much of it to breathe is 

a different matter altogether!

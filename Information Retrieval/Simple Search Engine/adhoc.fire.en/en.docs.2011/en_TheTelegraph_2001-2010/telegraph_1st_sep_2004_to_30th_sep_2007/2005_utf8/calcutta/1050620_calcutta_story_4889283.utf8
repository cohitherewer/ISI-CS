 - FREE AND FAIR POLL ?EXCESSES?

 Elections in Salt Lake had always been, according to observers and the authorities, ?peaceful?. But not on Sunday, as the police decided to act tough to prevent parties from employing unfair means to win the townships?s civic board. And the activists of the ruling CPM were the ones who bore the brunt of the free-and-fair-poll drive. 

 Even though a 10,000-strong force had been stationed in the township since Saturday, a large number of CPM activists from adjoining Lake Town, Bangur, Nagerbazar and Belghoria managed to sneak in to ?help? their comrades on the D-day.

 But the police were in no mood to let this happen, and started acting barely two hours after the polling began on Sunday. 

 9.30 am, Apeejay School in BH Block: A police contingent, which included a dozen commandos, arrived in front of the school and rushed towards the camps of political parties, chasing away activists. A few youths sitting at roadside tea stalls, too, were sent away. 

 An altercation, followed by a scuffle, broke out between the cops and a group of CPM workers when the latter were asked to vacate their camps. As the activists refused to budge, the cops, armed with lathis, started chasing them. An officer announced that only three persons would be allowed in a camp. Within minutes, the entire area became almost deserted ? the only ones to stay back were voters, who were watching the action with trepidation from a distance, and poll officials. 

 10.30 am, Baisakhi Abasan. A convoy of around 20 vehicles stopped at the gate of Baisakhi Abasan and over 100 cops, including commandos and personnel from the Rapid Action Force and Combat Force, charged towards the makeshift political camps. The men were armed with pipeguns, SLRs, lathis, teargas canisters and shields.

 Caught unawares, people panicked and ran in all directions and shopkeepers downed their shutters. The cops surrounded a CPM camp and chased away the volunteers. 

 Here, too, an altercation ensued between the cadre and the force. As activists from the other camps gathered on the spot, a scuffle broke out between them and police. The cops started throwing away chairs from the camps, directing partymen not to sit more than three at a time in a camp. 

 CPM candidate Nandagopal Bhattacharya tried in vain to convince the officers that polling was ?peaceful? in his ward and that no one had complained against his partymen.

 11.30, AE block: The men in uniform, immediately after getting off their vehicles, drove out the youths who had gathered in front of the local market. As Trinamul Congress supporters alleged that hundreds of outsiders had gathered near the booth to cast false votes, the cops rushed towards an overcrowded CPM camp and repeated the cleansing act.

 At the end of the polling, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty charged police with committing ?excesses?. But North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said the cops had just followed the instructions of the election commission. ?If anybody was injured, I have nothing to say.?

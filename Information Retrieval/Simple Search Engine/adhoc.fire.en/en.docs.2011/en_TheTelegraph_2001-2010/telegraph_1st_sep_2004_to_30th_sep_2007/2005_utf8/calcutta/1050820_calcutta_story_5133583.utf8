 Inquiry into peon assault

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eastern Railway has ordered an inquiry against the senior divisional commercial manager (SDCM), Sealdah, for allegedly assaulting a peon in his office.

 Peon Pradip Kumar Sardar alleged that SDCM Amritangshu had beaten him up severely on Thursday when he went into the official?s room. Sardar has been admitted to BR Singh Hospital.

 ?We have started an inquiry against Amritangshu, though no formal complaint has been lodged against him,? Radhey Shyam, divisional railway manager (DRM), Sealdah, said on Friday.

 On Thursday, a staff member from the railway chief commercial manager?s office went to meet SDCM Amritangshu. After over an hour?s wait, the visitor requested Sardar to remind Amritangshu that he wanted to meet him.

 ?I went inside the SDCM?s room and as soon as I told him about the visitor, he started raining blows on me,? Sardar said from his hospital bed. 

 ?I fell down and he started kicking me. He was about to hit me with his belt when I managed to escape from the room. Then I lost consciousness,? he added.

 An FIR was lodged with Narkeldanga police station against Amritangshu, who filed a counter-FIR.

 Group-D staff of the railway gheraoed the SDCM?s office till late on Thursday afternoon. Only after senior officials held out the assurance of a probe did they withdraw the siege.

 ?Amritangshu has denied the charges and claimed that no such incident took place,? DRM Radhey Shyam said.

 Eastern Railway Men?s Union has threatened to start an agitation if Amritangshu was not removed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without

 Reading up on the Basu regime

 Forget about his years spent in the states hot seat. It is nonagenarian Jyoti Basus fitness regime that we should turn our attention to. If the former chief minister is still looking good at 91, and up to meeting thousands of schoolchildren as part of his birthday celebrations on Friday, it is worth finding out as much as possible about how the CPI (M) stalwart has stayed in such good shape. Dismiss all rumours of quarterly face-lifts and admire his inner glow instead.

 Signing up for spin class

 If the Basu way of beating the years doesnt appeal to you, join a gym for spin class instead. The global rage has finally hit fitness centres in town, and it might be worth a try. It doesnt matter that these one-hour workouts are essentially glamourised stints on the stationary bike. Shell out a packet to sit pretty on a cycle, pretending to go uphill and downhill, burning those calories with the rest of the gang. Otherwise, dust off your kiddie bike and go for a real spin on your lonesome ownsome.

 Dyeing your hair black

 If you are positively sick and tired of everyone around you suddenly taking a blonde turn, make an anti-establishment style statement of your own. Cover up last months hair streaks with a jet black global dye. Stand out in a crowd by going back to your natural roots.

 Making a list of offensive ads

 From inappropriate references about eve teasing to sell a new car swiftly to steamy acts in public places as a pitch to kids craving a cold dessert. Blurred out images of near-naked men to tasteless offers to rid you of your kidney stones... What is wrong with our ad men of late? While much is made of skin show in cinema, utterly unnecessary sexual content and off-colour advertising goes without comment. Make a list of the offensive ads you see all around and start a word-of-mouth slander stunt of your own.

 Pondering over Matrubhoomi

 You may have sleepless nights after watching the Manish Jha film but all movies are not about loving your parents! Stripping naked the painful reality that still exists in our country, Matrubhoomi explores the plight of a woman who is raped by almost every male resident of a village. Shocking, but a must-watch.

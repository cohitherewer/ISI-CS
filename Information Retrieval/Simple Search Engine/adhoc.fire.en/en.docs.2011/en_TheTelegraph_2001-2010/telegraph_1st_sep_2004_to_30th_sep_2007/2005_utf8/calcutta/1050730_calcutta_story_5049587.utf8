 ID checks at gates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Shaken by Wednesday?s kiss-and-run case at Shyamaprasad College, the authorities have come up with a scheme to ensure that outsiders don?t come anywhere near the campus.

 Young men, especially those on two-wheelers, engaged in adda in the vicinity of a college, might be dragged to the local police station if they fail to produce proof of identity of being students of the institution. 

 ?We cannot stop our own students from loitering near our college gates. But, we will not allow a single youth who is not our student to hang around near our premises,? said Gyanankur Goswami, principal of Shyamaprasad College, where late on Wednesday, an outsider had kissed a first-year student and fled.

 One of the favourite hang-outs of students of Shyamaprasad College, Asutosh College, Jogmaya Devi College and a nearby management institute is the vicinity of Bhowanipore police station.

 ?Young people are seen here from early morning till evening. It is not possible for the colleges to identify the outsiders. So, we will request the police to check on the youths? identity. Those who won?t be able to produce their college ID cards may be taken to the police station,? Goswami said. 

 Young men from Metiabruz and Kidderpore are often seen roaming near Shyamaprasad College.

 College Street and the areas near Bhawanipur College, Bangabasi College and Surendranath College are some other spots where police will be asked to conduct surprise ID checks, sources in the college said.

 The West Bengal Principals? Council has convened a meeting on Saturday, where the issue of the girl students? security will be taken up, council secretary Kalachand Saha said. ?We are worried over the two incidents in Presidency and Shyamaprasad colleges within a span of nine days. We will have to immediately take measures to stop recurrence of such incidents,? Saha said. 

 He revealed that principals are even considering engaging private security agencies in each of the 100-odd colleges located in the city proper. 

 ?We need private security personnel, because there were instances when goons had threatened college-appointed guards when they stopped them from entering the campus,? council secretary Saha said.

 The principals have also decided to approach the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to improve street-lighting in front of the colleges, particularly those which run evening classes.

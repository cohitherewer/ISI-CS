Life

 Behind the bar

 You might have stocked your bar with the finest of Scotch whiskys, but serving them in beer mugs or Champagne flutes would not only do gross injustice to the amber spirit, the act will flaunt your bartending ignorance to full effect. Similarly, beer served in a wine glass would simply not suit the mood of the drink. Getting the glass right is perhaps the most important part of bar etiquette, without which all the right ingredients might spoil a perfectly good cocktail. 

 Goodlife draws up a list of the most common glasses and puts them to best possible use.

 Highball

 This tall and slender glass is designed to enhance the long and refreshing quality of the drink. Perhaps the most universal glass

 Also called: Collins Glass; Large Rocks

 Recommended for: beer, cola drinks, Long Island Ice Tea, gin tonic and vodka tonic

 Shot Glass

 Used mostly for serving shots, this useful glass can also double as a handy measuring tool

 Also called: Jigger

 Recommended for: all shots

 Brandy Snifter

 Used primarily to serve brandy and after-dinner drinks, this is designed to be held in the palm of ones hand to add a slight warmth to the drink. This is a good-looking glass that will impress your guest. If you do not have a snifter, simply substitute it with a wine glass

 Recommended for: brandy, liqueurs

 Cocktail Glass

 Mostly used for Martinis or cocktails ordered straight up, this glass has become very trendy and is used to add a touch of style to any drink. The long stem is meant to be held, which ensures the cocktail stays cool

 Also called: Martini glass

 Flute

 This tall, slender cone-shaped glass makes the most of Champagne, designed to show off its sparkling bubbles

 Also called: Champagne glass

 Recommended for: Champagne, Mimosa

 Old Fashion

 Used mostly for mixed drinks or for drinks ordered on the rocks

 Also called: Small Rocks

 Recommended for: Gimlet, Old Fashion

 Wine Glass

 Mostly used for serving white and red wine, this glass has a long stem and large body. The classic look makes it very versatile. You can use this glass to serve almost any drink from an ale to a White Russian

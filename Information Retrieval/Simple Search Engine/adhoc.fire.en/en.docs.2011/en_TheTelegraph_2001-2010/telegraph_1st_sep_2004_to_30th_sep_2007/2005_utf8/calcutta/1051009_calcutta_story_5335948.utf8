Konark

 (Top and above) The Sun temple at Konark

 It?s baffling when a modern habitation clings on to the past for its life force. As if carrying the memory of people long gone is its only reason to continue surviving. Apart from gaping at it, the imposing Sun temple blurs out any other form of occupation at Konark, a quiet little town that sleeps at sundown and wakes up with sunrise. And it?s more than just tourism that forces people to live with it.

 The Sun temple was built by King Narsimha Deva of the Ganga dynasty in the 13th century. Legend says the king had employed 12,000 workers to finish the temple in 12 years, failing which all heads were to roll. But placing a huge magnet atop the temple posed to be the biggest hurdle for the masons. The principal mason?s teenaged son came to their rescue; he finished the job using a simple scientific method and also jumped to death to save the city from mass murder.

 There are several theories on what caused the temple to disintegrate ? the most plausible one being the plundering by Muslim invaders and later by the Raja of Khurda. Chunks of the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) kept falling off till the early 20th century, when Lt General Lord Woodburn took the initiative to plug the hollow spaces with sand, preventing further damage. 

 The temple resembles the Sun god?s chariot, resting on 24 wheels of about 10-ft in diameter each with a set of spokes and intricate carvings. Seven horses pull the chariot, while two lions stand guard at the entrance from where a flight of steps leads to the temple.

 Over centuries, the salty sea breeze has eaten into the intricate artwork on the temple walls. The builders hadn?t gauged that the stone used would prove so vulnerable. However, a lot of stone carvings has been restored with foreign expertise after the temple was listed as a World Heritage Site.

 Erotic carvings are dominant, and kings, queens, courtiers and courtesans seem to be frozen in time. Tales of desire and deprivation ring through the columns in a perfect synthesis of art and science.

 Besides the main building, the bhog mandapa, the remnants of a kitchen, the nat mandir and several other scattered structures reveal a complete view of life. What is amazing is that not a single design is replicated.

 Since Konark is the only temple in Orissa that doesn?t worship a god, you can happily tiptoe around with your shoes on without a panda watching every step you take.

 If you happen to land at Konark in the afternoon, wait till the tourists have cleared out of the temple premises at sunset. Then climb up the flight of stairs that run to the top of the thick boundary wall and sit, gazing at the temple. On a full moon night, the temple exudes a ghostly sepulchral light.

 Just a few yards away from the temple compound is Navaranga, the house of nine gods believed to rule the cosmos.

 The Bay of Bengal used to brush against the temple?s courtyard once upon a time; now it has retreated about 3 km, leaving tell-tale signs all around. To reach the beach you can hitch a rickshaw ride or just walk along the main road lined with casuarina and cashewnut trees. 

 The Chandrabhaga beach, named after a river that has now dried up, is treacherous. You never know when a seemingly mild ripple will lash your feet with gusto and maybe just sweep you away. 

 There aren?t too many bathers on this beach, so you can just sit on the shore and gaze at the green waves. Mornings are quite breathtaking here, when soft sun streaks pierce through clouds and fishermen toss their dinghies on the frothy waters.

 If you manage to squeeze in an extra day, take a trip to the Ramchandi temple, situated 8 km from Konark. It?s worth stopping for the breath-taking view of the confluence of river Kushabhadra and the Bay of Bengal.

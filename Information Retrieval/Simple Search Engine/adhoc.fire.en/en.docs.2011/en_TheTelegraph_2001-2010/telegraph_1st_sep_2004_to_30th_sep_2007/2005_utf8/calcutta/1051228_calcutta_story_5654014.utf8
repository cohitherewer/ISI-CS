 Song-and-dance score ?05

 Which is the best song of the year? Dance floor favourites Kajra re, Woh lamhey and Dus bahane mdash; all remixed and re-shot mdash; lead the listeners rsquo; list as the old-school melodies follow the fast flock

 1. When Alisha Chinai was asked by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy to sing the mujra, she asked, ldquo;How in the world will I sing it? rdquo; But the trio wanted that ldquo;strain and discomfiture rdquo; in the voice to go with Aishwarya Rai rsquo;s jhatkas. None of them knew, though, that with a whopping 45.6 per cent votes, the Gulzar-penned Ash-Amitabh-Abhishek item number would turn out to be the song of 2005

 2. The credits may read Mithun Sharma and Sayeed Quadri, but the real creator of the song is singer Atif Aslam rsquo;s original Pakistani band Jal. When you add Udita Goswami rsquo;s bare back to this, you have one of the most played songs of the year, which is Number Two on the list with 29.2 per cent votes

 3. You don rsquo;t need 10 excuses to listen to this pulsating pelvic-shaker from Dus. The Vishal-Shekhar song came with the opening credits and had the two young heartthrobs Abhishek Bachchan and Zayed Khan ruling the ramp. It rsquo;s third on the list with 14.2 per cent votes

 4. Sassy and sexy, the team of Sunidhi Chauhan, Shantanu Moitra and Swanand Kirkire came together to create this Rekha item song. Saxophone, trumpets, drums... it was straight out of the black-and-white Hollywood movies. Sadly, it could only manage fourth spot

 5. No two people could bring alive the slow burning of romance as M.M. Kreem and Gulzar. And with Shah Rukh and Rani doing the lip-sync honours, the Sonu-Shreya song only gets more magical with every tune-in. Perhaps too classy for the masses, it finds itself at the bottom of the bunch

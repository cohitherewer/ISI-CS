 Iron fist, tidy Lakes

 - SAVE-THE-SAROBAR ORDER ON CLUBS

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Stung by strictures of the high court and criticism from environmentalists for the neglect of Rabindra Sarobar (Dhakuria Lakes) and its surroundings, the state government has issued a dos-and-don?ts diktat for clubs operating from there.

 Violation of any of these conditions will attract ?stern action?, including cancellation of the lease, cash penalty or even prosecution.

 The dos and don?ts have been issued by the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), responsible for the maintenance of the Sarobar.

 Conditions include introduction of a scientific system for solid waste management, improvement of the drainage and sewerage system, a ban on plastic items in the area, upkeep of greenery, prevention of pollution and ensuring proper use of the water.

 The clubs will also have to ensure that no biomass is burnt on the compound, law and order is not violated, a healthy atmosphere is maintained, no part of the expanse is encroached upon and rules and regulations set by the pollution control board and the high court are adhered to.

 ?All the clubs will have to fulfil the criteria. Any violation will result in cancellation of the lease, cash penalty or prosecution,?? asserted A.K. Ganai, officer on special duty, CIT.

 ?We have written to the clubs, seeking information about their activities at the Lakes. We have also asked them to state what they have done to prevent water pollution and protect greenery,? he added.

 The CIT has leased out space to 10 clubs at the Lakes against a monthly rent. Officials said an experts? team would visit the clubs to verify whether their replies to the queries were true or not. 

 The government?s move follows complaints from various quarters, especially environmentalists, that the clubs operating from the Lakes are neglecting its environment. 

 Most clubs, according to CIT officials, have canteens with cooking facilities. Along with organising water sports and cultural activities, they regularly host parties. But seldom do the authorities take any step to keep the area clean.

 The high court on several occasions had directed the government to stop the menace. It has also ordered eviction of squatters along the rail tracks beside the Lakes between Ballygunge and Tollygunge.

 ?A lot of money is being spent to carry out the court order. We won?t allow the clubs to litter the area,? Ganai said.

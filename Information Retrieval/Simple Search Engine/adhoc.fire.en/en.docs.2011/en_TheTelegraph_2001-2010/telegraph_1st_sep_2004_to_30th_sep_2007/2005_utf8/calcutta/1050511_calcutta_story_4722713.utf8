 Trap trio in heat torment

 A scorching sun and blasts of hot air from the west tormented Calcutta on Tuesday.

 The weatherman warned that the hot spell would continue for the next two days, with no immediate sign of a thunderstorm.

 ?We feel the city will have to bear with this hot spell for the next 48 hours as there is no discernible system favourable for the build-up of a thunderstorm,? said K.K. Chakraborty, acting deputy director general of meteorology at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore.

 Officials blamed three weather conditions prevailing since Monday for the build-up of intense heat and humidity.

 Firstly, dry hot winds have started blowing into Calcutta and rest of south Bengal from the west, at an altitude of 1.5 km and above.

 Then, below the 1.5-km level, moisture-laden winds are coming in from a south-westerly direction over the Bay of Bengal. 

 ?This means we are getting a lot of hot air blowing in from the western part of the country in the upper level and a lot of moisture from the sea in the lower level. This explains the heat and the humidity,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section.

 Another reason for the discomfort is the inability of the heat, accumulated in the city and its adjoining areas on Monday, to escape. ?The heavy incursion of moisture has led to formation of a haze over Calcutta and its adjoining areas preventing the night heat from escaping,? said Debnath.

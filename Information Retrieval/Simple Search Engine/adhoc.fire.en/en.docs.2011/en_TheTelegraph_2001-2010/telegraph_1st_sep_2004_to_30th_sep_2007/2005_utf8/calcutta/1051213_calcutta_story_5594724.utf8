 Give and share, spread the smile

 Along with loads of fun contests and games, all the toddlers of My Montessori and Playhouse had amazing gifts in store for them at the end of the sports meet on their campus on December 11. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 Thank you, God! You have given me a home and a family. I realised how lucky I am only after I was taken on a visit to an orphanage on December 7.

 The two-storeyed building housed 70 children, most under 10 years of age. I felt very sad when I met a child of my age who had been found by the wayside. Many of the other children had also come from the roadside.

 Earlier, we had made greeting cards and sold them. The money we collected was given to the children of the orphanage to bring a little happiness into their lives.

 We had taken along a carrom board, a tape recorder and a few cassettes to entertain the children. We also distributed chocolates among them.

 After the visit, I realised that these children would never get the love I receive from my family. If each of us can give even little things to the children in orphanages, it would bring them much happiness.

 Know your rights

 Loreto College, the only one in the city offering a BA course on human rights starting this year, celebrated Human Rights Awareness Day on November 26.

 The programme started with a play by Vijay Dalvi, called Maiyyat, performed by the Rangakarmee Study Group and directed by Usha Ganguli. The play delineates the essential futility of the aspirations of the ?lower caste? to reach a higher status in a corrupt feudalistic society, even though it is not for materialistic gains but to ensure a better afterlife.

 The play involving vocal and instrumental music, mesmerised the audience. A panel discussion on ?Human Rights and the Indian Penal Code? followed. A question-answer session, which delved into topics like capital punishment, women?s rights and corruption in the government, brought the programme to a close.

 Sporting spirit

 Rozel Arora (Class VI), Avinash Singh (Class VIII), Vivek Pipalia (Class X), Debopriya Mukherjee and Rajesh Mehra (Class XII) were adjudged the best athletes in various competitions at the annual sports meet of Birla High School, held at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) complex, recently. Shivaji house won the Best House trophy after a very close contest with Netaji house. Tagore house bagged the prize for its marchpast.

 After the marchpast, drill display, pyramid formation and a tableaux on the origin of sports were put up by middle-school students. The audience enjoyed the karate display the most. Ridhu Jain of Class IX lay down on a bed of nails and a pile of burning tiles was broken with bare hands by another student of martial arts. In the tug of war between students of classes XI, XII and the teachers, the latter made it to the victory stand this year. Races were also organised for teachers, parents and the other staff members of the school

 AIDS Day

 Physician Manish Shankar Chakraborty was the guest lecturer at our school on World AIDS Day. During the interaction, we were shocked to learn that India accounts for one-third of the total HIV-infected population of the world. All of us have vowed to do our best to spread awareness about this dreaded disease.

 College ties

 New Alipore College celebrated its annual social on December 1. Nipabithi Ghosh presented a memorable medley of songs like Tup Tup Brishti and some evergreen Bengali hits of Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle and Kishore Kumar. 

 But the day undoubtedly belonged to Shamik, who rocked the audience with Lagle Bolo, Emma and hits of Manna De like Jibone ki pabona. 

 The programme came to an end with the unforgettable track Pal from the Indian Idol series. It made us, the third year students, very nostalgic and we realised that this was one of our very last get-togethers in college.

 Fresh start

 The students? union of CU?s evening section of its College Street campus organised the annual freshers? welcome programme, Parichay 2005,this November.

 After a cultural extravaganza, the crowd swayed to the tunes of Bengali and Hindi movie numbers sung by current and former students.

 Richter Scale was a slight let-down, but its choreography and music salvaged the performance.

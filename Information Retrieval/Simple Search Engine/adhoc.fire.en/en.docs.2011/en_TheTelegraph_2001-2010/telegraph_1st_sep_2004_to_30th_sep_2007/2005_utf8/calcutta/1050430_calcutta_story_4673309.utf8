 Brief course for cash boost

 - B-school mulls full-time, one-year module to raise resources

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Wanted: working professionals. Motivation: value addition for the target audience, revenue surge for the institute.

 That seems to be the writing on the notice board at the Joka campus of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM).

 The institute is finalising plans to launch a full-time, one-year MBA course, on the lines of courses offered in the best B-schools across the globe, by 2006. ?Principally, we are convinced that we should have a short version of the MBA course for candidates with job experience. We plan to start it from 2006,? said Anup Sinha, dean, programme initiatives, IIM Calcutta.

 IIM Ahmedabad has already started advertising for its one-year, full-time, post-graduate management programme for executives, starting April 2, 2006. Executives of 27 years and above can apply with their GMAT scores for the course, priced at Rs 8 lakh. The Calcutta programme will be priced and modelled on the lines of the Ahmedabad course and students will be offered placement assistance. The annual course fee for the regular two-year programme is Rs 1.5 lakh.

 With grants from the Central government drying up, the IIMs are facing a cash crunch. 

 ?We are introducing such programmes because we need to increase our revenues if we have to reduce our dependence on government grants. Since we are not free to increase fees for the two-year programme, we have to look at such options,? admitted Sinha.

 After finalising the entrance procedures and course curriculum, the proposal will be placed before the IIM board of governors, headed by ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar.

 The authorities at Joka are confident that the course will be an instant hit among executives. ?The response to our distance-learning programmes and the interest generated by the Ahmedabad course indicate the demand for short-duration value-add programmes,? observed Sinha.

 The other new initiative on the drawing board is the introduction of weekend classes for the three-year evening programme for working professionals ? against the present format of thrice-a-week classes on working days at IIM?s Ho Chi Minh Sarani address ? to give students from the city?s outskirts a realistic chance to enrol.

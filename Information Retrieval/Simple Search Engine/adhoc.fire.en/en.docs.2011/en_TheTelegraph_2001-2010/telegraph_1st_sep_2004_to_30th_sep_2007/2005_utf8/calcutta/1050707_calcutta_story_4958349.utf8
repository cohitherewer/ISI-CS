 Appeal to shun sale of fauna 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Wednesday appealed to the people not to buy or sell birds and animals of Indian origin. 

 The appeal comes a couple of days before Rathyatra, when trade in wildlife flourishes in fairs across the city.

 ?Trade in birds and animals is banned under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Keeping birds as pets is a crime. We have issued the appeal now as a huge volume of business is carried out at the Rath melas,? said Vinod Kumar Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden.

 A forest department official said: ?We have alerted all the enforcement agencies, including the police, BSF, railway authorities and the customs. We have also asked the city police commissioner to step up vigilance during the festival.?

 While trading in Indian birds and animals within the country is banned, buying and selling of wildlife between countries is governed by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES).

 The convention has since 1973 published a list (appendix) of endangered birds and animals. The animals/birds are graded according to their endangerment on the list, and only those exempted can be traded between countries. That too, only if there are import and export licences. Seventy-three countries, including India, are signatories to CITES. 

 Over the past year, the forest department has rescued about 1,800 birds (including some endangered species) in Calcutta and another 2,500 in the districts. The birds have mainly been rescued from markets in Galiff Street, Boral in Garia and Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24-Parganas. They were taken to rescue centres and then released across Salt Lake and the city.

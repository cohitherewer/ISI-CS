The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Puja shoppers are thronging the market areas in the city and hawkers are doing brisk business. However, many of the roadside sellers stock second-hand garments, most of which are sourced illegally from NGOs. Along with various other aid, developed countries often donate used clothes to charitable organisations in Third-World countries. Instead of thoroughly cleaning these garments and distributing them amongst the needy, the NGOs sell off the dirty clothes to the hawkers. The authorities should crack down on this racket in the city.

 Although there is a bus passenger shed on the Hiland Park side of EM Bypass, there is none on the opposite side of the road. Passengers have to brave rain and sun to board buses on desired routes. I request the authorities to construct a shed there at the earliest.

 A significant portion of the passage and stairway of the subway at Sealdah station has been occupied by drug addicts. With the area near the dump behind the subway being partially fenced off, the addicts now haunt the subway even in broad daylight. They quarrel among themselves and litter the place. Are the authorities doing anything to stop this nuisance? 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at... 

Amarkantak

Amarkantak is a good place to go for weary souls sick 

of city life and on the lookout for an extended weekend getaway. It offers a respite 

to tired minds. Nestled in the southern part of Madhya Pradesh?s Shahdol district, 

the pilgrim resort flanked by the Maikal hills lies on the boundary that separates 

Rewa, Jabalpur and Bilaspur districts.

 The charming destination at a height of about 1,000 m marks the source of the three mighty rivers of central India ? the Narmada, Sone and the Johila. If you are yearning to spend some time in the cradle of nature, pack your bags and hop on to the next train bound for Amarkantak.

 Trains stop at Bilaspur and Pendra Road, a nondescript, grimy town in Chhattisgarh. The journey from Pendra Road to the pilgrim point of Amarkantak is a bone-jarring one, marked by close encounters with the rock-hugging valleys of Kiran Ghat and Karangara forest, infested with rich floral diversity that bears a resemblance to the central and north-western Himalayan flora. The vast forestlands of Bhundokona, Jaleshwar and Amanala on the way are treasure-troves of nature.

 At Amarkantak, the temple of Narmada Mata is the most prominent shrine and records a huge turnout of pilgrims every year. The fast-flowing Narmada has its origin in Narmada Kund, located in the imposing temple complex. At a distance of four-and-a-half km from the temple complex is Mai ki Bagiya, the confluence of the rivers Sone and Bhadra.

 Another six-km drive from the source of the river brings you to the enchanting, tranquil Kapil Dhara that exudes an old-world charm. One of the highest waterfalls fed by the Narmada, Kapil Dhara marks the union of the three mighty ranges of central India ? Satpura, Vindhya and Maikal.

 The ancient miniature ashram of sage Kapil stands here. The torrential waters of the Narmada gush down the slope, cutting across rocky terrain from a height of about 3,200 m, creating unusual echoes. Legend has it that this was once the medieval town of Amarkantak. Trek one-and-a-half km downhill and enjoy glimpses of cascading white foaming waters ? the Dudh Dhara falls. In nearby Jaleshwar Dham, a pristine landscape marks the source of the river Johila.

A brief sojourn in the hill resort guarantees peace 

of mind and sights for sore eyes.

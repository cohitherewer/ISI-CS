Healthy body, healthy mind is the mantra that has caught the fancy of couture kings all around. These words were scribbled on a condom packet placed inside a stainless steel tiffin box handed out at Rajesh Pratap Singhs show at the India Fashion Week in Delhi. A fortnight later, another designer spoke the same words in a totally different context.

 Sabyasachi Mukherjee, brand ambassador for the city branch of the California-based Golds Gym chain, spoke about the importance of fitness in modern lifestyles on Wednesday.

 If you are wondering why the star designer was chosen alongside the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sanjay Dutt, the global and Mumbai brand ambassadors of the chain, the answer is all about image.

 Sabyasachi is the Calcutta boy right now, said Divya Himatsinghka, director, Ideal Gymnasium, the company bringing the Hollywood stars favourite gym to Calcutta in June.

 Everybody knows who he is and that he has made it big through hard work. So we thought he would be the perfect choice for our brand ambassador, added Divya.

 For the man used to making style statements, this platform gave him a chance to make a social statement. With growing fame and power comes responsibility, a truth that dawned upon me when I saw Spiderman, smiled the designer.

 At the risk of sounding vain, I have become a youth icon in the city. My rags-to-riches story has influenced a lot of young people, and not just in the field of fashion, he admitted. Thats why I think I can create awareness about the importance of fitness, he stressed.

 Many of the problems plaguing the planet are the result of unhealthy minds. I firmly believe a healthy mind stems from a healthy body. A group of fit people in a room exude a positive energy that is very necessary in every walk of life.

 The designer feels that the lack of fitness among Calcuttans is a major hindrance to the citys development. There is a lethargic energy in the city that has to be got rid of. Only then can we tap the immense creative potential that lies here and channelise it properly.

 That doesnt mean mirroring the waif-like bodies that have permeated the fashion world he is part of. Anorexia is on its way out. The whole concept of starving yourself, living on a diet of cigarettes and alcohol and developing bulimia is totally pass?. Eating healthy and working out is the motto with international stars and models now and our Indian models should also realise this, he advised.

 As for himself, the busy bee plans to start gymming from June 1, as Golds Gym ups its shutters in the city. So far I have never been into working out. But now I realise its essential to have a fit body in order to perform continuously. I hope to have a well-toned body in three months from now, he grinned.

 Work, as always, will keep Pepsi on his toes, too. For starters, the star is heading for Mumbai this weekend to complete negotiations regarding his second designing venture for a Bollywood film, after Black.

 Its a big banner film that Im going to sign this weekend, but I cant divulge the details as yet, he said.

 The coming months will also see Sabyasachi strengthening his international presence. The style ace will soon be off to London to showcase his Fashion Week collection at Browns, where his work debuted ? and was well received ? last season. This will be followed by a similar trip to Saks Fifth Avenue in New York in June.

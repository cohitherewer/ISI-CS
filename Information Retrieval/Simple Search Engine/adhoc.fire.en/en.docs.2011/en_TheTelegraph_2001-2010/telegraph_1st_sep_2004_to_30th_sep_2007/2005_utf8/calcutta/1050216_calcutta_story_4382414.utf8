 Record on wheels

 - 60-year-old prepares for Guinness spot

 Bhonsle: Pedalling to honour

 He has set records in India and Malaysia and is now eyeing a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.

 Meet Shashi Kumar Bhonsle, a 60-year-old who claims to hold the world record for the longest number of hours spent on a bicycle, and plans to validate that from the record book that matters, soon.

 Bhonsle is in Calcutta trying to garner funds for his Guinness trip to Canada. ?On March 25, I will attempt to set the record in front of Guinness officials by cycling for 251 hours in Toronto,? says the Maharashtrian, who has spent most of his life in Darjeeling. That would beat the current world record of 191 hours held by a Portuguese. 

 But it?s not just going round and round on a bicycle for hours that Bhonsle is capable of, he also entertains his audience in the process. ?I bathe, make an omelette and try to involve the crowd as much as possible,? he says.

 Bhonsle took to cycling like every other teenager but it was only when he was 20 that cycling became a passion and he thought of the possibilities. ?I was in Mumbai when I read about an Indian who had cycled non-stop for 124 hours. That really inspired me and I thought someday I must beat this record,? Bhonsle recalls.

 Hard work in the form of long hours of practice was essential, but it was something the man really enjoyed doing. ?I have cycled for 225 hours in Calcutta?s Northern Park in 1968, 132 hours in Darjeeling in 1973 and 245 hours in Sikkim in 1994.? 

 But the real achievement was in Kuala Lumpur in 1997, when he cycled continuously for 247 hours.

 Right now, Bhonsle is scouting for sponsors to make the trip to Canada and make India proud. ?I have approached the Sikkim government and it has agreed to give me Rs 50,000, while the Gorkha Hill Council has offered to put in another Rs 30,000. The West Bengal government, too, has promised Rs 50,000.? 

 The cyclist is looking towards private sponsors to fill in the remaining amount, his budget being around Rs 2.5 lakh.

 But why so late and not try something like Limca Book of Records first? ?The only recognition I ever looked for was from the Guinness Book and I promised myself I would attempt that only when I was absolutely ready,? smiles Bhonsle.

 The wheel, he believes, is finally set to turn in his favour now.

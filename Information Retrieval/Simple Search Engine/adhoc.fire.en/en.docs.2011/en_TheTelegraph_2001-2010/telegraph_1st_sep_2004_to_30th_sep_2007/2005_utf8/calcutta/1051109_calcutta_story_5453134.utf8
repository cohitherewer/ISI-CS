The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buddha frowns, cadre scot-free

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday made no secret of his displeasure over the massive traffic snarl engineered by the CPM michhil on Monday afternoon. 

 At least 50 people missed their flights on Monday evening because of the roadblock by CPM cadre on VIP Road. 

 Asked on Tuesday morning if he was aware that so many people had missed their flights on account of the CPM protests against US participation in joint exercises with the Indian Air Force in Kalaikunda, Bhattacharjee said at Writers? Buildings: ?Yes, I saw it in the papers.?

 A grim-faced Bhattacharjee added: ?The protesters should have been aware of where they were disrupting the traffic.? He was referring to the twin processions through VIP Road, that converged in front of the airport hotel.

 But there are no chances of the government taking action to prevent such incidents in the future. Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb dismissed talk of punitive measures saying: ?It is too insignificant an incident. Besides, how can we initiate action when we haven?t received any complaints from the public?? 

 He refused to elaborate on what the government would do if anyone did lodge a complaint.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy, however, said people who had missed their flights could approach the state human rights commission, stating that the government did not do enough to ensure that they could make it to the airport on time.

 He added: ?There is little the government can do now. Those who disrupted the traffic have long dispersed and it is not possible to track them down and take action.?

 Acting deputy commissioner (traffic) Rajesh Subarno echoed the nothing-can-be-done line. ?Though I have not received any complaints, the traffic police cannot take post facto action. We cannot do anything after the commuter has missed his flight or train. However, if someone calls to say he is stuck somewhere in a jam, we can send traffic police personnel to locate him and help him out.? 

 But try telling that to those stalled on way to the airport or home on Monday evening.

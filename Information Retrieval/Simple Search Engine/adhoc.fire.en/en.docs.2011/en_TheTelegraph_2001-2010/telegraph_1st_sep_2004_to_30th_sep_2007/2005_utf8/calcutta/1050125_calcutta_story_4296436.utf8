 From an egg-seller on the sets to a spotboy to a camera attendant to the country?s most-sought-after cinematographer, ASHOK MEHTA has come miles. The man who looked through the lens for films like 36 Chowringhee Lane, Paroma, Trikaal and Bandit Queen talks to Pratim D. Gupta about his new film Kisna and the changing face of the Indian cameraman.

 You are back working with Subhash Ghai after 

quite a few years. What was the making of Kisna like?

 I have always enjoyed working with him. Yes, there has been a long gap between now and the last time I worked with him. Kisna did provide quite a challenge for me and I took it up. And yes, I have done my bit.

 This is the first time Ghai is attempting 

a period film. Was his approach different from his Ram Lakhan and Khalnayak 

days?

 Yes, we both tried to do something different this time. A period film obviously does have a different look to it. And I am very happy with the way it has come out; I would say I am 99 per cent happy. The canvas, if not very large, is quite big. I did my regular homework and just went on the sets and worked with whatever came into my head. The film has a warm look to it and also a cold look at places.

 You have been very selective in 

your work, often doing just one film a year. Why?

 That is the schooling I have always followed. It is always good to do one film at a time. Then you can concentrate both mentally and physically. Yes, sometimes some films get delayed but that is not in your hands.

 And on what basis do you select 

your films?

 The maker has to be good. That?s important. Then the subject also has to be interesting. Then there is the selfish interest that the project has to work for me. Also, the relationship with the industry people has a lot to do with what film I do. When you know that a certain person is committed to his work, then you are always willing to work with him or her.

 You directed your own film in the 

middle, Moksha. How difficult is it to limit yourself to just being a cameraman?

 My involvement with a project has always been there. Yes, when you direct a film, you become responsible for other departments also and the overall responsibility increases. But even as a cameraman I have always chipped in with my suggestions. Sometimes they have been taken by the director, sometimes they haven?t been. You have to be open about it. You shouldn?t impose ideas.

 These days, cameramen are far more 

in the limelight. How have things changed?

 The quality of work has definitely improved a lot. We have to form a habit to do good work and then carry on that trend. The media, too, have contributed to us coming into the forefront. The exposure is much more now. Also, if someone keeps doing good work, that?s bound to be noticed.

 As for me, I have always got a lot of respect, especially from the Bengalis when I did 36 Chowringhee Lane, Paroma and Sati. It?s obviously different from the way stars are respected. They are in a separate league. Even newcomers get a different treatment altogether. But God has been kind to me. I have always found favour, whether mainstream or offbeat, my own film or others?.

 After Bandit Queen became 

such a rage and Shekhar Kapur set off westward, you could have ventured there 

too. What stopped you?

 Even after 36 Chowringhee Lane, when Aparna went to America with her film, I got a lot of offers. But they all wanted me to stay there and then only could the projects materialise. There was a certain risk involved. It would have been like me doing a foreign film just for name?s sake. It might have been a B-class or C-class film. After Bandit Queen too, Shekhar asked me to go to Hollywood and contact his agent. But a good Indian film is always better than a bad foreign film. Here, I was doing very well and getting a lot of respect. Why should I go there? Then again, I could have probably gone after 36? and struggled my way up there. But after Bandit Queen, the question didn?t arise.

 How do you see the current status 

of Indian cinema?

 I would say it?s tougher than foreign cinema. Foreign cinema can do with just content. Indian cinema needs both content and glamour. Even our offbeat cinema cannot be ugly. There is not a digestible shadow here. Then again, the budget doesn?t support the vision. But there is a successful mainstream chain of films and I am happy to have changed its colour.

 Why have you stopped working with 

Aparna Sen and Shyam Benegal?

 They come to me at the last moment. I have a lot of respect for both Aparna and Shyambabu but they would come and say, I?m starting my film in one month?s time. By then I have already given those dates to someone else and it?s not possible to change them. I would love to work with them again.

 What projects do you have in hand 

at the moment?

 I have committed to two films by Raj Kumar Santoshi. One is, of course, Family starring Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar. The other?s not decided yet.

 And what?s next from Ashok Mehta 

the director?

 I have a couple of ideas I have been mulling for all these years. If everything works out fine, I may start my next film by November-December.

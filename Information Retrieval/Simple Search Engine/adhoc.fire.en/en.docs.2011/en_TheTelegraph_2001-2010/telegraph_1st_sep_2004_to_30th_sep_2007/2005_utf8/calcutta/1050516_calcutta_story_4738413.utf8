The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The windows in many state buses are creaky and stuck. Some are half-open, while others can?t be opened at all, adding to the discomfort that passengers face in a crowded bus in such hot and humid weather. The authorities should repair them immediately. Also, the bus body should be designed in accordance with the demands of Indian climatic conditions.

 A few weeks ago, there was a ruckus over the felling of five trees in AE block of Salt Lake. On the evening of April 14, a huge aakashmoni tree in the block was chopped off and all the wood taken away. What remains is just the stump. Whatever be the reason behind the act, I am sure just a trim would have sufficed.

 Recently, when I was returning to Calcutta from Sitarampur by the Black Diamond Express (Down train), I found that gunny bags filled with coal had been stacked under most of the seats. Even the toilets and the space between rows of seats was blocked by these sacks. When the train was approaching Seoraphuli station, a group of men and women piled all the sacks near the doorway. Mysteriously, the train pulled to a halt just before entering the station and all of them unloaded the bags and got off. The train left for Howrah with lots of coal dust, dirty seats and floors and inconvenienced passengers. Regular commuters on the route said this was a routine practice. As expected, the train reached Howrah late. Are the railway authorities aware of these series of events and their frequency?

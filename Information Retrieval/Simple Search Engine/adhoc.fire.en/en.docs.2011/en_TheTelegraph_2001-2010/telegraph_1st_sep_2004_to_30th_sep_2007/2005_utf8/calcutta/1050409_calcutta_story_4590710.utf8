 Taxi in hurry kills old man 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Reckless driving claimed yet another pedestrian and critically injured a woman at the Ekdalia crossing on Friday morning. 

 This is the 11th death in the city due to rash driving this month.

 A speeding taxi knocked down 75-year-old Muktinath Shastri and the woman, in her mid-50s, at the Rashbehari Avenue?Ekdalia Road intersection around 9.30 am.

 Local residents rushed both to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan, where the aged man succumbed to his injuries. 

 The condition of the woman was stated to be critical.

 The driver of the killer taxi fled, leaving his vehicle behind, which was impounded by Gariahat police. 

 Immediately after the incident, hundreds of local people rushed to the spot and squatted on the road, obstructing vehicular traffic for over half-an-hour. They demanded immediate arrest of the rogue driver.

 Only after senior police officials reached the spot and held out an assurance that that the vigil on reckless driving would be stepped up did they relent.

 According to police, Shastri was trying to cross the road when the taxi, plying at an unusually high speed, hit him from behind.

 ?The driver had lost control and drove his vehicle straight on to the pavement and hit the two pedestrians. The injured woman is yet to be identified,? said an officer of Gariahat police station.

 ?Witnesses said Shastri lost consciousness on the spot,? according to Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 ?On seeing Shastri lying on the road and a crowd gathering at the spot, the driver realised that the situation might get out of hand. So he left his vehicle and fled,? said an officer of traffic department. ?We have the taxi and its registration number, so he will be tracked down,? the officer added.

 The death toll on account of rash driving and road accidents this year is hovering around the 150 mark. 

 In January itself, the figure was 55, which according to Calcutta Police is an all-time record. The count was above 40 in February and March each.

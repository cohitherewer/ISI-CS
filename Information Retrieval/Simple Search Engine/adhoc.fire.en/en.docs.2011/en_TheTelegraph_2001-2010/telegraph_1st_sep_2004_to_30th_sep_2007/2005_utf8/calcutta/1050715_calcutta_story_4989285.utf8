 Death of an idealist

 The trials of time and the lessons learnt from experience can change human ideals and values completely. Written by Chandan Sen, E Parabase traces the ideological transformation of Samit, a former revolutionary, over a period of three decades. Having witnessed the turmoil and turbulence of the Seventies in his youth, and the paradoxical twists and turns of succeeding eras during the 30 years of his self-exile in Germany, Samit is initially confused. Gradually, however, the inevitability of changes in human attitude dawns upon him. He realises that as society goes through the uncertainties brought about by globalization and liberalization, people must necessarily adapt themselves to these changes, concealing their true selves behind masks that express acceptance of the new system. Viewed from various conflicting perspectives, the play depicts hope and despair walking hand in hand. At the same time, it re-lives memories and incidents of the past and tries to attune them to the demands of the future. Directed by Sarbadaman Som.

 Morning after night in or out

Paradoxically, the first day of the year is never as exciting as the last night of one. But even if you?re groggy or grumpy, and fed up with the messages clogging your inbox, we do wish you Happy New Year.

 While you are still hung over (from sleep or from too much of some good thing last night), read on about how your fellow revellers (or rivals) feel on the first day of 2005.

 The cause could range from the indoors to the outdoors, and the effect could be as varied as smile or scowl.

 But here are some pet theories about how the Calcuttan is waking up to January 1, 2005.

 Telly tied

 What?s the logic behind watching the same ol? stuff on 31st night (okay, it is getting more glamorous by the year, but that?s about it)?

 Possibility number one: the couch potato believes in conserving energy for the first day of the new year, unlike the party animal who believes in dancing and drinking the last night of the year away.

 Possibility number two: the small-screen solitaire has no one else to be out with.

 Possibility number three: watching (and cribbing about) the fare on TV with family or like-minded (lazy?) friends is what really makes their night.

 While friends scoff at this lot, they end up scoring more brownie points with their family than the brownies you gorged at that New Year treat. These are the guys likely to pack kids into a hamper and head for a picnic today while you are still trying to find your feet (or slippers)!

 Resolute resolution: ?Need to get a more comfortable 

couch this year.?

 Repartee: ?And I shall fry more potatoes for 

you, my dear.?

Travelling right

 Those who trade the midnight champagne for a Christmas holiday out of town sure know how to celebrate in style!

 The smart set is likely to come back to civilisation with more fizz than that bubbly you uncorked. So the next time you get a choice between those air tickets and a free entry to that snazzy party in town, you know what to do.

 Resolute resolution: ?Will do the same for 

Pujas as well.?

 Repartee: ?Why try and run, when you?re back 

at the starting line every time??

 House harried

 Among folks blessed with a pleasant pad plus terrace, only the die-hard would have ventured out last night to be packed like sardines in a haunt hawking New Year cheer. Many of those who preferred to party at their friend?s place aren?t likely to wake up in their own bed. The sense of security at a house party, after all, encourages quite a few blokes to overdo it. Drive back? What drive? Where back?

 Resolute resolution (of host): ?Will have to 

change my address before the year runs out.?

 Repartee: ?But you?ll call us for the house 

warming, won?t you??

 Disco drill

 Last night was the longest night on the calendar for the swing set and today the shortest day. They might have been fun to be with last night but it is sage advice to steer clear of their company today. Chances are, they are as grumpy today as they were glad yesterday.

 Resolute resolution: ?Promise to call it a 

day latest by 4 in the morning next time. The sun is a killer.?

 Repartee: ?Think of a new line in the New Year, 

man.?

 Shun fun

 Ironically, the brightest face is likely to be presented by those who shunned revelry in the wake of the grim finale to 2004. It?s thoughtfulness like this ? early to bed, early to rise and steer clear of what they call vice ? that mirrors the hope of a better tomorrow.

 Resolute resolution: ?What?s a little sacrifice 

for a cause??

 Repartee: ?Chill, dude.?

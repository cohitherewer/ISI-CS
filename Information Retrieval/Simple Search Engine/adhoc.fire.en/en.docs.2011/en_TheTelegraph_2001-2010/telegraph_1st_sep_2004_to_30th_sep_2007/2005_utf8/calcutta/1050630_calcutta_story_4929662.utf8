The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Twin-state thrust to tourism

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Gujarat and West Bengal, which boast the largest count of travel-lovers in India, have inked a memorandum of understanding to promote tourism. 

 While the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Ltd (TCGL) marketed the state at a travel and tour operators? meet in Calcutta on June 18, the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC) plans to hold an identical showcase in Ahmedabad on July 28.

 Souren Bhattacharya, managing director, WBTDC, said: ?For the first time, Gujarat and West Bengal are promoting their destinations and heritage sites on a one-to-one basis. Earlier, we only did promotions at trade fairs held in other states.? 

 While the TCGL aggressively marketed the Navaratri extravaganza (October 4-12) ? ?the longest dance festival in the world? ? to travel and tour operators in Bengal, the WBTDC intends to lure Gujarati tourists with Durga puja celebrations.

 ?A huge number of Bengali tourists travel to Gujarat, and vice versa, every year,? pointed out C.V. Som, managing director, TCGL.

 The organisation also marketed the Tarnetar fair, a tribal event, and the international kite festival (Uttarayan), during which enthusiasts from all over the world pour into the state.

 Majestic Tour of Gujarat, a six-day package by TCGL, covering places of religious interest like Dwarka and Somnath, the beaches like Mandvi and Madhavpur, the Gir forest and forts like the Gondal palace, has drawn an enthusiastic response from Bengalis.

 ?More than 250 operators attended the June 18 tourism mela in Calcutta. We have also opened three offices in the city,? added Som.

 The WBTDC, on its part, will focus on Durga puja, the Sunderbans, and the hilly regions. Package tours will also be on offer. Officials of the corporation are currently in Gujarat, deciding on a venue for the July 28 meet and fine-tuning plans.

 Managing director Bhattacharya said: ?We will offer special discounts to operators who arrange tours for schoolchildren. Students comprise a huge potential market.?

 He added: ?We plan to hold similar boost-tourism shows in Mumbai and Chennai, but not in the near future.? The TCGL, however, is holding such meets in other cities as well.

 ?As far as memorandums of understanding for promoting inter-state packages are concerned, we have only signed a pact with West Bengal. We plan to approach other states later,? said Som.

 Guinea EmporiuM held its annual lucky draw competition on Saturday.

 Abha Dutt from B.T. Road, Shyamal Mitra from Howrah, Manju Ghosh from Howrah, Gita Biswas from AJC Bose Road and Sukhdev Bag from Strand Road were the lucky winners, each receiving a camera from actress Arunima Ghosh.

 We have been conducting the lucky draw for the past three years. It isnt the prize that matters, but the remembrance. Its also a great customer relations build-up, explained Bablu Dey, owner of the Bowbazar store.

 The lucky draw coupons are sent to almost 7,000 customers ? who made purchases of at least Rs 5,000 from the jeweller.

 Hindi hits

 Saturday night at Prince of Cal, the nightclub at Souravs: The Food Pavilion, saw a virus of a different kind going around.

 The Park Street lounge started off rocking to the pulsating beats of DJ Amit, the in-house music maker, who was later joined by DJ Sheizwood of Mumbai and exotic dancer Shifa.

 Sheizwood recently shot to fame with his remix album Virus, which had foot-stomping numbers like Mera piya gaye rangoon. He took over the console and churned out chart-topping tracks like Bin tere sanam, Woh lamhe and Dus bahane, which got the crowd on its feet.

 DJ Sheizwood has been topping the charts everywhere with his album Virus, and Shifa is the model-dancer who appeared in the video for Mera piya gaye rangoon, explained a spokesperson for the night spot.

 Music masti

 If partying is your style, rum your elixir and city nightclubs your haunt, Tantra was the place to be on Saturday. DJ A-myth from Mumbai was spinning his stuff at the console of the nightclub at The Park, and the crowd was going ballistic with every scratch and rub he made on the turntable.

 Other than the usual Bollywood tracks, the crowd got to hear some hardcore house, trance, hip-hop and experimental music.

 The DJ strutted his attitude and his music, sharing the turntable with in-house DJs Sammy, Oblix and Vishal, mixing up an infectious mood.

 With the dance floor packed and the crowd grooving to the hypnotic beats, the party continued till the wee hours of the morning. 

 DJ A-myth has played at various venues and has a reputation for making every party or nightclub come alive with his tunes, offered a Tantra spokesperson.

 All?s well that ends well

 In an age ruled by materialistic pursuits, we have all but forgotten to partake of the simple pleasures of life. The sheer ecstasy of falling in love or the excitement of a blossoming romance are experiences far removed from our humdrum lives. Providing welcome succour to hearts parched of all emotions is Rang-Roop?s latest production, Shesh Raksha. One of Tagore?s most popular romantic comedies, the play captivates the hearts of the audience through its frank representation of human sensibilities and passions. Combined with a well-structured plot and vivid characterisations, and, above all, Tagore?s refined, sophisticated dialogues, seasoned with racy wit and intelligent humour, the play attains heights of dramatic excellence. Shesh Raksha introduces us to four young people ? Indumati, Gadai, Kamalmukhi and Binod ? whose uncertain, oscillating romantic fortunes we follow with anxious excitement during the course of the play. Edited by Mohit Chatterjee; directed by Seema Mukherjee.

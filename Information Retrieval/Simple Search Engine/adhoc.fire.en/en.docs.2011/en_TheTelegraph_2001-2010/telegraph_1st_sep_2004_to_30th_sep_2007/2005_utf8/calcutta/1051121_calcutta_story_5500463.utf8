The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The bus stops at the Park Street-JL Nehru Road intersection are extremely hazardous. 

Private buses, especially those moving southwards, stop just about anywhere, leading 

to a chaotic situation, with commuters scampering back and forth to catch the 

bus. It will be a great help if proper signboards are put up along the stretch, 

demarcating the spots where buses on various routes can halt.

 The underground railway in Calcutta is hardly immune to potential terrorist 

attacks. The metal detectors are a farce and the passengers are never stopped 

and frisked even if the gadgets beep loud and clear. Also, at most stations, security 

personnel are nowhere to be seen near the gates. It has been seen how a series 

of blasts in a faraway land led to a security overdrive at the stations. And it 

is also well-known how long it took for laziness to get the better of good sense.

 It is next to impossible to walk on the sidewalk along the park near Rashbehari 

Avenue gurdwara. Mounds of garbage and makeshift-dwellers occupy most of the stretch. 

There is hardly any space left on the pavement for pedestrians.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Swede sound

 The first hint of winter and the musicians are here. If Frenchman J.J. Milteau enthralled Calcuttans with his brand of blues on the harmonica on Tuesday, Swedish bass exponent Jonas Hellborg (in picture by Amit Datta) has touched down for an evening of jazz the day after.

 Hellborg is no stranger to the city, having played as recently as last January with Steve Topping and Gary Husband. This is my fourth trip to Calcutta and its nice to be back, says the 47-year-old.

 The Jonas Hellborg Group takes the stage at Taj Bengal on Wednesday evening. Hellborg is performing with a new line-up on his eight-city India tour. Calcutta is the second stop after Mumbai.

 The band comprises, besides Hellborg on bass, fellow Swedes Mattias IA Eklundh on guitar and Niclas Campagnol on drums.

 I met Mattias a year ago when we were playing the same show in Stockholm. We have been jamming together since then but its the first time were on a tour. Niclas is just a few weeks old in Team Hellborg, but hes the best drummer in Scandinavia.

 Hellborg is particularly excited about Mattias. Ive played with John McLaughlin and Shawn Lane. After Shawn died, I thought there wouldnt be another guitarist I could play with. But Mattias changed that? He also took out time to learn my music.

 On Wednesday, the trio would be performing music from Hellborgs back catalogue as well as a lot of new music. Wed also be featuring tracks from an upcoming album called Kalis Son, where Ive collaborated with sitarist Niladri Kumar and percussionist Selvaganesh.

 The bassist has matched notes with Indian musicians earlier, too, and tries to track the music scene as closely as he can. Jazz has changed generations here. After the likes of Louiz Banks and Carl Peters, new kids are coming in now.

 Hellborg plans to stay on in India for the next few months and even return to Calcutta next January. A European tour is scheduled after that.

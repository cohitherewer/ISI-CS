 Rod assault by drunks kills friend

 - Youths on extortion binge leave man injured

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 35-year-old man was beaten to death by his drunken friends in Regent Park early on Tuesday. 

 A few hours later, two youths from Barabagan bustee, also under the influence of alcohol, went on an extortion spree, injuring one person.

 It was past midnight when an altercation broke out among Bapi Maiti and his friends, while they were drinking in a bylane off KP Roy Lane. 

 The argument turned into a brawl and soon, all of them were beating up each other. 

 Local residents watched in horror as the drunks singled out Maiti after some time and started beating him up with iron rods. Within minutes, he sunk to the floor and was left on the roadside.

 The witnesses rushed Maiti to MR Bangur Hospital, where he was declared ?brought dead?. 

 In the other incident, the two drunk youths raided a couple of shops in south Calcutta with improvised firearms on Tuesday, injuring one person.

 ?Sheikh Afsar, alias Disco, aged around 25, was held by officers of Charu Market police station as he was fleeing after accidentally shooting a man,? said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Ranvir Kumar. 

 He added: ?Afsar and his accomplice Doda had raided two shops on Prince Anwar Shah Road and Deshapran Sashmal Road on Tuesday afternoon. They first went to a vehicle spares shop and looted Rs 2,000 and an employee?s mobile phone.

 ?The second loot attempt, on Deshapran Sashmal Road, proved to be their undoing. When the owner of the shop refused to comply with their demands, they tried to scare him by firing a round each in the air. One bullet was lodged in the ceiling, but the second grazed the forehead of the 32-year-old employee, Narayan Purakait.?

 The residents of the area had alerted the police station by then. When the two tried to flee, the cops chased them. They managed to catch Afsar, but Doda fled.

 ?They merely wanted to scare the shopkeeper and his helpers. Unfortunately, the second shot hit Narain Purakait on the forehead. That was enough to scare Afsar and Doda. They immediately tried to flee the spot,? deputy commissioner Kumar said.

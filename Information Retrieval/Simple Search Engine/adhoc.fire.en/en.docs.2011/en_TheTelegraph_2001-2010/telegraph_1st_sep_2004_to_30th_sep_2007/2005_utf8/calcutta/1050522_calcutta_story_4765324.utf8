The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cash ?n? carry Calcuttan

 Running shoes for nearly Rs 9,000; shades for Rs 23,000...

 To flash your cash ain?t as easy as it used to be. With international players jostling for space on city shelves, the price tag is soaring up, up and away from your average stylebhai. But here?s the good news: smaller status symbols are just a greedy grab away, even if your pocket protests.

 If you want to be the most hip kid on the consumer block, browse through some of the priciest picks in the crowded accessories marketplace. These may not be the most expensive, but they are high on both price and popularity.

 These tell you why there is madness at the malls and a retail revolution running through town. These tell you about a generation for whom shopping is a way of life, purse power is paramount and earning is just a means to spending.

 Here?s looking at the Calcutta consumer packing it in and carrying it off...

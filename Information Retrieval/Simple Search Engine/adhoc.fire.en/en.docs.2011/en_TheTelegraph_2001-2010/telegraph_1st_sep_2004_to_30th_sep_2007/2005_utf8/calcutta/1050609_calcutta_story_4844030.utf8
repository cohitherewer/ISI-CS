 Cabbies come to blows over LPG

 - Clean-fuel meeting at Writers? on taxi engine conversion ends in flare-up and fiasco

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A meeting on converting taxis to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at Writers? Buildings ended in chaos on Wednesday afternoon, with members of rival taxi associations nearly coming to blows and walking out after officers asked them to leave.

 A majority of taximen, under the umbrella of Joint Action Committee of taxi association and taxi driver?s unions, walked out of Rotunda, where the meeting had been convened by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. 

 Trouble started brewing as Bimal Guha, former general secretary of Bengal Taxi Association, rose to speak. Most taxi operators stood up to demand that he sit down, since he didn?t represent Bengal Taxi Association any more. 

 With transporters nearly coming to blows, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury banged the table and asked the trouble-makers to leave the venue if they couldn?t behave themselves. According to Chowdhury, some transporters boycotted the meeting after members of two factions of Bengal Taxi Association started fighting among themselves.

 ?We?ll soon hold another meeting with banks to finalise loan packages to finance LPG kits for taxis,? Chowdhury said.

 Minister Chakraborty has decided to meet all transport unions individually and convince them to switch over to green fuel and meet his government?s commitment on reducing pollution in Calcutta.

 An earlier meeting on Wednesday morning with autorickshaw unions on the same issue concluded successfully, with the majority of Citu-affiliated unions agreeing to the government?s order on phasing out autorickshaws manufactured before 1990.

 Chakraborty assured taxi operators that he would rope in banks to finance ?easy packages? for LPG kits.

 Joint Action Committee convener Subhash Kaushik, however, said the major taxi associations would not attend any further meetings on LPG conversion until their old grievances were sorted out. These relate to non-renewal of permits for old vehicles, health screening of drivers over 50 for renewing licences and slow distribution of smart cards. 

 ?The Public Vehicles Directorate is not accepting tax for old vehicles. They are not renewing permits, citing non-payment of tax. We want to bring these problems to the minister?s notice, but he is not giving us a hearing,? said Kaushik. 

 Taximen requested the minister to allow them to procure second-hand petrol engines, instead of insisting on original engines from Hindustan Motors at Rs 1.25 lakh, for engine replacement and fitting of an LPG kit.

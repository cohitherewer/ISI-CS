The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Faye Dunaway 

You have the right mix of dreams and organisational skills. Your persistent idealism is the secret of your charm. With an initial push, you can reach any height. You have a strong intuition and know when to stop. Time spent outdoors is a great way to recharge. You can keep your cool on the worst of days. ? Kusum Bhandari

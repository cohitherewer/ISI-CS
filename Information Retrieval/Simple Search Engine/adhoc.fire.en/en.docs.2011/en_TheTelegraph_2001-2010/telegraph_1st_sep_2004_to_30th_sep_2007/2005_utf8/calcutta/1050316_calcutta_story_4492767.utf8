 Three days of unlimited fun and total entertainment ? that?s just one of the ways to describe the three-day Jaiprakash Sananda Carnival that kicked off at Nalban Boating Complex on March 11. A first-time effort by the region?s leading lifestyle magazine for women, the gala co-sponsored by Sun-kwik gave not just women of the city, but their families a chance to celebrate over an entire weekend. 

 Packed with celebrity stage shows, great food and fun games, crowds spent hours soaking in the non-stop hungama next to Nicco Park. 

Day one

 The distant sound of dhamsa (tribal drums) lured visitors from afar post-4 pm on a windswept Friday evening. The first glimpse of the carnival was a group of colourfully-dressed Santhal women swaying to the drum beats while Sananda editor Aparna Sen and daughter Konkona showed keen interest in their dance steps and their silver jewellery.

 A request to Konkona by the tribal women to join in the dance was returned with a smile, a shake of the head, and ?I can?t dance like you.?

 A formal inauguration of the event later, the celebrity duo moved on to look around the stalls, even picking up a few pieces from Anjali Jewellers. 

 At another end of the sprawling venue, Cactus lead vocalist Siddhartha and singer Paroma held an impromptu talent hunt among members of the audience, inviting singers ? bathroom and beyond ? to try their luck with the mike.

 The mehndi, hair braiding and hair-streaking stalls were just beginning to get curious visitors, while the Anjali Jewellers stall was packed to capacity with women jostling to catch a glimpse of the ornaments. 

Day two

 The morning was packed with workshops ? from candle making to Ikebana, cookery to jewellery. And the response was overwhelming.

 Armed with note pads, enthusiastic women queued up with questions of various kinds for the experts. From arranging flowers under a shamiana in the open fields to slipping into a small tent (Teens Corner) and learning ways to make crystal candles, the day was action packed.

 The trend followed into the evening as singer Shilajeet and Bangla band Cactus rocked a 500-strong audience, from age six to 60. 

Day three

 The best was, indeed, saved for last. With crowds pouring in from the time the gates of the boating complex opened, by evening even the vast venue looked cramped with revellers.

 A celebrity antakshari opened the cultural activities of the evening. Moderated by Paroma, the participants ? actors Tota Roychowdhury, Pallavi Chatterjee, Rajatabha, Rimjhim, Indrani Dutta and singer Anindyo of Chandrabindoo fame ? locked horns through several rounds.

 Tota had the loudest fan following with young girls from the crowd prompting him lyrics and tunes. ?We can?t let Totada lose,? they screamed.

 After the competition, it was a mad rush for autograph seekers who fought back security lathis to reach out to their favourite stars. ?Totada amader ashte bolechhe (Tota has asked us to come),? insisted a bunch of girls trying to convince security personnel to allow them backstage.

 Star shower at the start of the show gave way to more star power as actresses Locket Chatterjee, Monami and Swastika Mukherjee took to the ramp with city models (Tanushree, Pooja, Ishika, Neeraj and others) to showcase creations by Anjali Jewellers. 

 Fashion made way for fusion music as A Class Apart featuring Pandit Shantanu Bandopadhyay and Neel Adhikari mixed Indian classical ragas with western songs. ?Our fusion lies in melody and the harmony of the two forms as we believe that all music is the same,? said Neel. 

 Post-10 pm, the final blast of the closing ceremony came with fireworks that lit up the night sky, waking up a sleepy Salt Lake.

 Learning to live

 Tagore wrote his immensely popular play Tasher Desh as a polemical piece against any form of suppression, regulation or rigid regimentation, often carried out in the name of preserving tradition, heritage and discipline. Natyams adaptation of the Tagore classic as a prose-play attempts to go beyond the original tenets by speaking out for the dynamism of human life, the growth of the soul through expression of the self, and in defiance against any form of oppression, subjugation and the curbing of ones individual rights. It depicts how life is breathed into those who lived in the land of cards by the adventurous prince, who inspires them with his infectious energy, vigour and enthusiasm. Invested with great socio-political relevance during the time when it was written, the play assumes fresh significance in the present day, when overt and covert forms of control threaten to stifle human life socially, economically, politically and culturally. Direction: Abhijit Sen.

 We Ask You Answer

 Ode to art or paean to piety

 Today?s question: Are we reducing Durga puja to mere gimmickry with unconventional idols and themes?

 Object of reverence? The idols in a Dum Dum puja

Dipro roy,

Beniapukur Lane 

The unconventional idols and themes have not put the 

tradition and solemnity of Durga puja under threat. They have only enhanced the 

appeal of the Puja. 

T.R. Anand, 

Budge Budge 

The variety in idols and themes is most welcome. Youngsters, 

especially, have started to enjoy the Puja more. The organisers should not go 

overboard, though.

Sayan Basu, 

Raja Rammohan Roy Road, 

The Durga puja should be renamed theme puja. Every 

puja committee wants to bask in the limelight and win awards. The sponsors are 

to blame for this.

Amrita Awasthi,

Baguiati 

Durga puja is not getting reduced to gimmickry. Unconventional 

idols and themes are needed to inform people of the rich artistic heritage of 

the country.

Indranil Sanyal, 

Dhakuria 

The introduction of new themes and idols has made 

the Puja more colourful and attractive. Every year, millions are drawn to pandal 

by innovative themes.

Chameli Pal,

Batanagar 

When was Durga puja anything more than gimmickry? 

All along, the Puja was a tool of the nouveaux riches to flaunt their wealth, 

often ill-gotten. Wasn?t it gimmickry to shift the Puja from spring to autumn? 

The event is popular only because it allows people to have fun without spending 

money. 

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,

CIT Road 

Unconventional idols and themes have made Durga puja 

more grand by adding an artistic dimension to it. Experimentation is most welcome 

as long as the puja is conducted with reverence. 

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

Shibpur 

Disregard for tradition has reduced Durga puja to 

a travesty. It is sad that most organisers are competing to come up with the most 

ludicrous theme and idol. This is continuing as the general public has very poor 

aesthetic sense. The government too is reluctant to interfere. 

Govind Das Dujari, 

Diamond Harbour Road 

Since Durga puja is a religious occasion, I fail to 

see the need to create idols that are works of art? If the devotees start to evaluate 

the artistic aspects of the idol instead of worshipping her, the purpose of the 

puja is lost.

Tuhin Purkayastha,

Parnashree 

The themes are taking a toll on the Puja spirit. Old 

is certainly gold as far as Durga puja is concerned. 

Rajib Dey,

Habra 

Unconventional idols and themes will make the pujas 

more artistic but will make the occasion less spiritual. 

Sohini Roy,

Sarat Chatterjee Avenue 

Only a handful of pujas have retained their charm. 

The practice of using unconventional idols and themes should be discontinued.

Margaret Williams,

Address not given 

Durga puja has become something more than a mere festival 

and a lot of 21st century elements have become a part of it. It is now a competition 

among puja organisers with all participants aiming to reach the top, but not a 

divine high. 

Joydeep Chatterjee,

Shyambazar 

We are reducing Durga puja to mere gimmickry with 

unconventional idols and themes. We should stick to tradition.

Subho Bhattacharya,

Address not given 

Sponsors and awards point to the fact that Puja has 

turned commercial. The organisers are ready to do anything to attract the media 

as they know that the sponsors would follow. The awards would come soon after.

Prahlad Agarwala,

Majdia, Nadia 

Big Puja organisers are bent on portraying outward 

grandeur at the cost of devotion. But the latter is the essence of the puja. 

Atif Ayaz,

Serampore 

The theme pujas have provided artists with a valuable 

platform to showcase their skills.

Sandip Banerjee,

Harish Mukherjee Road 

Yes. The money spent on unconventional pandals and 

idols should be donated to the underprivileged.

B.K. Choudhary,

Kankinara 

Piety has taken the backseat in this age of unconventional 

idols and pandals. Decorations should not distract the devotees.

Sarit Datta,

Gopal Ghosh Lane 

Choice of tradition over innovation betrays mental 

inertia. The image of the goddess has evolved over the years. Theme pujas have 

had a liberalising influence.

Kanai Saha,

Gauri Bari Lane 

The craze for prizes has adversely affected Puja milieu. 

If the trend of making unconventional idols and pandals cannot be arrested, Durga 

puja will soon morph from a religious festival to a social and cultural one.

Shikha Kotecha,

Howrah 

Competition shapes all aspects of our lives, including 

the nature of the Puja. Unconventional idols and pandals are products of much 

toil and creative intelligence. They should not be dismissed as gimmickry.

Kalyan Ghosh,

Park Street 

Showmanship and gimmickry has taken over Durga puja. 

There is a definite need to go back to the roots. 

A.K. Mitra,

Padda Pukur Road 

Hats off to the organisers who are refusing to be 

stereotyped and allowing artisans to put their imaginations to good use.

Kaberi Mukherjee,

Santosh Roy Road 

We are sick of unconventional idols. Thanks to them, 

the future generations might not know that goddess Durga has 10 hands and four 

children.

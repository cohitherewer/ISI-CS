 Traffic in large parts of south Calcutta came to a halt for over three hours on Tuesday as nearly 4,000 settlers along the railway tracks between Ballygunge and Tollygunge stations took out a march to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Palm Avenue residence. 

 They were protesting Eastern Railway?s drive to evict them by March 2. 

 As the marchers, with satchel-carrying schoolchildren and women in the front, reached Gariahat, a large police contingent prevented them from proceeding further towards Ballygunge Phari, a five-minute walk from the chief minister?s residence. 

 The processionists then squatted on Rashbehari Avenue, demanding they be allowed to go to their destination.

 As a result, traffic on Rashbehari Avenue and Gariahat Road (South) was thrown out of gear for over three hours. 

 Office-goers and commuters were stranded at the Gol Park crossing. Some of them had to walk to reach the Park Circus junction.

 Police, however, remained silent spectators for over three hours, even as the squatters continued their protest, blocking the main thoroughfare from 1 pm. They dispersed on their own after 4 pm, with the local MLA announcing that a memorandum will be sent to the chief minister at Writers? Buildings.

 The procession was organised following a notification issued by Eastern Railway, on the basis of an order from Calcutta High Court. The notification asked the squatters along the Ballygunge-Tollygunge rail stations to vacate the area by March 1. Those who failed to do so would face eviction from March 2. 

 The eviction is to be jointly conducted by the railway, state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 According to the notification, those who will leave the area on their own between February 15 and March 1 will be awarded a certificate by the railway authorities. The certificates will help the squatters get priority in obtaining substitute land if the state or the Centre decides to provide them with alternative shelter under the Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana in future.

 ?None of the squatters collected the certificate from the office of the station master at Ballygunge station, as they had been asked to in advertisements in leading dailies,? said an Eastern Railway officer.

 Earlier, addressing the gathering, local MLA Saugata Roy said no member of the squatters? body would collect the certificates. ?The certificates will not help the squatters obtain shelter,? he added. 

 Roy, also president of the squatters? body, warned that any attempt to evict the settlers along the railway tracks would be opposed. 

 He announced that they will organise a ?human chain? on February 26 as part of their agitation. ?We shall go for a more intensive movement to pressure the government to provide alternative accommodation to the settlers before the proposed eviction,? he added.

 Its one of those things that most women feel awkward about ? choosing ones bra under the hawk-eyed supervision of the man behind the counter. So, those who can, prefer to wait for a fresh consignment from friends or family living abroad, while others just dart into a shopping mall, try on what they find and more often than not end up spending a fortune on the wrong fit.

 Necessity, the lingerie boutique at 9 Hindustan Park, stands out with its range of sizes to choose from and professional counselling that is hard to come by.

 Continual use of the wrong fit can leave long-term ill effects on the bust line. A good fit depends on the basic coverage, the quality of fabric and the shoulder strap design, explains Necessity proprietor Swati Gautam, who has developed a loyal clientele of 10 to 70-year-olds over the past 14 years.

 The store stocks a wide range of sizes ? from 26 to 48 inches ? for school kids to college girls, teachers to bankers, home-makers to NRIs, and women from the glamour world.

 At the south Calcutta address, staffers roll out six to seven varieties of bras for a customer to try and pick from, taking her age, weight, bust and waistline into account. While a woman with a heavy bust and a narrow waist will need a bra high on support, those with the opposite will need a bra that can expand, says Swati.

 Her client profile has undergone quite a change over the years. Women are more conscious now. A mother-in-law will drop in with her daughter-in-law and granddaughter, and all three will want to wear something that makes them look good.

 Adding a dash of creativity to its wardrobe, Necessity has come up with a new range of bras for the festive season ahead.

 The no-bounce Aerobics bra has been designed for sportswomen, dancers and gym-goers. Made of a heavy cotton fabric with padded straps and a lace trimming, the contours of this cut are as good as any other bra. The shoulders pull the maximum weight and so the cups are of a single layer. As this is mostly used for perspiration-oriented work, the cotton soaks the sweat and makes one feel comfortable, says Swati. The price tag: Rs 259 to Rs 349. 

 ower power

 The Floral bra, in a range of pastel shades, is for all those looking for something light and comfortable in the sultry summer. The Rubia fabric is complemented with a lace trimming on the neck and one can pick from floral prints in blue, lavender, pink and white. 

 The lace trimming gives immense support and this is ideal for those who have lost a bit of shape and new mothers, explains Swati. The Floral range is priced at Rs 149.

 Red rage

 Aimed at the nightclub crowd, the bright red-and-violet Checks cotton bra has been made cuter with a thick black lace border. The bold and the beautiful can wear it underneath any sort of sheer garment and make a style statement. Those wearing saris can team it with a palette of red and maroon blouses. The high support system of this bra is also the right choice for tees and western outfits. Prices start at Rs 169.

 Shimmer effect

 Though meant for night use, the Starry bra is the sexiest outfit in the Necessity closet. Soft silver or gold threads are woven with black, pink or beige to give the bra a shimmering effect. This is low on support and the price ranges from Rs 149 to Rs 169. Shades available are berry pink and silver, beige and silver, and black and gold.

 The Scallop bra has a square neck, with a lacy upper portion and knitted fabric in the lower half for those willing to show off some cleavage. This is available with transparent straps, which can be worn with an off-shoulder blouse. Primarily meant for smaller women, it comes in 18 to 20 sizes. The price ranges between Rs 149 and Rs 169.

 Chikan and Hakoba bras with broad straps are the fastest-moving items on the racks. This range comes in hues of white, beige and black with coloured embroidery, costing between Rs 189 and Rs 249. Here, the lift is immense and those with a diffused shape find it most convenient, says Swati.

 Nursing need

 Necessity also offers Nursing bras and customised bras for mastectomy patients. A nursing bra has a detachable double cup that makes it ideal for lactating mothers, says Swati. For mastectomy patients, the store provides artificial bras made of light foam, which can be discarded after a year. The price ranges between Rs 350 and Rs 400, depending on the size.

Akkis got a big heart

 Real hero: Akshay Kumar

 Trust Akshay Kumar to be his heroic self off-screen, too. For his recent performance 

at the annual Diwali fundraiser for Trillium Health Centre in Canada, primarily 

aimed at generating funds for cancer patients, Akki did not only forgo his usual 

$1,00,000 fee but also wrote a cheque of $51,000 for the hospital. 

 Projects for the welfare of cancer patients have always been close to Akshays 

heart, since his father died of prostate cancer in 2000. The Khiladi star is not 

only a special Olympic ambassador in India but also a good heart ambassador raising 

awareness about cardiac diseases. And even though the show wasnt Akshays 

idea, he took over its planning and convinced other stars like Lara Dutta, Ruby 

Bhatia and Sukhbir to be part of it. They too didnt charge a paisa.

Star episode

 After Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan, Kajol and Ajay Devgan, Bipasha Basu 

and John Abraham, its time for Tulsi (Smriti Irani) and Parvati (Sakshi 

Tanwar) to play Kaun Banega Crorepati Dwitiya.

 To feature on the Diwali Special episode on October 30 at 9 pm, the two reigning 

queens of the daily K-soaps, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ghar 

Kii, will be joined by their respective family members. The families will play 

for the Fastest Finger First (FFF) while Smriti and Sakshi take a crack at the 

15 questions on the hot seats.

 Tulsis family, the Viranis, will consist of Savita, Gautam, Damini, Sahil 

and Mohini while Parvatis family, the Aggarwals,will comprise Kamal, Shruti, 

Sameer,Vigyat and Gayatri. Ba will be the companion for the two on the hot seats.

 The show opens with Tulsi and Parvati playing for their chosen charities. The 

next hot seat occupant will be selected from members of the Aggarwal and Virani 

families from the FFF. The winner from any one family will have to choose a partner 

from the other family. Once this second pair takes the hot seat, the remaining 

eight will play along for Rs 2 lakh.

Mr Moves

 This is live from the sets of the new Abhishek Bachchan-starrer Bluff Master. 

The choreographer duo Bosco and Caesar, who have been busy making Aishwarya Rai, 

Hrithik Roshan, Ishaa Koppikar and Rani Mukherjee dance to their tunes, were in 

charge of the moves of the Chhota B. 

 During one such shoot when the two had showed a jig to Abhishek and it was 

take time, Bachchan junior went on his own trip and did his own steps. And guess 

what? They turned out to be so good, they have been kept in the film all right. 

So, now you know, you dont even need a choreographer with Abhishek on the 

sets.

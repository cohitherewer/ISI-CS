 B?day bash with designer dials

ZEESHAN JAWED

The 

Gariahat outlet of Titan watches, at 48 Gariahat Road, completes its 10th year 

in town.

 To mark the occasion, a birthday bash was thrown on February 3 at the outlet, with Tollywood actress Nilanjanaa for star company.

 Giving customers more reason to celebrate, Nebula, the premium brand of solid gold jewellery from the house of Titan, launched its Nebula Rohit Bal Collection.

 Eight models have been launched ? four for men and four for women ? as part of this collection.

 ?Changing with times is our constant feature and endeavour. We intend to provide our esteemed customers with a first-class experience by refreshing both our stores and collections,? said retailing head Dhruv Bhogra.

?The Nebula Rohit Bal Collection is one of our many 

initiatives to provide our customers with a lifestyle option in the watch segment. 

They are a blend of modern style and the traditional,? added Bhogra. 

 The watches are crafted in solid 18-carat gold. The antique mirror-finish and miniature painted dials merge into the intricately patterned gold frames to create a dazzling effect.

 Each watch is crowned with a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. The signature pieces for the ladies are created with woven gold rope and a sapphire-encrusted gold bracelet. The watches are priced at Rs 40,000 onwards.

Opulent offers

 Discounts of up to 50 per cent on diverse drapes is the ninth anniversary celebration offering at Rupahali Sarees, 1 Wood Street. ?The idea is to provide our customers with a wide variety in type, colour and fabric,? says Pradip Jain, director, Rupahali Sarees.

 The cotton range comprises simple fabrics like cotton super net, chanderi and organza. 

 More dressy options in the range include Patola with zari and resham trimmings on the borders. Prices in this category range from Rs 495 to Rs 895.

 The versatile collection of silks, georgettes, tussars, crepes and chiffon includes embroidered, designer-printed, hand-printed and block and screen-printed saris in a variety of colours. While the intricately-embroidered saris are priced at Rs 3,000-plus, the more plain and printed range starts from Rs 1,695 onwards.

 The handlooms, primarily of the Benarasi, Gadwal, Patola, South Silk and Kanjivaram varieties, start at Rs 2,500. The bandhej (tie-and-dye) saris from Gujarat have been introduced in striking dual shades. The price tag in this category starts at Rs 5,000.

 The store has also introduced a number of in-house designs with phulkari (floral) motifs and toran (a type of embroidery) embellishments.

 The lehngas come in mermaid cuts, straight fits, crushed skirt styles and traditional umbrella designs. These are in many hues and are embellished with zardosi, stones and Swarovski crystals, as well as gota, resham and tilla trimmings.

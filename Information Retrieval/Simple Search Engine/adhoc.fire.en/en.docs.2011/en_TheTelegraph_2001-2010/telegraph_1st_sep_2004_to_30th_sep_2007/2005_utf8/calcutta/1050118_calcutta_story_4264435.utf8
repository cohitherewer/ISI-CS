 Calcutta Municipal Corporation has raised the hackles of environmentalists by felling trees on a boulevard near the office of ward 87, represented by mayor Subrata Mukherjee, for the construction of two swimming pools.

 The Rs 50-lakh project is coming up on a bigha of land in boulevard no. 3, near Rabindra Sarobar. Bricks, mortars and construction material litter the stretch.

 ?I am shocked to see the condition of the boulevard. Construction of swimming pools on the boulevard is against the directives of the high court green bench. I have decided to move court to stall the project,? environment activist Subhas Dutta told Metro on Monday.

 ?At a time when we are trying to protect the greenery, the mayor?s attempt to destroy it is in bad taste,? he pointed out.

 Local residents and morning-walkers are up in arms against the mayor?s move. ?We will go on a mass signature campaign to protest the construction,? said Ranjit Basak, secretary of Rabindra Sarobar Bachao Committee.

 He added: ?We shall also send a deputation to the mayor, demanding that the construction be stopped and the boulevard restored to its original state.? 

 Mukherjee said that he had done ?nothing wrong? by trying to construct swimming pools on one of the boulevards. 

 ?Swimming pools, maintained by various clubs near Rabindra Sarobar, are already overcrowded. Ladies and children of the locality will benefit if two more pools are constructed,? he asserted. 

 The mayor claimed that the trees on the boulevard had been planted elsewhere to facilitate the construction of the pools.

 ?We have not destroyed any of the boulevard trees. Moreover, the twin pools will be an added attraction for the people of south Calcutta,? he said.

 Hridayanand Gupta, mayoral council member in charge of parks and gardens, however, admitted that some trees had been destroyed in the process of relocation.

 He said that Rs 38 lakh of the project money had already been disbursed and the remaining amount would be released by next month. 

 ?Our men are working overtime, so that the pools can be unveiled on Bengali New Year?s Day,? Gupta said.

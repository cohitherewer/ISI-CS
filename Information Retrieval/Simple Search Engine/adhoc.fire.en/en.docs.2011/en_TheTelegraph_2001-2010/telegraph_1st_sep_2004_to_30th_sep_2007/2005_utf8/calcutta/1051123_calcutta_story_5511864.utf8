 Moments from Andrew Lloyd Webber?s The Woman in White

 Andrew Lloyd Webber?s The Woman in White, currently in previews in Manhattan, is the first Broadway show in which computer-animated images completely dominate the stage. Projections appear on six 16?-ft-tall curved grey screens that move around the edge of the stage in a circle.

 The setting can change instantly: as two characters tour an estate, the actors stay put and the background dissolves from one room to another. 

 Or, the animation can take the audience through a three-dimensional environment: over fields, houses, churches and graveyards.

 Spectacles, of course, are nothing new to Webber and The Woman in White director Sir Trevor Nunn. The two teamed up on Cats, Starlight Express and Sunset Boulevard, and individually tackled The Phantom of the Opera (Webber) and Les Mis?rables (Trevor).

 For The Woman in White, adapted from Wilkie Collins?s 1860 novel, Webber wanted so many locations that elaborate physical sets would not work. One option was to use a spare turntable set. 

 But Webber saw William Dudley?s animations for Tom Stoppard?s 2002 play The Coast of Utopia, directed by Trevor, and he was hooked.

 Dudley, who studied landscape painting at St Martins School of Art in London in the mid-1960s, said he drew inspiration for The Woman in White from 19th-century British art, including the nocturnal cityscapes of John Atkinson Grimshaw and the romanticism of Pre-Raphaelites.

 He hired a team of about 10 people, including video editors and computer specialists. For the New York shows, he had to change his animation to match the script and music changes, and redesign the equipment to fit a new theatre. 

 The reception from critics was more mixed when The Woman in White opened in the West End in London in September 2004. Dudley insists that his 21st-century technology is compatible with a 19th-century aesthetic.

 Experimental theatre groups like Complicite and the Wooster Group have used video for years, as do many dance shows, operas and rock concerts. 

 Broadway musicals have increasingly included snippets of moving images. Wendall Harrington, a projection designer whose use of animation for The Who?s Tommy in 1993 was groundbreaking, said many productions today insert video to save money on scenery or to show off. 

 ?Designers must first ask themselves, ?Does it in any kind of way deliver the story better than anything else???? said Harrington.

 ?None of what I?m doing is anti-actor,? he said; he wants the background to enhance the characters? actions and emotions, not to serve as a distraction. 

 While the villagers dance, the camera swoops through the street, so the dancers appear to be moving down it. When a character is lost in the foggy London alleys, the backdrops change rapidly to enhance her disorientation.

 Other shows have started using similar techniques. Michael Clark?s projections for Ring of Fire ? the Johnny Cash musical that arrives on Broadway in February ? will have computer-animated landscapes of rural America. 

 The Menier Chocolate Factory, a London company, is using video for Stephen Sondheim?s Sunday in the Park With George.

 For Dudley, there is no question that cinema and theatre can coexist on a single stage: ?One shouldn?t be such a poor relation to the other.?

 Far from the finishing line: The Kidderpore flyover 

 I was appaled to read that out of the Rs 1,800-crore assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, only Rs 80 crore was utilised in the past five years by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (ADB project push, July 26). 

 We, the common citizens of the metropolis, had noted that work under the project was progressing very slowly, but were not aware that it was supposed to be a fast-track one. 

 Some flyovers, such as the ones in AJC Bose Road, Park Street and Gariahat, came up quite quickly, whereas work was stalled in the case of others or progressed at a snail?s pace. The Kidderpore flyover is a case in point; apparently its blueprint was faulty. Some booster pumping stations were completed and relaying and repair of tram tracks were taken up in a handful of localities, thanks to the high court intervention. Some pay-and-use toilets also came up. 

 But what is the complete picture? Calcuttans were not aware that the ADB project was not being sincerely attended to and only a meagre 4.4 per cent of the funds were utilised. 

 About a decade back, the civic body could not take up the cherished Calcutta Environment Improvement Project for paucity of funds. It would be a shame if the city infrastructure is not upgraded when funds for the purpose have been offered on a platter. 

 The new civic board plans to issue Rs 650 crore worth of orders this year. The funds utilisation needs to be strictly monitored, as otherwise, the major part of the money would go down the drain instead of improving drainage. 

 Ranesh Chandra Dey,

 Parnashree. 

 So our transport minister has accepted, that too in the Assembly, that in a developed city one should not find buses parked on the roads (?Subhas sheds a tear for north?, July 18). I would like to draw his attention to the fact that existence of bus terminals in Jadavpur and Garia does not provide the true picture of development (in his terms) in south Calcutta. Being the minister, he must be well aware that a number of buses have their termini in narrow streets in residential areas of south Calcutta. Kasba Ramlal Bazar, Garfa Shapuipara, Regent Estate-Layalka, Golf Green, Bijoygarh College, Baghajatin Hospital Road, Gachhtala, Bansdroni, Garia Station Road are only a few of the areas. There have been protests by residents of the localities, media reports on the inconveniences faced by the public and even agitation by environmental authorities. The termini could not be shifted, reportedly due to the patronage of the transport minister. Now, after his statement in the Assembly, can we expect some action by his department? 

 Pranati Halder,

 Jadavpur. 

 Hats off to Praveen Kumar, police superintendent of North 24-Parganas, for boldly stating that police can?t work independently to curb crime in Salt Lake and that they are often forced by influential residents to let off criminals (Buck pass at crime meet, July 27). If the cops are made powerless in this manner, who will prevent crime? 

 Organising meetings and forming committees have become routine for the Left Front government. The chaos is inevitably followed by hollow assurances on every issue, from traffic management to arrest of criminals. Common people have no option but to tolerate the mismanagement. 

 Madhabi D. Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake. 

 Although there are 110 policemen deployed in Salt Lake, 70 of them are busy protecting the ex-chief minister and the current finance minister (?Rampage blame on laxity?, July 28). It is quite likely that the other 40 are also engaged in the security of other VIPs. So what if the common residents of Salt Lake remain unprotected in the process. The tall talk of the top cop regarding security beef-up in the township is mere gimmick. A separate police establishment, modelled on the CRPF, is needed for Salt Lake. Recruitment to the force should be in the hands of people outside Bengal. 

 Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park. 

 Apropos the report ?Rampage blame on laxity?, July 28, I am shocked at the top cop?s remark that people tend to become complacent after following a system for several years. It is a ridiculous attempt to explain a terrible incident. How long will Salt Lake residents have to put up with incompetent administration? 

 Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur, Howrah. 

 Apropos the report ?Safety sieve at showpiece?, July 25, the robberies on the night of July 24 once again show how unsafe the residents of Salt Lake are. One of the main reasons behind the crime spurt in the township is the inadequate number of police personnel deployed there. On top of that, most of the cops are busy protecting the VIPs. The government should immediately strengthen the police force in Salt Lake. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 There are grand plans for the Dalhousie area, while the Currency Building is now being renovated (Breathing life into BBD Bag, July 23). But does that mean the Left Front respects heritage? A garbage vat stands near Town Hall. Adjacent to the old Telephone Bhavan is another garbage vat (on the Red Cross Road side). It is a minibus stop, where office-goers have to put up with the stench every day. I have heard that the garbage is removed only twice every week. 

 Shiv Shanker Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Apropos the report ?English tips for tech trek?, July 27, it is heartening that at a time when engineering graduates of the state are doing poorly in job interviews for their lack of English communication skill, the West Bengal University of Technology has come forward, along with the British Council, to help them. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos the report ?Smart cards, or fine ahead?, August 11, Tapan Debnath is not the secretary of the Automobile Association of Eastern India and the organisation did not urge its members to collect smart cards. 

 Suman Chattopadhyay,

 honorary secretary-general, Automobile Association of Eastern India.

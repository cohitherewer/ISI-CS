 Drunken driving takes toll

 - One dead, two injured near Jadavpur police station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Drunken driving by a man, allegedly an employee of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), claimed the life of a 45-year-old man on Friday afternoon. 

 Two others were seriously injured when the jeep owned by the telecom agency rammed into them on crowded Prince Anwar Shah Road. 

 The two injured men were admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, where their condition was stated to be critical.

 ?I am not aware of the incident. I don?t know if the driver was our employee, since we hire cars on contract as well. I am looking into it,? said A.C. Debnath, acting chief general manager of BSNL.

 According to N. Ramesh Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south), the accident occurred around 5.15 pm near Jadavpur police station. 

 ?Three labourers were pushing a truck that had developed a fault. The jeep bearing the nameplate of BSNL lost control and hit the trio from behind,? said Ramesh Babu.

 On hearing the loud thud, local residents rushed to the spot, only to find one of the labourers trapped under the jeep, while two others were lying on the pavement. Residents and shop-owners of the neighbourhood dragged out the trapped man.

 Officers of Lake police station arrived at the spot. ?We saw the three men lying unconscious. They had received serious injuries on their head and chest. Blood was oozing out of their wounds,? said an officer of Lake police station, adding: ?It appears that the victim was crushed under the wheels of the killer vehicle after being hit.?

 All three were taken to hospital. The victim, identified as Nilratan Biswas, succumbed to his injuries on the way. The two injured men ? Nantu Mandal and Swapan Poddar ? were kept under observation. 

 Immediately after the accident, the driver of the killer jeep, identified as Kanai Chandra Haldar, jumped out of the vehicle and tried to flee. 

 ?But he could not. He was so drunk that it was impossible for him to walk. He was not even in a position to stand straight,? said another officer. ?Local residents caught him and handed him over to police,? he added.

 ?The moment we came close to Haldar, we could get the overpowering smell of alcohol emanating from his mouth. He was first taken to nearby Jadavpur police station for interrogation. But he was not in any position to talk, leave alone answer our queries,? said the officer. 

 Police conducted Haldar?s medical test. ?The test confirmed that he was intoxicated while driving the car and it will help us prove his guilt in court. He will be produced in court on Saturday,? said another officer of Lake police station.

 Police booked Haldar on the charges of causing death by negligence and driving recklessly on a public thoroughfare. 

 ?It could have been a major accident. Because, Haldar had no control over his vehicle. He could have caused more damage,? said the officer.

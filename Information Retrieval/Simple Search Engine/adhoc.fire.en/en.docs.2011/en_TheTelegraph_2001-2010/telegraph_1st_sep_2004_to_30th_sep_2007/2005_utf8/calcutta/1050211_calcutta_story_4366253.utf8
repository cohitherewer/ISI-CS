the love bug this weekend, with Valentine?s Day just three days away. Here are 

some tips and words to woo your Valentine, straight from the hearts of Young

Perfect plan

 Here are some 

tips to help you plan a perfect Valentine?s Day and celebrate your love:

Wake up and wish your Valentine ?Happy Valentine?s Day?

Dress up in his/her favourite colours

If you?re the religious type, don?t forget to seek God?s blessings

Sit in a park somewhere and spend a few quiet moments with your partner

Watch a romantic film together, perhaps in a multiplex

Chill out with some soft drinks and junk food while viewing the film 

Go shopping ? even if it?s the window kind ? with your valentine 

Celebrate your love with a romantic candle-light dinner

Relive the memories at the end of the day, and plan for next year.

Secret of the wind

 When the moon 

was upon the mystic river, 

And the spotted deer came to drink 

A strange, faraway music was heard by my soul 

The stars and the planets, 

Wove their gossamer threads? 

He was the secret of the wind. 

While I stood by the ancient antique window, 

In the strange enchanted palace 

In the garden, 

By the stream, 

Sang the One of engraved dreams? 

He is the secret, sighed the wind. 

The call of the flute was so enchanting 

Into the scented garden I stepped once more 

Voices, tears and songs too long forgotten, 

Were remembered in a flash of Wisdom Light 

We meet in Heaven and we meet in Hell ? 

My Prince of Faery Realms and I. 

We met in the Temple of Everlasting Light 

A chance to reach perfection or become angels fallen

To know the Maker or suffer again 

The Karmic Wheel turns? 

We are endless galaxies who evolve to learn, 

(When the words are said and the tale is done), 

The most precious secret that ? 

Two equals One.

Love and loss

Drench me with 

pure light of velvet; 

Make my existence sparkle like cascade?s water; 

Make others like me feel the warmth of pain; 

Let my hope rise through pathos. 

They say? 

Existence is valued with love, 

Where no pale shadow falls 

In spite of our own losses 

Bless us with vitality of spreading sacred love 

Within several fragments of persisting emotions... 

They say? 

Lose out the sadness through your eyes, 

And don?t open the fist to let away the moments of happiness, 

But true happiness is a sense of touching every aspect of existence, 

Through pains and ironies of misfortunes. 

They say? 

Existence is seized away by cruel death 

But death gives birth to new life. 

They say? 

True love is selfless sacrifice 

But through selfless offerings love is purified at its vivid moment. 

They say? 

There?s no worth in hoping against hope, 

Yet life is always drenched with cascade of hope. 

Tuli Das, 

Class XII, Swami Pranabananda Vidyapith

Your eyes

 Your eyes are 

as dark as the night 

As deep and vast as the sea, 

I tried not to fall in love with you 

But your eyes made me. 

One day I looked into your eyes, 

The bottom I tried to reach, 

But I found myself mesmerised 

And I lost my power of speech 

Your eyes have the power 

To make someone so lost, 

I can get out of the bottomless pit, 

But losing my heart is the cost. 

I?m very lucky...

At last I?ve reached my goal! 

I?ve found what I was looking for,

But I?ve lost my soul. 

Forever I want to stay lost in your eyes 

I don?t want to live apart, 

Your eyes reflect everything, 

Your soul and your heart. 

Our hearts are one now, 

I hope this love never dies. 

All thanks to your eyes my sweetheart, 

All thanks to your eyes.

A Valentine Elegy

 The street is empty tonight. 

Only the drizzle of late winter 

Gives me company. 

Like endless pricks of a pin 

Abrading my naked soul, 

It creates music in the puddles

Where landscapes of my life are strewn. 

Dreams tossed aside 

Like empty bottles of wine, 

The deceased scarlet of the roses ? 

Is it the sin flowing in my veins? 

That stony void in your eyes 

Leeches out the goddess in me... 

And the streetlights of Valentine 

Cast long, weary shadows 

On my weathered surface.

To You...

 This time it just feels so right, 

I?ve really found my guiding light. 

Life suddenly seems so beautiful, 

and I owe it all to you. 

We shall take it nice and slow, 

With faith and trust our love shall grow, 

Happiness is what we will find, 

Forgetting the bad days behind. 

We will make our dreams come true, 

Cause you?ll have me and I?ll have you. 

We shall decide what?s best, 

and prove us different from the rest. 

Feelings as deep as your beautiful eyes, 

The adobe of love cannot be built on lies. 

I promise to give you all that you deserve, 

Come believe me I?m deeply in LOVE.

Terrorist threat

Terrorists aren?t born, they?re made. Recently, militants 

struck at Iraqi police forces with suicide bombers and mortars in Mosul and Baqouba, 

killing at least 30 people. After the world watched Saddam?s government toppled 

by the US on the basis of illusive facts like possession of nuclear weapons, the 

Bush government is now spouting windy rhetoric about a global fight against terrorism. 

But demolition of a few groups or governments is only a transient solution. If 

the US thinks of itself as protector of the world, then it should first figure 

out the root of the problem. Today, terrorism is a global concern. Terrorism has 

been in the world for many years now. There has been violence in Britain, Spain, 

France and Germany. Terrorists have slaughtered thousands in Algeria and Sri Lanka, 

and we have had the blood of thousands spilt in Kashmir and the Northeast.

Bidding adieu

Calcutta booklovers waved their goodbyes to the Book 

Fair as the curtains came down on Sunday. This time, the farewell was a bit more 

tearful as it was the last Book Fair at its old address. From next year, it will 

be held on the EM Bypass. From the first day, swarms of booklovers visited the 

fair. The third day was a wet blanket, as the rain played spoilsport. Electricity 

was cut off from most stalls for preventive measures, leaving visitors perplexed. 

But real readers enjoyed themselves, peeking into dimly-lit stalls. The first 

Sunday witnessed record numbers. The seminars, quiz competitions, food stalls, 

the pavilion of France, the steam engine pavilion of Pather Panchali, the 

cosy central park area ? all added to the flavour. We hope that with each passing 

year, the Book Fair grows bigger and the craze continues.

Black beauty

It?s boom time for Hindi cinema once again. After 

Hum Tum and Veer?Zaara brought audiences back into theatres, it?s 

Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s turn to attract the arclights with Black, a film 

based on a subject that has remained unexplored so far. Black is a far 

cry from the regular Bollywood potboilers and delves into the life of a physically-challenged 

girl and her grit to face the world. Bhansali is one man whose oeuvre is replete 

with delightful cinema. Khamoshi or Devdas, Bhansali?s finesse as 

a filmmaker is beyond doubt. While the Big B reaffirms his superstar status, Bengali 

beauty Rani Mukherjee will nudge out the competition.

Bookworm

The onset of winter in Calcutta also brings with it 

the promise of the Book Fair. For booklovers like me, it is one of the most awaited 

fairs. The overcrowded Maidan, dust-filled air, long lines at the stalls, the 

smell of new books mingled with the smell of fish fry may seem repulsive to many. 

But to me, it is the true essence of the Book Fair. People, irrespective of caste, 

creed and language, young and old, unite for their love of books. Every time, 

the fair is held just a couple of weeks before my birthday. Over the years, my 

preferences changed from Mr Pink Whistle to Malory Towers, from 

Nancy Drew to Agatha Christie, from Jeffrey Archer to Ayn Rand. But books have 

remained my constant companions and most loved birthday gifts. I think of asking 

for something different each year, but I cannot resist those freshly-printed books 

which for me are a source of sustenance. I love books, for they help me live in 

my own world. I wish children today would read more. They truly don?t know what 

they are missing. Ask me, I?ll tell you.

Curb obscene culture

The audio-visual media leaves an indelible mark on 

the mind, be it for the good or the bad. Beyond doubt, films, like literature, 

reflect the spirit of the times. Some directors and script-writers bring alive 

eternal classics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. Unfortunately, the 

Indian film industry is crossing all the lines of sense and sensibility by featuring 

offensive scenes. What we would consider taboo on the big screen is now available 

24 hours within the confines of the drawing room. Scenes of a highly revealing 

nature are rampant in films. Vulgarity and violence for their own sake should 

never be permitted on the big or small screen. If this restriction is not put 

into implementation, the culture of obscenity will get out of control.

Happiness

For everyone to be happy is a must, 

But happiness is not in the city?s pollution, dirt and dust, 

What do you think happiness is? 

For me happiness is this: 

Deep down inside your heart, 

Lies a special part, 

Which only you (no one else) will realise, 

You should save it before it dies, 

And when you are reminded of that special place, 

You are always happy, and it shows on your face.

Add up

To send off it?s first batch of succesful students 

in style, Masterminds, a branch of UCMAS, that teaches children mathematical skills 

through the abacus, is organising an event on Sunday, February 13, at St Xavier?s 

auditorium, from 4.30 to 6.30 pm. 

Watch the wizkids do the most complex of calculations 

using the simplest of tools. Giving away the prizes and spending time with the 

kids will be skipper Sourav Ganguly. 

Also on the agenda is a quiz contest for the youngsters, 

Chowka ya Chakka, to be hosted by Geeta Balakrishnan.

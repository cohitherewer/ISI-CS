 ?A whole new brand of comedy?

 From action to romance to humour, the versatile VIVEK OBEROI tells Pratim D. Gupta about why Home Delivery is different and his character quirky

 What is Vivek Oberoi doing in a quirky comedy like Home Delivery?

 Well, the director Sujoy Ghosh put a gun to my head and made me sign the film. (Laughs) Just kidding. He is a fantastic director and I had loved Jhankaar Beats. When I met him for the first time, I was shocked to see this man in half-pants. I found him funny and eccentric. Only when I met his family and saw the relationship they share, I understood where all that sensitivity in the script comes from. When he narrated Home Delivery to me, I found the script fantastic and agreed to do it.

 You did another comedy in Masti. How different are the two?

 Masti was larger than life. It was very slapstick. Apart from exceptions like Hrishida (Hrishikesh Mukherjee) and Gulzar, Bollywood has mostly seen very loud comedies. Amol Palekar, of course, was brilliant with his subtle comedy. Home Delivery is this whole new brand of comedy: quirky, very real, yet emotional.

 From action in Company and Dum to romance in Yuva and Kyun! Ho Gaya Na?, and now comedy. Is it a deliberate showcase of your versatility?

 I am not really versatile. I get bored very fast so I prefer to keep changing. You know, flipping stuff around. It?s that simple. I am a person whose heart rules the mind. I am not into strategising at all. Comedy, action, any good project, I take it up.

 Who came up with your new look for the film? 

 The whole credit goes to Sujoy and his creative team. See, I am a very lazy kind of person. They must have got sick and tired of the way I look (laughs). Basically, Sujoy wanted me to look like the character I play. And the look did help me evolve into Sunny Chopra, the role I play in Home Delivery. So the look got me into the skin of the character. Apart from that I just sat down with Sujoy and learnt about the backstory of my character, even though there is no mention of that in the movie. After I got the basic skeleton right, I just left it to spontaneity.

 What was your experience of working with Ayesha Takia and Mahima Choudhary?

 Working day and night with two beautiful women is one of the best jobs in the world. Ayesha is very sweet, very professional, natural, effortless. Poor thing, she became my sole target. She and her wonderful mom. I kept pulling their legs. Mahima, on the other hand, is wild, very much like me. We got along really well on the sets and she became my partner in crime.

 In the film, you live in with Ayesha?s character. Do you believe in this raging theme of Indian cinema?

 There is not really an emphasis on the living together aspect. She lives in Sunny?s home and the two share a very balanced equation. There are lots of tradition and values shown in the film. To me, Home Delivery is all about the warmth it exudes. It?s a film which a grandfather and a grandson can watch together. It?s a very interesting take on relationships.

 It all starts with a pizza order that you place in the film. Have you undergone a similar experience in real life?

 There?s an integral difference between my character Sunny and me. Sunny doesn?t like to pay. He talks himself out of anything. He just loves freebies. He loves conning people. Not me. I would rather tip the delivery boy more when I order a pizza.

 Which other films are you doing?

 I have just completed shooting for another comedy film called Pyaare Mohan.

 Then I am shooting for an action-adventure movie with Sunny Deol, directed by Sachin Bajaj.

 I also did the voiceover narration for Vikram Bhatt?s latest film Deewane Huye Paagal. 

 It was just a friendly gesture. Akki (Akshay Kumar) is a great friend and I also know (producer) Firoz Nadiadwala for a long time.

One of Calcutta?s first state-of-the-art health clubs, Addlife, is celebrating its third year in the fitness business. This Saturday, it will formally unveil its increased muscle power.

 Having come a long way since it kicked off with a meagre 27-client list in 2002, today, the Camac Street-centre boasts 400 members.

 ?In the past six months we have witnessed a sudden surge in fitness awareness and membership soared by 30 per cent during this period alone. Seeing the growing demand, expansion was the best solution,? explained Manish Kumar, CEO, Addlife.

 So what does Phase II for the health club involve? The expansion aims at breaking up the exercise regimen into two dedicated sections ? cardio-vascular and strength training. 

 ?With an increase in the number of machines imported from the United States, and a stronger emphasis on these two sections, the queues members faced during peak hours should be reduced,? added Kumar.

 Addlife has also made a foray into corporate healthcare, with a growing clientele from corporate houses. To reel them in, it offers corporate and group packages to suit this segment.

 The expansion also has an eye on youngsters, especially teenagers. ?The number of youngsters walking in with the intention of losing weight, getting toned or sometimes even putting on weight is unbelievable,? said Kumar.

 The health club has introduced packages for teens, with a special affordable short-term programme for those who come to the city on holiday and don?t want to break their workout momentum.

 Apart from the gym, several value-added services have been introduced over time. A juice bar, a spa ? complete with massage, sauna and steam facilities ? and regular workshops make up the complete package. 

 A library of music has also been created by city DJs Girish and Harish to cater to the varied tastes of members. 

 There is good news for those out of reach of the Camac Street address, as well. Addlife has plans of setting up branches in other parts of the city. But a six-month wait is the still on the cards.

 The formal inauguration of the expanded health club will be held on Saturday at 22, Camac Street. 

 Apart from Malaika Arora Khan?s starry presence, a series of awards will be handed out in predictable categories like fittest member, as well as more offbeat ones, like the most jovial.

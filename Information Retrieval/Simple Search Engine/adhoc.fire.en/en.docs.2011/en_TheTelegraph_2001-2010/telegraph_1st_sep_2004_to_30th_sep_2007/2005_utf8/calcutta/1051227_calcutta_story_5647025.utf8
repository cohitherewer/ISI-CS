 Astudent of sociology and communication design, Peter Bialobrzeskis interest in photography naturally encompasses a keen understanding of people and places and the relationship men share with their environment. His perception of life and nature, as manifested in his photographs, reflects his belief that a delicate balance must be preserved between the two as they are mutually dependent. At the ongoing exhibition of his large-format photographs, Bialobrzeski presents two distinctly different sets of works, depicting divergent philosophies of life. NeonTigers displays a collection of photographs of glittering Asian metropolises that serve as a testimony to the rapid economic progress and modernisation that are taking place in these mega-cities. Heimat (homeland), the second set of photographs on show, offers scenes from contemporary German landscapes. The twin exhibition emphatically juxtaposes images of post-modern dream worlds dipped in neon light, with photographs of broad plains, mountain landscapes and sea horizons, highlighting the amazing co-existence of these two contraries of life and nature. Hosted by Goethe-Institut, in association with Seagull Foundation for the Arts.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by Peter Bialobrzeski

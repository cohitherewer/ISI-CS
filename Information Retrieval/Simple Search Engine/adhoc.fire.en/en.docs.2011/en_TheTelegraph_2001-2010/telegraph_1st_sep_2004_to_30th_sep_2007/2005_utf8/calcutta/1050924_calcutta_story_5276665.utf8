 ?We are here to talk about a monster that is wreaking havoc.? The mood was grim as the civic official took the microphone to address an auditorium full of students. 

 South Point High School was the first stop of a Calcutta Municipal Corporation team headed by chief health officer Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay. The students were a cross-section from classes VII to XII. Next on the list are Presidency College and Jadavpur University.

 The team had come armed with 23 slides on the look of various species of mosquitoes and their breeding grounds. ?Which mosquitoes bite us?? ?Female? replied the chorus, armed with Madhyamik-level life science knowledge. 

 But from that point, it was vector control officer Debasish Biswas speaking. He soon had the gathering in splits while hammering home the vital messages. ?Bhenge dao, guriye dao,? he thundered, adding the next minute that it was used clay cups he was speaking about. Then, he ?became? a tyre hanging in front of a motor repair shop and crooned ?Allah myagh de, pani de?. The instruction this time was to get the mechanics to bore a hole into the tyre so that water did not accumulate. Other messages followed ? about drying and scrubbing overhead tanks, not throwing plastic bags in drains, sand-filling holes ? in a mix of entertainment and erudition.

 When he stopped, the questions started ? how does the dengue mosquito bite only during the day, will killing mosquitoes not destroy the ecological balance, is dengue fatal... 

 And they returned full of resolution. Abhipsita Das of Class IX was planning to check her garden for accumulated water. Dwaipayan Mukherjee of Class XI had resolved to speak to club elders at his Tollygunge para to organise a programme where he could pass on his new knowledge. ?We hardly read the newspaper reports,? admitted his classmate Gaurab Roy.

 The school was happy with the result. ?We wanted to make the children more aware,? smiled principal Joyeeta Solomon, as a section of the departing students flocked around Chattopadhyay, an ex-Pointer, for more details.

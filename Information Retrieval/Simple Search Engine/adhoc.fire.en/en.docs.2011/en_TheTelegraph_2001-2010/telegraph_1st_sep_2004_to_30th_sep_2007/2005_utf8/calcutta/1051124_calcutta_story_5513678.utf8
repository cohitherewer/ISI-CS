 Sonarpur plot for Sarobar squatters

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Wednesday declared that it had zeroed in on a Sonarpur plot for rehabilitation of the squatters of the Gobindapur railway colony. 

 ?We have identified about 10 acres of prime land in Madhurdaha, Sonarpur. The land belongs to the urban development department. However, it is not clear whether the site has been earmarked for a project. If we find that the land can be spared, we will rehabilitate the squatters there,? said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya on Wednesday evening.

 In the afternoon, the minister discussed the matter with officials of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. He later met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb for another round of discussions. 

 ?We will hold a meeting tomorrow to determine whether the land is available. If we can finalise the matter tomorrow, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya will appear before the high court and communicate the government?s decision,? said the municipal affairs minister. He added that the government was taking the trouble of finding a plot for the squatters ?to stall the unrest and violence that is brewing in the railway colony?.

 According to the minister, land adjacent to the site is selling at Rs 5 lakh per cottah. The value of the plot would, thus, be in the region of Rs 30 crore.

 ?We had thought the refugee and rehabilitation department would be able to provide land for the rehabilitation of the squatters. However, they have made it clear that they cannot officially allot land to non-refugees,? he explained. 

 The urban development department is also considering some other plots to rehabilitate the squatters. As in the case of the Sonarpur land, it is not clear whether those have been earmarked for projects. 

 The mayor had stated earlier that he would appear before the high court on behalf of the government and seek more time for the squatters on the plea that land to rehabilitate them was being scouted.

 With the Assembly elections round the corner, the high court directive to carry out the eviction of about 20,000 squatters by November 30 has put the government in a fix.

 The municipal affairs minister opined that people with vested interests were inciting settlers to violently resist an eviction drive. 

 Stressing that the government was rehabilitating the settlers purely on ?humanitarian grounds?, he said: ?We did not want to evict the Lake settlers at all. It was the railways that wanted the land around Rabindra Sarobar cleared. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had offered to provide housing facilities for the settlers if the railways provided an alternative plot. Despite having so much land at its disposal, the railways has not budged.?

 The shanty-dwellers of Gobindapur have so far refused the government?s offer to settle in the districts.

 Anticipating violence, the government had called off a proposed eviction drive in the area in March.

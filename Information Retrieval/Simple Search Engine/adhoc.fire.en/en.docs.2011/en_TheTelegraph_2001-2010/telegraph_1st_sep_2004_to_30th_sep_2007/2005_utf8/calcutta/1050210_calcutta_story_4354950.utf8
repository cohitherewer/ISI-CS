 The Chinese community in the city will get a special gift this New Year. The year of the rooster will see the first road sign in Chinese being put up, crowing to Calcutta the direction of China Town. 

 ?The Corporation has promised to hand over the letter of permission on Thursday,? said Paul Chung, president of the Indian Chinese Association for Culture, Welfare and Development. 

 According to Chung, the existing indicator on the Bypass between Tangra and Topsia makes one miss the eateries and go straight towards the abattoirs. The community wants another sign at the crossing of Christopher Road, which would indicate China Town in a number of languages, including Chinese. Calcutta, he points out, is the only city with two China Towns. ?One is in Tangra and the other in Tiretta Bazar. So proper road signs are needed to avoid confusion.?

 Once the sign is put up, next on the wishlist is a gate on the Bypass, opposite the boating resort. But it is not to be completely Chinese. ?We have absorbed a lot of Indian influences. So the shape may be Chinese, but some of the design elements will be Indian. It would be a tribute to the cosmopolitan character of the city.? 

 Such moves, Chung feels, are the first steps towards the opening up of the community. ?The Chinese are shy of outsiders and lack confidence in them. We have to open up to the mainstream. ?

 Another gate has been opened in the sphere of language. For about three months now, Mandarin classes have started. ?People doing business in China find themselves like fish out of water without knowledge of the local tongue. At each level, we are teaching 300 words. Three students have signed up. We have also been approached by Tata Steel to conduct the same course in Jamshedpur.? Such classes, providing a grounding in both language and culture, in Chung?s view, are also providing a platform to the Chinese to teach what they know best and interact with Indians.

 The association possesses a series on VCD on Chinese culture, gifted by the embassy. There are capsules on food, calligraphy, inventions, literature, music and even mythological cartoons. 

 ?Many of my Bengali friends, I know, would be interested in knowing about our country. But the stumbling clock is the language.? Chung hopes to translate the entire 30-part series in Bengali and English some day. ?I have got the relevant permission from the embassy, which has asked for a copy of the dubbed or subtitled version.? He plans to involve his students for the project.

 Efforts are also on to import to the city what must be the most well-known aspect of China after noodles ? kung-fu. ?We are in talks with the embassy to bring over an expert to give training.? But it will be Tai-chi, a branch of kung-fu, that will have Calcuttans warming up to the martial art. ?Tai-chi is extremely beneficial for aged people to keep fit. And I do not want youngsters bashing up others to show their expertise.? 

 But if someone is intent on learning kung-fu, the tai-chi teacher will be available for lessons. So legions of Bruce Lee worshippers, keep your fingers crossed when Chung travels to Delhi later in February.

 250-cr master plan for industrial hub

 - TURNAROUND TRYST FOR TARATALA

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The city?s only industrial estate, Taratala, is set for a makeover. Pitching in are the state government, Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and the Bengal Chamber of Commerce (BCCI).

 ?We want to develop Taratala into an excellent industrial hub, something like Sector V in Salt Lake. The project entails improving the infrastructure and the ambience around Hyde Road, Jinjira Bazar, Taratala Road and the Garden Reach factory,? said Biswadip Gupta, immediate past president of the BCCI. He is a member of the newly-formed steering committee on developing the estate.

 A Rs 250-crore master plan has been drawn up by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). It contains a ?blueprint for immediate action?, which is estimated to cost around Rs 54.5 crore. 

 This includes widening and strengthening of major roads, construction of three bus termini, taxi stands, facility centres (housing food marts, an entertainment centre, a commercial complex and cyber cafes) and a modern truck terminal.

 The project?s long-term plans, to cost around Rs 200 crore, include widening of Budge Budge Road into six lanes and rebuilding of the swing bridge on Garden Reach Road, Bascule Bridge on Karl Marx Sarani and Hastings Bridge. The aim is to open them to heavy vehicles.

 Also on the anvil is the construction of three links between majors roads in the area ? a flyover will connect Remount Road with Sonarpur Road, a ramp across St George?s Gate Road will connect Vidyasagar Setu with Hastings Bridge and a connector will be laid between Circular Garden Reach Road and Paharpur Road (near Taratala Road).

 The master plan was unveiled by CMDA officials and discussed at length at a meeting at the Calcutta Port Trust office on Monday.

 The revamp proposal received a prod in December when commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen took up the issue at a meeting with PWD minister Amar Choudhury, CPT chairman Anup Chanda, Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers chairman and managing director Rear Admiral R. Paralikar and BCCI members.

 The trade chamber is acting as facilitator, bringing the agencies together.

 The steering committee overseeing the project comprises representatives of the PWD, CMDA, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, police, commerce and industry department and the BCCI. The panel is headed by Chanda.

 Around 11 km from the state secretariat, Taratala is home to some of the biggest industrial houses in the state. While one-third of the land there is occupied by units that are functioning, another one-third comprises waterbodies, roads and closed units. The rest is vacant and could be used to set up more industrial units.

 ?Despite the advantage of having a port nearby, infrastructure in Taratala is poor and the planning has been haphazard. Our first priority is to improve the health of the existing units. Once the infrastructure is upgraded, even IT companies can set up shop here,? commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said. 

 Heavy industry, however, cannot be set up there, as the area is within the city proper.

 Police have been roped in to monitor traffic management, law and order and unauthorised construction, he added.

 According to Taposh Roy, chairman of BCCI?s Taratala sub-committee, major players like Castrol, Alstom, Britannia, Eveready, TIL Ltd, Coats India, Telco, Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Garden Reach Shipbuilders are willing to contribute to the facelift. 

 Sources said the units in the area are willing to invest around Rs 250 crore over the next three years.

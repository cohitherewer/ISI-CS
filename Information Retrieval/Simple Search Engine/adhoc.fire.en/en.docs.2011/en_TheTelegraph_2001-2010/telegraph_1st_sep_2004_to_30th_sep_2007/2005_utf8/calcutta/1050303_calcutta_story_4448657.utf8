LO-CAL

Derek O' Brien

 It was more than two decades ago that my mother drove my brother 

Andy and I to the Calcutta Madarsa in Wellesley. The historic building was our 

?away? centre for the mother of all exams (or so we thought!) ? the Madhyamik. 

There we were, all 76 of us, from that snooty Jesuit institution on Park Street, 

huddled in an examination hall. I remember what you said mom. But I am not telling.

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The McTwisters, a new and talented band on Nepals music scene led by renowned saxophonist, clarinettist and flautist Peter Kroutil from the Czech Republic , will perform at the GD Birla Sabhagar on September 16 (6.30 pm) under the Congo Square banner.

 The outfit plays its unique style of gentle funk and jazz including swing, bebop and even bossanova.

 They perform Peters own original compositions and some new pieces composed jointly with the band, says a Congo Square spokesperson. Peters co-musicians in The McTwisters line-up are ? Manoj on guitar, Nirakar Yakthumba on bass, Sanjay Shrestha on percussion and Adrian on drums, all from the iconic Nepali rock band 1974AD. But no prizes for guessing who the star of the ensemble is.

 And the star shone early. Hailing from an artistic family, Peter started studying jazz music from a very young age, playing the recorder at six and picking up the clarinet at nine.

 After high school, he went on to study at The Jaroslav Jezek Conservatory of Music where he graduated with a degree in jazz performance. His early promise was underlined by a string of awards including first place at the Czech National Clarinettists Competition (1985), the Most talented young jazz saxophonist in the Czech Republic award (1996) and the Berklee best scholarship award (2002).

 Peter began attending Berklee College of Music in 2003, studying performance and jazz competition. He recently moved to Nepal, establishing The McTwisters, which has been an instant rage, drawing packed houses and rave reviews.

 He has strong technique and seamless mastery of the clarinet as compared to the majority of his peers. Peter is an expressive artiste and also celebrates his playing much of the time, says Harry Skoler, assistant professor, woodwind department, Berklee College of Music, Boston.

 As a student of Berklee College of Music and a member of The Royal Caribbean Orchestra, Peter had the chance to perform with some top American jazz and pop music players, and has amalgamated a lot of those influences in his live repertoire.

 Back in the Czech Republic, Peter also starred in the TV mini-series The Swell Season, an adaptation of the Josef Skvorecky novel. As lead soloist, singer and emcee for The Prague Swing Orchestra, he has participated in Europes most prestigious jazz festivals.

 In 1997, Peter formed the modern jazz quintet Pratele Ticheho Jazzu, influenced by West Coast musicians like Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker. Indian music has been a significant influence and in 2002, he released his British/Indian jazz-fusion album, Bhakti Junction, in London, with established singer Renu Gidoomal.

 Big Mac may not be setting its sights on the city just yet, but the concept of the quick wholesome bite is coming to Calcutta post-Puja ? and that too, in Chinese!

 Chicken Winglets Singapore-Style with Hakka Chicken and Garlic Rice or Red Chicken with fried rice and spring rolls? Ordered, served and consumed in ?18 to 22 minutes flat? at a pocket pinch of ?around Rs 65 to Rs 90?, and just next to a preferred shop stop.

 After the Pizza Huts and KFCs, the fast food concept in Calcutta?s favourite eat-out option is set to hit town around Diwali, as Mainland China rolls out a string of quick-service restaurants, each housed at a retail rendezvous.

 Haka, the fast-food format offering a clutch of quick combos, will kick off at City Centre this November, with six more outlets planned over the next six months ? all at upcoming malls and marketplaces in the city ? and a hundred such all over the country.

 ?Fast food has great synergy with shopping and Haka has been conceptualised primarily with today?s mall milieu in mind. It?s not a fine-dining place and won?t serve liquor. We are talking of wholesome Chinese fare served at an electrifying speed, much like a McDonalds or a KFC,? says Anjan Chatterjee, director, Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd, which owns the Mainland China and Oh Calcutta! brands.

 The average cheque value at a Haka outlet will not exceed Rs 140, promises Chatterjee. ?The whole stress is on speed and we will encourage a lot of sharing with our combo platters,? he says. The City Centre eatery will have 110 covers. Typically, each Haka, spread across 2,500-3,000 sq ft, will seat 100-plus.

 Lake Mall, South City, Silver Spring, Mani Square and a new mall in Howrah are likely addresses for the other quick-bite pads in the pipeline. With a ?huge potential for takeaway?, the group has tied up with Australian food-packing majors John-Peck amp; Co for ?world-class parcel packing?.

 Singapore-based consultant Yuha, who has worked with the high-profile US restaurant chain P.F. Chang?s, will help with the kitchen masterplan. ?The economy of time and space is vital and back-end logistics must be fine-tuned to meet the high-speed rotations,? stresses Chatterjee.

 Speciality Restaurants has flown four of its fleet of 19 top chefs, including director food production Rajesh Dubey, to mainland China to study the quick-service formats there. ?Chinese is so overwhelmingly popular in Calcutta, we just have to bring in an economically-priced mass-reach model,? says Chatterjee.

AT HAND

 The 911 Guardian Phone unveiled 

at 2005 International Consumer Electronics Show has an 800-ft range from the base 

station and no monitoring fee, allowing the user to access the 911 (emergency) 

operator directly. Available in the US in April 2005 for $139. (Reuters)

Somsubhra Barik: My PC configuration is Intel 

Pentium IV 2.8 GHz, 512 MB DDR RAM, 80 GB HDD, Intel Original 845 motherboard, 

ATX cabinet with SMPS, D-Link Data/Fax/Voice 56 kbps external modem (DFM-560ES), 

Windows XP Professional. I generally keep the modem switched off unless I use 

the Internet. If I do not switch the modem on during the booting process, it is 

not detected by the system. I have to switch the modem on and detect it every 

time I want to access the Internet. I?m told it is a common problem with Windows 

XP.

TechTalk: Unlike Windows 98/ME, you have to 

switch the modem on when Windows XP loads. This is a problem with Windows 2000 

as well. The stop-gap solution is to switch on the modem, right-click on My Computer 

menu, select ?Scan for Hardware Changes?. The PC will detect the modem.

The other solution is to start Windows with the modem 

switched off and go to the Control Panel. Switch to Classic View. From Phone and 

be able to detect it and will automatically accept your previous modem as currently 

installed. 

Alternatively, remove any installed modem from Device 

Manager, switch off the modem and then click on the Add button. Select the checkbox 

?Don?t detect my modem; I will select it from a list? and click Next. From the 

Model list select ?Standard 56000 bps Modem?. (You can also click Have Disk and 

instal your modem from the driver CD that came with your modem, though ?Standard 

56000 bps Modem? works fine). Click Next. Select the port where your modem is 

attached (COM1 or COM2) and click Finish.

Rahul Gupta: I have a Pentium IV PC with 80 

GB HDD and Windows 98 and XP. I want to instal Red Hat Linux. I have the Linux 

CD but don?t know the installation process. Also, is it true that Linux doesn?t 

support FAT32?

TechTalk: Installing latest Linux distributions 

has become as easy as installing Windows. Boot your PC from the Red Hat CD or 

an installation boot floppy disk. Select your package by choosing Personal Desktop, 

Workstation, Server or Custom. Since you are running multiple operating systems, 

you should be especially careful in partitioning and formatting your hard disk. 

You will be asked to choose between automatic and manual partitioning, using Disk 

Druid. Select manual partitioning. You will have to delete an existing Windows 

partition to make room for different Linux partitions. For more on disk partition, 

visit http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-3-Manual/x8664-multi-install-guide/ap-partitions.html. 

The rest of the installation process is similar to Windows.

Finally, you?ll have Grub or Lilo as the bootstrap 

loader to choose between your operating systems. FAT32 is a file system on which 

Windows operating systems are based. Linux uses a different set of file systems 

(ext2, ext3, etc). But the latest Linux distributions can share many Windows (FAT 

or NTFS) files. 

Anindya Kar: My PC is has Celeron 1.1 GHz processor, 

256 MB SD RAM, 80 GB HDD, 52X CDROM drive, Mercury 810e motherboard with no AGP 

slots. I have 230V power supply. Can you suggest a good PCI graphics card within 

Rs 5,000?

TechTalk: Motherboards without AGP slots are 

not able to provide good graphics performance. You can opt for a system upgrade, 

rather than spending Rs 5,000 on a PCI graphics card. There are some budget PCI 

graphics cards available for Rs 500-700, but they offer little performance improvement. 

The 32 MB Matrox G450 PCI is the best option (provided 

you can lay your hands on one). The card costs around Rs 3,500 and is manufactured 

specifically for the Intel i810-based systems. It has features like third-generation 

DualHead technology and can be optimised for resolutions up to 1600x1200.

 Brothers in brawl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Trouble broke out on KC Road, under Cossipore police station, after a gang of criminals hurled bombs at a local club and fought with residents. Life was thrown out of gear till Thursday noon.

 ?Trouble began around 8 am when two extortionists, Hafizul and Azizul, who are brothers, picked a quarrel with youths of the area, holding them responsible for their arrest a few months ago,? said Sheikh Madhu, secretary of the local bustee federation. 

 ?The duo was released recently after a three-month prison term,? he explained. ?We warned them not to create any trouble in the area as tomorrow is Id.?

 Police said when Madhu stepped out of his house, Azizul threatened him. Soon, a brawl broke out, when people battled with rods and knives. 

 Azizul fled, throwing bombs at Azad Club to disperse the mob chasing him. Officers from Cossipore police station, a stone?s throw away, arrived and arrested the duo and another criminal, Nepali.

 ?Azizul and Hafizul used to extort money from traders of bustee no. 22 of the area. A few months ago, they shot a local youth after he dared to protest,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police (northern division).

 Supporters of the two criminals tried to scare local residents, but they were chased away from the area.

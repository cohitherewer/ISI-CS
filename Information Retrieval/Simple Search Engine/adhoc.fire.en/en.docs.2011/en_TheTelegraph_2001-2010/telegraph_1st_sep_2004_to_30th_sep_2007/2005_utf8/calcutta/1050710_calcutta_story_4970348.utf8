The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be on foreign shores...

For a few hours amp; dollars more 

 Delhi forms the golden triangle with Agra and Rajasthan. Mumbai has Goa and Pune. Calcutta only has Digha and a few nondescript destinations as weekend getaways, they said. But for the past year, Metro on Sunday has been profiling weekend getaways from the city, some steeped in heritage, others oozing rustic charm, plenty boasting of Mother Nature?s glory. Beaches, forests, mountains, tribal villages, temples and palaces ? there was something for everyone and all just a few hours from the city.

 Some of the contributions of where to go to have come from readers, devoted travellers exploring the countryside and rediscovering its hidden treasures. But weekend travel for Calcuttans is restricted to the countryside no more. Prices are plunging and foreign shores are easily accessible even to the budget tourist in a hurry to get back home. This week, Metro on Sunday goes beyond borders to look at some of the off-season options on offer for an extended weekend walkabout to remember.

 Nepal

 The Nepalese no-frills low-cost carrier Cosmic Air has arrived in Calcutta, with the inaugural flight landing in the city on July 8. Apart from the low fares, there are short trips available at throwaway prices. The Calcutta-Kathmandu-Calcutta flight of Cosmic Air will operate on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

 The fare is Rs 5,400 return, but for Rs 6,782 return, it?s a buy-one-get-one-free offer ? two tickets for the price of one.

 On Friday, Nepal?s minister for culture, tourism and civil aviation Buddhi Raj Bajracharya announced that Royal Nepal Airlines would also touch down in Calcutta soon. But for now, enjoy the introductory offers on Cosmic Air, valid till August 31, with efforts on to extend them till end-September. Flying time on the 105-seater Fokker 100 aircraft is a little over an hour.

 Also on offer, from Gainwell Leisure Holidays, are short holiday packages to Kathmandu. The lowest is Rs 5,199 for a two-night stay, the highest being Rs 7,999 for three nights. The packages include stay in four or five-star hotels, return airfare, airport transfers, accommodation, breakfast, lunch and dinner, sightseeing and casino coupons worth Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000. For Rs 3,999 to Rs 5,299 more, take a two-night trip to Pokhra, too.

 Calcuttans need no introduction to the magic of Kathmandu, surrounded by the majestic Himalayas. Pay homage at the temples, take a hike in the mountains or try your luck at the casinos. The best part ? let alone a visa, even a passport is not required for Indians travelling to Nepal. Other forms of identification, like a driving licence for adults or student ID for youngsters, are all you need. For bookings, contact 21121344/5 (office hours).

 Southeast Asia

 So the prices keep falling as the airlines scramble for the pie in the sky. The latest low-point is Singapore Airlines. The Rs 4,000 return tickets to Singapore and Rs 6,000 to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Penang sold out in a day. But there?s more. Rs 6,000 return to Singapore and Rs 8,000 to the other three destinations is still a steal. And, for Rs 8,000, you could even enjoy a stopover in Singapore.

 While you will need a visa for Singapore, for Thailand and Malaysia, it?s visa on arrival for a few days, for Indians. So, you could literally pack your bags and set out. There are 60 seats per flight, from July 22 to August 19, on the four flights per week out of Singapore from Calcutta, but bookings have to be made by July 15. There are plenty of places to stay, from budget to luxury, at all four holiday hotspots, Bangkok being the cheapest. 

 Through July and August, a number of festivals and events are lined up in the region. In Singapore, till July 31 is the food festival, till July 24 is the great sale, with bargains galore. August is the Celebrate Singapore month, with a series of events highlighting the culture of the place. July 23 is a charity event, and from July 15 to 17 is BayBeats, an outdoor alternative and independent music festival.

 Kuala Lumpur will play host to the Citrawarna celebrations all August. The cultural extravaganza this year has the theme Colours of Malaysia, with participants from countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, China and Korea.

 The colourful performances will be staged at various venues around the city. Also next month is the F1 Powerboat World Championship Malaysian Grand Prix 2005, in Putrajaya, near Kuala Lumpur.

 On the other hand, George Town, the capital of the island of Penang, is a sleepy somewhat colonial stop with a thriving Buddhist and Indian community. 

 And finally, good ol? Bangkok. The nightlife in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur is high on the best of international acts, but Bangkok isn?t far behind, with places like Silom Soi 4 offering pubs, bars and clubs. Sun, sand and sea are the primary attractions, as is cheap shopping and friendly locals. Take a boat ride to areas like Pattaya or Coral Islands and soak up the fun for a day or two.

 Whatever your preference, whatever your aim (honeymoon, family holiday or just some alone time), take advantage of the off-season offers and fly away for a weekend break.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Simmer after assault

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?The authorities of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital are not looking after me, and the police are not protecting me. I am feeling very insecure,? said Hasan-ul-Habib, the house-staff member recuperating from an assault by about 60 Students? Federation of India (SFI) supporters.

 ?The human rights commission is my last recourse. I shall write to it and urge it to intervene, so that I can spend the remaining three months of my stay here peacefully,? he added.

 Hasan?s mother, Nowroji Begum, who arrived from her home in Jalangi, Murshidabad, early on Monday, was forced to lodge an FIR with Tallah police station on noticing that her son?s case was not being treated with due seriousness.

 ?I was very concerned about my son?s safety here and had gone to meet the principal yesterday, but the SFI members were already in his office and forced me out before I could meet him,? Nowroji Begum told Metro on Tuesday. ?They were chanting slogans that sounded more like death threats,? she added.

 At first, Tallah police station had refused to register the FIR, after the local Trinamul Congress councillor went to the police station and threatened to block the thoroughfare and gherao the thana. 

 Deputy commissioner of police (North) Barun Kumar Mullick rushed to the spot to make sure the situation did not spin out of hand, and the complaint was registered.

 Saikat Dutta, Dhiman Das and Debasish Mishra, among others ? all interns and MBBS students at the medical college ? have been named in the FIR. 

 They have been charged with offences ranging from rioting with deadly weapons, voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means, causing damage to property, and making statements creating or promoting enmity, under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

 Regarding two of the attackers who were subsequently admitted to hospital after the incident, Habib said: ?One of them has suffered a boxer?s fracture in the little finger. The other person was bitten, but I do not remember having done anything of the sort.?

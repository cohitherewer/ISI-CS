The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Simply grand: Fave five

Elaborately attired and intricately sculpted, the Mother 

Goddess commands reverence with each gaze. Metro features a quintet of 

the quintessential Devi, basic and beautiful...

The puja on Rammohan Roy Road dazzles the pandal-hopper. 

In shining gold, suggestive of paddy, the Devi has a hand raised in benediction, 

as if to shower blessings of a rich harvest. The pandal, showcasing craft on a 

bamboo pole from Contai, has a sky for a ceiling twinkling with artificial stars. 

Artist Sanatan Dinda?s labour of love is the 73-year-old 

Nalin Sarkar Street Sarbojanin idol. The Devi is clad in red, which is heightened 

by the blood-red backdrop. She stands tall, dwarfing all the other gods in miniature. 

Her victory has been achieved as Mahishasura sits quietly at her feet, looking 

up submissively. The chandelier is done up with items associated with the pujas 

like barkosh, kosha-kushi and conch shells.

The Trikon Park idol, on Pratapaditya Road, seems 

to be wrought in bronze. The elaborate work on her chalchitra adds to the 

illusion. This Mohanbansi Rudrapal creation, though, is of vintage clay. Only 

the weapons are in brass, which the para residents remove before immersion. 

Lake Town Adhibasibrinda. The Devi commands reverence 

in the simplicity of her grandeur. The lion resembles the dragon-like beast that 

is replicated at many of the old family pujas. The chalchitra, elaborate 

by baroari standards, is worthy of notice in the ekchala idol.

The historic Simla Byayam Samity puja, patronised 

by freedom fighters, enters its 80th year. The Mother looks beautiful in her simplicity. 

The fair surrounding the puja in the park adds to its appeal.

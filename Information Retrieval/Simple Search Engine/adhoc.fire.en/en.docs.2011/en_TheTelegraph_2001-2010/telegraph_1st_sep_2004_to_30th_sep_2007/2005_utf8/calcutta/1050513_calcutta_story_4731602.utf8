 White-collar crime wing for CID

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 To counter the upward graph of white-collar crime, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is setting up an economic offence branch (EOB). Officers from the CID and the Enforcement Branch would be part of the wing. 

 ?Trends suggest that economic offences and cyber crimes would increase in the future. Since the CID is already burdened, the need of the hour is a wing dedicated to handling white-collar crimes,? said Ajay Prasad, director general of police.

 Prasad made the announcement while inaugurating an advanced fingerprint and criminal tracking system at the CID headquarters, in Bhabani Bhavan, on Thursday.

 CID officers said the EOB would be provided with sophisticated gadgets to track cyber criminals.

 Officers working in the branch would be specially trained and a system would be put in place to ensure that coordination with allied agencies only require a click of the mouse, the CID officers added.

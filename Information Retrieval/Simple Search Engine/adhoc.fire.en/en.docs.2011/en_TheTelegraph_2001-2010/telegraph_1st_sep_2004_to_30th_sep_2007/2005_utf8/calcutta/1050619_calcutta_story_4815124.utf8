Life

 On the bounce

 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Who: Kakoli Das, the only woman security personnel deputed to handle unruly crowd at a nightclub ? a position more commonly known as bouncer.

 Where: Her grey uniform is embellished with a metal detector in one hand and a lathi slung at her side. You can catch this 29-year-old at the entrance to Tantra, the disco at The Park, every weekend, when more women come out to party.

 How: A homemaker till just nine months ago, Kakoli took up the profession on the advice of a friend who was working as a security staff in a private agency. It seemed like the closest she would ever get to her long-standing dream of being a policewoman. I landed up at the office of this private security agency not sure if they would recruit me, but they did and here I am, she says with a proud smile.

 With support from family and friends, she has settled into her hatke profession. Some of her everyday duties include escorting drunk damsels off the dance floor and throwing women out if they are caught in wrong company.

 Trained in self-defence, Kakoli can hold her own against rowdies. But all this is no sweat. I come all the way from Metiabruz and the long, brisk walk from my house to the bus-stop is enough exercise, she smiles.

 Toughest Task: No one dares mess with me when I am in uniform and I enjoy that power. Yet, not everything about this job is easy and sometimes explaining to people what I do when I am out the whole night becomes a problem, she confesses.

 Coming from a conservative Bengali background, its the support of her husband that has helped her stick to the job. Every Saturday night I work here till 4 am and go home at dawn. After a quick nap, I cook my husband a nice meal for Sunday lunch and get back to work in the evening, she explains. 

 But Kakoli is far too tough to complain.

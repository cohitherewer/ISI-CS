 Queries on visa repeal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Who, on behalf of the Central government, decided to revoke the visa of Carlos Pablo Duran San Roman in December 2004? 

 That was the question Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhyay wanted answered in Calcutta High Court?s room no. 11 on Tuesday afternoon.

 He was hearing the case of the deportation of the founder-director of Sabera Foundation, a Calcutta-based NGO for underprivileged children. 

 Duran was deported back home to Spain on December 25, 2004. The writ petition challenging the order was filed by Duran?s wife Celestine.

 When counsel Abhratosh Mazumdar reminded the court that Duran?s visa was valid till November 2, 2005, Justice Chattopadhyay wanted to know who in the Central government had the right to exercise the power to revoke it. 

 Section 3, subsection 2, clause C of the Foreigner?s Act, 1946, allows the Centre to deport an individual without providing a reason.

 ?In the order of the government of West Bengal, it says that the government of India revoked the visa. Who acted on behalf of the government?? asked Justice Chattopadhyay. 

 Neither defence counsel R.N. Saha nor Mazumdar could reply. The judge adjourned the hearing till April 26 and ordered the defence to provide the answer.

 At a time when the state government has taken up the cause to showcase Bengal as an ideal investment stop, a rare collection gifted to Calcutta University by Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has opened new avenues to trace the state?s business and industrial history.

 The corpus of books, journals and parliamentary proceedings ? all dealing with business, economics and politics of Bengal, as well as of the country ? has prompted the university to introduce courses on the rise and fall of big companies in the state.

 ?Encouraged by the treasure of over 5,500 books, we have started research work on Jessop and the ordnance factory,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic). 

 ?We plan to launch similar research projects on a string of big companies ? how they were set up, how they grew and what caused their decline,? he added.

 Some universities in the country, like Jawaharlal Nehru University, and several in the West have already introduced such courses. 

 The 157-year-old Calcutta University, however, had been found wanting because of a lack of proper infrastructure, especially reference books. 

 ?Now that our Central Library has got a separate section on business history, we will include the subject for M.Phil students,? Das told Metro. ?The findings of the research can be used as the basis for developing business policies.?

 And not just research. Inspired by the collection, the university has decided to introduce a paper at the postgraduate level on business history, with special emphasis on the Bengal scenario.

 ?The collection has not only enriched the university, but will also benefit the government with the research work it will spawn,? said a teacher of the history department. 

 ?This is the first time in the past many decades that we have received such a huge collection of books from a single donor,? said Shyamal Sarkar, librarian of the Central Library, housed on the university?s College Street campus.

 ?The 10-storeyed library building, which boasts a million titles, has opened a new section on the fourth floor for the new volumes,? he added. 

 The section was thrown open to scholars, teachers and students on January 19.

 Along with the books, the chamber has donated cupboards and tables for displaying the titles. 

 Besides, a donation of Rs 50,000 has been made for repairing the library furniture and computerising the cataloguing system.

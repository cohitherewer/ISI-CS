 Block threat for duo nab

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Residents of Behala, Thakurpukur and Bishnupur, in the southern part of the city, have decided to block traffic on Diamond Harbour Road if the police fail to arrest two criminals of the area within 72 hours. 

 The criminals ? Asmat Ali Sheikh and Asgar Ali Sheikh ? are wanted in cases of dacoity, molestation, snatching and extortion. The brothers allegedly entered a house in Bishnupur on Friday night and tried to molest a woman.

 Residents of the locality allege that nothing was done to arrest the duo, after the woman?s family members lodged a complaint with Bishnupur police station. 

 Local Trinamul Congress legislator Dilip Mondal said that several complaints have been registered against the two at the police station, which was gheraoed on March 14 to demand the arrest of the criminals.

 ?The officer-in-charge had then assured us that the criminal brothers would be arrested. But nothing was done, as they are sheltered by the local CPM leaders,? Mondal added.

 Local CPM leader and district committee member of the party Ananda Biswas did not respond directly to the allegation.

 He admitted that there were allegations against the Sheikh brothers, who were even arrested and put behind the bars.

 ?We are trying to reform them. They are not members of our party. If they commit any crime that may tarnish the image of the party, we will not stop police from arresting them,? Biswas asserted.

 ?The brothers used to live in Bishnupur, but I have recently heard that they are changing residence frequently,? Biswas said.

 Trinamul leader Shakti Mondal said: ?Police will never touch the brothers, despite their activities. The cops, in fact, use the Sheikhs for various purposes. We have given the police 72 hours. After that, we will block Diamond Harbour Road and gherao the police station till the criminals are arrested.?

 Additional superintendent of police (industrial) H.K. Kusumakar denied there were complaints against the duo.

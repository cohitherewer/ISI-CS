 You share your birthday with...

 John McEnroe 

Your strength lies in your ability to forgive and forget. You know the importance of space and rarely impose yourself on people. Failure will not dampen your spirits. You have a sharp and agile mind. You 

 always speak your 

 mind. Your stamina is amazing. ? Kusum Bhandari

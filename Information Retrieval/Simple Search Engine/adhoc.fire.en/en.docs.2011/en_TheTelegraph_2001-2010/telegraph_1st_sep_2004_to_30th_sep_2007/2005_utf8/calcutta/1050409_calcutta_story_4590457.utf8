 A witch?s tale

 The quest for a new dramatic language for modern theatre, which would integrate all its diverse elements into a total dramatic performance, led Nandikar to experiment with Tarashankar Bandopadhyay?s Daini, the tragic tale of a woman, hounded as a witch all her life. Nandikar?s stage adaptation of the story, Chokh Gyalo, is an effort to discover the ideal relationship between the narrator and the dramatis personae of a play and the extent to which poetry, words and songs can be successfully woven into the text. Commenting on social evils like irrational fears, beliefs and superstitions, it also hits out at society?s self-imposed blindness, born of ignorance, which makes it thrust the burden of blame for any calamity on someone, instead of trying to find out its real cause. Thus, ostracised by society as she is made out to be a witch, Surodhuni, the play?s protagonist, lives in loneliness and misery. But what makes her story all the more poignant is that she is torn between her feelings of natural affection for others and her need to conform to her role in society as a witch. Directed by Goutam Halder; performed by Swatilekha Sengupta.

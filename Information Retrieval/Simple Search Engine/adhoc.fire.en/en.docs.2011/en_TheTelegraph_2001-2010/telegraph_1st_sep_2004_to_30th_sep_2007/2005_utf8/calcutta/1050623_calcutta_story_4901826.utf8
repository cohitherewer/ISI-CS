 Zinedine Zidane Well-liked and depended upon, your quiet, thoughtful, fun-loving and affectionate nature sets you apart. You don?t like being alone. You need to express yourself, to get out and be seen more. You have many friends and interests. You have a sharp eye for money, and enjoy it to the fullest. You have enormous drive and ambition and are impatient with anything that slows your pace. ? Kusum Bhandari

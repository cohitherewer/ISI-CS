The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Drama between beats

 Nobody wanted to explore this other side of me? including myself. So I never had the opportunity,? she laughs when asked why the stage has always seen her sing and not act. But Usha Uthup will be portraying different characters, making music and doing much more when she takes the stage on the last day of this month at CC amp;FC.

 In March, she had stunned an auditorium full of people with her portrayal of a moustached ?minister for women?s welfare?. This time, though, it will be ?a revue like the good ol? days?.

 The CCFC M.T.T.V Expose 48/14, a two-hour show produced by Spandan, is a satire on TV shows and contemporary issues. ?People take themselves far too seriously and can seldom laugh at themselves. That?s something I can do,? says Usha, in between rehearsing for the show at Vibrations, her studio in Beleghata (picture above by Aranya Sen).

 There will be a journalist interviewing famous personalities ? ?politicians, film directors, international music artistes and more? ? while a fashion show will have models bringing out the ?health in fashion and fashion for health?.

 But Usha assures that the show will steer clear of the ?buffoonery that most forms of comedy are so full of these days?. As for music, there would be lots of it, but introduced ?slyly? ? much like the message that she wants the audience to take back from the show.

 Helping her out are Spandan?s Renu Roy, music group Dhwani and anchor Shaqueel, whose talents, Usha feels, have been ?greatly under-utilised?. After CC amp;FC, more performances in the city are likely to follow, though nothing is firmed up yet. ?But to preserve the topicality, the script will have to be updated after six months,? offers Renu.

 The stage stint in May, with Three Acts, was a memorable one for Usha. ?I had a nightmare reading the script,? she admits. According to the programme schedule, Usha was supposed to sing in the third act. Right before her performance, it was announced that she would not be able to make it, and instead, a minister would inaugurate the show. ?It was great fun dressing up as the minister with the south Indian accent,? she recalls. ?Even my own driver couldn?t recognise me.?

 There aren?t any immediate plans to enter mainstream theatre, though Usha loves to act. ?I did a lot of acting in school, but mostly as a stand-up or as a mimic. Even when I sing, there is a lot of drama in between songs? something like how a south Indian and a Chinese would sing the same song in very different ways.?

 What Usha would really ?love? to do is a sad piece. A performance that would make everyone laugh but hold a sad tale within.

 For now, the stage is set for Usha Uthup and just loads of fun ? but make no mistake, ?fun is serious business?.

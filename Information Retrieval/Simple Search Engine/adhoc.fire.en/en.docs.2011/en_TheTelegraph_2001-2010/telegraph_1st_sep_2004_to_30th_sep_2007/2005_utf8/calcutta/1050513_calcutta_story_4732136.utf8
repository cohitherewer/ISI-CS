The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Siti eyes majoritycable pie

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The buyout race for the largest multi-system operator (MSO) in the city has taken a turn with a dark horse entering the fray close to the finishing line.

 The Zee group-owned SitiCable has expressed interest in Indian Cable Net, said to be on the verge of being bought over by Kalanidhi Maran?s Sun Network from Chennai. ?We are interested,? SitiCable head Jawahar Goel, who was in Calcutta on Thursday, told Metro. ?We are making a business assessment and keeping an eye on all the developments,? he added.

 Goel, however, refused comment on the price that SitiCable, an MSO with a national presence, is willing to pay for the chunk of Calcutta?s cable pie that would establish it as the city?s leading cable service provider.

 ?Every business has a valuation. My quoting a price would turn the situation into a fish market,? Goel offered.

 According to sources, SitiCable is looking at a figure lower than Rs 30 crore that Sun Network has reportedly offered. Sun officials were in town on Tuesday for ?final discussions? with Indian Cable Net.

 SitiCable currently has a 20 per cent share of the cable and satellite homes in the CMDA area, compared to Indian Cable Net?s 40.

 ?We are not aware of any such development regarding SitiCable,? was the reaction from an Indian Cable Net spokesperson.

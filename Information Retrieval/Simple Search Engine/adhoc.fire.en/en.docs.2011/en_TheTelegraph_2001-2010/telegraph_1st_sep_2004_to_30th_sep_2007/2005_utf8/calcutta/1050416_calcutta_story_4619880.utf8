The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Passage comes for a price 

Salt Lake cops stop councillor

 - Salt Lake councillor says police asked him for money

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If the going rate for heavy vehicles to enjoy ?fee passage? on city thoroughfares ranges from Rs 2 to Rs 10, the price for crossing a policeman?s path in Salt Lake could be anything between Rs 20 and Rs 250.

 The cop as extortionist is something Salt Lake ? both residents and visitors ? has learnt to live with. But now, the bad cops of the township have a fight on their hands.

 Having made it a habit to harass two-wheelers, taxis and even private cars entering or leaving Salt Lake, the men in uniform manning the area put the proverbial cat among the pigeons this time by unwittingly targeting a local councillor.

 ?I will lodge a written complaint with the higher authorities about extortion in Salt Lake on the pretext of checking. I was harassed and asked for money by police at the Nicco Park entrance point on April 8,? alleged Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor from ward number 10 of Bidhannagar Municipality.

 ?The cops stopped me while I was returning home from south Calcutta late in the evening. They asked me where I was going and said my reply did not satisfy them,? Dutta recounted.

 The cops, claiming to be from Doltala Police Lines, in North 24-Parganas, told Dutta he would be taken to nearest police station to check the papers of his car. 

 ?When I revealed my identity, a senior officer among them apologised and requested me to forget and forgive,? Dutta said.

 Senior officers said they would probe the matter. ?We will look into it seriously,? Vagesh Mishra, inspector-general of police, South Bengal range, told Metro on Friday. 

 Mishra urged Salt Lake residents to come forward with complaints whenever they faced such police harassment.

 ?On many occasions, we find two-wheelers being stopped and checked by police at various points in Salt Lake. This is done to check crime, but in the process, many common residents are harassed for no fault of theirs,? complained Ramen Das, vice-president of Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association.

 The amount ?unofficially? sought from people at various spots in Salt Lake range from Rs 20 to Rs 250. 

 ?If those caught have no connections and are cowed down by the cops, the rate climbs. The main targets are couples coming to Banabitan or Nalban and the taxi drivers,? said a CPM councillor of the township. 

 ?We receive a large number of complaints from taxi drivers about coughing up money to cops at Salt Lake,? said Madan Mitra, secretary, Progressive Taximen?s Union. 

 ?We have written to the state transport department and Salt Lake police officials, but nothing has been done so far,? he alleged.

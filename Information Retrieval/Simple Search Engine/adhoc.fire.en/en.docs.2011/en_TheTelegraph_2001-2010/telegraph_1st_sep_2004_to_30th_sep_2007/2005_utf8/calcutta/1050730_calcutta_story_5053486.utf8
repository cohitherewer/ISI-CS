The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kaleidoscope of creativity

 Assamese Attribute: A scene from Gantha, performed by Jirsong Theatre 

 Ganakrishti?s annual festival has carved a niche for itself over the years by spotlighting younger, lesser-known groups from across the country, compared to Nandikar?s winterfest that highlights much bigger names. This time, though, it rapidly deteriorated into a ho-hum affair until the last couple of days somehow barely extracted it from the dustbin of forgotten history. 

 For one thing, it included as many as three productions already seen in Calcutta ? Meghabati, adapted from Antigone by Ritwik (Behrampore), Saoli Mitra?s play reading of Rakta-karabi, and the host?s own 17 July. Furthermore, of the four remaining shows that came from outside, only one left any impression. 

 That exception, Gantha: The First Text by Jirsong Theatre (Guwahati), at least upheld Ganakrishti?s quest for adventurous new work. It was exciting to see a troupe that originated in the politically disturbed Karbi Anglong district 10 years ago and continues to perform periodically in Karbi. Now led by Rabijita Gogoi, it shows the clear influence of the National School of Drama style that she absorbed as an alumna, but also an original vision that brings postmodern experimentation to Assamese theatre. 

 Gantha wove together 11 performance texts chosen from poems by Sameer Tanty, Megan Kachari and Nilamoni Phukan (one of them an ULFA activist), essays, collectively-developed themes and even an extract from J.M. Synge?s Riders to the Sea. The effect was akin to Robert Wilson?s concept of ?Theatre of Images? ? without narrative, an impressionistic sequence of symbolic scenes and episodes that flit by, creating a kaleidoscope of contemporary Assam.

 So we see agrarian life and terrorism, nature and politicians, lovers and globalisation, individual angst and ritualistic prayer, education and unemployment, ethnic identity and the mainstream, all jostling one another in the context of Assam. 

 The production was an always-shifting audiovisual treat (of which the photograph left gives some idea), with an installation designed by artist Dilip Tamuli, colourful costumes and set pieces, a satirical magic show, and slides projected on the backdrop. The soundscape, too, was complex, using taped tracks as well as live singing and musicians. 

 The most that can be said about the only other non-Bengali participant, Rupkatha, from Allahabad, is that on its double bill, the appetiser proved better than the main course. Tuhina Mukherjee?s half-hour solo interpretation of Adam Gondvi?s poem Sarayu Par ki Dastan brings a needed feminist perspective into Hindi theatre in the heartland of Uttar Pradesh, though it looks and sounds ordinary by the more layered standards of theatre for women?s empowerment that we have seen in Calcutta and from other parts of India. But Rupkatha?s Shatabdir Panchali, a Bengali dramatisation of Jane Anderson?s richly ironic Tough Choices for the New Century, was by common consensus worse than a club show. 

 Another newcomer, Damama, from Siliguri, went retro with a bang, reproducing Utpal Dutt?s Dilli Chalo (1970) in antiquarian manner. One of Dutt?s forgettable jatra plays, it fictionalises the Indian National Army?s (INA) entry into Manipur alongside the Japanese in World War II like a typical wartime adventure movie. Very simply plotted, it hinges on the ?secret? that Netaji never shows up at a rendezvous where he has promised to appear. Any wannabe Alistair MacLean can cook up such a ?surprise?. 

 Additionally, it sees the INA expedition from a strictly communist viewpoint, while explaining away the latter?s support for the British during the War. Partha Chowdhury?s direction perfected the military drills but did not downplay the melodrama. He himself enjoyed the part of the sadistic British Colonel Brennan, so adeptly acted in jatra by Bijan Mukherjee. 

 As for the local entries, only Nabamayukh?s Warish stood out with a strong performance to bring down the curtain on the festival on its final evening. A few years ago, this newspaper had discovered Nabamayukh?s promise on Bhadreswarir Galpa when nobody else gave this young group the time of day. Its subsequent meteoric rise to the respected ranks of Bengali theatre is remarkable, but then that is a different story, for another day.

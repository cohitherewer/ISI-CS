The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Perk up with puff pleasures 

Plan a Party

The happening hookah is the way to go while 

hosting a theme do, says Zeeshan Jawed

 Do 

 Ask a friend who is making a trip 

to Mumbai to get you some exotic tobacco flavours 

 If you are hosting the bash on a terrace, throw around charpoys instead 

of regular chairs 

 Make the menu predominantly non-veg and set up a barbecue if you have space 

Don?t 

 Go for very loud music. Soft Arabian 

tracks is best suited for the theme 

Hookahs have long been elevated to status-symbol status, 

moving out of smoky sanctums into public hot spots all over the country. Its allure 

is more than just about regal attitude, it is considered to be a less harmful 

alternative to smoking. 

?Hookah is in vogue and getting hooked to hookah is 

better than smoking cigarettes. It is not very harmful and adds loads of attitude 

too. The variety of flavours make it my favourite,? says Somik Roy, a second-year 

student and regular at the city?s hookah bars.

But if you are not very fond of the crowded dance 

floors, try throwing a hookah party of your own. 

Hot spot

The shishas (which means hookah in Arabic, 

all loaded up and ready to light) will emit a lot of smoke, so it is always advisable 

to have a hookah party in an open space unless you have proper ventilation facilities. 

A terrace or a lawn is the best site to fire things up.

Throw around some charpoys instead of tables 

and chairs. And if you want to be more adventurous, dress the waiters up in Arabian 

attire. 

Flavour facts

There are three types of hookahs ? the ?grandfather? 

variety which are several feet tall, the medium-size version that we see everywhere 

and the small one where you can inhale tobacco directly from the pot. If you are 

having a hookah party at home it is advisable to use the standard size, as it 

is not space consuming. 

You will be spoiled for choice when it comes to flavours 

of tobacco. Pick from flavours like peach, apricot, cola, mint, jasmine and strawberry. 

However, unusual flavours are also catching on. ?There is a growing fan following 

for milk, cappuccino and caramel flavours. Vodka and cocktail flavours are also 

quite popular,? says Sovon Mukherjee, manager, Shisha Bar. 

Flavoured tobacco is brought in from Mumbai, so you 

should plan your party well in advance as you may have to make a trip yourself. 

However, normal hookah tobacco is readily available in Calcutta. If you are hell 

bent on the fancy flavours but don?t have sources in Mumbai, you?ll have to stick 

to Shisha Bar on 22 Camac Street or Fusion at The Golden Park where you will find 

everything at your disposal.

Menu matters

Anything non-vegetarian goes down best with the aromatic 

puffs. Having a barbecue alongside will only add authenticity to the ambience. 

The smell of roasted meat and the sight of glowing charcoal can take you anywhere 

from Egypt to Afghanistan. 

Indian and Chinese starters could work, but it is 

Lebanese food that is in vogue. Names like Tagin (Lebanese-style baked fish), 

pita sandwiches and Fathous (a Lebanese salad) may sound alien, but when they 

are ready and placed before your guests, they are sure to fly off the plates. 

Tune talk

You will have to give loud music a miss for one night. 

The music has to be soft and soothing, creating a hypnotic effect, helped by the 

clouds of steam and smoke being let out around the puff party. 

In true lounge style, the dance floor is not the centre 

of attraction. Just sit back and relax. 

Arabian music is best suited for the theme of the 

party. Tracks like Habibi, Nari nari and Al husna are surely 

going to leave you puffing for more. And if all else fails to soothe your nerves, 

the original version of Sting?s Desert rose will never let you down. 

But if your guests get a hookah high and insist on 

showing off their dancing prowess, switch over to some Arabian fusion music. It 

will not disturb the theme of the party and will also provide ample scope for 

a jig.

?You will always have some people who will want to 

hit the dance floor. So it is better to keep some hip-hop tracks ready. But it 

is trance which is going to rule the revelry,? says DJ Girish of Shisha Bar.

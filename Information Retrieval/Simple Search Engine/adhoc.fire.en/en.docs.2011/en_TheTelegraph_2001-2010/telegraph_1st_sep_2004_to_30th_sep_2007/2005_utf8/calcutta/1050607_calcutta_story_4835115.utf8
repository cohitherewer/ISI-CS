 Oil pump raided in CM yard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An armed gang of six raided a petrol pump on Old Ballygunge Road, close to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Palm Avenue address, early on Monday and looted lubricants worth around Rs 1 lakh.

 This was the third time in the past six months that the neighbourhood was raided by armed goons. After the first incident, a daylight shootout in front of Bhattacharjee?s residence, an officer-in-charge of Karaya police station was transferred. The chief minister had expressed displeasure over the incident.

 A few weeks later, two groups of criminals hurled bombs at each other at the Palm Avenue-Broad Street crossing.

 Elaborating on Monday?s incident, deputy commissioner (south) Anuj Sharma said the six miscreants, travelling in a Tata 407, came to the petrol station around 3.30 am. As the pump was closed, the goons knocked on the door and asked for fuel.

 ?They told us they were badly in need of fuel. We did not suspect anything, as they had a vehicle,? one of the three pump employees told police.

 As soon as the door was opened, four of the goons, all in their early 30s, overpowered the employees. ?Brandishing bhojalis and firearms, they first asked for the cash box keys. When we told them the keys were not with us, they tried in vain to break it open,? recalled the employee. 

 The goons finally left the pump with eight barrels of lubricating oil and sped towards the Gariahat flyover.

 Cops of Karaya thana did not react even an hour after receiving news of the dacoity. ?We wanted to be sure the pump employees were not misleading us,? said an officer.

 Deputy commissioner Sharma said: ?We are investigating the case from all angles. The employees are being examined thoroughly. We are not ruling out possibility of insider involvement.? 

 The officers have contacted the patrolling vans deployed on Old Ballygunge Road and at the Gariahat crossing on Sunday night. 

 ?None of the men on patrol duty in the area last night noticed a Tata 407 or any vehicle similar to it,? an officer added.

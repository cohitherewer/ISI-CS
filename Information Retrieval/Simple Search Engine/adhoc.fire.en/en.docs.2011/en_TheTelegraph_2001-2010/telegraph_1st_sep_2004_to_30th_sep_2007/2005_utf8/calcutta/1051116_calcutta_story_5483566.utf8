 ?I was under-confident?

 Attempting her first out-and-out comedy, 

 MAHIMA CHOUDHARY tells Pratim D. Gupta about entering a new 

 phase in her career with Home Delivery

 Mahima Choudhary with 

 Vivek Oberoi and Ayesha Takia in Home Delivery 

 What made you sign a quirky 

 comedy like Home Delivery?

 It is my first attempt at comedy. 

 Having done a lot of issue-based cinema and many serious 

 films, I am finally doing something light. In my earlier 

 movies, I have spoken against dowry, been involved in love 

 triangles and chased straying husbands. 

 Even in Priyadarshan?s Yeh 

 Tera Ghar, Yeh Mera Ghar, which was a comedy, I had 

 a serious role. So this is my first real fun film.

 But it?s not your standard 

 Bollywood comedy?

 Yes, it?s very screwballish, not 

 slapstick at all. You have such a talented director and 

 such a great entourage of actors. The whole set-up was so 

 huge that it was a pleasure playing the part.

 Weren?t there many big names 

 in the fray for your role?

 Sujoy (Ghosh) is a great friend 

 and when he came to me with the role, it was so brilliant 

 I prayed to God that it goes to someone else. I told Sujoy, 

 you must get someone fantastic to play the role. I was really 

 under-confident. The problem with us actors is that we always 

 hope that something different will come about and when something 

 different does come, we do na-na, ni-ni? My 

 sister then told me to go for it and here I am.

 You play an actress named Maya 

 in the film. How different is she from you?

 Maya is a north Indian actress 

 who?s made it big in the south. So, her attitude is very 

 different. She is a narcissist? obsessed with herself and 

 very self-driven. There is a lot of innocence in her, yet 

 she is very passionate. I am very self-conscious but Maya 

 is not. She is just full of herself.

 You have also played an actress 

 in Tanuja Chandra?s Film Star?

 Yes, but the genres of the two 

 films are so very different. There I play a north Indian 

 actress who takes up another issue and is largely sad and 

 lonely. But in Home Delivery I have a very flamboyant 

 approach to things.

 So did you model yourself on 

 any famous actress for the role?

 Not really. The way Sujoy has 

 sketched her character, it became very easy for me. He deliberately 

 made her a big actress from the south so that she looks 

 larger than life. Actresses from the north are identifiable, 

 but down south you are worshipped and temples are made for 

 you. This iconic quality was a must for Maya?s character? 

 Sujoy has made me wear a lot of colourful 70s costumes to 

 get into the role.

 You share screen space with 

 Ayesha Takia. Were there fireworks on and off the sets?

 Ayesha is a very good girl. We 

 had a nice time off-screen because we hardly have any scenes 

 together. Just one little song where we both appear. It?s 

 only when she leaves the apartment where she is living in 

 with Vivek (Oberoi) that I walk in.

 Before Home Delivery, 

 there?s The Film?

 That I did for another friend, 

 the film?s director Junaid Menon. It is in fact very much 

 in flavour with what is happening this week with Abu Salem. 

 In The Film, a struggling bunch of people pose as 

 the biggest dons of Mumbai to extract money from producers 

 and make their own film. So when the real Shameenbhai 

 gets to know, he wants to know who?s spoiling his name. 

 Oblivious to all this, police want to catch up with the 

 bhai. It?s a very dark comedy.

 What else is in your kitty?

 I just shot for an English film 

 in the UK called Pusher, which is a term to refer 

 to drug peddlers. It looks at the Indo-Pak community in 

 the UK and how a lot of youngsters there are getting into 

 drugs. Then there?s Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana with Rekha 

 and my other English film, Tanuja?s Hope And A Little 

 Sugar. And, of course, there?s my first attempt at Bengali 

 cinema with Kaushik Ganguly, which should start anytime 

 now.

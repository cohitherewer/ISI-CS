The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Special-normal, together in class

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Does the school you go to have a ramp for wheelchairs? Are there books in the library in Braille? Is your teacher qualified to teach special children? Do you have a special child as classmate?

 For students in most schools in the city, the answer to all of these questions is likely to be ?no?. Inclusion is gaining awareness as a notion but is yet to pick up in practice. 

 On Saturday, a meeting will be held at Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy to discuss the Central government?s plan of action for inclusive education of children and youth with disabilities.

 ?We are expecting disability activists from all neighbouring states as well as representatives of the governments and apex education bodies. Schools are also coming,? says Rati Misra, senior programme officer of a Delhi-based advocacy group called National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) which will submit its findings to the ministry.

 This is the third programme after zonal meets in Chennai and Mumbai. The final one will be held in Delhi where a roadmap will be unveiled.

 The meeting will have a specific agenda. ?On March 21, a vision statement for the education of challenged children and youth has been tabled in Rajya Sabha by human resource development minister Arjun Singh which pledges to make education disabled-friendly by 2020. It is a significant step since the Disability Act in 1995,? points out Nupur Mishra, programme officer, communications.

 The 1995 Act had earmarked three per cent seats for challenged children in government/government-aided educational institutions. It also mandated facilities to ensure they have access to education.

 ?A decade has passed. But access still remains the biggest impediment,? says Misra. Saturday?s meet will address that problem, as well as teacher training, examination system and curriculum development for the disabled.

 The meet will be partnered by Loreto Day School, Sealdah. ?We do not expect these children to measure up to the intellectual standards of the rest. But in the inclusive system, they are socially better adapted. Other students are also sensitised,? says Sister Cyril of the school, which has about 60 special children on its rolls.

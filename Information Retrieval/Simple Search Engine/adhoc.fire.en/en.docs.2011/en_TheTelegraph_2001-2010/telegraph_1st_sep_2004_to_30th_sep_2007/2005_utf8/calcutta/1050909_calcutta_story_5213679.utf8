The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campus open yet closed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The students of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) opened the academic blocks of the main building on Thursday in the run-up to the twin meetings lined up by the authorities early next week.

 But the students have stuck to their decision to boycott class and other academic activities until the authorities provide some solution to their long-standing academic problems.

 ?We opened the academic wing on Thursday to facilitate the academic and governing council meetings, which are to be held on September 12 and 14. But this doesn?t mean that we have called off our strike, which will go on till the authorities meet some of our demands,? said an outgoing student of SRFTI.

 ?We will continue to stay away from classes and other activities, like project follow-up, post-production and library work,? the student added.

 This open-yet-shut decision was conveyed to institute director Abhay Srivastava and Afzal Amanullah, secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting, on Thursday morning.

 The academic and governing council meetings will address matters of financial and academic irregularities that the students have charged the institute with. While the academic council looks after academic functions, the governing council supervises overall running of the institute.

 This apart, the agitating group of around 150 also wants ?proper student representation? in the two councils. 

 ?We will ask for four student members in the academic council and two in the governing council with voting rights,? added the student.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rat writ feasts on civic fibre

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The rat writ has extended far beyond Writers? Buildings and is nibbling at another red bastion in the city ? the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 The favourite rodent feed at the civic hub seems to be the computer lifeline ? optical fibre cables. 

 The link points at the server and CPUs are most vulnerable to the onslaught. 

 Desperate to stave off the marauding brigade, the authorities have sought help from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), whose experts are at work in the civic body on the Rs 100-crore e-governance project, being funded by the British government.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has directed his acting deputy in charge of e-governance, Nandan Roy, to approach the consultants and save the information technology network from being ruptured.

 The rat-wreaked departments ? both in the headquarters and other offices ? include assessment, treasury, health and market. The situation in the assessment department has come to such a pass that hearings had to be postponed on two consecutive days in November.

 People coming to the treasury department to deposit their taxes are being told: ?Server is down. Come another day? .

 An anxious Bandyopadhyay said: ?We are in the process of carrying out a massive computerisation drive in the civic offices. A few months hence, delivery of services to citizens will depend on smooth functioning of the computer network. The menace has to be rooted out immediately.?

 Shankarlal Mukherjee, caretaker of the civic headquarters, told Metro that a private agency had been engaged to catch and kill the rats, More than 2,000 have been trapped this year but thanks to markets in the vicinity, the population shows no sign of declining.

 ?It is a new subject for our research,? said Ajoy Kumar Mondol, a rodent expert of Zoological Survey of India. 

 It has to be ascertained first whether the material used for making the cables contains anything that rats love to eat or chew on, he added. ?For example, rats eat soaps because of the fat in it.? The other possibility is that the rodents chew on the optical fibre just to appease their gnawing instinct. 

 ?The menace is not unique to the civic office. But it is definitely more acute in old buildings,? pointed out Jayanta Saha, of TCS.

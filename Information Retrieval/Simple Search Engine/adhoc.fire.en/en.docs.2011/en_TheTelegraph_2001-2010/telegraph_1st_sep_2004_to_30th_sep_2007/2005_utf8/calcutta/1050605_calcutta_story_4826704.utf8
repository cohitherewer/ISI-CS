 Bangalore clubwear in Calcutta disco

 That Calcutta is yet to find a mature fashion audience was once again established at Tantra on Friday night. On the ramp was the most high-voltage show in recent months. In the audience were nightclub regulars with impassive faces and feeble applause.

 Even a sizzling swimsuit collection at the end failed to generate the desired response, despite desperate attempts by the cat-walkers to spice things up.

 The bar-top fashion show at The Park nightclub, organised by fashion exponent Prasad Bidapa, showcased the summer line of Bangalore-based designer Manoviraj Khosla.

 The Bangalore connection extended beyond the designer and the organiser to most of the models walking the ramp. Sanjukta from Mumbai and Tina from Calcutta shared the stage with Bangalore-based models Asha, Rachel, Anoushka, Usman and Rakesh, among others.

 The high point of the clubwear line was clearly the fabric story. A mix of cotton and Indian silks with fabrics from the world over lent a brilliant sheen to the outfits. I have sourced fabrics from all over the globe ? Japan, Korea, France and many other places ? and combined them with Indian natural fibre textiles. Its a hard-edge clubwear line, said Khosla. The melange also featured a fair amount of denim.

 The bare-dare silhouettes for women ? skimpy tops in a variety of styles, minis, three-quarter pants and short dresses ? hugged the body like second skin. The men flaunted structured shirts, jackets and trousers in interesting weaves.

 The colour story for men revolved around black, white and red for the most part, but a line of vibrant velvet pants and see-through flowing shirts was the high point.

 Whites dominated the womens range, with blacks and browns complementing it. A dash of colour and shimmer was added in the end with a line of heavily embellished cocktail dresses.

 The summer collection over, a fun-filled presentation of a line of swimwear followed, with summery floral sarongs draped over bright one-piece and two-piece swimsuits. The models clearly had a blast in this round as they grooved in pairs to the beats of Teri toh?

 The show ended with Bidapas promise of being back next month with an exclusive womens night, where men would be restricted to the ramp alone. A tribute to Bollywood heroes, the July show will be the second of a series planned by Bidapa for The Park.

 I am very excited about this series as I have always loved doing shows with The Park. I plan to bring designers from across the country who havent showcased in Calcutta so much before. I am looking at designers like Suneet Verma, Manish Malhotra, Rocky S and Ayaz Khan for the coming months, he signed off.

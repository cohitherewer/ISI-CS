 Crime patrol

 No television crime shows have made a mark in the collective consciousness of Germans as Tatort (Scene of the Crime) in West Germany or Police Call in East Germany. From 1970 to 2002, more than 500 episodes of these two series were shown, in which over 70 inspectors and their teams hunted down criminals from all over Germany, both in rural surroundings and in big cities. In co-operation with Eike Wenzel, a German thriller specialist, the Goethe-Institut has compiled an excellent collection of episodes of these TV crime series. The episodes being screened concentrate on the reality of German society from the time shortly before re-unification until the present day, at the same time highlighting latest developments in the content and art of the audio-visual medium. Screened in German with English sub-titles, today?s film, from the Police Call series, features Thanner?s New Job (picture above) directed by Bodo Furneisen. Acting as an implicit historiography of the past 20 years in Germany, both the series reveal dramatic moments of the two Germanys? past and present in fictional plays and, in the process, capture the spirit of several critical periods of their unified history.

 Destitution and despair have kept her company so far. But a glimmer of hope and opportunity awaits the girl child living on the sidewalks.

 In a simple, yet moving, ceremony on Tuesday, Loreto House Educational Society signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Partnership Foundation of Holland, whereby Loreto schools will set up homes across the country for girls at risk on the streets at night.

 Speaking on the occasion, Ferdinand Van Koolwijk of Partnership Foundation said: ?It is hoped that through this collaboration, it can be demonstrated that the worldwide tragedy of girls at risk on the streets does not have to be accepted as a ?fact of life?. 

 ?Large-scale solutions can be successfully implemented when the ?heart? of the world of charity is combined with the ?head? of the business community,? he added.

 Partnership Foundation has agreed to provide the necessary financial support so that the inmates of these homes can be groomed over the years to join the mainstream.

 The Loreto Sisters, who have contributed over the past 350 years for those on the margins of the society, will take up the responsibility to transform these girls into responsible citizens. 

 Sister Cyril, principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, said: ?We plan to enrol 1,000 girls in this program by 2008 and 10,000 girls by 2018. The financial support provided by Partnership Foundation will take care of basic expenses of the girls and should also cover the salaries of the staff members associated with this project. The objective is to mainstream these girls into the schools along with regular students.? The first of these homes will be set up in Calcutta.

 Tuesday?s ceremony was attended by several dignitaries, including B.K. Dalmiya, honorary consul of the Netherlands, senior state government officials and principals of all Loreto schools.

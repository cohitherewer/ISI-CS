 Cancer care tool

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over 200 cancer specialists ? including surgeons, radiotherapists and oncologists ? from across the country gathered at a city centre on Sunday to take part in a seminar on management of the disease.

 The seminar, Update on Cancer Cure, also marked the opening of a super-speciality radiotherapy facility at AMRI Hospitals. ?The huge gap in cancer care will be bridged with the commissioning of the radiotherapy unit,? said S.B. Purakayastha, president of AMRI Hospitals.

 At the seminar, doctors highlighted the fact that cancer care was much more than surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. ?Cancer disturbs the whole family. It affects the victims physically, emotionally and financially. A concerted effort must be made to improve cancer care through love and sympathy,? Purakayastha said in his address. 

 The hospital has decided on the following moves:

 An affordable package for radiotherapy 

 A helpline for patients? queries 

 Counsellors to look after patients and families

 Cheap and safe accommodation for patients and relatives.

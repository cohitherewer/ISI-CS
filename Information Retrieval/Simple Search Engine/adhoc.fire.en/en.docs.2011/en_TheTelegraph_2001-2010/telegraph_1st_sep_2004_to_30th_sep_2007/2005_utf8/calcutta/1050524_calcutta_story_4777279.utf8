 Relax at the late-night bar or the beer garden after a splash in the pool. Savour a steak at the cafeteria, or rustle up a favourite snack in the well-appointed kitchen of your spacious suite?

 Enter, the city?s ?first apartment hotel? ? a facility of 84 serviced apartment suites ? to be up and running by November 2006. For the long-stay corporate traveller in Calcutta this would mean living in star style and home comfort spending ?around 50 per cent of five-star tariff?.

 Coming up in the heart of Sector V, Salt Lake, at a cost of Rs 20 crore, the basement-and-G+9 apartment hotel developed by the Sureka Group will have a built-up area of 120,000 sq ft.

 ?The world over, business travellers who have to stay in a city for long periods of time prefer serviced apartments to star hotels. We will create a home away from home that would make life easier, more comfortable and enjoyable for them, offering four-star luxury at three-star rates,? explains Pradeep Sureka, managing director of the group.

 Targeted primarily at the IT traveller, the facility will have 48 studio suites, 450 sq ft each, and 36 one-bedroom suites, 650 sq ft each. A mini mart on the ground floor for daily requirements and a business centre and health club apart, there would be a restaurant-cum-bar on the top floor. The apartments would be fitted with the usual home accoutrements, from a TV set to a music hi-fi, refrigerator to ironing boards, hook-up desk telephone to laptop ports.

 There is a rising population of floating IT professionals, consultants and corporate travellers in Calcutta, feels Sureka. ?TCS alone uses up 150-room nights per month in star hotels. With existing majors like IBM and Wipro and players like Unitech, DLF and Ascendas waiting to come in, the demand for serviced apartments is bound to spiral.?

 The first-mover apartment hotel, with its first two floors catering to a single-tenant IT office, will also target the short-stay corporate traveller, corporate-cum-leisure traveller, the educational institutes-related segment and medical tourists. ?It?ll be a no-frills place,? says Sureka.

 Missing child?s body in hydrant

 OUR BUREAU

 Barely a fortnight has passed since four-year-old Ganesh Palodhi was found murdered in Bauria, Howrah, exposing serious lapses on the part of policemen. 

 On Monday morning, the law-keepers came under fresh fire when the body of a 14-month-old girl was recovered from a hydrant in Kamarhati, on the city?s northern fringes.

 Mohammad Jamaluddin, who works in a local tailoring shop, watched horrified as residents recovered the body of his daughter Bilkis from the hydrant near his house at Kamarhati More around 7.30 am. 

 Bilkis went missing on Saturday but police were reluctant to act even after Jamaluddin complained to them. A missing diary was registered on its basis.

 Minutes after the body was recovered, hundreds of neighbours assembled there and gheraoed the police in protest against their inaction.

 They even tried to prevent the police from removing the girl?s body. 

 Some of the agitated people put up a block on BT Road, near Kamarhati More. The situation worsened when contingents of forces were requisitioned from the adjoining Titagarh and Khardah police stations. Some vehicles were damaged when the agitators started to throw stones.

 Rapid Action Force personnel have been deployed in the area and an uneasy calm prevails. Besides, senior officials are camping on the spot. The body has been sent for post-mortem. 

 Manas Mukherjee, CPM legislator from Kamarhati, blamed police inaction for the girl?s death. He alleged that the girl must have been strangled to death before the body was thrown into the hydrant. 

 ?Though some people were interrogated, the motive is yet to be established,? he said, adding that the CPM had called a 12-hour bandh to protest the ?ghastly incident?. 

 Jamaluddin, who is yet to recover from the shock, told police that his daughter went missing while she was playing with others at his residence around 9 am on Saturday. ?We complained to the police in the evening when we could not trace her. But police did not act promptly,? he alleged. 

 ?We conducted a search in Kamarhati and its adjoining areas but were unable to trace the girl,? claimed Subhasish Chakraborty, a sub-inspector at the Kamarhati outpost.

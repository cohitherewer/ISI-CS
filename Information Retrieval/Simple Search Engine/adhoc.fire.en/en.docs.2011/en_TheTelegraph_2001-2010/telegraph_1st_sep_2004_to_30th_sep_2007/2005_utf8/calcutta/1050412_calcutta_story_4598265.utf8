 Tequila sunrise at dusk

Come sundown and it?s time for a tequila sunrise at The Junction, the pub at Taj Bengal. The tequila festival, on for the entire month of April, is the latest chill-out option this summer. 

 On the menu is an assortment of colourful tequila cocktails, shots or shooters. The Margarita, Ruby Rita and Brave Bull are all mixed with cointreau, while the Stinger has a dash of Cr?me de Menthe and the Tijuana Sling has Cr?me de Cassis. Other specially created tequilas include the Psycho Tsunami (curacao), Birds of Paradise (amaretto), Tequonic (angostura bitters), Tequini Cocktail (vermouth), Tequila Sunrise (orange juice and grenadine syrup) and the Rosalita (cinzano rosso). Margaritas in flavours like peach, mango, banana, watermelon and strawberry are also on offer.

 ?Tequila is considered the safest elixir to get a party going,? smiles chef Surinder Singh. His recipe to avoid a hangover: down lots and lots of water.

 The drinks are priced between Rs 350 and Rs 450.

 Coffee buys

 Coffee shop adda received an artistic edge with an exhibition of traditional crafts at Caffeine by Nimble Fingers. The exhibition titled Baisakhi at the Elgin Road address is featuring dokra, terracotta, wood, paper and glass artefacts. Chimes, small idols, paintings, candle stands, small cloth pouches, owls made of dokra, wood and coconut shells, masks made of paper pulp and junk jewellery are some of the items to look out for.

 The NGO, committed to providing a global platform to the artisans of Bengal, has got a mixed response to such exhibitions so far, which are held from time to time at the same venue.

 ?We are convinced that repeated exhibitions and displays will ultimately influence the young, urban market,? says Shyamashree Sen, president, Nimble Fingers. 

 The products are priced between Rs 10 and Rs 5,000. The exhibition will be on till April 25 between 11 am and 9 pm.

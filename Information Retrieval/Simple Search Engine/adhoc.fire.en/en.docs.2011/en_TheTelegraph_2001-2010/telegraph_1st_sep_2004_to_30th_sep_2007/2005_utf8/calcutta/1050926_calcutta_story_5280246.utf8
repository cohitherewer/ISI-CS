 If its raining malls in town, the latest cloudburst is over Gariahat. As The Gariahaat Mall throws open its doors with Westsides second store as anchor, comfort and cool have become buzzwords at the south Calcutta market hub.

 With the Westside store on Camac Street doing exceptionally well, we decided to reach out to a wider section of people. This store defines wearable fashion. Fashion for every man, woman and child. In short, fashion that is value for money for a greater number of people, said Simone Tata, chairman, Trent Ltd, in town for the launch.

 But what about competition from Pantaloons, Gariahats favourite clothes store? Well, it always is an incentive for you to excel further, smiled Simone.

 Westside launched the store on Thursday in style with a series of events. First up, a ramp show choreographed by Sanchita Kushary Bose. 

 City models Shrestha, Pooja, Reema, Abhishek, Sanchita, Neeraj and others showcased the latest Westside collection. Aniruddha Chakladar was in charge of make-up.

 From the Western section, models flaunted loose trousers, informal tops and capris in bright and sober shades.

 A red floral salwar suit, a pretty olive green crushed skirt with silver and red lining and kurtis for men and women were picks from the range of Indian casuals.

 The Western formals included classy jackets and suits in solid black and grey, striped and plain shirts with ties.

 Mixing music and masti with the serious business of clothing, host Mir welcomed on stage Jojo, who belted out a medley of popular Bengali and Hindi numbers.

 After the break, the audience was treated to a special sequence on denims ?trousers, skirts, capris and jackets. 

 The collection of sports and gym wear was in step with todays style and fitness requirements.

 With Puja 2005 in mind, the Indian festive collection flaunted the short and medium kameez with parallels and churidars for women, while the men were presented with a host of kurta-pyjama options.

 Then, Jojo was back as if to introduce the sizzling club wear. She took the stage with chartbusters like Zara zara mehekta hai and Dhoom machale?

 When the models came out in halter neck tops, cocktail dresses and short skirts with asymmetrical hemlines, the gapes and gasps were not to be missed.

 Finally, the Styler Kotha contest, a Westside initiative in association with Anandabazar Patrika. Simone Tata, actor Arjun Chakraborty and his jewellery designer wife Nilanjana were the judges.

 Four families walked on to the ramp and answered questions like How would you like to spend the Rs 1 lakh prize money for the benefit of your locality? Who would you like to have dinner with: Shah Rukh Khan or Prosenjit? Which do you prefer, a joint family or a nuclear family?

 At the end of the day, Niladri Sarkar, his wife Ditipriya, son Bisakh and mother-in-law Gopa Banerjee walked away with the prize money.

 Websites are a wealth of information, especially when it?s something that one doesn?t have ready access to. Here?s browsing through five sites that come handy for all matters on stage ? from Bengal to Broadway, Mumbai to West End. 

 www.banglanatak.com

 This is a ready reckoner for theatre-goers in town. On offer is the schedule of plays across the state, the auditoriums (with details on the size, capacity, sound and light facilities), ticket counters, bookings and even the latest theatre publications. 

 Developed by a group of young entrepreneurs, the website has everything from stagecraft to theatre troupes located in the city and the districts. It provides extensive information on a wide range of topics in both English and Bengali.

 Separate sections on stage direction, acting, forms of play, set design, costume, make up, sound and light discuss the theoretical basis of each topic before suggesting more practical tips. 

 The section on costumes, for instance, starts with an introduction to Bharata?s Natyashastra and Rabindranath Tagore?s plays before switching to workshops and experts in the field. 

 The site will also help those digging up information on theatre groups or personalities across the state, with each profile (on the troupe or the personality) containing a brief biography, works and awards. 

 www.mumbaitheatreguide.com

 If it?s the Mumbai theatre scenario you are looking for, this is a must-browse. The site promoted by glamsham.com portal leads you through a gamut of recent productions in English, Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati. Be it a critically acclaimed play or one loaded with star value, there are details on the content, cast and crew. 

 One can also read up reviews, updates and profiles on artistes and theatre groups working in all four languages. The site has an exhaustive list of auditoriums across Mumbai, with addresses, contacts and capacity. 

 There?s a window on theatre in schools, offering material on workshops and Indian institutions on theatre.

 If you want to catch up with a Broadway show in New York but don?t have a clue how to go about it, here?s help at hand. The site floated by the League of American Theatres and Producers gives show-by-show information on plays and musicals on Broadway, the length of a performance, where and how to book tickets, theatre locations, plus special events, if any. 

 What makes the site special is its eye for detail ? talking about the food spots where one can grab a bite before a show, or familiarising the theatre-goer with what to expect from a Broadway play. 

 The site also compiles information on the 39 designated playhouses in Manhattan?s Theatre District, plus all those troupes currently travelling across New York and North America.

 This is a more newsy website, regularly updating browsers about the recent happenings in the London theatre world, from who?s won which award to the annual revenue generated by West End productions. 

 This, too, is a repository of information on auditoriums, productions and show schedules, with facilities for online buying of tickets. 

 An A-to-Z listing of top 100 plays provides a quick glance through what to choose from. Each piece is a brief introduction to the play, with opening and ending nights.

 Unlike the others, this website is a comprehensive source for all theatre aspirants ? be it in acting, direction, stagecraft, stage management, costume or sound and light. Here are the ABCs of starting a theatre group from scratch with advice and suggestion from experts in each field. 

 The articles on acting, for one, carry tips on audition dos and don?ts or what a budding actor should know. The section on stage direction features discussions from script analysis to writing comedies that sell. 

 And one of the most interesting windows is the one on make-up, with tips on blood and gore to beard and moustache. The content developers have also kept a section on Shakespeare, briefly introducing aspirants to the Bard and the theatre of his times. 

 Even more important for learners in this stream is the glossary of theatre terms ? from ad lib to zoom ellipsoidal.

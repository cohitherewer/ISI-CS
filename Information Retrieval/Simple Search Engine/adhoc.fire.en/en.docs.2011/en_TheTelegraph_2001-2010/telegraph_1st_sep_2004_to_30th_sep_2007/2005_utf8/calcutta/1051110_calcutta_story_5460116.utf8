 Man of music: Ronn Moss

 You know him as the handsome and suave Ridge Forrester in the STAR World soap The Bold And The Beautiful. But when Ronn Moss came to Mumbai, he was very much the singer who also acts. Currently on a world tour to promote his album Uncovered, Moss was very proud of his stint as a singer.

 ?I feel it?s my most honest work to date,? Moss says. ?This collection of songs seems more suited and closer to me than ever before. The process of recording is often a strenuous one. I?ve needed 25 hours in a day to complete it, but I really feel it was worth every stolen minute.?

 Californian entertainer Moss started out his career in a succession of bands as a bass player and vocalist, including the highly successful Player which had a number one worldwide hit with Baby comeback. Only after that did Moss move into acting, landing the starring role in The Bold And The Beautiful. Nineteen years later, he continues to play the role of Ridge Forrester in the popular TV series and also make good music.

 ?For the most exciting part, beginning 2006, I?ll embark on a worldwide concert tour in my attempt to bludgeon as many people as possible with my particular melodic rock and roll acoustic pop music,? Moss smiles. ?Keep your eyes and ears and, more importantly, your minds open in the next couple months ?cause I?ll be comin? to you in one form or another.?

 Brain of bollywood: Amisha Patel

 Her Jwala stint in Mangal Pandey may have lasted just a few minutes on the big screen but there?s no taking away from Amisha Patel the fact that she was once a gold medallist in economics and is still one of the only Bollywood actresses to be invited to cerebral dos.

 This time Amisha was asked to speak on the Development and Impact of Indian Film alongside such names as Shashi Tharoor and Soni Razdan in an event organised in Mumbai by Tufts University. While Tharoor, the under-secretary-general for communications and public information of the United Nations, made the most interesting presentation, Amisha just stuck to the ?wonderful experiences? she has had as a reigning queen of Bollywood.

 While the crowd did applaud when she announced proudly how mothers in Pakistan name their daughters Sakina after her character in Gadar ? Ek Prem Katha, Amisha couldn?t really stick to the topic of discussion.

 But at the end of it all, she was presented with a crystal elephant by Tufts University for all she had accomplished in the industry.

 After Sai Baba, comes Ganga Maiya. Starting this Sunday, 9 am, STAR Plus brings us yet another mythological from Ramanand Sagar. Titled Jai Ganga Maiya, it is the story of Ganga ? how she was born and ruled the other gods.

 As legend has it, Ganga?s flow was so powerful that Lord Shiva had to step in and capture her in his cascading hair, thereafter letting her flow gently through his matted locks over the Himalayas.

 It is this core part of the story of Ganga that will be brought alive by the seasoned small-screen touch of Sagar, who had made the trendsetting Ramayana.

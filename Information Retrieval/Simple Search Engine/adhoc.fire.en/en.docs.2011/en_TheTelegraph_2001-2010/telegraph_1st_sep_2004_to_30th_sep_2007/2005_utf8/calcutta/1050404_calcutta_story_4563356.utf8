The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can't get through this week without? 

Hogging to the hilt

If you had to survive on stale provisions for much 

of last week owing to the traders? strike protesting VAT, this week, indulge yourself 

with a vengeance to make up for it. Load up on all those everyday delicacies you 

missed, just in case the rumours of price hikes come true. 

Create some sparks

Diwali may be a long way off, but the proposed slash 

in electricity rates calls for an impromptu light-and-sound show by way of celebrations. 

Throw a glittering party to outdo your neighbour?s wedding bash. Or, show your 

eco-friendly streak by sending out a message for conservation by opting for a 

magical night by candlelight.

 Taking cover

It is likely that the grime of the rain-licked city 

streets has helped you get over the dramatic urge to drench yourself in a sudden 

squall. So, if the rain gods (and the weatherman) are to be believed, it is best 

to keep your rain gear right and ready, for the nor?wester season has just begun. 

The yearly phenomenon ? a breezy respite from the sun at first, and then, increasingly 

a pain ? still catches most of us unawares and umbrella-less.

Catching Oscar?s baby 

The best picture-winner at the Academy Awards has 

(finally) released in town, and you just can?t afford to miss it. Million Dollar 

Baby, the story of impossible odds and determination sees Hilary Swank of 

Boys Don?t Cry fame play a woman fighting her way into the fierce world 

of professional boxing. Apart from her million dollar performance, you just can?t 

miss director Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman (who earned his best supporting 

actor award every second he spent on screen) in action. Go in armed with a box 

of tissues and leave reassured that Ray lost fair and square in Hollywood?s 

hottest race of the year.

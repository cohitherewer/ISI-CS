The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without?

 Trying to make it to Cannes next year

 Dont just drool at the glitz and the glamour on the red carpet. Be a part of it, next year. If you cant find a generous enough producer to sponsor your crazy ideas, seize your handycam and start shooting at will. India is a diverse country with a treasure trove of ideas. If you cant fathom a feature film, try your hand at a documentary or two. And before everything, get yourself a gorgeous gown ? for Cannes or Collotola!

 Pledging your naina to the people

 A film or a celebrity sure helps refresh our memory towards greater causes (no wonder every wannabe beauty queen gets away with pledges of charity and social work). The public interest litigation against the Urmila Matondkar-starrer Naina brings alive the cause of eye donation. You wouldnt want a treasure such as sight to go waste when so many fellow humans are afflicted by the curse of blindness, would you?

 Getting a mammogram done

 Dont wait to be on the wrong side of 40 to worry about breast cancer. Celebrity afflictions bring home the fact afresh that the disease can strike as early as 29, as in the case of pop singer Anastacia. Better be safe than sorry, for not everybody will have the support system that Australian sensation Kylie Minogue has garnered. So at least be aware.

 Incuding peekaboo in your wardrobe

 Chuck the boring khadis and linens. Summer is a good excuse to make a sexy statement in sheer laces and crochets. Raid the shops for lace and crochet tops, ponchos and kurtis. A touch of these for day wear and full lace and crochet works pepped up with lots of shine and shimmer for evening wear will ensure that you turn heads at all times. No, you dont have to slip a sack over it till you arrive at the party ? ever heard of spaghettis?

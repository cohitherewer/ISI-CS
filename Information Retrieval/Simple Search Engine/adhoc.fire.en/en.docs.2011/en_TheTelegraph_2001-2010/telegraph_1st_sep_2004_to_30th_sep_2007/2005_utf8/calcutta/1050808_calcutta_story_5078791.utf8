 From being an integral part of the economic strategy during the Swadeshi movement to the favourite of fashionistas, khadi has travelled the middle distance and more.

 To initiate an awareness programme on the antiquity, potential and quality of this handmade fabric, Khadi Silk Emporium, run by Chandra Kanta Lalit Mohan Resham Khadi Samiti, at Ultadanga, showcased an authentic collection of saris on August 5. 

 Tollywood actress Koneenica and models Ishika and Shreya draped some of the creations. 

 An extensive range of baluchuri, jamdani, ikkat, Pochampalli silks and cottons reflected the unmatched craftsmanship of rural artisans. Ethnic and very much in, the fabric is being pitched as the right one for Indian climatic conditions due to the loose weave and cool texture.

 The collection comes in myriad shades of pastels ? green, orange, pink and white. Embroideries like kantha stitch and interesting designs add to the grandness of this rich fabric.

 Bday bash

 The birthday bonanza continues at another city address as the Metro Shopping Centre gets ready to celebrate its fifth anniversary on August 23.

 The birthday will be preceded by a 22-day Metro Plaza Fifth Anniversary Double Dhamaka where shoppers will walk away with lots of gifts and discounts.

 All the 250 shops at the Ho Chi Minh Sarani mall will offer discounts up to 50 per cent on their products. 

 The Dhamaka will be loud and clear on the final day, with food festivals, celebrity visits, fashion shows and live DJ music.

 The market is completing five years and we thank our loyal customers for this. We have developed a loyal clientele and we are always working towards improving our relationship with customers, says Imran Zaki, vice president, Metro Shopping Centre Shop Owners Welfare Association.

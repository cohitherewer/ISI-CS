The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 A series of events like poetry sessions and a book bazaar 

 were held at the Rabindra Sadan-Nandan-Bangla Akademi complex 

 recently. However, the ground where the events were held 

 and the stalls set up was uneven. Elderly visitors had difficulty 

 in walking around in the area. It would be appreciated if 

 the authorities level the ground surface before hosting 

 any such event in the future. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake. 

 I noticed quite a few times that the roadside lamps near 

 the Wipro campus in Salt Lake and on stretches of Aurobindo 

 Road, Salkia, were left switched on throughout the day. 

 Is it one of the many ways the state government wastes the 

 public?s hard-earned money? I am from Bhilwara, Rajasthan, 

 and I am visiting relatives in Calcutta for a few months. 

 When a similar complaint was brought to the notice of higher 

 officials in Bhilwara, some civic personnel were sacked 

 for neglecting their duty of switching off the street lights 

 on time. Will any action be taken against the offenders 

 here? 

 Bhavna Rathi, 

 Howrah. 

 On April 29, I went to Calcutta University?s enquiry counter 

 on its College Street campus at 3.30 pm to get information 

 on when the forms for the law course will be distributed. 

 Though an advertisement in a local newspaper on April 16 

 had other details, it had failed to mention the timing when 

 the forms would be sold from the office. The middle-aged 

 bespectacled staff member manning the counter didn?t seem 

 to be in a good mood. He claimed everything was mentioned 

 on the notice put up on the display board. After much debate, 

 he walked up to check the notice himself and found that 

 the information was not there. The authorities should not 

 miss out on such small but important details in notices 

 and advertisements.

 Prantik Sanyal, 

 SP Mukherjee Road. 

 Recently, I had a bitter experience at Mumbai railway station 

 (Victoria Terminus). I was accosted by a policeman at the 

 main entrance of the station. My luggage was searched and 

 I was questioned about why I had gone to Mumbai. I saw a 

 few Bengali gold polish workers, returning to Calcutta for 

 the summer, also being grilled by the cops. One of them 

 was asked to pay Rs 2,000 just because he was wearing a 

 gold chain. Several others were also forced to fork out 

 a tidy sum. The gold polish workers are also fleeced by 

 local goons when they arrive at Howrah. Can the security 

 personnel stop this harassment, at least at Howrah? 

 Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 

 Lalbazar Street.

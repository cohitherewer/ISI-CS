Cops call for bouncer rein

 Keen to ensure that the image of the city?s nightlife does not take a beating during the New Year revelry, the police brass have directed the owners of discotheques to ensure that the bouncers do not take the law into their own hands and unnecessarily act tough. 

 It has been suggested that the bouncers seek the help of the cops deployed outside the nightclubs, should a situation threaten to spiral out of control. The patrons should not complain of rash or violent behaviour by the bouncers, the police have stressed. 

 ?The hotel-owners have been told that there should not be any situation which might lead to a law-and-order problem. The cops are there to deal with those who violate the law. We are only a call away,? said a senior officer at the Lalbazar headquarters. 

 According to police sources, the move follows complaints at police stations by the patrons against the bouncers. On a few occasions, even tourists from abroad have protested the manner in which the security personnel dealt with them.

 The most publicised incident of the kind happened some months ago, when a Dutch citizen working with an NGO in the city was severely beaten up at a discotheque in central Calcutta. It was subsequently decided that while bouncers may tackle those acting smart under the influence of alcohol, they must know where to draw the line and the norms of client servicing. 

 This year-end, it?s not just the bouncers at discotheques that the cops are worried about. Intelligence reports suggesting that blasts were being planned on the Maidan, the Lakes and some parks have propelled the police into action. 

 A surveillance blueprint was chalked out at a recent meeting of the officers-in-charge of Maidan, Park Street, Lake and Bhowanipore police stations. The policemen have been asked to maintain a strict vigil, especially on the Maidan. A close watch will be kept on gatherings in parks and groups on motorcycles. The men in uniform, however, do not want a repeat of the incident in Meerut, where couples were harassed by the cops, resulting in a countrywide uproar.

 ?This year, we will ask people to move out of the Maidan after 8 pm due to security reasons. The same holds true for the Lakes. Both the areas are not properly illuminated. A special team on motorcycles will do the rounds of the parks. There will also be plainclothes officers at important junctions,? said an assistant commissioner.

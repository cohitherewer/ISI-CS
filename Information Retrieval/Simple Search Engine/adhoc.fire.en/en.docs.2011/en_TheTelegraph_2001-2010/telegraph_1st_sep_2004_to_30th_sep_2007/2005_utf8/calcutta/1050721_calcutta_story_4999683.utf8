 Take a walk in the world of Deshu in D. Shoot cops and earn points. If you survive the encounter, a grudging scroll greets you: ?Kismat achhi thi jo bach gaya?.

 Carry Jadoo on your shoulders and run to save the alien from the cops, a la Hrithik Roshan in Koi? Mil Gaya. If you fail, you have to bear the heart-breaking sight of the friendly ET being carried off.

 Help Sarkar Subhash Nagare solve specific problems in his constituency before the elections and watch a victorious Amitabh Bachchan wave to you.

 Bollywood is spinning its magic beyond screens small and big to reach the liquid crystal displays of mobile phones, reinventing new avatars with every Friday release. And we seem to be game for more.

 About 4.5 lakh mobile games are downloaded every month in India. ?Of that, some 2.5 lakh come from our server,? says Arun Gupta, COO of Mauj Telecom.

 Mobile gaming is a habit gaining ground. ?Unlike console gaming, which requires one to stay put in front of the screen at a specific place, mobile gaming is just five minutes of fun, to be experienced while waiting at a coffee shop or stuck at the traffic light,? explains Gupta.

 The first game Mauj developed was in November 2003. ?A large chunk of the games people play here is indigenous. Perhaps the local factor appeals that much more.? Though the classic Alaskan Holiday and Diffuser top the download list with figures of 43,000 and 35,000, games with an Indian connection are catching up.

 A year-and-a-half ago, a cricket game called Rahul XI was developed, for which Mauj ran a simultaneous off-line contest. Every time someone played a game, he won four points. The points could be uploaded on the Mauj site. The highest scorer was invited to meet the Team India vice-captain. ?The man who won had notched up a score of one-lakh plus. So he must have played the game for more than 70 hours,? exclaims Gupta.

 Yet, cricket lags behind Bollywood when it comes to gaming preferences ? ?interest in cricket is seasonal but Bollywood is on for 365 days?. Mauj opened its Bollywood account with three games based on Hum Aapke Hain Kaun...! ?Now we look at one film every Friday,? says Gupta, adding that a repertoire of 65 Hindi film games has been created in a year.

 Production houses are also realising that games based on the films are big property. Rajshri Productions, UTV, FilmKraft, Ram Gopal Varma Productions and others have tied up with Mauj for games and other wireless content. So they are promoting the games during the movies themselves. ?In both Sarkar and Yakeen, you see a full-screen promotional before the credits roll, asking viewers to download the games. The lead developers also get a mention in the credits.?

 Now, stars are being roped in to lend glamour to the publicity grind. Manoj Bajpai, Deepak Tijori and the Shetty sisters attended a press meet to promote a contest on Fareb, for which the prizes were a dinner date with Shilpa and Shamita, and their costumes used in the film. Abhishek Bachchan and Ram Gopal Varma announced a contest for BSNL users on Sarkar.

 The Mumbaiyya Godfather has notched up four lakh-plus responses. Arijit Mukherjee, a 27-year-old IT professional, was among those who responded correctly to all the Bachchan questions that flashed on his cell screen and is awaiting the lucky draw for a crack at the Big B?s rudraksh, his black lungi and kurta. The Bachchan fan, who watched the film on the first Sunday after its release, is now hooked to the game.

 ?It is an interesting new medium that helps perpetuate the brand. The revenue is small but growing, and we have to be careful not to go for overkill. A game will work only for specific movies, with definite ideas,? explains Ronnie Screwvala, CEO of UTV Motion Pictures, which produced D.

 UTV, he says, will be looking at mobile games while counting the USPs for its forthcoming releases Rang De Basanti and Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh but ?we are taking decisions on a film-to-film basis?.

 The gaming industry is not getting stuck in just Bollywood, though. ?An emerging trend is the regional pull. The southern states as well as Singapore have a demand for Tamil content, while even Bengal and Bangladesh have scope for games on Bengali films,? says Gupta, promising an announcement with two Bengali movie ventures in the next couple of weeks.

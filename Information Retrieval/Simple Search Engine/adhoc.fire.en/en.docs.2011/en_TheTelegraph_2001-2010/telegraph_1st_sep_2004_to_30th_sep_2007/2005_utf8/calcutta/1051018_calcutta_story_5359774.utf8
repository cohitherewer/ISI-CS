 Sporting score card: Expected to be abysmal.

 Software score card: Expected to be a Perfect Ten.

 Whatever be India?s performance at the Beijing Olympics 2008, one Indian success story is well on its way to being scripted ? and that, too, in Calcutta.

 Salt Lake Sector V-based Skytech Solutions is involved in the design, development and implementation of the airport messaging software to act as the nerve centre of the Beijing airport?s communication system during the premier sporting event.

 The company that offers comprehensive solutions and software development services to the airline industry has successfully implemented the Central Information Integration Management System (CIIMS) at the Guangzhou airport for the past eight months. A more advanced version will be the focal tech tool at Beijing airport for the Games.

 With an estimated influx of almost 4.4 million spectators from across the world, Beijing airport will have to withstand tremendous logistic pressure during the Olympics.

 ?The CIIMS software is the nerve centre of all communication between the airport and the air-traffic controllers, various gates, terminals, ground crew and the numerous airlines,? says D.K. Chaudhuri, CEO, Skytech Solutions.

 And what has been the role of the Calcutta office in this Olympian task? ?We are a Bengal-based company, and almost all our global strategy consulting and project management is done from our headquarters in Calcutta. Barring a few projects, our entire team for the Guangzhou and Beijing airport projects is based here.?

 CIIMS enables various messages to be exchanged across different sub-systems. The multi-channel message oriented middleware (MOM) data bus allows various systems, built on different technology platforms, to communicate with one another.

 Chaudhuri explains: ?This is a software-driven, intelligence-driven communications network, programmed to react to multifarious situations and act accordingly. The Olympics is going to be a showpiece, and the Chinese will be pulling out all stops to ensure that Beijing airport is fully equipped to handle every situation.?

 For example, if a particular airline is scheduled to land at a specific terminal, but is delayed, CIIMS immediately conveys a message to the airport authorities to allow another plane to land in its place.

 Skytech ? which has a current growth rate of about 60 per cent, is eyeing a turnover of Rs 160 crore at the end of the current fiscal ? stresses the need to upgrade airports in India.

 As Chaudhuri puts it: ?Indian airports need to get used to the idea that they can make profits, but for that they have to be utilised and optimised as much as possible.?

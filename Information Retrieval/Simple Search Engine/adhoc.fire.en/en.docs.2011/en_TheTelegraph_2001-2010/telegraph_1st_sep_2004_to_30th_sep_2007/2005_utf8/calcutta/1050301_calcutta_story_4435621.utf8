The three-day fashion bonanza in the city last weekend came to a close on Sunday night with a show titled Haridra ? celebrating the advent of spring. 

 While Friday and Saturday saw design biggies from Mumbai, Delhi and Goa haute up the ramp at The Oberoi Grand, Sunday?s event was a tribute to the style gurus who have made Calcutta famous in the international arena. 

 So it was the turn of designers Ritu Kumar, Sharbari Dutta, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Anamika Khanna to enthral the packed house at the Tollygunge Club.

 Organised by Spandan, HSBC Premier and Tollygunge Club, the show attempted to celebrate ?the spirit of yellow? (which explains the name), but the colour was strangely missing from all the collections. The ace designers dazzled with their finery, but the rather boring choreography left much to be desired. The music, however, matched the mood of each collection.

 The show kicked off with Sabyasachi?s collection of saris in pastel and neutral colours and soon moved on to lehngas in more vibrant hues. Red and gold dominated the lehnga line, with his trademark motifs in antique gold adorning almost all the garments. An ornate bridal lehnga in red and gold, flaunted on the ramp by actress June, stole the show in this sequence.

 After the riot of colours unleashed by Sabyasachi, it was Anamika?s turn to tone down the mood a bit with her ?diffusion? line in white, ivory and beige. The limited collection included a few pieces the designer had showcased at the Stylefile autumn winter show 2004, with a few new additions. 

 Jackets of varying lengths, drainpipe churidars, skirts, kurtas and dresses with liberal doses of shine and shimmer in the form of embellishments and lots of layering described the look here. 

 The neutral base colours were set off with vibrant embroidery and surface ornamentation, mostly using floral motifs.

 If men were feeling rather left out all this while, Sharbari put them at ease, unveiling her range of elaborate ethnic ensembles for them next. 

 Rich tones of maroon, black, navy blue, saffron, red and dark green combined very subtly with tussar, off-white and white, played out a regal drama on the ramp. The outfits included traditional dhotis, kurtas, angarakhas and chadars, as well as some long jackets, trousers and shirts. Sharbari?s trademark embroidery adorned each piece.

 Not only was this the only men?s wear collection in the show, Sharbari?s line can also be termed the most well-accessorised sequence of the evening.

 Next, the focus was on jewellery. A range of diamond ornaments from the house of M. Walters and Company was paraded on the ramp. The sparkling neckpieces, earrings and wrist wear were showcased to stunning effect by models dressed in plain black outfits in flowing fabrics.

 The grand finale to the gala featured two collections by Ritu Kumar ? from her pret Label and couture line. The first sequence presented a Peacock line where the models, draped in flowing crinkled skirts teamed with stylised lycra singlets, almost danced on the ramp to the beats of Thandi hawa kali ghata. 

 The palette comprised peacock shades of blue, green and purple.

 The queen of Indian bridal wear went on to showcase her latest line of lehngas in ?the colours of Holi and Rajasthan?. The ensembles in red, purple, green, pink, orange and blue, embellished with the designer?s typical ethnic motifs and zardosi work, gave brides-to-be an eyeful. 

 The models, who sashayed down the makeshift ramp at the club, included actress June, Candice Pinto and Sharan Mishra from Mumbai, along with Amrita, Sudipta, Tanushree, Priyanka Pal, Priyanka Nandi, Jessica, Shrestha, Neeraj, Amitava and Sourav among others.

 Post the style show, singer Shayne Hyrapiet took the stage to belt out some Hindi club remixes.

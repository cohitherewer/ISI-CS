 A group of mountaineers from Calcutta on a pilgrimage to Hindu temples in Pakistan. Mission possible, with lots of help from officials on the other side of the border, despite a little interference from the ISI.

 Thirty-nine members ? 31 women and eight men ? of the South Calcutta Mountain Lovers Association have made their dream come true and become celebrities in Pakistan. 

 The plan took all of 10 months to become reality. But for three weeks, it was an adventure to remember. 

 ?We had initially applied for the visas for four people in February last year. It was refused, till we got together a larger group. The visas finally came through on November 12,? said D.C. Thakur, secretary of the association and the tour organiser.

 The motley crew set out on November 27, reaching Lahore on the 29th. Till December 18, the group scanned the length and breadth of the country. 

 Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation chairman Mohammed Habib Khan had described the tour as the first by such a large group of Indians. 

 Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad apart, the Calcutta travellers touched base in Multan, Peshawar, Hyderabad, Taxila, Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Larkana, Thatta (Sindh), the hill station of Murree, the pilgrim point of Hinglaj Mata and other places.

 Although it was essentially a sightseeing tour and not a trekking trip, the mountain lovers did make it up around eight kilometres from Hinglaj to Analkund.

 The group was given VIP treatment and met minister of state for tourism Sumaira Malik. The local people were friendly, always ready to dish out special treatment to their Indian guests. Even police officers in every place they visited were more than happy to help. 

 But there was a small price to pay, in the guise of ISI officers keeping a 24-hour watch on the tourists.

 ?We knew who they were. At least two of them stayed on every floor that we were on, in every hotel,? recalled Gouri Maitra, arthritic but an avid climber, who had gone along with husband Surendra Nath. ?The trouble started in Sukkur, when one of the women left on her own to go to Mohenjodaro. The ISI officials had become suspicious.?

 The one who got into maximum trouble was Rathin Chakraborty, an avid photographer and cameraman. 

 The Central Bank of India employee was in a spot more than a few times when he veered away to click and record images with one of his three cameras. ?They threatened me, saying if I didn?t do as I was told, they would either send me back or put me in jail. But even when I was rude to them, they were tolerant. It?s natural that they would be suspicious,? Chakraborty said.

 This might have been the first time, but certainly not the last of such trips across the border. The plan is to go on a trek of the K2 range in March.

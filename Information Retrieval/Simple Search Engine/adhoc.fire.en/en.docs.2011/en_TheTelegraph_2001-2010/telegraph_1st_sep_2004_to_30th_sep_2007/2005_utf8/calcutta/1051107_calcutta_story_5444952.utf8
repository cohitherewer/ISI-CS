 Showcase New Town in Paris 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 New Town, Bengal?s largest township under construction, spread across approximately 4,000 hectares at Rajarhat, will be introduced to European manufacturers, decision-makers of private companies and individuals at a seminar on November 8 in Paris.

 ?As is the case, New Town has already become a familiar name on the international circuit by virtue of its scale, infrastructure and location,? said Goutam Deb, state housing minister. 

 Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company, a joint venture between the government and Peerless group, which is currently constructing Axis, one of the country?s largest shopping malls (total space over five lakh sq ft), and DLF, which is building a sprawling IT hub and commercial complex, both at New Town, will participate in the seminar on the luxury market in India. 

 ?The government wants us to put across a strong image of New Town to corporate decision-makers, funds managers, consultants, marketing and export managers, who have already begun to show an interest in the township,? said Bengal Peerless managing director Kumar Shankar Bagchi, before leaving for Paris. 

 The seminar?s main focus will be sectors like perfumes and cosmetics, jewellery, leatherware, shoes, fashion accessories, tableware, textile, wines and spirits, gourmet products and hospitality.

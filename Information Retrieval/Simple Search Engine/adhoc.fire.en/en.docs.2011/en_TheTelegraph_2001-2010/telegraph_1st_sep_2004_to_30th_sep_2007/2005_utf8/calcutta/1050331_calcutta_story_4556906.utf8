 You share your birthday with...

 Ewan McGregor 

You?re fair and noble and will never cheat anyone to get your way. Once interested in something, you go all out to master it. You cherish your independence. You?re a great co-worker ? understanding, cooperative and efficient. You know how how to look good and live in style. You believe in the present rather than fretting about the future. ? Kusum Bhandari

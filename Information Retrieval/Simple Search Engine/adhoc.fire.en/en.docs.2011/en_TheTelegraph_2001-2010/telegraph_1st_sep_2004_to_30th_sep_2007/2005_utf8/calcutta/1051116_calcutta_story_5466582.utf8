 The appeal of woodwork is timeless and sleek shapes in wrought iron are just right to lend your home a modern minimalist look. But if you want to break out of the obvious and flaunt something totally new, add a dash of steel to your home interiors.

 And not just in the form of crockery and table-top accessories. You can give your home a total steely makeover, thanks to the wide range of options available in terms of furniture and home accessories. All you need to do is plan the desired look. 

 Traditionally, the kitchen was the only area of the house that witnessed a lot of steel. But tastes have changed and today people are into a lot of experimentation with their home interiors. So, one is seeing steel used in other areas of the house as well, says interior designer Anita Mansata.

 She, however, cautions: Just be careful that you dont end up giving your home a cold look, which might be possible with indiscriminate use of steel furniture.

 Make sure you mix and match the metal with the right colours on your walls, flattering upholstery and suitable light effects. GoodLife tells you how to steel a march.

 Living luxury

 A set of sofas with a matching centre table made of steel can render a stylish look to your living room.

 To add a dash of colour, place transparent coloured-glass vases on the table and throw in lots of fresh or artificial flowers. Deck up the rest of the room with wooden or terracotta planters and lots of dry flowers. Curtains in warm hues will complement the steely look, suggests interior designer Manjari Sahay.

 You can take your pick from the entire range of sofa sets and centre tables that the renovated Godrej showroom on Park Street has to offer. While the sofas come in combinations of leather and steel, thus retaining the comfort factor, the tables mix glass with the metal. The low-lying Virgo set teamed with a Milva table (that costs around Rs 76,804) can change the look of this home zone. 

 Bedroom buys

 The idea of using steel to do up your bedroom can surely conjure up cold images, but the new range of bedroom furniture available today will completely change your opinion, assures Partha Sarathy De, manager of the Godrej showroom housing steel furniture in all shapes and sizes.

 The Fiona bedroom range from the brand comprises a double bed, a sleek dressing unit and bedside tables, all in shades of blue. Quite contrary to the cold metallic look, modern steel furniture in vibrant hues lend a lot of colour to the interiors. You can do up the walls and curtains following the colour story for the complete effect, says Anita. 

 She recommends light indigo walls with white satin curtains to go with the Fiona range.

 And in case you have a thing for the elegant look of wood, the Vienna bedroom range comes with a wooden coating on the metal.

 Table talk

 According to interior designers, these are the two areas where you can play around the most with steel furniture and accessories.

 The metal scores very high with most designers for doing up the bar counter, simply for the sexy and stylish appeal of steel. 

 Says Manjari: I use a lot of steel to do up the artificial ceiling of the bar counter. It looks very stylish and goes well with the concept of the counter. Some neon lights, either embedded or hung from this ceiling, will give the place a very modern and funky look.

 When it comes to the dining room, one is spoilt for choice in dining table sets made of the metal, aesthetically combined with glass.

 However, while doing up this room with steel, you must concentrate on much more than the furniture to enliven the space. Like in the drawing area, keep a vase of flowers or the fruit basket on the dining table. The idea is to add colour to the otherwise dull effect of the furniture, muses Manjari. 

 She also recommends mild lighting in this zone in the form of soft coloured lamps.

 Dining table sets come in in various shapes and sizes. Choose from the six-seaters or the four-seater ones. 

 In the six-seater variety, the Reuss table can be teamed with the Edna chair in green. And if you want to go for something cosy, nothing can beat the Janice table that goes best with the Eleganza range of chairs. 

 Den decor

 And yes, you can also do up the den with steel furniture, without compromising in the least on the relaxed and comfortable look that this zone demands.

 A cosy and comfortable recliner in a combination of steel and leather can be just the piece to jazz up your private space. 

 Throw in loads of coloured cushions on them and your little corner is ready for you to laze around, says Anita.

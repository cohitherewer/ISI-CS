 Kidnap aide surrenders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mukesh Singh, one of the accused in the Roma Jhawar abduction case, surrendered to city police on Thursday. He was reportedly a witness to Arvind Bhai?s murder. 

 Singh handed himself over at Entally police station after absconding for three weeks. The officers of the police station immediately contacted investigators of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), who took him in custody. 

 ?Singh not only identified himself, but also said he was wanted by the CID for Roma?s abduction,? said an officer of Entally police station.

 ?The arrest was important because Singh was the only one who witnessed Arvind?s murder. His statement will help us prove that prime accused Gunjan Ghosh was the person who pulled the trigger on Arvind,? said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general (operations), CID.

 Detectives said that Singh was not present at the time of abduction on February 4.

 ?But he played a major role after Roma returned from Sodepur. Apart from providing the red-coloured Maruti Omni for Gunjan, Singh accompanied him from one to spot to another to collect the ransom. The Jhawar family paid the ransom in his presence at Phoolbagan,? said an officer.

 The police claimed that after receiving the money, Arvind was shot dead inside the Omni by Gunjan, in the presence of Singh.

 On Thursday, Gunjan?s voice was recorded in the presence of magistrate Bipasha Mondal of the Salt Lake sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court. Fingerprints of four of the accused ? Gunjan, driver Bikash Saha, security guard Damodar and Dasarath, the driver of Jhawars? neighbour ? were also collected.

Whither, our musical legacy

 Eye on Calcutta

Calcutta may lead in terms of the number of concerts, 

but most musicians have shifted base, affecting the quality of teaching here

it is in fact unexpected that a distant trading post 

established by British traders that became the commercial, administrative and 

finally, political capital of colonial India would build a lively musical tradition, 

particularly in Hindustani classical. The artistic heritage that came from Central 

Asia and prospered under the Mughals, was inspired by sufism, and fed on feudal 

patronage for centuries, found a surprising niche in what was the bastion of British 

capitalism in India. Of course, the British had very little to do with it, except 

in their sponsorship of a new feudal order through Cornwallis? Permanent Settlement. 

The zamindari system ? through which our imperial masters fine-tuned their 

exploitation of our land and our peasantry ? established an aura of prosperity, 

artistic patronage, and of course, decadence in the 19th century. So the great 

gharanas of Hindustani music, from as far as Peshawar and Patiala, were 

frequently represented by their leading maestros in the grand palaces of the Calcutta 

zamindars. Music and dance were not only enjoyed and treasured, but also understood. 

The depth of its assimilation into the city?s ethos became even more apparent 

when Nidhu Babu evolved a classical music idiom of Calcutta?s own called the toppa. 

Bengal?s music-loving people had earlier established its credentials in Hindustani 

music by establishing two gharanas at two ends of the state, at Gouripore 

in the northeastern end, and Bishnupur in the far west.

Logically, Hindustani music should have declined when 

the zemindars did, but surprisingly again, it did not. Feudal patronage was replaced 

by popularity with the middle class that was born out of industrialisation. Hindustani 

classical music continued to grow from its roots in the city even after Partition 

had propelled it overnight towards Indias greatest urban disaster. In fact 

its constituency grew significantly, from an elitist form indulged in the palaces 

of the rich to far more egalitarian ambience of what came to be known as music 

conferences.

Our city survived the Partition, its subsequent and 

sudden multiplication of population, its consequent breakdown of urban facilities, 

so did Hindustani classical music here. But the future is now becoming a matter 

of concern. Mass musical products seriously threaten its popularity with the younger 

generation. Its impresarios and promoters seem to be up against bigger obstacles 

every year to raise funds for Calcutta?s great soirees. 

The recently concluded Dover Lane Music Conference 

is still afloat, but there are many others that have run aground. Others not yet 

sunk continue their precarious existence, on the brink. Yet Calcutta still leads 

in the number of classical music conferences, and the audience in the district 

towns is growing. For every Sadarang or Tansen festival that closes down, new 

ones are being established, even if they are not always within city limits. It 

is certainly not time for despair, but definitely the time to take stock has arrived, 

the moment of reckoning for the future of Hindustani classical music in our beloved 

city is now. 

Hundred, even fifty, years ago, major performers had 

lived in this city, and taught generations of students here. Today, Delhi for 

instance, has claimed more and more of them, because that is where the sarkari 

cultural czars are located. The performer has had to move bag and baggage because 

of the bottom-line for survival. Even Los Angeles has more than its fair share 

of resident Hindustani music performers. You may reason that the place of an artiste?s 

residence is of little importance, but in a musical tradition that is handed down 

through parampara, the proximity of the guru and shishya is of paramount 

importance. Calcutta has certainly lost out on it. 

Yet the Calcutta audience has certainly not dwindled. 

But the time to reckon with the voices from the world of Hindustani music has 

come. Here are some ? There is a note of enthusiasm in the words of Ustad Amjad 

Ali Khan when he admits the audience is growing; and outstanding musicians are 

arriving on the scene from the southern States, Maharashtra and West Bengal. ?Indian 

musical traditions are safe for another 50 years at least,? believes the maestro. 

Even Shiv Kumar Sharma shares his faith in a growing audience, and reminds us 

that media and its technologies have made more music available to listeners. But 

even as TV and records have contributed greater exposure, he adds a note of caution 

about the erosion of traditions through the continuous import of Western popular 

music. Such notes of caution come from younger performers as well, like vocalist 

Kaushiki Chakraborty who wonders if the rise in audiences has been more ?quantitative, 

rather than qualitative?. Aficionado and organiser Vijay Kichlu?s fear, that larger 

audiences encourage musicians to ?perform what sells?, cannot be ignored. When 

music becomes a product, is classical music endangered? When Tanmoy Bose considers 

fusion to be inevitable, is his opinion in conflict with Rashid Khan who finds 

fusion a compromise? Some answers lie with us. But, of course, there are no final 

answers.

Whoever you speak to about the future of Hindustani 

music, from critics to performers, from impresarios to the cognoscenti, you will 

detect in their words a note of uncertainty, of anxiety, and even premonition 

of danger about the future. What exactly is it about? The first certainly is that 

with audiences, larger does not mean better. The second is the quality of instruction 

that is creating new musicians of tomorrow. The third is about patronage that 

will sustain a tradition that requires constant nurturing. The anxiety is obviously 

about elements that are endangered, from gurmukhi vidya to chintan, 

from parampara to sadhana. They are not just fancy words, but the 

pillars on which the entire structure of Hindustani classical music survives.

From leading maestros like Amjad Ali Khan or Shiv 

Kumar Sharma, to Amit Mukherjee, the present director of Calcutta?s Sangeet Research 

Academy, the anxiety over the quality of instruction to learners is shared intensely. 

They look to corporate houses, or the state, to sponsor and nurture young talent, 

like sportsmen are. But these are not usually visible contributions for they may 

or may not win the donor applause. Can we expect such selflessness from organisations, 

especially when they are accountable? Even young musicians like Ayaan Ali Bangash, 

who represents the best of both old and new, believes that musicians ?should have 

alternative means of income?, because ?recognition may or may not come?. Just 

as awards can be ambushed by the undeserving, opportunities can also be stolen 

by those who have greater social contacts and better negotiating skills. 

The need obviously is for a more benign ambience; 

where talent will be recognised and nurtured; where dedication will be honoured; 

where competitiveness will not disturb introspection; where the young will have 

the patience to learn; where the old will have the selflessness to teach; where 

great performers will not hurry from one concert to the next. The need obviously 

is for Utopia. Can Calcutta, can any city or any cultural environment, provide 

that? Yet the need remains.

 The army and police have warned that the Metro Railway is vulnerable to terrorist attacks and urged an immediate revamp of its surveillance system, prompting the authorities to consider a slew of measures, including maintaining a single entry-exit point at the stations.

 ?There have been suggestions from various quarters about beefing up security and we have received several proposals,? S.Z. Samuel, chief security commissioner of Metro, said on Tuesday. ?Once the festive season is over, we will start examining the proposals and draw up an elaborate plan.? 

 He added that the authorities would look into the proposal of keeping open only one exit-entry point at each station, though around three lakh people commute daily on the Metro. Immediately after the serial blasts on the London Underground in July, the Metro authorities had sealed nine entry and exit points at various stations. 

 Expressing concern over Metro?s ?fragile? security system, both army and police have proposed immediate remedial steps. At a recent liaison conference, General Officer Commanding (Bengal Area) Major-General Z.U. Shah said that in the absence of sophisticated surveillance and inter-department synergy, Metro was likely to be ?vulnerable to a copy-cat attack, like that in London, by terrorists?.

 The conference was attended by state principal secretary (home) Prasad Ranjan Roy, Metro officials, director-general of police S.C. Avasty, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and others. It also highlighted the threat of a Maoist attack. 

 The idea of keeping only one entry-exit point open at each station was mooted by the police commissioner. The perpetrators of the London Tube blasts were identified so early because of the superior surveillance infrastructure, he added. ?Such systems do not exist here. The communication network is also not very satisfactory at the stations.?

 To boost security, additional forces have been deployed in and around the stations. National Security Guard personnel, responsible for handling hostage crises or similar emergencies, regularly come to the city to train police and hold joint exercises with them.

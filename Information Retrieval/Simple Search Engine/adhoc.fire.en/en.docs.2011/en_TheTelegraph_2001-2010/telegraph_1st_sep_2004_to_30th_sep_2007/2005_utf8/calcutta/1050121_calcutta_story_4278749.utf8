 Cancer centre offer of counsel amp; care

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sabita Roy did not know what to do or who to turn to for advice when her husband was detected with cancer a month ago. After much difficulty, she finally managed to receive guidance from doctors of a cancer treatment centre. 

 Life was an ordeal for Arunabha Dastidar after doctors diagnosed him with bronchial cancer. He found it difficult to break the news to his aged parents and newly-wed wife.

 A counselling-cum-trauma care centre, inaugurated in Lake Town on Thursday, promises to lend a helping hand to several cancer patients like Roy and Dastidar to help overcome the mental shock and provide them with information about the disease. 

 Along with the patients, if necessary, the centre will also provide counselling to their family members to ward off depression.

 ?There had been a long-standing need for such a centre, as the number of cancer cases is on the rise. Once detected with the disease, patients develop a tendency to commit suicide,? explained Subir Ganguly, cancer specialist associated with the centre.

 Gandhi Seva Sangha, an NGO, has decided to join the cause. It proposes to construct a building where cancer patients, coming from remote areas to the Subodh Mitra Cancer Hospital for treatment, would be able to put up for a certain period at a nominal cost.

 ?While treating patients afflicted with cancer, we first try to look into the psychological agonies they suffer,? said Goutam Saha, secretary of the organisation.

 ?Often, patients have to stay for weeks or even a month or two for chemotherapy. It becomes difficult for them to go back home and come back to the city for treatment at regular intervals,? Saha added.

 ?To cater to such patients, our four-storeyed building, with two dormitories, will be readied within six months,? he elaborated. 

 Former minister Tapan Sikdar and Ramala Chakraborty, a member of the CPM?s North 24-Parganas district committee, attended the inauguration programme.

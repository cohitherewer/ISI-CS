 Death of a dreamer

 The futility of dreams and lofty ideals in todays materialistic, competitive world is the subject matter of Nandikars production, Feriwalaar Mrityu. The Bengali adaptation of Arthur Millers The Death of a Salesman, the play?s protagonist, Amalkanti, is an erstwhile smart and confident salesman, now reduced to a shadow of his former self. While selling dreams to others throughout his life, he had dreamt of happiness and contentment in his own life as well. But the unfortunate peddler of dreams did not know that life had other plans in store for him. Now old and infirm, he regrets the withering away of the way of life that was so dear to him. Wistfully dreaming of the happy days of the past, he refuses to acknowledge the harsh reality of his present, and continues to labour under false hopes of better days ahead. His pride prevents him from reaching out to his near and dear ones, and he further retreats into a shell of loneliness. Finally, he seeks refuge in death. Direction: Rudraprasad Sengupta.

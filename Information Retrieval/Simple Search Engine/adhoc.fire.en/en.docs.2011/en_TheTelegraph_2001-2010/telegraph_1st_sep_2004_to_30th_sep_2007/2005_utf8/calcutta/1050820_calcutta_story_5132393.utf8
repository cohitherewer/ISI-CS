The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Free-to-air popular fare

 - Put off by escalating cable bill, viewers opt for cheaper beam

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Tired of mounting cable subscriptions and happy with couch life without the K-series tear-jerkers or Wayne Rooney?s runs? The free-to-air beam could be the alternative.

 Cable operators around town are offering a clutch of free-to-beam channels ? anything between 55 and 65 ? at prices ranging from zero to less than Rs 100.

 The local innovation of lowering cost to consumer by offering channels of choice comes with the high-profile conditional access system (CAS) proving a non-starter. It also allows the last-mile operator to retain connectivity with households reluctant to cough up rising cable rates.

 In Salt Lake, Link-Men Services started its free-to-air service this month, offering 65 channels at Rs 85 to the township and adjacent areas.

 ?There is a section of television viewers that does not want to pay Rs 240 per month,? says Rana Das of Link-Men Services, which connects most of Salt Lake. ?They have to do with only the Doordarshan channels if they give up their cable connection. This service is for them.?

 Latest movies, soaps, kids and prime sports content are not on board. But news (from STAR News to BBC), regional programmes (from ETV to Aakash) and Hindi entertainment (from STAR Utsav to Sahara One) make the free-channel option worth a watch for many.

 ?The popularity of Bengali channels is a big factor, since there is a great demand among viewers for regional content. It helps that all Bengali channels, except Zee Bangla, are free-to-air,? says an operator.

 NFL, another service provider operating in areas like Paikpara, Dum Dum and Shyambazar, has seen around 1,000 consumers opt for the cheaper alternative so far.

 ?Operators cannot bring the pay channel rates down, because that is in the broadcasters? hands. As a result, operators lose connectivity by having to disconnect those consumers who can?t pay more,? says NFL?s Alok Jana.

 To popularise the service, 16 of NFL?s 34 operators are offering it for free, initially.

 For Srishti, which covers Behala, Kidderpore, Joka and Amtala, the consumer profile is the main reason for starting the low-cost service. 

 ?A significant number of viewers is unable to pay Rs 100 per month,? offers Srishti?s Raj Narayan Roy Chowdhury. The platter of 55 channels at Rs 50 has already found around 2,000 takers, he claims.

 The one headache for pay channel broadcasters: free-to-air networks slipping in a pay channel or two under popular pressure. Say, when Team India takes the field.

 On wings of poetry

 Poetry, the most spontaneous form of self-expression, has the power to touch our hearts and evoke powerful emotions within our souls. Directed by Bijoylakshmi Barman, this evening?s programme of recitation of Bengali poetry by the members of Sisikshu, promises to be a delightful experience for audience of all ages. Chharay Chharay, the first half of the program, has children reciting popular rhymes and funny story-poems by various poets. They also recite the perennial children?s favourite, Abanindranath Tagore?s verse-drama, Kshirer Putul. The second part, Aamader Dibaratri, comprises a session of poetry recitation. Written by well-known poets, ranging from Tagore to poets of the present generation, they dwell on themes including life, nature and complexity of human relationships. The programme concludes with an audio-play based on an innovative adaptation of Tagore?s Totakahini.

 Blood on the road again

 - Motorcyclist killed at dawn at Park Circus peril point

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Feroz Khan: Thrown off two-wheeler

 A day after a young woman got crushed under the wheels of a bus on AJC Bose Road, a 27-year-old motorcyclist fell to another death trap ? bridge no. 4 in Park Circus.

 Around 5.20 am on Friday, Feroz Khan, a garment trader, was headed for his Ekbalpore residence after dropping off his cousin at the airport. 

 Amjad Khan is a security officer with a private airline, and Feroz used to give him a ride to the airport regularly.

 According to witnesses and police, Feroz was riding towards the Park Circus seven-point crossing. As he approached the end of the bridge, an unidentified vehicle, possibly coming from behind, hit the motorcycle, throwing Feroz off it.

 ?It was slightly foggy around 5.30 am. While passing by, I spotted a man lying in a pool of blood on the road and a smashed motorcycle next to him. A few policemen had gathered on the spot by then. I realised it was yet another accident on this deadly stretch. I have seen so many of them,? recounted Kader Gazi, who owns a shop in the area and also lives nearby.

 Police said people in a passing car witnessed the accident and informed Karaya police station over the phone. Police rushed to the spot and took Feroz to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

 A visiting card of Feroz?s brother-in-law Shamsuzzaman, a resident of Free School Street, was found in his pocket. Police called him and informed him that Feroz had been injured in a mishap. 

 Aslam, Feroz?s brother, said: ?My brother had left home as usual around 4.30 am. Everyone else in the house was sleeping then. Around 6.30 am, Shamsuzzaman called us and said Feroz had met with an accident. On reaching the hospital, we were told that he was no more.?

 Feroz?s 70-year-old father, Sultan Khan, sobbed: ?I had told him to be careful, as vehicles travel recklessly early in the morning. But this was fated...?

 Wife Mumtaz had locked herself in a room with some relatives. Their four-year-old son Sohail was yet to realise why so many people had gathered in his house.

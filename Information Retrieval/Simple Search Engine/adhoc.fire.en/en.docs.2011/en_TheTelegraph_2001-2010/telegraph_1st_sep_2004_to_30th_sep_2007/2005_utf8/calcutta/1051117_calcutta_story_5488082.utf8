 Digging out Diggory

 Mr Right: Robert Pattinson plays Cedric 

Diggory in the new Potter film 

 In our countdown to Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, let?s finally meet Robert Pattinson who joins as Cedric Diggory, Head Boy and Hogwarts? official representative in the Triwizard Tournament in which he is joined, in a last-minute mysterious addition, by Harry himself.

 Interestingly, Robert would love to be in the shoes of Harry rather than play Cedric. ?I think it?s a really intricate, amazing part,? he says. ?Also, you don?t really have the opportunity to be guaranteed seven films when you?re growing up. And I think Daniel?s (Radcliffe) doing an amazing job. I can see him persevering and developing as an actor and as a person.?

 And what about Cedric, the role he plays? ?He?s one of those guys who always wants to do the right thing, but not in an annoying way,? Robert explains. ?It?s impossible to hate him, I think. He?s good at sports and athletics. He vaguely takes Harry under his wing and they get closer as the film draws to a close.?

 Like the other new cast members of Potter IV, Robert got the role by chance. ?I knew the costume directors from another movie, The Ring of the Nibelungs, a German film,? recalls Robert. ?And they wanted to see me for this part. But I was doing another movie over the casting period. Mary Selway and Fiona Weir were casting at the time, before anyone else was seen for casting. I went to do this other movie, and then the day I came back, I got it.?

 Robert hadn?t read the Potter books till he got the role. ?I read the fourth one just before my audition,? he admits. ?And read it in like a day or something. It changed my whole opinion about the whole series.?

 So there he was, all charged up to do all the stunt sequences for the movie. ?The maze stuff was really, really fun to do,? Robert says. ?It was so real. And because it was all hydraulic walls, no one actually knew if it would kill you or not, if you actually got trapped there. So, it was quite nice to be doing enforced method acting.?

 Also fun is the way Robert?s suddenly become a star. ?It?s really funny,? he laughs. ?Because I finished school, I?m not really doing anything at the moment. I was just aimlessly wandering around London, and these two guys who were about 30 or something came up and asked for my autograph. I was really quite proud at the time and did it, and they took photos and stuff. They were sort of wandering around, and I was wandering around, and I bumped into them like three times. And every single time their respect for me was just growing!?

 Slums lock 10,000 acres of prime land 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 At a time the development boom in the city is taking a fast toll on its land, around 10,000 acres of slum land in prime pockets are lying locked because of their peculiar legal status.

 Following the enactment of the Thika Tenancy Act, 1981, neither the state government nor the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has been able to take any meaningful step to develop the slum areas. 

 Reason: the Act does not bestow the title of right to the precious acres on any individual or organisation.

 A survey reveals that the shantytowns ? comprising 10,000 bighas of thika land ? are spread over Judges? Court Road, Gariahat Road, Alipore Road, Bhowanipore, Sealdah, Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, Kalighat, New Alipore and Kidderpore. 

 Officials of the government and the civic body have put their heads together to discuss how to free the plots and build housing estates for the middle and upper-middle classes on them. 

 The proceeds from developing the land would be used for arranging alternative accommodation for the over five lakh families occupying the prime plots.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has proposed that the government acquire the thika land against a token compensation, just as it had acquired the Calcutta Tramways Company and Westinghouse Saxby Farmer more than 25 years ago. 

 ?There are two options ? the state government acquire the plots either for itself or for the Corporation,? Mukherjee told Metro.

 According to the civic body?s deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh, the Thika Tenancy Act has vested in the controller of thika tenancy all leasehold land and kutcha structures, with a lease period beyond December 1981.

 The state government became the ?superior landlord? for all slums. Most slum-dwellers are tenants and they deposit their rent with the controller of thika tenancy.

 ?It is a peculiar situation. The state government is the superior landlord without holding title rights,? pointed out Ghosh.

 According to the CMC Act, construction on a plot of land can be sanctioned only in the favour of the title-holder. 

 Hence, until the state government or the CMC acquires the slum land, it will be difficult to sanction any proposed construction on it.

 Taking advantage of the impasse, a section of promoters is minting money by constructing illegal highrises on the shanty plots. The structures, according to experts, are nothing but four or five-storeyed slums. 

 ?The slums are unfit for habitation. They are too overcrowded, the roads are too narrow and ventilation and sanitation facilities are almost non-existent,? said mayoral council member (slum development) Javed Ahmed Khan.

 He pointed out that the national average of the urban slum population has grown by 21.3 per cent, against the total population, between 1981 and 1991. In Calcutta, the growth has been a staggering 31.8 per cent.

 Reacting to the joint move for the development of the slum land, Calcutta Bustee Federation joint secretary Mohammad Nizamuddin said: ?We have no objection if development is carried out without evicting the slum-dwellers.?

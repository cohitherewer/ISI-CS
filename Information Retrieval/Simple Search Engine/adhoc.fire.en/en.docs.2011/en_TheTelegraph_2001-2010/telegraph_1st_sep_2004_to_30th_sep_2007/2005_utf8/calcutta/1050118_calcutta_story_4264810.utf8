The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Takeover snag hits airport link road

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 The much-awaited link road project between Salt Lake and the airport has hit a land acquisition speed-breaker. 

 The Rs 7-crore project is to be completed by March 31, but the state government said on Monday that land acquisition snags could delay the project.

 Although land has been acquired from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and a private company, there are still a few barriers in the way of widening the three-lane road into a six-lane one. 

 ?There are still some constructions on the stretch, including a cooperative housing estate, that will have to be removed,? state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya told Metro.

 ?So, we have simultaneously taken up the repair and widening of the existing link road, which will lead to the airport through Rajarhat New Town,? Bhattacharya said. 

 ?The existing road will be widened soon but the new stretch may miss the deadline,? he added.

 Work on the stretch ? from the CSTC bus terminus near the entry point of Sector V, through Rajarhat New Town and on to VIP Road at Kaikhali, two km from the airport ? has been taken up by Hidco and the CMDA.

 Hidco officials said 95 per cent of the land acquisition formalities have been sorted out and lakhs of rupees paid to the original owners. 

 But the CMDA claims the land has not been handed over to it yet.

 ?We have shared 50 per cent of the cost outside the project area and paid large sums as shifting charges to the companies and organisations whose land was blocking the extension work,? Sumantra Chowdhury, managing director, Hidco, said on Monday.

 According to him, Rs 45 lakh was paid to the CRPF and another Rs 80 lakh to a private company. These two plots were the major obstacles in extending the link road.

 ?This is a priority project and work on three lanes is progressing smoothly. However, for extending the stretch to six lanes, the land acquired needs to be handed over to us immediately,? asserted a senior CMDA official. 

 The proposal envisages a six-lane road, about 955 m in length, of which 530 m will involve widening a 15-m-wide existing road and the remaining 425 m will be new. 

 The earlier plan, rejected because of the cost factor (Rs 36 crore), was for a four-lane elevated road of about one km, including the approaches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 In demand: Diane Kruger

 German-born actress Diane Kruger says she hates being described as the new ?It? girl. ?It?s a silly label,? says the no-nonsense, shockingly beautiful blonde. Kruger beat hundreds of rivals for the part of Helen in Wolfgang Petersen?s epic Troy, alongside Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. 

 Now she is back for a starring role opposite Nicolas Cage in Jerry Bruckheimer?s new film, National Treasure, releasing this Friday at city multiplexes. Kruger plays the cool Dr Abigail Chase, a conservator at Washington D.C.?s National Archives, who is Cage?s unwilling accomplice in a heist. Here?s what the actress has to say about the film.

 Was it nerve-wracking the first day on the set with Nicolas Cage or did he put you at ease?

 The screen test was very nerve-wracking. I mean, I am about to go on-camera with Nicolas Cage! I was very starstruck.

 Jerry Bruckheimer has said that Nic Cage was intimidated by you. Any thoughts on that?

 I wish it were true. I mean, me intimidating someone? That?s a first! I think what happened was that I was really and genuinely very starstruck. For a start, I didn?t know I was going to get the part because at least two other girls were testing for the movie at the same time.

 And I think I?ve seen every single film Nic?s ever been in. It?s only three years ago that I just started drama school and Adaptation was out and, here I was, two years later in Hollywood screen-testing with Nicolas Cage. It was a very surreal situation and I was terrified he would think I?m a terrible actress. So I couldn?t even look him in the eye and I was sort of a little stand-offish just because I wanted to make sure I didn?t screw up my screen test. So maybe, he thought I was odd or something, I don?t know.

 The plot of National Treasure revolves around Nic Cage?s character stealing the Declaration of Independence. Did you have to mug up on American history before the film began shooting?

 Yes, absolutely. I?d never even been to Washington or Philadelphia before, both of them key locations for the film, so I did a lot of reading. On the other hand, I?d lived in New York and most of my friends are American, and so going to Washington and going to see the actual Declaration Of Independence really moved me. In a way, I suppose, I feel like I?m a little bit American as well as German.

Were you happy modelling before getting into acting?

 Well, it?s certainly not intellectually very challenging. But it was really a great job to have as a young girl because it allowed me to live in Paris and then New York. I learned fluent French. And modelling gave me financial independence at a very young age, which put me through drama school when I finally decided to become an actor. That was a great luxury, not to have to work on the side while I was at drama school. So, I really only have good things to say about modelling, thought it?s obviously not something that I ever want to go back to.

 But didn?t you just sign to be the new face of Lancome?

 Yes, but that?s not modelling like having to strut the catwalk and do photo shoots six times a week. To be honest, there?s a lot of money to be made being a sort of spokesperson or face of a particular brand. You know, it?s not like I make 20 million dollars a movie at this point and, let?s face it, I might never even get close.

 You?re replacing Uma Thurman at Lanc?me. Do you know how she feels about that?

 Well, she replaced Isabella Rossellini at Lancome and now Uma is going to do Louis Vuitton, so it?s like we just switch around. It?s the way of the world.

 Is it true that you originally were going to be a ballet dancer till an injury ended your career?

 I think that?s been written about a little more dramatically than it actually was. Yes, I did have an injury and I was out for a couple of months, but I?m sure I could have continued afterwards. It?s just that there was a moment when, you know, I was 13 going on 14 and I had danced for 11 years, and I found myself wondering, do I really have the guts to do this because it?s a tough world to be in for very little reward... And I certainly wasn?t sure if I had the talent to become a prima ballerina.

 So did your ballet experience help you with any of the stunts you did in the movie?

 Well, that is me hanging out of the door of a speeding truck in the movie, though obviously the stunt lady did all the really dangerous stuff. But I still got banged up a lot and trust me, I will not be the next Lara Croft! I had enough after one week. I was, like, ?get me out of this harness?!

 You?ve had so much success in such a short time, Troy and now National Treasure all in the same year. How do you feel about being Hollywood?s new ?It? girl?

 I think it?s a silly expression! What does that mean, the new ?It? girl? First of all, there are one hundred girls behind me waiting for their big break too, so I won?t be ?It? for long. And it?s not like I came here pursuing a career. It just happened and I just want to do the work. I mean, I don?t care if I?m cool or hip or whatever.

 So there?s no upside to being talked about so much and being on the cover of so many magazines?

 Well, I?m obviously in a good position right now because people want to meet me and want to see if I can actually act or deliver the goods. But it?s also really a dangerous thing because ?It? girls can very quickly become has-beens. But it?s not like I even feel like I?m famous or even close to that. I mean, it?s not like I can?t walk down the street anymore and I don?t really seem to get invited to fabulous Hollywood parties, so nothing much has changed as far as I can see!

 How about at home in Germany? Very few German actresses have ever broken through in Hollywood, so surely you?re a national hero by now?

 That?s what my mom says! But I don?t know. It?s a little surreal to me. And it?s not like my ambition in life is to be a superstar. All I want is to act, you know, whether that means doing theatre in Poland or getting a great part in an Italian film.

But you must notice some reaction when you go home...

 Well, yes, there?s a lot of attention directed towards me right now in Germany and I have been given a few awards, which is nice. I got something called the Women?s World Award and I got an award in Cannes for breakthrough talent. And I?m getting a Bambi Award later this year in Germany and that?s like the German Oscar in a way. Also, it?s a cute award because it looks like a baby deer, so it will be nice on my bookshelf!

 So what else do you have coming up?

 I?m doing a movie right now in Romania, a European film called Merry Christmas. It?s a true story about World War I and how on Christmas Eve one year soldiers on both sides laid down their weapons and buried their dead and then played football together. I play a German opera singer. Next year I?m hoping to do a film with Ed Harris called Copying Beethoven.

 And just to get back to National Treasure, the film is already being tipped to be a big hit in the US. Do you think the rest of the world will like the film as well?

 We all know that right now America has a very particular, maybe delicate, position in the rest of the world. But I think National Treasure will travel very well because it celebrates the whole idea of national pride and not just American patriotism. It?s also very exciting, very funny and Nicolas Cage is in it. What?s not to like?

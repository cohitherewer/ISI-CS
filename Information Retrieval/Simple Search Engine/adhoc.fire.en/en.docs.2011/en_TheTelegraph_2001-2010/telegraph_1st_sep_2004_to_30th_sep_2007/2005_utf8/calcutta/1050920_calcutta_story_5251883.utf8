 The Science City auditorium was packed, the stage was set and adrenaline was running riot backstage.

 The brisk Friday evening downpour had failed to dampen competitive spirits at the Calcutta finale of Westside Lux Body Wash Style Showdown.

 Dressed in their hottest gladrags, students from eight city colleges were raring to impress the judges ? ex-model and choreographer Achala Sachdev and MTV VJ Ranvijay Singh.

 The contest was a Westside endeavour to give fashion and fun a new platform. The mega youth bash open to students from eight cities ? Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Bangalore, Indore, Hyderabad and Calcutta ? was designed to identify the best and budding talents in the fields of fashion, modelling, make-up and choreography. 

 Calcutta saw an overwhelming response with 20 leading colleges of the city vying in the preliminary rounds held at the Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society college auditorium on September 8.

 Some of the colleges and institutes that took part were South City College, Wigan and Leigh, Birla School of Management, Charu Chandra College, International School of Business, Jadavpur University and Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society. 

 Of the 20 competing colleges, the eight that made the cut were Rani Birla, Wigan and Leigh, Ashutosh College, National Institute of Fashion Technology, Indian Institute of Hotel Management, National Institute of Technical Sciences, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society and Air Hostess Academy.

 Participants were evaluated on the basis of their style quotient, choreography of the show, choice of music, hair and make-up, and presentation. But the crucial factor seemed to be attitude. With a little practise and guidance, you can master the other arts. But attitude and body language are things you cant inculcate. So, we will keep a close watch on how the participants carry themselves and how confident they are, said Achala.

 Each college selected a category of ensembles for the catwalk ? casual wear, club wear, sports wear and denims. 

 The enthusiasm is infectious. I was here for the rehearsals in the afternoon and the place was throbbing with excitement, she said. 

 Looking just right for the ramp herself, in brown top and white skirt, she gushed: I have been to so many cities, but the atmosphere in Calcutta is electrifying. The teenagers here seem to be very conscious about their face, figure and fitness. The colleges and institutes should be lauded for having their students participate in this contest. 

 MTV VJ Ranvijay Singh, a centre of attraction all evening, said: MTV tries to connect with the stylish and free-spirited youth. The contest would help unearth such talent.

 After a fierce ramp war, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society took home the Rs 25,000 prize money.

 Pressure shuts open policy on car parks

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic body on Tuesday decided to keep in abeyance its new policy of distributing parking lots through open tender, signalling a surrender to pressure from a section of the Trinamul Congress as well as the CPM.

 ?There?s no point denying that pressure has been exerted on us so we abandon our plan to streamline the car-parking business,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 ?Some Trinamul and CPM leaders want to perpetuate the present system,? said officer-on-special duty Shaktibrata Ghosh. ?And that is why we are so keen on bringing competition into the business.?

 While CPM chief whip Rabin Deb demanded that the entire policy be scrapped, mayoral council member Pradip Ghosh said: ?The open tender policy will have to be resisted, because it will lead to roadspace being handed over to big business houses.? 

 Deb and Ghosh, poles apart in politics, joined hands on Tuesday to denounce the mayor?s move as a blow to the cooperative movement.

 ?Members of various cooperatives have met Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjee and she promptly directed the mayor not to proceed with his open tender policy,? announced mayoral council member Ghosh.

 The mayor, however, has found a friend in the Parking Samabay Bachao Committee (Karmahin). 

 The committee, in a mass petition, congratulated Mukherjee for deciding to allot parking lots through open tender.

 Jagadish Chaudhury, who runs the Associated Cooperative Car Parking Society, alleged that most of the 14 cooperatives that are managing around 50 parking zones are nothing but benami business of a section of political leaders, including councillors.

 According to some signatories to the petition, the demand-supply gulf has made parking (legal and illegal) a lucrative business in the city. 

 Of the annual turnover of Rs 30 crore, the civic coffers receive hardly Rs 5 crore, they alleged.

 Chaudhury claimed that two years ago, a member of the Trinamul-run civic board had taken Rs 15 lakh from some cooperatives for allotting parking lots. The money was meant for constructing an old-age home, for which even a plot had been earmarked. 

 ?But the plot is still vacant and the money has been used for other purposes,? Chaudhury said. ?It?s clear why political leaders are hell-bent on thwarting the mayor?s move.? 

 Mayor Mukherjee, on his part, pointed out the alleged irregularities to justify his decision to ?look into the parking matter? himself. 

 Moving over to other aspects of his proposal, he said he would prefer a graded fee structure ? like in London ? for parking. If the normal fee is Rs 2 for the first hour, the mayor feels it should be Rs 20 in the central business district.

 The scarcity of parking space, Mukherjee said, is not unique to Calcutta. Even cities like New York, London, Paris and Tokyo suffer from the problem. 

 Citing London?s example, he said that despite developing high-tech parking facilities, the city has to introduce differential rates to check the number of cars in the central London area.

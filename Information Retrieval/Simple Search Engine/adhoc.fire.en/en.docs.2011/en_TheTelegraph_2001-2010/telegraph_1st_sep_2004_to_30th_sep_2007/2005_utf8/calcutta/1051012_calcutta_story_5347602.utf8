Its almost over now, leaving you with the feeling 

that the fun had just begun. Youve sailed through the past two days ? pandal-hopping, 

unending adda sessions and chilling out with friends ? but long before youve 

had your fill of fun, Puja 2005 is on its way out.

If its time now to bid adieu to the goddess, 

you must do it in real style. And theres just one fashion statement befitting 

the festive finale ? deck up in your traditional best.

For Goodlife, designers Sharbari Dutta and 

Sunipa Samadder dress up models Michael and Bidita in ethnic finery for Dashami. 

Make-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar creates the look for the last day of the Puja.

Her

 As we move from Navami to Dashami, all within a Wednesday, 

Sunipa drapes Bidita in a sari that suits the flavour of the Navami arati 

as much as it gels with the sindoor khela look.

This is an occasion when a Bengali woman wants 

to flaunt her feminity to the fullest. Keeping that in mind, Ive given Bidita 

a red sari paired with a cream and gold corset, to be in rhythm with the ethnic 

Bengali colour story, says Sunipa.

The red crepe tissue sari is adorned with hand-crafted 

tissue flowers embellished with loose sequins and stones, and attached with cut-work. 

The sari draws inspiration from floating flowers. 

I visualised the pious look when we float flowers on the Ganges. With every stride 

and movement the sequins and stones shimmer like the reflection of light in water. 

And so, the sari is apt for such traditional celebrations, explains the 

designer.

The sari, draped in the traditional Bengali way, has 

been accessorised with gold jewellery, with a bunch of red and white bangles on 

one hand.

In keeping with the spirit of the occasion, Aniruddha 

has given Bidita a very traditional look, complete with the sindoor and 

a big red bindi.

The eyes have been done up with gold-copper eye shadow 

on the socket, black shadow in an extended pattern, lots of thick kohl on upper 

and lower lid with extended ends and mascara on the lashes.

 Soft brown blush-on has been highlighted with gold. 

The lips wear a natural brown with gold gloss. Biditas hair has been done 

up in a big, traditional bun.

Him

 The occasion demands men to get out of their westerns 

and flaunt the traditional Bangali look for the day.

For Michael, a bright red silk dhoti embroidered 

in black with a matching uttariya has been paired with a tussar angarakha 

with copper zari embroidery.

This particular style of silk dhoti is 

the traditional wear in the temples of Sambalpur in Orissa. It comes with the 

matching uttariya and lends a rich and opulent look that goes very well 

with the festive spirit of Dashami. Its very traditional and yet very gorgeous, 

reveals Sharbari.

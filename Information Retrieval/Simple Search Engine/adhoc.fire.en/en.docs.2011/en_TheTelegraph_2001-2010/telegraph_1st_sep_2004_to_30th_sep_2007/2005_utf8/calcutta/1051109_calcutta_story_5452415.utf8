The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rebel banners in cable trade

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 A group of cable operators gherao the regional office of a national satellite channel distributor. Police intervene and disperse the crowd. They come back the next day. Signs of fresh trouble brewing in the local cable industry, and possibly more worries for the viewer.

 Around 30 operators from an upcoming multi-system operator (MSO) in the Baguiati-Dum Dum area, Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Pariseba, demonstrated on Monday and Tuesday at the Hazra Road office of SET Discovery, which distributes channels like Sony, Discover and Ten Sports.

 The operators, comprising breakaway cablemen from other city MSOs, alleged that the distributor was not providing them with the signal under pressure from existing MSOs.

 ?We have already invested Rs 70 lakh and were supposed to launch operations in September. But the broadcasters, particularly SET Discovery, are not cooperating,? complained Mrinal Chatterjee, one of the promoters of the new MSO.

 ?We have not refused to provide the channels,? clarified a spokesperson for SET Discovery. ?There is a formal procedure that needs to be followed and it can take time.?

 Market-watchers, however, warn that more such conflicts are due, as other breakaway operator groups firm up plans to form their own MSOs and force broadcasters to provide them with the beams.

 ?Our equipment is in place, and we hope to start services by December,? said Apurba Banerjee, one of the promoters of Metro Broadband Services, which is setting up operations on SN Banerjee Road. 

 According to Banerjee, at least 350 to 400 operators across the city, parts of North 24-Parganas and Hooghly would join him. ?We want to prevent the market from becoming the monopoly of one MSO,? he added.

 Srishti, which dominates the Behala and Thakurpukur area, is also moving out of the MSO it is under. ?Work is on at our new location in Taratala. We should be ready to start before the next financial year,? said an official.

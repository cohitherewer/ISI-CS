 - WORLD STROKE DAY ALERT

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 With more and more Calcuttans falling prey to stroke, the Indian Council of Medical Research announced on the eve of World Stroke Day on Friday that its study on such cases in the city would continue for another three years.

 The survey over the past three years ? conducted by experts from Bangur Institute of Neurology (BIN), National Neurosciences Centre (NNC), Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) and other agencies ? revealed that stroke cases have been rising sharply in Calcutta.

 ?The findings have been startling. The prevalence rate has been around 788 per lakh people. It is much more than what we had anticipated,? said Tapas Kumar Banerjee, head of the NNC neuro-medicine department and a key member of the study team.

 The study, which covered over 50,000 people from across the city, revealed that 145 stroke cases per lakh people are reported every year in Calcutta. Of the patients, 112 per lakh people are first-time victims.

 ?During the survey, we found that high blood pressure was the principal factor for stroke,? said BIN neurologist Shyamal Das, who was also associated with the study.

 Apart from blood pressure, hypertension, mental stress, physical inactivity, smoking and obesity, too, are responsible for the rise in stroke cases. Some ?non-modifiable factors?, like old age, family history and hidden cerebral vascular anomaly, have been identified as the other contributing factors.

 Following the World Health Organisation?s prediction that all developing countries would face a stroke epidemic by 2020 if the risk factors are not controlled, doctors are focussing on effective management of the attack through rehabilitation.

 ?Those who?ve had a stroke must know how to prevent further attacks. Most victims face a second or third attack within seven years. All modifiable risk factors ? such as mental stress and high blood pressure ? should be controlled vigorously,? said M.M. Ghatak, chief consultant at Medical Rehabilitation Centre (MRC) and TRA Hospital, Calcutta.

 MRC on Friday will inaugurate a clinic, where doctors, apart from treating victims, will prescribe preventive measures for those who have the symptoms of stroke.

 Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, too, is coming up with a stroke-cum-neurological rehabilitation camp. ?The way the incidence of stroke has been rising in the city, we have no option but to focus on complete rehabilitation of victims,? said neurosurgeon Amitava Ghosh.

 Doctors suggest that rehabilitation should ideally be undertaken within 40 days of an attack. Rehabilitation entails teamwork involving experts from various branches of medicine.

 Indoor rehabilitation is a priority these days, as victims gain psychological confidence and improve their functional capabilities within days of an attack. ?Our new clinic will focus on all aspects of improving the quality of life of stroke patients,? added Ghosh.

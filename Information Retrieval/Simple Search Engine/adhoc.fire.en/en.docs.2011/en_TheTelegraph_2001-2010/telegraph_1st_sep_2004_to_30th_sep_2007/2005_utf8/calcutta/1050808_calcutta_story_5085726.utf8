The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Slum fund siphon for colonies

 JAVED AHMED KHAN, Trinamul Congress leader of the Opposition in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph at Calcutta Boating Club and Resort to answer their queries. Participants included Sadhan Banerjee, Sourish Misra, Sahabuddin, Ashok Hore, Sahid Mondol, Shyamal Misra, Tariq Z. Siddiqui, Tapan Mukherjee, Sk. Arif Ali, Aftab Rahim, Abdul Rafiq, Bharat Chandra Dalui, Akhtar Ali Wasi, Mehmood Akhtar, Md. Dastagir, Md. Reyan, Bharati Das and Noor Alam

Tapan Mukherjee: As mayoral council member (slum development) you had stopped funding development activities in the colony areas. Why? Doesn?t the department of bustee have anything to do with the colonies?

 Since slum dwellers are economically and educationally backward and not conscious of their rights, over the past 25 years or so, more than 80 per cent of the funds allotted for slum development had been siphoned off for the betterment of colonies. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, however, did not like my move of stopping the practice.

 It is not the responsibility of the bustee development department to develop colonies. Slum lands belong to the Controller of Thika Tenancy of the state government. Hence, slum dwellers are tenants, while settlers in the colonies are land owners. How can public money be spent for the development of private space?

Bharati Das: If it is illegal to foot the bill for colony development from funds for bustees, how did the CPM-led board allow it?

 The auditors were not aware of the difference between colonies and slums or bustees. More importantly, though the CPM regards slum dwellers as their vote bank, the colonies are the cradle of their leadership. Since a good number of the Left party councillors and mayoral council members are from the colonies, they concentrated more on the development of their home turf.

Sourish Misra: You have been accused of grabbing Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) land by CPM leader Kanti Ganguly and even by your mayor Subrata Mukherjee. What steps have you taken to prove that you are not guilty of the charge? 

 When I refused to join the CPM after winning the civic elections in 1990 as an Independent candidate, its members started a slander campaign against me. The party is a sincere follower of Goeble in misleading common people. 

 I would like to point out that in 1984, the CMC had filed a suit against me and was defeated in the court of law. Again in 1993, a case was filed against me over title right. The CMC took the side of the applicant, but the court ordered in favour of me in 2004. Subrata Mukherjee had left no stone unturned to prove that the plot of land on which the Trinamul Congress party office stands belongs to the CMC, but failed. 

Sahid Mondol: The court has ordered the CMC to clear the pavements of eight city roads from all encroachments. What?s your stand?

 We think evicting all hawkers is politically impractical in Calcutta. We are in favour of controlling hawkers instead of evicting them. If the present board forces hawkers to confine their business to one-third of the pavements, we have nothing to say.

Md. Dastagir: Do you want the CPM to violate the high court order?

 Not at all. Operation Sunshine was not carried out on the order of a court. I will request you to recall the CPM?s role when Justice Amitava Lala restricted processions on the city roads. Also, doesn?t the residential-cum-market complex on 174, CR Avenue stand in violation of the Supreme Court?s order?

Akhtar Ali Wasi: There had been no recruitment in the CMC during your tenure. Over 1,300 posts are vacant. What will be your stand as leader of the opposition?

 As the CPM board had turned the CMC into a sanctuary for party cadres, the civic body was heavily over-staffed when we took over. If 1,300 vacancies exist then it means that our board successfully ran the CMC with a shortfall of that many staff. However, some more people are required in the conservancy and the parks and gardens department.

 Concluded

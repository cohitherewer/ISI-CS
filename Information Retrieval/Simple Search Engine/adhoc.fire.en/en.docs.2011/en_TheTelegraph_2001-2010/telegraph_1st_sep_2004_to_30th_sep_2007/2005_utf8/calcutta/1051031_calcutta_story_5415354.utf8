 Scrutiny spurs spruce-up

 - Recognition at stake, medical colleges rush to plug loopholes

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 Some lack enough teachers, some do not have a morgue. One has no hostel for students, while all have failed to build a ?proper auditorium?.

 Not one teaching hospital in the city can claim to have complied with the norms of Medical Council of India, the apex body in healthcare.

 The council will inspect four medical colleges in November, and the state government, fearing derecognition, has gone into a tizzy. To pre-empt any extreme move, it has started plugging loopholes on a war footing. 

 Sanctioning new posts and filling up vacant ones are two of the initiatives undertaken to save National Medical College, NRS Medical College, RG Kar Medical College and Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (at SSKM Hospital) from possible derecognition. 

 The fifth teaching hospital in the city, Medical College and Hospital, will not be examined this time around.

 The government?s worry stems from the fact that the council last year had put on hold the recognition of at least four medical colleges in Bihar. Several state-run medical colleges in Tamil Nadu have met with the same fate.

 ?We have taken a number of measures and are confident that the council will be satisfied. I can?t say anything more,? said Jayasree Mitra, director of medical education.

 While National Medical College, RG Kar and NRS will have the renewal of recognition at stake, IPGMER will undergo a scrutiny for the renewal of yearly permission. 

 Sources say the situation at IPGMER is alarming. For instance, 40 posts for professors and associate professors need to be urgently created, apart from 20 posts of group C and D employees. Presently, 15 group C and D posts are vacant. 

 Five new departments do not have enough teachers. The institution also does not have a students? hostel.

 Last year, the council had ticked off the authorities about the shortcomings, but the situation has not improved since then.

 The other medical colleges are no better. The minimum number of teachers RG Kar is supposed to have is 216. But the faculty strength falls short by 16. Morgues are mandatory for all medical colleges, but RG Kar and National Medical College do not have one. 

 At National Medical College, the pathology and the microbiology departments were separated in 1996. But the students of both departments still share a laboratory, taking turns to use it. Not a single medical college has an auditorium that can match the council standards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell theft has Bihar links

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have busted a gang that specialises in carrying off mobile phones after breaking into electronics showrooms.

 The seven arrested late on Saturday have connections with Bihar-based gangs that operate in metros and dispose of the stolen sets in Nepal. Seventeen mobile phones, along with their chargers, were seized in the swoop. 

 Acting on a tip-off, officers of New Market police station rounded up Mohd Ramzan, Mohd Islam, Mohd Zakir, Mohd Mehtab, Mohd Sajid and Sheikh Samsuddin. All of them are between 18 and 20, except Samsuddin, who is 26. 

 This gang was responsible for a recent break-in into an electronics shop in the Esplanade area. 

 The young men are residents of Bhukailash Road and the Garden Reach area, but operated in central and South Calcutta area.

 They entered the shops either by removing the air-conditioners, exhaust fans or a portion of a grille.

 ?The gang was involved in a number of break-ins in the past. We are interrogating them,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (central).

 Police were tipped off that gang members were to meet near Indian Museum on Saturday night to plan another burglary. Plainclothesmen were posted near the museum. 

 They arrested the gang members around midnight. After initial interrogation, police raided the residence of Sheikh Samsuddin, who kept the sets at home. 

 ?Ramzan, Islam and Zakir planned the operations, while Mehtab is an expert in cutting through grilles. Mehtab removed the exhaust fans, allowing other gang members to slip into the shop. Samsuddin looked after the stolen mobile sets. The masterminds are based in Bihar,? said an officer of New Market police station.

 A Bengali-speaking man, who lives in Motihari district, Bihar, coordinates the operation. Motihari is close to Nepal and the mobile sets are sent there. In Nepal, these stolen sets are sold at a premium in the black market.

 ?There are four kingpins and we have identified one of them as Gangaprasad Shaw. Recently, officers of the detective department were sent to Bihar to obtain information on the racket. Later Gangaprasad was arrested,? the officer added.

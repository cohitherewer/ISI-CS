 Delay drives dengue

 Seven-year-old Shubojeet Ganguly fell ill 12 days ago and was put through the typical gamut of blindfolded treatment ? for a viral attack, for typhoid and for malaria. 

 A dengue antigen test finally confirmed the disease and the boy was wheeled into the School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Tuesday.

 Dengue may have officially taken on epidemic proportions, but an inordinate delay in detection continues to drive the disease and endanger lives.

 ?The delay in medical treatment is causing a lot of panic among Calcuttans. What we are trying to convey is that there is nothing to be afraid of, but the delay in detection will prolong the suffering of the patients,? said R.D. Dubey, joint secretary (headquarters) of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).

 With complaints pouring in about the delay in treatment, the IMA has asked its member-doctors to be more vigilant while dealing with cases where patients are showing dengue-like symptoms.

 ?From strict observation of patients to carrying out dengue antigen tests along with malaria parasite, the advice is not to ignore anything. We have even asked doctors to organise awareness campaigns in affected areas,? Dubey added.

 What is often causing panic among patients and confusion among doctors is asymptomatic dengue (where the symptoms are not visible), which might start with high fever, but subside within a few days, only to reappear with classical or haemorrhagic symptoms.

 ?In the past few weeks, many patients have come to us after several days of unnecessary delay. Patients have turned up in a critical state of dengue shock syndrome (DSS),? said Jayati Sengupta, coordinator of the paediatric department at AMRI Hospitals.

 ?We have downloaded the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and given it to everybody concerned with healthcare here to ensure that there are no delays in dengue treatment,? she added.

 Not just individual doctors? chambers or small hospitals, patients are rushing to institutes like the School of Tropical Medicine.

 ?An eight-year-old boy was pleading with me to tell him that he won?t die. His mother was crying and the boy repeatedly tried to reassure himself with statements like ?I am strong, I won?t die?,? said a senior virologist on Tuesday.

 ?There has been an inexplicable delay in carrying out the tests. Perhaps the lack of enough medical kits is the reason, or delays on the part of individual doctors,? he added.

 Apurba Ghosh, director of the Institute of Child Health, said the delay in treating dengue cases could turn out to be disastrous.

 ?While we don?t want a panic to be created, but the situation is taking a turn for the worse,? added Ghosh.

 The IMA member-doctors are trying hard to allay the fear factor. ?Even cases of classical dengue can be cured. Just try to keep mosquitoes out of your house through proper insecticide-control measures. Rush to a doctor if you?re running a fever and drink plenty of fluids,? advised senior IMA functionary Moloy Patra.

 First steps in filmdom

 With the success of his big screen debut Humdum behind him, Calcutta boy Romith Raaj has got a firm toehold in Bollywood. With big dreams in brown eyes, the Ballygunge boy is focussed on a career in filmdom and he believes in climbing the ladder slowly, but steadily. 

 Humdum did 50 days of business in Mumbai and it also got three-star reviews from film critics. That, for a start, is quite satisfactory. I believe in taking it slowly, I would rather wait four years for a good role than do sleazy and stupid films, said Romith on a personal visit to the city last week.

 He started his acting career in Calcutta with a stint in the Bengali tele-serial Protibimbo about five years ago and was also a popular face in print and TV ads. But it was Bollywood that he had set his sights on since the age of eight. 

 I wanted to get a hang of facing the camera before I ventured into films. The work I did in Calcutta before moving to Mumbai in 2002 taught me the basics of the industry, he admitted.

 In Mumbai, he started off by hosting the childrens game show Shaka Laka Boom Boom and also featured in a few ads. He was spotted by Kushan Nandy (Pritish Nandys son), the director of Humdum, who offered him the role.

 Working with Kushan was a great experience; he was extremely supportive. He himself is a great actor, director and editor and so I got to learn a lot from him, said Romith.

 The young mans next film, too, is with Kushan, who is right now scouting for locations abroad. Shooting for the yet untitled film is slated to start next month.

 Its a love triangle with all the ingredients of a typical Bollywood family entertainer ? romance, comedy and suspense, said Romith, who will play the male lead in the movie.

 During his visit to Calcutta, Romith met Goutam Ghose and is expecting to act in the film-makers forthcoming Hindi movie to be produced by Bipin Vohra.

 I have had initial talks with him, but nothing has been finalised yet. If it happens, it will be a very good break for me since I have always wanted to act with directors from Bengal. I would love to work with Aparna Sen, Rituparno Ghosh and Buddhadeb Dasgupta, too. If I just get to spend a few days of my life with these highly creative people, the experience will enrich me as an actor, he said.

 In Bollywood, Romith is hoping to work with Ashutosh Gowariker soon. I have met him and he has promised to cast me in his next film after Akbar-Jodha, he revealed.

 While film offers are coming his way, most of them fail to excite him enough.

 A good director and a renowned banner are very important for me. Since I dont have parents in the film industry, I need to work with directors from whom I can get to learn. And so far I have been lucky that good directors are showing a lot of faith in me, he smiled.

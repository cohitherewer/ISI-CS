 Trans-border dud note ties

 - Currency racket tentacles even in Pakistan, reveal sleuths

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A detailed probe into the fake currency racket by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has exposed links even in neighbouring Pakistan.

 The CID on Tuesday hinted at a trans-border network, with its tentacles spreading right up to Karachi, apart from bases in Bangladesh, Nepal and India. 

 The revelation follows a probe into the links of the absconding middle-aged ?receiver? of fake notes worth Rs 22 lakh in Howrah.

 So far, investigations suggest the man exchanged e-mails with his Pakistani counterparts over the past two months, ever since he rented a house in Howrah. 

 Sankar Acharya, now in CID custody, was to make the delivery of the counterfeit notes to his ?clients? from western Uttar Pradesh (UP).

 ?It appears the absconding man frequented cyber cafes for his correspondences and never made any international calls. After a few months? stay in New Delhi, he moved into Howrah with his family. A polished man, he could speak chaste Gujarati and Hindi,? said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general, CID (operations).

 CID sleuths working on the case claimed on Tuesday that a gang from UP had even handed over payment to this man for collecting the fake notes. 

 Barely two days before Acharya?s arrest, the man came back to the city, but fled when he realised that the notes were yet to arrive from Bangladesh?s Khulna.

 The racketeers operating from Bangladesh chose Acharya only after ascertaining that he had no criminal antecedents. 

 ?He would have never been suspected, had it not been for a specific tip-off. It appears that this racket recruited members from amongst those who come to Calcutta for medical treatment from Bangladesh,? said an officer.

 The probe has revealed that Nepal was the most active base of the racket. 

 The one from Bangladesh restricted itself to certain parts of UP and a few other north-Indian states. 

 ?The racket was never keen on distributing the fake currency in the city, as this was the hub of its operations,? Rajeev Kumar added.

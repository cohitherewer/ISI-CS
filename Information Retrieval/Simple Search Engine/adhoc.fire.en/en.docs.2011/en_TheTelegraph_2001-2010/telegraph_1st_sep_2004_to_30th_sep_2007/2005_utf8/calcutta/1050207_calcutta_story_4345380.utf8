The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Outpost to net city centre cheats

 Samir Bhattacharya: I was waiting at the bus stop near Shahid Minar a week ago when a man, posing as a fellow-traveller, came up and started a conversation. He offered me a lift in his car, since we were going in the same direction. He took my bag and asked me to get into the car from the other side, but when I looked around, he had disappeared. I had lodged a complaint with Maidan police station, but I am yet to get back my bag, which contained some valuable documents.

 We have stepped up our vigilance in the area after a recent spurt in such incidents. Since it is a busy bus-stop, it is a natural choice for criminals, who try to dupe unsuspecting passengers by employing innovative techniques. Only a few days ago, we arrested three people in the area on charges of cheating. The hunt is on for more culprits operating in and around the bus stop. We have even set up an outpost in the Maidan area to strengthen our vigil.

Fitness-and-food fulcrum for footfall fiesta

Customised workout regimens, Korean strength machines, 

aerobics studio, state-of-the-art cardio range, aqua rower? The Bodyline Health 

Spa is the latest feather in the cap of The Calcutta Punjab Club, keen to make 

sports and fitness its talisman in a continuous effort to swim with the tide and 

bring in the GenX footfalls.

?The winds of change started blowing in the club back 

in 1996, when B.S. Dhanjal was the president. And we decided to utilise the idle 

premises besides jacking up fees to augment funds flow and give the members more 

value,? recalls Satish Kapoor, immediate past president, who was secretary then.

The new-look health club, a brainchild of Kapoor and 

launched during his tenure last December, is a logical carry-forward of the initiative 

to ring in the changes thick and fast. And initial walk-ins reported are more 

than encouraging. Over 200 members have already registered, with a 100-plus using 

the hi-tech exercise options on any given day.

?We offer comprehensive workout programmes to suit 

the requirements of every individual member and his/her guests under the supervision 

of qualified trainers,? says Gagan Sachdev, managing partner of Bodyline Sports, 

which runs the new-age gym at the Punjab Club. 

With a number of popular DJs from the city?s nightclub 

circuit dropping in regularly to stay in shape, ?trendy music too is never a problem?, 

smiles Sachdev.

Club president Deepi Bahri confirms sports and fitness 

is the fulcrum of the club?s future plans. ?The new-look gym has been a huge hit 

from Day One and we are also looking at a squash facility for which space is earmarked 

near the tennis courts,? says Bahri. 

Snooker, swimming, table tennis and badminton are 

the other sports the club offers, besides the traditionally popular cards room.

?But given our membership strength (2,300-plus), we 

need more space to expand our sports activities and we are on the lookout for 

land at an appropriate location,? says Bahri. 

The club has been participating in the inter-club 

sports carnival organised by Saturday Club for the second year running and the 

president is confident Punjab Club can have its own sports festival soon.

It?s not just the gym that?s new at the club. Jharokha, 

the 44-seater Indian restaurant, has been serving up its succulent fish tikkas 

and kebabs, and The Regal Room, a banquet hall for 80-100 guests, is now fully 

functional. 

The business lounge, with a modern communications 

centre, is also up and running and the management is drawing up a blueprint to 

do up the lawns for open-air get-togethers.

Amidst the heightened contemporary hues, there?s still 

a hallowed place for the elderly at the club. ?At the inauguration of the business 

lounge, we felicitated those individuals who have been members of the institution 

for the past 50 years. There were eight of them and they all turned up,? says 

Kapoor.

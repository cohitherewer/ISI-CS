 Move over Sourav and Sachin, Sania and Leander. The hunt for our own Ronaldinhos and Beckhams (okay, maybe Bhaichungs and Ashims) of tomorrow has begun, on home turf ? and with the campus as cradle.

 In its quest to take the beautiful game to the grassroots, Indian Football Association (IFA), the state parent body, has decided to seed soccer in some leading schools of the city where sports like cricket, tennis and basketball now rule. Kick-off: April 2005.

 The goal is simple: through a structured youth programme on the lines of those embraced in European schools, IFA wants to encourage city youngsters to play football by imparting scientific coaching at the formative level. ?We want to unearth and nurture genuine football talent through a sustainable coaching scheme and maintain a supply line for the future to compete in the international arena,? says IFA honorary secretary Subrata Dutta.

 The programme will involve four different target groups, formed by categories of age and academic standard. If Group A will feature beginners from Classes III and IV, the final group (D) will engage students from Classes IX and X.

 The IFA is kicking off the grassroots scheme with schools having their own football grounds. ?The school authorities must show interest in rolling out this unique football coaching scheme (being introduced for the first time in India),? says Dutta. A batch of 50 ?potentially-talented students? from each group will be picked, with every student being charged Rs 50 a month for coaching throughout the year from footballers of the recent past with coaching licences.

 The schools shortlisted for the programme include Don Bosco Park Circus, St Xavier?s Collegiate School, La Martiniere (Boys) School, St Thomas School, St James School, St Lawrence School, Birla High School, The Heritage School, Delhi Public School (New Town) and Don Bosco Liluah.

 Spread across the academic session April 2005 to March 2006, coaching sessions will be held thrice a week, including field training and theoretical classes. ?It?s a great idea to take football to the top schools. But to carry forward the initiative, soccer must become part of the syllabus,? says Atanu Bhattacharya, former India goalkeeper and one of the coaches picked for the programme.

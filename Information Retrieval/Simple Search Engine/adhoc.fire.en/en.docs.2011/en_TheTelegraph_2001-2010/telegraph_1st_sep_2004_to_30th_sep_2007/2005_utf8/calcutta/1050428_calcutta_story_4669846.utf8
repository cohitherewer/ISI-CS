 Examinees, one to none

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The student count on Day III of the boycott of the engineering and technology faculty examinations at Jadavpur University slipped to zero.

 Not a single student appeared for the test on both the Jadavpur and Salt Lake campuses on Wednesday, scheduled for the second-year students. 

 On Tuesday, the count was one, while the day before, 162 of the 1,800 examinees took the test.

 The faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) has called for the boycott to protest the executive council?s recommendation to expel five students on charges of indiscipline.

 The authorities have decided to step up security on campus to ensure that students willing to sit for the test on Thursday are not forced to stay away. This follows an appeal to vice-chancellor Ashokenath Basu from state human rights commission chief Justice Shyamal Sen.

 It is learnt that a section of guardians had approached Sen and complained that their wards were not being allowed by boycott-backers to enter examination halls. 

 ?We have been keeping all arrangements ready since Monday. From tomorrow, we will further step up security on campus,? said controller of examinations P.K. Sengupta.

 Wednesday?s student count is being trumpeted by the Fetsu as a victory against the authorities. 

 ?It has become evident that all students of the university are behind the victimised five,? claimed Fetsu general secretary Amit Chakraborty.

 Witnessing the situation sliding from bad to worse, senior university officials spent almost the entire day discussing possible ways out of the impasse. 

 Vice-chancellor Basu held several rounds of meetings with controller of examinations Sengupta and registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay. But no solution emerged till the evening.

 Sources said a section of teachers on Wednesday tried to corner the authorities, asking why no decision has yet been taken on the replies to the showcause notices slapped on the five accused.

 ?The students submitted their replies on time. Why are the authorities delaying in taking a decision?? asked a senior teacher. 

 Both teachers and students slammed the authorities for not calling an emergency meeting of the executive council ? the university?s highest decision-making body ? to discuss the issue.

Care for strays but learn to do it right

Hi ma?m! I am a student. A distant relative 

of mine is suffering from ?cat problem?. She possesses 30 or more cats and she 

is facing all kinds of problems concerning agitated neighbours, health problems, 

etc. Now she wants to get rid of them, politely (!). Can you help?

I received this mail from a student last week. Obviously 

I can?t help this student or his aunt in ?getting rid? of the cats! Where do we 

send 30 cats used to a life of domesticity for so many years? Most animal lovers 

make this mistake ? they rescue an animal, look after it for a while and when 

the enthusiasm and novelty of the situation wears off, they look for ways and 

means of getting rid of it. I?m sure this lady only had the welfare of these cats 

in mind when she took them in. But as animal lovers we ought to be more responsible, 

think of the animal?s long-term future and our level of commitment towards it.

For the same reason I don?t get very excited about 

some animal enthusiasts who claim to feed 30-40 dogs in their area everyday. By 

doing this, you are making the animal dependent on you for the rest of his life. 

Ask yourself if you will be able to continue feeding him for the next 10 years. 

I feed stray dogs in my area too (once in 10 days or thrice a month) but the survival 

of these dogs is not dependent on the food I provide. They are self-reliant and 

look for food themselves. Also, feeding should be done in a responsible manner 

so that it does not cause any disturbance to the public.

Please feed stray animals: In times of distress 

like incessant monsoons, give shelter to stray animals in your garage/building 

compound and please feed them because its difficult for them to find food.

If the mother of a litter has been killed or goes 

missing, feed the puppies milk till they are big enough to look for food themselves. 

Also in the case of a sickly/malnourished dog undergoing treatment.

Pertaining to feeding stray dogs, I?d like to clear 

a misconception that some ?not-so animal friendly people? have ? the stray dog 

population is created and sustained by garbage, not by handouts from kind-hearted 

people.

Hygiene and society: Keeping 30 cats in a flat 

is unhygienic for humans living in that flat. At the same time it?s traumatic 

for the cats given the space constraint and litter problems. Same is the case 

with dogs; they need space to run around and exercise. More than two dogs in a 

600-sq-ft flat is an absolute no-no.

Moderation, not extremism: As animal lovers, 

we can?t isolate ourselves from society or its norms and must abide by it at all 

times. In order to develop an animal-friendly building/area/society, work for 

welfare of stray animals by getting them vaccinated and sterilised, attend to 

injured animals and, most importantly, protest against atrocities on stray animals 

by writing to local papers. It is about balancing the emotional animal lover with 

some doses of practicality. Our aim should be a harmonious co-existence between 

humans and stray dogs. We do not believe one should benefit at the expense of 

the other.

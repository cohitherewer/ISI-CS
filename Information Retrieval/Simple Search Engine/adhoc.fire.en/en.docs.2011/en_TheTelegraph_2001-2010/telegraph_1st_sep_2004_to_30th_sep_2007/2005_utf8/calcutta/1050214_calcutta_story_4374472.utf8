 Strains of sitar for tsunami survivors 

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 A narrow escape and ?social consciousness? has propelled sitarist Purbayan Chatterjee to join the tsunami aid brigade. 

 Purbayan is set to perform at a night-long charity concert, to be held at Science City, on August 14. The likes of Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma will also take part in the event. ?We plan to raise at least Rs 3 to 4 lakh at the concert,? hopes Purbayan.

 He had been part of the February 11 Band Aid concert at Nazrul Mancha, which also featured Lakkhichhara, Skinny Alley and Paras Pathar. The proceeds will go to the Chief Minister?s Relief Fund.

 The young Hindustani classical musician himself escaped the tsunami disaster when he went to perform in Chennai on December 25. 

 ?It was a morning concert and I was supposed to fly back the next day, but due to some urgent work I had to take the flight the same evening,? recounts the son of sitarist Partha Pratim Chatterjee and disciple of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. 

 Purbayan feels the present-generation musicians are more aware of their social obligations. ?We travel widely and are thus more exposed and aware,? says Purbayan.

 Next on his tour itinerary is South Africa, where Purbayan will be playing a three-city concert spread across Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.

 The entire proceeds of the tour, organised by the Indian community in South Africa, will go towards tsunami aid, claims Purbayan. 

 Yet another foreign fund plug will be pulled at Los Angeles, part of Purbayan?s US tour in the coming months. It?s being organised by Spicmacay. 

 A month-long Australian tour is also slated in February-March, part of the proceeds of which is being pledged for the same cause. 

 ?The concerts are my bread and butter, but I plan to donate a part of every show I do till August towards tsunami aid,? promises Purbayan.

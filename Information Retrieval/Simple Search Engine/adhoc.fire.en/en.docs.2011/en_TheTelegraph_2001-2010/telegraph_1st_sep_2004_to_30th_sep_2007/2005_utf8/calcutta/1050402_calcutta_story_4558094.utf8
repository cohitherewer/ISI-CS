In its fifth week, the Friday night fashion show at Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion took off to a colourful start with the festival of colours as the theme. 

 In the usual format, five designers set the ramp afire with creations in bright colours, in keeping with the mood of the moment. 

 The make-up of models reflected the theme as well, as make-up artiste Nobin painted their pretty faces with shiny colours highlighting their facial contours. 

 Designers Kavita Tulsiyan, Sabita Ghosh, Nandini Basu, Shuma Mitro and Smita Gupta showcased their collection of saris and salwar-kurtas. From Shuma?s patchwork, which she creates by mixing fabrics from different parts of the country, to a tribal touch in Nandini?s label Mohar and Smita?s net saris, the mix was eclectic. 

 Despite Friday being Holi, the turnout was quite encouraging. 

 Desert day

 The Rajasthan Foundation celebrated the state?s anniversary ? March 30 ? at Gyan Manch by felicitating people who have contributed towards its betterment. 

 Rajasthan Foundation is an autonomous body constituted in 2000 working ?for the upliftment of the state?.

 The after-party was an attempt to display the culture and ethnicity of the state. The venue resembled a typical Rajasthani village, with sentries clad in traditional gear. Some people sat around smoking hookah and others helped guests tie safas (traditional Rajasthani headgear). 

 Then there were girls clad in colourful lehnga-cholis taking out water from a make-shift well. Mehndiwalis and folk musicians completed the picture. 

 But no fair can be a complete without sparing a thought for the stomach. The spread, of course, was typically Rajasthani. Gwarbha ki Sabji, Bati and Ker-sangri were just a few of the lip-smacking dishes. 

 Though the fare was strictly vegetarian, a meaty guest list more than made up for it. R.S. Lodha, Harsh Lodha, Suresh Neotia, Rupa Ganguly, Renu Roy and Biman Bose were a few among the invitees who made it to the venue despite the drizzle that evening.

 Past platter

 To add a dash of colour for spring and Holi, Kenilworth is hosting three decades of savoured recipes for food lovers till April 3 at the Marble Room. The Guzre Hue Yaadein festival is aimed at folks who enjoy a quiet candle-lit dinner or a family lunch with a touch of popular delicacies from the 70s, through to the 90s.

 ?With so many new eateries opening up, many food favourites have got lost or been improvised upon over time. This festival aims at bringing flavours of the past back in their authentic form as served in the Marble Room down the years,? said a spokesperson of the hotel. 

 Keeping in mind the taste buds of its clientele, the Little Russell Street hotel has included an assortment of vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian items in its new menu. For starters, one can choose from Aloo Jugalbandi, Murg Gulabi and Machchi Anarkali, to name a few. One can then move on to a wide tandoor variety, comprising Mutton Bara Kebab (succulent lamb marinated in chef?s special herbs and curd) or Sabz Makai Sheek Kabab (traditional vegetables and sweet corn). The Nawabi Sheekh Kabab ? a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy, Dariya Machchi (fresh pomfret cooked in whole spices) ? a popular Awadhi delicacy and Murg Musallam (morsels of chicken marinated in saffron-flavoured yoghurt with exotic Hyderabadi gravy) are other good kebab options. 

 For the main course, the Peshawari Machchi (chunks of fresh river bekti fillet cooked in a secret recipe) or the Achari Gosht (mutton cooked in pickle gravy) are savoury delights. To complement these, there is an assortment of rice and breads including Tandoori Roti, Khasta Roti, Naan, Kulcha, Chilman Biryani or a choice of Pulao with mushroom, jeera, dhaniya or vegetables. 

 To round off the meal, traditional Awadhi sweet dishes such as Shahi Tukra, Marmare Jaffrani or other choices from the extensive dessert platter are on offer.

 Be a junkie

 As the bohemian feel rules the fashion frontiers this summer, here?s one jewellery designer who has captured the look in his new range of ornaments. 

 Somit Das, who operates out of his residence at 82 Biren Roy Road in Behala, has come up with a line of neckpieces, bangles, earrings and wristbands made from animal bone. 

 ?These lend a very gypsy-like look. While most of the pieces are for women, which they can pair with any kind of outfit, there are a few pieces for men as well,? says Das.

 Other pieces in the line made of copper, brass, terracotta and various stones introduce tribal trendiness. Tribal paintings as well as ancient coins have influenced the motifs, including animal signs and geometric patterns.

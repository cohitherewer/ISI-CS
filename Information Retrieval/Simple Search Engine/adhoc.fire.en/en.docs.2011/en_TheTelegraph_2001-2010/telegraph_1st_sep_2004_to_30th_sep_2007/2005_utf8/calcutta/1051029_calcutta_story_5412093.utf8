 U-turn on Salt Lake firing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Friday admitted to firing on supporters of the SUCI-backed All-Bengal Electricity Consumers Association, who were protesting outside Bidyut Bhavan, at Karunamoyee, in Salt Lake.

 On Thursday, they had denied charges of firing, though at least two of the 80 injured in the clash had said they were hit by bullets.

 ?Police had to open fire to bring the situation under control,? said Raj Kanojia, inspector general of police (law and order). ?The order was issued by the executive magistrate after the protestors turned unruly,? he added.

 Sources said a constable of the State Armed Police (SAP) fired three rounds from his service rifle when the lathicharge and teargas shells failed to control the mob. Four policemen had to be admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital after sustaining serious injuries, the force said.

 The 51 persons arrested in connection with the incident were produced in the Bidhannagar sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court. ?Their bail petition has been rejected and they have been remanded in judicial custody till November 11,? said public prosecutor Anjan Chowdhury.

 ?We will stage protests at Karunamoyee and other parts of Salt Lake and Calcutta on Saturday,? threatened Sanjit Biswas, general secretary of All-Bengal Electricity Consumers Association.

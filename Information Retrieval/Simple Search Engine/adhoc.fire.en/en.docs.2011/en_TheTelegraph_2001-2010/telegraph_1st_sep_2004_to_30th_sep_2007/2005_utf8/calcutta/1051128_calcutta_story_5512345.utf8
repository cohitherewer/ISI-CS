The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Upgrade blueprint

 - Mini model to beautify wetlands 

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 How will the East Calcutta Wetlands look like? How will the improvement schemes be implemented? How much revenue can be earned? 

 In an attempt to provide clear answers to these questions, the state government has decided to adopt a development model for the 2,000 acres of watery green.

 Guidelines for the model have been framed and the government will soon appoint a consultant to prepare a project report on the proposed model. 

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, also chairman of the newly-formed East Calcutta Wetlands Development Authority, has called a meeting on November 30 to finalise the modality of work, operational plan and a strategy for coordinating with government departments and agencies.

 ?The entire 12,500 hectares of East Calcutta Wetlands will be developed, maintained and used to meet the criteria for wetlands of international importance,? Deb told Metro. ?The ecology, botany, zoology and hydrology of the area will be safeguarded. If the model is effective, we will apply it to the whole area.?? 

 Officials said the proposed development plan would include water sports, eco-tourism, social and recreational forestry and horticulture.

 ?We have prepared the guidelines taking into consideration the ecological balance, economic returns through eco-tourism and the opportunities for environmental education and recreation,? the chief secretary said.

 Settlers will be involved in the development activities. ?Local residents will be trained in various fields. They will also be engaged in cultivation of medicinal plants, horticulture and eco-forestry, which will be their permanent source of income,?? Deb added.

 Development and maintenance of the East Calcutta Wetlands, declared a Ramsar site on August 19, 2002, has been included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Calcutta Environment Improvement programme.

 Officials said at least Rs 1,000 crore would be required to develop the area according to the guidelines, but a final estimate could be worked out only after the project report is submitted.

 ?Apart from financial help from the ADB and the Centre, funds will be pumped in from the state exchequer, too. We are also looking for private partners. An important feature in preparing the model is to generate revenue from the site,?? said environment secretary Asim Barman.

 Opinions and suggestions are welcome from environmentalists and experts in wetlands management, he added. The process of engaging a consultant and preparing the project report is likely to take two months. 

 Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town, Rajarhat, is reportedly willing to develop and maintain a large chunk of the wetlands.

 Hidco officials said they wanted to develop and maintain the areas adjacent to the township. The agency is also planning to build a road from the Webel complex, the main entry to the township, to the wetlands. 

 ?We plan to develop the wetlands as a refreshment and entertainment centre for New Town residents, ?? an official explained.

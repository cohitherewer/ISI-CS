 Prod for trio in quota case

 R.VENKATARAMAN IN NEW DELHI

 The Supreme Court on Friday gave a week?s time to the chief secretary, health secretary and the director of medical education of West Bengal to provide copies of their replies in the contempt case involving NRI-quota students.

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and P.P. Naolekar asked petitioners? counsel Sanjib Sen to file his reply on the responses of the ?contemners? within a week. The hearing will resume after two weeks. 

 The bureaucrats are facing contempt charges for non-compliance of the Supreme Court?s earlier order on admitting students who had cleared the joint entrance examination (JEE) in place of the NRI-quota students. 

 The court also rejected a prayer of the NRI-quota students that they be admitted in MBBS courses in the next academic session, beginning July 2005. The judges said that they have to clear the JEE for that.

 Two of the 30 NRI-quota students now studying at SSKM and Midnapore medical colleges have secured admission in the colleges under the merit quota. 

 The court agreed to a plea that the two highest-ranking JEE students among the 69 ousted NRI-quota students be admitted in their places. 

 Three of the ousted students met BJP president L.K. Advani in New Delhi on Friday, seeking his intervention in the matter. They had reportedly spoken to him over the phone on Thursday.

 Advani later called up chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to inquire about the case. ?I told him that we have moved a larger bench, and Arun Jaitley knows about the matter in detail,? said the chief minister.

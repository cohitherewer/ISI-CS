 Myriad shapes for flight of fancy

 What is common to a bulb, a teapot, an ice cream and a football? They will all be floating in the sky on Kali puja afternoon. Their air-filled replicas, that is. 

 Phanush or hot-air balloons are alive and flying in north Calcutta. ?The custom was followed even when our family set up home on Beadon Street in 1925,? says Samar Dutta of Bholanath Dham. 

 At the Deys? (near the Beadon Street-Central Avenue crossing), the custom was started by Rajendranath in 1912. ?Magicians from the Far East used to display floating balloons as a trick in those days. That must have caught on,? says his 64-year-old grandson Gobindalal. 

 Rajendranath?s first flight of fancy had taken the shape of a temple. Since then, experiments have taken myriad forms. ?We started with a pot,? says Dutta. ?Then came the ball, the star, the pitcher, the tyre and even a hen with an egg.? 

 The shape of pride for the Deys was a five-storey-high balloon carrying a picture of Netaji in 1949. ?That was a post-Independence celebration by my brother. The luti (cotton ball soaked in methylated spirit that is set on fire at the base of the balloon to keep the air inside hot and light) itself was as big as a football. The gigantic shape had flown across the canal which the Bypass has filled up now.?

 The balloons are as much of the present as of the past. While many families have withdrawn from the fray, newcomers have stepped in. One such first-generation flier is Biresh Majumdar of Bhim Ghosh Lane. The science tutor learnt the ropes while teaching the principles of buoyancy to a student. ?My grandfather used to fly balloons but the tradition died as he aged. Under sir?s inspiration, I made a start in Class VIII,? recounts Arghya Bhattacharya, now 17. 

 ?Sir? is now closeted for seven to eight hours a day with his students, crouched over graph papers calculating the centre of gravity of his missiles. ?My subject is biology, so I had to do some reading,? he smiles, pointing at tomes on applied mechanics and descriptive geometry.

 The students are working in groups handling scissors or gum, depending on the stage of the balloon they are handling. ?We will be flying about 20 balloons, all 15 to 20 feet high,? informs Ganesh Ray, who is confident of creating his own balloon in another two years.

 If enthusiasm and manpower are aplenty in Majumdar?s team, the families are falling short of hands. ?It is such a laborious job that my friends refuse to help out. Strangers, who came to learn, backed out as well. My cousins join when they are free,? says Gobindalal?s 24-year-old son Sumanta. 

 The fall in quality of materials has not helped either. ?The Indian tissues cannot withstand as much heat as the imported ones could. They are also perforated, letting heat out. Neither do today?s spirits generate as much heat,? says Dutta.

 The cost is another daunting factor. ?I run up a bill of about Rs 10,000,? says Gobindalal, who specialises in the pasting of awareness messages on the balloons. The Deys have yet to decide if they will continue this year on Rashpurnima (November 15), as is their custom. 

 Yet there is a sense of responsibility to a dying tradition that keeps the balloons in air. ?People crowd Central Avenue till Girish Mancha to see the spectacle. We have a responsibility to keep the practice alive,? says Gobindalal, the owner of ?Phanushbari?.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I have her dimples, his height?

 A far cry from the fast bikes of Dhoom, 

 JOHN ABRAHAM plays a simple middle-class man in the 

 slow-paced Viruddh. He tells Pratim D. Gupta about 

 the real experience of becoming Amitabh and Sharmilas 

 reel son

 ?While doing Viruddh, 

 I realised I was doing something truly different and 

 that was very satisfying for me as an actor,?says John 

 Abraham. (Below) In a moment from the film 

 Why did you agree to sign a 

 film like Viruddh that revolves less around you and 

 more around the aged couple losing their only son?

 (Laughs) How can you say 

 this? I do play a very significant role in the film. In 

 fact, the whole film revolves around me. It?s all because 

 of me that the parents face this crisis. I am also the sootradhaar 

 (narrator) in Viruddh. So the whole story is in a 

 way seen through my eyes. Once you see the film you will 

 know what I mean.

 Viruddh seems far more 

 real than your larger-than-life characters in recent blockbusters 

 Dhoom and Kaal. Was the experience different?

 It was wonderful. Viruddh gave 

 me the opportunity to go back to my roots. I belong to a 

 middle-class background and am very close to my family. 

 So in a way it took me away from the characters of Dhoom 

 and Kaal. Also, I play an on-screen son for the 

 first time. And yes I am truly doing something different 

 and that is very satisfying as an actor.

 It?s not that I didn?t enjoy doing 

 Dhoom or Kaal but like my every film, Viruddh, 

 too, is very special and since it?s very realistic one can 

 relate to it easily.

 How was it working with legends 

 like Amitabh Bachchan and Sharmila Tagore?

 Mr Bachchan is a brilliant actor 

 and an institution by himself. No wonder he is everyone?s 

 dream to work with and I am the lucky one who has already 

 done two movies with him (Aetbaar being the other 

 one). Everyone learns so much from him, just by being with 

 him, seeing him and absorbing him.

 Sharmilaji is still so 

 gorgeous and very cute. I used to chat with her a lot on 

 the sets. She is awesome at this age also. I found her a 

 complete person, always very warm. And my god? what grace 

 ? I am stumped, don?t know what to say.

 Viruddh seems very middle-of-the-road 

 ? a real theme with a commercial look and cast. To what 

 extent could you relate to your character and the film? 

 Like I said before, I come from 

 a middle-class family. I love my parents ? I am especially 

 close to my mom. So this role seems like an extension to 

 my real life. The bonding shown in the film between the 

 parents and the son is so much the relationship I have with 

 my parents in real life. In fact, the joke on the sets of 

 the film was that I have the dimples of Sharmila Tagore 

 and the height of Amitabh Bachchan. (Laughs) So that?s 

 very real. 

 Had you been placed in a similar 

 situation as Mr Bachchan in the film, how would you have 

 reacted to it? 

 I don?t know how I would have 

 reacted had something so devastating happened to me as a 

 father, because I am barely half that age. Losing anyone 

 dear to you is the worst thing to happen to anyone. My sympathies 

 with everyone who is going through such a difficult phase 

 in their life. Just imagine someone losing his or her son 

 and then trying to restructure life all over again. I simply 

 can?t imagine something like that?

 You have a host of other releases 

 coming up. Which of them are you looking forward to?

 Audiences will get to see me in 

 a huge range of films in the coming months. I am doing BR 

 Chopra?s Babul (with Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee 

 and Salman Khan), Kabul Express with Naseersaab, 

 Deepa Mehta?s Water (with Lisa Ray and Seema Biswas), 

 Priyadarshan?s comedy Garam Masala (with Akshay Kumar 

 and Paresh Rawal). Few more are in the pipeline as I am 

 talking to many producers and directors and reading a lot 

 of scripts? I am just trying to do a variety of roles.

 And tell us a little bit about 

 the weekly publication you are planning to launch...

 (Laughs) It was just a 

 conversation that I had with a journalist. He suggested 

 the idea of starting some publication and I just said that?s 

 a good idea. That?s it. The next day, I saw the news in 

 the paper that I was starting a newspaper. 

 I am not planning anything like 

 that. I don?t have enough money to open a publication nor 

 the time now to think about it. I am concentrating on my 

 career in acting completely as of now.

 Long hours after long holidays

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Everybody has a summer holiday and students of many city schools this year had an extended one thanks to the heat wave.

 The monsoon has finally set in, the mercury has dipped and classes are back on track. But what the sun gave, the rains are set to snatch. Students ? and teachers ? would now be required to work overtime with several city schools deciding to make up for the loss of time caused by the extended vacation and Monday?s transport strike.

 Working on Saturdays, chopping puja and winter vacations, an early start to the day and staying open on declared holidays are among the strategies adopted to compensate the loss.

 ?We have already reduced our summer and puja vacations to comply with the recent government order for a minimum of 200 teaching days a year. We may have to reduce our holidays further as we have lost a number of teaching days by keeping our school closed during the heat wave,? said Krishna Damani of South Point School.

 The teaching days? stipulation is binding on all schools, whether affiliated to Madhyamik board, ICSE or CBSE.

 ?It is essential for children to take a break from studies. We may have to adopt a combination of methods ? additional classes on one or two Saturdays, half days on one or two declared holidays, and so on,? said Sharmistha Banerjee, principal, Vidya Bharati School.

 What compounded the problem was Monday?s transport strike that turned out to be total, thanks to state backing.

 ?We have to adjust to climatic disorders. But we were not prepared for the transport strike,? said C.R. Gasper, principal, St Augustine?s Day School.

 ?We hope there are no more bandhs,? added Anjali Razdan, principal, Laxmipat Singhania Academy.

 Many institutions, like Park English School, want to make up lost ground by staying open on Saturdays. ?We will follow Monday?s time table,? said principal A.D. Rozario.

 During the hot spell, Gokhale Memorial Girls? School had advanced school timings, instead of shutting down. In place of 10 am to 4 pm, the school continued to operate from 8 am to 12 noon.

 Just jackets and bag buys

 Steering clear of the usual salwar kurtas and lehnga cholis dished out by most city designers, Sucheta Merh has made stylish jackets her forte. Her line of elegantly-tailored jackets is now doing the rounds of stores in New York.

 The jackets of varying lengths draw inspiration from tribal art, reworked with a streetwise aesthetic. The colour palette is a mix of subdued hues like camel hide, muddy blue, browns of Indian summer leaves and greens of young leaves. 

 Interesting surface techniques and with contemporary threadwork, brass-coin detailing, multi-coloured beadwork juxtaposed with innovative batik and her signature prints adorn the pieces. 

 The fabric focus is on natural fibres like cottons and silks.

 The collection is already doing the rounds of stores in New York with enthusiastic feedback, smiles Sucheta. In Calcutta, the line is available at Earthy Myths on Loudon Street.

 Her store is also hosting an exhibition of hand-crafted bags till August 13. The bags can be paired with dressy evening wear as well as causal day wear and make for great gift options for Rakshabandhan and Sindhara.

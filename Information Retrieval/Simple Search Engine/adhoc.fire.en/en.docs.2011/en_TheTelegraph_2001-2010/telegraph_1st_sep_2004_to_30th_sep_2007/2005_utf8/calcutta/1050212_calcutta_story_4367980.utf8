 School fracas, 15 arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fifteen persons were arrested at a secondary school in Thakurpukur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Friday, after guardians gheraoed the headmistress and teachers to protest punishment meted out to 12 students.

 The headmistress was arrested on the basis of a complaint by a guardian, that she made the students stand in the sun for over an hour. Some guardians, police officers said, were taken into custody after they attacked the cops.

 According to superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta, Barisha Vivekananda Balika Vidyalaya headmistress Ila Samaddar had alleged that the students had damaged the windows and number plate of her car, parked in the courtyard.

 She then rounded up 12 students and asked them to confess to the act. Not getting a reply, she ordered them to stand in the sun. Three of the children fainted, unable to bear the heat. 

 When news spread, the guardians gheraoed the principal and other teachers, demanding an explanation. Soon, Thakurpukur police personnel reached the spot.

 A senior officer claimed that the crowd then started throwing stones at them, injuring three policemen. 

 The sick students and injured policemen were admitted to Behala?s Vidyasagar Hospital.

 A guardian, however, countered that it was the police who first beat them up. ?The cops were convinced that the headmistress was telling the truth,? he said.

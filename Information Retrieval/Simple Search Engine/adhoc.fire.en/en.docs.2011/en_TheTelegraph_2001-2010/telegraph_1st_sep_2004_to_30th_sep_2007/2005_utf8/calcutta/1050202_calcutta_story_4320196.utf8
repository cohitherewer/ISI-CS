 Cops see well-laid plan in boy kidnap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nearly 20 days after the rescue of 10-year-old Roshan Jha from the Howrah Maidan area, police came to the conclusion on Tuesday that it was a planned case of kidnap. 

 ?The abductors were after the money Roshan?s father had saved in his provident fund. Being on the verge of retirement, he would receive the money soon. They had planned to kill the boy somewhere outside the district,? said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, Howrah?s superintendent of police. 

 Two persons, identified as Vijay Raj Bharati and Bir Bahadur Bharati, aged between 19 and 25, have been arrested in Uttar Pradesh. 

 ?They had masterminded the abduction and used another boy, Sonu, who was close to the Jhas and stays near their residence, to lure away Roshan,? superintendent Bhattacharya said. 

 Roshan was kidnapped from the Ramkrishnapur area, under Howrah police station, on January 10, allegedly by Sonu. He had reportedly invited Roshan for a train trip.

 Roshan, a student of Class V, was close to Sonu, a student of Class XI, who lives in the same area. So, Roshan could not turn down the request and went along with him. 

 After Roshan went missing, a telephone call was received at a neighbour?s house. 

 The callers demanded a ransom of Rs 60,000. But police realised that something was amiss when they learnt that the callers had laughed into the telephone. 

 ?We realised that it was something of a joke. When the boy returned home within two days, it became even more clear that it was not a case of kidnapping,? said a senior police officer. 

 A few days after Sonu returned, police interrogated him to find out the truth about Roshan?s disappearance and came to know about the kidnappers? plans. ?Then, we launched the operation to net the other two,? the officer said. 

 Police said Sonu escorted Roshan to Rishra, in Hooghly, and kept him confined in a house. Later, the trio took him to Burdwan and Simlagarh. 

 ?They chose the Simlagarh area to kill Roshan, as it is desolate,? Bhattacharya said. 

 However, they could not come to an agreement over which of the three would kill the boy. Ultimately, Roshan was allowed to return home. 

 ?Sonu gave Roshan some cash and put him on a Howrah-bound train. Roshan returned home on January 12,? superintendent Bhattacharya said. 

 ?Roshan was not aware of his abductors? plans. The trio had no experience in crime. This would have initiated them,? Bhattacharya added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Pete Seeger 

Sensitive, yet fiery and outgoing, you are unaffected by and unafraid of the evils of life. You are a source of inspiration to others. You respect work ethics, value honesty and have impeccable morals. You are overly responsible in hands-on jobs, but uncomfortable in confrontational situations. A little more style will help you promote your artistic talents. ? Kusum Bhandari

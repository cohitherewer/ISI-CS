 Letters from father and daughter

 Despite the lights going dim and the microphone going mute, there was no missing the magic of Farooque Sheikh and Sonali Bendre taking the tale of Tumhari Amrita forward, says Reshmi Sengupta

 For the much-hyped play Aapki Soniya, starring Farooque Sheikh and Sonali Bendre, the first Calcutta show passed off without much of a murmur. The two high-profile performers quietly slipped into town on Wednesday for the play at Hyatt Regency in the evening. The sequel to Shabana Azmi and Farooque Sheikh?s revered Tumhari Amrita, which the duo has been performing for the past 14 years across the world, was hosted by New Approach for a select gathering of army officials and their families.

 At the outset, producer Lubna Salim clarified that Aapki Soniya is based on hatred unlike Tumhari Amrita, whose basic premise is love. Otherwise, the play borrows its form from the original with two performers sitting at two ends of a stage with just a bunch of letters. No costumes, or props. Stripped of any frills, the set (designed by Bollywood art director Sharmistha Roy) comprises two tables, two chairs and two reading lamps. And like the original, what holds the audiences is a taut and gripping script written by Javed Siddiqi.

 Aapki Soniya, directed by Salim Arif, starts from where Tumhari Amrita ends. It has been years since painter Amrita Nigam, whose relationship with politician Syed Zulfiquar Haider had spawned a series of letters and Tumhari Amrita, has died. 

 The ageing Haider is in the last stages of his life when Soniya, claiming to be Amrita?s daughter, writes to him. Born and brought up in Paris by her French father, Soniya wants to dig up the past. Haider, who had no knowledge of her existence, finally agrees to her demand to discuss Amrita.

 What follows is a sustained exchange of letters between a seasoned man of the world who still loves Amrita and a young spunky girl who despises her mother for having deserted her. 

 Though seeming to be a journey back into the past, Aapki Soniya is actually a progression into the characters on stage. It sheds less light on who or what Amrita was, but more on Haider and Soniya who discover a bond with each other. As the secrets come tumbling out and they turn out to be father and daughter, Haider?s indifference melts into paternal affection and Soniya?s scorn into remorse.

 The reunion through letters is touching without drowning in sentimentality. Farooque?s maturity and wisdom is a fine contrast to Bendre?s youthful brashness. From being arrogant and cheeky to mellow and understanding, Bendre infuses a lot of her own charm into her 28-year-old character, displaying a wide range of emotions. She is fluent in her Urdu diction, too, and what she shows on stage has seldom come across on screen.

 As the ageing Zulfiquar Haider on his deathbed, Farooque made the best use of his sore throat and the occasional coughing bouts went just fine with his ailing character. Despite the handicaps, the actor who helped give the middle-class a believable hero in a clutch of light-hearted films, smoothly transitioned from a reclusive public figure to an affectionate father, switching from cynicism to irritation to sympathy to sadness.

 But a string of technical glitches marred some of the brilliant performance. The lights went off at least thrice and the sound system crashed in the last crucial leg. The actors resumed reading under dim lights but that robbed the climax of much of its impact ? an emotionally charged Bendre talking about her folly and anguish; Farooque, on his part, reading without the aid of a mike. 

 ?But next time, when we are in Calcutta and with a proper theatre, we will be better,? promised Farooque, with Bendre smiling beside him.

 Market makeover pushed on hold

 - Trinamul pilots backburner move on College Street mall

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya buckled under pressure from the Trinamul Congress at the civic house session on Wednesday and deferred a discussion on the proposal to lease out the College Street market for 180 years.

 The mayoral council on July 22 had unanimously passed the proposal to hand over the market to Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd, which will redevelop it into a comprehensive market complex on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis.

 But the new board, led by the CPM, had to back out after placing the proposal before the civic house for ratification. 

 The mayor said some crucial points were missing in the proposal, which will be tabled again at the next meeting after the necessary revision.

 Opposition leader Javed Ahmed Khan (Trinamul) slammed the mayor for leasing out the property for as many as 180 years, ?in the guise of a BOT scheme?.

 Anup Chatterjee and Rajib Deb (both Trinamul) accused the board of ?virtually selling off? the seven-bigha plot for only Rs 2 crore. In the open market, they claimed, the plot would have fetched at least Rs 20 crore. 

 Drawing a comparison between the proposed development of the College Street market and the Parkomat project, Khan pointed out that the private partner of the Rawdon Street property, built under a BOT scheme, had been allowed to operate it for just 20 years.

 The College Street market stands on seven bighas and houses more than 1,200 stall-owners and vendors. During the period of the demolition and reconstruction, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation plans to relocate the stall-owners on the 16.5-bigha Marcus Square, one of the largest green and open spaces in the city, on Madan Mohan Burman Street.

 According to the proposal, Bengal Shelter Housing Development will bear the cost of relocating the stall-owners.

 Defending his move, mayor Bhattacharya said the market was in such a deplorable state that it was beyond the means of the civic body to redevelop it. 

 The only viable alternative, he claimed, was to rebuild the market with a private-sector company under a BOT scheme. 

 ?We plan to convert the College Street market into a multi-storeyed mall, with all the facilities of a modern commercial complex, including parking facilities,? Bhattacharya asserted.

 The market is basically a single-storeyed structure, though some portions are of two storeys. Since the building has not been marked as a heritage structure, the authorities would face no problem in demolishing it.

 Like most of the civic markets, the College Street market, too, has been a perennial source of concern for the civic body. The authorities spend more than Rs 3 crore a year to maintain the markets. 

 During the tenure of the Trinamul Congress, the civic body would have to spend Rs 80 lakh a year on the College Street market alone, though the annual revenue from it had never been more than Rs 22 lakh.

 Rahul Dev in Games Bond: Shaken and stirred

 For video game freaks, there?s finally something on Indian television. Games Bond, India?s first gaming championship show, premiered on STAR One on Friday, June 17 and will be telecast on 12 more Fridays at 8.30 pm. 

 Set in a ?virtually real ambience of a war-field?, Games Bond will feature two teams with five gaming champs each in a video gaming encounter. The winning team will go on to represent India in the World CPL Gaming Championships to be held in the US. 

 The gaming show also features model-turned-actor Rahul Dev in an all-new avatar of a television anchor for the first time. 

 The show is also high on the tech factor with a lot of graphics being used to provide the ?real look and feel?. The first season would be only on the theme of military combat with broken water pipes and run-down walls used to give the War Zone and Underground aura to the gaming environment. As the game is played, the ?picture in picture? along with the reaction shots help capture the intensity of the game continuously. 

 At the launch of Games Bond, Ravi Menon, head of programming of STAR One, said: ?This show is another attempt from us to provide differential programming. Gaming is the most popular usage category for the PC after e-mail and word processing. Many countries are already witnessing exponential growth patterns in the gaming space. Now it?s India?s time to be exposed to world-class gaming.?

 No Indian film has created so much of stir as Sudhir Mishra?s Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi has done, both here and away. After travelling to more than 15 of the world?s most famous film festivals, the Pritish Nandy Communications film has now been bestowed the Chakra de Oro prize in the official section of the Imagine India film festival in Spain.

 The film, which marks the debut of the enchanting Chitrangda Singh and features brilliant performances by Kay Kay Menon and Shiney Ahuja, has also done very well in the multiplex circuit in India having completed 50 days in many a theatre.

 In the Spanish film festival, a select international jury, which included actor-playwright Girish Karnad, voted for Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, ahead of Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Swapner Din, Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black, Anjan Das?s Iti Srikanta, Mani Ratnam?s Yuva and Partho Sengupta?s Let the Wind Blow.

 What We are Watching

Bollywood / Suniel Shetty - starrers

 Padmashree...: Pain personified 

Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav

 The four title characters are entangled in a diamond robbery case in Cape Town. Suniel plays the hero Laloo, Johnny Lever the funnyman Yadav, Mahesh Manjrekar the henpecked husband Prasad. All are after Padma, played by Masumeh. Add to this scantily clad Anupama Verma and Kim Sharma for eye candy.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 10.45 am, 1.30 pm, 4.40 pm, 10.35 pm; INOX (City Centre): 11.10 am, 12.55 pm, 4.05 pm, 6.50 pm, 10 pm; 89 Cinemas: 3.20 pm, 9.30 pm.

 Why bother? Nonsensical, farcical and fully faaltoo, Padmashree... is an apology for a film. Bad performances coupled with a non-existent script add up to less than 50 per cent of the audience making it to the multiplexes for the first weekend.

 Blackmail: Damp squib

Blackmail

 A take-off on the Mel Gibson-starrer Ransom, this Anil Devgan film has brother Ajay playing the baddie again after Khakee, trying to get back at leading man Suniel Shetty. The lady loves, Priyanka Chopra and Dia Mirza, have very little to do as they watch the men go through the motions. 

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 1 pm, 3.40 pm, 6.20 pm, 9 pm; INOX (City Centre): 11.40 am, 2.20 pm, 7.30 pm, 10.10 pm; 89 Cinemas: 2.05 pm, 4.30 pm, 6.55 pm, 9.20 pm.

 Why bother? Poor marketing and promotion along with a largely disinterested cast has spelt doom for this action thriller. The film hasn?t been able to garner a decent opening due to the lukewarm promos on the small screen. The music too has done nothing to bring the audiences to the theatres. So, the film has managed less than 60 per cent collections at the city multiplexes.

 With Christmas just weeks away, many Calcuttans chose to make the most of Sunday evening by going on a shopping spree. But for the residents of Nirbaan Apartments, off Ruby General Hospital, picking up some tips on good parenting was priority number one.

 For, Nirbaan played host to this weekends GoodLife Talk Show. The complex dating back to 1995 has 464 flats. 

 On the dais: actor Arjun Chakraborty, his jewellery designer wife Nilanjana and moderator Rita Bhimani. The talking point: role of parents in the growth of children.

 The Q amp;A session rolled out with Rita asking Arjun to speak a little about his childhood, the greater part of which was spent in Rajasthan. Our childhood was very different from the way children grow up today. There was much less pressure and we were allowed to be ourselves. We would spend a lot of time with friends, study as and when we wanted to. Basically, it was full of fun, yet we always did the right things at the right time, said Arjun.

 Today, kids are extremely overprotected by their parents in every aspect of life. Though parents think what they are doing is correct, in certain cases it might backfire, warned the actor, looking striking in an embroidered kurta.

 Wife Nilanjana added a rider: It is very true that we had a much easier childhood, but the scene has changed so drastically over the years that parents too cannot be blamed completely for the way they treat their children now. Competition has increased manifold and you cannot expect kids to have the kind of life we did in our times. But parents should definitely remember that too much of control over every aspect of their lives is not good. Children should, at least for some part of the day, be allowed to be themselves.

 Rita then asked the star couple to dwell on the common problem of parents finding less and less time to spend with their children.

 Arjun explained: To survive comfortably in todays world, most couples have to work. Besides, most joint families have broken down into nuclear ones. From a very young age, children grow up with only maids around. Parents often seem to suffer from some kind of guilt feeling, and in a bid to compensate for the lost time, they start bringing in gifts for the child.

 There is nothing wrong about getting gifts, but when this gift is being brought home to make up for the time you could not spend with your child, it could be a little problematic.

 The child will probably have a feeling that there is something wrong with both his parents working. It is important to spend quality time with your child and make him/her see from a very young age that there is a reason behind why you work and that you are not out of home to just have a good time.

 According to Nilanjana, it is also very important to say no to your child at times. Dont encourage everything that your child does. The child should be able to realise early that life is not a bed of roses. Know when to say a yes and when to say a no. That is the biggest thing you need to recognise as parents.

 The session was then thrown open to the floor, signalling a flurry of questions ranging from the effects of watching television to sibling rivalry to the effect of private tuition.

 The last question of the evening was put forward by a group of young mothers who wanted to know what could be done to tackle the rising cost of education. The celebrity guests said: All of us should realise one basic thing. We send our children to school to educate them. But these days, we get to witness some kind of a competition among parents regarding the school their children go to. It has become more of a status symbol. This is very sad. At the very beginning, chalk out the amount you can afford for your childs education and choose the school accordingly.

 Rita added how there were lots of education loans that could be availed of if funding was a problem.

 The interactive evening was rounded off with the resonance of Rabindrasangeet as Arjun Chakraborty sang out loud: Aaji jhorer raate? 

 The Sunday evening crowd at the complex off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass lapped it all up under the crisp December sky.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beam block averted 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was threatening to be the first thorn in the crown for multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable since it acquired rival Indian Cable Net last month. But two days of negotiation have managed to defuse the threat of a STAR channels switch-off on Indian Cable Net.

 According to sources in STAR and SitiCable, both parties have agreed on the amount that has to be paid. ?There are some minor issues and payment schedules that need to be sorted out, however, before we can say the matter is fully settled,? a STAR source said on Wednesday.

 STAR had issued a public notice in newspapers on May 9, as per Telecom Regulatory Authority of India regulation, informing the subscribers of Indian Cable Net that the MSO was liable for disconnection if outstandings were not cleared by June 9. 

 The dues ? allegedly to the tune of Rs 10 crore ? had accumulated since Indian Cable Net, Calcutta?s largest MSO, was doubling as the distributor for STAR in Calcutta till March this year.

 Indian Cable Net had then claimed that ?around 70 per cent of the amount? was due from other MSOs who refused to pay since Indian Cable Net was no longer the distributor for STAR. It also alleged that sections of the market had not accepted various hikes imposed by STAR since 2002, resulting in poor collection from the ground.

 The STAR-Indian Cable Net feud had even reached the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal.

 As the differences were being resolved in Calcutta, STAR issued a one-month notice to an MSO in Mumbai, Hathway Cable amp; Datacom, on Tuesday, threatening to disconnect the network if outstandings were not cleared.

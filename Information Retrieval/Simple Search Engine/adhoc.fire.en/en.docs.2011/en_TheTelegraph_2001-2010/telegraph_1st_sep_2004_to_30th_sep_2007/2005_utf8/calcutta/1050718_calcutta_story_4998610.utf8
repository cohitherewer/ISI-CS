 Seths Food Court in New Alipore is warming its charcoals for a kebab festival, on till July 24. Dishing out a wide range of kebabs, the spread intends to cater to authentic Mughlai tastes. 

 Poultry lovers have a sizeable selection and can dig into the Murg Anarkali (succulent pieces of chicken breast marinated in pomegranate juice), Murg Kashmiri (tender chunks of chicken breast cooked in a clay oven), Murg Irani (delicately marinated chicken breast with cream and the chefs special spices) or the Long Murg Tikka (clove-flavoured chicken cooked in a tandoor). 

 The sole red meat item on the menu is the Mutton Jalandar. Typical of the region it is named after, it is a dish of spicy mutton slices cooked in a tandoor.

 Vegetarians have a wide platter to choose from as well. Take a dig out of a steaming plate of Shahi Shubnam (stuffed mushroom with dry fruits coated with a flavoured wrap), Vegetarian Dahi Kebab (a unique combination of vegetables and hung curd served with dahi chutney) or Tandoori Aloo (barrels of potato stuffed with creamed potatoes).

 The dishes are priced economically between Rs 70 and Rs 110.

 Sweet sin

 Taj Bengal is having a chocolate festival at By The Way, its coffee shop and La Patisserie, the cake shop, from July 13 to July 22. Choc--bloc, as the promotion is called, has desserts in every hue to placate every sweet tooth.

 The list of dark chocolate desserts includes Soft Centred Cognac Chocolate with Banana Caramel Ice Cream, French Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream, Swiss Hot Chocolate Souffl? and Dark Chocolate Cr?me Br??e with Chocolate Ice Cream.

 The milk chocolate desserts include Spicy Chocolate Baumkuchen and Chocolate de Rubis. 

 The white chocolate variations to be savoured are White Chocolate Pistachio Brownie with Chocolate Ice Cream and White Chocolate Meringue Rosettes with Kahlua Cream and Coffee Ice Cream. 

 While at By The Way you would be asked to cough up anything between Rs 145 and Rs 175, at La Patisserie the pocket pinch is far less severe due to the absence of accompaniments (such as ice cream). So here, the cost is far less at between Rs 45 and Rs 70.

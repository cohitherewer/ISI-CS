The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spillover fund use for road repairs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) on Monday sanctioned the use of Rs 29.3 crore for undertaking road strengthening and repair work on six of the city?s important stretches.

 The money, left over from the Rs 400-crore Calcutta Transport Infrastructure Development Project, will be used to concretise a 2.7-km stretch of Canal East Road from BT Road to Maniktala Main Road, and the one-km service road along the Lock Gate flyover. 

 The JBIC?s approval was communicated to the state government on Monday. 

 Incidentally, the approval came a day before the bank?s deputy governor visits the city to hold talks with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

Tram track impasse

 However, apart from renewal of tram tracks at Maniktala junction, around the Park Circus crossing and on a stretch of Rashbehari Avenue, the JBIC funds will not be utilised for repair of the city?s ravaged tram tracks.

 Asked if the government was contemplating seeking assistance from foreign agencies for tram track repairs, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said he was not aware of any such decision.

 Can the leftover JBIC funds be used to undertake tram track repair across the city?

 ?No, these funds are meant for specific projects approved by the JBIC. They cannot be put to any other use,? Chowdhury said.

 In a quandary after the high court order asked it to consider Calcutta Tramways Company?s requisition for track repairs in the city, the state government has decided to form a committee in a bid to buy more time.

 This was decided at a meeting between finance minister Asim Dasgupta, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, along with their departmental secretaries last Thursday. 

 The committee will be headed by the public works department engineer-in-chief and will comprise officers of the transport department and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. 

 It will study the ravaged tracks all over the city and submit its report to the government in two months? time.

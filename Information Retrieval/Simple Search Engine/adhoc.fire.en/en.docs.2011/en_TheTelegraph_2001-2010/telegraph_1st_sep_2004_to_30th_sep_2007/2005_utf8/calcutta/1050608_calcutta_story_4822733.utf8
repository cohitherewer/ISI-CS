The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Town Hall was restored some time ago and it is already in need of repairs. The fa?ade requires to be whitewashed and the same can be said of the rear of the huge edifice. The wooden balcony behind the building should be given a coat of paint immediately and the mouldings need to be touched up or else they will start crumbling. The foundation of the business centre that architect Dulal Mukherjee had intended to build there but was not allowed to is a big eyesore.

 I will not go into the horrors of the Calcutta Panorama but the staircase leading to the hall upstairs looks as if it has not been swept and cleaned for ages. The unkempt makeshift studio under the stairs makes the place look even more dreary.

 The first floor hall is lined with portraits of those who led the movement against the British. But how amateurishly all of them are painted! It is surprising that the authorities had commissioned them. The library has a precious collection but with only one person being in charge, it makes research a very difficult proposition indeed.

 Sarbeswar Nayak,

 Khardah. 

 The stretch of Humayun Kabir Sarani outside BP Poddar Hospital, in New Alipore, is in a sorry state. The road is riddled with potholes, making it difficult for old and ailing patients to make it to the hospital without aggravating their injuries. I request the authorities concerned to repair the road at the earliest, to avoid any untoward incident. 

 Gunjeet Wadhwa, 

 Rai Bahadur Road. 

 I was pleasantly surprised that soon after the publication of my letter in this column on April 27, complaining of lack of illumination in the Dum Dum underpass, the lights were reinstalled. I hope measures are taken to ensure that they are not stolen again, especially because the area is home to many a vagrant.

 Dripping of water at one end of the tunnel and flouting of rules by private buses, unfortunately, continue right under the noses of policemen posted there. 

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Baguiati. 

 Alcohol and drugs are openly sold every evening in areas adjoining the Bagmari bazaar. On special occasions like Durga puja, Kali puja and Holi, the contraband items are sold even during the daytime.

 School and college students frequent Bagmari bazaar as a number of tutorials are located in the area. Many of them can become addicts and the government would be responsible for that.

 I fail to understand how drug-peddlers continue to operate in the locality with the Maniktala police station only half a kilometre away. 

 Suman Kumar Chatterjee,

 Maniktala Main Road.

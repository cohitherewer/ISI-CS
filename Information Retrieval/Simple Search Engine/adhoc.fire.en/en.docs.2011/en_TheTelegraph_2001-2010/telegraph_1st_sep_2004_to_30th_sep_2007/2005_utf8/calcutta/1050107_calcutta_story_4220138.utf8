The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

While you bask in the mellow winter afternoon or evening, 

here?s something to keep the gathering going?

Tsunami succour

If you haven?t yet contributed to the tsunami fund, 

do so before you run out of excuses. If some donors of an odd dime try to play 

Michael Schumacher, you can?t possibly be left behind in the race for charity, 

can you? Compare notes on celeb contribution if you haven?t been able to churn 

out impressive amounts, however. ?Schumacher is in a different lane, man. The 

chap is contributing more than some nations are offering!?

The 10-million-dollar drive can set you off on a bitchy 

bumpy ride into superstar stinginess.

?Billy baby (Bill Gates, of course) better add to 

his three million dollars now? Our Bollywood big guys are all on the ?take?, they 

just can?t give? Who would have thought Vivek Oberoi would turn out to be the 

real hero??

Yet more

You can get high on Pepsi for a change. Suddenly, 

everybody is asking for a little more. A film named after the soft drink tagline 

has run into rough weather if you please. Dil Maange More, starring Shahid 

Kapur and Soha Ali Khan, has fallen flat in the first week of its release but 

the Pepsi slogan sure added fizz to our very own Bangla band Lakkhichhara that 

registered its biggest ever hit with Jibon chaiche aaro beshi...

Winter where

As you stow away your colourful stoles a little too 

early, you can?t do without wondering aloud whatever happened to the winter chill. 

?It?s gone before it?s even started,? will be a common pique. But you can score 

more shine by waxing eloquent about the anti-cyclonic upper-air circulation that 

is blocking the North Wind and lifting the mercury.

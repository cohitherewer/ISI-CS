 Hostage Roma recounts horror

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Roma Jhawar gave a statement under Section 164 in the court of the Bidhannagar sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) on Thursday. 

 During the statement before first class judicial magistrate Bipasha Mondal, Roma gave a blow-by-blow account of the kidnap drama.

 ?Over a span of four hours, she gave us a detailed account of what happened after she was kidnapped,? said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general (operations), Criminal Investigation Department (CID). 

 ?We hope to nail all the accused, including mastermind Gunjan Ghosh, on the basis of Roma?s statement,? the deputy inspector-general added.

 Roma, in a blue salwar-kameez, was brought by CID sleuths to the SDJM?s court in Mayukh Bhavan around noon, amidst tight security. 

 On arrival, she was immediately whisked away into the magistrate?s room. Roma?s elder brother Rajesh and sister-in-law Sunita arrived in a separate car a little later.

 Roma gave her statement in English. ?She is smart. She was totally unruffled and recounted the night?s incident. She named all those whom she had seen on that night,? sources said.

 While Roma was giving the statement, Rajesh and Sunita waited in another room on the court premises. 

 ?We want the guilty to be punished and that is why we are here,? Rajesh said. 

 Family members of 20-year-old Roma said she had fared well in her B.Sc Part II examinations.

 Around 4 pm, Roma was was led out of the court through a back door, with a bunch of mediapersons in pursuit. ?I want the guilty to get what they deserve,? she said, before getting into the waiting car.

 On February 24, Roma had identified Gunjan Ghosh, prime accused in the case, Munna and Bikash Sau during an identification parade at Dum Dum jail, in the presence of judicial magistrate Bipasha Mondal. 

 She had, however, failed to identify accused Guddu. 

 Mukesh Singh, another accused in the abduction case, has expressed his willingness to give a confessional statement before the magistrate. He had earlier refused to give his statement.

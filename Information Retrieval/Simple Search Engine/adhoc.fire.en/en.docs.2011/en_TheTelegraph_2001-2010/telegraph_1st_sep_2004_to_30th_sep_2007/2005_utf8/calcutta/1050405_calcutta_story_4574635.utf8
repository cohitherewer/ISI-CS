 The City Diary

 Six 

major local cable channels joined hands on Monday to announce that they would 

stop airing astrology, Feng Shui and other ?unscientific? programmes. We did not 

want to air these programmes but were forced to as they generate significant revenue,? 

admitted Abhijit Dasgupta, of the West Bengal Association for Better Television 

Broadcast, an umbrella organisation of Bangla Ekhon, ATN, Taaza TV, Spandan, Sristi 

and Sonar Bangla. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had recently expressed 

concern over the astrology programmes aired on local cable channels. He also announced 

that the law department would examine whether the channels could be prosecuted. 

ccording to the forum, multi-system operators (MSOs) are to be blamed, as they 

charge exorbitant rates ? between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 4 lakh ? as ?carriage fee? 

for placing the channels on their networks. It is difficult for us to pay so much 

and we have written to the chief minister for intervention. We are planning to 

stop all such programmes Poila Boisakh onwards,? Dasgupta said. he forum 

is also trying to negotiate with MSOs for uniform placement rates for all cable 

channels.

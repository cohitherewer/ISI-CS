The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stadium spruce-up panel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has constituted a high-power committee to oversee all preparations in the run-up to the WTA Sunfeast Open tennis tournament, scheduled to be held in mid-September at Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, finance minister Asim Dasgupta, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, footballer Chuni Goswami and Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly will be patrons of the committee.

 Other members of the panel, chaired by the sports minister, include PWD minister Amar Choudhury, sports secretary Ashok Patnaik, PWD secretary Kalyani Chowdhury, tennis veteran Jaideep Mukerjea and officials from Mahesh Bhupathi?s management company, Globosport.

 ?Globosport, the organiser of the tournament, is planning to turn the event into an annual affair. We?ll do our best to showcase Calcutta through this tournament,? urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said at Writers? Buildings on Wednesday. 

 Earlier in the day, the minister accompanied Bhupathi on an inspection of the indoor stadium.

 In addition to repairs to the ceiling and improvement of the air-conditioning system in the stadium, the Rs 6-crore project will include construction of additional locker rooms for players, toilets, a players? arena, a new turf and a telephone corner. The government has already sanctioned Rs 5 crore for the project.

 ?I will speak to the finance minister about another Rs 70 lakh that we need for the remaining work. The stadium will have three courts for players to warm up and practise. Officials from the WTA will soon arrive to inspect the venue,? minister Bhattacharya said.

 Participants of the tournament are expected to arrive in the city by September 14 for the qualifying rounds, which will be played from September 15 to 17. ?ITC has agreed to sponsor the Rs 5-crore tournament and will spend Rs 2.5 crore on it,? Bhattacharya said. 

 The enthusiasm in the air has not spared the minister, either. ?I?ve started playing with Jaideep (Mukerjea) at South Club. I must say that the sport requires a lot of stamina,? he signed off.

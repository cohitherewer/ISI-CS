The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Set to catch Satch 

 - Satriani?s 

sunday sarobar show 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Joe Satriani

 He filled in for the legendary Ritchie Blackmore of heavy metal pioneers Deep Purple, and was handpicked by Mick Jagger to tour with him Down Under. Now guitar god Joe Satriani, ?Satch? to fans, is ready to surf with Calcutta and fly it away in a blue dream.

 Come Sunday (May 15), the city will rock to the strains of Satch?s Ibanez guitar and soak in the Strange Beautiful Music created by the Joe Satriani Band, featuring Joe on guitars, Jeff Campitelli on drums, Matt Bissonette on bass and Galen Henson on additional guitar.

 Rabindra Sarobar Stadium is the second stop on Satriani?s three-gig Indian tour, his first visit to this country, which kicks off at the MMRDA Grounds in Mumbai on May 13. Bangalore?s Palace Grounds, home to some of the recent big-bang shows, will host the fitting finale on May 17.

 Calcutta has hosted the likes of the late Shawn Lane, Jonas Hellborg, Steve Topping and the great John McLaughlin of late. But it missed its date with the Stones by a whisker and was ignored by big-ticket mainstream acts like Roger Waters, Mark Knopfler, Bryan Adams and Ian Anderson. The Satriani show could be the biggest redemption rendezvous, and the city?s classic rock cognoscenti is understandably excited.

 ?It?s not a question of Calcutta not having an audience or the money for giant acts like this. The problem has always been a lack of infrastructure support link with the organiser, which, nine out of 10 times, is DNA. Once a local agency succeeds in pulling off a strong show in conjunction with a national biggie, we will be on our way. The Satriani show could do wonders to Calcutta?s brand image,? says Nondon Bagchi.

 For Satriani, who started the G3 guitar showcase tour with Steve Vai in 1996, and is now touring to promote his latest studio album, Is there Love in Space, the Indian sojourn holds out a special significance. ?India is a country of music lovers and I have always wanted to play here. I am waiting to meet all my fans in India at my concert,? he says ahead of the kick-off.

 Cyrus Gorimar, director, Opium Events, the agency responsible for bringing the guitar great to India and working on the ground with the Celebrity Management Group for the Calcutta show, says: ?Joe Satriani is not just the god of guitars, but an icon among all musicians. There have been many artistes who came down to India when they were past their prime, but we are getting Joe bang after the release of his latest album, which is already making ripples around the world.?

 Satriani is one of the most technically accomplished and widely respected guitarists and guitar teachers of the modern era. Inspired by Jimi Hendrix (Electric Ladyland is among his favourite albums), he taught the likes of Kirk Hammett (Metallica), Slash (Guns N? Roses), Steve Vai, Larry LaLonde (Primus), David Bryson (Counting Crows) and jazz-fusion player Charlie Hunter.

 Surfing with the Alien, Flying in a Blue Dream, One Big Rush (Say Anything ? OST), The Extremist and the Grammy-nominated Engines of Creation are among his most significant albums.

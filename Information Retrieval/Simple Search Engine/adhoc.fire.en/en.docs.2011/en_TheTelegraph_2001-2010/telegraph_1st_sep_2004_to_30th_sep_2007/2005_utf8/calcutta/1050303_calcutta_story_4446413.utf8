 Not far from the ceasefire at the Lakes, a spurt of violence sparked by the mystery death of a 17-year-old girl singed Bhowanipore early on Wednesday.

 Fuelled by loose talk of sexual assault having led to the death, residents raided a multi-storeyed building on Ramesh Mitra Road after the domestic help was found hanging from a pipe on the roof. The mob fury left a wake of destroyed window panes and vehicles.

 Sunita Sau was working as a maid for Rajkumar Agarwal, a trader living on the fourth floor of Sapna Apartment, at 20A, Ramesh Mitra Road, for the past seven months.

 The teenager would often stay over, instead of returning home to a slum in the adjoining Chakraberia Road (South).

 A tenant of the apartment went up on the roof around 7 am on Wednesday and found Sunita hanging from the pipeline. A team from Bhowanipore police station took her to SSKM Hospital, where she was declared brought dead. The body was then sent for post-mortem.

 The police said there was no whiff of assault or murder. ?It is a case of suicide. We have launched an investigation into the matter,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner (headquarters) at Lalbazar.

 As news of Sunita?s death spread, a mob from the nearby slum gathered around 9 am and started pelting stones at Sapna Apartment. Almost all window panes of the building, on the Ramesh Mitra Road side, were damaged.

 A Maruti Suzuki parked in front of the apartment was torched. The mob went on to damage four motorcycles and two more cars.

 A force from Bhowanipore police station did little to stop the mob from going on the rampage, alleged witnesses. ?They were standing around doing nothing; it was almost as if they were watching the fun,? complained Babulal Jain, a resident of Sapna Apartment. 

 His room was strewn with stones, shattered glass and broken utensils.

 With violence spiralling, the local police station asked for reinforcements from Lalbazar. A van from the police headquarters reached the spot and cops resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob. Two fire engines were pressed into action.

 ?The trouble continued till 10 am. They were pelting stones and attacking cars. We were so scared we couldn?t go near the windows,? said Nisha Agarwal, sister-in-law of Rajkumar Agarwal.

 ?A police picket was posted in front of the apartment. Four persons were arrested from the spot,? a police officer later said at Lalbazar.

 Rajkumar Agarwal, head of the Agarwal family, had left the city early on Monday, revealed a family friend.

 Bhowanipore police later picked up his wife Sudha, son Amit and brother Rajesh. ?The three have been detained,? said deputy commissioner (south) Anuj Sharma. 

 Sunita, working for the Agarwals for the past seven months, was being paid Rs 700 per month, said a friend of the family.

 Birbahadur Sau, Sunita?s father, refused to take the police line of suicide. 

 ?They have killed my daughter,? he alleged, pointing an accusing finger at the Agarwal household.

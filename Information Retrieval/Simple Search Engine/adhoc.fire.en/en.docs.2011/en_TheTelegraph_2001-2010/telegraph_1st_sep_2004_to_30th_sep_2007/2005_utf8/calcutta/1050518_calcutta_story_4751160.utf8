The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Parking point for pilgrims

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come 2008, and pilgrim?s progress will have a new parking point in the city. The ?country?s first pilgrimage tourism park?, meant for national and international pilgrims travelling to east, Northeast and neighbouring countries, is scheduled to come up in the heart of south Calcutta.

 Mahanirban Pilgrimage Park will be located opposite Triangular Park, off Rashbehari Avenue, on a 2.3-acre plot which currently houses Mahanirban Math. 

 ?We have submitted the feasibility report to the government and applied for other clearances, including environment,? says K.P. Dasgupta, secretary of the trustee board of Mahanirban Math, the landowner and joint developer of the project.

 Once approved by the government, the report will be forwarded to the ministry of tourism, seeking subsidies under the Large Revenue Generating Tourism Projects assistance policy.

 The Rs 35-crore project would be developed and operated on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) system, without transfer of land and facility. Trustee members hope the park will resuscitate the 110-year-old heritage institute from ?severe financial constraints, affecting all present functions?.

 The park complex will have an 11-storeyed building with 400 beds and a vegetarian spread. There will be a green cover, a waterbody and a combination of laser and halogen illumination (see graphic).

 ?Mahanirban Pilgrimage Park will be an international tourism destination, providing logistical and transit facilities to pilgrims arriving in Calcutta,? observes Dasgupta.

 A meditation hall, library, yoga centre and sabhaghar will offer Vedic and naturopathy healthcare. ?Calcutta is the gateway to destinations like Ganga Sagar, Kalighat, Belur, Mayapur, the Buddhist monasteries of North Bengal, Bodh Gaya, Puri, Kamakhya and pilgrimage sites in Bhutan and Nepal,? says K.K. Datta of Modular, the project consultant. ?According to our study, the tourists will prefer a place with spiritual ambience, vegetarian food and meditation and yoga facilities, over business hotels.?

 The project has already invited its share of controversy, with the local Youth Congress unit alleging violation of heritage and environmental norms, something the math authorities have rubbished.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Myriad means for Bollywood dreams

 One wants to run around trees. The other prefers crawling on beaches. As different as they get, tinsel town rsquo;s latest debutantes, 

 MINISSHA LAMBA and NISHA KOTHARI, spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about their forays into filmdom

 Minissha Lamba in Yahaan

 MINISSHA LAMBA 

 Where from: I am an English honours student from Miranda college in Delhi. I did some modelling assignments before I got to appear in the Cadbury commercial directed by Shoojit Sircar. It was during the making of that ad film that Shoojit narrated to me the idea of Yahaan and wanted me to play the female lead. So rather than struggling in Mumbai, my life-changing moment happened while studying in college in Delhi. After that I did a workshop with theatre stalwart M. K. Sharma before stepping on to the sets of my first film.

 Start me up: From the first to the last day of the Yahaan shooting schedule, I had butterflies in my stomach, which I feel is a must for all actors. Every scene was a new challenge. To do so many things ? taking the light, being aware of the camera angle, understanding the position and the movement ? was like a matrix equation for me. But I got more comfortable as the days went by and I started taking lesser and lesser instructions from Shoojit. 

 Worth it: I have stayed in Kashmir with my family for two years and so shooting there for Yahaan was like homecoming for me. To me, the film is a commercial love story set against the backdrop of a disturbed Kashmir. Having watched the film so many times I have lost perspective on my performance. But I genuinely feel that I could have done much better. The role was never meant for a newcomer ? it was for a seasoned actress like Kajol or Rani Mukherjee. I am really lucky that it landed in my lap. 

 Skin show: It is a very niche market. For every five family films there is a skin flick. That?s definitely not the only kind of film that is happening in Bollywood. As for me, I wouldn?t fit the type ? I can?t play what I am not. Just imagine how Preity Zinta would look doing that kind of role? Skin show is just not my cup of tea.

 Road ahead: I am here to stay in Bollywood. I am prepared to do all kinds of films ? commercial or arthouse? whatever appeals to me. I want to work with everyone from Sanjay Leela Bhansali to Govind Nihalani, with every banner from Yash Raj to Mukta Arts. I have no problem in doing the jhatkas and matkas. I have no problem in running around trees? that?s our tradition. I want a career out of films for the next 10 years. So I have to do everything.

 NISHA KOTHARI 

 Nisha Kothari, the James ebutante 

 Where from: I was born and brought up in a village called Majdia near Bangladesh, a two-hour drive from Calcutta. But I moved to Delhi when I was six years old. I completed my studies there and did my graduation in chemistry honours from Delhi University. Right from childhood, ever since I can remember, I wanted to be an actress. So, after getting my pictures clicked and portfolio done in Delhi, I moved to Mumbai to get into films. 

 Start me up: The Chadti jawani music video happened and I also did some modelling assignments. Then I went to Ramu Sir?s office. He was then casting for James. He looked at my pictures, liked them and just cast me in the film. He didn?t take any audition. He just asked me some casual questions and I was in. Then after the first song picturised on me (Zindagi jeene ka naam hai) was ready, Ramu Sir saw it and asked me to do the role in Sarkar.

 Worth it: The reason I did that role in Sarkar was because the film in itself was very big. One couldn?t reject a magnum opus like that. I believe there?s no such thing called small characters, there are only small actors. Who will say no to a project involving Ramuji and Amitji? I was so privileged just to share the frame with Amitabh Bachchan. On the day of the shooting I was very nervous and thought to myself whether I should just look at him since he would be off soon. But he made me feel at ease and things went smoothly.

 Skin show: In James, I play a model and I have four songs picturised on me. And my character of Nisha is a modern girl and girls these days do wear small tops and skirts. There?s nothing vulgar about it... I know I do not look vulgar wearing those clothes. I, of course, have my reservations and limits. I wouldn?t wear short clothes without reason. But when you are a heroine you have to look beautiful and glamourous. Come on, you can?t wear a sari on the beach.

 Road ahead: I have just started my journey in Bollywood ? James and Sarkar are the first steps. I want to be part of wonderfully executed films. I am also doing another Ram Gopal Varma production called Go, opposite a newcomer and directed by a debutant. But I am ready to work outside the Factory too. I can even speak, read and write Bengali. So maybe I would even do a Bengali film.

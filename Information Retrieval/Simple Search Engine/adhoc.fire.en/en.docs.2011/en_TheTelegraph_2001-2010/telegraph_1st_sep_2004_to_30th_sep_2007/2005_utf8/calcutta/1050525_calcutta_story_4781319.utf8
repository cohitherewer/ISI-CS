The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 SUBRATA MUKHERJEE

 Mayor, Calcutta Municipal Corporation

 The Corporation stays closed for 70-80 days. Add to that 52 Saturdays. How many days are left then for work? Once poll dates draw near, work stops weeks in advance. If polls are held every year, one board will splurge and the next will have to repay the debt. Infrastructure projects take time to get completed. For instance, Ranikuthi booster pumping station took two-and-a-half years to be ready, Bagmari took four-and-a-half years, Kasba 18 months. The renovation of Star theatre required 15 months. None of these projects therefore would be possible in a single-year tenure. Only maintenance will then be possible, not infrastructure development. Moreover, election means expenditure. So there will be unnecessary wastage of public money.

 A dialogue between tradition and the art 

of today

 - The twain together

 Dialogues between two apparently disparate disciplines often result in the twain trying to see one through the other?s eye and making an effort to understand each other?s language. Thereby, they energise one another. 

 This is what a workshop entitled Transmigration organised by CIMA Gallery from May 2 to 8 tried to achieve by asking contemporary city-based artists to interact and collaborate with artisans and craftsmen who are used to working within the parameters set by tradition.

 Memory was the overall theme they were to work on, and though many of the creations are still at a nascent stage, the finished ones as well as some that could provide some idea of the concepts that shaped them were on display at the gallery on Monday evening. The workshop afforded the urban artists, whose training and outlook is more or less Eurocentric, the opportunity to experiment with traditional disciplines, techniques and tools. 

 The tradition-bound artisans too were allowed a breather ? they could, if they wished to, break free from the shackles of tradition. But as some artisans admitted, they are so taken up with the job of providing for themselves and their families that they hardly have any time to think up original concepts. But they did try, some with reasonable success. 

 Pranab Bhaskar of Burdwan carves wooden figures of deities. He said his heritage does matter most to him but he is trying to introduce change. Sculptor Bimal Kundu and he created a miniature Trojan horse. The concept was Bimal?s. The mane was crafted by Pranab. A box of Kashmir apples that could be grenades was Bimal?s creation. Bimal said he got the courage to work fast by watching the skilled craftsmen giving speedy finishing touches.

 Kartik Sutradhar of Garhjoypur off Purulia, who makes Chhou masks, worked with Hiran Mitra. Mitra said he thought that their practices would overlap but Kartik felt no need to challenge tradition. So Mitra will try to give his work the form of a performance.

 Tapas Konar and pata artist Swarna Chitrakar together painted a large canvas of a man and a woman. Konar said this experience will catalyse a process of experimentation, even with dying techniques.

 A Gambhira mask with a narrative, not the done thing really, was what Shankar Das, who carves deities out of gamar wood, produced. Abhijit Gupta sculpted a mask out of a block of wood. Together they created a whimsical Ganesh with the leg of table as its proboscis.

 Sribas Chandra Chand of Midnapore makes lac toys. Samir Aich created a fibreglass torso with niches for displaying pretty heads created by this old artisan. He himself created a fibreglass shield, which when complete will be backlit and displayed. 

 Cinema hoarding painting is a dead art. So Subrata Sen has moved to Mumbai creating paintings on canvas for interiors using the same techniques. He and Manas Acharya together created a work appropriating popular images from Bollywood and juxtaposing these with images from classic international cinema. 

 Gopinath Roy teaches sculpture. He used the technique of sandcasting to create an imaginary landscape. With dhokra artisan Rameshwar Karmakar of Bankura he created a vision of tsunami. This dialogue will be an ongoing process and it will be interesting to see what this will lead to. Once complete, all the works will be exhibited in mid-July.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cooking with the master chef

 Imparting a ?twist? to the traditional makhni with a green-tomato gravy that elicits reactions of ?why didn?t I think of it?? from the rapt audience. Introducing a special tikki from western Uttar Pradesh to a city that has ?always loved its chaats?. Whipping up an ?express soup? that requires no grinding or straining, and marrying the gulab jamun with chocolate?

 All during a high-octane three hours of interactive culinary trek that gives Calcuttans a platform to rub shoulders with the country?s most celebrated chef and grill him while in action.

 Sanjeev Kapoor, whose Khana Khazana is Indian television?s most successful cookery show, loves coming back to this city, because ?Calcutta?s passion for food fascinates? him.

 This Saturday, he will conduct his annual cookery workshop at his signature Camac Street world-cuisine stop Grain of Salt (on the terrace gardens from 4 pm). To be held for the fourth year on the trot, the extravaganza gives participants the chance to witness live demonstration of five to six recipes that encompass an entire meal ? from appetisers to main course to dessert, culminating in high tea and wine.

 ?People want to actually learn how to cook and they want to learn it live. But more importantly, this interface provides us with a vehicle to reach out to our diners, listen to them and build a bond. It helps us in cuisine correction and also in initiating new diners to our format,? the master chef tells GoodLife from Mumbai.

 Calcutta has always been extremely open to experimentation with its food, feels Kapoor. ?It?s not fair if we say the Calcutta market has evolved over the past few years. The market potential was always there, the opportunities weren?t. Now that the city has been exposed to so many different kinds of eating-out formats, it?s lapping it up with elan,? he observes.

 Kapoor 

 stresses that Grain of Salt (in picture above) has been ?an eye-opener?, and that he had underestimated Calcutta?s capability to adopt and embrace new concepts. He rates the city next only to Mumbai on the culinary acceptance count (see box).

 ?We were trying out alien elements and were understandably apprehensive. For instance, we were a fifth-floor restaurant and without a view. The d?cor was minimalist and the spread a blend of global cuisine. But Calcutta showed its true colours and gave us an emphatic thumbs-up, which shows it was up and ready for it,? he declares.

 At the same time, chef Kapoor is alive to the need to constantly reinvent. ?As you go ahead, the gap may reduce. Nonetheless, if a correction is required, no matter how minuscule, it has to be carried out. That?s another reason why customer feedback is so important. Calcutta is compassionate and will give you a second chance, but you must be aware of your quality commitment as well,? he points out.

 The cookery show in town, which attracts 250-300 participants every year, is a recipe repartee the chef looks forward to.

 ?They have shown great awareness and the questions are more often than not quite intelligent. Sometimes, I know they are testing my knowledge, but I love it all the same. It?s great fun,? he signs off.

 Flashback bash

 Grooving to tunes from 

 the past can be a lot of fun, says Ipsita Deb

 Taking a ride back in time should be done with flair, pomp and style. While its physically impossible to rewind to the yesteryears ? we arent talking Back to the Future here ? a theme bash can turn back time, if only for one night.

 A retro party is essentially one that takes you through the highs of an earlier time with slices of the kind of fun in terms of music, style and ambience of that time, says Namrata Ray, manager, events, The Park.

 Disco d?cor

 For the d?cor, the focus should be on the chosen era. For the look of the 80s ? that of a budding disco generation ? there should be emphasis on the lighting. Psychedelic floors with lights beneath them and mirrored walls are important, says Bunti Sethi of Starstruck Retro Lounge. 

 If you want to go back further in time and need a clearer visual impact, pin up posters on the walls with stars of decades past, like Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Greta Garbo.

 Timeless tunes

 Retro is my favourite kind of music. Theres so much music that falls into the category and such evergreen tunes. Retro is the kind of music that people can sing along and relate to. There was a time when there were discos and disco music that can never be replaced, says DJ Lloyd of B.E.D. 

 So what are the five must-have tracks on Lloyds list for a retro evening? Michael Jacksons Dont stop till you get enough, Madonnas Like a prayer, Bee Gees You should be dancing, the Flashdance title track What a feeling and Fleetwood Macs Little lies.

 Glam garb

 Bring on the glam factor with oodles of attitude while making a retro style statement. Guest involvement in terms of the dress code is essential. The hairdos of the 80s, shades, flared pants, bell bottoms or extra-tight pants like those donned by Olivia Newton John in Grease and frilly shirts are great to start with, says Sethi. 

 Designer Priyanjali Ray prefers the 40s and 50s look where its all about femininity, elegance and glamour. Bright colours, lots of frills and ruffles and striking accessories complete the back-in-time package. 

 Basic bites

 On the food front, it should be a take on authentic items. If its crepes youre serving, stick to the Italian recipe, even if the stolen French one might taste a tad better, while those wanting to bring in an Indian flavour can opt for chicken tikkas minus the cheese filling or garnishing. 

 People today are forgetting 

 the original recipes of many items and changing them so 

 much as to make them almost unrecognisable. A retro party 

 is the perfect opportunity to bring back authentic food, 

 says Surinder Singh, executive chef of Taj Bengal. So do 

 your shopping in advance and get hold of a book of traditional 

 recipes. 

 Star sip

 Last but not least, one of the crucial ingredients for the evening to keep the spirits high ? alcohol. A retro party is all about a time when shooters werent the order of the day, though shots may have been. Scotch on the rocks, wine and pink champagne might find pride of place. 

 To add some spunk, stick to everyones favourite drinks and spice them up with catchy names, says bartender Rajnish of The Park. So, let it be the Bloody Monroe instead of the Bloody Mary and Tom Jones instead of the spirited Collins counterpart.

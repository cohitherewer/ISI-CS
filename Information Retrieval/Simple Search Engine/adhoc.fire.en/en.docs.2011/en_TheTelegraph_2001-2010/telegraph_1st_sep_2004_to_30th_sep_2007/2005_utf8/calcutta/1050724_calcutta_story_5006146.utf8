The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Late off the blocks but on a roll down 

 the lane

 Club Sandwich

 The pins are not going down in 

 an avalanche yet. Nor does Calcutta have midnight bowling 

 or bowling for honeymooners and dating couples yet.

 Nonetheless, the nascent sport, 

 which boasts an active city fraternity of a mere hundred, 

 scored an emphatic strike with the hosting of the Eastern 

 India Bowling Championships, a qualifying meet for the nationals, 

 held at Space Circle on July 22 and 23.

 The screening tourney sent four 

 men and two women from the east to the Mumbai nationals, 

 to be held in September, featuring 48 participants. The 

 nationals, in turn, will pick the country?s champion lady 

 and gentleman bowler and propel them to the AMF World Bowling 

 Championships slated for Slovenia in October this year.

 ?It?s an important feather in 

 our cap and a tournament like this can go a long way in 

 popularising bowling as a sport, which can be played by 

 anyone from 10 to 75 years of age,? says Space Circle CEO 

 M.J. Robertson.

 East?s representatives to the 

 nationals were chosen through two days of trials, where 

 the mean score of 12 games was considered.

 Space, the only city club which 

 offers indoor bowling, holds a monthly competition for men, 

 women and juniors, besides a Merchants Cup meet every year. 

 Nicco Bowlers? Den and Sparkz are the other two facilities 

 where one can walk in and play a round or few.

 ?In India, it?s still a young 

 sport, and there are only 45 facilities across the country. 

 Calcutta has been late off the blocks, but is now catching 

 up and many youngsters are discovering the joys of this 

 highly addictive sport,? says 22-year-old Sanam Arora, who 

 has been going to the nationals from here for the past couple 

 of years.

 Robertson feels the sport has 

 remained beyond the reach of many, thanks to the prohibitive 

 import duties on equipment.

 ?Setting up just one lane here 

 costs around Rs 25 lakh, as opposed to Rs 12 lakh in the 

 US. We as a club can afford to keep our charges as low as 

 Rs 25 for a round, since we had factored in the cost of 

 the four-lane alley in our masterplan, but it could be tough 

 for standalone places,? he observes.

 For those who are not members 

 at any facility, a walk-in round of bowling could cost around 

 Rs 75, and quite naturally, the ?elitist? tag has stuck.

 ?Earlier, bowling was taken as 

 a parallel to fine-dining, with the cost being so prohibitive. 

 Now, that perception is slowly changing,? stresses Prashant 

 Kanoria, representative of Kubica AMF (global leaders in 

 bowling equipment manufacturing) in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, 

 Bhutan and Iran.

 Kanoria, who had accompanied Robertson 

 to the Pattaya world championships in 2001 ?to learn how 

 to manage a bowling alley?, feels earlier, bowling centres 

 tried to simply ?milk customers? without attempting to popularise 

 the sport and ?look at the bigger picture?. Now, there?s 

 an effort to set up the Bengal 10-Pin Bowling Association 

 to broad-base the appeal of the sport.

 ?What?s important is the right 

 packaging so that bowling can contribute both as an entertainment 

 option and a sport in the long-term. For instance, in the 

 UK, one can bowl all day long for just seven pounds at some 

 places,? Robertson points out, advocating novel formats 

 and a city league to provide further impetus.

 ?And of course, product support 

 has to improve dramatically for the centres to stay viable. 

 After all, if a lane is down, you?ve got to repair it NOW.?

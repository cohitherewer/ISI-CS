The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 What is the because

 There was a time when the medium was 

 the message. Today, the advertising itself is the reason why

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 I 

 find a lot of similarity between the two ? morning walk 

 and advertising. You go for your morning constitutional 

 for many reasons. Doctors tell you that it is good for your 

 heart, stomach or whatever. Mr Kapoor, your next-door neighbour, 

 does it so you feel guilty every time you meet him in the 

 lift. If you have been out that morning, your wife is a 

 bit tolerant in the evening when you pour your fourth large. 

 Most importantly, you feel good. When you return home and 

 sit down to drink the morning tea with the day?s paper in 

 front of you, there is an unmistakable feeling of holiness. 

 A holier than thou perception if you like.

 Advertising is often triggered 

 by similar sentiments. Others in the business are doing 

 it and so you must do it. Or better still, somebody else 

 did it and waxed eloquent about the dividends he got and 

 you ask yourself why am I not doing it? Then there is the 

 domestic angle too. You go to a party and your friends and 

 acquaintances start discussing the latest Shah Rukh or Sachin 

 ad. Your wife participates. Later that night, when the lights 

 have been put off, you hear the famous last words: you said 

 you are the big boss in a big business, how come no one 

 talks about your brands? Next morning, you call your advertising 

 agency.

 These are enjoyable half-truths 

 that generate a lot of laughter in an office party. Yet 

 the undeniable fact is that these days advertising costs 

 a lot of money and decisions that cost so much can seldom 

 be taken too lightly. Indeed, there is usually a genuine 

 expectation that advertising would make people buy your 

 brand. So the attempt often is to provide a clear-cut reason 

 for the consumer to buy your brand. Buy this shampoo because 

 it makes your hair free of dandruff. Buy that shirt because 

 of imported fabric. Buy that car because it consumes the 

 least amount of petrol ? reasons that you can touch and 

 feel.

 Then there are other ads that 

 are more subtle. No overt claims, no specific promises; 

 may be a tug at the heartstrings, may be a bit of stoking 

 of envy or a gentle reminder of an ambition that you nurtured. 

 Be it the old Maruti 800 ad that showed the father and son 

 on their way to school feeling sorry for themselves or the 

 famous Hutch campaign that evoked more ?how cute? response 

 to the dog than the brand, these are all attempts to provide 

 an indirect albeit powerful motivation to buy a brand.

 Some do neither of these. Remember 

 Preity Zinta in the Perk ad. It shows her biting into the 

 bar and making an embarrassing noise. The physical instructor 

 misunderstands. Preity has taken her revenge. The teacher 

 did not allow her to join the class because she was late. 

 The rational being asks, pray tell me, what would be the 

 reason why I should buy the brand? You could ask the same 

 question about Shah Rukh doing a dance with bubbly, or the 

 mint chewing young man blowing a breath out. Yet the point 

 remains, crores are spent on airing these campaigns. They 

 could not be casual decisions.

 At one point of time they used 

 to say that the medium is the message. That may still be 

 true. But now an even bigger truth has dawned on us. The 

 advertising itself is the reason why. Why would the 

 brand need any other? Have fun, guys.

 Or else you would be like the 

 hapless guy in the Chloromint ad.

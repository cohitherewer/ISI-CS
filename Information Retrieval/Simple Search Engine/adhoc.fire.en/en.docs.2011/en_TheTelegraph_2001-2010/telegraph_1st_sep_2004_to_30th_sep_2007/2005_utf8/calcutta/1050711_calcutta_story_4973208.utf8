 Giving beer its due

 There is finally retribution to be had for the beer lover. Michael Jacksons Beer Companion gives the malted beverage ? widely taken for granited ? a status stamp it has sorely lacked.

 Examining the worlds great beer styles, gastronomy and traditions, the acknowledged guru of beer takes a trek through breweries around the world serving up a wide variety of the beverage.

 If you though you could only hold forth about wines and single malts in well-heeled company, Jacksons book (available at Crossword bookstore for Rs 595) sets out to prove otherwise.

 He starts out with basic beer etiquette. Asking for a bottle of beer is as appaling as asking for a plate of food, in Jacksons view. It is well understood that there are fine wines, but less widely appreciated that beer can be equally varied, complex and noble.

 The author blames beers bad name on poor image. He calls to attention the similarities between beer and that more respected fermentation ? wine. Like in the wine lovers guide to beer where he compares a dry wine to a Pilsner, the beer worlds chardonnay.

 Jackson further points out that beer, being lower in alcohol content than its spirited counterparts, is an inefficient means of getting drunk, though this may apply less to Indian brews than European and American ones.

 In terms of lineage, too, beer is largely misunderstood. The restorative beverage may go back in history to the very start of civilisation. 

 All said, Jackson then goes into a detailed examination of 50 classic styles and over 1,000 brews, concentrating mainly on Europe and the US.

 Ales, stouts, Trappists, barley wines, lambics, porters... the malted beverage comes in a wide spectrum of aromas, flavours and colours, depending on how the grain is fermented and aged. Some are even seasoned and spiced up with fruit or herb extracts.

 Finally, he ends his work with a list of beer recipes. Perfect grub for any pub.

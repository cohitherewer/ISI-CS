 It?s the centenary year of the partition of Bengal. And one of the unlikeliest elements is playing a part in bringing the two Banglas together.

 Rock Jugalbandi Part II is set to feature two music superstars from Bangladesh, along with groups from Calcutta, in a concert next week. James with his band Nagar Baul and Ayub Bachchu with his LRB will match beats with Chandrabindoo and Fossil at the Salt Lake helipad grounds on October 1.

 LRB (or Love Runs Blind) and Chandrabindoo had also played in the inaugural edition of Rock Jugalbandi last year, but it will be the ?first public performance? for James.

 ?He had performed at a private show for a Bengali channel sometime back in Calcutta and was really eager to do a proper concert,? said Soumen Paul of Idea Event Management, the organisers.

 James has over a dozen albums to his credit and a significant fan following in Bangladesh, while Ayub Bachchu has a career spanning several decades and is considered a rock legend in his country.

 Another highlight of the upcoming concert is a jam between percussionist Bikram Ghosh and Ayub Bachchu. ?It?s not often you see tabla featured with Bangla rock,? quipped Ghosh, who will also perform his Rhythmscape Show at Rock Jugalbandi. ?We will only get a day to rehearse and will try to create a structure for the jam,? he added.

 With the explosion of bands playing Bangla rock in the city, organisers expect the number of paying public to climb this time. 

 ?There were some issues, like ticket counterfeiting last time, which resulted in an attendance of over 20,000 but only around 10,000 tickets were sold. This time, we are putting checks in place and expect at least a crowd of 15,000,? offered Paul.

 A 60-ft background screen and laser lights are set to add to the fun.

 ?Eta amader arekta bari, jotobar dakben toto bar ashbo (This is our second home and well come every time you call),? Ayub Bachhu had promised last time at the end of his set. 

 Music enthusiasts in Calcutta will be glad he has kept it.

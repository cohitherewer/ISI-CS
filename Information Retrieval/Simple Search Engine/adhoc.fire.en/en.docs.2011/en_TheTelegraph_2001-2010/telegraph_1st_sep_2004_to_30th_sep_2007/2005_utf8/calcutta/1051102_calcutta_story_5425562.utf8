 Spurious alcohol factory

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Police on Tuesday sounded an alert in the northern parts of the city and suburbs after it chanced upon an illegal factory manufacturing methylated spirit in Belghoria and marketing it as liquor. 

 A team from Belghoria police station, along with excise department officers, raided the factory near Madrasi Lane, off the police station, around 11 am on Tuesday and found 3,000 bottles sporting labels of well-known brands of Indian-Made Foreign Liquor.

 While seven full bottles sported the label of a well-known Scotch, another 20 had labels of popular whisky brands. ?In addition, fake labels, caps and duplicate bottles of almost all well-known brands, like Volga, Teachers, Royal Stag, 8 PM and Johnny Walker, were lying around,? said a police officer.

 Prakash Acharya, who ran the factory, was arrested at the site. ?Acharya is from South India and he settled here about 18 months ago. Though he claims that he was functioning alone, we?re not convinced. We are looking for team members,? said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Pravin Kumar. 

 Kumar said the alcohol, which was bottled, was actually methylated spirit, which is highly poisonous. Artificial colours and fragrance had been added to make it resemble alcohol.

 The racket had been operational for over a year. ?We?re worried that a significant number of bottles has gone out, maybe even to wine shops in the city and the suburbs,? said Pervez Siddiqi, additional magistrate, North 24-Parganas.

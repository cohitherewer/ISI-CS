Why Calcutta? I asked Annamaria Forgione, an 

Italian lady who has recently opened a branch of Fire and Ice, her restaurant 

in Kathmandu, in the city.

I wanted to open an outlet in India, she 

said. I also wanted to be part of a project involving rural women in producing 

mozzarella cheese locally. I could buy the cheese, teach them to make and they 

could gain from the arrangement as well. Also, somehow, Calcutta gave me a good 

feeling. I felt comfortable here.

So now in the city we have a branch of a celebrated 

Kathmandu eatery (it featured in Time magazine; Sting and Richard Gere 

are clients) and in Sonarpur on the southern outskirts they are producing mozzarella 

cheese.

Fire and Ice is located at the corner of Middleton 

Street and Chowringhee Road in Kanak Building, an old property with pillars, columns, 

thick walls and high ceilings. When you enter, the feeling is of space and light. 

The restaurant is well appointed and much of what the kitchen staff is upto is 

visible and the impression is of clean efficiency.

 There are shades of Kathmandu here, right from a 

first glance at the beverages selection ? choices such as Hut Lemon, Hot Lemon 

with Honey and Mint Iced Tea reminded me of of my first sojourn in Nepal ? a real 

hub of tourist traffic, people always on the move and on the lookout for clean, 

calorie-free, organic food.

Kathmandu, and the Thamel area of that city in particular, 

is full of interesting restaurants providing food for every international taste. 

People are searching for a taste of home and very little of the food is modified 

to suit the local palate, because the local palate is not what most 

restauranteers are catering to.

Most diners have busy itineraries and four or five-course 

meals are left to the interiors of the five-star hotels. Out in the city, people 

want clean, light food served up reasonably quickly. Of course, sometimes, you 

will see a group of people relaxing on the evening of a busy day of sightseeing, 

chatting away for a couple of hours over a leisurely meal.

Many of these elements are at work at Fire and Ice. 

No spices are used in the cooking ?only natural herbs. No bottled sauces where 

there may be chemical preservatives used, not even tomato ketchup. Vegetables 

and salad greens are of the best available quality and if it means sourcing items 

from Bangalore or Delhi or even importing them, it is done. 

On my first visit to Fire and Ice, I started with 

Hot Lemon with Honey. The weather was dismal; it had rained on the trot for three 

days and this was just what the doctor ordered. It cleansed the taste buds as 

well.

Then came pizza accompanied by a salad. The pizza 

was Paesana ? mozzarella, tomato sauce, bacon, spinach, zucchini, garlic and parmesan 

? and the salad was Insalata Mista ? Italian mixed salad with lettuce, tomato, 

cucumber, onion slices and lemon dressing.

I had ordered the salad because in my experience whenever 

I have had pizza I have needed something moist and cool to balance the dryness 

and saltiness of the pizza. This was actually unnecessary that day. The crust 

was thin and crisp till the very edge, which had blisters on it to show that the 

dough was just right. The ingredients on top were in correct proportions ? for 

me at least ? the presence of bacon not overstated, the spinach and zucchini giving 

it the right moisture and within minutes I had wolfed down half a pizza, without 

thinking.

The salad, delicious and clean tasting as it was with 

the green and red lettuce crunchy, the lemon dressing subtle and a surprise of 

grated carrots at the bottom, became almost an afterthought. 

There are 21 pizza selections on the menu. All are 

of the same size and 10 are vegetarian. Toppings for these include interesting 

ingredients like caramelised onion, eggplant trifolate and fried potatoes. Among 

the non-vegetarian pizzas, one one must try is Hawaiiana ? tomato sauce, mozzarella, 

ham, pineapple, green peppers, gingers and oregano.

Speaking for myself, I am thankful that there is no 

chance of running into tikka kebabs, cumin or coriander powder or turmeric 

in this place. And speaking for myself, these are the best pizzas in town.

I have so far tried three other items at Fire and 

Ice. Two soups and the very well known Spaghetti Bolognese.

I must confess that these items were takeaways and 

while the soups did not lose anything, this is not fair on the bolognese. Though 

there was nothing left of it, it should have been eaten when just made. 

The soups were Zuppa Di Verdura ? traditional Minestrone 

Soup with vegetables and pasta (spaghetti) and a simple chicken broth (like 

Grandma made it). Both were excellent and tasted just like homemade items. 

The minestrone really hit the spot; the chicken broth, aromatic and inviting, 

just a tiny shade too salty for me. 

They also have a selection of lasagna, but the final 

word must be for the ice-creams and the desserts, or how else is it a good Italian 

restaurant? The ice-creams are from Italy ? a small selection, vanilla and chocolate, 

with toppings of fruit flavours to choose from (rasp, kiwi fruit and cherry).

There are also crepes (shades of Kathmandu again) 

? with sugar/sugar and lemon/honey/ice-cream/nutella or bananas and nutella.

And Chocolate Mousse and Walnut Brownies and Homemade 

Apple Pie.

Fire and Ice is a welcome addition to the citys 

culinary map. In time, I feel it will become a favourite haunt. This will vindicate 

the fact the Naples (where Annamaria was raised) and Calcutta are considered twin 

cities.

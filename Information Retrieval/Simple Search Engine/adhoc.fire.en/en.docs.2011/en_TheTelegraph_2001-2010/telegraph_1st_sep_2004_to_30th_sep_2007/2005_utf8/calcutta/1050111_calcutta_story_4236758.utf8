 Kamal Kaur Makkar still suffers from nightmares, over two weeks after the tsunami tragedy. The dark circles under her eyes tell her story of sleepless nights more eloquently than words. 

 Every time a dog barks, she gets nervous. The mother of two is afraid to return home. Uppermost in her mind is the lack of medical facilities in the Andamans for those who have really suffered.

 ?I have not lost anything. It?s just the trauma. There are so many poor people who have lost everything. They need help,? she sighs, now safe in her parent?s home on Deshapran Sashmal Road. 

 Kamal and her family are residents of Port Blair, where her husband, Kulmohan Singh, owns two hotels. On December 24, the family went to their resort, Silver Sands, on Havelock Island, for a holiday. On December 26, Kamal and a friend went to the beach for a stroll at 6 am. 

 ?My sons were asleep. When my friend and I got to the beach, the dogs were barking so much that we got nervous. They wouldn?t let us near the water. So we went back to the hotel for yoga. Suddenly, I felt giddy, which is normal because I suffer from spondylitis. But she, too, felt the same. We stood up, but we reeled and fell. The ground started shaking and there was panic,? she recalls.

 Her husband woke up sons Tanveer and Jaikar. Everybody ran out as the earth shook. Then the waves crashed in. ?We saw the waves coming just as the tremors stopped. There?s a hill behind the resort, and we all just started running up it.?

 After the water receded, the boys returned to help their father at the resort. Although the property is about 200 metres inland from the beach ? ?that?s why we were saved? ? the restaurant, closest to the sea, was flooded. ?We removed the furniture so that it wouldn?t go under water,? says Tanveer. The 16-year-old?s pre-board exams started on Monday at Carmel Convent School, Port Blair, but his mother is too scared to let him go back.

 Till December 28, when the family returned to Port Blair, the days were dreary and the nights, sleepless at Havelock. ?We all stayed on the lawn, because there were constant tremors. There was no electricity, the water lines had burst and the telephone lines had been cut,? says Kamal.

 Back in Port Blair, the situation wasn?t much better. ?We live in a multi-storeyed building. My sister-in-law had jumped from the second floor when the quake hit. She has multiple fractures. Our home was a mess, with broken glass and books, cupboards and furniture strewn around. I cleaned up, took a few clothes and left.?

 The next three or four days were spent sleeping in the lobby of their hotel, Sentinal. ?It was like a community shelter, with everyone camping there. People slept on the streets because they were too scared to go back indoors.? 

 The boys put up a brave face, insisting on returning home. But the memories are still fresh. ?I fell off my bed twice after coming to Calcutta because I thought there was an earthquake. I could feel the ground shaking,? says a bewildered 11-year-old Jaikar.

 Kamal keeps returning to the topic of how helpless the local residents are. ?There is only one hospital, which is not enough. And some of the aid people are getting is unwanted. They don?t need clothes, they need fishing nets and boats so they can earn a living. Shops are open, but there is no business. They need tourists.?

 The boys echo the urgency. ?Water pipes have burst. There was a fight for drinking water in Aberdeen Bazaar, because people weren?t getting it.?

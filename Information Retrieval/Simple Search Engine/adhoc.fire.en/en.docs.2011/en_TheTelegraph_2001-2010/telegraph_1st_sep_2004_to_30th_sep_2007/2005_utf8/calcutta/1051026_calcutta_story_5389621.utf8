 This Diwali, if you are planning to add an ethnic touch to your home d?cor, then the newly-opened Cauvery at Swabhumi could be your destination of choice. Timeless treasures from the state of Karnataka await you at the store, part of the renowned southern chain.

 Run by the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation, the store houses a wide variety of furniture and home accessories. From jhoolas, cots, screens and sofa sets in rare rosewood to carved boxes, figurines and chariots in sandalwood, the collection is quite exquisite.

 You can choose from a range of idols and hanging lamps in bronze, vases and pitchers in bidri, durries and lacquered toys that make good gift options and also help add a touch of tradition to the interiors. 

 Wood wonders

 A gorgeous range of rosewood furniture meets the eye as soon as you step into this 3,000-sq ft showroom at the heritage park off the EM Bypass.

 This includes intricately carved partition screens, cabinets, centre tables, rocking chairs and divans with armrests in rosewood.

 The aesthetic value is enhanced with beautiful motifs, created by scooping out the flat surface of the rosewood and filling them with other varieties of wood in different hues to form various patterns.

 Good picks here could be the four-pillared carved jhoola priced at Rs 5.13 lakh and the princely sofa set that costs Rs 53,200 ? both reminders of bygone era.

 The partition screens with Krishnaleela designs are priced at Rs 34,200, the divans at Rs 41,800 and the dining table set with six chairs at Rs 1.14 lakh.

 Besides the heavy furniture, one also has an option to choose from a host of wall hangings, elephants, centre tables in rosewood priced at Rs 45,000-plus.

 Exquisite carvings in sandalwood, the signature work of artisans in Karnataka, adorn boxes, chariots, elephants, garlands, photo frames and much more. 

 Bronze beauty

 While bronze sculpting is an ancient art practised in many parts of south India, the work done in Karnataka differs from others in that it is more ornate.

 At Cauvery, exclusive bronze pieces like miniature figurines, Buddha statues and hanging lamps are a treat for the eyes.

 Prices start from Rs 4,500 and go up to Rs 18,000.

 Gift galore

 Knick-knacks made of bidri, lacquer and terracotta make exclusive gift items. 

 In bidriware, you can check out the vases, goblets and bangles, while you can go for flowerpots, diyas and painted lamp stands in terracotta.

 In laquerware there are pen holders, racing cars, coaster sets and bangle stands.

 The products here range between Rs 150 and Rs 1,000.

 Other attractions are the Navalgund durrie, priced at Rs 1,253 and batik elephants that bear a price tag of Rs 960.

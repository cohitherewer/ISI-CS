The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sinful Saturday makes a splash

If 

you thought Holi fever ended on Friday, revellers had reasons to disagree on Saturday 

night. Big Ben, the pub at The Kenilworth Hotel, kept up the mood of the wet-and-wild 

festival with a fashion show titled Splash, where models sashayed down the ramp 

in vibrant ensembles.

 ?If there is a festival on Friday, the festive mood tends to linger till the weekend, which is why the club chose this particular theme for the fashion show,? said a spokesperson for the hotel. 

 The event also provided a platform for upcoming designers like Amit, Debarun Mukherjee, Preeti Jhawar, Payal Kedia and Suman Mazumdar to showcase their creations before a packed house. 

 The designers each had a distinct style, texture and fabric palette. Almost all, however, displayed a range of wearable ensembles.

 ?There is no point disturbing people busy partying to showcase clothes they can never wear,? was the consensus among designers. Most collections fused western and traditional style. 

 From short kurtis (which are a rage again this season) to embroidered saris and vibrant churidars to elegant gowns, the crowd had quite an eyeful.

 Service shine

 Work hard, play harder. On Saturday night, Cloud 9 invited worker bees from the service sector to partake in a night of no-holds barred indulgence.

 Sin ? an inventive acronym for the service industry ? was the theme at the night-club, trying to corner the ever-expanding sector with significant disposable income. ?This class is fast becoming one of the biggest spenders in the party scene. They work hard by day and party harder at night. So our idea was to dedicate an evening of fun and frolic to this group,? said Cheena Vyas, owner of Sparkles, the event management firm behind the party.

 ?People from the hospitality sector, BPOs, IT and aviation industries have been invited,? added co-owner Riya Dewanji.

 Holi heat

 Tantra hosted two dance dhamakas ? Zabyn Khan and Nilofer Khan ? on Saturday night. Nilofer kicked off the sensuous act in Is Raat Ki Subah Nahi with a rendition of Choli ke peechhe, while Zabyn, the Gladrags Megamodel, turned up the heat several notches with the popular Dupatta beimaan.

 With the action in full swing, in between steamy sequences, a range of chart-toppers like Haadsa, Pyaar ka nasha and Saaki saaki were being spun out. 

 The final act was an altered version of the Page 3 hit Kua mein doob jaungi, with both the girls taking to the floor together.

 In keeping with the Holi spirit, a matka of thandai, mixed with alcohol was served to one and all.

 Food fiesta

 The launch bash of Yo Foodies, the food court at The Metropolis Mall at Hiland Park, attracted quite a few party regulars, despite the bad weather and distance from the heart of the city.

 The party kicked off at 7 pm and guests started trickling in after the trickle outside subsided. Actress June and ace painter Shuvaprasanna were spotted in the crowd, as guests were treated to some lip-smacking yummies. Bengali thalis, pastas, chaats, biryani, chicken tandoori, kebabs?drool and just dig in.

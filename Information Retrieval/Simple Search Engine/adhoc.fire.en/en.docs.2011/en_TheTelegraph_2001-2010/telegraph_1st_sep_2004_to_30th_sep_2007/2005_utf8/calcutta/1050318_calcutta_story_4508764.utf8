The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It?s time to have a ball

On stage or in the stadium stands, displaying creative 

talents, showcasing skills or cheerleading the champs, the youth of Calcutta were 

out in full force this week, exams notwithstanding. Young Metro clicks 

them in action.

What?s on your mind this week

Shout out Loud

Cricket crazy

The outcome of the first Test match between India 

and Pakistan at Mohali was proof of the saying ?stealing candy from a baby?. Despite 

a sterling performance put up by the Indians, they failed to take the lead in 

the series due to the gritty game played by Abdul Razzaq and Kamran Akmal. Kudos 

to the two Pakistani players for their resilient and dogged batting that literally 

brought Pakistan back from the jaws of defeat. Now, Inzy is perhaps more positive 

about the Test in progress in Calcutta, while fans get to watch some top-notch 

cricket. The only regret is that Sehwag?s swashbuckling stroke play and Balaji?s 

unerring accuracy with the red cherry failed to bear fruit due to some lacklustre 

bowling by the Indians on the fifth day. Lets hope Team India makes us proud with 

some good cricket this time round.

 In agreement

This is with reference to Rittika Bhattacharya?s letter, 

titled ?Present Perfect?, in Young Metro on March 11. I?m truly touched 

by her thoughts and feelings. I fully agree with every word she wrote. I identify 

with the message that she wanted to convey. I often brood about the past, regretting 

my missed opportunities and get anxious about my future. Never do I simply enjoy 

the present.

and technology students? annual fest, kicked off on March 15 and will continue 

till the 20th. The fest, presented in association with The Telegraph, features 

the usual plethora of competitions on and off-stage, as well as guest performances 

by bands like Insomnia and Lakkhichhara. Join in, as participant or audience.

Fair amp; strong

The fairer sex is also referred to as the weaker sex. 

Women have fought against all odds and have scaled Olympian heights in every field. 

As we recently celebrated International Women?s Day, I would like to share something 

that touched my heart. My civics teacher Mrs S. Raha has brought to my notice 

the comparison of the status of women to that of the backward classes. Like in 

the case of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, women have been considered 

a backward class. Seats have been reserved for women in employment and in public 

transport. Today, when we stress on equality, isn?t this is an indirect insult 

to the female gender? Let us pledge to work for the development of women so that 

someday, we can proudly declare that we can do it better than men and eliminate 

the phrase ?the weaker sex?.

 Secular?

Since 1947, India has been a secular country. Different 

religious festivals are celebrated with equal fervour, temples, mosques, churches 

and gurudwaras all find place here. I believe India is the strongest and most 

powerful nation in the world, with the blessings of so many gods. But we still 

feel insecure and unsafe. If secularism binds India, then why do riots occur? 

If secularism runs in the blood of every Indian, then why did Gujarat become a 

land of fanatics? If India calls itself secular, then why did Graham Staines get 

brutally murdered in the name of religion? The Telegraph Calcutta Club 

National Debate enlightened us a little (the topic was, to be truly secular, India 

needs a uniform civil code). Narendra Modi stole the show, earning huge applause 

from the crowd. It ended with the audience vote. The speakers for the motion won 

the battle by a large margin. Modi?s smile was proof of his victory and the joy 

of winning over the hearts of the people present. But a question persists ? is 

India truly secular? Babri Masjid, several riots, Gujarat ? they all flash in 

front of my eyes.

As if

Waiting for you,

As if I have nothing else to do.

Craving for that touch,

As if you still care.

Searching for those eyes,

As if you still cry.

Desiring that anguish,

As if you still depend.

Waiting for your love,

As if you still love.

One 

more sad evening

The same memories linger, the same loneliness remains,

The light that dawn pours into my heart,

Is again mingling with shadows of twilight,

Solitary and silent, like my life.

The vermilion horizon that the sanguine sun left,

Tarnishes the stars glittering in my eyes.

And the dark night,

Collects a few tears,

In her swaying garb.

And the dreams of my eyes,

That from eternity have been waiting for you,

Are shattered,

Without coming true,

With the arrival of morning.

Like my life,

Broken into bits.

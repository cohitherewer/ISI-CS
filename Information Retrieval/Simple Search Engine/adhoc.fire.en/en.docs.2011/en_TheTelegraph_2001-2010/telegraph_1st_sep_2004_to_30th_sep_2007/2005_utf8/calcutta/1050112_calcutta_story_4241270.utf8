 Missing boy back home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ten-year-old Roshan Jha, who went missing from near his home in Howrah?s Kartick Dutta Lane on Sunday evening, returned on his own on Tuesday.

 Roshan?s father, a jute mill worker, had lodged a missing diary on Sunday night. 

 ?I was playing with friends near our house, when Sonu bhaiyya asked me to come with him for a trip by train,? Roshan told superintendent of Howrah police Mihir Bhattacharjee. Sonu is a next-door neighbour of the boy?s family.

 Roshan, however, started crying after the train left Howrah station and wanted to go back home. ?But Sonu bhaiyya offered me samosas and bought me a pair of trousers,? he told Bhattacharjee. 

 According to the boy, Sonu helped him board a train to Howrah from an undisclosed location. Roshan, after getting off at Howrah station on Tuesday morning, made his way home.

 Bhattacharjee said police will not continue with the case, as the Jha family has decided to withdraw the complaint. ?We will file a mistake-of- facts before the court,? he said.

 According to Shyam Sundar Jha, a close relative of the family, the case had turned serious after a call demanding Rs 60,000 was received. 

 ?The caller, however, promised that the boy would return within two days. He even laughed into the telephone while demanding the ransom,? he said. 

 Inquiries revealed that Roshan, a student of Class V at a school in the Ramkrishnapur area, used to leave his house frequently without informing his parents.

 ?We will send him to our house in Bihar,? Shyam Sundar Jha said on Tuesday.

 The case had alarmed police, as it was the second incident of a minor boy going missing under mysterious circumstances.

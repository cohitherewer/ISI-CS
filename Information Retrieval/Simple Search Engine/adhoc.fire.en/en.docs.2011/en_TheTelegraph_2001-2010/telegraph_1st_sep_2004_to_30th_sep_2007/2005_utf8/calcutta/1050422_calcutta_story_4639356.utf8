The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mercy plea of students granted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fifty-two students of Calcutta University?s law department were reported against (RA) last year for adopting unfair means during an examination. 

 Two of the examinees, however, proved to be luckier than the rest, as the authorities have recently withdrawn the punishment on them.

 Inspector of colleges A.M. Chandra, also secretary of the university?s board of discipline, said on Wednesday that Abdul Murshed and David Reang had pleaded for mercy with the vice-chancellor and the prayer had been granted. ?I think that is why the vice-chancellor has asked me to withdraw the punishment,? Chandra added.

 It was Chandra who had issued the first circular (BD/C12/RA/Law/2004 old/new regulations) notifying the university?s decision to punish the 52 examinees. It is learnt that some of them had copied during an examination, while the others had manhandled the invigilators who tried to resist the students? unfair practices. 

 While Murshed and Reang are now off the hook, the other 50 students are still placed under RA.

 When contacted, Murshed said: ?I have nothing to say about the withdrawal of the punishment, as the decision has been taken by the university authorities.? 

 A leader of the SFI-controlled Calcutta University Law Students? Union said both students had been victimised by a section of teachers of the law department. 

 The leader, however, failed to justify his claim when asked what had made the teachers target the duo.

 Vice-chancellor Ashis Banerjee refused to comment . 

 The decision has created a flutter among both students and teachers. 

 ?The disciplinary committee had examined all 52 cases before deciding on the punishment. Before the disciplinary committee, the RA committee had handled the issue. The vice-chancellor, too, had given his nod to the committee?s decision after scrutinising the cases,? pointed out a senior teacher of the law department.

 ?Now, the vice-chancellor has asked Chandra to withdraw the punishment on two of the examinees. We really don?t know why such an order has been issued,? he added.

 ?Calcutta continues to be a devastating city, a fascinating city. It has given me something. And I would like to give something back to it. I shall come back.? ? G?nter Grass, before his departure the last time he was in town in 1987.

 It took him 18 years to return, but he is back to renew his special ties with Calcutta, the city which has, perhaps, had the greatest significance in his life and works after Danzig.

 In town on the invitation of the Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB), the Nobel laureate writer, artist and committed interventionist in socio-political issues of global concern, was ?relaxed and comfortable? after touchdown early on Sunday.

 ?Calcutta has left a deep impression on my life and also changed my views about my own country,? Grass told MMB director Martin W?lde over lunch on the first day of his fourth trip to the country. He said he was looking forward to ?meeting Calcuttans and moving around the city?.

 The Grass hop kicks off with an evening in the company of contemporary Bengali poets at the MMB auditorium on January 25. He will read poems in German from his book Lyrische Beute (Bounty of Lyrics, 2004), which contains a personal selection from nearly 50 years of his works. Nirendranath Chakravarti, Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Mandakranta Sen will then read from Bengali translations of Grass? poems, besides some of their own works.

 Grass, writer Amitav Ghosh, senior Pakistani scribe Najam Sethi and Delhi-based sociologist T.N. Madan will exchange views in a panel discussion on ?The Segregation of Cultures in the Contemporary World: Clash, Convergence or Co-operation?? at Kala Mandir on January 27. To be moderated by Girish Karnad, the event is jointly organised by The Telegraph and MMB.

 The only unstructured and, hence, potentially most fascinating encounter with the creator of Zunge Zeigen (Show Your Tongue) ? where the ?extreme living conditions? in Calcutta were dealt with scathingly and controversially ? awaits the city?s students. 

 The dialogue with students at Presidency College?s Derozio Hall on January 31 will have a panel of seven youngsters grilling Grass on various topics. Then, the forum will be thrown open for questions.

 ?We would love the mix on the panel to be as eclectic as possible. The interaction should encompass a plethora of contemporary ideas and issues ranging from economics to politics, arts and culture to poverty, terror to globalisation, the likes of which engage Grass these days,? said Aveek Sen, who along with Antara Dev Sen, will moderate the dialogue.

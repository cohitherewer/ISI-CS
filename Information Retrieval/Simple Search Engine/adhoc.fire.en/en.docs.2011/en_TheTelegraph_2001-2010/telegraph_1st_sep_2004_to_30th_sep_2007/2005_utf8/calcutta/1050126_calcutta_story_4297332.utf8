The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crime-free scenic crossroads

 Dream city: Breathe 

 easy, walk tall, travel fast... 

 Ranadip Ganguly, 

 Diamond Park

 I wish that the police force pulls 

 up its socks and does a better job this year. Despite improvement 

 in many areas, the crime graph in the city is soaring, mainly 

 due to corruption among the cops. A more active role by 

 the police is the only way to rein in criminals.

 Adrija Dey, 

 Address not given

 In 2005, we should ensure that 

 criminals, whether big or small, get punished. The certainty 

 that there will be punishment is more important than its 

 severity. If the criminals realise that they will eventually 

 be punished, then the crime rate will definitely go down. 

 Kalyan Kumar Ghosh,

 Nagerbazar

 I want the Metro railway timings 

 to be extended in 2005. If the trains run from 6 am to 11 

 pm every day, numerous people like me would be benefited.

 Prasit Sen,

 Hatiara

 I want the government to set up 

 ?pay and use? toilets all across the city this year. The 

 shortage of toilets is a serious problem that is being neglected 

 by the government for years. As a result, people are forced 

 to relieve themselves in public. The problem is even more 

 acute for women who have to stay outside home for a long 

 time. 

 Naren Sen, 

 Santragachhi 

 The city boasts of multiplexes, 

 flyovers and Metro railway but not adequate number of public 

 urinals and toilets. Due to this, pedestrians are forced 

 to relieve themselves in the open, which results in an obnoxious 

 stench. 

 Prantik Sanyal, 

 SP Mukherjee Road

 Good, thought-provoking as well 

 as entertaining Bengali films, which can be enjoyed by all 

 members of the family, should be made this year. And acclaimed 

 Bengali filmmakers should make films only in Bengali to 

 boost the Tollygunge industry. 

 Anuradha Raza, 

 Darga Road

 One of the greatest drawbacks 

 of the city is that political parties here still use bandhs 

 as a medium of protest. This does not happen in any other 

 part of the world. Calcutta would be a much better place 

 to live in if that is stopped. The traffic situation should 

 also be improved to make the city roads safer. Rash driving 

 by unruly drivers have claimed hundreds of lives in the 

 last few years. They should be disciplined.

 Indranil Mukherjee, 

 Kidderpore 

 Our beloved city is in a transitory 

 phase and is changing for the better. But the leaders must 

 realise that to repair the tarnished image of Calcutta among 

 businessmen, bandhs and rallies should be stopped immediately. 

 The twin phenomenon has haunted us for far too long.

 Rakhi Chakraborty, 

 Durgapur Lane 

 In 2005, I would like Calcuttans 

 to be granted some common sense. No matter what the government 

 does, problems will not cease to exist. But with more common 

 sense,, people will at least deal with them better. 

 T.R. Anand, 

 Jadavpur

 I wish for better road and rail 

 infrastructure this year. The Park Street and Taratalla 

 flyovers should be completed by the year-end. I also want 

 Circular rail to start operations from Majerhat station 

 and completion of the Metro?s extension project to Garia.

 Kanai Saha, 

 Gauri Bari Lane

 The condition of Calcutta roads 

 is most alarming. Repair work should be started on a war-footing 

 to minimise the number of accidents. Some important roads 

 should widened wherever possible. A drive should also be 

 undertaken against hawkers.

 Neha Dokania, 

 Bangur Avenue

 After multiplexes, shopping malls 

 and educational institutions, Calcutta should now be blessed 

 with clean, proper roads.

 Suvrajit Saha, 

 Suresh Sarkar Road

 Old buildings should be restored. 

 The sidewalks should be lined with trees reflecting the 

 colour of the season with beautiful blooms and spreading 

 fragrance. Green, pruned hedges should be planted along 

 the roads and in boulevards. Fountains should be installed 

 at intersections. 

 Ronita Dutta, 

 Jadavpur

 In monsoon, the low-lying areas 

 in the city become a nightmare due to water-logging. I want 

 all Calcutta roads to be usable, if not dry, in monsoon 

 2005. 

 Anil Kumar Sen, 

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane 

 The river bank should be cleared 

 to beautify the city. More parks like Millennium Park should 

 be built on the entire stretch. Cleanliness should be made 

 a part of the lives of the city residents before beautification 

 plans are implemented.

 Shyamal Hembram, 

 Bowbazar

 I want to see technologically-advanced 

 tramcars with aesthetically designed interiors running on 

 upgraded tracks. Such tramcars, besides boosting tourism 

 in the city, as well as in the state, will be something 

 to be proud of. 

 Anjan Chatterjee, 

 Tollygunge

 I would like Calcutta to have 

 a large number of hi-tech, high-speed and luxurious trams, 

 like those we see abroad. The entire tramways infrastructure, 

 including the tracks, should be revamped before such vehicles 

 are introduced. The tram coaches should be air-conditioned 

 and should have comfortable seats and piped music. Not more 

 than 10 people should be allowed to stand inside. One coach 

 should be reserved for senior citizens. 

 Ahasan Jahir Molla, 

 Mahestala

 High-speed trams, which the state 

 government wants to introduce in Calcutta, would be a wonderful 

 gift for the city in 2005. If it is introduced, Calcutta 

 would be the first city in India to have such a mode of 

 transport. Technologically enhanced trams would provide 

 a much-needed breath of life to the tram company. 

 Rimli Datta, 

 Salt Lake 

 I want Calcutta to become a pollution-free 

 city in 2005. It is unfortunate and alarming that Calcutta 

 is the worlds third-most polluted city. The media 

 have highlighted how the people, especially the children, 

 have been suffering because of the pollution. Noise pollution 

 is another aspect of pollution which is not highlighted, 

 but is just as damaging. My dream of living in a pollution-free 

 city is perhaps not a practical one, but cant we at 

 least take the initial steps towards that goal? 

 Satyen Biswas, 

 Behala 

 This year, I want to see a pollution-free 

 Calcutta. The city should also be made more clean and green. 

 Debalina Bose, 

 Konnagar 

 Traffic jams are troublesome, 

 not only for the residents of Calcutta but also for visitors. 

 If the traffic police pay more attention to the non-VIP 

 roads then we can get relief from the headache of jams.

 Haralal Chakrabarty, 

 Arabinda Nagar 

 The traffic signals should be 

 immediately synchronised to prevent vehicles from piling 

 up at crossings. Also, pedestrians should be allowed to 

 cross important road intersections only at zebra crossings.

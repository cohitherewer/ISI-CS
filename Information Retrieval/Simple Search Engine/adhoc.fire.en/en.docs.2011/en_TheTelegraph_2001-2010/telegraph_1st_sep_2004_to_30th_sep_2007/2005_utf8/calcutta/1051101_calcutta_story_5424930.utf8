 Pep talk: Host Aman Verma with some of the Calcutta contestants

 Impi has been awake all night just to sing a couple of lines to the Indian Idol judges. What?s more, she has made sure that she is the first to arrive at the auditions and repeat the luck that Amit Sana rode in the first season of Sony?s hit reality talent hunt. 

 Swapan Paul is a pujari at a temple in Asansol. Staying up all night has meant a sore throat for the music lover on D-day. Yet he throws caution to the winds and sings the haunting Criminal number Tu mile dil khile...

 But all Impi and Swapan got for their efforts was a series of insults from one of the judges, Anu Malik. ?Go back to your temple and sing bhajans... you don?t stand a chance here,? the music director asked Swapan. For another contestant who?s left her job at a bank to take up singing and take a shot at the Indian Idol crown, the judges had an even meaner response. ?You made a big mistake by giving up your job,? remarked Farah Khan, with tongue firmly in cheek. Third judge Sonu Nigam?s kind disposition couldn?t stop the tears from rolling down the girl?s cheeks.

 But then, that?s the show insist the three wise judges who checked out the 120 Calcutta Indian Idol aspirants at Lakeland Country Club on Monday. ?Thoda luck and thoda talent? can be the mantra for the hopefuls but if you fall short then get ready to be blasted off by the judges. 

 ?There?s so much at stake here,? insists Anu. ?From unknown faces they will be stars overnight and winning crores of rupees and cars and what not. An Indian Idol should be someone whom we can admire without being apologetic to the world. You can?t just come and sing anything.?

And even if you can sing, it might not be good enough. ?There are many boring singers whom we can?t take because they would not make the show lively even if they are surila,? explains Farah.

 So what about an interesting back-story like Ravinder Ravi?s which could help both TRPs and SMS votes soar? ?We don?t even know their stories beforehand,? says Anu. ?And even when we hear those fascinating tales from them, we don?t sway to that. Come on, you have to sing well first and then we can hear your story. We have had people bringing mithai for us and people coming to beat us up but we can?t change because of that.? 

 Surprisingly, the Bollywood trio does find Calcutta more surila in this second season. ?It has been very good this time,? says Farah. ?We were thinking how come we are liking everyone and picking so many of them, one after the other. We selected seven of the first 20 we auditioned and that?s a big ratio.?

 So has Calcutta certainly discovered its musical roots? ?No, not really,? says Sonu. ?This time all the cities ? Mumbai, Delhi, Lucknow ? have performed better. I think that?s because they have now seen what the Abhijeet Sawants and Amit Sanas have done and the popularity they have received in the first season. So everyone?s now coming prepared.?

 But will the second season of Indian Idol be more popular than Season One as has been the case with other international versions of the show? ?I definitely feel that the TRPs this time will be greater than the first one and it will go bigger with every season,? feels Anu.

 And does a Calcuttan have it in him or her to better Aditi Paul and win the title? ?Yes, why not, but we will only know that once we have all the participants together for the subsequent rounds in Mumbai,? is how the judges decide to sign off.

 Iron cure bags patent

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Thalassaemia patients can take heart, as a city-based homoeopath has come up with a formulation ? and has obtained a patent for it ? which claims to reduce iron content in the body and fix other blood disorders.

 Homoeopath Amit Roy Chowdhury had announced the utilities of his formulation earlier this year, before he had applied to the patenting authorities. 

 Assistant patent controller N.R. Seth said: ?The matter was notified to us in February. As there was no objection to the claim, we awarded him the patent.?

 Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), the apex body in homoeopathy research, is keen to prepare a drug based on Roy Chowdhury?s formulation.

 ?One positive aspect of the formulation is that it is non-invasive. Patients can take it in the form of pills or potions. All other medicines for reducing iron content, save a few tonics that do not work, have to be injected. Besides, my drug will be much cheaper than the rest,? the doctor said. 

 He expressed confidence that apart from thalassaemia, any other disorder, including gynaecological ones, resulting from excess deposition of iron, can be cured by his drug.

 The formulation, he added, prevents ?iron bond formation? and helps release the element through urine or faeces. 

 ?Iron, at times, does not get reduced because of failure of some organs. In such a situation, the element, constantly deposited in the body through food and drinks, can even kill the patient. My formulation helps clear of the deposited iron.? 

 Roy Chowdhury alleged that lack of response from the state health department had prompted him to contact the Union health ministry. The state department cannot be contacted for comment.

 E. Dass, deputy adviser to the Union ministry, said from Delhi: ?The doctor has contacted us and I have gone through the reports. The formulation seems to have some potential and we are interested in testing its viability. We have asked the doctor to submit a project report.?

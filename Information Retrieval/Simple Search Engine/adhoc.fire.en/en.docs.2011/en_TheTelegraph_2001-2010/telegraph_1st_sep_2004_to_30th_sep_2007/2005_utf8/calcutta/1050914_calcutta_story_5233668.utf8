 Remix rage, Kajra craze

 Remixes are infectious. One old song does well in its new avatar and a whole range of remixes hit the market ? and the dance floor. 

 First, it was the ageless rhythm of RD Burman and Kishore Kumar that gave everybody enough reason to take the remix route.

 Then it was the disco beat of Bappi Lahiri that became the beloved at the bashes. 

 But now, the remixes have hit the track, releasing even before a movie hits the halls.

 Kajra re ? of Ash jhatka and Bachchan bonding fame ? is the current craze amongst revellers. 

 To cash in on the popularity of this item number from Bunty Aur Bubli, Tantra hosted a Kajra Re night on Saturday.

 The night is a tribute to the remix rage. When most of the newer songs do not have any recall value, some of these songs ride high on the charts, announced a spokesperson for the popular night club at The Park. 

 To add glamour to the gala, Tantra brought in Shivya from Mumbai, a night club regular.

 I have performed at various night clubs in many cities. Bollywood is the universal favourite everywhere. And remixes rule the charts, said Shivya, dressed in ghagra-choli ? not half as hot as the Rai rage ? and ready to groove to remixes new and old.

 The dance numbers for the Mumbai maiden ranged from Choli ke peechhe to Saat samundar, Dus bahane to Kajra re, of course.

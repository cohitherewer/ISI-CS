 Blood a pointer to botch-up: witness

 OUR BUREAU

 ?I don?t have any knowledge of medicine, but I could sense that something had gone very wrong with Rajnis?s treatment when, even after 20-25 days and four operations, the doctors could not stop the bleeding.?

 Girish Patel, uncle of Rajnis Patel, was speaking on Thursday in the court of Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh, during the hearing of the case pertaining to his nephew?s death.

 Rajnis, 17, died at SSKM Hospital in 2003 after five surgeries failed to set right his fractured left shinbone. 

 His parents have charged five doctors with negligence.

 With the defence team questioning the validity of a non-professional opinion, Girish Patel took the stand on Thursday as the prosecution?s fourth witness and gave an eyewitness account of Rajnis?s death.

 He told the court he stays in Bihar, but had come to Calcutta after his brother informed him of Rajnis?s injury. He returned after the first two operations. 

 Girish came back to Calcutta in May 2003 and was in the city when Rajnis died ?at 5 am on June 2, 2003?.

 ?I had personally asked one of the doctors, Nirmalya Basu, to explain the reasons behind Rajnis?s death, but he had provided no answers. I had asked him about the procedure for conducting a post-mortem to determine the cause of death, but he had told me to take possession of the body and go away,? he said. 

 The police first interrogated Girish on June 19, 2003. 

 ?The very next day, they seized 10 X-ray films, two steel plates and 15 screws from Rajnis?s father Manoj, in my presence,? he recollected. ?I had myself signed on the films, the envelope containing the plates and screws, and on the seizure list.?

 During cross-examination, the defence team questioned Girish on how brother Manoj had managed to obtain the X-ray plates.

 The hearing will continue on Friday.

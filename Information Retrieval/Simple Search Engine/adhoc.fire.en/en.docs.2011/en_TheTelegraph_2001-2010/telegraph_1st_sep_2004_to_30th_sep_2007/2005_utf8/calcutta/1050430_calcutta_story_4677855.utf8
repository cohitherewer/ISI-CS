 Dramatic designs on daily-use spaces

 A jungle bar, the reception area of a designer?s office, a den inside the house and a boutique window ? 250 students from the final semester of the interior designing department of National Institute of Fashion Design (NiFD), Lindsay Street, put together these sets as part of their graduating project.

 A three-day exhibition inaugurated by June and Piu at the institute on Friday morning marked the end of one chapter and the beginning of another ? from students to professionals.

 ?The students were divided into groups and asked to work on a concept each,? said Susan Mantosh, director of the institute.

 While the concepts of the four set-ups were quite different from one another, the basic similarity lay in the use of modern design techniques and a young look. 

 Besides being artistically intriguing in terms of decor, the set-ups were also utility-driven.

 Researching the look that each of the groups wanted to create, and collecting accessories to support the look, the NiFD students went hunting from furnishing shops in malls to rural fairs on the outskirts.

 The hard work was evident from the meticulous choice of fabric, colours and add-ons used. The jungle bar, for instance, had glasses with leopard-spotted bands as the theme and ashtrays that looked like crocodiles.

 The window display for a boutique selling Rajasthani clothes was colourfully done up with bandhni dupattas, lehngas and jewellery with accessories like swords and desert cacti, to ring in a real feel of the region.

 The office space and the lively den fitted snugly into a corner of the large room that held all the four set-ups, were both as contemporary they come. 

 While the den had an interesting blast effect on the roof to allow a mouthful of sky into the room, the walls made of glass cried out for a lie-down on a low bed with a zebra-stripped spread, and a stare at the stars.

 The office was stark, though innovative. ?The students are actually free to bring in their original concepts; what one sees here is their thoughts about designing,? explained director Mantosh.

 Though the institute seems to abound in talent, the one problem that students face is the lack of proper assignments in town. 

 ?Calcutta is just opening up as a potential job market for a large number of interior designers but the scope is much larger in Mumbai or Delhi,? feels Mantosh.

Life

 The hottest of em all

 In town for the NiFD graduating show, model-turned-choreographer 

 Marc Robinson picks his favourites on the ramp

 (From top) Deepika Padukone, Upen Patel, Jesse Randhawa and John Abraham

 Femme fatale: Deepika Padukone. The daughter of former badminton champion Prakash, is an exotic package with a good height, big mysterious eyes and impressive looks. A word of caution: Deepika must keep a check on her weight and be more focussed on modelling than films.

 Hot bod: Jesse Randhawa. Followed by Tapur Chatterjee, Carol Gracious and Diandra Soares. The Indian woman is synonymous with curves and these women suit the bill perfectly. They have long and slim legs, narrow waists, are voluptuous at the right places and have great international height.

 Pretty woman: Waluscha. Waluscha (his wife) has a great combination of complexion, hair and a good smile that is enhanced by the proper setting of teeth. She stands out because there is something in her face that brings in a breath of freshness and vibrancy.

 Watch out for: Diana Penti. A great combination of height, figure and the right attitude. Its only a matter of time before she becomes a name to reckon with.

 Man to Man: There are many wannabe male models but no stars in the real sense. All of them have great bodies, but lack the attitude. Upen Patel is impressive. He has a great body, carries himself with style and is a confident young man. But he lacks the height to make it to the international league.

 Model actor: John Abraham. He is doing well for himself. He is convincing as an actor, has fitted the role of being a Hindi film hero well, and is getting better and better.

 Model actress: Aishwarya Rai. She is getting good roles, doing films nationally as well as internationally, is the brand ambassador of many international labels? What more can you ask for?

 Wrong number (f): Yana Gupta. With her kind of looks and confidence, she should have stuck to modelling. She moved into films, only to do item numbers!

 Wrong number (M): Milind Soman and Arjun Rampal. Bollywood was not the right choice for them. It is always better to be a large fish in the pond, rather than a small fish in the sea. They would have been better off in the English film industry, if there was one here that is.

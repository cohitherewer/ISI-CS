 Books too are a kind of property. A person who steals books today will steal food, clothes or money tomorrow. If theft of books is allowed how can we authors survive? While I do not want to see them being handed over to the police, they should not be given some extra-constitutional punishment devised by individuals either. Making them do sit-ups or hurling some such public insults on them that are being suggested by some as alternative measures sound straight from the Middle Ages. Or from a village pathshala. Book thieves should be deterred from stealing books. The Book Fair should have its own security force.

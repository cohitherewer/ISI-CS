 All but one of the 141 newly-elected councillors took the oath on Monday at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Outgoing mayor Subrata Mukherjee was conspicuous by his absence.

 The swearing-in ceremony was conducted by municipal affairs secretary Dipankar Mukhopadhyay.

 The 140 councillors will take part in the process of electing Calcutta?s new mayor and the chairman of the civic body on Tuesday. Mukherjee, though elected, will not be regarded as a councillor until he takes the oath. 

 Veteran CPM councillor and former mayoral council member Samar Roychowdhury will act as the presiding officer at Tuesday?s function.

 The CMC offices will remain closed on Wednesday as a mark of celebration of the formation of the new board.

 On Monday, two nominations each were filed with municipal secretary Sajal Bhowmik for the post of mayor and chairman of CMC. 

 While Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and Javed Ahmed Khan filed nominations to contest the post of mayor, Nirmal Mukherjee and Sukla Bhor filed nominations for chairmanship.

 The result of the contest is anticipated to go in favour of the Front leaders by 75:65. Congress leader Iqbal Ahmed said: ?We will support the Trinamul Congress on orders from our top leadership.?

 However, soon after filing of the nominations, Ajit Panja, Javed Ahmed Khan and Anup Chatterjee demanded scrutiny of the nomination papers. When municipal secretary Bhowmik said there was no such provision in the CMC Act of 1980, Panja countered that as the Act was silent on the issue of scrutiny, the general rule of the land should be followed. Bhowmik finally allowed them to scrutinise the nomination papers.

 ?We wanted to verify whether Bikash Bhattacharya had given the undertaking or declaration that he will not hold any office, claim profit or be associated with any business or profession during his tenure as mayor,? said Panja.

 ?He (Bikash) cannot pursue his legal practice or give private tuitions or consultancy against fees if he becomes the mayor,? added Panja. 

 Municipal secretary Bhowmik, however, said there was no bar in carrying out consultancy service if an advocate becomes mayor.

 ?We will not allow the CPM-led Left Front board to reintroduce water tax in any form,? Panja said, after taking the oath.

 He also pointed out that as per law, hawkers and encroachers cannot be bracketed into the same category. According to a recent directive of the apex court, a hawker is free to sell his wares on city roads. But, a hawker will become an encroacher and will qualify for eviction if he becomes stationary to a particular spot on a pavement.

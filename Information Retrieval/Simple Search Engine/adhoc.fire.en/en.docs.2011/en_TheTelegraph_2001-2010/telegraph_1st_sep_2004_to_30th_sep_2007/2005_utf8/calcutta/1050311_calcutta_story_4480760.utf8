 Twin plots, twin paths

 Padatik?s two most active theatre directors at present have taken the local Hindi stage out on experimental paths with their current productions. Among those who believe in exploring alternative spaces outside the proscenium, Kunal Padhi and Vinay Sharma present their new shows in-house, literally ? the former in Padatik?s Open Theatre (lately converted from the open-air inner courtyard into a fully enclosed venue) and the latter in Padatik?s Little Theatre (the 40-seater studio theatre on the ground floor of the Padatik building). The intimacy and enforced small audiences give their work an extra edge.

 Padhi has chosen Komal Swaminathan?s classic Tannir Tannir (Water Water), which revolutionised Tamil theatre 25 years ago. Its anti-establishmentarian populism preached self-help among the rural masses, specifically to bring water to a parched village that had received no help whatsoever, only promises, from politicians. Ironically, a fugitive from justice galvanises the villagers into solving their problem, but the play ends without hope.

 Calcuttans can finally see this milestone drama, whose film version directed by K. Balachander in 1981 had added to its controversial nature. The excellent Hindi translation, by Sanchayita Bhattacharya, is in rhymed couplets whereas the original was in realistic prose. This gives it a parable-like quality. 

 Amid uniformly good performances, Padhi?s commanding height and strong voice at close quarters make him stand out in the lead role of a down-and-out vagabond given refuge by the villagers and then leading them in their own cause. His set design utilises thick ropes to express their entrapment, while Mayookh Bhaumik?s music provides an emotionally uplifting undercurrent. 

 The spotlight falls on Vinay Sharma?s original playwriting in Ho Sakta Hai Do Admi Do Kursiyan, comprising 14 short and apparently unconnected scenes, all of them eventually woven by the theme of human relationships. With only two men in identical plain clothes and two light chairs as props, the effect is simultaneously abstract yet intense. 

 The inscapes, or interior landscapes, swing from mostly grim or sorrowful situations to unexpected and welcome slices of humour. They range from mob violence to tension in the workplace to love growing sour.

 Idle Idols is a neat parody in which two deities, unable to see each other because their eyes are fixed on their devotees in front, converse on doubts about their own existence. Even the gods suffer from existentialism! Sharma and Shakeel Khan complement each other, one more brooding, the other more dispassionate. 

 Intriguingly, for both projects the directors have floated new banners under which they aim to do all subsequent work: Padhi?s Brainchild Theatre and Sharma?s Rikh respectively receive co-billing alongside Padatik.

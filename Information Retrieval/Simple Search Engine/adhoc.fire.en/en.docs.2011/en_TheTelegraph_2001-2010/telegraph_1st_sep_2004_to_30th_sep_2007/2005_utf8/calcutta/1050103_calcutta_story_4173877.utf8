Lzone: Patchi

IPSITA DEB

The love affair with chocolate is taking on new and 

tempting forms across the city. The latest place to entice with its sinful sweets 

is Patchi, specialising in exquisite chocolates and wedding souvenirs. The chain 

opened its first store in 1974 in Beirut. Thirty years later, on December 11, 

it did the same at Forum on Elgin Road. Patchi is now busy spreading its chocolate 

cheer in 29 countries, through 109 branches.

HAND HELP

 For over 25 years, Patchi has been amongst the finest chocolate makers. What differentiates it from players is the range of handcrafted chocolate and personalised perfection.

 ?For each piece of chocolate, we have conceived various styles of wrapping and decoration, which transforms them into enchanting handcrafted items,? says Patchi president Pulak Chamaria.

 While most companies mass produce chocolate, Patchi believes in handmade quality.

PACKAGING

 The classy decor is sure to lure in unsuspecting shoppers with its dashes of red, gold and green. Everything in this boutique looks perfect, most of all its well-lit shelves of delicately wrapped delectable morsels.

 The packaging makes them ideal for gifts. ?The presentation of our chocolates is so careful and intricate that it can take as long as eight days to create a single package,? explains Chamaria. Also on the shelves are pre-packaged baby baskets that are sure to tug at your heartstrings with yummy presentation taking in far more than just chocolate.

VARIETY

 Patchi chocolates contain 70 per cent cocoa solids, which puts them in the premium segment. Whether you?re a lover of dark, white or milk chocolate with nuts or flavours, there is plenty to try out and take home. Fillers include almonds, roasted caramel, truffle, hazelnuts, pistachio, sweet raisins, bitter coffee beans and much, much more. Most of the chocolates are priced at Rs 1,000 per kg but variables occur depending on the quantity and variety.

GIFT ITEMS

 Patchi has a gorgeous range of gift items in porcelain, each tailored specifically for a special occasion, be it a wedding, the birth of a baby or events like Valentine?s Day. Patchi world-wide also manufactures and distributes silver art pieces and tableware and artificial flower arrangements.

 The store also plays host to international names in crystal, silver and porcelain, stocking brands such as Christian Dior, Versace, Roberto Cavalli, Iceberg, Rosenthal, Bvlgari and Haviland. All these come in the form of exquisite vases, bowls, shields, candlesticks and other decorative items.

CUSTOM-MADE

 Patchi?s most special feature could well be its customised chocolate and gift hampers, tailored to suit the occasion and personal demands.

 Apart from the baby baskets filled with chocolate goodies, Patchi has its own decoration team that will visit your house and customise the choco-decor accordingly. Personalised ideas and designs for your baby is an added bonus.

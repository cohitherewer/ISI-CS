 After nine long years of research, the first volume of an archaeological atlas of Bengal, the first of its kind in India, is ready for release.

 Three more volumes of An Annotated Archaeological Atlas of West Bengal will follow.

 The project, covering archaeological landmarks of the state from ancient times to 1858, has been undertaken by the Centre for Archaeological Studies and Training, Eastern India.

 The first volume is devoted to Prehistory and Protohistory. Archaeologists and scholars like B.D. Chattopadhyaya, Gautam Sengupta and Sambhu Chakraborty have collaborated to produce the book. Sutapa Roy and Sambit Chakraborty have executed the cartography.

 ?There has never been anything like this. True, there was A Historical Atlas of South Asia edited by Joseph E. Schwartzberg (1978) and An Atlas of the Mughal Empire by Irfan Habib (1982), but neither dealt with archaeology,? Gautam Sengupta told Metro. 

 The large book (16? x 11?) contains 50 digitised maps, pictures of archaeological finds and explanatory notes.

 ?Basing our research mostly on the work done in the past 100 years, we have been able to plot the sites and illustrate the available data and artefacts. There are no vague textual inferences like what the region looked like at the time of the Mahabharata or the Ramayana. We have based everything on known findings and data in English and vernacular publications,? stated Sengupta.

 The relics of the early hunting communities of the Stone Age who inhabited the semi-arid western uplands ? Purulia, Bankura, West Midnapore, west Burdwan, etc. ? make up the first volume.

 It also takes into account the remnants of the later farming communities, who moved into the more agriculture-friendly terrain between the rivers Ajoy and Damodar.

 The second volume, which is currently being prepared, deals with the period between 700 BC and 700 AD, when the agricultural community proliferated in the alluvial plains, craft flourished, the society became more complex and a form of polity emerged.

 ?We hope to complete work on the next volume by 2006-end. The third volume will dwell on the period that has yielded the largest number of relics: 700 to 1200,? said Sengupta.

 He added: ?The fourth and final book will encompass the developments of the entire Mughal era.?

 One of the hurdles faced by the researchers is the insufficient research conducted on life in first-millennium Bengal. ?None of the prehistoric sites have been adequately researched. Besides, accuracy is not the hallmark of most of the records,? rued Sengupta.

 According to the cartographers, despite best efforts, only 75 per cent of the data in the book can be vouched for.

 Roy, who has drawn most of the maps by hand before Chakraborty digitised them, said: ?The atlas is unique because it provides geo-morphological maps alongside the find-site maps. This gives us an idea of what the terrain was like then. But this is an area where no work has been done.

 ?Even the information provided by the National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organisation (Natmo) was useless to us because the earliest aerial photography toposheets of the area are from 1971, long after the occurrence of the most dramatic change in the region ? the submerging of the Kansai area following the building of the Kangsabati dam in 1963. The entire landscape had changed and we have no clue where the sites originally were.?

 The cartographer continued: ?Aerial photography has been in use in India since the 1960s but this area was, unfortunately, not taken into account. Meandering rivers and jhoras have repeatedly altered landforms. So, we have had to depend on early sketches by historians and reports from the field researchers.? The book traces the historical ambit of various clusters of sites ? Susunia, Bhairabbanki-Tarafeni, Dwarkeswar-Kasai, Subarnarekha and Ajoy-Kopai.

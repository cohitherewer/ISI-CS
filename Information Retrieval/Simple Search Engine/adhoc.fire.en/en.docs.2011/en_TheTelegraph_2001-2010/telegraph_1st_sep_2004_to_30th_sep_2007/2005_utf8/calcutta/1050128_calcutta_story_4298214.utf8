 A mouthful of Kashmir

ZEESHAN JAWED, IPSITA DEB

Kashmiri cuisine was introduced in India by Timur and since then the recipes have been kept a closely-guarded secret by the wazas (cooks) who have inherited them from their elders. But now, Pakwan, the multi-cuisine restaurant on 70-B Purna Das Road, is introducing Wazwaan in its regular menu.

 ?This is the first time any restaurant would be serving Wazwaan on a permanent basis. The reason is that this royal cuisine is very difficult to prepare and also involves high production cost. But Calcuttans have a taste for good food. So we are daring to introduce it in Pakwaan,? says owner Soma Sharma.

 The mouth-watering delicacies include Seekh Kebab, Khush Kukkur (dry chicken), Kukkur Shorba (chicken gravy), Mutton Roganjosh, Yakhni (large pieces of meat in yoghurt gravy), Rista (pounded mutton balls in red gravy), Dhaniwal Korma and Gushtaba (large mutton balls in white gravy).

 Contrary to the notion that Wazwaan involves only non-vegetarian food, there is a mouthful for vegetarians, too, with Chaman Ruwagan (gravy paneer) and Gadh Palak (white yoghurt gravy) leading the way. Prices range between Rs 35 and Rs 100.

 Paratha pick

 In the last few days of the chill thrill, what better than a hot paratha festival straight from the tandoor? ?That?s a great health option as well,? pipes up restaurateur Shashi Puri.

 The month-long festival at Trincas labelled Loaded Parathas and More started on Tuesday and will continue till February 20. The highlight of the food fiesta is a variety of stuffed paratha straight out of the clay oven. Spicy, tasty and low in oil content, these are a great option for weight-watchers and gourmands alike.

 Non-vegetarians can choose from an enticing variety of Mutton and Chicken Keema Parathas, Chicken Tikka Chaat Paratha and Chicken Butter Masala Paratha. The veggies have an even wider range, starting from the Aloo Achari Paratha to the Chilli Mooli Cheese Paratha and Green Peas Masala Paratha.

 For those not in conflict with their kilos, Fried Paratha with dollops of butter can be arranged as well. To top it all off, the parathas come complete with raita, achaar and kaali dal. To complement these, there are the delicious Dahi Kabab, Tandoori Gobi Kabab, Paneer Green Masala Kabab, Chicken Methi Kabab, Fish Green Masala Kabab and more.

 The Three Bean Chaat Salad, Tandoori Paneer Salad and Tandoori Chicken Salad, priced upwards of Rs 50, are both tasty and low-calorie options. Finally, to appease the sweet tooth, there is a range of mouth-watering sweets ranging from kulfi and gulab jamun to caramel custard and sizzler brownie.

 China chomp

 The popularity of Chinese cuisine has forced many non-Chinese addresses to either hold a food festival or introduce the cuisine on a permanent basis. The latest in line is the Indian speciality restaurant Manthan on 3 Waterloo Street, hosting a 20-day-long Chinese food festival ending February 10.

 ?We always get inquiries for Chinese dishes. So we decided to start off with the food festival and on the basis of the response we get we will introduce the cuisine in our menu on a permanent basis,? says Anirban Gupta, manager F amp;B.

 For now, one can savour soups like Lemon Parsley Clear Soup (vegetable or chicken), Asparagus Soup (vegetable or chicken) and Tom Yum Soup (vegetable, Chicken or mixed). The prices range between Rs 70 and Rs 100.

 The main course comprises Sichuan Potato and Broccoli Manchurian in the vegetable section and Hunan Fish, Spicy Curd Chicken and Sichuan Prawn on the non-vegetarian page. Price band: Rs 95 to Rs 160.

 The elaborate rice and noodles section consists of Hakka Noodles (vegetable, chicken or prawn), Singapore Rice Noodles, Vegetable Fried Rice, Corn Fried Rice and Pan Fried Noodles. Prices start at Rs 80. Desserts include Lychees with Ice-Cream and Fried Ice-Cream, priced at Rs 60.

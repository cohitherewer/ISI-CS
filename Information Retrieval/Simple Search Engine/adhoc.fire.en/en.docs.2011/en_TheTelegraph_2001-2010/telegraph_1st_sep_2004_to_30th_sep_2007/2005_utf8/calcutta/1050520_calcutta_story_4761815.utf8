The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Battered for sleaze cry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A young woman slipped into a coma after she was beaten up in her own neighbourhood on Tuesday by Raju Biswas, a CPM activist, and his accomplices, for reportedly protesting flesh trade in a local beauty parlour. 

 The 23-year-old lawyer, Baishali Ghosh, was assaulted by a group of residents at Nilachal Pally, near Calcutta airport. The mob, including some youths, beat her up so severely on Tuesday evening that Ghosh ? who practises in Calcutta High Court and Barasat sub-divisional judicial magistrate court ? slipped into coma. 

 Her father, Sadhan Ghosh, lodged a complaint with Airport police station on Thursday against Raju and his family. The assault occurred barely a few yards from her home, where Baishali lives with her parents. 

 ?Baishali is fighting for life. She was admitted to NRS Hospital on Tuesday after she returned home breathless and after being beaten up very seriously. She had bruises all over her body and her clothes were torn?? a sobbing Sadhan Ghosh said. 

 Baishali barely managed to walk back home, and when she finally did, she lost consciousness. She was rushed to a local nursing home, from where she was shifted to NRS Hospital.

 According to the complaint lodged by her father, between 3.30 pm and 4 pm on Tuesday, a group of local youths, led by Raju Biswas, 30, stopped her when she was returning home from court, close to her residence. 

 They told her that ?her behaviour and clothes were indecent?. Raju asked Baishali to mend her ways. They said they thought her clothes were indecent because she was not wearing either a sari or salwar-kameez, but was in western attire. 

 This led to a heated argument, and the young woman was beaten up on the road, without anybody coming to her rescue. The lawyer?s father alleged that Raju used to tease her.

 Dairy adds to rack record

 - Slew of products in pipeline to match rival in eastern blitz

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The war of words between Verghese Kurien of Amul and Amrita Patel of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) is spilling into the marketplace. 

 Intensifying competition in the milk products? market, Mother Dairy Delhi ? a subsidiary of NDDB ? announced plans to launch a slew of dairy products in the city on Thursday. 

 The move of crowding the racks with an array of items over the next few months is part of the company?s strategy of becoming one of the leading players in the segment. 

 ?East is a very important market for any dairy products company. Given the growth potential here, we are targeting 15 per cent of the market by the end of 2005,? said Paul Thachil, chief executive officer, Mother Dairy Delhi, while explaining the reason behind expanding the market beyond Delhi. 

 According to plans, Mother Dairy Delhi will roll out the products in a phased manner by utilising local manufacturing facilities. 

 From the Mother Dairy stable, ultra-heat treated milk and ghee will be among the first to hit the market this April, to be followed by dairy whitener and butter in May, ice cream in June and dahi and paneer by the third quarter of 2005. 

 In the past one-and-a-half years ? when the tussle between Kurien and Patel became public ? Mother Dairy has added five new products to its basket. This range would now compete against the products from Kurien?s Amul for market share. 

 ?We did not think of taking any particular brand head-on while launching the products, but we do have ambitious growth plans,? said Thachil, refusing to link the tussle between Kurien and Patel with the company?s marketing plans. 

 Though Mother Dairy Delhi is setting high growth targets for the milk products in this part of the country, the company does not have any plans to enter the liquid milk market in the state. 

 Recently, competition in the city market has intensified, with Amul entering the liquid milk market by offering a host of discounts to the consumers and distributors.

 ?We have an arrangement with the West Bengal Milk Federation, which uses the Mother Dairy brand and sells liquid milk here. But if the government wants marketing support from us through the NDDB, we will surely look into it,? said Thachil.

 Natural twist to tress tale

 Put away your flat irons. Girly soft curls or natural, wind-tousled tresses are the way to make an effortless (or seemingly so) effect with your crowning glory.

 Or if you prefer, ruffles, frills, flowers can complement the flowing, ladylike look.

 After several seasons of poker straight, hyper-styled hair, chemical treatments are out. Whatever ones natural hair texture ? be it straight, wavy, or super curly ? its best kept that way, says stylists.

 Its all about versatility, being experimental based on your mood, and working with your hair and its texture for maximum results with minimal effort, stresses a leading stylist at Juice, Mumbai.

 Tousle talk

 Talk about low maintenance. On the runway, the look is wild with haphazard cuts and tousled tresses. The only points to take heed of, especially in the humidity of Calcuttas monsoon, are the natural negatives of ones hair ? frizz or limpness, says stylist Raman Bhardwaj at AN John. To keep those strands under control, add a smoothening agent or a product that adds volume to wet hair and allow it to dry naturally. Then, arrange it with your fingers, add a shine-enhancing product, and you are ready to go.

 Face off

 The feminine look ? soft, pretty, with dusky eyes and light, natural lips ? has been on full display this season on the fashion runways, accentuated by hair drawn away from the face.

 It was gently, never severely, swept up and away. Then it was gathered into a loose ponytail or just pinned up in one section, leaving the rest of the hair to hang loose. However, the fringed effect, not covering the eyes but gently cascading across the face is the style mantra now, adds the Juice stylist.

 The good news is that the look is simple. Dry your hair normally and then sweep it up into the desired style with a wide-toothed comb. Secure the shorter hair sections with bobby pins, without fretting about loose strands coming in the way. 

 The finishing touch must be a loose, long ribbon to ponytails for an extra flash of feminine flair, or, soft curls loosely flowing at the back, he adds.

 Windy ways

 The unkempt look has stormed back with straggly pieces, textures and crimping lending a Bohemian look. The look is free-spirited and can work for any time of the day. Allowing hair to dry naturally and then randomly tousling certain sections with ones fingers is the key to this style, though de-frizzing the hair helps. Lots of disconnected layers, asymmetrical bangs and a cut thats short near the crown but long in length. The savage look and cute bob styles are definitely back in the fashion circle, says Sabina Yah of Sunflower.

 Cut caper

 The fringe is here to stay, at least for this season. Fringes are very much in fashion and the cut should be asymmetrical across ones face skimming over the eyes. A highly layered style with volume, texturing and movement is whats hot right now, says Raman, who feels the straight look hasnt disappeared, but the stress is on bounce and movement.

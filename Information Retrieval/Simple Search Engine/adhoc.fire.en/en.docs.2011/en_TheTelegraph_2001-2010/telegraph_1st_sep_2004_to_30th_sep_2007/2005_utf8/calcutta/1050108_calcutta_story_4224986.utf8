The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Reel role for cop amp; common man

 PRONAB MONDAL

 After football tourneys and blood donation camps, it?s now time for films.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s men in uniform have hit upon another idea to further boost the police-public relationship. The force, for the first time, will screen a documentary ? A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed ? in every corner of the city.

 ?The new project is part of community policing, the chief minister?s brainchild. It will help give a friendly touch to our relationship with the citizens,? explained Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police. ?The screenings will help bring the people and police closer.? 

 According to Basu, who is supervising the project, each screening will comprise the 25-minute documentary and a five-minute show by Nabadisha, the children?s welfare wing of the force. 

 ?We will show how police and the public depend on each other. The point being sought to be conveyed is that the force cannot be successful in its mission unless the people extend their cooperation,? he added.

 The documentary, an officer said, will depict scenes portraying the cop and the common man working together for better policing. ?All the actors and actresses are police personnel ? right from the commissioner to an inspector,? he stated.

 The neighbourhood screenings are not the only means police are considering to convey their people-friendly message to the Calcuttans. 

 ?We may telecast the film through Bengali cable channels as well. Besides, cinema-owners will be approached to screen the documentary before the start of their features,? said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Senior officers are hopeful that the new initiative will result in a positive feed back. 

 Elaborating on the need to portray a people-friendly attitude of the force, an officer of the detective department said: ?Source network is the key to the success of any investigating and law enforcement agency.

 ?Sources not only help us detect a crime, but also prevent untoward incidents by giving us information in advance. Building up a source network is an indefinite process. If the majority of the public starts sharing information with the force, 80 per cent of the crime can be prevented.? 

 As part of community policing, all police stations in the city have been asked to be accessible to the public as much as possible. 

 Child welfare officers of the police stations have been tasked with taking care of street-children. 

 ?Football matches and blood donation camps have brought people closer to us. The screenings, we hope, will take the process further,? said an officer.

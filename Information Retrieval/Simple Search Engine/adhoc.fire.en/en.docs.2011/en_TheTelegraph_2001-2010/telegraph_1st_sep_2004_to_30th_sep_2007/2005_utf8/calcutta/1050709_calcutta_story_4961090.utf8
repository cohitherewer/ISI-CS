The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Small talk

 The week that was had a few explosions too many. This weekend, whatever your party venue is, talk is likely to dwell on the strikes at home and away. 

 Claim your status as a global citizen and acquaint yourself with the facts before you hold forth on the terrible terror which abounds?

 Terror 7/7

 Is it really Laden in London? Though there seems little room for doubt that Osamas hand ? or that of an al Qaida splinter group ? is behind the bombs that rocked London, the shadowy organisation claiming responsibility for the murderous mayhem and the lack of official confirmation leave some space for speculation. 

 The rush-hour terror tactic (think 9/11), transport being the target (move on to Madrid) are both good give-aways of who is behind the heinous act that claimed at least 50 lives, caused injury to hundreds, and brought London to a halt.

 Tragic turn

 Gleneagles may be more than safe distance from London, but the Thursday morning blasts upset ? as desired, possibly ? the Scottish venue for the G8 summit. Not only did host Tony Blair have to head back to his Capital to ensure things were under control, statements on terror abounded. 

 Our man Manmohan brought attention to our own most recent brush with militants at Ayodhya. Pat him on the back for echoing post 9/11 sentiments, saying that the London attack underscores our contention that terrorism is a global scourge that needs to be tackled with concerted efforts. 

 Then heave a sigh of relief that there was no reported backlash in India. Hope the same happens in the home away from home for so many Calcuttans!

 Straight sets

 Once you are through with the blasts, turn your attention to the master blasters. Rod Laver says he could be the greatest ever Jimmy Connors says hes a level higher than the rest of the guys Boris Becker says he is so fantastic to watch at Wimbledon. 

 The first is considered the greatest tennis player ever; the second has won more singles titles than any other man; the third had once made Centre Court his lair. 

 So when all three feel a man named Roger Federer is god on the greens, it means more than you and I are gaping at this Swiss genius who combined old-age panache with new-age power to win his third Wimbledon crown. If the talk turns to tennis, just wear a Federer fan badge to avoid a foot-fault. 

 And talking of the Big W, just slip in a line about the luckiest man in the tourney ? our very own Mahesh Bhupathi, of course, less for his eighth Grand Slam trophy, more for his master catch: mixed doubles partner Mary Pierce. This surely earns him the title of Sabse Bada Khiladi!

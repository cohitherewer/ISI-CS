 - Trousseaus choose trend over tradition

 Traditional bridal jewellery has suddenly lost its excess baggage. Going, going, gone are the heavy metal days, for today?s bride would rather invest in ?wearable? jewellery.

 ?Brides aren?t interested in stashing away their sets in lockers anymore. The wedding hoopla lasts only four days but for long-term practicality, they prefer buying lighter fashionable jewellery, something that they can flaunt more often,? observes Anargha Chowdhury, director of Anjali Jewellers.

 The drop in weight is indeed phenomenal. Regular neckpieces and earrings that weighed an average of 110 g have been substituted by the 50 g to 60 g variety. ?Even the handwear that was traditionally 65 g is now 35-40 g,? says Chandrakanta Roy Choudhury of MP Jewellers. The traditional mantasha for the wrist, too, has dropped from the 80 g to the 35 g bracket.

 Not just weightwise, bridal jewellery has undergone a sea change in terms of designs and preferences too. 

 The base may still be traditional, says a spokesperson for PC Chandra, but the ?twist is surely very modern?. So, enter, funky versions of meenakari, filgiri and florals. ?Plain gold bands have also been replaced by diamond engagement rings,? he adds.

 These newer designs are cool and light to look at but quite complicated to deal with. ?Taking out designs from a larger chunk of gold is simple, but doing the same from a lesser quantity of gold is very tough ? something only the artisans from Bengal can do beautifully,? reveals Chandrakanta of MP Jewellers.

 Brides these days are busy mixing it up for colour and effect. According to Anargha of Anjali, semi-precious stones, too, have crept into the trousseau. ?Other than the usual emeralds, rubies and pearls, garnets and turquoise have found many takers.?

 Versatility is the name of the game and a single piece often has a double role to play. ?Chokers have a side lock, hence they can be worn as a bracelet and the innovative can convert it into a bajubandh,? says Varda Goenka of Diagold.

 Multipurpose is the mantra, from tops to danglers, maangtika to locket. ?For women on the move, it?s better to pick pieces that are fashionable and versatile, so that they can even be teamed with Western wear,? says entrepreneur Nandita Burman, who has just shopped for her daughter?s ?contemporary? bridal jewellery.

 More and more mothers are going the Nandita way. Handing over one heavy family set is fine, but when it comes to buying, it?s the wearability that counts.

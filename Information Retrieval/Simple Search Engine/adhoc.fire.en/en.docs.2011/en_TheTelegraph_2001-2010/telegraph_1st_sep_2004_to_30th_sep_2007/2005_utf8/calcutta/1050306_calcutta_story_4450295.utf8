The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Rapturous rhapsody rules with rural regalia

 Revelry at Saturday Club?s Village Fair 

Swaying to the hypnotic strains of the Kalbeliya snake 

dancers from Rajasthan. Shaking a leg with the Bhangra and Gidda sounds from Punjab. 

Enduring the edge-of-the-seat suspense in the spectacular Bhawai dance with the 

performer balancing several brass pots on her head.

As she pirouettes and then sways with the soles of 

her feet perched on top of a glass or on the edge of a sword, and the supporting 

artistes provide the background music and sing along, the mesmerised audience 

watches every move.

The Chaukidhani Village Fair at the Saturday Club 

was a rare feast of colour and pageantry, bringing alive the folk artistry of 

Rajasthan. The painstakingly put-together carnival paid tribute to several communities 

of artistes and performers in Rajasthan who have served both in the royal court 

and common courtyards, travelling through the state, recounting tales of passion, 

valour, knightly prowess and chivalry.

The Langas of Jodhpur and Barmer districts and the 

Managaniyars of Jaisalmer have travelled the world to entertain audiences with 

their simple yet compelling repertoire. 

After they held a 2,400-strong Saturday-evening crowd, 

members and guests, at Saturday Club in thrall with their magic performance, the 

club management is planning to firm up things, long term.

The ?splendid success? of the Chaukidhani has prompted 

officials to try and convert the Village Fair into a ?signature event?. Says club 

president Vijay Burman: ?The response has been tremendous and everyone present 

that evening hailed the fair as the best till date. We will do everything in our 

capacity to sustain the tempo and maybe aim for an even greater spectacle next 

year.?

There is a possibility of the club getting in dancers 

and folk artistes from Assam, other states in the Northeast and also Uttar Pradesh. 

?We might go in for a blend of two or three different styles of folk art to add 

variety to the pageant,? Burman adds.

Vice-president Arjun De is convinced the Village Fair 

could become Saturday Club?s calling card ?like the International Evening is with 

Calcutta Club?.

De recalls how it all started back in November 1978 

when members and families used to put up the entire show, performing folk numbers 

from different states in their ethnic attire. ?For the logistics and due to the 

difficulties in co-ordination, it was decided to partly outsource the performance 

from 1988.?

President Burman is quick to point out that the cuisine 

remains in the hands of members. ?They put up food counters on the lawns, hawking 

speciality fare from various states. The enthusiasm of members is infectious as 

they start preparing for the D-Day weeks in advance, procuring the right spices 

and ingredients that would make that dish perfect,? he says.

The medley of music made by the Ravanhatha (a stringed 

instrument), the Morchang (a Jewish harp), the Bankia (trumpet), Algoza (the twin 

flutes), the duff (tambourine) and the amazingly innocuous matka (earthen pitcher), 

created a rare symphony on the club lawns. The management promises a more rapturous 

rhapsody next year.

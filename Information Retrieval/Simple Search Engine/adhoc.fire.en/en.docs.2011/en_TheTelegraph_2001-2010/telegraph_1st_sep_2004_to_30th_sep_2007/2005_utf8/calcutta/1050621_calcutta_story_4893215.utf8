The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 July date set for land levy launch

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The day after the civic polls in Calcutta and Salt Lake, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government announced the launch of land tax collection in the city and adjoining urban towns from July.

 Though the land and land reforms department had passed the Calcutta Land Revenue Bill in 2003 and framed a set of rules in 2004 on the basis of the Bill, it did not come into effect.

 As per the Act, the government will collect tax from all types of land in the city, Howrah and other urban towns within the jurisdiction of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). The rate of tax and the system of assessment and collection have been specified in the Act. 

 Residents of the city already pay property tax to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The land tax will have to be paid in addition to it. 

 Though the Salt Lake municipality falls in the CMDA area, the township has been exempted from the tax following stiff opposition from a section of CPM leaders and ministers.

 ?We were supposed to start collecting the land tax at least six months ago. But that was not possible, as we could not build up an infrastructure to calculate and collect the tax. Our team is now ready and we shall start collecting the land tax immediately after the new CMC board is formed. We plan to start from the beginning of July,?? land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said on Monday.

 The minister added that his target was to collect at least Rs 40 crore of land tax from the city and another Rs 10 crore from other towns.

 ?We will engage two persons for each of the 100 CMC wards (the added areas, wards 101 to 141, will not come under the purview of the tax) to assess and collect the tax. They will go from door to door and can accept cash up to Rs 200 and cheques for larger amounts. A special bank account would be created to deposit the cheques. The tax collectors will receive a percentage of the collection as commission,?? officials of the department said.

 For speedy collection of tax, there is a provision for self-assessment in the rules. Under the system, landowners can assess the amount of land tax themselves and pay it to the collectors.

 ?We will accept the amount without any question, but will take penal action if any landowner is found to have deposited an amount less than he should have. The self-assessment option would be available till a full-fledged assessment and collection team is in place,?? the officials added.

 According to them, the tax had not been introduced earlier since it could have affected the poll prospects of the ruling Left. Minister Mollah, however, denied that the timing of the tax introduction had anything to do with the elections.

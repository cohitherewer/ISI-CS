 Celebrating woman power

What better occasion to celebrate acts of sheer bravery, will power and determination by women than on International Womens Day? Hosted by Thoughtshop Foundation, in association with Spandan and The West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, the ninth meet of That Takes Ovaries consists of a lively, interactive session that promises to inspire and motivate one and all through touching, real-life tales narrated by women from different walks of life. As always, the open-mike story-sharing session brings to focus a number of critical women?s issues needing urgent attention. From extraordinary deeds of courage by ?ordinary? women, to awesome anecdotes of firm resolve, true grit and abiding perseverance, the stories reaffirm the storyteller?s self-confidence, faith and fearlessness, and also generate powerful vibes that impel others to spontaneously share their life-stories. Adding a touch of entertainment to the evening?s discussion, Lee Alison Sibley, Mira Kakkar and Renu Roy will read out a play celebrating the power and ultimate triumph of womanhood and all it stands for. Anchor: Mira Kakkar.

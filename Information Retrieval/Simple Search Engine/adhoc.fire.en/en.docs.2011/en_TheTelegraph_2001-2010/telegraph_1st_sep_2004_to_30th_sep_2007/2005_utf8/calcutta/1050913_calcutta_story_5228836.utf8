 A few hours after this newspapaer reaches homes across the city, Tatenda Taibu and Sourav Ganguly will go out to the middle for the toss which will kick in a two-match Test series against Zimbabwe.

 India have played four tests there and won only one, and we have lost games in which we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. 

 This time, Zimbabwe are not the side they used to be so people are expecting that the record will be set straight. 

 But then, India and Ganguly himself havent been doing that well of late. And cricket is a funny game. One look at the just-concluded Ashes series will confirm that. Aussie fast bowler Glenn McGrath had predicted a 5-0 holocaust in favour of his team.

 Back home in Calcutta, Souravs: The Food Pavilion, about eight months old, will open its doors for another days business a couple of hours before he goes out for the toss. This four-floor property at 20G, Park Street is a new-age addition to the citys culinary map. 

 Its design ? lifts that open right in the middle of where people are eating, drinking and socialising, mirrors, glass, granite and steel ? gives you a Star Trek kind of a feeling especially on the upper floors.

 Its location, its name and the high-profile attention it has received has somewhat overshadowed its main intent ? to provide an exciting, enriching and satisfying culinary experience.

 For example, where in the city would you get a two-and-a half-kg rock lobster from the Andamans served in its entirety, Oriental or Continental style? 

 In both cases, the flesh is removed from the shell and the claws carefully, cooked and then put back and served to look like the whole lobster. Diners dont have to put up with any fuss and bother; the surgical work has already been done for them.

 If you order this item in its Oriental form, the lobster flesh will have been cooked in a combination of stock, cornflower, soya sauce, chilli-garlic paste, chopped onions and bell peppers, before being returned to the shell.

 In its Continental avatar, the flesh is cooked in a white sauce with herbs, sprinkled with grated cheese and baked in a salamander-style oven. One such lobster is good enough quantity for four to five people.

 A floor by floor tour of Souravs reveals that, like a number of new places that have sprung up all over the city, it is spoiling Calcuttans for choice and is offering selections that have been put together with thought and imagination, bringing in cuisine form different parts of the world and also exploring new possibilities with the cuisine of the sub-continent.

 Souravs also reflects another aspect of the food industry boom. The general benchmark of quality in the city has gone up a few notches. Whether it is competition or whether it is because people have developed a more discerning palate, it is good for us all.

 On the first floor is the 24- hour coffee shop, One Day. It is a regular coffee shop with the usual selection of light food ? sandwiches, pizzas, salads, etc ? but again like all coffee shops, fully-fledged meal alternatives are also there in a pretty wide a-la-carte selection. Main courses are mainly Indian with a few Continental items also listed.

 Rangoon Fish Curry is an interesting item: a light, not very spicy, curry using herbs common to the cuisine of our Northeastern states, a dryish preparation. 

 The Mutton Biryani here, which is of course available on other floors as well, is very good. It is cooked by the authentic Dum Pukht method, the meat is tender, the rice is flavourful and not too moist and true to Calcuttan hearts, it comes with potatoes. It is garnished with finely sliced, crisp fried onions. 

 The amazing thing about One Day is its pricing. Pizzas, sandwiches, salads, all Indian snacks, all soups and beverages are priced between Rs 40 and Rs 100!

 The average cost of a main course item is Rs 150 (the biryani comes for that) and only two items on the menu involving prawns cross the Rs 250 mark.

 On the next floor is Over Boundary, where the menu is titled The Indian Team, is mainly North Indian fare. 

 Among the starters here, the Hussaini Kabab is recommendable ? mutton marinated in almond paste, yoghurt, sesame oil, coriander and garlic paste and cooked in the tandoor.

 Chooza Mussallam, a main course item, is delicious. A whole spring chicken, about 500 to 600 grams, is quarted and then rubbed with salt and turmeric before being cooked in a gravy of cashewnut, poppy seed paste and boiled onion paste. Turmeric, salt and sugar are used for seasoning.

 Royal Platter of The Bengal Tiger is the next section on the menu and here are items such as the classic Daab Chingri (prawns, good, fresh, medium-sized galdas complete with tasty head) cooked in coconut milk and served in the green coconut shell. It is honestly one of the best I have had outside of a Bengali home.

 They also have Papda Machher Jhal, Aar Machher Bhaja Curry and Machher Tok Jhal, all chosen and slightly unexpected items. A non-Bengali item here is Shah Rezala but it is a good choice because it has been a Calcutta favourite for decades. Asian Players and From The International Selection Committee form the Oriental and Continental/International selections on the Over Boundary menu, which makes for an extensive choice.

 Maharaj, the restaurant on the next floor, is just for two more days an exclusively vegetarian restaurant. On the 15th, it will assume a new avatar ? a place for North-West Frontier food. If you go there the day after tomorrow, look out for items like Adrak Ke Panjee, Jhing Jansheen Jalpari and Marble Kebabs. Many of the vegetarian specialities will be retained in the new menu.

 On the top floor is Prince of Calcutta, a lounge bar with a wide choice of wines and spirits and also a compact food menu with Spanish Paella Rice on it, which is not very commonly found.

 On Wednesdays they have corporate nights and experiments with the music have already seen success at Prince of Calcutta and there are more in the pipeline. 

 l the outlets at Souravs are soberly priced. It is a good place to hang out in and indulge yourself. And you do not have to take guard.

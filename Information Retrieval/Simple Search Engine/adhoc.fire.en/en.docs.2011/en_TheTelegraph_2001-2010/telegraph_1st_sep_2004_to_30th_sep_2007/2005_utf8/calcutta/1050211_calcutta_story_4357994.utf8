The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Romance rhythms 

With Valentines Day knocking on the 

door, Subhajit Banerjee lists some all-time favourite love tracks

GOLDEN VOICES: (From top) Bryan Adams, George 

Benson and Sinead ? Connor 

Love is in the air and with Valentine?s Day only a 

few days away, it?s time you started compiling an album of love songs for your 

sweetheart. Music has seen a lot of change over the decades, but love still remains 

the core competence for songwriting. Here?s tuning in to some evergreen love songs.

 Nothing?s gonna change my love for you: 

George Benson

The ?hold me now, touch me now? song, of course. 

A must on every love-song compilation and requested over a million times on radio 

(particularly Musical Band Box, All India Radio?s Sunday request show that generations 

of Calcuttans grew up on).

 Everything I do (I do it for you): 

Bryan Adams

The song that popularised the Canadian rocker across 

the earth, carrying both the movie Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves and 

Adams? So Far So Good compilation to super success. Adequate measures of 

mush, a trademark Keith Scott solo and Adam?s tearing vocals combined to create 

magic.

 Words: Bee Gees/Boyzone

The battle still rages on in dark alleyways on whether 

the brother Gibbs? original or the Keating and Co. version is better, but all 

agree that the song?s a classic. Also check out How deep is your love, 

another Bee Gee?s contribution to the cause of love that was covered by Take That 

as one of their final songs before the split.

 More than words: Extreme

The most unusual ballad from a band known for its 

heavy, grungy leanings. Gary Cherone?s faultless vocals and Nuno Bettencourt?s 

casually brilliant acoustic guitarwork fortify the song, but what it soars on 

is the divine harmony. Extreme split years ago, with Cherone trying his vocal 

chords at being a Van Halen frontman. But similar success? Not a chance!

 I just called to say I love you: Stevie 

Wonder

Another Musical Band Box regular. If a single song 

can be called most popular from Wonder?s vast catalogue spanning over four decades, 

this is it. Pure emotional stuff by the soul legend.

 Layla: Derek amp; The Dominoes

This one proves love songs don?t necessarily have 

to be mushy ballads. This Eric Clapton scorcher of a love plea was directed at 

Patty Harrison, then wife of close friend George Harrison, and who later became 

Mrs Clapton. As if any girl would refuse, wooed by a song like this! Not to forget 

the other Clapton special, Wonderful tonight.

 Can?t help falling in love: Elvis Presley/UB40

The great thing about great songs are the numerous 

covers that other artistes pay their tribute with. Okay, that?s not always a great 

thing. But this Elvis classic received a synthesised reggae revival in the hands 

of Ali Campbell and Co. and soared to the top of every chart. Take your pick from 

the two (or maybe the Richard Marx version).

Unchained melody: Righteous Brothers

Finally, a good ol? oldy. Drenched in emotion, this 

long drooling melody is a crooner?s delight and on the list of every successful 

aspiring love song compiler. Inclusion in the soundtrack of the Demi Moore starrer 

Ghost renewed interest in this 60s song.

 Annie?s Song: John Denver

Meant to bail you out when you?re direly in need of 

compliments to pay your lover, this song rivals only Country roads in popularity 

on the Denver catalogue. Small caveat though, comparing her to a walk in the rain 

may not go down that well in this part of the world!

 Nothing compares to you: Sinead ?Connor

For those who have been appalled at the horrible male 

bias on this list, here?s some redemption. Proves the immense talent Sinead was 

blessed with and which she sadly wasted over the years. By the way, the song was 

written by the artiste formerly known as ?The Artiste Formerly Known As Prince?, 

who?s now known simply as Prince. 

 It must have been love: Roxette

Vintage Roxette ballad that complemented Roy Orbison?s 

Pretty woman on the soundtrack of the Julia Roberts and Richard Gere-starrer. 

(Statutory warning: Not to be confused with the bhangra butchery on the 

Kal Ho Naa Ho soundtrack.)

There are so many more: Something by the Beatles, 

Angie by the Rolling Stones, Tangled up in blue by Bob Dylan, Hello 

by Lionel Richie? So, just do your own thing this V-Day.

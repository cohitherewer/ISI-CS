 Delay in teen murder trial

 - Kuntal Sain case deferment evokes dismay, cries of threats

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Hearing of charges in the Kuntal Sain murder case was deferred yet again to June 28 by the district and sessions judge of Howrah on Tuesday. 

 Expressing dismay at the repeated deferments of the hearing of charge in the case, public prosecutor Chinmoy Chowdhury said: ?This is ridiculous. The defence, it seems, is not eager to proceed.?

 The three accused in the teen murder case ? Arijit Pal, Jyotirmoy Mukherjee and his mother Manjusha Mukherjee ? were produced in the court of Justice Partha Sakha Dutta around noon.

 ?Arijit staged an elaborate show of sickness in the court and his lawyer filed a petition seeking his treatment at a government hospital,? alleged Chowdhury.

 The defence for Jyotirmoy Mukherjee filed another petition, seeking an order so that he can continue his studies in jail. While Arijit?s plea was rejected, Jyotirmoy was allowed to continue his education, ?as per the rules of the jail?.

 Atasi Pal, mother of Arijit, claimed that her son was very sick and the authorities had forcibly produced him in court.

 Sujit Chatterjee, representing Jyotirmoy and Manjusha, said he and Arijit?s lawyer Bidhan Chandra Roy were being threatened with dire consequences by Kuntal?s relatives. ?They are openly threatening to kill us,? he complained.

 An earlier bail petition by Jyotirmoy was rejected by the court. The defence had also moved the high court around a month ago, seeking transfer of the case to some other district. The high court rejected the plea and directed the Howrah court to proceed with the case.

 ?We tried to shift the case because of security concerns, as we are being threatened,? Chatterjee explained.

 ?The defence teams were shouting baseless allegations at me and generally making things difficult for the judge. There was such a lot of commotion that the judge was forced to leave the courtroom at one point of time,? prosecutor Chowdhury said.

 Kuntal Sain, a resident of Chowdhurypara, in Ramrajatala, under Shibpur police station, went missing on July 1, 2004. The next day, his corpse was found under Pakuria bridge, in the Domjur police station area.

 Police said the student, who had just passed the Higher Secondary examination, had been stabbed nearly 50 times with sharp weapons. His family members alleged that he had been kidnapped for ransom.

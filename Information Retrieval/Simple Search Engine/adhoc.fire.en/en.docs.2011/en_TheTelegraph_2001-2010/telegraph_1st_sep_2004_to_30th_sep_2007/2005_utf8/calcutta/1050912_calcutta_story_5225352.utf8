 - JEE MODEL QUESTION-ANSWERS BAFFLE STUDENTS, IRK TUTORS

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

* Why does a red flower look black in the evening? 

Insufficient sunlight, say scientists. The flower changes colour after sundown, 

says the joint entrance examination (JEE) board.

* What is the atomic number of aluminum? Thirteen, 

say textbooks. Eighteen, says the JEE board.

 These are two randomly chosen samples from the just-published model question-answer book based on the new JEE syllabus, which has switched from essay-type to multiple-choice questions. Students preparing for JEE 2006 will write their test in the new format.

 Months before the examination, the board?s model book is the only source of information for students on what to expect in the question papers.

 But, if anything, it is one book teachers are unanimous in advising students to avoid. From wrong answers to spelling errors, it?s replete with mistakes, leaving students baffled and teachers enraged.

 What?s more, there are several questions that are on topics not covered in the Higher Secondary (HS) syllabus.

 ?I started to make a list of the mistakes, but lost patience after the count crossed 60,? said Akhil Roy, who runs a JEE guidance centre in Alipore. ?If the JEE board, packed with academics, can commit such mistakes, I have no idea what students will do. And in any case, 90 per cent of the students have no idea about multiple-choice questions.?

 Admitting to the lapses, a JEE board spokesman said: ?We might come up with a revision, if required.?

 Around 70,000 students from Calcutta and the rest of the state sit for the JEE to gain admission to engineering, medical, dental and fishery science courses in various universities and colleges.

 To have an idea how ill-prepared the board is to conduct such a crucial test, it?s enough to know what it understands ? or, rather, does not understand ? as auto catalysis. The term, as scientists have defined it, refers to a chemical reaction catalysed by one of the products of the reaction.

 However, according to the board?s experts, the term does not seem to exist, as it refers to the reaction as homogeneous catalysis. The surname of scientist Irene Joliot Purie, in another instance of a bloomer, has been spelt ?Crrie?. 

 ?Going through the answers and questions, I initially thought what I have learnt in school was wrong,? said Sambuddha Banerjee, a JEE 2006 aspirant.

 Amiya Maiti, who runs a coaching centre in Entally, said the JEE board?s ?inability? to come to terms with the multiple-choice format was showing in the model book. If the model questions are a pointer to what candidates will face in the exam, they had better be prepared for quite a few out-of-syllabus (HS) queries. Questions on topics not covered in the syllabus, such as tadpoles and forensic science medicine, have been included in the model book. 

 ?There are some questions whose answers are not even in the prescribed books. A student has to get hold of a different (higher standard) book to know the answers,? said tutor Maiti.

 Shoulder surgery holds out hope

 - Fracture-dislocation fixed on patient with complications

 SUBHRO SAHA

 A rare shoulder-replacement surgery performed on a high-risk patient at a local trauma unit has brought him back from a ?hopeless situation?, holding out optimism for many more in a similar plight who seek treatment in other cities.

 Captain Suresh Chanda, a retired pilot and a known patient of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for the past 15 years, sustained a bad fall about four weeks ago. He was rushed to a city multiple-speciality hospital and was diagnosed with a fracture-dislocation of the left shoulder. The doctors decided to operate and fix the fracture as a treatment of choice.

 But, as Chanda was put under anaesthesia, his condition deteriorated and the surgery had to be abandoned. He regained consciousness later in the ICU and was kept on ventilator support for three days. Doctors advised the family to take him back with the fractured and dislocated shoulder and to wait for three months ?till a solution could be found?.

 The patient was in excruciating pain and developed swelling and numbness of the left hand. After three tormenting weeks at home, his daughter took him to the department of orthopaedics at the Armenian Church Trauma Center (ACTC) in Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass.

 The team of doctors from the departments of orthopaedics, anaesthesia, pulmonology and cardiology evaluated his condition and decided to perform a shoulder replacement surgery on Chanda. Vikash Kapoor, senior consultant, department of orthopaedics, ACTC, led the team of orthopaedic surgeons who performed the procedure a week ago.

 ?The fact that he had other complications and had been unconscious for three days made him a high-risk case for anaesthesia, even for a short duration, and we needed three-and-a-half hours,? said Kapoor. The case had become complicated, as the head of the humerus bone was lying dislocated and broken for almost one month after being fractured.

 ?Since the head of the bone was uniting at a wrong place, we couldn?t fix it conventionally using the plate-and-screw technique. We had to cut from much lower down, which involved cutting muscles more distally than in a routine replacement. Only after one-and-a-half hours of dissection could we start the replacement surgery to give him a prosthetic joint,? Kapoor said.

 The shoulder joint was opened from the front through the muscles and the capsule of the shoulder gently retracted to create space for delivering the fracture head out. Various sizes of reamers were put into the canals and the size, which fitted best, was taken as the size of the prosthesis.

 ?It was a major challenge for the anaesthetists as well, since Chanda was an established case of coronary artery disease, had irregular heart rhythm and hypertension and had been on ventilator for three days,? said chief of anaesthesiology Emmanuel Rupert.

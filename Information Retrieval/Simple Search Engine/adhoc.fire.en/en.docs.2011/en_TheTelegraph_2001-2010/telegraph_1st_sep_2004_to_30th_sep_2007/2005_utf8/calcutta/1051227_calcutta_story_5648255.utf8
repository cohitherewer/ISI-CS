The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bus phase-out strike off

 - Transporters soften on state assurance of breather

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Organisations representing the owners and operators of private buses and minibuses on Monday deferred the indefinite strike they had called from January 1, after receiving an assurance from the government that the phase-out of pre-1990 vehicles would not be implemented immediately. 

 The government has agreed to await the high court?s directive on the issue.

 The phase-out deadline for autorickshaws, however, remains the same.

 The deferment was announced after a meeting between representatives of the organisations and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. The state government and the lobbies will meet again on January 9 to discuss the issue.

 Chakraborty stated that the government would not implement the phase-out since Calcutta High Court had extended the last date for permit renewal by seven days. The earlier deadline was December 31. 

 ?A section of transport operators had moved court on the issue. A directive is expected on January 7. Our next course of action will depend on what the court has to say. The government will not take a hasty decision, without consulting the bus-owners,? asserted Chakraborty. 

 Representatives of the transport organisations said there was no reason to go ahead with the strike since the government was not taking any immediate step to implement the phase-out.

 ?We told the minister that phasing out is impossible, given the financial implications. He asked us to submit a comprehensive proposal on the alternatives,? stated Sadhan Das, general secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicate.

 Minister Chakraborty expressed happiness at the deferment of the strike, but made it clear that the government would not allow polluting vehicles to ply in the state. ?They will have to be replaced in a manner acceptable to all concerned, keeping in mind the ground realities,? he said.

 According to the minister, the bus-owners had complained during the meeting that their business was becoming non-viable. ?In many cases, the drivers earn more than the owners of the bus. We are keeping this in mind. But there was no proposal for a fare hike.?

 On the proposed change in the commission system for drivers and conductors of private buses in a bid to curb reckless driving, Chakraborty said: ?The commission rates might be altered following discussions.?

 He denied receiving a letter from the police commissioner regarding the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

?I didn?t even realise I was making a film?

Congratulations on winning the Oscar. What 

were your first reactions?

 It was quite shocking for both of us (Zana and Ross Kauffman). Personally, the Oscar was an incredible honour. It gave me an amazing opportunity to reach out to a lot more people, to touch a lot more souls. Now that the film has won an Oscar, a lot more people will get to know about the plight of the children. The kids are my only concern.

 When you set out to make Born Into Brothels, did you ever imagine of winning an Oscar?

 I didn?t even realise I was making a film. It all started out as a project to empower the Sonagachhi kids through the art of photography and the project has continued after the film and will continue after the Oscar.

 What impact will the Oscar have on the kids, directly or indirectly?

 As of now, they are very excited to be seen, to be recognised and to be honoured. They feel very proud. All of the kids have always been so stigmatised and marginalised with their backs to the wall. But they are so very intelligent and their photography is so gorgeous. We get so many mails about their pictures on our website. 

 The kids are all still very well grounded ? all this fame hasn?t gone to their heads. They are focussed on their education.

 But they are just nine of them. How do you plan to grow the project?

 I think we can stop the horrors of other red-light areas. Born Into Brothels will help other such areas get attention. The project should spread beyond the film and the Oscar. I am planning to build a school in Calcutta for the children. I know that too will be just a drop in the bucket. But it?s a start. Hopefully, the kids will start looking after other kids in distress. In fact, one of the kids wants to run the school when she grows up. And who better than her to understand their level of suffering? She will do a much better job than someone like me. I can only guide them.

 What plans do you have for the school? Is it open for everyone?

 No, it?s just for the kids of sex workers. They are a much under-served community than the street kids or underprivileged children who have schools to go to. For the school, I will soon come to Calcutta but I want to work without being noticed. I will be looking for land and speaking to the government officials there. I will also be bringing an architect with me. He?s an incredible guy who?s rebuilding places in Colombo after the tsunami disaster.

 A moment from Born Into Brothels

 After the Oscar, the world will be looking for more projects from Zana Briski the film-maker. What are your future plans?

 I would like to get back to photography, which I used to do before making the film. This Oscar, of course, wasn?t planned. (Laughs.) As for the next film, well, my kids will make it. For now, I will be organising a travelling exhibition of the pictures taken by the kids. We are still very busy with the commercial release of the film at the American theatres. The DVD will come out next. And then, there?s a lot of work to be done with the school.

 You had said that you are not going to screen the film in India. Will you stick to your decision even after the Oscar triumph?

 I made a promise to the women and the kids. They remain my primary concern. So the film won?t be shown on television or at the theatres ? maybe at small gatherings. I will honour my personal promise. But once the DVD comes out, I?m sure people back in India will get copies.

 You didn?t want the kids and their mothers to come out in the open, but their pictures and interviews have been splashed here...

 I wanted to protect their identities. I had even spoken to the kids not to give the interviews. But there?s only up to a certain extent I can do. I didn?t want things to fall out from all that attention. I am committed to them for life. I just hope that things go back to normal after all this hype and hoopla.

 What?s the status of the Kids With Camera project in other countries?

 In Jerusalem, we are trying to protect the Israeli and Palestinian kids from an environment of hate and violence. In Haiti, we are trying to help young girl maids lead a normal life. And in Cairo, we are trying to salvage children from garbage cans.

 The NGO Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee is supposedly writing to the Academy against your film...

 Actually they were the first NGO we approached before starting to film the kids. But they didn?t help in any way. And then they requested me many times to screen the film to them but I refused. I believe they are upset but they have always been upset. They do not own the district.

 So what?s topmost on your mind now?

 I want to see my kids.

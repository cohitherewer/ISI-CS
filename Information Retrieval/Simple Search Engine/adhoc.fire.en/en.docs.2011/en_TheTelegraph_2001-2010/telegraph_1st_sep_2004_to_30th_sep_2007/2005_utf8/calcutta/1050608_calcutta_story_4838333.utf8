 Cops get civic land free for booths 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The city?s civic and police authorities are joining hands with a private builder to offer assistance to the common people. 

 After commissioning over 110 pay-and-use toilets in different parts of the city, the civic authorities have accepted a proposal from police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to allow construction of 100 police assistance booths.

 Two such booths have already come up on DL Khan Road and Sambhunath Pandit Street.

 A tripartite agreement had been signed in this regard between police commissioner Mukherjee, municipal commissioner Debashis Som and Suman Industries.

 Sajal Bhowmik, secretary of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), said the company would construct the booths for the police, while the CMC would provide the land free.

 Each booth will be eight ft long and four ft wide. Suman Industries has been set a May 2006 deadline to complete the booths, which will come up under the build-operate- transfer scheme.

 The company will be allowed to realise the construction cost by letting out the outer walls and roofs of the booths for advertisements.

 It has been given the option to put up publicity material in any form ? vinyl, flex material, neon sign display units or liquid crystal display units. The size of the billboards will be eight ft by four ft. They will be put up at a height of seven ft.

 Bhowmik added that it has been specifically mentioned in the agreement that advertisement of tobacco products, liquor or political parties will not be permitted on the assistance booths.

 ?It is not always possible for a person in need of immediate police help to reach a police station. The assistance booths are meant for them,? said a senior police officer at Lalbazar.

 He cited the example of a girl waiting for a bus being subjected to eve-teasing. She will be able to seek help from the booths once they are set up, the officer added. Taxi refusal cases will also be entertained at the booths. 

 Opposition leaders in the CMC have protested the association of the police with the civic body.

 Nirmal Mukherjee, CPM leader of the Opposition, said: ?I am not sure what the objective is behind the assistance booths ? offering a company 100 free advertisement ramps or providing police assistance to citizens??

 The CMC realises rent for the plot, in addition to advertisement taxes, charges and other fees from outdoor advertising agencies when they put up billboards on land belonging to the civic body.

 Suman Industries, however, has been exempted from paying rent for the land for 15 years. The financial loss of 15 years of rent from 100 booths for the civic body will be to the tune of Rs 3 crore.

 Clueless in lost amp; found

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sunday night: ?You are panicking unnecessarily. Your daughter must have gone to a neighbour?s house and will return shortly. There?s nothing to be worried about,? an officer of Burtolla police station tells Tapas Chakraborty, five hours after his nine-year-old daughter Subhra went missing.

 Wednesday noon: ?We are looking into the matter seriously. A probe is on to find out how the child disappeared and the trauma she went through,? says Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (north), after the child was found, injured and semiconscious, in the garden of a neighbouring house.

 After cursory visits at the beginning of the week drew a blank, the cops came back to Umesh Dutta Lane, where the Chakrabortys live, only on Wednesday morning, following the discovery of the traumatised child in a garden nearby.

 The daughter of the jewellery shop owner had by then been taken to RG Kar Hospital by relatives and neighbours.

 A contingent of 20 cops, lead by the deputy commissioner, cordoned off the three-storeyed house on Beadon Street, where Subhra was found, and sniffed around for clues. Yet again, they found nothing. ?Had police shown the same alacrity after the child went missing, Subhra could have been rescued safely,? observed Joydeb Majumdar, a friend of the Chakrabortys.

 ?A complaint was lodged with Burtolla police station around 8 pm on Sunday. But houses in the locality and adjoining areas were not searched that night,? he added.

 On Monday, the sleuths stumbled upon the ?vital? information that a former employee of Chakraborty, whom he had sacked, had also gone missing from Sunday.

 A team was sent to the employee?s ancestral house in Bankura, but nothing was found there. Since then, the sleuths have been going round in circles.

 ?It appears the girl was kept confined somewhere in the locality. We should have remembered that the red-light area is a stone?s throw from the child?s home in Umesh Dutta Lane. Police should have searched each and every room there,? said an officer on Wednesday.

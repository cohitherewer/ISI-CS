 - UNCONVENTIONAL, BUT CHOICES APLENTY

 A CHOICE OF STUDY: In colleges, professional degrees are gaining popularity among students who prefer to stray from the trodden track. Picture by Pabitra Das

 Ankita Agarwal has dabbled in cookery, sports, psychology, economics and fashion technology. The 23-year-old is ?exploring? herself. Ankita is part of a new breed of go-getters, eager to try her hand at whatever catches her fancy. And do it with elan.

 The former Ashok Hall and Birla High School student took up home science for CBSE, and topped it with 97 per cent. In school, she received accolades for her participation in basketball, kho-kho, social work in old age homes and her special brand of cooking at canteen sales.

 In Fergusson College, Pune, Ankita took up psychology. ?The head of my department suggested I try economics, something I had no idea about. It was a challenge.? Three years later, she graduated with 75 per cent.

 Ankita is now pursuing a course in fashion technology at Wigan and Leigh College. In eight months, she has already picked up skills she didn?t know she had. ?I?ve learnt stitching, paper-cutting, dress designing, colour combination? I didn?t even know how to draw before,? she laughs. 

 Her aim is to have a boutique, stocked with her own designs and international brands. 

 Choosing the road less travelled is the norm rather than the exception. It?s almost pass? to stick to the rules. 

 For instance, Sharmila Biswas, a science fanatic who scored 87.2 per cent in ICSE for the subject, took it up in Class XI. Her parents? dream was for her to sit for JEE. 

 The first-year college student, however, lost interest and had problems coping in class. ?I needed to study something that relates to life. At that level, science becomes very detailed. I could not find any link between atoms and molecules and real life,? she says.

 She took up sociology in college, instead. ?I read about it from the books of my friends in the arts stream.?

 She loves the subject, and scored 67 per cent in the half-yearly exams. Her future plans include either a Ph.D or a degree in mass communication. 

 With old colleges and new ones flooding the classrooms with new-age courses, there are choices aplenty ? advertising, film and television, gemology and jewellery designing, personnel management and human resources, animation and graphic design, tourism and more. Even degrees like hotel management, which a few years ago was a niche segment, are now popular.

 Take Kulprit Kaur for example. The St Thomas School for Girls student had computers in Classes IX to XI. For her ISC, she took up economics. She didn?t like it at first, but emerged with 99 per cent. The natural choice was an economics honours degree. Voices intervened ? too much math, which she wasn?t very good at, an honours degree versus a professional one...

 She took the plunge for the advertising and marketing degree in Gokhale Memorial College, with a little advice from an uncle in the industry. ?I even get to do psychology. I love the fact that in this course, we build our own perspectives. It?s more practical, less theoretical.?

 But it wasn?t without a hitch. Kulprit had also signed up for a B.Com degree in another college, and attended both colleges for a week before making up her mind. ?I was in class from 5 am to 5 pm. It was very tough.? But worth it.

 Ankita?s older sister, Aditi, is a graphic designer with a flourishing career in Mumbai. Both girls have their parents? support for the unconventional choices.

 Each of these girls made their own choices. And they don?t regret the decision. They rejoice in it.

 Behind the magic wand

 Potter patter: A moment from Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire

 Goblet of Fire is the most expensive film ever made, replacing The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Titanic.

 Katie Leung beat over 3,000 girls for the role of Cho Chang (the vanquished included Filipino actress Heart Evangelista).

 The Dursleys, Mrs Weasley and Charlie Weasley, were cut out of the film due to time constraints.

 Rowan Atkinson and John Malkovich were rumoured to have been considered for the role of Lord Voldemort, but it finally went to Ralph Fiennes.

 The film was planned to be cut in half, and the second part to be released several months later, but director Mike Newell decided against it. Alfonso Cuaron, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, influenced the decision.

 Mike Newell is the first British director the series has ever had. Mike received $1 million to make the movie, while Chris Columbus had got $10 million, plus a percentage of the gross to direct the first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher?s Stone.

 A digital ?spot removing? technique (which was previously used for TV shows like Desperate Housewives) was applied to clear up some of the more severe teen skin problems, for close-up shots in particular.

 Mad-Eye Moody?s signature black coat worn in the movie was worked on by a team of people who spent a week ageing and distressing the coat to give it a lifetime?s worth of wear.

 For the 2nd Triwizard event in the film, the production team constructed one of the largest underwater filming tanks in Europe, measuring 20 ft deep by 60 ft square. Every single drop of water was filtered every one-and-a-half hours.

 Haute jewels on Hong Kong ramp 

 - Local designer?s creations to be flaunted with the best of evening gowns

 Models flaunt Cavalli gowns and Mahtani jewels in the run-up to the Hong Kong show 

 Roberto Cavalli?s gowns and Raj Mahtani?s jewels. Calcutta has seldom had a closer brush with the best in world haute couture.

 The creations of Mahtani, who retails from his studio Satramdas Dhalamal and CIMA Design in the city, will be flaunted on a Hong Kong ramp on clothes by Italian major Roberto Cavalli and Indonesian designer Biyam.

 Called Jewels of the Raj, the May 31 show will be hosted by Chinese style diva Tina Tan Leo at the Ritz Carlton. Going by the name, the jewellery will take centre stage, backed by the big draw of exquisite evening gowns from the house of Cavalli, the global fashion conglomerate with many firsts to its credit, plus last summer?s couture controversy over a line of bikinis printed with faces of Hindu gods.

 ?My designs sharing the same platform with Cavalli means a lot to me. More so because my objective is to take my jewellery to the West. Somebody watching the show would be wanting to sport the same kind of jewels the next time she wears a Cavalli,? said Mahtani, seated in the sparkling splendour of Satramdas Dhalamal?s 80-year-old Park Street address.

 The jewellery designer, who also retails in Singapore, Dubai and London, is eyeing the ?huge Chinese population? in Hong Kong. ?The show will be followed by three days of consultation with buyers. I hope to tie up with a few stores in Hong Kong. Chinese women wear more of sleek jewellery, but I specialise in big and chunky pieces and that?s what I plan to popularise there.?

 Precious stones in fresh and soft colours comprise one part of the collection, while meshed designs in matte gold combined with stones form the other part. ?I call my designs Euro Medieval Mughal, as the look combines all of these,? said Mahtani, who defines his jewellery as ?very flamboyant and avant-garde?.

 Back from Hong Kong, the designer will gear up to launch his stores in Delhi and Mumbai, in August and September. 

 The shows marking the launches will pair Mahtani?s jewellery with Indian design ace Tarun Tahiliani?s ensembles. After Delhi and Mumbai, the same show should come to Calcutta.

 The India shows and hometown retailing will keep Mahtani busy for few months, but the next big thing after Hong Kong is Harrods. This November, the designer will showcase his collection at Harrods, following which his creations might find space on the racks of the high-profile London store.

 ?I have been retailing from Antron, in London, for the past four years and now Harrods has approached me to retail my creations from there. But the November show will decide whether I will go into a permanent arrangement with the store,? said Mahtani.

 Clues few in hunt for missing girl 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Another name was added to the lengthening list of missing children in the city, with no trace of eight-year-old Subhra Chakraborty.

 Little Subhra disappeared from her Burtolla home on Sunday and there was no sign of her till Monday night, confirmed officers of Burtolla police station.

 The hunt was on for the child and for a man who would frequent the locality. An employee of Subhra?s father Tapas Chakraborty?s jewellery shop in Garanhata, had been asked to leave a few months ago.

 ?The man, whose name we do not want to disclose for the sake of investigation, has not been seen since Sunday,? said an officer of Burtolla police station.

 Subhra left her Umesh Dutta Lane residence to buy a bar of chocolate at around 4.30 pm on Sunday. She had been given Rs 10 by an aunt who was visiting them, to buy chocolates from a shop that was almost next door. Investigations revealed the girl never reached the shop.

 ?I began to panic when 10 minutes elapsed and she did not return home. When I started asking around, no one seemed to have seen her,? said Shukla, the distraught mother. Her husband, with the help of their neighbours, then carried out a thorough search. But in vain.

 During questioning, Chakraborty told police he had no enemies and had not received any ransom call.

 A team of officers has left for Bankura where the suspect?s ancestral home is located. ?We also plan to raid other places where he may have gone,? said another officer of Burtolla police station.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department, said: ?We have already circulated the photographs of the child to all police stations across the city and adjoining districts. Railway police personnel have also been asked to keep a watch on the Sealdah and Howrah platforms.?

 Plainclothes personnel are also keeping a close vigil at bus terminuses and other nodal points.

 ?We are also verifying Chakraborty?s business angle. It may be possible that he is unaware of the enemies he has made,? said an officer of the detective department.

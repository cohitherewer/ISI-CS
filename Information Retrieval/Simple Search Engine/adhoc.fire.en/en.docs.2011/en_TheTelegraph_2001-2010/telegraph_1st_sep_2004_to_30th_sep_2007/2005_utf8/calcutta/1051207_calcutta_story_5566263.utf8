 Snips amp; styles for the stars

 In town on Tuesday to launch his bilingual book Haircare for All Seasons, a complete guide to tress care round the year, ace stylist Jawed Habib talks to Anumita Ghosh about his favourite celeb hairstyles 

 and recommends cuts and colours for some youth icons

 his pick

 Karisma Kapoor

 The perfect length, waves and texture in tune with global tress trends make Karismas style a favourite with Habib. Karismas hairstyle complements her fair skin, eye colour and figure just perfectly. And she carries it off in great style, says Habib.

 He, in fact, is all praises for both the Kapoor sisters ? Karisma and Kareena. Kareenas thick bouncy hair suits her facial structure and is very international as well.

 The same goes for Malaika Arora Khan, who also has a great personal style and carries it off with much oomph, adds Habib.

 Bhaichung Bhutia

 Most sports personalities have good hairstyles and cuts, but what they lack is the right colour, says the man who boasts the record of 410 haircuts in 24 hours. Our citys star footballer Bhaichung Bhutia, however, scores high on this count.

 The right dash of colour, good styling and the trendy spikes that are very much in fashion now, make Bhaichungs style just perfect, hails Habib.

Sachin Pilot

 The young politician impresses Habib with the perfect combination of a good physique complemented with a trendy haircut. Sachin Pilots neat, short haircut with lots of texturing looks very smart, he says. Habib also points out the down-but-not-out Lalu Prasads hairstyle. Look at Lalu Prasads haircut and style. He has been sporting the spikes for the last 15 years and today they are a rage! he laughs.

 his prescription

John Abraham

 The highlight of Johns personality is his unique hairstyle, which complements his macho looks very well. But to enhance the character of his hair, he needs to add lots of colour, feels Habib.

 A dash of copper to highlight the hunks fair complexion is what the stylist orders. A warning: John should avoid a blonde hue as that would dull his looks.

 Sania Mirza

 Habib is quite impressed by the wavy texture and length of the tennis icons tresses. Sania carries the length of her hair pretty well and the styling is also nice, he says. However, to put her in the international league, Habib prescribes a dark coffee tone for the base hair, highlighted with blonde streaks.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni

 Dhoni has got dry and frizzy hair. I wouldnt like to tamper with the styling and the length because thats his trademark look, says Habib. The expert stylist, however, feels that the copper colour of the slam-bang cricketers hair doesnt suit him much and recommends a khaki gold shade, instead. Hair colour goes a long way in defining someones personality. The right colour can enhance or mar your appeal totally, he adds.

 Man dies in leap off office

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Veterinary surgeon Jagadish Debnath, 39, killed himself by jumping from the fifth floor of the New Secretariat Buildings on Monday afternoon. He did not leave any suicide note, but it appears that he was disturbed.

 ?As far as we have gathered, Debnath had divorced his wife barely three months ago. Today, he turned up at the state veterinary department on the fifth floor of the building to change the nominations in his service record. He leapt to death soon after completing that work,? said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 A resident of Sonarpur, Debnath had been posted in Jalpaiguri as veterinary surgeon for the past few months.

 On Monday, according to some office staff, he turned up around 12.30 pm carrying some papers. After waiting for a few minutes, he met the officers in the department and then went to the administrative wing to change the nominations. 

 The childless man wanted to replace his ex-wife?s name with that of his sister.

 ?He didn?t look disturbed at all. He smiled at us after his job was done,? said one staffer. 

 Witnesses said he waited on the balcony for some time. No one saw him jump.

 Around 1.45 pm, some people on the ground floor suddenly heard a thud and saw the man lying in a pool of blood. Debnath died before he could be taken to hospital.

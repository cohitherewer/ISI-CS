The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Breather for autos

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government on Thursday gave autorickshaw operators a four-month breather for the switch to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The vehicles will now have to be replaced with four-stroke LPG three-wheelers by December 31.

 Metro had reported on August 31 that such a move was afoot as the earlier deadline could not be met.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday met regional heads of auto-manufacturing firms Bajaj, Piaggio and Scooters India Limited and asked them to come up with competitive schemes for supplying three-wheelers in and around Calcutta.

 ?We want bankable schemes at the lowest MRP possible. We have also asked the manufacturers to arrange for bank loans without collateral,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Thursday. Bajaj reportedly made a quotation, but the transport department rejected the discount for the buyback scheme as ?too low?.

 ?The government is firm on its stand that autos will either have to migrate to the green fuel or new vehicles will have to be procured. In case of new autos, only four-stroke engines will be allowed,? an official said.

 Though manufacturers are willing to slash prices, they are not too happy about loans without collateral. 

 ?We have reservations about financing without collateral. None of the private financiers is willing to finance passenger vehicles because there are problems in loan repayment,? said the representative of one of the manufacturers, which is tying up with State Bank of India for the loan scheme.

 The transport department had initially set August 31 as the deadline for the autorickshaw phase-out, but had to push it back because the modalities of procurement of LPG three-wheelers were yet to be worked out.

 Officials have already made it clear that retro-fitting kits were not available for autos of pre-1991 make. Around 5,000 of the city?s 40,000-odd autorickshaws belong to this category.

 ?Once replacement starts, the manufacturers will have to scrap older vehicles in their plants so that once out of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA), they are also not used elsewhere,? added Chowdhury. The three manufacturers will report back to the government in a week.

 Minister Chakraborty will discuss the details with them on September 12.

 Making masti on the move

 Organising a bash on wheels is sure to keep the fun rolling till well past midnight. Himika Chaudhuri shows you how 

 Do 

 Choose a train or tram that has a proper aisle 

 Serve bottled drinks to avoid a spill

 Check for a music system on board

 Don?t

 Get oily food that might cause a mess 

 Make the venue a bus or car as there?s no space to move about and mingle 

 You might have partied in discos, at home, next to pools, on a beach and maybe even on an island. But have you ever partied on wheels? Being on the move even as the music blares and the liquor flows may be a great way to make a night to remember. Indeed, if a long drive on the highway in a small car with blasting music can be so much fun, think of an entire do on the highway, with the vehicle speeding in the dead of night as you rock to Teri toh, teri tah. You could well give the Venga Bus of the Vengaboys a run for its money.

 Venue

 Anything that moves will do. You could book an entire compartment of a train if you can get so many party people to join your gang. In fact, buying tickets for an overnight journey to a place like Chilka, where the party could continue over the weekend, is a great idea. 

 One can also go the complete Calcutta way by hiring a tram. In fact, the slow-moving and spacious vehicle can be the best party venue post-sundown on the Esplanade-Kidderpore route with a cut across the lovely Maidan as an added bonus. 

 If an overnight trip suits you better then your options are either a fleet of cars or a bus. Space might be a problem in both, particularly in a car where you can neither stand to your full height nor shake a leg. 

 In case of a bus, choose a vehicle that has just a pair of seats on either side so that the aisle can be used as a passage for smooth movement and also double as the dance floor.

 D?cor

 If you are partying, you ought to let the whole world know about it. So start by doing up the venue ? the train compartment or the bus ? from the exterior. 

 If there is a theme like a mask party or a fancy dress party then you could do up the exterior of the vehicle with large figures of cartoons or fictional characters made from thermocol and see heads turn as you speed down the road. 

 ?Abstract posters painted with fluorescent colours that glow in the dark gives it a freaky look, enough to get you curious glances while you move,? says event manager Ria Mitra. 

 Banners adorned with ethnic designs to fun and catchy lines will do. 

 If you have a painter in your midst, let his or her creativity flow or just scribble some interesting party bites on a banner and showcase your attitude to the world. The other option is to keep it simple and go for streamers and balloons. 

 Inside, opt for interesting see-through drapes if it?s a train that you?ve chosen. This will help add that mysterious effect while creating private spaces within the party zone where the quieter lot can sit around.

 Food facts

 Serving bottled drinks is the best option. Fixing a drink isn?t the best idea with so much movement. 

 Beer, breezers and other ready-to-drink options could be explored for the liquid diet. 

 In case of the tram or the train where there is more space, setting up a bar in one corner should be a good idea. But make sure the food is dry and easy to serve. 

 Otherwise, you?ll have to deal with the risk of dropping curry on each other while passing the plates or moving around. 

 Beat basics

 While on the road the car or bus music system should suffice, there?s hardly such an option when it comes to a tram or train. Use a portable music system in this case as it?s easy to lug about. 

 Stock up on batteries as seriously as you stack up your bottles or else the party could well be marred half way through the night. If budget permits, a great option would be to hire a live band to play on while you party hard, because nothing beats live music!

 When Destiny strikes

 Two of India rsquo;s biggest Indipop stars Hariharan and Daler Mehendi have come together for a new album, writes Pratim D. Gupta

 After Colonial Cousins, its time for Bearded Brothers. In a musical coup of sorts, a newly formed music company DNUO, helmed by Magnasound honcho Shashi Gopal, has brought together two of the biggest names in Indipop music for an album aptly titled Destiny.

 Daler Mehendi and Hariharan, each commanding a healthy fan following across the country, have joined forces to offer music lovers a fresh flavour to the sagging genre, hit by repetitive remixes and rampant piracy.

 The music for the album has been scored by Hariharans long-time collaborator Pandit Dinesh, who has also penned some of the lyrics, while the rest have been written by Nida Fazli. Richa Sharma has also sung for a couple of tracks on Destiny, set for release this month.

 Daler speak

 He may be dogged by controversy over human trafficking, but it is music which best defines Daler paaji, popularly known as Dollar Mehendi in the US. I always wanted to become a star, he says. 

 I wanted my picture in magazines, my songs to be played on radio. It was Shashi Gopal who gave me my first break in 1995 with Bolo tara ra ra. Over the next 10 years, from Tara ra ra to Shara ra ra, I have been able to realise my big dreams.

 The man who has an extensive classical background having trained under Rahet Ali Khan of the Patiala gharana attributes his success more to luck than hard work. I would say its five per cent effort and 95 per cent luck. There are so many singers all over the country who are trying to make a foray but not all are as lucky.

 Daler also believes luck has brought this opportunity to sing with Hariharan on Destiny. All credit should go to music director Dinesh Pandit who thought I was fit to be included in this important album.

 But luck has nothing to do with his loud costumes, which are completely deliberate, stresses Daler. I have always designed my own costumes and I havent really cared how I look or what people feel about my dressing. I believe costumes should be striking enough to remember as well as the songs I sing.

 Hari talk

 The man, probably best known for his collaboration with Leslie Lez Lewis on the Colonial Cousins albums, is all excited about this new musical harmony. I have always thought of doing something with Daler. Main har waqt sochta tha papaji ke saath kuch karenge. And I am so happy that Destiny has turned out so well. It was truly a great experience

 Relationships have helped keep Hariharan on track. Shashi and I have known each other for over 30 years. And more than business, it is the closeness we share that comes through in our music. Also the same with Dinesh. Woh bhi ek purana paapi hai, he laughs.

 Hariharan is pleasantly surprised by the short time in which the album has been completed. It usually takes me a year to cut an album. In fact, I have been working for two years on my own album. And Destiny happened in just 10 days flat. Two of the songs were born and developed over the telephone.

 Both the singing stars are very upbeat about the prospects of the album, the videos for which are being shot across the globe. But Destiny is just one of the projects keeping these two busy of late.

 Hariharan is also excited about the Tamil film he has starred in, which released a couple of Fridays ago. As for Daler, he is picking out some new turbans for another music tour he is planning around the world.

 School kids to a veteran parliamentarian, the new mayor to women wearing period attire? The annual Sutanuti Utsab plans to merge the modern with the traditional when it celebrates Calcutta?s birthday this year.

 ?The focus, to an extent, will be on the Banga bhanga andolon (partition of Bengal) this time, to commemorate its 100th anniversary,? says Gopinath Ghosh, joint secretary of Sutanuti Parishad, which organises the annual extravaganza. ?We will be felicitating Federation Hall Society, from which the movement started. Professor Hosinur Rahman will speak on the andolon and songs from the period, by the likes of Mukunda Das, DL Roy, Rajanikanta Sen and Rabindranath Tagore, will be performed.?

 The five-day festival at the Sovabazar Natmandir will be inaugurated by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and mayor Bikash Bhattacharya on August 24. 

 The first day?s events include Shadow of Draupadi, a performance by Odissi dancer Sanchita Bhattacharya, that takes a look at Draupadi?s life from various angles. The next day, cultural group Srijani will present a one-hour show on music and pieces from Tagore?s plays.

 On Day Three, an inter-school competition will see kids choose from activities like dance, quiz and instrumental music to win prizes and a performance from the remaining members of the V. Balsara Orchestra.

 On August 27, north Calcuttans who have excelled in various fields would be felicitated. The list includes Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, actress Madhabi Mukherjee and footballer Amal Dutta, besides The Federation Hall Society.

 Like other years, the grand finale of the Utsab will be the 19-dish bhoj on August 28. ?Traditional items and attire will make it a special occasion, as always,? feels Ghosh.

 The only sour note in the proceedings is the presence of a garage on the approach to the Natmandir. ?It is not only an eyesore but also encroachment on a heritage site. One of the reasons for inviting the minister and the mayor is to highlight the problem to them,? Ghosh says.

 The Natmandir land was sold in parts by the owners. Before Kamal Basu, then mayor, acquired the building around 1985 for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the plot on which the garage stands had already been sold. ?The state government had served an acquisition notice last year and Asok Bhattacharya had made a personal visit. But no action has been taken yet,? complains Ghosh.

 Then, there?s also the controversy over celebrating the city?s birthday on August 24. 

 ?As we?ve said earlier, we consider August 24 to be a symbolic date for the beginning of the urbanisation process of Calcutta, as we know it,? is the line the Parishad is maintaining.

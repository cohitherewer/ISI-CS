 As you get set to paint the town in myriad colours today, getting your fashion facts right can be quite an arduous task. As far as the wardrobe goes, white zooms into fashion focus during the festival of colours (check out the Bollywood babes and hunks who make quite a statement dressed in sparkling whites at the private Holi dos). So, the boring white kurta or T-shirt that you had stashed away in the cupboard can come in handy today. While that?s easily solved, what needs special care, however, are your skin and hair, especially if you have coloured or streaked tresses. While most of us like to throw all caution to the wind while splurging with colours, some very basic precautions will see you through, without marring the fun. Goodlife draws up a list of fashion do and don?t, just for Holi day.

White wows

 ?It?s the age of tie on tie, dye on dye, call it what you will. When it comes to making a style statement, what better time than at Holi. It?s all about one?s individuality, dashes of experimentation and oodles of attitude,? says designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh, for whom a white T-shirt is the best bet for Holi. ?On white tees, you can let your creativity rule, for splashes and splatters of colour will only make the garment less boring. Don?t think about discarding it, as it?s a whole new piece of art to be worn around town later. What?s more, after each wash, it?s a different story ? the post-Holi look changes each time,? she adds.

 Designer Jyoti Khaitan, however, is all for the ethnic feel. ?A traditional white kurta, like the ones seen in Silsila, is the most fashionable thing to flaunt on Holi. It should be in a light and flowy fabric so that the colours stand out strongly. Some ethnic jewellery will add to the festive feel. Those attending evening bashes, however, should opt for bright coloured embroidered saris,? she says.

Body care

 Traditionally, Holi was played with colours extracted from spring flowers or other herbs, which had therapeutic value. But with passing time, these natural ingredients gave way to synthetic dyes, that often contain mica, acids, alkalis and pieces of glass. These can cause skin disorders like abrasion, irritation and itching. The worst affected are those with skin problems and coloured hair.

 Says beautician Bridgette Jones: ?Those with streaked or globally coloured hair, particularly in light hues like blonde and copper, should try and avoid Holi colours totally. The bright greens and pinks will stick to the hair and can never be removed. The only options left will be to chop off the hair or re-colour it.? She recommends wearing a cap to protect the hair as much as possible.

 Applying liberal layers of oil on the whole body and the hair is the most common way of protecting yourself from the hard-to-rinse dyes. However, if you don?t want to step out with overtly oiled hair, blend funk with functionality by using hair gel. Conditioning the hair, without rinsing it off, is another option. You can replace the oil for the skin with vaseline, cold cream or baby oil and follow these up with a good waterproof sunscreen cream. While applying vaseline, stress more on the dry parts of the body like the soles and elbow and don?t leave out the nails. Applying a coat of nail varnish is another option.

 The harmful materials present in the dyes not only affect the skin, they can cause severe damage to the eyes if the colours seep in. Hence, covering your eyes with shades sunglasses is an absolute must, say most beauticians.

Scrub story

 Despite all precautionary measures, you are most likely to end up being all green and pink by the afternoon. While spending hours scrubbing off the Holi hues are part of the festive fun, make sure you use the right ingredients to do so. Lemon juice, for instance, is the most powerful natural whitening agent and is particularly effective for the fingers and nails. This should be applied and left for 15 to 20 minutes and washed off with warm water, and followed by a rich moisturiser.

 The hair should be washed with a mild shampoo as soon as possible and rinsed with either lemon juice or beer to bring back the shine. ?After playing Holi, it is important to remove the colour and replenish the skin with a paste of soyabean flour or besan mixed with milk. You should also use a moisturising soap while scrubbing off the colours and never rub the skin vigorously. A mixture of sea salt, glycerine and few drops of aroma oil that has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal effects can mend the harm caused by chemical colours to some extent. Liberal use of a cold cream or a moisturiser thereafter is a must. 

 In case of rashes or allergy, it is best not to take chances and to consult a doctor, advise beauty experts.

Natural hues

 For those who are not too keen on suffering the synthetic dyes, yet would not want to miss out on the fun, turning to the kitchen for some natural hues could be a good solution. The options would be limited, but you can have your share of colour shower. 

 Pure mehndi, either by itself or mixed with an equal quantity of dry flour, will give you a bright green. And so will other fine water-based pastes of leaves like spinach, mint or tomato. You can get a vibrant yellow by mixing two teaspoons of haldi with double the quantity of dry besan, or one teaspoon of haldi with two litres of water. 

 The options are a little wider in the red family. For a bright reddish-orange, mix dry sandalwood powder and a pinch of lime with two teaspoons of haldi powder and a few drops of water. Use this only after diluting with 10 litres of water. For a vibrant magenta, grate one beetroot, soak in one litre of water, boil or leave overnight.

Ale and ole punch

Plan a Party

Zeeshan Jawed lists the musts for 

a Hawaiian bash

 Do 

Recreate a beach-like ambience

Design an invitation card that will give a glimpse of the theme 

Get a bartender to whip up Hawaiian Punch for the guests

Play beach tracks and Caribbean music 

Don?t 

Flaunt cocktail suits or evening gowns 

Move over pool parties and rain dances. A Hawaiian 

bash is the ultimate in wet and wild fun with a perfect blend of sun, sands and 

spirits. But if the sea and beaches are not on your agenda for sometime now owing 

to the tsunami disaster, you can shift the fun indoors. Some attitude, right party 

gear and suitable music will go on to ensure that the party is anything but damp. 

Hot haunt

A Hawaiian party or a Luau is usually held outdoors. 

So your next escapade to Digha, Shankarpur or Chandipur could provide ideal opportunities 

for such a bash. But in case you?re not planning a trip soon, a Hawaiian theme 

party can easily be executed at home without compromising on the fun factor. Poolside, 

backyard or terrace can be the hit haunts. 

Decor drama

Recreating the island-like ambience is the best part 

about a Hawaiian party. The surroundings should have a riot of colours. If possible 

throw in a few artificial coconut trees in the corners. Make a thatched roof for 

the bar counter and hang green coconuts and tropical fruits from it. Also, place 

bowls full of tropical fruits and colourful flowers on the tables. Get the waiters 

to dress up in Hawaiian attire.

On the cards

Steer clear of boring invitation cards. Instead, give 

your guests a teaser of what they can expect at the party. Pictures of Hula girls 

dressed in skimpy tops, grass skirts and straw hats will do the trick.

Grub club

Whatever the menu, presence of the Hawaiian Punch 

(a blend of rum, lemonade and fruit squash garnished with fruit slices) is a must 

to wash it down. Get a professional bartender to whip up the cocktail for the 

guests. The non-drinkers can sip on some green coconut water. The grub can comprise 

some pork chops or lamb chops, smoked salmon and lots of seafood. Serve Pilaf, 

the traditional Hawaiian rice delicacy, for dinner. ?In a Hawaiian party one can 

also serve lots of cut fruits or fruit salads with the booze,? says barman Irrfan 

Ahmed. 

Tune talk

A good collection of beach tracks will rock your party. 

?Songs like Feeling hot hot hot and Mysterious girl by Peter Andre 

are sure to have the party mood soaring high and will keep people glued to the 

dance floor. Tracks by Bob Marley and Eddie Grant will be right for the 30-plus 

crowd,? says DJ Pre-Anjana of Prince Of Cal. Hula Girls shaking their bodies to 

Caribbean music might add oodles of oomph to your party, but arranging them in 

Calcutta might be a little too tough. 

Fashion facts

A Hawaiian party can never be a success if the guests 

turn up in cocktail suits. Colourful printed Hawaiian shirts teamed with shorts, 

accessorised with straw hats, is the ideal dress code for men. Women can flaunt 

anything from capris and ruffled minis to sarongs paired with spaghettis or short 

tops. Neckpieces, wristbands and headbands made of colourful flowers and straw 

hats will complete the look.

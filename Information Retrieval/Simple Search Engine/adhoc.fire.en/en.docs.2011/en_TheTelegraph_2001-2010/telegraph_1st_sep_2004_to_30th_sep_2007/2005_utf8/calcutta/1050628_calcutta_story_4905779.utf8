The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Redo agenda for drainage 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Barely a week after winning the majority in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Monday unveiled a Rs 2,537-crore plan to refurbish the drainage, sewerage and sanitation system in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA).

 According to officials, the government initiative to improve the sewerage and drainage system in the CMA comes after a two-decade gap.

 The plan, prepared by the CMDA, will be implemented in phases. The drainage system will be improved in the first phase, which will take at least five years and Rs 1,117 crore to complete. Thereafter, Rs 1,010 crore will be spent for developing the sewerage system and Rs 410 crore for setting up a modern sanitation system. 

 ?We have finalised the categories of work and are waiting for approval from the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee. Once we get the nod, we will float a global tender to engage a consultant and prepare detailed schemes,?? CMDA director-general Tushar Mitra said on Monday.

 He added that funds to implement the schemes would be raised from departmental allocations, Central assistance and special grants (under environment improvement programme, Ganga Action Plan and Urban Renewal Mission). Foreign funds, especially from the Asian Development Bank, and bank loans will also be sought.

 The plan includes re-excavation of 25 drainage and sewerage channels that empty into the Hooghly and Kulti Gang, improvement of 20 sewerage zones, development of a scientific sewerage network, construction of treatment plants and sewage pumping stations, laying of new sewer lines, replacement of the century-old brick sewer lines in the city and cleaning of the existing sewerage system.

 Introduction of a modern and scientific method for storing, collection, transportation and disposal of solid waste is also part of the plan.

 The sewage of towns located on the west bank of the Hooghly are now emptied into the river, while drainage and sewerage of the city and other towns on the east bank are emptied into the Kulti Gang through 20 canals.

 ?Most of the canals have become shallow and the flow of sewerage has become sluggish. As a result, waterlogging has become a problem in the city and other towns in the CMA. We will re-excavate and re-line the canals and other channels on a priority basis to increase the flow. Renovation of drainage outlets and construction of lifting and drainage pumping stations are also on the agenda,?? said a CMDA official.

 Development of a sewerage network, construction and augmentation of sewage treatment plants and sewage pumping stations are a must, he signed off.

 At 1.30 am on Sunday, he was waiting outside Shisha bar for his turn to enter. At 3 am, he was nursing his wounds in the emergency ward of SSKM Hospital. The usual night-out for Samad Farid and friends ended on a not-so-nice note, but according to the Shisha authorities, they had only themselves to blame. 

 Farid is from the Netherlands. He has been in the city for the past two months working with Praajak Development Society, an NGO in New Alipore. On Sunday morning, Farid, along with his friends (three men and five women) went to the lounge bar at 22 Camac Street. They were asked to pay a cover charge. 

 But what led to the fracas? 

 ?We were stopped at the gate and told to shell out a cover charge of Rs 500 per couple. A friend of mine, Dirk Gerritsen, who was talking to the manager of the club, tripped and tore a piece of paper on the table. Immediately, he was surrounded by three or four security guards. We were asked to pay for the coupons. We refused to pay and proceeded to leave the place. We were chased, beaten up and forced to pay,? narrated Farid, in SSKM Hospital. 

 But according to the Shisha authorities, they were just acting on the instructions issued by the police. 

 ?They came in a gang, so we could not allow them in without taking a cover charge. One of them tried to pick up the entry coupons on the sly. We spotted him and told them to pay up. They started to push and jostle. We called up Shakespeare Sarani police station. The officials instructed us to detain the trouble-makers,? says Arvind Bhatnagar, head of operations, Grain of Salt. 

 ?We were waiting for a taxi when eight or 10 bouncers rushed towards us. We ran for cover. But they got hold of me and started beating me up with batons and kicking me with their boots. They tried to drag me into the premises. One of the guards hit my nose with his walkie-talkie. I started bleeding profusely. Thankfully, the cops came to our rescue,? says Farid. 

 The policemen posted in front of the American Consulate witnessed part of the proceedings that took place on the road. ?I heard a loud cry and saw one group of people chasing another. I rushed to the spot and discovered that the guards of Shisha were dragging a person inside. Some of them were beating him up. I rescued him and his friends. Then, I got in touch with the control room,? says Sujit Ganguly, duty officer posted in front of the American Consulate.

 The police arrived on the spot and took Samad to SSKM Hospital. ?His clothes were torn and he was bleeding profusely from his nose and required immediate medical aid. His friends escaped with very minor injuries,? said K. K. Roy Chowdhury, inspector on duty. 

 He added: ?We have detained one of the security guards. We have heard both their versions and are looking into the incident. Farid and his friends have lodged a formal complaint with the police. We have instructed them not to leave the city without informing us.?

 Organise this special affair in your regular dining space, get creative 

at a more off-beat locale

Few things beat the romanticism of a cosy private 

dinner with your special someone on Valentine?s Day. While the right company will 

go a long way to ensure your evening is really special, perfect planning with 

attention to minute detail will make it an affair to remember. While roses, champagne 

and candles are the must-haves on your list when you plan such a dinner at home, 

read on for some other nitty gritties that will give it the magical touch it deserves.

Hot haunt

The most important ingredient in your romantic recipe 

is the ambience you create and a lot depends on the venue. A poolside barbecue 

might be an ideal option, but not too many of us are lucky enough to have a pool 

at home. So, shift the affair indoors (you can avoid prying eyes this way, too) 

and opt for your veranda or living room. 

D?cor drama

 The table is the most important prop for the evening so pour your heart into decorating it keeping the mushy theme in mind. Start with laying a satin or lace white table cloth over a round table and throw some red and pink ribbons and lace around. The napkins and table mats should also be in the hues of love. Crystal crockery and shining silver cutlery will lend a classy look. A bottle of champagne with two crystal wine glasses will add to the same effect. A small flower arrangement in the centre with some long-stemmed red roses and a silver candlestick with red candles will make the setting picture perfect.

?Candles, wine, flowers and soft music are essential 

to create a romantic mood. Also, it?s very important to opt for a haunt other 

than your regular dining space. Shifting to the veranda, patio, garden or terrace 

will make the affair special,? says interior designer Anita Mansatta. 

Mood music

Nothing will set the mood better than the music. Soft 

romantic love tracks are a must for the mushy affair. ?During a Valentine?s Day 

dinner for two, you should play anything that reaches out and touches your heart 

? from classic love songs to soft rock. Tracks like Lady in red and Every 

breath you take are just perfect,? says DJ Vishal at The Park. For those who 

prefer to voice their own sweet nothings, some soulful tunes, harp and piano concertos 

make for good mood music.

Love bites

 While the ambience and d?cor will set the tone, the menu will be the real clincher. Since you?re planning a formal dinner, go for a four-course meal ? soups, starters, main course and desserts. Surinder Singh, executive chef, Taj Bengal, recommends an Italian dinner this Valentine?s Day.

 You can start off with a Capuccino Soup served in a coffee cup, Beef Tomatoes (it?s vegetarian!) with basil and extra virgin oil or a Buffalo Mozzarella Salad laced with extra-virgin oil. For the main course, Singh suggests some fresh Norwegian Salmon with Lemon Butter or Roast Duck with Cranberry Sauce. Vegetarians can opt for American Corn Crepes with a Cheese Fondue. A sweet ending to this love tale is some fresh strawberries in fresh cream. Alternatively, you can opt for a chocolate dip with the strawberries. And if you are reluctant to end your meal without some dollops of ice-cream, make some strawberry ice-cream at home. ?One aphrodisiac in the meal is absolutely essential and nothing can be better than strawberries here,? says Singh.

If these Italian dishes seem too exotic for your reach, 

get hold of a good recipe book and take this opportunity to make a debut in the 

kitchen.

Tipple tale

Raising a toast to romance can never be complete without 

chocolate and strawberries. So, stash away those beer cans and whisky bottles. 

?Chocolate and strawberries are loved by most people and Valentine?s Day presents 

an opportunity to indulge in your favourite sins? in excess,? says Anirban Simlai, 

F amp;B director, The Park. Simlai has a list of Valentine?s Day special cocktails 

up his sleeve that are innovative yet quite simple to whip up. The Pink Palette 

looks quite exotic but is achieved quite simply by dipping strawberries in a glass 

of white wine. The Choco Colada is a heady concoction of dark rum, white rum, 

Tia Maria, chocolate syrup and coconut cream. For those who want to combine strawberries 

and chocolate, the Chocolate and Raspberry Martini, a mixture of raspberry vodka, 

raspberry liqueur and Creme de Cacao is perfect. ?A tad different from the rest 

is the Blueberry and Chocolate Mojito, a mixture of rum, crushed blueberries and 

chocolate syrup. To add a touch of class, women can opt for heart-stopping red 

wines like the Chianti Classico, Oxford Landing Merlot (Australian red wine) or 

forever pure Oxford Landing Chardonnay (Australian white wine),? adds Simlai.

Dress code

 Once the d?cor, drinks and detailing fall in place, it?s time to pay some attention to your look. Accepted V-Day norms dictate that a touch of red or pink is essential. A red or pink cocktail dress is a great option. But if you don?t happen to possess one and don?t have much time to go on a shopping spree, a flowing feminine skirt paired with a halter-neck or an off-shoulder top is bound to make a desirable impact. Invest in a scarf, sash or any other accessory to add a dash of the V-day colours. 

 And don?t forget some ultra-sexy sandals or stringy tie-ups. Suits and blazers might be the traditional choices for a formal dinner for two, but this Valentine?s Day, that might be a little too hot to handle. Go for a red silk shirt instead and you are sure to conform to the Valentine dress code.

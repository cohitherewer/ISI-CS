 Prescription for fun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 An early and light dinner, followed by a midnight snack. A few pegs of your poison and an ice cream or two ? even if you are diabetic? are just a few indulgences you can allow yourself this Puja. But in between, do get some sleep to keep yourself fit enough for more fun.

 With the Durga Puja celebrations cut down to just two days this year, the revelry peaked from Panchami itself. Calcuttans hit the road both by day and night, and many fell ill after getting drenched on Sashthi and scorched on sunny Saptami. So, doctors have warned that enjoying the Pujas is fine, but getting some sleep and eating the right food are very essential.

 ?We received quite a few patients today whose blood pressure levels have shot up, because they have not been sleeping at all. Apart from forgetting to take the prescribed medicines, most people seem to be making the mistake of having a heavy dinner and then setting out to visit pandals. Now, that is not on at all,? warned cardiologist Tarun Praharaj of the BM Birla Heart Research Centre.

 Doctors are advising people to have an early dinner and keep a significant gap before they have a midnight snack. 

 ?With adequate rest, the midnight snack should not be any problem to digest, but one should always have freshly-cooked food. There were three patients who had not slept today and had fallen sick,? added Praharaj.

 With most stall-owners serving up stale food, doctors advise that chaats and phuchkas should be avoided after midnight. 

 ?Elderly people, particularly those who are diabetic, should avoid long walks and travel in vehicles. If someone is on insulin, carrying a small packet of glucose powder is just the thing to do. If one starts perspiring, it is high time one had a small sip of glucose to keep the sugar level balanced,? said physician Anup Maiti. 

 ?An odd ice cream or even a chocolate can work wonders in a crisis,? he added.

 With pollution increasing by the day, those allergic to dust and asthmatics can keep an inhaler handy, just in case the dust starts to choke the lungs, advised Susovan Haldar, a respiratory disease expert. 

 A few pegs of one?s favourite tipple are fine during the festival, but doctors stipulate that one has to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.

 ?After walking in the hot sun for hours, don?t touch a cold drink immediately afterwards,? Haldar stressed.

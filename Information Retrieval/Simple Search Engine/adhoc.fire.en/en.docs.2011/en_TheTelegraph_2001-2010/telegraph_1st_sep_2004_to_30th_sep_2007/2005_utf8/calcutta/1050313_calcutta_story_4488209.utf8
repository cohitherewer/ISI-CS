 City Lights

 Dreams and dislocation

Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni has kept a low profile 

so far in this part of the world. This is strange, given how quick Calcutta usually 

is to claim ownership of anyone who has even a remote connection with the city. 

Here is a Bengali woman writing best-selling novels in the US, and somehow, she 

has managed to sidestep the limelight.

 But that is likely to change very soon. With Chitra?s first novel The Mistress of Spices being made into a film starring Aishwarya Rai, produced by Gurinder Chadha and directed by husband Paul Mayeda Berges, we will be seeing much more of the writer who grew up in New Alipore.

 For now, Queen of Dreams, her latest novel, was launched in the city on Saturday. Set in the Bay area of California, the story, like Chitra?s earlier works, explores the immigrant experience in the US. She strikes a rare balance between eastern mysticism and contemporary American culture.

 ?Not a lot has been written on immigrant life till recently. It is interesting to see how people lose touch or continue to keep in touch with their own cultures,? explains Chitra. For the student of Loreto House and Presidency College who shifted base to Ohio at the age of 20, this was both familiar and relevant ground.

 The film ? currently being shot in California ? on the other hand, is uncharted territory. ?Gurinder got hold of the book and wrote to me some years ago,? she recalls. 

 Though the Bend It Like Beckham and Bride amp; Prejudice director didn?t have enough money at the time, she really wanted to make the film. After the runaway success of her other projects, finances were no longer an obstacle.

 Chitra, for her part, was more than happy giving Gurinder the rights to her book (?I like her work, and she is interested in similar themes?). Immigrant communities and women?s identities within them are recurring ideas explored by both.

 The author was not interested in influencing the film-maker?s creative process, which deserves, she feels, its independence. Aishwarya?s character, for instance, is supposed to be an old woman, which is crucial to the text. 

 ?I am not sure how old she will be in the film, but Gurinder was planning white hair and coloured contacts!? she smiles.

 The mother of two was disappointed, however, that she couldn?t be on the sets as this two-week India trip had been planned well in advance and coincides with the US schedule. However, her own schedule permits no liberties with time.

 Chitra also teaches creative writing at the Ph.D. programme at the University of Houston, one of the best in the country.

 She co-founded Maitri, an organisation that works with immigrant women victims of domestic abuse. 

 She has a children?s book on the way next year, titled Mirror of Fire and Dreaming, and another tale in the works, ?an ambitious project? that revisits the Mahabharata from the perspective of its women characters.

Magic of sound for sight

Finding the Ray Charles and Ravindra Jains of the 

country is the mission these two men have set out on. Hailing from an advertising 

background, George Abraham and Navroze D. Dhondy have set up Magiktuch in Delhi 

to provide a platform for the visually impaired with a mellifluous voice.

 ?Though we come across several talented people with visual impairment, most of them don?t know how to present themselves on stage, what clothes to wear or how to connect with the audience. This is a platform where they can showcase their skills and earn a living. We want to focus on packaging, performance and promotion,? says Dhondy, a marketing consultant. The artistes will receive performance fees and it will be a commercially viable project for them, he assures.

 Among the singers who have assured Dhondy and Abraham of pitching in with their inputs are Shubha Mudgal, Palash Sen, Usha Uthup, Sharon Prabhakar, Manna De and Ravindra Jain.

 ?The idea was born in February last year when we had gone to Lahore for a cricket series between India and Pakistan for the visually impaired. We had taken with us a blind singer Manju Magoo who enthralled the audience at a concert attended by ex-cricketer Zaheer Abbas, actor Sanjay Khan and his wife, and several Pakistani film stars,? says Abraham, chairman, Association for Cricket for the Blind in India.

 Magiktuch was formed soon after and both Dhondy and Abraham have been travelling across the country, scouting talent. The organisation will sign up agreements stretching a couple of years during which the singers will be groomed for stage shows. They will have the opportunity to perform in the country and abroad as well. 

 After auditioning around 90 candidates in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, Magiktuch has picked 10, comprising five instrumentalists and five vocalists. The screening conducted by Ustad Sultan Khan, Shibani Kashyap and others had initially short-listed 16 candidates who grabbed the chance to croon alongside the Sami Sisters ? Usha Uthup, Indira and Maya ? at India Habitat Centre in Delhi.

 A show at the crowded Centre Stage Mall in Noida followed soon after. ?At the auditions, we look at the raw talent, stage presence and the potential in him or her to grow as an artiste,? says Abraham, who is partially blind himself. 

 ?And the effect on showmanship after performing with Usha was immediate,? adds Dhondy.

 Abraham and Dhondy were in town last week to look at some local artistes and also finetune the details of a Calcutta concert by March-end. The show will feature some of the Magiktuch artistes alongside Ravindra Jain on stage.

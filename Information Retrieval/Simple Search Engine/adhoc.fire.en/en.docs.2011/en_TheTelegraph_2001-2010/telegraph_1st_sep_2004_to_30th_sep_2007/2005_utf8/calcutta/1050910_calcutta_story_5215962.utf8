The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The festive season is just a month away and peoplefrom the suburbs have already started their shopping trips to the city. Women pickpockets from neighbouring states also seem to have taken up their job in all earnest. They are having a field day snatching gold chains and picking purses in the ladies? compartments of local trains. The government railway police and the reserve police force should increase their vigil in these compartments, especially during rush hours.

 We, the residents of 22A, 22B/H1, 22B/H2 and 22B/H3 Beckbagan Row, are facing immense problems because of blocked drains, insufficient street lights and scarcity of water. Several pleas to the municipal offices have yielded no result as our premises fall under ?bustee area?. Illegal constructions are adding to the problem. We want the authorities to make these basic amenities available to us.

 About 20 days ago, I noticed that somebody had planted some saplings on the battered pavement in front of my house on Bentinck Street. In fact, there were saplings all over the place. Needless to say, the saplings died in a few days. I noticed a huge hoarding, courtesy the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, saying several lakh plants have been planted all over the city. How green is Calcutta now! 

 Sarbeswar Nayak, Bentinck Street.

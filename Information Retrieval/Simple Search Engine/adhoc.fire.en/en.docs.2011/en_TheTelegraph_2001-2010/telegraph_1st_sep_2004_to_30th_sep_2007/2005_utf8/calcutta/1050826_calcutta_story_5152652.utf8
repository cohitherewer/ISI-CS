 10 industrial parks for smaller players

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Busy hard-selling the state to big industry houses, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is also working on a plan to facilitate the growth of small and medium enterprises.

 The crux of the plan is creation of plug-and-play infrastructure for smaller units in and around the city. 

 From renting out space to offices to creating common infrastructure for toy manufacturers, hosiery product makers and more, the government has worked out a detailed plan for optimum utilisation of its land.

 ?There is a significant demand for such facilities from small-scale units and we are setting up 10 industrial parks in the vicinity of Calcutta. These parks will be ready in two years,? said Moinul Hassan, chairman, West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation (WBSIDC). 

 The government agency, which maintains 35 industrial parks across the state and has over 2,200 units as occupants, has already identified land in areas like Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), Tangra, Maniktala and Garia for the proposed parks. 

 With a number of private players showing interest in joining hands with the government, the WBSIDC has decided to use the public-private partnership model to develop these parks. It is also hopeful of bagging a part of the Rs 15-crore allocation made in the state budget for creation of industrial infrastructure for small units. 

 ?We have limited funds and so, we are roping in private parties to develop these parks. The land will be ours, while the private partner will develop the facility, keeping in mind the requirements of the units. We will try to ensure a fair price for these facilities,? added Hassan.

 The plan for a seven-storey, Rs 7-crore project in Saltlec ?for companies specialising in hardware and electronic items ? is ready and negotiations with private promoters have reached the final stages. 

 According to the plans, two parks ? one on a 10-acre plot and the other on a 31-cottah plot ? will come up in Maniktala.

 ?The bigger plot is ours, while we are in the process of acquiring the other one. As these parks will come up in residential areas, we will offer space to units under the green category,? clarified Hassan, adding that Martin amp; Burn has already been roped in to prepare detailed project reports.

 The chief minister, who recently flagged off the construction work for Shilpa Niketan, an industrial complex in Garia, is taking a keen interest in the development of these facilities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

 The first month of 2005 has been rather more eventful 

than we would have liked ? from picking up the pieces of a natural calamity to 

a tragedy of a man-made nature. But this weekend, if you can get your mind off 

the mayhem, there is plenty to chatter about, both inane and otherwise.

Pasture-ised

If you are losing sleep trying to make sense of the 

contradictions of the world, take a page out of Gunter Grass? book. The German 

Nobel laureate may have famously called Calcutta a ?pile of shit?, but that doesn?t 

mean the writer loves it any less. His affection is clear when, coming back after 

18 years, the 77-year-old misses the cows on the streets (hopefully, he won?t 

miss the absence of refuse from absent bovine sources). He also provides the right 

tone to show off your deep, literary side. While your pals take up arms in Calcutta?s 

defense, compare Grass? gritty, no-nonsense take on the town with the romanticism 

of a City of Joy, and watch the fireworks start.

Privacy pirates

The flashbulb has turned on the media of late, and 

the whole town is now talking about Page 3. There is enough on the same 

theme to sustain an entire evening?s table-time talk. Start with Konkona?s great 

performance in a good film, move on to Nicole Kidman?s listening device, and think 

back not too long ago to a time when the Kareena-Shahid lip lock was what all 

eyes were glued to. Where does it stop, the angry audience is sure to ask, just 

before pulling out camera phones to capture that cute couple coochie-cooing on 

the dance floor of a steamy night club?

 Fashion armpit

If Calcutta is the armpit of the country?s fashion 

industry, will Naomi still strut her sultry self through town? Give voice to your 

anxiety, after design duo Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla tore the city?s style sensibility 

to shreds. If a contestant doesn?t make it through to the final round of Lakme 

Fashion House, will that dash chances of supermodel Naomi Campbell coming 

down for the February promo? It might only be a whisper of a chance, but it is 

enough to get some torrid tongues wagging. Just make sure none of your fashion 

designer-type friends are around when you start off.

Seventh time lucky

Scorsese fans are sure to have only one thing on their 

lips this weekend ? the guru?s latest chance at winning a small golden statuette 

all for himself. The man who has made films like Taxi Driver, Raging 

Bull, The Color of Money, Cape Fear, Casino and Gangs 

of New York, has, unbelievably, never won an Oscar despite six previous nominations. 

Once again, he is in the running in the best director category for The Aviator. 

But whether he gets it or not, fans are sure to insist that his genius is old 

news: even a kid could figure that out when the veteran voiced the role 

of Sykes in Shark Tale.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Fresh ripple in the old new wave

 At IIM Calcutta, SHYAM BENEGAL may have come down heavily on Bollywood potboilers, but his next celluloid venture is a Rahman musical with Urmila Matondkar, writes Pratim D. Gupta

 Urmila Matondkar will play the title role of Chamki in Benegal?s next film, adapted from the musical Carmen

 The old new Indian cinema. That?s what septuagenarian Shyam Benegal calls his recent creations. But even in his lighter moments, he comes down heavily on the term parallel cinema.

 ?The word parallel suggests that the films are running parallel to another form of cinema. But these films have been running on their own.? The veteran film-maker had to explain it all, all over again, on Friday as he delivered the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Oration at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta, organised by the Management Centre for Human Values.

 Talking about Communications and Culture: Tradition, Modernity and Post-modernism in Indian Cinema, Benegal was predictably critical of the popular cinema made in Mumbai, taking great care in avoiding the term Bollywood. ?It is like the biryani which has to have every flavour,? he said to sniggers and chuckles from the management professors and students of the Joka institute. ?It will be interesting to find out what keeps the audience engaged to such cinema. Even the stories are so na?ve and what?s more, they take themselves so seriously.?

 But Benegal also defended the Mumbai movies calling them unique in their own way. ?No other society will accept two people bursting into songs out of nowhere. They are also getting popular with other ethnic groups. People in central Asia and parts of Africa just love these movies. They are not even dubbed in their local languages. They don?t understand the stories. They just love the way the songs come on. Also, if you look at the foreign critics, they used to only review films by Satyajit Ray, Goutam Ghose and maybe Buddhadeb Dasgupta. Now they are reviewing films made in Mumbai.?

 Declaring the death of rural India in our cinema, Benegal also linked this trend with multiplex mania. ?It does not have a market anymore. Movies are no longer made for those 1,000-seater screens with tickets priced at Rs 5. The money has to be recovered quickly by making movies for those 100 people who will pay Rs 200 each at the multiplex. So, naturally, the films are designed to meet the aspirational aspect of an upper-middle-class audience. Here, Ambassador cars are extremely down market. So every family member in the film Sarkar moves in Lexus Sedans and SUVs. Similarly, Bunty Aur Babli?s idea of the good life is five-star comfort with liberal doses of night life and cabarets.?

 But the maker of cult classics like Ankoor, Bhumika and Manthan doesn?t rule out the chances of multiplexes actually helping create intelligent cinema. ?The audience is no longer a single grey mass. There are niche markets in the audience. The idea of the unpredictable story is slowly emerging. I don?t think a film like Iqbal would have been made 10-15 years back but today it has become so hugely successful.?

 Benegal?s last film Bose: The Forgotten Hero, made on a lavish scale with foreign actors thrown in, didn?t set the domestic box-office on fire. ?The problem was caused by me,? he admitted. ?I made a film much too long ? three-and-a-half hours. That makes it a problem in terms of release. In today?s mode, films can only make money if they are released in multiplexes with five to six shows a day. But since my film became too long, the multiplex owners lost out on crowds. So they played it very early in the morning or very late in the night. But now I have cut it short by half-an-hour and the next time it?s shown, it will be a three-hour film.?

 Like always, though, Shyambabu is on to his next project ? Chamki, a desi version of Georges Bizet?s famous musical Carmen, which has been made for stage and screen in almost every country. He has again gone for a big Bollywood name, like he did with Karisma Kapoor in Zubeidaa. Urmila Matondkar, who played the little girl in Benegal?s Kalyug, will play the vivacious Chamki, a member of a tribal community of musicians and mendicants who live close to the Indo-Pak border in Rajasthan. Jimmy Shergill plays the male lead of a BSF officer sent to arrest Chamki for indulging in cross-border smuggling.

 ?It?s just an adaptation of Carmen,? revealed Benegal. ?It will be a musical all right. My films haven?t previously used that much of music because the subject didn?t demand it. But sometimes the content asks for music and sometimes you need to use music to make a story larger than life.? Chamki will be set to music by Benegal favourite A.R. Rahman and shooting will only begin later this year in Rajasthan.

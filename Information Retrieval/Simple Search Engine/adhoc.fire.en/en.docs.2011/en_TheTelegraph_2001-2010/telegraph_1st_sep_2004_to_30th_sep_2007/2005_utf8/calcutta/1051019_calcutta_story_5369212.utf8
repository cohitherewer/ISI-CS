 Checking out fresh green vegetables, meat and chicken at New Market, savouring phuchka, bhelpuri, tikias and kebabs at the roadside stalls around the market ? that is what kept Alan Bird, head chef of The Ivy, London, busy on Tuesday afternoon. Bird is in town to cook up traditional British fare at the Westview Bar and Grill in ITC Sonar Bangla.

Stop 1: Saag saga

 Upon entering New Market, which he insisted on calling by its original name S.S. Hogg Market, Bird asked to be directed straight to the vegetable market.

 You cant take a chef too far away from his kitchen. Food is always uppermost on his mind. And upon inquiry I have found out that this is one of the best places to check out such stuff, he said.

 And the man who counts the likes of Tom Cruise and David Beckham among his clientele, seemed quite impressed at the wide variety of vegetables available and their freshness.

 The hand that feeds Royalty, too, had a feel of everything on offer, from the cabbages to the tomatoes, much to the delight of the vegetable sellers.

 Admiring the array of saag, Bird added: Calcuttans I see are very fond of these, I see them all over the place. I believe you can cook up a whole lot of delicacies with them...

Stop 2: Biryani beckons

 No sooner was he done with the vegetables that the master chef moved on to the meat section, a trifle disappointed that the fish market had shut down by the time he made it there.

 I was really keen on checking out the fish market. I have heard its a sight. Maybe some other time when I come back...

 But there was no lack of enthusiasm on his part when he checked out the meat on offer, examining it from all sides in a bid to check freshness and quality.

 Is this the meat you use to make your biryani? I am thoroughly inspired by the fare I had at Karims in Delhi and I am actually thinking of introducing the dish as part of the British cuisine with a few innovations. Maybe I will use small game birds instead of the meat or chicken used here. That will be a very good fusion dish and I am sure will go down well with my clients.

Stop 3: Masala man

 Then, a quick move to the main market, but what he was keen on checking out was once again different from the stuff one generally goes to New Market for. Bird preferred going into shops where there was a whole lot of spices on offer and chatted up shopkeepers on each of their specialities and their origin. The paneer sold in these shops also caught his fancy, particularly the manner in which it was weighed on the scales.

Stop 4: Phuchka fan

 Finally, it was time to grab a bite. Some authentic street food, at that. I have been seeing people flocking around these little stalls, now I want to find out what its all about. Coffee and pizzas can wait, smiled Bird as he made his way towards a phuchka seller and gulped down those round things with lots of tamarind juice. The verdict: simply amazing.

 The fun had only just begun. Bird then hopped on to the bhelpuri counter, trying out the different varieties of chaat, not to forget the Chicken Tikka Kebabs that he dug into.

 Kebabs by the roadside is altogether a different experience. And it tastes so great. They are hot and spicy, gushed the chef whose West Street restaurant boasts a waiting time of six months for a newcomer.

 This has indeed been a great afternoon. The trip to Calcutta has been a great one. I have met some great people, tasted some amazing food in equally delightful surroundings and have a lot to talk about once back to London, he waved goodbye.

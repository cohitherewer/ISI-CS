 Salute to puja stars

 On Mahashtami night, the queue to a Behala pandal had lengthened beyond a kilometre, touching Diamond Harbour Road. At every other big-banner puja in the locality, subject to similar crowd pressure, the minimum time for darshan was two hours. ?But at Behala Club we were peacefully out in under an hour,? Sharmila Chakraborty, a housewife from Thakurpukur, had breathed a sigh of relief.

 Moments before taking the stage at the felicitation ceremony of the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, Dipak Banerjee of Behala Club admitted that crowd control was an area the volunteers had been trained in. ?There was no respite even in the morning with people pouring in from the districts. But our boys stayed put.?

 And before holding the dhak-and-kanshor trophy aloft, the club members thanked the organisers ? CESC, The Telegraph, HCL Beanstalk, Concern for Calcutta and Power FM ? not for crowning them the Model Puja of 2005 but for motivating Puja organisers to be mindful of fellow citizens.

 The venue was St Xavier?s College auditorium. The time was Friday evening. The third edition of the award that looks beneath the surface sheen and beyond the immediate occasion had brought together organisers, big and small, who had contributed towards making Durga puja more committed to society.

 But don?t organisers turn their back as soon as the Pujas are over? ?Ring 98300-63669 if you have a doubt,? claimed Binod Shaw, treasurer of Ajeya Sanghati in Haridebpur. The club, making the Star cut for the third consecutive year with a Four-Star report card, has a standing team of 35. ?Call up this number, whenever. Our blood donor will reach you.? Shaw recently helped out a Jodhpur Park Girls? School teacher with A-negative blood of his own.

 The women from Saradiya Sammilani in Gariahat who had come to collect a Three-Star certificate did not have any such a claim. Rather, they were all too keen to share the credit with the para populace. ?Perhaps it?s the spirit of togetherness that the judges (Derek O?Brien, Shuvaprasanna and Pallavi Chatterjee) liked,? Sriparna Basu offered.

 Another Three-Star puja elated at the achievement was True Spirit debutant Olabibitala Sarbojaninin from Shibpur, Howrah. ?It was beyond our expectations that the judges would actually cross the river. If we get this kind of support, Howrah pujas can rise like Behala has,? Akhilbandhu Bhattacharya said.

 Behala was indeed the flavour of the evening with as many as eight awards (including the top three places). Every time a Behala club walked up, the crowd murmured ?Abar Behala?? Members of Nandana Yuba Sangha, one of the two Five-Star pujas that had woven a magic spell with Midnapore mat, defended the Behala bias. ?Behala deserves this. Go to the pujas in north or central Calcutta; the attitude is of despair or callousness.?

 Behala Agradut Club, the other Five-Star puja, kept as quiet as the lighting and the ambience that had marked its pandal. ?The fact that we consumed so little electricity must have worked to our advantage,? felt Tapan Choudhury.

 Things were anything but muted in the auditorium when Pratik Chowdhury had taken the stage earlier with his rendition of classics. Sailing from Salil Chowdhury to SD Burman and later from Kishore Kumar to Adnan Sami, the crooner got the crowd cheering for more.

 The mood was just as festive when CESC executive director Dilip Sen walked up on stage and the dhakis worked up quite a crescendo for the final honours in the True Spirit category.

 But a sombre note was introduced when participants of The Telegraph Hand in Hand, presented in association with HCL Beanstalk and Centurion Bank, were called on stage. From among the 60 apartments, two stood out for extending a hand to the less-privileged.

 Jalabayu Bihar on the E.M. Bypass, had curtailed its budget to provide educational support to children from an orphanage. And while the Behala Club volunteers were busy managing pandal-hoppers, the 72 families of Debjan Apartment in Bansdroni were sharing Ashtami bhog with challenged children from a nearby home. A salute to the true spirit of the pujas from outside the fold of the contest.

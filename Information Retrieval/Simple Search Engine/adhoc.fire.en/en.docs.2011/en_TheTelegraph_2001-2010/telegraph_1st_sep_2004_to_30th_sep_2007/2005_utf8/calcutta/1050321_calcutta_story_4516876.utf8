Tommy Hilfiger, the 20-year-old internationally acclaimed lifestyle brand, has come to town. After six free-standing stores across the country ? two in Delhi, one each in Bangalore, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Hyderabad ? the Calcutta outlet was launched on Saturday at 10, Elgin Road.

 Marking the launch was a show of fashion and fun, in true Tommy Hilfiger style, with a lavish after-party in BED, the nightclub on Ballygunge Circular Road.

 ?This is not another apparel store coming to town, it?s a whole new way of life that we have gifted Calcutta,? claims Darshan Mehta, president of Arvind Murjani Brands Private Limited (AMBPL), the company in India responsible for bringing Tommy Hilfiger to the country.

 The exclusivity is evident in the look and feel of the 3,000 sq ft store with a glass fa?ade and an interesting array of mannequins. The spacious interiors have been done up with teakwood flooring and adorned with leather trimmings and plush carpets. Cosy leather sofas complete the classy look of the place. Books written by the designer are stocked in the store for the casual browser along with pictures that inspired Hilfiger, and guitars on the walls to capture the ?lively and musically inclined? spirit of the creator of the $1.9 billion global apparel company.

 ?We were very particular about the location and the look of the store simply because a brand as vibrant and classy as Tommy Hilfiger requires a lot of visual merchandising. It?s as much about owning a Tommy Hilfiger piece as is the shopping experience that comes with it,? adds Mehta.

 Expecting the well-travelled, fashion-conscious Calcuttan with a taste for the best to indulge himself in the wide range of offerings, the store also aims at boosting the aspiration levels of the young buyer.

 ?While we are expecting people to come in and start picking up an upper for a Rs 2,000 immediately, but for the higher range of garments and accessories we expect Calcuttans to aspire for and acquire them in the course of time,? shares Mehta. 

 The new store houses some stylish denims, sportswear, fragrances and other retail accessories like handbags, belts and leather goods. And what the Calcutta buyer can look forward to now is the Spring Summer collection on display which is ?all about peppy sportswear? in a variety of colours and chic styles.

 assic with a twist is the style mantra here. Women have a wide choice, be it the re-shaped classic polo-adding necklines or paisley prints. Sporty capris with contrasting belts, striped Tees or colourful shirts, there?s something for everyone.

 For men, cotton blazers, smart woven shirts and comfortable T-shirts are aplenty. The signature Tommy and Tommy Girl fragrance, along with the Freedom fragrance for men and women are on the stands, as are the newly-launched bath and body products and Color cosmetics. 

 Golfwear, swimwear, watches and bags ? the list is endless, as is the variety. In the footwear section, formal closed shoes, sandals and of course the sneakers abound. While garments start at Rs 1,300, the bed and bath range is priced between Rs 475 and Rs 2,495.

 The store launch with models Upen Patel, Jesse Randhawa and Ella Daniel over with, the after-party at BED saw the city?s party animals in action. The Tollywood brigade of Pallavi, Sreelekha, Koneenica and Arindam mingled with a handful of Mumbai models and grooved to the beats of DJ Lloyd. The senior showbiz brigade was represented by actresses Shabana Azmi and Aparna Sen.

 ?She is a prostitute, I am a widow?

 Billed as the surprise package of Mangal Pandey mdash; The Rising, AMISHA PATEL spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about not being intimidated by the Rani of the industry and shifting focus from attire to acting

 ONE IN TWO: JWALA amp; AMISHA

 You are said to be the surprise package of Mangal Pandey...

 (Laughs) Even I have heard that from a couple of places. But period films have been really very lucky for me. First there was Gadar ? Ek Prem Katha and now there?s Mangal Pandey. It was a very pleasant experience shooting for the film, getting to work and enjoy at the same time. 

 The role itself was very challenging and it went on to transform my entire film career. I have been used to doing these typical roles, dancing around trees in every film. The emphasis has been mostly on clothes rather than acting.

 And here you play a widow?

 Yes, it?s a challenge I took up. I don?t think any other actress would agree to play the role of a widow so early in her career. There?s no make-up whatsoever. It?s completely deglamourised with me wearing white throughout the film. There?s no extensive hairdo. And most importantly I had to emote through my eyes. That?s something which is so hard to do. To emote through dialogues is so much easier.

 Wasn?t Aishwarya first offered the role?

 I have no issue with Aishwarya being offered the role before me. I didn?t manipulate to get the role. It fell into my lap... I agreed to do it.

 No insecurities of playing second fiddle to Rani Mukherjee in the film?

 Not at all. Rani and I are so completely different in the film. She is a prostitute. I am a widow. She is so vibrant and I am demure. In fact, Rani helped elevate my role. See, all the artistes in the movie are my seniors even though I am fairly senior. Rani has been here for seven more years than me. Aamir (Khan) has been 15 more years in the industry. Toby (Stephens) is senior too. So I got to learn a lot of things from all of them.

 nMost of your scenes are with Toby Stephens?

 And you get to learn so much from him. He was so much in awe of the Indian culture and roots. He even got a Hindi tutor for the lines. So never for a second did I feel that I was acting with someone from a different culture who doesn?t speak my tongue.

 You have had a very dry run at the box-office in recent times?

 Every artiste goes through ups and downs in his or her career. Two years ago you had written Rani off and look where she is now. You even wrote off Shah Rukh and Aamir after Baadshah and Mela. The industry is very fickle. A successful movie is something which nobody can predict. An artiste is good if he or she is good in a film. Mr Bachchan will be good irrespective of which film he is in. 

 Here, a star is born every Friday. For someone it?s day, for someone it?s night. So, I don?t bank on any particular film anymore. All the films are equally important to me.

 What?s after Mangal Pandey?

 There?s Tathastu with Sanjay Dutt where I play a mother for the second time. It?s a very emotional film set in a middle-class family. In Humko Tumse Pyar Hai, I play a blind Rajasthani girl in a love triangle with Bobby Deol and Arjun Rampal. Then there?s an untitled murder mystery opposite Sunny Deol. And, of course, there?s the much-awaited Mere Jeevansaathi where I act opposite Akshay Kumar for the first time.

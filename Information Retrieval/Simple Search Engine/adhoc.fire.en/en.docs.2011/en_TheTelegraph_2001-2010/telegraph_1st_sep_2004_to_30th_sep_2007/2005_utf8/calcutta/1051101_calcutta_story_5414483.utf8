 Time to rock on the river 

 - Barges emerge as preferred destination for parties

 Post-Diwali, run to the river if you cannot put up with land-locked revelry, but don?t forget to pack your party gear. For, the barge is emerging as a preferred party destination this festive season.

 Revelry on the river is the latest craze and the Hooghly is ready to be dotted with vessels, all lit up and raring to rock.

 ?Following the trend in Mumbai, where even some of the nightclubs go empty because people prefer partying on a cruise, Calcuttans are starting to get hooked to the idea of partying on the river. And this festive season is just the beginning,? says Samrat Roy Choudhury of SRC Waterways and Land Development Company.

 ?The crowd is generally a congregation of family and friends who want to have a party with a difference. From a DJ to exotic dishes, all the entertainment options are at hand,? adds Roy Choudhury.

 Sanjay Agarwal, whose event management company Solitaire Events is busy organising Diwali bashes, draws up a prescription for an off-shore party: ?You need the coming together of the entire family, a relaxed environment and song and dance. A cruise provides all three.?

 When the gang is a big one, the hiring cost of a bash on the barge works out quite well ? Rs 2,500 per hour on weekdays, with another Rs 1,000 added by the hour for weekends.

 ?As autumn sets in, the weather?s fine for a cruise and it?s a nice change from the regular cramped discotheque. Moreover, here you don?t have to rub shoulders with strangers as you choose the company you want to keep,? says Rishi Dhanuka, a regular river reveller.

 In a boost to the barge-bash culture, the entertainment wing of SRC Waterways, SRCINC, will be hosting a mega party with the ?biggest floating dance floor? and a footfall of 500 in the countdown to Christmas. Three barges will sail upstream to Belur from Millennium Park.

 ?With the December 10 party, we will be launching the new flat-deck open barge, boasting a 1,000-sq-ft dance floor (on the upper deck), making it the biggest floating dance floor in the country. There will also be a bar, a full-fledged kitchen and safety equipment. Mumait Khan (of Munna Bhai MBBS fame) will be the celebrity guest and making music will be DJ Tushqa,? smiles Samrat.

 The number of parties on MV Ahalya has also doubled since Vivada Inland Waterways started letting it out for parties. ?During the season (October to March), there is a party every evening. The river, and the pollution-free-noise-free atmosphere are the high points of partying on a cruise,? says a spokesperson for Vivada.

 And things can only get better, assures the barge brigade, with commercial parties poised to push prices down.

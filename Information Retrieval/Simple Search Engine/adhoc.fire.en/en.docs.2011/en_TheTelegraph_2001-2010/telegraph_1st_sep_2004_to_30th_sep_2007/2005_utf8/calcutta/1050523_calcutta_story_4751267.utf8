 The AX effect

 LIFESTYLE ZONE

 Even the simplest outfit can be carried off to gorgeous effect with the help of a striking accessory ? be it a chunky neckpiece, a shoulder-tickling earring or a vibrant silk scarf.

 Indeed, with individualism being the keyword in fashion right now, nothing can help you stand out in the crowd more than an interesting add-on.

 And if youre on an accessory hunting spree, few places in the city can offer you more variety than AX on Loudon Street. This one-stop accessory shop stocks everything from jewellery and bags to stoles and scarves. Even key chains arent left out. 

 A joint venture by Priti Kanoria and Sanjay Churiwalla, AX upped its shutters in August 2003. When we opened this store, the concept of a standalone accessory shop was rare in Calcutta. But mix and match is the flavour in fashion now and accessories play an important role, says Priti.

 Most pieces on the racks of AX are sourced from Mumbai, Delhi or overseas, and keeps up with the latest trends.

 Stole style

 Scarves and stoles in a variety of fabrics throw up stylish buys to match every silhouette. You can find both ethnic cottons and dressier ones in crepe and georgette, embellished with sequins, embroidery and prints.

 If singles arent your style, the store also offers interesting coordinates where stoles come with matching small bags.

 We have introduced sets of stoles and bags where both pieces sport the same colour code and embellishments, adds Priti.

 The pricing of the scarves and stoles doesnt pinch the pockets much either, with the singles starting as low as Rs 150 and the coordinated sets at Rs 300.

 Gem glam

 The jewellery selection too caters to a range of tastes and budgets. There are two sections in this segment ? costume jewellery and silver. While the former boasts of chic contemporary and western styles, the latter comprises more traditional and ethnic pieces. Coloured stones are used generously in both sections, on designs both chunky and delicate. Colourful bangles with geometric shapes, pearl-drop necklaces and funky earrings steal the show in the costume jewellery category.

 Heavy bridal sets in real silver ranging up to Rs 7,000, are the most expensive pieces on offer at AX. These are often gold-polished or rhodium-plated. The antique designs in filigree can be picked up in full sets or single pieces.

 Bag it

 The variety of bags is almost as wide as it can get. Clutches, party purses, wallets, sling bags and casual totes fill the racks. These come in a variety of colours and fabrics, be it suede, leather or jute. Multi-tone bags with prints and even intricate embroidery are the high point of the collection.

 This section has much to woo the kids as well, with bags and pretty purses plastered with favourite cartoon characters.

 The other item that catches the eye is embroidered cell phone holders. While the price point starts fairly low, most items sure to grab your attention will come with a price tag of around Rs 600, on average.

 Trendy trinkets

 If you have been tuning into the fashion fiesta at the Cannes film festival, theres no chance you could have missed the dainty clips that fashionistas are sporting on their tresses. Though more often than not the pieces were diamond studded, you can at least borrow the concept.

 The collection of delicate hair clips at AX will tempt you to adorn your locks with one of these the next time you tuck it all away in a French twist. If casual is more your style, however, go for the trendy scrunchies in various patterns and prints.

 The other knick-knacks the store offers include stylised bindis and stick-on tattoos. Wooden key chains with funky animal designs could add a final touch of cute to your look.

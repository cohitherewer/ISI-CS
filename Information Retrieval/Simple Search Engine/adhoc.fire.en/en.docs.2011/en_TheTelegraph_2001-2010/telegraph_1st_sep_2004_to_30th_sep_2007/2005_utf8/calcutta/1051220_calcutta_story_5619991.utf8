 Cave-in fails to curb festive spirit

 The roof collapse on Sunday did not dent the shopping spirit on Monday. New Market was its bustling December self 24 hours after a huge concrete slab fell on three shops.

 The shop-owners started Christmas countdown week with some apprehension, but soon it was business as usual at New Market.

 For most, it was Nahoum?s nostalgia or X?mas knick-knacks that scored over the roof wreck.

 ?I hardly come to New Market in the entire year but make it a point to visit it at this time. Christmas is incomplete without Nahoum?s Christmas cakes and the Christmas decoration accessories from shopkeepers near the grand canon. This is the best time to be at New Market,? said Alfred Wong, a shopper on Monday afternoon.

 ?We read about the cave-in in the papers. At any other time of the year, it might have stopped us from coming here, but it?s hard to give New Market a miss in December. The colourful Christmas trees and the aroma of fresh cakes draw us here,? said another shopper, Shefali Dey.

 The shop-keepers sure weren?t complaining. ?We are doing brisk business today. The number of buyers has risen today as we are nearing Christmas,? said a busy attendant at Nahoum?s.

 But the tale could have been a tragic one if the slab had fallen on a weekday, when the market is chock-a-block with traditional X?mas shoppers.

 ?The last three weeks of December is the most crucial period for this market. There are many shops that depend on sales during this period to tide them over,? says Sanjay Shaoo of NK Shaoo in Block A.

 A meeting of the shop-owners with Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials on Monday evening did not make much headway.

 ?The problem is that the authorities have bigger plans for a New Market makeover but they are turning a blind eye to the immediate problems. They do not have a clear plan as to how to fix the broken roof. First, these small problems have to be tackled,? said Ram Mangalani, secretary, New Market Shop Owners Association.

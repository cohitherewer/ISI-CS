The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Penalty unjust for just demands

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should students be punished if their agitation affects academic activities on campus?

 Up in arms: A student agitation at Calcutta University

 Anil kumar sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane

 Academic activities definitely suffer due to student agitation on campus. In fact, any kind of agitation or disturbance on campus would take a toll on academics. But what compelled students to start the agitation must be found out. If the cause is just, the question of punishment does not arise. Such agitations should not be put down, no matter what the venue.

 R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Politicisation of education by leaders of political parties has spoilt the atmosphere in educational institutions. If a students? agitation affects academic activities, they must be punished. But the punishment should be kept to a minimal level.

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

 If there exists a genuine grievance, students can be allowed to agitate peacefully, but not to the extent that academic activities are hampered. For example, the recent protest at Jadavpur University affected classes and should not have been allowed. Campuses are certainly not training grounds for politicians.

 DInabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala

 Students? unions have the right to choose the path of peaceful protest to fulfil their demands. If an agitation takes a violent turn, those responsible can be punished as per the rules of the institution. But attempt on the part of the authorities to put down a protest with the help of police cannot be justified. Disruption of academic activities by students should lead to punishment only if their demands are unjustified. To avoid matters reaching such a state, the administrators must take the initiative to arrive at a solution through discussion. The government, too, should intervene if an agitation continues for too long. 

 DebasisH Chakraborty,

 Students are wise enough to choose the right course of action. They should be persuaded to withdraw their agitation if it affects academic activities on campus. Drastic action should not be taken against any agitating student.

Sandhya Banerjea,

 Salt Lake 

 Students should not be punished if their agitation is for a genuine cause. At the same time, it must be remembered that universities and other academic institutions are places of learning, and unruly students should in no way disrupt academic activities there. The head of an institution should take a call on the validity of the students? demand. Unrest among students can paralyse campuses, so issues of conflict should be resolved through discussion at the earliest.

 Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park

 Students are well within their rights to agitate if they are victimised. It is up to the custodians of educational institutions to listen to the students and redress their grievances. No effort should be spared to maintain a proper environment in educational institutions. 

 Kaberi Mukherjee,

 Santosh Roy Road

 Students who agitate and hamper academic activities of an institution must be punished. Every college or university has a disciplinary code and no student or organisation has the right to violate it. Students cannot protest against injustice by tarnishing the reputation of their institute and by jeopardising the lives and careers of others. However, the punishment meted out to guilty students should be humane.

 Sukanta Pachal,

 Howrah

 Students should be brought to book if their activities jeopardise academic pursuits. But they should not be punished without taking into account their grievances. Students certainly have a right to call attention to their demands through peaceful means. 

 Debashis Saha,

 Anath Deb Lane

 Students must be punished if they violate the rules of their institution. Their primary duty is not to agitate, but to educate themselves. Student unions have disrupted academic activities several times in our state, with disastrous consequences. While it is true that there are flaws within the system, they must be rectified through discussion. In most cases, there is no need to go in for an agitation.

 Naren Sen,

 BN Lahiri Lane 

 Students should concentrate on their studies and not waste valuable time by participating in agitations. Long-drawn protests invariably affect academic activities. The reason behind an agitation should determine whether students participating in it are punished or not. If the protest has the potential to improve the students? lot, there is no question of punishment, even if academic activities are hampered. It is the responsibility of the authority of educational institutions to ensure that students do not get involved in undesirable activities. A small section of students can spoil the careers of others by creating unnecessary trouble. 

 Samyak Nandy, 

 Bangur Avenue

 There is no question of punishing students for taking part in agitations. Students protest only when things go awry. They are not lunatics, and hence would not cause trouble for no reason and fall foul of the authorities.Agitation by students is the only way to address problems in educational institutions. 

 Tuhin Purkayastha,

 Parnashree Pally

 College politics destroys the lives of many students. Authorities should have the right to punish students for any kind of negligence towards studies . 

 Pijush Nandi,

 Barasat

 Student agitation on campus would clearly be against the authorities of the institutions. The onus lies with the latter to bring such situations under control. Punishment should be the last option. 

P. Pramanik,

 Address not given

 Inefficient administration leads to student agitations. If the people at the helm are enlightened, sympathetic and flexible, then such protests can be nipped in the bud.

 A.K. Mitra,

 Padmapukur Road

 Whether the students should be punished or not depends on the cause of the agitation. However, the punishment should not harm their career. They can be made to pay a fine or teach poor students for free. Students, on their part, should remember that politics has no place in academic institutions.

 Aritra Ganguly,

 Gangulybagan

 In an ideal scenario, academic activities should not be disrupted in the campus. But unfair and harsh regulations imposed by the officials demand that the students voice their protests in accordance to their democratic rights. Severe punishments instead of a conciliatory attitude only helps to vitiate the atmosphere. 

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 Discipline makes a nation great. Protest against injustice is right only if it is done legally and in a non-violent manner. Students should discuss their demands with the heads of their institutions without starting an agitation. They should be punished if they resort to violence. 

 Shrijit Venkatesh,

 Salt Lake

 Most children do their homework and take studies seriously only for fear of being punished in school. Till they learn to differentiate between right and wrong, this fear is necessary to discipline them. However, punishment should be in the form of extra projects or a test rather than corporal punishment. The latter only instills a repulsive feeling towards whatever the child is being forced to do and will cause more harm than good. 

 Rupen Das,

 Nagerbazar

 If the students are protesting against the authorities of an educational institution, only the government or a judicial committee should have the right to punish them, if necessary. It is not by any means wrong for students to take the path of protest, even if it hampers academic activities.

 Victoria Memorial: Security aspect

 The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), assigned by the Union government to look after the security at Indian Museum, has also prepared a comprehensive plan for Victoria Memorial Hall. 

 This will cover not only the Hall?s security, but also help the authorities develop its huge compound.

 About eight months ago, the department of culture of the Union government had urged the Memorial authorities to tighten their existing security arrangements. 

 On the department?s request, the Hall authorities have met several times, and later urged the CISF to prepare a comprehensive plan, covering security arrangements and other related issues, like developing better fire-safety measures and finding out ways to protect the heritage building from any natural disaster.

 Curator-secretary of the Hall Chittaranjan Panda said on Monday that they will get the comprehensive plan, now with the National Institute of Design (NID), within a month. ?After we get it, we will take up the issue with the Union government,? Panda said. 

 The new governor, who is also chairman of the Memorial?s trustee board, has advised the authorities to ?attach paramount importance? to the security and safety of the Hall, and work on a war footing to implement the new security and safety network. 

 ?The governor assured us that he will help us as best as he can and take up the issue with the Centre to forestall theft or loss of any antique from the Hall,? Panda said.

 Now, 56 retired soldiers and 27 retired Calcutta Police officers are in charge of the security arrangements at the Hall, spread over 64 acres. 

 The Hall has three entry points and hundreds of visitors throng it, not only to have a look at its valuable collection but also to enjoy the lush greenery of the compound. Besides, there is a huge waterbody, spread over 15 acres. 

 Asked whether the Hall authorities would deploy the CISF, Panda said: ?The CISF is doing an excellent job at all the major airports, where the security arrangements are being looked after by it. Moreover, it is a government organisation and will try its best to help us, once it is given the job.?

 Asked about the fate of the existing security personnel engaged at Victoria Memorial once the CISF takes over, Panda said: ?There is no question of retrenchment. The CISF will redefine the roles of our own securitymen and use them in a more scientific way.? 

 Panda added: ?We will be able to maintain and protect the building when the monsoon rain causes damage to the structure once we get the comprehensive plan prepared by the CISF.?

 Some galleries will be modernised and ?we will consult the plan before going in for it?, he said. The plan will help conserve the greenery, Panda explained. 

 Last week, a meeting was held at Raj Bhavan, at which Union culture secretary Neena Ranjan and director of Indian Museum Shakti Kali Basu discussed security arrangements. It is learnt that the Hall security, too, was discussed.

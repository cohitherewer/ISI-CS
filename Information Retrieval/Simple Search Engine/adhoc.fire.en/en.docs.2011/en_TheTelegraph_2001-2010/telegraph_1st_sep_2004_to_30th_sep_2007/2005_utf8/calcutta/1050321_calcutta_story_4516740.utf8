 CMC alleges bank fraud

 - Rs 10-crore loss to civic body, three officers named in FIR

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities have lodged an FIR with New Market police station, alleging that three officers of the state-run Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) have caused the civic body a deliberate loss of over Rs 10 crore.

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som said on Sunday that he had lodged the FIR accusing the three officers of ?cheating the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) of a sum of Rs 10 crores on the strength of certain forged documents.?

 The bank?s management, however, termed the CMC?s filing a police complaint as ?going too far, unnecessarily?. It ordered a probe into the Rs 10-crore loss and the circulation of forged documents, as claimed by the CMC. 

 ?There was no need to go to the police. We could have sorted out the issue across the table. We have constituted a team to investigate the matter and fix responsibility,? said IOB chief regional manager Awani Rajan. 

 IOB chairman S.C. Gupta said over the telephone from Chennai that he was ?in talks with the Calcutta office for a clearer picture of the matter?. 

 Of the three officers named in the FIR, one is with the IOB?s regional office and the two others are with the branch on Mirza Ghalib Street.

 The CMC has 87 deposits in 20 branches of the IOB in the city, and the face value of total fixed deposits with them is Rs 58.28 crore. The total amount of overdraft now adds up to Rs 67.08 crore. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said the bank has ?misappropriated tax-payers? money? to the tune of Rs 10 crore by way of over-charging interest on the overdraft facilities that it has given to the CMC, keeping the civic body?s huge fixed deposits lying with the bank under lien.

 ?In my long political career, I have never come across a nationalised bank officially submitting a forged document to cheat a public institution,? said mayor Mukherjee.

 According to municipal commissioner Som, IOB?s over-charging of interest on overdrafts taken by the CMC came to light during reconciliation of the civic accounts in October 2004. 

 The CMC used to enjoy overdraft facilities from the IOB against invested term deposits at various rates of interest, ranging from 8.75 per cent to 12 per cent. 

 But instead of linking the interest charged on the overdraft with the interest on each term deposit, the bank has all along charged 14 per cent interest on the overdraft amount.

 The SBI Capital Markets Ltd, subsequently, confirmed the over-charging of interest by the IOB, and said in its report that ?the bank (IOB) has charged interest much in excess of the extent under RBI instructions from time to time?. 

 When the CMC insisted on the IOB refunding the excess amount of interest, it tried to deny the over-charging.

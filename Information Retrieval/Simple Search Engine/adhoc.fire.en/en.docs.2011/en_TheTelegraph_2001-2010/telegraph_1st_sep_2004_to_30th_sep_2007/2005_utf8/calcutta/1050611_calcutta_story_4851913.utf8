 Top cop glares at force for fudging 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Only arrests are not enough, crimes have to be solved. 

 That was police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee?s message to his force at a crime conference on Friday. Mukherjee came down heavily on his men for trying to impress with figures instead of solving crimes.

 At the three-hour conference with the divisional deputy police commissioners, officers-in-charge of police stations and section heads of the detective department, Mukherjee lashed out at the cops for jacking up the number of arrests in criminal cases without making recoveries or solving the cases. 

 ?I don?t want to know how many people have been arrested in connection with a case. I want detection and recovery. If the arrests are genuine, then why aren?t there any recoveries?? Mukherjee reportedly told officers at Lalbazar.

 He was particularly critical about the claims made by some of the section heads of the detective department. 

 The police commissioner?s censure follows severe criticism of the force for failing to make recoveries in connection with the murders of Tara Chand and Sarda Banka even after the arrest of prime suspect Kebol Roy from Bihar. Arrests have also not resulted in recoveries in a few dacoity cases in the Burrabazar and Posta area, leaving the cops in the dark.

 But it was not just fudged figures that riled the police commissioner. The growing incidence of thefts of cars and two-wheelers from parts of south Calcutta drew a sharp reaction from Mukherjee. Officers of Gariahat and Beniapukur police stations bore the brunt for their inability to check the thefts. 

 ?While expressing satisfaction about the way the law-and-order situation has been handled in various police station areas before the civic elections, the commissioner prescribed joint raids by officers of the detective department and local police stations to cut down on criminal activities,? said a senior officer of the detective department. 

 City detective chief Gyanwant Singh has been asked to coordinate the raids. 

 This is the second time in the past few months that police have been pulled up for the increasing incidence of thefts of cars and two-wheelers. 

 Investigations have so far revealed that organised rackets were at work behind the lifting of two-wheelers and selling them off across the border, in Khulna and Barishal, in Bangladesh.

 Students first, spat later: HC directive 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the principal and teacher-in-charge of Jogamaya Devi College, in south Calcutta, to jointly sign and send the applications of about 750 BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I examinees to Calcutta University by Wednesday.

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurker and Justice A.K. Ganguly also directed the university authorities to accept the applications, even though the last date of receiving the forms is over.

 The university had not accepted the forms earlier as they were not signed by the teacher-in-charge. 

 The judges warned the principal and teacher-in-charge ? now involved in a dispute ? that they would have to face contempt proceedings if the court order was not followed forthwith.

 ?The students cannot suffer because of your tussle. The court will not tolerate it if you want to play with their future,? the judges told the duo, present in court during Tuesday?s hearing.

 Last year, the university issued a suspension letter to principal Gargi Nath, following complaints against her by the students. 

 Challenging the validity of the letter, Nath moved the high court. Hearing her plea, a single bench passed an order asking her to continue as principal. Ashokendra Roy, president of the college governing body, then moved the division bench challenging the validity of the order.

 On March 22, the bench passed an interim order saying that Nath and teacher-in-charge Indira Mukherjee would jointly operate the college bank account.

 The lawyer of the college governing body told the court on Tuesday that the future of the students was in danger, as Nath was not cooperating with Mukherjee.

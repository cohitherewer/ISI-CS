The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A snip here, a snap there

 Moments from Wide Aisle?s production of 

Reader 

Copper-streaked ponytail, denims, brows knit in determination. 

Meet the fresh face of Delhi theatre. Meet Anirudh Nair (Roody to friends) on 

?a year?s break before joining postgraduate theatre studies in UK?.

 In his early 20s, Anirudh is already credited with launching Wide Aisle, a group of college and just-out-of college theatre enthusiasts. Anirudh is also the director of Wide Aisle?s first play outside Delhi ? Reader recently presented at Gyan Manch by Theatrecian and Coffee Pai.

 ?Many members of our group are from Calcutta, students of St Stephen?s college. We used to do the occasional college play but there was little scope outside,? said Anirudh, a history student whose interest in the subject had ?just given way to theatre?. The two shows of Reader at the India Habitat Centre, Delhi, had been packed to capacity and the audience at Gyan Manch was hardly indifferent.

 Wide Aisle?s Reader is an adaptation of a work by Chilean playwright Ariel Dorfman. It was chosen for its ?amazing relevance to the Indian situation as well as the ongoing policy, worldwide, of limiting personal freedom as a safety measure against terrorist attacks?.

 According to Anirudh: ?It is a very complex play which we knew would be difficult to pull off, but was well worth a try. It takes a strong stand against all forms of censorship, something we felt the Indian audience could best comprehend in the context of the film industry.?

 With the help of team member Nilanjana Bose, who has some links with Bollywood, Anirudh set about adapting the play. So we have Avinash Nathan, member of the film censor board from a future when everything is controlled by a repressive regime based on thought policing.

 When Nathan receives a film script by someone called Dev Mallik he is distraught to find that the life of the central protagonist of the script, Ronojoy Sen, bears a remarkable resemblance with his own murky past, complete with cowardice, avarice and betrayal. 

 For a while he rants around, suspecting all the people close to him, even his dead wife. But it soon becomes apparent that the events of the script are coming true and even whole dialogues are being repeated. Art imitating life had gained some control over life itself. Then the director steps in, to bring back order and ?decency?. All it takes, he says is ?a snip here and a snap there?. But does Nathan still have it in him to rebel against the regime?

 The group?s use of double roles and stage space broken up into alternately lit and darkened zones was effective. It wasn?t difficult to follow whenever a transcendence of boundaries occurred. 

 Perhaps the acting could have been more polished, the sets and costumes more imaginative, but then this is a new group just striving to find its feet. Actors in various roles were Arunabha Deb, Nilanjana Bose, Anirudh Nair, Anisha Sharma, Neel Chaudhuri, Neel Paul, Shayak Barman and Ronojoy Banerjee.

 nShakespeare taken off the shelf and tossed amidst the D company, the Buntys and Bablis? Shakespeare in danger or Shakespeare evolving with the times? Check out Mumbai?s Shakespeare Dhamaal to find out.

 Prithvi theatre, which has long hosted the annual Shakespeare festival, now has a weekly Dhamaal every Monday on its premises. Brainchild of theatre mentor Satyadev Dubey, the Dhamaal gives newcomers a chance to prove their worth.

 ?The theatre is closed on Mondays and there are so many young actors just waiting for an opportunity to appear before the public, so we started this thing,? Dubey told Metro from Mumbai.

 ?Initially, we didn?t define the parameters. People could come and perform just about anything for 10 minutes. But we found that these were mostly filmi imitations. Then I remembered that we had had such impromptu sessions on Marathi poetry that had been very successful, so we decided to do something on Shakespeare.?

 Why Shakespeare, why not some Indian writer? ?That?s the problem with you guys, you are never content! If something good is happening with Shakespeare why not? Why don?t you start something like this in your own city?? demanded Dubey.

 Point taken. There is no entry fee to Dhamaal ? nothing to perform and nothing to watch. Everything is on first-come-first-served basis. Show time starts from 7 pm. ?People are free to do anything with Shakespeare ? they can sing Shakespeare, dance Shakespeare, interpret Shakespeare anyway they like.?

 And ideas have been pouring in: condensed Shakespeare, scenes, monologues, discourses and all. Sometimes there are even film shows to reinforce the Dhamaal. Last Monday, Derek Jaman?s The Tempest, and Stanley Donen and Martin Scorcese?s Love?s Labour Lost were screened.

 Dhamaal Calcutta chapter, anyone?

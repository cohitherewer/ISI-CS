 Informer in murder held

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 After a prolonged hunt, police on Monday arrested Anup Yadav, 18, who had passed on information about 71-year-old widow Laxmi Narayan Sundaram to her assassins.

 The youth was held from Mullickbazar on a tip-off. A Kodak camera and a HMT watch were seized from him.

 Four days ago, sleuths from the detective department cracked the case and arrested five youths for committing the murder.

 Wife of MR Sundaram, a former chairman of GKW Ltd, Laxmi was murdered in her Bishop Lefroy Road flat on June 9, allegedly by the five youths. The plan was hatched on the basis of information provided by Anup.

 The body was found on the dining room floor. The almirahs in the flat had been rummaged and articles were strewn all over the flat. 

 ?Anup used to visit the building often with a friend and came to know of Laxmi. It now appears that he had visited the third-floor residence of the Sundarams? twice but couldn?t enter the flat,? said Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief.

 According to police, the teenager shared the information he obtained about Laxmi with Raju Wilson, an acquaintance from Loudon Street. The two later visited the Bishop Lefroy Road flat twice and surveyed the area.

 In the first week of June, Raju decided to attempt robbing the lady and informed his friends Sarawar Hossain, alias Seru, from McLeod Street, Sk Jahid from Loudon Street, Suresh Naik from Park Lane and Albert Pariyar from Alipur Road. 

 The group first tried to enter the flat on June 7, but the operation had to be aborted after Laxmi refused to open the door. Two days later, they turned up again, this time as courier boys carrying a packet with Mr Sundaram scribbled on top in red ink.

 The ploy worked. The gang overpowered Laxmi after entering the flat and tied her up before launching a hunt for valuables.

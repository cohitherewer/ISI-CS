 Branded an arty actress in tinsel 

 town, PERIZAAD ZORABIAN has finally hit it big in commercial 

 Bollywood as the leading lady of the Bachchan-starrer Ek Ajnabee. 

 The actress shares with Pratim D. Gupta the script-reading 

 experience with Big B, playing the perfect woman on screen 

 and her other forthcoming projects

How did you bag Ek Ajnabee?

 I?ve known producer Bunty Walia 

 for several years now. One day I got an SMS from him asking 

 me to come to his office. When you know someone so personally, 

 you can?t really tell him that I would like to work with 

 you. So when he told me, ?Babes, we are producing 

 Apoorva Lakhia?s next film and we would like you to do it,? 

 I was pleasantly surprised. Then I met Apu (Lakhia) who 

 is this very American, modern kind of a guy. We had a very 

 short meeting and I was on.

 So, you have finally got your 

 big Bollywood break?

 (Laughs) Oh yes. I have 

 been wanting to do a commercial Bollywood project for some 

 time now. I had got to a stage where I no longer expected 

 anything to happen. Let?s be realistic ? I was too well-placed 

 in an offbeat niche to get commercial offers. Also, when 

 you keep chasing something, it never happens. And when you 

 least expect it, it comes to you so easily. Never could 

 I have imagined that a friend like Bunty would offer me 

 my first big Bollywood film.

 Your first reactions about 

 working with Amitabh Bachchan?

 When I was playing this role of 

 a wannabe actress in Nagesh Kukunoor?s Bollywood Calling, 

 I couldn?t have imagined in my wildest dreams that one day 

 I would act with Amitabh Bachchan. Even a month back I couldn?t 

 have imagined it. I feel humble. I feel scared for the first 

 time by the enormity of it all. Then again, I don?t want 

 to think too much about it and would like to treat Ek 

 Ajnabee like any other project. I want to go out there 

 to have some fun and walk away with a great experience.

 What is the storyline?

 Ek Ajnabee is a take-off 

 on the Denzel Washington-starrer Man on Fire with 

 Bachchan playing Denzel?s role of the bodyguard to the kid. 

 He comes and stays with this family and in no time he becomes 

 the star of the family. The film works a lot on the emotional 

 levels as to how a stranger in the house changes the dynamics 

 of a family. Arjun Rampal plays Bachchan?s partner.

 Where do you figure in the 

 scheme of things? Any fear of getting lost in the crowd?

 Not at all. I play the heroine 

 in Bollywood?s commercial lingo. I play the kid?s mother 

 and the wife of Vikram Chatwal. My character of Nikasha 

 is this modern Indian girl, a gorgeous, stunning woman who 

 becomes a passionate wife. In the film, we are this yuppie 

 couple on the lines of Madonna-Guy Ritchie and David-Victoria 

 Beckham.

 Also, Nikasha is a very doting 

 mother ? the child is like her best friend. All her dreams 

 are fulfilled through her daughter. She?s a real rock star. 

 A wife, a mother ? there?s a lot of meat in the role. When 

 I get married, I would like to be like this woman ? well 

 balanced, not lopsided. 

 How did the script-reading 

 session with Bachchan go?

 I have given a screen-test to 

 British director Malcolm Macdowell for Exits and Entrances. 

 I have had Carnatic music sessions with Shabana Azmi for 

 Morning Raga. But I have never felt so anxious like 

 I did before the script-reading session two days back. Apu 

 had as many as 10 to 15 actors reading the script together. 

 And all of us were sitting in close proximity to India?s 

 biggest star. He is so modest and charming that he made 

 the atmosphere very relaxed for everyone.

 You know you have seen his movies, 

 you have heard the voice but to actually be with him in 

 the same space is a different experience altogether. The 

 shaking of the hands, the small kiss on the hand ? these 

 small little things patao-ed me instantly. I was 

 floored ? he is such a gentleman. And I am so fortunate 

 that almost all my scenes in Ek Ajnabee are with 

 him.

 How do you feel about Dia Mirza, 

 not you, being the first choice for the role?

 I was told by the makers that 

 she was in the film earlier and that she couldn?t do it 

 for some reason. I am not a person who?s going to ask who, 

 when and why. They have also been very dignified about it. 

 They didn?t divulge details. Yes, it?s sad that she couldn?t 

 do the film.

 Amitabh Bachchan?s 

 new look in Ek Ajnabee

 You are also shooting with 

 Kay Kay Menon for Shadab Khan?s Highway 203?

 Yes, and let me tell you Kay Kay 

 is absolutely divine. I almost died when I saw him in Paanch. 

 Here, he plays this psychotic writer and I a wannabe actress 

 Madhu Kalpade. I have to spend a day with him in the same 

 room to find out whether he has killed his wife.

 What?s next?

 Highway 203 is almost over. 

 I leave for Bangkok by the end of this month for a 30-day 

 start-to-finish schedule of Ek Ajnabee. Once I am 

 back, I will shoot for a romantic comedy named Moonlight 

 with Shekhar Suman.

 What?s the status with Exits 

 and Entrances?

 It is being sold at the film market 

 in Cannes. The post-production is taking a lot of time with 

 a lot of special effects being added to the film. The makers 

 tell me it should release in August or September and yes, 

 it should also come to India.

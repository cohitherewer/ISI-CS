 Fusion at The Golden Park is going the live music way. Good Vibes, a four-member Filipino band, has been signed up to play at the resto-bar.

 While rock and hip-hop are their forte, 70s and 80s melodies can also be expected from the outfit that has worked the circuit in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.

 ?We have gathered a lot of experience by playing in different parts of the world. And that shows. The people of Calcutta can expect a firebrand performance from us every evening,? promises Albert Manzano of Good Vibes.

 The band is meant to add variety to the music mix at the club. ?The crowd is not in the mood to dance to DJ music all the time. But the music has to go on, which is where a live band fits in,? explains B.S. Gujral, managing director of The Golden Park.

A glass partition has also been put up between the 

dance floor and the dining area to provide privacy and variety. ?Some prefer to 

enjoy their food in a peaceful environment, the partition helps keep out the din 

of the dance area,? adds Gujral.

 Power controls

 Planning a romantic evening? Now you can set the 

mood without even leaving your seat. Anchor Electricals has launched the Woods 

light control and home automated system, with which users can dim or turn up the 

lights with a touch of the remote control.

 ?We have launched a short-range device to start off with, which only controls the lights in the house,? explained Dinesh Agarwal, country head, Woods. The remote works up to a distance of 25 m. If the remote concept clicks, the company has plans to extend it to other functions as well.

 The product, already available in Delhi and Mumbai, will be available in Calcutta shortly. Depending on the device?s power ? six, eight or 10 channels ? the gadget will set you back by between Rs 40,000 and Rs 70,000.

Anchor has also launched a variety of technology-driven 

switches in sleek designs and vibrant colours. ?Gone are the days of wooden boxes 

and plastic switches. Electrical fittings on the walls now complete the lifestyle 

experience,? feels Agarwal.

 Ethnic rage 

While Indo-western is the fare dished out by every 

designer trying to cash in on the ready-to-wear rage, here?s a debut with a difference. 

Saris are what young designer Madhuri Agarwal has dared to dabble with.

 Retailing from Sana, her one-year-old boutique at 7B Palm Avenue, Madhuri started off designing accessories including shoes, bags and scarves around three months ago. Finally, the designer is ready with a line of exclusive saris. The range includes casual cottons, organza and various blends of jute, as well as dressier options in georgette, crepe and tussar.

 Block prints and threadwork adorn the lighter saris. The simple saris are accompanied by fancy textured blouses, often with net and appliqu? work. The heavier ones are embellished with zardosi, brocade borders, kantha stitch, sequins, embroidery and block prints. The palette is vibrant ? yellow, purple, olive, orange, fuschia and wine.

 ?My collection comprises around 40 saris. I don?t want to churn out run-of-the-mill work and hence am concentrating on each piece to retain the exclusivity,? explains the debutante. The range comes between Rs 1,050 and soars to Rs 10,000.

 The accessories on the rack exude as much shine and shimmer as the garments. The footwear ?strappy slippers mostly ? in coloured leather, are embellished with stones and beads aplenty. These range between Rs 395 and Rs 595, while the scarves start from Rs 350. 

Trendy totes, both the party and casual college kind, 

are priced between Rs 300 and Rs 900.

Trend twist

In the heart of Jodhpur Park lies Suchorita?s, an 

exclusive boutique for women?s ensembles, catering mainly to the fusion buyer. 

?My clientele is extensive and is not restricted to any particular segment,? says 

designer Suchorita Gooptu. Be it kantha saris, salwar suits or simply 

a comfy pair of drawstring trousers, she has something for everyone, and that 

too, at an affordable price.

 ?I started the outlet 15 years ago, feeling the need for a place where women could purchase chic styles and not pay the earth for them,? she adds. 

 Her idea has clicked. Though many of her clients are based abroad, and others around the country, city celebrities like Aparna Sen, and Victor Banerjee?s wife Maya and daughters Diya and Keya are amongst those who have kept Gooptu busy.

 The latest trends merge with the timeless appeal of traditional crafts to create the designer?s signature style.

 Using crepe, georgette, chiffon, cotton and silk, she has a strong eye for detailing, evident in her block prints and appliqu? work. On the price front, her casuals are marked between Rs 400 and Rs 950, while her saris go up to Rs 5,000. Located at 292B Jodhpur Park, the boutique is open between 4.30 pm and 7.30 pm.

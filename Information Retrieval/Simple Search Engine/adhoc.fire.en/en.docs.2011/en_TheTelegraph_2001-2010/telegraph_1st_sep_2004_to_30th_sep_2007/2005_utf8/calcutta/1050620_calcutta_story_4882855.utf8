The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The flyover that connects Chiria More and Chitpur bridge hasn?t been cleaned 

for a long time. It has become an eyesore with bricks, empty bottles and other 

garbage strewn around in some places. The local administration should remove the 

garbage and urge the area?s residents to abstain from disposing of their garbage 

on/along the flyover.

 Roughly 100 m to the south of Bidhannagar railway station, near the headquarters 

of the Calcutta Armed Police?s 5th battalion, a waterbody is being gradually encroached 

upon. Some shops and toilets have been erected on stilts on the shallow tank bed 

along the edges. Till a decade ago, the waterbody was clean and beautiful and 

was used by local residents. Can the authorities evict the encroachers and restore 

it to its past glory?

 Ganesh Talkies is one of the busiest commercial areas in the city. But thanks 

to the neglect by Calcutta Municipal Corporation, small accidents have become 

a regular feature in this area. Reason: there are too many potholes on the roads. 

Even trams get derailed frequently here. Immediate steps are necessary to repair 

the roads. 

 Saurik Ginoria,

Ganesh Talkies.

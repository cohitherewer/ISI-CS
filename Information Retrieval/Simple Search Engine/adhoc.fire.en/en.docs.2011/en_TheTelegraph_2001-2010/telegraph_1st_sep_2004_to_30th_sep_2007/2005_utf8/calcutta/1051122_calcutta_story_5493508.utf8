The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Attachment over house-tax dues

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 ?Pay up or go dry? and ?pay up or lose the property? will be the twin slogans of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), as it heads into yet another drive to realise outstanding property tax. 

 The primary targets this time are 26 properties with tax arrears more than Rs 30 crore.

 The proposal to disconnect water supply to 17 of the properties, followed by attachment of the rest was ratified by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Friday.

 The hitlist includes a market housing 280 shops, on Old China Bazar Street, in the Burrabazar area, and two other properties whose owners have ignored the directives of the Supreme Court and a division bench of Calcutta High Court. 

 The municipal commissioner has directed his deputy (revenue) to carry out the disconnection and attachment.

 The water supply department will start disconnecting supply from Thursday. A 72-hour notice was served on the properties on Monday.

 The CMC is going in for attachment of properties after a gap of 18 months. The last attachment notice was put up on Strand Properties, on 16, Strand Road. The owner of the building subsequently coughed up the Rs 9.7-crore property tax dues. This time, too, the owners can avoid attachment by paying the outstanding sum within the notice period. 

 Water supply will be cut under Section 275(a) (a) of the CMC Act, 1980, and properties will be attached under Section 221A of the same act.

 The mayor said government offices, large institutions and sensitive properties have been deliberately excluded from the list of defaulters. 

 The tax due from the 17 premises whose water supply might be disconnected ranges between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 1.45 crore.

 The outstanding property tax of the owners of the nine premises on the attachment list ranges from Rs 48 lakh to Rs 5.5 crore.

 The complete list of non-residential defaulters prepared by the water supply department includes 700 properties. 

 Baranagar Municipality tops the chart, with an outstanding amount of Rs 8.22 lakh, followed by the Food Corporation of India office (Rs 5.23 lakh), Customs House (Rs 7.84 lakh), Eden Gardens (Rs 5.21 lakh) and BR Singh Hospital (Rs 5.06 lakh).

 Other prominent institutions making it to the list include the Barrackpore Cantonment, Indian Bank, United Industrial Bank, Central Bank of India, Agri-Horticultural Society of India, Girish Mancha, Gyan Bharati School, the Burrabazar station of Circular Railway, Metro Railway, Calcutta Stock Exchange and, Cricket Association of Bengal.

 ?All the defaulters will eventually have to cough up their dues with interest and penalty,? asserted mayor Bhattacharya on Friday.

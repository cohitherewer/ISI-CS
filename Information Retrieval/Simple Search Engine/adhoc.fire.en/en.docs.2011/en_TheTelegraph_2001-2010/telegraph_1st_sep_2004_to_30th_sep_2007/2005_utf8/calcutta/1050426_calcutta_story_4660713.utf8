The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fatal assault after tease row

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 35-year-old man, allegedly attacked by a local goon for speaking up against eve-teasing, succumbed to his injuries at National Medical College and Hospital early on Monday. 

 Police have arrested Ayub Bairagi, the accused, following complaints from the family members of the victim.

 Around 10 pm on Saturday, Soumen Das had gone to watch a day-and-night cricket match organised by Dinesh Nagar Yuba Sangha Club in Dinesh Nagar.

 Das?s neighbours in Regent Park, in south Calcutta, said he had protested when local boy Ayub had made indecent gestures at some of the women watching the match.

 After a heated exchange of words, a scuffle broke out between the two. Das calmed down and went home when other spectators intervened.

 ?Sometime after midnight, we heard a knock on the door. As soon my husband opened the door, Ayub hit him on his head with a heavy stick. As soon as he slumped to the ground, Ayub hit him in the face with a brick,? said wife Seema, who claimed having seen Ayub fleeing the spot.

 Hearing Seema scream, other family members woke up. They then took the critically-injured man to MR Bangur Hospital. 

 He was then shifted to National Medical College and Hospital as his condition deteriorated.

 While Das was being rushed to the hospital, an angry mob ransacked Ayub?s house, close to the Das residence.

 Nabin Mondal, a septuagenarian of the locality, said Ayub had earlier attacked and seriously injured another local resident. ?He has links with local goons,? he added.

 On Monday evening, superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas S.N. Gupta said: ?We have arrested Ayub on the charge of murdering Das. We are trying to find out whether any other person was with him at the time of the attack.?

 Das was the only earning member of his family. ?I have two minor children. My husband lost his life for protesting a criminal act. The administration should take appropriate steps,? Seema wept.

 How about a drive down the city amid greenery, with birds chirping on branches? Or a walk down rows of palash on the rain-drenched Maidan? 

 If this sounds like a daydream in the concrete jungle, wake up to the reality of future.

 Keen to welcome birds and bees to the city and throw a green sieve over it, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the forest, traffic and other departments have joined hands to plant 15,000-20,000 trees across the city, at a cost of lakhs.

 While the thrust is on the evergreen varieties, the forest department has also decided to plant certain species that are rare in the city. 

 And the list is impressive ? mahogany, mahua, neem and palash, to name a few. 

 The green drive is for both the city and New Town.

 Sources said CMDA has finalised a blueprint for decking up Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, from Garia to Ultadanga, with some 15,000 trees. 

 The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), in association with the transport department, has chalked up a plan to do up almost every major road in New Town. Some 5,000 saplings will be planted in New Town, at an estimated cost of Rs 20 lakh.

 ?Action Area I in Rajarhat will be covered with evergreen trees like sishu and mahogany,? said a Hidco official. 

 ?While the roads and the lanes will have big trees, like krishnachura and radhachura, the boulevards on certain roads will sparkle with bougainvillea. The entire plan has been finalised and we have approached the forest department for follow-up action,? the official added. 

 Work will start with the 1.5-km road connecting Nicco Park and airport. All saplings will be enclosed in a fence, to be erected by local self-help groups. This is part of the state government?s policy to rope in local youths for development work.

 On the Maidan, the planners have decided to plant some 1,000 saplings, including that of ornamental and fruit-bearing varieties, like amlatosh, jacaranda and kanchan.

 ?We want to plant palash and spathodia in the city proper. We want a riot of colours amid the green,? said Somenath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of the forest department?s urban and recreational forestry.

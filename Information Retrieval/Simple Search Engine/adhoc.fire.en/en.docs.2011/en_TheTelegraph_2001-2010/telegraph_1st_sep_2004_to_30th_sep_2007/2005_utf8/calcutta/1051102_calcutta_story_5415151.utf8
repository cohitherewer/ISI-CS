The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bylane shack to Paris, Milan ramps

A trek down a series of narrow bylanes in Garcha leads 

to a one-room shack: 11/A, Dover Terrace. A bed, a cupboard and a few utensils 

fill up the cramped room that also houses a family of five ? Sharan Mishra?s family.

 The dank and crumbling room is where the 23-year-old model, now recovering from 60 per cent burns in a south Calcutta nursing home, had started out from before reaching the ramps of Paris and Milan.

 The distance from Revival nursing home?s ICU to the Dover Terrace room is not much, but the distance Sharan had covered in the last three years was almost out of a fairytale.

 A fairytale with a cruel twist on October 19, when her upper body was enveloped in flames in the kitchen of a Tollygunge flat where she was staying with husband Umang Tiwary, taking a break from work in Delhi.

 That flat has remained locked since the night ? or afternoon, going by conflicting reports ? of the mishap. But an uneasy quiet has descended on the humble Garcha home this Diwali.

 ?She spent her entire childhood here, till she got married about five years ago to Umang,? mother Vidyavati Mishra told Metro on Tuesday. ?We only came to know of her modelling when her photographs started appearing in the papers. I hope she comes back home soon??

 Sharan had come home that day. On the afternoon 

of October 19, she came carrying sweets for her brothers. Late that night, the 

family was told she had suffered severe burns in an accident.

 ?Didi would visit us every now and then, though for a very brief while. She would often help us out with money and other things,? says brother Amarnath, a second-year college student.

 Suman Mishra, born in UP; moved to Calcutta 

as a child

 As a teenager, was fascinated by the world of glamour in glossies

 Changed her name to Sharan and started modelling in early 2002

 Big break was the Metropolitan Top Model India Hunt in 2003, which took 

her to the Paris ramp

 Showcased Sabyasachi Mukherjees designs at Milan Fashion Week in 

2004

 Was a regular at India Fashion Week and other shows; moved to Delhi in 

January 2004

 Ad campaigns included Satya Paul, D eacute;j agrave; Vu, Citibank and Lipton 

tea

The tide turned for Sharan when she took the plunge 

into modelling against the odds and the opposition from the family. ?I knew I 

wanted to be a model since my teenage days. It was my hobby to browse fashion 

and film magazines and the glossy pictures of models in glamorous clothes always 

attracted me,? Sharan had said after winning the Metropolitan Top Model India 

Hunt in 2003. 

 That was her defining moment. The title took her to Paris in early 2004, and within months, she was at the Milan Fashion Week, sashaying in Sabyasachi Mukherjee?s designs.

 Sharan?s first national break had come when she did the portfolio shoot for designer duo Monapali?s India Fashion Week 2003 collection. ?She was a fresher, but the pictures were stunning. They were highly appreciated,? remembers Mona Lamba.

 Sharan?s edge over most Calcutta models was her skinny international figure and her unconventional face. The cropped-hair makeover prescribed by Sabyasachi before the Metropolitan crown, completed her international look.

 She entered India Fashion Week through the new models? auditions in 2003 and has been a regular at the country?s biggest fashion event since. She shifted base to Delhi in January 2004 and walked the ramp at top-rung events.

 But those moments of fashion and fame have gone up in flames, leaving a trail of unanswered questions ? when did the accident actually happen; how did the fire break out; what ?tiff? had she had with husband Umang; why did she want to quit modelling? More importantly, it?s left a young model who had braved it all to pursue her dreams fighting the toughest battle of her life.

 ?With such severe burns, many others would have found it hard to survive. She has fought back with a lot of grit. Now, she is recovering and we might discharge her in another 15 days,? S. Bishnu, resident medical officer of Revival nursing home, told Metro.

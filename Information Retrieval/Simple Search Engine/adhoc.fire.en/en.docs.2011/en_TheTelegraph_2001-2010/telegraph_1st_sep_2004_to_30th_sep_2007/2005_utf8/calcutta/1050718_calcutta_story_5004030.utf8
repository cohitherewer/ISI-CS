The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Waves old and new

 Over 120 films from about 30 countries. When Sourav Dey, a Calcutta boy studying film direction in FTII, Pune, boards the train to Delhi, this is the deluge that awaits him at Osian?s-Cinefan 2005. He is among the young film-makers chosen to attend the biggest Asian film festival hosted in this part of the world that will continue till July 24. ?We had to submit one-minute clips of our work.? Sourav?s passport to workshops with the likes of Shyam Benegal, Mani Kaul and Farrukh Dhondy, was an excerpt from his year-end project Arpan and the Strange Man. 

 Talent Campus India, the programme which chose him, is just one facet of Osian?s-Cinefan, into its seventh edition this year. ?In this world swamped by Bollywood and Hollywood, we wanted a space for the best of Asian cinema,? festival director Aruna Vasudev told Metro. ?Wonderful films are being made in our neighbouring countries which rarely get shown. Our mission is to show these films.? The festival is an initiative of the new wave movie magazine Cinemaya.

 The festival is also celebrating 50 years of Satyajit Ray?s Pather Panchali. Five restored prints of his films will be shown for the first time. ?It is a big event in the history of Indian cinema. Dilip Basu of the Ray Society, who is responsible for getting the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences to restore Ray films, is bringing Pather Panchali and Seemabaddha from Los Angeles. The Bansals, producers of the films, have arranged for the screening of three other works ? Mahanagar, Charulata and Sonar Kella.? 

 Another tribute will be to Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien, who is coming to the festival with four films, including the Golden Lion-winning A City of Sadness. Donald Richie, film critic specialising on Japan, will get a lifetime achievement award.

 While the festival opened with Wang Xiaoshuai?s Shanghai Dreams, the closing film will be Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Kaalpurush. Dasgupta?s National Award-winning Swapner Din will also be screened in the Special Screening section. Other directors whose works will feature in the section are Iranian New Wave cinema icon Dariush Mehrjul, Korea?s Im Kwon-Taek and Alif Yilmaz of Turkey-Greece.

 The festival has an Asian and an Indian section. A competitive section has been added this year, pitting veterans like Kundan Shah (Teen Behnein), Jayaraj (Daivanamalhari) and Sandip Ray (Nishijapon) against newcomers like Kamal Sadanah (Karkash), Kaushik Ganguly (Shunyo E Bukey) and Shoojit Sircar (Yahaan).

 With the French embassy supporting Osian?s-Cinefan, an Asian package has been put together of films funded by Fonds Sud, France?s best-known film-funding organisation that co-produced films like Adoor Gopalakrishnan?s Shadow Kill and Sudhir Mishra?s Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi. A dozen delegates, including film critics of Le Figaro and Positif and representatives of Cannes Film Festival, will also attend.

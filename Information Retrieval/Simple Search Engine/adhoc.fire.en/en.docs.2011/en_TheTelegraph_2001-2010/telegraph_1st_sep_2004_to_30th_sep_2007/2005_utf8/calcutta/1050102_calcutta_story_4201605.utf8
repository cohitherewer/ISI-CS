 Sunderbans

 First up, all you travellers, 

 accept our apologies for starting the year on a sombre note. 

 But having experienced ? or rather suffered ? the Sunderbans 

 in the last week of 2004, it only seemed apt to focus on 

 the delta of disappointment that epitomises the gulf between 

 what tourism in Bengal can be and what it really is. 

 A band of tourists on the tiger trail is waiting to board MV Madhukar at Sonakhali in South 24-Parganas for a two-day-one-night trip to the Sunderbans. Forty-five minutes after the noon boarding time, the boat is spied at a distance. As it approaches the jetty, the gang gears up. But wait, MV Madhukar has a mind of its own. It refuses to come to the jetty and drifts further north. The tourists and the tour coordinators are left high and dry for a full two hours.

 The old adage of morning showing the day turned out to be 100 per cent true on the 36-hour tour to the Sunderbans. No prizes for guessing the agency that stitched together the trip ? the West Bengal tourism department. 

 Before elaborating on the gaffes that made it a horror holiday, let?s get down to some basics: the price for the package, Rs 1,700 (plus 4 per cent tax); the promise, a bus ride from BBD Bag to Sonakhali, starting point for the launch-ride to Sajnekhali, Sudhanyokhali and Duibanki, the three spots boasting tiger watchtowers. The package also included food on board and a night?s stay at the forest department?s lodge in Sajnekhali. 

 Now, back to the sorry tale of government-promoted tourism trouble. As we were boarding the launch, another set of tourists, visibly disgruntled and exhausted, disembarked. 

 ?They didn?t take us to all the points and so we had to protest. We had said that we would not leave the launch if they don?t show us around,? hollered a middle-aged woman explaining why our launch had done the disappearing act.

 The same thing happened with us. As we set off late, we reached Sudhanyokhali at 5.15 pm. By then, the forest department?s park had slammed its doors. ?I requested the officer to let us in for just 10 minutes, but he didn?t give us permission,? mumbled the tour coordinator. 

 The only option was heading ?home?, to the forest department lodge in Sajnekhali. A wood house with small, dingy and smelly rooms, comfort here is rarer than spotting a tiger. ?We are here in search of adventure, you can?t crib about the lack of comfort,? pointed out a friend, desperate to make something out of nothing at all.

 Next morning, we first went to Sudhanyokhali and then drifted down to Duibanki. Since the clock was prime competition, the trips to the tiger watchtowers went something like this: disembark, rush up, rush down and leave with a few Kodak moments with monkeys and deer, if you please. 

 The cruise on Matla and other tributaries was the high point, with attempts to trace pug marks our sole tribute to tiger-trail adventure. If missing all 268 big cats said to be prowling the delta was a disappointment, the worst was yet to come. 

 On our return to Sonakhali at around 6 pm (the scheduled arrival time was 3 pm), we learnt that the bus had left by then. ?I don?t know why the driver didn?t wait,? muttered the tour coordinator, as clueless as we were. 

 Finally, a rickety bus was arranged 

 and a part of the team was packed into two Tata Sumos. Schumacher 

 at the wheel on the roads of South 24-Parganas provided 

 more of an adrenaline high than the tiger trail. 

 SURVIVAL 

 KIT

 Plenty of patience

 A yen for disappointment

 Camera for monkeys 

 and deer

 Mosquito repellent 

 and torch to spend the night sitting outside stuffy, 

 stinking rooms

 How to get there

 Since it?s a conducted tour, you 

 have to catch the bus from BBD Bag, which takes you to Sonakhali 

 in three hours. Then, onto the boat

 What to expect

 Nothing going according to plan

 Where to stay 

 The forest department lodge at 

 Sajnekhali, or spend the night on the boat. You don?t really 

 have much choice in the matter

 What to expect

 Rooms that you can?t live in, 

 lights out after 11 pm, mosquitoes on a commando mission, 

 food orders that take a day to be delivered...Need we dissuade 

 you more?

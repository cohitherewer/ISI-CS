 After two months of agitation, academic activity is set to resume at Jadavpur University (JU).

 The settlement to resolve the impasse, reached on Wednesday between the five-member teacher team and the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu), was ratified on Monday by the JU executive council, the university?s highest policy-making body.

 Normal activities are expected to start from Tuesday, when students will go back to class. Some students had been boycotting classes and semester examinations since April. 

 University officials said the semester exams will be rescheduled shortly.

 While the Fetsu members in their resolution had expressed ?sincere regret? over the 2003 incident in which senior teachers were manhandled by a mob of students, the negotiators agreed to withdraw the suspension of five students.

 The committee ? formed on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s insistence to find a way to end the deadlock ? had forwarded the resolutions to the executive council for approval.

 ?We have withdrawn the suspension of the five students on three factors. The students have expressed regret for their act in 2003. They have promised to help us bring back a normal academic atmosphere on campus and they have also agreed that this kind of movement will never take place in the university in future,? said a senior teacher and member of the executive council.

 Jubilant students also took out processions and burst crackers on the campus. ?This is great victory for us,? said Amit Chakraborty, Fetsu general secretary. ?The suspended students are now free to enter the campus and participate in all academic activities.?

 The state committee of the SFI, the CPM?s student wing, also welcomed the JU authorities? decision to withdraw the student suspension.

 The Fetsu members, however, said they will continue to organise token protests till the authorities gave a statement about the June 10 police eviction of a group of fasting students.

 During the meeting last week with the negotiators, the union had demanded a statement from vice-chancellor Ashok Nath Basu about why police were called in.

 The executive council has formed an inquiry committee. The vice-chancellor will issue a statement once he receives the probe team?s report.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Girl fights captors, flees brothel

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 It was a dream trip for 15-year-old Kanak (name changed) ? her first to Calcutta, and that too, to take up a job. However, it quickly turned into a nightmare after she realised she was about to be sold to the owner of a brothel in the largest red-light district of the city.

 The teenager did not resign herself to her fate, though. After being locked in a room and tortured for two days, she fought her captors and managed to flee on Thursday. She sought help from passers-by as she ran down the bylanes of Sonagachhi to safety.

 Shocked by her story, the residents of the area took her to the office of a social welfare organisation. A general diary was lodged with Jorabagan police station.

 According to police, a girl-trafficking racket could be behind the incident.

 ?Members of an NGO came to us with the girl, who is now at the home, Sanlaap. A general diary has been lodged,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (north).

 Kanak is a resident of Bharatpur village, under Kandi police station, in Murshidabad. An unidentified man lured her to the city on Tuesday by promising her a job. He was an acquaintance of Kanak?s father, Pulak Das.

 After the two reached Calcutta, another man joined them. The three went to a house on BK Pal Avenue, where Kanak was asked to wait till she was interviewed for the job. She was soon overpowered by four men and locked in a room. For the next 48 hours, she was beaten and tortured regularly, and wasn?t given any food.

 On Thursday, unable to take it any more, Kanak decided to make an attempt to escape. She called one of her captors from the bathroom. When he walked in, she smashed a flower vase on his head and made a dash for the door.

 Running through the maze of narrow lanes in Sonagachhi, she reached BK Pal Avenue. Since she was not familiar with the city, she wandered on the streets for hours before she could muster courage to approach some local residents for help.

 Her ordeal moved some youths, who took her to the office of the medical bank of a social welfare organisation. 

 ?The girl was in a bad state when she was brought to us. She was bleeding, exhausted and weak. We gave her food and water. She later narrated her plight to us. We then took her to the office of Sanlaap. She was almost sold into prostitution. Such rackets are flourishing around the red-light area,? stated D. Ashis of the NGO.

 Tapati Bhowmik of Sanlaap said: ?Kanak has only narrated her experiences, after which we took her to the police. She is too traumatised to talk about anything else. We have provided her with shelter and will present her to the state child welfare committee shortly. We are trying to locate her family members.?

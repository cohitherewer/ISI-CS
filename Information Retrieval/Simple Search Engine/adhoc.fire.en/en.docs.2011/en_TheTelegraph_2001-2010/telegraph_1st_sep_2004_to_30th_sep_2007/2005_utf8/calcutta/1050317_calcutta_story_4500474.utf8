 Twenty-five years on, it is a statement that would weave in the roots with the current offshoots. And North American Bengali Conference (NABC) has chosen to make it in fashion.

 When the distant shores of New York wake up to all things Bengali this July, thanks to the silver jubilee edition of what has grown to be perhaps the biggest annual congregation of Bengalis in the US, a display of Bengal?s fashion heritage will be the new addition to the schedule that celebrates all aspects of Bengal?s culture ? music and dance to literature and art to theatre and films.

 Hosted by the New York-based Cultural Association of Bengal, the conference will be held between July 1 and 3.

 Said Dhriti Bagchi, chairperson of the Bhasa and Lok Sanskriti committee of NABC: ?This is the first time we will showcase Bengal?s traditional fashion heritage to mainstream Americans. The dying art forms of Bengal will be highlighted through fashion shows with taant and kantha works. There will also be a display of how these crafts are used in contemporary clothing.?

 Three fashion shows spread over the three days will showcase kantha creations by revivalist-designer Shamlu Dudeja, taant saris by Dalia Sarees and contemporary ethnic clothes by designer Sudipa Chakraborty of Scorpion boutique.

 ?The shows will see professional New York models as well as common people, aged between six and 50, walking the ramp,? said choreographer Sukalyan Bhattacharya, who, along with Bagchi, was in town for talks with the participants from Bengal.

 The showing of Dudeja?s kantha creations will be divided in five segments celebrating different Bengali social dos. The first sequence, Annaprashan, will feature a collection for kids with kantha quilts as backdrop. The show will then move on to highlight kantha-stitched clothes for the college-going crowd, a cocktail party, a wedding and culminate in the 50th anniversary celebrations of a Bengali couple.

 The taant show by Dalia Sarees will be accompanied by folk songs and dance. The Scorpion collection will be unveiled to the beats of Indian classic, semi-classical and contemporary music. ?We will get folk artistes from Bengal, including Chhau dancers and baul singers, and dhakis from Bangladesh, to perform at the event,? added Bagchi.

 The extravaganza is expected to attract ?tens of thousands? from all over the world. ?The audience will include local fashion designers, models and museum people from New York,? said Bagchi, adding that the designers will put up sales counters at the venue.

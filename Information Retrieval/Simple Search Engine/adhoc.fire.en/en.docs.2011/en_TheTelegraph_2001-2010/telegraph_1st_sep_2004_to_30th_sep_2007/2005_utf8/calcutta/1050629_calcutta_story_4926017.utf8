 3 booked for rape of teen

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Howrah police are on the lookout for three persons on charges of abduction and rape of a teenager.

 According to the complaint lodged with police, the 15-year-old girl was abducted with the help of a distant relative, Lal Sheikh, 30, and was repeatedly raped by Rinku Khan, 22, and Nasir Khan, 20.

 The three are wanted on charges of rape and kidnapping with a common intention. ?They are absconding. An investigation has been launched,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintendent of police (headquarters).

 Mohammad Galib, the victim?s lawyer, alleged that Rinku and Nasir are relatives of two influential CPM leaders in Howrah and police were being forced by partymen not to take action against the accused.

 ?Many criminals are claiming to be our party workers. Let alone giving shelter to them, we will instead put pressure on Howrah police to reveal the truth as soon as possible,? said Sridip Bhattacharya, CPM secretary, Howrah.

 The victim alleged that on June 22, her distant brother-in-law, Lal Sheikh, went to her Chakraberia residence, under Shibpur police station, and offered her a ride on his motorcycle. She agreed and they set off around 7.30 pm.

 Lal allegedly took her to Mandirtala, in Shibpur, and handed her over to Nasir and Rinku, along with the motorcycle. The three travelled to various places in Shibpur till 10.30 pm. When the two men didn?t show any sign of taking her back home, the girl tried to raise an alarm, but Rinku allegedly gagged her with his handkerchief.

 The duo took her to a marshy plot in Unsani, under Jagaccha police station, and raped her repeatedly through the night. ?The medical report clearly shows that she had been raped,? confirmed additional superintendent Banerjee. The next morning, they dropped her off at Benapol, a 15-minute walk from her house.

 An FIR was lodged with the police on June 25. ?By then, the accused had gone into hiding,? a police officer said.

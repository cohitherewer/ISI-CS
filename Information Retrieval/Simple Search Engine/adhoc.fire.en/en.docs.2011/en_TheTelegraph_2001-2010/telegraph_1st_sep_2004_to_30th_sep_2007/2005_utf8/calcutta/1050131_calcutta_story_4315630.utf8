 Suit slap for varsity posts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 K.C. Das, former head of the mathematics department of Jadavpur University (JU), who quit the post on January 14, has moved a public interest litigation in Calcutta High Court opposing the recruitment of some lecturers in the department. The court is likely to hear the case next week.

 Das was part of a committee responsible for selecting a panel of eight candidates for five posts of lecturer. 

 Four of the eight committee members had put a candidate on top of the panel, who, according to three other members, including Das, is less qualified than the others. 

 The former head of the department had opposed the panel prepared by the selection committee and submitted a separate panel to the executive council, JU?s highest decision-making body. 

 The authorities, however, accepted the panel prepared by the committee. Das had resigned to protest the decision.

 In his resignation, submitted to vice-chancellor A.N. Basu, Das wrote: ?As a mathematician, I have no doubt that the selections have been unfair, miserably sub-standard and hopelessly unsuitable for a university with five-star status. My hopes that the executive council will see the wisdom of the head of the department in selecting the best candidates for the department have been belied.?

 Petitioner?s counsel Arunava Ghosh alleged: ?While selecting the candidates, the JU authorities did not follow recruitment rules.? 

 He added that Das has demanded a thorough probe into the recruitment process by an impartial agency. 

 The case has created a stir in the city?s academic circles. Some senior lecturers of the department are reportedly supporting Das? stand.

 According to sources, the case will be heard by a division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi.

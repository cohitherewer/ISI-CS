 City Lights

 Sip amp; stage, all stirred up

 A sumptuous supper could make you feel too sleepy for some heavy-duty theatre, but not a light sip and bite. Cocktail theatre is a more chilled-out experience ? one, where you can enjoy your champagne and the stage act too.

 Last Wednesday, the Park Hotel uncorked the first-of-its-kind evening of cocktail theatre in town, with a spread of candle-lit round tables, fine wine and some Frank Sinatra.

 As the four-member cast took the makeshift stage at one end of the banquet for Raell Padamsee?s Two to Tango, the select clientele of 400, comprising celebrities, consular officials, corporate honchos and bureaucrats, laughed out loud at every twist and turn in the play.

 Introducing this novel concept is an exercise by the Park Street hotel to push up its popularity score in the entertainment sector.

 The hour-long Two to Tango comprised four single acts revolving around man-woman relationships at various stages of life. 

 Dilnaz Irani and Digvijay Savant kicked it off as two college-goers, complete strangers, reacting differently to the same situations. The third had Dilnaz and Digvijay turning into an elderly couple who have almost stopped communicating with each other. Tanaaz Currim and Vinay Jain took the stage for the second and last acts, revealing some discordant notes in marriage and in a relationship out of wedlock. 

 ?We let the guests chill with cocktails and then present them a nice, short and crisp play. It should not be heavy-duty at all,? says Tanaaz, the most accomplished of the four actors. 

 The genre that marries theatre with merriment originated in Mumbai and is fast gaining popularity in Delhi and Bangalore.

 ?Apart from hotels and restaurants, we have also performed cocktail theatre at lounge bars in Mumbai and it has gone down very well with the audience. It provides a much more relaxed ambience,? says Padamsee, the Mumbai-based theatre veteran who began experimenting with the concept a couple of years ago. 

 The productions are usually small in scale, allowing only a few actors at a time on stage with minimal props. The crew plays around with whatever furniture is available at the venues.

 ?But it?s a challenge because each space is different and the crowd is different too,? adds Padamsee, who has taken two of her popular plays, Laughing Wild and Let?s Talk Honey, to cocktail parties. She is now planning to stage Anything But Love, starring Mandira Bedi, at such a setting.

 ?The prerequisite of cocktail theatre is a crisp and entertaining production. It need not necessarily be a comedy. You can do murder mysteries too, but the bottom line is to let the audience have a good evening. So without sounding snobbish I want to say that you don?t need to intellectualise in such a performance,? explains Padamsee.

 If the reactions from the Tanmoy Boses and Renu Roys were anything to go by ? ?what an enjoyable evening!? ? Calcutta won?t take much to warm to cocktail theatre.

 Voice of the people

 Give Bryan Adams a complex, sing like Kishore Kumar used to and croon Asha?s Kambakth ishq like she?s never sung it before? Lending voice to your favourite songs, but with precision that?s close to the original real number has never been so easy, or cheap.

 Rhythm, a global chain of instant audio and video recording that entered the Calcutta market two months ago, is providing a platform for amateur and aspiring singers to record their own CDs for as little as Rs 9 per minute of recording.

 In the past two months of operations at City Centre (Shop F 016), as many as 216 Calcuttans have already recorded their own tracks. The song list ranges from the Mera kuch saamaan from Ijazat to As long as you love me from Backstreet Boys.

 The simple process involves singing on a minus one track (without the main vocals), after which it is edited and special effects added to give that magic touch to transform a bathroom singer into a pro. Incidentally, the software used for the purpose is also known as Magic.

 Rhythm?s Calcutta outlet has a 

 collection of around 1,000 songs from which an aspiring 

 singer can pick tracks of his choice and sing along. ?Calcuttans 

 are using this service for all purposes, from proposing 

 love to sending recorded CDs for talent-hunt contests and 

 to music directors,? says Vishwadeep Bhowmick at the store. 

 Average time taken for recording one song is approximately 

 20 minutes, including editing and correction. ?Calcuttans 

 have fantastic voices and the people who?ve recorded with 

 us till today either have good voices or very good voices,? 

 shares Bhowmick.

 With the ?fun adventure? feel 

 to the recording experience catching on, Valentine?s Day 

 was a big draw. That apart, the daily inflow of wannabe 

 singers or curious passersby means the Rhythm?s just right.

 Life beyond the ramp: 

 Supermom Nayanika 

 A high-flying model and a grooming 

 expert is Nayanika Chatterjee. But babysitting two-year-old 

 Nayantara is what she revels in the most. ?The minute I 

 feel I am neglecting my daughter, I will quit working,? 

 says Nayanika, in town for the Seagram?s Blenders Pride 

 Fashion Tour. After 16 long years on the ramp, the proud 

 mother plans to stick around for a few summers more. Here?s 

 a toast to her spirit!

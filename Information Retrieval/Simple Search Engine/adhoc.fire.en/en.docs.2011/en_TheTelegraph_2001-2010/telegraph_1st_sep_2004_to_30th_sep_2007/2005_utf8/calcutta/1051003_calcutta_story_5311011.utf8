The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boon amp; bane of IT march in healthcare

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The invasion of information technology (IT) in healthcare is being cautiously welcomed by experts, who are also raising legal questions about the possible misuse of the new techniques.

 A panel of experts, from judicial and medical fields, discussed the issues during a session organised by Peerless Hospital amp; B.K. Roy Research Centre on Saturday.

 State law minister Nisith Adhikary, who attended the panel discussion, hinted that the IT invasion in healthcare required careful monitoring and new laws might be necessary to protect the interests of both patients and doctors.

 ?We are eagerly waiting for experts to voice their views so we have an idea what kind of legal shields are necessary to deal with the misuse of IT in healthcare,? he opined.

 Adhikary said each technological revolution was bringing in its wake new challenges. Regretting commercialisation of healthcare, he said: ?Today, value-based ideas are being replaced by money-based objectivism. Medicine, once a sacred profession, is at times exposing an ugly face of pure business.? 

 According to state human rights commission chairman Shyamal Sen, existing laws are not being able to keep pace with the IT revolution. ?This is a complicated matter. A mass awareness is required. Everybody, including the government and media, should work in that direction,? Sen said.

 PricewaterhouseCooper executive director Rajarshi Sengupta, who moderated the discussion, voiced concern over the possible misuse of IT in healthcare. ?The dangers of misuse are always there, looming large over us. If it falls in wrong hands, information technology can wreak havoc in society.?

 A.K. Gupta, head of the department of forensic and state medicine at Medical College and Hospital, said mishaps caused by medical negligence were deplorable. 

 ?With IT putting healthcare on the information superhighway, utmost care needs to be taken to ensure that information is accessed by the right person for the right purpose.?

 However, all speakers admitted that the IT invasion in healthcare cannot be stopped and should not be stopped.

 A.K. Sanyal, managing director of Peerless Hospital, told Metro that the hospital was planning to introduce an information management system to digitally preserve patients? disease history.

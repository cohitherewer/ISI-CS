 Glimpses of the soon to-be-opened lounge and Italian restaurant Little Italy on Camac Street 

 Calcuttas cup and plate brimmeth over, and another Mumbai brand name is coming to town to make the most of the citys seemingly insatiable appetite.

 Little Italy, slated for an end-July opening, is bringing its first restaurant and nightclub to the eighth floor of Fort Knox, the jewellery mall coming up on Camac Street.

 Start the evening with authentic vegetarian Italian and Mexican cuisine, and move on to the party zone as the morning draws near.

 Little Italy is owned by a Gujarati family in Mumbai and has been around for more than 15 years now, says Amit Kajaria, franchisee for Little Italy in Calcutta.

 The chain, which has two outlets in Andheri and Juhu, has been offering the franchise option for the past three years. Now there are more than eight outlets in the country, including Bangalore, Pune and Goa. Hyderabad is to be the next destination.

 Camac Street is fast becoming a hub of activity. We chose a mall for this purpose because it ensures high visibility and swelling footfalls, adds Kajaria.

 The citys dearth of sophisticated standalone vegetarian options was one of the motivations for bringing Little Italy to town. There are a considerable number of people in the city who are vegetarian. Even those who eat non-vegetarian fare relish quality vegetarian food from time to time, he feels.

 Italian d?cor will add to the ambience, designed to ensure privacy for guests, and keep the chaos away from rush hour.

 The seating arrangement has been limited to 70 covers only, though the 5,500-sq-ft space could have accommodated more.

 Instead, the tables are placed at a comfortable distance from each other to leave enough elbow space, according to Vivek Rathod of Salient (Studio for Architecture, Landscapes, Interiors and Enterprise), behind the interiors of the Camac Street eatery.

 Water elements add a soothing touch as well. Aqua baths flanking the white draped sofa seats will be infused with aromatic oils, petals and floating candles.

 Every seat in the dining area has its own advantages. One may choose to sit next to a cascade of water, plasma screen, indoor garden or glass window overlooking Camac Street, smiles Rathod.

 And if your mood steers you towards the nightclub (with its separate entrance to keep the din away from the diners), a destination fit to compete with any in town is what the management promises.

 Lounge music in the early hours of the evening will pick up pace to party tracks as the night progresses.

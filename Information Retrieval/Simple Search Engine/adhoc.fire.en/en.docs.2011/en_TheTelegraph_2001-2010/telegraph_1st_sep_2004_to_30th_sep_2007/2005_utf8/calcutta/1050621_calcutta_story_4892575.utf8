Life

 The aroma of grandmothers kitchen

 Tongue Twister 

 Musician and foodie Nondon Bagchi understood what Robinson Crusoe felt like when he ventured into the world of cooking

 While writing about the culinary scene in Calcutta over the years, I have often met people who, with a sceptical gleam in the eyes, have asked questions like Apni kono din khunti nerechhen? Which translates more or less into Do you cook yourself? I used to evade the question by mumbling something about how some well-known drama critics had also never acted, or how so many music critics had also never been musicians and so forth.

 Inevitably though, the writing and the eating awoke the desire to experiment and one fine day I took khunti in hand. Of course, this was just dabbling. I would choose the simplest of recipes and Geeta, who was the kitchen manager, did all the hard work of chopping, cleaning and preparing all the ingredients. I would then arrive with the air of a master chef and bung things together and walk away feeling very proud of myself. 

 No one else ever got to know the results of these trysts with the kitchen because mother had a hundred and one diet restrictions and none of the recipes was Indian, and Geeta looked down her nose at them with disdain.

 She herself was an excellent cook, especially when it came to Bengali food. Light and subtle of touch, she knew all the wonderful vegetarian delights of this cuisine. Every preparation of every part of the banana tree ? stalk, stem, flower ? all the various spinaches and edible leaves ? palak (of course), pui, methi, kormi, lal, note, paat (to name a few), all the ambals and tauks prepared according to their season and of course all the regular Bengali favourites from Kumror Chhokka, Lau Chingri and Dhokar Dalna to the many different fish, meat and poultry preparations.

 There was no way I was going to have the audacity to prepare Bengali ? or for that matter any Indian food ? in her presence. She had been with a Marwari family and a Punjabi family before joining us and had a repertoire up her sleeve when it came to these cuisines as well. So of course I took the easy way out and tried my luck with a few Chinese and Continental recipes. This was not her area of interest so if I made a hash of things no one would be the wiser.

 But all things must pass and the day came when Geeta was going to leave. She had been with us for 16 years. Mother had passed on; I was travelling a fair bit and the whole question of starting from scratch with a new person was not an inviting thought. So I decided to go it alone. And start from scratch myself.

 On May 1, 2002 when I walked into an uninhabited kitchen I understood what Robinson Crusoe must have felt like. From identifying the spices I would need ? cumin and coriander powder, kalo jeere (black onion seeds), gota jeere (whole cumin seeds), panch phoron (Bengali five spice) and such by sight and smell, I had to do it all like a beginner, which I was. The last time I had peeled potatoes must have been a good 40 years previously, having fun as a young lad helping out in the kitchen.

 The thing was that lunch just had to be a Bengali affair. This had been a lifelong family tradition. Other cuisines might feature at dinner but lunch was always dal, bhaat, tarkari, maach. And so it would have to be. This was a far cry from waving my ladle around after Geeta had set everything up so naturally I nearly burned down the kitchen, nicked, scalded and burnt myself, watched in horror as the rice or dal ballooned up and spilled over in a matter of a few unmindful seconds, made mistakes with the electrical appliances, flooded the kitchen in an attempt to defrost the fridge and engendered numerous disasters, before beginning to get the hang of things.

 And when you do get the hang of things, like knowing by sight and/or smell when something is done to a nicety, you realise you are calling on something almost akin to rare memories, some subconscious picture or aroma you picked up while wandering in and out of grandmothers kitchen as a child.

 And thank god for recipe books. While they do at times contradict each other and possibly no two books have exactly the same instructions for a given item, they are invaluable as they provide a basic platform from which to go about ones business, making adjustments and improvising as one goes along. Following recipes to the letter (especially how many minutes to do this or that) can spell trouble. I have seen a recipe for fried rice which involves powdered as well as whole garam masala, bay leaves and raisins. But it is a free country. It has been an enjoyable learning experience. Thus years after my initiation, I had the temerity to invite some people over. They are still around, reasonably sane and healthy people.

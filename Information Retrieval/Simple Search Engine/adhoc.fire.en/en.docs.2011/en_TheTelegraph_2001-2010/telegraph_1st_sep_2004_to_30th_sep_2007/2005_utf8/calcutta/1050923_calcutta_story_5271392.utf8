 Play platform for positives 

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 They are as dedicated and competent as professional thespians, yet very different. For, Khitis, Lakshmi, Jyotsna and Susanta are HIV-positive.

 They, along with others, have formed the city?s first amateur drama group of HIV positive people, under the aegis of Bengal Network for Positives, a wing of West Bengal State Aids Prevention and Control Society.

 The group?s first play, Banchar Lorai, deals with AIDS, and the virus is one of the protagonists. The aim is to generate awareness and entertain. 

 Apart from holding street shows, the group has performed at Command Hospital and theatres in Chandernagore and Uttarpara.

 ?There are creative individuals among us. The group brings out their talents. Banchar Lorai attempts to inform people about the spread of the disease and its prevention,? said Tarit Chakraborty, president of Bengal Network for Positives.

 He added: ?We also use the platform to protest ostracism of HIV-positive people. We are trying to get professional help to run the group better and are looking forward to performing at prominent theatres in the city.?

 Banchar Lorai has been written and directed by Ajay Naskar, a doctor and the only non-HIV-positive member of the group, which has five other members, two women and three men.

 The rehearsals are held at the house of the actors, as well as the main office of the network, in north Calcutta. The group members double as costume designers.

 ?The play is our voice, through which we share our pain and sorrow with the audience. In the process, people find out more about AIDS,? said Khitis, a member of the group. 

 ?We were called to perform at AIDS Walk, held recently in the state. The play was appreciated. However, we need more opportunities to perform in the city,? he added.

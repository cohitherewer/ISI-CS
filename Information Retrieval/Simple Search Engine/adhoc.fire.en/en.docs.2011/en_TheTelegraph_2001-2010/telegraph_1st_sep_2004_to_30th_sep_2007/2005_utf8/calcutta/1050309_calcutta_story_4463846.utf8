 Tradition tinkle with tiny trinkets

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Next time you have to show someone to the door, do so with a tinkle and a flourish of colour. Or better still, ring a welcome note with a door chime. The hand-made rope of beads and stuffed birds and animals culminating into a tiny brass bell, instantly adds colour and a friendly touch to your house.

 The art originated in Gujarat, but it?s now available all over the country, especially in craft bazars. 

 Colour is the name of the game and strings of beads are alternated with cute little cloth stuffed toys. Tiny elephants, horses, birds and fishes go marching down a straight line merrily clad in bright pinks and greens topped with zari and sequin trimmings. 

 At times, the creatures go on a merry go round to form bati chimes, a circular ensemble with a cane canopy. These look cute in any corner of the house, especially in a children?s bedroom.

In the same fashion you get U-shaped chimes and triangular chimes. These are all available in various shapes and sizes. A shorter version of a door chime becomes a window chime, lending a playful effect to your house. 

 Trying your hand at designing one makes for an interesting pastime, especially for children. Making the chimes yourself makes them a little cheaper as well, which is otherwise a tad expensive. 

 l you need is sturdy thread or rope, colourful beads and gear to make stuffed toys. If making the toys seems too much of a bother, just string in the beads together and make yourself a colourful curtain. Turn on the classic Dum maro dum and have a hippie night at home!

 Ideas and expressions

 An annual attempt by CIMA Gallery to bring to focus the works of contemporary artists that deserve serious examination, Concepts and Ideas 2005 presents art lovers of the city a unique visual offering. Featuring works of Samir Aich, Akhilesh, Amitava Das, Jaya Ganguly, Prabhakar Kolte, Baiju Parthan and Yogesh Rawal, the show also provides an experiential illustration of the essence of Art. The paintings on show help to analyse the critical aspects that identify and designate any creation as a work of art. They try to define and put into perspective the various thoughts, moods and ideas that have inspired creativity. Determined by their core concept rather than by their maker, the paintings attest the truth that idea transcends experience. The concept is vital to a work of art; art itself is simply the vehicle of expression for an idea.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by eminent artists

 When: Till September 7; 2 pm - 7 pm

 Where: CIMA Gallery

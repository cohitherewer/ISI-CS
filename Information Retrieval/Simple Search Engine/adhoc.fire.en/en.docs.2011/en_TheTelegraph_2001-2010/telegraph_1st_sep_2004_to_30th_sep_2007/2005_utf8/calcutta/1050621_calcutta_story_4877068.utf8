The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without

 Booking a Maruti 800

 The Sonatas and Corollas can roll over. Small is beautiful once more, with Maruti 800 prices being slashed further. And if the big SUV bully on the street sniggers at the worlds cheapest car, give him a lesson in civic sense. Smaller car size translates into more road space, less traffic jams and less petrol burnt. This is simple logic any muscle-head should be able to grasp!

 Getting a hands-free for your cell phone

 If you must talk while driving, this is the least you can do. The device has been around for some time, but the Prabir Kumar De tragedy drives home the point that cell phones can indeed be a life-threatening menace. Its best to avoid talkathons while out on the road ? on foot or behind the wheel ? for you to keep your senses alert for signals and traffic. However, if you refuse to give your gadget a rest, wash your hands of it, so they can be put to better use.

 Buying a Japanese fan

 Progress may be the way of the world, but Calcutta is taking a few steps back in time. Though you may have thought the flimsy brown contraptions were far behind you, hath pakhas are back in style. Get your roof or balcony ready for some long addas as the power utilities in town give way and the heat gains ground. If turning back time goes against the grain, discount the d?j? vu by treating yourself to an ornate Japanese-style fan to bid muggy moments sayonara in style!

 Watching Batman Begins

 If you were unfortunate enough to suffer the caped crusaders last two outings, this one should soothe your soul. This reinterpretation of the genesis of Batman is almost as good as Tim Burtons original. Gotham is brilliant in its darkness, Christian Bale snugly fits the new costume (and the role), and the rest of the star cast ? particularly Liam Neeson ? throws in commendable performances. Lots of blazing guns and huge explosions should excite the action-thrill seeker. Just be careful about stepping onto the sinister streets after a night show.

 What they are watching

 Do children find children?s films boring? Do they find adult films and saas-bahu serials more interesting? What is the impact of films on young minds? The concern voiced at an interface organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) with Children?s Film Society (CFS) chairperson Nafisa Ali Sodhi on Saturday morning took an analytical turn.

 The panel of speakers also comprised film-maker Ashok Viswanathan, psychiatrist Reema Mukherjee, CII Eastern region chairman Ravi Poddar and Modern High School for Girls principal Debi Kar, who moderated the session. 

 ?Life is such that when you are married, you have to go away. My family and friends are here and so I am very excited when anybody invites me to Calcutta,? smiled Nafisa, before turning her attention to the responsibilities as CFS chairman.

 ?Children?s films have really dipped in India. There are around 800 films being made in India every year; how many of these are children?s films? This year, we had only Iqbal and Hanuman,? mused Nafisa, who is planning to launch a national-level digital film festival from next year. ?A digital film can be completed on a budget of anything between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, and even schools can make them,? she reasoned.

 Viswanathan, who felt present-day children?s films lacked the ?magic and Quixotic quality? of a Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, offered some pragmatic steps towards improving the CFS. ?The procedure of selection of films by the Society should be more transparent,? he said, before urging Nafisa to be directly involved in the selection process, as ?the chairperson usually remains a figurehead and bureaucratic red-tapism takes the upper hand?.

 Psychiatrist Mukherjee, who often counsels children troubled by too much exposure to the screen, felt there weren?t many Indian films with which children could relate to. 

 ?Teenagers are going through a period of confusion. They don?t have very many movies that deal with their problems. The western films they see on TV are very different from the set-ups they are in, which ultimately leads to the problem of fitting into their existing set-up,? she explained, adding that parents should monitor what their kids are watching.

 After the adults had dissected their film-watching habits, school students in the audience voiced their views. ?I am hooked on horror films because I get a thrill out of them even though I am scared for two nights afterwards,? confessed one, while another felt that all films were not detrimental. ?A movie like Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander sends the positive message that you need to work hard in order to achieve something,? she added.

 CII chairman Poddar promised to guide Nafisa to financial institutions willing to pump money into projects involving children.

 A leap, beyond barriers

 Star turn: Kunal Ganjawala and (above) Vasundhara Das

 From Nothing Beyond (Nihil Ultra) to Beyond Barriers, it?s that time of the year when you raise a toast to the true spirit of Xaverians. And like every year, 2005 will see the three-day college festival, Xavotsav, culminating in the grand musical extravaganza titled Beyond Barriers.

 But this time, there?s a cause. All the ?surplus proceeds? of the four-day event will go to the new St Xavier?s College campus coming up on a six-acre plot of land on the EM Bypass. ?It?s our dream project and we want to give it shape as soon as we can,? said Father P.C. Matthew. ?The new campus will be used for post-graduation studies, research, consultancy and publication,? added the principal.

 The presence of singers Kunal Ganjawala and Vasundhara Das for the December 23 Beyond Barriers evening is sure to bring in the expected 15,000-strong crowd.

 While Kunal has been the golden voice of Bollywood ever since he crooned Bheege honth tere in Murder, Vasundhara has rocked listeners from time to time with chartbusters like It?s the time to disco and the Salaam Namaste title track. She, of course, has also made a mark as an actress in Monsoon Wedding and Hey! Ram.

 Both Kunal and Vasundhara have performed in Calcutta before but not on the same platform. Before the two star singers take the stage, two alumni members, Shayne Hyrapiet and Tritha Sinha, will sing some popular Bollywood numbers.

 Also helping out with the funds for the new campus is the Singapore chapter of the St Xavier?s College Calcutta Alumni Association (SXCCAA), spearheaded by Sunil Patwari, general manager of Majuko Enterprises in the Lion Country. The 26-odd Xaverians in Singapore have already raised Rs 81,000 for the needy college students from the existing batch and have pledged to sponsor many more students in the coming months.

 ?We are now trying to tap our Middle-East chapter in Dubai,? says Imran Zaki, general secretary of SXCCAA. ?If we can get our global network going, then the fund flow will be smoother and the second campus can come up faster.? 

 Adding to the list of activities is the recent launch of the new Xavier?s website, www.sxccaa.org. Apart from a host of features, the website allows Xavierans to become alumni members online. Also available for browsing is a comprehensive database of all the existing members of the association.

 Work is also already underway for the 150-year celebrations of the college, slated for 2010. 

 A book on the history of the college and a database of the college students are being readied for the momentous occasion.

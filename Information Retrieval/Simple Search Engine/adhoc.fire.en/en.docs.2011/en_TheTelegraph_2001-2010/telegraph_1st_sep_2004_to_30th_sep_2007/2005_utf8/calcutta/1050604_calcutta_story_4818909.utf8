 A quick fix for skin-deep problems

 With quick fix being the order 

 of the day in most avenues of life, your beauty regimen 

 can hardly afford long, luxurious hours at the parlour. 

 With stress, heat and pollution levels playing havoc with 

 your skin, flaunting a porcelain finish look is almost Mission 

 Impossible. One way out of this skin-deep problem has recently 

 hit the Calcutta beauty market in the form of instant solutions.

 There are many options available 

 now that can provide beauty solutions in very short time 

 spans, says cosmetologist Veena Joshi. 

 These magical transformations, 

 offered by products from Indian as well as some international 

 brands, are increasingly becoming popular with women on 

 the move. 

 The most popular brand in this 

 segment is Purederm, which offers a range of instant solutions 

 for beauty problems. These products are easy to use, 

 they are cheap and show instant results, adds Bridgette 

 Jones of June Tomkyns. The parlour has been using these 

 products with successful results for over a month now.

 There are different varieties 

 of peel-off tissues that help in instant removal of wrinkles, 

 excess oil, dark circles and skin tan. These are non-woven 

 fabrics that look like paper tissues, but have the feel 

 of cloth, says Joshi. 

 Its a 10 minute affair 

 for the under-eye treatment, where we place the Purederm 

 strip under the eyes and take it off after a moment to reveal 

 lovely eyes without stress marks or dark circles, 

 explains Sharon, beautician at June Tomkyns. 

 The best thing about these products 

 is that they can be used at home quite easily. Priced between 

 Rs 70 and Rs 180 for a pack, these are available at select 

 parlours and Nik Nish outlets. 

 One can remove anything 

 from wrinkles to acne and sun tan by using these just once. 

 Though the effect stays for a short time, immediate results 

 are assured. And there are no side effects either, 

 adds Bridgette.

 Rita Mohan of Rapunzel prescribes 

 the use of under-eye ampoules that help get rid of dark 

 circles in one stroke. We also have immediate skin 

 lightening and pigmentation reduction facials that take 

 an hour and 10 minutes but show instant results, adds 

 Rita.

 For quick rejuvenation for after-office 

 parties or during outdoor work, No Marks has recently come 

 up with a range of skin-care products. 

 Our three-step skincare 

 pack, consisting of a face wash, a walnut scrub and a moisturising 

 mask, provides the skin with necessary vitamins and nourishment 

 and the results show in a matter of minutes, says 

 P.S. Sandhu, a spokesperson for the company.

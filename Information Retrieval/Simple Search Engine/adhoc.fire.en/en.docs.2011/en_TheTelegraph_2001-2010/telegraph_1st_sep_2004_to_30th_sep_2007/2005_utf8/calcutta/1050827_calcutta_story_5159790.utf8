 Build, but safe from quakes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 New buildings, residential or commercial, will have to be earthquake-resistant.

 Following a discussion with his council member (building) Dipankar De, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya has called a meeting with the director-general (building), city architects and executive engineers of the building department next week to draft the policy framework.

 Over 3,000 buildings are coming up in the city every year and not all of them are designed to withstand an earthquake of moderate intensity.

 Calcutta lies in segment III of the seismic zones, a ?moderate-damage risk zone?. But it is close enough to segment IV, a ?high-damage risk zone?, to wake planners up to the possibility of a Bhuj-like disaster.

 The central government, under its National Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction Programme, has been insisting on the civic body to enforce ?seismic-free? rules in the construction of buildings. 

 In response, the civic authorities held a four-day session this week to train masons in seismic-safe construction. 

 Altogether, five civic engineers and 15 masons attended the session in the first phase, held under the guidance of Sekhar Datta, of Bengal Engineering and Science University. City architect (south) Somnath Pal said the masons got a daily honorarium of Rs 100. 

 Civic assistant engineer (building) Rihan Sanyal said the masons were taught about ?reinforce detailing? for concrete piling and casting, as mentioned in the guidelines of Seimic Code in IS 1893, part III.

 The special reinforcement binding technique will make buildings quake-safe within a ?predictable? limit. The construction cost, experts say, will rise by within 20 per cent.

 The construction cost per sq ft of a building varies between Rs 450 and Rs 550, whereas the average selling price is around Rs 1,400. 

 ?Hence, there is enough scope for a developer to cushion the 20 per cent extra cost for making buildings seismic-safe,? said mayoral council member De.

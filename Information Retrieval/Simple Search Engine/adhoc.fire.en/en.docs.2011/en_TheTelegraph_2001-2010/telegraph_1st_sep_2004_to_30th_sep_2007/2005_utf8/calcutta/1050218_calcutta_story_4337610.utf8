Lzone: Meena Bazaar

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 The riot of colour is sure to catch your eye the moment you cross Swabhumi?s Urban Courtyard and step into the Food Court to catch a quick bite. And once distracted, you will just have to take a closer look at the little thatched stalls lining the pathway, loaded with a range of well-crafted and colourful jewellery and home d?cor products. This is Meena Bazaar, and any weekend evening in this part of the heritage park is abuzz with activity.

 Crowds of smiling young women flock the shops to pick up everything from dokra earrings to seashell-embellished belts. A deal here is never complete without first checking out the fare in at least half-a-dozen shops, trying items on, bargaining for the best price before going in for the kill.

 After you?ve filled your bag with knickknacks, you simply can?t leave without digging into a platter of tangy bhelpuri or papri chaat dished out by the sole chaat wala at Meena Bazaar. 

 Jewellery

 Jewellery is undoubtedly the mainstay here. Colourful beads, lovely stones and shining metal call out to shoppers.

 The USP of the jewellery here, be it a funky oxidised wristband or an elaborate pendant in white metal studded with stones, is the reasonable price. With just Rs 100 in your wallet, some careful scanning and skilful bargaining could land you a mixed-and-matched set worth your while.

 Perfect to team with denims or smart kurtas, this funky ethnic jewellery is for the trendy and young at heart. Earrings, neckpieces or bangles ? everything here has a distinct style. 

 The oxidised, used look dominates, with beads and stones being the main embellishments. Cute to chunky, the variation ensures you will find something to suit your mood.

 Home decor

 At Meena Bazaar, you could also pick up some excellent items for the home and kitchen. Salt and peppershakers, serving spoon sets, trays and small bowls have both utility and aesthetic value. Items made from bamboo can also be put to good decorative and practical use. Flower vases, mats and cups are the pop picks in this section.

 Puppets and masks made in folk styles are also on offer. The Rajasthani couple dressed in colourful finery is a big hit. These make for excellent gifts and could also help jazz up your room.

Accessories

 Jute rules as the favoured material. Chappals and sling bags in this natural fibre, jazzed up with woollen threads, patchwork and sequins make for excellent gifts.

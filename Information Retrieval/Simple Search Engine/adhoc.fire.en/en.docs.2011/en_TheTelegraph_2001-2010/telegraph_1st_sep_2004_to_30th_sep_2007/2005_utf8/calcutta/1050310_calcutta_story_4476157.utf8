Hatful of roles for Hema

How well would she fit into Meryl Streep?s shoes, 

as the beautiful and bored middle-aged housewife who is swept off her feet by 

a stranger in The Bridges of Madison County? Point to ponder. But Hema 

Malini assures that the director will make things easy for the Indian audience. 

 ?It?s a very mature story and Ravi Chopra has Indianised it in a very nice way. He has given all the right reasons for the whats and whys? Such films are not always made,? says Hema, wary of divulging too much about the yet-untitled film, which will have Amitabh Bachchan doing a Clint Eastwood. 

 After they flashed some great chemistry in Ravi Chopra?s Baghban ? the tale on the woes of ageing parents made a splash at the 2003 box-office ? Hema and Amitabh got to share screen space in Yash Chopra?s Veer-Zaara, and they now have more projects in the offing. ?Well, I am doing Ravi Chopra?s Babul. I have only one hero in all my films,? she laughs, hinting at the Big B.

 Though her hands are full with a TV serial, dance shows, rehearsals and chaperoning daughters Esha and Ahana, Hema Malini seems to be relishing the renewed tryst with films in the august of her career. 

 ?I enjoy working in films,? she says and pauses for a grin. 

 ?But you know the industry functions in a different way these days. I don?t think I would be working if I were young now... Because I have been brought up in such a way that would have made it really difficult for me,? she says, with a wistful look in the eye.

 ?I wasn?t interested in coming to films in the first place. It was when a producer cast me in his film and then rejected me saying I was too skinny that I resolved to prove myself. It was like a challenge for me. These rejections, in a way, are good for your growth. Then Anant Swamy signed me opposite Raj Kapoor (in Sapnon ka Saudagar) and I didn?t have to look back since,? she goes on. ?I have also not replaced anyone in any film like they do nowadays. Whichever film I worked in, I have always been the first choice of the producer and the director,? she adds, almost as an afterthought.

 Yet, when it comes to her daughters, Hema prefers to prod them into fighting it out than shying away. ?My children have to face life. They have to understand what is good and bad and go ahead. But I love to pamper them and be with them like my mother used to be with me,? says the doting mom who often finds it difficult to squeeze out time, given the busy shoot schedule for Sahara One?s soap Kamini Damini.

 ?This serial is like an extension of Baghban. Whatever I couldn?t do there, I am doing it here,? she smiles. ?But the saddest part of TV is that it?s only for one-time viewing. There?s no scope for repeats as in with films.? 

 Though Hema had tasted considerable success on TV with Nupur ? a popular serial of the early 90s mirroring the travails of a classical dancer ? the star is wary of testing her mettle on the telly again.

 ?Things have changed a lot. You have to start from scratch and I can?t really make another serial now. Doing a daily soap is very difficult. Shooting is a little time-consuming, from morning to night, and I am not being able to cope with that. It becomes a little uneasy for me,? says she. 

 As a member of Rajya Sabha, Hema intends to encourage more dance festivals in the temples across the country, which would boost fresh talent in classical dance.

 ?Sometimes I also think of writing a book on myself,? she muses. ?And why shouldn?t I? I have so much experience to share, there are so many things about which I have not spoken to others ? what kind of a child I have been and things like that. I am sure some people will be interested to know,? the Dream Girl smiles again, with that sparkle in the eye.

 Fly the sky, soar the space

 - AVIATION AS A CAREER OPTION

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The invitation card to the exhibition on aviation and space

 Stumped about how a pilot?s ejection seat works or confused about a career choice in the skies? Seven days on all things aviation could help you with the answers.

 Birla Industrial amp; Technological Museum (BITM) and Aeronautical Society of India (AeSI) are organising an exhibition on aviation and space between December 1 and 7 at BITM.

 ?The idea is to make people aware of the aviation field, as well as help students form a better idea on the area as a career option,? said Jayanta Sthanapati, director of BITM.

 Participants include Airports Authority of India, IIT Kharagpur, Indian Air Force, Indian Airlines, Indian Coast Guard, Indian Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, BITS Ranchi and more.

 On display at the exhibition ? spread over 7,000 sq ft and two floors ? would be a real ejection seat with demonstrations on how it works during a crash. 

 The Airports Authority of India will make presentations on the way traffic control and signalling is carried out at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Airport. Functioning of gyroscopes in determining direction and altitude during flights will also be explained.

 ?A seven-ft model of an aircraft carrier will help demonstrate the instrument landing system and how fighter planes take off from the sea. An aircraft collision avoidance model will also be shown,? said D.C. Basu of AeSI.

 The space component of the exhibition includes details on how weather forecasts are made with the help of satellites. A model helicopter will also soar on the lawns of the Gurusaday Road address during the exhibition week.

 The event was held on a smaller scale last year. ?There was a fantastic response and when we closed after three days, several schools complained about the short duration,? Basu said. 

 The exhibition is, therefore, being held over seven days this time and 120 schools have been invited.

 ?With the skies opening up, there?s soon to be a vacuum in the supply of pilots and staff. We hope that the exhibition would offer all the information that students need to decide whether they want a career in aviation,? Sthanapati added.

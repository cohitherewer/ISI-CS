 Scooby-Doo: Live and kicking

From toon tamasha it?s time for live action. 

Scooby-Doo sniffs into your drawing rooms on HBO on June 24.

The story of Scooby-Doo, based on the longest continually 

running cartoon series in television history, takes off as the clumsy crime-fighting 

mutt and his human counterparts, Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle 

Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardellini) and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) are reunited to 

investigate a series of paranormal incidents at the Spooky Island, owned by Emile 

Mondavarious (Rowan ?Bean? Atkinson). 

It seems like only yesterday when Scooby-Doo bounded 

into television, but this actually happened 32 years ago on September 13, 1969. 

This lumbering Great Dane has ruled the hearts of millions of animation lovers 

across the world since then. Though afraid of monsters, ghouls, witches and even 

his own shadow, Scooby-Doo bumbles his way through mysteries often solving them 

by fluke.

Scooby-Doo soundly captured first place at 

the box-office on its opening weekend. The $54.2 million opening is now the second 

biggest for a June release in box-office history. 

It seems that when the legendary William Hannah and 

Joseph Barbera developed Scooby Doo, Where Are You? more than 30 years 

ago, they were taking a risk ? it was the first time that an animation series 

would incorporate an action-adventure format with an animal in a lead role and 

?humans? in supporting roles. 

Fred Silverman, the then head of CBS children?s programming, 

inspired by the Frank Sinatra song Strangers in the night where Sinatra 

improvises the refrain ?Scooby-dooby-doo?, advised William Hannah and Joseph Barbera 

to call the dog ?Scooby-Doo?. He also asked the duo to make him more fun and turn 

him into the show?s star. Thus Scooby-Doo was born! 

Scooby-Doo has starred in a range of animation series 

in his 30-year career as a full-time cartoon character, since his debut in 1969. 

What?s more, the franchise has got bigger with Scooby Snacks made at the Scooby 

Snack Factory, which tastes like a large butterscotch-coloured morsel. 

Now that you know so much, get ready for a bigger 

munch of the mutt this Friday at 9 pm.

 A moment from the Moroccan film Ali Zaoua: 

Festival pick

 Another chance to catch some offbeat foreign films 

in Calcutta. The French Embassy in India and the French Association, in collaboration 

with Kolkata Film Festival and Nandan, present ?Au sud du cinema?, a festival 

of 10 films from different parts of the world.

All the 10 films have been supported by the Fonds 

Sud Cinema which, since 1984, ?has fostered cinematographic productions in Africa, 

Asia and Latin America, by co-financing?. 

Starting June 22 and on till July 1, the festival 

will be kickstarted with the inaugural Senegalese film Hyenes by director 

Djibril Diop Manbety which explores love and betrayal and its co-relation with 

money. 

The other films to be shown at Nandan II and Nandan 

III over the 10 days include fictional works from countries like Cambodia, Tunisia, 

Lebanon, Tadjikistan, Morocco, China, Argentina and South Africa. Most of the 

films have been honoured or screened at the Cannes Film Festival. So, get ready 

to taste everything from civil wars to Zulu rituals.

 Snow White: Fairy fare

 It was the very first feature-length animated film 

made and the winner of an honorary Academy Award. Snow White and the Seven 

Dwarfs premieres in Hindi on Disney Channel on June 25, 6 pm.

Nominated for the Best Music Score Academy Award in 

1938, the movie is the 10th highest grosser of all times. The timeless tale of 

Snow White comes alive with fairy-tale magic, suspense and adventure loved by 

kids and adults alike.

The story is legendary ?when Snow White?s wicked stepmother, 

the Queen, consults her Magic Mirror to learn that her stepdaughter?s beauty surpasses 

her own, she orders for snow white?s assassination. 

You know the rest, but rediscover the magic nevertheless 

with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs on June 25.

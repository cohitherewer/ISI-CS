 Duel with the disease 

 Its a malaise that the young 

 are most prone to. Subhajoy Roy speaks to a team with 

 an award-winning scientist, dedicated to research on kala-azar

 She chose the road less taken, 

 preferring research over more lucrative professions like 

 engineering or medicine. Her dedication won Sreedhara Gupta 

 national acclaim recently, in the form of the Young Scientist 

 Award by the Indian Science Congress Association for her 

 contribution to kala-azar research. 

 Sreedhara is part of a team at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Jadavpur, that has been researching kala-azar. The disease is a deadly one, and is particularly prevalent in certain areas of India, including West Bengal. ?WHO (World Health Organisation) has declared that in 2007 this disease is going to become an epidemic,? says the PhD student of IICB. 

 After passing out with top honours in Madhyamik from Sakhawat Memorial Girls School, she moved to South Point for Class XI and XII. Then, it was on to Jadavpur University for graduation and post-graduation in chemistry. When she applied for research work, kala-azar needed more hands. So she took the offer. ?Lots of people are affected by the disease, but there is not enough awareness,? says Sreedhara.

 Dr Salil C. Datta, head of the department of biological chemistry at IICB, explains: ?Tropical countries are mainly found to be affected by kala-azar. North America, Africa and Asia are the most affected, but not a single kala-azar patient has been identified in Australia to date. The skin of the kala-azar patient blackens gradually. It affects the spleen and liver the most, and the five to 16 age group is most prone. Lack of proper treatment may turn out to be fatal.? 

 A female sandfly is the carrier of the parasite that spreads the disease. WHO has laid special emphasis on tackling kala-azar, which has been found to be among the five most widespread diseases in the world. In India, the eastern region remains the most affected area. States like Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Uttar Pradesh and Bengal have the most number of kala-azar patients. In December 2004, the village of Phoolmalancha in South 24-Parganas was severely affected, leaving 25 dead. Around that time, kala-azar also struck in Kandi, Murshidabad.

 Adding to the danger is the fact that some recent cases have been showing a different strain of this disease. ?It is being seen that HIV/AIDS patients are prone to kala-azar and vice versa. So there may be a link,? says Datta. 

 Dr U.N. Bramhachari first came up with a preventive drug for kala-azar, which worked well on soldiers during World War II. But it is no longer effective. There are a few drugs available, but they?re expensive, toxic and have side effects which can sometimes be fatal. Research as well as clinical trials are ongoing. 

 It is her research that earned Sreedhara the award. Applications poured in for the award from around the country. Six were finally selected, who then presented their papers to a jury and faced questions on their work. Sreedhara won the award in the area of new biology, and received it in Gandhinagar in January this year.

 ?We don?t make medicines. We provide details about the ingredients to be used and certain other clues based on which medicines are made,? adds Datta. ?The parasitic cells and the host cells are almost the same. Parasites survive on the host cell?s nutrients. We have found a characteristic present only in the parasites. So we can apply drugs which are less toxic and kill that particular parasite, with less side effects,? summed up Datta. 

 The team is also trying to develop 

 drugs from medicinal plants.

 Whats 

 on your mind this week

 Soccer success

 May 25, 2005, is etched in red 

 on my calender. Soccer aficionados reading this will know 

 why. The fever and the thrill of the past few months culminated 

 in a memorable event ? the grand finale of the Champions 

 League in Istanbul. Seemed like Lady Luck was playing dice 

 that day at the stadium. Just when AC Milan was feeling 

 the wind beneath its wings, Liverpool stormed out of their 

 doldrums and gave the 2003 champions a demonstration of 

 resilience, which they are sure to remember. Here?s wishing 

 the club a vintage 2005-2006 season back home. Steven Gerrard?s 

 men are on song and their fans are probably singing: ?While 

 all those around us fade and they tire/You will hear the 

 Kops singing the reds never tire.?

 Go Greg

 With the mantra of full time commitment 

 to excellence on and off the field, Greg Chappell has impressed 

 the selection committee. It?s now up to India whether they 

 can make the best use of this man. The successful ex-cricketer 

 from Australia, once known for his crisp pulls and cover 

 drives, hates losing. With his experience as a coach, there 

 is no doubt about the fact that he is one man who can make 

 a difference in the team. If competent support staff is 

 provided and a proper bowling and fielding coach is appointed 

 as per his wishes, he can certainly live up to his promise. 

 The BCCI should give him more say in the selection process. 

 Here we can learn a lesson from Pakistan ? Bob Woolmer was 

 given a free hand. Personal wishes and tantrums thrown by 

 the skipper should be ignored.

 Sati sacrilege

 The recent act of sati by 70-year-old 

 Ramkumari shows that the identity of a woman is still limited 

 to her husband. Even more flabbergasting is the concept 

 of her family building a temple to glorify this act. No 

 one seems to bother about the painful death of a frail, 

 old woman but are keen to portray this as a heroic deed, 

 which increases the possibility of repetition of such a 

 heinous practice. Lack of education is the cause of such 

 practices still persisting in rural India. The situation 

 of rural women is extremely paradoxical. On the one hand 

 they are revered as goddesses, on the other they are denied 

 their basic rights.

 of the sun, and yet they are a carefree bunch

 In praise of profs

 Strict, stern and decorous ? this 

 is how we usually perceive the pillars of our education, 

 our teachers. Many add the epithets formidable and unapproachable. 

 But in the English department of Presidency College, our 

 professors are our second parents, taking personal interest 

 in every student and affording guidance through love, understanding 

 and amiability. Treating hungry students to chocolate biscuits 

 and tea while taking extra classes, arranging special classes 

 on theories outside the syllabus, clearing pre-examination 

 doubts over phone, making accessible to the students the 

 assistance and guidance of renowned professionals from different 

 fields... For everything they have done for me and my batch-mates, 

 thank you all very much, especially J.G. ma?am, D.B. ma?am, 

 M.A. ma?am and S.K.M. sir.

 Party politics

 In India, there are more then 

 100 political parties. New ones are added to the list almost 

 every day. This is good, if the parties actually do good 

 work by helping the people. But some parties misuse their 

 power through illegal activities. Many students are joining 

 political parties. In college, these students don?t study 

 properly. They always sit in the party office and think 

 they will pass the exams using party clout. But they are 

 not aware of the dangers of politics. Some of these local 

 parties behave like gangs, trying to outdo each other through 

 crime. The students are joining politics without thinking 

 of the future, hoping that the party will give them greater 

 opportunities later in life. However, only a proper education 

 can prepare one for the future.

 Teacher trouble

 Remember Tiyasa Biswas, the girl 

 who committed suicide after being humiliated by her teacher? 

 Tiyasa is not the only one to undergo such suffering. The 

 growing incidence of such cases proves that the teacher-student 

 relationship is a thing of the past. In most schools, semi-literate 

 teachers often psychologically harass students for small 

 reasons and even if a complaint is made, the authorities 

 try to hush up the issue by giving a clean chit to the teacher. 

 This mounting pressure adds to the psychological problems 

 of the students, which result in such extreme steps. An 

 independent board should be constituted to rationally and 

 psychologically counsel teachers and only then should they 

 be recruited.

 Prisoner

 And the prisoner will be born 

 Will the horse ride to the moon? 

 There will be dungeons in the eye 

 And the blood will dry 

 The vision will fly 

 The vision must die 

 And the prisoner will be born 

 Are there ghosts in the siren? 

 In the celebration of ashes 

 And in numbed fears 

 There will be loss of fingers 

 Among the dead singers 

 And the prisoner will be born 

 Do you feel the traveller in your body? 

 There will be an open diary 

 On the sea shore 

 ? The story of a whore 

 With hours between the doors 

 And the prisoner will be born 

 And the prisoner will be born again.

 Dria?s home

 And Dria picked up the blue doll 

 Lying on the floor, 

 A long time now? 

 We sit in the brown caf? 

 And wonder where the dead rose dropped, 

 On the hills or in the folds of the curtain? 

 The rain flickers like the farmer?s lantern 

 When there is lightning 

 And often Dria stands at night 

 Over the fields of rice 

 Watching the farmer on his night patrol? 

 I look at the stray hair 

 Dria gave me 

 When she left our town 

 To look for fish 

 I never read your poetry 

 It was in another language 

 But now I think it?s mine too 

 When she brings your words home 

 Etched on coconut leaves? 

 I wait for a good song at the caf? 

 And ask why 

 He dreamt of parrots 

 In every sleep? 

 And from the screen of my car 

 I can watch Dria 

 Softly step into the beggar?s eye 

 And say, ?let?s go home??

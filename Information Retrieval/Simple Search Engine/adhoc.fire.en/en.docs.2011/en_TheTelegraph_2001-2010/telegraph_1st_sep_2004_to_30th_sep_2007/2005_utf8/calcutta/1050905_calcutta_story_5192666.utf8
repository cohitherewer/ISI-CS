 Love betrayed

 A simple tale of love and languishing, Chandrabati inspires and renews our faith in the fundamental values and virtues of life, like tolerance, fortitude and forgiveness. Based on a popular story from Mymensingha Geetika, a collection of centuries-old Bangladeshi pala (ballads), it narrates the tragic love story of two young lovers, Chandrabati and Jayananda. Friends since childhood, they fall in love and decide to get married. But fate ordains otherwise, as Jayananda is dazzled and besotted by the beauty of Asmani, the daughter of a Muslim kazi. He sends her letters, expressing his feelings of love and admiration for her. Asmani, fully aware of Jayananda?s vow to marry Chandrabati, tells her father of his feelings for her, and he forces Jayananda to marry his daughter. Shocked and betrayed by the turn of events, Chandrabati shuns everything and becomes a recluse, spending her days in worship. Finally, when a repentant Jayananda returns, she refuses him. Direction: Manish Mitra.

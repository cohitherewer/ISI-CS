 A circle of art

 Artists, more than any other like-minded people, feel the need to bond and share their experiences of life. Young Artists Painters Circle is a group that believes in giving its members absolute liberty to express themselves and their perception of life, so that they can give free rein to their creativity. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by the group encapsulates the artists? common vision of achieving equanimity in life after successfully overcoming all odds. Featuring works by four painters, the show attempts to evoke a sense of balance and harmony from the distinctive and disparate themes and styles explored by each artist. Gour Ghosh?s paintings (one of them appears above) are visually powerful emblems of modern life, depicting social and moral decadence as an obvious effect of the degeneration of our natural environment. The paintings of Utpal Ghosh witness the artist coming to terms with the sufferings of childhood, breaking away from conventional ideas of celebrating and sentimentalising the past. Pulak Karmakar?s canvases seek to define the blurred borders that exist between a materialistic and a spiritual way of life, and Rajib Sur Roy?s broad, expansive and colourful works try to revive and engender the affinity between nature and mankind.

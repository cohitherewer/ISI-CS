 On the Goa waters for Kahiin To Hoga

 Goa?s beaches are getting more and more popular with production teams. After dozens of films, including Gurinder Chadha?s high-profile Bride amp; Prejudice, got canned on the sun and sands of the state, it was the turn of Balaji?s superhit late-night show Kahiin To Hoga to hit the Goa beaches last weekend. 

 The STAR Plus serial which revolves around the lives of five sisters, Kashish, Kanan, Mouli, Mehek and Charu, has been notching up high TRP ratings mainly because of the popularity of its lead cast of Aamna Sharif and Rajiv Khandelwal, who play Kashish and Sujal in Kahiin To Hoga. In fact, the reverse auction SMS contest on the show received record number of messages from across the country, all trying to win the diamond necklace Sujal presented Kashish.

 While the main story revolves around the fatal love triangle between Kashish, Sujal and Piyush, there are hordes of sub-plots which keep popping up here and there. The particular episode shot in Goa features the trio of Rishi, Swayam and Akshat getting involved in a jet bike fight. The race becomes more than just a race with both Swayam and Rishi trying to push each other into the water, leading to a nasty fall. So the casual jet-bike challenge leads to an underwater fight ? shot for the first time for the small screen ? amongst the boys. 

 The scene was shot at the private Wengani beach of the Ce da de Goa Hotel. The three-camera set-up, including one pitched under water, captured the actors performing their own stunts even though there were lifeguards to act as doubles for them. 

 That?s not all. In true James Bond-style (or rather in Charlie?s Angels fashion), a new character was introduced on the Goa beaches in Kahiin To Hoga. Apeksha, played by actress Nisha Sareen, made her small-screen entry speeding in on a jet bike under the careful supervision of director Anil V. Kumar and cameraman Deepak Malvankar.

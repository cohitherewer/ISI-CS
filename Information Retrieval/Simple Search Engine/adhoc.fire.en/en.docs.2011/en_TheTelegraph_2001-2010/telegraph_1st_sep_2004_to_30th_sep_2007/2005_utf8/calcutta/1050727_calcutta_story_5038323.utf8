 Multi-crore scam bust nets four

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Police have stumbled upon a scam in which nearly 65,000 people of the city and Howrah were robbed of crores of rupees over a one-year period. 

 Four persons have so far been arrested in this connection. A hunt is on for several others involved in the scam.

 ?The owners of the company behind the scam had used documents bearing forged stamps of approval of the Reserve Bank of India to win the confidence of investors. There is more to the matter than meets the eye,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 

 The fraud came to light following a complaint by Kanhiah Kumar Shaw. He told officers of Park Street police station that the company had cheated him of Rs 1.28 lakh. 

 Shaw further alleged that several others had been duped in a similar manner. 

 Investigations have so far revealed that Norton Marketing Private Limited, the company, started as a retail business, selling a variety of products through a network of executives. To become an executive, one had to pay Rs 500, in lieu of which a host of items were on offer.

 Besides a percentage of the profit, the executives were promised gifts ranging from two-wheelers to cars. To qualify, each executive had to bring nine others into the fold. 

 ?The company initially sold quality products to gain the confidence of its customers. Before long, however, it started pushing for over-priced, inferior-quality products,? stated Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief. 

 The operations of the company were launched from a small office in Park Street. It later shifted to its current CIT Road address.

 For each investment of Rs 500, the executives were handed a receipt bearing their identity number. On the face of any query, the authorities flashed the fake RBI permission to run such a company. 

 Sleuths have recovered a large number of forged documents from the company?s office. The Park Street office has also been sealed. Cops are presently listing the company?s moveable and immovable assets.

 The four arrested ? Ajit Chaudhury, Md. Zakir Hussain, Anuj Chaudhury and Md. Akbar ? in the city and Howrah, on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust, have been remanded in police custody.

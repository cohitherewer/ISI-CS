 It?s a computer fair. But the PC as a computing machine is pass?, and peripheral devices and accessories are where the action is for the tech-savvy.

 At Computex 2005, a fair of IT products being held at Calcutta Ice Skating Rink, flying off the shelves are PC games, webcams and portable music players.

 ?This is the first time that we have put up an Apple stall at Computex and the response has been very good,? said Sanjay Chordia of Systematix Media. ?In the past two days, we have sold eight to nine iPods that includes not just the cheaper iPod Shuffle but the 4GB Mini and 30GB Photo models, too,? he added.

 The Mac Mini, Apple?s attempt at luring Windows users to its side with a lower cost option, is also finding takers. Priced at Rs 30,000, Systematix has sold four Minis at Computex 2005.

 ?With PCs becoming a must in every household, people are going for more and better peripheral devices now,? offered Hari Prapan Tharad of Fair Centre, organiser of the four-day fair with 54 stalls. Discounts, special offers and live demos also attract the crowd, he added.

 ?Compared to other fairs, we have seen a lower response here as we see people going for products like webcams,? admitted a stall manager of Isyn PC, one of the new home-grown manufacturers of low-cost PCs. 

 Stalls offering PC games ? from the latest Doom3 to lower-priced classics like Roadrash ? are also getting a fair share of visitors, young and old alike.

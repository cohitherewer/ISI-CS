 Varsity in B-school foray

 - Jadavpur campus management courses for graduate engineers

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Having produced a good number of quality engineers in the past five decades, Jadavpur University is making a foray into the field of management education.

 ?We are already recognised as one of India?s finest engineering institutions and have decided to introduce management courses to open better placement avenues for our engineers,? Partha Pratim Biswas, a member of the university?s executive council, said on Monday.

 The university has been deemed fit by the Centre to be upgraded to an IIT and has already been declared a ?centre of excellence?. It decided last week to go ahead with its latest expansion plan.

 An increasing demand from students has prompted the university authorities to take the decision. 

 A meeting of the university?s faculty council was held recently to finalise ways of implementing the scheme. The authorities of All-India Council for Technical Education have given their nod to the university for starting management courses.

 The university is determined to achieve a unique position in the field of producing efficient management cadre, stated Biswas.

 To this end, its management courses will not be similar to those offered by management institutes like the IIMs. There won?t be courses in personnel management, marketing management or finance management. Instead, the modules will be targeted exclusively at graduate and postgraduate engineers.

 For example, the university already runs a course on food technology. ?Among many other areas, we have a plan to open a course on food and nutrition management,? said a university official.

 The university runs bachelor?s degree courses in several other subjects, like construction engineering and electrical engineering. ?We wish to introduce corresponding courses in construction management and power management,? the officer explained.

 To compete with existing institutions imparting management education, the university is going in for a high-standard infrastructure and experienced faculty members.

 A considerable portion of National Instruments ? the sick unit being taken over by the university ? will be utilised to run the management programmes. 

 Both full-time and part-time courses will be offered. There will be evening courses for employed engineers. Initially, the courses will be at postgraduate level. Full-time undergraduate courses will be introduced later.

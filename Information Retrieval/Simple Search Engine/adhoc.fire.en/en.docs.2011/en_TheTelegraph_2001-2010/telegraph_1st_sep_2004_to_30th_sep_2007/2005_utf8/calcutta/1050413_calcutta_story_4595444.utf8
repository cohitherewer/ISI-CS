Stun the sun

Himika Chaudhuri finds out ways 

to keep your comfort zone cool, naturally

The sweltering summer heat gets to you the moment 

you step out of the controlled confines of your air-conditioned office. The best 

way to shun the sun after a hard day?s work is to lounge around in a home that?s 

as cool as a cucumber, and naturally. 

Air-conditioned interiors might be the most hassle-free 

ideal to achieve, but it is not the healthiest. Here are a few ways of keeping 

your comfort zone cool without compromising your wellbeing or pinching your purse. 

Terrace trick

Keeping the terrace of the house cool is the trick 

to lowering the overall temperature of the interiors. This is particularly essential 

for those living on top floors as direct rays of the sun on the terrace make the 

rooms below unbearably hot, especially in the afternoon. 

While the age-old practice of pouring water on the 

roof everyday after sundown to obtain a cooling effect works to a certain extent, 

there are other measures that can enhance it. One simple way is to place a layer 

of bhanrs (earthen teacups) on the concrete beam of the roof before the 

final layer of plaster is applied.

?Earthen cups absorb heat, thus keeping the concrete 

cooler. This helps cool the entire house,? says interior designer Manjari Sahay, 

who has tried this on the roof of a Salt Lake bungalow, achieving the desired 

result.

Ceiling show

While this renovation may not be a practical option 

for existing homeowners, putting up a false ceiling to stop the heat in its tracks 

might well be the other way out.

?We usually line the ceiling with a layer of thermocol 

and then cover it up with a false ceiling. This system helps immensely for those 

who live on the top floors and is a cheap and easy way to make the house cooler,? 

adds Sahay. 

Though this might eat into the height of the rooms 

below by a few inches, it?s still better than sweating it out for the better part 

of the year. 

Blind boon

One of the most popular ways of keeping interiors 

naturally cool is the use of the desi version of blinds ? khus khus. 

This age-old home accessory is still an essential part of the interiors of north 

Indian houses, where summers are more severe than the eastern part of the country. 

These natural sheets have to be watered regularly 

to get the desired cooling effect. And they add an old-world charm to the d?cor 

along with the chill. 

?Khus khus works very well to cool the house, 

but hanging them indoors could be a problem because the water drips from the sheets 

on the ground and can be messy,? says designer Shamlu Dudeja, who?s been using 

khus khus on her verandahs for years now.

Curtain call

While it?s common knowledge that keeping the curtains 

drawn helps, the effect depends to a large extent on the variety of curtains you 

choose.

?In summer, one needs to use curtains with heavy lining 

to block the sun out. The layering helps absorb the excess heat,? says interior 

designer Gopa Ray.

However, there is no need to stick to cotton curtains 

in summer. Well-lined satin or even synthetic curtains are good enough to create 

the cool haven you crave.

Colour code

What applies to your wardrobe holds true for your 

walls as well. The lighter the better is the mantra to beat the heat. Very dark 

hued walls might do wonders to create a trendy ambience, but that?s surely not 

the best colour code for summer. 

Getting a fresh coat of paint on the walls before 

the start of the season is an expensive but effective option. ?Go for natural 

shades like peach, pista or even white if you can maintain it,? suggests 

Sahay. 

To add to the effect, use soft lights during the hot 

months. ?Strong lights are a strict no-no as these make the room hot,? feels Ray. 

Pop plants

Indoor plants not only add a fresh feel, these also 

help keep the home cooler, say interior designers. Add to the sensual delight 

by keeping a bowl of rosewater with floating rose petals under the fan and letting 

the fragrance fill the room. 

While filling up the nooks and corners of your house 

with lots of greens might be the thing to do, those living in more cramped apartments 

can use their box grills extending from the verandah and windows for the purpose.

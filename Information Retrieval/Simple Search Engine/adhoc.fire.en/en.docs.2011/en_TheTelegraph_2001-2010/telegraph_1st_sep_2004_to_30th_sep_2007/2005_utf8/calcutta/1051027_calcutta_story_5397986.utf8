 Italian job, just for the home

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Accessories from Robex available with lifestyle store Attitude this Diwali 

 Habitat in Europe, Crate amp; Barrel in the US, Marks amp; Spencer or Debenhams in the UK, Galleries Lafayette in France. And now, Attitude in Calcutta...

 After bringing to town latest international trends and designs in home improvement products from Tvilum-Scanbirk A/S of Denmark, the worlds largest manufacturer of domestic furniture, the Attitude chain has tied up with Italian major Robex for its designer home accessories.

 We have entered into an exclusive marketing alliance with the Biesse group of Italy to retail the lifestyle products of its high-profile Robex brand. These are chic designer items retailed from leading lifestyle stores around the world and will now adorn the racks of our outlets, says Gaurav Goenka of the Kitply family, CEO amp; customer companion, Universal Specialities Ltd, owners of the Attitude brand.

 From the best-selling chip--dip concept of Bruco (a set of bowls in various sizes joined together) to the Trifoglio (a tri-folded bowl) to Love (a heart-shaped bowl), the Robex range of Italian delights will be available this Diwali. We will stock the stuff at our flagship Loudon Street store as well as the upcoming 4,000-sq ft megastore on VIP Road, says Goenka.

 Robex trademark technology allows the Italian firm to produce special multi-layered items formed with five polystyrene layers and is highly resistant and lasting. The Robex multi-layer is composed of a central structure which lends it resistance and solidity, two non-deformable masterised layers and two transparent protective synthetic crystal films with porcelain finish, wood textures or colour.

 The items are non-deformable and shock-resistant, and can withstand temperatures ranging from -5? C to + 78?C. They are dishwasher safe, odourless and do not absorb liquids, promises Goenka, who is also stocking his retail racks with kitchen items from Biesse Casa, another company from the same Italian group.

 The very encouraging response at the Loudon Street store (with sales growth of 200 per cent from April to August) has prompted the chain to go into expansion mode. The second Attitude outlet on VIP Road opposite Big Bazaar, set to be unveiled this week, will also signal a subtle shift in product-mix. While Loudon Street will showcase more of the high-end lines, the VIP Road store will have a more generic spread.

 We had started with the good-better-best sequence in Calcutta in terms of product profile and pricing. But customer response has inverted the pattern and we are being flooded with enquiries about top-of-the-line stuff. Our bed-swapping scheme too was a huge hit and we became the highest-selling furniture store in Calcutta in August, the CEO declares.

 Next in line is a 10,000-sq ft store on MG Road in New Delhi, followed by another large-format outlet in Bangalore. Attitude imports all its products from Tvilum-Scanbirks five fully-automated furniture factories in Denmark in knockdown, ready-to-assemble condition.

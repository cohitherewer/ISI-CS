The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School trail to Ayodhya

 - Cousins leave home, found a day later in UP rail station

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Every morning, when nine-year-old Barun Kumar left with cousin Arun for school, little did his aunt realise that the boy was hatching a runaway plot. Till Monday, that is. 

 Having left for school around 7.45 am, the Class III student landed up with his five-year-old cousin at Sealdah railway station and boarded the Jammu-Tawi Express, probably seeking ?some adventure.? 

 Around 12 hours after the two went ?missing?, police finally traced them to Ayodhya rail station, in Uttar Pradesh. 

 Railway officers spotted the two tired and terrified kids in their school uniform, sitting in one corner of the station, around 6 am on Tuesday. The Ayodhya rail officers informed police here that the two boys had been traced.

 Barun?s father Devi Deen, a railway employee working at the Beleghata workshop, had brought his son to the city from Ayodhya two years ago, to get him a good education.

 With his cousin Ram Prasad and wife Sunita Devi for company in the modest railway quarters on North Sealdah Road, Devi Deen thought his only son wouldn?t face a problem living away from his mother. 

 Accordingly, Barun and his cousin, Arun, were admitted to SVS English School, on Chittaranjan Avenue, in Class II and KG I, respectively.

 A year later, when Barun failed to do well in school ? he barely managed to scrape through the Class II final exams ? a young engineering student, Santosh Mishra, was roped in to tutor them.

 On Monday, when tutor Mishra spotted the two at Sealdah station, Barun told him they were waiting for their uncle to return with train tickets. Satisfied with the reply, Mishra left the duo. This was around 9.30 am, over two hours after the two had left for school.

 ?Yesterday, around 7.45 am, I put them on an autorickshaw near Tasveer Mahal cinema, on Gas Street. Around 11 am, when I reached school, the teachers told me that the two had not arrived. I broke down,? Sunita recounted.

 Narkeldanga police were alerted at 4 pm.

 ?We are still not sure what prompted the boy to leave. Was he looking for some adventure? Did he or did he not travel ticketless? Besides, why would Barun flee home with his cousin to meet his mother, when he could have asked his father to take him to Ayodhya? We are waiting for the two boys to arrive,? said Vineet Goyel, deputy commissioner of police (ESD).

 Bar-lorry plea for pollution

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The green bench of the high court will hear on Friday a public interest litigation seeking a watchdog to monitor environmental pollution caused by at least 10,000 unauthorised heavy vehicles entering the city every night. The plea was moved on Monday.

 ?According to reports submitted by various experts? committees, appointed by the high court and also by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, environmental pollution at night in the city is higher than at daytime. It is because the administration is allowing thousands of heavy vehicles loaded with goods to enter the city between 8 pm and 8 am,? Subhas Dutta, green activist, alleged in his petition.

 The petitioner also alleged that there was no arrangement within the city to test the emission level of vehicles carrying goods at night. 

 ?There is no arrangement for testing the pollution level of the vehicles at the points of entry,? Dutta emphasised in his petition.

 He also submitted that the state government had decided long ago to relocate the big wholesale markets outside the city limits and construct truck terminals far from Calcutta. ?But these schemes have not been implemented, other than in Howrah,? he said.

 Dutta sought an immediate court order to direct the state government to relocate the wholesale markets and to construct truck terminals on the outskirts of the city. 

 In the meantime, arrangements should be made to test the emission level of goods vehicles at each entry point.

 Meet the other Mirza

 She doesnt mind being referred to as the other Mirza, what with Sania smashing her way to Grand Slam glory. In fact, Dia is rather proud to have another Hyderabadi making it to the top in her chosen field. 

 We have had to work much harder than others. And I know the kind of effort Sania has put in from the time she was just five. Its really good to see her getting all the rewards, Dia told Goodlife on Friday, when she came down to launch Vibes, a chain of slimming-and-beautification centres in the city.

 Having launched the Delhi and Hyderabad centres of Vibes in the last couple of days, Dia was most excited to come to Calcutta, since her mother is a Bengali, though the family has been in Hyderabad for two generations now.

 Aami ektu ektu Banglao bolte pari? Khub bhalo pari na, said Dia, in an accent better than many a Bengali small-screen actor.

 As brand ambassador of Vibes, Dia believes strongly in its concept. It redefines the word beauty salon. It takes the concept beyond a haircut and a blow dry. It uses cutting-edge technology to offer custom-made scientific solutions, she said in all earnestness.

 The petite actress looks upon the growing trend of slimming through starvation as a serious problem that needs to be addressed by both parents and teenagers.

 Most youngsters these days undergo acute depression and anxiety flipping through beauty magazines and watching film stars on the big screen. In an effort to lose weight they go into starvation mode, which unknowingly adds to the fat as the body goes into shock and tries to conserve energy.

 So what does Dia do to maintain her hourglass figure? I just work out in the gym and eat healthy food. But then again I am very lazy; some days I dont like to work out and then have to make up in the next session, she smiled.

 And who would she pick as the Bollywood bods? I think Shilpa Shetty has a great figure. Then you have Bipasha Basu, whos lost lots of weight and is looking really stunning these days...

 If her childhood Pujas were spent at the Durga mandir in Hyderabad, she expects to celebrate Durga Puja 2005 at the big bash that Rani Mukherjees mother hosts in their Mumbai residential complex.

 Dia could do with some divine intervention, with most of her Bollywood attempts having bombed at the box-office. But her cameo in Parineeta went down well and the filmi associations that came with it are what she wants to really latch on to.

 I did such a small role in the film because I was getting to work with names like Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Pradeep Sarkar, Dia explained. Also, even in that small role, I saw a character that would be remembered alongside the lead cast. I am very happy the way film turned out to be and the way it was received everywhere.

 Currently in slow gear, Dia is listening to a lot of scripts and hoping to turn the tinsel tide in her favour. And Bengali films are very much in the Mirza mindscape. Where are the Bengali film directors? I would love to do meaningful Bengali films if they come along.

 That might take some time coming, but Dia is now looking forward to the release of two Bollywood films ? Dil Sachcha Chehra Jhootha opposite Arjun Rampal and the Sohail Khan-produced action multistarrer Fight Club.

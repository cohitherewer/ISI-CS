The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 IT land at CM door

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 With land prices at Rajarhat, the state?s future information technology (IT) hub, being pegged at Rs 2.16 crore per acre, Calcutta?s cost advantage has been put into question. 

 Representatives from two leading IT companies ? Wipro and Mahindra-British Telecom (MBT) ? raised the issue with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday and sought his intervention to ensure fair price for plots of land in the state. 

 ?We are impressed with the changes happening here and want to tap the talent pool by setting up a development centre. But the price of land is a concern,? said Vineet Nayyar, MBT chief executive officer. 

 Per acre rates applicable to IT companies range between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 55 lakh in other metros.

 MBT, which specialises in telecom software, employs over 6,000 people between its development centres in Mumbai and Pune and is planning a third facility. The new centre will start with a workforce of around 500 and the headcount will be eventually ramped up to 2,000. 

 ?The choice is between Chennai, Chandigarh, Noida and Calcutta. We will take a decision on the location in a few weeks,? said Nayyar, who briefed chief minister Bhattacharjee about the company?s expansion plans. 

 The chief minister asked officials of MBT, a joint venture between Mahindra and Mahindra and British Telecom, to prepare a wishlist and promised action. 

 Later in the day, Tamal Dasgupta, chief information officer, Wipro, also called on Bhattacharjee. 

 ?We think the rate in Rajarhat is not logical and we are expressing our views to the government,? said Dasgupta, who also met IT minister Manab Mukherjee. 

 Though the housing infrastructure development corporation has allotted a 40-acre plot to Wipro in Rajarhat, the company is yet to communicate to the agency its land possession plans. 

 ?Wipro is keen on expansion. But they have an issue with the price of land. They are talking to the chief minister,? said minister Mukherjee.

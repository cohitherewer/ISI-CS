 They had to change several flights from Karachi during a tiring journey to reach the city. ?But the flowers with which we were received at the airport made us forget all that,? said Muhammad Ibrahim Rana.

 The chairman of Pakistan Electronics Media Association is heading a six-member delegation from across the border, which is visiting the city for Cable TV Show 2005, which got underway at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Tuesday.

 Touched by the Cable TV Equipment Traders amp; Manufacturers Association?s (CTMA) gesture of inviting them, the cablemen from Pakistan announced they would shortly host a similar ?fest? back home with participation from India, to return the favour.

 ?Cable operators have played a crucial role in helping the people of the two countries learn more about their cultures and lifestyles,? Rana offered.

 Rana also proposed formation of a SAARC Electronic Media Association, comprising cable operators from the SAARC region with the aim of promoting ?peace, love and trade relation?.

 There are around 1,000 licensed operators in Pakistan, according to Rana, with nearly 10,000 sub-operators under them. The average monthly subscription is 300 Pakistani Rupees for viewers but operators can charge more if they provide premium channels.

 CTMA is approaching the Centre to confer industry status on the cable trade. ?We fully support their plea and plan to ask our government to do the same back home,? Rana added.

 The three-day fair ? inaugurated by Assembly chief whip Rabin Deb ? has seen participation from channels, multi-system operators and cable and satellite equipment manufacturers from across the country.

 Tuesday also saw four STAR channels disappear from several lakh TV screens serviced by SitiCable, owing to a dues dispute.

 Come November, Calcuttans will be able to fly SpiceJet.

 By launching its service with a special ?red hot? launch fare of Rs 999 for a one-way ticket to Delhi on November 6, the airline, with the new generation, 189-seat Boeing 737-800 series aircraft, will make Calcutta its second home after Delhi.

 ?The city will be our second base, as we are aware of its great strength and marketing potential, as well as the people?s appreciation of quality services. We think Calcutta will prove to be our yet another success story,? said Ajay Singh, director of SpiceJet. 

 To start with, SpiceJet will have one flight daily to Delhi and back. ?We have plans to start operations to at least two more destinations from Calcutta and are working on the modalities,? Singh said.

 Apart from the inaugural fare, available till November 30, passengers travelling to Delhi can also opt for another special fare ? Rs 1,899 ? available for travel till January 31, 2006. The tickets can be booked till November 11, subject to availability of seats. 

 All fares, including the regular fare of Rs 2,499, shall be available for booking on the reservation system from October 20. 

 The flight will leave Delhi at 3.40 pm and reach Calcutta at 5.40 pm. The return flight will take off at 6.20 pm and arrive in Delhi at 8.35 pm. 

 What makes SpiceJet stand out from most other airlines is their marketing strategy. Instead of roping in travel agents and tour operators, the airline is planning to sell its tickets directly from its counter, through Internet (www.spicejet.com) and call centres. ?We want people to come to us directly and we can assure Calcuttans that unlike other airlines, it won?t be difficult for them to get in touch with us, even on the Net,? the airline director said.

 Starting November 14, the airline will also operate daily non-stop (direct) flights between Delhi and Mumbai, in addition to the existing flights on this sector via Ahmedabad. 

 The new flight will leave Delhi at 6.15 am and arrive in Mumbai at 8.10 am.

 Before the inclusion of Calcutta within its network, SpiceJet operated from Delhi, Bombay, Ahmedabad, Goa, Pune and Bangalore. 

 The airline is using a state-of-the-art technology to ensure fleet reliability and safety monitoring. It is also making significant investments in systems and technology.

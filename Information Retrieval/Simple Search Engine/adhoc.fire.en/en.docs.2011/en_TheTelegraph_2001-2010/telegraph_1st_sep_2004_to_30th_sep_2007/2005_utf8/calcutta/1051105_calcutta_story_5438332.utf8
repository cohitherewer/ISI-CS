 Watch-waistline diet for fit force

 - Meal module drafted to keep men in uniform slim, trim and active

 KINSUK BASU

 Mausambi, not mutton roll. Cucumber, not kachori. Slim cop, not fat cop?

 If things go according to the diet chart ? if is the operative word here ? pot-bellied policemen could be replaced by broad-shouldered, narrow-hipped lawmen.

 The prime targets of the experiments with fitness facts are fresh recruits, particularly those with the commissioner of police?s reserve force. But the count-your-calories condition, now included in the refreshers? course meant for both officers and constables, will soon apply to the seniors as well.

 According to the watch-your-waistline wish list drawn up by Guruprasad Banerjee, officer-in-charge of the governor?s security, the mean menu starts from the morning.

 Sample this: no kachori or samosa with the morning cuppa, just a handful of chhola before the first sip; no oil-dripping rolls or aloo-parathas in the afternoon, just fruits or muri. As for the munch between meals, cucumber or an apple is what the diet doctor has ordered.

 ?It?s not just about reducing weight. Our efforts are directed at ensuring that every member of the force remains fit, both physically and mentally,? says Zulfikar Hassan, joint commissioner (armed police).

 The rude-food regimen has been worked out to suit the men in uniform, adds Banerjee, given the onerous task of devising the module and monitoring it.

 ?The diet is part of total package that includes physical therapy and stress management. Cops tend to go long hours without food and then gorge till they can hardly breathe,? he says.

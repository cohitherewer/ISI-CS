A live grill bar with the choicest selection of imported 

meats, seafood and vegetables on display, a cheese trolley with varieties from 

round the world, a mobile flambe trolley cooking up Crepe Suzettes right by your 

table and a bar offering the finest wines, cognac and cigars. The experience at 

the West View Bar and Grill at the ITC Sonar Bangla aims to provide an ?overview 

of western culinary culture?, as executive chef of the hotel Ramesh Javvaji puts 

it.

?West View, one of the signature restaurants of ITC, 

gives an overview of western dining, without being overbearing in terms of gastronomy,? 

adds Javvaji, who took over as the executive chef less than a year ago. The show 

at West View, however, is run by the only woman chef working in the hotel ? Suniti 

Mittal.

The live cooking experience is offered in every section 

of the dinner-only restaurant ? be it the grill or the tableside flambe ? with 

the touch and feel factor being very important. 

The western-style grill bar is the mainstay of West 

View, and Mittal emphasises the ?western style? being the key. ?We often have 

guests asking for kebabs. But we want to make it clear that we offer the 

western grill, which is very different from Indian tandoor,? she says. 

While Indian barbecue stresses on heavy marination 

and the grilling is done on hot embers, the western style uses a gas-operated 

grill and lightly marinated meats and vegetables.

?Unlike tandoor, in this form of grilling, 

the juices of the meats and vegetables are retained, the marinades don?t kill 

the intrinsic flavours of the basic stuff. The western style of grilling is a 

very technical process that has to be monitored closely,? she adds.

Six varieties of meats (including seafood) and four 

vegetables are pre-marinated and displayed on the grill bar every day. After the 

guest takes his or her pick, the selection is then grilled with the required sauces 

and served with mashed potatoes, a salad, roast ginger and sun dried tomatoes. 

Soups and starters precede this meal, with a palate cleanser served in between 

courses.

The spread is changed everyday, with the number of 

items in each category remaining the same. ?The spread on offer everyday is designed 

keeping in mind the colour combination for visual appeal and the taste balance,? 

adds Javvaji.

The imported meats and vegetables are sourced from 

agents in Delhi and Mumbai, while the seafood comes from within the country. 

?The meats are all imported from Europe and Australia 

and some fish like the Norwegian salmon and yellow fin tuna are also sourced from 

abroad,? explains Javvaji. For the rest of the seafood, the hotel used to source 

everything, from octopus, lobster and king prawn to tuna, red snapper and black 

pomfret, from the south. But after the tsunami struck, the hotel is not taking 

any chances, now sourcing its seafood only from the coasts of Mumbai.

The marinades are all made in the kitchen itself with 

some basic ingredients imported. ?Each of the items are marinated using unique 

ingredients. Since guests used to Indian food don?t always appreciate the authentic 

flavours, I often try to make them spicier than usual,? says Mittal.

The exotic meats on offer include Australian pork 

chops, smoked pork loin, Australian Bratwurst sausages, German sausages, spring 

chicken breast and smoked glazed duckling breast among others. 

Some of the vegetables up for grilling include young 

asparagus, bell peppers, zuchini, queen olives and forest mushrooms.

For those not too fond of grilled gourmet, there is 

a limited a la carte section offering pasta and risotto.

The cheese trolley offers around six international 

varieties ? Grana Padano, Camembert, French Brie, Dutch Gouda, Danish Blue and 

Edam Ball. ?A lot of people drinking wine opt for cheese as accompaniment,? adds 

Mittal.

The other major draw of West View is the live flambe 

trolley, which is truly a visual delight. The mobile trolley visits the tables 

where Crepe Suzettes are whipped up in front of the guests, with orange sauce, 

orange peel and cointreau, served with vanilla ice-cream. 

Adding to the feast for the eyes are plush leather 

and wood interiors. These, coupled with Don Saigal and his band playing light 

jazz in the evenings, complete the West View experience.

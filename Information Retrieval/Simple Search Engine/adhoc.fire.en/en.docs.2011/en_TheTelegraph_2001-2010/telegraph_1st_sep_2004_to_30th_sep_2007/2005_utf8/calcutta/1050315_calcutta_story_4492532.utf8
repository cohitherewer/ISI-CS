 Pump fuels empowerment

 - All-woman facility overcomes hurdles, shines in success

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Kajal Banga was a national champ in boxing and karate. Now, she works as a security guard at a petrol pump. Her father died last year, leaving her to take care of her mother and two younger brothers. 

 But the pump, at 1B Alipore Road, is no ordinary one. From March 15 last year, it became the only one in eastern India to be run entirely by women. And for Kajal, it?s perhaps a stepping stone to a better life.

 In celebration of the pump?s first anniversary on Tuesday, a group of 15 women from the NGO Swayam, which works for women, will perform a play at the pump, on the empowerment of women. For, the women here are all making a mark in their own right.

 Although there has been trouble from the former employees of the pump, all men, and occasional hassles from men who can?t quite stomach the all-woman set up, the success a year later is writ clear on every face.

 Basanti Ray, 27, read the advertisement asking for women wanting to work at the petrol pump last year, and signed up. Her husband?s death meant she had to support herself. She hasn?t regretted her decision. 

 Washing cars, filling petrol, checking air pressure or doing the other myriad things to run the place, is a problem for these women. Even the accountant and manager are women. And of course, the person running the show at the Bharat Petroleum pump is none other than a woman.

 ?I began life with my husband 28 years ago with a petrol pump. He died of leukaemia about five months ago, but I am continuing with my work. I took charge of this pump only because it was all-woman,? says Suksham Singh. ?We trained all the women at my petrol pump in the Kidderpore docks, and they all did so well.?

 Urmila Bhujen, 25, reiterates that ever since she heard about it, she wanted to work in the pump, where she could do everything that a man could. And she enjoys it.

 She is also associated with the NGO Lifeline, through which she got in touch with Swayam. ?Now, I always give the women from Swayam first preference,? she adds. 

 This petrol pump also has the distinction of having an art gallery, where an exhibition of works will be inaugurated on Tuesday. Run by Singh?s daughter Aradhna, Plasma was set up in honour of her father and in aid of child victims of blood disorders.

 Through her art project Hue?n?I, she holds workshops with people, aged from three to 50, when she comes to Calcutta from her university in the US. Then there are works by people like Rahul Chand, 13, a thalassaemia patient, whose twin brother died from the disease. The pieces are priced by the artists themselves. 

 1B, Alipore Road is a celebration of life and the human spirit.

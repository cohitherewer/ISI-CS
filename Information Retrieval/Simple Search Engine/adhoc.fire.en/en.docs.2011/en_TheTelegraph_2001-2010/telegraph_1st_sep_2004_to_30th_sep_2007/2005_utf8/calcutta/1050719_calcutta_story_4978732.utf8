 A rare legacy of records

 Kumari puja as part of the Saborno Ray Chaudhury Durga puja rituals

 The ?first family? of Calcutta ? which owned the land that the East India Company took on lease in 1698 to set up its trading outpost, and instituted what is widely believed to be the first Durga puja in the city in 1610 ? now wants to share its legacy with those who have a passion for things past.

 ?We set up The Saborno Sangrahalaya in 1999 to highlight our family?s contribution to the history of the city and dispel misconceptions about its foundation day. But after winning a legal suit in 2003 and setting the record straight, our aims have changed,? says Probal Ray Chaudhury, the 25-year-old scion of the eldest wing of the Saborno Ray Chaudhury family.

 The Saborno Sangrahalaya, which is now a registered society, is seen as a ?hall of collections, library, archive, publication unit and research institute?. It has an accessioned strength of 399 books and six manuscripts. A few other books are being restored. Of these, 54 are classified as rare.

 ?We have palm leaf manuscripts of Bidyapati?s Durga Bhakti Tarangini, which from the lipikar (writer)?s autograph can be dated around 1767-68,? says Probal.

 There are also two Krishnapuja Paddhwati manuscripts, one based on the loukik method and the other tantrik. These and the other manuscripts cannot be dated, as the vital last page containing the lipikar?s autograph is missing. There is also a treasure of pre-Independence coins.

 The Sangrahalaya, says Probal, should develop into a full-fledged research institute. It already has two publications to its name ? Lakshmikanta, based on the life of the family?s founder Lakshmikanta Majumdar, who got the title from Emperor Akbar?s general Raja Man Singh, and Bara Bari, detailing the history of the family?s eldest wing. In fact, the Sangrahalaya was set up with profits from the sale of Lakshmikanta.

 The next publication is Bangadeshe Saradotsav. ?Earlier, we had planned the book around our contribution to Durga puja in Bengal. But if we confine ourselves to the family, we cannot grow as an academic institution. So, the book will include other aspects as well.?

 A book on advanced Sanskrit grammar and a compilation of the Sanskrit text and a translation of Durga Bhakti Tarangini have also been commissioned. ?We want to reprint other works on social history, too.?

 Membership has been opened to people outside the family but a firm cap is being kept on the numbers for now. ?Researchers and members of the public can avail of the facility on permission,? assures Probal.

 Fake lawyers unfettered

 - Sleuths slow to net other accused in marksheet scam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four months have elapsed and the detective department (DD) is yet to take any action against the lawyers practising with counterfeit Ll.B certificates. Taking advantage of the situation, the lawyers, whose case is being handled by the DD, are duping people by using their fake degrees.

 ?We have everything required for an investigating agency to arrest an offender. Complaints were lodged with Hare Street police station against eight lawyers four months ago. The bar council has confirmed that their certificates were fake. Why the DD is taking so long to take action against the accused is incomprehensible,? said a police officer, who had worked on the case before it was handed over to the DD.

 Asked what caused the delay, Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (I) DD, said his officers will take action against the accused, but refused to elaborate.

 Four months ago, a list with the names of 20 lawyers was handed over to the DD. 

 ?During preliminary investigation, we found that the certificates of eight lawyers were fake,? said an officer of Hare Street police station.

 He added: ?We have stopped working ever since the DD took over. We had completed the investigation, and had evidence to prove that the certificates of the eight accused lawyers were fake. The only job left for the DD was to arrest the accused. But, to date, no action has been taken.?

 While expressing his concern over the delay, a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters said: ?Had we arrested the eight lawyers whose names were mentioned in the FIRs four months ago, the rest of the accused would have been behind bars by now. They might have disclosed the names of others and we could have arrested them.?

 The names of lawyers holding fake Ll.B certificates came to light while officers of Jorasanko police station were probing a marksheet racket. 

 ?We arrested a youth on the charges of trading in fake marksheets in Bihar and Jharkhand. He disclosed the names of lawyers who he supplied with fake Ll.B certificates. We shared all the information with the DD,? said an officer of Jorasanko thana.

 Hare Street and Jorasanko police stations discovered that hundreds of lawyers in and around the city were practising with fake certificates.

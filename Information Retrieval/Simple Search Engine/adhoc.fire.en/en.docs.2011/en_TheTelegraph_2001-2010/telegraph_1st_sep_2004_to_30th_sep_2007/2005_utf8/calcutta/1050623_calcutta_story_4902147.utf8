The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tour tuned to nature

 - SEMINAR FOCUS ON ECO-TRAVEL

 Ecological balance: environment-friendly tourism in the Sunderbans

 Tourism is good for the country, but only so long as it retains the natural beauty, heritage and ecological balance of the region. That was the focus at a talks table on eco-tourism on Wednesday. The audience comprised government officials, travel agents and tour operators from West Bengal. 

 ?There hasn?t been a seminar like this in Calcutta for a long time. It?s the right time to address this issue,? said Sudhir Sahi, UNDP national consultant (tourism project), New Delhi, who spoke on rural tourism. ?It?s about management. You might have the best of intentions, but it needs to be regularly monitored. The resources on this planet are finite. The key is in finding the balance between plundering it and completely restricting its use.?

 The sessions included presentations on wildlife tourism by Sarath Chandra, chief naturalist, Jungles Lodges and Resorts, Karnataka, and a study of the Thenmala eco-tourism project by Mohan Lal, director, eco-tourism, government of Kerala. A talk on responsible tourism was delivered by Mandip Singh Soin, managing director, IDEX expedition, New Delhi, and chairman, environment, eco-tourism and heritage committee, PATA India chapter.

 ?Tourism in the Sunderbans is picking up very fast,? Pradeep Vyas, IFS, field director, Sunderbans Tiger Reserve, told Metro. ?It has very high potential. Five years ago, the number of visitors was 24,000 a year. In 2004, there were 58,000. But there are negatives like inadequate infrastructure and positives like revenue. The negative aspects have to be neutralised. The government team conducting the tiger census has rated the Sunderbans as one of the best tiger reserves. The main reason we are able to maintain that is nature itself. Because of the tougher conditions, humans are not able to do what they want. Also, the joint forest management programme has worked with local communities.?

 He added that the eco-tourism project of the Sahara group has been stalled and environmental studies are being done. ?I don?t think the project will continue or be completed. Development is good, but it must stick to the rules. They are not going to be allowed things that others are not.?

 Speaking on beach tourism was Samit Sawhny, managing director, Barefoot India Resort, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. ?Although damage to tourism infrastructure in the Andamans by the tsunami was almost zero, tourists are staying away. The peak period is December-April. This year, about 90 per cent of the numbers didn?t turn up. By next year, I think there will be a resurgence. The government is coming out with print and television ads. On our part, we will organise events early next year to bring back the tourists,? he said.

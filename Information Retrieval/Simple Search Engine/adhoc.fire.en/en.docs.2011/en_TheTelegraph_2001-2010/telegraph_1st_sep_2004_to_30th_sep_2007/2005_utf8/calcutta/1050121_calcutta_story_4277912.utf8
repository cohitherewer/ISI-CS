 SOUMITRA DAS

 One of the original prints by Guenter Grass on display at Max Mueller Bhavan

 J.P. Losty, in his book, Calcutta: City of Palaces, published on the occasion of the tercentenary of the city, had written: ?His own epithet of ?The City of Dreadful Night? is now more famous, but what made it so dreadful to Kipling, that is, Eurasian whores in the back-streets of the Indian city, is a reflection on his philosophy of imperialism, and not on the city itself.?

 There can be no doubt that Guenter Grass, who last visited the city two decades ago, and is due back this Sunday, did not share this philosophy. But there can also be no doubt that the German writer and artist, too, would have nothing against using the same epithet for Calcutta, though for entirely different reasons.

 It is known that Grass? views on the city, which, he has admitted in the past, had changed him radically, and had served to open his eyes to the sufferings and miseries of the world, were not welcomed by Calcutta?s intelligentsia. For him, it is a city where dire and very visible poverty ?collides? with pockets of enormous wealth. Grass? may be considered a very despairing, unsparing and uncompromising view, unrelieved by the comforts that romanticism, religion or poetry may afford. Naturally, comments such as ?I felt disgusted by the indifference of the burgeoning middle class?, were not meant to make his readers happy.

 Before his arrival, Max Mueller Bhavan has put up an exhibition of his original etchings and lithographs based on Grass? vision of a city of dreadful night. Despite his well-publicised prints of The Flounder, that are in the great tradition of the splendid prints of Albrecht Duerer such as the famous one of the Hare, few are aware that Grass, long before he turned to writing, was trained as an artist and sculptor. He has said: ??I regard drawing, graphic and sculpture as another corrective endeavour, as a medium of control revealing to me the limitations of the written word.? In fact, Grass also used to play the washboard in a jazz band.

 The prints, supplemented by a fine display of Grass? work in other media, are in keeping with what he had written in 1988 in Show your Tongue, that depicted the goddess Kali as a hag shamed by the sight of destruction.

 This Calcutta is far from the shopping malls, flyovers and food courts which, we hear, have made the city a more livable place. Grass must have visited the Beleghata canal to conjure up this hellish vision of thousands of people who make a living out of recycling garbage and offal in the company of crows, and spend nights on pavements ? sights that should be familiar to anybody who would care to notice. Hope deserts those who enter this hinterland.

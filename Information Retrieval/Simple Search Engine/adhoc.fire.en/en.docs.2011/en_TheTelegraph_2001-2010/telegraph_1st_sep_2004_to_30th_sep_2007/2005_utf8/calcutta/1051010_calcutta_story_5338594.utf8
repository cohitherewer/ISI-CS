 GeNext drums beat dirge for dhakis 

 - ?MASTI? SCORES OVER PIETY

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 With youngsters opting for remixes and film songs at pandals, the drumbeats of the traditional dhakis are on their way out at city pujas. Instead, teams of kara-nakaras, who play on a set of smaller drums, have found favour with many organisers this year.

 ?We have been hiring kara-nakaras since last year, mainly to cater to the taste of the geNext in our para. Though low on melody, kara-nakaras are better at recreating remixes and film tunes,? pointed out Monoranjan Gayen of Anandagar Puja Committee of Belghoria, as he negotiated on the fee with a team of kara-nakaras on the Sealdah station premises on Sunday.

 Gayen is not an exception. Members of many other puja committees, like Chaltabagan Sarbojanin in north Calcutta and Janbazar Puja Committee in central Calcutta, have picked ?masti over the piety? and hired kara-nakaras from Sealdah this year.

 Such has been the demand for kara-nakaras that a huge chunk of traditional dhakis has switched to playing on the instrument. 

 ?Last year, I was amazed to see the growing demand for kara-nakaras. Therefore, this time I have come to the city with a set of kara-nakara drums. I have left behind my plumed dhak at home,? said Prasanta Das, a farmer from Raina, in Burdwan, who has been playing at pujas in the city for the past 20 years.

 He added that several others of his village have also taken to kara-nakaras.

 ?We realised that it would be difficult to get puja organisers to hire us this year. So, we learnt to play the small drums to the tune of film songs. However, these drums lack the piety associated with Durga puja,? rued Abani Mondal from Memari, in Burdwan. 

 Also, it takes more patience and skill to play the traditional dhak, he pointed out.

 The original kara-nakara players, however, are undeterred by the criticism. ?It is true that this is cheap entertainment. But this is our part-time job, mainly to earn extra money. The aesthetic value of the pujas is the last thing on our minds,? said Manoj Das, who came from Bongaon, in North 24-Parganas.

 An official count of traditional dhakis who have switched to playing kara-nakaras was unavailable. 

 However, policemen at Sealdah station, who have a rough estimate of the number of dhakis who play on the station premises to attract Puja organisers, said a majority of the 1,200-odd dhakis this year have evolved into kara-nakara players to find takers.

 According to puja organisers, an experienced dhaki charges nearly Rs 1,200 per day, while an entire team of kara-nakaras can be hired for Rs 4,000. A kara-nakara team usually comprises three drummers, with two others at the cymbals.

 An annual graduating show displaying the creative talent of a young bunch of students set to define at least some fashion trends in the near future ? thats Tomorrow Makers 2005. The show presented by NiFD of Lindsay Street, in association with the The Telegraph Metro, will be hosted by The Tea Lawn of Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) on December 15.

 The choreographer for the fashion show will be model-turned-event director and fashion choreographer Marc Robinson. The ramp will be ruled by leading models like Jesse Randhawa, Indrani Dasgupta, Deepti Gujral, Amrita Thapar, Niharika Singh and Pawan Satpal, along with city names Sreshthaa, Tina and Neeraj.

 They would all flaunt the creative collections of 130 final-year students from the fashion and textile design departments of NiFD.

 Marc, who loves the city because of its warmth and vibrancy, seems pretty impressed with the budding designers. They have played a lot with colour and the collection is original and inspirational. The students are a talented bunch; meeting the right kind of people, the right attitude and proper marketing will definitely take them a long way, says the man busy with the rehearsals at NiFD on Wednesday.

 The 30 sequences will include themes and moods of sportswear, lounge wear, evening wear, Indo-Westerns, saris, winter wear and ethnics. The clothes are a fine blend of fashion and wearability, adds Marc.

 The student show will be followed by fashion sequences from Susan Mantosh, director of the institute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Big show, little flow

 Star Wars fans at a Hong Kong premiere of Revenge of the Sith

 It was a rare opportunity for aspiring Jedis in the city to catch a glimpse of the final instalment of the saga that began in a galaxy far, far away. That too much before their fellow-Jedis could, in other parts of the world, including Lucas-land where queues had formed for weeks outside theatres. 

 But the turnout at the premiere of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith at INOX (City Centre) on Thursday night was enough to make any Padawan (young Jedi apprentice) want to hop over to the dark side in frustration. There was no descent of the celeb brigade babbling about how ?amazing? a movie it is, and then admitting they have not seen the other ?parts?. But that?s about all there was to the positives.

 Somehow, the parents of Calcutta had surmised that it would be an ideal weeknight outing for the kids, much like a Finding Nemo or a 101 Dalmatians. There were babies and kids of all shapes and sizes, from a few months old to teens. But unfortunately, it wasn?t a film for kids ? never has been.

 There was no paraphernalia in sight, not even a single fan wearing a Star Wars T-shirt or carrying a home-made lightsabre. And for the most part of the screening, the hall remained quite empty.

 The magic on-screen began from the opening shot of Obi-Wan-Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker zipping through a fierce galactic battle in their spaceships. The assault of the special effects was relentless for the rest of the movie ? be it the digitally created giant lizard or the dog-faced General Grievous, the spectacular lightsabre duels to sweeping scenes of alien cities etched in the minutest detail.

 The high point, of course, was the climax when good and evil fought for supremacy (giving away more would be a crime for those who haven?t seen it yet). Acting has never been the strong point of the Star Wars saga, but Episode III tries hard with commendable performances by Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman.

 Now that the film has officially opened in theatres, perhaps the turnout will be better. In the US, over 2,000 special midnight shows managed to earn more than $16 million at the box-office.

 For Star Wars first-timers at INOX, the highlight was certainly the special effects. Ten-year-old Shikha Surana was simply blown away: ?It was fantastic and I loved it, even though I have not seen the other movies.?

 According to percussionist and actor Bikram Ghosh, a screen bigger than 70 mm is needed to do justice to Lucas?s digital effects. ?I also realised that when it comes to special effects, how far behind we still are.?

 Salt Lake skirts no-plastic congress 

 JAYANTA BASU

 The authorities may be desperate to shed the tag of ?one of the dirtiest? townships that Salt Lake has earned for itself, but given the level of participation at a seminar on plastic waste management, the label is going to stay for a long time.

 The meeting on Sunday morning was organised by NGO Endeavour and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board at Bidhannagar College.

 The objective was to make people aware of the plastic menace and finalise the blueprint of a pilot plastic waste management project, which will be launched in a ward along with the Indian Plastics Association.

 The invitees were the residents, including the councillors of all 23 wards, and around 30 representatives of various block committees. 

 ?But only 25, including a couple of councillors and a few block representatives, turned up,? said an organiser, frustrated at the turnout.

 The pathetic state of solid waste management in the township ? which produces around 80 tonnes of waste daily ? had once prompted municipal affairs and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya to dub Salt Lake, the development showpiece of the state government, as ?one of the dirtiest? habitations in the state.

 The meeting, however, saw exchange of interesting ideas ? ranging from a ban on production of plastic carrybags of width below 20 microns to declaring Banabitan, the lungs of the township, a ?plastic carrybag-free zone?.

 Pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee said the key to success in solid waste management lies in ?people?s awareness, participation and understanding of the problem?. 

 ?There may be laws, but neither the municipality nor the board can achieve success without the people changing their habit,? Banerjee observed. 

 The proposal of turning Banabitan into a plastic-free zone, like the Victoria Memorial premises, will be seriously considered, he added.

 However, though the speakers stressed the need to clean up the city, few offered any concrete suggestion.

 Civic vice-chairman Sudhangsu Sekhar Ganguly admitted that even members of his ward committee were not interested in the issue. 

 ?What can we do if people throw garbage any time anywhere?? Ganguly asked.

 Salt Lake?s sub-divisional officer Sutanu Kar, who has been holding awareness meetings for the past few months, said ?littering in vacant plots is a serious problem?. 

 Talking about the availability of banned plastic carry bags in shops, Arup Poddar, a local resident, complained that ?once the pressure from the administration slackens, shop-owners revert to plastic carrybags, as they are cheaper than paper bags?.

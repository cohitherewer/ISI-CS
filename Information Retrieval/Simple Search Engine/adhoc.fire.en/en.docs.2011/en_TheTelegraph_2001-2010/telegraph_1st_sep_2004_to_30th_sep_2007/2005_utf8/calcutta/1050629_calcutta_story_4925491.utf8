 Hit-and-run sparks fury

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Trouble broke out on Taratala Road early on Tuesday after a middle-aged, unidentified cyclist was run over and killed by a car.

 A mob gathered at the spot after the accident and threatened to burn down passing vehicles. A police patrol intervened and managed to stop the local residents from setting vehicles afire.

 The accident took place around 8.15 am, when a Maruti Omni, overtaking a truck moving at high speed, hit the cyclist as he was crossing the road. According to witnesses, the car lost control and ran over the cyclist, who had nearly reached the other side. 

 ?Sensing danger, the cyclist tried to move out of the car?s path, but could do little before he was hit from behind. The driver would have otherwise rammed into the side of the truck,? said Md Kutubuddin, a vendor and a witness.

 The cyclist was taken to SSKM Hospital, where the doctors pronounced him ?brought dead?.

 ?He had suffered multiple injuries on his head and back. The spine was considerably damaged. There was nothing we could have done,? said an attending doctor.

 At the accident site, the bystanders managed to stop both vehicles from escaping. The driver of the truck was pulled out and taken to a local club, where he was beaten up. The driver of the car managed to flee, leaving the vehicle behind.

 ?We were shaken by the accident. The driver seized the opportunity to escape,? added Kutubuddin. 

 A large team from Taratala police station arrived on the scene soon after the accident and arrested the truck driver.

 ?We had sent officers to the residence of the car driver, but he didn?t go there. He will be arrested sooner or later,? said an officer of the police station. 

 Other police stations have been asked to report any missing diary resembling the victim.

 Local residents briefly put up a roadblock in the area. It was lifted after police intervened. Residents alleged a spurt in road accidents due to police inaction. They demanded that police be more proactive. 

 ?There aren?t enough policemen manning the area. Only proper patrolling can curb such accidents. Action should be taken against vehicles speeding on busy roads,? said Ramesh Majumdar, a local resident.

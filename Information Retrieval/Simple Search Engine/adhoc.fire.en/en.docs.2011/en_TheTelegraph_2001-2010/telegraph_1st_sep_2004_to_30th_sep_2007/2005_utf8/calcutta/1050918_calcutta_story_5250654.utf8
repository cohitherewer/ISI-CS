The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Be in touch with life

 Our return flight was not due to take off until well after mid-day. We decided to take in a bit of sightseeing. We stopped in a roadside dhaba for breakfast. As we entered, we heard a lot of music. A man was playing his violin. The waiters sat around him. They were all clapping to the beat of the title song of Dhoom. We walked past them into an open terrace and settled comfortably around a table.

 The violin player came out into the terrace. He played for the next one hour. He switched from current hits to lilting Rafis and soul-stirring Kishores, nostalgic Hemantas and heart-wrenching Mukeshes. The setting was perfect. Hills covered with dense trees were lovingly watching their daughter going through the first few steps of her adult life. Teesta had just broken away from her parental shackles. The music matched our mood. We did not move. He did not stop.

 All four of us, his target group, were long past our 20s. He had caught on. When we got out of our trance, we tipped him generously. The trip down our memory lane was worth much more to us.

 A few days after I returned from this trip, I went for a movie and then for dinner. I wanted to place my order but realised that I had left my reading glasses in the car. I was wondering what to do when a notice caught my eye: ?New on our menu: reading glasses, sewing kit, lens solution. At Oh! Calcutta, we believe nothing should come in the way of your dining pleasure. That?s why we have available for you reading glasses in a range of powers, sewing kit, contact lens solution, safety pins, ear buds, band aids, sanitary napkins.? I ordered my dinner with my eyes open.

 The final incident of this trilogy happened soon afterwards. Another business trip started with the usual last-minute rush from office to Howrah station. I had to catch the late-afternoon Express. I barely managed to get onto the train. I then realised that I was thirsty and badly needed a cup of tea. I also wanted something to eat; I had missed my lunch. The man in charge of the compartment offered me a bed sheet, a pillow and a blanket, instead. He informed me that this train did not have a pantry car. It did not stop at any station in the interim. And as a matter of policy, vendors were not allowed to enter the hallowed precincts of the AC-I compartment. I had all of two-and-a-half hours to kill with thirst and hunger for company. Indian Railways could not care less.

 The consumer experiences were palpably different. A common refrain is that Indian Railways being government-run is not expected to be as consumer-savvy as a premier eating address of a big city. The explanation perhaps skirts the issue. The real issue probably is the fear of losing custom. The railways ? Air Deccans notwithstanding ? perhaps do not fear competition. Others like the violin player depend on their performance to get them their next meal. The stakes are different. That morning in the foothills of Himalayas, he took pains to guess the kind of music we would enjoy and played it to the best of his ability. He had to be sensitive.

 From the old lady selling vegetables in Lake Market to the big chief of Unilever, everyone needs to rely on the doctrine of marketing. Yet some follow it religiously while others are less than sympathetic. The answer lies in a simple truth. Marketing works best when it is in touch with life. Especially, when your life depends on it.

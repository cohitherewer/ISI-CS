 Designer Suman Agarwal displayed her festive collection at Middleton Chambers recently. A play of bright colours, sequins and brocade apart, the clothes were tied by a definite theme ? boho-chic.

 The boho-chic look is huge all over and I have tried to incorporate this gypsy feel in my range of salwar kurtas, saris and lehngas, says Suman. 

 Highlights of the line were striking motifs placed rather unusually, patches of kalamkari combined with tissue, printed crepe inners and intricate texturisation.

 After working on the basic yardage with kantha, pleats, threadwork, machine embroidery or pin-tucks, I begin designing the ensemble afresh, reveals Suman. 

 The colour palette had a definite story, too. Generous doses of turquoise and red were toned down with ivory and beige.

 Moving out from the coin phase, Suman has emphasised stones and mirrors in her latest collection.

 From a modest friendly exhibition seven years ago, Suman has indeed come a long way. 

Gold glitter

 In keeping with the flavour of the season, Simran Jewellery House on BB Ganguly Street launched a new collection of designer gold ornaments. It boasts some Italian designs and light-weight pieces from Singapore. 

 We have been dealing in gold jewellery for a very long time and this time we have ventured into a designer range, too, says Suren Roy of Simran Jewellery House.

 Customers are given a free gold coin with purchases above Rs 15,000 and silver ones that come with purchases above Rs 3,000. We are also offering discounts on making charges and a scratch card that can win buyers exciting prizes, adds Roy. The offers are on till November 1.

 Tot trends

 Kids have a new fashion address in town. Lilliput, from the house of Anand Childrenwear, pulled up its shutters at The Enclave in Alipore recently.

 There is no underestimating the little ones when it comes to keeping up with fashion trends. The store gives them an opportunity to indulge in a world of their own. Apart from quality and comfort, the collection is on a par with international trends, claims Manjari Almal, co-owner of Lilliput.

 The clothes are available in three sections ? infants, toddlers (nine months to three years) and kids (three to 11 years). Available in a variety of fabrics like denim, corduroy and cotton, one can spot cool casuals, gorgeous party dresses and also traditional gear. Prices start at Rs 295.

 Theres more to the style story. Accessories and coordinated shoes are also on offer. 

 To-be moms can choose from a wide range of trendy maternity wear thats high on comfort.

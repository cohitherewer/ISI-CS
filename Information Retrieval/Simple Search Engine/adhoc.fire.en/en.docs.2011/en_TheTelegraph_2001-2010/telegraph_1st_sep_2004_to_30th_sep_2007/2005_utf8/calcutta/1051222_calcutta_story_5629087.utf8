 Audiophiles have a new address to head for with Bose Corporation laun-ching its retail operations in town with a 1,000 sq-ft showroom in City Centre on Wednesday.

 Bose now has a presence in all the metros and Ahmedabad. Why did the Calcutta store ? the 10th in the country ? take so long? We were not being able to get the right space, said Ratish Pandey, general manager, Bose Corporation. Now that it has managed to find suitable space, the company is planning to add three to four stores in the city and the suburbs in the next 18 months.

 Nationally, Bose plans to double store count over the next two years.

 The Salt Lake stop is an experience outlet, offering the Bose line of home segment products. 

 We are also looking at a store in the heart of the city with a listening room, Pandey said. 

 The audio solutions ? including the Lifestyle series and the 321 family of home entertainment systems ? are priced between Rs 7,900 and Rs 2.29 lakh.

 We have observed that Calcutta has buyers in all price bands and we are betting big on the city. The idea is to focus more on mind share than market share for the moment, Pandey explained. 

 The company has till now been selling directly to the consumer through its website and a toll-free number.

 Though the grey market continues to thrive, the company feels it will soon die a natural death. With duties and other costs coming down, we are already offering the products cheaper than Australia and Europe. Our direct-to-customer model also helps us pass on the savings on margins to the buyer, Pandey said.

 Bose currently has no manufacturing plans in India. We have five manufacturing facilities in the US, Mexico and Ireland. We will only think of manufacturing here if the volume from India and the neighbouring countries demand that, Pandey explained.

 Bose, he added, is one of the top three players in the Rs 200-crore high-end audio market in the country, with Onkyo and Bang amp; Olufsen being the other two.

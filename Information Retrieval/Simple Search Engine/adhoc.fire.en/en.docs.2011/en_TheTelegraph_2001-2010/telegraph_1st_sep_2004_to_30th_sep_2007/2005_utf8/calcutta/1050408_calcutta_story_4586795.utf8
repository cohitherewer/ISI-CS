 Three-in-one fun at stadium

SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 The Stadel entrance promises good times 

Name: The Stadel

Address: Gate number three, Salt Lake Stadium

Age: Turns three, on April 14

 Born under the ramparts of the stadium, the boutique hotel is growing. And how. To raise a toast to itself on its second anniversary, The Stadel has lined up a host of events, starting April 9. ?Since our foundation day coincides with the Bengali New Year?s Day, we want to give the Poila Baisakh flavour to all the programmes,? director Anil Bhutoria explains.

 On Saturday, the week-long festivities will be flagged off by danseuse Tanushree Shankar. She will open Punna Annapurna, a finishing school with the accent on cookery and health.

 Grooming experts like chef Narayan Chatterjee, public relations expert Rita Bhimani, health club consultant Preetom Roy Mukherjee and bar consultant Irfan Ahmed will take participants through four hours of the EFG of cooking, nutrition, table manners, conversation skills and mocktail tips once a month. EFG ? in Stadel coinage ? stands for efficiency, food fashioning and gourmandising.

 On Sunday, Studio Bodyart will be inaugurated with a complete package of aerobics, yoga and cardio kickboxing. 

 The Spring Carnival starts on April 13. Special buffets will be laid out in First Innings, the multicuisine restaurant, and Heka, the lounge bar. 

 At First Innings, the Rs 375-worth Polanno spread will start off with Koraishutir Kochuri, progress with Begun Shorshe, Chhanar Dalna, Sorshe Ilish, Chingri Bhapa, Pona Machher Polau and end after another 10-12 other dishes with Aam Pora Sharbat and a swig of draught beer to wash it down. Add some big-screen cricket to the culinary excitement if you happen to drop in on the days of the Indo-Pak ODIs.

 Snacks at Heka too will go Bengali, with Masala Makha Chingri, Kasa Liver Fry, Bhetki Machher Chop, to name a mouth-watering few.

 Adding to the ambience will be handicraft display, live performance by a Bangla band, tarot card reading, mimicry and portrait-painting in the lobby. With puzzles and games on the house, kids will have a plateful too.

 The finale will be the Kingfisher Sunday Night Bazaar on April 17 ? a variety of chaat for the palate and a carnival for good cheer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Airline plans a pull-out

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 After 18 years of operations from Calcutta, Royal Jordanian Airlines is thinking of beating a retreat from the city.

 While airline officials remained tight-lipped, sources in the aviation industry on Wednesday said Royal Jordanian is likely to shut shop in the city from April 2006. The reason for retreat: poor traffic.

 According to insiders, the last Royal Jordanian plane will fly out of Calcutta on March 28.

 ?The airline has verbally asked travel agents not to accept bookings after March. Its schedule from April 2006 doesn?t figure on the computerised reservation system. Which means, even if you want to book a ticket, the system won?t allow you to,? said a Calcutta-based travel agent.

 John Crizzle, area manager (eastern and western India) Royal Jordanian Airlines, conceded that the schedule from April to October is not available to travel agents.

 ?It?s true that our summer schedule is not accessible for computerised reservation. However, I can?t comment on why this has happened,? he said.

 In October 2004, Royal Brunei Airlines had flown out of the city, saying it would be back in six months, but hasn?t returned. The latest development is a setback for the tourism sector, observed an industry veteran.

 ?We?ve heard that the airline is pulling out of Calcutta. We?re writing to the chief minister, seeking his intervention in the matter. This will send wrong signals to the other airlines that are thinking of starting operations in the city,? pointed out Alka Rathi, chairperson, Travel Agents Association of India (eastern region).

 Some believe that the decision is ill-timed. ?It seems to be a wrong move on their part. This is not the right time to leave. So many foreign airlines are thinking of coming to Calcutta,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Hussain Hamoudeh, regional manager (India), Royal Jordanian Airlines, also refused to confirm the pull-out.

 ?All I can say at the moment is that we?re studying the routes and trying to figure out non-feasible ones. It?s too early to comment. We cannot disseminate any information to the media right now,? Hamoudeh told Metro over phone from Delhi.

 ATM guard flicks a card

 - Pin noted, Rs 28,000 drawn out of customer?s account

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Arup Dasgupta did not realise why the security guard would try to be so friendly each time he entered the ATM counter. The day he did, it was too late ? the friendly ATM guard had withdrawn over Rs 28,000 from Dasgupta?s bank account.

 Security guard Santanu Sardar?s luck finally ran out on Wednesday when the police caught up with him while he was fleeing the city.

 About a week ago, Dasgupta, who frequents the Bank of India ATM counter at Jodhpur Park, decided to drop in for some urgent cash withdrawal.

 Like every other day, Sardar smiled at him, welcomed him in and struck up a conversation. Distracted while withdrawing the money and also talking to the guard, Dasgupta did not realise that Sardar was actually taking note of the transaction, secret pin number and all.

 Dasgupta then rushed out, leaving his ATM card behind. ?On reaching home, I started looking around for the card. First, I thought I had dropped it on the way and headed back for the ATM counter,? Dasgupta told police.

 At the Jodhpur Park counter, Sardar seemed far less enthusiastic about seeing him. But with no sign of his card there and the guard not even figuring on his list of suspects, Dasgupta left the ATM counter to call the bank and ask them to block all transactions.

 ?To my horror, I was told that someone had already withdrawn over Rs 28,100 from my account. I was stunned,? said Dasgupta.

 Once Dasgupta lodged a complaint, police reconstructed the event and decided to grill Sardar, who was ready to leave his house in Baruipur. 

 ?He seemed in a hurry when we caught up with him. He was immediately brought to the police station,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (south). During questioning, Sardar started giving inconsistent statements and then spilled the beans.

 ?Sardar told us how he had deliberately engaged Dasgupta in a conversation. He had taken note of the pin number standing behind Dasgupta, while he made the transaction,? added Sharma.

 When Dasgupta dropped the ATM card, Sardar cashed in. ?I was sure that nobody would be able to find out about me, since a person can drop the card anywhere,? Sardar told the cops.

 ?We immediately took him into custody. We are trying to check his antecedents to see whether he has been involved in other such crimes as well,? said Sharma.

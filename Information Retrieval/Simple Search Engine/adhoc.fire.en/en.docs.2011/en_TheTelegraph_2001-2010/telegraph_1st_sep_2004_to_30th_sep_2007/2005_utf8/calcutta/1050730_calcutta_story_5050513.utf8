 Sister duo Priyanka Chandhok and Rotna Dutt have spiced up their store Diva Fashion Ensemble for the coming festive season. Not only do the racks house a fresh collection, the designers have introduced a sari section as well. 

 Situated at 19, Mahanirban Road, opposite Triangular Park, Diva has come a long way since its inception in April 2004. Were both artistic, but in different ways. While my sister concentrates on the motifs and designs, I look into the combination of colours, textures and the styling, says Priyanka. 

 The salwar suits are mostly in linen, with dashes of dupion, cotton, pashmina, crepes and georgettes. These have been worked upon with machine and hand-embroidery. Contrast dupattas and stylised tie-up churidars are paired with the kurtas. 

 Our latest innovation is brocade applique work, adds Priyanka. The suits are priced from Rs 1,150 onwards.

 The store also houses an exclusive Indo-western section, comprising a variety of kurtis, ponchos, trousers and skirts, embellished with stones, tassels and mirror-work. Khari-worked, crushed skirts in cotton and georgette with flat sequins are the high points of the line. The price here starts at Rs 875.

 This is the first time the designer duo has ventured into the sari segment. Weve come up with a wide range of saris that are extremely stylised, with emphasis on the placement of embroidery, explains Priyanka. 

 The opulent line features embroideries like Parsi, Kashmiri and resham work, with splashes of sequins, stones and kundan. The colours used are varied ? from light pastels to bright reds and pinks to deeper shades of blue and purple. The saris are priced between Rs 4,200 and Rs 6,200.

 Bags to match the ensembles can be tailor-made at Rs 850. The store will be hosting an exhibition at the Ice Skating Rink from August 2 to 4.

 Chic coats

 With her collection receiving rave reviews at exhibitions in London and Miami earlier this month, it is celebration time for Calcutta designer Komal Sood. 

 Mughal motifs have been a source of inspiration. The outfits are a fine blend of intricate Indian craftsmanship and international cuts. The response abroad has been very satisfying and I am hoping for the same here, smiles Komal.

 The free-flowing skirts embellished with sequins come in cool splashes of corals, aquamarines, pinks and turquoise. Silk, brocade, matkas, georgettes and chiffons are further enhanced with the crushed finish.

 Kaftans in hues of black, pink, orange, green and coral portray a very Morocco-meets-Rajasthan style, says Komal.

 Brass coins teamed with hand-embellishments, gota and stone adorn the garments. Fashionable belts add funk to the pieces. 

 Long silk coats and jackets are show stealers here. The jackets are given an ethnic edge with intricate aari, kundan, dabka and zardosi work. The more opulent ones are in antique brocade with silk lining and thread work. 

 I have used 15 different kinds of embroideries on the jackets. A lot of Indian brides are going for these coats, adds the designer.

 Keeping in mind the coming festive season, I am planning to launch another collection in September, reveals Komal.

 Season sale

 Its that time of the year again when season-end sales shower you with discounts on everything from clothes to accessories and household products. 

 The end-of-season sale at Pantaloons, a much-awaited time for shoppers, is on at both the Camac Street and Gariahat stores till August 15.

 The discounts range between 10 per cent and 50 per cent, on almost every section ? formal wear, casual wear, denims, cosmetics and groceries.

 On March 13 this year, the Camac Street outlet witnessed a footfall of 34,040. The turnover for the day was more than Rs 10,000,000.

 We were taken by surprise by the phenomenal response to the sale. We are expecting a somewhat similar crowd this time, too, says Suresh Sadhwani, area manager, eastern region, Pantaloons.

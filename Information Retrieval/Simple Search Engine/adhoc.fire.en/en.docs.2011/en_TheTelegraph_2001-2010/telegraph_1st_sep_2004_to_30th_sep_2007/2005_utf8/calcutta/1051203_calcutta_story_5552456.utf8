The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech skill for needy children

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taking technology to the masses, IT education major NIIT and Rotary Club of Calcutta Metro City on Friday launched an initiative to provide computer education to underprivileged children.

 NIIT announced plans of training one child free of cost for every child sponsored by companies and NGOs.

 ?We will match the support provided by private bodies,? said Tulika Sinha, vice-president-India East for NIIT on Friday, also World Computer Literacy Day.

 ?Around 1,000 students in West Bengal should receive the benefits of this programme,? Sinha added.

 NIIT also plans to set up 20 computer literacy kiosks in the rural areas and train 20,000 students for free.

 ?From our side, we would extend support to at least 50 children,? said Shyamasree Sen of Rotary.

 Reverend P.S.P. Raju, bishop, Calcutta Diocese, Churches of North India, kicked off the campaign by signing in support of the computer literacy mission.

 ?We will encourage the children in our schools to help others like them become computer literate,? Raju said.

 NIIT officials also highlighted the company?s hole-in-the-wall programme.

 This involves providing free computer access to streetchildren, through a computer terminal fitted in a wall, and allowing them to learn using the machine on their own.

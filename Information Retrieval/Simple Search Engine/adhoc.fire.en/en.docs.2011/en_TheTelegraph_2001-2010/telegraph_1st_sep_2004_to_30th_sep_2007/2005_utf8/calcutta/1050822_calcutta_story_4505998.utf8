 Small screen success story

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Shalini Kapoor strikes a pose 

 She won a beauty contest in 1995, but modelling was not where her heart was. Shalini Kapoors passion lay in acting and thats what took the Calcutta girl to Mumbai soon after.

 Shalinis dream soon came true by the Arabian Sea as she got to debut under the Raj Sippy banner. She enacted dual roles in Kudrat, starring opposite Akshaye Khanna.

 When I set foot in Mumbai, I thought I would have to start off with bit roles and wait for the right opportunity to come my way. But luck favoured me majorly and I got to debut under such a big banner with a very solid role, says Shalini, in the city recently on a personal visit. 

 Solid role or not, her debut film sank at the box office without a trace. But by then, Shalini had two more roles in her kitty, both with the Sippy banner. She played Akshay Kumars sister in her next release, Sapoot. 

 Though I had initially decided I would only do lead roles, my part in Sapoot was so strong that I couldnt refuse. The role was appreciated and I was satisfied, she adds.

 But then, offers dried up and Shalini all but hit a dead-end on the big screen.

 Enter, the small screen as saviour.

 Here, luck favoured Shalini again as she bagged a role in Zee TVs Dastan.

 Doing Dastan was a great experience, especially since the serial was shot entirely in the Emirates, smiles Shalini. 

 There was no looking back after that and in the past eight years Shalini has acted in more than 25 TV serials.

 She recently walked out of Ekta Kapoors Kkusum, where she was playing the protagonists best friend, Sakshi.

 The reasons were two-fold. Firstly, Balaji Telefilms required me for a block period of 20 days and that was coming in the way of my other commitments.

 Secondly, contrary to the impression I was given, the role had become stagnant. I felt it was not going anywhere. So, I decided to bid adieu to the serial in the best interest of my acting career, explains Shalini. 

 The Calcutta girl is a common face in the Gujarati film industry as well, where she has acted in more than 12 movies.

 She won the best actress award for Pankh Vagar Na Pareva (A Bird Without Wings) in 2004.

 She is also acting in a bilingual Hindi-Bhojpuri film produced by Gopi Mallaya.

 But the lady doesnt want to restrict herself to regional cinema or the small screen. Bollywood is what she has set her sights on once again, but this time shes ready for a compromise.

 I would like to do strong supporting roles now, says Shalini.

 Project prod for railways

 - Govt assures assistance in clearing bottlenecks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has asked the railway authorities to expedite on-going projects in and outside Calcutta, and assured administrative and other assistance in clearing bottlenecks, if any.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb on Tuesday met senior Eastern Railway officials at Writers? Buildings to discuss the pending projects, particularly the construction of the Chitpur terminal and extension of Circular Railway. The officials submitted a status report on the projects.

 The railway ministry is pursuing a string of projects in Bengal, including laying of tracks, electrification, and construction of overbridges and underpasses.

 ?The railway officials pointed out some problems in completing the projects, like release of state funds. I have assured them of help and requested them to speed up work,? the chief secretary said after the meeting.

 While discussing the progress of work at the Chitpur terminal, the officials raised the issue of development of a passenger dispersal system. They tried to convince Deb that it would be meaningless to operate trains from the terminal unless the system was in place.

 ?The railway officials said the Chitpur terminal will be operational within October 2006. We will be able to improve the passenger dispersal system by then,?? Deb asserted.

 In accordance with an understanding with the railway authorities, the state government will shoulder the financial burden of setting up the passenger dispersal system. The work includes construction of roads and flyovers to help commuters reach different parts of the city from the station.

 The railways, besides laying the tracks and constructing the station building, will develop the parking lots, a bus terminus and the sewerage system. It will also provide drinking water and other passenger amenities.

 A war of words had started between the government and the railway over sharing of responsibility for the project. While the government agreed to provide funds to repair roads and build flyovers, it did not want to develop the entire passengers dispersal system on its own.

 Fearing delay, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee intervened in the matter and agreed to provide funds.

 ?We have identified roads by the Circular, Kestopur, Beleghata and New Cut canals, along which passengers can disperse from the terminus. The canal-bank roads will offer access to VIP Road, BT Road, Sealdah station and EM Bypass. Widening and repair of the carriageways will be over in the next six months,? said the chief secretary.

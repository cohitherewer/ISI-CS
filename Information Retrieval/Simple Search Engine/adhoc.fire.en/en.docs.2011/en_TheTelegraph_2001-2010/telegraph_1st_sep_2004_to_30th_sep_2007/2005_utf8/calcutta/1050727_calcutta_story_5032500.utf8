The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Fortune on beam, fate in pocket

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should astrology programmes on television be banned? More responses will be published next week

 Saadia Sitwat,

 Linton Street

 Yes, they should be banned because astrologers only misguide people with their baseless predictions. Ordinary people believe them at their own peril. Immature boys and girls are known to have taken drastic steps believing the nonsense dished out by the fortune-tellers. 

 Anuradha Raza, 

 Darga Road

 Astrology programmes on television should definitely be banned. How can any Tom, Dick and Harry predict our future just by hearing the time and date of our birth? It?s so absurd! Astrologers are mushrooming everywhere these days. They buy timeslots on television channels and mislead people. This business based on hoax must be stopped immediately.

Debashis Saha, 

 Anath Nath Deb Lane

 Obviously. Most private television channels air astrology programmes. These have a harmful effect on people, prompting them to become passive. Astrology has no scientific basis. The only way to success is through hard work, but astrologers make people believe otherwise.

Sandy, 

 Serampore

 People rely on the media as it is believed to guide the public. However, the programmes on astrology aired by television channels distract people from the right path. I wonder how people can allow themselves to be fooled by astrologers. It seems that those who watch the programmes have forgotten that ?man makes his own fortune?.

Debashis Pathak, 

 Sura Cross Lane

 Yes, they should be banned as per the law of the land. Astrologers prescribe stones or metal tablets for getting rid of various problems. The stones or tablets should be regarded as drugs under Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. It is illegal to prescribe drugs publicly without a licence from the government. Moreover, telecast of such programmes may be treated as an offence under the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. How long will innocent citizens be cheated because of inaction on the part of the government?

 Sumit Chakravorty,

 Behala 

 Astrology programmes pose a danger to the masses, especially the superstitious section of the society. Astrologers are good judges of human psychology, and delude people with false promises. Such malignant acts must be peremptorily denounced and banned. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Bandpur

 Astrology is simply a tool of exploitation. It is our heritage from the dark ages. Of late, some people and organisations have been trying to use the electronic media to expand their astrology business. Though the NDA government at the Centre had officially promoted astrology, its practice should not be encouraged. Both the state and Central governments have to find ways to bar astrologers from participating in television programmes. Advertisements of astrological services should not also be carried by the media. 

 Debasish Chakraborty,

 Nilmoni Mitra Row

 As long as people are not entirely happy with their situation, they will look for easy ways to have what they want. Astrology programmes are nothing but ways to spread the name of the astrologer. They should be banned.

Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi regularly consulted renowned astrologers. Yet, they could not avoid being brutally murdered. Given their track records, astrologers should not be allowed to use the medium of television to make fools of people.

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 Astrology programmes are easy ways to cheat the public. Such programmes have a negative effect on youngsters. Nobody has knowledge of the future. Yet people are mislead and even commit suicide on hearing the pronouncements of astrologers. Astrology programmes should definitely be banned as soon as possible to avoid such incidents.

Jyoti Baksi,

 Heysham Row 

 If astrologers really knew how to ensure a happy and trouble-free life, then their clientele would decrease every day. The astrologers feed on the insecurities of people. Mass awareness is necessary to solve the problem for good. The administration should prevent attempts to defraud the public.

 Prasit Sen, 

 Hatiara

 Astrology programmes on television should be completely banned. The astrologers are making money by taking advantage of the idiocy and innocence of common people. People should believe in themselves and shouldn?t depend on astrologers.

Satyen Biswas,

 Pathak Para Road

 I am an astrology adviser for the past 30 years. But astrology is not my profession. The subject is a part of our culture and is based on mathematical calculations. Its practice on television should not be banned.

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

 For want of proper education, even in this age of science, many people have the idea that astrologers can perform miracles and pull them out of trouble. Depending on the astrologers? assurances, such people waste time and money, but fail to get expected results. Unless astrology programmes are banned, they cannot be saved from themselves. However, steps should also be taken to increase public awareness against astrology. 

 Atish Sarkar,

 Belghoria

 Astrology is a simple way to earn a lot of money by cheating people. Its success depends on superstition, which thrives on ignorance. Astrologers affect self-confidence and blunt the will to work. Man could never have built civilisations if he relied entirely on irrational beliefs. We have many statuettes ? including Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act 1954, Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Consumer Protection Act 1986 ? that contain provisions against such programmes. The government should take immediate action against deceitful activity on television and other media.

sAntosh Chakravarty, 

 Unique Park

 Yes. What is presented as astrology on television is merely a platform for frauds and quacks to victimise our vast populace of the uneducated and superstitious. People waste thousands of rupees believing the bunkum of the so-called astrologers. The television programmes need to be banned immediately.

 Sandhya Banerjee, 

 Salt Lake

 Astrology programmes on television should be banned. Astrology is a science based on mathematical calculations. It is not television-friendly. Detailed study is needed before a prediction can be made. Astrologers on television are not thorough, hence their forecasts more often than not turn out to be erroneous. Also, the astrologers often fool viewers by making their accomplices call up during the programmes.

 Vinay Dokania, 

 Howrah

 I do not think that banning astrology programmes will have much of an effect. Viewers have total freedom to watch what they like. If astrology is harmful then they will stop watching such programmes on their own. A lot of serials are also harmful and stupid, but no one talks of banning them.

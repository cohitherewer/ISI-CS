 Artisana: collectors delight

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Artisana, the commercial outlet of The Crafts Council of West Bengal at Chowringhee Terrace (behind Gol Mandir on Elgin Road), is happy hunting ground for collectors and homemakers.

 The second-floor outlet houses hand-crafted pieces from across the country. Works of art that combine utility abound, like dokra from Birbhum fashioned into bookends, or Benarasi weaves that lend a regal touch to cushion covers.

 The best thing about Artisana is its old-world charm, far removed from the usual chic ambience of most modern-day lifestyle stores.

Home wares

 Artisana stocks an impressive collection of home items. The speciality lies more in novelty than variety. Dokra show pieces; kantha patches that can be framed, used on cushions or bedspreads; Madhubani paintings; scrolls of Kalighat pat; and tribal carvings; Purulia masks; buffalo-horn photo frames...

 The filigree work used for silverware including coasters, trays, napkin rings and candlestands is truly stunning.

 Kantha cushion covers in unconventional designs, or kalamkari bedspreads imported from Hyderabad promise to add colour and style to any room. 

 The store also has a rare collection of hand-made English table napkins that are apparently made by missionaries based in Bangalore. The lace work and excellent hand embroidery make them worth stocking for a bridal trousseau. 

Smart wear

 Dokra jewellery from Orissa and dupattas in cotton and silk from across the country are diverse enough to pack in something for the evening out or the job interview.

Six yards of magic from down south in bright colours 

with golden borders share rack space with Dhakai and hajar buti tangail 

from Bengal. There is also a range of jaal jewellery that one can pick 

up for formal occasions. 

Show pieces

 The two-ft tall Ganesha statue in dokra is perfect for a living room corner or centre piece. Dokra wall panels are also rare finds.

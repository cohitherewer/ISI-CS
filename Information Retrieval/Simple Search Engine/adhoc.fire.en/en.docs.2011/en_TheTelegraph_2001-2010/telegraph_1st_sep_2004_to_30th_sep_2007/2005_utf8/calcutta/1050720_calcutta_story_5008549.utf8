 Structural abstractions

 Inspired by nature and life, Saurav Roy Chowdhury presents in his works of art a fascinating combination of realism and imagination that gives them their own distinctive quality. A sculptor who believes in expressing the intrinsic harmony of organic forms, he moulds his creations to give them a feel of artistic fluidity. Deftly making sharp edges and diagonals merge and overlap with smooth curves, his sculptures (Composition; in bronze, picture left) reveal Roy Chowdhury?s excellent sense of balance and control over forms and structures. A selection of his works, on display at the ongoing exhibition of Birla Academy?s award-winning paintings and sculptures, bears testimony to his ability of fashioning objects of pure abstraction with an incredible liveliness and vitality. Often surrealistic in approach, his figures nevertheless articulate emotions to which the common man can relate. Also featuring paintings by Kusumita Bhattacharyya, Apu Dasgupta, Ananta Mandal, Indrajit Nandy and Asim Pal, and sculptures by Rajib Mondol.

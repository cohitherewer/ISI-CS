 Were you there to see and be seen at the Parmita Katkar show at Tantra on Saturday night? Before you say Parmita who, jog your memory to focus on singular item number, Kuan man doob jaoongi, in Madhur Bhandarkars satirical hit on party people, Page 3. 

 Believe it or not, the number has catapulted the babes career, making her the most sought-after party pepper from Calcutta to Chicago. Previously I would travel to places like Delhi and Chennai for stage performances, while now I go to Dallas and Chicago for concerts. This one song has brought me a lot of money and adulation, shared Katkar. 

 Her fame had obviously travelled to Calcutta before her, for the nightclub was choc-a-bloc with revellers well before the stroke of midnight when the lady in question climbed on to the bartop. Besides the Page 3 number, she also performed to songs like Leke pehla pehla pyar, Dhoom machale, Chadhti jawani and Superstar. 

 Starlet turn

 An entry into one of the numerous television shows on air is also a quick path to stardom. Shonali Nagranis (Miss India International 2003) careergraph is a case in point. 

 The Delhi girl who now lives in Mumbai to earn her bread and butter was in Calcutta on Saturday evening to be a part of the fast-growing party circuit of the city. 

 At Virgose, the resto-bar at HHI, she made a rather low-profile entry, soon rocking to the music though and urging others to join her. Sporting a summery green off-shoulder upper and a well-fitted black shirt, she went on to turn quiet a few heads. 

 After the ramp and television stints, Shonali is eyeing films now. I was supposed to do Shamitas role in Zeher, but it didnt work out, she said. Loads of film offers have arrived since, but not quite the right ones.

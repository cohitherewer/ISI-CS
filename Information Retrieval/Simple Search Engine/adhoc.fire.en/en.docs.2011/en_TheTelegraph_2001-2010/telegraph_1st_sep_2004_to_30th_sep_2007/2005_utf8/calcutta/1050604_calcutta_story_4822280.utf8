The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In search of an escape route

 Acomedy full of quips and witty repartees, Ballavpurer Roopkatha exposes in a humorous fashion the pompousness and false grandeur of the erstwhile wealthy landed gentry. The play opens with Bhupati Roy, the proud descendant of such a landowner, deep in debt and trying in vain to elude his creditors. In a desperate bid to save himself from humiliation, he lets out the news that he would sell off his ancestral mansion to repay his debts. His friend, Sanjib, posing as his estate manager, gets hold of a prospective buyer, Mr Halder, who, besides being impressed by the old building, is attracted by its incredibly low price. His daughter expresses an amorous interest for Raghupati, who inhabits the Roy home, to which Mrs Halder strongly objects. Meanwhile, Mr Chaudhury, a rich merchant, also shows a keen interest in purchasing the property. Poised for an interesting climax and, finally, a surprising revelation, the play promises to provide the audience an evening of pure entertainment. Play: Badal Sarkar. Direction: Prakash Bhattacharya.

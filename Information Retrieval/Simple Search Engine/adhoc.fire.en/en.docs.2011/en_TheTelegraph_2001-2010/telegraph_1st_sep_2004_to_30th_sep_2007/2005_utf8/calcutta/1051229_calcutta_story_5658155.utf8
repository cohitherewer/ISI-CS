 State of our greens: Deshapriya Park, both a sports turf and fair venue; (below) An open manhole in the Maidan waiting to gobble up another pedestrian 

 Apropos the report ?Space jam kills pedestrian?, December 10, I was stunned by the death of a young woman, who was accompanying her ailing mother and aged father to a cardiologist, under the wheels of a Trekker. The three were forced off the footpath by Hatibagan hawkers. 

 No word is enough to condemn the callousness of the encroachers. Due to offensive behaviour on their part, many a self-respecting pedestrian is forced to risk life and limb by walking along the narrow carriageway in the Hatibagan area. 

 The tragic incident underscores how insecure law abiding citizens are in Calcutta. They are even deprived of the basic right to walk freely along the pavement. The city bosses responsible for safeguarding the lives of the pedestrians prefer not to interfere in the state of affairs and are content as long as their own careers are furthered. The political leaders, on the other hand, continue to make false promises and only do the things that earn them votes. 

 What makes the incident more poignant is that Sangita decided not to marry so that she could look after her parents all her life. However, the tragedy would be lost on our leaders, who are only concerned with numbers. 

 Unfortunately, it is impossible to tackle the hawker problem without political will. The chief minister, by all accounts, is unhappy with the situation, but he has shown no inclination to disturb the status quo.

 Apropos the report ?Cover thefts organised?, December 1, the chief engineer of the sewerage department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has admitted that 20,000 manholes remain open in Calcutta. But where do the missing covers go? They go to the markets for stolen goods in Sealdah and Bowbazar before making their way back to the civic office, via contractors. The minister for civic affairs only needs to instruct his officials not to buy old and used manhole covers, and conduct raids with the help of police in the stolen goods markets to bust the racket. 

 Abul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Chandbati. 

 Manholes have become death traps due to lack of maintenance by the civic authorities. It is amazing that the only place Calcuttans can go to for a breath of fresh air is dotted with such hidden dangers. The authorities claim to spend Rs 3 crore per year on sewage-related work, but can?t find a solution to the problem of stolen manhole covers. Also, of what use then is the law-and-order machinery?

 The driver of a private bus overtook a car near the intersection of CIT Road-EM Bypass before running over a youth standing on the footpath (Count Three on Day III, December 1). The same story. The same crime. Only the place of the killing changes. As usual the driver of the killer vehicle fled. 

 Of late, drivers of the Calcutta State Transport Corporation have started competing with private buses plying on long route. Strangely, passengers enjoy these death races and encourage rule violation. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Bandpur. 

 Shall we not call the incident the murder of a common citizen? Who should be held accountable for this act? Is the administration and the judiciary at all concerned about the people of Calcutta? 

 Sekhar Chakravarty, 

 Ballygunge Park Road. 

 Apropos the report ?Negligence cry over baby deaths?, December 19, only 0.9 per cent of the budget is allotted for healthcare. This is the fundamental cause for death due to negligence in hospitals. Instead of going after the doctors, we should demand a hike in the allocation. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata. 

 It is shocking how the owner of a driving school beat up an octogenarian and his son for no fault of theirs (Gang of 20 beats up 80-year-old, December 17). Anyone who dares to raise his or her voice against a group invariably has to suffer in our state. 

 Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore. 

 Apropos ?CM targets cop nexus?, December 12, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s exhortations to treat policemen as our friends is unlikely to change the reality much. I recently spent a night at a police station and was witness to their brutality towards the guilty and the innocent alike. The cops used abuses at every turn and did not hesitate to get physical. Such a police force does not befit a civilised city. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur.

 The report ?A loyalty lunch at Sourav?s?, December 17, highlights how illogical and parochial we can be. It is surprising that Sourav?s fans fail to see the erosion in his form and diminishing confidence. On top of everything, he decided to go public with his grievances against the coach. Now he has to endure the humiliation heaped on him by a pack of jackals headed by a wolf. 

 Jatindra Nath Bhowmick,

 Kalyani.

 Apropos the report ?Winter fair is foul for flannels in cradle of cricket?, December 15, the civic body?s decision to hold a fair in Deshapriya Park was unfortunate, as it would not only have damaged the ground but hampered the practice of budding cricketers. It is good that the organisers had better sense. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 It is heartening that a girl suffering from congenital heart disease was saved by the timely intervention of doctors of a private hospital (Hospital staff grant girl a lease of life, December 9). I can?t think of another instance when the staff of a private hospital responded so readily to save the life of a poor patient. The report was a welcome relief from news of critical patients being denied admission in hospitals. A sense of social obligation on part of the doctors is the need of the hour. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Records seal wedding pact?, December 14, it is quite obvious that Mini Kanodia had married Mohit Srivastav. Her family is making a mistake by pressuring her to deny the marriage, which has already been registered. In the process, they are creating a legal mess. Good sense should prevail. 

 Kaushik Guha,

 SN Roy Road.

 Drive to spread voter?s identity card

 Tarun Chowdhury: Why isn?t the coverage of Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) being extended in the state?

 Currently, 92 per cent of the 4.8 crore voters in Bengal have EPIC. From early March, we are undertaking a special programme in each block and select offices in Calcutta to extend the coverage of EPIC. During the two-week programme, voters without EPIC will be photographed.

 Besides, permanent EPIC centres are being opened in each sub-division and at Jessop Building in Calcutta, from January. Those eligible to vote can visit the office before 2 pm and get their EPIC made. We?re targeting 100 per cent coverage, but the last mile is always the longest.

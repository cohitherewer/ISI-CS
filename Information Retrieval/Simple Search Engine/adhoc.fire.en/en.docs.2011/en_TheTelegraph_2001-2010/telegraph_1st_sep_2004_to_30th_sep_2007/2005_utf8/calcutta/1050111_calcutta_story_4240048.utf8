The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dance, but seriously

Drop the microphone and pick up your dancing shoes. 

With Indian Idol inching towards an exciting finish, that?s the message 

from Sony Entertainment Television (SET) with the launch of its new show, Dance 

Dance .

 The concept is simple: display your skills on the dance floor and win the title of India?s Ultimate Dancing Couple. Material gains are in the form of an exclusive contract worth Rs 20 lakh with SET and the chance to feature in a music video.

Premiering on January 14, Dance Dance is the 

Indian version of the Australian dance show Strictly Dancing, which aired 

on ABC Television in early 2004. The national search for the show threw up 64 

couples to compete for the title over 23 weeks.

 Why couples? ?You can dance alone but a lot of movement coordinations and vibes are needed when you?re dancing together,? said a spokesperson for SET. Unlike Indian Idol, this show is not for novices and veterans alike. ?The participants are semi-professionals,? explained the spokesperson.

 The judges? panel features Bollywood veteran Saroj Khan, happening choreographer Vaibhavi Merchant and contemporary dance and jazz exponent Terence Lewis of Naach fame. 

Filmed in front of a live audience and in a nightclub 

setting, the show has the inimitable Jaaved Jafferi (in Boom above) as 

the host. This would be the dance master?s second outing with Sony after the hugely 

popular Boogie Woogie. 

 Jaaved?s company has recently produced its first feature film, a Hinglish venture called Let?s Enjoy, and Dance Dance would see him return to his first love ? dancing.

 On the weekly one-hour show, four contesting couples would shake their booty to folk songs, item numbers, disco tracks, and with props. Besides these four forms, in a theme-based round they would be able to display their individual talents. At the end of each round, the judges are supposed to award an X-Factor score for style and a WOW factor score supposed to separate the superstars from the stars. 

 After the preliminary rounds, like Indian Idol, viewers get to decide the fate of the contestants by voting in and choosing the winners. Celebrity performances, a contest for kids and a live band add to the fun on each episode.

 In a different time-slot than Indian Idol, SET insists there would be no competition between the two shows. ?They are both reality shows but with different formats,? is the word from the channel.

 Live commentary is the other feature on the show. Commentators Gita Kapur and Areez will take viewers through the emotions experienced by contestants and provide a critique of the judges? decisions, apart from informing them about the different dance forms.

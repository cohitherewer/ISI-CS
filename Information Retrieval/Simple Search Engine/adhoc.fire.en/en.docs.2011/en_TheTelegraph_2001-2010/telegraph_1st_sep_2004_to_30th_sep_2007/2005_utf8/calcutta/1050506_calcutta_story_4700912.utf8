The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CalTel maps new course

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) has turned to its broadband service, DataOne, to arrest the slide in its landline subscriber base.

 The success of CellOne, the pre-paid mobile telephone service of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), has made the CalTel authorities hopeful of a repeat with DataOne. 

 ?We have plans to provide 100,000 broadband connections by the end of the year,? S.K. Bhaduri, general manager (customer relations), CalTel, told Metro on Thursday. 

 DataOne currently has around 7,000 subscribers.

 Last year, CalTel lost around 100,000 landline subscribers. Some of them surrendered their connections, while the others were disconnected due to non-payment of dues.

 ?All over the world, landline subscribers are surrendering their connections. However, our broadband service will help us stage a major turnaround,? a senior CalTel official said.

 With bandwidth ranging from 256 kilobits per second to 8 megabits per second, the authorities expect a good response to DataOne. 

 ?The equipment for broadband connectivity has been installed at all the main remote line units. By June, the small exchanges, too, will be covered,? said Somnath Maity, general manager (planning), CalTel. 

 According to him, CalTel is mainly targeting domestic customers. ?Business houses have other options, like leased line access, which are more expensive,? he explained.

 ?Calcutta is more Internet-savvy than many cities and we expect a spurt in broadband demand like in the other metros,? Maity added.

 Officials said though only Internet service is being initially provided through broadband, video and audio on demand will be available later.

 DataOne was rolled out with much fanfare by BSNL in January and is available in 32 cities across the country. 

 Around 175,000 people have applied for DataOne connections, while around 34,000 connections have been provided, officials said.

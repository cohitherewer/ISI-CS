 Ladies night out

 It is no secret that any ladies night organised in the city attracts more men than women. Some, like Shisha do not light their hookahs for men on these occasions, allowing the women to do their own stuff inside the cosy lounge bar. The others, however, believe that more the men the merrier for the women. And everywhere, a ladies night is a good excuse to gatecrash.

 The news of one such night at Big Ben, the pub at The Kenilworth, on Wednesday, spread like wildfire. From 10 pm, normally deemed the kiddies hour, the madness began. The culturatti of Calcutta and their flying kisses, the small screen gang and their big night to be cool, and the fashion shows, yawnfully predictable for some, hot and happening for others?

 The all-action ladies night was part of a bigger plan at Big Ben. The pub witnessed a major slump in 2003. As the city was flooded with chill-out options for the night, even our guests went out to try the newer places. But people have again started coming back and now we would be hosting various events to retain the guests, says a spokesperson for the pub, stressing the importance of value-added services.

 Each day of the week would be dedicated to a particular section like corporate officials, IT executives, doctors and so on. Wednesdays would be booked for women ? a welcome mid-week breather.

 But men need not sulk, for if they step into the Little Russell Street address along with a woman, they can get by without coughing up a staggering cover charge. For every two drinks a lady orders, she would get a complimentary drink, explains the spokesperson.

 And what about the customary fashion show? At least the Wednesday pageant was smartly crafted, keeping in mind the ladies to whom the house belonged. In a reversal of roles (were not talking Salman Khan here), the boys displayed more flesh than the fairer sex.

 The models rode the ramp in creations of designer Sayon Mitra and Komal Sood. A night club is a hotbed of fashion. This is where people meet and exchange their views on the latest in the couture cauldron. That makes a night club the best place to influence people as to what is hot and what is not, says Sayon, displaying a melange of modern and ethnic wear.

 If the fashion sequences were few and far between (only seven), the television troupe upped the glamour quotient. Spotted in the crowd were June, Piu Sarkar, Swastika Mukherjee and Deboleena Dutta? Girls, after all, just wanna have fun.

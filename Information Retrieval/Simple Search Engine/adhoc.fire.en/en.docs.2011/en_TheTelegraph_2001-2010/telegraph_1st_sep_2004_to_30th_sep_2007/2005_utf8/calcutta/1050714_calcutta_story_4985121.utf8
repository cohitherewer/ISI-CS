 Romancing the stones

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 From young brides-to-be to mature 

 homemakers, from trendy teens to corporate jet-setters, 

 stones both precious and semi-precious appeal to all those 

 with an eye for fashion.

 The Saturday Club played host to Romance of the Stones ? an interactive session with Varda Goenka of Diagold Jewels ? on Wednesday morning.

 While models Puja and Tina sashayed 

 in diamonds, emeralds, garnette and much more, Varda narrated 

 interesting anecdotes associated with the gems.

 It is said that the passion for gemstones was born sometime in the 17th century. There are many legends around beauties like Cleopatra, Elizabeth Taylor and Maharani Gayatri Devi and their love for precious stones, said Varda.

 She shared certain interesting facts and myths about gemstones of lore. For instance, she dwelled at length on the famous Hope Diamond, weighing 44.52 carats, that is permanently displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and has a notorious history.

 The blue sapphire, she said, is not considered astrologically favourable for some. However, it has found international stardom ever since Princess Diana sported one on her engagement ring. And the fame was fuelled with the stone playing an important role in the film Titanic, nestled close to Kate Winslets heart. 

 It is said Indira Gandhi wore a blue sapphire and so does Amitabh Bachchan, she added. Sapphires of Kashmir as well as Sri Lanka are known worldwide, explained Varda.

 The session also threw light on the famous Kohinoor, the Taylor-Burton diamond, Star of Africa and a host of other much-talked-about gems.

 The audience lapped up interesting information about birthstones and those associated with love, luck and marriage. They also got some valuable inputs regarding cuts and weights of stones. 

 The models showcased jadau jewellery pieces with both traditional and western wear; earrings with a fine blend of jhumkas and chandeliers; scarves in semi-precious stones worn as neckpieces, as wrist wear and as trendy belts. 

 Style is not what you wear but how well you carry it, smiled Varda.

 Campus turmoil over quit drama

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The careers of over 900 students of Future Institute of Engineering and Management, a private college in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, hang in the balance, with the authorities failing to resolve the stalemate prevailing on campus since last week.

 Trouble started on February 9, after a section of students demanded the removal of three teachers, including the principal, for a large number of failures in mathematics in the second-year examination.

 The West Bengal University of Technology declared the results of the examination that day. Though classes in the management courses resumed on Tuesday, all six engineering departments remained shut.

 ?We hope to resume classes in the next two days,? said institute director Silajit Ghosh. The institute has been on the boil since Thursday, when all 70 faculty members submitted their resignation, protesting the students? demand.

 ?None of the three teachers has taken classes in the past six months. Their neglect in completing the course has resulted in so many failures,? a student alleged.

 The teachers have not been attending college since Friday. They were back on Tuesday and agreed to take classes. But the impasse continued, as the students refused to attend classes and remained firm in their demand for the removal of the three teachers.

 The authorities? stand that the students have to seek an unconditional apology has worsened the situation. ?We will not apologise to the three teachers under any circumstance,? asserted a student spokesperson.

 The students said the principal is related to institute director Ghosh. ?That is why no action has been taken against the principal,? they alleged.

 On Tuesday, a section of the parents threatened to take up the matter with higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty.

 Fruit juice to vie with cola

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Come July and you can savour your favourite fruit juice paying just Rs 10 for a 250-ml PET bottle, while a one-litre bottle of orange, pineapple, mango, litchi or apple juice will come for a pocket pinch of Rs 30 only.

 After a crunchy bite into the biscuit pie, Priya Food Products Limited is now foraying into the fast-track fruit juice and aerated soft beverages market. We want to make the purest quality fruit juice affordable to the average consumer in the city, just like we did with our biscuits, S.N. Agarwalla, managing director, told Goodlife.

 The fruit juices, set to hit the market by the middle of next month under the Priya Yours brand, will be more than 50 per cent cheaper than the existing national brands, promised son Vinay Agarwal, director in Paul Aquamin amp; Food (P) Ltd, owner of the Priya Yours brand.

 Trial production is already on at the small-scale-industry set-up in Rajarhat, and the company is also launching five varieties of aerated soft drinks including nimbu pani, fresh lime soda and ice-cream soda alongside the fruity focus.

 The management is confident it can wrest a substantial slice from the cola giants like we did with Britannia with more than 30 varieties of biscuits and cookies. Sudip Poddar, sales manager, is confident Priya Yours can carve out a 30 per cent market share in the fruit juice segment over the next couple of years.

 An enormous quantity of fruit goes waste in Bengal or is ferried out to other states, only to come back in levy-added Tetrapaks. We want to utilise this established local resource to derive a cutting cost edge, stressed the biscuit baron, who is eyeing a Rs 100-crore business this financial year in the munch market.

 Priya Yours, which has driven a 10-fold growth in Mother Diarys packaged drinking water, has tied up with The Calcutta Club and Ordnance Club for supply of its forthcoming array of beverages. Talks are also on with the Royal Calcutta Turf Club and the Fort William officers club, besides retail chains like Food Bazaar.

 We obviously cant match the marketing might of the MNCs, but will instead focus on door-to-door knocking and constant local activity to achieve penetration. Our USP will be the margins to retailers, offered Vinay Agarwal, whose dream project it is. The company is also hoping to cash in on a sizeable segment of cola converts with its cloudy and clear limes.

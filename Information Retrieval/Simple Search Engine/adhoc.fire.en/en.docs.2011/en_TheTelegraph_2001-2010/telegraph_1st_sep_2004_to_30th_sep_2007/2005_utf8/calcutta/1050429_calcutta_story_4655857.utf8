Life

 Varnish vanish

 If a product promises to make life easier, it is sure to catch a buyer?s attention. Add to that a healthy dose of novelty and economy, and a product is worth at least the first buy.

 This time, temptation comes in the form of a bottle. The small colourful glass container seems unusual enough to merit a closer look amid an array of more glamorous knick-knacks in the cosmetics section of a store.

 Available in candy colours from the Beauty Lady brand, this contraption offers to take the chore out of removing nail polish. Imported from Bangkok, the nail polish remover pots only require you to dip your delicate finger through a sponge into the solution. A quick wipe with some clean cotton and your nails are stripped bare.

 How much

 Rs 22 per bottle

Just think of bidding a happy farewell to the unpleasant spirit fumes as you douse a dab of cotton and then trudge from nail to nail.

 But the best incentive is that the less messy option is also quite cost effective, coming at a modest Rs 22 a bottle. 

 And here, the sponge will stop some of the wasteful evaporation of the liquid, as would happen if you forgot to press the stopper back on the conventional bottle on one of those harried mornings.

 Blue, green or pink, the colourful apparatus also helps lend some summer colours to your dressing table.

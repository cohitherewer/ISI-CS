Long hair, stubble and sideburns in place, scruffy grunge look, T-shirts screaming Guns N Roses, Kurt Cobain and even Che Guevara, an enthusiastic crowd cheering on the contestants?

 The mood was great, but as the power-packed performances proved, it was the music that really mattered at the finals of Boom-Bass-Stick: The Band Hunt, presented by The Telegraph Metro and Someplace Else, on Wednesday.

 The five shortlisted bands ? Rise from the Ashes, Camouflage, Crystal Grass, Om and Jack Rabbit ? wowed the three judges (musician Nondon Bagchi, actor Anjan Dutt and music journalist Sam Lal) and the audience alike with their renditions of classics as well as original compositions.

 The rules were simple: 20 minutes stage time for each band, during which they had to perform the two songs that they had sent in recorded demos earlier.

 Sounds ranged from bands new to old ? Maroon5s She Will Be Loved to The Cranberries Zombie ? genres spanned from rock to blues, and the self-composed tunes ? six of the 10 songs performed ? held a charm of their own.

 But it was Crystal Grass (scoring 98 points) that managed to beat the rest in the closely-fought competition, with Jack Rabbit (95 points) emerging runner-up.

 It was the toughest contest I have ever judged? and Ive judged thousands of them, admitted Nondon.

 The prizes were handed over to the six-member band by actor Jisshu Sengupta, who used to play the drums for Bengali bands like Paras Pathar and Shahar.

 The bag of goodies for Crystal Grass contained a performance contract with Someplace Else and a chance to play at The Park hotels in Chennai, Bangalore and New Delhi. 

 A live interview on Power FM would also allow Calcutta to know more about them on Thursday morning. And then, from the festive season, Crystal Grass would join the likes of Hip Pocket and Krosswindz at Someplace Else, the place for live music in town.

 It feels great? We were confident when we took the stage and managed to put in our best, smiled a relieved Bodhisattwa Ghosh of Crystal Grass, which was also the only band to feature a female vocalist, Tanya Sen.

 Tanya hit the highest of notes in the number Black Velvet with ease and shone equally bright in Drowning in the Sea of Love.

 My only regret is that they did not play any original material, offered Sam. But the group plans to do that soon.

 Now that weve got the confidence and the recognition, well come up with our own songs as well, promised Bodhisattwa.

 Sam, executive editor of Rock Street Journal, also loved the way the bands played their guitar in general, accompanying the vocals and playing grooves rather than hogging the limelight with riffs, the way bands in Delhi and Mumbai do.

 Anjan was impressed by the various styles that the bands played. In most cases, they played far better than their recorded demos? It was a great experience for me. Writing original music is good, but the bands must also keep in mind that they dont write for the sake of writing.

 The winners did take it all but for the rest, the final word came from Nondon: Dont you dare give it up? Youre all very good? Just go for it.

 Park clone rides, river to canal

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The Millennium Park on the Hooghly will have a clone on the New Cut canal in Ultadanga.

 The Rs 52 lakh-project along the canal, that runs between Ultadanga and RG Kar Medical College, will be funded by Hidco, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the departments of irrigation and public health engineering of the state government.

 The Millennium Park II project was finalised last week at a meeting held by Hidco chairman and housing minister Gautam Deb with representatives from the agencies and departments concerned.

 ?We want to set up a second Millennium Park. Similar projects will also be undertaken on other stretches along the Circular and Kestopur canals. Efforts are on to develop and beautify the banks of the Kestopur canal, for which Hidco has sanctioned Rs 20 crore,?? said Deb.

 The Ultadanga project also includes repairing and widening of a half-a-km stretch of Canal South Road, eviction of encroachers and installation of lamp posts. The canal will also be dredged and the banks fenced.

 Officials said the government and the civic body are providing funds for the initial phase. Private parties will be roped in for the subsequent phases.

 ?Our move is to fully utilise the canals, the entire length along them and the bank roads. Vast areas along the canals are either lying idle, being used as dumping ground or been encroached upon. Our plan is to turn the banks into entertainment centres. The nature of each project would depend on the availability of space,?? the minister pointed out.

 Residents of the Ultadanga-Lake Town-Dum Dum Park belt and also of Salt Lake will be benefited by the development plan.

 Officials said almost the entire Ultadanga-Lake Town-Dum Dum Park stretch has turned into a concrete jungle, with residents, especially children and teenagers, having nowhere to go for a breather.

 ?I have asked officials and engineers to start work on the Ultadanga project immediately and wrap it up in six months,?? asserted Deb.

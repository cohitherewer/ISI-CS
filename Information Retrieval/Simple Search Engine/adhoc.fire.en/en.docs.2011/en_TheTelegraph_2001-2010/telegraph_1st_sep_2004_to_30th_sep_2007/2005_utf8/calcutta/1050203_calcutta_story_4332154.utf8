 Shilpa Shetty with the Indian Idol contestants

 The most watched talent hunt show on Indian television is now on its final leg. Just five contestants are left in the race to super stardom on the wings of Indian Idol. And now the focus is a narrow beam on Abhijit Sawant, Amit Sana, Prajakta Shukre, Rahul Vaidya and Ravinder Ravi. 

 By Friday night after the nationwide polling, another one of them will bite the dust. Before that on Thursday, they will pick and sing songs on the Old is Gold theme and try to impress the fourth judge Shilpa Shetty, alongside the three regulars, Farah Khan, Anu Malik and Sonu Nigam. Metro caught the five in the final countdown.

Abhijit: The excitement was sky high ever since 

there were just 11 of us. I always wanted to be in the top five. So I am very 

happy but at the same time I am sad that a very good friend like Aditi Paul is 

gone. From here on, I have to give my very best, more than 100 per cent. We have 

entered a very crucial stage of the contest. Hopefully, whatever will happen, 

will happen for the best. I have to get the fear out of my system and try and 

stay relaxed. Sirf karm karna hai, phal ke barein mein nahi sochna. 

For this Thursday?s episode I have sung Dil kya kare. All the judges were 

very happy. Shilpa Shetty said that I am her favourite. Isn?t that amazing?

 Prajakta: I am very happy and consider myself extremely lucky to be still there in the final five. I have been through lows in this contest and was once even in the bottom three. So, although I always felt that I would make it to the top five, I wasn?t sure. There have been very tense moments right through. It?s best to leave everything to God. I know that I am the only girl left in the last five but that?s nothing special since Indian Idol is not looking for a boy or a girl, but someone really good. For this Thursday?s episode, I have sung Mera naam chin chin choo and used the Chinese fan as a prop. Everyone liked my performance. Farah felt that I am looking like the perfect Indian Idol package. Shilpa Shetty said that I was the best blend of beauty, talent and innocence. 

 Amit: It feels nice to be there in the final five. I am also very tense because from here on, song selection will play a very important role not only in the contest but in our lives for that matter. The song not only has to go according to the theme but also fit perfectly in the overall scheme of things. Now there?s more attention on us since just five of us are left. With the goal nearer, my hunger has also grown. I have definitely become more greedy. I have to put in more effort ? wouldn?t like to go back empty-handed from here. Also, I?m the only contestant from Calcutta left. So I assume, I have the pride of the city in my hands. For this Thursday?s show, I?ve sung Mast bahaaron ka main aashiq. The reactions of the judges were very heartening. Farah was very happy with me, calling my voice the most different of the lot.

 Rahul: It is truly a great feeling to be in the final five. But now, our responsibilities have doubled. We know that a single small mistake here and there can knock us out. We all are very sad that one of us has to leave every week. But then again, it can?t be helped since that?s the format of the game show. Everyone?s so amazingly talented that it feels bad that one has to be eliminated every Friday. For this Thursday, I?ve sung Ehsaan tera hoga mujh par. Anu Malik and Sonu Nigam were very happy and said that it is me they have been looking for. Shilpa Shetty felt that I was the strongest of the lot. 

 Ravinder: I need to improve my singing. I am happy that I am still in the race. It has been possible due to God and all those who have voted for me till now.

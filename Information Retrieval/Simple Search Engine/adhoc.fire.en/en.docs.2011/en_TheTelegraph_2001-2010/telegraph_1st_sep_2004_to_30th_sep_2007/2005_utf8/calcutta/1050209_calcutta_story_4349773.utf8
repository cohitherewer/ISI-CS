Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to the Chinese calendar, this is the 

year of the rooster. The metal element will be strong throughout the year. As 

the rooster will reign, people belonging to the rabbit sign should be extra careful 

with their health and business matters, especially when dealing with roosters

We?ve just stepped into the first day of the Chinese 

New Year, which started at 3.58 am today. This is a very auspicious day for the 

followers of Feng Shui. Following certain guidelines laid down by Feng Shui will 

help you to be in the best of health and wealth throughout the year.

Wish words

 The first day of the New Year is the right time to write down your wishes and see them coming true throughout the year. This should be done after you have performed certain rituals. 

 Firstly, put fresh, beautiful and fragrant flowers, preferably the ones that are related to the five elements, in a bowl of water. The corresponding colours are yellow for earth, white for metal, blue for water, green for wood and deep red for fire. The presence of the colours of all these elements provides a perfect balance of Chi. Take one of these soaked flowers and sprinkle its water in the entire house by moving around in a clockwise manner. In the end sprinkle it on yourself and all the family members.

 To improve the vibrations in your house, put enchanting religious songs or sing them, and clap, ring bells and gongs all around, especially in the corners where the movement of stagnant energy is most needed. The lavish burning of incense sticks and spraying of aromatic oils help enhance the process of purification. 

After this, you should sit in a lotus position, close 

your eyes, let go of all your unimportant thoughts, meditate, and pray for peace, 

harmony and good health for all your near and dear ones. After doing so, you should 

write your wishes and place them in the prayer room beside a burning candle. When 

your wishes are granted, you can float the piece of paper in running water.

Animal sign

 This is the year of the rooster according to the Chinese calendar. According to mythology, the rooster was not being granted a place amongst the 12 zodiac animal signs because it was not serving humanity in any way. Also, flying birds were not allowed to compete in the race. Following the advice of his friend, the horse, the rooster used his wonderful voice to wake people up in the morning, so that they wouldn?t be late for work. This allowed him the chance to compete in the race. 

 During the race the rooster and the dog were running very closely to each other and in the end the rooster flew and beat the dog. So he was placed in the 10th place of the zodiac animal sign, just before the dog. After this race, the dog started hating him and it is believed that this is why the dog always chases the rooster. 

The fact that the rooster went ahead of the dog in 

the race by flying shows that he always wants to be the focus of attention. He 

is believed to have the characteristics of a proud, independent, flamboyant and 

arrogant person. People belonging to the rooster sign are always well dressed 

and try to charm others with their personality and gift of the gab. They are reliable 

too, because they wake you up in time. They make charming partners and are very 

dedicated and committed to their spouse. 

Bird threat

 In the 12 earthly branches, the rooster, which has strong influences of the metal element, is placed directly opposite the rabbit, which has the wood element. According to the destructive cycle, metal threatens wood. Since the rooster will be reigning this year, people belonging to the rabbit sign should be very careful about their health and business matters. 

 They should be extra cautious when dealing with roosters and should seek support from dragons. They can draw support from a family member belonging to the dragon sign or an image or a figure of a dragon kept on the bedside table or office table.

Since the metal element will overpower the wood element 

this year, you should try to strengthen the wood areas, which are east and south-east. 

These two sectors are very significant as they relate to health and wealth. To 

strengthen these sectors place plenty of fresh plants and use lots of green in 

the decor.

Star talk

 According to Flying Stars, the Grand Duke Jupiter will occupy the west direction this year. The Chinese acquire the support and assistance of this star in whatever they do by sitting with their back to the west. They do not dare to confront it or face this direction while signing any important document. The Three Killings will occupy the east direction this year. Here, it is advisable to face this direction rather than having your back towards it as you can be stabbed in the back. The third important direction that should also be taken care of is the north-west, which is occupied by the Deadly Five Yellow. An easy way to counter the misfortunes brought by this star is hanging a five-rod metal solid wind chime in the north-west of the house. Alternatively, a solid piece of metal in the form of a statue can also be kept here.

 You should not renovate rooms located in the west, east or north-west of the house or office this year. But if major renovations are undertaken then you need not follow this restriction. In that case, ensure that construction work does not start from these directions.

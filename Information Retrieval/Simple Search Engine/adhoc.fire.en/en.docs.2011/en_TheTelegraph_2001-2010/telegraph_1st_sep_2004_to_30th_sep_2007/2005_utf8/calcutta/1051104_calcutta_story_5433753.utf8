 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, has announced the launch of its new management programme ? a one-year, full-time post-graduate diploma in management for executives.

 Shekhar Chowdhury, director, IIM Calcutta, said on Thursday: ?This particular MBA programme has been designed for bright, young and ambitious executives, with a specific focus to develop them for leadership positions in global organisations.?

 The programme, scheduled to start in the next academic year (2006-07), will be a general management programme. The modules in the curriculum will include economics, quantitative methodology, entrepreneurship, creating and managing new ventures, international management, human resources and behavioural sciences.

 ?There will be a number of elective courses for the executives as well, to develop expertise in their chosen fields. Communication skills, both written and oral, are to be highlighted,? said Chowdhury.

 With the IIMs being projected as a global brand, the young executive MBA programme would add to the brand equity of IIM Joka. ISB Hyderabad is one global management school that has incorporated management programmes on similar lines.

 ?We have been observing the tremendous rise in demand for quality executive management education. There has been a specific increase in the number of people with work experience who are on the lookout for value addition in their chosen fields,? said Chowdhury.

 There is a big tank of the Raj era in the compound of Indian Museum, in the 

heart of the city. Though hundreds of tourists, mostly from outside the state 

and country, visit the museum, nothing is being done to beautify the waterbody. 

Situated right in front of Ashutosh Hall, this tank is visible from Kyd Street, 

too. Only a few years ago, the museum authorities had tried to choke this pond 

by filling it up and constructing a building on it. Timely media attention and 

objection by various local NGOs forced the authorities to abandon the annihilation 

of the waterbody. However, once the construction work was stopped, nobody bothered 

to remove the wood and bamboo structure erected on the pond bed. The wooden posts 

prop out of the water surface and mar the beauty of the pond. As if this was not 

enough, garbage is also dumped into it by visitors. This pond can be cleaned and 

opened to public for boatrides.

 During the tenure of one of the previous directors, more than half-a-decade 

ago, an annex building was being planned by the museum on the land where the waterbody 

exists. The construction work was started by the Central Public Works Department 

(CPWD). But thereafter, the museum decided to scrap the project due to various 

reasons. We had asked the CPWD to take away the bamboo poles that were erected 

on the pond bed. I don?t know why the CPWD has not done so. I haven?t followed 

up the matter lately. Once that is done, the museum has plans to beautify the 

waterbody. 

 SK Basu, Director, Indian Museum.

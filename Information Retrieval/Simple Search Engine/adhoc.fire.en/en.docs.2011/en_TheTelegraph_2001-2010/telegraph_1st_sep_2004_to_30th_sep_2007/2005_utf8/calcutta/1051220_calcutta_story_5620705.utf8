The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Frown on Maidan fair

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 For the past two years, the state government and the army have been telling Calcutta High Court that fairs would not be held on the Maidan, only to do a U-turn when winter comes.

 This December, once again, the Maidan will play host to two major fairs ? a trade fair organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry from December 21, and the Book Fair scheduled for end-January 2006.

 The excuse offered by the government to the court is that the new venue, off the EM Bypass, is not ready and that the army has allowed the use of the Maidan.

 An association moved a petition in the high court stating that the policy was ?unfair? since it had been denied permission to hold a fair on the Maidan this year.

 Dismissing the petition moved by GK Marketing Association seeking an order allowing it to hold a trade fair on the Maidan in April 2006, Justice J.K. Biswas observed that army should not be ?discriminatory?. The judge pointed out that political parties are allowed to hold rallies on the Maidan.

 The court, while lauding the army?s efforts to keep the Maidan free of pollution by debarring the association from holding the fair, wondered why permission was granted to the Chamber and the Booksellers? Publishers? Guild, organisers of the book fair. The judge stated the two fairs should also have been disallowed on grounds of pollution. 

 Moving the petition, advocate Ashok Banerjee alleged: ?In April this year, my client had approached the army for allowing them to hold the trade fair. At that time, the authorities had told them that the high court had discouraged holding of fairs on the Maidan so it was not possible to give a go-ahead.?

 Appearing on behalf the state government, advocate-general Balai Roy informed the court that the Chamber and the state government were jointly organising the fair. Archana Sengupta, counsel for the army, said the permission had been granted since the state government was involved.

 Justice Biswas stressed that ?the mistake? should not be repeated.

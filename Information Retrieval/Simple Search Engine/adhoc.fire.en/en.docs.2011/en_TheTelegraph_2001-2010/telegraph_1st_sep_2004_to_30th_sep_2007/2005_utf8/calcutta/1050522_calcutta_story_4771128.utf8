The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Their films, our thoughts

 Woody Allen with Scarlet Johannson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers in Cannes

 Woody Allen?s self-mocking humour, Arthur Penn?s charming bank robbers and Don Siegel?s eerie plant-like pods invading a picturesque town. A film appreciation workshop meant for students of film studies turned out to be much more than just classroom lectures. Organised by the American Center, the three-day session threw up interesting strands for a movie buff to study Hollywood, inside out.

 With students from the Jadavpur and Calcutta universities forming the bulk of the audience, the workshop kicked off on May 18 with an introductory talk by Moinak Biswas, head of the department of film studies at JU. Pinning his talk on why Hollywood commands a global position, Biswas briefly traced the progression of cinema from the silent era to the talkies.

 A screening of Manhattan (1979, starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep) soon after paved the way for a talk on director Allen?s fine blend of humour with pathos. Film-editor Argha Kamal Mitra touched upon the powerful story-telling technique, saying: ?There is no self-indulgent camera work here. You just listen to the story.? 

 Added Biswas: ?One has to be a little aware to understand the nuances of Allen?s comedy. And the city of Manhattan is as much of a character as the others.? 

 The third speaker of the day, Gopalan Mullick from the department of media and film studies, St Xavier?s College, dwelt on the structure of a comic situation, tracing its development from 1895 to 1956. ?The structure remains the same, the inner meaning changes,? said Mullick.

 Day Two was dedicated to action movies, with a screening of Arthur Penn?s landmark 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunnaway. Talking on ?the invasion of dirty heroes? in action films, Subhajit Chatterjee, a research fellow at the Centre for the Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore, rambled through the prehistory of action films.

 Madhuja Mukherjee, head of the department of media and film studies, St Xavier?s College, took off from Quentin Tarantino?s Kill Bill (Vol 1) to explore the new-age techniques and spectacular scenes that have become the benchmark of action films.

 The final day talk shifted to sci-fi with a screening of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and both speakers ? Somnath Zutshi from Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre and Abhijit Gupta of JU?s department of English ? focusing on the 1950s, the decade marking the rise of sci-fi. Zutshi probed the huge proliferation of sci-fi films in the 50s, keeping in mind the social and political conditions of the times. ?In the popular imagination of the US in the 1950s, the skies were haunted. Fear and suspicion left the people feeling threatened,? said Zutshi. Gupta chose the ambit of sci-fi novels to illustrate his point. ?Science fiction was a magazine-driven genre. And the fan group was very important in the development of sci-fi as they would write back stating what they liked and didn?t.?

 Deepika: Three-in-one thriller:

 ldquo;I rsquo;ve got the height that rsquo;s required for ramp modelling and my face has got that fresh feel that print and television ads look for. That rsquo;s what I think gives me the versatility in modelling. rdquo;

Smasher called Padukone

 She was touted as one of the hottest ramp walkers at the recently-held India Fashion Week. Her latest ad campaign for Limca has been creating waves on the small screen. And her face has been quite a hit in print ads of late.

 Deepika Padukone, daughter of former badminton champion Prakash Padukone, has already achieved a feat that very few Indian models have managed so far. The versatile lady has proved her expertise in all three fields of modelling, each of which comes with its own specific requirements.

 ?I?ve got the height that?s required for ramp modelling and my face has got that fresh feel that print and television ads look for. That?s what I think gives me the versatility in modelling,? smiles Deepika, in Calcutta earlier this week to inaugurate a jewellery exhibition by PC Chandra called Swarna Mrigaya.

 The svelte beauty has been in the circuit for just a year and she?s already busy with a host of shows and ad campaigns, including one for a footwear brand in Singapore. But her sights are set firmly on Bollywood, and it?s just a matter of time before she takes the plunge into filmdom. 

 ?I?m not ready as an actress right now, though good offers have been coming my way. I don?t want to get into movies yet and just look good on screen. I have to be fully prepared with my acting skills first,? says Deepika. And the preparation includes a three-month course in acting in Mumbai that she?s currently undergoing.

 ?I hope to be ready next year and after that I will await the right role. Till then, I?ll concentrate on modelling.?

 While the Bangalore babe has always been attracted to the glamour world, she has dabbled in her father?s forte, too. A state-level badminton player while in school, Deepika quit the sport just before her Board exams, after which the world of modelling won game, set and match.

 Hospital stress on trauma care

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With cases of fatal road accidents and death due to trauma increasing, city hospitals have decided to address the problem by setting up special trauma-care facilities.

 Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences had shown the way by setting up a trauma-care centre. Other hospitals are following suit, with specialised attention to trauma.

 Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, one of the few hospitals to have a state-of-the-art medical emergency service, has introduced an accident insurance card now. 

 The card, christened Dost, will cost just Rs 250 a year, and whoever opts for the scheme will get free treatment up to Rs 1 lakh at the hospital in case of any accident. ?We are planning to launch similar schemes for heart attacks and strokes in the near future. This apart, we are also planning to set up a telemedicine and teleradiology centre to deal with emergency cases,? Tamorish Kole, coordinator of the hospital?s emergency services, said at a seminar on emergency medical care.

 Every year, over 450 people die in road accidents. Most of them die owing to trauma, which can be avoided if proper emergency medical treatment is taken.

 ?In many cases, untrained people lift accident patients from the site and bring them to hospital in a way which does them harm and causes numerous fractures and injuries,? said neurosurgeon L.N. Tripathi of Apollo Gleneagles. 

 Recently, AMRI Hospitals started an ambulance service equipped with life-saving gadgets, as well as doctors and nurses. A few days ago, officers of the newly-opened BP Poddar Hospital announced that trauma care will be its priority. 

 The recent focus on trauma care started after most hospitals belonging to the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, a conglomerate of top 13 hospitals of Calcutta, decided to pitch for trauma care, one of the most neglected fields in the city.

 ?For years, the state government has been trying to set up trauma-care facilities, but failed to live up to the task. We, therefore, have decided to take it upon ourselves to do something about it,? said Sajal Dutta, association president.

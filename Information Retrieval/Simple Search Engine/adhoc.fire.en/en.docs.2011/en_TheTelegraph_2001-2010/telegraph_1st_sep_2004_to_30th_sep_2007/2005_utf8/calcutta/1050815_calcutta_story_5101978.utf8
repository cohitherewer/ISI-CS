 Get your malt at your mall

 - Hard liquor sale licences from next month for department stores

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 India-made foreign liquor will now be sold in malls

 Pick up your poison with your provisions. 

 In response to the rising demand and a sharp rise in revenue collection from liquor, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to allow India-made foreign liquor (IMFL) to be sold in malls. Till now, only low-alcohol drinks, like beer and wines, were allowed to be sold in malls by the excise department. 

 ?We will soon issue a notification in this regard. The owners of department stores, who intend to sell IMFL, will have to take a licence from the excise department by paying a fee. The stores will have to follow certain terms and conditions to sell liquor,?? excise secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar said on Sunday.

 ?After all, liquor is not a banned item that it cannot be sold in outlets other than liquor shops,?? he stressed.

 According to excise department officers, a licence will be issued to stores with a floorspace not less than 4,000 sq ft, and where at least five kinds of commodities, including food, are sold.

 Efforts are on to start issuing licences from next month so that store-owners can exploit the Puja market.

 Those who intend to sell liquor will have to make a separate enclosure in their store and a separate cash counter as well. This apart, there must be a boundary/railing (permanent or temporary) in the store separating the liquor and other departments. Bottles can be displayed only in the enclosure selling the liquor.

 The decision comes in the wake of the rising demand for IMFL and increasing revenues. According to officers at Writers? Buildings, the government felt that it is the easiest way to increase revenue from liquor. The government is earning nearly Rs 700 crore from excise, and the figure is shooting up by at least Rs 100 to Rs 150 crore every year. The government expects an additional revenue of Rs 100 crore from selling liquor at department stores.

 ?The concept of market has changed and a number of malls and plazas have come up in recent times, where most goods are available. If each and every item, from toothpaste to shoe polish, is sold in any department store or mall, what is the harm in selling liquor??? Rajendrakumar asked.

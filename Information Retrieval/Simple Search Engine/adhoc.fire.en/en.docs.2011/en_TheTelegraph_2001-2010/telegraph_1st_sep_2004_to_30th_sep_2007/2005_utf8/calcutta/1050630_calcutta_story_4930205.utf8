 Lifeline for southern sanctuary

 - Compensation arrives to ease land takeover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There?s light at the end of the tunnel for Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary, subjected to neglect for years. 

 ?The finance department has sanctioned Rs 3 crore as settlement for the 17 acres of land on which the sanctuary is located,? announced forest minister Jogesh Burman on Wednesday. 

 After the landowners are compensated, the department will be able to take over the property. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee disclosed this at a meeting of the state wildlife board, which he chairs, at Writers? Buildings on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The sprawling orchard at the site, with its thick canopy of trees and dense undergrowth, has been a haunt of insects and birds. 

 A total of 112 avian species have been spotted in Narendrapur, in addition to jackals, jungle cats, civets, mongoose and monitor lizards. 

 ?Even though it was declared a sanctuary in 1982, the property continued to be exploited as an orchard and as a venue for film shoots and picnics. In spite of the human interference, rare birds, like the lesser racket-tailed dringo and the red-backed butcher bird, have been sighted. The latter is the first sighting in India,? said Kushal Mukherjee of NGO Prakriti Samsad.

 This, despite the fact that in the fruit season, liberal doses of insecticides are sprayed on the mango, guava, blackberry and jackfruit trees.

 Zoo shift: The state government has also finalised plans to shift a part of the Alipore zoo to Bhagwanpur mouza, off the EM Bypass.

 ?The chief minister emphasised that Alipore is not the right place for housing the zoo, built way back in 1875. With high levels of noise and air pollution, coupled with tall buildings all around, ecology has taken a beating in Alipore,? said minister Burman. 

 A 226-acre plot has been identified, where a section of the animals will be moved for setting up a safari park-cum-zoo, he added. The arrangement is aimed at lessening the load on Alipore zoo.

 Waterbody upkeep: Government officials also declared on Wednesday that work for conservation of the Santragachhi jheel, which plays host to 6,000 to 7,000 migratory birds, has been started. Fencing off the jheel, spread over an area of 0.817 sq km, begun on Sunday.

 A four-ft-high chain-link fence will be put up around the waterbody to restrict the invasion by outsiders. Bins are also being installed to prevent littering.

?I will do films as long as I enjoy it?

 AISHWARYA RAI celebrated a low-key birthday in far-off Slovakia. She spoke to STAR News and STAR Ananda on movies and milestones

 Aishwarya Rai at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year

 On her birthday: Here in Slovakia, I am missing all my family on this day (November 1). I am because of them ? Mummy and Daddy. So this is their day. Also, I want to thank all my fans who have been sending so many messages on my site and on my phone? it?s just short of crashing.

 On her Madame Tussaud?s statue: I was filming for Bride amp; Prejudice when I received a formal letter from the people at Madame Tussaud?s wax museum. They had conducted some kind of a survey and yet again all my fans and well-wishers chose me as the Indian personality who should be all dolled up in wax. It?s an incredible honour and (I am) in fine company. It feels good to be able to carve the niche I am constantly working towards in my life.

 On appearing on the cover of Time magazine: It?s again a huge honour given the opportunity to represent India internationally, on the global platform. It is a responsibility thoroughly cherished, enjoyed and considered a blessing. I hope to contribute to it in all sincerity, whole-heartedly and I am trying my best to do my best.

ALL-ACTION ASH 

 Aishwarya is currently shooting in Slovakia for The Last Legion, co-starring international greats like Colin Firth and Sir Ben Kingsley. Based on author Valerio Manfredi rsquo;s international bestseller, the film is set against the fall of the Roman empire in 470 AD. Ash plays Byzantine warrior Mira who accompanies legionnaire Aurelius (Firth) and Roman teacher Ambrosinus (Kingsley) to help 12-year-old emperor Romulus Augustus escape from the island-fortress of Capri.

 Says director Doug Lefler: ldquo;We needed an actress of rare beauty, with enough screen presence to hold her own against the likes of Colin Firth and Sir Ben Kingsley. Aishwarya was the obvious choice. rdquo;

 In the film, Ash has had to death-defying stunts like climbing a wall and hanging 400 ft about sea level. Says stunt co-ordinator Steve Griffin, who has worked on films like Titanic, Terminator 3 and Charlie rsquo;s Angels: ldquo;Because of her dance history, I found she could move well and remember her choreography very easily. We put a sword in her hand and she just flowed. I believe Aishwarya to be a natural action hero. rdquo;

 Fight choreographer Don Liam, who has worked in films like Spider-Man 2 and The Matrix trilogy goes one step further: ldquo;Aishwarya is faster than any other actress I have ever taught... very smart and intelligent. If she continues to do action films, she will become a true super-hero woman. rdquo;

On having a tulip named after her in Amsterdam: I consider the tulip as a sign of me working on the blossoming factor (laughs). Growth is constant and I am trying to grow constantly. It?s really special. It (tulip) makes my association with Amsterdam forever, and they are such wonderful people. I had a great time at the awards function there. They have been very supportive and appreciative of our cinema. So I am glad to be a part of their country, via the tulip!

 On appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show: Oprah has been very, very special. She is a lady I absolutely admire. She is fantastic at what she does, of her show itself and who she is as a woman of the world. The way she really has used her celebrity (status) to touch people?s lives? As a woman she is an inspiration, as a lady she is fantastic. When I met her in person, she more than lived up to my expectations and the impression I had of her. She is too endearing, extremely real and I was very happy to be on her show and meet her.

 On doing more foreign than Indian projects: Just because I am working with units outside India does not mean I have left India or I have moved away from India or I have stopped working in Indian films. Because I haven?t. I am still working in our films. And I always will. I love our film industry and I love our cinema. Being outdoors for shoots has always been a way of life. This is the way it?s been. This year in particular I have been out of India a lot. I have made three films back-to-back outside of India ? Mistress of Spices, Provoked and now, The Last Legion. These three films came one after the other and have kept me outside India for the longest time in succession.

 On her Indian projects: I am doing Sanjay Gadhvi?s Dhoom 2, J.P. Dutta?s Umrao Jaan and Ashutosh Gowariker?s Jodha Akbar. I have got along fabulously well with the Last Legion team. I could go back to India a couple of weeks ago to prepare for Dhoom 2 and Umrao Jaan, because as soon as I go back I go straight to filming. It?s not that I don?t want to do more Indian films but time becomes a huge factor.

 On her wedding: That will happen when it has to happen. That?s God?s plan. It?s got nothing to do with my profession. I enjoy my career, my choice of career, the fact that I am part of cinema? I will do it as long as I enjoy it. No other factor becomes a deciding factor for it. The day I feel there?s a lack of growth or stagnation, I will move on and do something else. But I will always do something all my life.

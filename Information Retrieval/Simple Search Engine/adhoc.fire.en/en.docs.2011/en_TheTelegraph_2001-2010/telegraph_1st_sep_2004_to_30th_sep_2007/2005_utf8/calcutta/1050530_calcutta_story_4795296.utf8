The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High five for CBSE schools 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 As marksheets of examinees of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 examinations ? the results of which were declared on Thursday ? arrive in city schools, the authorities of CBSE institutions said the performance of Calcutta students has improved this time. 

 The schools said the high academic standards maintained by the CBSE and its affiliated institutions had contributed to the improvement in results. 

 Top scorers of various schools under the board corroborated the opinion of the institution heads. 

 They said it was due to the support of their teachers in schools that they had been able to excel in their board examinations. 

 ?I am really indebted to my teachers in school, who helped me whenever I approached them,? said Arunima Patra, a top scorer from Army Public School, Ballygunge. She has obtained 94.6 per cent. 

 At Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Ushasi Kundu topped in her institution by scoring 94.2 per cent. ?As in the past few years, our school has performed brilliantly. Of the 179 examinees from our institution, 178 are in the first division. Only one has scored less than 60 per cent,? said school principal Anindita Chatterjee. 

 ?We have been able to maintain the high standards with active support from all our teachers and guardians,? she added.

 Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghathan recorded 95.8 per cent as the highest score in its category of schools. 

 The topper is Priyabrata Priyadarshi of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Fort William. Along with his teachers, Priyabrata is grateful to his father, his ?friend, philosopher and guide?.

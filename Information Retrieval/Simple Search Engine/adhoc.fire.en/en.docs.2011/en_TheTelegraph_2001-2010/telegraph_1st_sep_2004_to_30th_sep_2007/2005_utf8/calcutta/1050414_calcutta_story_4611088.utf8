 The report ?Cop rein on rowdy Holi revellers?, March 

23, bore good news. Holi is a festival of joy, merriment and harmony. But the 

way it is celebrated by many leaves much to be desired. 

 Some people try to take advantage of the situation while smearing abir on women. Copious consumption of alcohol has also become associated with the festival. Drunk revellers can be seen loitering in all parts of the city on the day of the festival, abusing and making indecent gestures at passersby. The joyous mood is marred in the process. 

 This apart, mischief-makers use various types of crude chemicals in the colours and mix abir with obnoxious ingredients. The toxic compounds cause various health problems on coming in contact with the skin. 

 We should all try our best to maintain peace while celebrating Holi and use only skin-friendly abir and colours. But that is seldom done. 

 People over-enthusiastic about the festival often begin the celebration a few days in advance. They smear colour on unsuspecting people, causing them much inconvenience and throw balloons at moving buses, trains and trams. Residents of highrises are also known to pour coloured water on people walking along the footpath below. 

 Those indulging in such celebrations would do well to consider that the Chinese celebrate a festival similar to Holi. But they do not go about it in an indecent manner like us. Only plain water is sprinkled during the festival. 

 In view of the situation, the initiatives taken by the police are praiseworthy. What remains to be seen is whether their promises are kept. 

 A proper vigil by the administration will help us enjoy Holi in a proper way. The government and the police should ensure that buying and selling of harmful chemicals that can be used to spike abir and colours is banned before the festival. 

Debyani Basu,

 Apropos the report ?Army slams gates of elitist Eden?, March 25, the closure of the park has come as a shock. It is, however, true that most people are against the introduction of entry fees at the Eden Gardens. 

 It is very difficult to find a pollution-free zone within the city. With the introduction of the entry fee at Eden Gardens, one more option for morning walkers has closed. 

 The army was right in dismantling the food stall inside the park. The step was necessary to keep the garden clean. Hawkers, too, should not be allowed entry into the park. 

 The civic body need to immediately sort out the differences with the army and reopen the garden. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

Apropos the report ?Shoot at sight, not in our sight?, March 22, the police have done the right thing by not allowing a task force of Kanpur police to kill five gangsters from Uttar Pradesh in a fake encounter. It would have been murder. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

Beleghata 

Apropos the report ?Sinister sprawl the sundown streets?, March 24, the problem of pavement-dwellers exists in many of the busy streets. A number of families reside on the streets near the Park Circus crossing. They refuse to budge, even for repair work. Since they occupy most of the footpath, pedestrians are forced to use the road. The leaders should give them proper accommodation. That will not only reduce the dangers to their own lives but also curb anti-social activities.

Apropos the report ?Reprieve for aged, ailing convicts?, March 24, criminals should not be set free from jail just because they are old. One of the women being released murdered her daughter-in-law. Since she is already 80 years old, what ?bright future? can there be in store for her? Shouldn?t her crime be considered above all other factors? 

Kabita Roy,

Shibpur.

Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf?s elder brother Javed Musharraf?s brief stopover en route to Varanasi undoubtedly added a new dimension to the promotion of meaningful relations between the neighbours (Breezy visit, low-key kin, March 24). Javed?s fascination for the city?s cultural heritage will undoubtedly win the hearts of Calcuttans. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

Apropos ?Carrots to get at true cable count?, March 18, since the census has come up a cropper and it is unlikely that the correct figure can and will be arrived at by the cable operators and police, why not set up a toll-free number where cable subscribers can voluntarily provide the required information? Most subscribers would do so gladly, given that they have to bear the brunt of the MSOs and the operators? whims. 

V. Majumdar,

Narayantala (West). 

I was shocked to see that intellectuals and activists like Aparna Sen and Shabana Azmi were present at the launch of the Tommy Hilfiger store in Calcutta (Tommy, 20, comes to fashion town, March 21). The designer had made extremely racist remarks against Africans and Asians. He reportedly told a reputed fashion magazine ?... who cares what they (Africans and Asians) think... If I had known they were buying my clothes, I would never have made them?. 

 At least Oprah Winfrey had the moral courage to ask Hilfiger to leave her chat show, when he admitted to making the remarks. I trust the Calcuttans will have the same self-respect. 

Iti Misra, 

Middleton Street.

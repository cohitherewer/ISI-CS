 Alone, in life and death

 - Bodies of two aged women found days after demise

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They were both aged and alone. They lived a few miles apart and had probably never met. But their fates met tragically, in life and in death.

 On Friday, their bodies were recovered from their respective addresses ? one on Kyd Street and the other on Lenin Sarani ? at least two days after they had died. Both had been living alone, with no one to turn to. Both had died alone, with no one to miss them.

 The twin tragedy started unfolding around 11 am on Friday, at 5, Kyd Street, when residents of the highrise alerted Park Street police station about a stench emanating from an apartment on the first floor.

 ?A team of officers went to the spot and decided to break down the door,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 ?When officers entered the apartment, they found the body of a woman, in her mid-60s, lying on the floor of the drawing room. No external marks of injury could be made out as the body was decomposed. She seems to have died more than two days ago.?

 Preliminary investigation revealed the woman?s identity as Shukla Chowdhury, who had been residing alone for the past few years. She did not have any visitors, her neighbours told police.

 ?After inspecting the cupboards and other furniture, it does not appear that any theft has taken place in the apartment. An electric heater was kept near the body. We are not sure about the reason of the death. The body has been sent for post-mortem,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department.

 Within half-an-hour of the Kyd Street death being discovered, Bowbazar police station was grappling with a similar incident being unearthed. This time, in an apartment at 84, Lenin Sarani.

 ?The body of a 56-year-old woman was found hanging from the ceiling of her bedroom. A rope was tied around her neck. According to preliminary examination, the woman died more than two days ago,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Sharma.

 The Parsi woman, identified as Aban Kaka, was a spinster and lived alone, police added.

 But here, the cops landed a clue ? a small piece of paper with a note: ?I am tired of living alone and taking so many medicines.?

 Police, however, refused to conclude that this was a case of suicide. ?For that, we will have to wait for the post-mortem report. Besides, we have collected some samples of the deceased?s handwriting from the room. We will send the note and the samples to handwriting experts to ascertain whether the words were written by her.?

 Earlier this week, a man in his mid-60s, who also used to live alone, was found dead in his Ultadanga residence.

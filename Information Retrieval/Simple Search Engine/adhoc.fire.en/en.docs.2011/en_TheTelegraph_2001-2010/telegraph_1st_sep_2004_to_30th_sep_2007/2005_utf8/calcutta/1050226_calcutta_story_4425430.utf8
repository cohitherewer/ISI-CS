 Police custody for abduction driver 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mukesh Singh, driver of the car in which Arvind Bhai was murdered, was on Friday produced in the criminal court of Alipore?s sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM), and remanded in police custody till March 5.

 In a red T-shirt and grey trousers, Singh was produced in court around 2.25 pm. Ninth judicial magistrate Rajesh Chakrabarty, who was the acting SDJM, sent him to police custody till March 5.

 ?Mukesh Singh was produced in court in connection with the Roma Jhawar abduction case. In the course of the investigation, the police had seized a Maruti Omni, of which he was the driver. The police had prayed for keeping him in custody for 14 days. But the court allowed police custody till March 5,? said public prosecutor Swapan Chakraborty.

 Earlier, Mukesh told the CID that he had received Rs 10,000 to cooperate with the abductors. He had been driving the red Omni in which Arvind was murdered. 

 A top Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officer said that according to Mukesh, an altercation had broken out among Arvind, Pappu and Gunjan over sharing the ransom. 

 Arvind had demanded Rs 10 lakh and Pappu wanted Rs 8 lakh. That left Gunjan with only Rs 2 lakh. At that time, Mukesh was driving the car, Pappu was sitting beside him, and Gunjan and Arvind were in the back seat. 

 Suddenly, Pappu whipped out a revolver from his pocket and shot Arvind. 

 The CID will verify Mukesh?s statements during his stay in custody till March 5, a CID official said. ?Mukesh will be interrogated to track down the firearms, particularly the one used to kill Arvind,? the public prosecutor said.

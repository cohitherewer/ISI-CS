The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Tusker trip, laptop talk

A journey to take part in the centenary celebrations 

of Kaziranga National Park starts with a dog bite and ends with a gift from a 

travel writer and a smirk from a driver

I took off from Calcutta to participate in the inaugural 

celebrations of Kaziranga?s centenary. My dog had just bitten off my face. The 

stupid vet in trying to clip Toby?s nails, cut him to the quick and then in tying 

his mouth while giving him a bath, cut straight through his cheek until he bled. 

That night when I got home after midnight, I took a shower and then went straight 

to Toby (name changed to protect his loving identity) who was lying on his bed, 

fast asleep. I stooped to give him a goodnight kiss and, startled at the prospect 

of the vet having returned to torture him, poor little terrified Toby, in his 

stupor, snapped at my face and sank his teeth around my chops. 

And so, with a gamocha wrapped around my face that 

looked like a misshapen gourd or banglar paanch as my delirious wife pointed 

out, and an Australian hat on my head, I checked through security at the airport 

where everyone including uniformed women frisking gentle ladies stared at me as 

if I were a Muslim transvestite with the sort of headscarf that governments around 

the world were banning, with motives to divert the Jorhat flight to Islamabad. 

I was reluctantly let on board but a suspicious package that I held close to my 

chest came under constant scrutiny and probe until I was finally able to shove 

the damn anti-rabies vaccines that I would need to shoot into myself while shooting 

rhinos, in the aircrafts freezer.

The following morning, before sunrise, as we rode 

into the sanctuary on huge elephants, there were tourists from all parts of the 

world and two curious gents from the Taj Group in Mumbai ? the only ones with 

long lenses in their cameras and interested in my covered face. Being guests of 

the government we had the tallest Elephas Maximus so everyone beneath and around 

us watched as we led the small convoy of Elephantidae through the tall grass.

As I rolled from right to left above the colossus? 

spine, peering through the grass to look for animals, a serpent eagle eyed me 

from a blooming simul tree and then suddenly out of the mists a huge fishing 

eagle, with its talons bared, swooshed past my face and in throwing my head back 

to escape the attack, my scarf fell to the ground far below and revealed my swollen 

lips that looked like a boar?s snout under a proboscis that my family laughed 

at anyway. 

I heard the motors run on the Taj cameras and as I 

whisked around saw Camilla Parker Bowles? brother Mark, jealous because he wasn?t 

ruling over us all on a tall Loxodonta africana, pull his khaki safari hat down 

over his lobster face while he chuckled and spluttered behind its brim and his 

shoulders bobbed up and down as he choked. Rather than have a regiment of cheap 

tourists guffaw like wild asses from Kutch at me, I asked our mahout to let the 

other elephants go through and decided to bring up the rear. 

First came each elephant that turned to see if I was 

some kind of tapir, then their mahouts and then the riffraff on their backs. It 

took ages for just four elephants to pass us while I simply sat in my howdah and 

looked each rude animal and man in the eye as it passed by, with the laid-back 

indifference of someone used to the inquisitiveness of plebs. As Mark waltzed 

by on his elephas midgetus, he doffed his hat and said: ?Terribly sorry; feel 

okay ?? I was about to eat his head off when my giggling wife shut me up and quickly 

replied: ?He?s fine, thank you?. Stupid convent upbringing that never begat a 

feline that could kick sand in the face of dirty Englanders.

After the wagging bottom of the last elephant was 

five minutes ahead of us, I nearly fell out of my skin. Right there in front of 

us was a gorgeous Royal Bengal tiger, a massive horned rhino and three huge buffalos 

with large sets of horns sniffing the air and looking up at us. An egret flew 

in and sat on the back of one of the buffalos and a pair of jungle mynahs came 

and settled on the rhino. Fantastic. I jabbed my wife in the ribs and asked her 

to take pictures with her point ?n? shoot Samsung digital and ruined the shot 

she was quietly taking of a pair of very rare collared Scops Owls (that I later 

discovered hadn?t been seen in these parts for over 25 years) scowling down at 

us from a pipal. It was unbelievable. Then, out of the bushes in front of us leapt 

a wild boar. It stared and strolled closer and looked up at me, sat back on its 

haunches, knit its brows and dug its tusks once, twice, three times in the dirt 

that sent a cloud of white powdery dust into the rhino?s eyes, then rolled over 

to one side and went to sleep in the first rays of the rising sun. The rhino blinked 

and snorted. The mahout said he had never seen a spectacle like this ever before 

and the guard, who sat at our elephant?s tail end, with a rifle across his knees, 

had thankfully stopped chewing his stinking tambul betel nut. By now I had fractured 

my wife?s ribs; elbowing her nonstop to take pictures of now this now that, and, 

of course, she was bloody well missing all the right moments and getting still 

shots of a somnambulant pig.

As I looked up to thumb my nose and cock a snoot at 

those tourists who had laughed at my mauled face and were now missing it all, 

I saw a ring of four elephants that had crept back up and were busy capturing 

the rear ends of all these animals and shooting vertical frames to get us in the 

picture as well. ?Hey!? I screamed, ?get lost! Find your own!? Our guard went 

?shush? and the mahout went ?shush? and they looked at each other, nodded and 

went tut tut in an Assamese dialect that suggested ?here was a wet neck that had 

never been in a game sanctuary before?. To tell you the truth, I was a bit embarrassed 

and can only excuse my unusual behaviour on the grounds that a movie star, such 

as I am, is stared at for his charming good looks, usually, and not, his morphed 

snout.

That evening, when I stood on stage to deliver my 

welcome address, I made sure that the light on the podium would be dimmed to the 

minimum. I had made such a song and dance about the lighting on my face that the 

electricians and lighting experts would have murdered me, and I could see that 

in their ruddy eyes, if it were not for the fact that I was a friend of the chief 

minister and the forest minister and the power minister and any member of the 

working classes could be jailed if they so much as breathed heavily around me. 

Anyway, after I had thrown as many fits as an entire ward of epileptics rolled 

into one, I discovered, five minutes before I was to go on, that someone had pinched 

my script. Stolen it. As my name was announced and the polite applause died down, 

I walked up to the dimly lit podium and placed a laptop on it from which I would 

have to read my speech. As I turned it on, its bright screen bathed my face in 

a bluish green light that made my admirers sigh and someone at the back stifled 

a shriek.

Down in the audience I saw Gayatri Devi lean over 

to her friend Mark-of-the-khaki-hat and whisper something that made them both 

giggle, the Taj?s scout duo were fidgeting with their portrait lense, Lord Ravensdale, 

Curzon?s what-you-may-call-it, Lady whachyemaycallher also related to Lord Curzon, 

minister from all over the North-East, Delhi and the chief minister, forest minister, 

power minister, all stared mesmerized by? by what I was saying ? When I ended 

my speech with the revelation that the world famous Lady Curzon turtle soup was 

in fact a recipe she pinched from mahout Nigona Shikari in 1905, in Kaziranga, 

I got a standing ovation from the only person that walked with two sticks for 

support, Lord Ravensdale. The others sat and clapped forever and the chief minister 

told his PA to remind him about a citation for me.

The following morning when the swelling on my face 

had reduced to my looking like a squash instead of a twisted gourd, I sat alone 

in the Wild Grass Inn with an old school buddy called Manju who was five when 

I left school and now looked like the twice-removed forty-second grand nephew 

of our Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, with a pepper ?n? salt beard to prove it. 

He had pulled up a chair next to mine and spoke hesitantly: ?Hey. I?m told you 

were great last night?. I looked at him. He meant it. Then from under his sweater 

he pulled out a book called Travel on my Elephant, by Mark Shand. ?He left 

very early this morning and told me I should give this to you personally?. I opened 

the book to read, ? With love, from Mark?. 

So, life doesn?t suck after all. And hey, some of 

those Brits are really nice guys. ?Did he leave you an address? Phone number?? 

I asked. Manju grinned quietly and shook his head. ?Listen,? he said, ?I want 

to invite you to come back here in the summer when there are no damn tourists. 

We can chat or? and perhaps you can write a book too.? Manju was a gem of the 

sort that is difficult to find. I thanked him.

As I drove through the jungles on my way back to the 

airport I wondered what it would be like to attend Prince Charles? wedding on 

the 8th of April. I was excited and had to find a way to get hold of Mark and 

ask him to invite us to his sister Camilla?s register-signing nuptials. I turned 

to ask my wife what she would wear. Her head was bobbing against the windowpane 

and her Samsung camera hung ready for action around her neck. She was fast asleep 

after having had to mollycoddle a demented husband whose narcissism had taken 

quite a knock. I gazed out of the window and felt the wind in my face. Tea leaves 

were sprouting in the gardens and the mallards and pintails and bar-headed geese 

in the sky had begun to head back to where they came from in Europe and Siberia. 

I loved Assam.

Then I caught the driver grinning and staring at my 

face in the rear view mirror?

 Leaves from a French evening

 The champagne glasses clinked as the smiles flowed, wan and welcoming. The evening at Oberoi Grand was a toast to an occasion close to the city?s cultural heart. 

 France is the theme country of this year?s Book Fair. And the French ambassador was playing host at a gathering that had a mix of art and commerce, francophiles and bibliophiles.

 Painters Paritosh Sen and Wasim Kapoor were there as was singer-actor Anjan Dutt. The publishing community was represented by Sudhangshusekhar Dey of Dey?s Publishing, Debajyoti Dutta of Shishu Sahitya Sansad, Badal Basu of Ananda Publishers and Kalyan Shah, president of Publishers and Booksellers Guild.

 But the most visible community was that of the French authors who have been flown down ? cartoonists Tignous, Jean-Yves Hamel and Michel Bridenne, and writers Christian Cailleaux, Veronique le Normand, Dominique Fernandez, Dominique Varma, Jean Marie Lafont, and, of course, Daniel Pennac (back in town after his book The Fairy Gunmother was launched here a couple of years ago) and Jean-Claude Carri?re.

 But there was more in store. Ambassador Dominique Girard was soon on the stage, speaking of growing proximity in Indo-French relations. The reflection of that in the arena of books, he said, lay in Rupa France, the first series of books to be brought out by an Indian publisher in association with the French embassy.

 The series, he pointed out, brought back in circulation translations of French titles that had almost gone out of reach of the Indian reader. For this initiative, R.K. Mehra of Rupa amp; Co was decorated chevalier de l?ordre de merite. The Calcutta-born publisher?s father, Girard reminded the gathering, was one of the founder-members of the Book Fair. The Rupa France series now has 21 titles. ?We will add more, including works of present-day authors,? Mehra promised.

 If there was one sore moment, it was the refusal of the murmuring voices to die down during the ambassador?s decoration speech. When adda and the Bengali come together, discipline and decorum perhaps part company.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It takes two for N-company 

 From the name game to the numbers game ? UDAY CHOPRA and TANISHAA are making a bold bid to stand up and be counted, says Pratim D. Gupta

 Uday Chopra and Tanishaa in Neal ?N? Nikki

 Two people who haven?t had a solo hit. Two people who have largely lived under the shadows of their siblings. Two people who need to prove their detractors wrong. Uday Chopra and Tanishaa are Neal ?N? Nikki.

 ?I don?t know why people are calling this a relaunch of my career,? asks Uday, who started out in the home production Mohabbatein, tasted success as Abhishek?s sidekick in another home production Dhoom and now hopes to go solo with yet another home production, Neal ?N? Nikki. ?We have tried something different with not only my look and character but the entire film.?

 For Tanishaa, who started with miserable films like Ssshhhh... and Popkorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao and whose greatest claim to fame is a five-minute cameo in Sarkar ? apart from, of course, being Kajol?s sister ? is perhaps banking more on the December 9 release than her co-star. ?Everything happens at the right time,? the actress says philosophically. ?I don?t look at things in hindsight and think what I should have done and what I shouldn?t have. At the moment, I feel great that I have done a film like Neal ?N? Nikki.?

 So who are Neal and Nikki? ?Neal closely resembles (director) Arjun (Sablok) in real life, especially his naughtiness,? laughs Uday. ?So I have blindly followed Arjun, tried to adopt his glad eye for girls. As far as the character goes, Neal belongs to this Punjabi family settled in Canada ? very Indian, very traditional. Now, he is set to get married to a Bhatinda girl and he?s got 21 days for his marriage. So in this period, he wants to be with as many women as possible.?

 Tanishaa?s Nikki Bakshi is sweet and sexy as the title track suggests but the actress believes the character goes much beyond that. ?She is the little girl in every woman. She is impulsive, crazy, emotional, hysterical... She is the embodiment of everything female. She is a little ball of power.?

 So did the two get the power parts thanks to their famous lineage? ?No, I auditioned for the film,? protests Uday. Tanishaa joins in. ?I never went to Yash Raj. They came to me asking to audition for the film.?

 Once she was through, Tanishaa was given the image makeover, which is the talk of tinsel town today. ?I just got two months ? I was cast in April and the film?s shooting began in June,? she reveals. ?So it wasn?t possible to lose a lot of weight in those two months. I became more toned, very disciplined.?

 Next, she got the look. ?Arjun had a very different look for me in mind,? explains Tanishaa. ?He wanted to give an international feel to the way I looked in the movie. So Arjun and I sat down with the hair dresser and make-up person and we came up with the look that?s Nikki Bakshi.?

 So how did Uday and Tanishaa get along in a film that?s all about chemistry, and that too physical. ?I have known Tanishaa for 12 years from the time she used to come to the sets of Yeh Dillagi which starred her sister and was our home production,? says Uday. ?We also kept in touch when we went abroad for studies.?

 As for Tanishaa, it was Uday who helped her to successfully slip into this overtly sexy image. ?He made me very comfortable on the sets,? she recalls. ?He is so focussed on his work that it allows you to be on the ball all the time.?

 So with just days to go for the film?s release, what do Neal and Nikki have to say? ?It?s anti-anything that has been done in Indian cinema,? feels Uday. Tanishaa is a touch more traditional. ?I know I am working for a production house where my sister got her biggest hit (DDLJ). I am just very excited.?

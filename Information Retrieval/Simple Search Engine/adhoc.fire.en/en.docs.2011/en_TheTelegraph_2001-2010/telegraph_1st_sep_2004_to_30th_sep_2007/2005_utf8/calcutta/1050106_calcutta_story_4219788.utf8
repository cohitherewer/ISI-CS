 You share your birthday with...

 Kapil Dev 

You?re charming and impressive. You have a balanced personality ? idealistic but practical, romantic yet sincere, attractive but loyal. Your home is your heaven. You should try to be more social and friendly. Sports and animals hold a special place in your heart. Steer clear of gambling. ? Kusum Bhandari

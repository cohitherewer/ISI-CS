 Fighting fire with fire

 Ankit Fadia, a representative of the new tech-savvy India, was in Calcutta recently to inaugurate Oxford Bookstore?s new IT club, Oxygen, and also to present his fourth book An Ethical Guide to Hacking of Mobile Phones, published by Macmillan.

 Ankit shot into the limelight some six years ago as the ethical hacker who had traced a Pakistani plot to deface an Indian government website. The whizkid (he was then just 14 and a student of Delhi Public School) went on to write the Unofficial Guide to Ethical Hacking over a 15-day stint in his summer holidays. The book became a bestseller and was followed by two more. With the recent media focus on scandals surrounding cell phones, the relevance of Ankit?s book is lost on none.

 Speaking about the book, Ankit (now 20) said his primary objective has been to show how with our increasing dependence on technology, various privacy concerns come into play. Mobile phone hackers can easily hack SIM cards, rob sensitive data, copy address books, intercept passwords, and, in short, invade every sphere of your life. This is because though the instrument ? initially used only to make voice calls and send the rare SMS ? functions today like a mini computer or even an office, few users have bothered to take the basic security measures.

 There is no way to stop hacking or cyber crime altogether, feels Ankit. What can be done is to ?treat fire with fire? by constantly ?updating your knowledge?. This book, which Ankit claims to be the world?s first on the subject, is ?a little early for Indian users?. But later, when all phones are Infrared and Bluetooth-enabled, they will know just how vulnerable their privacy is and will take adequate precautions.

 In an earlier book, Ankit had defined the distinction between hackers and crackers as ?nice people? who break into systems to show loopholes and provide solutions and the ?not so nice people? who crack passwords and deface websites for cheap publicity.

 So, in his latest book Ankit has no qualms in giving a step-by-step guide to hack into mobiles because he also provides the precautions one needs to take to prevent such an attack.

 Mobile hacking is comparatively new and there are ?only about 25 different forms?, says Ankit. He provides a detailed list of dos and don?ts for mobile phone users and suggests the use of Symantec Anti Virus for Handhelds, F Secure Mobile Anti Virus and MC Afee Virus Scan Mobile.

 But where does Ankit get all his information from? He did undertake a few courses, but he has depended largely on his own experiments, reading and interaction with underground hacking clubs in Delhi. He got his first PC when he was 11. By the time he was 12 he had already decided he wanted to be a hacker, having read a newspaper article on the subject.

 But what about the temptations of cracking? Wasn?t it hard to keep to the ethical path? ?Nah! There?s more fame and returns in being on the positive side of things,? laughed the ace.

 A recipient of many awards, Ankit today studies business engineering in Stanford University and has his own computer security firm in Singapore called Ankit Fadia Ventures. Shuttling from Stanford to Singapore to Mumbai (where his parents live), Ankit conducts classes for professionals and students. He assists the Indian government and US security agencies as well. But clicking on the latest in hacking is still his top priority.

 Medal for mission

 Principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls? Higher Secondary School Rashi Narula was feted earlier this month by the Central Board of Secondary Education at the CBSE Award to Teachers 2004 ceremony in New Delhi. In the profession for over 26 years, the resourceful English teacher was one of the 14 awardees selected from amongst nominations from across the country. ?I am elated,? she said, adding that the prestigious award would motivate her to work harder to make ?girl students more career-oriented?. The spirit of competition, she said, was lacking amongst schoolgirls in India. Having already introduced courses on fashion studies and informatics in her school, her aim is to add web-designing and multimedia to the list of subjects from next year.

 Winners all

 Samagam, the annual fest of Loreto College, last week saw a lot of action. In the Amal Ghatak quiz, Presidency College emerged the winner. JU was unanimously declared winner in Drama-trix for their brilliant dark comedy. The western music programme on the last day was a favourite, with a lot of variety from Ronan Keating to Def Leppard and the swinging 60s. Loreto emerged the overall winner of the fest, but in conformity with tradition, handed over the shield to runner-up St Xavier?s. Prize distribution was followed by a jamming session with guest band Blue Mist.

 A get-together for St Xavier?s College alumni will be organised in association with The Telegraph at the college on Saturday.

 Birla Industrial and Technological Museum will host the screening tests for the National Astronomy Olympiad 2005-06 to be held in November. Students from 13 to 15 years can take the test. Entry forms are available at BITM. The last date for registration is September 28. Contact 22892815, 22812654 or e-mail to bitmcal2.vsnl.net.in for details.

 Grasp the Globe, a quiz extravaganza, will be held at Pailan World School on September 27.

Fest therapy

 ?We are under a lot of pressure throughout the year. You will find us slipping out every now and then to catch up on our revising for a test scheduled right after this fest, ? said an animated Uddalok.

 It is doubtful though, just how far his good intentions hold since he is a third-year student, the batch that does the most running around for Calcutta Medical College?s festival Rhapsody.

 On Wednesday, Day One of the 59th annual bash, organised in association with The Telegraph, the Battle of the Bands, Made for Each Other and the photography competition were uppermost on the minds of Sanchali, Dhritiman, Annesha and others. The festive mood worked its magic even on the austere general lecture theatre, common room and the anatomy lecture theatre in the college.

 ?We are not the bookworms we are made out to be. We are crazy about quizzes and Bangla bands. This time we have Cactus, Fossils, Phoenix and Lakkhichhara... And even a discotheque session with DJ Ravi!? gushed one very young medico from his desktop perch. So, even as the scientific paper presentation went on, the quizzing teams from Indira Gandhi National Open University, Juggernaut (a JU, Presidency mixed group) and Calcutta Medical College broke an extended sixth round tie-breaker for the first, second and third prizes, respectively.

 The Battle of the Bands (picture below by Amit Datta) was overwhelming, with the hall packed with a lusty cheering crowd. One was reminded that even Siddhartha of Cactus and Palash Sen of Euphoria hail from a medical college background.

 The band to make it to the top was Elixir, the IEM team. Raaga came second singing Fossil?s Etota path hetechhi and Cicatrix, the team from Presidency, came third. Besides certificates and cash awards, winners will get the chance to perform at Caf? Coffee Day and Power FM.

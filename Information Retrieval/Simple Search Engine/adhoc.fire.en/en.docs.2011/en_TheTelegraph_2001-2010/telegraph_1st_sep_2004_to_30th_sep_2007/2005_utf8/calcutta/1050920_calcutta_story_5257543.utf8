 Musical interchange

 The last century had nurtured some of the greatest stalwarts of Hindustani music who could strike the right balance between tradition and evolution, and, at the same time, were successful in creating unique musical styles. Of late, though, there has been a gradual shift in performance practices, attitudes of artistes and expectations of the audience, which has definitely resulted in a crisis of sorts that needs to be identified and addressed. Hosted by ITC Sangeet Research Academy, The Crossroads ? an Interactive Seminar on Hindustani Raag Sangeet: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, will witness several sessions of brainstorming and focussed discussions that aim to delve into our rich musical heritage, talk about the present, discover new paths for future generations to adopt, and thus, promise to work towards bringing back the old magic into raag sangeet. At the seminar, moderators will pose questions to 18 panelists comprising eminent Indian musicians, scholars and media personalities. Truly interactive in nature, the event also offers the audience an opportunity to share their views.

 Event: An interactive seminar on Hindustani raag sangeet

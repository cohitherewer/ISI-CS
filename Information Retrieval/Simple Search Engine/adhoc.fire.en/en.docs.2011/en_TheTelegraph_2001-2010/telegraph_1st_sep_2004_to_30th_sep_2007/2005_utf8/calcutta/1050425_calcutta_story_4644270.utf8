December 2004, Ferns and Petals, a national flower boutique chain upped the shutters of their first franchisee outlet in Calcutta at 8/1 Loudon Street. It gave the city flower boutique a new dimension. Miles away from the old-world charm of flower row in New Market, this air-conditioned channel music-aided outlet is the one-stop shop for flower shopping.

 With 35 outlets across India, the only one in Calcutta enjoys a strong support system from its national parent, giving it the edge in terms of stock over the local florists.

 HOME FRONT

 Calcutta?s demonstrative ? and decorative ? side is coming out to full effect and the result is a steady flow of loyal clientele to this flower boutique with demands to create personalised flower arrangements using a host of ingredients, from fresh flowers to coloured pebbles, glass planters to ceramic pots.

 ?A reason why Calcutta welcomed us with open arms is because we cater to the entire gamut of needs in the flower segment. At our store, one can pick from fresh and dried flowers and a range of accessories needed to do up an arrangement. So a homemaker might end up buying a few things to make a personal arrangement, or even order an arrangement that we can create according to his or her taste,? says Indira Agarwal of Ferns and Petals.

 Be sure to find everything from planters to pots, crystal flowers to candles and pot pourri ? just about anything you might need for the perfect bouquet.

 FORTUNE FIG

 Who doesn?t want Lady Luck shining all her charm on the home or office? Popular belief based in Feng Shui has now led a host of Calcuttans to do up their homes with fortune plants or lucky bamboo as they are called.

 ?Unlike the plants available in Feng Shui shops, we sell potted plants that can be watered and grown,? adds Indira. From The Park hotel to a host of corporate houses and private homes, this green, leafy option is quickly rising on the sales chart in Ferns and Petals. 

 OCCASIONS

 From Valentine?s Day to weddings, saying it with flowers is the pop safe option. ?On Valentine?s Day we had people queuing up to write out messages to send with flowers and gifts to various parts of the world, and most of them didn?t keep it restricted to their partners. From bosses to grandmoms everyone received some flowers,? smiles Indira. 

 Indeed, with a network spanning 68 cities across the globe, the chain is likely to send your delicate buds to just about anywhere you would like.

 Teen turns 32 waiting for justice

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Souvik Bhowmik, alias Prince, was 15 then. He is 32 now. It has taken 17 years for his murder trial to begin in the juvenile court.

 On February 29, 1988, Raj Kumar Jaiswal was killed during a clash between two groups at Hartukitola, under Burtola police station. Four youths ? Narayan, Betia, Nepali and Prince ? were arrested in this connection.

 The trial of the other three accused began in the city sessions court, while Prince?s case was sent to the juvenile court after a medical test report showed him to be 15.

 For years, Prince would be produced in court at regular intervals, only to be sent back, in the absence of a judge in the juvenile court. 

 Finally, on Monday, Durga Khaitan Das, newly-appointed judge of the juvenile court, brought the lengthy wait to an end and began the trial.

 In December 1991, the city sessions court held Narayan, Betia and Nepali guilty of the Jaiswal murder and slapped them with a life sentence.

 Prince?s case dragged on for two reasons ? there was no judge in the juvenile court to conduct the trial, and the case record, lying with Calcutta High Court, had not been sent to the juvenile court. The case record had been brought to high court following Prince?s petition that the proceedings against him be quashed.

 It took eight years for the case record to travel the distance from high court to juvenile court. When it did finally reach, there was no judge in the juvenile court to make use of it.

 As Prince waited, Narayan, Betia and Nepali moved high court. Their appeal lay pending for 12 years and Betia died in custody.

 In 2003, after hearing the petition of Narayan and Nepali, the high court observed that Jaiswal?s death was culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced the two to 10 years? imprisonment.

 As they had already spent more than 10 years behind bars, Narayan and Nepali were released. Prince, the youngest among the accused, then moved high court again. 

 His lawyer, Rabi Shankar Chatterjee, stressed his client?s right to live properly and demanded that his trial begin immediately.

 The high court, in its order last year, directed the juvenile court to start Prince?s trial within six months.

 Six months after the high court order, the juvenile court finally got its act together and Prince did not have to return to Presidency jail without being heard.

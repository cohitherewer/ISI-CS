 How to build a robot

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Spreading awareness about and creating interest in robotics is on the crowded agenda of IIT Kharagpur. And to that end, the robotics team of the premier institute conducted a workshop at the Science City auditorium on Sunday.

 The workshop, Wanna Make a Robot, was a prelude to the annual IIT Kharagpur techno-management fest Kshitij, and was aimed at Calcutta college students.

 ?The idea behind the workshop was to brief students in a very simple manner about every major and minor aspect of making a robot,? said Sanchayan Chakraborty, a third-year student of IIT Kharagpur.

 Besides being briefed on the techniques and considerations that come into play while building a robot, the students were informed about the various robotics events that would be taking place in Kshitij ?06.

 Kshitij, one of the largest techno-management shows in Southeast Asia, expects over 7,000 participants in the 2006 edition. Ivy Leaguers Stanford and MIT have already confirmed their participation in Mission Mars, one of the events.

 ?NASA has decided to use the event to explore the belt of asteroids that lie between Mars and Jupiter, and the Martian surface itself. Tech students from the various institutes in India are going to battle it out against what MIT and Stanford have to offer,? said Kapish Saraf, another third-year student.

 ?We want to develop an interactive platform that would give the students of eastern India a chance to hone their skills,? said Sanchayan.

 The robotics team of IIT Kharagpur has participated in robotics competitions around the globe. And under the guidance of faculty members, it has now decided to conduct workshops throughout eastern India. 

 ?After Calcutta, we are moving to Durgapur, Dhanbad and Rourkela,? said Manish Giri, another member of the team. Going by the numbers in the spacious auditorium, the workshop was quite a success. 

 ?People often have this misconception that in order to participate in a robotics event, they need a huge amount of technical knowhow. We are out to disprove that,? concluded Manish.

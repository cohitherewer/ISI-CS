The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Freeze off, it?s diesel for diesel

 - LPG outlets too few, taxis too many: Officials

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 After promising to replace diesel taxis in the city with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)-driven ones, it?s back to diesel for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government.

 On Thursday, it lifted a three-month ban on the replacement of old diesel taxis with diesel vehicles. Bharat Stage II-compliant diesel cabs can now replace the 500 old, diesel taxis plying in the city and suburbs.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty gave the go-ahead to taxi-owners? unions at a meeting at Writers? Buildings. Representatives of the Calcutta Taxi Association, Bengal Taxi Association, Hindustan Motors and major auto financiers were present. 

 The department officials claimed that the change of stand was forced by the paucity of auto LPG-dispensing outlets around Calcutta.

 ?We had frozen the replacement of old taxis with diesel vehicles for the past three months and were planning to make LPG-run vehicles mandatory. However, with only five auto LPG-dispensing outlets functioning in the city, it is not possible to support the 36,000 taxis operating in and around Calcutta,? said a transport department official.

 However, the ban on issue of permits to new diesel taxis stays in place, he added.

 The government has been severely criticised for failing to comply with the high court order on meeting tail-pipe emission norms prescribed by the Centre.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdury said: ?We had promised the court that we would clean up the air in the city. Even BS II diesel vehicles are fully capable of meeting tail-pipe emission norms laid down by the Centre.?

 Chowdhury added that this was the best option available to the department, since the oil companies hadn?t set up LPG outlets in Howrah and North and South 24-Parganas, where a substantial number of taxis ply. 

 The transport department has asked the taxi unions to place their orders with the vehicle manufacturer by March 15.

 ?This is because the new BS II-compliant vehicles will not be accepted after April 1, when BS III norms come into effect. Post-March, all new vehicles will have to be BS III-compliant. Therefore, we have to register these diesel taxis before March 25,? explained a department official.

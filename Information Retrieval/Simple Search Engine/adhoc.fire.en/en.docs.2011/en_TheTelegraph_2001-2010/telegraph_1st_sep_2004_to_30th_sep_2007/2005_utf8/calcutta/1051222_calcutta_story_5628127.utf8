 The history of the relationship between the state and the terrorist has always been one of ambiguous conflicts, while innocent civilians have continued to suffer. Staged as part of Nandikar?s ongoing 22nd National Theatre Festival, Babli highlights the mental torment that ordinary, culpable individuals go through when caught up in its frenzy. The young, eponymous protagonist of the play is faced with existential questions as she encounters a clash of identities, ideals and philosophies from different people who fill up the spectrum of her precariously poised life. In her desperate attempt to move on, she is trapped between the known world of her parents and her fianc?, Rohit, and the unknown, mysterious world of Korak and Arijit. The play confronts us with her problems and queries and the choices she is set to make, as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery within her life and the time that she must exist in. Written by Bratya Basu. Direction: Anirban Bhattacharya.

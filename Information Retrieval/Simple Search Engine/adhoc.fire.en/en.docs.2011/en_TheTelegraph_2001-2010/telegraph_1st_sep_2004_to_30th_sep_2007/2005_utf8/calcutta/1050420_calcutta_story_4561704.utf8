Sip on your Black Forest Cappuccino or Cold Mocha while listening to Bob Dylan, tuck into your Chocolate Truffle Pastries and Manhattan Brownies while watching a documentary on contemporary Bengali music or pick up a piece of art or junk jewellery created by an artiste in need. All this and more, under one roof.

 The new-age coffee shops, besides dishing out a delectable menu and creating a cosy cauldron for lovebirds, are turning into major hubs of activity. From fashion shows to art exhibitions and caf? theatre to band performances, these swanky hangouts are sparing no effort to attract the young and adventurous.

 ?Youngsters nowadays enjoy more decision making and spending power, forcing major brands to target their marketing strategies at them,? says Saket Agarwal of Aqua Java. ?So if you want to get your message across or influence a big group of youngsters, there is no better place than a coffee shop,? he adds.

 Caf? Coffee Day and Coffee Pai play host to a lot of caf? theatre, which is an established concept in the West. ?A coffee shop should go beyond being the typical food-and-beverage outlet and offer other elements stand out,? feels Naveen Pai of Coffee Pai. The coffee shop has done workshops on disc jockeying and art exhibitions in the past few months.

 ?Unlike nightclubs and high-end restaurants, coffee shops are accessible to everybody. So it makes sense to host such activities to grab the attention of a bigger group,? adds Pai.

 Some, like Aqua Java and Caffeine, have also been promoting new bands. ?Caffeine introduced Alternative Fridays starting Poila Baisakh for which we were approached,? says Rahul Guha Roy of rock band Cassini?s Division. ?It really helps us to concentrate exclusively on alternative rock with a strong emphasis on original music,? adds Rahul.

 The Camac Street outlet of Aqua Java recently played host to an informal chat between teachers, students and parents discussing the present syllabi and its impact on children. According to event manager Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee, these places are best to educate the youth about culture and take them through various issues plaguing the younger generation. ?We need to focus on subjects like drugs, HIV awareness and nationalism,? feels Sujoy.

 Some would argue that the activities are more out of compulsion than concern. ?No matter how swanky your coffee shop is, there will always be shortcomings,? offers Rajdeep Ghoshal of Caffeine. ?You cannot serve a full-fledged meal and the time available to retain the attention of the customer is limited to a cup of coffee or at the most, a sandwich. People in India, unlike in the West, have not been able to realise that a coffee shop can be a community centre and the lifeline of a particular area,? rues Ghoshal.

 Band performances and exhibitions have been a regular affair at the Elgin Road address. But starting May, leading designers would showcase their creations every month. ?The location, crowd and the interiors with long passages work in our favour for hosting a fashion show,? observes Ghoshal.

 And it?s sure to keep the visitor in the coffee shop, he hopes, for a little longer than just the quick sip--bite.

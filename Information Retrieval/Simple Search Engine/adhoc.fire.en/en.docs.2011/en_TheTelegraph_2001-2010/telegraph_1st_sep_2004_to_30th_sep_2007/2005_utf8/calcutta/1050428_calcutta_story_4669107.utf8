The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CMC broom to sweep off cut fruits, fight diarrhoea

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The count so far is five in the two weeks. And that includes two children. 

 Alarmed at the outbreak of diarrhoea, especially in Ekbalpore and Kidderpore, mayor Subrata Mukherjee ordered a regular drive till the polls in mid-June against the sale of exposed cut fruits, lassi and sharbet from Thursday. He has also requested chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for police aid during the drive, amid open criticism of their role.

 The CMC has also decided to launch an awareness campaign through billboards against consumption of these articles being sold on the city pavements. 

 Since tests on water samples collected from Ekbalpore and Kidderpore had revealed nothing alarming, the civic health officials, after visiting the areas, concluded that cut fruits and coloured sharbets sold on the pavements were to blame for the outbreak of diarrhoea there.

 Councillors of the affected areas ? Faiyaz Khan, Rama Bose and Ilias Islahi ? requested the civic authorities to take action as their consumption would go up as the mercury shoots in the weeks to come. 

 While charting out the future course of action, blame for past inaction is being laid at the doors of the police. Member, mayor-in-council, health, Amiya Mukherjee alleged that the cops were behind the hide-and-seek game between the cut-fruit vendors and civic officials during the earlier drives.

 The mayor too held that Calcutta would have been free from pavement encroachments if the police were ?a little sincere towards city?s well-being?.

 The civic officials are undaunted by past experience, though. This time it will be a joint drive of the civic health and the conservancy department, informs chief municipal health officer (CMOH) Atanu Mukherjee. 

 ?We have divided duty in the 15 borough areas among the 31 food inspectors. They have orders to destroy cut fruits, coloured sharbet and lassi found on sale on the pavements by mixing bleaching powder on the spot.? More food inspectors have been mobilised in the Kidderpore-Ekbalpore area.

 Over 70 kg of cut-fruits had been destroyed by the conservancy department in the past two months, said deputy director, conservancy, Swapan Mahapatra.

 ?We must get the vendors off the streets immediately,? a health official said. ?Otherwise, the problem may spin out of control.?

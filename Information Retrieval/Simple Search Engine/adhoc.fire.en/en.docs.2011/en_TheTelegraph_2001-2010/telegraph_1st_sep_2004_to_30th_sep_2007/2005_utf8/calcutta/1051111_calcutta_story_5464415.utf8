The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?You can?t lift for a film like this?

 Why Umrao Jaan will mark a new musical chapter, why he has a point to prove to Jagjit Singh, why Santiniketan beckons... Pratim D. Gupta lets ANU MALIK do the talking

and as Umrao Jaan 

 How come you are suddenly in love with Calcutta?

 I don?t know. When I went for the Indian Idol 2 auditions this time, I found the city has changed. It?s really happening, which wasn?t the case last year. I have always said that music is in the veins of Calcuttans and I could see that this time. We have got some great talents from the city.

But most of the contestants found you very rude?

 I was just being point blank. It?s very difficult to please me. I know they all get gussa at me. They become desperate and sometimes they refuse to leave the audition centre. But, come on, this is about the next Indian Idol here. You are getting crores of money and cars and becoming stars overnight. So I have to look for more than the XYZ factors. I am just being true to my profession. 

 Shayari karta hoon, shayari karoonga, Indian Idol chun raha hoon, Sach se na daroonga.

Were you under any obligation from Sony to use 

Indian Idol singers for Shaadi No. 1?

 No, I used them because I think they are good. Rahul Vaidya and Prajakta Shukray have sung in Shaadi No. 1 and it?s out there for the world to hear how well they have sung.

You yourself are singing a lot of songs these days?

 Yes, only because I thought I suited the songs and the makers thought the same. I have sung for Akshay (Kumar) and Shahid (Kapur) in Deewane Huye Paagal.

What other films do you have in your kitty?

 At this point of time in my life, I am only looking forward to J.P. Dutta?s Umrao Jaan. I am telling you this film will be the start of a new musical chapter in my life. Now that JPsaab has signed Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan, all eyes will be on me as to what kind of music I will produce. 

 This is no war film like Border or Refugee. It will be tough for me because Pakeezah and the original Umrao Jaan have already come out.

Are you planning to use some famous ghazal?

 I can?t do that. You can?t lift from any source for a film like this. I have to come up with my own ghazals which will have my own stamp. Everyone from Ghulam Ali to Ashaji to Khayyam saab are waiting to hear what kind of ghazals I can dish out. I want Jagjit Singh to listen to my ghazal and think how can Anu Malik create something like this. It?s a big, big challenge.

Ashaji was the voice for Rekha in the original 

Umrao Jaan. Who will be your voice for Aishwarya Rai?

 Main Alka (Yagnik) se gawa raha hoon. When I was making my first ghazal, I immediately could see her singing that and that was it.

Last time you were in Calcutta you wanted to use 

Rabindrasangeet in your songs. What happened to that?

 I love Rabindranath Tagore. My father (music director Sardar Malik) keeps talking about him. I also like Nazrul Islam?s songs. What melody! I really want to go to Santiniketan next time I am in Calcutta. I have never been there.

Now that the copyright over Tagore songs is off, 

why don?t you use the melodies in your songs?

 Hmmm? Do you think Bengalis will accept my use of Rabindrasangeet?

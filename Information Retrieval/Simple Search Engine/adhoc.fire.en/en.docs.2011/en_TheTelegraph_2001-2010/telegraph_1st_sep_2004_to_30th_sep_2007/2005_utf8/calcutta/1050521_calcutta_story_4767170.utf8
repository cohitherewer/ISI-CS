The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 2 kids die in cave-in

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three-year-old Asish Dutta of Shyampukur and 13-year-old Payal Tambin of Beniatola were killed when a portion of a boundary wall of an abandoned Metro Railway building at 324, CR Avenue, collapsed around 7.30 pm on Friday.

 The child was crossing CR Avenue with his parents, and so was Payal. Suddenly, a portion of the boundary wall came crashing down on the little boy. Even before Asish?s father Tarun could pull him aside, the boy was trapped. 

 Witnesses said his parents, too, were seriously injured.

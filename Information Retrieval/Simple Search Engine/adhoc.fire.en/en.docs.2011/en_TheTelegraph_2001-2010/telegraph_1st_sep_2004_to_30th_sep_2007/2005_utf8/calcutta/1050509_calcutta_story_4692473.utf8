 Anshu Modi: trousseau treasures

 LIFESTYLE ZONE 

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 A trudge down a nondescript lane in Ekbalpore leads you to a treasure trove of couture, tucked away for the last 24 years with all its opulence. 

 This sprawling 3,000 sq-ft store, which outshines most other designer studios in the city with its plush and luxurious interiors, has been quietly catering to a select clientele across the globe, shunning the limelight much in the same manner as the lady behind the show. 

 Specialising in wedding wear for both men and women, designer Anshu Modi has been creating for ?elite? clients all over India and abroad. Yet she has made it a point to stay away from ?promotions and fashion shows?, concentrating strictly on her business pursuits. 

 ?I am not much of a show person. I only participate in bridal shows in Jakarta, Dubai and other places in West Asia where I have a sizeable clientele,? she reveals.

 From lehngas, saris and bridal totes to sherwanis, kurtas and jootis, Modi addresses complete wedding wardrobe needs. ?I create total wedding wardrobes for both the bride and the groom, including trousseau and honeymoon wear. This is done by appointments mostly,? adds Modi.

 Bridal bonanza

 Lehngas are the mainstay of the bridal collection at Anshu Modi. While for the final-day attire Modi prefers to work by appointments, theres a wide range of exquisitely embroidered lehngas on offer off the rack. A variety of silks, jamevar, georgette and crepe, textured by her weavers in Varanasi and Ahmedabad, shape the lehngas. Hand-embroidery of various kinds, including zardosi, form the main embellishments, touched up with coloured stones, Swarovski, gotah, sequins and metal pieces. 

 The motifs are mostly antique, hunted out by the designer through constant research. ?I have always been interested in history. In fact, I have done my masters in history. I draw inspiration from the workmanship of the Mughal, Pala and Chola dynasties and often use those motifs in my work,? she explains.

 Her interest in old-world charm, however, hasnt robbed her creations of modernity. A line of fusion ghagras paired with corsets and cowl-neck tops bear western influences too. 

 The lehngas start at Rs 50,000 and go up to a weighty Rs 2.5 lakh. 

 Saris for all occasions share rack space with lehngas, as do a limited line of salwars. Trousseau saris hand-embroidered with heavy resham work, kantha and chikan are adorned with pearls, stones, gotah and tikkas, while the lighter cocktail-wear kind bear prints and machine embroidery. The saris start around Rs 15,000 and go up to as much as Rs 1 lakh.

 Western wows

 Modis forte is clearly ethnic, but she has started dabbling with some western silhouettes too. The idea here is to blend Indian craft forms with western cuts. 

 A line of ponchos and knee-length kaftans in crepe, georgette and chiffon, with jamevar patches, steal the show. Limited lines of skirts, tops, trousers and kurtis are western, yet very ethnic. These start at Rs 3,500.

 Groom goodies

 This section is primarily dominated by well-cut elegant sherwanis in subtle hues. Chikan and zardosi work combined with sequins and stones adorn the jamevar pieces. While these start at around Rs 40,000, a range of lighter linen sherwanis is priced from Rs 10,000 onwards. 

 Also on offer are mens kurtas with the same kinds of embroidery and embellishments. Groom-wear sherwanis and kurtas are designed by appointment also.

 Home linen

 The opulence of Modis ensembles extends to a line of home linen. Bedroom sets complete with bedspreads, pillow covers, cushion covers and rugs bear the same style of work. 

 Kantha, zardosi, patchwork, embroidered panels and prints adorn the textured raw silk pieces. The colours here are as vibrant and the work as intricate as the couture section. 

 The price point starts at Rs 2,500 for a single bedspread and goes up to Rs 30,000 for a bedroom set.

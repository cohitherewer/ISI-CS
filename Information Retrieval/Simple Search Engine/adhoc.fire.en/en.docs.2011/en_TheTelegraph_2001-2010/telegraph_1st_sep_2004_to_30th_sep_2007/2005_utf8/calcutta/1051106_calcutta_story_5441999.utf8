 For fat files to fly

 For the past half-an hour, Neha has been trying in vain to email a video clip of her birthday celebrations to her brother in the UK.

 She had thought that the super-fast broadband connection and her giant Gmail or Yahoo! accounts would make it a breeze. Till she realised that the video file was 11 MB in size, a little over the 10 MB limit that both allow for attachments.

 Enter YouSendIt.com to save the day for Neha and anyone else who needs to send large files fast. It?s safe and hassle-free, too.

 The service is free, requires no registration and allows files of up to 1 GB in size. File sending is easy and requires only three steps.

 Type the email address of the recipient(s).

 Choose the file you want to send by browsing and selecting from your PC.

 Hit the Send button.

 The recipient receives a link to the file ? for instance, http://s38.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=14FWGCAT7 ? which is stored in the YouSendIt server.

 Any type of file ? document, video, music, photo ? can be shared through the service. The files are stored for seven days or 25 downloads, whichever is earlier, and then deleted.

 Another such file sending service is Mytempdir.com. The process of choosing and sending the file is similar to YouSendIt.com. Though the file is stored for a longer period ? 14 days ? the maximum file size is 30 MB.

 Dropload.com also offers options to send files up to 100 MB in size and stores them for a week. One needs to sign in for an account, though.

 Besides these dedicated services, the Gmail account can also be used to store and share files, although the process is a little complicated. A piece of software called Gmail Drive (www.viksoe.dk/ code/gmail.htm) creates a virtual file system around the Gmail account.

 It adds another drive to the computer that can be accessed from Windows Explorer for sending and retrieving files.

 Google, however, periodically restructures Gmail?s login procedure to break the software?s ability to work.

 And for smaller than 10 MB attachments, good ol? Gmail and Yahoo! accounts are always there.

 Takeover Tagore school seeks CM help

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Distressed members of Baitanik ? set up by Soumendranath Tagore, grandson of Dwijendranath Tagore, at his house on Elgin Road ? have decided to call on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to voice concern about the state of affairs in the music school.

 On Thursday evening, the members decided in a meeting that Bhattacharjee would be informed about the recent attempt of Monoranjan Panda, a former member, to take over a museum in the building housing the school.

 Panda, who stays in the building, put up a copper nameplate of Sushanta Ghosh, minister of state for labour, outside one of the rooms, before locking it.

 Baitanik members said that Panda was offered shelter in the house after he came to the city from his village in Midnapore and requested for a place to live. 

 He had wanted to study and was accordingly offered a quarter at the back of the building.

 This was in lieu of his service to the music school. Panda was responsible for looking after the house and collecting subscriptions from students. He later moved into one of the rooms on the ground floor, a member said. 

 ?We allowed him to do so in good faith,? explained Amit Das, secretary of the Soumendranath Tagore Memorial Committee.

 The members alleged that during the last Puja vacation, when the school was closed for a month, Panda built a structure in the small slice of land between the house and its boundary wall without taking permission. 

 He refused to provide any explanation for his action.

 On Sunday, members found that Panda had put up a copper nameplate of the minister outside the museum on the first floor of the building and had locked the room.

 When the members broke into the room the next day, they found that some of the museum pieces were broken and destroyed. Some others were lying on the ground. 

 The members approached the police for help, at which Panda returned the keys.

 The nameplate has subsequently gone missing. Minister Ghosh said from Delhi that he would look into the matter once he returned to the city.

 ?We would seek the chief minister?s support to demolish the illegal construction on the premises. We will also inform Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about how the name of one of his ministers had surfaced in the controversy,? said secretary Das. 

 Panda has gone missing from the house from Thursday. Locals claimed that around 8.30 am, he left with his wife Ratna and two children.

 Bhowanipore police deployed two men outside the house on Thursday.

 It was a sons tribute to his father. It was also a celebration of the rhythm of life. In a grand ceremony that drew some of the big names in Indian classical music, the 70th birthday of Pandit Shankar Ghosh was celebrated on Thursday evening.

 The tabla maestro who had never cut a single birthday cake before, suddenly found himself blowing out candles at the glittering Taj Bengal banquets do.

 The big get-together, secretly planned by son Bikram and daughter-in-law Jaya, also saw the launch of a special four-CD album of the very best of Ghoshs performances, from 1962 to 2001, titled A Life in Rhythm. Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi unveiled the musical compilation.

 But what really made the evening come alive were the lively presentations by some great names from the world of arts.

 Sarod maestro Pandit Buddhadeb Dasgupta, who has played with Ghosh for four decades, opened the homage hour labelling his tabla play a blend of suspense and surprise. His repertoire consists of unmatched wit, Dasgupta added. Through his tabla he can tell detailed stories and make his presence felt even as an accompanist.

 Thespian Soumitra Chatterjee, who spent many an idle hour with Ghosh at the All India Radio office where they worked together, recalled how Ghoshs guru Pandit Gyan Prakash Ghosh had predicted that this particular student would go a long way.

 Pandit Vijay Kichlu, who refers to Ghosh as Shankarda despite being five years senior to him, shared unknown facts about the man, like his singing prowess. That not only makes him a complete musician but a real maestro, he observed.

 Eminent vocalist Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty expressed his admiration for Ghoshs ability to see the entire spectrum of time in his tabla recitals.

 Popular singer Srikanta Acharya shared Ghoshs jibanmukhi songwriting skills with the amused audiences.

 Bikram raised the emotional notch of the evening by saluting his father for the emancipation and exploration of the instrument called tabla.

 Trio tunes

 Around 15,000 to 20,000 people gather outside Science City with big dreams of big success, to audition for Sony Entertainment Televisions second talent hunt reality show, Fame Gurukul.

 From Bhutan to Bihar, Tibet to Tollygunge, the crowd count starts growing since 5 in the morning. By 9 am, the crowd becomes uncontrollable and police resort to lathicharge... 

 That was on May 6. Fast forward to October 14 and you find three finalists of Fame Gurukul ? Ruprekha Banerjee, Rex DSouza and Qazi Touqeer ? performing at the just-opened Gariahaat Mall.

 The three have made it to the final slot after surviving several danger zones. A one-week wait will reveal the final Fame Jodi.

 The trio took guard at 5 in the evening and entertained the crowd for a good 90 minutes.

 First to take the stage was Bengali girl Ruprekha, who started her performance with Mangta hai kya act from Rangeela. Her repertoire also included Jiya jale from Dil Se and current rage Kajra re from Bunty Aur Babli. 

 Its a wonderful feeling to receive so much adulation from ones own folks, gushed Ruprekha.

 Up next was Rex, who entertained the crowd with the remixed Bin tere sanam and Woh lamhey from Zeher.

 Some of the loudest cheers were reserved for Qazi. This guy has been a real survivor. He was in the danger zone 10 times, but survived because people of the country voted for him. His act is a big hit, says a spokesperson for RGV Events, the event management company co-ordinating the event.

 The boy from Kashmir had the girls drooling over his locks, his cool dude attitude... and his vocal chords.

Akar Prakar at Hindustan Park played host to an evening of music and dance with a social message last Saturday. 

 Organised by Sanlaap, a human rights organisation that works primarily with violence against women and children, in association with Sanved, the cultural wing of Sanlaap, the meet turned out to be an audio-visual delight. 

 The evening began with a generous donation of computers by Amar PC to the Sanlaap shelter. A computer education course was added to Sanlaap?s programmes in early 2004 that covers keyboard training (touch typing) and Microsoft Office programmes. 

 ?Many of the girls have no formal education and yet nearly all of them are able to identify English alphabets. Computer education helps boost their self-confidence,? says Laura Price, a mentor at Sanlaap.

 The Restoration of Innocence campaign unfolded next. This is a partnership between percussionist Tanmoy Bose and actress June to raise greater public awareness around fundamental issues involved in child trafficking and prostitution.

 The first sequence in the show presented a rendition of Taal Tantra?s Rivulets of Innocence by the young girls of Sanved.

 The second act was an auditory experience with Tanmoy Bose and other members of Taal Tantra performing a piece characterised by various percussion and body sounds.

 The last lap was a debut performance by Bharatanatyam exponent Arupa Lahiry who portrayed the empowerment of women through her own interpretation of a Taal Tantra composition, Flight of Freedom.

 Choreographed by Sohini Chakraborty, the event showcased the role of music and movement therapy as a vehicle for physical and emotional healing.

 A large benefit concert has also been scheduled for Winter 2005, that will feature Taal Tantra and other artistes from beyond the borders.

 Ethnic charm

 Your search for ethnic and traditional formal and semi-formal wear ends at Palki, the designer boutique situated at 149A, Bakul Bagan Road.

 The south Calcutta address boasts a huge range of formals, semi-formals, casuals, traditional and fusion wear for women.

 Whether you are attending a marriage or tying the knot yourself, Palki is a great stop when it comes to shopping for the occasion. Besides, the boutique has a sizeable collection of party wear as well.

 Bright colours with ornate designs and fine embroidery highlight the saris and lehngas here. 

 You?ve got another reason to check out the stuff if you want to avail of the 20 per cent discount at the boutique. The discount period that started on February 28 continues for another week. 

 Glitters

 How does a jewellery store celebrate spring? By bringing the colours into their gems and jewels, of course. Jewel Co, a jewellery outlet at HHI, is celebrating Vasant Utsav with a new line of jewellery and attractive discounts on the making charge. 

 The new line is lighter and brighter in keeping with the mood of the season, ?Colour is a rage everywhere now and the trend is reflected in jewellery,? says owner Nikunj Lodha. 

 From bright pinks to reds, yellows, purples and greens ? the range of precious coloured stones have been co-ordinated to create contemporary designs with a hint of tradition in some of the pieces.

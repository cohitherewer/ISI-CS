 Plain nerves, claim cops

 - Police play down extortion angle in cell shop murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The day after the daylight murder of 30-year-old Reshmi Mahnot, in a mobile phone outlet at Lake Terrace, police appeared to be playing down the extortion angle. 

 Instead, they pinned the blame on a ?new gang of robbers? that had ?accidentally? killed the woman while raiding the store.

 ?It appears that Wednesday?s attack was an act of miscreants who are new to the city?s crime world. They had planned to loot either cash or mobile phones. But when Reshmi Mahnot tried to raise an alarm on seeing the revolver, the goons probably lost their nerve and pulled the trigger by mistake,? said an officer of Lake police station.

 Reacting to the shocking ?mobile? murder, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at Writers? Buildings on Thursday: ?I have received a report on the incident; it is under investigation.?

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department-I), overseeing the probe, said the robbery aspect could not be ruled out. 

 ?Especially since none of the victim?s family members has told us anything about a demand from extortionists,? he elaborated.

 Accusing the police of a cover-up, residents blocked Lansdowne Road in front of National High School for Girls on Thursday evening.

 ?We saw a convoy of police cars parked along Lake Terrace, where the shop is located. They spent hours here and then went to Lake police station. But what has been their output till Thursday night?? demanded Sumit Mukherjee, one of the demonstrators.

 Police detained a number of persons with criminal antecedents. ?Nine persons are being interrogated to find leads,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Sleuths also picked up 13 persons from the south, port and eastern suburban divisions for interrogation. ?No effective lead has emerged yet,? admitted Singh.

 Among the points the police are highlighting to run down the extortion theory is that none of the four youths had stated any sum of money.

 Witness accounts have also been conflicting, with one saying he had seen a goon carrying a big-shopper. But key witness Salma Khatoon maintained that none of the youths was carrying a bag.

 However, if it was a robbery raid, rather than an extortion bid, why didn?t the assailants not pocket any of the cell phones on the counter?

 Also, why would a new gang of robbers target such a crowded location with a lone exit point?

 Members of Pakistani band Jal during rehearsals 

 The DJs are tired of playing it every night and the RJs are fed up of the same ol? request. But there?s no sign of Zeher?s Woh lamhey climbing down the popularity charts. And now you can actually get to hear the (supposed) creators of the song, live.

 Jal, the Pakistani band behind the song, is coming to Mumbai on May 9 for its first Indian concert on the 13th.

 The album featuring the song, titled Original Lamhey, is already out on HOM records and the music video is all over the airwaves. ?We released the album on April 25 and the response has been overwhelming,? says Sajid Maklai, A amp;R (artiste and repertoire) manager of HOM records. ?We expect the sales figures to go up once Jal arrives in Mumbai to perform.?

 Atif Aslam, whom the Zeher soundtrack credits as singer-composer of Woh lamhey, was a member of Jal before he branched out as a solo singer. 

 Goher Mumtaz, spokesperson for Jal, tells Goodlife: ?Mahesh Bhatt (producer of Zeher) was here in Pakistan last year and contacted us for the song Woh lamhey. Atif had all my compositions including Aadat, Lamhey, Dilharay, Rangaon mein and he released his own album in a hurry, changing the name of Woh lamhey to Bheegi yaadein. But the version he sang again for the Bhatt movie was ours ? the alaaps, the tempo, all were the same. Now, he is confessing to the media that Bhatt forced him to sing Jal?s version.?

 While Jal doesn?t want to take either the Bhatts or Atif to court in India or Pakistan, it does want the Indian people to ?justify the situation? and recognise the band as the original creators of the song. ?We are excited about our trip to India. We plan to feature in some exclusive MTV shows too,? signs off Goher.

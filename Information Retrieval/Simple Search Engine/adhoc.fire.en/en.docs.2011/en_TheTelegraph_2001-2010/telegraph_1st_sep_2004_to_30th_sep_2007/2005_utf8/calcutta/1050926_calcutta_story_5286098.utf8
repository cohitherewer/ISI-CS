The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Patchwork on potholed road 

 SOVAN CHATTERJEE, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 132 and chairman of Borough XIV of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Shyamadas Roy (councillor of ward 126), Subrata Chakrabarty, Tarun Basu, Sreela Banerjee (councillor of ward 130), Debasish Nag, Biswajit Mahattam, Rama Dasgupta, Deepak Mukherjee, Pulak Pal, Anjan Das (councillor of ward 129), Sova Ghosh (councillor of ward 131) and Somnath Chakrabarty 

Somnath Chakrabarty: Banamali Naskar Road is full of pits and potholes. Accidents can occur any time.

 Patchwork will be done before the Puja. A thorough repair will be undertaken later, subject to availability of funds. 

Sreela Banerjee: Residents of Becharam Chatterjee Road and Unique Park are denied proper supply of drinking water because of problems in the supply line on Siddhinath Chatterjee Road. Will you please look into the problem? 

 The pipes are lying in the stores, but no major work can be taken up immediately. 

Sova Ghosh: Ramakrishna Sarani, Sukanta Park, Santi Pally, Guha Para, Babu Para and adjacent areas suffer from drinking water scarcity. Here, too, the pipes have been provided for repair, but there are other hitches. Will you please ensure that the work is completed?

 As far as I know, the work cannot be started as the roads have been dug up for other purposes. I will ensure that the work is completed without further delay. 

Anjan Das: Will you please explain why garbage is not regularly cleared from the Behala civic wards. Is there shortage of staff? 

 We have discussed the issue with councillors and officers of boroughs XIII and XIV. We need about 65 staff members, but have only about 50. 

Biswajit Mahattam: The canal maintained by Calcutta Port Trust is 35 ft wide with a four-ft lockgate. As a result of the bottleneck, Maharani Indira Devi Road is often flooded. Why don?t you demolish the lockgate? 

 We are aware of the bottleneck and have already taken up the issue with the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. Its officers have inspected the site. An underground sewerage system will be developed.

Deepak Mukherjee: Will the underground sewerage system be extended to the lanes and bylanes?

 We will try to extend it to the lanes and bylanes.

Rama Dasgupta: Upen Banerjee Road is in a horrible state, especially near the milk booth. Why isn?t repair work being taken up? 

 You have pointed out a very important problem. The repair will be done as soon as the rains stop. 

Somnath Chakrabarty: The bus terminus at Parnasree is in a shambles. It needs immediate renovation. 

 The borough committee was formed only on August 26, therefore a lot of work is pending. I shall see to it that the renovation work is taken up immediately. 

Subrata Chakrabarty: Vivekananda Road remains waterlogged throughout monsoon. Will you please take up the issue?

 The PWD maintains the road. I will raise the problem.

Shyamadas Roy: A number of tubewells remain broken down in Behala, due to unavailability of spare parts.

 At least 10 types of tubewell spare parts are not available in the civic central store.

Pulak Pal: NSC Bose Road always had decent supply of drinking water. The situation deteriorated after the civic election. Why?

 Overall, the drinking water supply in Behala is quite satisfactory. I will find out more about the matter. 

Shyamadas Roy: Realtors often dump construction material on roads, posing problems for passersby. Can?t that be prevented?

 Developers of multi-storeyed properties can stack construction material on roads until the ground-floor is built.

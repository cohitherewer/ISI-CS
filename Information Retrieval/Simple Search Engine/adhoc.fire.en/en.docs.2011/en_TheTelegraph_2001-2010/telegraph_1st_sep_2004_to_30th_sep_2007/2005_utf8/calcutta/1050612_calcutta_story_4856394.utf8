The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A matter of time

 Tech Talk

 The fault is not yours, dear 

 reader, but that of the software companies. The truth of 

 time management finally dawns on David Pogue...

 I had lunch the other day with 

 a fellow technology columnist. We were chatting about productivity 

 tips. I mentioned that I answer all my emails and write 

 all my books, by dictating, using ScanSoft?s Dragon NaturallySpeaking 

 8. ?Oh yeah, I heard that?s good,? he said ruefully. ?In 

 fact, I bought it. I just haven?t had time to instal it 

 yet.?

 Another time, I was listening 

 to someone grouse about how much she hated Windows XP, the 

 way the Start menu listed all kinds of stuff she never used, 

 and didn?t list the things she really wished were there. 

 ?But you can change that,? I told her. ?You can edit that 

 menu however you like.? She closed her eyes and raised her 

 eyebrows. ?I know, my son told me that,? she replied. ?I 

 just haven?t had time to get into all that.? 

 A great truth has begun to dawn 

 on me: You gotta spend time to save time. And not all of 

 us have that kind of time. Now, my whole career revolves 

 around technological devices, and time is always short. 

 So I learned long ago to bite the bullet and set up every 

 timesaving device known to man and machine, even if it cost 

 me time in the short run.

 I?ve taken Microsoft Word?s AutoCorrect 

 feature to a hideous extreme, stuffing it with literally 

 hundreds of one and two-letter abbreviations that expand 

 into all the common words I use. You may see ?As long as 

 you buy a new computer every year, Microsoft and Apple have 

 no problem with you,?, but what I typed was, ?As lg as y 

 buy a new cp ev year, ms and ap have no pl w y.? 

 I use CE Software?s QuicKeys on 

 both my Mac and my PC. It lets you assign all kinds of tasks 

 to keystrokes of your choice, from typing out boilerplate 

 email responses to opening programs. I prune my email address 

 book, build groups of addressees and set up ?message rules? 

 that auto-file incoming messages according to certain criteria. 

 (Mailing lists go in this folder, family correspondence 

 goes in that one; attachments get shunted over there.)

 But even I, Mr Macro, feel inadequate 

 about all the timesaving devices I?m not exploiting. I still 

 haven?t set up decent playlists in iTunes. I really ought 

 to organise my Web bookmarks one of these days. In fact, 

 I should set up a Firefox tabbed group to open a standard 

 set of Web pages every morning automatically. I love Mac 

 OS X Tiger, but I just haven?t had a minute to set up and 

 fine-tune the self-updating Smart Folders that could keep 

 my files and folders organised automatically.

 Now, if I can?t find the time 

 ? and I?m an extreme case at the distant end of the ?spend 

 time to save time? spectrum ? how is the ordinary person 

 who?s not in the computing field supposed to set up all 

 of these labour-saving devices?

 All of this reminds me of the 

 advice the magazines give us. In one issue alone, various 

 experts will insist that we need eight hours of sleep a 

 night, that we ought to spend two good hours of quality 

 time each day with our kids, that we should exercise 90 

 minutes a day and that keeping a marriage strong requires 

 at least 15 hours a week of time alone together. 

 Well, guess what, dudes? Throw 

 in an eight-hour workday with a 45-minute commute, and you?ve 

 used up 23 hours of your day. Apparently, stuff like eating 

 and taking showers aren?t all that important after all. 

 In the tech world, same deal. 

 When you add it all up ? programming the remote control, 

 writing the macros, storing the custom camera settings, 

 setting up the Quicken categories and reports, building 

 the time-saving choice lists in FileMaker, programming Photoshop 

 Actions, and on and on ? you don?t have a prayer. There 

 simply aren?t enough hours in the day to learn how to save 

 so much time.

 The fault, dear readers, lies 

 not within you, but within the software companies who market 

 features that they claim will save you time. If I have any 

 credibility at all as a minister of technology, therefore, 

 I hereby absolve thee. Let the burden of guilt be lifted 

 from your shoulders; you?re not alone. 

 Besides, you?ll have plenty of 

 time to streamline your work routine once you retire.

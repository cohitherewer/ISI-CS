 It's Your Birthday So...

 Your best trait is your friendly manner. You have an independent streak; you want your liberty in business, career and in close relationships. Always active, pleasant, yet a bit moody, you can also be quite harsh and critical. It?s fine to be of service, but you risk being exploited by those whom you serve. You are wise with your money, but don?t be too fussy; treat yourself to something nice occasionally. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Resident restopub to relax and rock

 Make a point with panache, debate an issue close to your heart, or simply unwind after a dog?s day at work with your favourite drink and some suitable starters.

 Not after a tedious drive back to downtown chaos, but much closer home. Gossip, the city?s ?first friendly neighbourhood restopub?, gearing up to uncork in mid-May, promises to provide a cosy hangout alternative for south Calcuttans.

 ?The effort is to take the quintessential Calcutta adda concept and put it in a pub environment,? offers Paul Pradeep, a non-resident Bengali marine consultant based in Singapore, who has floated the novel pub along with wife Arunima.

 Coming up inside the Unnayan Commercial Complex adjacent to Udita, the 800-sq ft snug den will have chit chat as the main course on its platter.

 ?We will even have table mats where one can write one?s favourite gossip. The best entry of the week will be put up on the specially erected ?gossip pillar? inside the pub,? adds Arunima.

 The couple is also researching major ?impact events? through history that have been born out of gossip over a drink. Some standout dialogue or rumpus would be reproduced to add to the lively, interactive ambience.

 ?The essential inclusiveness and cosmopolitan mix that typify Calcutta should find expression here,? observes Pradeep. So, elocution events, seminars, informal discussions on relevant topics and seasonal themes will also be part of the spread, besides the occasional live gig.

 While the focus will be primarily on pubbing, Gossip will serve titbits and no-frills combo meals as well. 

 ?We will have an eclectic spread of snacks and starters like Chicken Yakitori from Japan, Tuscan Grilled Chicken from Italy and Pollo Asado (Mexican grilled chicken),? says Pradip Rozario, chef owner of KK?s Fusion, also partner and in charge of the kitchen at this restopub off the Bypass, at the tail-end of Santoshpur.

 A small tandoor will churn out fusion delicacies like sun-dried tomato fish and Asian-Italian chicken kebabs. ?We are toying with the idea of converting the place into an English-style tea room in the afternoon with cheeseballs and finger sandwiches, and a relaxed tavern by evening,? says Arunima.

 A Sunday brunch menu and a journey down cuisine memory lane, dredging out lost recipes from the bylanes of Calcutta, are also on the cards. The couple, with friend Rozario, expects a steady footfall from the extended neighbourhood starved of evening destinations in the vicinity.

 ?More and more young professionals are settling down in these parts, with a host of new-age residential complexes coming up on and off the Bypass. Many of them are forced to travel to Park Street or Camac Street after work. Gossip will provide them with a relaxed pubbing option at this end of town,? feels Pradeep.

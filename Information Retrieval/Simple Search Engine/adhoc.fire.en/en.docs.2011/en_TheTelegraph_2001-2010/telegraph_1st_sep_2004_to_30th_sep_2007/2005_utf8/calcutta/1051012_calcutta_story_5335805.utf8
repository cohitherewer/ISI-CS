 We Ask You Answer

 Creativity at tradition cost 

 Today?s question: Are we reducing Durga puja to mere gimmickry with unconventional idols and themes? More letters will be published next week

DebAshis saha,

Anath Nath Deb Lane 

Since earlier there was little experimentation with 

pandals and idols, respect and reverence were the most important aspects of the 

pujas. With the advent of unconventional idols and a surfeit of themes, faith 

has flown out of the window, and gimmickry rules. The festival is now all about 

big business and cut-throat competition.

Avishek biswas, 

Belur 

It cannot be said that we are reducing Durga puja 

to mere gimmickry with unconventional idols and themes because, even now, due 

importance is attached to traditions and customs. As far as idols and themes are 

concerned, it is only a matter of keeping pace with the times.

Diptimoy ghosh, 

Salt Lake 

The ethical and ritualistic aspects of the pujas are 

losing out to theme pandals (not mandaps) and unconventional idols. Competition 

and awards from the various business houses have prompted the organisers to resort 

to gimmickry to catch the eye. The pandal-hoppers, too, attach importance to new 

concepts no matter at what cost. The subscription rates are thus going up every 

year. Only the pujas at homes are still held in a proper environment.

Suchanda sen,

Santinagar, Bally 

A glimpse of a traditional idol fills our hearts with 

devotion. We automatically want to seek the goddess? blessing, whereas the unconventional 

idols look like mere showpieces. It is absolutely detestable that the Devi is 

even being made with discarded objects. Though a certain amount of creativity 

is involved in the construction of such idols, they do not evoke much respect. 

The traditional form should not be tampered with.

Devi Dutt, 

Moira Street 

Thanks to unconventional idols and themes, Durga puja 

has been reduced to mere gimmickry. Devotion is not something that you can even 

think of associating with the commercialised pujas of today. The ritualistic and 

even aesthetic aspects of the Puja have yielded to cheap stunts, commotion and 

pollution.

sourish misra,

Salt Lake 

Most Bengalis prefer conventional idols with daker 

saaj. It is unfortunate that in spite of that puja organisers are going in 

for unconventional idols. Their only aim is to cash in on the novelty value and 

win prizes.

arpita chowdhury,

Dum Dum 

Theme pujas have enabled us to witness the resurgence 

of folk arts. Even traditional art forms of other states have benefited because 

of the Puja. The festival has also provided students of art colleges with a platform 

to showcase their talent. Puja is now a cultural event more than anything else, 

and creativity rather that gimmickry is its hallmark. 

govinda bakshi,

Budge Budge 

The puja organisers have engaged creative artists 

to come up with unconventional themes in the quest for sarad sammans. The 

audience is also eager for a taste of something new.

arunava bose chowdhury,

Barrackpore 

Pujas in the urban areas have long become soulless. 

And no attempt is being made to revive the devotional spirit and foster healthy 

competition among the organisers. The cultural aspects of the Puja are also losing 

out in the bargain.

payel Bhattacharyya,

Joka 

Most big-budget pujas are breaking down the barriers 

of culture to attract people and win awards. Cultural diversity and aesthetics 

are getting a fillip in the process. The common people, being devoid of artistic 

sensibilities, are not comprehending this process of experimentation and its significance. 

However, the themes that are deliberately odd will not stand the test of time.

Swarnali Biswas, 

Metropolitan Housing Society 

Unconventional idols and themes are reducing Puja 

to a cheap publicity gimmick. The autumn extravaganza is not just a show of colours 

and light, but a religious event of deep significance. The Puja committees might 

be able to attract the masses with their innovations, but the essence of the goddess 

is only embodied in her conventional representation. 

Tapan pal,

Batanagar 

Yes, and with time, the gimmickry will only increase. 

We have plans to introduce ?jubati puja?, a la ?kumari puja?, in 

our para. The impulsive voyeurs will like it and contribute voluntarily. 

Without liberal contribution, it is becoming tough to organise a festival. 

Arijit acharya,

Santoshpur 

What is taken to be the traditional image of Durga, 

is actually a particular style of representing the goddess that has evolved down 

the years, through several changes. Attribution of aesthetic concepts to Durga 

puja is also very important. Thus, experimentation with the idols and pandals 

should not be called gimmickry.

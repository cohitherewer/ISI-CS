 Pottering around

Art is a window to the innermost perception of beauty 

? it is this belief that drove Aditi Saraogi and Shreyashi Swaika to explore pottery 

as an art form, experimenting and creating art objects with clay. Combining art 

and sculpture, the duo produce from their pottery studio, Bhukriti, a mind-boggling 

array of aesthetically designed clay pieces. Harmoniously uniting the functional 

and artistic aspects of pottery, their creations on clay use both ancient and 

contemporary methods. The ongoing exhibition displays items of utility, like lamp-bases, 

vases, bowls and platters, as well as beautiful, decorative showpieces like masks, 

dolls and wall hangings. Specialising in forms and smoke-firing, Saraogi?s pottery 

reflects her creative passion in works like bookends. Shaped like flames, they 

epitomize fire, an element that has the power to purify and destroy. On the other 

hand, Swaika?s works, specialising in figurines and glazes, is focused on the 

potter?s wheel. Translucent and calm, her shapes and glazes profess a delicate 

understanding of clay as a medium.

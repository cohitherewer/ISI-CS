White metal magic

ANUMITA GHOSH

 A princely collection of sparkling silver in various shapes and forms ? thats what Princess, a boutique in Ideal Plaza at 11/1, Sarat Bose Road, has to offer.

 Be it home d?cor, puja accessories or utility items, the plush store has a wide range of silverware customised to almost every taste.

 Silver is a timeless classic that will never lose its charm. We offer exclusive silver items that are not available anywhere else in the market, claims Kailash Tawania of Princess.

 From melting the metal to the finishing, everything is done in our own factory. We have a team of in-house designers who create the stuff. And we also take regular inputs and ideas from European designers, he adds.

All the artefacts are made of 92.5 per cent silver, 

he reveals. Apart from the items on display, specialist craftsmen are adept 

in catering to the exact specifications of the customer, adds Tawania.

Vase wows

 Gorgeous, elegant and exclusive are words that best describe the vases spoiling you for choice at Princess. Silver filigree work combined with glass, the metal in a variety of finishes like matte and oxidised ? you name it and the store has it on its racks. 

 Customers differ in tastes and choices. Our vase collection has something for everyone, from the traditional to the contemporary, explains Tawania.

 Ornate vases in shapes big and small will add a royal touch to your home decor. While some come intricately designed with jali work, others are hand-engraved or even embossed.

 Then you have the sleek ones in abstract shapes. Sometimes a wooden handle and base and at times a leafy adornment entwining the shiny plane surface make for stunning effects. 

 Some of the vases are a fine blend of tradition and modernism. These come with a plain body and heavily embellished base or the other way round. Another eye-catcher is a line of vases shaped like champagne flutes.

 The show-stealer, however, is an exotic array of vases where the metal is combined with crystals. The crystal bodies are combined with silver detailing at the base and mouth.

Puja pick

 From Ganesha and Lakshmi idols to thalis, candle stands and diyas, theres quite a collection of puja accessories. We have a huge line of designer silver diyas for Diwali, says a spokesperson for the store. 

 The puja thalis come in an assortment of simple and heavily-designed ones. There are thalis combining silver, glass and meena work. Others are embellished with motifs of lotuses, conch shells and floral designs. The thali sets come with incense stick holders and small bowls to match.

 The other offering from this section is the Akhand Diya holder, with a silver or glass cover.

Box beauty

 If you are passionate about jewellery, you must want to preserve them stylishly. The jewellery boxes at Princess help you do just that. They look pretty with oxidised finish or matte finish and filigree work.

Home high

Almost every item at Princess can enhance the aesthetic 

appeal of your home. Even the utility stuff performs much more than a functional 

role.

 There are beautiful fruit bowls in all sizes that make for centre bowls as well. Here again, the ones with crystal and silver detailing are the definite eye-catchers. 

 Those with an eye for linear designs have the sleek tea sets to choose from, while others can look out for the more ornate ones. Then there are jug sets that come with packs of two, four or six glasses.

Also on offer are napkin holders, paperweights, tiny 

medicine boxes, photo frames, key holders, lampshades and other knick-knacks.

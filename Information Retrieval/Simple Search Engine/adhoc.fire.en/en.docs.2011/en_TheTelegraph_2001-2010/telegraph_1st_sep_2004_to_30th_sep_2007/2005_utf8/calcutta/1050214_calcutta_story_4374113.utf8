The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trapped in rally, denied treatment

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Swapna Sardar?s nightmare did not end after the CPM-sponsored rally on Brigade Parade Ground. 

 The 35-year-old, who met with an accident on Diamond Harbour Road on Saturday morning and was then stuck in an ambulance for several hours because of the rally, was refused admission at SSKM Hospital. She is now on the ventilator at a private hospital.

 ?We lost 12 precious hours in the process of bringing her from the accident spot and admitting her to a hospital,? lamented a family member. 

 ?Swapna has suffered multiple injuries in the head, lungs and liver. Her condition is extremely unstable and she is on the ventilator,? said doctors at AMRI Hospital, where Swapna was finally admitted, after being turned down by SSKM and MR Bangur hospitals.

 Swapna was riding pillion on a two-wheeler with a cousin to reach the doctor?s chamber when they were hit by another vehicle. Her cousin, Abhijit Sikdar, died on the spot, while she was taken to SSKM. 

 It took two-and-a-half hours for the ambulance to travel from Park Circus junction to SSKM Hospital on Saturday afternoon. The AJC Bose flyover was choked with vehicles stranded by the ruling party?s processions, while the road below was used for parking vehicles which carried comrades to the rally.

 Even after reaching the hospital, she was not taken in by the SSKM authorities. ?The doctor and officials told us there was no bed vacant,? said a family member. 

 From there, she had to be taken to MR Bangur Hospital. ?With an oxygen mask and just a bandage on her head, Swapna was lying in the ambulance, while I tried in vain to drive past the crowd returning from the rally. 

 ?Police denied us entry into several roads, and it was only after another few hours that we managed to get her into AMRI,? the driver of the ambulance said.

 Mala Sarkar, who was admitted to NRS Medical College and Hospital as she was bleeding profusely due to gynaecological problems, had to be given two bottles of blood on Sunday morning. 

 She was taken from Uttarpara State General Hospital to Medical College and Hospital, Calcutta, where doctors said she could not be admitted as the emergency ward was undergoing repairs. 

 Later, she was taken to NRS. Doctors there said her condition was critical and the delay could have proved fatal.

 The high court on Friday dismissed a PIL against Shyam Benegal?s film Bose The Forgotten Hero. The petition was filed by Surajit Dasgupta and others. 

 division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly stated in their order that the image of Netaji was too large to be diminished by insignificant scenes in a film.

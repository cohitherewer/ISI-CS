The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Disney dual delight

 Mad for Mickey and all eyes on Alladin? Kids (and adults, too) take heart ? Disney is here. The global giant made its Indian debut with two kids? channels in December 2004, but the formal launch in Calcutta came only on Wednesday.

 Disney is airing two channels ? the Disney Channel and Toon Disney. One would have a mix of classic Disney movies, programmes for pre-schoolers and contemporary animation, while the other would focus solely on animation.

 ?The two channels are completely different from each other but the advantage for both would be the strength they come with,? says Rajat Jain, managing director, Walt Disney Television International India. ?Disney is the largest media brand and the sixth largest brand overall in the world. It provides special entertainment with values that are reflected in the channels.?

 For Disney Channel, the core age group is 2-14 years. ?But besides kids, the channel would have a family appeal as well,? offers Jain. Best of Disney movies would be aired on the channel, with at least two films per day.

 Special emphasis would be on Playhouse Disney, a daily slot aimed at pre-schoolers and designed to stimulate thinking skills, encourage creativity and instill moral and social values in them. ?There are 100 million kids in India who are less than four years old. There?s almost no programming that targets this huge section,? explains Jain.

Studio Disney is the third programming component on 

the channel where contemporary Disney animation like Lilo and Stitch would 

be presented with wrap-around programming compered by local hosts.

 Toon Disney, on the other hand, will showcase the best of animation. ?Be it Spiderman or Hulk, this is the place for the best animation shows,? says Jain about the beam that would focus on the 4 to 10-year-olds. As far as classic Disney cartoons are concerned ? including Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and gang ? Jain says there will be a bit of that on both channels.

 India, according to Disney, is central to its growth. The company already has existing business here in the form of licensing of merchandising, film distribution through Columbia Tristar and home entertainment distribution through Excel. ?But soon, television will lead the way,? asserts Jain. Programme slots on various channels over the years have helped build the foundation to target the Indian audience.

 The India focus is also prominent with the huge production work that Disney is doing locally and the regional feeds it is providing. Besides English, Disney Channel is available in Hindi, while Toon Disney is available in Tamil and Telugu.

 ?Localisation is very important if you want to reach the masses,? explains Jain. For the rest of the country, Hindi suffices ? the demand for a Hindi feed is surprisingly strong in Calcutta ? but for the south, Tamil and Telugu is a must.

 But in a market where broadcasters are finding it increasingly difficult to capture eyeballs, does it make sense to launch two kids? channel simultaneously? ?Kids spend only 10 per cent of their time watching kids? programmes, with the rest occupied by non-kids? programmes. We think there?s a huge opportunity for us to change the scenario,? says Jain.

 The target for the first year is to reach 24 million homes.

 Promotions are being done through the STAR channels, since STAR is distributing the two channels. School promotions will start as soon as exams get over.

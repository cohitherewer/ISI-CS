The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Time for endeavours amp; dreams

- SIX VOICES, SIX RESOLUTIONS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD 

One single objective will keep me busy in 2005 ? making West 

Bengal the most attractive destination for potential investors in the IT industry. 

The year 2004 was good for us, but we want to improve upon last year?s performance 

and scale up our endeavours. My team and I will work round-the-clock this year 

to make the dream come true. ? Manab Mukherjee, IT minister

 Mukherjee: New gains 

I will be donning the garb of a costume designer for the first 

time in Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black in end-January. My international 

retail debut soon follows, with selections from the Frog Princess Spring-Summer 

2005 collection hitting the Browns racks in February, for which I plan to make 

a trip to London. ? Sabyasachi Mukherjee, fashion designer 

 Mukherjee: Screen designs

 I?m really looking forward to my feature film directorial debut. 

I really don?t know when exactly it is going to happen, but certainly some time 

in 2005. I would also like to do more social work, particularly in raising AIDS 

awareness among young people. ? June, actress

 June: Calling the shots 

I would like 2005 to be a bandh-free year. I would also like 

to see construction activities become greener so that we can synergise steel and 

concrete with the environment. Its extremely important to introspect and 

find out how we can all become more environment-conscious. If anything, the year-end 

lashing of the killer tsunami and snow in the Gulf have come as stinging reminders. 

Projects that will keep me busy in 2005 are Technopolis, Forum II and Prakriti, 

a green project in Orissa. ? Rahul Saraf, developer and MD Forum 

 Saraf: Green drive 

 I will be very busy with Flurys for the next year. We have 

lots of plans. Till April, we will consolidate the existing outlet, after which 

we will be looking for franchisees for more outlets. There will be lots of new 

things, events and programmes, on the menu and off. I have been waiting for three 

years for it, and now it?s working out. I?ve lots of plans. ? Shaun Kenworthy, 

supervising chef, Flurys 

 Kenworthy: Full menu 

A couple of projects will keep me busy in 2005. An original 

album in English, on which I have been working for a long time, should see fruition. 

Another album, multi-lingual and about an imaginary train that travels right across 

the country, should also be completed. I really would like to set up an orchestra 

for the visually-handicapped. Something else that is dear to my heart is getting 

the Park Street festival underway, something we could not do in 2004. ?Usha Uthup, 

singer 

 Uthup: More music

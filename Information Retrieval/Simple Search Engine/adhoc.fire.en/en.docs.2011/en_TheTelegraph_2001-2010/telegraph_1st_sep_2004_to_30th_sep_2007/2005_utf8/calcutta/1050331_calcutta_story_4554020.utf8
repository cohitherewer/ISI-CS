 Court frown on cop role 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The officers-in-charge (OCs) of two city police stations came under the scanner of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday for their ?illegal intervention in civil disputes by violating the service rules?.

 Justice P.K. Chatterjee, disposing of a petition filed by leather trader Mumtazur Rub, asked director-general of police Ajay Prasad to take appropriate steps against Salil Bhattacharya, OC of Tiljala police station, for ordering a sub-inspector to settle a financial dispute. 

 ?The director-general will also consider all the aspects of the case before providing the OC with an alternative post,? the judge said. He observed that the OC had allowed a subordinate to assault a citizen.

 Chatterjee, while hearing another petition, filed by Ruma Dey, owner of a flat in Jodhpur Colony, came down on the OC of Lake police station.

 ?Who has authorised you to allow the colony members to lock the flat of the petitioner? You are taking the law into your own hands,? the judge told the OC.

 Chatterjee asked him to ?ensure the security of the petitioner? and hand over the flat without further delay.

 The secretary of the Jodhpur Colony Committee, Shyamal Banerjee, was asked not to pressure the petitioner.

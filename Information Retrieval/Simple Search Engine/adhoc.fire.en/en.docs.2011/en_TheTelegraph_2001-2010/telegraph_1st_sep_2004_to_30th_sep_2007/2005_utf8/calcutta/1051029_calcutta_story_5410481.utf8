 Mother-daughter magic

 Aparna Sen with daughter Konkona, who will star in the filmmaker?s next venture Goynar Baksho

 Two sets of mothers and daughters teaming up with two comedy actors ? there?s a lot to look forward to when Aparna Sen?s first Hindi film begins to roll on the city floors in January. 

 A series of hiccups later, Aparna is finally poised to start her much-awaited project Goynar Baksho (the Hindi title has not yet been decided), adapted from the Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay story.

 The tale of three women of three generations in a middle-class Bengali family will feature Sharmila Tagore as the elderly Pishima and Konkona Sen Sharma as Pishima?s daughter-in-law Somlata. Soha Ali Khan will be seen in a double role ? as a young Pishima and as Somlata?s daughter.

 ?Soha is in a double role because as Somlata?s daughter she is supposed to be a reincarnation of Pishima,? explains Aparna, who has finished writing the script.

 And then comes the big Bollywood angle ? Govinda will play Konkona?s straying husband and Paresh Rawal her father-in-law.

 ?I had planned to do this film several times and this time I hope everything will work out fine,? the director said from Mumbai, keeping her fingers crossed till ?it gets rolling?.

 The project, earlier slated to be in Bengali, was last shelved due to a copyright problem between the author and Mumbai-based producer Jhamu Sughand. Now, Aparna is going ahead with Calcutta-based producer Bipin Vohra, who has also backed her 15, Park Avenue.

 ?I have always loved this story (Goynar Baksho). I think I had read it in 1992. It has a Marquezian feel, that kind of magic realism. It shows the changing position of women in our society through three generations, vis-?-vis the changing attitude of the women. I like the story because there is no pontification and it?s very light. The film will be done in a comedy form,? said the film-maker.

 Her 15, Park Avenue was screened at London Film Festival on Thursday evening. ?There were three shows and all were sold out. I was told that the crowd just loved it.?

 Starring Waheeda Rehman, Shabana Azmi, Konkona, Rahul Bose, Soumitra Chatterjee and Dhritiman Chaterji, 15, Park Avenue releases in Calcutta on December 9.

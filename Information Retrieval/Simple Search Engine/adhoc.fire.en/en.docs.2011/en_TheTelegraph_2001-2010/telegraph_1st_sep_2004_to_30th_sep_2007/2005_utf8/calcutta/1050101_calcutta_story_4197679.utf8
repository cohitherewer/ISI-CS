 Police plea to public on Buddha 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After failing to make any headway in Wednesday?s theft of the 5th Century Buddha head from Indian Museum, city police on Friday sought help from visitors and students of Indian Art College, who were present in the Archaeology Long Gallery, where the priceless work was displayed.

 The detective department, which is probing the theft, on Friday sent out an appeal: ?If anyone has any idea about the theft, don?t hesitate to come forward and share information with us.?

 Elaborating on why police sought the help from the people, an officer of the detective department said: ?Someone may have noticed the criminal(s) removing the head. He or she may have thought the lifter(s) to be museum staff and did not inform anyone. So, please come forward and give us a description of the criminal(s).?

 Police spoke to art college students, who were present in the gallery between 12.30 pm and 1.15 pm, the time span of the theft. ?We haven?t got a single lead so far. Now, we are trying to locate the other students who were there,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner, detective department.

 Police are planning to contact the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for Interpol help. ?The help is being sought because the stolen artefact is highly valued in the international antique market. We will talk to the agency within a day or two,? said a senior officer at the police headquarters.

 The detective department has started sharing information with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which had probed the Nobel prize theft case before it was handed over to the CBI. ?The CID has a database on people across the state who deal in antiques. During the Nobel probe, they had dug out details of the city?s antique market,? said an officer of the detective department.

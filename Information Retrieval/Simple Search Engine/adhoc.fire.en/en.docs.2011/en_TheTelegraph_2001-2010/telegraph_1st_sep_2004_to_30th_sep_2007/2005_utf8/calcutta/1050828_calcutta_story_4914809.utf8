 In the fast lane of revelry, nothing holds the attention of the party people for long. If a discotheque was the happy haunt a couple of years ago, the lounge today is the place to be.

 Similarly, the tracks at the console, the heart and soul of any night club, keep on changing every month. Woh lamhey is already waning and even Bin tere sanam does not whip up enough enthusiasm.

 A new set of pulsating tracks is all set to invade the dance floors in town. Goodlife tunes into some of the tracks climbing the console charts? 

 Kya khub lagti ho (remix)

 Movie: Dharmatma

 Club call: Its a very subtle romantic song. The steady pace of the track helped in making the remix, says DJ Suketu.

 Fact file: The video of the song has the duo of Upen Patel and Udita Goswami sizzling on screen. According to the DJ, this is the most expensive video ever made for a private album. 

 High point: DJ Suketu is the man behind the remixes of Woh lamhey and Bin tere sanam. Going by his past record, the song is not likely to disappoint the party crowd.

 Salaam namaste

 Movie: Salaam Namaste

 Club Call: It is a groovy track with a very happy mood. This number is going to rule the revelry hour for the next four to five weeks, feels DJ Harish.

 Fact file: The movie stars the oh-so-cool Saif Ali Khan and the oh-so-cute Preity Zinta. The music, the look and the feel of the film all seem to be today with a capital T.

 High point: The movie has been made under the Yash Raj banner and boasts great locales. It also brings a live-in relationship into the mainstream.

 Aashiq banaya aapne

 Movie: Aashiq Banaya Aapne

 Club call: It is a disc ready track with a lot of pump. The playback and the rhythm are the USPs of the song, says DJ Girish.

 Fact file: The cast of the movie is nothing to write home about, but the music by Himesh Reshammiya forces one to hit the dance floor.

 High point: Box-office success might not be his forte, but Emraan Hashmi ensures promising music and a passionate kiss.

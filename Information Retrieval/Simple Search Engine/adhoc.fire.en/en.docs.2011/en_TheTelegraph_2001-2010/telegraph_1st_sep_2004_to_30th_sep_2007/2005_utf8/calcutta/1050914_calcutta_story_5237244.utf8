 Tejaswini Kollhapure: Out of luck. Picture by Pabitra Das

 Every time she is in Calcutta, she keeps being bombarded with one single question: ?Tejaswini, when is Paanch releasing?? But the younger Kollhapure sibling is still waiting for her much-awaited breakthrough debut project to hit theatres. ?Boney Kapoor has bought it. It was supposed to release before No Entry. Let?s see now when it does,? Tejaswini told Metro when she came to the city as part of the three-member team of Vandana Sajnani?s English play Beauty, Brains amp; Personality.

 Tejaswini was quick to add that she was not the jinxed one. ?When my other film Stop released last year, I called Anurag (Kashyap) and told him that he is the one who is jinxed and not me,? she laughed. But her other finished film Anjaane, co-starring Manisha Koirala, is also stuck in the cans. 

 Despite the frustration, the actor has avoided signing any of the series of sex films that were offered to her. ?I can?t make that mistake. I have waited for so long, so why should I give up at this stage?? she argued. However, Tejaswini has signed Hriday Shetty?s next film Daag, co-starring Ashmit Patel and Deepal Shaw. That too, had run into financial problems!

 This girl can sure do with some luck.

 Do you have to be a good PR person to get your film released? Do your public relation skills have to be good to bag a film? Several such questions were raised and answered in a panel discussion set up by the Calcutta chapter of the Public Relations Society of India at Bengal Club on Monday.

 Actor Arindam Sil, film-maker Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti and professor Madhuja Mukherjee were among those on the dais engaged in verbal volleys as they discussed the topic of the evening ? Public Relations: Key to Unlocking Myriad Horizons.

 The panelists were unanimous in the effectiveness and significance of public relations and stressed that one needn?t be apologetic to exercise it.

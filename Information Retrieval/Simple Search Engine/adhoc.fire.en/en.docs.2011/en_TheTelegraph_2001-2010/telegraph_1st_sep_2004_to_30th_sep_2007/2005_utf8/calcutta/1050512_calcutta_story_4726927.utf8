 Torture tag on trader murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Howrah-based trader Vijay Tandon, missing since May 5, had turned up dead a day later, his body found floating in the Hooghly. On Wednesday, police said there was evidence that he had been beaten and tortured before being thrown into the river.

 Vijay?s bloated body was found under the Vidyasagar Setu by South Port police officers on May 6. A message was flashed across police stations and four days later, on May 10, his family came to identify the body.

 Forensic samples were taken for the post-mortem, after which the decomposed body was handed over to his family on Wednesday. The 48-year-old was cremated later in the day.

 Though officially police are waiting for the post-mortem results, the homicide wing of the detective department has been asked to look into the matter, owing to the nature of injuries on the corpse. Vijay had a fractured leg and the rear of his skull was crushed.

 His motorcycle, on which he had left his Howrah home days ago, is yet to be traced.

 ?This does not appear to be a suicide or an accident. There are indications that this could be a case of torture before murder,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (port).

 An unnatural death case has been registered at the South Port police station.

 The post-mortem was conducted at the Katapukur police morgue.

 A dealer in medicines and garments in Burrabazar, Vijay left home, in Howrah?s Round Tank Lane, around 2 pm on May 5. ?I am heading for Burrabazar and will be late tonight,? he reportedly told his family members before leaving.

 According to Vijay?s brother Ajay, he was last seen around the Ezra Street area with Parimal Matalia, one of his friends. The two had gone out on the motorcycle to buy some T-shirts.

 ?Since the evening of May 5, we had tried to reach Vijay on his cell phone, but it was switched off. Three days after we lodged a missing person diary at both the Howrah and Burrabazar thanas, police informed us a body had been recovered and requested us to come in for identification,? said Ajay. ?Pushpa Devi, my sister-in-law, identified him,? he added.

 Vijay?s cell phone and gold ring are apparently missing, as is around Rs 1,500 he was carrying that day.

 Police are investigating any possible rivals the victim may have had and if a gang was following him the day he disappeared.

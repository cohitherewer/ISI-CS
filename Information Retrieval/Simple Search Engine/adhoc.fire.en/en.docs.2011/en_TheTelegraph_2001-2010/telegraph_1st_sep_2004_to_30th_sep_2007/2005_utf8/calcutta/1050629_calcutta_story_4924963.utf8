 Care for children without 

a home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A family is one of the most basic rights of a child. But in a country where over 150 million children are deprived of their basic rights, living without the care, love and support of parents or guardians is a common occurrence. According to CRY (Child Relief and You), many children who haven?t committed offences stay in institutions and state-run homes, although most have one or both parents alive.

 The third state-level consultation on quality institutional care and alternatives for children was organised by CRY and its partner NGO Praajak on Tuesday. The aim of the initiative is based on the right of a child to a family ? biological, adoptive or foster. Institutional care must be the last alternative, in which case the child must be provided quality care. 

 ?In a study we conducted in 159 institutions in nine states last year, we found the children very hesitant to talk of the institutions they were staying in. Most of them didn?t feel safe,? said K. Geeta of CRY Mumbai.

 Around 55 per cent of the supervisors told the study team that children tried to escape or commit suicide. Water and food served to the children were not hygienic. The source of water in 60 per cent of the homes were hand-pumps. The medical and recreational facilities were inadequate, with no ambulances and only one medical room in 56 per cent of the homes. 

 Forty-four per cent of the institutions had no counselling facilities, and in over 40 per cent of them the children who had committed crimes and those who hadn?t were mixed together. Although training is required, only 25 per cent of the homes said they had given special training to staff.

 ?The system that exists today is not equipped to care for the children,? added Geeta. 

 The chief guest on the occasion, Md Salim (MP), said children are often ignored because they don?t have voting rights, are not capable of organising themselves like adults, and are not ?economically important? in society. ?But they have voices, and we must listen to them,? he stressed. Salim argued that ?South Asian family bonds are very strong?, and that instances of child abuse by families are aberrations.

 Praajak presented case studies of vulnerable children to highlight the issue. There was also a panel discussion on community-based approaches to care for vulnerable children.

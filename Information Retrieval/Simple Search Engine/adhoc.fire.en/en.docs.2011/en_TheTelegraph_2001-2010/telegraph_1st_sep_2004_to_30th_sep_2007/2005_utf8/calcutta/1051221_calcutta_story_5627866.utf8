 Hers is a balancing act

 Was dance your first calling?

 It was always dance for me. We have had an arts background. At any point of time, there would be painters, dancers and musicians at home. Naturally, music, theatre, dance have always been a part of our lives? I was also a big movie buff, having always been crazy about movies. So, I always knew that I would get into acting some day. What I didn?t know was that Kisna would happen to me.

 How did Kisna happen then?

 It happened quite by chance. We got an email from Mukta Arts saying that they have heard of my mother?s (Daksha Sheth) unique dancing style and they wanted to meet both of us. So we came to Mumbai to meet Subhash Ghai and after just three days, he called me asking, ?Would you like to do Kisna?? 

 So, how did you find the Kisna experience?

 Before Kisna, I have never even done a portfolio. I had only done dance theatre. I was so very na?ve that it didn?t sink in at all. Mumbai, movies, the whole industry? everything was so new. I did enjoy the whole process because of the novelty, the media attention and everything.

 Any regrets that Kisna didn?t do well?

 No regrets at all. I am very proud of Kisna since it was my first film. I didn?t know what to expect. In fact, I was ready for failure. But I am very, very happy that my work was appreciated. The film gave me an opportunity to try something different, to work with someone like Subhash Ghai and have such great music to dance to.

 Did it also help you decide on your career?

 Yes, I decided to do cinema but also didn?t want to give up what I had started. So I decided to balance my twin careers as a dancer and as a film actor. Especially because ours is a very musical industry. In the West, it all started with Gene Kelly and then the musicals died down. But we are continuing the trend. I believe that my acting skills and dancing can go hand in hand. I have always been a big fan of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, how they sing, act and dance together. These were the people I grew up with. If I can be one per cent of what they have been, I would be happy. So, I am signing less films and trying to strike a balance with my stage shows.

 What are the films you have signed?

 I am doing a Ram Gopal Varma production directed by Chakravarthy. It?s a black comedy having an ensemble cast including Manisha Koirala, Aftab Shivdasani and Chunky Pandey. Then I am doing a film called Rocky with Zayed Khan. And then there?s a Subhash Ghai production called Good Boy, Bad Boy. All these films will keep me busy for quite some time.

 None of these are musicals and you don?t have dancing roles?

 That?s something I have purposely chosen. The Ram Gopal Varma film has no song or dance at all. And in the other two, Rocky and Good Boy, Bad Boy, there is no emphasis on song and dance. I will definitely do a dancing role again but at the moment I am looking into just acting assignments.

 Tell us something about your performance in front of Michael Jackson?

 Oh (laughs)! I was invited to perform at some cultural shows. Once there, we came to know that Michael Jackson was there. No one knew about his presence, not even the people sitting in the audience. Only we, backstage, knew he was there. For aeons, we have all looked up to him and it was very unfortunate that I couldn?t meet him.

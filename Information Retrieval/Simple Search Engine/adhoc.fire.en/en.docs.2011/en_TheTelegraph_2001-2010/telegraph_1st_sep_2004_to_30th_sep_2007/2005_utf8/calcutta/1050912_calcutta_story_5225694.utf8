The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Terminal set to miss Puja deadline

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The third railway passenger terminal of the city, at Chitpur, is unlikely to be commissioned before the Pujas, as promised by the authorities. 

 The Rs 100-crore project, aimed at easing the load on Howrah and Sealdah stations, has hit yet another legal hurdle, with a contractor moving Calcutta High Court.

 ?In all probability, the terminal will not be commissioned before the Pujas, as the contractor did not do any work since bagging the contract and has now moved court,? a senior official of Eastern Railway (ER) said on Sunday. 

 According to the official, a tender was floated for finishing work on the terminal building and the contract was given to Goswami Constructions.

 ?We had requested the firm to start work immediately and on a war footing, since we had a deadline to meet. But the firm was not doing any work, so we sought an explanation from the owners within seven days,? the official added.

 The company, instead, sent a legal notice to ER and moved court. ?The construction work of the building is almost over. But if the station master?s room, public reservation system counter and booking office are not complete, then how can the trains run?? the official asked.

 The company alleged that it could not proceed with the work since the construction work of the building was not complete. 

 ?After receiving the acceptance letter on August 28, we surveyed the area and found that the work on the building was far from over. Only a few pillars had been erected,? said Kamal Goswami of the firm.

 It wrote to the ER authorities on September 2, requesting them to provide sites for it to begin work. Three days later, the railway authorities sought an explanation from the firm. The high court was moved on September 8.

 ?We have lodged our complaint with the railway minister and explained the situation to him. The railway authorities are trying to hush up their failure by pointing fingers at us,? Goswami alleged. 

 The project had earlier been entangled in legal hassles and work was stalled for nine months.

 Seventy-eight coal plot-holders had moved the high court after ER had asked them to vacate the terminal and move to Dankuni goods yard. On February 15 this year, the court ruled in favour of ER and the site was vacated.

 The railway officials said the three platforms of the terminal were being readied. Work on the deep pit, circulating area, carriage and wagon office and sick line were nearing completion, they claimed.

 Come together: Akshay Kumar at the Special Olympics 

in Delhi

 He is a khiladi on screen and off it, too. Akshay Kumar has always used his star status to touch the lives of people around him. A week ago, he was at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi alongside chief minister Sheila Dikshit as the brand ambassador of the Special Olympics. The five-day-long games is aimed at reaching the physically and mentally challenged through the world of sports.

 Bringing smiles to most of the thousands of special athletes in the tournament, Akshay said: ?We should treat them equally and they should deserve the same respect, fame and adulation like other normal athletes.? 

 He added: ?There?s nothing shameful about being psychologically challenged. There are 30 million mentally challenged people in India. Of these 95 percent live their lives in anonymity. Their own parents and families treat them as shameful secrets. That?s so wrong.?

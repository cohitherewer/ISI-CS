A musical canvas was unveiled at Akar Prakar at P 238 Hindustan Park recently. Featuring painter Animesh Dutta?s works, the exhibition was kicked off with a musical performance by Prabhu Edouard, Raul Sengupta and Apurba Mukherjee on tabla, conga and dafli. A spirited performance by the trio did justice to the theme ? Beats and the Beauty. 

 ?We always prefer to start our exhibitions with a touch of melody. After all, painting and music seem to be natural allies,? said Reena Lath of Akar Prakar.

 The mixed media works were largely untitled in which the presence of women and related facets were hard to miss. Jhansi ki rani, Lovers in moonlight, Lady and her cat, Boy and goat were some of the works on display. 

 ?The moods of a woman inspire me to paint. If you can capture the right moments, you can do wonderful work,? said Animesh.

 Marriage menu

 It took first-hand experience of organising nine weddings and a year of continuous research for Anju Poddar, a Sanskrit graduate with a bachelor?s degree in engineering, to write a handbook on Rajasthani weddings. 

 The Delhiite married in Calcutta and now settled in Hyderabad launched her second book titled A Wedding in the House, at a private party hosted jointly by socialites Parul Swarup and Bharati Deveshwar at Parul?s plush Alipore residence on Tuesday afternoon. The book was inaugurated by the author?s mother-in-law Parvati Devi Poddar. 

 The afternoon chill and a light drizzle forced the merry crowd of over a hundred lovely ladies from the beautiful garden of the Swarup residence into the large drawing room where the author shared her experiences. 

 ?When my two daughters got married, I jotted detailed notes on all things required for the countless rituals and ceremonies. Last year, there were seven marriages in the family. That?s when I seriously started penning these notes and circulating it among elders in the family to check if an idea like this could help someone organise a wedding,? shared Anju. 

 After several editing sessions, the rough manuscript was circulated among members of the younger generation to gauge their reaction as well. ?Most of them didn?t understand half the terms I had used, so I thought of including a glossary that explains most of the colloquial terms in the book,? she added. 

 The afternoon setting at the book launch was as festive as in a real wedding. Traditional wedding songs and strains of shehnai in the background and a home-made spread of delicious khana was in store for the invitees. 

 ?Anju has always written with an effort to help people in their work and that?s what makes this book interesting as well. It?s a complete guide to organising a wedding,? felt Bharati Deveshwar. 

 ?It?s like bringing a granny home. This book traces traditions and rituals to the roots,? agreed Parul. 

 The book contains text in both Hindi and English and is richly illustrated with paintings depicting traditional wedding ceremonies. ?This would not have been possible without the help of Sheetal Bangur of Samay Books who gave life to my concept,? acknowledged Poddar.

 New spark

 The fourth birthday bash of Sparkz, the two-storey bowling alley and game parlour tucked away under the Majerhat Bridge in New Alipore, proved to be a gala affair this weekend. 

 The late afternoon celebrations kicked off with a fresh face in DJing, Shakey, taking to console. The 15-plus adolescent gang were jammed into a carting area converted into a makeshift dance floor, rocking to popular numbers like Dhoom and Superstar. 

 Post-leg shake it was time for refreshments and a hungry lot queued up for the cake-cutting ceremony. Model Pinky was the benevolent lady lending glamour and a helping hand at distributing the cakes.

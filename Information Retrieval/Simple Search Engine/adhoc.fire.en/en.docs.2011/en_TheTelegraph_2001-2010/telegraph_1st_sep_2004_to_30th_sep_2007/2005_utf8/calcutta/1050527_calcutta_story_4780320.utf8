 Crumpled chic in summer style

 High on the comfort quotient 

 and scoring with its understated sheen, linen is a rage on 

 the fabric front, says Smita Roy Chowdhury

 It has been climbing the popularity charts steadily since last summer and, going by the dazzling display it received at the recently-held India Fashion Week (IFW), linen is clearly here to stay. 

 From JJ Valayas Tintin line and Raghavendra Rathores elegant mens wear to city designer Kiran Uttam Ghoshs take on the flapper girl and Rajesh Pratap Singhs school girl ensembles, linen shaped the silhouettes in many a collection this season.

 Indeed, this power loom fabric from the natural fibre flax has been firmly in fashion focus throughout last year, with many of our hottest design honchos dabbling with it. And not just Indian designers, linen has found favour with international biggies like Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan among others, who have introduced it on the world ramp.

 Says designer Raghavenrda Rathore: Unlike khadi, which has stuck to the roots and never matured, linen has moved into the mainstream and is doing very well. The huge variety of weaves that it comes in now has helped it evolve. This has been fuelled by the fact that the mature consumer today understands fabrics and is ready for the sophisticated care linen needs.

 He adds: Manufacturers today are keen to interact with designers and understand their needs. So they are producing linen in interesting combinations with cotton and also in various vibrant shades.

 Kiran Uttam Ghosh agrees. Linen is today better marketed and priced than ever before, she feels. Her introduction to the fabric happened at Jayashree Textiles in Rishra, where she discovered linen in its finest avatars.

 As soft and fine as mulmul, as transparent as net, as textured as raw silk ? linen is versatile and yet so breathable and basic. I firmly believe this is just the beginning of its mass appeal, she says.

 The comfortable natural threads have already gained considerable momentum. While its popularity in India started more with men, its slowly catching up with women as well.

 Linen comprises 80 per cent of the total mens wear collection at our store. And linen trousers account for 90 per cent of mens lowers, reveals a spokesperson of Be:, the multi-label store from the house of Raymond.

 It is permeating the womens racks, too. Two years ago when we launched the linen line at our store, there werent many takers for the fabric. People were not aware of it and hence not ready to pay for the casual, dull look. But now things have changed. Linen has suddenly become fashionable and people are going for it, despite the fact that it costs much more than cotton, she adds.

 What works for linen apart from the comfort factor and its versatility is the crumpled chic look. Linen is about being luxurious, but not formal or fussy or dressed up. Its relaxed and it works for shorts as well as suits and of course shirts, points out Kiran.

 The Calcutta outlet of Cotton World also boasts a wide variety in linen garments that are moving fast. From kurtas for college students to suits for office goers, linen works well in everything. And not just that, one can wear a linen shirt to work and sport the same one at an evening do. The crushed look only adds to the charm of the fabric, observes Kamna Saraf, proprietor of the store.

 However, for those not at home with the crumpled look, new mixes of the high-maintenance fabric with varying percentages of cotton ensure smoother finishes and better all-day endurance. The common combo is 80 per cent linen and 20 per cent cotton. 

 Full linen is a little stiff and also has the problem of getting crushed. Plus, its difficult to maintain. But once mixed with cotton, the fabric becomes more breathable and looks better, adds Kamna.

 The other draw of linen and the one that gives it an edge over cotton or khadi is its sheen. Linen has the finished shine of power loom and thats why it scores over khadi. Its more expensive than cotton as the fibre is much finer. But like khadi, it keeps you warm in winter and cool in summer and thats why it rates high on the comfort factor, feels Pallabi Basu of FabIndia.

 Who cares if 15 minutes spent ironing a shirt are worthless in 10 minutes? This season, a few creases here and there are just what the design doctor ordered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tighter rules for land use in Howrah

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In an attempt to check unplanned construction in Howrah and its adjoining areas, the government has adopted a plan ? Land Use Development Control Plan ? and issued a series of regulations under it. 

 Prepared by Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the plan came into effect on January 1. 

 It lays down the rules relating to development of land, construction of residential and commercial estates and protection of waterbodies and heritage buildings. 

 The entire town has been divided into nine zones, based on land use: 

C: commercial 

and residential; 

CI: commercial 

and other use;

RI: industrial 

and residential;

R: 

residential;

RF: public utility, 

common facility centre and eateries;

MW: transport 

terminal and mercantile; 

G: 

general;

UA: railway and 

port;

SU: special use.

 Construction of industrial estates, hazardous industrial units and wholesale markets have been banned in the C, CI, RI and RF zones. All plots and premises within 500 m on either side of Kona Expressway come within the SU zone, where only restricted construction activities will be allowed. 

 According to CMDA officials, the government does not want Kona Expressway to become another VIP Road, which is now flanked by rows of ?unplanned concrete mass?. 

 The government has also planned several development projects such as IT hubs, parking lots, small and medium hotels, educational institutions, hospitals and common facility centres for Howrah.

 The development plan has clarified the rules regarding construction of buildings, including ground coverage, mandatory open space, means of access, height and width of the building, provisions for car parking and terms and conditions for building commercial and industrial estates.

 ?We want to develop Howrah, whose importance is only next to Calcutta, in a very planned manner,? said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya. ?Howrah is older than Calcutta and hence, the growth has been very unplanned. The pressure on the town is increasing by the day because of unavailability of space,? he added. 

 CMDA director-general Tushar Mitra said the new rules would have to be followed by all development agencies, including Howrah Municipal Corporation. 

 The plan, he stressed, aims at putting an end to the indiscriminate construction activities in the town.

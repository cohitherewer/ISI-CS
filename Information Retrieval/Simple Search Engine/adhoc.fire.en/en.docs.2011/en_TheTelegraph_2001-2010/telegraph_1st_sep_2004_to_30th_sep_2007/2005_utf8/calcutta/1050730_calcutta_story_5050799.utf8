The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Test centres showcaused

 JAYANTA BASU

 It was a quick buck at the cost of the city?s lungs. But the law has finally caught up with the pollution pirates.

 Three weeks after Metro exposed a scam involving false auto-emission certificates issued by ?foolproof? pollution under control (PUC) centres in and around the city, the government has decided to showcause the errant units.

 As a result, Super Avenue Service Station (Shyambazar), Auto Emission Testing Centre (Harish Chatterjee Street), Council Service Station (Diamond Harbour Road) and Sen Service Station (Salkia) may face licence cancellation and subsequent closure.

 The punitive step was based on a report submitted by a public vehicles department (PVD) probe team, which visited the centres on July 14. 

 ?We had a detailed review meeting with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board on Thursday about malpractice with PUC certificates and decided to showcause the centres,? said H. Mohan, director, PVD. ?If we are not satisfied with their answers, their licences may be suspended,? he added.

 The threat of penalisation has thrown the auto test centres concerned into a tizzy. ?We are yet to receive any notice but once we do, the future course of action will be decided after consulting our lawyer and the other centres,? offered Sushil Ganeriwala, owner of Council Service station.

 During its investigations, the PVD probe team had also found some machines used for testing to have defective software. ?We are calling the manufacturers and the Automotive Research Association of India ? the certifying agency ? at the earliest to discuss this issue,? Mohan added.

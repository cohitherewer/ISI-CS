The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Abhishek?s my love interest?

 So bluffed funnyman RITEISH to Pratim D. Gupta

 Riteish in Mr Ya Miss

 You have two releases in three weeks...

 It?s entirely accidental. I first heard that I might have two releases on the same day. I am glad that?s not happened.

 First up is Mr Ya Miss. Is your character as dumb as it has been made to look?

 My character is not dumb. He is too sincere a guy. I remember Antara (Mali) telling me that he is Amol Palekar. It is Antara?s character that is the butt of all the jokes. She changes from a guy to a girl. So, when I fall in love with Antara, the audience thinks that I am singing a song for Aftab.

 What was it like being directed by Antara Mali?

 Working with Antara is always super. I acted with her in Naach. Antara is the first woman director I have worked with. She has three parts in the film ? writer, director and actress ? and she has excelled in all the parts. She has the clarity of mind and is in total control. Antara has all the makings of a good director.

 On December 16, you return as a conman. How was the Bluffmaster experience?

 For me, Bluffmaster is a film which has amazing romance, a tinge of comedy, suspense, thrill? It encompasses everything it should. I found it to be very contemporary. Yet, it has many ?massy? elements. There?s a nice balance.

 Riteish with Abhishek Bachchan in Bluffmaster

 Abhishek?s love interest is Priyanka. Who is yours?

 Abhishek Bachchan!

 How was he to work with?

 Working with Abhishek is great fun. He is a fantastic actor. We got along very well and became real good friends. He is like a brother to me. I will never let go an opportunity to work with him.

 You also got to work with Amitabh Bachchan in Darna Zaroori Hai?

 Every actor in the industry lives to work with him and I was lucky enough to have an entire episode with him. Now, even I can tell my grandchildren that I have worked with Amitabh Bachchan. Darna Zaroori Hai also gave me another opportunity to work under Ram Gopal Varma. I postponed the Kya Kool Hai Hum shooting by two days to do it.

 Why be stereotyped as a comic actor?

 I enjoy doing comedy. I would love to play a romantic lead but I don?t know if I can pull it off. So, I would rather be part of films that would work at the box-office.

 What else is coming up?

 Priyadarshan?s Malaamal Weekly and Sohail Khan?s Fight Club are ready for release. I will start shooting for films with Sangeeth Sivan, David Dhawan and Indra Kumar.

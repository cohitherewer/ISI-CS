Calling all animal lovers who care

January 14 to 31 is celebrated as Animal Welfare Fortnight 

every year. Two weeks of the year in which animal rescue workers and animal welfare 

organisations try to awaken in the public conscience a sense of compassion towards 

animals. This awareness is created through radio-television shows, exhibitions, 

seminars, vaccination camps, sterilisations and adoptions.

Animal welfare is not merely an issue of emotion; 

it is the need of the hour. Lack of kindness and public awareness has led to increasing 

crimes against animals. For the success of animal welfare schemes, hard work, 

commitment and dedication are needed. And finally, some NGOs of Calcutta are putting 

their best foot forward.

Ashari has launched two new services: Pet Aid and 

Bon Adieu. The Pet Aid service is a critical care ambulance for transporting the 

pet to the clinic. It will have a trained para-veterinarian on board to help lift 

the pet tenderly and administer any emergency treatment that may be required.

The Bon Adieu service is a hearse for pets. It will 

be available for two people to accompany their pet on his last journey to Karuna 

Kunj, bury the pet and return home with the comfort of knowing that they have 

given a dignified farewell to the companion who gave them a lifetime of love and 

loyalty. Also, Ashari will be open to adopting animals from January 22.

Love N Care for Animals kicked off the animal welfare 

fortnight with an anti-rabies vaccination drive for stray dogs in Golf Garden. 

Also on the agenda is a rally to be held on January 22 at 11.30 am, starting from 

Thakurpukur thana to Behala thana. This rally will be led by schoolchildren 

who will submit a memorandum, along with the PCA Act, to the officials at both 

police stations.

Love N Care believes cruel acts towards animals can 

be signs of worse things to come, often with human victims. Thus the urgent need 

to instil a sense of respect for all forms of life. These children will grow up 

to be animal nurturing adults! The NGO?s animal adoption will happen on January 

21.

Animal Relief and Care Society on its part is organising 

a vaccination drive in areas like Deshapriya Park, Hindustan Road, Manoharpukur, 

Hazra and Dover Road. The NGO is also engaged in an extensive programme of re-housing 

abandoned animals.

As a society, we need to demand stronger sanctions 

for crimes committed against animals. We need to take a firm stand and proclaim 

that animal cruelty will not be tolerated or disregarded. Ignoring it only invites 

more violence. 

Many celebrity animal lovers will also be a part of 

the welfare fortnight, participating in vaccination drives, rallies and adoption 

programmes.

Please come and join us. Let?s make it a big success.

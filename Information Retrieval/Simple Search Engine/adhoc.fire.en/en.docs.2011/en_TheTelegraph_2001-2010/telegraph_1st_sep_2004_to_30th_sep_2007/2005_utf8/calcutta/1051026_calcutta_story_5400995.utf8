 Crore cut

 Jackpot jack: Brijesh Dubey with Amitabh Bachchan on the KBC 2 sets

Aquick flip through some general knowledge books and voila, you have your first crorepati of Kaun Banega Crorepati Dwitiya.

 A resident of Guna in Madhya Pradesh, Brijesh Dubey is a 33-year-old electricals graduate who became the highest prize winner of the second edition of the Amitabh Bachchan-hosted show on October 20.

 The episode will be shown on STAR Plus on November 5, after the Diwali specials with the K-serial characters ? Tulsi and Parvati ? are taken care of.

 Despite being a big fan of Bachchan, the gameplan Brijesh adopted for his hot-seat stint was not to look Amitji in the eye, as advised by his father. So with minimal interaction, unlike most other KBC participants, Brijesh marched ahead and bagged the crore.

 The only contestants who have been able to win a crore in KBC 2 have been Ajay Devgan and Kajol in the special celebrity episode where the money went to a cancer hospital in Chennai supported by film-maker Mani Ratnam.

 Realtor a suspect

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police investigating the murder of 71-year-old Laxmi Sundaram in her Bishop Lefroy Road apartment are now focussing on a promoter and a broker, who had met the widow a number of times, requesting her to sell off the flat. A hunt is on for the duo. 

 According to police, the realtor and the broker had met Sundaram a few days before she was brutally killed. 

 ?We came to know about them during the course of our conversation with Rajkumar, her son based in Washington DC,? said an officer of the detective department.

 ?The promoter was keen to purchase the flat and settle a deal with Sundaram. But he was refused whenever he made the offer. Recently, Sundaram had expressed her displeasure over his repeated offers to buy her out,? said the officer.

 Police said recently, she had spoken to Rajkumar about this. ?Annoyed with the promoter?s request, she called up her son and told him about the proposal. She never wanted to sell the apartment,? said an officer of detective department?s homicide wing.

 Initially, police had no knowledge about the realtor and the broker. 

 ?No one of the victim?s family told us about them. During the second phase of examination, Rajkumar recalled that his mother had told him about the two men,? said another officer of the detective department.

 On Sunday, police opened the apartment in which the woman was killed for the sake of the Sundaram family members and other relatives. 

 Both sons of the deceased entered the flat and examined the almirahs from where jewellery worth several lakhs was robbed.

 After interrogating a colleague of the deceased?s husband on Saturday, police found no lead. ?We checked the relationship between the victim?s husband and his colleague,? said an officer, adding: ?No specific lead has, so far, emerged and we have no idea about the assassins, either. We are going through every possible aspect of the case.?

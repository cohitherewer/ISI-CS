 Visual pollution in the city must be monitored directly by the pollution control board. True, billboards are a source of revenue for the Corporation and a good medium to advertise about public welfare schemes. But why do the civic body and state government have to put up billboards publicising every work that they do? Who would want to know from a billboard that the Corporation has planted 30,000 saplings? It is for all to see on the city streets. Surely, the city skyline doesn?t need more such billboards.

 A postman from the Alipore post office visited my residence on November 8 but refused to hand over the speed post because we had not paid the ?baksheesh of Rs 20 that others pay?. Despite approaching higher authorities, the postman has still not handed over the letter to my authorised representative. On November 10, once again, the postman didn?t deliver a registered post in my name. I request that my letters be delivered to me immediately.

 These days, most private security agencies have their own uniforms. A shop near the Kankurgachhi roundabout has deployed a guard in white uniform. In that attire, the man closely resembles a cop. Passers-by sometimes mistake the shop for a high-security government address. Private security agencies should not be allowed to sport such misleading costumes.

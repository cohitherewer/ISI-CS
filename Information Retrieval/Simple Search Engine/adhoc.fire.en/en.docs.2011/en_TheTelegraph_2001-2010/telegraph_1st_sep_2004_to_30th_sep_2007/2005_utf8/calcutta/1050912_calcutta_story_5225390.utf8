The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Disease outbreak not sudden

Fogging in progress in a city slum. A Telegraph picture

 SUBODH DE, mayoral council member (health), met readers of The Telegraph in his office on Thursday to answer their queries. Participants included Diptimoy Ghosh, Jiten Das, Sandip Banerjee, Baby De, G. Laha, Dipika De, Somen Bhattacharya, Prasanta Dasgupta, Nita Saha, Aroop Biswas, Sukumar Haldar, Mitali Roy, Khookoo Bysack and Putul Sarkar

Aroop Biswas: Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra has described the outbreak of dengue as an ?epidemic?, you have said ?the situation is alarming? and the mayor has claimed that the disease is ?under control?. Whom does the common man believe? 

 There is no benchmark for determining whether dengue has reached epidemic proportions in Calcutta. However, I must admit that infection and death due to dengue have been unusually high this year.

Diptimoy Ghosh: Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is the culprit behind dengue spreading so rapidly. If the health, building, conservancy and drainage departments had worked as a team in the affected areas immediately after the detection of dengue, the spread of the disease could have been checked.

 Yes, 

we initially did fail to work as a team. We are trying to make up for that now.

Sukumar Haldar: Why did the dengue outbreak occur suddenly?

 The present outbreak is not sudden. Like malaria, dengue has been there in the city in its classical form. The doctors used to call it seven-day fever, viral fever or Calcutta fever. Since classical dengue is not a killer disease, nobody took it seriously.

Diptimoy Ghosh: Do you think you have enough logistical support to combat dengue and malaria?

 We 

have enough anti-mosquito chemicals, but lack manpower to use them. Out of the 

106 swing fog machines, only 40 are in working condition. We have procured 30 

new fog machines recently.

Jiten Das: I am a retired CMC engineer. I have designed a mechanical device to clean sewers and drains.

 Give us a demonstration first.

Sandip Banerjee: We had Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes in the city. Where did Aedes come from? 

 Aedes are basically jungle mosquitoes, but they have been in Calcutta all along. Unplanned urbanisation, filling up of waterbodies, mushrooming of slums and shanties have created a favourable environment for their large-scale breeding.

Mitali Roy: How can one identify dengue-causing mosquitoes?

 When drawing blood, dengue mosquitoes sit parallel to the skin. Other mosquitoes sit at an angle to the skin. Besides, Aedes are larger in size and have white spots on the legs.

Khookoo Bysack: While you are leading a fight against dengue in other parts of the city, a man has died of malignant malaria in your own ward (ward no. 29).

 I have not been informed about the casualty. My health officers might have feared that they would face criticism if they work in my ward.

Aroop Biswas: There are 12 wards under borough 10, which has 12 swing fog machines, out of which only three are in running condition. There is a dearth of chemicals and medicine. You demanded more machines, chemicals and medicine for borough 10, but the mayor did not comply. Is that why you wanted to resign during a recent meeting?

 Why should I resign? There is no shortage of chemicals or medicine in the central store.

G. Laha: The CMC doesn?t care to repair potholes on the smaller roads and in lanes. As a result, even short spells of rain fill up the potholes. Don?t you think this is bad for public health?

 Yes, they are. Dirty water is always harmful as it harbours germs. The civic authorities should repair the potholes as soon as possible.

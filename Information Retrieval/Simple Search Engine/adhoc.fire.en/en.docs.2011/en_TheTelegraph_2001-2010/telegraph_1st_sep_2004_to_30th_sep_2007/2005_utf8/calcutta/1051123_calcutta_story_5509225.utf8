 Crisis prompts nurses? talent hunt

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Every year, private hospitals in the city lose around 30 per cent of their nurses to jobs in the UK, US, West Asia and even south India. A ?talent hunt? for nurses next month promises to be the first move to fill the vacancies.

 BM Birla Heart Research Centre has taken the lead to organise a unique congregation of nurses, titled Cascade, on December 2 and 3, where students from St Xavier?s, Lady Brabourne, Loreto and several other reputed city colleges will be introduced to the prospect of taking up nursing as a profession. 

 ?At present, most hospitals in the private sector are reeling under a crisis of efficient nursing staff. We are hoping to draw educated girls from respectable backgrounds to join the profession, which for years has been looked down upon,? said Suyash Borar, chief operating officer of the institute.

 ?With money flowing into the profession, we are on the constant look-out for quality nurses, who are, sadly, not in abundance in the city. Once city girls come forward to join the profession, the entire healthcare scenario here will undergo a sea change,? said Avanti Gopan, nursing director of both BM Birla and Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI).

 Fourteen nursing colleges from across the country will participate in the two-day event, which will also serve as a talent hunt for nurses. Colleges from Mangalore, Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai and Bhilai will also take part.

 ?We are desperately trying to get across the message that a graduate can definitely earn about Rs 10,000 a month. Gradual hikes in pay can be expected. Elsewhere in the country, many girls, just out of college, have started to realise that it is paying and satisfying to be a nurse,? Gopan added.

 In Calcutta, the shortage of nurses in private hospitals is anywhere between 30 and 50 per cent. ?Right now, we are short of nurses by almost 50 per cent. We are already scouting for quality candidates to fill the vacancies,? said Amit De, the chief executive officer at CMRI.

 Healthcare experts feel that the shortage can be attributed to the exodus of nursing professionals from city hospitals to places either in south India or abroad. 

 ?Our analysis shows that about 30 per cent nurses leave the city hospitals every year for better prospects. But not as many quality nurses come in as replacements,? Gopan elaborated.

 The crisis has resulted in deviations from the specified nurse-patient ratio in both government and private hospitals in the city. A nurse is supposed to attend to four patients in each ward and in ICUs, the ratio should be 1:1. 

 ?We can?t reveal what the average ratio is in most of the private hospitals, but it is definitely not what is specified,? admitted a senior official of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India.

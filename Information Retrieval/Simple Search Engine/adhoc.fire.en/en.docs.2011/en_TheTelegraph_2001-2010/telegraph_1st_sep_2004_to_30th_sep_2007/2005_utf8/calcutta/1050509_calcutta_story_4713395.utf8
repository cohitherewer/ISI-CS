 Shot in bag snatch bid

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Shot in the stomach by two men trying to snatch a bagful of money a stone?s throw away from Amherst Street police station on Saturday evening, Tapas Chatterjee, 35, fought back and prevented the duo from escaping with the bag.

 No onlooker came to his aid, and the seriously-injured Chatterjee chose to hail a taxi and go to his friend?s house rather than turn to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s men in uniform for help.

 ?Two youths had tried to snatch a bag containing Rs 85,000 in cash from Chatterjee while he was walking along Amherst Street, around 8 pm,? said Barun Kumar Mullick, deputy commissioner of police (north), on Sunday. ?There was a scuffle and one of the criminals shot him in the abdomen,? Mullick added.

 A sales executive with a private firm, with its office located near Wellington Square, in central Calcutta, Chatterjee was out collecting cash dues from clients late on Saturday. 

 He had already collected Rs 85,000, and was making his rounds when he was attacked.

 In front of St Paul?s Cathedral Mission College, about 100 m from Amherst Street police station, Chatterjee noticed two youths following him. Fearing trouble, he tucked the bag under his arm, clutched it tightly, and stepped up his pace.

 The two men realised that Chatterjee had become aware of their presence and ran after him. Catching up with Chatterjee within seconds, they attacked him. A scuffle ensued, but the frail Chatterjee refused to let go of the bag.

 A crowd started gathering around the tangled trio even as vehicles whizzed by, but no one ever tried to help the lone victim. Blows rained on Chatterjee, but he stood his ground. 

 Exasperated, the youths took out a chopper and improvised firearms. This prompted Chatterjee to move closer to them, allowing them minimal room to manoeuvre.

 One of the youths fired a round into Chatterjee?s left side, and he fell. Even then, the two men couldn?t loosen his grip on the bag. When he shouted for help, the youths panicked and fled.

 Blood-soaked and barely conscious, Chatterjee kept calling out for help, but in vain. So, he hailed a taxi and went over to a friend?s house in Phoolbagan. 

 From there, he was taken to a north Calcutta nursing home. The bullet was firmly lodged in his abdomen. An FIR was recorded after officers from Amherst Street police station met Chatterjee in hospital.

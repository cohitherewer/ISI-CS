 Mughlai melange

 KITCHEN 

 CAPER

 Be it the authentic aromatic mix or 

 the customised regional variations, the biryani finds favour 

 in all forms, says Zeeshan Jawed

 Biryani tops just about 

 everyones list of gastronomic favourites. Proof of 

 its popularity is the variations that have been devised 

 for this melange of rice and meat and spices. The aromatic 

 concoction has been perfected by low-budget eateries, while 

 it also graces the finest dining tables at five-star addresses.

 But what makes the dish that evolved 

 in Arab kitchens cut across religious and cultural lines? 

 Why does the mere mention of this meal-in-itself-dish make 

 the mouth water?

 It is the wholesome presentation 

 of biryani that makes it a universal favourite. You 

 will fall in love with the dish even before you take the 

 first spoon, says Mohammed Shawket, owner of Shiraz 

 Golden Restaurant on Park Street. The Mughlai speciality 

 address lit its chulha in 1970 and has since become 

 something of a yardstick on Food Street when it comes to 

 biryani.

 The heady aroma of the spices 

 intermingled with rice, slight tang to the aftertaste contribute 

 to the popularity, feels Shawket.

 The ingredients required to rustle 

 up a mouth-watering plate of biryani are hardly exotic. 

 Typically, biryani is a mix of rice, meat, lots of 

 spices, tomatoes and yoghurt to provide a tangy taste.

 What is it that separates good 

 biryani from hotchpotch? It is the consistency, 

 stresses Shawkat. You have to know the right quantity 

 of meat, spices and oil that have to be added to a particular 

 quantity of rice.

 Though the use of chicken and 

 fish is rampant, in the olden days lamb was the preferred 

 choice of meat. Leg pieces are cut into big chunks and marinated 

 in yoghurt and ginger, garlic and onion paste to tenderise 

 it. Special varieties of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, 

 clove and mace powder are added.

 The dish, thought to be a hit 

 with the Muslim community, is actually as popular across 

 the board. Every region adds local flavour to customise 

 it to their taste. In Kashmir, pulao is biryani. 

 It is cooked in mutton stock and cardamom and cinnamon are 

 the spices used. For colour and flavour, saffron and turmeric 

 are added in very small quantities, says Shanker Kaul, 

 whose catering company Bouin serves Wazwan, or Kashmiri 

 cuisine.

 Though the Hyderabadi biryani 

 has a lot of Muslim influence, it has its own character. 

 A lot of rose water, mace powder, yoghurt and spices are 

 used. Coriander and eggs are garnishes, says chef 

 S. Kannan of Tamarind.

 Coorg too boasts its own strain 

 of biryani, which is a little different both in taste 

 and colour. Lots of green chillis and coriander lend 

 a green colour to the dish. The spices used are cloves and 

 cinnamon, says Kannan.

 Chettinad Chicken Biryani involves 

 the use of coconut milk and kalpa seeds and roasted 

 gram. The end product is off-white in colour. Andhra Kodi 

 (chicken) Pulao, on the other hand, packs in a lot of spices 

 along with green chillis and curry leaves. The fish lover 

 can go for Malabar Fish Biryani, in which fish is deep-fried 

 and seasoned with ginger, cumin, black pepper, red chillis 

 and coconut paste.

 Over the years the preparation 

 of biryani has undergone changes. In normal 

 households, microwave ovens and electric stoves have taken 

 over from copper vessels and charcoal. The concept of vegetarian 

 biryani (!) has also slipped into kitchens. Many 

 put milk and dry fruits, which robs the biryani of 

 its usual aroma and tangy taste and adds sweetness to it, 

 adds Kaul.

 But all experiments aside, biryani 

 continues to be a favourite for foodies far and wide. 

 As long as the palate is pleased, it is likely to find favour 

 in all its forms.

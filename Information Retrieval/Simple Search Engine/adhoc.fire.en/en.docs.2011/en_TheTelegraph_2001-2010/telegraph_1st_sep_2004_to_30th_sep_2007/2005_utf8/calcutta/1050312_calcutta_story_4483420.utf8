The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, first Nor?wester

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The season?s first Nor?wester drenched the city on Friday afternoon. The showers brought a respite from the sweltering heat of a premature summer. 

 Rainfall was recorded at 4.4 mm. ?The shower led to a fall in temperature,? said K.K. Chakraborty, chief of the regional meteorological centre in Alipore. The forecast for Saturday is of a partly cloudy sky, with possibility of rain and thunderstorms.

Fair closed: Friday?s downpour forced organisers 

of the annual IT exhibition COMPASS 2005 to close the fair on Saturday. ?Water 

has seeped into the stalls and we have to protect the fair from any damage,? said 

a spokesperson. The five-day exhibition was inaugurated on Friday.

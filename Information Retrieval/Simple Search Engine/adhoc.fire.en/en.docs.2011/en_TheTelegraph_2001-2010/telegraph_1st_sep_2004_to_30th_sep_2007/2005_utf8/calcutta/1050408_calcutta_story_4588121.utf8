 Confession by Gunjan wife

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rumela, wife of Roma Jhawar abduction mastermind Gunjan Ghosh, confessed before Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials on Thursday that she had played a role in the kidnap of Mithun Koley, son of a Dum Dum-based businessman, who was later murdered.

 She gave a confessional statement before sub-divisional magistrate of Salt Lake Bipasha Mondal, enabling the CID to reopen the Koley abduction and murder case. 

 ?Rumela told us how she had called Koley to meet her in front of a restaurant in Salt Lake that day,? said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general (operations), CID.

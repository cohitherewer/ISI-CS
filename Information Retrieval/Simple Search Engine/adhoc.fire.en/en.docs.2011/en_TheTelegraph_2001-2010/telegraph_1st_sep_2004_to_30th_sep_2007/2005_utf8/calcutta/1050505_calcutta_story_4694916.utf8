 A creative quest

 Driven by an intense urge for creativity, Piu Sarkar creates in her world of canvas and colours an infinite space, where she can spontaneously pour out her energies and emotions. Her works of art are the result of intimate, private experiences and encounters that she undertakes in her attempt to discover the ?real world?; a realm that remains concealed from everyday human consciousness. In Search of Reality and Red, the ongoing exhibition of her sketches and drawings, finds her portraying the eternal dichotomy between the conscious and sub-conscious planes of human existence, thus carrying on a creative search to arrive at the ultimate truth and reality of life. Mostly done in acrylic on canvas or with ink and charcoal on paper, Sarkar depicts semi-abstract, solitary female forms, and at times, nondescript faces with large, over-powering eyes, emotionally charged, but tinged with melancholy and angst. The raw impulsiveness which often spills out of her creative process, only serves to accentuate her impatience and restlessness with life as it appears to her at present.

 Event: An exhibition of drawings and sketches by Piu Sarkar

 When: Till May 22, 3 pm - 8 pm

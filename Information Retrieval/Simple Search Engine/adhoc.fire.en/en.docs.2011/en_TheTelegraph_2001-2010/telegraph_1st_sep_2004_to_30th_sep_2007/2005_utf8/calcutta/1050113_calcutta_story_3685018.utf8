The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Anytime is tea time

ZEESHAN JAWED

 From the cha and adda town, to the mocktail and masti metro, we?ve sure come some distance. But battling the nightclub wave and the coffee shop craze is a motley group of tea addresses in Calcutta. With the beverage in various forms now invading youth hotspots, thanks to a Tea Board initiative, Goodlife stops for a sip at some evergreen and some freshly-brewed tea stops.

First up, of course, is Flurys. Five generations old 

and with a new look and menu, Calcutta?s ?only tea room? remains the epicentre 

of Park Street. The refrigerator (with its new array of fresh cream products) 

and the aquarium (the latest addition to the swank new d?cor) may be add-ons, 

but the lazy never-ending breakfasts are just the same with those tea-pots finding 

pride of place.

 ?The brand name of Flurys has remained untouched over all these years and it still stands tall as the country?s most popular tea room,? says Vijay Dewan, managing director of The Park Hotels, which owns Flurys. ?With this renovation, we want to create new energy in the zone.?

 Down south, Teacosy, which started in 2000, has played the health ? rather than hangout ? card. ?When we opened, the idea was to provide soft-drink addicts with an option which was not only cool and tasty but also healthy. Even those who drank tea deserved a change of taste and flavour. So, we started this small venture that today has a large clientele,? says Kaushik Biswas, business development executive of Golden Tips that owns Teacosy.

 The Charnock City Tollygunge address boasts of fruity flavours like orange, pineapple, litchi and apple. ?But there are people who come to the caf? only for a taste of the ice-cold lemon tea,? comments Kaushik.

Dolly?s Tea Shop in Dakshinapan offers a host of unique 

blends. There is Tea Fruit Cup, Tea Punch (laced with ginger ale and lemonade), 

Grapefruit Cooler, Pineapple Pitcher, Mango Tea, Tea Float (with a dollop of ice-cream 

and honey), Tea Shake, Tutti Frutti Tea (with fruit, ice cream and jam), Ginger 

Tea, Tea Cocoa, Masala Chai, Cardamom Tea? The shop is shaped like a hut, lit 

with bright lanterns and candles, plays soft music and is a favourite for many.

 Cha Bar at the Oxford Bookstore and the seven-month-old The Tea Junction at City Centre are modelled on the talk-up-a-storm-in-a-teacup culture of Calcutta.

 ?Books, cha and adda go hand in hand. But tea was losing out to coffee in more ways than one. So we decided to present the various unknown flavours of tea and serve them to a niche market,? says Rajiv Chowdhury, COO of E. Books World Private Limited, about Cha Bar. ?The 24-seater place provides a refreshing pause between browsing books.?

 The popular picks in the Oxford Bookstore corner are Peach Tea, Green Tea and Masala Chai.

 At The Tea Junction in City Centre, tea ? served in khullars (earthen tea cups), at that ? is popular because the milieu of the mall is in sync with cha and adda, feels Manish Pandey, manager F amp;B, Ambuja Hospitality Division. So here you wash down samosas, kachoris and gulab jamuns with Masala Chai, Elaichi Chai or Kesar Chai.

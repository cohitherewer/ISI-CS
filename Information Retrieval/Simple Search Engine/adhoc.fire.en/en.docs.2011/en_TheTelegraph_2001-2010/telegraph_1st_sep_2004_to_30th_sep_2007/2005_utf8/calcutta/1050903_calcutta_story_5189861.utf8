The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lawyer arrest stayed

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A single-judge bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday sentenced lawyer Sankar Sen to three days? civil imprisonment. Sen was found guilty of selling disputed land on the EM Bypass after he had been appointed court receiver.

 Moments later, as preparations were being made for his arrest, Sen moved a division bench, which stayed till Monday the imprisonment order of Justice P.K. Samanta.

 The bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly asked Sen to file an appeal on Saturday. The matter will be heard on Monday. ?Sen is an advocate and there is no possibility of his absconding. We are restraining police from arresting him till Monday,? the bench observed.

 Before issuing the arrest order, Justice Samanta asked Sen if he had anything to say about the conviction. Sen, hands folded before a packed courtroom, replied: ?I have said what I had to.?

 The judge ruled that the petitioners, owner of the disputed land on the EM Bypass, could now file a criminal case against Sen.

 After the judgment, Sen was taken to a chamber by personnel of the deputy sheriff?s office. While the officers were waiting for a copy of the judgment, Sen?s counsel ? A.K. Ghoshal and P.P. Mukherjee ? moved the division bench.

 ?A lawyer has been sent to jail for contempt. Please allow him to prove himself innocent,? the lawyers pleaded.

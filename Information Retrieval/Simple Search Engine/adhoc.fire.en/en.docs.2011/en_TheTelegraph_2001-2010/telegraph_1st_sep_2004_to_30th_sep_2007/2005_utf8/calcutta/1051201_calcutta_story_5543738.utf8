 Count three on Day III

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city recorded the third road mishap death in three days on Wednesday, when an unidentified youth was knocked down by a private bus in Ultadanga. The driver managed to flee with his vehicle.

 Police said the victim was standing close to one of the pavements on CIT Road, near the VSNL office, when he was crushed under the wheels of the bus, on route 44 (Baguiati-Howrah). 

 ?The bus was heading towards Kankurgachhi. After crossing the CIT Road-EM Bypass intersection, the driver increased the speed abruptly. He lost control after overtaking a car, veered to the left and ran over the victim,? said a police officer.

 ?Local residents gathered on the spot immediately and took the youth to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. He was dead by then,? said a traffic department official.

 A section of the residents blocked CIT Road and staged a demonstration against reckless driving. Some alleged that traffic sergeants were hardly seen patrolling the stretch ? they were mostly busy collecting money from goods vehicles and taxis at the Ultadanga crossing.

 Meanwhile, the victim of Tuesday?s rash driving has been identified as Reba Mallik, 58, a resident of Kalikumar Banerjee Lane, in Chitpur. She was crushed under the wheels of a private bus, on route 34C, on SN Banerjee Road.

 ?She came to her parents? house on Lenin Sarani. The accident occurred while she was on her way back,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central division). The investigation into the mishap has been handed over to the fatal squad of the traffic department.

 The driver of the killer bus, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, who was arrested and booked under sections 279 and 304A of the IPC, was produced in court on Wednesday and was granted bail. 

 ?He has been released because both sections are bailable. He will have to appear in court on December 13,? said an officer of the fatal squad.

 The bus had mounted the pavement at the intersection of SN Banerjee Road and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and mowed down Reba.

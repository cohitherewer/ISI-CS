 A chic crooner, a vivacious video jockey and a terrific table turner. The Telegraph Tollygunge Club Monsoon Bash on Saturday night was a big splash in the true sense of the term. Calcutta has witnessed quite a few rain dances this season but the one at Tollygunge Club registered the highest rainfall (from the sprinklers, of course) and footfall.

 The evening kickstarted with DJ Akash luring revellers to the makeshift dance floor. You really have to pump up your music to make the club crowd dance, admitted the DJ. His peppy remixes worked and soon Tolly members and guests were jiving to Dhol vajda and Kangna. With the rain gods playing truant, it was left to the sprinklers to liven up the theme night. 

 Next, Shibani Kashyap turned it on, lip-syncing to Ho gayi hai mohabbat tumse and Sajna aabhi jaa. Of late I have been coming to Calcutta quite often. People here are quite receptive to music. I have heard a lot about Tollygunge Club. We are going to keep the people on their feet tonight, said Kashyap.

 Her next sequence comprised hits like Bin tere sanam, Julie and Woh lamhe. Adding to the glamour quotient was VJ Anusha from MTV, the hostess of the show in black top and denims. 

 Freedom song

 With Independence Day around the corner, Open Doors and CC amp;FC celebrated the spirit of the moment with Freedomscape, a musical recital and dance extravaganza at the club on August 6.

 The show involved the creative ardour of noted Calcuttans like Arjun Chakraborty, Usha Uthup, Tanusree Shankar, Sharmila Biswas, Anjum Katyal and Sutapa Bandopadhyay, and Sasha Ganguly from Canada.

 It is the month of our countrys Independence, but we take this opportunity to celebrate the freedom of our individuality, too. An opportunity to celebrate the essence of being free, whether a man or a woman, smiles Oindrilla Dutt of Open Doors.

 While members of the Tanusree Shankar school of dance celebrated the freedom of women matching their steps to rhythmic music, Odissi danseuse Sharmila Biswas and her group enthralled the audience with their vivacious movements.

 The songs were a fine assortment of English, Hindi and Bengali classics.

 Arjun sang patriotic numbers like Itni shakti humein dena data and Kar chale hum fida and Anjums ode to freedom was led by Blowing in the wind. The star stage attraction was Usha Uthup, mesmerising the audience with her evergreen voice, yet again. 

 Friendly feel

 With Friendship Day being the flavour of the month, NiFD on Lindsay Street organised a T-shirt designing competition on August 6. Twenty participants from schools, colleges and the host institute painted the spirit of friendship in vibrant splashes, showcasing their creativity. Designer Shayon Mitra, G.S. Krishna, general manager, Coca-Cola India, and Susan Mantosh, director of NiFD, were the judges. 

 Trendy teens and college-goers often personalise their wardrobe adding a dash of their own creativity. This competition is a platform for these amateur designers to showcase their talent. Out of the 40 applicants, 20 were selected for the final round, explains Shilpi Bhattacharyya, product head of the institution.

 The T-shirts painted in colours from Fevicryl Hobby Ideas were further jazzed up with sequins, mirrors, strings and patchwork. 

 From masks, butterflies, cartoons to catchy slogans, the illustrations were attractive and innovative.

 T. Neerja, Monali Sau and Abhijit Pal were declared winners of the contest.

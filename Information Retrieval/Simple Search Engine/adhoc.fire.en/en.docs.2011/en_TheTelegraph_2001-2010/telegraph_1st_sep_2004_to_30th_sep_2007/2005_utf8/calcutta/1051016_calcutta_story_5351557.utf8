The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Dial D for despair for those who care

Pet Passion - Nilanjanaa

 An 11-year-old student with a stray dog 

on the outskirts of Nairobi. The dog, foraging for food, retrieved an abandoned 

baby girl in a forest and carried the infant to its litter of puppies, across 

a busy road and a barbed wire fence in a neighbourhood bordering the Ngong Forests 

of Nairobi. (AP) 

On September 30, at about 11 pm, my mobile phone rang. 

It was a colleague on the other end, frantic and screaming. She had just seen 

a dog at the Shyambazar five-point crossing being run over by a bus. The dog had 

a deep gash on its neck and was gasping for breath. I called the emergency animal 

ambulance number, only to be met with inane questions. Five minutes later, when 

my colleague called the same number, the emergency mobile was switched off! Finally, 

she got in touch with the same NGO but by the time the van arrived (an hour later), 

the dog had died.

Another animal lover, visiting her grandmother in 

Barasat, was kept awake the whole night by the howling of a dog. It was a pariah 

dog kept confined to a room for 24 hours. Though the neighbours sympathise with 

the dog and slip in food for it whenever possible, they fear the owner, a local 

goon of sorts.

I am sure there are several incidents like these that 

occur in this city. I dread every time someone calls me to report a cruelty or 

an accident case because I feel absolutely helpless. I have the same emergency 

numbers you have and I can do only as much as you can. But please continue calling 

me or reporting such incidents; it only reiterates that we desperately need a 

genuine organisation working for these animals on the street.

As far as the existing NGOs are concerned, if you 

don?t have the compassion or the attitude of selfless service towards animals, 

please shut shop! At least don?t make a farce in the name of animal welfare.

It was heart-warming, an incident reported in Metro, 

on how a bunch of stray dogs kept watch over an abandoned newborn baby the whole 

night and even alerted a puja committee about the same. Previously, the puja committee 

had made all necessary arrangements to ?get rid? of these dogs because it believed 

stray dogs are a nuisance. Now, of course, they are basking in the sudden glory 

that has been bestowed upon their para by the same ?nuisance dogs?. 

I am sure these dogs are unaware of the magnitude 

of their noble deed of saving an abandoned newborn. They did it because instinctively 

they wanted to protect the baby, not to win accolades or a position in society. 

What can I say about those para people? Thank you for letting these dogs 

stay, now that they have justified their existence by saving a human life. But 

you surely need to ask yourself, would Ma Durga be pleased to have witnessed such 

an act of depravity on part of her devotees who had decided to get the dogs picked 

up to clean up their para? I?m sure not.

Time and again, animals (especially dogs) have proved 

their loyalty and undying love for human beings only to be met with suspicious 

and cruelty. How can I point fingers at the lower rungs of society when educated 

people behave in such an irresponsible manner? On this festive occasion, my sincere 

prayers for all citizens ? may you have the heart to share this beautiful city 

with all of God?s creations, stray dogs included.

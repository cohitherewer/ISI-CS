 Theme frenzy out, tradition takes over

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA 

 Durga idols are going back to the conventional for the community Pujas in the city this year

 Replicas of Devdas?s haveli and Mahishasura modelled on bin Laden are pass?. With the theme mania gradually losing its grip on the city, this year the goddess promises to reincarnate in her traditional form. On the other hand, the trend is just the reverse in Calcutta?s suburbs.

 Leading suppliers of idols at Kumartuli say thematic idols, based on mythical characters or in unconventional designs, were the hallmark of city Pujas till two years ago, but not any more. They are being replaced by the age-old conventional idols.

 ?The trend was at a nascent stage in 2004. But this year, it has gained tremendous momentum. We are getting more orders for conservative idols from major clubs and organisers of renowned Pujas in the city,? said Mintu Paul, joint secretary of Kumartuli Mritsilpo Sanskriti Samity, the governing body of the organised artisans of Kumartuli.

 ?Outside the city, the bias is the opposite. On the southern and northern fringes of the city and parts of Howrah town, organisers are shifting to theme-based Pujas. Not only are the idols being designed on mythical characters, but are also being given a different look,? Paul added.

 Kumartuli churns out around 3,000 Durga idols every year. ?The household Pujas invariably opt for traditional idols. Therefore, the trend-shift will be observed mainly in community Pujas,? Paul pointed out.

 In the past few years, of the total number of idols that Kumartuli artisans supplied to the city suburbs, 80 per cent was in the conventional style, while the rest were theme-based. ?However, the disparity is quickly decreasing. Now, the ratio is almost 60:40.?

 Last year, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) had conducted a survey in Kumartuli and submitted a report to the Centre on its development. Kumartuli has a business potential of around Rs 15 crore and Rs 40 lakh in the domestic and foreign markets, respectively.

 ?A few weeks ago, a high-level meeting was held between CMDA officials and representatives from the artisans? hub. 

 Following the meeting, another survey was initiated by the CMDA in Kumartuli. In a fortnight?s time, it will be clear whether the central government has agreed to the proposal of expansion of Kumartuli,? Paul said.

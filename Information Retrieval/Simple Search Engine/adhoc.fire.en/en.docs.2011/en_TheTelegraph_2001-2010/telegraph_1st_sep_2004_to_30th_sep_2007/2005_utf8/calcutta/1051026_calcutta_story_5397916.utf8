 Puja theme-maker

 Definitely not. Gimmicks are the pujas that bank on weird materials, without any connection to art. But theme-based artistic pujas have a hugely positive impact on the festival. In our childhood, the local clubs were the stronghold of goons. The microphone would blare at midnight, but we could not protest. Once we did and our house was ransacked. Now, to stay in the competition for prizes, the clubs have become disciplined. The members are involved in constructive work round the year. All this is because of theme pujas and the competition that they generate. During those five days, the entire city becomes an art gallery. If the right kind of marketing was done, Durga puja would have been bigger than Oktoberfest in Germany.

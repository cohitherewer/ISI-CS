The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Books to bolster English

 - Interactive library will offer courses in language, literature

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come September, Calcutta will have a first of its kind English language centre: Read On. 

 An interactive library with an eclectic mix of books, the centre aims to instil a love for books among all sections of the educated people, hone the skill of reading and offer courses on spoken English and literature.

 Housed at 214, AJC Bose Road, Read On is the brainchild of Ayesha Das, a teacher trainer for the past 35 years and an educationist with a degree from the University of Manchester. With approval from British Council, the library has been modelled on Language Centre in Reading, UK. The inauguration is scheduled for the third week of September.

 ?Communication is the key to success, and reading helps you speak properly and develop confidence and fluency. Read On will provide the right atmosphere, books and activities for developing reading skill in English, which is the international link language,? says Das.

 The library will have provisions for separate ?reading and speaking activities? for both children and adults. The children?s section will have pre-reading books (mainly picture reading books), ?just reading? books (for beginners), bed-time story books and books for those who are ?already reading?.

 The last section will have a varied collection of children?s literature and English Readers, textbooks for classes I to X, from various publishers. These will help teachers select the Reader best suited for their purpose, feels Das.

 ?Speaking activities? for children will introduce those between five and 10 to picture reading books, and also involve them in conversations, debates and panel discussions.

 ?Reading and speaking activities will be inter-linked. Children will be asked to speak on what they have read and read what they have spoken about,? says Das.

 The adult?s section will have ?off-the-shelf? books. Other activities will include panel discussions and open forums on various topics.

 An interesting feature of both the adult and the children?s sections is the ?book club?, where once a month, a book will be discussed by the members.

 Courses on offer will include spoken English, which has been tailored to suit requirements of people from various occupations, such as business executives, professionals, homemakers and blue-collar workers. Besides, there will be students? courses in English literature as a supplement to what is taught in schools and colleges. Das herself will take classes on reading skills. ?Those who will teach here are all highly-skilled and experienced,? she says.

 The membership fees are Rs 300 a year for adults and Rs 200 for children. The members will get a library newsletter every alternate month.

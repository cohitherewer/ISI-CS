 A band of boys from the oldest Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is poised to hit the market with new-age security tools to fortify virtual space.

 Iviz Techno Solutions (ITS), an on-campus initiative of IIT Kharagpur graduates, promises to make ?computing free of all security threats? by devising new technologies to fight the invisible enemies that destroy critical databases of corporations. ?We have prepared a set of tools that can secure Net-space against hacking. We are planning a commercial launch for these products within two months,? said Bikash Barai, head, business development, ITS.

 The M.Tech student ? along with friend Nilanjan De, an IIT graduate majoring in electronics and electrical communication engineering ? is the brain behind the company, which started out as a small initiative from one of the rooms in RK Hall hostel.

 ?Our ideas received the support of the institute?s incubation programme and we got assistance, advice, resources and infrastructure to develop the tools. The company has already been incorporated,? said Barai. The products are now being tested in the IIT laboratories and the team is working on pricing and promotional strategies.

 With the IIT brand backing the company, roping in clients has not been a problem, and the list already includes the likes of Coal India Limited, Neyveli Lignite Corporation, Bengal Ambuja, SREI International and Webel.

 ?We gave them demonstrations of their systems? susceptibility to virus attacks. Our service involves tracing the vulnerability, fixing it and safeguarding the systems against future attacks,? explained Barai, adding that the client list is swelling by the day.

 ITS has set up a full-fledged office on campus with four employees, six consultants and 15 part-time assistants. To scale up the scope of operations, the company is pitching for Rs 8 to Rs 10 crore of venture capital funds. 

 ?The networks security market is big in India. Estimates suggest the market size was $29.9 million (US ) in 2003 and growing fast,? explained Barai.

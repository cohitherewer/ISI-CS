 Michael Madhusudan Dutts celebrated epic-narrative, Meghnadbadh Kabya, though enjoying a position of glorified reverence in Bengali literature, sadly suffers from aloofness, perhaps due to its language, which appears far-removed from regular speech and dialect and, for its unconventional rhyme-scheme. Nandikars stage presentation of the epic marks an effort to break the ice of revered detachment by relating it to our everyday experience. With an innovative approach to dramatisation, the performance is built around fusing individual theatrical elements like narration, dialogue, music, poetry and dance, into a whole. Dance mudras, songs and a familiar conversational tone bring its action to life, at the same time diminishing the seriousness associated with the poem. Evolving a composite style from indigenous dramatic tradition, the play is enacted by a single kathak (storyteller) whose diction and gestures express the power, ardour and agony of Meghnad in his final moments. Direction and acting: Goutam Halder.

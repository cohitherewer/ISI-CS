 Wait too long for litigants

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Case I: Sk Liakat Ali Mondal, a Hooghly farmer, was arrested for murdering his brother. Later, the district judge acquitted him. That was in 1982, when Mondal was 62 years old. The state moved an appeal against the order the same year. On Friday, after 13 years, the appeal came up for hearing before a high court division bench. Presiding judge Justice Aloke Kumar Basu observed that a hearing after so many years was meaningless. ?We don?t even know if Mondal is alive.?

 Case II: Sikandar Bakht and five others were arrested in 1997 on charges of selling drugs. They filed for bail in 1998 before a trial court. After rejection of their plea, they moved Calcutta High Court the same year. While the hearing is still pending, another trial court granted bail to all the accused. Seven years later, when the bail plea came up for hearing, the petitioners had lost interest.

 The high court claims the number of pending cases has reduced remarkably in the past three to four years, but the above are two examples among hundreds of others where the litigants feel it is not worthwhile to continue them. 

 ?The Supreme Court has ruled that the hearing of appeals will have to start in the higher court within three months of filing of the petition. But hundreds of cases are pending in the high court. The hearing of appeals has not started even after two or three years,? said Uttam Majumdar, former High Court Bar Association secretary.

 For aged litigants, there are specific guidelines, that their petitions should be disposed of expeditiously. ?Take the case of the retired government employee who died before delivery of judgment in the suit he had filed against his employer. Hundreds of such cases are pending,? said advocate Supradip Roy, the employee?s lawyer. 

 In 2000, the count of pending cases was 3.1 lakh. In 2004, says a high court report, it was 2.52 lakh. Now, 2.05 lakh cases are pending. Two days a week have been fixed to hear old matters. But many petitioners aren?t interested.

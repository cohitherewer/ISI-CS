The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Morning power snag

 OUR BUREAU

 Large swathes of north and north-west Calcutta experienced widespread power cuts on Wednesday morning after two units each at the CESC?s New Cossipore and Titagarh plants tripped. A mechanical fault was the cause.

 Power utility officers said at 8.30 am a ?bus bar? fault in a 132-KV switchyard at New Cossipore led to a shutdown of two units each at the two power stations, leading to an immediate shortfall of 150 MW.

 ?It was actually what we call a transient fault. Something must have fallen on the switchyard, touched a cable and caused the fault,? an official said.

 Supply to Metro Railway, the airport, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and other residential areas was disrupted.

 At RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, the power cut continued from 8.30 am to 9.10 am. The hospital authorities said since power supply was restored before the outdoor schedules, the department saw little disruption. 

 Some special units, like intensive care and cardiac, where life-support systems and other emergency gadgets are used, experienced some problems. ?But nothing went out of hand,? claimed a hospital officer.

 The residential areas bore the brunt of the power cut, since supply was only restored there around 10.20 am.

 Airport authorities said neither flights nor other activities at the terminal buildings were hampered. Supply was restored at 9 am. The emergency back-up mechanism at the airport was immediately activated after the power cut, so work was not affected.

 Metro Railway officers said there was a power cut from 8.30 am to 8.34 am. ?No disruption in our train services was registered,? a senior Metro officer said.

 ?Power supply was restored to the airport and Metro Railway by 9 am. At RG Kar Hospital, supply was restored at 9.10 am,? a CESC official said. 

 Engineers repaired the fault and normal supply was restored by 10.20 am.

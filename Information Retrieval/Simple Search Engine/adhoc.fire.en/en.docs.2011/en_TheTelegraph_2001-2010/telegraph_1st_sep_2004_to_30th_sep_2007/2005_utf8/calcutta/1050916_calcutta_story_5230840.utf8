The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Brick-and-mortar comes of age 

 - City?s real estate fraternity bags star marks for customer comfort levels 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 We see it all around us. And now, it?s official. The real estate boom in town is on the right track. With strong fundamentals, high reliability, on-schedule delivery and minimal hazards, Calcutta?s brick-and-mortar matrix rates as one of the most evolved in the country.

 This, according to Icra. The country?s premier rating agency feels the city?s real estate industry has undergone a total churn in the past decade to now hold out a comfort level to the buyer hardly matched by other metros.

 ?There are a slew of pluses here that have combined to shore up the collective strength of the real estate industry, and the prime catalyst has been the joint-sector model,? says Devashis Sengupta, manager, Icra Limited.

 Gradings of construction and real-estate entities published by Icra reveal two assessment ?firsts? for the city developers? fraternity.

 Hiland Park Phase II shares the highest published rating till date of ?RT2 plus? with Millennium I of Bangalore for an individual project. And Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Ltd (BAHDL) wears the crown of ?DR1?, the highest grading granted to a real estate developer in the country.

 ?RT2 plus? indicates ?strong project?. The prospects of successful implementation and transfer of ownership as per terms are high. The project risk factors are low. ?DR1? indicates ?very strong project development capacity?. The prospects of development as per plan are best and the ability to transfer ownership as per terms is highest.

 Also in the city, Bengal Shrachi boasts a ?DR2? rating (next only to ?DR1?), Westwind by Keventer Projects ranks ?RT2? and Infinity by Infinity Infotech Parks notches an ?RT2 minus? grading.

 Besides upgrading the general mode of operations among developers, the joint-sector model has also acted as an in-built price regulator, with its cross-subsidy element, feels Sengupta, adding that ?Bengal?s political stability has contributed immensely? to a bullish sector.

 ?The private sector, with its skill set, has acted as the foil to the state government that has played its role of facilitator to perfection,? observes Souvik Mukherjee, also a manager with Icra.

 For grading of real estate developers and projects, Icra has developed the methodology along with the National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), the apex body for developers.

 The Icra rating, feels Harsh Neotia, managing director, Bengal Ambuja Housing, ?reinforces our belief in the procedures we follow?.

 For Sumit Dabriwal, managing director, Calcutta Metropolitan Group, which is developing Hiland Park, going to Icra was an exercise in ?strengthening our internal systems and using it as a learning curve?.

 To ensure the market remains safe, Icra officials warned against ?tinkering too much with the successful joint-sector formula?, and ?choosing the wrong private partner?.

 Cuffs for new year honks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Don?t keep honking your car horn to welcome New Year, police will be out to handcuff you.

 This is just one of the warnings the detective department issued to year-end revellers. And to ensure that the warnings do not just remain on paper, police, or so claims a senior officer, have drawn up the tightest-ever security on Park Street and its neighbourhood.

 The immediate provocation for the security siege, sources say, was the large number of arrests on Christmas night. 

 ?Enjoy and let others enjoy, that?s the message for all,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department. ?Youngsters should not think that security would be like last year?s.?

 An officer said 45 persons were arrested on Sunday night on charges of teasing and passing lewd comments at women. ?Besides, 98 others were picked up from areas adjacent to Park Street and Shakespeare Sarani for disorderly conduct. We do not want a rerun on December 31,? he asserted.

 Sleuths have been asked to keep a close vigil on places where people gather for year-end revelry. 

 ?Every year, we have noticed that youths, mostly from well-to-do families, play music systems in their cars at a loudly and drive recklessly even on a busy thoroughfare. They also keep blowing horns unnecessarily. We are not going to tolerate all this any more. If anyone is caught playing music loudly or honking without any reason, we will prosecute him/her,? deputy commissioner Singh said.

 He claimed the bandobast in the Park Street area on December 31 will be like never before. ?Six teams from the detective department, each comprising nine cops and headed by an officer of the sub-inspector rank, will patrol the zone. We will also be on guard against drunken driving. Anyone we suspect will have to go through a breathalyser test.? 

 As part of preventive measures, cops will start conducting surprise checks on bars from Tuesday. ?People tend to come to bars and restaurants with families and friends during the festive season. They want a decent atmosphere. But there are some who create trouble for others,? said another officer of the department.

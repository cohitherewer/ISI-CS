 Fire razes shanties, kills one

 A STAFF REPORTER

 One person was killed and nearly 100 shanties were razed after a fire broke out at Pagladanga, near the Dhapa dumping ground, on Sunday night.

 Upendra Bhuinya, 45, died on the spot, while Geeta Dalui suffered a heart attack after watching her house being gutted. 

 Eleven fire tenders were pressed into service but the fire could be brought under control only on Monday morning.

 ?The fire broke out in the shanty area around 2 on Sunday night. As the area is littered with broken plastic goods, dry wood and other combustible material, the fire spread immediately. We had to fight hard to keep the flames under control,? said Tapan Bose, a senior official of the fire and emergency department.

 Fire department officials said the blaze might have started from a bonfire.

 ?The residents of the shanties are mostly rag-pickers. It is a common practice among them to light a bonfire to keep themselves warm,? said an official of the department.

 Most of the shanty-dwellers were asleep when the fire broke out. They woke up to find themselves surrounded by flames. 

 Police, along with fire department officials, have started an inquiry to ascertain the cause of the blaze.

 ?We are yet to find a reason to suspect foul play behind the blaze,? said an officer of the Tiljala police station.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta visited the area on Monday morning. 

 He spoke to the shanty-dwellers and later, held discussions with local CPM leaders about their rehabilitation.

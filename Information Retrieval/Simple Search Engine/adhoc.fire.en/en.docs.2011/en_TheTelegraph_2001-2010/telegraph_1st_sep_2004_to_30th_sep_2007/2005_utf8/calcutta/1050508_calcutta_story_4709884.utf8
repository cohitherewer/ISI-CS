Today, the tables are turned and its time for you to pamper your mom for a change. While gift shops and confectioners around town are dishing out goodies galore, heres a jewellery brand that encourages you to say it with diamonds.

 At an event organised by diamond jewellery brand Ishis on Friday night, the effort was to say to mothers that they matter in our lives. 

 Five moms, or super moms as they were referred to, turned up at The Conclave to share their moments of joy as mothers and speak about their relationships with their children. Singers Usha Uthup and Pramita Mullick, actor June and dancers Tanusree Shankar and Sharmila portrayed the meaning of motherhood through anecdotes and performances.

 ?I fight a lot with my daughter but she still insists on sitting on my lap,? shared Tanusree, about her 24-year-old who lives in Mumbai. All five, from grandmom Usha to young mother June, agreed that they fight easy and get back easier with their kids.

 The performances included poems by June and Tanusree, a dance sequence by Sharmila and a Rabindrasangeet rendition by Pramita. 

 Usha, however, stole the show with a spirited performance, as she sang Diamonds are forever and Bindiya chamkegi with equal elan.

 If you want be in total control of the console and make people dance to your tunes, your success might be just a click of a mouse away.

 Abhishake, the resident DJ of Clown Town, has launched a website called www.djabhi.com, aimed at guiding wannabe disc jockeys.

 ?My website will teach every aspect of disc jockeying. Youngsters who cough up huge sums and enroll themselves in DJ training schools can now log on to this site,? says DJ Abhishake. 

 According to the table turner, none of the schools impart training in making original remixes. ?My site will teach the technicalities that the schools never concentrate on. The students will also learn to operate the console and churn out their own remixes,? says the DJ. 

 The site also enables one to remix ad jingles. ?People can download my remixes from the site for parties at home,? he adds.

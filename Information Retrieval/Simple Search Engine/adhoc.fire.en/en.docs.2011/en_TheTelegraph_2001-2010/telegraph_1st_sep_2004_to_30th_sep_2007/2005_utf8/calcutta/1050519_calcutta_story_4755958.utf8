The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's your birthday, so... 

 Feelings rarely cloud your judgment. In matters of love, you hate a dull routine. You rebel against emotional restrictions of any sort. At work, you have good self-control and hate wasting time. You are very professional and don?t like any emotional interactions with your co-workers. You rarely ask for help unless absolutely necessary. ? Kusum Bhandari

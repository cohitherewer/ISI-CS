 Just before he embarks on yet another Team India tour, it was the turn of Team Sourav on Friday to celebrate the skippers 10,000 runs in One-Day Internationals, a milestone he reached on Sri Lankan soil earlier this month.

 Sourav Gangulys boys at Souravs: The Food Pavilion hosted him for a good hour and a half at his Park Street restaurant to celebrate the feat. Stopping over around 1 pm en route to Eden Gardens, Sourav got off the mark at One Day, the coffee shop, where he cut the ceremonial cake.

 Dada then hit top gear at Over Boundary, the multi-cuisine restaurant, digging into his favourite Mutton Biryani and Adrak ke Panje.

 I always try to put in more than hundred percent in whatever I do. As a result, the feat of 10,000 runs could be achieved. Similarly, I want Souravs: The Food Pavilion to be the best entertainment destination in the city which is only possible if all of you work as a unit, were the words of encouragement from the captain.

 The best thing about him is that whenever he comes here he goes out of his way to interact with everybody. Whenever he is around, there is no place for hierarchy, said Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO, Souravs.

 Craft call

 From handloom fabrics, traditional home decor to ethnic ornaments, this is one address that has held its own in the ever-changing world of ethnic fashion. A precious case in point: the jewellery exhibition being held at the Central Cottage Industries Corporation, on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, till August 25.

 The exhibition showcases accessories from all over the country ? bangles, earrings, toe-rings, maang tikas, anklets, key chains? Cottage has always had a brand name and now it has a following among all ages and classes. The exclusive jewellery range speaks volumes of the potential of our rural craftsmen, says M.K. Sengupta, branch in-charge.

 so available are accessories in semi-precious stones like sandstone, amethyst, cornelian, onyx, garnets and moonstone that go with traditional as well as western wear.

 Exhibitions like this are a platform for the master craftsmen to popularise their craftsmanship, says a spokesperson for the store.

 For those with an eye for authentic jewellery, there is chunky silver jewellery from Rajasthan. The mangalsutras and pendants embellished with embossed designs from the south are worth a look, too. 

 Oxidised silver jewellery from Maharashtra, designer lace pieces from Jaipur and Delhi, jute pieces from Bengal and colourful kundans from Rajasthan are also on offer.

 Tradition talk

 With locker jewellery being an absolute no-no for todays fashion brigade, Diagold unfurled Jadau Lights at its Lee Road showroom on August 17. 

 Though the inspiration behind the collection is the traditional jadau form that originated in north-west India, the jewellery has been designed keeping in mind the needs of todays woman, says owner Varda Goenka. 

 The collection includes everything from earrings, neckpieces, rings to complete sets and is an assortment in precious and semi-precious stones. 

 With films like Parineeta and Paheli, heavy jewellery is in vogue again. We have kept this in mind while designing our collection, which has an antique look, adds Varda. 

 The collection will be exhibited at the Lee Road and City Centre outlets from August 20 to August 25 and August 26 to August 28 respectively. The earrings start at around Rs 5,000, the neckpieces at Rs 6,000 and the whole sets at Rs 10,000.

 Sari style

 Revel in the splendour of sartorial grace at Sreemayee, an exhibition being held on Sarat Banerjee Road till August 21. The colour schemes are sober and I have made it a point not to repeat any of the designs, says designer Nandita Sinha. 

 The collection is an assortment of cottons, tussar and silks in prints, intricate kantha stich and Gujarati work. Adorned with bright patterns in gold, blue, green and red, there are saris to match all occasions. The saris are priced between Rs 345 and Rs 4,000.

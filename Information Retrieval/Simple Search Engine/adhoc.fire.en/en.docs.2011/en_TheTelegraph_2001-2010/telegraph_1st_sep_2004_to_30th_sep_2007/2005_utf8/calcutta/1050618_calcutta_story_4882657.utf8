 Eye-to-eye heralds thaw on campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The deadlock at Jadavpur University (JU) shows signs of resolution, with the campus authorities and the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) expressing satisfaction with the progress of the talks they held.

 The discussions were held at a meeting between a Fetsu delegation and the five-member team set up by JU early this week, on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s directive to find a solution to the stalemate on the campus over the past two months. 

 Though the five-member inquiry team and the students failed to come to an agreement during their three-hour-long discussions, Fetsu leaders and team members expressed their satisfaction with Friday?s developments. 

 ?Today?s discussions were very positive. We have been able to settle a number of differences in opinion. We hope to evolve a solution to the crisis very soon,? Manoj Mitra, dean, engineering and technology faculty and chairman of the five-member committee, said after the meeting.

 The second round of meetings between Fetsu and the committee will be held on Monday evening.

 It is learnt that the report of a one-man committee set up by the state government to probe the police crackdown on fasting students on June 10 is also ready. ?The director-general of police is out of station. He will submit the report as soon as he returns,? the chief minister said at Writers? Buildings on Friday. 

 Sources close to the five-member inquiry team, however, said all possible means of resolving the deadlock were discussed during the meeting, though initially both the students and the team members refused to make any concessions. The students stuck to their stand that they would continue to agitate unless the authorities unconditionally withdrew the suspension order on the five students. 

 The authorities, too, declared that the punishment would be withdrawn only if the students apologised.

 ?We did not agree on many points. Yet, the talks were very positive,? said Parag Banerjee, Fetsu assistant secretary.

 Supporters of the Youth Revolutionary Association and All-India Students Association held a snap demonstration in front of the main gate of Writers? Buildings at 3 pm to protest police action at JU. Twelve persons were arrested.

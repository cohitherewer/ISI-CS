 With its first retail outlet scheduled to open at Sudder Street on July 31, Roop Shringar Sarees showcased its traditional Indian outfits at the Jamuna banquets on Thursday evening.

 Tollywood actresses June, Chandreyee and Swastika joined Tanusree, Devdutta Ishika, Aritri and a host of other models to sashay down the ramp in salwar suits, saris and bridal gear.

 The fashion show opened with a collection of salwar kameezes in bright hues peppered with a medley of prints and embroideries. The collection of saris was extensive, embellished with kundan, sequins, baadla and dabka. Georgettes in floral Parsi motifs made bright splashes. 

 Sensuous crepes shimmering with Swarovski crystals and embroidery promise to create plenty of sparkles at parties.

 The silks come in an exclusive range of handprints. Georgette and crepe in myriad tones drew inspiration from the 60s. Also on display were saris in white glittering with sequins, kundan, crystals and zardosi.

 The star attraction of the evening was the impressive bridal collection of lehngas and saris in electric combinations like pink and blue, yellow and orange, and traditional reds and pinks.

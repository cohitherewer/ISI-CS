 If it?s cancer, the patient must be told

 A STAFF REPORTER

 THE RULE: The doctor will discuss a disease only with the patient.

 THE REALITY: In case of cancer, doctors discuss the disease with everyone but the patient.

 THE RESULT: Poor response to treatment, financial loss.

 ?In 80 per cent of cases, the patient is not told he has cancer, though medical ethics say otherwise. The practice does not help the patient fight the disease,? according to oncologist Subir Gangopadhyay.

 Around 60,000 new cases of cancer are reported every year in Calcutta and around 20,000 deaths are caused by it in the city and its adjoining areas.

 Gangopadhyay, president of Oncolink, an organisation of experts dealing exclusively with cancer, elaborated: ?In most cases, the family members of a patient request the doctor not to divulge the disease to him. This not only creates a suffocating tension in the patient, but hampers treatment. We have come across several instances of a patient responding to treatment better after being told the truth.?

 ENT specialist Santanu Bandopadhyay cited an example. A 22-year-old girl was diagnosed with blood cancer. Her family asked the doctor not to tell her about the disease and the doctor agreed. The girl had beautiful head of hair but after the first chemotherapy, she lost most of it.

 Seeing her reflection in the mirror, she flew into a rage and even partly lost her sanity over the next few days. 

 When the doctor came to see her, she abused him and threw at him whatever she could lay her hands on.

 Bandopadhyay argued that the patient has a premonition of the disease almost from the onset. A confirmation from the doctor may be a shock at first, but in the long run, it prepares him to fight the disease and respond to treatment more effectively.

 There is another ?ugly face to this unnecessary secrecy?, said Gangopadhyay. 

 Taking advantage of the patient?s ignorance about the disease, his family members and some doctors at times mislead him about treatment and make a killing, Gangopadhyay said. 

 ?We know about several patients who have been cheated by nursing homes or doctors or family members just because they don?t know details of his disease and treatment options,? he added.

 Oncolink organised on Sunday a seminar on ?The Right of a Cancer Patient to Know the Information of His Disease?. Experts who took part in the discussion agreed that patients needs to know the truth for their own sake.

 Keeping the patient in the dark means denying him his right to know about the disease he is suffering from, opined oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay. 

 ??Anyway, you can?t hide things from him forever. Hanging between suspicion and confirmation, he suffers pain much more intense than what cancer causes,? he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Style spice new amp; nice 

 MIDNIGHT Manners

 The buzz at the dressing table 

 prior to stepping out for a clubbing spree is filled with 

 indecision about what to wear, what make-up to apply, which 

 pair of earrings look better or simply whether straight 

 hair or soft curls look better. But all the effort could 

 go waste if the only attention you get is from a bunch of 

 sleazy men falling over each other to buy you a drink. So, 

 hope for the best but be prepared for the worst when you 

 step out into the night. Goodlife tells you how.

 What not to wear

 Seasonal spin: While braving the summer heat, 

 sporting a faux fur coat, no matter how stylishly cut 

 or whose designer label might be tucked at the back, will 

 make you look like a fool. However, there?s no need to 

 take that 180-degree turn and sport nothing at all. So, 

 go easy to beat the heat.

 Size matters: Mini skirts might look great on 

 long-legged lasses, but if you know the poor state of 

 crowd control in most nightclubs and you don?t have a 

 muscular set of bodyguards, it?s best to keep them tucked 

 away in your closet. But if you do chance upon a knight 

 in shining armour prior to your evening out, short skirts 

 aren?t such a bad option. Use some common sense and make 

 sure to toe the line between short and vulgar, though. 

 Also, be wary of showing too much cleavage ? top or bottom.

 Male mockery: Women have always led in terms of 

 fashion and style, and men are proving this by the minute, 

 ensuring that all trends remain unisex. Unflattering as 

 it may look, men have decided to sport straightened hair, 

 tight-fitting shirts (sometimes, with frills!). What?s 

 more, coloured hair and capris are becoming their birthright, 

 too. And while baring the body is without question the 

 way to be at private bashes, doing the half-monty at nightclubs 

 after a couple of drinks is a definite no-no. 

 What to wear

 Skirting style: The skirt is the talk of the town 

 right now, with fashion gurus lauding its creation. To 

 be stylish, it?s best to get stocked up with some chic 

 cuts, metres of flowing fabric and paisley prints. And 

 the longer the better is the fashion funda.

 Desi diktat: The ethnic edge has reached 

 a global platform with sari, kurta, kurti 

 and ghagroo a rage. So, wear your attitude with 

 some desi masala and watch heads turn.

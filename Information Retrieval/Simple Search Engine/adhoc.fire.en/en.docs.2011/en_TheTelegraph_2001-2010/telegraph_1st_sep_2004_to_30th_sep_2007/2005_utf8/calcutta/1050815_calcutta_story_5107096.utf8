 Boating across tranquil waterbodies, catching your favourite flick at the in-house amphitheatre, sweating it out in the health club or sipping your preferred brew at the coffee lounge with family and friends?

 There?s a lot one can do at Genexx Valley, the 2,050-apartment residential complex coming up in Joka, the maiden foray into real estate development by Paharpur Cooling Towers Ltd, which promises to become the ?Maruti 800 of housing? creating a whole new class of home-owners.

 ?We want to make large-format ?lifestyle? housing affordable for the middle-income segment, and so our price is just Rs 995 (per sq ft), almost half that of the city?s premium projects,? declares Paharpur Cooling Towers managing director Gaurav Swarup.

 Just as the Maruti 800 was India?s first entry-level modern vehicle that shook up the country?s car canvas, Genexx Valley will change the metro?s mortar matrix, with its ?value for money? credo, the bosses of the Rs 400-crore turnover corporate house pledge.

 ?While the features might be plain vanilla, we are reaching out to the masses, offering them a product to match their aspirations as well as pocket. We also bring to the table the Paharpur professionalism and goodwill, besides speed of construction,? says Swarup. 

 With a price band of eight to 13 lakh (introductory rates), the EMI works out to around Rs 5,000, he adds.

 The mammoth housing estate coming up on a 21-acre plot opposite Joka tram depot, the largest single-shot project in town till date, is spread across 34 towers, going up from G+4 to G+14 floors. From a four-km jogging track to four state-of-the-art banquet halls, library and creche, a large playground to club with swimming pool, 14-m driveway and basketball courts, it?s a mini-township to be ready at one go in three years.

 ?The location is interesting, because after the IIM campus, the urban setting starts giving way to the rural, a perfect stage for my life-long dream to create a mini garden town,? observes architect Dulal Mukherjee, who has designed the project. ?The creative challenge is that it has to be contemporary, without compromising technical perfection within a tight budget and sustainability parameters.?

 The architect and the developers have decided to retain all the ?original beautiful buildings on the plot designed by German architects, which possess a timeless simplicity?. 

 Says Mukherjee: ?We could always convert the buildings into a clubhouse or something else to suit any other relevant purpose. This is not just a huge expanse of land, but one with a strong ecological character, begging to be used sensitively.?

 Swarup feels with Diamond Harbour Road being declared National Highway 117, the entire stretch has become a happening corridor. ?Joka is also set to be a terminus in the LRT system the government is planning to ease traffic chaos in the city, which will further boost the location edge of Genxx Valley,? he points out.

 The cooling towers major foraying into real estate, with probably one of the biggest investments in the sector by a corporate firm in the state, also promises to bring in a ?fundamentally different set of value systems and a corporate approach? to the industry.

 ?We realise our core strengths are project management and execution and we want to leverage those by delivering a no-nonsense, down-to-earth product. There won?t be any gold-plating, but residents will have access to children?s parks and yoga clinics, a place of worship and a marketplace for conveniences,? Swarup stresses.

 The housing estate will be flanked by a 300,000-sq-ft mall with a multiplex and allied entertainment, which can be accessed from the main road. ?The retail and entertainment zone will come up on an adjacent plot of land being acquired separately,? says Jitendra Khaitan of Pioneer Properties, the marketing agency for Genexx Valley.

 ?If customers are happy with our first product (in real estate), we can replicate the model many times over,? the MD declares.

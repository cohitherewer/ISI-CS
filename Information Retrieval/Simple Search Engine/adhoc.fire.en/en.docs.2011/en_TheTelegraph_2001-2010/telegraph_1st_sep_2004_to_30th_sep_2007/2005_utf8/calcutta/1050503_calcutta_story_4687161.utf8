 A double wedding turned into a double tragedy on Monday morning, when four-year-old Nusrat Parveen and Md Afzal, 34, were killed by a speeding truck near Park Circus.

 The Hussain nuptials became a nightmare when the driver of the truck lost control and rammed into a car waiting to carry home one of the newly-wed couples.

 The truck also hit the car of another guest, 42-year-old Jumela Khatun, leaving her seriously injured. Till Monday evening, doctors treating her at a nursing home said her condition was not stable.

 The accident occurred around 2.15 am on Monday outside Haj House, on Dilkhusa Street opposite the South East Traffic Guard office. 

 While Sk Akbar Hussain?s family was reeling in shock, angry local residents arrived, pelting stones at the killer vehicle, though the driver had managed to flee.

 The function was almost over when tragedy struck, explained the caretaker of Haj House. One of the newly-wed couples ? Shadmani and Sarfaraz ? had left along with most of the invitees and preparations were on to see off the second couple.

 ?Since it was a joint party, it carried on till quite late. The baraat was outside. Suddenly, we saw the truck rushing round the bend,? recalled Abdul Salan of Haj House.

 Some of the guests standing on the road managed to jump on to the footpath in time. But Md Afzal fell on the road and was crushed by the vehicle.

 The truck then rammed into the Tata Indica waiting to carry away newly-weds Fauzia and Mehboob, who were seated inside. The collision sent the car hurtling a few yards away and leaving the windows shattered.

 ?Nusrat was standing between the two cars while Saddam, her friend, was already seated inside. As the car jolted, it crushed the girl,? lamented Akbar Hussain, the father of the two brides. The young girl had come from Nawada, in Bihar, to attend the wedding.

 Even before reaching the wedding venue, the lorry had been involved in another accident. ?Minutes before dashing against the car, the truck had hit a vehicle on the western slope of Bridge No. 4. It seemed something was seriously wrong with the driver,? said Bhubaneswar Paswan, a witness.

 As word spread about the deaths, the mob set the truck on fire. Local residents also refused to hand over the bodies for post-mortem when a team from the local Karaya police station arrived.

 Outnumbered, officers called the Lalbazar Control Room for back-up. Neighbouring police stations were asked to pitch in with reinforcements.

 With the mood remaining volatile, security outside the residences of senior police officers ? just around the corner of the accident spot ? was intensified and additional policemen from the headquarters were rushed in to control the situation.

 ?It took us over an hour to pacify the crowd and finally bring the situation under control,? explained an officer of Karaya police station.

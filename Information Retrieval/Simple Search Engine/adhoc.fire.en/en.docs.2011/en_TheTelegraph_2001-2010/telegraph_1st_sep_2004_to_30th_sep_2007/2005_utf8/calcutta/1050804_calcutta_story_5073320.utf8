The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

 You couldn?t miss the irony. C.R. Irani?s picture on the front page of this newspaper. The birth of The Telegraph in the early 1980s, Calcuttans believe, was the beginning of the end of Irani?s baby, The Statesman. Let?s leave corporate rivalry aside and share a delightful lesser-known-fact about the man ? he had a legendary collection of pens. I?ve never seen anyone carry so many pens in his top pocket. More power to the pen. R.I.P. Mister I.

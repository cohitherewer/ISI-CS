 Parents in search cry 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Months after 22-year-old Chitrasen Bhattacharya went missing from his Salt Lake house, his parents have approached the state human rights commission, seeking ?proper action? by police.

 Chitrasen, a second-year student at Bidhannagar College, went missing on the night of April 21 from his CC block home. 

 ?Police have done nothing significant to trace my son,? complained Malay Bhattacharya, who works in the posts and telegraph department.

 Mother Krishna is suffering from depression. ?She was on the verge of a breakdown,? said Bhattacharya. 

 ?Talking to various officers, I gather the police believe that my son had left home to become a sanyasi. Their belief is reinforced by the fact that Chitrasen had spiritual inclinations. Had it been a case of abduction, officers said, we would surely have heard about him by now,? Bhattacharya added. 

 ?The boy went missing two days before a religious ceremony in Pondicherry. I had advised his parents to go there and look for him,? said Rajiv Kumar, deputy inspector-general (CID).

 A CID team went to Pondicherry with Chitrasen?s photograph, but could not trace him. ?All leads are being pursued, but it will be difficult to find him if he wants to stay away,? Kumar added.

 The parents themselves had visited Pondicherry and stayed there for a fortnight. They also searched for Chitrasen in other parts of South India, but in vain.

 They said they had written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and met officials in his department at Writers? Buildings.

 According to the parents, Chitrasen mostly kept to himself and was serious about his studies. A few days before he went missing, he was upset over preparations for his exams. 

 He last left home at 7 pm on April 21, telling his parents he was going out to take a stroll.

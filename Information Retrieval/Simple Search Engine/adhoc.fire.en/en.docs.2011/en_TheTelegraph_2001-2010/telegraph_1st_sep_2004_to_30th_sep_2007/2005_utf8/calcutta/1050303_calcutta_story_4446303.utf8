 A day after a large part of the ceiling over the VIP staircase of Writers? Buildings came crashing down, the state government on Wednesday ordered a thorough survey of the entire structure. 

 ?There is no denying the fact that the situation is alarming and we have taken serious note of it,? said public works department minister Amar Choudhury. 

 He admitted that Tuesday?s incident could have been fatal. ?It has reminded us that the building is 250 years old and must be thoroughly checked now to avert any similar or more serious mishap,? the minister added.

 Several portions of the building, completed in 1776, were constructed as add-ons at different times. 

 The last major repairs were undertaken in 1997-98.

 The minister formed a six-member committee, which will look into all aspects of the building, and submit a detailed report to him by May 30. 

 The committee, headed by the departmental chief engineer, comprises a chief engineer (quality assurance), a senior architect, superintending engineer (design and planning), senior chief electrical engineer and an additional chief electrical engineer.

 ?The panel, comprising persons with technical expertise, will be able to tell us how precarious the building is, what preventive measures must be taken and how much funds will be required for the renovation,? the minister said.

 Tuesday?s incident seems to have occurred because of seepage of water through the ceiling tiles, causing both the tiles and a supporting wooden beam to come loose. 

 ?I was not at Writers? Buildings then. Someone informed me over phone about the incident,? Choudhury said.

 The tiles, a senior PWD engineer explained, are made of clay. The ceiling is two clay tiles? deep, each tile of one-inch thickness. On the top is a layer of lime concrete. The thickness of the ceiling is around 10 inches. 

 The tiles are supported by small wooden or iron beams, which are, in turn, held in place by bigger beams. 

 ?Once the entire building is surveyed and the situation comes to light, we shall be able to say whether any portion of the ceiling needs to be replaced,? an engineer said.

 ?But one thing is certain. The repair process will have to be different, as clay tiles or the earlier system of making lime concrete are no longer used. Any repair must be in concrete,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Late unit ready to roll

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After a nine-month delay due to bureaucratic hurdles, a sewerage treatment plant will be commissioned at Mahestala on September 14. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya will inaugurate the plant, built by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) using central funds.

 The plant was completed last November, but remained mired in red tape, forcing residents of the area to wade through waterlogged streets for one more monsoon.

 Pranabandhu Nag, general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee, said: ?The bureaucrats prevented the commissioning of the plant even though it was completed last year. We are glad that things have moved at last.?

 Chief executive officer, CMDA, P.R. Baviskar, stated: ?Only a section of the residents could reap the benefits after a part of the plant was made operational. Once the entire project gets off the ground, a much larger body of people will stand to gain.? 

 As per estimates, nearly 500,000 people living on the southern fringes of Calcutta, will be the direct beneficiaries of the project. Drains in Mahestala are almost regularly clogged by refuse. Even a smart shower is enough to waterlog the area.

 A pumping station has been set up and made functional in Mahestala, but it only caters to the adjoining areas.

 Ali Azmat: In a social circus

 His junoon for music saw him excel as the lead singer of one of Pakistan?s most popular bands of all time. And now Ali Azmat is ready with his solo offering that promises to set music charts on fire. Social Circus, according to Azmat, is full of double meanings and contradictions. But the songs are good enough for Channel [V] to turn the Spotlight on the stylish singing star all this month.

 Apart from the new videos from his album, you can get to see Ali speak on his music and his journey to stardom. In candid interviews, he talks about how he became an integral member of the Pakistani rock band Junoon and how the band made waves with their single Saiyonee. He also speaks on how he wants to change the very sound of the music as he embarks upon his solo musical career.

 So, catch the singer on [V] Spotlight Special on Friday at 10 pm and if you miss, the repeat telecast is on Monday at 6 pm.

 Ishaa Koppikar: Judging away

 After the likes of Dia Mirza and Alka Yagnik, it?s time for Ishaa Koppikar to enter the Fame Gurukul jury. The all-important Friday episode (Kaun Banega Crorepati returns on the airwaves that evening) has the Khallas girl sitting on the judges chair and helping the jury and faculty decide on whom to eliminate.

 Continuing their strategy of cross-promotion, Sony Entertainment Television has also got the Fame Gurukul contestants to compose a special song for Jassi?s wedding, which again is being telecast on Friday at 9.30 pm. In fact, the contestants have been split into two groups, each one of which will compose a special number for the occasion and the Fame Gurukul faculty will decide which tune is better.

 While too much has been talked and written about Sony?s deliberate pitching of Jassi?s marriage against Bachchan?s comeback on the small screen, Sony has been playing it cool. ?Loyal viewers of Jassi... will continue to watch the show even on Friday,? is the view from the channel.

 Will it work against the Big B and his big show? Just wait for the fantastic Friday.

 The biggest talk show host of all time meets the cast of the biggest television sensation in the world. Oprah Winfrey?s visit to Wisteria Lane is sure to spice up Desperate Housewives, this Sunday on STAR World at 8.30 pm.

 Creator Marc Cherry wrote a part especially for Oprah, who plays the newest housewife on the block who runs away from Wisteria Lane as she uncovers all her neighbours? steamy secrets. In fact, Oprah also filmed a special short episode of the award-winning series for a 10-minute slot on her show.

 ?I loved being a part of the Desperate Housewives... I?ve got the acting bug again,? Oprah said about her acting stint that came after an eight-year hiatus.

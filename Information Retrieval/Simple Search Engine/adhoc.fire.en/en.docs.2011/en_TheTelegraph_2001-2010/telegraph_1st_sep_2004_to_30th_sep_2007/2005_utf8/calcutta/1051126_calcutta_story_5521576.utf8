 What: The after-premiere party of Ek Mutho Chhobi hosted by actress Roopa Ganguly.

 Where: At Fusion, the resto-bar at Golden Park. 

 When: The party started at 9 pm on Wednesday and continued till 1 am.

 Producerspeak: The movie consists of six short films of 20 minutes duration each. The subjects revolve around vices like anger, aggression and greed. The idea originated on the premises of Nandan during an adda session. Bengali films have become too predictable. Ek Mutho Chhobi is an effort to breathe some life into Bengali cinema, said Roopa, about the six-in-one film experiment also starring Supriya Chowdhury, June, Sreelekha, Arunima, Biplab and Bikram. 

 Also spotted: Arunima Ghosh, Arindam Sil, Churni Ganguly, Parambrata Chatterjee and Sabyasachi Chakraborty.

 Floor facts: The dance floor was the centre of all activity. When it comes to shaking a leg or two, even the Tollywood brigade prefers a strictly-Bollywood fare. So, the stars jigged to the usual Bin tere sanam, Woh lamhey, Kajra re, Ada, Ishq hai jhoota and the works. 

 Sip and bite: Wine flowed freely, accompanying Fish Finger, Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Chicken Tikka Kebab. Dinner consisted of Chinese and Mongolian delicacies.

 Club couture

 What: Wednesday Fashion Nite, featuring designer Pritam Pandas club wear collection

 Where: Big Ben, the pub at The Kenilworth.

 When: On Wednesday, from 10.30 pm. The show went on till 11:45 pm, breaking occasionally for some music and masti. 

 Designerspeak: While the ethnics are specially created for the winter, the Western line was actually a glimpse of my spring-summer 2006 line. Anyway, people in Calcutta dont really have a separate party wardrobe for the winters, says Pritam.

 On show: The designer showcased five collections on the ramp, starting off with saris and moving on to westerns. Most of the designs were in solid colours with tone-on-tone embroidery. Interesting corsets and bikini tops added to the glam element. The silhouettes were free-flowing and romantic, with lots of girlie ruffled edges and bias cuts. Most of my embellishments are in the form of semi-precious stones, Swarovski, rubies, corals and diamantes, added Pritam. The colour story revolved around black, beige and red, with an occasional dash of sky blue. 

 The catwalkers: Jessica, Pooja, Ishika, Dimpy and Arjita.

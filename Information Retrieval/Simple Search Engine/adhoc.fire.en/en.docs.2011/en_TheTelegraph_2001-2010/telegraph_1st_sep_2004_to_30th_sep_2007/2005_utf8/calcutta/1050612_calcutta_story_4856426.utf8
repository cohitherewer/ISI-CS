 She was the girl next door whose life changed overnight after winning Channel [V]s Get Gorgeous title last year. Since then, Alipores Archana Vijaya has loved every moment of her roller-coaster ride.

 Its been a Cinderella journey so far, says the 22-year old, in the city on Saturday to host the Attitude Weekend at Tantra. Last year around this time, Archana was a final-year student of English literature at Bhawanipur College. It was the inaugural year of the contest, which aims at transforming the girl next door into the supermodel of tomorrow.

 My friends coaxed me to audition for Get Gorgeous, Archana offers. It was a little strange because I hadnt worn heels or make-up till then. It was all the more shocking for her, therefore, when she was chosen the winner.

 Can you imagine my first ramp show was at the Rome Fashion Week? Archana exclaims. I shared space with the likes of Sheetal Malhar, Fleur Xavier, Tupur Chatterjee? the whos who of the industry, and was showcasing designs by the best of the lot.

 Archana was the host for this years Get Gorgeous and it was a nostalgic trip for her, reliving the moments of agony and ecstasy through the contestants. Now that the contest has come to a close, I feel a little sad.

 The model turned VJ in October 2004 for Channel [V]. But that had nothing to do with my winning Get Gorgeous. I had to apply just like the others, Archana insists. She now hosts shows like Heroes, Spotlight and loves to get paid to talk.

 Known to be a party animal while she was in Calcutta, Archana has cut down just a little on night-outs for the sake of work. I dont party the night before a shoot, because if youre tired, no matter how much make-up you wear, it always shows. Even then, she has a few favourite hangouts in Mumbai ? where she shifted base ? like Squeeze. And in her hometown, its good ol Tantra. Its been there for ages and is still a great place, Archana says.

 Next up: enjoying the modelling career as much as possible. A recent commercial shoot with Amitabh Bachchan left her awe-struck. He asked me whether I had watched Black and when I said no he explained why I should immediately. Would she join movies? Maybe sometime in future, but not right now. 

 For Archana Vijaya, its a long way to midnight for her Cinderella journey to end.

 Going green

 If dolled-up actresses and busy production guys are images you associate with a green room, Starstruck Retro Lounge will force you to do a rethink. Relaxed clubbers, celebrity DJs and flowing beer fill up the Heineken Green Room that was launched on Friday at the Forum lounge.

 The first evening of the monthly series came alive with the sounds of DJ Chris from Mumbai, playing progressive house for the mature listener and laid-back Friday brigade.

 Its not a huge event, but a cosy evening for clubbers with some different music and chilled beer, explains club manager Probhasish Chatterjee.

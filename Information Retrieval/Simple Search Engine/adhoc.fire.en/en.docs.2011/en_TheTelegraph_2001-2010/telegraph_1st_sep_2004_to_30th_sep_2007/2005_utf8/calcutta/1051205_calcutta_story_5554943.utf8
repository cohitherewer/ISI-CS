 A student of Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan, during the years preceding Independence, Bhutnath Pal received his tutelage in the fine arts under the guidance of legendary personalities like Nandalal Bose, Abanindranath Tagore, Binode Behari Mukhopadhyay and Ramkinkar Baij, among others. Reflecting the influence of the Bengal school in his earlier works, his paintings over the last five decades have borne the impression of his own creative experiments. Having evolved a distinctive style, Pal?s paintings are pure expressions of his love for nature. An element of realism pervades his scenes of the verdant Bengal countryside, investing them with familiarity, yet retaining the aura of ideal beauty. Landscapes of Birbhum and its folk art and culture, always a predominant subject with Pal, can be viewed at their best at the ongoing exhibition of his works.

 Event: Paintings by Bhutnath Pal 

When: Till December 10, 3 pm - 8 pm

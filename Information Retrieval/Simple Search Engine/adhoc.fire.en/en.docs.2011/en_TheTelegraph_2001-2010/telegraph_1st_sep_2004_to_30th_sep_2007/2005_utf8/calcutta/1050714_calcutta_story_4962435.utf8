The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scorched greens hit price high

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Summer might well be behind us, but the prices of green vegetables have skyrocketed in its aftermath.

 Green chillies, for example, are being sold at Rs 100 a kg in city markets. Prices of other vegetables have also gone up by Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg over the past fortnight.

 ?Green vegetables were scorched in the heat wave across Bengal during the summer. As a result, their availability in the city markets has decreased, pushing up their prices,? said Anwar Ali, a wholesale dealer of green vegetables at the Baithakkhana market.

 To pre-empt a negative reaction from customers, some small and medium retailers have stopped selling vegetables coming with a high price tag. As a result, several popular varieties have vanished from the markets in Gariahat, Maniktala and College Street.

 Prices of vegetables like brinjal and carrot have risen beyond the reach of the middle class. Even the dealers are facing discomfiture because of the prices.

 ?There has been a huge price hike. We are feeling embarrassed to tell the prices to the consumers. But what can we do? We are being forced to buy vegetables at higher prices from the wholesale dealers. Consequently, we can?t help quoting high prices to the consumers,? said Aloke Das, a retailer at Sealdah market. 

 Eggplant, or brinjal, is being sold in the city between Rs 20 and Rs 22 a kg, while parwal, or striped gourd, is costing about Rs 20 a kg. 

 Various leafy vegetables have vanished from the markets across the city due to their abnormally high prices.

 According to reports, a section of traders is taking advantage of the relatively low supply and hiking up prices further. 

 ?The unavailability of some green vegetables has enabled some traders to make a killing. For example, the green chilli available in the Calcutta markets is sourced from Berachampa and Tarakeswar. Farmers in these areas suffered heavy losses as the crops were burnt by the scorching sun during summer. As a result, supply from the two areas has reduced considerably.

 ?Businessmen are cashing in on the situation by bringing in chilli from neighbouring Bangladesh and selling it at inordinately high prices,? explained Anwar Hussein, a chilli wholesaler in Burrabazar.

 In the absence of an alternative, consumers are being forced to buy green vegetables at high prices.

 ?I?ve been buying vegetables from the Gariahat market for the past 15 years. I?ve never seen prices shoot up at such speed. Prices of almost all vegetables have increased by 20 to 30 per cent over the past 10 to 15 days. The situation has become alarming,? complained Sushmita Banerjee, while buying 200 g of green chilli at Rs 20.

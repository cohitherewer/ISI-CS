 What: Performance by Them Clones, a band created in July 2000.

 Where: At Someplace Else.

 When: Friday night.

 Bandspeak: Its great to play to an educated crowd. Its actually energising and educational. Sometimes the crowd reactions teach you a great deal about the performance. And Someplace Else is famous for its live-band lovers, said Surojit Dev of Them Clones, a band young, original and raring to go. With a mutual love for music, we have all the right ingredients to make the crowd swoon, claimed Dev.

 Crowd reaction: The young spitfire band had the crowd rocking to its tracks at the Park Street address made famous by gigs of bands old and new.

 Them Clones boasts quite a few performances across the country, including high-profile concerts like MTV Campus Idols, Channel [V] Launch Pad, The Battle against AIDS Concert, Levis Great Indian Rock Concert.

 But the band was quite overwhelmed by the quality of music lovers in Calcutta, as the pub crowd rocked to tracks like Wait For Me, Black, White and Grey and Awaken.

 Them Clones consists of Prithwish Dev (vocals/keyboards), Joseph L (guitars), Gucci Singh (guitars), Romit Gupta (bass) and Surojit Dev (drums).

 Theatre to films, it?s a splash all along

 Bad guys to doting dads, they have played it all, as did Amrish Puri. And like Mogambo, they all had started out on stage before taking the big screen by storm. Metro takes stock of four men who stole the thunder from many stars after crossing over to films from theatre.

 Naseeruddin Shah

 Armed with a degree from the National School of Drama (NSD), Naseeruddin Shah joined FTII Pune before catching Shyam Benegal?s eye, who cast him in Nishant in 1975. Since then, there has been no looking back. But the man who has made such a mark from Masoom to Mohra, Sir to Sarfarosh, keeps coming back to where he belongs ? theatre. 

 Shah has been instrumental in staging Shakespeare and modern plays like Beckett?s Waiting for Godot and Neil Simon?s The Odd Couple. 

 Over the past 27 years, he has been involved in more than 100 English and Hindi productions with his troupe Motley, which he runs with wife Ratna Pathak and daughter Heeba. 

 The group is currently engaged in producing plays based on Urdu and Hindi literature (featuring the likes of Ismat Chugtai, Saadat Hasan Manto and Kahlil Gibran). 

 After the critically acclaimed Ismat Apa Ke Naam, Shah has launched his latest production, Katha Collage, combining two stories by Munshi Premchand and one by Kamtanath. 

 Om Puri

 As a child, the boy from Patiala wanted to join the army but ended up dabbling with theatre at Punjab University. 

 Om Puri started his career as a lower-division clerk and a lab assistant before taking the plunge into acting with a three-year course at NSD. 

 Around this time, Puri did a string of radio plays and performed in a variety of productions from Indian folk to Shakespeare and even the Japanese kabuki. There, a Hindi production of Shakespeare?s Hamlet finally turned the spotlight on the promising young man.

 Before long, in 1983, Govind Nihalani picked Puri for the role of Anant Welanker in Ardh Satya. The idealist cop who gets sucked into the vicious police-politician vortex marked the birth of an artiste who straddled the worlds of parallel and commercial cinema, comedy and pathos, hero and villain, in east or in the west.

 Anupam Kher

 Has any actor enacted his own life on stage? Perhaps not. But Anupan Kher is doing just that.

 Kuchh Bhi Ho Sakta Hai, an interesting autobiographical piece directed by Feroze Khan, finds Kher narrating and performing snippets from his life ? his eventful journey from the small town of Shimla to the glitzy corridors of Bollywood.

 Kher reminisces how a few decades ago he morphed from a struggling youth into the 60-something anguished father in Mahesh Bhatt?s Saaransh.

 And in between the more than 300 films that he has done in roles of various hues, the NSD graduate has travelled the globe with wife Kiran and their hit production Saalgirah.

 Paresh Rawal

 When he wants, Paresh Rawal sends the crowd into splits from the moment he sets foot on stage. 

 The commerce and economics graduate started acting in school and honed his skills in the inter-college circuit. But the screen splash waited till Javed Akhtar spotted him on stage and fetched him a role in Arjun. 

 The villain of the piece in many films stunned everyone with a sensitive rendering of a eunuch in Tamanna. But his funny bone really came to the fore with Hera Pheri.

 On stage, slapstick comedy is Rawal?s forte, producing one hit play after another. 

 With wife Swarup Sampat, Rawal has been here and there staging Shaadibarbadi.com, a rib-tickling play that takes a look at life after marriage. 

 Now, he is off again with his troupe Aangikam, performing Naughty at Forty, a slapstick comedy that features him as a traditional Gujarati husband.

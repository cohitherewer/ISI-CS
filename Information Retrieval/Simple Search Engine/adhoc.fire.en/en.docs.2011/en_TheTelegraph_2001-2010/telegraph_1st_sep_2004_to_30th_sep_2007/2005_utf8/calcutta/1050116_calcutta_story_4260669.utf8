Broadband for busybee

TechTalk

 Employees at Samsung Electronics show off 

the company?s latest cool tool ? cell phone model SCH-S310, in Seoul, South Korea, 

on January 12. According to Samsung, it is the world?s first movement recognition 

cell phone, which uses 3D motion recognition technology for user interface. The 

user can wave a number in the air, the phone will read the movement and then dial 

the number. Just shake it twice to end a call or delete spam messages. The price 

tag is still a mystery, but the gadget will be in South Korean stores by March 

this year. India when? (Reuters) 

Broadband is the big boom these days. Superfast downloads, 

smooth video and audio over the Internet and webpages loading in an instant ? 

the magic word promises all this and much more. But the average home Internet 

user, tired of waiting hours for things to happen over a dial-up connection, wonders 

how exactly all this is going to happen. A broad view...

What is broadband?

High capacity, high speed transmission channel, carried 

on coaxial or fibre-optic cables with a wider bandwidth than conventional copper 

telephone lines. Broadband channels can carry video, voice and data simultaneously. 

The government of India?s Broadband Policy for 2004 

defines broadband as ?An ?always-on? data connection that is able to support interactive 

services, including Internet access, and has the capability of the minimum download 

speed of 256 kilo bits per second (kbps) to an individual subscriber from the 

Point Of Presence of the service provider intending to provide broadband service...?

The policy tries to recognise ?the potential of ubiquitous 

broadband service in growth of gross domestic product and enhancement in quality 

of life through societal applications including tele-education, tele-medicine, 

e-governance, entertainment as well as employment generation by way of high speed 

access to information and web-based communication?.

Setting 256 kbps as the minimum download speed is 

significant, since as the government observes, ?currently, high speed Internet 

access is available at various speeds from 64 kbps onwards and at present an always-on 

high speed Internet access at 128 kbps is considered as ?broadband?? there are 

no uniform standards?.

What do you get now?

Only 5 to 6 kbps speed over a dial-up connection. 

Internet over cable (available through cable operators) offers significantly higher 

speed, but lacks standard service and speed. Direct Internet Access System (DIAS) 

from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) tried to bridge the gap between broadband 

and narrowband. Providing connectivity through the existing telephone line, this 

offered 128 kbps speed, which dips to 64 kbps during a phone call.

Where does India stand?

Not in an enviable position in Internet penetration, 

let alone broadband. But numbers should grow since according to the Broadband 

Policy, the estimated growth of broadband and Internet users is seen as 6 and 

3 million by 2005, 18 and 9 million by 2007 and 40 and 20 million by 2010.

According to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 

(Trai) data, at the end of 2003, India had 0.4 Internet connections per 100 persons, 

compared to China?s 2.5, Malaysia?s 12 and Korea?s 26. Broadband connections were 

0.02 for India, 1.4 for China, 0.4 for Malaysia and 25 for Korea. The growth for 

Korea has been particularly remarkable, since as recently as 1996, it had Internet 

subscriber penetration of under 2 per cent. Broadband reached close to 1 per cent 

penetration only in 1999.

What happens next?

Home users have two reasons to be happy. Friday saw 

the nationwide launch of BSNL?s DataOne Broadband services. Utilising its massive 

telephone infrastructure already in place, the public telecom giant aims to offer 

broadband Internet services over existing copper telephone lines to home and enterprise 

users at budget prices.

The speed ranges from 256 kbps to 2 mbps (mega-bits 

per second). Subsequently, BSNL would provide Virtual Private Network (VPN), video 

and audio on demand, multi-casting and video conferencing facilities.

The other big promise is from Reliance Infocomm, with 

a speed of 768 kbps. Reliance Infocomm?s foundation would be its fibre-optic network 

laid across the city. High speed Internet, video and audio on demand, multi-player 

gaming and television channels are all in the pipeline. Only setback: BSNL managed 

to beat it to the launch date.

At what price?

BSNL has several price packages on offer, with monthly 

rentals as low as Rs 500, bulk discounts and options to buy or rent the modem 

required for Internet access. 

Reliance Infocomm is keeping all plans under wraps, 

including tariff. According to company sources, they would be ?fiercely competitive?, 

much like its cell phone service launch. 

Price is an integral component in the success and 

penetration of Internet, particularly broadband. Trai notes that ?the cost at 

which Internet and broadband service is provided to consumers needs to be brought 

in line with and even below international norms?. BSNL and Reliance Infocomm may 

trigger another price war in the broadband Internet market with the winner, of 

course, being the consumer.

 Traders knock on cop door

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alarmed at the spurt in abductions of traders, garment merchants of the Metiabruz, Garden Reach and Mahestala areas, on the southern fringes of the city, have sought the intervention of the chief minister and senior police officers. 

 They have already set up dates early next week for meetings with the cops. 

 ?We have been spending sleepless nights, after six garment traders were kidnapped from the area over the past two years. They have returned home safe, but we fear it could be our turn next. We should regroup under a platform at this critical juncture,? said Mursalin Mollah, CPM legislator of Mahestala and secretary of West Bengal Tailors? Union, on Wednesday.

 He criticised the role of the police, saying that the law-enforcers were not making a serious effort to arrest the kidnappers. ?We do not know whether those who had been abducted had been forced to pay a hefty ransom or not. It appears that police did not help much. We need to make the cops aware of the situation, so that next time, the kidnappers are rounded up,? he added. 

 Nearly 200,000 garment merchants ply trade to the tune of nearly Rs 5 crore daily in the area. According to Mollah, they need to put up a united front to ward off the criminals engaged in extortion and kidnapping.

 ?Two key unions ? West Bengal Tailors? Union and West Bengal Readymade Garment Merchants? Association ? are the prime movers behind the proposed meetings. The details of how to minimise crime in the area will be worked out in the meetings,? said a union leader.

 Mollah felt that the incidence of crime in the zone has not decreased despite bifurcation of Mahestala and Metiabruz police stations to improve vigilance. 

 The new police stations are Rabindranagar and Nadial.

 Superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, S.N. Gupta denied that the police were not doing enough. ?We are regularly patrolling the area to curb criminal activities. Besides, we are regularly interacting with local residents,? said Gupta.

 He added: ?It?s good that both the police and local representatives will discuss the matter threadbare at an emergency meeting.?

 Behala Bodhayan is the dream of a handful of parents who wanted their physically and mentally-challenged children to realise their full potential. 

 The institution took shape over the past two decades, through their conviction and determination, to provide vocational training to help them become self-sufficient.

 Rikta Ghosh, secretary of Behala Bodhayan and the pivotal force behind it, says: ?It started 23 years ago, when my mentally-challenged son Subrata was born. I didn?t know where to go for advice or how to help him. Three years later, when my daughter was born, I observed Subrata trying to learn along with her.?

 That made up Ghosh?s mind. She decided to train him along with her daughter, and not in isolation. Soon, a number of parents in the area with mentally-challenged children approached her and together, they started the institution. Today, 63 parents are part of Behala Bodhayan.

 The institution trains challenged children in various vocational activities, like grinding spices and making soft toys, table mats, wall hangings or jute bags, doing fabric painting on clothes, binding books and more. ?The idea is to generate self-employment for them, so that they can survive on their own with the support of the institution even after their families are no more,? explains Ghosh.

 Though the institution is often approached by parents, it has to turn them away due to a lack of infrastructure and a resource crunch. ?It?s on the ground floor of my two-storeyed house. We do not have adequate infrastructure or enough money to support so many students,? regrets the secretary.

 The institution is run almost solely on funds contributed by parents like Shanti Kabiraj, whose son Sudeb studies there, as well as from the money earned by selling the products made by the children. Though Ghosh had approached the social welfare department of the state government several times, she was put off by their apathy.

 A few years ago, Ramakrishna Mission extended its support to Behala Bodhayan, and began providing training in food processing to the youngsters, besides organising weekly study circles for parents to educate them on how to guide their children. 

 ?We have started sending our counsellors to the homes of the children we cannot accommodate at the centre, to train them,? Ghosh adds. Now Behala Bodhayan wants to buy land and expand further. ?But we do not have the capital,? she says. ?However, we were given to understand that if we can procure the land, the government will help us.?

 Pointing out Sanjay Bhattacharjee, 18, who is physically handicapped and also suffers from a speech problem, Ghosh says with quiet pride: ?Sanjay learnt hand printing and is now printing forms for the institute. It?s his way of paying us back.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Virtual laboratory on discs

 JAYANTA STHANAPATI, director of Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) met the readers of The Telegraph at his office on February 16 to answer their queries. Participants included Soma Ghosh, Arijit Adhikary, Mrinal Kanti Bandopadhay, Sandip Banerjee, Mihir Maity, Ananda Sur and Srinjoy Basu

Mihir Maity: I have heard that the museum runs a centre that provides training in operation of amateur radio, commonly known as HAM. Can you tell me more about the centre?

 We conduct a short-duration courses on the operation of amateur radio. The students are familiarised with call signs and other technical details pertaining to amateur radio. They are also taught the basics of electronics, as a sound understanding of the subject is necessary to be a successful operator. 

 We also provide guidance so that the students can successfully clear the test conducted by the Centre to grant licence for operating an amateur radio station.

Soma Ghosh: Is there any scope for conventional scientific research in the museum?

 We do not have the scope for conventional research. We have, however, developed a few software that can simulate a laboratory experience.

 This initiative of our education officers provides tools to the students to perform experiments without having access to well-equipped laboratories. 

 We also have plans to launch compact discs that will help students perform experiments on their personal computers. The discs will soon be available in the market.

Sandip Banerjee: Do you conduct any job-oriented course at the museum? Is there any scope for the unemployed to earn while working at the museum?

 Though our infrastructure is better than most colleges, we do not impart education formally. But we do have some courses on computer science that can help an individual get acquainted with the modern trends in the subject.

 Since our aim is to motivate and encourage people to think scientifically, the criteria for admission to such courses are not rigid. A variety of people, from fresh graduates to individuals who have left studies decades ago, attend the courses.

 We provide apprenticeships to students who have done our courses, including students from both technical and general streams. 

 After conducting a written and an oral test, we appoint deserving candidates as trainees. We generally try to help fresh pass-outs, so that they have the option to apply for other jobs once they have gained experience at our centre. 

Srinjoy Basu: I have seen museum personnel in mobile vans demonstrate models in schools in Burdwan. Do you conduct similar programmes in city schools?

 We have two exhibit vans that visit schools in the rural and suburban areas to demonstrate scientific models to the students.

 We generally send the vans to schools located more than 40 km from the city. We don?t feel the need to send the exhibit vans to city schools as students studying there can visit our museum.

Sandip Banerjee: Why don?t you sponsor a programme on science to generate greater awareness among people about the latest trends in science?

 I must clarify that though we want to encourage all sections of the people towards developing a clear vision of science, we generally work with students studying in classes VII to XII. 

 There is a regular programme in our museum in which we demonstrate scientific phenomena and explain them in lecture sessions.

 We had sponsored a programme on television that is no longer telecast. We have now tied up with the ABP group to hold interactive sessions with students in the form of a quiz programme. The programme will be telecast from March.

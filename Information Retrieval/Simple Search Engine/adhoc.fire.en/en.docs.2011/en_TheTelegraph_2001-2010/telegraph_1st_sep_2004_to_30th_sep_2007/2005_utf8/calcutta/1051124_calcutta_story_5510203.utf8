 Passionate about pastries

Thierrys tryst with pastries dates back to when he was 16. I loved pastries and would spend all my pocket money at the pastry shop in front of my house in Metz in east France. Gradually, I became curious about the world of bakeries and pastries. And as fate would have it, there was an ad in the newspaper by a confectioner looking for a pastry-making trainee. I took it up and there has been no looking back since then, smiles Thierry, who has graduated with a degree in pastry and bakery making.

 Thierry excels in modern-day cooking and French styling. He believes that the world of desserts has room for great innovation. Whipping up French pastries, bakes, petit fours, quiches and other traditional delights is where his heart lies.

 I am passionate about conventional delicacies that are like precious antiques and the spirit of Flurys is that of a legendary tea room. So we struck a common chord from the very beginning.

 Calcutta, for him, is a lively city with great scope for international confectionery. But the pastry business is not just about whipping up exotic delicacies. It is a patient process that includes understanding the likes and dislikes of the customers, internal tasting sessions to be sure of quality and laying out innovations from time to time, feels Thierry.

 The dessert specialist is delighted with the modern equipment at the Flurys factory. Flurys has long been synonymous with quality food and we shall maintain the standards, says Thierry, stressing the importance of the various aspects of production and the need for consumer satisfaction.

 The globetrotter has been to Guatemala and to South Pacific, his last stop being the Grand Hyatt in Amman, Jordan. Every country is a whole new world. New ideas, interesting nuggets of information, diverse cultures and of course the language..., says the man well-versed in English, Arabic, Spanish, Turkish and French and now bits of Bengali and Hindi.

 And the flavour of this Frenchman is set to pervade Park Street, with a a traditional pastry festival at the Atrium not far away.

 Model Pinky gets draped in a Sujata Saraogi creation 

 Revival and promotion of the wavering and vanishing art of hand-weaving and hand-block printing is the cause designer Sujata Saraogi has been driven by for the past few years. And now this has prompted an exhibition of traditional weaves, dyes and printing techniques of India at Finesse, in Alipore, till August 17.

 The display at 11/1B, New Road includes saris in cotton and various silks like mulberry, tussar, munga, eri, dupion, matka katiya and ghicha balkel. These silks lend themselves to printing and embroidery and are used innovatively in saris, scarves and suit lengths. Handwoven cotton saris from Phulia are hand-printed at Sujatas unit using various techniques like mud-resist, batik, discharge, pigment and vegetable dye.

 Kantha stitch done by women of various districts of Bengal embellishes the saris and scarves in geometric motifs to lend a modern touch to the traditional embroidery.

 It has always been my aim to save the traditional weaves, dyes and prints of India, especially Bengal, from slipping into extinction, says Sujata. The collection starts at Rs 1,200.

 Freedom fad

 If you want to wear your patriotism on your sleeve, head for Westside. The 22, Camac Street store is taking the freedom route through fashion with a wide range of ensembles coloured in saffron, white, blue and green.

 The collection encompasses womens ethnic wear with a variety of striped and embroidered kurtas and kurtis as well as mens cotton and linen kurtas with stylised collars and sleeves. The collection starts at Rs 299. 

 We wanted to encourage people to bring in the spirit of freedom through clothes, said a spokesperson.

 Physicians get Buddha?s goat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: Eat, drink and forget your doctor. A Telegraph picture

 Eat all you want ? live as you want ? and forget what the doctor says? These pearls of wisdom were cast by none other than chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The occasion was the signing of a memorandum of understanding with JRD Tata Trust and Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BAIF) on augmenting the production of goat meat in the state.

 ?We produce the highest amount of goat meat in the country. But, since Bengal is also the highest consumer, we fall short of demand. Hence, it is important that meat production should be increased,? said Bhattacharjee, who was overseeing the signing of the tripartite agreement. 

 Told that red meat is not exactly what the doctor would prescribe and that white meat was recommended instead, chief minister Bhattacharjee had no time for the argument.

 ?Doctors are divided on this issue. The debate on white meat versus red meat will continue to rage. One should not take the doctor?s advice seriously. Continue to eat whatever you want,? proclaimed the chief minister. 

 Bhattacharjee, for one, is someone who practises what he preaches.

 And his interest in the good things of life does not stop with red meat alone.

 Known to be a habitual smoker, he would earlier be seen puffing away even in the corridors of Writers? Buildings. Though he is not seen with a lighted cigarette any longer ? ever since smoking was banned in government offices ? Bhattacharjee now smokes in the privacy of his room at Writers?. 

 Caffeine is his poison and he downs countless cups of black coffee every day in his office.

 A cineaste, the chief minister spends most of his evenings at Nandan watching the latest releases, as well as the best of world cinema. He is also an avid book-lover, and has himself penned poems, in addition to translating the works of Marquez.

 Under Bhattacharjee?s leadership, the Left Front government has managed to project a liberal image, courtesy some of the decisions taken by him in recent times. The government has taken a ?liberal? approach to issuing liquor licences in the state ? a move that drew flak from many quarters, including even the Front allies. 

 Meanwhile, the doctors? lobby argues that even though it is not necessary to consult physicians at the slightest pretext, certain dietary dos and don?ts have to be adhered to in order to keep oneself healthy.

 ?Why talk of heart patients alone, I don?t advise even a normal, healthy person to eat more than two pieces of red meat on a weekly basis. Being rich in saturated fats, it increases the level of cholesterol to a great extent,? says Ashok Kar, former professor of cardiology at SSKM Hospital.

 According to Kar, Indian dietary habits and lifestyle also put them at a higher risk to coronary diseases.

 ?Unlike in the West, Indian food is mainly fried. The excess oil in dishes like kasha mangsho gets converted into toxic substances during digestion, which is very harmful in the long run,? Kar warns.

 Does that get your goat?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Connect with a net of rail lines

 - RING OF TRACKS TO BRIDGE THE GAP

 Commuting between Calcutta and its suburbs will be a lot easier, as a string of railway projects ? underground and surface ? is going to criss-cross the city and also form rings around it.

 Two Circular Railway projects ? Majherhat to Prinsep Ghat and Dum Dum Cantonment to the airport ? are ready for commissioning. The authorities are conducting surveys for a third ring project, from Ultadanga to Rajarhat, and another project that will link Barrackpore to Sonarpur, via New Town.

 These apart, there is the East-West Metro project, for which the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) is expected to submit the final report by the end of this month.

 ?The corporation had submitted a proposal to the state government, but it was sent back with some recommendations about lowering the project cost. They will submit the final report this month,? said P. R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the nodal agency for the project.

 According to CMDA officials, lack of funds has been a major hindrance to the project and the DMRC has been asked to curtail project costs by decreasing the length of the corridor.

 The original stretch was to run from Rajarhat to Dasnagar. But it has been recommended that that the eastern end terminate at Salt Lake?s Karunamoyee and the western end originate from some where near Howrah. ?We have also recommended reducing the tunnel heights and the capacity of the rakes,? an official said.

 Work on the Metro Railway stretch between Tollygunge and Garia is scheduled to be completed by 2007. Inter-connectivity, the authorities feel, will be complete once the east-west project is commissioned.

 ?What the commuter badly needs now is a complete north-south-east-west connectivity. The Light Railway Transit (LRT) will not provide that and it is also not as environment-friendly as the Metro Railway,? a senior transport department official pointed out.

 As for the Ultadanga-Rajarhat Circular Railway project, an official said the first phase would end at Lake Town. ?The link will be later extended to Rajarhat, subject to the availability of land. This was decided after a survey by officials of the railway ministry, CMDA and the state transport department.? A feasibility study will be conducted soon.

 The link will pass along the Kestopur canal and via the outer boundary of Salt Lake. The Metro Railway is ready for the extension of the Circular Railway along a 2.5-km stretch, from Ultadanga to Lake Town.

 ?Between Ultadanga and Lake Town, the tracks will be elevated and will run above VIP Road,? said an official.

 Sources said the survey for the Barrackpore-Sonarpur link, bypassing Sealdah, is expected to receive the railway board?s nod soon. ?It will cover a distance of around 50 km and provide direct connectivity between the northern and southern suburbs,? the official explained.

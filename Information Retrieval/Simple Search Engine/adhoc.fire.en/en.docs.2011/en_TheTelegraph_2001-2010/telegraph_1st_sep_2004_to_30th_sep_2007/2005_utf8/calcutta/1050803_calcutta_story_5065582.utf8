The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Freedom of view vs fraud check

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should astrology programmes on television be banned?

 Rimli datta,

 Salt Lake

 About half a dozen channels air programmes by bogus astrologers throughout the day. They need to be reined in immediately. Astrology is a science and many events can be predicted. However, rigorous study and great skill are needed for that. Barring a few, most of the astrologers who appear on television are frauds.They buy timeslots for large sums of money and play with the emotions and beliefs of people.

Tanima Dey, 

 Habra

 Astrology programmes on television should be banned because they affect the development of the country. The media have reported numerous crimes by so-called astrologers. Without resorting to a ban, it will not be possible to fight the blind faith of people. The television astrologers pay people to call up during their programmes to earn the trust of viewers. A ban would put a stop to such practices.

Sohini Roy, 

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue

 Astrology programmes on television must be banned at the earliest. People of all ages are getting hooked on the programmes, which are nothing but advertisements. The programmes only make people mentally weak.

 Arjun Chaudhuri, 

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane

 There is no reason to ban astrology programmes on television. Such programmes have a sizeable audience. The viewers themselves should judge to what extent they are going to believe the pronouncements. If people have any amount of wisdom they won?t allow a programme, no matter how attractively packaged, to take them for a ride.

 Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 

 Entally

 Astrology programmes on television should not be banned. Astrology is a science that enables experts to predict the future. Various factors are taken into consideration while making the predictions. By virtue of the forecasts, many people have been able to choose the right path in life. However, the predictions can be misleading and astrologers might differ in their verdict. The comments made by television astrologers are general in nature, therefore it would be impractical to draw definite conclusions on their basis. Astrology programmes also deal with spirituality, which is very important in our fast-moving world.

 Telecast of astrology programmes has become a norm for Bengali channels. Some channels focus totally on such programmes, as the demand for call-in shows with astrologers is huge. It is difficult to believe that the reliance on astrology has not diminished with the spread of education. Banning astrology programmes is only going to hurt the sentiments and beliefs of a large section of society. People should be allowed to watch what they want to, even if that is to their detriment.

 Hemanta Kumar Dutta, 

 Shibpur, Howrah

 I wholeheartedly welcome the suggestion of the ban. At the very least, some sort of restriction should be imposed on astrology programmes. Unscrupulous people seem to have banded together to telecast such programmes. These deceitful individuals are misleading the innocent day and night to earn money. Awareness needs to be generated against them.

 Pijush Nandi,

 Barasat

 The government should make it mandatory for television channels to provide a list of programmes they are going to telecast. This would help in preventing astrologers from misleading viewers using the small screen. If astrology programmes are not banned, then militants might as well be taught through television how to make bombs, blow up buildings and shoot people.

 Joydeep Chatterjee,

 Shyambazar

 Airing astrology programmes should be made illegal. Such programmes affect common people the most. They become mentally resigned to their fate after watching the programmes. The loss of self confidence eventually makes them lose their competitive edge. 

 Priyanka Saha,

 Birati

 Astrology programmes are becoming popular day by day, even though they make people dumb. It is incredible that fortune-tellers can make people believe that certain stones can change their lives. 

 Subho Bhattacharya,

 Deb Lane 

 It is impossible for ordinary people to say whether astrology is a proper subject of study or not. Those who have faith in astrology will always claim that it is scientific. I think a more important question is whether astrologers can promote themselves in the guise of conducting television programmes. A degree of authenticity is still attached to television programmes. The astrologers exploit that to increase their clientele. They should not be allowed to do so.

Saurabh Dhanuka, 

 Salt Lake

 Astrology is a tool of exploitation. It poses a danger to the masses, especially the superstitious section of the society. The astrologers delude people with false promises. People should rely on themselves and not walk into the trap laid by astrologers.

 Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake

 Nobody can change destiny. Relying entirely on astrologers or their baseless predictions in this age of science is stupid. 

Neepa mitra,

 Salt Lake

 Astrology programmes on television should definitely be banned. The subject flourishes due to narrowmindedness. One should always remember that it is in our hands to change our destiny. A false prediction can have drastic results.

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum

 People with little talent have taken up palmistry and astrology to earn a living. Some of them have even become rich by winning the trust of people. Since that is the only way to quick bucks, novice astrologers are paying television channels to air their shows. The programmes must be banned.

 R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Shyamnagar

 Astrology is not a real science. It is not based on fundamental and universal rules. Hence, it cannot possibly reveal the truth. Programmes on astrology should not be televised as it does not do any good to anyone.

 Bandana Chakraborty,

 Purba Putiari

 Astrology programmes on television should be banned as early as possible. Astrology depends completely on accurate calculation. And it is obviously not possible for a fortune-teller to calculate accurately within a few seconds on live dial-in programmes.

 Sukanta Pachal,

 Howrah

 We are slaves to our circumstances. It is not really possible for anyone to foretell what lies ahead. But gullible people, even educated ones, approach astrologers for solutions to their problems. The astrologers cash in on their plight to make a quick buck. Astrology programmes are unethical and need to be banned.

 Biswajit Guha Roy,

 If astrologers can really predict the future they should help prevent natural disasters and terrorist attacks. People who believe in astrology are fools. They are a barrier to the development of a nation.

 Arunesh Kundu,

 NK Ghosal Road

 If telecast of adult films and other objectionable programmes are supported by many on the ground that viewers are wise enough to judge for themselves what is good and bad, isn?t the same logic valid for astrology programmes? In case the viewers are cheated, that is their concern. If psychology and meteorology can be sciences, so is astrology. Just as all psychological analyses and meteorological forecasts are not accurate every time, astrological predictions, too, go wrong. We are not ready to consider the lapses of astrologers, because Western academics do not back the subject. Such is our colonial hangover. Even the Vedas advocated the study of astrology.

 Patish Chandra Dey,

 RN Tagore Road

 Astrology can be effective if practised rigorously. But unfortunately, like in other professions, quacks abound in this field. I feel they should be identified and punished rather than banning astrology programmes totally. A blanket ban will make even genuine astrologers lose their jobs, leading to other problems.

 Debarati Chakraborty,

 Purba Putiari

 Astrologers make a fool of their viewers on television and earn loads of money. Astrology programmes should be replaced with psychological counselling. Television is a powerful medium; it should not be misused.

 Arindam Ray,

 Salt Lake

 It is entirely up to the viewer to decide whether he or she will watch astrology programmes on television or not. The government has no right to ban the programmes as they do not harm the society as a whole.

 Gayatri Chakraborty,

 School Road

 A ban on astrology programmes will not protect people from being cheated. Rather, the majority should realise the dangers posed by fraud astrologers. The media should act as an eye-opener. Also, shouldn?t the authorities of the channels which air the programmes be penalised?

 Ratan Guptu,

 Behala

 It?s time to root out our age-old tradition of fortune tellers. The media should join hands by not publishing or telecasting astrology.

 Pranjan Mitra,

 Address not given

 There was always a veil of secrecy surrounding astrology. The telecast of programmes on the subject has resulted in people approaching it more scientifically. The programmes also provide easy access to renowned astrologers. A ban on the programmes is not justifiable given their popularity.

 Handloom is being passed up for power loom products, saris for salwars.

 To keep up with the demands of the market and with an eye on the global marketplace, Bengal?s weavers are now learning how to enhance their offering to stay afloat.

 The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) has just completed a pilot project with tangail weavers of Nadia and garad weavers from Murshidabad, the first effort to upgrade the skills of large groups of artisans who are bearing the brunt of changing textile needs. It culminated on Wednesday in a buyer-seller meet on NIFT?s Salt Lake campus to allow the village craftsmen to mingle with potential clients.

 Eleven societies in two districts were the target of the project, supported by the directorate of handloom and textiles, the district rural development authority and the zilla parishad. They worked on a range of designs, which departed from the traditional sari, conceived by NIFT students.

 Samples of cushion-covers, bedspreads, curtains and table linen using tangail and garad were put up at two stalls in the auditorium, thronged by prospective private-sector buyers, cottage and small-scale industries minister Bangshagopal Chowdhury and other senior officials.

 Salwar-kameezes, men?s kurtas, ties, stoles and scarves were on show, as were saris, which innovated on traditional design elements. ?The designs we usually work with are old, the same ones that we have been using for the past 25 years or have been handed down through the generations,? explains Kumar Kanti Biswas from Dangapara. ?We get more demand for the new designs,? he adds.

 After a survey of the project area, the NIFT team conducted training sessions on subjects including design, loom modification, colours, trends and needs of the international market.

 From the fare on show on Wednesday, it was clear that more intervention is required before real change is made. Most weavers displayed saris that can be found on the market currently. Those with radically different offering ? usually in the form of scarves and stoles ? were already working with exporters.

 Like Tangail Tantujibi Unnayan Samabay Samity in Fulia. Material produced by the society goes to China. Scarves are also produced for export. While beautiful, the design sensibility is clearly Western.

 One of the companies at the exhibition, Manisha Exports, explains why: ?We tried selling traditional designs, but it didn?t work. They are not considered elegant enough,? explains S.K. Modi. So, while ethnic elements might work well internationally, a completely Indian-look product might not. But there is still much scope. Modi, for instance, gives designs and colour schemes to local weavers, a common arrangement he is happy with.

 Similar projects are being considered to rejuvenate the baluchari and jamdani traditions.

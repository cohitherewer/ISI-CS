The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I am a senior citizen and I take cycle-rickshaws often to travel short distances. I find them very inconvenient. The seat is far too above the ground. Hence, climbing on and off is an ordeal for someone of my age. The seat is not wide enough to accommodate two people and it slopes downwards, making the passengers slip. Add to that the slippery rexine covering on the seat. With such a rickety frame, rickshaws are most unsuitable to Calcutta?s potholed roads. Can?t the regional transport authority redesign rickshaws with lower chassis on proper suspensions and bearings? Websites like www.manhattanrickshaw.com and www.bikesatwork.com can be of help.

 Any kind of strike by almost anybody disrupts even emergency services in Calcutta. CMC?s conservancy staff do not collect garbage on any strike day whether or not they are affiliated to the agitating party/organisation/union. Even if the government supports a strike, it should ensure that emergency services are available.

 CR Avenue recently got a fresh coat of asphalt. But I was shocked to see that the road has been dug up to erect barricades near Mohammad Ali Park. Will the road be repaired after the Pujas? The back gate of the park could have been turned into the entrance to the pandal. This would have eased the congestion on the road.

 Having failed to check the indiscriminate use and littering of streets with plastic carry bags and tea cups that choke city drains, the government has initiated a move to ban their manufacture.

 According to environment department officers, the ban will cover manufacture of carry bags of less than 20-micron thickness and measuring 12 inches by 8 inches, and cups of less than 2-mm thickness and three inches in height. Besides, a total ban has been imposed on the manufacture of recycled plastic carry bags.

 Although use of plastic carry bags and cups is restricted, there is no ban on their production. According to the existing rules, selling, storing and using carry bags of less than 20-micron thickness and measuring 12 inches by 8 inches and cups of less than 2-mm thick and three inches in height is banned. However, these can be manufactured for sale outside Bengal.

 ?Most of the manufacturers are cashing in on the loopholes in the existing rules. Though they are giving declarations that the thinner carry bags and cups will be sold outside Bengal, tonnes of bags and cups are flooding the local market from their units. If we do not stop their manufacture, the plastic menace cannot be stopped,?? chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Friday.

 ?We are discussing the matter with legal experts and seeking opinions and suggestions from environmentalists. The chief minister himself is keen to put an end to the plastic menace. If we cannot restrict use of plastic, we will not be able to save the city from recurring waterlogging,?? the chief secretary pointed out.

 The government move follows a recent Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) report sent to the government, saying the city?s drainage system has been choked by plastic carry bags and cups. The report suggested steps to restrict use of these items.

 According to officers, about 500 tonnes of plastic carry bags and cups are produced daily in the city itself, of which at least 75 per cent goes into drains.

 A large number of units have come up in the Tangra-Tiljala-Topsia and Ultadanga areas, where recycled plastic carry bags are manufactured.

 ?We cannot impose a total ban on using plastic carry bags and cups, as it is an important mode of packing and carrying goods. Our endeavour is to control its use and even more importantly, its disposal. First, we will stop manufacturing thinner plastic bags, and second, we will develop a system of disposal of used bags and cups,?? Deb said.

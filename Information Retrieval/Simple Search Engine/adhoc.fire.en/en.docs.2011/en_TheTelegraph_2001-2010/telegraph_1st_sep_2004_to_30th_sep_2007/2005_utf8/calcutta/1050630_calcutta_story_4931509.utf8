 Exporting message in a movie

 Ready to start two full-length features after his Oscar-nominated short Little Terrorist, 

 ASHVIN KUMAR tells Pratim D. Gupta why a film can never be only about entertainment

 He labels himself ?an underdog?, the outsider who wants to enter an industry ?where six families do not allow any newcomer to make a foray?. That?s Ashvin Kumar, India?s only nominee at Oscars 2005, talking about the Johars, Chopras and Bachchans of the world. Having successfully got his short film, Little Terrorist, to screen at the big theatres across the country, fashion designer Ritu Kumar?s son is now set to make full-length features, operating from outside the Bollywood model of movies.

 ?There is no concept of a genre film in India, which is the standard worldwide,? he points out. ?The old Bollywood producers are not being able to answer to the changing tastes of the audience. Why rehash an Amores Perros or a Crouching Tiger? You have to break the mould. You have to say something in your movies.?

 But that hasn?t prompted Ashvin to leave the country despite Little Terrorist travelling to 50 festivals across the globe. While he has chosen to look for foreign funding, his content, he maintains, will remain strictly desi. ?I must explore my own backyard first, before venturing out. There are so many stories in India that have not been told. The changes of liberalisation after 1991 have to be shown to the world outside. What I want to do is make films locally about specific Indian problems for a global audience. Just like a No Man?s Land. The same kind of films are being made in countries like Iran, Japan and Latin America.?

 Apart from the Indian roots, a social relevance is a must for Ashvin. ?I am not a social activist at all. But I strongly believe that social issues should be spread in an entertainment format. I don?t enjoy making films that are not about something. One of the main reasons why Little Terrorist did so well and was shortlisted for the Oscars was the fact that it was the right film at the right time. I am not overindulgent about arthouse films. Movies can be entertaining but they have to convey messages.?

 This thought is at work for Ashvin?s next film titled The Forest, which talks about wildlife conservation in a filmi format. ?I wanted to say something about this whole business of trees being felled and animals being poached. It?s no use preaching. So a commercial film with an international release is the only solution. I am using the thriller genre to export the message. I want to raise the issue of conservation in a package that everyone can grapple with. The entire ecosystem is in a very serious crisis.?

 Doesn?t that sound very Kaal, Kaal? ?I have no clue about that film,? pat comes the reply from Ashvin. The Forest will have a Bollywood cast ?Manoj Bajpai and Sandhya Mridul have already been signed on ? and will be shot from November in the jungles of Terai. The story takes off with a young married couple going on vacation in the hope of forestalling divorce but are so preoccupied with their anger that they ignore signs of a man-eating leopard on the prowl. 

 ?We have assembled a truly international crew from all parts of the globe including UK, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Germany and North America,? adds Ashvin. ?I am planning for a Cannes 2006 premiere and then releasing the film across 1,500 theatres in the US before releasing it in India. For our sales agents we have got on board a popular Hollywood company named Arclight Films, who?s promoting the next Johnny Depp film.? 

 Apart from The Forest adventure, Ashvin is also set to remake his short film Road To Ladakh into a feature film format. The film may also mark the first official co-production between an Indian production company (Ashvin?s Alipur Films) and the UK Film Council. ?Oscar-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss saw the short in Cannes and his company Dreyfuss/James Productions has also come on board. While Irrfan will still head the cast, we are looking for a big American star opposite him for this road film.?

 Losing the Oscar to The Wasp never set Ashvin back, instead it has helped him get finances. ?There are so many scripts lying around abroad that no one will come to throw money around. But yes, the Oscar nomination did help open up a lot of doors.? Once the Indian roots and social responsibilities are taken care of, Ashvin would like to make a film from the American studio set-up. ?That?s where I believe I will be most comfortable. I have plans to cast Johnny Depp in a romantic comedy set in Kerala...?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 One of my friends, an MCA student, bought a book on programming 

 from a shop on College Street. Along with the book, a floppy 

 disc with a certain number of programmes was provided. Once 

 home, he found out that the floppy disk was blank. The next 

 day he returned to the book-seller, who refused to replace 

 the floppy. It is true that floppies might turn out defective 

 or data might be corrupt in them. But in my friend?s case, 

 chances are that that the shop sold off the original floppy 

 separately and handed a blank one to my friend. Such incidents 

 are common in College Street. Manufacturers should put a 

 tamper-proof seal on the pack containing floppies/CDs so 

 that retailers are unable to tamper with it. This would 

 also help buyers distinguish between originals and fakes. 

 Sourish Misra, Salt Lake. 

 A policeman had been deployed on SN Roy Road, opposite 

 Medicament medical shop, in New Alipore, to ensure that 

 goods carriers do not enter that stretch. But to my shock, 

 a few weeks ago I spotted him shamelessly accepting a few 

 coins before allowing a vehicle to pass through. A few such 

 instances have been highlighted by The Telegraph 

 before. The authorities should conduct surprise checks, 

 catch such policemen red-handed and terminate their services.

 Trucks carrying sand for construction purposes do not cover 

 the load with a sheet of polythene or cloth. Recently, a 

 friend had a bitter experience while travelling in a long-distance 

 bus on National Highway 34. She was sitting in a window 

 seat and a gust of wind blew sand particles off a passing 

 truck into her eyes. Ultimately, she had to undergo treatment 

 to prevent extensive damage to her eyesight. Can?t the police, 

 pollution control board or any other agency ensure that 

 trucks cover the goods being ferried?

 After the publication of a letter in this column, the lights 

 in the Dum Dum underpass were reinstalled. However, now 

 the situation is back to what it was. Traversing through 

 the subway is a harrowing experience for Metro Railway passengers. 

 Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row. 

 The helmets that most motorcyclists wear these days are 

 only a shade better than showpieces. They neither cover 

 the entire head nor do the riders fasten the strap. While 

 policemen hardly bother, is it not the riders? responsibility 

 to take care of their own safety?

 Arjun Chaudhuri, Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane.

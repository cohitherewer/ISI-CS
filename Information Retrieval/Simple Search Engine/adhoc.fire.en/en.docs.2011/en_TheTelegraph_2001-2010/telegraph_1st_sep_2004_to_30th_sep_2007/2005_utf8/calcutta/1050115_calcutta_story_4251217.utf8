The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Botanical Gardens draws a large number of visitors in all seasons, throughout 

the year. Some of the trees there, like the huge banyan, have almost become a 

part of the city?s heritage. However, during a recent visit I found that two of 

the toilets on the premises were closed. As a result, some irresponsible people 

were relieving themselves near the well-maintained plants. The authorities must 

see to it that proper facilities are available to the visitors and nuisance-makers 

are punished severely. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia. 

 I am a non-collegiate candidate for the MA examination of Calcutta University. 

Recently, when I went to a university official with a request to attest a document, 

the man misbehaved with me. Instead of extending help, two of the clerks shouted 

at me for ?pestering? them. The staff members at the university?s inquiry counter 

are usually found gossiping during office hours. On the other hand, I have found 

the staff at Jadavpur University and Viswa-Bharati to be very polite and helpful 

towards students. I request the Calcutta University authorities to take a leaf 

out of the books of their counterparts and train their staff in public relations. 

 Mehjibin Yunus, Bright Street. 

 The State Central Library situated on CIT Road caters to the needs of a large 

number of readers. But of late, the toilet next to the reading room stays usually 

inundated and dirty. It has not been repaired despite repeated requests to the 

authorities. Readers are forced to go downstairs to use the toilet. I appeal to 

the education department to address the problem. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 For the past few months, some people, claiming to be associated with a religious 

institution, approached residents of our locality requesting them to donate old 

newspapers. Every month they came in a van and took away the newspapers. They 

have stopped coming. But it is not known what exactly they did with the papers. 

Instead of trusting such people, we could donate old newspapers to poor rag-pickers. 

They can at least earn their livelihood by selling the paper.

 Shiv Shankar Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 

 There is no logic in renaming a road or street on a legendary personality. 

Park Street has been associated with many historic events for decades and many 

people are emotionally attached to its name. Mother Teresa deserves better than 

a road renamed for her. Instead, a new scholarship programme or an award or a 

project which benefits the poor can be named after her.

 Hara Lal Chakraborty, Arabinda Nagar.

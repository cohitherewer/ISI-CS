 Luck laws for lovebirds

Feng Shui 

 Pinky Kapoor

 People belonging to the rooster sign should activate 

the west of the house to enhance their love life

Q: I was born in 1981 and hence my animal 

sign is rooster. I am in love with a colleague who was born in 1985 and belongs 

to the animal sign ox. I want to propose marriage to her and would like to know 

our compatibility status. 

S.K

The Solution: Compatibility is immense between 

partners belonging to these animal signs. Ox?s natural element is earth, which 

nourishes the rooster who belongs to the metal element. In the cycle of relationships, 

earth produces metal. Hence she should be extremely supportive to you throughout 

your life. You both will work sincerely towards sustaining a successful marriage. 

West of the house is the compass direction, which is occupied by the rooster. 

To enhance your love life, place a figure of a rooster and an ox here. The figure 

of the rooster will help you gain confidence to propose her and the ox will help 

bring her closer to you.

Q: My daughter (DOB 26.12.?84) wants to 

pursue post-graduation studies in journalism. But she has developed a concentration 

problem. Please advise on how this can be tackled and whether she has chosen the 

right career course.

Priya S.

The Solution: She is a strong wood person and 

also has support of water. So she will succeed in any profession connected with 

the water element. Media and communication will be good options for her and she 

should finish her studies and start earning in the next six years. She seems confused 

from the year 2000 onwards, but will enter into a new phase from February 9. Place 

an image of god in the north-east of her table on a red cloth. Whenever she sits 

down to study, she should light a red candle here and face this direction.

Q: I am about to design a logo for my business 

card. Please suggest a Feng Shui-friendly motif and also advise on its placement 

on the card. 

R. Singhania

The Solution: A logo is a symbol that enhances 

the Chi of a business house. A logo should immediately suggest the business it 

is related to. It should be placed at the top of the visiting card. Don?t encircle 

or enclose it as this would symbolise restricting the progress of the business. 

Colours used should be favourable for you and preferably according to your pillars 

of destiny. The motif should have forward and upward movements so that the business 

soars.

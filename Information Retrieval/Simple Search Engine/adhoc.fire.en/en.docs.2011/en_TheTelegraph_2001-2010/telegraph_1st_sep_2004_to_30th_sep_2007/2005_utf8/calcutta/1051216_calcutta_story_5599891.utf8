The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Artisan shift site finalised

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Good news for the artisans of Kumartuli. As a first step towards a thorough makeover of the north Calcutta landmark, the state government has ?almost finalised? a site for temporary relocation of the 300-odd artisans.

 The government for the past few months had been looking for a suitable site and last week, it had zeroed in on a godown of the public health engineering department, which has some open space around it.

 ?We are in the process of finalising this place as a transit camp. Once this is done, structures will be set up to house the artisans till a new Kumartuli is ready,? P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), said on Wednesday. 

 ?We will start constructing the structures by February and hope to finish work in around five months,? he added.

 The survey for the revamp of the city?s idol-making hub, estimated to cost Rs 22 crore, has been completed. The state has sent the plan to the Centre, seeking funds under the National Urban Renewal Mission.

 ?The project will take two to three years,? Baviskar added. ?The government is discussing the details with the artisans.?

 The proposed overhaul scheme focuses on making Kumartuli cleaner and hygienic. It includes laying of roads and water pipes, installation of street lights and setting up of low-cost housing clusters.

 The CMDA had planned the temporary relocation and refurbishment in phases. But for the sake of ?faster and better? work, officials have settled for a single-phase makeover. 

 ?Some work, like laying underground pipes, may begin by February-March. Once all the artisans and their families vacate the place, main work will start,? Baviskar said.

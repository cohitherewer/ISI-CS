The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rack rage, chart champs

 A slice of retail history on Park 

 Street, Pottermania unplugged, a symbology fixation sparked 

 by The Da Vinci Code, Asterix and Tintin revisited, 

 going ballistic on Ray, Ritwik and Rituparno, swinging to 

 Enrique and Bangla bands big-time? The year that was saw 

 excitement galore at the sensormatic portals and cash tills 

 alike in music and bookstores around town.

 Leading the charge was MusicWorld. 

 The Park Street address created history in the industry, 

 becoming the ?first single store in the country? to achieve 

 a sales turnover of Rs 1 crore in one month in December 

 2004. The average bill value rose to Rs 561, compared to 

 Rs 433 last year, with walk-ins exceeding 1,05,000, according 

 to regional manager Lalita Sinha.

 While cassette-to-CD ratio was 

 at an ?all-time high of 0.7:1? at the Park Street store, 

 VCDs and DVDs grew at a staggering 128 per cent and 339 

 per cent, respectively. Chokher Bali and Harry 

 Potter ? The Prisoner of Azkaban were the top grossers 

 among the new releases of the year, while old classics of 

 Ray and Ghatak evoked great response as well.

 ?The home video segment simply 

 soared during the course of the year, and a lot of movie 

 sales were director-centric,? said Gautam Jatia, CEO of 

 Emami Landmark. Jatia felt the significant reduction in 

 prices of audio CDs and continuing schemes by music companies 

 desperate to offload imports drove sales and triggered a 

 paradigm shift in consumer preferences.

 Among international albums, the 

 runaway hits were Have I Told You Lately and All 

 Hits No Words by Sony Music and Enrique?s Seven Special 

 Asia Tour by Universal, while Norah Jones continued 

 to disappear off the racks as rapidly as last year.

 Hum Tum, Veer-Zaara 

 and Main Hoon Na were the top three soundtracks 

 in terms of sales, while Bengali films Shubho Mahurat 

 and old classics Goopy Gayen Bagha Bayen and 

 Sonar Kella moved well in the VCD/DVD segment, besides 

 Chokher Bali, a sensation at every store. Roman 

 Holiday, Finding Nemo and The Sound of Music 

 were the best-selling international flicks at MusicWorld.

 In books, Dan Brown?s The Da 

 Vinci Code emerged the sensation of the year, smashing 

 all sales records everywhere and spawning huge interest 

 in subjects like numerology, symbology, the Holy Grail and 

 anti-Christ. ?It set a trend, just like the Potter books 

 did in the fantasy genre,? observed Jatia.

 Oxford Bookstore on Park Street 

 recorded a sales growth of around 21 per cent over last 

 year, with categories like new-age/self-help, children, 

 management and Indology growing the most. New-age tomes 

 like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari and The Book 

 Of Prayer were a rage, as were works of fiction like 

 Amitav Ghosh?s The Hungry Tide and Jhumpa Lahiri?s 

 The Namesake.

 ?We have on an average around 

 600 people walking in per day, but towards the end of the 

 year, our footfalls hit 800 on peak weekends,? said Swagat 

 Sengupta, senior manager, merchandising amp; business development, 

 Oxford Bookstore.

 Crossword reported a similar rising 

 graph in footfalls ? 500 after the launch to 850 towards 

 the end of the year. ?There was an increased emphasis on 

 education and learning and a good demand for professional 

 self-help and reference books like jewellery design, fashion 

 design, architecture and interiors, advertising and design,? 

 remarked Sidharth Pansari of the Elgin Road store.

 The other titles that fared well 

 at Crossword were Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, 

 Are You Afraid Of The Dark by Sidney Sheldon and 

 The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho, besides the Harry 

 Potter books, Eragon and The Curious Incident 

 of the Dog in the Night-time.

 Landmark, which recorded a 15 

 per cent growth in sales over last year, reported good movement 

 of PlayStation II CDs as well. ?Asterix and Tintin books 

 were also reintroduced and we have been running out of stocks 

 every 20-30 days. Then of course, there was Pokemon, which 

 was the craze all year round, kicking off with annuals and 

 digests and then exploding into a whole array of related 

 merchandising,? said Jatia.

 MusicWorld even reported an ?all-time 

 high? sales of Bengali music ? 1,46,000 units (cassettes 

 and CDs combined) compared to 1,29,000 in the previous year. 

 The sales graph of Rabindrasangeet, an eternal favourite 

 of Bengalis, was up 30 per cent to 57,000.

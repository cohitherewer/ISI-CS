 Lawyers force circular withdraw

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Agitation by city lawyers has prompted Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar of Calcutta High Court to withdraw his decision to send a large number of cases pending in four subordinate courts ? Alipore, City Civil and Sessions?, Sealdah and Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrates? Courts ? to the permanent lok adalat.

 The lawyers started their movement after the high court administration directed the judges of the subordinate courts to send long-pending cases to the newly-formed permanent lok adalat for immediate disposal. According to the agitating lawyers, the cases were sent to the lok adalat without the permission of either the petitioner or the respondent.

 ?This was in contradiction of the existing law. We have said only those cases where both parties (respondent and petitioner) agree can be sent to the lok adalat,? said Saradendu Biswas, former president of West Bengal Lawyers Association.

 The lawyers of the four courts agitated throughout last week, demanding immediate withdrawal of the circular. Work at Sealdah and Alipore courts virtually came to a standstill during this period. 

 On Saturday, many litigants, who had come from afar, found the courts closed. ?The lawyers? agitation has ensured only one thing ? delayed justice,? said Arup Sarbadhikari, a resident of Bansberia, in North 24-Parganas.

 On Saturday, the revised notification of the Calcutta High Court administration reached the agitating lawyers. The new circular was issued by Tapan Mukherjee, registrar-general of Calcutta High Court, to the heads of the four courts. 

 Mukherjee asked the judges to verify if both parties agreed to the transfer of pending cases to the permanent lok adalat.

 Different lawyers? organisations appreciated the move of Calcutta High Court, and expressed their feelings to Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar. 

 ?Senior lawyers of the city met Chief Justice Sirpurkar yesterday and requested him to withdraw the circular asking the district judges to send all pending matters to the permanent lok adalat. They claimed that Article 89 of the IPC and 20 of the Legal Aid Services Authority Act do not allow the district judges to send all the matters to the lok adalat,? Uttam Majumdar, general secretary of West Bengal Lawyers Association, said.

 According to a state judicial affairs ministry source, there are 5.5 lakh cases pending in the subordinate courts. While the Centre was stressing the need to set up fast-track courts for speedy disposal of cases, the state government was taking a different view in the matter.

 ?The state government was thinking of disposing of pending cases through the permanent lok adalat. The high court administration, too, approved of the idea and, subsequently, issued the circular,? the source said.

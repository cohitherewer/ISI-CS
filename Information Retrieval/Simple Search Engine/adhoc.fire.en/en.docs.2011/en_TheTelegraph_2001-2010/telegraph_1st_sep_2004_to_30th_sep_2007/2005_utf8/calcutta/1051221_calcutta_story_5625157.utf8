The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The traffic situation on Lord Sinha Road worsens during the morning rush hours when police and army vehicles enter the road from the wrong side. With one-third of the road taken up by parked vehicles, there is just enough space for a big bus to pass through. Another heavy vehicle coming from the opposite direction completely clogs the road. A few days ago, I witnessed a similar situation when an army truck entered the road flouting the one-way bar. It could have been justified if it had been an emergency. But this is a regular problem. Why should the police and the army be let off for rule-break?

 Lower Rawdon Street. 

 The Sadananda Road-Rashbehari Avenue intersection often remains unmanned in the mornings and evenings. It is a stone?s throw away from the Tollygunge police station. The crossing is a busy one and demands greater attention from the traffic police to avoid mishaps.

 On several occasions, I have noticed that a dye is used to give vegetables a fresh look. As it is, the excessive use of pesticides has decreased the nutrition content of seasonal vegetables. In the long run, these contaminated vegetables may result in serious ailments among consumers. The state should conduct regular quality checks at wholesale vegetable markets in the city to curb this practice. 

 B. N. Bose,

 Dum Dum.

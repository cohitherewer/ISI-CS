 Set-top service pushes channel bonanza

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 July 2003: Conditional access system (CAS) and set-top box are the buzzwords as the Centre tries to make the cable and satellite industry transparent and viewer-friendly.

 July 2005: CAS has failed to take off, but the set-top box is suddenly back in the news.

 Two of the three multi-system operators (MSO) in town are launching services that will utilise set-top boxes to offer both existing popular channels in digital format ? in better audio and video quality than the existing analogue mode ? and premier international channels available only through the box.

 SitiCable, the largest MSO servicing around 55 per cent of the CMDA area cable homes, is kicking off the process on July 15, adding 75 channels to the 85 it currently provides to its subscribers.

 ?The additional channels will cater to the more niche viewers, while some of the existing channels will be available in digital quality,? said a spokesperson for Indian Cable Net, a unit under SitiCable. ?Viewers will be able to understand the difference in quality immediately.?

 The MSO will tap group resources to offer a large chunk of the channels available on Zee?s direct-to-home platform.

 Though the bouquet on offer will initially comprise only free-to-air channels, it could be ?the first step? towards providing value-added services and exclusive channels.

 ?By next month, we will offer five channels of various genres that can be accessed only through the set-top boxes. The number will go up in the coming months.?

 The boxes can be rented for Rs 50 a month, with Rs 1,000 as deposit, from the local cable operator. They can also be purchased for around Rs 2,500. ?We would be able to supply 70,000 boxes,? the spokesperson claimed.

 To popularise the service, SitiCable is asking its operators to air promos on their local video channel.

 CableComm, which has around 15 per cent market share, is also testing waters by routing some popular channels through the set-top box.

 ?We will soon launch set-top box purchase and rental schemes with the aim of creating enthusiasm among subscribers,? a CableComm spokesperson said.

 The MSO plans to offer ?at least five? exclusive channels through the box by the end of the month. 

 These will include international versions of popular music and news channels, and movie channels. 

 Besides promotions through cable operators, CableComm will carry out area-wise drives on its own as well.

 The third MSO, Manthan, is also gearing up with its digital offering. ?We plan to start the service by September,? said a Manthan director.

If you thought you?ll have to wait till next year 

to do the late night grind in style again, check out the fusion fare at the Kenilworth.

Tune in to the Bulgarian band ERA at Big Ben and then 

cap it off with some sizzling Indian khana at Sanjha Chulha donning a dhaba 

theme on Saturdays.

ERA?s repertoire in Calcutta includes everything from 

Bryan Adams and Celine Dion to Abba, Boney M and Cliff Richard, depending on the 

mood of the crowd.

The Bulgarian band can sing in Spanish as well and 

has toured widely in countries like Oman, Dubai and Australia. Destination next: 

Nepal. 

?We request people to come and hear our beautiful 

music. We have a new song list for each day of our stay here till January 15,? 

promised Krassimir Vassilev, a member of the band.

And after your fill of the soul food at the pub, you 

can top your Saturday night sojourn at Sanjha Chulha that is serving dhaba-style 

grub in elaborate thalis offering a wholesome fare of tandoori roti, 

kebab, daal makhani, one quarter of a tandoori chicken, masala 

chai and kulfi.

There are vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, with 

the veg thali priced at Rs 130 and the non-veg at Rs 150.

Horse power

Killer stilettos kicked off the fun on Friday evening 

before hooves kick up dust at the Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes on January 9 

at Royal Calcutta Turf Club. 

?It is a traditional practice to throw a party before 

the Derby takes place. It is on this occasion that the club announces the details 

of the race and unveils the cup,? said Boman Parekh, club secretary. 

The horses would be vying for the biggest prize money 

of Rs 3 lakh on Sunday.

The first Derby in Calcutta was held in the year 1842 

but it was granted official status only in 1959 when a horse called Wiseman had 

won the race. 

Cut to the present, and the vast members? enclosure 

at the club was the seat of all action with members and their guests having a 

blast to DJ Austin?s beats.

Add to it singer Tritha Sinha?s renditions of Bin 

tere sanam and Mama mia and revellers seemed keen to carry on till 

the horses were to take the tracks.

Amid all the partying, a thought was spared for the 

tsunami victims and a donation of Rs 2,50,000 was announced for the cause.

Toy story

Post-Christmas, a couple of lucky kids encountered 

a lady Santa in actress June at Shoppers? Stop on Saturday afternoon. 

Hot Wheels Track set, Barbie inflatable furniture 

and a host of other goodies were in store for the little winners of the Toys Hungama 

Festival, held at the Shoppers? Stop outlets in Forum and City Centre between 

December 16 and January 2.

Organised in association with Hungama TV, the 

fest offered free toys on purchases in multiples of Rs 600 made from the toys? 

section of the store. The winners were decided by a draw of lots. 

Tarun Ranga from Howrah received a Hot Wheels Track 

set as first prize, while the second prize of Barbie inflatable furniture was 

bagged by Shreena Kundu from Southern Avenue. 

Monopoly Board Games and Wizard Boy of Harry Potter 

were among the consolation prizes for kids who did not make it to the prized list.

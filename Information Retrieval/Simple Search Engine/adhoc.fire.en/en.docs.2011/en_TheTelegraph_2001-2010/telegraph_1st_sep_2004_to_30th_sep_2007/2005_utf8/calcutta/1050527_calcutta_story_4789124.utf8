 Hide and seek

 A conscientious artist who wishes to highlight and address issues relevant to our times through his art, Anirban Seth also comes across as a man of exceptional creative talent. Continuous experimentation with the medium of art has led him to master the art of painting on leather, a surface demanding a high degree of expertise and technical perfection for colours to be applied and remain clearly visible. Done by tanning raw hide and then painting on it, Seth uses the tips of his fingers as a brush, smearing colour on leather to create images from life and nature, spirituality and rationality. Often embellishing his art with gold and silver foil, he generates startling visual effects, portraying natural beauty and emotional experiences with equal ease. Seth?s innovations on texture also include batik work and stencilling for embossing and relief effects, creating a unique pictorial language. The ongoing exhibition of his works is a splendid tribute to this painstaking yet immensely pleasing mode of expression in which he excels.

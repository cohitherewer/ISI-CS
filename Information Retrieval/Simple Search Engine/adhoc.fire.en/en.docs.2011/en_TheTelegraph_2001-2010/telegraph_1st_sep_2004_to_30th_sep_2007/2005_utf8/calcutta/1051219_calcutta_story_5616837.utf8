 Drunken driving kills two

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Reckless driving under the influence of alcohol claimed two lives in the city late on Saturday. Both victims, in their mid-30s, were crushed under the wheels of a Sumo on the pavement of CR Avenue, near Girish Park. Two others were seriously injured.

 The driver, Ananda Mandal, has been arrested and the vehicle impounded.

 Police said the mishap occurred after Mandal lost control of the vehicle. ?He mounted on the pavement while taking a turn towards Madan Mohan Chatterjee Lane. After crushing the duo, identified as Arjun Yadav and Bhushan Deo Yadav, the vehicle hit two others and then rammed into a wall,? said an officer of traffic department.

 ?Local residents caught hold of Mandal and found him to be drunk. He was not even in a position to walk,? the officer added.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma said: ?Mandal drove to CR Avenue from Janaki Das Lane. As soon as he took a turn at the crossing of Madan Mohan Chatterjee Lane, the vehicle mounted straight on the pavement where the victims were sleeping. After mowing down the two, the vehicle hit Pramod Yadav and Debu Yadav.?

 Immediately after the incident, a police jeep patrolling CR Avenue arrived on the spot. ?We saw two persons lying on the pavement, their heads smashed. Another two were critically injured in the head and the chest. Both were admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital,? said an officer of Girish Park police station.

 Police conducted a medical test on Mandal.

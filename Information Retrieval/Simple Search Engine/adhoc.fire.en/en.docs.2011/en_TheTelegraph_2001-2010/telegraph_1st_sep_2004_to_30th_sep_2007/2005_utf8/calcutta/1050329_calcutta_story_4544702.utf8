 Tommy Hilfiger today, Tag Heuer tomorrow, Christian Dior the day after? Bits and pieces of Bond Street and Champs Elys?es are trickling into town.

 With shopping trends hauting up, the brand game in Calcutta is graduating to the big league of fashion.

 If Tommy Hilfiger laid store by Elgin Road, starting March 19, a swank boutique of Swiss watch major Tag Heuer is set to sit pretty in the heart of the city before 2005 runs out.

 And there?s more in store as far as exclusive international fashion brand outlets go, with a Christian Dior studio ? no less ? billed to roll in next year.

 Plans to open these high-profile outlets were disclosed by Ravi Thakran, regional managing director, Asia Pacific, of Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) Watch and Jewellery, the global fashion conglomerate that owns both Tag Heuer and Christian Dior.

 ?We have opened Tag Heuer outlets in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chandigarh; the next stop will surely be Calcutta. While that one will come up by this year-end, in 2006 we will focus on opening a Christian Dior boutique here,? Thakran revealed on Monday.

 So, has the Calcutta shopper finally come of age? Of course, protests Thakran.

 Despite the absence of exclusive stores, Calcutta forms ?the second largest market? for Christian Dior in the country, next only to Delhi, and also accounts for ?the maximum sale of women?s watches? for Tag Heuer in India.

 ?Calcutta is a world market and the knowledge and understanding of brands here is far superior to that of Delhi or Mumbai. It?s just that the delivery vehicle is not in place. The Calcutta consumer is ahead of what the market supplies,? feels Thakran.

 That wrong can be set right in a matter of months. A ?happening? mall is likely to be the venue for the Tag Heuer store. 

 ?All Tag Heuer stores flaunt a sporty feel, with Formula One cars thrown around for effect. The Calcutta store will wear the same kind of look,? said Thakran, adding that the company is busy scouting for a suitable venue.

 If sports and lifestyle carry the Tag Heuer d?cor, the Christian Dior store will be done up in white and pink to accentuate the brand?s typical ?feminine feel?.

 While sales figures totted up through multi-brand outlets in the past two years dictates LVMH?s decision to come to Calcutta, Tommy Hilfiger measured the market potential before taking up 3,000 sq ft of prime property.

 ?Calcutta has a lot of well-travelled, cosmopolitan and brand-aware consumers. That we came here after Delhi and Mumbai is because we were looking for a property good enough to be a single standing Tommy store, not because we perceived a difference in demand,? said Darshan Mehta, president of Arvind Brands, that brought Tommy Hilfiger to the country.

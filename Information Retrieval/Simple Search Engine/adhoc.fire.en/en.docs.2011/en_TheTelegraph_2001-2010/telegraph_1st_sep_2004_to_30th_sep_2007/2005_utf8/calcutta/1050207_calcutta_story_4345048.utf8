The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fair ground crawls for want of funds

 SWATI SENGUPTA

Missing: a planned provision for holding fairs in 

the city. Yet, on an average 30 fairs are held here, spanning over 140 days in 

a calendar year and drawing 4.6 million visitors.

 That?s the reason the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government cannot take too lightly the issue of setting up a permanent fair ground off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. And if the permanent fair ground is to come up by 2006, the government better make haste. 

 Realising the urgency with which work of the fair ground needs to be done, the government has urged the Centre to send it money for the purpose. The amount: at least Rs 30 crore, by this financial year.

 The project cost for the first phase of the fair ground?s construction was pegged at Rs 40 crore and the Centre had said the entire amount would be given as grant from its kitty and that of Indian Trade Promotion Council (ITPO), in the ratio of 75:25.

 However, the Centre?s share of Rs 15 crore was yet to arrive, a senior state government officer said on Sunday. 

 So, the government has urged Delhi, in a letter sent last month, that it allot another Rs 10 crore and pass on the remaining Rs 5 crore through the ITPO during this fiscal. 

 The state has also said that the remaining Rs 10 crore ? of the Rs 40 crore required for the project ? can be sent in the next financial year. 

 ?It is rather difficult to start work of the fair ground, Milan Mela, until we start getting the funds. We have asked for the remaining Rs 10 crore to be sent in the next financial year because the government has to exhaust the flow of funds in the current fiscal,? a commerce and industry department official said on Sunday. 

 The trade fair complex is being promoted by the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation Limited (WBTPO), which has been set up by the ITPO, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation Limited (WBIDC) and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 

 The complex will come up on a 17.61 acre plot owned by the civic body. A memorandum of understanding has already been signed for grant of lease for the plot. 

 The foundation stone for the project was laid by the President in February 2004. Landfill at the site has been completed and development work is under way. Now, the government is waiting for the funds to arrive. ?We hope it comes in soon,? the official signed off.

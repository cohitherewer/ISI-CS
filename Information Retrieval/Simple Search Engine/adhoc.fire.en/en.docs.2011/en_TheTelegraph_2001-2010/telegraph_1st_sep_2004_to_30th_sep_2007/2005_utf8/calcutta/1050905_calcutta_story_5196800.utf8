The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timing shift behind stand-off

 Kshirod Bhattacharya: Coexistence of a civic primary school and Calcutta Girls? College on the same compound, in Goaltuli Lane, is creating problems for both institutions.

 The land on which the building stands belongs to the school. As long as Calcutta Girls? College was an evening college there was no problem. The problems started recently, after Calcutta University turned it into a day college.

 The principal of the college has approached me regarding the problems faced by the institution. I will discuss the matter with MP Sudhanshu Sil. Most of the students of the college are from Kidderpore and Ekbalpore. Besides, the college is the only girls? college in the Esplanade area. I will have to choose between primary education and higher education.

 There are three ways open before us ? we can turn down the college?s appeal, merge the school with a nearby primary school or separate the school from the college by constructing a wall.

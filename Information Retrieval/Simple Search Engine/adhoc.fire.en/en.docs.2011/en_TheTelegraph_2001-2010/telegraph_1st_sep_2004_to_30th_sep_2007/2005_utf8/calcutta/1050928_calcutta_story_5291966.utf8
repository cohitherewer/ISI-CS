 Tax revised for houses in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Plot-owners in Salt Lake who have made extensions in their houses in the past seven years will have to pay more tax than the revised rate recommended by the Central Valuation Board (CVB).

 ?The civic tax of these buildings will be reassessed. The CVB will start the process soon,? chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality Biswajiban Majumdar said on Tuesday, after the civic body?s board meeting.

 The revised tax structure was recommended by the CVB in 1998 but it could not be implemented due to legal hurdles. Since then, many houses have been extended, adding to the floor area. 

 Hence, officials explain, arises the the need for an upward revision of the tax rate. At present, there are around 22,000 residential constructions in the township.

 Civic chairman Majumdar said the CVB?s tax notice will be sent to every house in Salt Lake by mid-November. 

 Residents will get two months to appeal for a review, which will then be taken up by the review committee, represented by members of the municipality and the CVB.

 In the next fiscal, the municipality is expecting to rake in a whopping revenue ? an estimated Rs 10 crore (up from Rs 7 crore in 2004-2005) ? in lieu of the revised property tax.

 Had Sector V not been taken away from the civic body?s control, the earnings could have touched Rs 12 crore, officials pointed out.

 The central body representing residents of the township, however, has decided to protest any hike in tax. 

 ?We might move the Supreme Court if there is any change in the present tax bill,? warned Ramen Das, vice-president of Bidhannagar Welfare Association.

 On April 8, 2004, the body had filed a writ petition in Supreme Court against a Calcutta High Court division bench judgment allowing the civic body to collect tax as per the CVB?s assessment.

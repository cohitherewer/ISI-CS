 - RURAL HANDICRAFTS

 Nayan Dutta has been a sculptor for 30 years, lovingly carving idols big and small from stone. The Bankura man can make up to Rs 4,500 per month from his art, if he?s lucky. But he soldiers on with his ?neshar pesha?, spreading his knowledge by training local boys.

 The President?s award-winner of 1988 and 2005 rues the lack of state support and outside funding that is slowly killing the rural handicrafts industry. ?I barely make enough to live by. But I love the work I do. I wish more people could appreciate it,? he laments.

 Dutta?s works are part of a month-long rural handicrafts exhibition, Hastashilpa Unnayan Utsav, organised by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), on at Swabhumi till January 17. The exhibition has stalls with items ranging from dyed flowers to wooden crafts, batik print saris, jute bags, handmade paper, terracotta and pottery products.

 Each stall is a symbol of individual innovation, imagination, enterprise and determination. For, each contains products of an one-person organisation. People like Rina Samaddar, a 15-year veteran of shola work, who took the training years ago because she needed a job. 

 Now she runs Rina Shola Industry in Behrampore. The mother of two has a self-help group for young girls in her area, and travels to places like Orissa, Calcutta and Lucknow to sell her goods as well as conduct training programmes. A gall bladder operation a few months ago hasn?t slowed her down.

 ?This project is for the non-farm sector development in rural areas, aimed at teaching artisans about informal credit, marketing, decision-making and capacity-building. It is also about empowerment of women,? explains Manmohan Sen, assistant general manager, NABARD. 

 ?We are supporting individuals using handicrafts to run self-help groups for the underprivileged. The group eventually becomes self-sufficient, borrowing and lending money within itself. When there is enough income, the group can open a bank account and take loans if required for individual or group enterprises,? he adds.

 Ruma Paul has borrowed the first capital from her mother to fund the Calcutta trip, laden with soft toys made by her students in Naihati. The founder of Rim Toys learnt the trade seven years ago. She now has her own students and is helping market their products, too.

 There?s Bithika Khan from Amtala, Rathin Karmakar from Barasat and many more.

 ?The idea behind this exhibition is to aid self-help groups understand the principles of marketing, like quality, packaging, etc, by giving them exposure to the market,? says K.G. Karmakar, executive director, NABARD. ?We want to make this a permanent scheme, and are looking for an NGO to manage it.?

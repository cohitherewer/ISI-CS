 The city?s roads are repaired on a war footing just a month before Durga puja. But all the efforts and the funds go waste as the patchwork is hardly any match for the downpours in October. The showers turn the roads into what they previously were. I fail to understand why the authorities do the same mistake every year. Instead, the money could be utilised for long-term road repairs during the winter season.

 During puja processions, revellers travelling in trucks and Matadors often burst firecrackers. They light the crackers and then throw them on the roads. Pedestrians may get seriously injured in this process. The traffic police should stop the procession if they find the revellers are unruly and are flouting norms.

 These days many private airlines are coming up with attractive offers. Recently, my daughter approached a budget airline to book a ticket from Guwahati to Calcutta. After adding all taxes and surcharge, the ticket cost her over Rs 3,500, while the airlines had been continuously publicising that the trip costs only Rs 2,750. Frequent flyers might be aware of this practice. But first-timers often fall for the gimmick and end up dissatisfied. Packed food products are also priced way above the maximum retail price on these budget flights.

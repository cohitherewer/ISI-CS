The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ode to immortality

 An amazing zest for life pervades the paintings of Arpita Bhattacharya, a promising young artist who battled courageously with terminal disease for the last 12 years of her life. Lure of the Distant, the ongoing exhibition of her watercolours, provides an insight into the subtleties of a mind that transcended physical adversity to celebrate and rejoice in life. The works of this self-trained artist show an astonishing dedication, passion and personal emotion that find expression through her unique style of painting. A complex interweaving of colours and fluid lines, with an imaginative use of discontinuities, reflects myriad moods and patterns of thought, sometimes sad and poignant, at others joyful and exuberant. With a profound serenity and luminous vision she envisions in her paintings a world of infinite beauty, energy and ecstasy. Her works of art appear to be the steps of a creative journey undertaken to explore and discover the self and, in the process, conquer the limitations of the body and liberate the immortal, undying spirit within.

 Burnt girl in grim battle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The railway officer?s daughter, who suffered third-degree burns on Wednesday night after allegedly trying to commit suicide, is fighting for survival in South Eastern Railway?s BNR Hospital.

 On Friday, hospital sources said the 22-year-old, who had ?wanted to escape from a life of loneliness and frustration?, was in a critical condition. Doctors said she was on drip. 

 The youth, who neighbours said was with the girl in her family apartment in Rail Minar, on Judges? Court Road, is absconding. 

 ?We went to his house in Mominpur but he was not to be found,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

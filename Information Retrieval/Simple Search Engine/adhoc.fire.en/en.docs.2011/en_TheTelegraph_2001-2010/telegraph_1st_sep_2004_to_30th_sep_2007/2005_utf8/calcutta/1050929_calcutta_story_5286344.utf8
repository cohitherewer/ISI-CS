 Create harmony on home canvas 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Installing water fountains in different directions inside homes influences the Chi flow. Placing one on the eastern side of the living room or in the garden with fresh lilies floating in it absorbs the prevalent stagnant energy and livens up the environment. This improves health of the residents. When placed in the north, however, fountains bring in new opportunities

When you are satisfied with all the different aspects of your life, you are in harmony and balance with the whole. But if you have the wish to promote greater abundance in any particular area, then you can go far beyond your present set of situations and abilities by creating what you will.

 Feng Shui believes that your home is your canvas. Make life-affirming changes in your surroundings this Pujas and watch brilliant results manifesting themselves on the bigger scale of your life.

 Health high

 If you are unhealthy and feeling physically exhausted, the other aspirations are of no importance. The east is directly connected with physiological health and vitality of the residents of a house. 

 Open the windows in the east to provide healthy Chi flow. Place plenty of healthy fresh green plants towards the eastern part of the house. Make sure they are in good shape as healthy plants are equivalent to positive energy. 

 Instal an indoor water fountain in the east of the living room or one in the garden with fresh lilies floating in it. Fresh and sparkling energy generated from moving water will absorb the prevailing stagnant energy and liven up the environment with new bright and energetic power. 

 If you are suffering from insomnia try using a few drops of soft aromatic oil of your choice on the pillow for a good nights sleep.

 Marriage matters

 To strengthen your relationship with your partner instal a tall light in the south-west corner of the garden and surround it with plants that have pink, red, mauve or purple flowers. These will help to illuminate and deepen your relationship with your partner. 

 If this is not feasible, personalise and enhance the love corner of the bedroom by placing a cosy picture of both of you along with a token of love and some silk roses in a crystal vase on a red table cloth. Crystal vases are great Chi generators.

 Wealth worries

 If you are not content with your material wealth, illuminate the south-east area with a yellow bulb on silver, gold or a copper fitting that fills the space with wealthy gold light. 

 Beautiful and attractive artefacts act as a magnet for Chi. Create richness in this area by displaying an expensive object dart and by incorporating furnishings that have touches of metallic colours. 

 Paste your photo on top of a high denomination note and mount it on a green or a red background with a rich metal frame and place in your cupboard. 

 Creative call

 If you are an artist, musician or a writer and are having problems in expressing your creativity then move into a room in the west of the house.

 Surround yourself with metal picture frames and use earthen and metallic pieces of art like pots, lamps and sculptures. Bring your imagination to fruition by practising with your musical instruments or paints and brushes by facing east in this part of the house.

 Movement mantra

 If theres something preventing you from moving forward to new things in life, first check if your doorbell works properly. Also, whether the main door opens halfway and with a creaking sound. They definitely call for immediate repairs if you want to move forward and embrace new opportunities in life. 

 Activate the north of your house with a water fountain or an aquarium with water sprinklers inside. Moving water symbolises new opportunities flowing in and fish encourage abundance.

 Friend facts

 Do you have true and genuine friends? Is there somebody in your life who you can confide in or call a true mentor and guide? 

 If not, then the north-west area of your house calls for immediate attention. If this area has immovable furniture or furnishings, modify the situation by adding appropriate accessories. 

 These could be pictures of friends, mentors, angels and fairies. Place metal wind-chimes, crystal mobiles and revolving clocks here to attract fortunate blessings from heaven.

 Peace process

 For a feeling of inner peace and bliss, take a careful look into the north-east corner of each room. It should be clear of any kind of clutter and any kind of heavy and tall furniture. 

 Create a zone of tranquillity in the extreme north-east of the house by placing an image of God and a spiritual book. Light a candle and sit here to meditate and feel in tune with your inner self.

 Tip of the week

 You must consciously acknowledge and understand why you are making all these changes and energising the directions related to your desired aspirations.

 Invoke blessings from Ma Durga for a future full of joy, happiness radiance and splendour.

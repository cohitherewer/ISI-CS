The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dia lights up telly

 The screen switch is getting bigger and better. After Indian Idol was flooded with celebrity judges galore ? Kajol, Juhi Chawla, Priyanka Chopra ? Fame Gurukul, Sony?s latest talent hunt show, has roped in Dia Mirza for one of its first episodes. 

 ?It?s so exciting to be a part of something like this. Fame Gurukul is a lovely mix of reality and talent. I am an atrocious singer myself. So rather than singing, I would judge the way they perform,? Dia told Metro.

 Apart from Dia, the Friday night episode will also feature the first ever video shot with the Fame Gurukul contestants. The 14 have sung the song Aasman ke paar, shot tastefully on the Mud Island beach. As the celebrity judge, Dia will give her reactions and comments to all the performances and will also be instrumental in choosing this week?s four weakest contestants.

 Dia is also on a high in her film career having received a lot of acclaim for her delightful cameo as Gayatri Tantia in the current blockbuster, Parineeta. 

 ?I am really happy everyone loved me in the film. Dus releases this Friday. Then there?s Dil Sachcha Chehra Jhootha and the Sohail Khan film Fight Club.?

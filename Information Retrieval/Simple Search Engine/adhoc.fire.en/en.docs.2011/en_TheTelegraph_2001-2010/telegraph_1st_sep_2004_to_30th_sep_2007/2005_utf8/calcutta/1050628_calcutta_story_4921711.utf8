 Five-star fare in homely surroundings

 Tongue Twister 

 Musician and foodie Nondon Bagchi enjoys the cosy warmth and eclectic menu at The Bistro

 The Bistro at 244A Purna Das Road is the choice for people looking for hygienic, wholesome and often exotic fare at one-third the price of more swanky outlets

 The humble dhaba that has done highway travelling in India proud for decades had its origins as a family enterprise. When the Chinese emigrated in large numbers and took their cuisine all over the world, most of their establishments were single-family affairs. The concept exists in many cultures, and in the Mediterranean regions of Europe, particularly Italy, the same thing happens. We are not talking only of running the business, but of doing all the cooking as well, including the use of homemade materials as much as possible ? making your own breads and pastas, growing your own herbs, even vegetables, and so on. In such a place, there would invariably be a special intimacy between host and guest; conversations would spring up as spontaneously as new dishes might be conjured up as a result of the dialogue and many a fine experience would become possible. 

 Such were the thoughts in the mind of Binnoo Chadha when he set up a small, elegantly designed little restaurant called The Bistro at 244A Purna Das Road. It is a good location, in the heart of a clean and uncluttered residential part of south Calcutta. It looks neat and inviting from the outside; inside there are two levels and the way the designing has economised on space reminds one of the way they do the same thing while designing the interior of a ship.

 The Bistro is not a family enterprise. It is more of a one-man show. But Binnoo does a lot of the cooking himself, always seeking inputs from his guests, coming up with impromptu creations and emphasising on the freshness of the food. Practically nothing is kept pre-prepared in the kitchen and almost all the items are made from scratch, after an order has been placed. Even the menu says: At The Bistro, the meal experience is a very personalised and interactive one. We create as per your suggestion and choice.

 The cuisine is Continental, mainly, with the emphasis on Italian food. However, the starters and snacks section has a few of Calcuttas popular favourites and some interesting surprises as well. Such as the Aloo Vada Sandwich (or Vada Pao) which is aloo vadas sandwiched between slices of bread spread with mint chutney on one side and a garlic red chilli chutney on the other. This is popular in Mumbai and it is nice that The Bistro has thought to keep it in their repertoire. There are momos, Drums of Heaven, Nachos, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and French Fries which need no introduction to the Calcuttans palate and can be found in many places but there are also starters like Mushrooms Stuffed with Chicken and Cheese and Corn and Cheese Croquettes, which are excellent.

 A croquette is a light entr?e made from cooked and finely divided meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, etc., mixed with a binding agent, shaped into cylinders or balls, egg-and-crumb coated and fried. At The Bistro, it is a purely vegetarian item; juicy corn kernels, cheese and cottage cheese, ginger, onion, chopped coriander and various herbs are the ingredients; the binding agent is bread and the croquettes are crumb-fried (no egg involved) to perfection and served with a garlic sauce. You could possible ask for a non-vegetarian version as well. 

 The Bread Corner, which offers mainly sandwiches, a couple of toast items and a couple of on toast items, is impressive and tempting. (All our sandwiches are grilled, and accompanied with a dollop of salad, salsa and chips. We use three slices of bread, cut into six triangles. Our sandwiches are prepared after you place your order). They have a variety of sandwiches with coleslaw ? a salad of grated and finely chopped vegetables in mayonnaise or cream ? which is a personal favourite. There is a Masala Omelette and Mayonnaise Sandwich, a Chicken and Omelette Sandwich and of course the Create Your Own Bistro Special. 

 Coming to the main courses, the menu tells you that We carry on the true Italian tradition of serving home made pastas. Here I would strongly recommend the Lamb Chops ? that will be served with the sauce of your choice and if you leave it to the chef it will be served with a slightly browned and thickened mint sauce, not the traditional one. But the chops are tender and delicious, and are served with potatoes tossed in parsley butter, boiled vegetables, pasta and garlic bread. 

 Other interesting items include the Corn and Spinach Risotto which is not done in the traditional way (where the rice is cooked in stock) but the corn and spinach are cooked separately and then combined with freshly steamed rice. They have Chicken Stroganoff and the classic Bolognaise sauce that they make with minced chicken. 

 The Bistro is one of only about half a dozen places in the city with a menu with such selections normally only available in five-star outlets at three times the price. 

 The only thing that my Bengali soul was looking for but could not find, was preparations with fish or seafood, which Continental cuisine is amazingly rich in. Is Binnoo listening?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CU wrests crown of excellence

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The most coveted tag of the University Grants Commission (UGC) awaits Calcutta University (CU) as it turns 150. 

 Some time next week, the much-criticised university is expected to be crowned a ?centre of excellence?.

 In 2002, the UGC had refused to confer the status on CU. In the words of a university official, ?a structurally-weak presentation that also lacked vision? resulted in the rejection.

 ?We are going to take a decision soon. In fact, the issue is going to be discussed in our meeting on November 18. There are reasons for them (CU staff and students) to feel happy,? acting chairman of the UGC R.S. Pillai told Metro on Tuesday. 

 State education department officials confirmed that CU?s bid for the honour is set to meet with success. ?It would be the perfect gift to the university as it steps into its 150th year,? said one of them.

 Three years ago, Jadavpur University had beaten CU to the title. Jawaharlal Nehru University, Chennai University, Pune University and Hyderabad University were the other institutions that were declared centres of excellence.

 The UGC standing committee had then found CU?s presentation tall on claims and short on substance. All that is past now, with the panel discovering the hidden virtues of one of India?s three oldest universities.

 ?CU made an impact this time because its presentation, unlike in the past, had properly showcased its strengths and potential,? said a member of the standing committee, which oversees the grant of the star status.

 ?Besides, how can one deny the university the honour as it readies to celebrate its 150th year?? he asked.

 According to insiders, the greater say of Bengal in matters central is reflected in the U-turn on CU?s status.

 For the university, a Rs 30-crore bounty will accompany the accolades. The money will be disbursed by the UGC over the next few years for executing projects that would help the university effectively tap its potential.

 ?We hope we are granted the same kind of assistance that previous recipients of the honour have received. The funds will come in handy for addressing inadequacies in certain areas,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of CU.

 The recommendations of the standing committee will be presented when the commission meets on Friday, disclosed sources.

 A senior CU official asserted: ?All the formalities for the grant of the tag to the university are complete. The university has been able to clear the hurdles. What is pending now is the UGC?s final approval.?

 A truck driver and his help were found murdered in their vehicle, parked on Rajdanga Main Road, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, in Kasba, on Wednesday morning.

 Both driver Pradip Singh, 30, and help Vijay Prakash, 22, were from Uttar Pradesh. South 24-Parganas police superintendent S.N. Gupta suspects they were victims of a personal rivalry.

 ?They were murdered somewhere else. The killers later drove the vehicle to the spot,? said Hari Kusumakar, additional superintendent (industrial) South 24-Parganas. ?We have identified the truck owner, who lives in Dankuni. He told us that the vehicle was not supposed to be at Kasba.?

 A month ago, two suppliers of building material were found murdered in the locality. The case is yet to be solved.

 On Wednesday?s murder, police said the truck was parked in the early hours, but the bodies were discovered around 9 am. Some local residents were alarmed seeing blood dripping from the driver?s cabin. They pulled open the cabin?s door and found the bodies, with the throats slit, lying in a pool of blood. The local police station was immediately informed.

 According to police sources, the bodies lay with the heads resting on one another. While Singh was wearing a lungi and a T-shirt, Prakash had on a white shirt and a pair of trousers. Singh?s driving licence was found in the pocket of his T-shirt.

 Residents said they did not suspect anything seeing the truck parked on the road, as several buildings are coming up in the area and parked trucks laden with construction material are a common sight there.

 ?I spotted the truck parked opposite my house around 6 am. It was not there when I went to bed late on Tuesday. I walked past it, but did not sense anything amiss,? said Sumita Nandan, who lives at R/3/5, Rajdanga Main Road.

 Around 9.15, she stepped out again on hearing a commotion and saw some of her neighbours gathered around the vehicle. ?I was told that two men were found murdered inside,? Sumita added.

 Sabita Rani, another local resident, said: ?Rickshaw-pullers noticed the truck while it was being parked beside an empty plot. No one took note of it.?

 After a preliminary investigation, the bodies were taken to Mominpur morgue for post-mortem. The truck has been impounded.

 According to police sources, the vehicle bore the mark of a transport association in Babughat, but came from outside the city. It carried sand to be delivered to some construction sites in Calcutta.

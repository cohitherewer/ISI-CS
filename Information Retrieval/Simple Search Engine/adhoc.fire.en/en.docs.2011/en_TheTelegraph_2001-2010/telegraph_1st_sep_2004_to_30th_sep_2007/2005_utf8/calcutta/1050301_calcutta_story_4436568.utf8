 Gunjan in twin grill custody 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Seven months after the murder of Biswajit Dey, Gunjan Ghosh, who had masterminded the Roma Jhawar abduction, was taken into police custody on Monday. 

 Police hold him to be one of the prime accused in the case. For the next seven days that Ghosh will be in police custody, detectives will grill him on his exact role in the murder of Dey, his one-time business partner. In between, detectives from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will question him on Arvind Bhai?s murder.

 A resident of Gagan Sarkar Road, in the Narkeldanga police station area, Dey went missing from July 4 last year. His body was found wrapped in a plastic sheet beside Narkeldanga canal the next day. 

 Even though Dey was last seen with Gunjan, he was not arrested. On July 5, police grilled him for hours and later released him. Dey?s brother Amal and wife Sonali raised doubts about the cops? role.

 ?Now that we have him in our custody, we would like to get the truth out of him,? said Javed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police. 

 Ghosh was produced at the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Sealdah, in the afternoon, much to the surprise of his accomplices in the abduction, Guddu and Munna. Till then, the latter were of the impression that he would be produced along with them at Alipore court. 

 Even Gunjan?s wife Rumela was caught unawares. Having waited for over two-and-a-half hours with a briefcase containing Gunjan?s clothes, Rumela was shattered when CID officers said Gunjan would be produced in a different court. Guddu and Munna were later produced and remanded in police custody till March 5. 

 Justifying the demand for police custody, the CID claimed that Gunjan?s driver Mukesh Singh told them that Gunjan had handed over two firearms to Guddu, the owner of the garage where Roma was kept after she was kidnapped.

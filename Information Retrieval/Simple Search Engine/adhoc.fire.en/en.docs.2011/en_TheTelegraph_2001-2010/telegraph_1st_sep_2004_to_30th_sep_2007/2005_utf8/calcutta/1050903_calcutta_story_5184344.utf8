 The woman in black

 The Bengali adaptation of a play by Susan Hill, Shey has all the ingredients of a mystery-thriller. It begins on an ominous note with the death of Alice Drablow, who lived alone in an old and desolate mansion. Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor in a legal firm, is then ordered to attend her funeral and sort the dead lady?s inheritance papers. A typical city-bred young man, he is naturally reluctant to visit the remote, rural district where Mrs Drablow lived and is filled with a sense of unease within its unfamiliar surroundings. He is all the more disturbed when he glimpses a young woman with a wasted face, dressed in black, at the funeral. When he asks the locals about her identity, he receives no answers. Rather, they even refuse to acknowledge her existence. Puzzled by their attitude and, at the same time, curious to know her identity, he can do nothing but wait until he sees her again. The play reaches its climax when he does meet her eventually, and she reveals to him her real identity and her terrible purpose. Direction: Saswati Biswas.

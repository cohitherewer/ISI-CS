 Busy bee needs a break

 I need a break.? Two three-day shows on different channels a week, stage performances in and out of the country, product promotions, event compering and special appearances notwithstanding, it?s a rare admission from busy bee Mandira Bedi.

 But her schedule has finally caught up with her ? more so with her voice.

 ?My throat is in a bad shape and it?s not getting any rest,? whispers the sport who first breezed through town on Wednesday for a round at the Infocom CXO Golf 2005. She was back on Friday to cheer the Indian women?s cricket team ? she?s the unofficial brand ambassador ? to victory over England in their final One-Day International at Eden Gardens.

 Sporting event and social cause apart ? she?s also waiting for the integration of the Indian women?s cricket body with the men?s ? Mandira has been busy with lots of other things.

 Sony?s Fame Gurukul finished with a flourish a while back and her Dial One Aur Jeeto game show on Sahara One is set to drop the curtains in January.

 She has also just celebrated the silver jubilee of her play Anything But Love with a performance in Dubai and is currently shooting for her next feature film, Marathon.

 But it?s her appearance in Sony?s next big thing, the Indian version of the game show Fear Factor, that has Mandira most excited.

 ?It was an amazing experience,? her eyes light up as she recounts the scares and thrills of some of the challenges she had to take on during the shoot in Malaysia recently.

 Her next outing on the big screen ? after a not-so-impressive Shaadi Ka Laddoo ? should find her in a ?meaty role? but in a ?non-commercial? movie.

 ?It?s by debutante director Nisha Chainani. She had run the half-marathon, which made her think of the different reasons why people run marathons ? the herd mentality, the zeal to excel, the feel-good factor and more.?

 The movie has five parallel stories running and stars Bikram Saluja, Purab Kohli and Samir Dattani.

 Mandira plays a housewife who only lives for her family. ?Something happens to her and she starts thinking that it?s time she lived a little for herself. As the first step, she signs up for the marathon.?

 With shooting scheduled to wind up by January, the release date is slated for March.

 She next returns to her city of birth ? Calcutta, of course ? with Anything But Love on January 26. 

 But before that, it will be a long vacation with hubby Raj Kaushal in Singapore later this month for some much-needed rest.

 ?It will be complete maunvrat for a few weeks,? assures Mandira, while picking up a arload of sandesh before rushing off to the airport on Friday.

 Ragas to jazz, santoor to piano... The city is ready to be swept by a confluence of eastern and western music through the month of December, starting mid-week. With a nip in the air, there?s nothing better than an evening of soulful strains from far and near.

 First up in the Hindusthani classical section is the 29th Gunidas Sangeet Sammelan at GD Birla Sabhagar on December 16 and 17. Day One features vocalist Subha Mudgal and Pandit Satish Vyas on the santoor. Vyas will be accompanied by Kumar Bose on the tabla. The second day of the Sammelan will have Pandit Viswa Mohan Bhatt on mohanveena and vocals by Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar.

 Nearer month-end, a novel concert to mark Pandit Vijay Kichlu?s 75th birthday has been planned by the vocalist?s friends and disciples. The soiree slated for December 23 at GD Birla Sabhagar features vocalist Girija Devi, santoor exponent Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma, tabla exponent Kishan Maharaj and kathak maestro Birju Maharaj.

 For a change, Birju Maharaj, who is also an accomplished singer, will desert the dance floor and join Girija Devi for thumri recitals. They will be accompanied by Kishan Maharaj on the tabla. A santoor recital by Shiv Kumar Sharma will precede the performance.

 ?My association with the four musicians goes back a long way and it?s very inspiring. I have known Kishan Maharaj since 1945 and Girija Devi since 1946-47. Birju Maharaj stayed with me in Calcutta in 1956 and Shivji has been the closest to me in Mumbai,? said Kichlu, who will launch a series of educational CDs for classical music students on the occasion.

 This winter?s western classical section is an eclectic mix of everything from baroque to jazz. The French Association hosts Musique Baroque En Inde at Kala Kunj in Kala Mandir on December 15. 

 The concert features Italian baroque, with Thierry Gregoire as counter tenor and Estelle Kaique as mezzo soprano.

 On December 16, Calcutta School of Music will play host to city boy Raja Halder, a violonist, and his accompanist James Willshire on the piano. After a stint at Chatham?s School of Music in Manchester, Halder is doing his B.Mus at Royal Academy of Music in London. Willshire began his musical journey at age nine and has performed in the UK, France, Spain, Ukraine and Russia as a recitalist and soloist.

 On December 17, a Blues and Jazz concert organised by Open Doors is scheduled to make waves at the CC amp;FC poolside. The singers are Anjum Katyal and Isheeta Ganguly, with the back-up team comprising Nondon Bagchi on drums, Sumit Ramachandra on guitar and Willy Walters on bass guitar.

 Treasure trove, Tinas pick

 The frontage of the minuscule boutique, located at one corner of the Lansdowne-Manoharpukur Road crossing, is no pointer to the treasures stashed inside.

 Saris, glittering with sequins and gold thread, are piled on the ground in rows, while many more hang in array from above. Bearing price tags of Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000, the saris weigh anything between three and 10 kg.

 After all, Sonia Bhartias forte is heavy bridal wear ? turning nine yards of flimsy georgette into a stunning sari with rich embellishments.

 And the cosy boutique, Pakkhi, in south Calcutta, belies the massive operation Sonia runs at her factory in Tiljala, with a group of 50 kaarigars devoted to hand embroidery alone.

 Over the past seven years, Sonia has reached out to a varied clientele ? including Tina Ambani and Ustad Zakir Hussain ? from Calcuttans to NRIs and customers in Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, Jaipur and Mumbai.

 Tina Ambani picked up quite a few of my saris from Ensemble in Mumbai, through which I retail. I had a talk with her over phone before she bought a red paisley sari with textures for Rs 23,000 last year. My saris are mainly bought by Marwaris for weddings but Bengalis are also going for such designs for weddings, says Sonia.

 What her customers find special about the designs is the novelty in the layers of texturing.

 The first layer of texturing is done on a white georgette sari with cord or thread work. The cloth is then dyed and textured for the second time with thread or zari work.

 The fabric is often dyed again, which is then embellished with hand embroidery ? both zardosi and arri work ? and with semi-precious stones and sequins, gold threads and brocade.

 The two layers of texturing is done to give the fabric a muted shade so that the hand embroidery stands out. The final product is very heavy because thread work almost entirely covers the base fabric, says Sonia about the technique.

 The petite young woman had started out designing mens kurtas some seven years ago while pursuing a BA degree in political science.

 Mens wear has remained a passion, with Ustad Zakir Hussain being one of her star clients.

 He is very fond of my kurtas. He wears very light shades and so I have given him hues like mint green, beige with very classy and light embroidery, says Sonia.

 Her sherwanis are also based on georgettes with textures, satin and a fusing in between.

 On the more expensive side of her wardrobe is the lehnga ? costing anything between Rs 45,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh ? made only to order.

 The lehngas are more expensive because the entire fabric is covered with thread work, especially in the phulkari (geometrical patterns) style.

 Sonia retails from stores in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Jaipur under the Sonia Bhartia and Pakkhi labels.

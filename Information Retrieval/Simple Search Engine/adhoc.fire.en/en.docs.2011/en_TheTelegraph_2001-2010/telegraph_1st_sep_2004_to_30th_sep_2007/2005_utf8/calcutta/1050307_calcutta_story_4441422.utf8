 When will two-year-old Debolina find a home?

 The tot is a darling of all at Bangur Institute of Neurology, where she plays in the wards and sleeps on the lap of a nurse, perhaps hoping that one day, her parents will come and take her back. 

 Debolina landed at SSKM Hospital on a rainy July afternoon one-and-a-half years ago. 

 She had a congenital deformity in the spine and had also been suffering from hydrocephalous, an ailment that results in water accumulating in the brain.

 ?She had been abandoned and had already spent time in another city hospital. But the doctors there could neither offer her any treatment nor trace her parents. Following a court order, she was sent to SSKM Hospital and finally, to our neurology institute,? recalled neurosurgeon Pulak Deb. 

 Doctors at the institute diagnosed that the kid?s deformity would hamper the growth of her lower limbs. A panel of doctors was set up for her. ?We immediately decided to do a series of investigations and surgeries,? said Deb.

 The girl, consequently, was put through a number of operations on her back and then a shunt-implant surgery to cure her of hydrocephalous. Within months, she started showing encouraging signs of recovery.

 Meanwhile, with every passing week, the tot was becoming the centre of attraction at the hospital. Doctors, nurses and other employees showered their affection on her.

 SSKM superintendent Santanu Tripathi would play with her during his daily rounds. 

 ?One day, I learnt that the nurses had named her Debolina, which, incidentally, is my daughter?s name. They had also rhymed it with Dr Deb, whom the sisters consider a saviour,? Tripathi told Metro.

 Little Debolina often mutters ?Pishi, ami ekhon khelbo (Aunty, I want to play now)? or ?Amake keu ki niye jaabe (Will someone take me from here)??. 

 Having realised that she cannot stay at the hospital forever, Tripathi and other doctors are now looking for a suitable home for the girl. 

 ?Unfortunately, Debolina has no takers. Some of the couples approached by us have expressed inability in adopting a ?spastic? child. We have reasoned with them that the girl has recovered a lot and will recover more, but to no avail,? said a grieving nurse. 

 A week ago, the Juvenile Board said it had made arrangements for Debolina?s stay in a Spastic Society-run home in Bhopal. ?A home official has seen Debolina. If no one from the city comes forward to adopt the girl, she will be sent to Bhopal,? Deb said.

 The superintendent, desperate to keep Debolina in the city, has not given up. 

 ?She speaks Bengali and is at home here. We should not make life more difficult for her by sending her to another state. God willing, someone from the city will adopt Debolina,? Tripathi hoped.

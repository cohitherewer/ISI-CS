Modular mantra

Compact space-saving kitchen units blend 

aesthetics with functionality, says Ipsita Deb

For many, the kitchen is the heart of the home. Think 

scrumptious spreads, midnight meals, constant cups of coffee before those final 

exams ? it all comes back to the kitchen.

And today?s kitchens are more than just cooking cauldrons. 

Modern homemakers, in fact, take extra care to balance functionality with finesse. 

?When I?m cooking, I want to be part of the people 

sitting in the drawing room. I don?t believe in being isolated from others in 

the house ? I want to have the freedom to watch some television, listen to music, 

chat or simply dance within my cooking space,? reveals Rupa Ganguly. The actress 

has created a chic modular open kitchen in her dream house bordering the RCGC 

greens.

With the joint-family system of yesterday giving way 

to compact nuclear homes, finding enough space to store utensils, crockery, appliances, 

spices and what not, without cluttering up the kitchen, is a real challenge.

One of the vital considerations when planning a kitchen 

is to have adequate storage space. For this to be achieved, the best solution 

is a modular kitchen, allowing the purchase of various components and their arrangement 

in the most suitable configuration.

Here?s looking at crafting a kitchen better:

Shape and style

There are many styles of kitchen layout: L-shape, 

U-shape, galley, island-style.

?Whatever the style of the kitchen, the distances 

between the fridge and the stove, the stove and the sink, the sink and the fridge, 

must make up a triangle. Each leg should not be less than 10 ft or more than 25 

ft,? says interior designer Gopa Ray.

?If the sum of the legs in the triangle are too small, 

people will be tripping over each other and if the distance is too much, food 

preparation could turn out to be a very tiring task. U-shaped kitchens ensure 

minimum wastage of energy,? adds Ray. 

so, there are certain standards in kitchen cabinet 

making. Counter height, space allowance between base and upper cabinets, cabinet 

depth, as well as the space required for refrigerators and stoves are specified.

?A larder unit with trays from top to bottom is a 

great option for minimalist yet highly functional storage,? says designer Anita 

Mansatta.

Build basics

Kitchen modules can be broadly classified into the 

carcass, front panel, shelves, gas frame and chimney. Accessories like drawer 

pull-outs, baskets and trays are for storage purposes. Each of these can be found 

in standard sizes, varying from 200 mm to 1,050 mm. Knob designs can also make 

a strong statement.

?In the past four-five years, almost 800 kitchens 

have been sold in Calcutta alone, replacing the age-old custom of a carpenter 

sitting and carving it out. Buying a modular kitchen is an effective option, wherein 

each unit can be dismantled and kept separately. Being termite-proof, fire-resistant 

and water-resistant, and coming in a variety of colours and types, these are great 

options for the modern homeowner,? says Ravi Jhunjhunwala, director of Life--Style 

at Uniworth Centre, on Shakespeare Sarani.

Priced between Rs 33,900 and Rs 90,000, depending 

on the size and parts chosen, these are affordable options that can be relocated 

as and when needed.

In terms of materials for kitchen built-ins and surfaces, 

the most popular choice today appears to be wood. Those with minimalism in mind, 

however, opt for stainless steel and frosted glass. 

Lighting laws

Light colour or natural wood cabinets tend to brighten 

up and visually enlarge a space. While a large ceiling fixture, equipped with 

energy-efficient fluorescent tubes will supply plenty of well-diffused general 

lighting, it may leave you working in your own shadow at the sink.

?A wooden grid with a frosted glass cover, giving 

the appearance of a false ceiling is a good idea, as is supplemental task lighting 

to avoid the shadow trap. Cabinet lighting can be accentuated by placing low-voltage 

mini-lights over, under, or inside cabinets,? says Anita Mansatta.

 One or two track lights over the sink will give you 

the illumination you need for washing dishes and scouring pots and pans.

Feng Shui facts

?In Feng Shui, the kitchen represents nourishment 

and prosperity ? after all, it is human nature to associate food and nutrition 

with nurturing and sustenance,? says expert Pinky Kapoor.

The kitchen is both a fire and water room and they 

must be separated. Kapoor insists the stove must be placed on the eastern side 

and water kept on the northern.

?Since kitchens have a lot of metallic utensils, care 

must be taken to ensure that it is balanced with greenery in the form of plants 

and flowers to promote a healthy environment,? she adds.

so, the stove should never face the door as this will 

result in drainage of health and wealth, warns Feng Shui. Cooking, facing the 

east, brings in the good health.

 Good kitchen colours are white, light green and blue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pumping station in south city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nearing the end of his first term, mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s last bid to alleviate the sufferings of about 10,000 families in south Calcutta?s most waterlogging-prone area is a Rs 15-crore drainage lifting station at Ganja Park (Dwarkanath Mitra Square), in Bhowanipore.

 ?I have sanctioned the project with financial allocation, and the work will start soon,? mayor Mukherjee said on Friday. The station will pump out the accumulated water into Tolly?s Nullah.

 Residents of Justice Chandra Madhab Road, Dwarkanath Road, Rajendra Road, Heysham Road and Ram Mohan Datta Road will benefit from the project. Post-heavy showers, though the main roads remain dry, most houses in the bylanes are marooned. Ground floors in ankle-deep water are a common sight.

 According to local councillor Aparna Neogy, who is also the Trinamul Congress chief whip in the Corporation, over 2,000 families living in the area bound by AJC Bose Road, Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, Puddapukur Road and Sarat Bose Road suffer severely due to the bowl-shaped topography of the pocket. 

 Justice Chandra Madhab Road and Heysham Road usually remain waterlogged for at least 48 hours more than any other part of the city.

 ?It will really be a gift to us. Our bathrooms on the ground floor often overflow when the area is waterlogged,? said Bratati Chaudhury, a local resident. The lifting pumping station was long due, agreed Mala Roy, mayoral council member (drainage and sewerage).

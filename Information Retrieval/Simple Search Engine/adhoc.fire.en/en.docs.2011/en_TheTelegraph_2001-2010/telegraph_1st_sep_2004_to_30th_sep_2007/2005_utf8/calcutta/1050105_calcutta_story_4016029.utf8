Jacket jazz in winter fashion

Whether its boardroom brainstorming 

or simple socialising, blazers help you make an impact on any occasion. Zeeshan 

Jawed hunts out the styles on offer at city stores

Hanging around in a pair of jeans, T-shirt and tons 

of attitude might get you through college, but once you are out of it, dressing 

up becomes serious business.

While most offices have a semi-formal dress code, 

plenty of winter parties and weddings demand men to be well turned out. And there 

is no better way to do this than by wearing a blazer.

?When you are working for a company you become a brand 

ambassador, so dressing well becomes very important,? points out Tathagata Sengupta, 

officer, customer care, ABN Amro Bank.

For those taking the blazer-purchase plunge, keep 

in mind that a high-end brand may come with a hefty price tag, but it also gives 

you a guarantee on quality. If you have a limited use for winter wear, go for 

a classic design that will stand by you for a few seasons without becoming dated.

Formal feel

The formal blazer never goes out of fashion. Whether 

it is for boardroom brainstorming or simple socialising, blazers lend style, sophistication 

and at least an air of success. If it is a formal meeting, nothing can be more 

prim than a two-buttoned blazer. The three-buttoned variety is less formal. 

The Calcutta chill can easily be countered with a 

terry wool coat but if you are particularly afraid of the winter fury, you can 

select the pure wool variety. Then, try experimenting with the designs. There 

are diagonal, vertical and horizontal stripes and solids in interesting weaves.

But it is the checks that are happening this season. 

?We have registered good sales of blazers with checks. The Park Avenue ones come 

with both small and broad checks,? says Bimal Soni, store manager of the Rabindra 

Sarani Raymond shop. Manzoni (part of the Raymond portfolio) and Blackberrys in 

Forum are good haunts for formal blazers. They are available in shades like blue, 

black, brown and olive. The prices range between Rs 3,795 and Rs 6,999.

Casual code

To stand out in the crowd, try on some designer jackets 

instead. ?Jackets give variety and choice. You can wear them to office or team 

them up with jeans and hit the disco. Tweed in particular goes very well with 

all types of suits,? feels Shanker Kaul, a businessman.

Jackets come in bright hues of green, red, blue and 

olive and can be plain, striped or may even have abstract prints. Some come with 

high collars too. Check out the Park Avenue, Arrow and Blackberrys ranges, priced 

between Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,000.

Cool corduroy

Corduroy is back in fashion and it?s time to make 

the most of this fabulous fabric. The water-resistant variety, made from a cotton 

blend, can protect you from light showers and strong winds, as well as provide 

warmth. 

With sport-coat styling, these jackets are perfect 

when teamed with denim or khakis. Due to the bright colours and rough texture 

these jackets can also be worn at a club do or an informal office gathering. 

Available in sporty colours like mustard, tan, brown 

and blue, they brighten up the autumn evenings. These jackets are available at 

exclusive Arrow and Park Avenue outlets. They are also on offer at leading multi-brand 

outlets under the same labels. They are priced between Rs 2,495 and Rs 2,995.

Canvas call

Canvas is another happening fabric this season. Look 

out for heavy enzyme-washed jackets in canvas, lined with fleece to give the rugged 

material cosy comfort. 

?Not only is fleece one of nature?s most efficient 

insulators, it is very trendy. So it serves the dual purpose of making a style 

statement and keeping you warm,? says Janak Dave of Arrow.

A thin lining gives the jacket a light, comfortable, 

slim and stylised fit. Check out the canvas jackets at the exclusive Arrow outlets. 

They come in a young palette of khaki, olive and stone, priced between Rs 1,795 

and Rs 2,495.

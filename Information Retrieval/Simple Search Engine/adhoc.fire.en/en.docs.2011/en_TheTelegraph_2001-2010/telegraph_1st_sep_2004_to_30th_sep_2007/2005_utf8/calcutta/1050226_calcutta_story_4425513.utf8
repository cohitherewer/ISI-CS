The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop alert on cell liaisons

 PRONAB MONDAL

 I am single, working in an MNC and seeking friendship from decent guys (not more than 30 years old) from Calcutta. To know more about me, call me on my cell phone?

 With young women joining the hunt for cell pals and often inviting more trouble than friends, police have been forced to sound a note of caution.

 Police records and an investigation by Metro revealed that the friendship gambit for four girls has turned to nightmare in the past week alone. The reason: on the first day of their date, the man in question turned out to be ?a plain cheat or a pervert?.

 Case in point: a 24-year-old schoolteacher who had made a friendship move on the Net.

 ?A person describing himself as a tall, dark and handsome 28-year-old (as I had mentioned in the preference column) contacted me last week,? she recounted.

 ?Last Wednesday, he invited me to Nandan, where I was stunned to find a 35-year-old, short, pot-bellied man waiting for me. He then hailed a cab and requested me to accompany him to a restaurant. He was behaving like a gentleman till then, but in the taxi, he started misbehaving with me. I told the driver to stop and got off,? she added.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department, said on Friday that women, often just after a break-up, were posting personal details, like names and mobile phone numbers, on websites in a desperate ? and dangerous ? bid to connect.

 ?There is no law under which we can stop a woman or man from making such a posting,? said Singh. ?But we would like to caution them that such postings can get a woman into real trouble. We have come across incidents in which women have suffered, as such postings have brought them in touch with unsavoury characters.?

 According to officers of the cyber crime wing of the detective department, the phone-friend trend has caught on in the past year with young girls, mostly from affluent families, posting their numbers and biographical details on popular websites and falling prey to stalkers and goons.

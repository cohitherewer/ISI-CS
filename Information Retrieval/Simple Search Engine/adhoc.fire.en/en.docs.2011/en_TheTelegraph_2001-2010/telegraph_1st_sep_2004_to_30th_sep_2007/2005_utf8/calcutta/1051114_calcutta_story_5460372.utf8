 Its something about that inner radiance and glow that speaks much much more than the dazzling jewels and shining silks on your special day. The design gurus and make-up artistes might work overtime, but the effort gone missing from the to-be brides side can make their magic wands fall flat.

 Rising stress levels coincide with the final countdown, but take a deep breath and relax. Heres the GoodLife guide to prepare you for D-day.

 Body care

 You cannot really attain that body beautiful over the short span of a few weeks, but a little extra care will promise visible results. With special emphasis on finer details like the hands and feet, total body care is a complete must in your pre-wedding regimen. 

 With regular massages, coupled with exfoliation, dry body brushing and a few indulgent spa treatments, you can definitely look forward to a more confident self. 

 Common problems like body odour and bad breath call for immediate attention. Regular teeth cleaning sessions with the dentist apart, beauty expert Ruby Biswas of Saajo suggests brushing teeth with a mixture of table salt, lemon peel paste and a few drops of mustard oil.

 Bathe twice a day to free yourself of body odour. Keep the underarms clean and roll on some deodorant, says Ruby, who conducted a workshop for brides-to-be at Saajo, 40/1-A Bhupen Bose Avenue, recently.

 Since the back is often neglected in the shower, you must make an additional effort to make it spot-free. A good option is to try the therapy offered by Kaya Skin Clinic that cleanses the back of the stubborn dust, grime and sun tan remnants. It also removes traces of acne scars and pigmentation and leaves the back soft and smooth.

 Saira Ali, assistant manager at the Health Club and Salon at Taj Bengal, suggests a body-polishing session using Dead Sea minerals. This Oriental skin-exfoliating massage aids relaxation while revitalising the body, she says.

 A warm mineral clay wrap to eliminate toxins, reduce water retention and boost circulation leaves the skin soft and supple. A steam bath followed by a cold shower and a massage with a mineral moisturiser completes this treatment.

 Threading and waxing specific parts of the body should be timed perfectly. Ruby recommends brides to wax their body a day before the marriage functions begin. This will give time for all the break-outs and rashes to settle down, she advises.

 Current trends point at a pronounced leaning towards permanent hair reduction. Kaya offers Nd: YAG lasers, specially customised for Indian skin, that rapidly stops hair regeneration and renders ineffective the hair follicles ability to produce new hair.

 Another must is a regular foot and hand care routine, followed by professional pedicure and manicure closer to the big day.

 Tension reflects on the tresses very rapidly and hence incorporating a weekly oil massage ritual is a good idea. A pack made of papaya, curd and fullers earth should be applied to the hair. Wash it off after 20 minutes, adds Ruby. 

 Face lift

 The moment pre-wedding jitters hit us, our skin reacts through various breakouts. Attributed mostly to hormonal imbalance, some of the most common problems are sudden dullness of the skin, sporadic outbursts of acne and facial hair, reveals Mrinmoy Mukherjee, head of marketing, Kaya Skin Clinic. 

 Most girls do have a ready skin-care routine to combat this, but times like these call for SOS measures. Visit the dermatologist before things go out of control. 

 A regular cleaning-toning-moisturising routine should never be missed.

 You should try to avoid make-up as often as possible and in case you have to wear it, never go to bed without thoroughly removing every trace. And make it a point to wear sunscreen every day.

 Though we can conceal blemishes with make-up on the wedding day, nothing looks more beautiful than flawless skin. Also, the most luscious and creamy lipsticks wont be able to bail out chapped and dry lips, says Ruby. 

 She recommends regular application of almond oil for chapped lips.

 Another effective remedy is applying crushed rose petals mixed with fresh cream. 

 Inside out

 Eating right is a practice that you should incorporate well in time. With a host of pre-wedding invites lined up in the run up to the final day, its not going to be an easy task though.

 While saying no to all the doting relatives could be mission impossible, you need to distinguish the right kind of food from the wrong. 

 Detoxifying the system is a must to radiate inner glow. Begin the day with three glasses of water, followed by a cup of lemon tea. Consume lots of vegetables and fruits throughout the day, advises Ruby. 

 Keeping the dinner light is also a good option and in case of an outing, balance out by going easy on your insides the next day.

 Saira at Taj Bengal recommends a 60-minute reflexology session to relieve tension and cure latent ailments in the body. Pressure applied to the reflex zones in the feet and hands is extremely stimulating, she says. 

 A complete healthy lifestyle should also include a perky exercise session. If aerobics isnt your kind of fun, try out power yoga. These dynamic moves work miracles to firm and tone the body. Also, the body and mind need to be in tune, so add a few minutes of meditation.

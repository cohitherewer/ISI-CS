The city hosted two entirely different but equally 

interesting events on Tuesday, International Women?s Day.

 One was a celebrity panel discussion at the coffee shop of Sourav?s, while the other was a series of medical presentations on women?s ailments at Eastern Diagnostics on Mirza Galib Street.

 The subject of the chat at the Park Street restaurant was the need for celebrating Women?s Day at all. The consensus of the panelists was that March 8 was occasion for both men and women to spare a thought for women?s issues, which are largely ignored.

 ?Thanks to this day, we are at least sparing a couple of hours talking about what we face every single day of our lives,? said singer Lopamudra Mitra, one of the panelists at Sourav?s.

 Public relations expert Rita Bhimani, actors Chiranjeet Chakrabarti, Satabdi Roy and Swastika Mukherjee and theatre personality Usha Ganguly also agreed that there was a need to celebrate these special days to generate awareness.

 Moderated by small screen actress Kanchana Maitra, the discussion took interesting turns as veteran Usha and the youthful Swastika locked horns on the issue of how women often demean themselves in show business.

 ?A lot of it is the woman?s own fault. Unless she herself agrees to shed her clothes in order to get more work, how can a producer or director force her to do so?? asked Swastika. Usha disagreed, blaming societal pressures. ?They are trapped into it,? she said.

 The only male member on the panel, Chiranjeet, was stumped when Rita pointed out that the actor had said in his otherwise balanced speech that he has ?made his wife the finance minister of his house?. ?Who are you to make her someone in the house,? challenged Rita.

 Satabdi lent her poetry to add a touch of lyricism to the event, while Lopamudra spoke and sang with equal elan. Food for the stomach followed food for thought over a sumptuous buffet lunch.

 At Eastern Diagnostics, the discussion over tea was more to do with womanhood at a physiological level. 

 Three insightful presentations made by doctors Gauri Kumra, Vineeta Kaul and Sushila Sripad took the women in the audience through the series of biological and mental changes that women go through from the ages of 20 to 40 years.

 A presentation on the increasing rate of oral and lung cancer among women arising from smoking was the focus of Sripad?s talk.

 The audience was largely made up of teachers and principals of leading city schools. ?We expect them to pass on information gathered from this seminar to their students,? explained Ritesh Agarwal, director, Eastern Diagnostics.

 Pasta pick

 Moulin Rouge, the restaurant that started out as a hot spot on Park Street in the swinging 60s, is innovating its act with a pasta festival. One can choose from a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian pastas at a live counter.

 ?The ingredients and type of sauce chosen can vary from person to person. To ensure the pasta is according to your taste, we allow you to choose the basic ingredients,? explains executive chef Peter Gomes. 

 Vegetarians have carrots, beans, mushrooms and baby corn to choose from, while non-vegetarians can gorge on chicken, mutton, prawn and fish. 

 A vegetarian platter is priced at Rs 100, while a single-topping plate would cost Rs 120 for non-vegetarians and an additional Rs 20 for multiple toppings.

 Tomato Basil Italian Cheese Sauce, Six Cheese sauce, Tomato Concasse (the chef?s special) and Ginger Chilli Pasta sauce spice things up further.

 The chef also encourages you to cook your own pasta dish, with his expert guidance. A complimentary glass of red wine completes the dining experience.

 The festival is on at the multi-cuisine restaurant till March 13. 

 Spring sales

 Shopaholics have yet another excuse to splurge. The spree is already on in full earnest ahead of Poila Baisakh, that is just around the corner. Folks who prefer to go ethnic on the traditional day can?t afford to miss out the Baisakhi exhibition at Artisana, at 13 Chowringhee Terrace. 

 A biannual feature at the Crafts Council of West Bengal?s retail outlet, the exhibition is aimed at promoting the work of traditional weavers and other artisans throughout the state.

 ?There are so many talented artistes in the districts of Bengal who hardly get a chance to display and sell their products. They suffer from a serious lack of infrastructure and exposure. Our sole aim is to bring them and their craft to the forefront so that they do not perish as unsung heroes,? says Ruby Pal Chowdhury, general secretary and executive director of the Crafts Council. 

 On display at the current exhibition are textiles from traditional weavers and indigo dyers. The range includes a variety of natural dye prints and time-honoured drapes like Uppada, Gadwal, Mangalgiri, Ikkat and Kotah. 

 Kalamkari and Chikankari work also feature prominently in many of the saris along with block prints. Interesting items like mats, junk jewellery, dokra and terracotta artefacts complete the picture. 

 The saris and dress materials are priced between Rs 300 and Rs 10,000, while junk jewellery and other knick-knacks cost anything between Rs 300 and Rs 1,000.

 The exhibition will be on till March 14.

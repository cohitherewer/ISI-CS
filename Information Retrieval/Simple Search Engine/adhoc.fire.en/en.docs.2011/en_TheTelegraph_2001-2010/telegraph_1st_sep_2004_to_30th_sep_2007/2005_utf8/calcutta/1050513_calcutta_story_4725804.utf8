 Minimal summer mantra 

 'Less is more 

 to grapple with the heat and the 

 humidity of the city. I feel very comfortable in casual tees and denims. Sun shades are a must, of course'

 If youve been too busy managing your dupatta and fussing over your layered hairstyle, its time you got a life. Cmon, you got legitimate reason to chill out in summer, so lighten the load and plunge headlong into the pleasures of the season. Yes, summer has more to it than the heat and the humidity ? mangoes, for starters.

 Going minimalist is an idea that should inspire not just while watching lithe bodies making a splash in the blue. Slim is in and moral police be damned, so all you need is a no-nonsense attitude to carry off a no-frills look.

 Sangita Sultania G. Roy tells you how.

 Head start

 For a top-down cooling effect, those tresses need to wait till the next season to reach your neck and shoulders. Bunched up or plaited, long hair has a nagging way of weighing you down. If you arent emotionally attached to this part of your body (mostly frayed or falling anyway!), its time and temperature to think crew cut. If in a lock-horn with your Rapunzel mom on this, remind her of the age-old recipe of a better crop emerging after a close shave (think Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and lots of Water flowing under many a bridge).

 Gear grab

 If you trust our expert advice on the matter, frown upon flounces and frills. Take the minimalism mantra to heart and go for a poker slim look. Capris and turn-up jeans pair better with breathable footwear than full-length bottoms. While you may be tempted to gradually move northwards from here, its best to reserve the coolest micro minis and hot pants for night outs rather than braving the gear during the day on the mean streets of Calcutta. Full-length flared skirts in various avatars continue to make a sexy flutter in the odd breeze.

 inch your prayers for the rain by including spaghettis in your wardrobe featuring the colours of the rainbow. Summers are also a good time to make a funky statement in candy-coloured tees with cool captions ? buttoned-down formals can hang a while. If your air-conditioned workplace still swears by a boring dress code, yank off the sleeves of your kurtas or kurtis, sari blouses or shirts!

 in this weather, be it lounging around at home, or 

 venturing out in the evening'

 Fringe benefits

 Sporting a casual look allows your feet to breathe easy, too. Jute and Osho chappals and open sandals pair best with the above-mentioned gear. If youve been feeling too bare minus the frilly goodies, accessorise with a linen stole or two. These also double as a gamchha when the last of your kerchiefs are soaked in sweat. Complement the look with a chic jhola that can pack in yards of tissue and wet wipes. While you are taking such a swipe, take care unnecessary danglers dont come in the way. Shrink the jewellery and the trinkets to studs for most part in keeping with the spirit of the ensemble. Sun tan lotion is the only commodity allowed in abundance in the scheme of things.

 Minimalism, however, doesnt imply cutting down on glamour. Look down (or up, as the case may be) on sweaty hordes from behind a snazzy pair of sunshades. If the glare doesnt get in your eyes, chances are youll feel less of it. To top it all, don a hat if you can carry it off.

 And if nothing else, do remember to wear your attitude.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stone placed for market makeover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Just 11 weeks before the civic polls, Mamata Banerjee and mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the second phase of the ?re-development? of the 60-year-old Lake Market.

 ?I will keep commissioning work on projects that were launched before the election was announced. Should we stop removing garbage just because the election date has been made public?? Mukherjee asked. 

 He added that renovation of Lansdowne Market was almost complete and that it would be inaugurated soon.

 On the Trinamul Congress leader?s suggestion that the mayor take up a scheme to set up a shopping mall through a joint venture in each of the 141 wards, Mukherjee said renovation of the College Street, Entally and Maniktala markets would start soon. 

 Similar schemes are in the pipeline for 30 other civic markets across the city.

 The single-storeyed Lake Market will be converted into a six-storeyed Lake Mall. The project is likely to be complete by the Pujas 2006. 

 The Rs 20-crore mall is coming up in four blocks (A-D) on a 2.5-bigha plot. It is being developed jointly by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the newly-set-up Venkatesh Foundation on a built-operate-transfer basis. 

 The 500-odd shopkeepers and vendors in Lake Market will be provided space in the swank mall free. 

 Venkatesh Foundation joint director Jiwan Das Mohta said the mall would have around 200,000 sq ft floor space and generate job opportunity for 1,000 people.

 The first three floors will house mega stores, super-stores and hyper-marts.

 The fourth floor will have a food court, restaurants, cafeteria, pool tables, gyms and a play area for children. The fifth and the sixth will house a four-screen multiplex.

 However, Manas Banerjee and Amar Das of the Lake Bazar Samjukta Babsayee Samity are sceptical that the mall could be turned into a reality by the Pujas 2006.

 They said construction of the A block started on August 10, 2003, and and it was unlikely that the other three blocks would be complete within 19 months. They also alleged that the rehabilitation of around 50 fish vendors is yet to be worked out.

 Boy dies in truck getaway

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A truck mowed down a 10-year-old boy near Shyamnagar, on Kalyani Expressway, on Thursday morning. The driver was trying to escape Puja subscription collectors.

 Recently, a policeman had been run over on the same stretch by a truck while he was trying to extort money from the driver.

 Police said the accident on Thursday occurred when Rajib Das, a Class IV student, was returning from his private tutor?s place, along with his aunt.

 Around 9.30 am, the two were waiting near Kaugachhi to cross the expressway, when the group of Puja subscription collectors tried to stop the truck. 

 ?Rajib and his aunt were standing by the side of the road. Suddenly, the truck veered off the road and crushed the boy. The woman had a miraculous escape,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 The police preferred not to comment on the role of the Puja subscription collectors behind the accident.

 Rajib?s maternal uncle, Montu Das, said: ?A few metres up the road from where Rajib and his aunt were standing, a group of local youths were waiting to collect Durga puja subscription. They were moving to the middle of the road to intercept vehicles and collect money from drivers.?

 He added: ?When the youths tried to stop the truck, it swerved and tried to speed past, running over Rajib.?

 CPM?s Kaugachhi local committee secretary Debasish Kar, who witnessed the accident, gave a similar version.

 He said: ?On seeing the youths lined up by the road, the driver of the truck accelerated. The young men moved to the middle of the road to stop the vehicle, but it swerved past them.

 ?In the process of evading the subscription collectors, the driver lost control of the vehicle. He fled with the truck after running over the boy,? Kar added.

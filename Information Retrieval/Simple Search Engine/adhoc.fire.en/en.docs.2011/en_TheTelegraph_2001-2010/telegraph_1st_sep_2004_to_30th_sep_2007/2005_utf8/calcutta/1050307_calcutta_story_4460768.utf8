The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wards that civic progress forgot about

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The city might have extended its boundaries far and wide over the past decade, but a portion of Behala seems destined to remain forever rural.

 Welcome to wards 125 and 126, two of Calcutta?s most under-developed regions, toured by mayor Subrata Mukherjee and mayoral council member Sovan Chatterjee on Saturday morning.

 Time seems to stand still in the area, where the roads are still non-metalled, people live in thatched huts and keep boats tied in the backyards for use during monsoon.

 A mud path winding through paddy fields connects Panirala, Khanpara, Anandanagar and Kshudiram Pally. Any visitor will be excused for thinking he is deep inside pastoral Bengal.

 ?I am amazed that people here have been voting politicians like us into office without getting even the barest minimum civic amenities in return. It is strange that the residents did not boycott elections in the past 20 years,? Mukherjee exclaimed after the visit.

 ?It surprises me that neither the Opposition nor the ruling councillors have ever raised a hue and cry in the civic House over the backwardness of the area,? he added.

 The two wards, originally belonging to Bagpota, Kalagachhia and Joka panchayat II areas, were added to Calcutta Municipal Corporation by the Left Front prior to the civic elections in 1985.

 Civic records reveal that during its 15-year tenure (1985-2000), the CPM-led Left Front spent a paltry sum of Rs 5 lakh for the development of the area. About 17 paise was the per capita annual expenditure on infrastructure development.

 Describing the mayor?s statement as an ?election stunt?, leader of the Opposition Nirmal Mukherjee asked: ?What has he done for those areas during the past four-and-a-half years??

 He added: ?Those areas have remained undeveloped because Subratababu as mayor vowed not to do anything for the development of the added areas. He thought the merger into the civic body of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur was politically motivated.?

 With civic elections around the corner, he said, it is doubtful whether the mayor would find time to carry out development work.

 Moreover, the Opposition leader pointed out, a number of formalities have to be observed before actual disbursement of funds for developmental activities.

 The area, home to about 200,000 people, lacks streetlights, water supply and drainage facilities, in addition to pucca roads.

 The residents still cultivate paddy and vegetables for a living and use bamboo bridges, maintained by the civic body.

 Some of the households keep boats in their courtyard, as the area is submerged during monsoon. 

 Four residents died of snakebite last year, claimed local councillor Shyamadas Roy.

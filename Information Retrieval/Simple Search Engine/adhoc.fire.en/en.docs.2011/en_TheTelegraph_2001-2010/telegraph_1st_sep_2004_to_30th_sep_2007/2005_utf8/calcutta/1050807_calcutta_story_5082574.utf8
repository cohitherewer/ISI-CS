 Working at night and partying right through the day seems to be the mantra adopted by employees of Vishnu Solutions Private Limited (VSPL), a BPO situated on Camac Street. The latest day address for fun is the Ballygunge Circular Road nightclub B.E.D. (bars, entertainment and dining) which the BPO brigade had booked for the whole of Thursday, starting as early as 2.30 in the afternoon.

 Since most of us work all night, keeping this bi-annual party during the day was the only way to ensure we had a great time, says Viral, who also happened to be the event organiser for the bash.

 Such parties help us to de-stress completely, something much needed in a high-stress job like ours. Weve even got a set of team leaders who work hard to strike a balance between work and relaxation, he adds.

 The party started bang on time, and by 4 pm there was barely any place to stand at the nightclub (even more so than a regular night at the disc). Brimming with youngsters, the place was high on energy with the DJs spinning popular, high-voltage tracks. With filmi songs being everybodys favourite choice, numbers like Dekh le, Kajra re, Bin tere sanam, Dus bahane, Woh lamhe and Teri toh were high on the hit list.

 On the sip and bite front, tasty snacks in the form of kebabs and dips and a free flow of beverages, whatever be the preferred choice, was on the table.

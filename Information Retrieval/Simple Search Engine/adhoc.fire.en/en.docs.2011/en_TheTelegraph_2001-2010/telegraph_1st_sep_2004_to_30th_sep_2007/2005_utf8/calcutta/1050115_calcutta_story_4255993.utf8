 Court annuls demolition

 - Heritage house granted new life, Bishop asked to return

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Those who cherish the heritage of the city won a signal victory on Friday.

 Chief Justice Altamas Kabir of the high court finally disposed of the application of Bishop of Calcutta, Reverend P.S.P. Raju, to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) seeking demolition of Bishop House at 51, Chowringhee Road, in its entirety, save the fa?ade, and erecting a multi-storeyed building in its place. 

 The building had originally been listed as a heritage structure by the CMC, although it was subsequently delisted.

 The high court gave the directive on Friday that the building should be graded according to heritage guidelines. 

 Earlier, the NGO People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC) had filed a writ petition before Calcutta High Court against this application. Last year, then Chief Justice Ashok Kumar Mathur issued an interim stay in the case.

 Subsequently, the CMC filed an affidavit to the effect that though earlier, its heritage committee had granted permission to demolish Bishop House, but owing to public pressure and media reports, and since the heritage committee is a public body, it had decided to reconsider the permission.

 On Friday, lawyers on behalf of PUBLIC told Chief Justice Altamas Kabir that under the CMC Act and the West Bengal Heritage Commission Act, the State Heritage Commission?s advice is imperative before a decision is made on the fate of a building earlier listed as a heritage structure. 

 The high court accepted the lawyers? argument and finally disposed of the matter, with a directive that the CMC seek the advice of the West Bengal Heritage Commission on the status of the building. 

 S.N. Mukherjee, V. Banerjee and Tarun Aich appeared on behalf of PUBLIC. Joydeep Kar, Samrat Sen, Soumya Majumdar and Paritosh Sinha appeared for the Bishop.

 Bishop House, with Ionic columns on its facia, was constructed in 1848 by the Church of England as the Lord Bishop?s ?abode?. It has an elegant wooden staircase. 

 Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC asserted: ?We wanted to make sure that listed heritage buildings are not delisted at the CMC?s whims.?

 At the same time, the church has directed Bishop Raju to return to the Chowringhee Road address. 

 The Bishop had left it on the plea that it was in bad shape and had been living at the St John?s Church vicarage.

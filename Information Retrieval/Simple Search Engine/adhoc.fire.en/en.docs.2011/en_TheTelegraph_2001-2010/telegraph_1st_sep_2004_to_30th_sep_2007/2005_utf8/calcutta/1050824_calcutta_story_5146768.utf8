 Fusion, the resto bar at The Golden Park, played host to DJ Suketu on Saturday night. The DJ who rocks night clubs with his remixes of Bin tere sanam and Woh lamhey turned out hit after hit, keeping revellers on the floor till well into Sunday.

 Suketu also played his brand new remix Kya khoob lagti ho, which went down quite well with the party people.

 I chose the song because of its subtle romantic yet peppy feel. I am also involved in a couple of other projects but the priority is to make this song seen and heard everywhere, said the table turner. 

 Besides the current crop of hit Bollywood numbers, DJ Suketu also played out some old favourites like Dil deewana, Keh doon tumhein and Oye oye.

 The newer tracks, of course, included Bin tere sanam, Woh lamhey, Kajra re, Just chill and Dus bahane. 

 Foreign feel

 These are exciting times at Big Ben, with a trio of dancers from Ukraine enthralling revellers. The three sizzling girls belonging to the Alliance Band of Ukraine are performing at the Kenilworth pub from August 19 to September 4.

 We are going to have some event or the other every week. These dancers would entertain our regulars till the first week of September. After that, we would start off with our weekly fashion shows. Once that is over, we would try to come up with some other novel ideas of entertainment, says a spokesperson for the pub.

 The tunes the trio is grooving to includes everything Samba to Latino. The dancers are also trained to move to Bollywood chart toppers like Kajra re and Dus bahane.

 Pitter patter

 Gossip, the restopub in the Unnayan complex, hosted a monsoon medley on Saturday night. Artistes from various bands came together to form a fusion outfit and presented a assorted blend of music. Members of bands like Rudra, Orient Express and Cactus teamed up with vocalist Sayantan and arranger Suvendu to churn out some monsoon medley at the fun address far from the madding crowd.

 Whether it is the quintessential adda or gossip at the neighbourhood pub, music is an integral part of the discussion. We tried to give the regulars a break from the routine and serve up something different. Hence, the monsoon medley, said Arunima Paul, co-owner of the pub in the commercial wing of the Udayan condoville. 

 Moreover, this place is an alternative to the noisy night clubs.

 From ghazal to rock, Bangla folk to Bollywood chartbusters, the makeshift band churned out a variety of music.

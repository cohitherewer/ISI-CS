The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rajarhat showpiece flats sold out

 - Minister rubbishes high-end tag on New Town plot price

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There is no more residential space available in the first phase of Uniworld City, billed as one of the ?biggest? real estate projects in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Bengal.

 Prasoon Mukherjee, director, Bengal Unitech Universal ? a joint venture between Delhi-based Unitech Group and Indonesia-based Universal Success ? made the announcement during the formal unveiling of the Rs 3,000-crore project on Thursday evening. 

 ?The response has been phenomenal. We plan to build around 4,500 flats, of which over 400 will be built in the first phase, and all these flats have already been booked,? declared Mukherjee.

 State housing minister Goutam Deb unveiled the showcase project at Rajarhat, for which, Scottish architecture firm RMJM has been hired by the company. Besides the residential space on 100 acres, the joint-venture company will also build info-space on 50 acres and create over 4.5 million sq ft of IT workplace in five phases.

 ?We had conceived Rajarhat with the objective of decongesting Calcutta and we want to make it a vibrant city. The project was allotted to Bengal Unitech Universal as it was not only the highest bidder, but also came up with a concrete proposal for the first phase,? said Deb, also Hidco chairman.

 Bengal Unitech Universal paid around Rs 300 crore for acquiring land in Rajarhat, which has been projected by the state government as the next IT hub in Bengal. While companies like Wipro, Infosys and TCS have shown interest in acquiring land in Rajarhat, the pricing in New Town ? at over Rs 2 crore per acre ? has been an issue.

 ?We think the pricing is right. Land is allotted in Salt Lake at throwaway prices, but we won?t do that here,? stressed Deb, swatting away allegations from a section of the IT industry of ?unreasonable? pricing of land in New Town. 

 Ajay Chandra, executive director, Unitech and Mukherjee, promoters of the project, agreed and said price of land was not an issue. According to Mukherjee, the entire project will be completed in less than six years. The joint-venture company, which has also expressed interest in setting up a township in Dankuni and a logistics hub on Kona Expressway, will start selling info-space to clients in six months.

 Mukherjee said companies like Gillette, Nike, Airtel and a number of IT firms have already shown interest in Uniworld City.

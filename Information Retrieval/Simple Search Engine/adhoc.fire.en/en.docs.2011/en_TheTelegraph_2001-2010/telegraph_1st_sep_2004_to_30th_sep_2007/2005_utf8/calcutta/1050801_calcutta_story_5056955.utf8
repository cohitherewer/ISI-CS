The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fiji resort, city brain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A $20-million luxury hotel project in a sun-soaked Fijian resort with lagoon-type swimming pool, water-slides, full-fledged spa, banquets and restaurants, shopping arcades and tennis courts? 

 Par for the course on that exotic tourists? paradise, one would tend to think. 

 Till you learn that the premium resort in the South Pacific island nation is being designed by a Calcutta architect. 

 In a proverbial reversal of traffic, city-based architect Harsh Sanon, of Sanon Sen Associates Private Limited, has been assigned to deliver the design solution for a lavish, 270-room hotel in a boutique resort on Nadi Bay, the global tourism magnet in idyllic Fiji. The firm has also bagged the contract for the villas and service apartments to be built subsequently in the resort.

 ?It?s a fantastic break, since no one from Calcutta has ever designed something so big so far. If I do a good job, it could spread the good word about practising architects in the city and might open up a stream of opportunities for them,? the 41-year-old Harsh tells Metro. He has recently returned from a trip to the site in Nadi, Fiji?s tourist capital, to freeze the plans.

 Senior city architect Dulal Mukherjee concurs the Fijian assignment of Sanon Sen Associates could be a ?stepping stone? for the architects? fraternity in Calcutta at large. 

 ?It?s great news that a reputed overseas developer has imposed faith in Calcutta talent to create such an imposing resort. It?s a ray of hope that should inspire all creative minds in our hometown,? he says. 

 The resort is being developed by G.N. Singh, a ?person of Indian origin? (PIO) and a US resident who owns hotels in San Francisco. 

 With a built area of 250,000 sq ft, all the rooms in the plush hotel are sea-facing, with interesting shifts in vista created through undulating ramps. The sea will be brought inside the resort by cutting a channel, and exciting water-themed activities created around it in conjunction with a US-based landscape architect.

 ?It was a happy coincidence and the prestigious project kind of fell into our lap even as we were holidaying in Frisco,? recalls Harsh?s wife Seema, who specialises in interiors and runs the solutions firm Brick By Brick. 

 Singh, who has a Sheraton and a Holiday Inn in San Francisco, was looking for inputs from India, his birthplace, and the Sanons just fitted the bill.

 ?We were earlier contacted by Mr Singh?s project manager?s brother in Calcutta, but never thought they were really serious about commissioning an architect from Calcutta. However, when he looked at some of my work on my laptop in the US, he seemed to like what he saw. Once he explained what he intended to do in Nadi, I had just a few weeks to rustle up a basic plan, which fortunately passed muster,? smiles Harsh.

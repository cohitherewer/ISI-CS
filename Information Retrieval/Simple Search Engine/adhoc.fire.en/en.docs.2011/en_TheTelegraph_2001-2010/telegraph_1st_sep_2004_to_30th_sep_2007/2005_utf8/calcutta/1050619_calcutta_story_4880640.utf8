The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blame it on the billboards

 Despite the crores spent on it, most 

 electoral communication rarely touches the voter

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 As 

 you read this, some of you may be wondering when to cast 

 your vote. Some may have already done their duty. Yet others 

 have possibly concluded: ?What is the point?? Be that as 

 it may, it still is a big day. Calcutta goes to polls today.

 The political parties and their 

 nominees have campaigned over the past few weeks to convince 

 us to take two decisions. In sequence, the first is whether 

 it is worth taking the trouble of a trip to the booth. The 

 second is more complex. They would like us to choose one 

 amongst many unknown contenders. This is difficult. It is 

 like asking us to choose between Barranquilla, Buzios or 

 Bogota as the destination for our next vacation. 

 True, the newspapers and TV channels 

 have been doing their bit. They have informed us about the 

 water supply situation in Tallah or the condition of roads 

 in Tollygunge. The problem is you live in neither. All you 

 want to know is who amongst the three candidates in your 

 locality can solve the problems that you face everyday. 

 No help has been forthcoming on that count. It possibly 

 is too much to expect from the media ? they may be accused 

 of partisan reporting. The candidates themselves and their 

 parties need to carry that onus.

 Electioneering, at any level, 

 is indeed a very serious incarnation of marketing. Eventually, 

 both aim to engineer a certain kind of behaviour from the 

 consumer or the voter. Curiously they are often the same 

 person in real life. The agent that is used to catalyse 

 the change in both cases is communication. Any communication 

 has three distinct elements ? what, how and where. In electioneering, 

 the least complicated is the ?where? part. All available 

 channels of communication, paid and unpaid, are exploited 

 to the hilt. 

 In the current election also they 

 have used up all the available spaces to write their messages. 

 One cannot really fault their effort or enthusiasm. Yet 

 this morning, we are at a loss. We need to pick one from 

 a list. We know very little about them. Especially, about 

 their ability to improve our lot.

 One of the key lessons of marketing 

 is that the consumer is selfish. Answers to questions like 

 ?what am I getting, or what will I be getting?? are the 

 real motivators behind all consumer behaviour. Voters are 

 no different. It is on this count that political marketing 

 is the weakest in this country. The policies and programmes, 

 actions and reactions to the broad issues are seldom translated 

 into voter benefits. 

 It is the content and the style 

 of electoral communication that usually is the culprit. 

 Despite the crores that are spent on it, most electoral 

 communication lacks the idiom of those who look up to the 

 dais. This is why the messages rarely touch the voters. 

 It will be impossible to believe that this shortcoming is 

 not known in the world of politics, after all politicians 

 are more in touch with their consumers than all the managers 

 of Hindustan Levers and Pepsis put together. It is more 

 than likely that this is a missing trick in their bag. 

 They could of course get professional 

 help. Chances are that they consider this a lower order 

 task. More importantly they feel it is infra dig to seek 

 advice on this issue. More so, because it needs to be sought 

 from a profession that is better known for its flashy ties 

 and mid-day cocktails than intellectual aptitude. Till that 

 perception changes, on the Election Day, you and I will 

 be left with this all engulfing cynicism ? does it really 

 matter who wins? 

 Go ahead; chill the beer. No one 

 is stopping you yet.

 Perilous course: A tramcar trundles on 

Apropos the report ?Pester police play cupid?, January 

31, deputy commissioner of police Anuj Sharma?s sermon to his subordinates asking 

them not to be inhuman towards lovers enjoying themselves in the parks is most 

interesting. 

 I think the instruction has a lot to do with increasing revenue by way of entry fee to parks. It cannot be a coincidence that the sudden concern of the police towards couples coincided with the introduction of entry fees at most popular parks. 

 The harassment of couples by police at popular hangouts is not a new phenomenon. For most policemen, it is one of the softest ways to earn money. Thankfully, the method is not as dangerous as letting heavy vehicles enter no-entry zones by taking bribes. 

 Instead of making populist announcements, Sharma needs to rein in and punish his men for extorting money. The problem of police harassment of lovers at parks would automatically solve itself then. 

 Having said that, unscrupulous men and women do pose as couples and perform indecent acts in public. When caught, they pay up rather quickly to avoid further embarrassment. To maintain the sanctity of public parks these people need to caught and punished. 

 So, ideally, both police and people at the parks should be put under the scanner, but it needs to be ensured that no one with honourable intention gets the rough end of the stick.

 Apropos the report ?Trading charges over tram tracks?, February 3, it is a matter of utter bewilderment that the state government and Calcutta Municipal Corporation can engage in a verbal duel to evade the responsibility of repairing tram tracks. 

 People are dying in accidents caused by the bad condition of city roads while the government and civic body are competing to extract political mileage from the issue. One is forced to say that politics has degenerated the people who rule us, otherwise they would not have been able to remain passive spectators to the state of affairs. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee,

Nayapatty Road. 

No one seems to be interested in taking an initiative 

to maintain trams. Instead, our leaders would rather let the tramways infrastructure 

collapse so that they can blame each other and garner votes in the process. 

Huzefa Attarwala, 

Pollock Street. 

The way the civic body and the government are blaming 

each other for the state of the roads with tram tracks is disgraceful, to say 

the least. The jewellers in Bowbazar are within their rights in blaming the authorities 

for business losses. There are many other business houses in the city that are 

suffering losses due to the lackadaisical approach of the people in power. 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road.

The schools in the state should organise a fashion show every year to let the students and teachers know the sartorial preferences of the authorities. While a student was recently expelled from a school for wearing a full-sleeved sweater (School under scan, February 3), a teacher was prevented from taking classes in another school because she was wearing lipstick. The schools should pay attention to improve the academic standard rather than set dress codes. 

Kanish Majumdar, 

Madan Chatterjee Lane. 

Whatever is happening at Augustine?s Public School 

is very sad. The teachers, parents and students should resolve their differences 

through discussion. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

Rakhal Ghosh Lane.

Apropos the report ?Action fast but flawed?, February 5, the abduction of a college girl by dragging her out of her car at gunpoint in broad daylight is shocking. It reflects badly on the efficiency of the state administration and police. People who are in positions of power need to look seriously into this incident to prevent more such abductions. 

M.S. Quraishy,

Suhrawardy Avenue. 

Apropos the report ?Court teeth on online bite?, February 2, it is heartening to note that the high court has ruled that the state government was right in raiding the offices of online lotteries. Online lotteries do not operate in a transparent manner and need to be reined in. 

Rabindra Nath Kar,

Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

Apropos the report ?Test stress steals a march on students?, February 1, it is sad that a section of students is suffering from depression from a very early age. This undesirable situation is a culmination of several factors, including pressure from parents. 

Huzefa Attarwala, 

Pollock Street. 

Apropos the report ?On land, under river?, February 4, perhaps there is a scope to minimise the project cost of the new-age transit system. There is no need to set up a station at Writers? Buildings since it is a walking distance from Jagannath Ghat. 

Jatindranath Bhowmick, 

Kalyani. 

We are surprised to see that our name has been mentioned by a Chetla Club spokesperson who claimed to have consulted us for adapting the statue of Mother Mary as idol of Saraswati (Wisdom trail, wow and weird, February 13). Nobody has consulted us in this regard. 

Rev. John Thomas, 

President, The Bible Society of India. 

I wish to bring to your notice that Mohua Roy who died in tragic circumstances on February 21 was not a student of Loreto School, Convent Road (Chided teen hangs herself, February 23). 

Sr. Teresa McGlinchey,

Loreto Convent, Entally.

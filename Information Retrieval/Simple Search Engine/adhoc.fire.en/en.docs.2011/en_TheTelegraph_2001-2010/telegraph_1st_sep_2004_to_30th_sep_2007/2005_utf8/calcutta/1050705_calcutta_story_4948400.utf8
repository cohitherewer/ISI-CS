Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 While setting up a business project with colleagues, taking into account their animal sign and matching it to yours, in terms of compatibility, is essential as this will lead to profit in the venture

My date of birth is September 11, 1946. I have recently retired from a reputed garment manufacturing company. A few of my colleagues and I want to set up our own business in this field as we all have knowledge of this industry. Which animal signs will I be compatible with?

 Sanjeev

 The Solution: Since you are born in 1946, your animal sign is dog, which is compatible with people belonging to the tiger and horse signs. But the dog is also known to have a secret friendship with the rabbit. I suggest you enter a partnership with people belonging to any of these signs. In case none of your colleagues belong to these groups, you could include the name of your spouse or your colleagues spouse in the partnership papers, if they have more favourable ties. Compatible friends are ram, rabbit and pig, horse, tiger and dog, snake, ox and rooster, dragon, rat and monkey. On the other hand, the following are secret friends: rat and ox, tiger and pig, rabbit and dog, dragon and rooster, snake and monkey, horse and ram.

 Colour call

 I am planning to refurnish my bedroom. The walls will be in the neutral shades and the furnishings, including the curtains, bedsheets, bedspreads and rugs, will be in black and white. Though black and white upholstery is in vogue, I would like to know whether this colour combination is Feng Shui-friendly or not.

 Vipul

 The Solution: Feng Shui believes in an environment that has a perfect balance of elements and colour combinations, which make the surrounding energies harmonious. White and black is a beautiful combination where white represents metal and black signifies water. In the productive cycle, we find that metal produces water, making it a friendly combination. If according to your date of birth the pillars of destiny recommend nourishment from metal and water elements, then it becomes doubly beneficial.

 Desk direction

 My daughter was born on March 3, 1986 and has gone to Bangalore for her graduation. In the room allotted to her, the desk is placed in the north-west corner. Earlier she was sitting in the west facing east, which gave her good results. Is the north-west position auspicious according to Feng Shui?

 Seema Agnihotri

 The Solution: North-west is associated with movement and I never suggest students study in this corner. Students here are mentally and physically restless and cannot concentrate for long. She belongs to the east group, so south-east, east, south and north are good for her. But facing north and studying will be helpful as this is her personal development direction. She should place her desk anywhere in the room, except north-west and face north while studying. For best results, activate the north wall she will face with its ruling element water and supportive element metal.

 Lens leap

 My son is a professional photographer, born on November 21, 1978. As I have no idea about this profession, I am worried about his future. Please suggest tips to help him prosper in life. What are his favourable colours, numbers, elements and directions?

 A.B.

 The Solution: Do not worry about his future because according to the pillars of destiny, he is a weak fire person who needs full support from the wood element. From 2004, he has entered into a yang fire period, which implies he is gaining power and the wheel of fortune has turned in his favour. Ask him to surround himself with an environment that is suggestive of wood and fire elements and their respective colours such as green, red and maroon. He can get his visiting cards printed in these hues. On important assignments, wearing these will give him additional confidence and luck. His Kua number is four and auspicious directions are north, south, east and south-east.

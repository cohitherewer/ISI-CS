 Suicide rerun in Sarobar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A second suicide within 24 hours was reported from Rabindra Sarobar on Friday morning, when police fished out the body of 35-year-old Abhijit Banerjee, an employee of a travel agency.

 On Thursday, police had recovered the body of a 19-year-old college student, Amartya Sarkar. 

 Preliminary investigations revealed that Amartya had left his hostel on the college compound a day before, after appearing for an exam in which he failed to answer most questions.

 Elaborating on Friday?s suicide at the Lakes, deputy commissioner (headquarters) Ranvir Kumar said Banerjee?s body was found floating around 9 am. ?No injury mark was found on it.? 

 Police established his identity after examining the papers found on him and contacted his family members in Bhowanipore. Talking to them, the sleuths suspect that a family dispute had driven Banerjee to kill himself. 

 ?He had been looking depressed for the past week. He left home on Thursday saying he was going to office,? said an officer of Lake police station, quoting the family. ?It seems he entered the Lake area after sunset. He left his shoes on the banks before jumping into the water.?

 Following the twin suicides, police have decided to strengthen vigil around Rabindra Sarobar and another popular waterbody, Subhas Sarobar in Beleghata. 

 ?A number of suicides have been reported from these two places. An 83-year-old woman had killed herself in Rabindra Sarobar. A couple of months ago, the body of a youth was found in Subhas Sarobar,? an officer recalled.

 Police, however, feel preventing suicides is a tough job. ?It is not possible to keep a close eye on every visitor. Besides, most of those who commit suicide come either in the wee hours or late in the evening,? the officer added.

 nThree more: Three other suicides were reported on Friday. Anita Bhattacharya, 32, set herself on fire at her Prince Anwar Shah Road residence. Her husband is unemployed and she had been suffering from several ailments.

 Financial crisis led 22-year-old Debu Mullick to hang himself from the ceiling of his neighbour?s apartment in Mint Colony, Taratala. The friend was out of town. A similar reason drove 32-year-old Sheikh Sahajada, of Ekbalpore, to kill himself.

 Gypsy gems

 Aimed at the multifaceted millennium woman who is young at heart, DiaGold launched its new collection called Boho-Butterfly on September 12 at its City Centre outlet. 

 Timed for the festive season, the collection has been designed by Meenakshi Modi and echoes the international trends of a carefree, gypsy look.

 Beautiful pastoral motifs like vivid jade and quartz-engraved butterflies and floral patterns with gold wires and sparkling diamonds make up the line. On offer are large stone pendants, studded rings, danglers and cascading earrings that make for an eclectic style statement. 

 The collection aims at an unfinished look through the large-scale use of baroque stones straight from the mines of Africa and Brazil. The rough, uncut look of the stones has been tamed with intricate gold and diamond designs. Gemstones used are jade, onyx, rose quartz, lapis lazuli and more.

 Sundae feast

 Mama Mia Gelato, the unique New Alipore dessert stop, has launched a sumptuous spread of gelato sundaes called Mama Mia Creazione.

 On offer are sinfully sweet delicacies like Melting Mudpie and Gelato. The Caffe Italiano is the chefs recommendation for coffee lovers, a concoction of Irish coffee and Tiramisu gelato with nutty praline chunks and coffee sauce.

 Dark Twilight is a minty twilight gelato smothered in hot fudge and overloaded with Belgian chocolate chips, while Bellissimo is a gelato of forest berries and strawberry with wild berry cheese cake chunks, drizzled strawberry sauce and whipped cream. Tropical Trio is tropical French vanilla and melon gelato combined with chunks of kiwi, peach and pineapple, topped with whipped cream and roasted almonds.

 Alltime Mama Mia favourites continue to lure. Take Fererro Rocher Sundaes or Black Forests with its interaction of dark fudge and French vanilla with velvet brownie chunks, cherries and swirls of hot fudge, topped with whipped cream. Chunky Cookies Sundae is a chocolate sundae with choco-chip cookies, crowned with hot fudge and roasted almonds. 

 And if you are feeling guilty about gorging, try out the Sizzling Brownies. They are 100 per cent fat free!

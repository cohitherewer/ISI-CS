 Waiver to fund slum uplift

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities will consider approaching the government for a third round of waiver of the interest and penalty on outstanding property tax ?if only a portion of the proceeds could be spent on slum development and road repairs,? mayor Bikash Bhattacharya said on Friday.

 ?There can be no other reason for seeking another waiver scheme, as bigger the amount collected under it, greater is the loss for the institution,? he explained. 

 His predecessor, Subrata Mukherjee, had got the government to sanction the scheme twice, in 2001 and 2004.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, sources said, will have no problem accepting the mayor?s condition, as an uplift of the slums had been a key campaign plank of the Left Front. The day Bhattacharya took oath as mayor, the chief minister had announced that the civic body would not undertake any project that would affect slum-dwellers.

 There are 4,500 registered slums in the city, in which around two million people live. There are several unregistered slums, too.

 The mayor said uplift of the slums would require several hundred crores of rupees. The civic body must harness its resources to raise the money, but should not impose any extra burden on the middle class and lower middle class. A fresh round of waiver, he explained, must be considered in this context.

 ?Otherwise, there is no reason for exempting the interest and penalty on the outstanding amount. Personally, I am against any clemency for defaulters who have the means to pay tax in time,? he stressed.

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said the previous mayor was allowed the scheme twice on condition that a part of the receipts would be used to pay up civic dues to Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority and CESC. ?But the Trinamul mayor did not keep his promise,? the minister alleged.

 Mukherjee had realised around Rs 280 crore under the scheme, though the outstanding amount was a staggering Rs 1,143.86 crore. Rejecting the argument that the waiver scheme actually caused loss for the civic body, Mukherjee said he had not granted any concession on the tax amount and that many defaulters had felt encouraged to clear their dues.

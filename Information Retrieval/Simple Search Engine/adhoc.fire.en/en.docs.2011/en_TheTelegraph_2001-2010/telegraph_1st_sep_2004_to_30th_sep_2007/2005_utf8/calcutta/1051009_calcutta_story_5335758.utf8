 The wait is finally over. After months of planning and weeks of shop hopping, its at last the time to dress up and flow with the festive tide. As you get set to rock to the revelry rhythm, decked up in your Puja bests, do greet the goddess in style on Saptami morning. All you need to make a statement ? ounces of attitude and oodles of individualism.

 Mix and match is the fashion flavour of the moment, with experimentation being the key to stand out, say fashion designers. But the couture brigade does point out a few musts to make heads turn.

 For GoodLife, designers Agnimitra Paul and Sharbari Dutta dress up models Bidita and Michael in Saptami finery.

 Her

 Since on Ashtami the dress code usually calls for traditional Indian clothes, Saptami is the day women can experiment with western wear, feels Agnimitra.

 The it silhouette of the moment, the long flowing gypsy skirt is the way to go if youre donning western or fusion gear.

 The designer has paired a panelled silk skirt with a brocade halter top with patchwork and coin embellishments, which again are quite hot this season. Ive given Bidita a halter bustier, but one can pair the skirt with just any top. One can also wear the top with a jeans. The idea is to mix and match to suit yourself, she adds. The skirt has been teamed with a broad belt that looks more like a waistband, a current rage.

 The make-up is simple and natural, with the eyes highlighted to match the garment. During Puja, one should go for very natural make-up. The idea should be to highlight either the eyes or the lips, keeping the other subdued, says make-up ace Aniruddha Chakladar, who has done up Biditas face and hair.

 Green eye shadow on the socket, bronze and gold highlight at the centre of the eyelid, black kohl on the lower and upper eye rims and mascara add sparkle to Biditas eyes. Natural blush and soft pink lips complement the eye make-up. Ive straightened her hair and tied it up in two buns on either side with middle parting, as this clean gelled look goes well with westerns, says Aniruddha.

 Him

 Here too, the ethnic appeal should be reserved for Ashtami. Hence, Saptami is the day for fusion. During Puja, men should get out of the strictly western shirt-and-trouser mode and experiment more with Indian wear, says Dutta.

 She has given Michael a Persian look with a kurta paired with loose pyjamas. The raw silk kurta is tied-and-dyed in maroon, black and beige, and embroidered in black with script-like motifs. The black-and-white striped loose pyjamas lends the outfit a Persian touch. The kurta would have looked very mainstream when worn with a churidar or regular pyjama, but this makes the look special, adds the designer.

 A red tie-and-dye dupatta tied as a turban and a pair of mojris enhance the festive feel.

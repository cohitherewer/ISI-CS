The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Past imperfect

 Memories of childhood, often hazy and irregular, are nevertheless potent indicators of adult attitudes to life. Capable of evoking strong emotions and creating deep impressions in our hearts, they determine the way we look at life thereafter. Having witnessed several disturbing incidents during a tumultuous childhood, Janaki, the protagonist of Nakchhabita, returns to her ancestral village to wipe away her trauma and look for answers to questions that have tormented her throughout her life. Now a frail, old woman, she remembers having grown up in an environment ridden with selfishness, hypocrisy and opportunism. She has conflicting, confused and bitter memories of various people around whom her world revolved in the heady days following Independence ? her grandfather, father, step-mother, uncle, a refugee teacher, a brilliant doctor and a tantrik. Though many of them have passed away since, she remains steadfast in her urge to revive the past and, finally, be at peace with herself. Direction: Bibhas Chakraborty.

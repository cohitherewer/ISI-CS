 All for that add-on oomph

 High-heeled leather boots with your pencil skirts, multi-coloured scarves tied round your waist over the denims, skull caps enhancing the beauty of your long straight tresses and chunky leather bags for the final finish ? accessories take a whole new dimension in winter, offering you endless opportunity to experiment with add-on effects.

 GoodLife lists the musts of the season and checks out the latest on the accessory front. 

 Scarf style

 The first thing that comes to mind in winter styling is the scarf, lending itself to a wide variety of fashionable usage. While the scarf is a timeless fashion accessory, its the new twist given to the garment that makes all the difference this winter.

 Says designer Meenakshi Dadoo: Winter is the time to go really high on accessories. Take out the simplest of scarves from your wardrobe and tie them around your waist like belts over your denims or skirts for a sexy look.

 She picks the heavily embellished knitted variety as the in thing this season.

 Designer Preeti Jhawar, too, is all for innovative drapes of scarves and stoles. Winter provides ample scope to play around with scarves and stoles. You can wear them with equal ease over both westerns and ethnics, jazzing up even a simple piece of clothing, says Preeti.

 The fabrics focus is on silk, satin, wool and even cotton. The hot colours for the mornings are lavender, mist blue and pink, while evening dos call for red, orange and black adorned with stones. 

 Cool caps

 Picnics and theme parties are not the only occasions that offer you the chance to don caps and hats. You can flaunt them in full style on any occasion and even make a personal statement with caps during the winter months. 

 The varieties and options are many, just choose the ones that suit you, says Preeti. While buying caps, dont go by trends alone. Choose a cut that goes well with your face structure and flatters it, she suggests.

 For a casual look, you can go for the woollen skull cap that comes in splashes of bright colours or the stylish baggy hat. The more daring can opt for the Victorian-look cloche hat to suit that black party dress, or a cowboy hat. 

 Bag it

 Irrespective of the season, this is one accessory thats a must to complete any look. This winter, the focus is on big bags in funky metallic colours. According to most designers, shine and shimmer in bags is back with a bang. 

 The colour and shape of the bag you are carrying has to be in sync with your outfit. And be careful of the length, try and avoid ones that go below the waistline. I feel that makes a person look fat and quite unsmart, warns designer Malini Ramani.

 The idea is to balance your look by co-ordinating the colour story carefully. If you are wearing light coloured clothes, then carry a multi-coloured bag. And balance loud coloured outfits with a mellow bag, says Preeti. She, however, picks turquoise and green as the hot colours on the bag block.

 A popular style for parties is the sequinned and stone-studded pouch tied around your waist. This looks just amazing. A simple pouch can change the way you look, says Meenakshi. 

 Sole talk

 To step out in style, all you need this season is a pair of high-heeled, long-legged and zippered boots. Nothing like a pair of boots to adorn your feet in winter, both for comfort and style. These go well with denims and skirts alike, feels Malini.

 For the numerous weddings that you have to attend in the next few months, go for glass slippers embellished with stones in jewel colours. These go perfectly well with saris, lehngas and salwar suits.

 A word of caution from Meenakshi: Whatever the style, remember that your shoes have to be high-heeled this season. Flats are out; totally out.

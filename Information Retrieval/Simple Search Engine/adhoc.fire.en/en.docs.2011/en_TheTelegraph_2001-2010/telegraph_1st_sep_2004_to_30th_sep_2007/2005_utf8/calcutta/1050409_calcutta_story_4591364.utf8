Jalisco, a province in Mexico, aptly titled the Mountain 

of Fire, is the sole producer of one of the world?s favourite drinks ? tequila. 

While it is one of the most widely used ingredients in cocktails across the globe, 

what many people don?t know about this party stirrer is that tequila is not just 

of one particular type.

purity level, process of brewing and the ingredients used ? are Mixto, Blanco, 

Joven, Resposando, Anejo and Curados.

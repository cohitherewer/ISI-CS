 Is Calcutta once again playing host to the birds it had lost to environmental pollution? 

 Surprising many, a University Grants Commission (UGC)-sponsored study has found in Calcutta 12 species of birds that were hitherto unseen in the city. 

 The study, on urban bio-diversity in and around Calcutta, has revealed 228 species of birds across 17 sites in the city.

 When the data was compared with the information on the 292 species recorded by the Zoological Survey of India between 1964 and 1999 in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, several new species were found to have made an appearance.

 Among the ?new arrivals?, the Great Crested Grebe was sighted at the East Calcutta Wetlands, while the Large Pied Wagtail and the Sooty Flycatcher were reported for the first time at a fishermen?s cooperative in Brace Bridge. The Terek Sandpiper, Common Redshank and Curlew Sandpiper were also sighted at the East Calcutta Wetlands. 

 The orchards of Narendrapur and Shyamkhola were host to the Western Crowned Warbler and the Indian Pitta. The Asian Brown Flycatcher and the Indian Plaintive Cuckoo were seen at Banabitan in winter. 

 Two species of eagles have also made an appearance in Calcutta for the first time ? the Changeable Hawk Eagle sought refuge at the Shyamkhola and Narendrapur orchards, while the Booted Eagle surfaced at Banabitan and Joka.

 The majestic White Eyed Buzzard was found roosting in a thick canopy of trees at Shyamkhola and Narendrapur.

 The findings of the study, conducted between April 2002 and March 2005, were recently submitted to the UGC. 

 A number of birds were observed in Calcutta after a long hiatus during the survey. 

 The Pacific Golden Plover, last sighted in 1983, made an appearance at the East Calcutta Wetlands in the summer of 2005. The Black Capped Kingfisher, a native of the Sunderbans, was seen in 2004 near Brace Bridge and again this year on Indian Institute of Management (IIM) campus at Joka. The bird?s presence in Calcutta was last recorded in 1969. 

 Of the 17 sites surveyed in and around the city, the East Calcutta Wetlands, boasting of 140 species, has emerged as the favourite habitat of birds. Shyamkhola came a close second, with 137 species.

 Around 123 species of birds were recorded on the IIM campus in Joka and 96 species at Narendrapur. Banabitan was found to host 95 species of birds, while 85 species were sighted at Brace Bridge. 

 Raj Bhavan, Curzon Park and Tallah Park figured at the bottom of the avian habitat list.

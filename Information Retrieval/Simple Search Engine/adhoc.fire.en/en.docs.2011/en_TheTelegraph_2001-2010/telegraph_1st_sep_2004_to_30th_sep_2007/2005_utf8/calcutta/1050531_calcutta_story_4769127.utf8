 Retreat rules

 Tucking in a study within your home plan can be a good way of creating a 

 private space for yourself, says Ipsita Deb

 A private space to work, read, write or simply think. Including a study within your house plan is a great way to ensure some quality time for yourself within the busy agenda of the day. Barristers have their chambers, entrepreneurs their home offices, bookworms their libraries lined with volumes or kids a cute homework zone, but everyone needs their own retreat.

 Work zone 

 The first thing one needs to decide before setting up the study is its purpose, suggests interior designer Anita Mansatta. This would also largely decide its location. While some people prefer to create a study area in the childrens room, others may want some space in the master bedroom, while those with the luxury of having a separate room kept aside for it can convert it into a library and reading room, she adds.

 The study should always be located where there is minimal noise, space and visual clutter. Which usually means it is best placed away from the living area, feels artist Dolly Deb, who boasts a plush study at her Ballygunge home.

 Decor choice

 The primary ingredient of a study is the desk. Here again, there is a choice between a heritage feel and no-frills modernity. 

 An antique desk with leather chairs, wooden flooring and an old English-style library lends the perfect appeal, says Mansatta. However, on the necessity front, apart from the desk and chairs (invest in at least one quality chair with solid arms and back support), shelves for books, cabinets for files and drapes to filter the light entering the room are essential.

 Those who prefer a modern and tech-savvy study could opt for a PC, printer, fax machine et al to suit their needs. If space is a constraint, mobile filing cabinets that can be pulled out during the day but rolled under the desk at night, extra desk drawers that fit beneath computer keyboards and storage cabinets to supplement personal file drawers help ease the clutter problem.

 Furniture find

 A good, reliable carpenter and some creative design inputs could be the cheapest way to go. If your study is wood-based, get rid of some old junk and convert the salvageable wood into a sturdy desk. Similarly, cabinets and shelves can be made using the same wood or finish. If you want something readymade, apart from the furniture stores, try looking around the auction houses.

 Personal touch

 Well-framed family photographs are the simplest options to personalise your study. For the kids study, soft boards with colourful pins to stick pictures and cards will give them a creative space of their own. 

 I feel the best way to decorate any place is with the use of colour. Find a colour that matches your comfort level and use it to spruce up the study, advises interior designer Gopa Ray. 

 Get some foliage or greenery (a potted plant is just right) and see the difference it makes to the ambience, she adds. For those who have colour preferences that dont grow in the green zone, go ahead and gather a bunch of colourful flowers and place them in a pretty vase.

 Chi factor

 According to Feng Shui principles, a large desk provides room for expansive thinking and growth, while the chair represents your support and foundation. One must take care to ensure that both these are in good shape at all times, says Pinky Kapoor, Feng Shui expert and Goodlife columnist.

 Windows are always a good idea, but if small and high windows with no view at all is the only option, its best to use landscape posters with a far-off horizon, she adds.

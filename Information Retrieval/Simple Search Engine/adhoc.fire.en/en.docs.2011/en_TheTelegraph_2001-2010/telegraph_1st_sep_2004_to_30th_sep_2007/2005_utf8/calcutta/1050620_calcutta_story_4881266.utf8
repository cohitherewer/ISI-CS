The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gas utility tempers Buddha CNG claim

 JAYANTA BASU

 The June 5 report in Metro

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had asserted on World Environment Day (June 5) that his government would bring compressed natural gas (CNG) to the city soon. The possibility, however, is remote, even in the distant future.

 ?It is difficult to chart a roadmap for bringing CNG to Calcutta. The earliest possible date could be 2008,? said D.K. Purowar, general manager (gas sources), Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL).

 ?There are several bottlenecks. For one, the availability of CNG in the eastern part of the country depends on the Centre. The gas is expected to be sourced from Myanmar or Bangladesh,? he explained.

 ?Even if CNG is made available, we will have to consider the financial viability of carrying it to just one city by laying a nearly 1,000-km pipeline. Besides, one does not know what kind of response is in store,? observed a senior GAIL official.

 Chief minister Bhattacharjee, in his environment day speech, had fuelled the CNG versus LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) controversy by stating that talks were on with GAIL for bringing CNG to the city. He had indicated that a section of commercial car-owners were against a shift to LPG.

 The observations had surprised many, as they contradicted the state government?s recent policy of promoting LPG for commercial vehicles more than 15 years old.

 ?Talks are on with the West Bengal government for quite some time,? said another GAIL official.

 ?We are evaluating the possibility of transporting CNG from Jagadishpur or LNG (liquefied natural gas) from Dahej in tankers. LNG can subsequently be converted to CNG. We are also considering the possibility of using coal bed methane in Ranigunge,? the official added.

 He stated that even if the plan materialises, GAIL would hardly be able to cater to four fuel stations out of the existing 150 in the city. 

 ?When you already have LPG, go for it. Why wait for CNG and allow the already-high vehicular pollution level to increase manifold? Cities like Chennai and Bangalore are going the LPG way,? opined air-pollution expert Anumita Roy Choudhury of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).

 The organisation is overseeing the green fuel shift in 12 cities across the country under the direction of the Supreme Court.

 ?2008 is actually a very optimistic deadline,? Roy Chowdhury added. ?Calcutta can also go for a mixed route ? LPG and CNG together ? something akin to what Hyderabad proposes to do.? 

 The researcher added: ?The city can do it in phases ? conversion of three-wheelers and other vehicles to LPG followed by conversion of buses.? 

 Environmentalist Subhas Dutta said the apparently contradictory stands of the government are a ploy to buy more time.

 ?Forget action, where is the action plan to combat the ever-increasing vehicular pollution in the city?? he asked.

 Calcutta was the first city to submit an alternate fuel-based action plan in Supreme Court, but has failed to implement it.

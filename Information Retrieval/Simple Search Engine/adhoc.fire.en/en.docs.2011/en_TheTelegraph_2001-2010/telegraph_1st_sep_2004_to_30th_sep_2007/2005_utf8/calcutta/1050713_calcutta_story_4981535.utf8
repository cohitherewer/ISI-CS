 Road blocked after mishap

 - Speeding truck hits mother taking son to school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Angry residents blocked BT Road on Tuesday morning, disrupting traffic for nearly two hours, after a speeding mini-truck knocked down a woman and her 10-year-old son.

 Soma Chatterjee, 38, a resident of South Sinthee Road, in the Cossipore police station area, and her son were hit by the truck while crossing BT Road, near Rabindra Bharati University, police said.

 Soma suffered a serious head injury in the mishap. She was first taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. But since it had only minimal facilities to treat head injuries, she was shifted to SSKM Hospital.

 ?The injured woman is battling for survival. We have impounded the killer vehicle and arrested the driver. An investigation is underway to find out why the truck was speeding,? a police officer said.

 Soma had set off for BT Road Government-Sponsored Higher Secondary School along with son Soumik around 6.30 am, her husband Mrityunjay said. The boy studied in Class V in the morning section and used to be accompanied to school by his mother every day.

 ?When we were crossing the road, a truck hit us. I was flung in the air, before falling on the pavement in front of my school. I saw my mother writhing in pain in the middle of the road. There was a pool of blood around her head,? sobbed Soumik.

 Other guardians, students and local residents rushed Soma to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 ?The doctors there said she would have to be shifted to SSKM, as there weren?t facilities to conduct some tests necessary for her treatment. Doctors at SSKM said my wife has chest and shoulder injuries, besides haemorrhage in the brain,? recounted Mrityunjay.

 Angry residents and guardians put up a blockade on BT Road soon after the accident. It was lifted after senior police officers intervened. 

 ?There are four schools, besides a university, in the area. Students cross the stretch of the road all through the day. But there are no traffic signals, speedbreakers or policemen in the vicinity,? complained Biru Shee, a neighbour of the Chatterjees.

 Bibekananda Bhowmik, assistant headmaster of Soumik?s school, said despite repeated requests, arrangements have not been made by the administration to man traffic in the area. ?Headmaster Kanai Ganguly has repeatedly requested all concerned to post at least one traffic cop near the school, but in vain,? he lamented.

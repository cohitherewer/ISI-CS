The real estate boom in the city has certainly created a demand for one thing: stylish furniture. But there aren?t too many carpenters around who can produce the furniture that are in sync with the new-generation apartments/houses. 

 To bridge the gap, the government is considering setting up a furniture and woodcraft park in Bagnan, Howrah. The proposal for the park has been submitted to the government by an NGO, West Bengal Minority Council.

 There are, of course, a large number of carpenters in and around the city, but they are largely scattered and lack the training to cater to the huge market. 

 According to an estimate, at least 5,000 carpenters come to work in Calcutta every day from adjoining districts. More than 50,000 are associated with the trade in the city and its neighbouring districts, like Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas and Hooghly.

 ?The idea of a furniture and woodcraft park was conceived primarily to improve the condition of those associated with the trade and also to improve the production and marketability of wood products,? council president S. Jehangir said on Sunday.

 ?This is the right time for such an endeavour, now that there is a great demand for quality and stylish furniture,? he added. 

 ?The entire sector will benefit if the park can accommodate a sizeable number of carpenters and others involved in the trade,? Jehangir explained. ?There can be facilities for training in the park itself.?

 It has been the state government?s policy to set up or encourage others to set up parks related to various sectors of business ? such as gems and jewellery, light engineering, food, garments, plastic and steel.

 Some of the parks have started functioning, while several are coming up. The parks are being set up either directly by the government or by various industry associations, with help from the state.

 ?Talks will be held soon to finalise the details of the woodcraft and furniture park,? Jehangir told Metro. 

 An official of the commerce and industries department added: ?We?ve asked the organisation to submit a detailed report and the viability of the project will be worked out shortly.?

 The state?s policy, another senior official of the department explained, is to encourage setting up parks, as they ensure pollution-free production and offer better infrastructure (by virtue of being a hub of integrated services).

 ?This also helps increase competitiveness of the units,? the official explained.

 ?Other kinds of furniture, like those of cane and steel, can also be included in the park. Besides, there is the concept of setting up a huge market on the premises,? Jehangir added. 

 The council is seeking support from financial organisations. Right now, a consultant is preparing the blueprint for the park.

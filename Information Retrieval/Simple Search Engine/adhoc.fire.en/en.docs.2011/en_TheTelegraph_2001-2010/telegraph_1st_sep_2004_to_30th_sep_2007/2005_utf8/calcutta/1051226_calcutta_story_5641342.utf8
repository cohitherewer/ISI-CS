 Posting time for teachers 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A shuffle of professors is on the cards at state-run medical colleges in the city, following scheduled inspection visits by the Medical Council of India (MCI). 

 A drive in January is expected to result in the transfer of a large number of senior professors, who have been teaching in a college for more than a decade. During the month, candidates will also be selected for teaching posts recently sanctioned by the state government.

 Long stints at city medical colleges by senior professors have ensured that many departments in the districts suffer from a dearth of experienced teachers and heads. 

 Recently, the state government had transferred 161 senior doctors and 600 clerks under health services, much to their consternation. A majority of the group had been serving at city hospitals of their choice for years and had been accused of corruption. 

 ?The MCI has already finished inspection of a number of medical colleges in the city and districts. More inspection visits are to follow shortly,? stated Jayshree Mitra, director of medical education.

 She added: ?We are assessing the needs of city and district colleges in terms of teachers. Based on our assessment, we will transfer people.?

 According to sources in the health directorate, following the inspection visits ? at National Medical College, Burdwan Medical College and North Bengal Medical College, among others ? the MCI expressed concern about the number of vacant posts of professors. 

 A senior officer of the state health department said: ?A number of subjects has been introduced at district colleges. The number of seats has also gone up. The lack of senior professors at these colleges has forced the state government to appoint acting heads of departments.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without...

 Making the best of I-Day weekend

 If the summer vacation seems long gone and the Puja holidays are just too far, make the best of the coming extended weekend by escaping to a nearby destination. With Independence Day conveniently falling on a Monday, you have three full days to enjoy the spirit of freedom. Warning: act fast, since most popular weekend getaways are likely to be booked to the brim with people grabbing the opportunity of an I-Day weekend out of ? but close to ? town.

 Shopping for Rakhi

 With a couple of weeks to go for Rakhi, its time you started shopping for brother dear, or sister, whatever may be the case. If you thought thats a little too early to go gift hunting, youre probably missing the point that stores and boutiques around town have loaded their racks with offerings for the auspicious occasion. Not just that, its raining discounts at most designer outlets trying their best to cash in on the Sindhara and Rakhi festive season.

 Catching Mangal Pandey

 The biggest release of the year ? Mangal Pandey: The Rising ? is all set to hit theatres across the country this Friday. And theres no way you can get through the week without catching a show. For Aamir Khan fans, the long wait (the star has been missing in reel action for the past four years) is finally going to be over. So, catching the new-look Aamir is a must before you engage in debates about whether the moustached avatar suits him more than the new clean-shaven cutie in the Titan ads. Film buffs, on the other hand, are sure to be waiting to see whether the film repeats the Lagaan success and makes its way to red carpets, following a standing ovation at Locarno.

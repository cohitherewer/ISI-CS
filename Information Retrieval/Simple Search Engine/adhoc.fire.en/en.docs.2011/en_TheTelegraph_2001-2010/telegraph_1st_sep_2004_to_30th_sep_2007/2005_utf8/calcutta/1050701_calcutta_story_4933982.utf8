 Murder tag on kidnap couple

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gunjan Ghosh and wife Rumela: Chargesheeted 

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) filed a chargesheet on Thursday holding eight persons responsible for the abduction and killing of Mithun Koley. The only son of a Dum Dum-based businessman had been murdered two years ago.

 Hours before filing the chargesheet, sleuths arrested Rumela, wife of Gunjan Ghosh ? mastermind of Roma Jhawar?s abduction and Mithun?s murder ? for her direct involvement in the crime. She was picked up from her Baguiati residence.

 The chargesheet also mentioned why Mithun was murdered even after his father had paid a ransom of Rs 10 lakh. One of the key conspirators who had hatched the plan of Mithun?s abduction is, however, still at large.

 Mithun was abducted in front of a restaurant in Salt Lake on November 10, 2003. Rumela had asked him to meet her outside the eatery. Three days later, he was found lying on the premises of NRS Hospital with serious head injuries. A fortnight later, the 20-year-old youth succumbed to his injuries.

 The CID reopened the case this year while investigating Roma Jhawar?s abduction. Sleuths found Mithun?s abduction and murder also to be an act of Gunjan and gang. Gunjan and five associates were then arrested, one by one.

 In the course of interrogation, Rumela had given a confessional statement saying she had been used to trap Mithun. She left the kidnap spot in a taxi as soon as Gunjan and the others abducted the youth. She claimed she had no idea what happened after that.

 ?But our investigations have revealed that she was lying. She had not only called Mithun to a restaurant in Salt Lake, she was also seated in the vehicle used to pick up the youth, beat him up and drug him in,? said Rajiv Kumar, deputy inspector-general of police (operations), CID.

 Rumela had come to the designated spot in a Maruti van with Gunjan and the others. ?She, too, boarded the vehicle after Mithun was gagged and dragged into the vehicle,? stated Kumar, adding how Rumela had ?helped Gunjan slap a leucoplast on Mithun?s mouth?.

 After keeping Mithun confined to the Kadapara residence of Munna Singh, an employee of a state-run press who was arrested earlier, Gunjan and Dharmendra Prasad had collected the ransom money.

 ?Gunjan had decided not to share the ransom of Rs 10 lakh with his associates. He took Dharmendra into confidence and gave him Rs 4 lakh,? said an officer.

 Gunjan then returned to Singh?s house and told the others: ?Kill him (Mithun) because his father is not prepared to meet our demands.?

 The goons then smashed the back of Mithun?s head with a blunt weapon and dumped him behind a building on the NRS Medical College and Hospital campus.

 During the course of the 84-day probe, police arrested all the seven accused. ?Dharmendra is still absconding,? said Kumar, admitting that Rumela?s ?false? statement had put investigators on the right track and helped them crack the case.

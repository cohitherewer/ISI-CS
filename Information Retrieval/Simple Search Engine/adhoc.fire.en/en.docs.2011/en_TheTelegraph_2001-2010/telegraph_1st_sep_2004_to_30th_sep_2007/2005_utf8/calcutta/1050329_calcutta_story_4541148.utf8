 Light and lifestyle go hand in hand. The right shade can create the mood and the wrong one can spoil it beyond repair. Among the numerous fashionable options available around town in lamps and lampshades, we spotted some cool ones that lend your interiors a fashionable farmhouse charm.

 These open-ended lamps come with a wooden frame that has two transparent glass panels showcasing psychedelic, floral and geometric patterns cut or painted on handmade paper. 

 The rough texture of the paper and the soft glow emanating out of it give it an ethnic edge as well. One or more sides of the lamp are louvred for an added old-world charm.

 The louvres are not that well defined in the case of small lamps but exhibit charming patterns from the two-and-a-half-ft-long floor lamps. While these are long and narrow, the smaller ones are square shaped and can be used as wall, roof and, of course, table lamps.

 If you find the wood and paper combination a little unsafe for anything to do with heat and light, you can be rest assured with the knowledge that the wood used in the lamps is teak or sesame wood, both of which are heat resistant. 

 Besides, one end is left open, giving the apparatus a casual look while also dissipating the heat. The louvres or perforations help in the same way.

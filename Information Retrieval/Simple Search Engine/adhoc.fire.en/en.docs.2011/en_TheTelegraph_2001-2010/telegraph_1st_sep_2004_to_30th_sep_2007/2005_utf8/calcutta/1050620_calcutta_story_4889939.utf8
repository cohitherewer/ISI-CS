 Friends on suspect list

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The murder of 19-year-old Ajay Agarwal could have been the fall-out of a dispute with his friends.

 After obtaining leads to that effect in the course of preliminary investigations, the sleuths are now focussing on three friends of Ajay. The trio was last seen entering the second-floor apartment of the Agarwals? on Surya Sen Street a few hours before the murder was detected on Saturday.

 ?We are interrogating them thoroughly. Though we have not detained them, our officers are in touch with them constantly,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department.

 Ajay, the only son of a Burrabazar-based hardware dealer, was found murdered by his father Anil around 7.45 pm on Saturday.

 ?The killers, who were apparently known to Ajay, had tied his hands and legs, and gagged his mouth with a piece of cloth before slitting his throat with a sharp weapon. His father, after returning home, found the entrance to the flat open, almirahs and other furniture scattered and Rs 1.3 lakh missing,? said an officer of the detective department.

 An employee of a mattress-making unit on the ground floor of the building in which the Agarwals lived told police that he had seen three of Ajay?s friends enter the building around 12.30 pm. 

 Half-an-hour earlier, some workers of political parties had visited the flat to hand over the voters? slips for Sunday?s election. The employee saw the three leave the building around 2 pm.

 ?The timing of entry and exit of the three has forced us to be suspicious. We are interrogating them to know why they went to the flat. They have been asked to give us a blow-by-blow account of their two-hour stay there,? said an officer of the detective department?s homicide wing.

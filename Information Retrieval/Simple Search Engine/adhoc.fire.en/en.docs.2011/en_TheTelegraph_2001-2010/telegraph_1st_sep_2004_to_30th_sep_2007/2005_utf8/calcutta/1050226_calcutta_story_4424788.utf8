 Land lifeline for transport bodies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A state Assembly committee on transport has recommended on Friday that the state transport corporations develop the land they hold as a solution to the resource crunch they are facing. 

 At the receiving end of the advice were the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC), Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) and other transport organisations elsewhere in Bengal.

 ?There are chunks of land in different areas owned by the CTC and other state-run transport corporations. A substantial amount of funds can be raised by making commercial use of such land with assistance from private parties,? said Sadhan Pande, chairman of the Assembly subjects committee on transport. 

 The committee held a marathon meeting to draw up a plan of action for the cash-starved CSTC, CTC and other transport organisations.

 The transport department has engaged a consultant, Consulting Engineering Services (CES), to prepare a report on how to make the corporations viable. CES officials were also present at the meeting.

 ?We have held lengthy discussions to find out ways and means of enabling the corporations to stand on their own feet without depending on government subsidies. The CES is preparing the report and we have placed 10-point suggestions for their consideration,?? said subjects committee chairman Sadhan Pande.

 The government provides an annual subsidy of Rs 200 crore to five state transport corporations, including the CSTC, South Bengal State Transport Corporation, West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation, North Bengal State Transport Corporation and the CTC. 

 Of the five transport corporations, four are running up recurring losses and depend solely on government subsidies for paying salary and wages and maintenance of vehicles. The only exception is the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation, which has reached a no-loss-no-profit situation. The CTC depends on the subsidy even to repair tram tracks.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has made it clear that the government will not be able to provide annual subsidy of Rs 200 crore to the corporations any more and all the corporations will have to mobilise their own resources to run them.

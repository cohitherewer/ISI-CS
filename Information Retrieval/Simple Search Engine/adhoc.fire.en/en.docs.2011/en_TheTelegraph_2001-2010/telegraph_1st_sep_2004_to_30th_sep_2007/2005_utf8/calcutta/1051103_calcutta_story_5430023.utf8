 Snag halts London take-off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The pilot of a London-bound British Airways plane had to pull out of take-off at Calcutta airport on Wednesday morning when one of the engines developed a technical glitch while taxiing.

 There were 199 passengers and 15 crew members on board.

 An airline spokesperson said the plane had to be brought to a halt using the emergency brake, which causes the deflation of a tyre.

 ?It was a minor thing and there was no possibility of any danger to either the passengers or the crew members due to the deflation of a tyre,? added the spokesperson.

 The passengers were evacuated from the plane and flown to London in flights of other airlines.

 The Boeing 777, whose scheduled departure was at 4.45 am, was taken to a bay at the airport for repair.

 ?Our engineers are trying to repair the technical glitch that caused the abortive take-off. Once the snag is rectified, the aircraft will be operational again,? the spokesperson said.

 ?There was no panic after the application of the emergency brake. The passengers were not inconvenienced,? she added.

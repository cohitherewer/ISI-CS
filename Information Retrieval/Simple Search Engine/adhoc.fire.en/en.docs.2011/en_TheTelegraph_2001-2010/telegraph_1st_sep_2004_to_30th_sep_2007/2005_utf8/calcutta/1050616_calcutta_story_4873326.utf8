 Inquiry ordered into civic tax scam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya on Wednesday ordered a probe into the siphoning of funds from the treasury department of Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s (CMC) Gariahat office. 

 An FIR has been lodged with Gariahat police station by Biplab Roy, treasurer of the office. 

 ?Municipal commissioner Debashis Som has submitted a report on behalf of the CMC. According to the report, some files containing details of tax deposited have been deleted from a computer,? said Bhattacharya.

 As per estimates, about Rs 65 lakh has allegedly been siphoned off by computer operators in the treasury department by deleting the entry of the deposited tax amount. 

 CMC officials and cops probing the case, however, said the scam could run into crores, as about Rs 70-80 lakh of tax is deposited at the Gariahat office every day.

 Bhattacharya said the computer from which the records had been deleted has been impounded.

 ?We are worried that such incidents will demoralise the tax-payer. Several municipalities allow people to pay taxes online. Tax-payers, however, might be reluctant to do so in the light of such an incident,? the minister added.

 Treasury department officials had found that some of the deposits were not correctly entered in the computer. The computer operators later managed to hack the password to the database and delete the suspected entries.

 ?So, when the details were sought, the investigators drew a blank,? an official explained.

 CMC officials stumbled upon the racket around two weeks ago, after some tax-payers reported that they had received receipts of higher amounts against tax paid at the Gariahat branch. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has promised action against the guilty.

 From studios, a Tolly feel

 Hemmed in by men dabbing paint on plaster of Paris or carving out designs on plywood, the art directors of Tollywood now find themselves a world apart from the arc lights.

 The run-up to the festivities finds the likes of Samir Kundu, Goutam Basu and Rupchand Kundu, the creative forces behind some popular pandals in town, as busy as ever.

 What lures them away from the studio floors and to the puja pandals is the craving for creative satisfaction. Samir is dividing his time between two pandals ? Naskarpara Palli Unnayan Samity in Haridevpur and Pallibandhab Byayam Samity in Kalighat ? and a serial shoot at Indrapuri Studios. It?s a bit of a bother, but he is enjoying it.

 ?I love the complete creative freedom that designing a puja pandal provides. During a film shoot, you have to carry out what the director wants,? says Samir, who has around 42 films to his name. 

 The last thing he?d want to do is build palaces and dilapidated mansions as pandals. ?These are mostly what we do in films. So at the pujas, we want to do something different.?

 Goutam agrees: ?In films, art direction is background work. Though the credit lies in erecting sets that people can?t distinguish from a natural setting, it feels good when a crowd comes to see your achievement. One needs to be very involved with this work; it usually takes one-and-a-half to two months just for the preparation.?

 A busy art director who works with Mrinal Sen, Aparna Sen and Haranath Chakraborty, Goutam is recreating a temple at Ballygunge Cultural Association. The idol is being placed on a 14-ft-high pedestal and pandal-hoppers will have to climb a flight of stairs for a closer glimpse of the goddess. Goutam has also roped in cinematographer Rana Dasgupta to design the lights.

 Having worked on pandals for the past seven years or so, Rupchand is a sought-after name among puja committees. He is currently working on the Netaji Sporting Club pandal in Lake Town and Dum Dum Park Bharat Chakra, devoting no less than four months on each ? one month for design and three for execution. ?With pandals becoming more elaborate by the day and corporate sponsorship coming in, people want greater innovations in the theme. Hence, the demand for art directors,? reasons Rupchand, the man behind the sets of megaserial Ek Akasher Neeche and films by Tapan Sinha and Chidananda Dasgupta.

 But a few in the fraternity feel puja projects can get the better of you, if not handled properly. ?I had done a Jagaddhatri puja pandal in Chandernagore last year and realised that you have to work under a lot of pressure and face diverse criticism from the puja committee members. If you can manipulate your way, it works fine,? feels Arup Ghosh, who designs the sets for Ekdin Pratidin on the telly.

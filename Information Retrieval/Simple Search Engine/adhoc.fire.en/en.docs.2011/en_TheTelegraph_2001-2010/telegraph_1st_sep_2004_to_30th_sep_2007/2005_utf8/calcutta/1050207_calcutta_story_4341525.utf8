The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A brush with serenity

 Inspired by the works of the masters of the Bengal school, like Abanindranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose, Ajoy Kumar Banerjee?s paintings recalls a time when life afforded ample leisure and restful ease. The ongoing exhibition of his works unveils lush, verdant hillscapes and female figures in mellow mood. His handling of watercolour tempera, specially on silk, reveals the artist?s fondness for unspoilt, pristine beauty in nature, as well as in life. His sensitive washes and tender brushstrokes evoke a charming, idyllic world, free from weariness and strife. Banerjee?s solitary female figures, mostly shown engaged in household chores, express a feeling of serenity and contentment with life.

 Event: Exhibition of paintings by Ajoy Kumar Banerjee

 When: Till February 13, 4 pm- 8 pm

 Where: The Society of Contemporary Artists, 398 Jogendra Garden Road, Kasba, Calcutta 78

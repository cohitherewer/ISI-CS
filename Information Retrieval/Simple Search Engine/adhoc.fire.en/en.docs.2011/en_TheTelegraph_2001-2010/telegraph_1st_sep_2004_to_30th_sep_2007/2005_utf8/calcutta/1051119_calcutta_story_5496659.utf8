The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Goblet on the greens 

 Rugs and cushions, madurs and even folding tea tables. Dew on the grass and a starry sky, a near-full moon canopy above and Harry magic on a giant screeen... It was a Royal bash for the Potter people

 Harry Potter greets the premiere people

 Girls just wanna have fun

 Harry Potter on the giant screen

 Boys rsquo; evening out

 The first fairway of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) was the novel open-air arena for the eastern India premiere of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, on Thursday evening. The lawns were packed, as kids and parents flocked to the fairway with one drive ? ?I saw it before you?. A huge cheer when Harry first appeared on screen, gasps when he was stalked by the Hungarian Horntail dragon, stray catcalls when teenage love hinted at blossoming... The audio was punctuated with static at times and the pictures were a touch hazy, but the Potter carnival wouldn?t pause. The rush for burgers and fries from the KFC stall and pizza slices from the Fire N Ice counter just added to the festive feel.

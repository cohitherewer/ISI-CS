 St Thomas? Boys? School, in association with TTIS, presented its annual inter-school fest, Melange?05 ? flames of passion, at GD Birla Sabhagar on October 29. 

 Participating institutions included St Thomas? Girls?, St James, Welland Gouldsmith, Mahadevi Birla Girls, Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan and Apeejay, along with the host school.

 Body makeover, creative writing, photography, treasure hunt and bowling featured in the list of off-stage events. In the series of on-stage events at the daylong fest, first was the opening ceremony, followed by a medley of dumb charade and antakshari. 

 Next in queue was the much-awaited choreographed dance contest. The hosts were the show-stealers with their unconventional footwork and movements. This was followed by a fashion extravaganza based on interesting themes. All the while, Shirin Khan kept the audience engrossed with her lively banter.

 The fashion show gave way to the award ceremony. The host school was declared the overall winner, followed by Apeejay and St Thomas? Girls?. St James was the best-dressed in the fashion show, St Thomas? Boys? was the runner-up and Mahadevi Birla Girls? High, the second runner-up.

 Then the war of the DJs was unleashed. DJ Akash of Calcutta, DJ Piyush of Hyderabad, Bangalore?s DJ TT and DJ Veeru of Mumbai made sure that the musical clash was entertainment at its best.

 A step in tune

 Hope Kolkata Foundation and Silver Star dance school organised Hope Stars, a charity show, at the Science City auditorium on November 5.

 The programme Dances of the World showcased a selection of choreographed items set to Arabian, Indian, Japanese, Hawaiian, Brazilian, Argentinean and Irish music. It was choreographed and conceptualised by Tito Dey and Silver Star. 

 A Bengali VCD titled Ek Joda Gappo was launched on the occasion. In the VCD, puppetry has been used to enact stories from the Panchatantra. The proceeds from the sale of the VCDs will be donated to help children in need.

 A number of celebrities from Tollywood attended the event. The dances by students of Silver Star and the children of NGOs were a visual treat. Thirteen-year-old Anoushka Ghosh of Heritage School put up a brilliant performance as she joined Shayne Hyrapiet on stage to render songs dedicated to underprivileged children. The programme concluded with a Parineeta dance item by all 250 participants. Shayne signed off with Heal the World. The proceeds from the concert will go towards providing higher education to children supported by Hope Foundation.

Trio in triumph

 While the rest of the city was preparing for the Pujas, three youngsters from Calcutta were busy framing arguments that won them laurels at an inter-school meet in New Delhi ? the 2nd Outlook all-India debate competition.

 Out of 288 schools from across the country, 24 made it through the regional and zonal rounds to the finals. Among them were four schools from Calcutta. The motion was ?Youth of India are less patriotic than their predecessors?. And it was a tough fight.

 ?The standard of debating was really very high,? says Prachi Preetam Jha of Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan, who emerged the best speaker for the motion. Prachi is not new to debating, though. Earlier in the year, she had won the best speaker award in a debate organised by the United Nations high commission at the state Assembly. 

 The other two achievers from the city were Subid Chakroborty and Rushil Gambhir of Don Bosco Park Circus and La Martiniere for Boys, respectively. ?I didn?t exactly have to read up on the topic. But I did source some information from magazines and websites and then framed my own arguments. Originality is what sets you apart,? feels Subid, who bagged the first runner-up prize, against the motion.

 However all three agreed to be regular readers of the newspaper. ?That helps you to keep abreast of current affairs,? believes Rushil, the first runner-up for the motion. 

 Calcutta boy Soumya Chakroborty of St James also made it to the final round. The participants were given three minutes each to speak. ?The clincher was the round where each participant was asked questions and in turn had to ask questions to another participant,? adds Prachi.

 THE DIARYCoup d?oeil

 A single eyelid stranded in the unceasing retina, 

 That captures more morbid seconds than known.

 Thin-slicing from the past and present, 

 Holding snippets of forever glory too.

 The incompatible patchwork irks me. 

 Do the eyes really show the true picture? 

 Grief stricken many, 

 still and saddened too, 

 Hidden beneath though many who never showed up. 

 Those with the beauties and pleasure 

 Pretend to be denied, part of those who cried

 For sanity to return, for freedom

 To pursue their lost individuality.

 All said and done, not a word heard, 

 Silenced syllables, voiceless intonations.

 The moon-spoon rhyme

 The see-saw moves 

 in Salvador?s watch, 

 the blind man dreams

 dark syrup moon

 trembles in your spoon

 you fell from the bed,

 and screamed for a pen

 to write to Urmi, your wife?

 steel disc moon

 cracks your spoon

 her blue song,

 and forgotten magnets,

 knock at midnight

 bite the flowers off the spoon 

 and slam the phone upon the moon

 The Dum Dum underpass is one of the worst-designed and ill-maintained constructions in the city. It is besieged with problems and a nightmare for those who have to use it. There is a gigantic pothole outside the Nagerbazar end of the underpass that has remained there for several months. It was temporarily filled with earth after monsoon, but as expected, was back to what it was within weeks. Complicating matters further, rickshaws park by the side of the pothole and pedestrians are forced to walk along the carriageway as there is no footpath. The administration obviously won?t be bothered about repairing the stretch or preventing the rickshaws from parking there until someone loses his or her life in a mishap.

 The entrance of an ATM of a nationalised bank on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road has become home to drug addicts. I have often spotted three to four people there self-injecting drugs in broad daylight. They also litter the place. The local police are aware of this but haven?t taken any action. I request them to take the matter seriously.

 Several NGOs and schools took underprivileged children on picnics and distributed gifts amongst them on Children?s Day. But nobody gave a thought for the young ragpickers and helps at roadside eateries. The occasion would be more meaningful if the government agencies do something for these kids. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park.

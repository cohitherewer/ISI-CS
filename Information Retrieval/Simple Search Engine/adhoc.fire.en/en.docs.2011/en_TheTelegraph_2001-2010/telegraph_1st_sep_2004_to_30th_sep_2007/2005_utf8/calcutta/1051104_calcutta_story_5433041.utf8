 Sandalwood haul rerun in port raid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A week and a half after cops from Howrah impounded a consignment of sandalwood, worth Rs 1 crore, from Calcutta?s Jorabagan, the revenue intelligence department on Wednesday stumbled upon another, worth Rs 3 crore, at Netaji Subhas dock.

 The consignment, weighing around 70 tonnes, comprised three containers and was meant for export to Singapore. The consignors had declared that the containers held garments.

 They had cleared all formalities and the cargo was loaded on to a ship when the revenue intelligence team swooped down on the port. The officers checked the documents and found them to be forged. The containers were broken open and the sandalwood recovered.

 ?All three containers were sealed, with shipping bills issued by the central excise department pasted on them,? said an Netaji Subhas dock officer who oversees cargo handling. ?The bills were so neatly forged that it was difficult to tell at a glance they were fake. The smugglers were confident that the containers would not be put under the scanner, as they had the ?excise clearance?.?

 While revenue intelligence officers have launched a search for the members of the racket, police are on the lookout for another gang that excels in forging government documents.

 This was the second sandalwood haul by the revenue intelligence in the recent past. On August 26, another team had stumbled upon an illegal sandalwood container at Haldia dock and seized it. That consignment, too, was headed for Singapore.

 Officers said smugglers are cashing in on a Delhi-Kathmandu treaty, allowing exporters from Nepal to use Indian ports for shipping their consignments. 

 While the sandalwood had come from south India, the racketeers had readied the papers in a way to prove they were exporting garments brought from Nepal.

 ?We had arrested one person in Behala in that connection and he had offered some details. But there is more to it than we have known,? said an officer of the revenue intelligence. 

 He added that the man arrested had been working with several others, who were eluding the net.

Tamara Osborn, a rare female saxophonist from the UK, has been rocking the Calcutta music scene for over a month now. Be it a retro lounge or a night club, she has found quite a receptive audience for her music so far. But the biggest recognition came last week when she passed the litmus test for live music at Someplace Else, when she jammed with rock band Skinny Alley. 

 ?Funk is an integral part of our music and Tamara said that it?s funk that really excites her, so we were at it from the word go. Communication was not a problem at all,? said Jayashree, the lead female vocalist of Skinny Alley. After two days of intense practice , which involved both Tamara and the band picking up new songs, the gang delivered a scintillating performance at the pub on Wednesday evening. 

 From Maceo Parker, a saxophonist who played with James Brown and is Tamara?s inspiration, to Skinny Alley originals like Hot and cold and Firefly, the repertoire was extensive. Sting?s Fragile and What?s going on by Marvin Gaye also formed part of the song list. 

 ?This is mind-blowing music,? said actor Jishu Sengupta, chilling with his childhood friends. 

 The musicians themselves couldn?t agree more. ?We loved the experience and would love to do more of this when Tamara is back from UK in April,? signed off Jayashree.

 Holi hog

 The kitchens at The Peerless Inn these days are fit for many a feast, what with four food promotions jostling for taste buds and table space at the various restaurants of this Esplanade hotel. From breakfast to a sumptuous Bengali lunch, drinks to lip-smacking snacks, a foodie is sure to find something to suit his pocket and palate all through this month. 

 Daab Chingri and Chingri Macher Patishapta are few of the delicacies on offer in the prawn festival at the Bengali speciality restaurant, Aaheli. A prelude to Holi, the fest features recipes from across the state.

 On the Continental plate are sandwiches and sizzlers at Nishidin, the 24-hour coffee shop, and Bichitra, the multi-cuisine restaurant, where snacks and dinner spreads are up for grabs. Tuck into an Open-faced Turkey Sandwich or a Peerless Club House Burger. The sizzler menu boasts lamb, chicken, seafood and even cottage cheese. 

 It?s wine and cheese time at Lahari, the bar, with bottles on sale for Rs 900. A glass of wine for Rs 150 comes with a complementary platter of cheese.

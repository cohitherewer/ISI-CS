 Solution deadline for JU students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A deadline for the solution to the over-two-month-long impasse at Jadavpur University was laid down on Tuesday with the five-member inquiry team virtually serving an ultimatum.

 The committee said it would stop negotiations with the agitating students if they made further delays in coming to the talks table.

 The inquiry team is expected to meet the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) for the last time on Wednesday. 

 The committee was supposed to have met on Tuesday to hold the final round of discussions on restoring normal academic activities on the campus. But Fetsu, after a last-minute decision, appealed to the inquiry committee late on Monday evening to put off the talks till Wednesday. 

 Fetsu, which held a meeting of its general body on Tuesday, had sought another day?s time on the plea that it wanted to hold a final round of talks with its members on Tuesday, prior to appearing before the inquiry committee.

 ?We have given them (the students) ample time to consider our suggestions on bringing back normalcy on the campus. We clarified our stand to them during our earlier discussions. We will not accept any further delays on their part,? said Manoj Mitra, dean of engineering and technology faculty and chairman of the five-member inquiry committee.

 It is learnt that the students had accepted the committee?s suggestions on most issues after the authorities expressed their willingness to withdraw the suspension orders slapped on five senior students. But the students are unwilling to accept the committee?s proposal that they would have to apologise for the campus violence in 2003.

 The committee members initially said Fetsu had promised to apologise. But at the last meeting the students had gone back on their word. Fetsu leaders refused comment on their decision.

 The SFI, students? wing of the ruling CPM, called for an opinion poll to decide whether or not mainstream students were backing the agitating students on the Jadavpur University campus.

 ?If an opinion poll is held, it will be found that mainstream students are not with the agitation by a handful,? claimed SFI state president Sudipta Sengupta.

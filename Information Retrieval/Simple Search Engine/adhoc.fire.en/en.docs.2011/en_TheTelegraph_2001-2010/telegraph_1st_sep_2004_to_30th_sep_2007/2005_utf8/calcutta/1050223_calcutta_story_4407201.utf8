A touch of green

 Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Pointed, sharp or spiky-leaved cacti are best 

avoided in home interiors, according to Feng Shui. These tend to kill the positive 

Chi in a house and create conflict with the environment, leading to various kinds 

of problems. Feng Shui also doesnt support growing bonsai at home since 

the process of stunting the plants goes against nature. Moreover, having indoor 

plants in the bedroom is not advisable either as these increase the carbon dioxide 

content in the room at night

Q: I have a small garden in my house 

where I grow a variety of seasonal flowers and plants, including cacti and bonsai. 

I am extremely fond of greenery and have placed them all over my house and even 

in the bedrooms. Is this advisable in Feng Shui? 

Aparna Biswas

The Solution: Connecting with nature is a good 

hobby, but at the same time, bringing pointed, sharp or spiky-leaved cacti in 

the interiors kills the heavenly Chi. This creates conflict with the environment, 

leading to various kinds of problems. Bonsais are not recommended in Feng Shui 

either, as the Chinese believe stunting the natural growth of plants is to go 

against nature. Having plants in the bedrooms at night is not advised at all because 

they fill the rooms with carbon dioxide. Wood in the form of plants is the only 

living element among the five elements of nature. Placing them in our surroundings 

like the entrance, corridors, hallways, living rooms and balconies helps us to 

grow with them.

Q: I live in a small town and I have 

a newly-built house made strictly on Feng Shui principles. The interiors are also 

beautifully done up. The problem I face is that visitors to my house admire it, 

but at the same time leave negative vibes behind. Please advise.

The Solution: Plants and flowers occupy an 

important position in Feng shui. They can be placed on either side of the entrance 

door to serve dual purposes. Firstly, they will make the entrance look beautiful 

and draw positive Chi in abundance into your home. Secondly, they will absorb 

the negative energy left behind by your visitors. Small earthen pots filled with 

salt till the brim and hidden in the plants will also help absorb the negativity 

to a great extent. The salt has to be changed every day since it will stagnate 

after absorbing negative energy.

Q: I have been married for three 

years now and have constant arguments with my husband on trivial issues. A friend 

pointed out that the water sink and cooking stove placed side by side in the kitchen 

could be the cause of our fights. But it is impossible to do away with either 

of them. Please advise. 

Alka Agnihotri

The Solution: This is a common problem faced 

by most homemakers. Placing a fresh green plant between the water sink and cooking 

stove helps to harmonise the conflicting elements. Water starts nourishing the 

plant, which in turn fuels the fire, according to the productive cycle of the 

five elements. Alternatively, build a stone partition between the sink and the 

stove. Placing a green serving tray could also solve the problem. 

Q: We have recently moved into a 

big apartment occupying 4,000 square feet, which is actually two flats joined 

together. In the process, we have landed up having all the four toilets in the 

centre of the house, which is against Feng Shui principles. We have invested so 

much in this property that it is difficult to dispose it off immediately. Please 

recommend a remedy. 

Name withheld

The Solution: The centre of the house is the 

most pious area and having toilets here is not considered auspicious at all. Placing 

full-length mirrors on the outer surface of the toilet doors will work effectively 

to give the illusion of their non-existence. Keeping shallow bowls filled with 

salt along with fresh growing plants will also help to absorb the negative energy 

created by these toilets.

Q: My daughter will soon appear for 

her secondary examinations. But she seems very nervous and lacks concentration. 

I have tried to solve this problem by placing lots of Feng Shui objects on her 

desk, but nothing has worked. Please suggest remedies that will help her concentrate 

and increase her confidence level. 

Mukta Singhania

The Solution: Placing too many Feng Shui objects 

on the table will hamper her concentration level further. Clear her table of all 

the objects and simply place a small image of god in the north-east corner of 

the desk. Also place her study material in this corner and pin all the difficult 

formulae on the north-east part of a soft board. Displaying inspirational quotes 

of great people on the board will increase her confidence level immensely. Ensure 

that she is not sitting under a beam or being hit by any sharp objects while studying. 

Also make sure she is facing one of her auspicious directions, which can be calculated 

from her date of birth using the kua formula.

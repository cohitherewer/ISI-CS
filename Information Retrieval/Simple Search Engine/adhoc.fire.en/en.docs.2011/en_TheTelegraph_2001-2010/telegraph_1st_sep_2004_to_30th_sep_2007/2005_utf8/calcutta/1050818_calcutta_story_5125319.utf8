The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bypass body still a mystery

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two days after her body was recovered from the marshy stretch off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, the identity of the murdered young woman remains shrouded in mystery.

 All that the sleuths could say on Wednesday was that some local criminals had helped the killers dump the body near the Science City roundabout, some time between Friday and Saturday.

 Cops on the case picked up the trail of gangs in the area known to take on ?work for outsiders? against a hefty fee.

 Even as the body lay in the Alipore morgue, the South 24-Parganas police control repeated the message about the Independence Day discovery of the body in the marshes off the Bypass. The woman was clad in blue salwar-kameez and had a watch on the left wrist. By the time cops removed the body, it had already started swelling, suggesting she had been murdered more than a few hours ago.

 Except for strangulation marks on her neck, there were no marks of physical injuries on the body ? something that prompted cops to believe that the girl was strangled to death with her dupatta.

 ?The body is yet to be identified? Unless we get to know something about the girl?s background, it is quite difficult to make any headway,? admitted S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

 Apart from some clue to her identity, police are also awaiting the post-mortem report. ?We hope to get it by Thursday,? said Gupta.

 Sleuths claimed the post-mortem report would throw up some vital details about the victim. ?It could also help us ascertain whether she had tried to fight off her assailants before being overpowered and strangulated,? said a police officer of Tiljala.

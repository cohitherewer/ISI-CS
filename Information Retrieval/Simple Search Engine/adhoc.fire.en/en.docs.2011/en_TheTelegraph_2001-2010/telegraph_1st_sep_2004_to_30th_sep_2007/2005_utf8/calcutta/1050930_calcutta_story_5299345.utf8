 Gas cylinders cook up Puja crisis alert

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An LPG-less Puja is staring at consumers. A crisis of cooking gas cylinders has been brewing in and around the city, as consumers are made to wait for at least 15 to 20 days to get cylinders refilled. 

 Officials of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the coordinator of four oil companies, said on Thursday that irregular supply of cooking gas from refineries was responsible for the shortfall in supply.

 ?The LPG for the city and its surroundings comes from refineries in Haldia and Jamnagar, and also from Malaysia,? said IOC deputy general manager (LPG) A.C. De. ?But for the past few days, we have not been receiving any gas from Jamnagar and Malaysia. Consequently, supply of cylinders has been affected.??

 According to IOC officials, there are around 2.7 million LPG consumers in the city and only 30 per cent of the supply comes from Haldia.

 ?It is impossible to meet the demand with gas from the Haldia refinery alone. The demand increases hugely during the festive season, but we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to meet it,? an official said.

 Dealers in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Baguiati, Jadavpur and Behala have complained that they are facing the wrath of consumers for not being able to supply cylinders in time. ?What can we do if we do not receive enough cylinders?? asked B.K. Nandi, a dealer in Ultadanga.

 The demand reaches its peak during the Puja season as consumers tend to procure cylinders in advance. Besides, several Puja organisers and public associations organise community lunches during the festive days and they bank on LPG.

 Officials hinted that consumers might have to wait for two to three weeks to get a cylinder refilled. 

 ?The crisis is not in this state alone, it?s across the country. Even so, we are trying our best to maintain normal supply of cylinders during the Puja. We are trying to get gas from the Bijapur unit of GAIL and import three shiploads of crude oil from Malaysia. We appeal to our consumers to bear with us,? IOC deputy general manager De said. 

 He also urged consumers to ensure that gas is not wasted. ?As there is a crisis, I would like to urge consumers to be cautious in the use of gas, so it is not wasted,?? De added. ?The enforcement department has been asked to keep a close watch on dealers to prevent black-marketing.?

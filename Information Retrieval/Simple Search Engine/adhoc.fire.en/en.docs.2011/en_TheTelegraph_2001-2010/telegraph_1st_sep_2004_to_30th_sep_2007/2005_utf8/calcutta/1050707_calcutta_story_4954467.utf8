 Awake, the midnight meal beyond five-star confines. With partying till dawn becoming something of a habit with Calcutta, food stops are starting to lay the late-night table.

 As most restaurants close their kitchens by 11.30 pm, party-hoppers are often left hungry and dry ? a gap that lounges are stepping in to plug. Freshly tossed rice or noodles, Mongolian style, with choice of exotic English vegetables or meats in three different sauces, or basic Chinese and Indian, in a plush, laid-back ambience ? that?s on offer between midnight and three in the morning, post-Saturday night-outs at Platinum Lounge, adjoining Shisha.

 ?With nightlife picking up steam in Calcutta, we have observed a lack of late-night eating options in standalone properties within city limits,? says Pankaj Tandon, administration head, Shisha and Grain of Salt.

 Live Mongolian cuisine is now being served to Shisha regulars at the Platinum Lounge on Saturdays after midnight, on a first-come-first-served basis, with a meal costing approximately Rs 200 per person.

 Mongolian is the midnight mood at Red Kitchen amp; Lounge too. Every weekend, the restaurant in The Enclave at Alipore stays open till the adjacent lounge calls it a night. So while the liquor flows, so does the food. The live kitchen serves up exotic seafood, meats or a variety of greens with a plate of rice, noodles or rice noodles, at Rs 250 for vegetarian and Rs 275 for non-vegetarian minus seafood, and Rs 300 with seafood.

 ?After a long night of partying, everyone wants to grab a bite. So we thought keeping our popular Mongolian kitchen open for midnight revellers would definitely pay off,? says Bharat Dhamala, owner and director, Red Kitchen amp; Lounge.

 The midnight spread at B.E.D. (bars, entertainment and dining) is buffet-style with continental, Chinese and Indian options. Priced at Rs 199, the fare is extensive and available till dawn. ?The crowd is always there on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and hungry by the end of the night,? says Bhavna Sharma, public relations manager, B.E.D, opposite Max Mueller Bhavan.

 1.5 lakh for child death in mishap

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The compensation to be paid by an insurance company in case of the death of a child below 15 years in a road mishap should not be less than Rs 1.5 lakh, the high court ruled on Tuesday.

 ?The amount may be higher in specific cases, but the minimum should be Rs 1.5 lakh,? said the division bench of Justice Prabir Kumar Samanta and Justice Sailendra Prasad Talukdar.

 The bench has asked an insurance company to pay Rs 1.5 lakh, with nine per cent interest on the amount, to the parents of Puja Yadav, who died in a road accident on the Durgapur Expressway seven years ago. The girl was then five years old. 

 Puja and her parents, Dayanand and Manju, were returning to the city from Durgapur in a Maruti on January 31, 1998. The car collided with another vehicle near Dankuni, in Hooghly, and the girl died on the spot.

 The Yadavs, residents of Bowbazar, had approached the company they had insured their vehicle with and claimed Rs 1.5 lakh for the child?s death. 

 But the company awarded them only Rs 50,000, prompting the Yadavs to challenge the decision at the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Hooghly.

 In 2003, the tribunal endorsed the insurance company?s stand. 

 It ruled that the parents? claim could not be accepted, as the victim was a child and was not an earning member of the family. The tribunal added that the Yadavs could not demand such a large amount, as neither had been dependent on Puja.

 The couple then challenged the tribunal?s decision in the high court. 

 Appearing for the Yadavs, Krishanu Banik argued that the loss of a child in an accident could not be compensated with money. 

 ?But the insurance company?s decision to award Rs 50,000 only to the bereaved family was unjust and inhuman,? Banik observed.

 Pointing out that the Yadavs had lost everything with Puja?s death, the lawyer pleaded with the bench that the insurance company be ordered to pay a compensation package as demanded by his clients.

 K.K. Das, appearing for the company, opposed the petition and upheld the logic put across by the tribunal in striking down the Yadavs? demand. 

 ?The company has to follow certain rules in awarding compensation. The award for the Yadavs was based on those rules,? he argued.

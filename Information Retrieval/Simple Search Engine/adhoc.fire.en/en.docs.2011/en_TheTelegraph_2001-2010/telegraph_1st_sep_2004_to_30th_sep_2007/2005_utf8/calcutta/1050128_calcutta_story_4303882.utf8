The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cable census set to miss date

 A STAFF REPORTER

 D-day is almost here but the way out still seems some distance away. The state government?s cable census was supposed to have been completed by January 31, but like so many other things, the administration has failed to meet this deadline.

 The comprehensive survey was undertaken to determine the number of cable and satellite homes in the city and its fringes to address several issues, including under-declaration by operators. 

 On the lines of the model followed by the income-tax department, forms were sent to cable operators through local police stations, asking them to voluntarily disclose their connection numbers. 

 ?Kick-off was delayed due to minor hitches,? admitted an official associated with the survey. One of these was that the forms sent to operators were initially only in Bengali and carried no official letterhead or stamp. ?A section of operators was also opposed to such a survey, causing further roadblocks,? the official explained.

 The only hope may lie in the revised deadline ? circulated unofficially, of course ? February 15.

 ?A major part of the work is complete. Since it?s voluntary disclosure, we cannot take the figures as absolute. All the data has to be compiled and verified. This will take 10 to 12 days more,? the official added.

 Industry players, particularly broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSO) who have hopes riding on the government survey to end the frequent squabbles, are not giving up just yet.

 ?The government machinery will take its own time to do things, but we must look at its limitations, too,? offered an official of a city MSO.

 ?Such a census will certainly help the industry,? felt a broadcaster representative, ?but it remains to be seen whether the promises are delivered this time around or turn out to be empty.?

 Following a meeting convened by the state government and attended by all cable industry players in mid-October 2004, a deadline for the cable clean-up census was set as January 31, 2005. The state administration had also imposed an unofficial price freeze for the duration.

 Cable spats have continued to hold the viewer to ransom, most notably an almost-three-month ESPN STAR Sports blackout in over half of the city?s cable homes, that ended last week.

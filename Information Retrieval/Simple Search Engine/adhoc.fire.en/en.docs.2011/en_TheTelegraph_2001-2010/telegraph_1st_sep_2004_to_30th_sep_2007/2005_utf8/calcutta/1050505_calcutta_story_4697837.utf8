The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gunshot in phone outlet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?Chup!? The one-word threat rang out from one of the four goons who raided the cellphone shop on Lake Terrace on Wednesday afternoon.

 Salma Khatoon?s heart skipped a beat, but the chilling order to stay silent could not stop her from lunging forward to help her employer?s wife, Reshmi Mahnot, who had been shot.

 Khatoon, who works as an in-house mobile phone demonstrator in the distributorship owned by Vishal Mahnot, recounted how four youths, all in their 20s, shot 30-year-old Reshmi and injured several others before leaving the shop.

 ?I cannot understand why they did not make any attempt to rob the outlet of cash or handsets, despite having every opportunity to do so,? wondered Khatoon.

 Around 2.15 pm, the youths sauntered into the shop, posing as customers. One of them casually strayed away from the rest of the group, walking up to the showcase near the door. The other three went up to the counter and were greeted by Reshmi.

 ?She spoke to them in her usual courteous tone and asked what she could do for them. One of the youths said they wanted to purchase a cell phone and specified that their budget was Rs 5,000. He then pointed out a particular model that was displayed in the showcase,? Khatoon narrated.

 Even as Reshmi bent down to take out the handset the youths had asked to see, the youth who had taken up position near the door pulled down the shutters in a flash.

 ?Immediately, one of the youths standing at the counter whipped out a gun from under his shirt. Another brandished a chopper. As Reshmi ma?am stood up, there was a deafening explosion and she was hurled backwards. I lunged forward to catch her but the youth shoved me away,? Khatoon recounted.

 According to the witness, Reshmi?s father-in-law, Dalpat Mahnot, tried to intervene, but the youth with the chopper struck his outstretched arm.

 The youths then roughed up two other employees before pulling up the shutter and walking out, Khatoon added.

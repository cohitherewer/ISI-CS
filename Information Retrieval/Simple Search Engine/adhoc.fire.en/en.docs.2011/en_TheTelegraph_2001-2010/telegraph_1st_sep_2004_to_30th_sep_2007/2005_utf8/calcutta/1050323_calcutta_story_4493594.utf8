 Match-making, Memorial to mall

 - Spacious arcades preferred for arranged blind date, nuptial negotiations 

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Shopping for a suitable bride or groom for your first-born? Head for your favourite mall.

 Move over Victoria Memorial, the present pick for the arranged blind date between families is the neutral ground of popular hangouts. For nuptial negotiations, anonymous public places like the Memorial have long been in demand. Now, there are yuppie options to choose from. 

 And soon, the marriage mart will also have a conference hall for prospective in-laws engaged in the business of finding their child a life partner.

 Khushi Matrimonial, in New Alipore, is due to open early April. The meeting space for both ?sides? features a soundproof, 500-sq-ft conference room. While parents chat across the table, the boy and girl head to a soundproof ? but transparent ? cubicle at hand. ?People don?t want to arrange the first meeting at home. Here, both families can meet in a cosy environment,? explains Sanjay Dugur, behind Khushi Matrimonial.

 Scoring high on the cool card already are the malls around town. The first meeting follows introductions over phone by a family elder or a wedding designer. ?It isn?t certain the match will have a positive outcome. So, people prefer not to call strangers to their homes,? says Sanjay Agarwal of Solitaire, a wedding and event management firm. Malls work well for their open spaces. ?Also, it is known territory for both sides. They throw in distractions like window-shopping and affordable eateries,? adds Agarwal.

 Saturday evenings are when one is most likely to spot a to-be bride and groom, escorted by members of their families, at City Centre, confirms a spokesperson for the Salt Lake mall. ?Most are upwardly-mobile families from a business background? One look is enough to see that they are all meeting for the first time,? adds the spokesperson.

 Usually, the busiest spot is picked as the rendezvous point. Then, the hopeful couple is allowed to talk in private. The scale of any mall allows them to wander off while their parents break bread (and the ice). Forum, on Elgin Road, has similar options, and has witnessed strangers trying to find comfortable footing, says Malay Ghosh Dastidar, manager, Burp. Chaat, Mongolian, Mexican and Arabian fare are the usual accompaniments.

 A far cry from the jhal muri and phuchka that followed a stroll around Victoria Memorial. ?I met my would-be wife at the back gate of the Memorial. Our families thought it was best, as there was space to strike a private conversation,? says Sanjay Pachisia, who was married eight years ago, long before the matrimonial mall beckoned.

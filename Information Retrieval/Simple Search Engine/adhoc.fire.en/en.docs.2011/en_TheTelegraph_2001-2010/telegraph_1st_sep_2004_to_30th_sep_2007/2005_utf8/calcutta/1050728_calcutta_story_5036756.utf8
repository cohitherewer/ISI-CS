Soak yourself in the sheer luxury of complete beauty 

and hair care at Squeeze, the new unisex salon at the Minto Park end of Sarat 

Bose Road, inaugurated on July 25.

 Tollywood actress June, jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty and noted Sri Lankan beauty and hair specialist Ramani Fernando graced the occasion.

 This is the second salon of Squeeze, the first being at Bangalore. It is a joint venture with Sri Lankas acclaimed hair and beauty brand called Ramani Fernando salons. We are looking at providing complete care in hair, face, hands and feet, explains Sharmila Bose of Squeeze.

 From hair washes, highlights in cool colours, straightening to cuts and styles that are wearable and in ? Squeeze promises it all.

 The salon also ensures skin treatments that rejuvenate your skin and help combat wrinkles. Many people cannot maintain well-kept nails due to the habit of nail biting and other reasons; for them we have acrylic nails that can be kept for a stretch of about two weeks, smiles Ramani.

 The salon also boasts of three trained professionals from Sri Lanka. At Squeeze, we use the French product Sothys for skin and facial treatment, and hair products from Keune and Mujj, adds Sharmila.

 Colour coded

 From Prussian blue to molten mauve, warm caramel to pale rose ? myriad colours to glimmer on your wrists, neck and ears form a line of glass jewellery by Delhi-based firm Burnt Sienna. The pieces are made of hand-blown glass with metal infusions.

 Stones like turquoise, rose quartz, carneline and peridots are combined with the glass, but sparingly. We use stones minimally, since handmade glass jewellery is our forte, says Nandita Bose, the lady behind the brand that occupies space on racks in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh and Ludhiana.

 Every piece from Burnt Sienna is accompanied by a colour chart that explains the relevance of the particular hue. For instance, purple denotes wealth, pink stands for romance and white for purity. Theres no astrology involved in the colour stories and we dont expect people to adhere to them seriously. Its done for fun, as a value addition to the jewellery. The customer feels happy to know theres a colour therapy story working behind the piece she has bought, smiles Nandita.

 Deviating a little from her core competence, the young jeweller will soon introduce leather chord necklaces and fibre-glass earrings.

 Available in CIMA Design, Little India and Espee in Calcutta, the jewellery is priced between Rs 450 and Rs 800. 

 Craft call

 In an effort to promote urban patrons for traditional handicrafts, the Crafts Council of West Bengal is presenting Monsoon Magic at Artisana till August 5.

 This is to help craftsmen know the art of promoting their own products. The simulated market offers weavers and artisans an alternative marketplace to sell their items directly and in the process eliminate middlemen. The artisans also learn the art of setting up a store and selling their wares. Apart from rural craftsmen from all over West Bengal, the items have been sourced from the Crafts Council of other states, explains Sudatta Chakroborty from the organisation.

 The wide range of home accessories includes curtains, bedcovers, table linen, durries and blinds. The assortment of cushion covers in jute, kalamkari, kashida and patchwork are varied. Kitchen ware offers oven mittens, stone containers and a host of other knick knacks.

 Salwar suits and kurtis are embellished in chikan and zardosi, while scarves, kaftans, waistcoats, skirts, dupattas come in a splash of colours. The saris range from ikkat to tangail to katha.

 Prices start at Re 1.

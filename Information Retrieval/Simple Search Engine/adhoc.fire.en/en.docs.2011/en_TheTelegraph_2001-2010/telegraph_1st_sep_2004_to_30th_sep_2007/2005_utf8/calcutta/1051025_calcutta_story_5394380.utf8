 Officers and constables of a Howrah police station on Monday waded through water, at places neck-deep, or hired boats to reach relief material to the marooned in the lanes and bylanes of Liluah.

 Though the sky cleared and sun shone after six days of incessant downpour, Liluah and its adjoining areas remained under water on Monday. Anandanagar, Bhattanagar, Belgachia ? under Liluah police station ? are among the localities police patrolled in boats. 

 ?There was no option. The areas are inaccessible, as the roads are under water five to six feet deep,? said Akhil Kumar Roy, superintendent of police. A Metro team on Monday accompanied Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee, inspector-in-charge of Liluah thana, on one such relief mission to Anandanagar.

 Police have arranged seven small boats. Whoever wanted a lift was picked up and dropped at makeshift shelters in three local schools. Around 300 families are in peril as their homes have been submerged.

 ?This is a low land. Though the rain stopped today, water from adjacent Chandmari, Bhattanagar and Bamungachi is pouring in,? said inspector Mukherjee, pointing at a cluster of houses whose roofs were barely visible above the sheet of muddy water. 

 Mukherjee pressed all his six sub-inspectors, 11 assistant sub-inspectors and 40 constables into service. All leave has been cancelled. More than 2,000 members of 40-odd resistance groups under the police station have joined the rescue-and-relief mission.

 However, some people remain unmoved by the plight of their neighbours. ?I had asked my neighbour to allow my family to stay in his house till the water recedes. The neighbour lives in another flat with his family. But he demanded Rs 500. My husband is a daily-wager and we could not arrange the money,? narrated Jhuma Koley, whose house in Vidyasagar Pally has been swallowed by swirling water.

 While Jhuma is cursing her neighbour, Baidyanath Singh is blaming himself for the trouble he is now in. Baidyanath moved to Vidyasagar Pally from Colony No. 1 only three months ago.

 ?It was my biggest blunder. I bought this plot as it was very cheap and I wanted to have a home of my own instead of staying in a rented house all my life. No one told me this area was so low,? Baidyanath rued. 

 Ignorant of the travails his parents are going through, Baidyanath?s four-year-old son Somnath was enjoying every moment of being waterlogged. The Singhs have not moved to a safer location as they are afraid of keeping their household goods unprotected.

 Till Sunday, Liluah police station had shifted 75 families to the temporary relief centres. ?I contacted some businessmen and requested them to supply us essential food items for the victims. They responded positively and sent gur, muri, chira and batasha,? inspector Mukherjee said. 

 Police superintendent Roy said his officers were keeping a ?strict vigil? on the law and order situation.

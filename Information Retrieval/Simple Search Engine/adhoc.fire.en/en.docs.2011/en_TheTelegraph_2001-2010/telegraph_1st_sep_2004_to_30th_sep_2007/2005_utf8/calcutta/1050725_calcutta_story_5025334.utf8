The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Into the netherworld

 In celebration of the birth centenary of the renowned playwright and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, Theatrecian stages No Exit, which records an unnatural encounter among three recently dead strangers. A faithful adaptation of Huis Clos, Sartre?s play in French, it explores the conflicting relationships that develop among the three when they find themselves thrust together in hell. The play offers an exceptional vision of hell and also of the world as it appears to the inhabitants of hell. In No Exit, hell is visualised as a hotel where the dead are allotted different rooms. Comprising four characters ? the three dead occupants and their valet ? the action of the play is built around a peculiar combination of props and stage devices consisting of a fireplace, an atrocious bronze figure, an ordinary paper knife and an eccentric bell. The cast includes Bornila Chatterjee, Ronjini Chakrabarty, Soumak Kanti De Biswas and Tanaji Dasgupta. Direction: Tathagata Singha.

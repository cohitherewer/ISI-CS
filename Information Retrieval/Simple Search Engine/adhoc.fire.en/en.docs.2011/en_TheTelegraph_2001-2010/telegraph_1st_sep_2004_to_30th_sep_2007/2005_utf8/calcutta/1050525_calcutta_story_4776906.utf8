 Sacred sign saviour 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 The wheel is one of 

 the eight auspicious symbols that 

 originated in either 

 Tibet or India and have been embraced by the Chinese in Feng Shui. Each of these eight symbols represents one aspect of life. The wheel stands for the wheel of life, truth and cosmic energy

Q: My neighbour has placed two dagger-like objects on either side of her entrance and these point directly at my flat. She says that the daggers are guarding her flat and thus refuses to remove them. I feel threatened by the power of the sharp objects. Please suggest a solution. 

 Sujata 

 The Solution: You can overcome the negative energy of the pointed daggers flowing towards your flat by placing an image of god above the doorway. A cloth panel with embroidered symbols of god or eight auspicious objects also work as an excellent antidote when placed above the doorway. They also shower blessings on the home and on each individual stepping under this sacred entrance. 

 These eight objects have their origin in India and Tibet but have been embraced by Feng Shui. The mystic knot signifies long-term good fortune; the canopy is a powerful symbol of protection from harmful influences; the wheel represents the wheel of life, truth and cosmic energy; the vase contains the nectar of bliss and contentment; double fish signifies material riches; lotus signifies purity; the jar symbolises accumulation of family prosperity and the conch signifies travel luck. Displaying all eight objects together is important because they not only bring material luck but also provide mental peace and happiness.

 Q: I have a small lawn behind my house where a wide variety of plants grow. I have heard its auspicious to have jade plants in the house. Can you let me know its attributes and probable placements?

 Rakesh Malhotra

 The Solution: Green jade plant is valued by the Chinese because its leaves resemble the precious jade stone and its presence in the house is considered auspicious. Placed near the entrance they invite fortune and prosperity, and energise monetary luck when placed in the south-east. Money plant is a good substitute for jade. But you should ensure that they grow on their own and not with support from trees or walls, where they become parasitic and lose their positive qualities.

 Q: My ground-floor flat has a large room in the south-west, which stretches all the way to the south-east corner. I would like to convert this room into a chamber for my son who will start practising as a doctor this year. He doesnt want to divide the room into two parts and yet have separate visitors area in the east. The eastern side of the room has large windows and erecting a wall from this side will block sun rays from entering the south-west part of his chamber. Please suggest a solution.

 Sapna Chatterjee

 The Solution: He should not be deprived of sun rays entering his room by any means, because along with positive energy they bring new opportunities in life. The best solution would be to demarcate the visitors area by placing screens made of carved wood or handmade paper that do not extend from the floor to the ceiling. These delicate screens will not only add beauty to the room by allowing the suns rays to filter through them, but will also act as delicate dividers and give him and his patients the required privacy. 

 Q: I am a college student born in the year of the rooster. This being the year of the rooster, can I energise any part of the house so that it brings me special luck?

 Tapan Ray

 The Solution: You can place images of the rooster in the western part of the house, which falls between 247.5 degrees and 277.5 degrees. Its inherent element is metal and so displaying sculptures of the rooster in metal or ceramic with a rich gold or silver engraving will be the best way of energising your Chi. Occupying a room in the west is another way of attracting good luck. The sectors that are associated with the snake and the ox are also beneficial for rooster people. These are south and south-east for snake and north and north-east for ox.

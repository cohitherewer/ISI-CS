Theres good news for movie buffs ? young and old. With multiplex ticket pricing climbing higher with every big release, theres finally some respite for the pocket. As part of its first anniversary celebrations, 89 Cinemas, has come up with three membership cards to make movie-watching economically more viable.

 The three cards, targeted at three very different sections of society, not only gives discounts on movie tickets but also rustles up a whole bunch of exciting offers at the Swabhumi multiplex in the year ahead.

 Right from the time we started, we have come up with several value propositions, says Prashant Srivastava, general manager of 89 Cinemas. We did help rationalise the prices of the tickets when we entered the multiplex market. Our campaigns, like the Rs 50 tickets, have also worked well with the viewers. And the price-sensitive market that Calcutta is, we expect a very good response to the three cards we are launching.

 The first of the three cards for senior citizens, called Senior Cinezen, gives a 60 per cent discount on tickets to viewers above 60 years.

 The youth card, named Campus 89, applicable only for school and college students, gives a 25 per cent discount on ticket prices.

 And the Priceless card, billed as the super-saver deal, offers a 30 per cent discount to a family of four.

 To grab the cards, to be launched on Friday, one needs to fill up an application form and provide the necessary details. 

 We would be very strict with the proof of age for the senior citizen card, adds Prashant. 

 As for the campus card, we have our own list of registered schools and colleges and would only entertain students from those institutions. They need to bring in their school or college ID cards and the marksheet of their last annual exam. The priceless card, of course, is open to all. We would try our best to avoid misuse of the card, which has become quite a habit with cell phone users. The photo-cards will ensure that the cards are only used by the owners.

 though 89 Cinemas expects a healthy response to all the cards, it is the one for the senior people that its is most excited about.

 Such a move will give us a distinctive positioning, feels Prashant. They are one section of people who are always neglected with their children leaving them for studies or jobs. So such a card membership will mean a sense of involvement and belonging for them.

 And with pockets of Salt Lake fast resembling something of an old-age home, the target audience is obvious. With Rs 500 as application fee, the senior citzens need to just visit the multiplex a minimum of four times a year to recover the money, he added.

 While the student application fee is also Rs 500, its Rs 3,000 for the Priceless card. So for those who prefer to stay at the movies, life could just get a bit cheaper.

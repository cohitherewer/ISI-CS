 You share your birthday with...

 Harrison Ford 

You are attractive, mild and caring, and full of youthful spirit and childlike behaviour. You are a quick learner, with a keen eye and talented hands. You usually succeed in whatever you apply your mind to. You enjoy socialising, have a knack of drawing people into a conversation and livening up the party. You are conservative in your spending. ? Kusum Bhandari

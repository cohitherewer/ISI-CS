 Neuro unit gets civic land

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya cleared the proposal to hand over 32 cottahs to the Neuroscience Foundation on Wednesday to set up a state-of-the-art neuroscience hospital in Calcutta. 

 The proposal for the transfer of land in Mullickbazar, at 185/1, AJC Bose Road, was ratified at the civic house meeting on Wednesday.

 The project could have been implemented much earlier had former mayor Subrata Mukherjee cleared the handover of the land.

 The neuroscience centre and hospital will be a joint venture of the state government, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Neuroscience Foundation. The state government?s contribution will be Rs 3 lakh.

 The CMC?s contribution to the project will only be the leasehold land. The CMC has calculated the lease rate at Rs 20 lakh per cottah for 33 years. The total lease value at this rate turns out to be Rs 6.4 crore. 

 ?Instead of collecting lease value from Neuroscience Foundation, we are investing the sum of Rs 6.4 crore as the CMC?s share in the joint-venture project,? said mayor Bhattacharya. 

 The neuroscience hospital will have specialised facilities for neurosurgery, neuro-anaesthesia, neuro-radiology, neuro-pathology, neuro-rehabilitation and neuro-psychiatry. The institute will carry out research in neurological sciences

 According to the mayor, the CMC will enjoy 24.5 per cent of the equity share capital of the company and eight per cent bed reservation for free treatment against the lease value of the land. 

 Civic councillors and employees will be entitled to these facilities. For others, the free bed facilities may be available at the recommendation of the CMC.

 Of the board of directors of the company, three will be from the CMC. 

 The three ex-officio directors of the institution from the CMC will be the municipal commissioner and the mayoral council members of health and slum development.

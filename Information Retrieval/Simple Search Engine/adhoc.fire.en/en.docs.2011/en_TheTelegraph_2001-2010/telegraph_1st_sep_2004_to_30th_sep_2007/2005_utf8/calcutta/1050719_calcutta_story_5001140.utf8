 A question of values

 - TIPS ON GOOD PARENTING

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Next time your child skips school because of a marriage in the family, don?t shoot off a letter to the principal, saying: ? My daughter/son had a fever, coupled with stomach ache?. For, such a letter only encourages your little one to tell a lie, not to face the truth.

 Or, if your child trips and suffers a bad bruise on the knee, don?t stamp on the floor to pacify him/her. Your act will harm the child more than the floor. He/she will grow up learning that a ?floor? must be blamed for every fall in life.

 There are several other instances of how parents ?unknowingly? encourage children to pick up bad habits and wrong attitudes towards life. To reverse the trend, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, a deemed university, is introducing a full-time postgraduate course for parents on how to bring up children.

 The required qualification for enrolling in the course, due to start in September in Belur, is graduation.

 ?We need to train our parents in producing good citizens,? said vice-chancellor Swami Atmapriyananda. ?Many of our parents have high academic qualifications, but they are not always aware of certain important values of life. Our one-and-a-half-year course is aimed at inculcating these values in the parents,? he added.

 Broadly, the teachings of Swami Vivekananda will form the foundation of the course. Truthfulness and purity of mind are some of the ideals that every parent will be asked to practise. ?These values can boost the confidence of the younger generation,? the monk observed.

 However, a considerable part of the curriculum will focus on how to motivate a child to develop the right habits, which will help him/her emerge successful in life.

 If an engineer, after having excelled in exams, fails to make a mark during the job interview, the failure can be traced to ?bad parenting?. Ability to communicate develops one?s understanding on how to make oneself presentable in various situations. But this needs to be taught by parents from an early stage, the vice-chancellor explained.

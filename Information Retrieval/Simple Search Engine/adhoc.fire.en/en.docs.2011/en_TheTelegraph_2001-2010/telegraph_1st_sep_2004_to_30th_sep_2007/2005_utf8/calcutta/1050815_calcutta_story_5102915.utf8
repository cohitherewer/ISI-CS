 After having catered to fashion markets in Italy and France for close to a decade, designer Madhu Khaitan has now decided to turn her attention to domestic demand. And so, shes opened a studio called Ciao Bella at 3, Queens Park. 

 Inaugurated last month, the plush store houses Madhus blend of western designs and Indian fabrics. The collection on the racks now boasts bridal, evening and pr?t wear for women. Cocktail, dinner and bridal saris, light and heavy lehngas and a stunning range of evening and bridal kurtas in silk-based fabrics form the line.

 My collection is a mix of the traditional and the contemporary, the subtle and the funky, says the designer.

 A palette of myriad hues has been used to create a colour story with various combinations. The clothes are also open to customisation. 

 Kurta craft

 Designer Shagun Agarwal, who retails from her boutique Darshika at 18/53, Dover Lane, has been creating mens kurtas for the past seven years.

 A wide array of kurta-pyjama sets, ranging from the casual to the grand, comes in fabrics like cotton, cotton silk, raw silk, dupion, crepe and georgette. These are embellished with aari, zardosi, kantha stitch, spring work and machine embroidery, with touches of stones and kasab.

 The kurtas are often textured with bidding and thread work to give them a more ethnic and elegant look.

 The colour scheme draws on the maroon, electric blue, burnt yellow, aqua and shades of white and cream. The kurta-pyjama sets start at Rs 550 and go up to Rs 3,500.

 Tanishq adds some shine to the festive season by launching an all-new collection of modern and traditional jewellery. The collection ? plain gold and studded jewellery ? has been inspired by the special bond between a brother and sister. With Raksha Bandhan round the corner, its the ideal gift option for a brother to his sister, says a spokesperson.

 The collection comprises trendy pendants, earrings and rings innovatively designed and patterned. The price tag stars at Rs 2,000.

 We understand the Indian woman and provide her with jewellery for every occasion, understanding both her traditional and contemporary aspirations and desires, claims Tanishq brand manager Harman Dhillon.

 Bday block

 Thirty five years ago it started as a creative enterprise with 25 saris. Today, it is a household brand name for block prints in Calcutta. From taant to an extensive range of handlooms in unusual block prints, folk and tribal art forms, Kanishkas has come a long way.

 Right from the initial stages, we aspired to be different from the regular designs, prints and motifs in saris. It was also an endeavour to give traditional weaves their due in the fashion circuit. After all, handloom has its own authenticity and elegance that can never be duplicated with any other fabric, says Nandita Raja of Kanishkas.

 The collection comprises an exclusive assortment of Rajasthani kota, khadi from Andhra Pradesh, Bengal taant, Vidarbhas and Maheshwaris from Madhya Pradesh, and also fabrics from Orissa and Bihar.

 Way back when we started, the folk arts adorned calendars and paintings. We then took up the challenge of bringing these interesting motifs to the domain of textiles. Ancient Devanagri scripts, Pali and Chinese scripts, too, have been an inspiration, says Nandita.

 Tussars in block prints further combined with kantha stitch, batik and bandhni promise to make heads turn. The authentic Kotpats of Orissa come in vibrant splashes.

 The demand from menfolk accompanying the women to the showroom made us think on the mens collection, reveals Nandita, pointing to an exclusive range of kurtas, summer wear in crepe, khaddar and mulmul and winter wear in interesting weaves.

 The price of the saris starts at Rs 350 and goes up to a few thousand. The mens wear ranges from Rs 450 to Rs1,500.

 We are also contemplating a research and development institution where block makers, dyers and weavers shall sit under one roof to create and develop traditional handloom, concludes Nandita.

 Festive feast

 With rakhis and gifts making the rounds of city markets, Cakes unveiled its Raksha Bandhan confectionery selection at its Salt Lake outlet on Wednesday.

 City-based model Sudipta tied rakhis on the children of Prayasam, an NGO, while they in turn spread the bond of love by tying rakhis on all present.

 Dakabuko, a group of musical talents comprising slum children from the NGO, enthralled the audience with a repertoire of songs, accompanied by innovative instruments. The band sang some self-composed numbers and Bhalo lage swapner mayajal bunte from Parash Pathar.

 We want to create awareness for a cleaner and healthier Calcutta. And what better medium than music? asked Purnima Deyashi, a member of the band.

 Santanu Guha Thakurta of Cakes said: We are celebrating the launch of this range of confectionery by trying to bring a smile to the faces of these talented kids in whatever way we possibly can.

 The new range is an assortment of cakes, pastries, cookies, pizzas, pies, sandwiches, patties and strudels.

 The savouries include Exotic Potato Beans Surprise, Cheese Coleslaw Sandwich, Thai Paneer Strudel and Round Pizza Mexicana.

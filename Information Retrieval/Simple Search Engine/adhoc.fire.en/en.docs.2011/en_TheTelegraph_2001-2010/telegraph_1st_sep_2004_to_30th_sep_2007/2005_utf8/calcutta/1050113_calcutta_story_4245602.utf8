 Away from bark brigade: Policemen are being driven up the wall in their attempt 

to stop street dogs from barking in the vicinity of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s 

residence (Curb criminals, muzzle mongrels, December 15). Building a Raj Bhavan-like 

residence for him seems to be the only solution. That would help our intellectual 

chief minister concentrate on his literary pursuits in peace after the day?s mundane 

work.

The report ?Coming to the rescue of birds and beasts?, 

December 13, highlights how ?effectively? the NGOs are working for the welfare 

of different species of birds and animals in our state. 

 The volunteers of most NGOs are ignorant about the habitats and food habits of the injured, orphaned and abandoned birds and animals they try to rescue. It is not surprising that their ham-handed attempts are often useless. They end up toying with the lives of the creatures. 

 The volunteers can be compared with quacks; they take more lives than they save. In this regard, I would like to share my own experience. About five years ago, I took care of a baby martin for a few days. One day, to rid the martin of lice, I sprinkled raw phenyl on it. It died within 10 minutes. 

 Needless to say, I had no intention of harming the bird in any way, but due to my ignorance, it died. Most volunteers of NGOs act in the same manner. 

 It is good to know that the state government is planning to introduce a training programme for NGOs. But such programmes need to be continued for years to be effective. Only after going through several training sessions would the volunteers be in a position to handle rescue work efficiently. 

 I also urge NGOs engaged in the rescue and rehabilitation of animals and birds to expand their activities. They may campaign to increase mass awareness about prevention of cruelty against animals and birds. They may also undertake sterilisation or vaccination programmes for stray dogs, cats and monkeys. 

 The government, on its part, should try to make people aware of the several wildlife rescue centres run by the forest department.

The report ?Driver on cell, car kills man?, December 14, made for disturbing reading. The latest mishap in front of former chief minister Jyoti Basu?s residence Indira Bhavan is a cause for serious concern. With the use of cellular phones on the rise, accidents like that could become commonplace. The culprit needs to be caught and punished severely to set a precedent. Only the threat of drastic action will prevent people from using cellphones while driving.

Apropos the article ?Calamity call for road safety?, 

December 15, it is shocking to read about accidents which have happened because 

the drivers were callously speaking on cellular phones. The problem has been a 

constant since the advent of mobile phones and is just growing in magnitude every 

day. I strongly feel that a tough law needs to introduced and implemented to prevent 

more such deaths.

Apropos the report ?Priceless head stolen?, December 30, it is shocking that a priceless Buddha head has been stolen from Indian Museum. It is distressing that the theft occurred in the presence of security guards and at a time when the gallery was crowded. What then is the use of having security guards? The authorities obviously haven?t learnt from the disappearance of an old oil painting from the archives. 

Rimli Datta, 

Salt Lake. 

It is amazing how a fifth-century Buddha head could 

be stolen from under the noses of security officials of Indian Museum. Only gross 

negligence of duty could have resulted in such a theft. It is only appropriate 

that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asked for a thorough probe into the matter. 

The theft is no less shocking to us than the theft of the Nobel medal from Santiniketan. 

Sujit Kumar Sen Gupta, 

Manirampur. 

Police authorities are solely to blame for the condition of Sanatan Murmu (Rape-slur cop turns mad, December 16). The state human rights commission should take up his case. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

Beleghata. 

 It is disheartening that the days of eve teasing and assault on women are making a comeback in the city (NRI wards off attackers, December 13). The experiences of the New York-based non-resident Indian and the Polish women who was teased near Gariahat during Pujas is a slur on the reputation of Calcutta. Thankfully, police saved the city further embarrassment by taking prompt action. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

The state transport minister?s announcement that trams are going to get a fresh lease of life is most welcome (Breath of life for tramcar, December 21). Trams are one of the most important pollution-free modes of conveyance and so their services need to extended rather than curtailed. Even developed countries prefer trams to buses. The only reason people here prefer buses is because trams are not run properly. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala.

The report ?Honour tag in goon grab?, December 24, should serve as an eye-opener to the authorities who suspend or sack errant employees without considering whether the errors were intentional or not. Constable Nityananda Roy may have been reinstated, but who will compensate for what he went through during suspension? 

Kajal Chatterjee,

Sodepore. 

The article ?Relook at mercy killing?, December 10, was timely. Euthanasia is permitted in many countries. In our country, too, members of religious groups embrace death by abstaining from food and water. Euthanasia should be immediately legalised in India. 

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

Bandpur. 

Apropos your report ?Warning on unstable soil?, December 27, the depletion of groundwater diminishes the strength of alluvium soil on which Calcutta is built. This makes the city more vulnerable to damage due to earthquakes.. 

Amartya Kumar Bhattacharya,

Shibpur.

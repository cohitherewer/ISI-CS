The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Haunt from the past

 The Indian adaptation of Ariel Dorfmans Reader, Wide Aisles production is all the more relevant in todays sensitive and fragile global environment. Gripped by fears of terror attacks, stringent measures are being imposed by governments, curbing people?s personal freedom. Sometimes, state control over people?s lives even extends to repression of individual thought and opinion. In the play, the protagonist, Avinash Nathan, is a censor, working in an industry, controlled by an authoritarian regime based on thought-policing. He receives a rough draft of a screenplay by Dev Mallik, an unknown writer. When Nathan sees that its story bears an uncanny resemblance with that of his own life, he becomes paranoid that someone ? his dead wife, his rebellious son, his secretary (with whom he had an affair), or his boss ? is conspiring to ruin him by exposing his murky past. And, when the events in Mallik?s screenplay begin to come horribly true, Nathan lapses into despair and starts to lose his sanity, unable to distinguish between reality and fiction. Direction: Anirudh Nair. Presented in collaboration with Theatrecian and Coffee Pai Caf?. Hosted by McDowell?s Signature, Patton and Open Doors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Drape drool and leather weather

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Indo-western 

or fusion wear might have found favour with most small boutiques mushrooming around 

town, but here?s one designer who has consciously stayed away from the clich?. 

Ethnic wear is fashion designer Anita Sureka?s forte, one that she has experimented 

with over the past decade. 

 Initially catering to a loyal clientele from her residence, Anita opened her own boutique called Kavya in New Alipore about six years ago. And it was February 4 last year that saw her shifting to a more plush address near Park Street. The new studio, also called Kavya, on 44A Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, will celebrate its first anniversary on Friday. The designer has chosen the occasion to thank her ?valued customers? with some ?special offers? between February 4 and 6. The offers include discounts up to 70 per cent on select pieces.

 While she also does limited editions of salwar 

suits and tops, saris and lehngas are Anita?s strong point. The anniversary 

display features a variety of saris, mostly in georgette and crepe. Pink plays 

a major role in the palette. Other vibrant hues are also prominent. 

 The saris have been embellished with a wide variety 

of embroidery, both hand and machine work. ?Embroidery always highlights my creations. 

I like to mix and match various kinds of embroideries in one piece,? says Anita. 

So, it?s not uncommon to find zardosi, resham and kantha vying 

for attention in her saris. These are combined with embellishments like stones 

and beads, while sequins are used sparingly.

Her lehngas usually come in heavy fabrics like 

jamevar, but one also finds the use of georgette and jute. There are bridal 

as well as party wear lehngas. The range is priced Rs 5,000 onwards. The 

saris are priced at Rs 3,000 and above, while salwar sets start at around 

Rs 2,000.

 Silk smooth

 Kanishka?s on Dover Lane has been involved in reviving traditional temple designs, based on extensive research over the past few years. Till February 5, it is presenting an exhibition of traditional temple saris of southern India, labelled Southern Weaves.

 The collection has taken almost two years to evolve. Detailed supervision at the weaving stage has ensured that each silk sari comes out of the loom with a perfect combination of colour schemes and designs. Most of the designs have adhered to the same form in which they were woven several years ago. 

 The colour palette is rich with unusual combinations like green and maroon, mustard and gold, magenta with yellow and green, turquoise with gold and silver, believed to be auspicious temple shades. 

 Woven zari and plain borders set off against plain, striped or checked bodies comprise a stunning range. Each sari bears the mark of master weavers.

 Macho gear

 If dhoom machale is the mantra you live by, then you can?t possibly miss the range of jackets inspired by the film Dhoom. Shock at Metro Plaza (Shops 3043 and 3074) has a range of Dhoom jackets on offer, which, claim the owners, are based on the look flaunted by Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham in the movie. 

 Priced at Rs 1,500 upwards, the jackets in screaming bright colours with bold patchwork could well be a young biker?s dream gear.

 ?Street fashion is influenced largely by Bollywood and these jackets are bound to strike a chord,? says owner Anand Damani. A lot of customers are queuing up with pictures of John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan in the jackets to ensure that they have the right colour combination, adds Damani. 

 While most are opting for the ?life in the fast lane? look, long jackets that resemble overcoats are also up for grabs at the store, which imports most of the stuff from Southeast Asia. 

 Top of the pops, however, is the foam leather range, just right for the brief Calcutta winter. 

 Most of the gear for both men and women is priced between Rs 1,100 and Rs 3,500.

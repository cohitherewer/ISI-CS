 Hopes rise and crash with flyover 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A green coconut vendor sits at the intersection of Kalakar Street and Kali Krishna Tagore Street, in Burrabazar, where a pile of rubble lay even a few days ago. 

 Burrabazar residents are not happy that the heap has been removed, since it had once raised hopes of solving the traffic problems of the area. 

 It was the relic of the foundation stone of a flyover, laid two years ago.

 ?Around two years back, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had laid the foundation stone there. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty was present at the function. Their message made us all very happy. They had promised that the flyover would solve all our problems,? said Amit Kumar Pandey, joint general secretary of Burrabazar Nagarik Front.

 According to Pandey, the proposed flyover remained a dream, and a few months ago, a truck that was backing up at night accidentally demolished the foundation stone. 

 Local residents alleged that the errant truck driver was not penalised because he had bribed the traffic constables patrolling the area that night. Since then, the debris had remained, till a few days ago.

 ?The proposed flyover would have connected Girish Park with Howrah bridge, effectively eliminating some of the rush that makes the area prone to traffic snarls,? Pandey said on Monday.

 Officers of Burrabazar police station said they had no knowledge of the foundation stone. The Howrah Bridge Traffic Guard, under whose jurisdiction the road intersection falls, could not shed any light on the issue, either.

 Sudhangsu Sil, local CPM legislator, spoke over the telephone from Delhi. 

 ?Work on the Burrabazar flyover had started when I was a member of the mayor?s council, in the year 1999,? he said with a laugh. 

 ?The work did not progress very far, thanks to some objections raised by mayor Subrata Mukherjee. He had claimed then that work had been started without proper planning. Nevertheless, we are determined to complete the flyover at Burrabazar,? Sil said.

 ?We are aware that it will alleviate the problems faced by local traders. It will permanently remove the Burrabazar traffic bottleneck, facilitating smooth movement in and out of the city. Although the project is delayed, we can?t be held responsible for it,? Sil added.

 ?I had raised some logical objections,? Subrata Mukherjee countered. 

 ?The state government?s transport department had entered into an agreement with a private agency for the completion of the flyover, on the condition that the government will collect the money through taxes over a period of 30 years. When the road belongs to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, they cannot make any such deal,? the mayor pointed out. 

 He also asserted that the flyover would not solve any traffic problem, since only small vehicles would use it. 

 The government has built a truck terminal at Kona and plans to shift the existing wholesale market. Thereafter, the flyover will be rendered redundant, he claimed.

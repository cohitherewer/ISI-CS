The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bureau to curb wildlife crime

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Earlier this week, a CID team confiscated five elephant tusks and arrested five persons in Sonarpur. It was not an isolated incident. Since January, police have made over a dozen seizures across Calcutta. The haul included skins and organs of wild animals killed by poachers in various forests of Bengal. The city was a transit stopover for the rackets dealing in the banned items.

 Alarmed over the growing incidents of wildlife poaching and importance of Calcutta in the smuggling network, the state government is planning to set up a wildlife crime control bureau.

 ?We have sent a detailed proposal to the home department and final discussions will be held soon,? Kartick Chandra Gayen, principal chief conservator of forest, wildlife wing, told Metro on Wednesday.

 The state wildlife board had approved of the idea of forming the bureau at its last meeting. Officials said the bureau, to be headquartered in Calcutta, would be the nodal agency for preventing wildlife crime and bringing the guilty to book. It will also be involved in gathering information about poachers and smugglers. 

 ?The bureau will appoint trained personnel who will raid forests to nab poachers,? said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden. Apart from forest officials, representatives of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), detective department of the city police, customs and Border Security Force may be inducted into the bureau.

 In addition to the bureau, a task force is being planned for the two tiger reserves in the state ? the Sunderbans and Buxa.

 Bengal has long been on the transit route of poachers and smugglers across the country dealing in animal skins and parts. The items are brought to Calcutta and Siliguri, from where they are taken to Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Through Nepal, the articles are smuggled to China, through Tibet. 

 ?The crime has spawned a network spread across the subcontinent and even beyond. Unless all the agencies involved coordinate, it can never be curbed,? an official pointed out.

 Rhino horns, ivory and skins of tiger, leopard and other animals are being smuggled out of the country through Bengal. Recently, forest officials have seized six rhino horns, 5,000 turtles, 11,000 birds, two tiger skins and several elephant tusks.

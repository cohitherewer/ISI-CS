 Alliance Francaise de Calcutta (AFC) is no more. Not at least at its registered address at Khaleel Munzil. Nor in the documents of the Alliance Francaise de Paris or the Embassy of France in India.

 Long live The French Association of Calcutta. 

 A change of guard took place at what has been the meeting-place for all lovers of France and its way of life and language in the city.

 ?This is a new beginning after 65 years of our presence in Calcutta,? announced Nicolas Blasquez, who takes over as director of The French Association of Calcutta, after resigning as director of the earlier institution. Twelve eminent citizens, including musician-filmmaker Anjan Dutt, publisher Naveen Kishore and CIMA Gallery director Pratiti Basu Sarkar, have formed the new council of administration.

 It was the refusal of the former administrative board to hold elections and take in new members that became the bone of contention. ?Calcutta deserves much better facilities, more students and members. But for that they (AFC board members under president, Professor Sudeshna Chakrabarti) have to play together. We can?t keep organising cultural programmes while they just sit there, distributing cards among friends. This is not a private club,? said Jean-Claude Tribolet, counsellor for culture, science and technology, with the French Embassy in India. 

 Tribolet had come down to Calcutta to give a wake-up call to the board. ?After one year, nothing happened and I came again to give them a deadline of three months. Since we can?t force them to change, we decided to part ways.?

 For seven-eight years, the Alliance Francaise de Paris has been pressing the Calcutta chapter to accept its revised statute. ?The meetings had become a masquerade. For the last two years, there were no elections. The membership count had been frozen at 150, while the waiting list had reached 400. This could not continue. Since they hold the name (AFC) as a registered society, we had to find another name. But the logo remains ours as it is the property of Alliance Francaise de Paris,? stated the director, who has been the driving force.

 Deputy director, cultural events, Emanuelle De Decker is now looking forward to organising a bigger World Music Day on June 21. ?This will be our first event under the new banner. With fresh faces coming in, we are forming new local contacts and can show a young and dynamic face of France,? she smiled. 

 The Calcutta centre now becoming a priority for the embassy for the next three years, good things are surely on the anvil.

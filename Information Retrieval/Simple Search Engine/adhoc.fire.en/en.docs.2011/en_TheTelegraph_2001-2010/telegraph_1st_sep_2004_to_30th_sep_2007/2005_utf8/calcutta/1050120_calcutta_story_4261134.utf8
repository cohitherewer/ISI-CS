 Life skills, world standards

 - Seven-star school to build good students, sportspersons

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Providers of total management solutions in the field of education, Global Education Management Systems (GEMS), launched an international school in the city on Saturday.

 Pailan World School, being built on a 40-acre plot at a cost of Rs 100 crore, will start functioning from April. The primary section of the seven-star school will have day-boarding facilities, while the high school will be residential. 

 Westfields Sports, a leading Australian sports academy, will provide consultancy to build the sporting skills of students.

 ?The idea is not just to produce good students, but also good sportspersons, who can represent the country in any sport at the highest level,? said a senior Pailan group official.

 ?The choice parents make on their children?s education is one of the most important decisions in their lives. In today?s competitive age, it becomes critical to supplement world-class academic education with all-round personality development with a view to teaching students life skills,? Shashank Vira, chief operating officer of GEMS India, said.

 ?While our focus remains on managing schools owned by others, we intend to open our own schools as well,? he added.

 GEMS officials said the company?s internal research team will evaluate the performance of all their schools in over 100 countries, including the UK, the US, the UAE, Qatar and countries in Europe. Analysing current trends in education and laying emphasis on cultivating skills, ethics and confidence among students will be the focus, the officials said.

 ?India is a very large education market, but it is dominated by the state and the community sector. However, the past few years have seen a growth of private schools, reflecting a change in the economy and mindset. This has inspired GEMS? foray into India. With 35 years of experience in managing schools, the company is committed to bringing India on the world education map,? said John Mason, head of Asian schools, GEMS Worldwide.

 The Pailan institute will be the third GEMS-managed school in the country after British International School, Peddapuram (Andhra Pradesh) and Cambridge International School for Girls, Jalandhar (Punjab).

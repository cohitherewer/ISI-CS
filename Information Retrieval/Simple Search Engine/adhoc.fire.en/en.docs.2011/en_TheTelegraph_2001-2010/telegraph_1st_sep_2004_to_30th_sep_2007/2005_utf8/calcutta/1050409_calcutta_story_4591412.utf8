 Superior surgery technique for hips

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For 60-year-old Sushmita Sarkar (name changed on request), a traditional hip replacement would have meant leading a restricted life and running the risk of dislocation of the artificial hip joint.

 But, thanks to an advanced process of hip replacement surgery that was performed on her at Peerless Hospital and B.K. Roy Research Centre on Friday, Sarkar faces a minimal risk of dislocation.

 Doctors at the hospital claimed that this was the first time that an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) had been carried out in eastern India. As Sarkar had fractured her hip bone, only a partial ASR was carried out on her.

 Doctors say ASR is superior to the conventional hip replacement surgery for two reasons. First, the entire hip is not removed, only the affected portion is replaced. Second, the portion that is replaced is made of metal, which ensures that it lasts longer than the plastic material used in a conventional surgery.

 P.K. Banerji, head of the department of orthopaedics at Peerless Hospital, operated on Sarkar on Friday, along with Luca Marega, an expert in hip replacement surgery from Italy.

 ?Hip replacement surgery is being conducted since 1963 but it has worked effectively only for elderly people, as the replaced hip does not last very long. For younger people, there was a need for a replacement which would have a longer life-span. This has been provided by ASR,? Banerji pointed out. 

 He added that post-ASR surgery, the patient can move freely and even take to sports like squash, as the risk of dislocation is almost nil. ?It is safe for pregnant women, too,? he elaborated.

 Marega said: ?The surgery is more difficult to perform on Indian patients than on Europeans, as Indians? bones are more slender. In that sense, Friday?s surgery was an even more challenging task.? Indians, he said, also complicated matters by avoiding a consultation during the initial stage of the disease.

 Doctors warned that the operation theatre where the ASR surgery is performed must be totally germ-free to prevent the patient from catching an infection.

 Banerji informed that the price of the equipment for ASR, imported from Ireland, is approximately Rs 1.25 lakh.

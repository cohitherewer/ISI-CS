The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Snub rerun for lottery ban

 - Cops issued restraint order as judge questions raid authority 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The state government?s attempts to abolish online lotteries received a second jolt in seven days. On Tuesday, a Calcutta High Court vacation bench slapped a fresh restraint order on the police from conducting raids on a particular retailer?s outlets till the case is disposed of.

 Vacation judge Pranab Kumar Chatterjee said police had no authority to seize equipment from online lottery outlets, check their computer systems, harass the owners and employees, or create obstruction in the running of the business till further orders.

 Last week, the same judge had passed an interim order asking the police not to harass retailers and dealers of online lotteries in Calcutta and elsewhere in the state, in response to a plea by the director of Sikkim lotteries.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta had later announced at Writers? Buildings that the raids would continue.

 The second order, however, categorically restrains the police from holding inquiries against the retailers.

 Though the high court order applies only to a particular retailer, it will be a precedent in the cases of others.

 Tuesday?s order was passed on a petition by Sanchita Roy, a retailer of online lotteries. She alleged that she and her employees were being harassed by police, thus preventing smooth running of business.

 ?The retailers are only sub-agents. They are getting computer access for selling the tickets of companies, who are promoting lotteries conducted by other states,? Sanchita?s lawyer Amalesh Roy argued. 

 ?The government cannot raid retail outlets and seize their articles without asking the promoters to stop the access for online lotteries,? he told the court. 

 Roy claimed the state had not followed the provisions of the Information and Technology Act while deciding to raid the online retailers. 

 Appearing for the state, Debasish Kar Gupta tried to convince the judge about the legal validity of the venture against online lotteries.

 After hearing both sides, Justice Chatterjee passed the interim order and sent the matter for disposal to the regular bench of Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh, of the same court.

 On January 11, Justice Ghosh will hear the matter, along with the cases filed by some dealers of online lotteries, including the one filed by the director of Sikkim state lotteries.

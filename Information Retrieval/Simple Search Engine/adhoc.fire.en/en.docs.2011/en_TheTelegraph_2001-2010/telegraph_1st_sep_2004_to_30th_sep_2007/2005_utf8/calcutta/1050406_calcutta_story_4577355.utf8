If you want to compare upcoming style talent with established names, an ethnic fair of sorts at Genesis Art Gallery on Middleton Street promises a wide variety. 

 Organised by The Rennaisance, a company devoted to providing a platform for upcoming designers, the exhibition provides a one-stop destination for people looking for contemporary or traditional ethnic wear. 

 Chikan ensembles in cotton, georgette and crepe from Joyita?s Selection offer summery buys between Rs 375 and Rs 4,000. While fabric paints are a hot draw from Kuntala?s Boutique. A dash of sequins and glitter further spruce up her garments. The price tag here starts from Rs 100 and goes up to Rs 3,000. 

 Every name has something different to feature at the exhibition, like the south cotton, silk, tussar and jute garments and accessories on offer from Surpiya?s. Likewise, Moushumi and Nupur Kabiraj of Nupur?s Boutique have showcased saris with a touch of Madhubani paintings. Starting at Rs 1,200 for cottons and Rs 3,000 for silks, the saris are very artistic to say the least. Besides, they also have a colourful range of room furnishings, bedspreads and lampshades. These start from Rs 250. 

 Aditi Dasgupta has also displayed her bedspreads in cotton and silk, which feature intricate embroidery and colourful prints. 

 The list is never-ending with S amp;A, a boutique run by Amrita Banerjee, displaying wooden block prints and hand embroidery to add an ethnic feel to her collection of saris. Her style comprises the use of delicate floral motifs and embroidery with a sprinkle of glitter. Here too, the collection is quite economical with cotton saris priced at Rs 600 and their chiffons at Rs 1,200. 

 Yet another designer, Bharati Dutta, who retails out of her Jodhpur Park boutique, is showcasing her summer collection of block-printed and hand-embroidered cotton and silk saris. Her eveningwear range of printed tussars are very stylish and are priced at Rs 1,600. The cotton drapes start at Rs 500. A new addition to her line of traditional wear is a collection of Dhakai jamdani saris featuring summery colours. One can?t help compare these with Tandra Bose?s Dhakai saris, woven by karigars from Bangladesh. 

 Moving on to kantha work, is designer Nella Bagchi, who uses this traditional art of Bengal to embellish a wide range of natural fabrics. 

 Beckoning next is a range of batik saris. Playing with cotton, silk and tussar, Sudatta Bhattacharjee has brought out the detailed nuances of this Indonesian technique, also fusing Indian elements into it. While the silks are priced at Rs 1,300, those wanting a mix of batik and kantha must pay a tad higher at Rs 2,000. 

 For accessories and gift items like candles, oven gloves, aprons and hot dish covers, Sharmila Dey is the name to look out for. 

 For those with a fetish for exclusive innovations, Darbari on Purna Das Road, has put up an impressive range of ethnic ensembles. Be it saris, salwar suits, kurtis or skirts, you can find a whole range of colours, fabrics and designs to suit your taste. Priced between Rs 300 and Rs 8,000, the cottons, crepes, georgettes and tussars have a strong emphasis on hand embroidery, typical of Bengal. Parsi-garha work, kalamkari and sequins are some of the highlights here. Leather bags, silver jewellery, stoles and dupattas complete the collection. 

 Last on the list is the vibrant collection of a young NIFT graduate, at once contemporary and creative. Using embroidery on prints as well as ari, zardosi and stylised stone-work, designer Indrani Biswas has turned around traditional motifs into modern designs to appeal to the young and trendy. Prints on tangail, georgette and crepe are on offer here, as are a range of embroidered and printed salwar suits. Priced between Rs 350 and Rs 6,000, these outfits are classy and very original.

 Lady love

 Women and their moods defined the daylong painting exhibition of Biren Choudhary at Astor Hotel on Monday. Aptly titled Biren?s Women, the exhibition brought alive many feminine emotions and postures. 

 ?Women are the most beautiful creations of God. There is so much pathos to deal with when it comes to women,? said the painter.

 But women are not the only subjects that inspire Choudhary. An artist of renown, Choudhary has been painting realistic portraits, landscapes and depicting Hindu deities through his paintings for several decades now. His canvasses adorn the walls of Birla Art Academy, All India Fine Arts Academy and Delhi Art College.

 Poila pick

 Speciality spread and musical magic is back at Trincas owing to popular demand. Starting April 10, the hunting ground for many aspiring musicians will act as a platform for Bangla bands every evening. 

 A run-up event to the Bengali New Year, Trincas is hosting a five-day fiesta featuring popular Bangla bands Cactus, Chandrabindoo, Kaya, Lakkhichhara and Fossils, between April 10 and 14. 

 The musical treat will be complemented with an exciting food menu comprising Chinese, north Indian and Bengali cuisines. 

 ?The idea is to offer a new mix to both Bengali and non-Bengali food lovers,? said Sashi Puri of Trincas.

 Thus Chicken Methi Kebab and Dahi Kebab rub plates with traditional Bengali recipes like Chhanar Dalna (cottage cheese curry) and Enchorer (jackfruit) Cutlet. In the Chinese section, Chilli Crab and American Corn Ming Style are a few dishes to look out for. 

 The spread will be available both for lunch and dinner. It is advisable to book a table in advance owing to the festive rush. 

 Pret power

 A new season heralds new trends and the race to churn out spring-summer collections has just begun. If you fancy pret lines from designer labels, the latest gear at Ekru may be up your street.

 Besides the in-house line designed by Ruchira and Ekta, comprising Indian and Indo-western formals, casuals and clubwear, the store stocks names like Suneet Verma, Sonali Mansinghka, Niki Mahajan and a new brand called Taxi. 

 The latest in-house line consists of light, ?deconstructed? flowy kurtas, skirts, dresses, casual shirts and kurtis teamed with linen drawstring cigar pants. The collection is embellished with silver and gold metallics, subtle thread embroidery and a sprinkling of mukaish work. Print lovers will also find a lot to choose from in garments featuring flora and fauna in pastel shades. And those who rock to retro should dig fusion prints, water colours and floral prints, especially in the westernwear and loungewear section. Fabrics are breezy chiffons and georgettes in keeping with the weather, apart from crisp linens, poplins, mulmuls and chikans. Colours include neutral plant tones like avocado greens and sage, candy wrapper colours such as pink, lime, jasper, magenta, French blue and mauve. 

 Next on the rack are Suneet Verma?s happy clothes in bright shades. White shirts with fluorescent trimmings, asymmetrical skirts with flowy ruffles, fitting capris and trousers with floral prints, make up the pret line that includes both casual and partywear. 

 Niki Mahajan has stuck to her signature ponches and kurtis in chiffon, georgette and light crepes. Her strength is geometrical prints with minimal embellishments. In her new line she has introduced mirror and thread work on prints and mukaish work to ?Indianise? the ponchos. 

 Cotton knee-length skirts and tops with satin prints in bright fluorescent and funky colours highlight the spring-summer line of Sonali Mansinghka. Her mulmul skirts with underlying satin prints make for great semi-formal wear. They come in plain colours with printed ends and subtle embellishment. 

 If club wear is more your style, there?s a line of skirts from Taxi, a Mumbai brand that is retailing only from Ekru in Calcutta. Skirts with a touch of brocade and trendy tops with pants and sarongs are the offerings from this label.

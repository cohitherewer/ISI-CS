 Shopping in the cool confines of the Ice Staking Rink can be a heat-busting experience. The annual Temptations exhibition of clothes, accessories and household products organised by the Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta started on March 29 and will continue till March 31. 

 Rows of stalls hawking colourful clothes and interesting jewellery are drawing huge crowds at the exhibition organised to give women entrepreneurs a platform to showcase their wares. Bed linen and clothes formed the bulk of the buys, while pretty accessories including party bags and cosmetic jewellery proved to be more eye candy than actual picks. A stall selling Tanjore paintings by a student of Manovikas Kendra drew some useful attention with people promising to buy quite a few of this mentally-challenged artist?s works.

 A makeover session in the vicinity is adding to the colourful proceedings. Bridgette Jones from June Tomkyns beauty salon is rendering handy tips at the hour- long makeover, being conducted on random visitors. 

 Delhi designs

 A designer duo from Delhi ? Kavita and Vanita Sawhney ? is all set to capture the imagination of the couture connoisseurs of Calcutta with a two-day exhibition in the city starting Thursday. To be held at Moksh, the hall in 22 Camac Street, the exhibition will display the latest collection designed by the two sisters under their label Impulse.

 The latest line that will be showcased at Moksh between 10 am and 7 pm includes salwar-kameezes and saris.

 Both the drapes and the outfits are in georgette, crepe, terry-voile, khadi, tussar and silks, as the sisters feel ?these are very feminine fabrics and quite suitable for the summer?. The colour palette includes vibrant red, purple, fuschia and green as well as pastels.

 Various forms of machine embroidery have been blended with some handwork and surface ornamentation like sequins and lots of stones, including Swarovski crystals. 

 The designers have used pin-tucks for the first time, which adorns a limited line of men?s kurta-pyjama. Some salwar sets for women feature pin-tucks too.

 Pot-pourri of paintings in new space

 Gallery Sanskriti has reopened after many years on new premises at 5C, Alipore Park Road. The gallery covers two huge rooms that are well lit, but in spite of its size the manner in which the space is divided makes viewing large works a difficult proposition. For it is not possible to stand back and take a hard look at the works.

 Even when the work is as good as the painting by Ganesh Haloi ? a huge green field on which are write large the signs of cultivation.

 B.R. Panesar?s painting of the terai in Nepal suffers for the same reason. It is crammed in a corner where visibility is not what one would expect.

 The opening show is more of a mixed bag, a pot-pourri with something for every kind of taste. Despite the presence of some outstanding works, most of the larger ones are quite nondescript. And all of them are not being shown for the first time.

 On the other hand, there are some artists here whose works are rarely seen, such as Satish Gujral. His acrylic on canvas depicts a man playing a game of dice with cowrie shells, with a parrot behind it. Very colourful and picturesque like an illustration.

 Another pretty picture, by Anjolie Ela Menon, shows a young and handsome Tamilian Brahmin man who has large pools for eyes. But beyond that?

 There is also a huge watercolour by Paresh Maity ? one of his works based on a visit to Rajasthan with vivid ochres and indigo. It is highlighted with gold dust that gives it quite a cosmetic look. Almost as if it were meant to be the poster of a recent Bollywood film shot in that rugged state.

 Significantly, there is one work by Chittrovanu Mazumdar, another artist seldom seen here nowadays. His digital print in black and white is of a pebbled surface with an irregular black frame at the bottom. Inscribed on it are letters in bright scarlet. He is the only artist here who dabbles in high-tech, if only to further his aesthetic interests.

 Some of the smaller exhibits are quite wonderful. The most striking among these are by Jogen Choudhury and Jayashree Chakravorty. The paper works of Jogen Choudhury were executed in reaction to the pogrom in Gujarat and show human figures with savage incisions.

 Jayashree Chakravorty handles large space with elan and in the past she has handled huge paper works with ease. Here her works are small but are illustrative of her fertile imagination. Scraps of torn paper are scattered, as it were, in the wind. Occasionally, trees appear under scudding clouds in these works ? so many meaning can be read into them. 

 There is an old Bikash Bhattacharjee watercolour of a sun-drenched brickwall which must have been executed when he was a student. Ganesh Pyne shows a more recent work ? a silhouette of a young widow with refined features, hair coiled in a bun, the sari, noticeably white.

 Among the big names is a Husain painting of a courtesan. What catches the eye are some watercolours by Aditya Basak, who seems to be concentrating on heads that are beautifully executed.

 There are several sculptures on display. Sunil Kr Das has created a charming bronze of a Chinese boy, his body turned into a barrel-like form. One expects a more focused show next time.

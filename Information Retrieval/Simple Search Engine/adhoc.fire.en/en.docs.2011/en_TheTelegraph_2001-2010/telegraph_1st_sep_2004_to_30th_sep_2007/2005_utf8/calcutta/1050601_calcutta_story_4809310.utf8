 Hefty civic fine for garage misuse

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Illegal conversion of parking space in buildings will attract a civic fine of Rs 60,000, mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced on Tuesday. The amount will be same for buildings used for commercial, educational or residential purpose, as well as for hospitals or nursing homes.

 ?Illegal conversion of garage space is an unpardonable crime in a city like Calcutta, where there is a shortage of parking space for 50,000 cars at any point of time during peak hours,? Mukherjee added.

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som, at a meeting with controlling officers, has directed the chief engineer (building) not to recommend any exemption of the fine.

 ?The penal provision had been there in the building rules, but the authorities in most cases had been lax in slapping the fine. Now, we have decided to strictly enforce the rules,? said Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer on special duty to the mayor.

 A senior official in the building department said more than 20,000 parking enclosures ? measuring around four million sq ft ? had been illegally converted into some other use over the past seven years.

 According to an estimate of a senior engineer in the building department, the civic body would have been richer by more than Rs 120 crore had the penal provision been imposed on all violators. The amount realised, instead, has been only Rs 40 crore.

 An engineer pointed out that the ground floor and the top floor of a building are most vulnerable to violation of building rules. While most illegal constructions are carried out on the top floor, parking space on the ground floor is most often converted into residential or commercial use.

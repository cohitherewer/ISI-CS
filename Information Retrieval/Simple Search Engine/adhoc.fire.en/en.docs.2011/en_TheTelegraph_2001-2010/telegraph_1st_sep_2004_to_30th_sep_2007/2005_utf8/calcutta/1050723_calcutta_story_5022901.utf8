 It?s not just about fun and games, but also about solving problems and dealing with stress. 

 Conceptualised by Bangalore-based chemical engineer Sultan Ahmed in 1996, Activity started off as a forum where children of all ages could not only express their thoughts and ideas, but learn as well. 

 It was formed to conduct value-add programmes and events such as Wiz Kids, the annual fest, for students. The idea behind Activity was to facilitate the education system by creating opportunities for children beyond academics, concentrating on the character and personality development of the child. 

 It swept through the south, and is now here to make its mark on the east. 

 In fact, in cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, Life Skills programme of Activity has been made a part of school routines. 

 Wiz Kids has come Calcutta calling for the second year. From events like song and dance to essay-writing and art, calligraphy to collage, cooking to crosswords, July 23 and 24 promise to be packed with action, at Don Bosco, Park Circus?s auditorium.

 One of the core areas of Activity is Life Skills, an interactive learning programme that helps youngsters cope with distress-causing situations, if not handled in proper time and with proper care. Like the growing pangs of adolescence.

 A large number of children do not have access to support groups to help them deal with stressful situations. To fill this void, Activity Life Skills has gone beyond the traditional character education programmes, and offers education and experience in areas like self-awareness, communication, decision-making, problem-solving, emotions and managing stress. 

 According to Sultan: ?These skills shape children, who they are, what they believe, how they handle their emotions and how they react to the world around them.?

 Wiz Kids, presented in association with Horlicks, is held at the national level, with regional-level winners participating in the final event, held in Bangalore. 

 The fest is organised in more than 25 cities across the country, with over 30 lakh students taking part in the event. 

 The programme is unique in that it is not just about talent and skills, but also focuses largely on learning through fun. It offers large dollops of frolic and festivity. 

 Rishabh Bapna, the Calcutta coordinator for Wiz Kids, explains: ?The events are definitely out of the ordinary, and the response has been fantastic so far. We have had quite a positive feedback from the various schools and the large number of students we had approached.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hands too few, PF cases pile up

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 The lone officer in the grievance redress cell is being besieged by complaints ? many from senior citizens ? of wait and woe.

 For, allotment of the National Social Security Number (NSSN) to provident fund (PF) account-holders has been stopped.

 The Regional Employees? Provident Fund Organisation in Calcutta has been so badly hit by an acute staff shortage that it has decided to suspend the ambitious project of assigning an NSSN to every PF account-holder in the eastern zone.

 ?It is true that the assignment of NSSN numbers has been stopped. We have already informed the head office in New Delhi about our problems and if they sanction the necessary staff, we can get going again,? said S. Raghuram, regional provident fund commissioner.

 ?We have our entire set-up ready and once we get the green signal from Delhi, we can resume our work,? he added.

 Under the NSSN scheme, which works just like a permanent account number (PAN), a citizen can track one?s PF balance and account status even after leaving a job and joining a different company anywhere in India.

 About two million people are supposed to be covered under the NSSN scheme in the eastern region, but just 60,000 cases have been processed since the project began earlier this year.

 At present, 550 posts are lying vacant and the Regional Employees? Provident Fund Organisation has asked for immediate sanction of at least 130-odd employees.

 This could clear the backlog in an office that not only covers Calcutta, but also the whole of eastern India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 Officials at the PF settlement department pointed out several other problems dogging the place for the past couple of years.

 ?We have to process over 40,000 cases per month. While the number of PF cases are going up every day, the number of our officials is dwindling with every retirement. We have to work under immense pressure,? complained an officer with the accounts and enforcement department.

 Only 30 per cent of the scheduled work is being cleared in a month.

 ?We are supposed to process about 8,000 cases every day, but with limited manpower, we are not being able to get anywhere close do the figure,? admitted an official.

 Around 100 people come to the PF office every day with queries, but due to the staff shortage, no more than half can be attended to. 

 The other half go back disgruntled and dreary, only to return in a few days with hope ? that is invariably dashed again.

 The likes of Soumitra Ghosh, who has been doing the NSSN rounds to little avail. ?I don?t know how many times I have to come here again and again,? complained the retired schoolteacher.

 Or of B. Roy Choudhury, owner of a shipping company. ?I have been here at least three times in the past week. I had come to meet senior officials, but each time, I have been told that they were all busy in meetings. I am just tired of this,? said Roy Choudhury, who is trying to settle the PF accounts of some employees.

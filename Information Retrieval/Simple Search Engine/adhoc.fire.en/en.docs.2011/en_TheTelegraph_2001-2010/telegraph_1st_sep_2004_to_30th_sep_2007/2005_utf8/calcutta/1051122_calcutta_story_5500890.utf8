College folk in Ahmedabad swear by the Bandish Nights. The nightlong musical concoction is often their only route to intoxication in the dry state.

 Not many years ago in the same city, two schoolmates were having fun in their classroom, little knowing that a decade later they would raise a storm not only in Gujarat but everywhere from Dubai to the UK.

 Its one project that had to have a K. Thats where the attitude comes from, laughs Udyan Sagar, one half of Bandish Projekt, who was in the city over the weekend to play at the Red Label night at Saturday Club. 

 The other half, Mayur Narvekar, chips in: We used to call ourselves Private Sochalaya before this and journalists said they couldnt mention the band name in their articles!

 The band has come a long way since the Sochalaya days. It may still be known in India for the Ishaa Koppikar video Bhor, but Bandish Projekt is now a name to reckon with in the underground music market abroad. Blending classical strains with techno funk, the duo produces original music apart from mixing hit tracks of yesteryear.

 We know that people still refer to us as the makers of Bhor, smiles Udyan. That too happened by chance. Ishaa was shooting in Bangkok for Girlfriend when the films choreographer Bosco made her hear the remixed song. Ishaa heard Bhor for five seconds and immediately agreed to feature in the video for the song.

 Apart from the remixed tracks, the album Bhor also had an original track from Bandish Projekt. It was called Pregnant drums, recounts Udyan. It was all about the sounds that are played during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi. While the song became a rage at clubs abroad, it didnt play that much here.

 Bhor turned out to be just a take-off point for the two who then moved from one continent to another playing live music and producing great tracks. 

 Says Mayur: We didnt stay back in India and went to places like Dubai and the UK because we wanted to collaborate with big-time artistes there.

 That they did, playing alongside the likes of Midival Punditz, Bally Sagoo, Rishie Rich and Punjabi MC. They also played with the State of Bengal at the Clandestino festival in Sweden.

 But the clincher was when they featured in an album that had Carlos Santana and Dido in the line-up. It was a lounge compilation called Majlis brought out by BMG International from Dubai, recalls Udyan. Trust me, we never felt better.

 From Calcutta, Udyan and Mayur are headed for Pune before landing up in Goa for the International Film Festival of India and the premiere of Aditya Bhattacharyas Dubai Return, starring Irrfan.

 When Aditya heard us at live gigs in Dubai, he asked us to do the music for his film, says Mayur. We came up with the entire background score that goes very well with the movie. It was a great experience and we hope to get into film music more and more.

 Right now, Bandish Projekt is almost ready with its new album, where all the 10 tracks are original compositions. We have a couple of tracks left, which we will record in the UK and then master in Germany, reveals Mayur. 

 We will bring out the album under our own label, called Bheja Fry. It will be first launched in Europe and then later in India.

 The new album, yet to be titled, has tribal people from Kutch contributing in a big way. They are the only surviving people who play the double flute or the joriya pawa, says Udyan.

 Theres also the Rajkot-based singer Karsan Sargathiya who sings all the alaaps for the tracks.

 This was not the first time that Bandish Projekt had come down to Calcutta. The duo was here last year to promote Bhor.

 But this time on a more leisurely note, they did check out the food and the female following.

 Both are very good and we need to come back again, sign off the two, with a mischievous smile.

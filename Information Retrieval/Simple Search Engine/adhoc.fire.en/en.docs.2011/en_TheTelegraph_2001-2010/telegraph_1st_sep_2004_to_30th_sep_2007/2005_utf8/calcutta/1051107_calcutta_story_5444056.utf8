 Eastern Railway has invested heavily in upgrading Park Circus station on the Sealdah South section. A gigantic footbridge has been constructed. Two platforms and a new ticket booking counter are also being made to cater to trains that head towards Dum Dum directly, bypassing Sealdah. We hope the facilities are introduced at the earliest for the benefit of the regular commuters. However, the footbridge is fast turning into a public toilet and a hangout for unauthorised settlers. As they are not yet in operation, the new platforms and booking office have also started looking run-down. It would be of great help if the facilities are thrown open to public soon. 

 Tapan Pal,

 The expansion of Park Circus railway station is still in progress. A separate platform is being built to cater to the trains on the Dum Dum-Ballygunge chord line. A footbridge has also been constructed to connect all the platforms. These facilities are in view of the increasing number of commuters using this station. Of late, some people have encroached upon parts of the footbridge. They also litter the platforms. Add to that, a lot of construction material is kept on the station premises. We plan to wrap up the construction work by this year-end, evict the encroachers and inaugurate the new facilities early next year. 

 S. Majumdar,

 CPRO, Eastern Railway.

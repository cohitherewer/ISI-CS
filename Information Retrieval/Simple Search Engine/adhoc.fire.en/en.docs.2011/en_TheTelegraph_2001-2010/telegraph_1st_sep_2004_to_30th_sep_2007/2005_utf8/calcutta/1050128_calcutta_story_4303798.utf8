The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Darkness at noon in power unit trip

 OUR BUREAU

 It was one of the toughest surgeries planned for Thursday, as the patient had undergone three failed hepatic duct operations. So, when surgeon B. Ramana learnt around 9.30 am that Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute ? like many other health stops in the city ? was reeling under a power cut, he had a tough call to take.

 ?It was a very complicated surgery and it could not wait for the power to return. So, the generator was switched on and the surgery started, before normal power was restored,? said Ramana.

 Most private hospitals had to depend on generators for most of the day, but the government hospitals were spared the ordeal.

 Health points and homes, work stations and educational institutions reeled under massive power cuts on Thursday as the ?mainstay generating station? of the CESC at Budge Budge stopped production early in the morning. The cause: the lone operating 250 MW unit tripping due to a snag.

 The other 250 MW unit had been shut for repairs since January 22. The unit that tripped on Thursday morning was started up on January 20, following an overhaul.

 ?With two of our major 250 MW units out of commission, we had to resort to drastic power cuts all over the city in the morning and afternoon,? said a CESC official. The shortfall in the CESC-served areas shot up to 200 MW around noon.

 Widespread power cuts were reported from various parts of the city, ranging between two-and-a-half hours to four.

 If new-age offices had to fall back on back-up facilities, trendy hangouts, too, tripped momentarily. 

 Forum, which has 100 per cent power back-up, had to fire its giant Caterpillar gensets thrice during the day.

 ?We have a 12-second time lag for the entire mall to be recharged, but the movies at INOX suffered a five-minute lag during every disruption,? said an official at the Elgin Road address.

 The darkness at noon syndrome hit tech offices in town three days after Sector V had suffered close to three hours of power cuts. 

 The cause on Monday, too, was a ?technical snag? in the state IT hub?s sub-station of the State Electricity Board (SEB).

 On Thursday, a team of CESC engineers embarked on mission crisis management. 

 Around noon, the demand for electricity in the CESC-supplied areas crossed the 800 MW mark, with CESC?s units generating just a shade over 500 MW.

 The SEB, functioning minus two of its units at the state-run Kolaghat plant, conveyed to the CESC its inability to supply more than 100 MW.

 Finally, the Budge Budge unit that had collapsed around 3.30 am on Thursday was brought back on stream close to 4 pm. The unit gradually gathered momentum and reached its peak generation of 250 MW by 6 pm.

 As a result, the situation improved on Thursday evening and the deficit in the CESC-served areas climbed down to 80 MW after 6.30 pm.

 Spring symphony

Manisha Murali Nair

 Tagores poetic imagination has invested the season of spring with an abundance of rich, symbolic associations. At times, conceived as the epitome of youthful energy and love and at others, evoking the spirituality and wisdom of a hermit, his immortal compositions in celebration of spring are a fitting eulogy to the magical beauty that nature weaves in this season. The programme of Rabindrasangeet by the siblings Manisha Murali Nair and Manoj Murali Nair celebrates spring in all its colourful glory. Whereas Basanti hey bhuvanamohini visualises spring as a goddess who arrives on a golden chariot, Phagun haowaye haowaye invokes spring as the destroyer of death and decay and harbinger of new hope and life. Also in the repertoire are evergreen songs like Aami pathbhola ek pathik, Ektuku chhnoa lagey and Tumi kichhu diye jao. The evening also witnesses the launch of Phagun Haowaye, a music CD of Rabindrasangeet by the duo, set to the tune of V. Balsara?s piano. Hosted by Bhavna Records amp; Cassettes.

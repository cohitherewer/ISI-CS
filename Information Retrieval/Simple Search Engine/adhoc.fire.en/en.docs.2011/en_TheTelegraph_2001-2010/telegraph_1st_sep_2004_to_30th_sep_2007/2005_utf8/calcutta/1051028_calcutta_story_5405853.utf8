 Theres another addition to Calcuttas ever-expanding beauty block. June Tomkyns on Ballygunge Circular Road inaugurated its third wing on Wednesday.

 Complete with a nail bar, a skin treatment zone and a bridal segment, Calcuttans are promised a brand new get-gorgeous experience. 

 After having trained at the International Dermal Institute, UK, and gained expertise at a French institute for seven years, setting up shop in my hometown was a natural move, reveals Junes daughter Janis.

 On offer is an entire range of treatments with products from Skeyndor. There are specialised facials like Hydrafiller programme, Platinum Lifting programme, Crystal White treatment and Seaweed Gel treatment. Beauty adviser Sharon Tomkyns will helm the therapies.

 Special Diwali beauty packages are priced at Rs 1,350 while the regular rate card would read around Rs 1,500 for a special facial.

 ans of offering Original Lastone Therapy are also on the anvil. With specially-moulded stones, all the way from Arizona, this therapy elevates holistic healing to new heights. Hot and cold stones, also known as Geothermo therapy and Cryotherapy, will be used to balance out all body functions, adds Janis.

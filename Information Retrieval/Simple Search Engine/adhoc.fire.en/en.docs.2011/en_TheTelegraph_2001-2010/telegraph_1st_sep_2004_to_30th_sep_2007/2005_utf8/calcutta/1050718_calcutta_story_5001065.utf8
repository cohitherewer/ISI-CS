 A fire broke out in a hosiery warehouse on the ground floor of a residential building, off Kalakar Street, in Burrabazar, early on Sunday. 

 It took 10 fire tenders over 12 hours to bring the blaze under control. 

 The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. Residents of the building said it could have been caused by an electrical short circuit.

 Forensic officers have been asked to examine the site and a case has been lodged with Posta police station.

 Fire brigade officers claimed the owner of the warehouse did not have a licence to store inflammable articles. 

 They said jars of chemicals and cashews were kept in the warehouse, meant for woollen goods. 

 Owner Mahesh Grover refused comment. 

 ?Around 1 am on Saturday, the fire broke out in Golden Centre, a 800-sq-ft warehouse packed with woollen goods, on the ground floor of a three-storeyed building on Chaitan Sett Street, off Kalakar Street. Six fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Later, four more were sent there to bring the situation under control. We are yet to estimate the damage,? stated Bibhas Guha, the divisional fire officer.

 According to residents of the first floor of the building, the fire was detected around 1.20 am, after they felt waves of heat emanating from below. 

 ?We were sleeping on the ground. Suddenly, the floor turned hot. We raised an alarm immediately after detecting the fire,? said a resident. 

 Initially, the firemen tried spraying water from outside. When this method failed, they called up seniors, who soon arrived on the spot. 

 After a brief meeting, it was decided that a hole would be dug on the concrete ceiling of the warehouse, and water sprayed through it.

 Civic officials, in charge of buildings, were informed. Six firefighters, along with men from the civic department, started digging the floor above the warehouse. 

 ?The process took over 45 minutes. We were panicking, as the intensity of the blaze was increasing. People had started screaming and running,? recounted Ratan Yadav, a resident.

 After making a dent on the warehouse roof, firemen pushed in a pipe and started spraying water, while civic workers continued to widen the breach. A portion of the floor soon gave in, helping the firefighters.

 As the fire still could not be doused, traffic along Kalakar Street was stopped and the area around the building was cordoned off. The 16 families living in the building were evacuated.

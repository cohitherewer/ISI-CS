 On a father?s trail

 He died impoverished and unidentified, in the men?s room of Penn Station, New York, circa 1974... Considered by many architectural historians as the most important architect in the latter half of the 20th century, Louis I. Kahn is brought alive in a vibrant and evocative documentary stitched together by his illegitimate son Nathaniel Kahn.

 My Architect: A Son?s Journey is a tale of ?love and art, betrayal and forgiveness?, in which Nathaniel, the child of one of Louis?s extra-marital relationships, undertakes a five-year worldwide exploration to understand his father, the mystery of whose life was as compelling as his buildings.

 The much-acclaimed documentary, the son?s fervent search for the ?true Lou?, will be screened by American Center on September 15 (Lincoln Room, 5 pm), in the presence of the director-producer duo of Nathaniel and Susan Rose Behr.

 A Jewish immigrant who battled poverty and a devastating childhood mishap, Kahn created a clutch of ?intensely powerful and spiritual? buildings ? geometric tapestries of brick, concrete and light ? which, a critic said, ?change your life?.

 While Kahn?s artistic legacy was an uncompromising search for ?truth and clarity?, his personal life was filled with the covert and chaos. In My Architect, Nathaniel attempts to reconcile the life and work of this genius.

 The rivetting narrative takes off from the subterranean corridors of Penn Station and leads the audience through the throbbing streets of Bangladesh (where Kahn built the Capital, the parliament building), and from the New England coast to the inner circles of Jerusalem?s political matrix.

 The characters portray myriad moods ? fascinating to hilarious, adoring to critical... From the cabbies who drove Kahn around his native Philadelphia, to former lovers and clients, to the rarefied heights of the world?s most celebrated architects ? Frank Gehry, I.M. Pei and Philp Johnson among them.

 In My Architect, the film-maker reveals the ?haunting beauty of his father?s monumental creations and takes us deep within his own divided family?. The documentary has the emotional impact of a dramatic feature film (including an original orchestral score), and becomes ?a universal investigation of identity, a celebration of art and, ultimately, of life itself?.

 Stephen Holden writes in The New York Times: ?There is a built-in poignancy to any story of a son searching for clues to the identity of a father he barely knew. But in case of Nathaniel Kahn, that poignancy has an extra twinge, since this mostly absent father strove so diligently to remain a man of mystery.?

 Edited by Sabine Krayenbuhl, the director of photography is Bob Richman, with music by Joseph Vitarelli. The film is written and narrated by Nathaniel Kahn and is a sponsored project of The New York Foundation for the Arts, funded entirely by ?generous contributions? from foundations and individuals.

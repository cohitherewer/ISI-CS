 Injuries sustained in fall on tramlines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Potholed roads and tram tracks, that have turned veritable killers, have led to two pedestrians being severely injured in the past two days.

 A mob ransacked a tram after a 15-year-old schoolgirl was injured as she tripped over potholed tram tracks around 11.15 am on Wednesday. This occurred at the crossing of Amherst Street and Mahatma Gandhi Road. 

 The mob agitated against bad road conditions in the area.

 Neha Akhtar, 15, a resident of Keshub Chandra Sen Street ,was on her way to Anglo Arabic Second Grade School. 

 While she was walking across the MG Road-Amherst Street crossing, she tripped over a pothole on the tram track just as a tram was approaching down MG Road. She received injuries on her waist and head, but went to her school later. 

 However, after some time, she felt a severe pain and the school authorities rushed her to Medical College Hospital. Her family members were informed, who later shifted her to a private nursing home. 

 Angry local people started throwing stones at the approaching tram. 

 A traffic constable, who was on duty at the crossing, tried to intervene, but this infuriated the crowd all the more. The people chased the constable away and ransacked the tram. 

 Panic-struck tram passengers rushed out to save themselves along with the driver and two conductors. 

 Traffic came to a grinding halt as the agitators blocked the crossing at peak office hour. 

 Later, a huge contingent of police arrived and brought the mob under control. No one was arrested. 

 ?The roads and tram tracks have turned into death traps. Road conditions have always been poor. Every day, someone or the other either trips or receives injuries. There are huge, crater-like potholes on the road, particularly at the busy crossing. Even buses and cars have a trying time driving down the area. Tram tracks are being repaired all over the city but this part of the city is neglected,? complained Syed Nuruddin, a local resident.

 ?The girl fell on the tram tracks and injured herself. There was a commotion and local people damaged the tram. A police force was sent to the spot and brought the crowd under control. Normal traffic movement resumed in no time,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (north).

 On Tuesday evening, a middle-aged man was seriously injured after being run over by a tramcar. 

 Krishno Nayek, 47, was crossing the tram tracks on Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road near the office of the Public Service Commission.

 He slipped and fell on the track and was run over by an approaching tram. 

 He was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, where his right arm was amputated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On foot, on a mission

 The official count was two thousand. Unofficially it was a few hundreds more. Sudeshna Banerjee walks the talk with agitating students of Jadavpur University and supporters of their cause

 Police-RAF campus-ey dhukiye 

 chhatro-chhatrider andolan bhangar ghotona apnader mone 

 pore? (Remember how the police and the RAF invaded the 

 campus to break a student agitation?) 

 The poster made the head of the rally as it marched up Ashutosh Mukherjee Road on the sultry Thursday afternoon. Carrying it was a short stocky boy, who said he studied in Jadavpur University?s civil engineering department. Three others were busy distributing leaflets that told the tale of ?terror and torture? in words of fire and brimstone.

 Jotoi chalao lathi-guli,

 Bondho hobe na moder buli

 The rally was meant to remind the city of police action on students on a hungerstrike. But the message ? and the mood ? was much more strident. Student muscle was being flexed in broad daylight, not through aggression but through noisy assertion that comes from the collective force of numbers.

 A chart was being carried, listing the colleges that had joined the cause. It read a strong 35, from across the state and beyond. Midway through the journey from the university gates, someone got hold of a bottle of poster colour. Since a brush could not be found, it was bare fingers dipped in the paint that added two more names to the list. The latest to enter: Lady Brabourne College.

 Ei lorai lorbe ke?

 Tumi-ami, abar ke?

 Curious crowds flanked both sides of the lane, taken over by election publicity material. In front of Ujjwala cinema, Purnima Chakraborty accepted a leaflet. So did Ramen Das. But he could not read. So the cook of a streetside fast food stall explained to the handcart-puller: ?Na, na, ora partyr chhele noy. College-ey giye oder police merechhey, tai michhil korchhey. Ekhono shob Bhangor (Bangur Hospital)-ey bhorti.? Did she pick up the information from the leaflet? ?No, no. I heard the news on TV,? her face lit up. 

 The year 1972 was present on the posters as a point of reference. Those were turbulent times when the law had cracked its whip hard on student politics in independent Bengal, when parents would send college-going boys to relatives in the districts to escape being picked up for questioning by the police. The hundreds of youth walking in the rally had not lived in the Naxal era. But keeping the memory alive has suited the current rulers. Along with the Emergency, the crackdown in the early Seventies has been showcased over the years as a spectre of the horror of non-Marxist rule. After all, the 20-year-olds have lived all their lives in the Red. 

 You told us of ?72,

 We will teach you ?05

 Simple, but a threat nonetheless. The slogan was writ on many a printout carried on the chests. The reference was there in the handouts as well. ?Have you seen such a rally by thousands of students on an apolitical platform after the Seventies?? asked a Presidency College sophomore. A student of history, she has been with the movement since June 6. ?My first identity is of a student. That?s why I am here. There are about 100 of us in the rally today,? she said, in between adding decibel muscle to the rally.

 Chhatro andolanke bhoy pay,

 Kotripakkho hai hai

 A halt was announced at Hazra crossing. ?Hospital ahead. Put off all mikes,? came the directive from the first of the 10 rickshaws carrying the boys manning the microphones and guiding the sloganeering. ?Should we stop the slogans as well?? While the decision was taken, bottles began to be handed down from a Matador van carrying water in huge containers.

 The thirst for a drink was quenched; the hunger to press for demands remained. The momentum of movement took them past Chittaranjan National Cancer Research Hospital, past the Bhowanipore police station, all the movie halls?

 A placard from Majdia College had two skulls. One was thinner than the other but both were dripping blood. ?The VC and the registrar,? the caption read. 

 Behind the clutch of posters, a lady walked in silence. ?1982. Economics,? she explained. She had gone to the university to collect an admission form for her HS-passed son when she saw the procession snaking its way out. She would go back the next day to collect the form, she said.

 With slogans, there were songs 

 emanating from one section of the long-winded rally. Courtesy 

 three women (picture second from top). Perched atop 

 a rickshaw, they were belting out revolutionary songs one 

 after the other as other participants, junior to them by 

 decades, clapped to the beat. 

 Agun jwalo, agun jwalo

 ?We are not connected to Jadavpur University but we take part in agitations on every humanitarian issue. In 1987, police lathicharged RG Kar Medical College students on hungerstrike; in 1991, when a student was suspended from Medical College, they attacked at night; they tried the same tactics to break the Kanoria jute mill agitation in 1994. On all three occasions, they had to go on the backfoot. Take our word, this time, too, they will be forced to backtrack,? one of them stated.

 The rally was now approaching the Exide crossing. The cops following the rally all the way from the university had unfastened the top buttons of their shirts, dripping with sweat. ?Political party or student rally, it?s all in a day?s work for us,? one shied, wiping his forehead with a wet handkerchief. At the crossing, more policemen were waiting to see the rally through peacefully.

 Police tumi jotoi maro,

 Mainey tomar panchsho baro

 A broad grin overcame many a tired face, not in the police ranks. 

 As the sun set across the Maidan, the rally took a turn past Victoria Memorial. ?This far and no further,? was the message.

 So the thousands now squatted on the carriageway in front of Academy of Fine Arts.

 A CD had been brought, carrying recordings of ?police atrocities on campus on the accursed night of June 10?. As the students prepare to converge on the premises for the screening, a hurried announcement is made. ?Our culture-loving chief minister has not allowed us power connection at the Academy. We have to cancel the screening.?

 Not to be outdone, the microphone is handed round among representatives of participants from every nook and corner of the state. The star speaker is Mona Das, president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University student?s union. ?I reached Calcutta just this morning to walk with our agitating friends from JU,? she said, raising her voice over the applause, after handing back the microphone. Now she again has a train to catch.

 Others are homeward-bound. The van fills up with weary legs. There are many more miles to go before their journey would come to an end.

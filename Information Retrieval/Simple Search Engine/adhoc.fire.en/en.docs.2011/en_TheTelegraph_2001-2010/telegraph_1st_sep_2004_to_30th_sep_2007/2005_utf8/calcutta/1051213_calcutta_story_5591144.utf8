The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Billboards wild, too hot to handle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The fingers that pull the trigger will now wield the editor?s pencil.

 To prevent trouble at bashes in the city during December and January, police have resolved to play moral guardian and have banned the use of certain words in advertisements for parties.

 The office of the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) has directed the organisers of the bashes not use any words in the advertisements that might cause problems later.

 ?We have asked hotels, bars and party organisers not to use provocative pictures and words like ?wet?, ?wild? and ?hot? in billboards and newspaper advertisements to describe their programmes,? stated a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters. 

 Explaining the reason behind the initiative, Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner, headquarters, said: ?Last year, we received a number of complaints regarding visual pollution. People told us over the phone that it was unfair that children were being forced to see obscene ads. There is logic in the complaints.?

 He added: ?Such parties are held at places where admission is restricted. Then, how can the organisers put up obscene ads in public places??

 When asked if the cops were taking upon themselves the role of moral-minders, the senior officer said: ?You may look at our role any way you please. The restrictions are precautionary measures. If anything goes wrong, we will be the first ones to be criticised. One should not cross the limits.?

 Sharma has already directed the organisers not to put up billboards or publish advertisements before obtaining clearance from police and the excise department.

 ?Every year, the organisers go public with their ads before getting clearance from us. This time, they will have to come to us for permission before approaching the excise department. There won?t be any problems if there is no breach of law,? the deputy commissioner maintained.

 In another development, police have showcaused 10 bars for serving liquor beyond the stipulated time.

 Last year, the detective department had conducted surprise raids at two prominent discotheques and found the authorities serving liquor beyond the curfew hours.

 ?The organisers will have to stick to the time limit since it has already been relaxed for their sake,? asserted an officer.

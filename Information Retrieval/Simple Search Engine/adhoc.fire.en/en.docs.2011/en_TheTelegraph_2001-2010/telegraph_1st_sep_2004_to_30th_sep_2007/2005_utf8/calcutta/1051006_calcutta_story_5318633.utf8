 Funds for canal plan 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The much-awaited Circular-New Cut-Kestopur canal navigation project is to set sail, as Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has agreed to provide funds.

 The Rs 20-crore project will be implemented by the irrigation department, Hidco and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The action plan was finalised last week at a meeting held by housing minister Goutam Deb and attended by officials of Hidco, CMC and the irrigation department, and local MLAs.

 ?Work will start after the Puja and we aim to complete it within six months,?? said Hidco director-general Subodh Bhattacharya.

 The 20-km stretch of the three canals from Chitpur Lock Gate to New Town, via Salt Lake, will be cleaned up, dried, excavated and filled with water from the Hooghly. A permanent and automatic sluice gate will be built near Bagbazar to control the flow of water from the river. 

 The banks of the canals will be strengthened with brick soling and a concrete mix and will be developed with gardens, children?s parks and cafeterias.

 The drainage channels opening into the canals will be diverted to the city?s main drainage system.

 Chairman of the Assembly standing committee on transport, Sadhan Pande, who attended the meeting, said he had submitted a proposal to the transport department to run ferry services after the canals are cleaned up.

 The government had drawn up the navigation project in 2002, but could not implement it because of a funds crunch. The irrigation department, which maintains the canals, had made it clear that until additional funds were allotted, the project would remain a dream.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cleared the bottleneck by involving Hidco in the project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Recently, I decided to observe the number of two-wheeler riders without helmet during my journey from Salt Lake to Howrah for some office work. It was shocking that at each and every busy intersection on my way, I saw riders without helmets pass by right under the nose of the police personnel. The cops didn?t even try to stop them, leave alone fine them for flouting road rules. Accepted that the riders are foolish and are risking their lives, but isn?t it also the police?s duty to implement rules? 

 Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake. 

 There is no gum at the Esplanade post office for which customers are frequently harassed. Moreover, the acknowledgement cards for receipt of money orders reach my residence 30 to 40 days late. Sometimes, they never come. The postal authorities should pay more attention to these small things.

 Mahesh Prasad, Rammohan Sarani. 

 Despite still being known as the mecca of football in India, Calcutta doesn?t have a single decent football ground. Salt Lake stadium is ill-maintained and is unfit to hold even state-level matches. It is so demoralising for top teams of West Bengal to lose to obscure teams from other parts of India. It?s of no use asking players to improve their game when we are unable to provide them infrastructure conducive to it. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum.

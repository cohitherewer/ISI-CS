 The man behind myriad faces

 Prabir Kumar De ? the man whose brilliant brushstrokes have transformed countless women over almost three decades ? died on Wednesday morning.

 The renowned make-up artiste was run over by a train while at a shoot for a models portfolio near the railway tracks in Patuli on the southern fringes of the city around 8.45 am. 

 His mutilated body was cremated at Nimtala crematorium in the evening. 

 De, 45, was a bachelor and is survived by his mother and siblings.

 His loss is a blow to the citys glamour industry, of which De had become an inseparable part.

 A creative bent of mind and a keen interest in the transformation of faces prompted De to start dabbling with make-up as early as his school days.

 He started off small, doing bridal makeovers for friends and family. Gradually, his passion became his profession.

 During the initial years, the artiste concentrated on bridal work, lending his touch to transform many a bride-to-be. Wedding make-up assignments took him to almost every part of the country and even beyond, as far as Singapore, Hong Kong, Nepal and Bhutan.

 It was later however that De became a name in the citys glamour business. His role in shaping the modelling world of Calcutta is perhaps unparalleled by any other professional.

 Since the sector began to gain momentum in the early 90s, De had been largely regarded as its backbone, defining the look for many a campaign, ramp show and photo shoot.

 He had a near monopoly in his area of expertise for the past 15 years, having been called in to execute the make-up for the lions share of designer shoots, commercials and fashion shows taking place in the city.

 Though he never ventured into the sphere of film make-up, De had worked his magic on most leading Tollywood actresses for print advertisements and TV commercials.

 He had worked with many of the countrys top models and actresses, including the likes of Bipasha Basu, Rimi Sen, Nayanika Chatterjee Singh, Celina Jaitley, Shonal Rawat, Reshmi Ghosh and Sharan Mishra.

 Des involvement with the modelling world, however, extends beyond the hours spent brushing on layer after careful layer of colour.

 With a keen eye for spotting potential modelling talent, he had discovered several faces that now dot the cityscape.

 His death leaves a vacuum in the industry, feel actresses, models and designers.

 I have never done a single shoot in Calcutta without Prabirdas make-up. Not only was he brilliant at his work, he would never let you down. I dont know how Ill ever do a shoot here again, laments designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh.

 I cant think of doing make-up in Calcutta from anyone other than Prabirda. He hand-holded me into the industry and kept on inspiring me at a time when everyone else rejected me. He was like an elder brother to most of us, remembers model Reshmi Ghosh.

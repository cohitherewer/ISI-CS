 Trincas is going strong once again. And though Ferazzini?s on Lindsay Street shut down years ago, Peliti?s in Dalhousie Square ? that found a mention in Rabindranath Tagore?s memoirs ? is still remembered as one of the finest restaurants in Calcutta. Firpo?s was renowned for its confectionery and bread that was popular all over the city. Italian restaurants have become part of Calcutta?s heritage. 

 Now, after a gap of several decades, Annamaria Forgione Wiseman, an intrepid Italian woman, who is already a successful restaurateur in Kathmandu, is all set to open her pizzeria and ice-cream parlour, Fire and Ice, at June-end. 

 Annamaria, who seems energised by the heat of Calcutta, could not have chosen a better venue for her pizzeria ? the spruced up Kanak Buildings on Chowringhee, that once housed the famed Army amp; Navy Stores. She had chanced upon the building while looking around for space, and now it is humming with activity as workers go around polishing floors. ?I felt pulled to it,? she says.

 Annamaria is a cheerful and energetic woman with bright eyes, and points out the place where a counter will be put up from where pizza slices and ice-cream will be sold. The coffee beans will be from Italy. The powders for ice-cream from Bologna. The menu will be confined to pizzas and pastas, with plenty of vegetables, besides desserts such as apple pie and crepes and ice-creams in only two flavours ? vanilla and chocolate. Beer and wine are the only alcohol that will be served, and she is still fighting hard to get a liquor licence.

 Annamaria was born in Naples, but her father having immigrated to Venezuela, her family returned to Italy only after the dictatorship was over in 1958. 

 She was brought up in boarding school in Milan, but it was from her aunt, a martinet who owned a casino in Santa Domingo, that she learnt the art of cooking and other household chores. With a gift for tongues, she was a translator of English, French, and German, and after years in Kathmandu, now she speaks fluent Nepali.

 The stress of living in London, she feels, got to her, and in 1987 she fell severely ill. In 1989, her second husband?s job took her to Kathmandu. ?Nepal was incredible. The atmosphere and energy are so fulfiling,? says Annamaria. She started recovering and in January 1995, she opened Fire and Ice. It became the talk of the town as the former royal family patronised it, as did the likes of Richard Gere, Sting, monks and famous mountaineers, as well as a Time magazine correspondent who wrote that her pizzas came from a coal-fired oven. ?Actually, it works on electricity,? Annamaria clarifies.

 The Calcutta restaurant will have a rustic look like the one in Kathmandu. Bucolic scenes will be painted with red chilli on the pelmets by the women of Janakpur. 

 Annamaria is excited because she will be able to use the fresh produce of farms in Calcutta.

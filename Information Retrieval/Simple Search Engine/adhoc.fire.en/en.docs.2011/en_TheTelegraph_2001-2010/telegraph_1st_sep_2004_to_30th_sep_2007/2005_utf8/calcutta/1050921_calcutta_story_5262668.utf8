 Surgery for lung rupture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sunil Sahu, 48, slipped off the top of a stairwell and fell on the ground, 20 ft below, with a loud thud. He did not suffer a single fracture, but ruptured his lungs and bled around three litres within the chest.

 To repair the damage, doctors performed on Sahu video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), never attempted in eastern India. The patient is now on the way to recovery.

 ?When he fell, we were almost sure that he had died. But moments later, he got up and dusted his shirt. Still, we were convinced that X-rays would reveal extensive injuries,? said Ganesh Maity, a relative of Sahu.

 The accident, which occurred 10 days ago in a Midnapore town, left Sahu with some pain in the chest, which he ignored. He decided to visit a doctor only after he started bleeding.

 ?The case was amazing,? said Sujay Shad, cardio-thoracic surgeon at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, where Sahu landed early on Tuesday. ?When people fall down the stairs, they tumble or slide before coming to a halt. But Sahu had flown down through the air before hitting the ground.?

 Though there was no major injury, a detailed investigation revealed that there was a significant collection of blood in the right chest, between the lungs and the chest wall. A tube was inserted into the chest and nearly a litre of bloody fluid was taken out.

 But a CT scan revealed that there was still a considerable amount of blood and fluid, mostly in the form of a clot, in the chest. Only a surgery could remove it and it had to be done with minimum incision, as Sahu had already bled a lot. 

 There were two alternatives: a 15-inch incision or two incisions of 15 mm each (VATS). ?I and my colleagues decided on the latter,? Shad said.

 During the surgery, Sahu was administered a special type of general anaesthetic, which separates the oxygen supply to the two lungs. 

 The technique ? single lung ventilation, must for VATS ? helped senior anaesthetist Ravi Wankhede control the air flow.

 The doctors created a space in the chest by deflating the right lung, through which surgical instruments were inserted and blood and the blood clot taken out.

 ?Ordinarily, such a haemorrhage would require a full thoracotomy. We knew we had a good chance because the advantages of VATS are similar to that of laparoscopy,? added Shad.

Why did I pick up the harmonica? I saw Bob Dylan and Bryan Jones? And it was the cheapest instrument for a teenager, laughs a 65-year-old Frenchman on his maiden trip to Calcutta.

 If it was the Tambourine Man and the Rolling Stone who inspired J.J. Milteau to take to the harmonica, it is this small and intimate instrument that has taken him around the world, and now brought him to this city.

 Milteau may not be a household name in India, but back home in France, hes really big, says Emmanuelle De Decker of The French Association, which has invited the artiste for a performance here.

 Born into a Parisian working-class family, Milteau picked up the harmonica in his teens. Soon, his preferred form of music became the blues. When I was starting out, I wasnt very pleased with rock and roll? It had already become very commercial. Then I discovered the blues, which was very honest music.

 He started travelling in the Sixties and has been almost everywhere except South America, which I plan to visit, soon. 

 Milteaus discography includes eight albums in which he has recorded with top French singers such as Charles Aznavour, Eddy Mitchell and Yves Montand.

 The artiste counts among his influences Zulu dances, Irish jigs, Mexican fandangos and the rich musical tradition of Memphis where he recorded an eponymous album in 2001. That received a Victoire de la Musique ? the French Grammy.

 What about some of the memorable performances over the years? The next one, perhaps, comes the quick quip. 

 But seriously, Cuba was special, so was Hong Kong? and of course, the one with B.B. King was great. Milteau played with the blues legend in 2003. It was a very moving experience to perform with the old man. Milteau ? or JJ ? also met another guitar ace, Eric Clapton, but did not get the chance to play with him.

 His India tour started off with the capital, where people were happy with the performance.

 After the Calcutta concert ? at Kala Kunj on Tuesday evening ? Chennai and Mumbai are next on the list.

 Then, Ill take a vacation in Rajasthan, the Frenchman smiles.

 Milteau performs with three other musicians, as the J.J. Milteau Quartet. Ive played with my guitarist for the past 25 years. As a quartet ? including the drummer and the bassist ? weve been together for the past few years.

 Though there arent plans to collaborate with Indian musicians yet ? I find Indian music rich, but a little complicated ? Milteau loves the common musical heritage that we share.

 Im learning Indian music, you all know about blues... Its becoming a common language we can speak in.

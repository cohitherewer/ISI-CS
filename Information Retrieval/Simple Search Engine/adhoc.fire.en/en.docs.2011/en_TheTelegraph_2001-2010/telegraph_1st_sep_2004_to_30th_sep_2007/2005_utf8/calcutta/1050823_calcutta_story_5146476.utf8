The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dance like this man...

 Prabhudeva and Javed Jaffery will be the judges for the new dance show on STAR Plus, Kaboom

 He?s borne the burden of being billed as India?s answer to Michael Jackson. No wonder his histrionic outings in Sapnay lost hands down to his zig-zag moves in Humse Hai Muqabla. But now Prabhudeva has to fit into the constrained confines of the small screen as he promotes the new dance show on TV, Kaboom.

 ?Dancing has become so much more popular these days,? the actor-dancer-director told Metro from Hyderabad. ?The boom has been possible for the huge number of channels on television now. Earlier, there used to be only Doordarshan. Now, you have music channels like MTV and [V] playing 24x7 on TV. Here in south India, you have people dancing on television all the time.?

 Prabhudeva feels it is idol worship more than anything else that?s got thousands of people in India following their dancing feet. ?We all look up to the international dancing stars and those same English songs are telecast a thousand times. So you watch them and sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously you pick up the steps. Here, the films may flop but the dances become popular.?

 The man who danced his way to glory in Gentleman can?t put a finger on any current trend in dancing. ?In the older days, a single trend would last for five to 10 years,? reveals Prabhudeva. ?But today, it takes three months for a trend to emerge and change. And this is all the more striking in film dance. You don?t even realise when the trend has changed. It?s like growing tall ? you don?t understand when your height has increased.?

 As for his own choreography style, Prabhudeva keeps it straight and simple. ?When we hear songs, we get certain visuals in our heads and that?s what I try to produce when the song is being finally picturised. The songs should be nice to see, kind of a treat to the eyes.?

 That?s how it was when Prabhudeva called the shots to Hrithik Roshan?s moves in Main aisa kyun hoon of Lakshya. When the man is not choreographing dance steps or coming up with his own, he is on to directing films. ?I have always loved watching movies and like cinema as a form of entertainment. I have already directed one film and am now on to number two.?

 Ironically, Prabhudeva?s directorial debut had very little of dance. ?It was a Telugu film called Nu Vastu and of the six songs in the film, four were shown as montage of images rather than with dance moves. The new film is a period drama set in the 1960s. It?s also in Telugu and is called Paurnami. This time, there will be definitely more songs and dances.?

 While many of us may not catch the Telugu flick, we can definitely enjoy Prabhudeva and his electric moves on the small screen as he not only judges the Kaboom contestants but also shakes a leg or two with Javed Jaffery for company. To catch Mr Elastic and more, tune in to STAR Plus this Saturday at 8 pm.

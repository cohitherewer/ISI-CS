The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Funds hurdle in upgrade path

 PRAVEEN KUMAR, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Ajay Pal, Arpita Banerjee, Bimal Bhattacharya, Kaushik Dey, Samir Ghosh and Sanjana Basu

Sanjana Basu: The traffic lights are not working properly at many places. The problem of illegal parking of taxis and trucks on busy roads is also on the rise. Don?t you feel the traffic system needs to be upgraded immediately?

 The traffic infrastructure definitely needs to be upgraded, but there are some hindrances. While Calcutta has an organised traffic system, the district police neither have the infrastructure nor the manpower to manage traffic problems. We are well aware of the lacunae in our system, as well as the hurdles in our way. The main problem is a funds crunch. We are presently taking the help of private bodies to develop infrastructure.

 Since we cannot tackle all the problems at once, for now, only traffic infrastructure in selected areas is being upgraded. An example will illustrate the point: Sector V in Salt Lake is growing as an industrial hub, so we are improving the traffic system in the area on a priority basis. We have chalked out a plan for that and deployed personnel. But to do this, we had to reduce the number of traffic policemen in other areas, thus affecting the traffic management there.

Kaushik Dey: Traffic congestion at the Dakbungalow crossing is a regular feature. Are you doing something about it?

 The Dakbungalow crossing is a busy intersection. All vehicles bound for Bongaon, Basirhat, Barasat and Nadia pass through it. The main reason behind the congestion is that passenger vehicles stop at the crossing to pick up people. Vehicles queue up as a result, causing a snarl. 

 We had deployed several policemen there, but the problem persists. For a permanent solution, the road will have to be widened and the bus stop moved back further.

Ajay Pal: Just outside the Dakshineswar temple, groups of youths force visitors to buy things from them. Are you aware of the problem?

 We hadn?t received any complaint in this regard. We will look into the matter and take action, if necessary. I request the people to inform police as soon as they come across such problems. Dial 100 to lodge a complaint at our control room.

Bimal Bhattacharya: Notorious criminals like Bulton, Hatkata Dilip and Prabhas Dhali have been arrested during your tenure. You also raided the premises of Avtar Singh. Did you face political hurdles while conducting these operations?

 Sometimes politicians come to us with requests, but we cannot afford to entertain them. If we fail to nab criminals, it is the politicians who will point fingers at us.

Ajay Pal: Have you started maintaining records of domestic helps?

 We had started the programme at the three police stations in Salt Lake. But the turnout was demoralising. Though our free registration service is still open, it seems that the people are not aware of this. 

 Unless they come forward and inform us about their helps, we can hardly do anything. It is not possible for us to go from door to door to inquire about domestic helps. There is almost no neighbourhood vigil in Salt Lake and hence, we get little information about criminal activities from residents there.

Samir Ghosh: We often hear that Border Security Force (BSF) personnel do not cooperate with police in border areas like Bongaon. Is there friction between the agencies?

 People staying near the border at times complain against the BSF. There are problems at times between the two agencies when we investigate allegations against BSF personnel.

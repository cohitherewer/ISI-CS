 CM seal for landfill hall 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to inaugurate on Monday a community hall in Ganguly Bagan, allegedly built after filling up a 10-cottah waterbody. 

 Sources said the building plan had not been sanctioned by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The area is in the Assembly constituency of Jadavpur, represented by Bhattacharjee.

 The hall has been built by the Bagha Jatin Colony Committee and the G Block Nagarik Committee.

 Several local residents, including Burdwan sub-divisional judicial magistrate Somnath Mukherjee, had objected to the construction of the hall. They were beaten up by goons allegedly backed by the CPM. Among those assaulted was Mukherjee?s wife. 

 Complaints were lodged with Jadavpur police station, but no action was taken against the attackers. 

 As the building plan has not been approved by the civic body, the hall does not have electricity or water connection. For Monday?s function, however, the organisers have arranged for both, illegally.

 CPM leader Khokan Ghosh Dastidar, husband of local CPM councillor Chandana Ghosh Dastidar, dismissed the allegation that the hall had been built after filling up a pond. 

 ?The area was a low land. It was never a waterbody. Some people had spread lies to thwart the project,?he asserted.

 As for the controversy over the building plan, he said the rules were relaxed in colony areas. ?True, the CMC has certain rules regarding construction of buildings, but they are not operative in the colony areas. You will find a number of buildings here that were built without any sanctioned plan,? he reasoned.

 Some residents alleged that even before the hall was inaugurated, it had been rented out for wedding receptions.

 Ghosh Dastidar countered: ?If necessary, we will pay tax to the civic body.?

 Nani Gopal Chanda, secretary of the Bagha Jatin Colony Committee, said the residents had long felt the need for such a hall. ?Now, some people are spreading lies out of jealousy.?

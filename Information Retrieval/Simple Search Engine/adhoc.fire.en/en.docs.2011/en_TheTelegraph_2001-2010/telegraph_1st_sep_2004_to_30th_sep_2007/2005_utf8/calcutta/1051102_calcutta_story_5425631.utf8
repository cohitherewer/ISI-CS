 - Bengal shortlists 20 projects to implement with central urban renewal scheme funds

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Central funds under the National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM) could push through several proposed transport infrastructure projects in the city and suburbs.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, after a discussion last week with officials of the urban development, environment and transport departments, and the PWD and the CMDA, has shortlisted 20 projects to be implemented with NURM funds. Under consideration is a 21st ? a rotary flyover on BT Road at Dunlop.

 The projects include 10 flyovers, four ramps, dereservation of tram tracks from Maniktala to Kankurgachhi, construction and improvement of four roads and a bridge over Tolly?s Nullah. According to urban development department officials, the Centre has earmarked Rs 1,200 crore for disbursal in five years under specific schemes. The state will have to bear 10 to 15 per cent of the cost of the projects.

 Last month, the Union urban development ministry wrote to the state government seeking a list of projects it intends to implement with the NURM funds. As per the guidelines, the state will have to submit detailed project reports to obtain the funds. 

 Officials at Writers? Buildings said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would announce the launch of the scheme this month. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, they added, had requested the Prime Minister for funds soon after the formation of the scheme was announced in March.

 ?The Prime Minister will announce some of the projects while launching the scheme. We hope a Calcutta project figures on the list,?? said state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.?We must build some flyovers and roads to increase vehicular speed in the city. I don?t think there will be a problem in getting the NURM money for our schemes. With a steady flow of funds from the Centre, the basic infrastructure of the city and its suburbs will get a huge boost,?? Deb added.

 Minister Bhattacharya said the projects have been shortlisted after detailed discussions. ?Some of the project reports have already been prepared, while the others are being prepared. We will submit the detailed reports as and when asked by the Centre,? the minister stated.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said: ?The projects will be implemented according to their priority.?

 The government plans to build flyovers and roads have been hamstrung by paucity of funds. According to senior officials, the state is not in a position to implement any major project without central or foreign aid.

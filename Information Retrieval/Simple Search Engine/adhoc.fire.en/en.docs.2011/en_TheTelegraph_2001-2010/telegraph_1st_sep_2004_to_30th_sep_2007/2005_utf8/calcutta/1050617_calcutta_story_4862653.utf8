The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Neglect has fief in a huff

 OUR BUREAU

 Going by the results of the last civic elections, the vast stretch across Behala and Thakurpukur has been a bastion of the Trinamul Congress. From wards 115 to 132, the party had bagged nine seats. Of the rest, seven went to the CPM and two to the Congress.

 Despite the majority, the Trinamul has not addressed the basic problems here during its five-year tenure at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The areas continue to suffer from an acute crisis of drinking water and waterlogging, which results from an under-developed drainage and sewerage system.

 The drinking water crisis is at its worst in Oxytown, Shibrampur and the Sarsuna satellite township, in ward 127. ?We get water in a trickle. The problem intensifies in summer, when we even have to buy water,? said Sunetra Chakraborty, a resident of Sarsuna.

 Summer gone, the residents brace for another ordeal ? they have to wade through knee-deep water for weeks during rains. 

 CPM?s Nirmal Mukherjee, who has represented the ward for four consecutive terms, alleged that the problems had been raised at the civic council several times, but to no avail. 

 ?Given its track record, how can the Trinamul claim that it?s tenure has been successful?? asked Mukherjee, also leader of the Opposition in the civic body.

 Trinamul candidate Paritosh Majhi, confident of bettering the party?s performance this time, denied Mukherjee?s allegation. ?Nirmalbabu has highlighted problems that have been persisting for many years. What did the CPM do during its 15-year rule to solve them?? he countered. 

 In ward 131, the contest is among women. 

 Congress candidate Ranjana Sarkar is very vocal about the ?non-functional? Trinamul councillor, Sova Ghosh. ?A smart shower drowns Banamali Naskar Road, Dwijen Mukherjee Road, Parnasree, KT Mukherjee Road and their adjacent areas. The drainage system here is in a shambles,? she alleged. 

 The area around the maternity home on Banamali Naskar Road turns into a canal during monsoon and the people have to wade through filthy water, she added.

 Councillor Ghosh, though not ready to believe that the situation is that bad, blamed mayor Subrata Mukherjee for the problems. She claimed that she had tried her best, but only a thorough dredging of Moni and Vidyadhari canals could permanently solve the problem of waterlogging.

 ?A lot of funds were needed for the dredging. Thanks to the mayor?s bias, the money had not been made available,? she alleged.

 Ghosh also came under attack from CPM candidate Nupur Banerjee. ?The ward suffers from a drinking water crisis, though water pipelines from Garden Reach pass through Behala,? Banerjee said.

 Ward 132 has come to acquire a high-profile status as it was represented in the outgoing board by mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee. The Trinamul leader, however, could not solve water problem in his backyard. 

 Residents of the Parnasree government quarters are up in arms. ?The councillor could not assure us when we will get uninterrupted supply of drinking water,? said a resident.

 Chatterjee did not deny the allegations. ?The problem exists in some other areas also. I?ll try to solve it,? he said.

 Residents also complained that Chatterjee had failed to set up the promised swimming pool. In his defence, the councillor said: ?The pond in Parnasree, sought to be converted into a swimming pool, had been dredged at a huge cost. But to give it the desired shape, another Rs 30 lakh is required, which a councillor cannot arrange for. I have approached the local MP and if he extends a helping hand, work will be completed.?

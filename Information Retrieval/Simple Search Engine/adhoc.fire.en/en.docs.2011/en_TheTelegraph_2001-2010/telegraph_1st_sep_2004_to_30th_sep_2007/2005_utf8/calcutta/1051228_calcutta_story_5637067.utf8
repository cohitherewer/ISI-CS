Life

 Bigger and bolder add-on appeal 

 Precious period pieces and bulky junk jewellery, bright plastic hoops and broad waist enhancements mdash; chunky charisma ruled the accessory front. Shradha Agarwal rewinds

 The finer details make all the difference. Maybe, but not this year. Chunk, weight, volume ? whatever the expression, it pretty much defines the style statement of 2005.

 The year clearly wasnt about pretty little finishing touches dotting your appearance. Great, bold accents in all possible shapes, sizes and colours came about suddenly, with the emphasis on over-the-top accessories. All for that one big chance to make the biggest style statement.

 With the bold growing bolder, GoodLife captures the mood of the add-ons that ruled the year.

 Volume speak

 The bigger the better, says couture jeweller Raj Mahtani, who feels that the year saw a Baroque bent. Add a few elements of the Mughal era and a dash of retro, and you get the jewellery story of 2005, he explains.

 The year saw a renewed interest in large, chunky ornaments. Whether it was last years chandelier earrings that became bigger or multiple neckpieces, size surely did matter.

 While power rings caught up internationally, women back home were happy flashing their cocktail rings at parties. Large, uncut diamonds, emeralds and rubies were juxtaposed with heavy metals to create strong, characterised collections.

 Theres a word of caution from Raj: Just like there is a fine line between vulgar-chic and obscene, bold pieces also come with the risk of looking like tribal junk. So, an artistes guiding hand is essential for the right effect.

 Screen style

 Paheli, Parineeta, Antarmahal or Salaam Namaste ? each film defined a particular jewellery look and we the people quickly followed their lead. While some promoted heavy, period pieces like kundan and jadau, others revived the colourful, plastic look of the Seventies.

 Bright, plastic hoops perfectly co-ordinated with each outfit stole the show at almost every teen party, accompanied by colourful totes and matching chappals.

 The big market players in jewellery were raking in the profits too, pushing their couture filmi jewel lines. Ethnic workmanship has definitely been in great demand with period films releasing one after the other, confirmed Anargha Choudhury of Anjali Jewellers. 

 A major hit at Tanishq were the Rani Mukherjee necklaces from Paheli.

 Stone stunner

 Precious or semi-precious, the year was ruled entirely by stones ? on brooches, belts, necklaces and watches.

 The year began with the rose quartz creating a buzz, but soon progressed to brighter stones like malachite and emerald. Accessory designer Vasundhara Mantri touts turquoise as the stone of the year. This blue wonder was splashed everywhere, be it complementing the garment or sewn on it.

 Other than the bedazzling variety of stones, what caught the eye was the innovative designing. People this year wore asymmetrical jewels as well. Two differently stoned earrings or two different designs altogether were pretty much a statement, adds Vasundhara.

 Off beat

 Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta sported them in Salaam Namaste and Sania Mirza flaunted them on and off court. With school uniforms and party gear alike, Nike LiveStrong bands were a real rage all over the city.

 Those yellow bands that began initially to raise funds were seen on practically each young wrist this year. Some matched or contrasted them with their daily outfits, others showed their solidarity by never parting with their prized ones. So what if most of what was visible was fake.

 But thats what has killed the real purpose, rues Sourav Chatterjee, partner amp; CEO of HighLife Management.

 Any trend reaches the grass-root level after being endorsed by celebrities. Now they have become so common and such a strong fashion statement, that the original patrons have stopped wearing them, says Sourav.

 Other unusual accents like Turkish beads, safety pins and mother-of-pearls were also seen in generous doses. 

 Waist wows

 Big, broad belts worn over kaftans or kurtas or built-in as part of tops were common sights to stumble upon. Indeed, the waist is where many accessories sat this year.

 Broad belts, sometimes two or three bunched together, worked wonders to add a glamorous tinge to your ensemble.

 Apart from the broad cloth belts, the other piece that was really big this year was the 60-inch long strands, embellished with sequins, zari, beads or stones, says designer Agnimitra Paul. 

 While you can always accentuate your waistline with this piece, Agnimitra suggests the throw of this belt around the neck. Wear it as a stole or a necklace. You can also tie up your hair with it.

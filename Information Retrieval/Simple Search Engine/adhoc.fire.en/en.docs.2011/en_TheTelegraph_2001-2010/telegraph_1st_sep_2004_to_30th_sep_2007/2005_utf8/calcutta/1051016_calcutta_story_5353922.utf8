The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

The mark of a Merc

Would it matter as much if the German car company brought 

its entire product range to our streets?

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

Earlier this month, work took me to Germany. I spent 

all of two days in a beautiful little town in Bavaria called Nuremberg. On the 

first working day, my host took me out for lunch to a quaint restaurant in one 

of the main squares of the city. Lunch was delicious. We ate Nuremberg sausages, 

a local delicacy, served with potato salad. The meal was washed down with generous 

quantities of Bavarian beer. The beer glasses were so large that to toast, their 

bases had to be clinked rather than their top.

After lunch, we were walking through the main square 

of the town. I was enjoying myself ? partly because of the beer and partly due 

to the sunny weather. The host said he would leave me alone for a while and pick 

me up an hour later. I walked a little and then the beer inside me started protesting. 

I obeyed and sat down on the steps at the base of a wish fountain.

That is when I noticed them ? a series of taxis waiting 

in a designated area. All of them were Mercedes Benz. I know Merc is a German 

car but to see so many offering paid rides was a surprise. I had taken a taxi 

when I landed in town. I rued not having noticed what brand of car it was.

And then I saw the small truck passing by, the kind 

we call Matador in Calcutta. This had a similar flat front. Right in the middle 

of its face was the famous symbol of Mercedes. That was kind of jarring. I checked 

with my host later. He confirmed that in Germany Mercedes makes cars that span 

all price classes ? from the cheapest to the most expensive. The contrast was 

stark.

I was reminded of a chance meeting with the sales 

chief of Mercedes in Calcutta. He mistook me for a prospective buyer. In his sales 

spiel, he said little about the car or its capabilities. He just rattled off names 

of owners of Mercedes in Calcutta. They were all real big shots. He was luring 

me with undeserved membership of that elite league. All this made me wonder what 

would happen to this exclusive Mercedes image if they came to India with their 

full product range ? from minitrucks to minicars as well as the flagships, the 

E class and S class sedans.

Would its classy image get diluted? The scenario is 

not all that unreal. A growing Indian auto market could well force Mercedes to 

consider making India a full portfolio destination. What then? Maybe one option 

would be to clearly segregate the role of the mother brand Mercedes and the constituent 

brands for each price category. The mother brand provides the umbrella cover. 

It concentrates on only emitting functional imageries: precision engineering, 

safety, dependability, state-of-the-art technology... These are attributes that 

do not get vitiated by the price of the car. The sub-brands take on the flanks. 

They get busy creating lifestyle and personality imagery appropriate for the price 

class in which they are operating. That certainly is a way out, but hardly the 

optimum solution. 

The moot point will remain ? would the mark Mercedes 

be able to carry the classy image despite being constantly challenged by the presence 

of its Maruti 800 variants. More so, as the brand Mercedes is being asked to perform 

a role, that role does nothing to nurture its main asset in the Indian market. 

It would be like asking Ronaldo to play as a sweeper back.

My return trip started at 5.30 in the morning. It 

was dark, cold and raining. I took the pain to go to the front of the car. It 

was a Mercedes. My ride felt a lot smoother. I wondered whether I would have felt 

the same way if I had taken a Mercedes taxi from Sealdah station.

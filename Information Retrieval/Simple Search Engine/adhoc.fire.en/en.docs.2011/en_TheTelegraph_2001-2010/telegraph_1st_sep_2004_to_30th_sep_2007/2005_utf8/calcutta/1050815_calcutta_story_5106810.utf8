 Tech boon in eyecare

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 A hi-tech machine which will be installed at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology (RIO) next week is expected to revolutionise corneal transplant in public-sector eyecare in eastern India.

 Eye Bank Specular Microscope Kerato Analyser, imported from the US through the Eye Bank Association and National Prevention Programme for Control of Blindness, will provide a better chance of restored vision to patients who are to undergo a transplant.

 Most of these patients usually stand a high risk of blurred vision or even complete loss of sight, as the critical transparency factor of the cornea is evaluated manually.

 Several factors have to be taken into account after the donated eye is received from the dead person. The cornea?s transparency is a primary one.

 ?The endothelium cell count reveals whether the level of transparency of the donor cornea is over 1,500. Only if the condition is met is it fit for use,? explained Himadri Dutta, professor at RIO.

 ?However, now, we determine the transparency of the cornea by examining it under a slit lamp with the naked eye. As a result, the possibility of the cornea becoming hazy or opaque after the transplant increases. If that happens, the patient?s vision may get blurred, with greater chances of his/her going completely blind,? he added.

 The manual process is not only unreliable, it eats into precious time before the grafting. 

 ?The new machine, to be introduced for the first time in the public eyecare system in the region, will give us the exact endothelium count for accurate determination of the transparency of the cornea. This will root out the risk of the patient losing the restored vision,? Dutta pointed out.

 A major portion of the Rs 10 lakh spent on the Eye Bank Specular Microscope Kerato Analyser has been provided by the Centre?s National Prevention Programme for Control of Blindness.

 Over 100 blind persons are awaiting cornea graft at the RIO, the premier state-run eyecare institute in the region.

 ?The patients registered with us stay at our hospital for a specified period. If a healthy cornea is available within the duration of the patient?s stay, we graft it,? said Dutta.

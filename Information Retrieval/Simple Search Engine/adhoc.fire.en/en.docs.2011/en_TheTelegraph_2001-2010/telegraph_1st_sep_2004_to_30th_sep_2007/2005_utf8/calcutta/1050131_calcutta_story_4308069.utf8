The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro-style messages on trains

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 You?ve heard it underground. You?ll hear it on local trains soon. Taking a leaf out of the Metro Railway success story, the Eastern Railway (ER) has decided to introduce a public address system in local trains. ?The system will be started on an experimental basis,? a senior ER official told Metro.

 The announcer will inform commuters whether the train will stop at all stations, the name of the next station and the direction of the platform. Besides, norms that passengers are required to follow will be announced in Bengali, Hindi and English. Music will intersperse the announcements. 

 The pilot project will be started within a couple of months on a rake that will run on the South section of the ER?s Sealdah division.

 The system, to be operated by the guards, will be run by a microprocessor-based announcer module, officials said. The rake was manufactured at the Jessop factory last November.

 The railways have adopted a policy of installing in-built public address systems and tape recorders at both ends of new rakes of suburban trains. 

 ?It is our duty to improve passenger amenities and minimise their grievances. So, we have decided to introduce the system. The announcements will also work towards reducing tension among commuters who are not daily passengers,? explained an official. More than 1.1 million passengers commute daily on nearly 700 EMU trains on both Howrah and Sealdah divisions. 

 Earlier, the authorities had introduced ?piped music? in coaches of some rakes. Songs ranging from Rabindrasangeet to adhuniks by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Manna De and Shyamal Mitra used to be played. 

 According to officials, a private agency was given the contract to operate the system and earn revenue through advertisement jingles, much like the system followed on the Metro Railway.

 The ?piped music? stopped on the Sealdah division on expiry of the contract. ?We expect to reintroduce it in Sealdah soon,? the official said.

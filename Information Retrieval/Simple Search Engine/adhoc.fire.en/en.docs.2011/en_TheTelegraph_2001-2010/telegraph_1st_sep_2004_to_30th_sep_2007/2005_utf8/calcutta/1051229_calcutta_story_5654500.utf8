The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bachchan box-office buzz

 - Father rides sympathy wave, son creates own fan following

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

The box-office score in the last month of the year: 2 out of 15. The last men left standing: Bachchan and Bachchan.

 The city where father and son ? in that order ? can?t go wrong has shored up Ek Ajnabee, Amitabh Bachchan?s final release of the year. While other metros have given the stranger in town the cold shoulder, Calcutta has been loyal to its favourite ? and ailing ? hero.

 The gut reaction to the film has even taken producer Bunty Walia by surprise. ?Right from the initial opening till date, Ek Ajnabee?s done the best business in Bengal. It?s surprising for us, but a welcome development especially when the response has been low-key in other territories,? he tells Metro.

 But favouring the Sarkar doesn?t mean blacking out the Bluffmaster!. Far from it, in fact. ?Despite a weak start, Abhishek?s Bluffmaster! has emerged as the most-sought-after movie in the last week,? reveals 89 Cinemas vice-president Prashant Srivastava about the December 16 release. ?It?s doing very well in Calcutta, which has always supported Abhishek?s films, even when he was dishing out flops.?

 In the grip of Bachchan mania, the city cine-goer has all but turned a blind eye to the flesh factor of Neal ?N? Nikki and Kalyug or the friendship factor of Dosti and Vaah! Life Ho To Aisi. Even the 25-ft King Kong has been dwarfed by the family show.

 Having played everything from chor-police to baap-beta in a year that?s incurred losses worth crores for the film industry, Bachchan and Bachchan have kept Bollywood afloat. And between them, the duo has accounted for no less than Rs 5 crore of the annual gross earnings at the city multiplexes.

 With Ek Ajnabee continuing to notch up an average of 80 per cent occupancy every week, and Bluffmaster! making the most of the campus buzz and festive feel, it?s time for the city plexes to raise a toast to the tall twosome. ?Amitabh, of course, is a national hero and now Abhishek, too, can command the box-office on his own,? feels Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum).

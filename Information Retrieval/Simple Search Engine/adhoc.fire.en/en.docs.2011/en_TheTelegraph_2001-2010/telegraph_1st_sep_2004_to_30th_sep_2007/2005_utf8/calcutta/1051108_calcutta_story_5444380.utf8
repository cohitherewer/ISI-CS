 Thanks to the Pollution Control Board, patients at state-run hospitals might be able to enjoy a less noisy Dussehra and Diwali from next year.

 Caught off-guard by the board?s raids at two state healthcare facilities on Diwali night, the government has directed the superintendents of the hospitals to ensure that silence is maintained on the premises. It has also instructed the superintendents to ask the employees to show restraint during festivities from now on.

 The matter will be discussed in detail at a high-level meeting in Swasthya Bhavan next week.

 On Diwali night, a special team of the pollution control board had found that the organisers of the Kali puja on the SSKM premises were playing music on loudspeakers and bursting crackers. The situation was not much different at NRS, where the families of the resident staff members were also violating the noise norms wilfully.

 ?We have asked the medical superintendents-cum-vice principals of all the medical colleges and hospitals in the city to ask the employees and residents of the quarters on the premises to abide by the rules of noise-free zones. The effort to minimise noise inside the hospitals will continue throughout the year, and not just during festivities,? asserted director of medical education Jayashree Mitra.

 The health secretary and Mitra will attend the meeting on noise pollution in hospitals, apart from senior officers of the state health directorate. They will try to chalk out a plan to keep hospitals free of noise.

 The superintendents have also been asked to generate awareness among the employees, including doctors and other medical staff, regarding noise pollution. Drivers of vehicles entering the hospitals will be asked not to use horns and maintain silence.

 The state hospitals are plagued by noise problems throughout the year. Taxis, cars and other vehicles enter the premises at all times of the day and night, and quite often use loud electronic horns. The situation is compounded by the fact that a majority of the hospitals are located on busy thoroughfares and near important intersections. 

 ?Patients as well as doctors and medical staff are victims of noise pollution. It is extremely noisy inside the hospital throughout the year. The government?s initiative is welcome; something needs to done immediately to cut down on the decibel level,? stated an NRS doctor.

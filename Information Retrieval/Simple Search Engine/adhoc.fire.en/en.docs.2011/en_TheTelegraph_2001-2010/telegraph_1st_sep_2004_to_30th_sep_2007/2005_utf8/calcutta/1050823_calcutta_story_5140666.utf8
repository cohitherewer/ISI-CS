 State wheels in with driving lessons

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Frustrated with the quality of drivers being churned out by the private institutes, the state transport department has decided to set up motor training schools in the city.

 According to officials of the department, six such institutes will initially be set up at the CSTC depots. The number will later be increased, as per demand.

 Senior state bus drivers and automobile engineers will provide training in handling both light and heavy vehicles at the institutes. The fees will be nominal, compared with the private institutes.

 ?The depots house a lot of vacant space. Besides, we have experienced drivers, qualified automobile engineers, skilled motor mechanics and good infrastructure. By mobilising our resources and utilising the skill of our employees, we can produce the best drivers,? asserted transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 He added: ?Our aim is to produce drivers who will not only drive well but also understand the functioning of the machinery within a vehicle. The private institutes teach students how to operate the steering, clutch and the brake, and do not provide sufficient knowledge on the supporting mechanism. An expert driver must have a basic idea about the functioning of an automobile, some preliminary idea on spare parts and know the rules of the road inside out.?

 The minister opined that the mushrooming of motor training schools would stop once the state institutes join the fray.

 As per norms, a driver must have basic knowledge of the insides of a vehicle, particularly the chassis, engine, and the fuel and cooling systems. He must also know about the major spare parts and the vehicle rules.

 ?The ability to drive is not the only criteria for obtaining a driving licence. One must drive efficiently and know what makes a car move. Most new drivers do not have any idea about their vehicles,?? explained officials.

 At present, there are 60 training institutes in the city that produce about 15,000 drivers a year. Most admit students on a contract basis, against a one-time fee, ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000.

 Some institutes offer ?a package?, which includes training and ?arrangement of driving licence?. Most aspirants opt for the package deals.

 The owners of the training institutes have ?an understanding? with a section of the public vehicles department (PVD) officials, who help in the procurement of driving licences, said the transport department staff.

 To reap advantage of this arrangement, youths from the city, districts and even the neighbouring states flock to the schools. A driver?s licence makes them eligible for several jobs.

 PVD officials were of the opinion that under-trained drivers were mainly responsible for the increase in road accidents and violation of traffic rules.

 Bimal Guha, general secretary of Motor Training Institute, however, claimed that nobody wanted to spend time and money on being properly trained.

 The move by the transport department promises to provide gainful employment to state bus drivers over the age of 50, who in the near future will be disallowed to drive vehicles.

 Those who obtain training at the new institutes would also be employable by the department. Over a thousand drivers are immediately needed by the various state transport corporations.

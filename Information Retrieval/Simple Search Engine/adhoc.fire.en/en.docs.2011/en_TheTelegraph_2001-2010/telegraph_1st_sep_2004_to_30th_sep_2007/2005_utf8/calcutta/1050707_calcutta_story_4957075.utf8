 IT mix with management

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eastern Institute of Management (EIM) has joined hands with central government-owned Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) to launch a nine-month programme, post-graduate diploma in enterprise application software (PGDEAS). 

 ?There is a feedback from the market that management professionals lack skills in information technology (IT) and technical wizards at times stumble due to their poor understanding of management issues. We have designed the programme dovetailing management and IT,? explained Amit Sengupta, director, EIM. 

 From database management to financial management and web technology to human resources management, the course has been designed keeping in mind the objective of blending business management with technical topics. 

 According to Sengupta, the fast growing IT and business process outsourcing sector in the state is looking for people with management and technical expertise. 

 ?That?s why the tie-up with ECIL is really critical. We have expertise in management education and so, we will look after the management side of the curriculum. On the other hand, ECIL will steer the technical side of the course,? he said.

 The faculty members will be drawn from both EIM and ECIL, a government of India enterprise under the department of atomic energy. 

 For the programme, to be kicked off shortly with a batch of around 30 to 40 students, the institute is looking for both experienced professionals and fresh graduates. 

 Classes will be held five times a week and the curriculum will have an optimal mix of theoretical and practical sessions. The course is priced at Rs 30,000. 

 ?The course will add value to experienced professionals. It will enable fresh graduates to apply for entry-level positions in IT and BPO industry,? said Sengupta, while promising placement assistance to students signing up for the programme. 

 Besides, the techno-commercial programme will also improve the students? knowledge in various functional areas and sharpen their entrepreneurial skills.

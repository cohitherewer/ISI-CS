 Sun powers New Town address 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has taken up a Rs 11.5 crore project to set up a solar housing estate in New Town, Rajarhat.

 Announcing the project on Wednesday, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said it was the first of its kind in the country. ?There are similar housing estates in the US, Germany and Japan. In our country, we are doing it for the first time in New Town. The Centre has agreed to provide Rs 1 crore, and the rest of the cost will be raised from the buyers.?

 Work, particularly drawing and designing, will begin from July 1. The project will be implemented jointly by the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA) and Bengal DCL, and is expected to be completed by December 2006.

 The minister said the complex ? comprising 24 houses with solar panel-fitted roofs ? will come up on 105 cottahs in Action Area I. The land has already been provided by Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town. Each house will have 1,800 sq ft of super built-up area, including a garage.

 The rooftop photovoltaic cells will generate about 240 units of electricity, which a household will get free. Additional requirements will be met from conventional sources. ?If a consumer uses 500 units of power a month, he will pay for half the amount. Use of solar energy for heating water will earn a rebate of 40 paise per unit, up to 200 units,? minister Banerjee elaborated.

 Besides, a house-owner will have the option of selling solar power to the electricity grid. If a house-owner goes on a holiday for a fortnight or a month, he can feed the electricity generated from solar energy to the power grid.

 WBREDA director S.P. Gan Chowdhury said the hot water requirement of a house could be met with solar power and the building would remain cool in summer due to adoption of passive solar technology.

 For all the trappings, the minister admitted that the houses would be out of bounds for the middle class, as they are likely to be priced between Rs 38 lakh and Rs 40 lakh.

 ?Minus the solar panels, the houses will cost Rs 28 lakh each. We know they are not what the common people can afford. We are taking up the project as an experiment and are keeping only a marginal profit,? he claimed.

 Several NRIs have shown interest in the houses, which will be sold through lottery. The Calcutta Port Trust, apparently, wants to buy one and use it as a guest house.

 Wooing women mid-week 

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Discrimination of a different 

 kind has hit the city night spots, with cool discounts on 

 offer to get the gals in the mood.

 Pretty young party things are being pampered mid-week, with free entry and discounts on drinks. While men muscle their way through most nightclubs in the city on weekends, far outnumbering the women, the ladies special nights have spawned quite a trend.

 Most nightclubs in the city worth their DJ console have dedicated Wednesdays exclusively to women. Discounts of around 50 per cent on beverages, free entry and specialised service complete the package.

 Watch out guys. Be on your best behaviour and hope the girls throw a wink ? and a cheap drink ? your way.

 This is just a gesture to help ladies loosen up mid-week and feel more at home here than on congested weekends, explains Subir Das, assistant food and beverages manager, The Kenilworth. Big Ben, the pub at the hotel, started off with the concept mid-May with fashion shows to give ladies something extra and hopes to continue the practice for the next two months at least. 

 At other haunts, the hospitality extends to extra attention on other days as well. We always give ladies preference when it comes to seating, says DJ Girish at Sisha. This translates into a gang of girls getting to plonk on the comfortable low-seating couches at the hookah bar, even if a group of guys has made a beeline for it way before! 

 Girish also vouches for rigorous screening at the entrance to ensure the wrong kind of crowd doesnt mar the girls fun.

 The royal treatment continues with Starstruck Retro Lounge welcoming women on Wednesdays with a complementary glass of wine and unlimited refills for just Rs 350. There are 10 to 20 per cent discounts on other drinks as well, but with a choice of red, white and rose wine from Indian brands like Rivera, who can refuse the unlimited offer! 

 Women and wine are known to mix very well and the concept is picking up every week since we started the first Wednesday of this month, says Probhashish Sanyal, manager, Starstruck.

 The chill bill is slashed further with places like Big Ben offering free entry to a ladys partner as well on a Wednesday, whereas on a regular day there is a cover charge for a couple. An offer of a drink free for an order of every two drinks also stands at the pub. 

 In competition, Tantra offers 

 a discount of 50 per cent on all beverages for women on 

 Wednesdays. Spicing things up further, it has started the 

 concept of Chromosome Nights, with a distinct theme for 

 each night. Think Pink, Retro and Red Rage have been some 

 such themes where guests are encouraged to have more fun 

 by donning theme gear. Those who stick to the theme are 

 rewarded with complementary drinks and other prizes.

 The idea is to create an exclusive hangout zone where girls rule, considering that on a regular weekend there are normally two men to every woman, says Namrata Ray, manager, events and entertainment, The Park, Calcutta. 

 But girls wanna have still more fun. Vidisha, a regular at Tantra, sums up the mood: Earlier, womens special nights used to be more spicy at Tantra with male striptease and other naughty side shows!

 So now you know the secret behind that bleary but cheery face on a Thursday morning!

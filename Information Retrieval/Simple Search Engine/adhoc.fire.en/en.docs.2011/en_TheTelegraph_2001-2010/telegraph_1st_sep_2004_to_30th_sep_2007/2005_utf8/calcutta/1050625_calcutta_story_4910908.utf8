 Grab a Chicken Cheese Sandwich en route to your cubicle, bite into a Fish Roll for your evening snack, enjoy a Chocolate Mousse at 2 am... 

 Move over elaborate coffee shops; enter, the no-frills food kiosks serving up food and beverages. The small coffee vending machines and ice cream scoops tucked way in a corner in Landmark and Shoppers Stop are telltale signs of a quiet revolution.

 Coffee Day Xpress, a division of Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Company Limited which also owns the Caf? Coffee Day chain, has been serving hungry stomachs hard-pressed for time. Chances are in the next nine months you will find such much-on-the-run addresses dotting several roadsides ? not for you to hang out but to satisfy your hunger pangs.

 The Caf? Coffee Day outlets are the premium hangouts of the company. The swank ambience, good music and the elaborate menu attract many. But they generally cater to people who have lots of time on their hands and dont want to spend just Rs 20 over a cup of coffee, said Sandip K. Mukherjee, president, Coffee Day Xpress, in the city where expansion is the mantra.

 On the other hand, Coffee Day Xpress serves a chunk of people who want to either take away or grab a quick bite. Keeping that segment in mind, we started the Coffee Day Xpress two-and-a-half years ago, said Mukherjee. The first food kiosk was set up in a petrol pump in Bangalore. Today, Coffee Day Xpress has 307 outlets in 13 cities, 80 per cent of which are franchises.

 In Calcutta alone, the coffee chain has 13 outlets that will grow to 25 by the end of this fiscal. Weve been in Calcutta for quite some time. The city shows promise but it isnt at par with Delhi or Bangalore. With a lot of malls, stores and BPO units coming in, we expect the business to skyrocket, said Mukherjee.

 The strategy of the company here would be the same as in other cities. The target areas are the high streets, suburbs and BPO units. We operate in areas where people either dont want to spend much or dont have time for coffee or snacks, added Mukherjee.

 The food and beverage menu at Coffee Day Xpress differs from that of Caf? Coffee Day. The grub is easy to take away and prices are 50 per cent lower than that in the premium coffee shop.

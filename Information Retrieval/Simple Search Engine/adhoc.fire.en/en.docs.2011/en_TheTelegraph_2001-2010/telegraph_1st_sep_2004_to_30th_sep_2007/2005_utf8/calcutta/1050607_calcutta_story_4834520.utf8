 Three boys ? two brothers and their cousin ? were drowned in a pond near their home in the Cossipore area on Monday morning when they went to take a bath. 

 Nearly an hour after they were drowned, local residents dug out Wasim Akram, 14, his brother Shamim Akhtar, 12, and their cousin Hyder Ali, 12, from the muddy bed of the pond. All three were residents of Khagen Chatterjee Road, under Cossipore police station. 

 ?They were taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where they were pronounced dead,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 The boys defied Sheikh Anwar Ali, Hyder?s father, and slipped out of home to the pond near their house. 

 Another cousin, Alam, witnessed the drowning. He said Wasim first went under the surface. When Hyder tried to help him out, both drowned. Shamim ran to their rescue and disappeared himself. About 20 youths fished out the three bodies around 11.30 am.

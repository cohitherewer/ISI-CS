 - WRITING ON THE WALL

 The city can?t go into an election without its walls being defaced. That?s the rule, notable exceptions notwithstanding.

 But if the awareness about visual pollution, now restricted among a handful of political functionaries, gains ground, Calcuttans can hope to see the rule reversed.

 The upcoming civic elections, as an encouraging start, will see a number of candidates, including mayor Subrata Mukherjee, opt for alternative modes of communication to reach out to the masses.

 ?I resorted to the conventional mode in the last polls, but this time, there will be no graffiti,? stresses Debasish Kumar, councillor of ward 85 and a mayoral aide.

 ?Last time, house-owners were assured that their walls would be cleaned after the elections were over. But I failed to keep the promise. Besides, one has to admit that splashing a coat of lime does not restore a defaced wall to its original condition,? adds Kumar. 

 Dibyendu Biswas, councillor of ward 90, did not indulge in wall-writing in the past couple of elections. He knows that an election can be fought and won even without graffiti, as ?there are banners, festoons and posters? to take the message to the voters.

 Councillor Mala Roy is emphatic that it would amount to ?double standard if the candidates preach about environment and deface the walls at the same time?.

 Sovondeb Chattopadhyay, Trinamul candidate taking on the mayor in ward 87, claims that his supporters are confining themselves to drawing ?sketches on environmental issues and various comic characters on a few walls?.

 CPM mayoral candidate Bikash Bhattacharya feels graffiti ?is a cost-effective and convenient way to reach out to the people, especially those who do not have access to the media, but it creates a bad impression about the city?.

 He thinks ?obtaining permission from the house-owner? is not a problem and calls for ?a political consensus? against the practice.

 Environmentalist Subhas Dutta attributes the change in the mindset in a section of politicians to the growing dislike for wall-writing among middle-class and upper middle-class voters.

 ?Whatever the reasons, the trend is undoubtedly very encouraging,? observes state election commission secretary K.K. Chakrabarty. Officials clarify that like the Central election commission, the state body, too, has banned wall-writing on government buildings. As for private properties, it?s allowed only if the owner provides consent.

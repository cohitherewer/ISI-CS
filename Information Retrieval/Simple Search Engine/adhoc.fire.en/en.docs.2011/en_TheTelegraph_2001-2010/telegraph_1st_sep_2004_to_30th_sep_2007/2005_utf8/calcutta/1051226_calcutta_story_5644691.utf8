 Artery block boon

 A STAFF REPORTER

 C.P. Gupta, 65, suffered a massive cardiac arrest earlier this month and was rushed to a private hospital in the city. Her condition deteriorated further due to diabetes. A drug-eluting coronary stent is what saved her life. She is recovering well and should be able to take part in the New Year celebrations. 

 ?Drug-eluting stents are proving to be the most effective means of treating coronary artery diseases,? stated E. Grenadier, consultant cardiologist at Technion-IIT, Hafia, Israel, during a recent lecture tour of the city.

 The doctor mostly spoke on angioplasty and drug-coated stents. ?I interacted and shared my experience in the field of drug-eluting stents with some city specialists,? was how he described his visit.

 The tour coincided with the launch of Endeavor, the second-generation drug-coated stent by Medtronic, a leading manufacturer of medical equipment. 

 Coronary artery diseases generally occur when a waxy substance called plaque builds up on the inside walls of an artery. The deposit causes narrowing of the artery, decreasing blood and oxygen supply to different parts of the body.

 Coronary artery bypass grafting is a common surgical process to create a new path for blood around the blocked artery. Other processes, like balloon angioplasty, are also used for the purpose.

 A stent is a tiny, expandable, mesh-like tube that acts as a scaffold inside the artery and helps to keep it open after angioplasty.

 With advances in technology, stents have proved to be very effective in tackling artery blockage. They are placed on the narrowed portions of the artery during balloon angioplasty.

 Drug-eluting stents provide the same structural support as ordinary stents. In addition, they are designed to release medicines slowly. 

 ?In case of bare metal stents, it has been observed that there is re-narrowing of the artery in 30 per cent of the patients,? said Rabin Chakraborty, cardiologist of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. 

 ?Drug-eluting stents bring down the percentage to less than three,? he signed off.

 It was a class for teachers, but the teachers were busy playing Chinese whisper, pinning names behind one another and repeating words that sounded the same to the untrained ear but meant completely different things.

 The chanting of the words was particularly important for ?teacher? Rie Haseqawa. ?Most teachers tend to overlook the importance of oral learning, so my focus was on how one can help students develop and improve pronunciation,? said Rie.

 The language adviser at the Japan Foundation office New Delhi was conducting a seminar for teachers of Japanese at the Indo-Japan Welfare and Cultural Association on Ballygunge Circular Road. 

 The event, taking place after several years, was a collaborative effort by the Eastern India Japanese Language Teachers Association, the Japan Foundation, New Delhi, and the Japan Consulate, Calcutta.

 According to Dwijendra Nath Bakshi, director-lecturer, Centre of Japanese Studies, Delhi is showing great interest in promoting Japanese education following the Prime Minister?s recent Japan tour, during which he learnt that Japanese companies were looking for Indian IT students who know both English and Japanese.

 A recent communication from the Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council states that ?under the Language Related Market Access Facilitation Initiative approved by the department of commerce, government of India?, there can be a reimbursement of 50 per cent of tuition fees paid by Indian software firms and IT students to Japanese language institutes in India.

 ?In Calcutta, Japanese is not taught at the school or college level. There are many private institutes, but no university except Visva-Bharati has the subject in its curriculum. That is likely to change, because Delhi has offered to back the setting up of Japanese courses in established educational institutions,? said Bakshi.

 And just how may Calcuttans care to learn the language? ?The tally has remained steady at about 400 students,? said vice-consul Tsuyoshi Fukaya, But there are around 10,000 students all over India and the number is growing. 

 Most students of Japanese in India are over 25. For a few, it is a labour of love or cultural curiosity, for most it is seen to be the key to greater professional things.

 Monday?s seminar saw teachers from Visva-Bharati?s Nippon Bhavan and Uttar Siksha Sadan, a B.Tech teacher from the National Institute of Science and Technology, Behrampur, representatives from the Ramakrishna Mission, Japanese Language Academy, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society, Jadavpur University (foreign language department), Federation Hall and Kenkyu Center.

 Rie explained how in Taiwan, students are mostly housewives, in China they are school-goers, in France they are university graduates, while in India, where Japanese teachers find it easier to settle because of the relaxed visa rules, students have better opportunities. But why not teach Japanese students in Japan? ?It is more interesting to teach foreign students,? smiled Rie.

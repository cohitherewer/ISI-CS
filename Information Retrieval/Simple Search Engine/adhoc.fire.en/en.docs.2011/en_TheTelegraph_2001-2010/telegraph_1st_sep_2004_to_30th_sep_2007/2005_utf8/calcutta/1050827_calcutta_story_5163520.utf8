 Oh! Calcutta, the multi-speciality restaurant at Forum, is hosting an Anglo-Indian food festival between August 26 and September 4. The highlight of the festival is the range of authentic herbs and spices that marks Anglo-Indian cuisine.

 Theres a strong emphasis on herbs and spices in Anglo-Indian cooking. So, most of the dishes in our festival are being cooked with the finest of herbs and spices I came across after a lot of research, says chef Joy, whos dishing out the delectable spread.

 On offer are delicacies like the crispy hot Chicken Pantheras (a form of pan roll) and Stuffed Tomatoes for starters. Non-vegetarian food is the mainstay of the cuisine and in the main course one can gorge on mouth-watering specialities like Hilsa or Mutton Vindaloo (mutton or fish marinated with malt vinegar and red wine and slow-cooked to perfection), Dak Bungalow Chicken (roasted chicken in a sharp tomato gravy with a pinch of star anise), Fish in Almond Cream (betki fillets cooked in almond cream and dry white wine) and Prawn Temperado (prawns cooked in a gravy of chopped onions, chillies, coconut milk and lemon juice).

 Theres a wide range of cocktails to accompany the food fare. A meal for two at the festival could cost anywhere between Rs 250 and Rs 270, plus taxes.

 Festive feast

 Gokuls Tit-Bits, a vegetarian eatery at 1, AJC Bose Road, has launched an array of Phalahari food especially for Janmashtami. On offer till August 27, the festive fare is being cooked up by chefs flown down from Rajasthan and Gujarat to ensure authenticity.

 The occasion marking the birth of Lord Krishna is very auspicious for Marwaris and Gujaratis. The bhog offered to the lord on the occasion includes items like puri, aloo subzi, Kutti Dhokla, Sakargandi, Aloo Sira, Dhaniya Panjeeri and a host of other savouries that are tedious to make at home. So, we are preparing all these items just like it would be done at home so that people can buy the bhog from us, says Aruna Balasaria, co-owner of the restaurant. 

 During the festival, we abstain from cereals like wheat. Keeping this in mind, the base of all the snacks is Kutti atta and Rajgari atta, she adds.

 The sweet and snacks corner is an assortment of traditional specialities like Rajgari Thepla, Magaz Barfi, Ajwain Barfi, Goond Chakki, Chironji Pak, Panchmewa Goond, Kheera Bij Barfi, Keshariya Parwal, Kumbdaha Goti, Keshariya Kumbdaha, Mishri Peda, Fafad Bhujia, Tal Makhana, Aloo Sabudana Pakodi and Fafad Puri Aloo Sag.

 so on offer are favourites like Aloo Tikiya, Aloo Chop, Aloo Pakodi, laddu and Nariyal Barfi.

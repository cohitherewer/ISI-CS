 - Airline bait to boost Bengal as tourist hub

 After marketing exotic foreign locations to Calcuttans, it?s now time to market Calcutta and the state to foreigners.

 As a step in that direction, Singapore Airlines is undertaking a promotional campaign by bringing tour operators from abroad to the city.

 On February 22, the airline will fly in 15 overseas agents on a five-day promotional, during which they will travel to Darjeeling and Santiniketan.

 ?We want Calcutta to be a tourist hub in eastern India. We will show the agents the enormous tourism potential of Bengal,? said Bharat Mahadevan, regional manager (east), Singapore Airlines.

 The airline, he added, has received encouraging response from agents in Australia, Japan and South Korea. 

 It is tying up with the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC), which will prepare tour packages and look after the ?land arrangements?.

 ?The airline will bring in tourists and we will take care of the rest. The visitors will be put up at our lodges, as well as private hotels,? explained Sailen Bhattacharya, WBTDC managing director. 

 Besides Bengal, the other destinations being targeted are Bodh Gaya, Puri and Sikkim. ?Calcutta, however, will be the gateway. It?s from here that the tourists will proceed towards their favoured stops,? said Mahadevan. 

 If the promotional campaign goes off well, the airline will roll out more such trips.

 The idea was floated in December when airline vice-president Tan Chik Quee called on commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen at Writers? Buildings. Sen had reportedly assured Tan of all cooperation in tapping the state?s tourism potential.

 Darjeeling alone, Mahadevan stressed, is capable of attracting as many tourists as Bali. ?We?re thinking of tying up with Indian Airlines to operate flights to Bagdogra.?

 In 2004, Singapore Airlines had registered a 50 per cent growth in passenger traffic over the previous year. It now operates three Boeing 777 flights every week on the Calcutta-Singapore route.

 ?We are also thinking of announcing special fares for the agents so they can prepare competitive package tours,? Mahadevan informed Metro.

 According to industry insiders, India is perceived to be impeded by two major deterrents in fully exploiting its tourism potential. They are hotels and infrastructure.

 ?Hotels here are very expensive compared with Bali or Bangkok. And the infrastructure to cater to foreign travellers is lacking,? pointed out a travel agent.

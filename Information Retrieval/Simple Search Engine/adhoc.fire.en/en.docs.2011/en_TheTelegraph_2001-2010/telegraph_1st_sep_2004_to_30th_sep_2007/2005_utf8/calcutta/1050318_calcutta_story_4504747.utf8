 Haute summer bride

 What do you do when lovebirds can?t wait till the cosy winters to tie the knot? If you thought sweating it out in heavy Benarasis and Kanjeevarams was the only way to bless the couple harbouring a midsummer night?s dream, breathe easy in flowing georgettes and crepes.

 If there is no limit when it comes to dressing up for a winter wedding, summer calls for more subtle and sensible treatment. Though the fabric gets lighter and more breathable, the treatment and colours ensure that the look remains gorgeous, but not garish.

 ?No one wants to discount the look, especially in case of a wedding in the family. The trick is to play around with fabrics, colours and embellishments to achieve the desired effect,? says Shantanu Goenka.

 ?For summer 2005, I?m using a lot of lightweight silks like satin silks apart from georgettes and crepes. Light silks work very well for bridal lehngas as they can hold heavy embroidery. Georgettes and crepes do fine for drapes,? adds the designer who would be making his Lakm? India Fashion Week debut this year.

 Shantanu?s recipe seems fine for evening wear, but the numerous sideshows in any great Indian wedding call for daywear attention, too. Kota (a variety of cotton) is the answer from designer Sucheta Mehr?s stable.

 ?You?d be surprised to see how dressy kota looks when given the right treatment. Jazzed up with a lot of gota (gold trimmings) and also some of the same embellishments I?d normally use on georgettes, a kota sari can be easily carried off for an evening do as well,? stresses Sucheta.

 If you want to feel even lighter than this, there are ensembles available in nets as well. For dainty Cinderellas, who?d otherwise be cowed down under heavy Jamevars and Benarasis, a net lehnga with delicate embellishments is just what the fairy godmother would order.

 The palette this bridal season is cool with a lot of emphasis on aquamarines and lime greens. Even when warm colours like reds and oranges are used, blues and greens provide a stark contrast. While the bridegrooms continue to look cool in ivory and beige sherwanis, there is a smattering of light gold and muted rusts and maroons as well. The brides on the other hand, are blushing brighter with combinations like red and orange or a golden yellow lehnga teamed with red choli.

 The adventurous brigade, willing to experiment on D-day, is also going in for combinations like fuschia and blue. The experimental stuff though is usually designer brainwave, while malls like Shagun (an exclusive wedding mart on Shakespeare Sarani) stick to reds, oranges, yellows and shades within that spectrum.

 The embellishments this season pack in more sparkle than shine. Stones of every colour, shape and size are a rage at stores from Burrabazar to Park Street. If that isn?t your thing, designers are also working with colourful Swarovski crystals for a more tasteful look. Different embroidery techniques also creep in to provide more volume.

 ?I like working with mixed medium. I use aari, zardosi, crystals and sequins all at the same time,? declares Shantanu. ?The look is opulent but less fussy.? Sucheta agrees while using a sprinkling of shimmer but not going ?overboard? with it. The designer, who retails from her boutique Earthy Myths on Loudon Street, hopes to add more freshness to sultry summers by placing special emphasis on floral patterns. ?I?ve used a lot of flora in the embroidery, which get quite bold and rustic at times,? explains Sucheta. 

 A combination of silver embellishments teamed with sparkling diamonds in white gold jewellery is what we?d root for at a cool summer wedding. But really, imagination is the key and personal preferences needn?t lose out to the in-out game. Improvise by infusing the colour of your ensemble into your jewellery studded with colourful precious and semi-precious stones, and the summer bride couldn?t have made a cooler statement!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Valentine statement with sparkles and style

Ipsita Deb, Himika Chaudhuri

Love 

got a stylish edge at Sourav?s on V-Day. Amid bright red hear-shaped balloons 

screaming romantic mush, revellers were treated to a fashion show at the lounge 

in this plush hangout on Monday afternoon. 

 Organised by Images of India, a company dedicated to discovering ?fresh talents in the design arena?, the show displayed works of upcoming designers in the city.

 The extravaganza kicked off with an ethnic line conceived by Shantanu Guhathakurta of Urjashi. A flaming red sari with simple silver butis and a heavy zardosi border contrasted a strikingly simple off-white sari with intricate embroidery on the ramp showcased by city models. Embroidered shawls casually draped over denims in different styles were another highlight from this designer. 

 The second round showed creations by Suchismita of Nextiles. The ?modern-day flower girl? look in her line was highlighted by the contrasting shades of white and earthy tones. While ethnic ensembles dominated the previous round, this one was largely western. Crochet work, sheer fabrics and accessories ruled Suchismita?s designs. 

 Next on the ramp was a formal wear range for office-goers by Runu Sen of Lajwanti. Trousers and skirts were teamed with plain or embroidered white shirts. The most striking feature of this collection was the intricate work on the ties worn with each ensemble.

 In sharp contrast, party essentials designed by Diya Roy were displayed next. Her idea of party basics combined everything from tube tops teamed with saris and western wear to off-shoulder blouses and gypsy skirts.

Andaleeb Hashmi?s leather wear range and Soma Chatterjee?s 

ethnic ensembles concluded the afternoon style session. 

 But the fun was far from over. While couples got cosy on the dance floor to classic love songs in between various sessions with prizes being promised by the resident DJ, the evening promised to be even more enjoyable with rumours of catching dada at the lounge.

 Jadau jam

 While sleek is in for regular dos, an ostentatious Great Indian Wedding calls for something more elaborate. A new collection of kundan jadau and meenakari jewellery was launched at the Indian Gem and Jewellery store at Vardan Market recently to attract wedding shoppers on the lookout for new trends.

 In a bid to give the traditional Rajasthani jewels a trendy twist to attract the young crowd, the collection titled Fusion Fashion has been crafted in 22 karat gold where chunky kundan work has been used with restraint. Instead, gold has been used more generously along with multi-coloured stones like sapphire and tourmaline apart from semi-precious stones like amethyst, jade and garnet with intricate meenakari work.

 Each piece is painstakingly crafted for four to five months to achieve the fusion look that also reflects traces of Mughal era artistry. The use of vibrant colours like bright reds, pinks and yellows, however, makes the pieces look at once contemporary and antique. 

 ?The range is bound to change the mindset regarding jadau jewellery, which is generally associated with a heavy and ornate look and phenomenally high prices,? feels Prasanna Dugar, director, Indian Gem and Jewellery. A vivaha jadau set here starts from Rs 50,000 onwards. 

 If it is any assurance to customers, the store bagged the award for the Best Diamond Jewellery Showroom in Calcutta earlier this month at a glittering ceremony organised by Diamond Trading Company at Taj Bengal. 

 Diamond dig

 Pocket-friendly diamonds made for a sparkling Valentine?s Day and with girlfriends expecting substance to be added to the mush, the trend is here to stay. Ones who realised the gospel truth late can still make up by checking out the new line of diamond neckpieces launched at Trendsmith.

 The posh jewellery store on Loudon Street boasts over 15 jewellery brands to choose from. Part of the Diamond Trading Company, Trendsmith has a wide range starting from a diamond nose stud priced at Rs 1,500 to elaborate pieces worth a few lakh. It?s the new line of diamond neckpieces from the Nirmal Zaveri Group set in both white and yellow gold that is hogging most of the limelight at the moment though. ?The USP of the pieces is that each one is unique. Only a single piece of a particular design is created for people who prefer exclusivity,? says store manager Ranjita Singh.

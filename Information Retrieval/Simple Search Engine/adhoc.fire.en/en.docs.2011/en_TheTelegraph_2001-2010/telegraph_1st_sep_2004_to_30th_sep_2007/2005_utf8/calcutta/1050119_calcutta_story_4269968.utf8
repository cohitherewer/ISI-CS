 It?s official now. The Park Street flyover will not meet the January 26 deadline, as quite a bit of the work is yet to be completed.

 According to transport department officials, though the bridge will technically be ?in place? by Republic Day, more time will be needed for improvement of roads, mastic asphalting of the bridge and painting the flyover under-belly.

 ?We did not want the chief minister to inaugurate an incomplete flyover. So, we have postponed the inaugural function planned for January 26,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Tuesday.

 ?But the steel casting is already complete and with that, our major headache regarding the project is over,? he added.

 The transport secretary had earlier assured the chief minister that the flyover would be ready by January 26.

 According to estimates, the bridge will not be ready for inauguration before the third week of February.

 The transport department is planning to utilise the time to tie up some loose ends. 

 The department, which had overlooked a connector for Lindsay Street with the flyover, now plans to upgrade about 15 m of JL Nehru Road off Lindsay Street and merge it with the road leading to the flyover flank.

 ?Vehicles emerging from Lindsay Street will now have direct access to the flyover to go southwards. It had initially been decided that vehicles emerging from Lindsay Street would have to make a U-turn at the Park Street intersection and go north to take the flyover,? said an official associated with the project.

 The portion of the road parallel to both sides of the flyover will be paved with mastic asphalt to improve the surface.

 ?We will also light up the Outram Road-Mayo Road stretch. Besides, the footpath on either side of JL Nehru Road will be re-laid with interlocking tiles,? said the official. 

 The under-structure of the 610-m-long flyover will be painted grey to spruce it up before its inauguration.

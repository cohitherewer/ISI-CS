 Counselling of parents and students at the school level has become imperative. They are ignorant about the numerous careers coming up for those passing Class XII ? bio-technology, bio-informatics, bio-engineering, robotics, fashion designing, jewellery designing, merchandising, space engineering, travel and tourism, media, language learning, etc. Also they must know that success is not the destination in life and that success and excellence need not go together. Students must cultivate a passion for excellence, not success.

Rector, Garden High School

 How much counselling can one provide in a rigid education system? It is time to accept that all students do not have the same intelligence. We should devise methods by which other openings are created for those who are not capable of handling this syllabus, rather than lowering the standard. Everybody need not reach the university or even the Plus II level. The differentiation should start from Class VIII. Training in nursing or some technical field can start from such a stage. There should be no stigma in this. Once the students branch out, the pressure of getting admission to good colleges or being selected for a particular course would be reduced.

 Counselling is very important in the present scenario. In most cases, the parents are responsible for causing stress. Not only do they transfer their unfulfilled expectations on to the child, but they are also too competitive. Parents are uncomfortable about answering queries of growing children. This makes the kids warped. If a parent is a close friend, the bonding will ensure reduction of stress. No counsellor can do better than a parent.

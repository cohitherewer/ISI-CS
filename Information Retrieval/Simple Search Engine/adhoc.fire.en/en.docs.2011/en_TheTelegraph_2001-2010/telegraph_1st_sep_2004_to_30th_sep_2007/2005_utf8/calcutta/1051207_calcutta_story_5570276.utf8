 ?Bluffmaster! not as frivolous as Bunty Aur Babli?

 In a new look to go with his new film, ROHAN SIPPY tells Pratim D. Gupta about his plans to take the audience on a rollercoaster ride

 Why did it take you so long to make your second film?

 Well, I was finding a title for my film (laughs). Last time I asked you not to speak ? Kuch Na Kaho. This time I am the Bluffmaster!, so that I can get away with anything. Seriously speaking, after finishing my first film, I got together with Shridhar Raghavan in 2003 and we started writing this film. We could finish it only in October last year. Then we set about casting and it took some time to plan and meet up with everyone. We started rolling on June 16 and we are releasing the movie on December 16.

 After such a romantic start to your career, why did you go for a con movie?

 By the time I finished with Kuch Na Kaho, I was saturated with the romance genre. I wanted a new set of challenges. Now, a con film is one genre I have always liked as a viewer. Also I wanted to explore the relationship between two con buddies, the bond Abhishek and Riteish share in the film. Then again, the heart of Bluffmaster! is the love between Abhishek and Priyanka, although it doesn?t have that much of screen time.

 Abhishek has already appeared in a hit con film like Bunty Aur Babli just months back. Will that hamper Bluffmaster!?s chances at the box-office?

 Not really because the two films have very different flavours. Bunty Aur Babli is more in spirit with Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma and Louise. It has a lovely flamboyance and the freshness comes from the youth. My film is not as frivolous. For example, Abhishek plays a much older character in Bluffmaster!. Then the film is set in Mumbai. So most of the characters are very street smart.

 Apart from Abhishek, Riteish and Priyanka, you have got a lovely ensemble cast including the likes of Nana Patekar and Boman Irani?

 Yes, I have got the best actors possible for each part. You can?t imagine anyone else in those roles. Nana, of course, there is no one in his league. I got lucky since he was working in another of our home productions, Taxi No. 9211. So despite not having a full-fledged role in Bluffmaster!, he agreed to do it and what he has brought to the film is amazing. Boman, also, does not have a role that runs through the film. But he too has some unforgettable scenes. They never asked the number of scenes they have in the movie, just wanted to be part of the great cast.

 Will you call Bluffmaster! a comedy?

 Not at all. It is a strange blend of genres. It?s got the emotions in the heart. It?s enclosed in the structure of a suspense film. The film?s laced with a wit that carries it through. Bluffmaster! is one kind of a rollercoaster ride which will keep you engaged from one scene to the next.

 Can you ever make a film without your childhood friend Abhishek?

 I can?t imagine not asking Abhishek to be a part of my film. But we have to understand that he is in a wonderful position today when everyone from Karan Johar to Mani Ratnam is wanting to work with him. He is on everybody?s wishlist. And there are only 365 days a year and he?s going to be very busy. I am very happy that he now has so much choice. So from now on, it will come down to his availability and whether I have a script to go to him.

 How did you make him sing?

 We both love music and we listen a lot together. Now, we have this soundtrack where all the songs are sourced. So we thought let?s actually compose one song. We spoke to Vishal and Shekhar to develop something in the R amp;B space, which both Abhishek and I like. They came back with a germ of something very nice and although Abhishek wanted Vishal to sing it, I wanted Abhishek to try it at the studio. He?s got a great musical sense, he?s got a great voice and I couldn?t imagine him not being able to pull it off. What he?s brought to the song is his attitude and that freshness works. It was never planned as a great marketing tool, it all happened organically.

But why did you go for a pre-sourced soundtrack, something only found in foreign films?

 I wanted to break the norm of recording six songs for a film. Also, I wanted to give a feel to the audience that this is not your usual Hindi film. We have picturised four of the songs. We have used as much great music as we can, as and when the situation demanded, sometimes even replacing background music. In real life, for moments of our life, we recall old songs, not create new ones. And we have such a huge wealth of great music material. I expect a lot more people following suit.

 Are you unhappy you had to call off the premiere on December 15?

 The plans around the premiere hadn?t really taken shape. We just want Mr Amitabh Bachchan to get well. We are too far into the campaign to change the December 16 release date. So we are going ahead with the release but have called off the premiere.

 Finally, what?s the secret behind your moustache?

 Well, just having some fun, with the spirit of the movie, of course. Just to make you feel that you are part of a film like Bluffmaster!.

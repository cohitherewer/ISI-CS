 Fraud cloud over teacher

 - HOSTEL HEAD QUITS

 FUNDS FUNDA: Students in a huddle at Jadavpur University. A Telegraph picture

 Jadavpur University, a UGC-certified ?centre of excellence?, has been rocked by charges of misappropriation of funds brought against a teacher, who had been the acting superintendent of the two women?s hostels.

 Swapna Debnath, a professor in the mathematics department, has resigned as superintendent. She is allegedly due to account for more than Rs 1.2 lakh.

 Registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay refused comment.

 The controversy erupted on February 4, when around 350 boarders of the hostels met the finance officer to inquire about the funds sanctioned for the purchase of newspapers, magazines and fixtures for the hostels. Debnath had allegedly told the students that the funds had been stopped.

 According to Abhranil Saha, general secretary of the students? union of the engineering faculty, the girls were told that there had been no change in the allocation of the funds. ?Which means, the superintendent had siphoned off the money.? 

 Tempers flared further when the girls came across certain ?irregularities? in the draft budget for 2005-06, in which the number of boarders in the two hostels had been allegedly recorded less than the actual figure.

 The students said the dean and the registrar had not responded to their plea to visit the hostel and ?sort out the matter?.

 The boarders, backed by other students of the university, launched an agitation on February 5, demanding action against Debnath. They also presented a set of seven demands, covering all nine hostels of the university. 

 Debnath, on her part, has alleged that the boarders had harassed her. Sources said the university? executive council had appointed two committees, to investigate the charge of ?unlawful assembly and harassment? against the students and that of misappropriation of funds against Debnath.

 Among the students who met Debnath on February 5, only seven have been summoned by the panel probing the teacher?s allegation. The students fear that the seven are being singled out for reprisal.

 Last year, a one-man panel had been appointed to probe charges of ?inefficiency and negligence? brought against Debnath by a section of students. The panel had, however, given a clean chit to her.

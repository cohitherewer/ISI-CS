 Land talks with army

 OUR BUREAU

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government will discuss several land-related issues with the army at a meeting at Fort William on Friday.

 Officers at Writers? Buildings said on Wednesday that some land in Calcutta had been handed over by the army to the state government for development projects. The government had agreed to give land to the army in lieu of this. ?But problems have cropped up, as the army is asking for more land from us in other parts of the state, particularly north Bengal,? said an officer attached to the home department. 

 He said an across-the-table meeting is imperative to iron out the army-state differences on land-related issues.

 Major-General Z.U. Shah, GOC (Bengal area) said on Wednesday: ?The government had taken land in Calcutta for various development projects like flyovers. The army had willingly handed it over to the state. The state government had promised to give the army land of equal value against this.?

 Already, the army has identified land in north Bengal. ?We will discuss the matter with government officers at the meeting,? Shah said.

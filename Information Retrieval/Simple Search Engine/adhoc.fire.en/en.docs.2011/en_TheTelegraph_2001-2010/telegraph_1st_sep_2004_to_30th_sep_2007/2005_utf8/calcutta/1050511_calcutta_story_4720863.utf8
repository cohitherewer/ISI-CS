The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In defiance of library chief

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A team of senior officers from National Library, including its director, Sudhendu Mandal, visited Tripura last month and held a meeting with chief minister Manik Sarkar. The high-powered team had promised Sarkar of all cooperation in spreading the library movement in the state.

 But Mandal?s efforts may be stymied in Calcutta. One of his subordinates has turned down a plea by the Left Front government to train two staff members of the West Bengal Secretariat Library at Writers? Buildings ? clearly in contradiction of Mandal?s initiative to spread the library movement in Tripura. 

 This has taken many aback in both the institutions.

 Though the secretariat library is not open to the public, its importance cannot be questioned as ministers, bureaucrats and government officers often use it for their administrative jobs. 

 The librarian of the secretariat library, K.M. Banerjee, had requested Mandal on April 1 to organise the training of two of his staff members on binding and mending of books and records at National Library. 

 However, the library and information officer of National Library, H.P. Gedam, told Banerjee on April 8, that it would not be possible for the library to concede the request. Gedam?s refusal surprised many as National Library had earlier trained the staff members of the secretariat library.

 Banerjee, however, denied comment. 

 Earlier, National Library had trained a staff member of the secretariat library, Samir Kumar Basu, for three months ? from January 2 to March 31, 1981. The then librarian of the secretariat library, S.C. Sen, had requested National Library to train Basu on binding and mending books and periodicals. 

 During his training, Basu had worked in the preservation division, laboratory division and reprography wing.

 Recently, some library officers from Kalyani University were trained by National Library following a request from the university authorities. 

 Mandal said on Tuesday that he would take up the issue himself.

 ?No one consulted me before rejecting the request of the secretariat library to train two of their staff members,? he said. 

 It is learnt that Gedam did not consult the departments at National Library which impart such training before turning down the request of the secretariat library.

 Gedam, however, refused to speak on the issue.

 Books ranging from Tintin to Tagore, music of any kind and short vacations twice a month ? a few of designer Sabyasachi Mukherjees favourite things when it comes to de-stressing. 

 The style guru shared a few of his fitness fundas at a promotion of the Global De-stress Programme at Golds Gym on Wednesday evening.

 A brand ambassador for the city chapter of the international gym chain, Sabyasachi admits that he has become a fitness freak of late. Working out is helping me de-stress in a big way. Very few people know that in my growing up years I used to be an athlete with the Hooghly District Sports Association. But due to an accident in which I got severely burnt, I had to give it all up. So, for many years after that I had to keep myself out of sports of any kind and involved myself totally in building my career, said Sabyasachi.

 It was only after his stint with Golds Gym that the star designer rediscovered his zeal for fitness. I have tried the Special Golds Global De-stress Programme and I simply love it. With the kind of high-pressure lives that most of us lead today, it is important to be able to relax our muscles, so that the next morning one doesnt wake up tired and bleary-eyed from bed. This programme is helping me do just that and I am on my way to healthy living, he smiled.

 The programme claims to deal with the increasing problems related to a sedentary lifestyle and high-stress scenario at the workplace. Stretches, yoga and meditation form an intrinsic part of the programme, with primary focus on stretches that help in exercising every part of the body. For instance, the Cobra Stretch helps exercise the entire back, right up to the spinal cord.

 The maximum focus is on stretches because it helps you to stay in shape as well as relax your muscles. The whole idea is to feel refreshed and energetic at the end of the session so that you are all charged up to go back to work again, said Divya Himatsingka, director of Golds Gym, Calcutta.

 As for Sabyasachi, the regimen really seems to be working. It is simply amazing how an hour of stretches can keep you kicking all day long. We are often unaware that our body continues to produce toxins throughout the day as a result of which we get cramps at the end of a working day. But I have got over all these problems after joining this course. Nowadays, I feel refreshed and enthusiastic all the time.

 One can join the de-stress programme by signing up for a membership at the gym, which comes for Rs 20,000 (annual gold) and Rs 14,000 (annual silver).

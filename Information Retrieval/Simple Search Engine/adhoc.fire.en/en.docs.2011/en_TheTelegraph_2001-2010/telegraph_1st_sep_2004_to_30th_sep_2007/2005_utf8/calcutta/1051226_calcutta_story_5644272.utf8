 The civic authorities declared on Sunday that talks were underway with various companies regarding preservation of over 1,300 heritage structures and several old edifices in and around the city.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and senior civic officials also revealed that ITC had offered to paint Calcutta University?s Senate Hall and Darbhanga Building on the 150th year of the university.

 The work will be overseen by ITC?s experts and completed before President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s visit on January 14 to inaugurate the sesquicentennial celebrations.

 Other corporate firms have also approached the civic authorities with offers to do up the city in mutually-acceptable ways.

 ?We have also begun talks on getting the buildings in the sprawling Medical College and Hospital premises painted,? stated the mayor.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the civic authorities would shortly meet corporate firms to discuss ways to showcase Calcutta. ?Showcasing the city is not the sole responsibility of the civic body. Others will also have to join hands,? Bhattacharya observed.

 According to the mayor, the overall appearance of the city has suffered due to lack of regular painting of the heritage structures. Ill-maintained buildings have also dented the city?s image, he added.

 About 300,000 buildings, which is 70 per cent of the total number of buildings in Calcutta, are not properly looked after, said officials of the civic body?s building department. In addition, there are over 5,000 condemned buildings in the city.

 ?We are considering a reciprocal benefit package to generate interest among the industry and commerce sectors to take up the responsibility for applying a new coat of paint to heritage structures in the city,? disclosed Bandyopadhyay.

 Tax rebates, exemption in building rules and permission to reconstruct offices are some of the sops being contemplated.

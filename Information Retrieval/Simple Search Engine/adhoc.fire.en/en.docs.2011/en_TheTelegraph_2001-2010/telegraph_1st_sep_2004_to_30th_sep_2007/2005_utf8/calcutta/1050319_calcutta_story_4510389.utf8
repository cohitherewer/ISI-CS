The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State of the union

 In Spouse, not only do the readers learn ?the truth about marriage?, they also discover the truth about Shobhaa De. The books she writes may be racy and often raunchy, but don?t confuse her characters with the woman behind them.

?In fiction, I don?t believe in taboos,? she smiles, 

in town on Friday for a talk about her latest book Spouse: The Truth About 

Marriage. The Penguin book ? which has sold a record-breaking 22,000 copies 

in one month ? espouses a rather conservative (though by no means regressive) 

view of matrimony.

 Shobhaa did not hesitate to burst the voyeuristic bubble by baring all about what can only be described as a conservative, healthy married life. ?I am glad that I have cleared the confusion between real life and fiction. In real life, I have never been anything else but consistent,? stresses Shobhaa, happily married to Dilip for over two decades now.

 The author?s conviction is clear: the ups of marriage make the inevitable downs more than worth it. ?While this book isn?t a marriage manual in the usual sense of the word, what it definitely is, is a strong endorsement for being married and staying married,? she writes in the introduction to her 14th book.

 Not that the woman with one failed marriage behind her hasn?t made her share of mistakes. ?But even during that period, I didn?t question my desire to be married,? she points out.

 To take what you can from every situation is the key. ?We were all young once,? she shrugs, addressing the Ladies Study Group at The Park banquet hall. ?Did we date the wrong people? I have. Learned from that? Sure!?

 When she realised that her first marriage was not the kind of union she wanted for herself, she moved on in search of ?the one?, the ideal life partner. ?When you meet the one, bells do ring inside your head,? smiles Shobhaa, a mother of six children.

 The woman behind Sultry Days and Socialite Evenings has a pragmatic view of the institution. ?Talk is my favourite four-letter word, though the obvious one is fairly important too.? Only communication can ensure that a marriage survives.

 But what of the spiralling divorce rates? Collapsing marriages brought on, in some ways, the ?panic attack? that prompted Shobhaa to pen the book. Women?s economic empowerment has been the most significant force behind this. ?If Brand Marriage has lost its equity, it is only because women are driving the change.? Marriage cannot survive in its old avatar, and this requires men to shift gear. ?Wake up and smell the coffee, rasam, kasundi, whatever it is? is her advice to men. 

 And for women, this is only good news. ?Finally we have come to a point... where we can marry who we want, when we want, for the right reasons.?

 There are also dangers to this revolution. Sexual experimentation within marriage, feels Shobhaa, comes with its own dangers. We need someone to call our own, as even the most liberal thinkers have discovered, she believes.

 The essence of a successful marriage is still commitment ? the ?dreaded C-word? ? and that is in short supply. ?You have to believe in marriage to give it a chance.? As people begin to ?desperately look for answers?, they are turning to the media (and books like Spouse, happily for her). ?Is reality Sex and the City or one of the saas-bahu serials? It?s actually neither. We need our own reference points.?

Women who love to dress up and take that long leisurely 

bath before they choose what to wear have it rough nowadays. More often than not, 

the night out is preceded by a strenuous day at work, leaving you no time to dabble 

with an infinite choice of clothes, colours and types of make up. 

But if you are sick of showing up at a fancy do underdressed, 

and don?t have space in office to change or stow away extra baggage, here is a 

power solution just for you.

Designer Priyanjali Ray tells you just how to go through 

the day with all your ammunition ready so you can be comfortable and yet create 

a splash when the occasion arises.

Work wear

When you?ve got a date planned for the evening, it 

makes sense to wake up a little early and take stock of what to wear. But if you 

have a formal work space and carrying your outfit in a duffel bag isn?t your style, 

what do you do?

?The best plan in such a situation is to take stock 

of what lies ahead and wear something accordingly. Wearing one particular outfit 

and changing it around is the simplest thing to do,? says Priyanjali.

Check out model Priyanka here, seen sporting a bright 

pink and orange spaghetti top with a black tulip-shaped chiffon skirt, that skims 

the hips and flares out at the calves.

While the top has a low back and cowl neck, it is 

well hidden as the model has donned a tailored black jacket with the straps of 

the top tied high to give it the appearance of a straight top. Her hair is kept 

neatly tied back and she has used neutral make up.

Dinner date

Dinners can be formal or casual, but if you?re planning 

to go straight for work and make any kind of impact, the first thing you should 

do is throw off that jacket. Keeping summer in mind, despite the heavy blast of 

the air-conditioner, a jacket is not the most feminine of garments.

However, to avoid revealing too much, a stole or dupatta 

is a great option. Priyanka is seen sporting a multi-coloured knit stole. 

?This provides a perfect contrast to the otherwise rather plain ensemble,? says 

Priyanjali. 

The straps that had been tightened for work purposes 

have been loosened out to show off the cowl neck, adding the chic factor in the 

process. Dangling pink earrings add to the effect. Keeping your hair open and 

touching up on the make up is a must.

Party pretty

Two down, one to go. You can finally let your hair 

completely down and get set for a night of fun and revelry. It?s finally time 

to show off that designer top with its multi-faceted effects. With the straps 

already loosened and the v-shaped cowl neck on display, it?s time to show some 

skin at the back. The crossover low back adds more colour with bits of orange 

thrown in. No extras like a jacket or stole are needed now. It?s time to be adventurous. 

Slipping on a pair of long, colourful earrings is 

a good option. Here, Priyanka sports some exquisite orange and pink danglers made 

of semi-precious stones. 

On the make-up front, get those eyes shining by darkening 

the eye shadow and using a dash of glitter powder. You?re now ready to rock!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shelter in music, for the less fortunate

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

Fame Gurukul may have struck the wrong chord even before the first notes were sung, but another Gurukul in the Domjur area of Howrah is strumming away to glory. Santoor exponent Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya?s school for ?financially handicapped? students is supporting a lot of raw talent from in and around the city.

 ?The idea is to help them settle in life through the art of music,? says Bhattacharya. ?Some of the students from my Gurukul santoor ashram have already made a name for themselves in places like Mumbai and Los Angeles. It?s good to see them perform and tour around the world.?

 At Bhattacharya?s ashram, students, who cannot afford to learn music otherwise, are not only given music lessons but also provided with food and shelter. ?I use a small percentage of the money I earn from the foreign tours and album sales for my school. It?s a beautiful setting there, where I can teach my shishyas under mango trees, just like in Santiniketan. When I am on foreign tours, senior students of the ashram take over and keep the classes going.?

 Apart from backing the needy hands, Bhattacharya is doing his bit for the tsunami victims. After touring all around the country for them, he also performed in Dusseldorf, Germany, for a special fundraising concert. 

 ?I have also released an album for the tsunami victims a month back from a Mumbai music label,? says Bhattacharya. ?It?s called Rich Heritage. I have played ragas in a style different from their place of origin. Ram Kumar Mishra from Varanasi has accompanied me on the tabla.?

 Next, Bhattacharya leaves for Singapore for a concert with Ustad Sabir Khan to be followed by the big Bengali cultural bash in New York in July in the form of Bishwa Banga Sammelan.

 In Calcutta for a breather, Bhattacharya doesn?t believe in wasting time. ?I have just finished recording for another album, which is yet to be titled,? he reveals, speaking from the studio. 

 ?It?s the first time I?m working with Bikram Ghosh. He has introduced many sounds to my santoor music. The ragas sound completely different when ghatam tones and bells are used with it. It should make for some interesting listening once it releases,? he smiles.

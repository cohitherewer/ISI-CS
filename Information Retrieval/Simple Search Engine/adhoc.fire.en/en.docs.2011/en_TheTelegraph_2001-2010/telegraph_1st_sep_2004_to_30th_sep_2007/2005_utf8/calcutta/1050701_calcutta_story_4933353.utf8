 Digital dimension

 M arking a silent revolution in the sphere of the visual arts, Rang Dayaar, the ongoing exhibition of digital paintings by three artists, conveys their common passion and futuristic vision of capturing the virtual world. Showcasing their recent works, this compilation is a sublime journey from the exotic world of colours, textures and graphic forms to the realm of the transcendental. Bearing a marked influence of surrealism, the paintings of Surya Chetan explore concepts like birth and death, religion and salvation. With a flair for working out the mystical from existing quotients of power in every image, his themes are allegorical, sensual, personal and even self-intrusive, often portraying the reflections of a sub-conscious mind. Dr Bibek Paul combines painting and photo-editing softwares with traditional styles of watercolour and pastels to create realistic images of spellbinding landscapes and scenic locales. Vivid images of rural Bengal, Bihar and the Himalayas add a lyrical resonance to his depiction of nature in its many moods. Ritu Barna Maniyar shows her interest in mythology and literature in her artistic expositions. Her keen understanding of life shows people, caught in the web of love and lust, as symbols of energy and paradigms of change.

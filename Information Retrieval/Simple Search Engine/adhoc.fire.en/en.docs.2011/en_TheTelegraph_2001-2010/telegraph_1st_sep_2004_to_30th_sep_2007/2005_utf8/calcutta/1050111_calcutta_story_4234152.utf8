The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I will definitely not do a film like Murder?

 He?s up there (Bollywood) with the best,? says actress Aishwarya Rai. ?He?s one guy after Santosh Sivan who is strikingly different,? says cinematographer Ravi Chandran. Amidst the flurry of accolades, AVEEK MUKHERJEE has joined the Bollywood big league after working with Rituparno Ghosh, Mrinal Sen and Aparna Sen. The Calcutta-based cinematographer tells Reshmi Sengupta about his first brush with mainstream fare in Shaad Ali?s Bunty Aur Babli?

 How did Bunty Aur Babli come your 

way?

 Yashraj Films and Shaad got in touch with me with the script. Shaad had liked my work in Chokher Bali and Patalghar. Initially, I was sceptical, as I knew I wouldn?t do a film if I didn?t like the script. But I liked the script by Joydeep Sahni, who had also penned the script for Ram Gopal Varma?s Company. Then, Abhishek (Bachchan) also insisted that I do the film while we were working for Antarmahal.

 Bunty Aur Babli is about a girl and a boy hailing from a small town and wanting to make it big in life. So they start conning people. But something that starts off very innocently takes a different turn when a cop (played by Amitabh Bachchan) picks up their trail. Amitji has a major role. He comes out of his policeman persona to reveal the person that he is. In fact, his narration, in the form of a voiceover, binds the entire story. There are quite a few cameos in the film, too ? you will get to see actors like Ranjeet and Prem Chopra.

 After working for Rituparno Ghosh, how 

are you fitting into the mainstream mould of Bunty Aur Babli?

 I am not treating Bunty Aur Babli as a so-called Bollywood film at all. I am being myself and just going by my instinct. It?s true that I have never done a film like this before. But that hasn?t been a problem as I have worked for numerous commercials in Mumbai for a long time. Bunty Aur Babli is a commercial film but of a different flavour. It?s comedy, but again on a different note. It?s colourful, with eight songs.

 The film seems to be pretty fast-paced. 

What kind of a look have you settled for?

 The look keeps changing continuously as Rani (Mukherjee) and Abhishek don different disguises. It begins with a sweet small-town feel with lots of nice light but slowly becomes crisper and heads towards a major twist in the end. The kind of uniformity in Raincoat is not possible here. Shaad has given me a lot of liberty in setting the look of the film, camera positioning and even the costumes; he counts on me while making decisions.

 How was it working with Shaad Ali?

 We spent a lot of time in adda and that helps a lot. You need a friendly relationship in order to understand the mind and tastes of the director. It?s also essential because there are a lot of references to films of various genres in Bunty Aur Babli. I can relate to Shaad?s vision. In fact, we share similar tastes, my cultural background, or the films I have grown up watching being similar to Shaad, who has worked with his film-maker father Muzaffar Ali Khan.

 The Bunty Aur Babli crew has zig-zagged 

through a large part of north India. How has it been till now?

 We faced some major trouble in Kanpur where we had an elaborate shooting on location. The film is being made in sync-sound and it was very difficult when a huge crowd turned up at the Kanpur station while we were shooting a train sequence. Then, in Varanasi, the local Shiv Sena raised a ruckus when we were shooting inside an akhara with Rani. They wouldn?t let women in. But the Uttar Pradesh government helped us out. We also shot on the Ramnagar Ghat in Varanasi, the same place where Chokher Bali was shot. We have also been to Hrishikesh and Agra. Right now, shooting is on in Mumbai. One song needs to be done in Ladakh. More than half the work is complete. The film will release in May-June.

 What kind of a response have you got from 

Raincoat in Mumbai?

 Raincoat is not Veer-Zaara. So you can?t expect it to rock the box-office. But a section of the audience is veering towards serious cinema. Those who have seen the film in Mumbai have liked it very much. They have appreciated my work, too. I am looking forward to Antarmahal. It is something Ritu (Rituparno Ghosh) has never done before. It goes beyond relationships to the social status quo.

 Where will we see more of you now, Bollywood 

or Tollywood?

 I might do Ritu?s next film but nothing has been decided yet. And the Hindi films are too sketchy at the moment to talk about. Mainstream films give you quick exposure at the national level, but it?s very important to choose the right kind of commercial films. I will definitely not do a film like Murder. And I would prefer to work in Calcutta.

 Traffic cop duo axed for graft

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The traffic police ?tradition? of fleecing motorists by hurling the law book at them has boomeranged on two rogue sergeants.

 Both were suspended after departmental probes found them guilty of graft. 

 ?Two sergeants were found guilty of taking bribes. Prompt action was initiated against them,? declared Arun Kumar Sharma, former deputy commissioner of police (traffic), who is now special superintendent of the Intelligence Branch.

 According to traffic department sources, there were specific complaints against sergeants Gautam Chatterjee and Sandip Sarkar. ?It seems that it wasn?t the first time they took bribes from motorists in the name of taking lawful action. Our inquiry found them to be habitual offenders,? said a senior officer of the department.

 Sarkar, while on duty at Tollygunge traffic guard, had stopped a Maruti car on Deshapran Sashmal Road.

 ?He asked the owner to park the car as one of the tail-lights was not working. Since the offence is not treated as a major violation of traffic rules, the motorist requested to be let off,? said another traffic department officer.

 But Sergeant Sarkar was not ready to allow the motorist to go without lining his pocket.

 He demanded Rs 200. The motorist protested. He said he was ready to face penal action, but would not pay a single paisa as bribe.

 The heated conversation drew curious onlookers. Policemen from Tollygunge, who were patrolling the area, also stopped by to determine the cause of the dispute.

 ?On realising that the image of the force was taking a beating in public, we advised the motorist to repair the defective tail-light of his car and allowed him to leave,? said an officer of the Tollygunge police station.

 The motorist later lodged a complaint with the deputy commissioner (traffic).

 Sergeant Chatterjee, on the other hand, was photographed by a television channel while taking a bribe from the driver of bus, which had not violated any traffic rule. He was posted at Shyambazar traffic guard at the time.

 The bus was plying on a new route, the permit for which had been issued by the public vehicles department. 

 Even after being shown the documents, Chatterjee was not ready to let the bus go. He dragged out the driver and asked for money repeatedly.

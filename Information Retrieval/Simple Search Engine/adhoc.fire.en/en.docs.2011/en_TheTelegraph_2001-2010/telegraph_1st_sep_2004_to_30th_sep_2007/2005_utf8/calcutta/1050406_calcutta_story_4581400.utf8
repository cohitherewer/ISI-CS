The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Low on hype, high on heart

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Has Poila Baisakh lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis? More responses will be published next week

Rajarshi Ghosh,

 Surya Nagar

No, I don?t think that Poila Baisakh has lost out 

to New Year?s Day among Bengalis. People still celebrate Poila Baisakh, but the 

nature of the celebrations has changed. Bengalis now go out to eat on the day, 

but not necessarily traditional food and not necessarily wearing traditional dresses. 

Dipro Ray, 

 Beniapukur Lane

Most Bengalis have no respect for tradition and would 

rather ape the West. The majority of the Bengali youth are not aware which Bengali 

year is going to start in a few days. They brave the winter chill to throng the 

city discos and nightclubs on the night of December 31, but would rather stay 

indoors to avoid the sun on Poila Baisakh. No wonder that the day is losing its 

significance in Calcutta.

Subhankar Mukherjee, 

 Burdwan

No. Poila Baisakh celebrations are distinctly different 

from New Year festivities. Traders, both Bengali and non-Bengali, still celebrate 

with utmost sincerity the halkhata ceremony that marks the advent of the 

Bengali new year.

Payel Bhattacharyya, 

 Joka

Most urban Bengalis like to think of themselves as 

either Indians or world citizens. That is why occasions bearing significance only 

for members of a single community are losing out to more broad-based events. 

Jayanta Datta, 

 Chinsurah

Poila Baisakh has lost its relevance due to several 

reasons. The primary one is that today, all celebrations must be associated with 

alcohol, night clubs and loud music. Poila Baisakh has failed to find such links 

and hence does not find favour with the youth, who would rather go to a disco 

than a temple.

 Diamond Harbour Road 

 The Gregorian calendar is followed in almost every sphere of life. Hence, it is natural that January 1 would be more popular than Poila Baisakh. However, it is unlikely that the day will ever lose all its significance, at least among Bengalis.

Pijush Banerjee, 

 Sarsuna

Poila Baisakh has lost its significance in the urban 

areas. The corporate world, for its own ends, has created such hype around the 

New Year, that it has totally outdone Poila Baisakh in the cities. The urban Bengali 

now celebrates Poila Baisakh only to show that he is liberal enough not to turn 

his nose up at the Bengali new year. In the villages, however, the year-end is 

celebrated with gaajan and chaitra sankranti.

Tanima Dey,

 Address not given

Even now, traders decorate their shops in the run-up 

to Poila Baisakh. And to most Bengalis, the day remains special. Which does not 

mean that they do not celebrate the New Year. They do, but that does not take 

the joy away from the Poila Baisakh festivities, and it never will.

Sulagna Sengupta,

 Convent Road

With increasing globalisation and commercialisation, 

we are losing touch with our roots. The loss of significance of Poila Baisakh 

is just one of the manifestations of the phenomenon. The excitement of wearing 

new clothes, eating sweets and going to the temple on Poila Baisakh is losing 

out to parties and disc-hopping on the New Year?s eve. Poila Baisakh has become 

a mere holiday for students. 

Sushma Jalan,

 Alipore

The fact that Poila Baisakh has not taken a backseat 

among Bengalis is evident from the enthusiasm with which it is celebrated every 

year. The young Bengali has a cosmopolitan credo and is drawn to a fast life. 

Poila Baisakh figures nowhere in his scheme of things. But for older Bengalis, 

Pujas and Poila Baisakh will never cease to matter. 

Benil Biswas,

 Belur 

Poila Baisakh is no longer what it used to be. Bengalis 

like to celebrate almost any occasion and so the day is still observed with pomp. 

Having said that, the spirit of Poila Baisakh will never totally fade.

A. Bhattacharya,

 Narendrapur

The Bengalis are too grounded to do away with their 

tradition altogether. No matter how westernised we become, Poila Baisakh will 

always be celebrated with gaiety. 

Debasree Mukherjee, 

 Salt Lake

 The world of Bengalis might have become cosmopolitan, but Poila Baisakh has not lost out to New Year?s Day in the process. They still wear new clothes, go to temples to offer puja and visit relatives on the day.

Indranil Sengupta,

 Salt Lake

 Poila Baisakh is not celebrated with as much fervour as the New Year. This is very disappointing. Poila Baisakh should logically be the biggest festival of the Bengalis after the Puja, but it hardly matches the grandeur of the autumnal event. In the other Indian states, regional new years are celebrated with a great deal of fanfare.

Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane

January 1 is celebrated all over the world. It is 

natural that Bengalis, too, will celebrate it with fanfare. But Poila Baisakh 

holds a unique appeal for residents of the state. And it is celebrated with much 

more emotional verve than New Year?s Day. Nothing will take the place of Poila 

Baisakh in the Bengali heart. 

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur

It cannot be denied that due to globalisation and 

technological advancement, the world has become a smaller place. The fall-out 

of this is that regional festivals like Poila Baisakh are losing significance. 

The majority of us do not follow the Bengali calendar in our everyday life. However, 

the media has had a role in making Poila Baisakh more popular in recent times.

Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street

The Bengali calendar is only used around the Poila 

Baisakh time. The celebrations on the day are generally sedate and do not attract 

the youth. There is no way Poila Baisakh can compete with the New Year, whether 

we like it or not.

Sunanda Sanyal,

 Babubagan

No, Poila Baisakh has not lost its charm among Bengalis. 

The traditional Bengali families still celebrate the day elaborately. The day 

is also very special for traders. In contrast, only the young people celebrate 

the New Year.

Priya Banerjee,

 Barasat

New Year?s Day can never replace Poila Baisakh for 

the festival-loving Bengalis. Bengali babus still prefer invitations to 

a relative?s house over parties at night clubs. The crowd that throngs the streets 

on Poila Baisakh bear testimony to the fact that the day will never play second 

fiddle to New Year.

Aritra Chatterjee,

 Salt Lake

Bengalis still buy new clothes, exchange gifts and 

greet each other on Poila Baisakh. This clearly proves that Poila Baisakh has 

not lost its popularity among Bengalis.

Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake

Poila Baisakh used to be the most important event 

in the spring calender. There?s no denying that its charms have dwindled in the 

eyes of the urban youth, who prefer to go to New Year parties. The backing that 

New Year celebrations receive from multinationals has only heightened the difference 

in status of the two new year days.

Mahelaka Begum,

 Christopher Road

Poila Baisakh is still one of the most awaited days 

for people in every corner of Bengal. New Year?s Day fails to create a similar 

ambience. Poila Baisakh will always maintain its unique identity.

Nirmalya Biswas,

 Hridaypur Station Road

Though our lives are governed by the Gregorian calendar, 

we do not abstain from celebrating Poila Baisakh. The Bengali new year festivities 

are not as boisterous as the New Year celebrations, but that does not mean Poila 

Baisakh is losing its significance. Bengalis are never tired of festivals and 

hence, Poila Baisakh will never stop being celebrated.

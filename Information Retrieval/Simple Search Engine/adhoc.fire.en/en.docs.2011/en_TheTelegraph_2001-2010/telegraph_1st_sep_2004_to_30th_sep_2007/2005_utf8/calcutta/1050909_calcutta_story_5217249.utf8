The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Screen On amp; Off

 With The Great Indian Laughter Challenge coming to an end this Friday, having successfully crowned the Hassi Ka Badshah, it?s time for more laughs in the same slot on the same channel. From next Friday, STAR One will present The Laughter Champions, which will feature stand-up acts from the winners of the Laughter Challenge.

 ?More than monetary prizes, exposure through a separate show like this is far more worthwhile for all these funny men, most of whom have come from small towns,? Ravi Menon, head of programming of STAR One, had told Metro at the launch of the Laughter Challenge. 

 And so, The Laughter Champions will not only feature the six finalists of the TRP-topping comedy show but also give an opportunity to other talented contestants who came close to being crowned the Laughter King. And among those fortunate ones is our very own Mir Ali who will get another opportunity to make people laugh on the small screen.

 What?s more, Laughter Champions will have comedy acts by Shekhar Suman and Navjyot Sidhu, who were the judges for the Challenge. So continue to laugh every Friday, at 10 pm on STAR One.

 Arijit and Shamit: Friend or foe

 It?s being touted as the mother of all twists and it does make for great television. The latest development on the most-voted reality show on the small screen, Sony?s Fame Gurukul, has come as an absolute shocker for the faculty, jury and contestants. 

 Between Qazi, Monica and Shamit, one had to be voted out as part of the game?s rules. The viewers once again proved their loyalty to Qazi by saving him. With a tie between Monica and Shamit, the week?s top singer Arijit voted for and saved Monica, blindly turning his back on his so-called friend and all-time confidant Shamit. 

 While the Gurukul faculty frowned at Arijit?s betrayal, the jury demanded respect for the decision. Shamit was absolutely devastated and as the other contestants broke down too, Arijit himself started weeping profusely and eventually developed chest pains. 

 With Shamit out of the contest, watch out for the Fame race as Neha Julie Dhupia comes as celebrity judge for this Friday?s episode, 8 pm on Sony.

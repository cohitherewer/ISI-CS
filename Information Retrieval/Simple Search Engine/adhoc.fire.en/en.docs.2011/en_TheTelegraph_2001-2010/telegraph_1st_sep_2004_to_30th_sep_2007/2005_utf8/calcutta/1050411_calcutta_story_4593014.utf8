ZEESHAN JAWED

 Yana Gupta heralds Bollywood fun at Fusion on 

Saturday. Picture by Rashbehari Das

Two item babes, one hunk and a movie premiere ? that?s the weekend entertainment roster at Fusion for the next month. 

 Kicking off the Bollywood fare at the resto bar and lounge at The Golden Park was item girl Yana Gupta on Saturday night. Word of her appearance at Fusion had spread like wild fire and Yana fans started trickling in as early as 9 pm. But the Babuji girl acted her starry self, making a brief appearance well past midnight. The result was sheer mayhem with party people jostling to catch a glimpse of the lissome lass, cell phone cameras working overtime and the bar registering record sales. 

 ?The party scene had become monotonous of late, in spite of more and more people hitting night spots in the last few years. Same faces, predictable music and lack of glamour quotient has been forcing many regulars to stay indoors on a Friday or Saturday night. Thus we thought of this variety show to pep things up,? said B.S. Gujral, managing director of The Golden Park. 

 Next on the night agenda is the cast of Kya Kool Hain Hum, who would be in town on April 15 to promote the sex comedy hitting the cinemas on Friday. He can feast his eyes on Isha Koppikar and Neha Dhupia, while she can drool over Tushar Kapoor and Ritesh Deshmukh ? all of whom act in the Balaji Telefilms production.

 ?The cast is very young and we hope to get a young crowd that day,? said Gujral.

 But the glamour quotient will be higher when Malaika Arora Khan makes an appearance on April 16. Besides mingling with the crowd, the Chhaiyan chhaiyan girl will quiz people on her agony aunt show on MTV Loveline, item numbers to her credit and her latest number in the forthcoming film Kaal. Those who are not fortunate enough at the quiz can still hope to take away attractive prizes if they shake a leg to Malaika?s numbers to her satisfaction. 

 Girls needn?t fret, for next on the cards is exclusive eye candy for them when Zayed Khan makes an appearance at the same venue on April 23. Men are advised to keep an eye on their wives and girlfriends when the Main Hoon Na dude takes to the dance floor and tests the Bollywood brains of the night raiders about his movies. 

 But both men and women would do well to cram on all the Bollywood basics they can lay their hands on, for there is a trip to Malaysia to be won at a lucky draw every week.

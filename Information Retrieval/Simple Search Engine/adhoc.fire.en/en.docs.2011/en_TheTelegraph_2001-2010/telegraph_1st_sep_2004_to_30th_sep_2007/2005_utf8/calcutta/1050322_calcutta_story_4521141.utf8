 West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Monday said all arrangements for this year?s Higher Secondary examinations, which begin on Tuesday, are in place.

 ?We are totally geared to conduct the examinations and all loopholes have been plugged,? claimed council secretary Debasish Sarkar.

 He said the council had worked out with the police ways of circumventing problems that may arise out of the ongoing BSNL agitation. ?Very often, problems crop up and students or teachers have to get in touch with our control room,? Sarkar said.

 ?Because of problems at BSNL, they may be unable to get through to us easily. So, we will request all concerned that if they are unable to get in touch with our control room, they should approach the nearest police station from where they can get their problems communicated to us through wireless sets.?

 This system will be in place throughout the state. Senior police officers held meetings with the council authorities and agreed to set up the wireless network by midnight on Monday, he added. ?We have completed our routine check-ups. There is no dispute or confusion. The examinations will begin according to schedule,? Sarkar added. 

 The state government will run examination-special buses. Besides, police have been alerted to keep a watch on photocopy outlets during the examinations. Mobile phones, pagers and digital diaries are banned inside examination halls. 

 The CESC and WBSEB have assured the council of uninterrupted power supply during the examinations. The force will keep a special vigil on roads prone to snarls, police said. 

 Police have arranged for tight security at all examination centres. Two constables will be posted at every examination centre. Besides, mobile police vans will keep a strict vigil on roads near the centres.

 Eighty-seven blind and physically-challenged candidates will write this year?s HS examinations. One person serving a life sentence will take the examinations from Dum Dum jail. 

 ?The physically-challenged will get 30 minutes extra to write the examinations,? a council official said.

 Frauds held at Sealdah

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two persons impersonating ticket examiners were arrested at Sealdah station on Thursday afternoon on charges of cheating and extortion.

 ?Saday Kumar Mondol, 30, a resident of Kismat Golberia, in South 24-Parganas, and Sarajit Dutta, 30, a resident of Hariharpur, in the same district, were roughed up by angry passengers at the vendors? gate of the station?s South division. They were later handed over to us,? said Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee, second officer of the Sealdah Government Railway Police (GRP).

 Mondol and Dutta, along with several others, had reportedly been posing as ticket examiners at strategic points on the station premises. 

 They preyed on ticketless travellers and vendors who did not have proper documentation, station officials said.

 ?Ticket examiners must have been involved in the racket. Otherwise the frauds would easily have been apprehended,? a GRP official said.

 The duo got embroiled in an argument with a group of passengers in front of the vendors? gate of the station around 1 pm. Some of the passengers asked for Mondol and Dutta?s credentials when they tried to examine tickets.

 The impersonators were not wearing the standard black coats worn by ticket examiners.

 The argument soon escalated into fisticuffs. Outnumbered, the duo received a beating, before being handed over to the GRP.

 According to railway officials, both Mondol and Dutta had been temporarily employed to assist ticket examiners in the early 1980s, during A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury?s tenure as railway minister.

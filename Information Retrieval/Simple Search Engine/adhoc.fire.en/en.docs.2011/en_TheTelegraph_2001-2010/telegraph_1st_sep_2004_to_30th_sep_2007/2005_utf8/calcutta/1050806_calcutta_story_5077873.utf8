 RAP POWER: Amitabh Bachchan in KBC 2

 You?re humming it now. Very soon, you?ll be dancing to it. The KBC rap song promos, part of the dugna campaign on air as a build-up to the telecast of Kaun Banega Crorepati 2 on August 5, is on every lip. 

 And this Friendship Day (August 7), when you step into your fave party haunt, don?t be surprised if you hear the Big B crooning ?Yeh hai Mister Vijay Nazare??

 From kids to the middle-aged, everybody has been humming this rap song since it went on air a couple of weeks ago. Now, the DJs have come up with their own remixed versions to make the party people jive to it. 

 After the toothpaste ad jingles and title tracks of K-sagas, Don?t Lose Hope is the next big thing that is not directly related to Bollywood. The Big B had earlier rapped in the Abhishek Bachchan-Rani Mukherjee starrer Bunty aur Babli. 

 ?It could have been any other rap song, but Amitabh Bachchan rapping it in his own distinct style makes it different,? says DJ Akash. ?I have the remix ready and I am going to play it on Friendship Day.? 

 DJ Lloyd, too, has a remixed version in his studio. ?I am sure the youngsters are going to freak out on this. I have slotted it for the Sunday jam session,? says the table-turner at B.E.D, on Ballygunge Circular Road.

 But what is it that makes the Big B rap rock so hard? The presence and the playback of the superstar are reasons enough to make the renditions popular. 

 ?The tune and the rap are quite catchy, which is why the kids have picked them up very well. But it is the ?hope? factor that has caught the imagination of the middle class,? explains Nitin Pradhan, who has created the campaign with Vivek Kakkar.

 ?This time, it is not just about money. It is also about the hope of making it to the big platform, sitting face-to-face with the god of Bollywood and being seen by the entire nation,? Pradhan adds.

 The struggling actor, wannabe cricketer who has passed his prime and the singer portray the hopes and the aspirations of the middle class. 

 ?When we were creating the song, we never thought Big B would rap it. He agreed at the eleventh hour and that, perhaps, is the secret of the campaign?s success,? says Amar Mangrulkar, who composed the song.

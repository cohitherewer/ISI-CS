Heroines with the heart for live action

The stage has given birth to many a Hollywood star while always 

tempting new faces big and small to take the plunge, often to explore 

creative vistas denied on celluloid. Here is a look at some of the leading ladies 

who have broken filmi ranks

 Nicole Kidman is shown on stage as she accepts 

the 2003 American Cinematheque Award

Kathleen Turner plays Mrs Robinson with Matthew 

Rhys in The Graduate

Holly Hunter

March 2005 saw this diminutive acting powerhouse storm 

London?s West End in By The Bog of Cats, which has been nominated for the 

Olivier Award for best new play. Hunter, who won the Oscar for her portrayal of 

a deaf-mute pianist in Jane Campion?s The Piano (for which she performed 

the music herself), has also taken on Broadway?s Crimes of the Heart and 

The Wake of Jamey Foster. 

In 2003, she was one of the many ?mystery star guests? 

? alongside Alan Alda, Roger Moore, Liam Neeson, Glen Close, Jeff Goldblum, Nathan 

Lane and John McEnroe ? in the Kenneth Branagh-directed The Play What I Wrote.

Kathleen Turner

The lady best known for her husky voice is not at 

all new to the stage, having won a Tony nomination for her take on Tennessee Williams?s 

feisty Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1990. 

She is now starring as Martha in the revival of Edward 

Albee?s Who?s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? 

The sultry Romancing the Stone star, who turned 

down the role that eventually went to Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, drew 

in the crowds as Mrs Robinson in The Graduate (as did Jerry Hall) and has 

appeared in a number of productions over the years, including A Midsummer Night?s 

Dream and Travesties.

Calista Flockhart

The actress best known to viewers as Ally McBeal has 

a role in Shakespeare on screen (Helena in A Midsummer Night?s Dream) and 

Tennessee Williams on stage (Laura in The Glass Menagerie, marking her 

Broadway debut). She has also demonstrated her skill in Anton Chekhov?s The 

Three Sisters (also featuring Jean Tripplehorn), Our Town, The Loop, 

Sophistry and All For One. 

She featured in the acclaimed The Vagina Monologues 

for two weeks in 2000 and in February 2001, and also appeared in an all-star 

version at Madison Square Garden with Jane Fonda, Oprah Winfrey and Melissa Etheridge.

Nicole Kidman

The Australian Oscar winner was nominated in the best 

actress category at the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award 1999 for her role in The 

Blue Room, infamous for a brief nude appearance.

Helen Hunt

The As Good As It Gets star moved to New York 

in 2000 with the intention of doing more theatre work, especially Shakespeare. 

She has previously played Bianca in The Taming of the Shrew in a Shakespeare 

in the Park production, also starring Morgan Freeman. Her Broadway debut was with 

Our Town in 1989. In 2003, she starred in a Broadway original, Life 

(X) 3.

Melanie Griffith

It may be a long time since the Working Girl has 

been in a ?big? big screen production, but she won rave reviews for her role as 

Roxie Hart in the 2003 revival of Chicago (think of the murderous Renee 

Zellweger). 

And all the while, her star husband Antonio Banderas 

was busy at a theatre across the street, where he featured in Nine. The 

couple was honoured in 2004 by the Drama League.

Toni Braxton

Not just actresses, but singers too have been entranced 

by the stage. The R amp;B star of the 90s was signed as Belle in Disney?s Broadway 

production of Beauty and the Beast in 1998. At the time, she was embroiled 

in a legal battle, having filed for bankruptcy over contractual issues with her 

recording label. The role was played by another singing star famous in the 80s, 

Debbie Out of the Blue Gibson. In 2003, Braxton starred in Aida as 

well, a musical scored by Elton John and Tim Rice, which was also picked up by 

a singer celeb, Michelle T. Williams of the Beyonce-led group Destiny?s Child.

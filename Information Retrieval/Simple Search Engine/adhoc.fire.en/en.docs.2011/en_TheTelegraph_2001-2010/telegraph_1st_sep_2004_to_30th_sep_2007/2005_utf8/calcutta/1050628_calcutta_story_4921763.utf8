The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star show overcast

 - Weather spoils chance to see conjunction of Venus, Mercury amp; Saturn

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was the best chance, till 2030, to view three planets come as close as it gets. But the cloud cover spoilt the star show for Calcuttans on Monday.

 The conjunction of Venus, Mercury and Saturn had begun on June 24. ?On Monday, they came so close to each other that it would have been difficult to identify Venus and Mercury separately,? Debiprosad Duari, director, research and academics, MP Birla Planetarium, told Metro.

 The weather came in the way, for stargazers and scientists alike. But had there been a clear sky just after sunset, Calcuttans could have simply turned their gaze to the skies, between west and north-west, and spotted the rare planetary alignment which will not be viewable so clearly for another 25 years.

 ?The angular distance between Venus and Mercury is less than one-tenth of a degree, while that between the two and Saturn is around one degree,? said Duari, adding how Mercury and Venus will never come so close together till 2070.

 In terms of distance, Mercury is 90 million miles, Venus 140 million miles and Saturn 930 million miles away from earth. An alignment like this occurs as most planets revolve around the sun on the same plane, and, on certain occasions, appear to be on top of each other.

 The silver lining for the star-struck is that the alignment will be visible till around July 15. ?They can be best seen in the remaining light after sunset,? said Duari. In 2004, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn had formed a similar alignment, not be repeated till 2035.

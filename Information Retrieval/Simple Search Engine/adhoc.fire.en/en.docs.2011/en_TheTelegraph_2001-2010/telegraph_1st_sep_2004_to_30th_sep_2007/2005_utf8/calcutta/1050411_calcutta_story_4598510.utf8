The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Journal link with support base

 PARTHA CHATTERJEE, Trinamul Congress MLA, Behala (East), met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Rajiv Guha, Soma Chowdhury, Sattwik Talukder, Abdul Kedar Babu, Srikumar Roychowdhury, Swapan Roychowdhury, Rikta Ghosh, Avijit Moitra, Goutam Halder, Amitava Dutta, Sanjay Chakraborty, Sapan Das and Kuheli Banerjee

Soma Chowdhury: Your party recently brought out a mouthpiece called Jago Bangla. Is it your challenge to CPM?s Ganashakti?

 Every responsible political party should have an organ to voice its ideology. Our mouthpiece will act as a medium of communication between the leadership and the support base. Jago Bangla is still in a state of infancy. I hope it will be effective in highlighting the plight of the common people.

Srikumar Roychowdhury: Biren Roy Road (West) has not been widened. Thus, the flyover will not serve its purpose even after it is completed. Why aren?t you drawing the attention of the state government towards the problem?

 We have drawn the attention of the administration to the problem several times, but nothing has been done.The southern flank of the flyover will descend on Biren Roy Road. The congestion there will have a ripple effect on James Long Sarani, where the traffic will be chaotic once the flyover is commissioned.

 A private organisation has encroached upon a part of James Long Sarani and unless the encroachment is removed, the road cannot be utilised properly. 

Rajiv Guha: Nearly 500,000 people depend on Vidyasagar Hospital, which is in a bad shape. As MLA of the area, what have you done to improve its condition? 

 I had asked the PWD to look after the necessary repair of the hospital building, which was done. Blood test equipment has been bought with a Rs 3.5-lakh financial assistance from the MLA?s local area development fund. A paediatric unit and a heart clinic have also been started.

 Unfortunately, as the hospital is the only one in the area, it is always overcrowded.The condition of the hospital lift is not up to the mark. I drew the attention of health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra to it. He promised to look into the problem. 

Swapan Roychowdhury: Sewerage is a major problem in Behala. Have you drawn the attention of the government to it?

 I have spoken to urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya. He told me that there was a plan to develop the sewerage system of the area with funds sanctioned by the Asian Development Bank. Even the final document was shown to me on July 6, 2003. But I heard recently that doubts had been raised on whether the necessary work can be taken up in wards 125, 126, 127, 128 and 131, which are part of my constituency.

 I have also spoken to mayor Subrata Mukherjee and he has assured me that the civic body will find out a way to develop the sewerage system in the wards. 

Abdul Kedar Babu: Supply of water to Thakur Bazar and Bankra is not satisfactory. Can the situation be improved?

 This is a long-standing problem. We, perhaps, need a booster station to increase the water flow in these areas. We have a plan for a Thakurpukur market. As the market came up on private land, I cannot sanction funds to develop it as a multiplex. Local councillors and the mayor are exploring ways to develop it along with private bodies on a build-operate-transfer basis. The mayor has already inspected the area. 

Sapan Das: Piling of garbage in wards 127 and 131, near Oxytown, has became a nuisance. Are you doing anything to improve the garbage clearing?

 The population has sharply increased in the areas and though the municipality regularly collects the garbage, the volume of it is compounding the problem. I will take up the matter with the councillors concerned.

To be concluded

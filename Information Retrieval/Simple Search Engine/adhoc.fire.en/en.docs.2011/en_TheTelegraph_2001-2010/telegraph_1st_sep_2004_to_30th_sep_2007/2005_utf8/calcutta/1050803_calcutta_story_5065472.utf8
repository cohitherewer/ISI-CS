 Trio pitch for LRT revival

 - L amp;T, Srei and Bhel offer to fund Buddha transit dream

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pet project, the Light Rail Transit (LRT), is set to be revived, with three companies offering to foot the Rs 2,400-crore bill.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Tuesday: ?A few companies have informed us they are willing to associate themselves with the project by assuming the financial liabilities. They will invest the entire amount and recover the money by selling tickets and through other means to be decided across the table.?

 According to officials of the department, Srei group and L amp;T are among those who have offered to implement the project on a build-operate-transfer basis. Central government undertaking Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited has offered to take up the project as a joint venture.

 The chief minister has asked the transport minister to look into the offers without delay, the officials added.

 ?I have asked the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) to start negotiations with the firms that have offered to take up the project and arrange a video presentation on what they want to do and the financial implications,?? said Chakraborty.

 The minister added: ?We will take a decision after witnessing the presentations of the companies and going through their terms and conditions. Their credentials will also be verified.?

 The government had initially approached the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) for funds. A draft project report was submitted in April, but the proposal was turned down. Since then, the government has been on the lookout for a financier.

 The TIDC had invited expressions of interest from entrepreneurs in June. Twelve companies, including firms from the UK and Singapore, had responded. Consulting Engineering Services was engaged to prepare a shortlist.

 ?The companies had proposed different modes of rapid transit, like MAGLEV, Skybus and high-speed trams. We opted for LRT as it is the most suitable. The process was stalled after availability of JBIC funds became uncertain,?? said TIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee.

 The transport minister said the government was still hopeful of getting funds from JBIC and the chief minister had taken a personal initiative in that regard. ?Foreign funds, if available later, will be provided to the private party entrusted in implementing the project,? Chakraborty signed off.

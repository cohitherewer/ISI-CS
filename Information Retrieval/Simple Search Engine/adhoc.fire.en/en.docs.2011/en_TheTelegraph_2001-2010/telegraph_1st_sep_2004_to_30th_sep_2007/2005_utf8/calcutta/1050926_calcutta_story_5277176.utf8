The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The seats in most private buses in the city are too high. The bundle of coir packed in rexine which is attached to cushion the surface not only increases its height but also makes it uneven. A travel of more than half-an-hour in these buses cause terrible discomfort and leg pain, especially for women and elderly passengers. The regional transport authority should standardise the height of the seats in private buses, along with other specifications for their design.

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 A shrine has come up on the divider of the approach road from Prince Anwar Shah Road to the Lake Gardens flyover. Decades-old temples and shrines encroaching upon pavements cannot be demolished as the move might hurt religious sentiments. But at least the authorities can stop new ones from cropping up.

 Jagdish Kumar, 

 Address not given.

 The SBI branch and its ATM at AE market of Salt Lake has been maintained so well that it looks like a foreign bank. On the other hand, not only did I find the bank?s ATMs in Bagmari and Maniktala defunct, but also very shabby. Why doesn?t the bank maintain all its branches and ATMs in the same manner? Do the customers differ from branch to branch, ATM to ATM?

 Sudarshan Ghosh

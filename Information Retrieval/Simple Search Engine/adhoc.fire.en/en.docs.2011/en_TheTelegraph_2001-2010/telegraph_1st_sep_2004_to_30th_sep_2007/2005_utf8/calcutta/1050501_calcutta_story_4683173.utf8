 City Lights

 When variety is the spice

 Grilled Samak, Erachi Barata Curry, Lahm ki Okra, Coorg Chicken? The names are certainly not those that have long tickled your tastebuds at Park Street restaurants. These dishes are exotic, boast their regional flavours and can be found anywhere from Salt Lake to Sarat Bose Road. And often, there?s a beeline for even a table for two.

 The city?s gastronomic palate is changing fast, almost in sync with the culinary cauldron that has moved out of its traditional abode, Park Street. 

 Gone are the days when a Chinese meal meant gravy chow mein and chilli chicken, or a South Indian platter conjured images of pale dosas and fluffy idlis. In every limb of the city, new-age eateries, also known as speciality restaurants, are rustling up Thai, Italian and Turkish recipes that?s Greek to most.

 ?Calcuttans are tired of monotony and are willing to experiment. With more travelling and more exposure, they have inculcated a taste for good and healthy food irrespective of the region it belongs too,? says Shafiul Ishaque of Tamarind. Only last summer, the Sarat Bose Road eatery introduced South Indian non-vegetarian food, a concept unknown to many Calcuttans. 

 ?Initially, we were flooded with queries. I was really apprehensive for the first two months, but the footfalls swelled big time since then,? adds Shafiul, who now finds it difficult to accommodate people on weekends.

 Though the choice of menu has been going through a metamorphosis for the past few years, the increasing footfall is a relatively new phenomenon. 

 ?It?s a result of the growing spending power. Big families have shrunk to nuclear ones with most of them having double income,? feels Rajesh Dubey, director of food products, Speciality Restaurants Private Limited, which owns Oh! Calcutta, on Elgin Road, and Mainland China on Ballygunge Circular Road. ?Depending on the preferences of the family members, different places are tried out,? he adds.

 The trend can also be attributed to the high-flying lifestyle of a section of the city. ?It is the upwardly mobile generation which eats out on an average thrice a week and parties late into the night,? says restaurateur Rikki Diwan, who ventured into Chinese and Thai cuisine in 2001 with Pepper Chino on Sarat Bose Road. 

 The good response ? but after a while ? prompted Diwan to open China Bistro, on Muzaffar Ahmed Street, last year. The eatery serves Italian food apart from Chinese. 

 As an increasing number of people are hitting the streets for a meal outside, more and more restaurants specialising in Bengali, North Indian and North West Frontier cuisine are mushrooming closer home. But at the end of the day it will be the survival of the fittest. 

 ?You have to customise the food according to the taste of the guests. If you fail, there are other options available,? says Rajesh Dubey. ?Compromising on quality to reduce overheads would spell doom. Moreover optimum pricing, quality service and comfortable environs play a big role in defining a restaurant?s position in the market,? he adds.

 Change is constant and innovation is the key. ?There are many restaurants which serve the same cuisine. Quality and pricing gives you an edge over the others,? feels Dimpy Singh of D?Fire N Ice, a North Indian speciality restaurant on Sarat Bose Road yet to complete a year.

 Rare glimpses of Ray

 (Top) A moment from Pather Panchali; Satyajit Ray directs Karuna Banerjee on the sets

 To mark the 84th birth anniversary of Satyajit Ray and the golden jubilee of Pather Panchali?s release, Nandan IV is hosting an exhibition of posters of the maestro?s films from May 2. The posters have been collated by Rudrajit Mukherjee, a documentary film-maker, from his personal collection of Ray memorabilia. 

 The films featured include Pather Panchali, Aparajito, Apur Sansar, Parash Pathar, Jalsaghar, Devi, Teen Kanya, Abhijan, Mahanagar, Kapurush-O-Mahapurush, Nayak, Chiriakhana, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, Aranyer Dinratri, Pratidwandi, Seemabaddha, Sonar Kella, Jana Aranya, Joy Baba Felunath, Hirak Rajar Deshe, Ghare Baire, Ganashatru, Shakha Proshakha, Agantuk and Goopy Bagha Phire Elo, for which Ray had written the story and scored the music. 

 The three films missing from the exhibition are Charulata, Shatranj Ke Khiladi and Ashani Sanket. 

 ?The Kanchenjunga poster is quite rare. Neither Sandip Ray nor the Ray archive in California has it. Being Ray?s first film in colour, the poster is a very interesting one, designed with 16 faces,? says Mukherjee, who started building his Ray treasure trove over the past four years. The collectibles have mostly been procured from individuals and film distributors.

 Posters apart, the six-day display also showcases booklets, show cards and gramophone record covers of the film-maker?s works. 

 Apart from the Ray collection, Mukherjee boasts a kitty of around 1,500 booklets of Bengali films. ?Earlier, the booklets used to be sold during the film release at cinema halls,? says Mukherjee, who possesses posters of Bimal Roy?s Udayer Pathe and of several films starring Uttam Kumar. 

 On May 2, a discussion has also been organised by Paschimbanga Chalachhitra Kendra at Nandan II. Mrinal Sen, Tarun Majumdar, Mihir Bhattacharya, Sanjay Mukhopadhyay, Mainak Biswas and Nabinananda Sen will talk on ?Pather Panchali ? a turning point in Indian cinema?. 

 A screening of Pather Panchali will follow.

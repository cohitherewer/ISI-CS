 He may be the defending champion but his daughter doesn?t give him a chance. Why? He is up against Amitabh Bachchan this year.

 Derek O?Brien has been nominated in the Best Host category in the ITA (Indian Television Academy) Awards this year but to win the trophy, like he did last year for Bournvita Quiz Contest, Derek has to beat the Kaun Banega Crorepati host.

 ?I think it?s an honour enough to be nominated alongside the big man. Come on, your name is being taken with God! I am more thrilled than last year although I know my chances are zero,? Derek tells Metro.

 The ITA Awards, to be shown this Saturday on STAR Plus, has Shekhar Suman (He Man) and Annu Kapoor and Pallavi Joshi (Antakshari) also vying for the Best Host honour.

 A total of 46 channels will be taking part in the awards this year and there are more than 50 categories. Mona Singh is the favourite to win the Best Actress award in the drama category for Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin, while Shivaji Satam is expected to bag the Best Actor trophy for CID.

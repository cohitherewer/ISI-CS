 The city?s Revolutionary Hash House Harriers capped their Saturday run with barrels of beer on the lawns of the Kenilworth Hotel. 

 The spirit of camaraderie, fun and revelry of the 15-odd participants of the ?drinking club with a running problem? was visible as they played beer games and tossed around anecdotes.

 Started by Paul Walsh in November 2002, ?hashing is a mixture of athleticism and sociability, hedonism and hard work?, according to a spokesperson. 

 A Hash is a non-competitive run where the course is arbitrarily set by one or more hashers called hares. The hares run out in advance of the other hashers (the hounds), and mark the course with white flour, toilet paper or chalk marks. The total distance is usually around 4 miles, and done in a fun spirit.

 When forced to, hashers do run the occasional street or alley, but in general they prefer fields, jungles, swamps, streams, fences, storm drains and cliffs. And the trail?s end is an out and out party. 

 Hashing dates back as far as the 18th century, but came to life in the post-war years, spreading slowly through Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand, before becoming really popular in the late 70s and the early 80s. 

 Now the Hash world has over 1,200 active chapters in about 160 countries, and this despite the total absence of any central organisation. 

 ?Hashers have a total, unquestioning acceptance for each other. It is largely because of this spirit and attitude that the hash movement has evolved into an unstructured and international affiliation,? added a spokesperson.

 Class act

 The Calcutta Foundation Orchestra, which is likely to come under the wing of the Calcutta School of Music soon, held a delightful concert at the Sandre Hall on Saturday evening. The 6 Sunny Park address was almost house full to listen to the hour-long programme that began with a fast-paced orchestral demonstration of the first movement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart?s Sinfonia no. 8. The racy tempo left the audience eager for more. 

 What followed was composer Anton Filtz?s Sinfonietta in D major. The audience was taken through the entire journey of the piece, with the pace changing as per the mood and feel of the music. 

 The second half of the concert brought vocals into the realm of instrumentality with a performance by Lee Alison Sibley, accompanied by Reverend Noel Sen on the piano. Singing in her soprano voice, Sibley?s rendition of George Philipp Telemann?s Kanarienvogel kantate (the canary cantata) was full of passion. 

 The event was special for Sibley as this was the first time she sang a classical piece with an orchestra, as well as her last public performance in the city, which she has ?grown to love?. 

 As an encore, she sang the popular Rabindrasangeet Ami chinigo chini tomare, to a hearty applause from the audience.

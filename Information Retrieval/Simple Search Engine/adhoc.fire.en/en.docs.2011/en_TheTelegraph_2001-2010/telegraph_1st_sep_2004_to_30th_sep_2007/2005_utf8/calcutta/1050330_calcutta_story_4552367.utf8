The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An actor and a producer

 A moment from Miss Congeniality

 Veteran movie producer is not the first title that comes to mind at the mention of Sandra Bullock?s name. Yet with eight film credits as producer, that is as suitable a way to describe her as any other. As she revealed on the sets of her latest acting-producing project, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous, the sequel to the 2000 worldwide hit comedy Miss Congeniality, Bullock feels as passionate about working behind the camera as she does in front of it, referring to the project as her ?baby?. 

 But even after acting in and producing successful movies like Miss Congeniality and Two Weeks Notice, Bullock admits navigating her various responsibilities is no easy task. 

 ?It?s psychotic and schizophrenic,? Bullock says. ?There?s a lot of stress involved. I found that when I would fight things and wanted to control everything, every time something went wrong.? She admits that in the past she was ?adversely affected? by the dramas that happened off-camera. But with experience Bullock says, ?I?ve learned to just stay incredibly loose.? 

 For the particular scene she is shooting for, Bullock is dressed as an older version of Gracie Hart, the undercover FBI agent she plays in the movie. Despite being several weeks into a production that at times involves five crews of 100 people working simultaneously, Bullock does appear relaxed. 

 Asked about her reason for once again producing and acting in a movie, Bullock says jokingly, ?I obviously like the drama or I wouldn?t be doing it. I keep subjecting myself to it!? 

 The actress explains that she decided to team up again with writer Marc Lawrence because she feels strongly about the story of the gutsy FBI agent who uses her looks in unusual ways to catch criminals, winding up in funny situations. ?Marc and I made the film because I was tired of all the male comedians getting the physical comedy movies,? Bullock says, noting that romantic comedies are usually the vehicles for actresses. 

 Sandra Bullock: Comic turn 

There?s not a lot of romance in Miss Congeniality 

2: Armed and Fabulous, though. ?It?s about the story of this outcast ? as 

we all are, I think, in our lives ? trying to do what she instinctually feels 

is right,? Bullock says, ?even though it goes completely against the grain of 

what society expects of her.? 

 Lawrence, who wrote and produced the first Miss Congeniality with Bullock and then directed Two Weeks Notice, says coming up with a true physical comedy was something both he and Bullock agreed about when they first started to develop the story. 

 ?We were much more interested in making it a movie about a woman who finds herself through the friendship with another woman,? Lawrence says about Bullock?s character and her on-screen friendship with co-star Regina King. The lead character ?doesn?t have to rely on finding a relationship with a man to make her life right,? he adds. 

 In this respect, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous has evolved from the first film, which had a strong romantic component with the relationship between Hart and her colleague Eric Matthews, played by Benjamin Bratt. ?The beginning of our movie is the break-up of that relationship,? says director John Pasquin, ?and how you survive that kind of emotional turmoil and the ways that you adjust.? 

 After breaking up with Matthews, Hart, who becomes famous following her exploits at the beauty pageant in the first film, goes on tour to demonstrate her techniques for capturing criminals.

 The film-makers also brought a lot of physical comedy to this relationship and ?there are really great combat scenes in this one,? Bullock adds. Because of this emphasis on physical comedy, Pasquin says that King was actually an unlikely choice for the part initially. ?The wonderful thing about it is she?s so small,? Pasquin says about the actress. ?And we were looking for somebody who was somewhat physically imposing? but the fact that King was short and slight ?became a plus comedically because she is so feisty,? he adds. 

 From her perspective, Bullock says it was important to have ?a comedic short-hand? on-set with her writer and her director. 

 ?We all collaborate rather well together,? she says. ?We said we weren?t going to make this one unless we had a film that we thought was strong all by itself and either equalled or went one step further than the first one.?

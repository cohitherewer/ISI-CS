 Hype-or-hide puja ploy 

 - Organisers step up publicity pitch

 To tell, or not to tell. Or how much to tell. These are the questions dividing puja organisers as they step up the publicity drive in the run-up to Mahasasthi.

 All major intersections in the city are now draped with billboards blocking every inch at eye-level. Sample these at the Rashbehari crossing ? 41 Pally Haridebpur-er ebar proyash shailpik bhabnay abhinaba Durga mandap (41 Pally?s effort this time a novel work of art); Suruchir pujo dekhtey hoy, noile aphsosh kortey hoy; 2002: Orissa (Unemployment), 2003: Kerala (Thaiyam to Kathakali), 2004: Rajasthan (Land of royalty), 2005: ????

 A lot of words, giving away little. Most organisers are keeping their concept cards close to their chest. ?When we put up the hoardings in mid-August, there was a risk of the theme being plagiarised,? admits Dipankar Chatterjee of 41 Pally in Haridevpur.

 Chatterjee?s fear is not without foundation. ?In 2000, we created a pandal using dhudhul (a gourd) and publicised that. A rival picked up the idea. That taught us a lesson.?

 Where novelty is the USP in the crowd-pulling game, apprehension of a leak can reach phobic proportions. 

 ?Prakriti jekhane thomke thake (Where Nature stands still),? reads the billboard of Behala Club. Neither passersby nor organiser knows what that means. ?Our theme-maker Amar Sarkar has coined this line but refused to explain the theme. Otherwise, he says, the idea will spread through our friends and family,? club member Bulbul Roy says. They have enough faith in ?dada?, though, after his award-winning Dashabatar card show last year.

 Building up suspense is the motive behind the promo prop of Ashoknagar Sarbojanin ? Shilpir aporup srishti (An artist?s wondrous creation). ?This will intrigue pandal-hoppers,? says Suman Chakraborty. 

 Ashoknagar has no fear of being copied. ?A number of pujas may hit on the same theme. Six years ago, the theme epar Bangla, opar Bangla (the two Bengals) came up in a big way. But Bosepukur swept the awards, as their execution was the best.?

 A few, though, are showing their hand. Gora Roy Chowdhury chuckles when quizzed about his club Chakraberia Sarbojanin?s hoarding ?Phitkirir sphatik swadrish mandir? (A crystal temple of alum). 

 ?We put up the hoardings only on September 1.? Organisers agree that an August disclosure is risky, but come September, the Puja deadline draws too close for copying in comfort.

 There are some bravehearts advocating hype over hide. Hazra?s Yuba Maitri takes a pledge of Rakhi brotherhood ? Rakhibandhaner aloke, abichhedyo maitrir shapath.

 ?If we announce our concept first, others working on the same lines will have second thoughts. Even if they continue, we will be the first name associated with the theme,? says Debajyoti Basu. ?This is the first time we are giving the theme away on the hoardings? In September-end, we will release a clearer message.?

 Timing is vital for other reasons too. ?Last time, we had put up all 50 hoardings at one go. Some got spoilt by the rains, while rivals removed a few,? says the Behala Club member. 

 This time, the strategy is to stagger the display, so that there is a presence during crunch time, too. ?Now, 20 are on view. After Vishwakarma puja, we will put up 15 more. The last 15 will wait till Mahalaya.?

 All organisers agree on the importance of outdoor publicity. ?The famous names do not need this boost. But upcoming pujas have to place pointers at strategic junctions to pull in the crowds. We have to be in contention for prizes to keep the sponsors interested,? says Chakraborty of Ashoknagar.

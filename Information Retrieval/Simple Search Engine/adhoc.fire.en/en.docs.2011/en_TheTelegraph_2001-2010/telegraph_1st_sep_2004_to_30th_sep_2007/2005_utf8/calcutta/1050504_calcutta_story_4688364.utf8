 On April 24, I had gone to the Salt Lake stadium to watch a soccer match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. The kick-off was at 3.30 pm amid sweltering heat and humidity. It was visibly an ordeal for both the players and the spectators to brave the scorching sun. In such extreme weather conditions, the quality of play invariably deteriorates. As Salt Lake stadium has the facility of flood-lights, why aren?t day and night soccer matches organised at the venue during summer? It will increase ticket sales and revenue.

 Screening of children?s films is very rare these days. Multiplexes are usually unaffordable. And the occasional children?s film fests at Nandan are the only opportunity for kids to watch movies on the big screen. But that?s about it. Max Mueller Bhavan?s initiative to screen children?s films from April 26 to 27 was simply wonderful. I took my five-year-old daughter to one of the film sessions and she enjoyed herself thoroughly. We thank the Goethe-Institut for hosting such a nice event.

 Every evening, the vicinity of Bagmari Bazaar turns into a den of vice with peddlers selling illicit liquor and drugs in full public view. On festive days, the illegal trade starts right from morning. There are quite a few coaching centres near Bagmari Bazar and the area is frequented by school and college students. I am surprised at the audacity of the drug-peddlers as they carry on their business with Maniktala police station just half a kilometre away.

 A few weeks back, during a drive back home from Park Circus in our Ambassador we were suddenly stopped by a traffic policeman for a ?routine licence check?. Our Bihari driver was then led away for a private conversation. Five minutes later, an uncharacteristically jittery man got back into the car. After we had passed two red-lights and a bus -stop he mumbled about a Rs 100 that the policeman had forced him to part with. He said the policeman had threatened to fabricate an offence and slap a Rs 500 fine if he didn?t grease his palm. Is there no way we can fight back against such corrupt people?

 These days young men unashamedly occupy ladies seats in buses. Such attitude is simply not acceptable in a civilised society.

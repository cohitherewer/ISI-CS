 Colours of the season

 The cycle of the seasons brings in its wake new dreams, hopes and aspirations. As winter gives way to spring, Gallery Katayun hosts A Winters Tale Phase III, an exhibition of paintings by contemporary Indian artists that brings to life the rich, warm and vibrant colours of the season that ushers in the new year. Featuring works by Robin Mondal, Sanatan Dinda, Paritosh Sen (self-portrait; picture along), Sunil Das, Atul Bose, Arpana Caur, Krishnendu Porel, B.R. Panesar, Mousumi Mutsuddi and Mrinal Mondal, the ongoing exhibition provides a perfect combination of sensuous and aesthetic pleasure for the art lover. Contrary to the traditional symbolic connotations of winter associating it with death, decay and loss of youthful vigour, the works on show present winter in its more positive, cheerful aspects, as a harbinger of reawakening, renewal and growth, recalling the famous quote by Shelley, If winter comes, can spring be far behind ....

 Print pirates target districts

 - Cops bust racket duplicating state board school texts

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The city police?s detective department arrested three persons in Watgunge during night-long raids on Tuesday to crack one of the biggest rackets engaged in selling pirated school books in the state.

 The mastermind of the racket, 41-year-old Khurram Siddiqui, along with associates Aminur Khan and Mobarak Sardar, used to operate from his hideout at 32, Kabitirtha Sarani, in the Watgunge police station area. Gadgets used for copying books and reams of paper worth around Rs 14 lakh have been impounded.

 Among the books that the three printed at a private press was the mathematics textbook for Class VII students of West Bengal Board of Secondary Examination. Besides, some popular texts, including Learning English and Kisholoy, were also being duplicated. Police have already briefed the Board officials about the racket.

 ?The seizure list includes around 35,000 sheets of printed matter for the mathematics textbook. These sheets would have been finally cut down to size, bound into books and then packed off to the markets,? said a senior officer of state government?s press section.

 Investigations reveal Siddiqui and his associates would first select the books that have high market demand and would yield them a good profit. They would then make copies of the printed matter and duplicate the same through offset printing machines. Once the pages of the books were ready, the three would settle down to replicate the Board logo.

 ?The logo would be first cut out from an original book and then replicated using a machine, albeit without the characteristic water mark. Finally, they would print the logo on the sheets and send them, along with the rest of the pages, for book-making,? said the officer.

 During interrogation, Siddiqui confessed to sending the pirated books via transport operators in Posta to different districts of the state. The target districts were Siliguri, Bankura and Birbhum.

 ?In the interiors of these districts, no one would question the quality of print. The logo wouldn?t be scrutinised much, either. Since the pirated books were cheaper, there would be plenty of takers,? an officer added. 

 Police said they will probe whether some schoolteachers were hand-in-glove with the racket, especially in determining the distribution channels.

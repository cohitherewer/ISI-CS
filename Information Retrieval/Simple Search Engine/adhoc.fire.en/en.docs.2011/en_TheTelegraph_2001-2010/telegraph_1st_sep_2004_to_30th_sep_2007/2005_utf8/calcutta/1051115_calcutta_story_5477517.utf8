 The City Diary

 A traders? organisation of Shyamnagar has called a 24-hour bandh in the Baguiati area on Tuesday to protest the police?s alleged failure to net the killers of Pranab Deb, brother-in-law of People for Democratic Socialism (PDS) supremo Samir Putatunda, 48 hours after his body was found in a dumping ground. Deb?s battered body was spotted by a local newspaper vendor early on Sunday. 

 laiming that some clues had emerged during investigation, Praveen Kumar, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, said: ?It is now only a matter of time before we net the culprits.?

 As of now, police are certain that Deb was murdered elsewhere and his body dumped later. ?The modus operandi hints that it must be the handiwork of amateurs. They may not have intended to kill Deb,? said an officer.

 olice, however, have got a vital clue by tracking the recent records of calls made through Deb?s cell phone. ?Deb was in the Baguiati-Dum Dum zone on Saturday night. His cell phone was functioning till 11 pm,? the officer added.

 It is clear which political party is backing the assasins. I have told the sleuths everything about it. Police action has been slowed down because of the patronage that the killers are enjoying,? alleged Putatunda.

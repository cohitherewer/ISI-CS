 Wanted: A suitable boy for my teenaged girl; not to tie the knot, but to be her beau at college parties and on her nights out at the club.

 Such a petition of parental concern hasn?t yet hit the eye in print here, but fathers and mothers are doing the next best thing ? calling on counsellors and psychiatrists to cope with growing pressure to find their teenaged child a boyfriend or girlfriend.

 Unless girls in their late teens have a boyfriend ? or boys a girlfriend ? on their arm, they often ?don?t belong? to their gang. And those who can?t find one on their own, turn to their parents for help.

 ?The parents are facing this unique situation where their introverted teenaged sons or daughters are giving them the task of finding a suitable partner for them,? says psychiatrist Rima Mukherji, who admits being ?taken by surprise? when such cases started trickling in a while ago. 

 Now, she is visited by almost 10 such parents in a month.

 ?Even parents are comfortable with their child having a date. So, it is becoming more of a norm to have a partner in high school and college. The peer pressure to be seen with a date is also high. Now, those who find it difficult to find a boy/girlfriend become frustrated. And it?s just a matter of time before they confide in their parents and seek a solution,? says Mukherji.

 Ask Aveek Mohta, whose son is 19. ?We have been very liberal with him and allowed him to enjoy his growing-up years. But of late, he was showing signs of depression and even his health deteriorated. On probing, we found that he was suffering from insecurity because he did not have a girlfriend, unlike his other classmates. It was then that we thought of seeking professional help.?

 Counsellors generally chalk out a roadmap for romance minus the recklessness of youth. Suggestions range from providing confidence-boosting tips to guiding a teenager towards the right kind of company.

 ?The best way to solve such a problem is to probe and get to the root cause. It has been observed that most of the time, it is some sort of physical shortcoming, like lack of height, dark complexion or wrong accent that deepen inhibitions. We try to divert their minds towards the positives in their character,? says Atashi Gupta of CINI.

 That such pre-nuptial petitions are on the rise is confirmed by Sanjay Duggar of Khushi Matrimonials. And often, they come straight from the heart. 

 ?This 18-year-old boy, from a reputed English-medium school, came to me with serious depression. His problem was that he could not find a girlfriend, while his 16-year-old brother already had a date. The parents initially turned a blind eye to this ?adolescent problem? but when his studies went through a slump, they were forced to seek counselling and lend him a helping hand.?

 Most parents seek professional advice to know how best to deal with the situation. ?A couple even asked me whether they should spread the word around or look for someone in their close friends? circle,? recounts psychiatrist Mukherji.

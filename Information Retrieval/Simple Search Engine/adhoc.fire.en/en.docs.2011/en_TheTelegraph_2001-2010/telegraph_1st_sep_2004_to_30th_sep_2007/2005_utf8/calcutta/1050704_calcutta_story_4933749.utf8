The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You cant get through this week without?

Throwing a rain dance party

 If the damp is already getting to you, throw 

a rain-dance party to cheer things up. Just when the clouds threaten to burst, 

get all your family, friends or colleagues in the vicinity together, plug in some 

heady music and soak in the fun till someone gets the sniffles.

Getting drip-dry gear

 If the pitter patter doesnt make you 

feel like breaking into a jig, here is a piece of practical advise. Stow away 

your cottons and invest in some drip-dry gear to save your laundry from creeping 

indoors and staying there for days on end. Stick to three-quarter trousers and 

denims or shorts for the most part to avoid scrubbing the muck off sweeping hemlines 

in the first place.

Dreaming up Venice

 l said, theres not much you can do about 

the waterlogged streets and the slush around it waiting to splatter you in beautiful 

shades of brown. So keep a few colourful paper boats handy to float them with 

much fanfare with tiny captions featuring your most ardent wishes on road repairs 

and civic amenities, hoping the authorities are shamed into action. Or, if you 

cant beat em, join em. Buy a small boat and start rowing! If 

you lack inspiration, plan that trip to Venice you have always dreamed of to get 

into the gondola mood.

Catching Sarkar

 The grand old man of Bollywood seems to be 

getting bigger by the day. There is no missing him as he pops up in one pot-boiler 

after the other, the latest being Sarkar. Bachchan fans get a bonus chhota 

B thrown in with this one, along with the suave Kay Kay Menon and three glam dolls 

? Rukhsar, Katrina and Tanishaa. Watch the Big B play patriarch.

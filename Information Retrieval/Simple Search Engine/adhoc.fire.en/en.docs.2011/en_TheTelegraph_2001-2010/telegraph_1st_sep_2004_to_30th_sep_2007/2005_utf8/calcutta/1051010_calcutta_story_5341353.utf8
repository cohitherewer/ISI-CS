The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Directors? special 

Who is the best Bengali film-maker on the Indian screen? 

The answer to this kicks off our three-act festive film special. Readers have 

responded by the hundreds, SMSing their choices loud and clear. And when Calcuttans 

voice their opinion, theres bound to be a surprise here and an upset there. 

So, read on...

rituparno ghosh 

Director number one, with 49.7 per cent votes. A blend 

of the cerebral and the star appeal has been his USP, ever since Rituparno started 

his award-winning spree with Unishe April. There?s no one like him when 

it comes to signing on top Bollywood stars from the confines of his south Calcutta 

address, and then mixing ?em with local stars. So, if Aishwarya (Chokher Bali 

and Raincoat) is a Ritu favourite, so is Raima (Chokher Bali , Antarmahal 

and now Khela). If Manisha Koirala is up next, Konkona is never too 

far off the radar. And for all the Ajay Devgans and Abhishek Bachchans, Prosenjit 

remains precious.

Update: Antarmahal releases post-Puja, 

then Doshar.

 APARNA SEN

She?s the sole feminine powerhouse in the pack, raking 

in 19.8 per cent votes. Sen is a darling of old-timers, who still swear by 36 

Chowringhee Lane, with which she switched to direction from acting. The last 

hurrah (after Parama and Paromitar Ekdin) has been Mr amp; Mrs 

Iyer, a telling love story in times of strife. 

Update: Awaiting the release of 15 Park 

Avenue, starring Konkona, Shabana Azmi and Waheeda Rehman.

 pradeep sarkar

?Fatafati!? is how the only Mumbai-based director 

in the Top 5 reacted to the poll results which saw him getting 10.3 per cent votes. 

?Bengalis have a different sensitivity and it?s now being recognised across the 

world,? he added, referring to directorial debut Parineeta breaking into 

Top 10 global charts.

Update: In Rajasthan as visual director for 

Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Eklavya.

 Buddhadeb Dasgupta 

Winner of the maximum number of National Awards among 

his contemporaries. The festival fanatic has managed 7.8 per cent votes, probably 

on the popular plank of Uttara and Mando Meyer Upakhyan. 

Update: Though his Swapner Din and Kalpurush 

are just refusing to release, the prolific director is on to his next with 

Rahul Bose.

GOUTAM GHOSE

He has the Murder man Anurag Bose breathing 

down his neck, as he scrapes through to fifth place with 5.8 per cent votes. One 

generation knows him as the man who made Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi turn 

the tide in Paar and even make Shatrughan Sinha act in Antarjali Yatra. 

The next generation knows him as the man who lured Tabu and a bunch of Tolly 

veterans to the forests of north Bengal (Abar Aranye) to recreate a Ray 

classic.

Update: Yatra with Rekha, starting 

November.

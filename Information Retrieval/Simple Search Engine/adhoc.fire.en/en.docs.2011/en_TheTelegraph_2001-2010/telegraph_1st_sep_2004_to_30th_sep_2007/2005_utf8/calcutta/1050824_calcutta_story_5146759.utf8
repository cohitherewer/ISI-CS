 Dengue dossier sought

 - Halt threat on errant builders, scurry for fog machines

 The health department on Tuesday asked all hospitals and nursing homes in the city to keep it informed if any person is found to be suffering from dengue. Dengue has already claimed seven lives here.

 ?We have asked them to get in touch with the School of Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases if anyone is suspected to be suffering from the disease,? said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. 

 Over 100 cases of dengue and instances where patients are showing dengue-like symptoms were reported over the past few days from Lake Gardens, Dhakuria, Tollygunge, Anwar Shah Road, Ranikuthi, Bijoygarh and Santoshpur, in south Calcutta, large areas of Dum Dum, including Bediapara and RN Tagore Road, and Bhatpara, deep north.

 The director of health services said that so far, seven cases of confirmed dengue have been reported from Calcutta and five cases have been reported from Bhatpara.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who returned from Assam on Tuesday, cancelled the leave of employees in the civic health and conservancy departments.

 ?I insisted that the manufacturer of the van-fog machines (fogging machines to kill mosquitoes) in Pune immediately deliver 30 machines the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had ordered early this year,? the mayor said. They should arrive by Saturday. 

 He asked the building department to slap stop-work notices on construction sites where builders allowed water to stagnate. 

 About Rs 50 lakh worth of mosquito repellent is gathering dust in the civic body?s central store. Civic officers said Rs 12 crore of tax payers? money is spent every year to run a vector control wing under the civic health department. There is an entomologist and more than 1,050 staff members. Besides 150 contractual workers, there are at least three vector control staff members in every ward.

 Over 200 fogging machines are lying with the vector control wing to spray the chemicals. About 47 of them have been lying out of order over the past six years.

 Officials said the abject failure of the civic health department stems from a turf tussle between the chief municipal health officer and the officer-on-special duty (health) who was engaged ad hoc by former mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

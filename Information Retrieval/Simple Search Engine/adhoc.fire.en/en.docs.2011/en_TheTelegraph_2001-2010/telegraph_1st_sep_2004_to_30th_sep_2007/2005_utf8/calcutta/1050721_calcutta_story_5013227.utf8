 ?As a goodwill gesture, the executive council has extended the softer option to Francis Fanthome to proceed on leave, which he has exercised?

 Francis Fanthome, chief executive and secretary of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which conducts the ICSE and ISC examinations, has been suspended from service. Fanthome is also a nominated member of the Lok Sabha.

 Neil O?Brien, chairman of the council, said the executive committee, by a resolution passed on July 16, had taken this decision. Fanthome would stand ?suspended pending the disposal of the inquiry? by Justice M.F. Saldanha, a retired judge of Karnataka High Court.

 ?As a goodwill gesture, the executive council has extended the softer option to Fanthome to proceed on leave, which he has exercised,? added O?Brien. Fanthome, who went on leave from Tuesday, was not available for comment. 

 The executive committee of the council had probed allegations of irregularities against Fanthome and prepared a report that is now under the scanner of Justice Saldanha. The former judge?s inquiry report is expected next month.

 Rita Wilson, deputy secretary of the council, will carry out the duties of the chief executive and secretary, ?till further notice?, said O?Brien.

 According to sources, the executive committee in its report had questioned the manner in which the council, under Fanthome, had granted affiliation to several schools. It had also pointed out that in the case of one school, affiliation had been granted even before it was launched and students had been admitted. Another school granted affiliation had only 11 students from classes I to V.

 Allegations that Fanthome had endorsed ?no less than 60 books? without seeking approval of the executive committee were also examined. The executive committee further noted that no prior permission had been sought by Fanthome for lectures he had delivered for a multinational software giant. The report concluded that ?certain actions of the chief executive and secretary do not have the agreement or the approval of the executive committee?.

 Sources said one of the reasons Fanthome was suspended was to ensure that ?the inquiry is both free and fair?.

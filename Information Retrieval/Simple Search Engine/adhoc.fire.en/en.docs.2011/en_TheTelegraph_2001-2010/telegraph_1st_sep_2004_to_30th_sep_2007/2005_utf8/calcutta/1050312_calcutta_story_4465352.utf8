 Lighting laws for show space

 Fenf Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui advises against the use of overhead 

lights that fall directly on someone as this showers a stream of powerful energy 

on the person

Q: I am doing up my showroom of sanitary 

fittings. Please advise me regarding the lighting of the interiors. 

Fardeen

The Solution: The showroom should be very well-illuminated, 

with the lights focused over the items on display. Most important is a well-lit 

entrance. Care should be taken to avoid overhead lights falling directly on any 

staff, or on your head in your personal chamber. Overhead lights send a powerful 

shower of energy streaming down on the person who is sitting or standing underneath. 

Even when the lights are switched off, the electrical circuitry subtly affects 

the energy movements in the area.

Q: I am a first-year college student 

pursuing science. I have this peculiar habit of keeping the radio on when I am 

falling asleep and even once I have fallen asleep. I have not been able to break 

this habit. What is the way out? My date of birth is 28.05.1984.

Prerna Agarwal 

The Solution: Since radio is your passion and 

you can not stay without it, the only way out to nullify the negative effects 

of its electro-magnetic field is by keeping a cluster of crystals near it. Crystals 

are known to absorb any kind of negativity.

Q: My date of birth is 02.01.60. 

My luck does not favour me in finance, business or my career. Please suggest ways 

to enhance my luck.

Ravi Agarwal

The Solution: South-east is the direction concerning 

money matters. It can be disastrous if this sector of the house is missing. In 

that case, you must enhance each and every south-east corner of the house, be 

it the drawing, dining, bedroom, study or kitchen. Introducing wood and water 

elements can be beneficial. This is best done by keeping fresh plants with a waterbody 

or by introducing a blend of green and blue in the furnishings, paintings or artefacts. 

Hide three silver coins wrapped in a red cloth or paper, tied with a red ribbon, 

in all the south-east corners of the house. Do not activate the negative areas 

like toilets, but you can keep these coins hidden deep down in the rice or flour 

containers in the kitchen. Career and business are best activated by keeping a 

waterbody, like an aquarium with eight gold and one black gold fish in the north 

of the living room or corridors. Keeping the picture of a cascading water fountain 

here will also do the trick. Care should be taken that the water does not flow 

towards the entrance door.

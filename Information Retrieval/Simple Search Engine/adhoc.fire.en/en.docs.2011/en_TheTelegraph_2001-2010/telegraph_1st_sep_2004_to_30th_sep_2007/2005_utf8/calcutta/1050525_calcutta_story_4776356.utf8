 Calcutta Column

 Calcutta and Howrah are considered twin cities. Yet, the 

 government pours in more money to develop Calcutta while 

 meting out a step-motherly treatment to Howrah. No wonder, 

 Calcutta is at least 30 years ahead of its twin, where the 

 roads are in bad shape and rickshaw-vans and trucks have 

 a free run paying no heed to traffic rules. Unauthorised 

 parking is another menace which eats up much road space. 

 During the monsoon, choked drains overflow to adjacent roads 

 and people are forced to wade through knee-deep water to 

 reach schools and offices. It is high time that the government 

 constitute a panel to look into the development of Howrah 

 and its adjoining areas.

 A few weeks back, while waiting for a Sealdah-bound train 

 at Habra station, I saw a few milkmen mix some white powder 

 with the milk and add a few litres of water to the solution. 

 This way, they had filled up the vessels to the brim. Then, 

 they dissolved handfuls of batasha in the milk, perhaps 

 to sweeten it. When an aged man walked up and asked why 

 they were adulterating the milk, they unashamedly cited 

 the profit motive. Regular sample checks by the authorities 

 will rein in the milk vendors? malpractice.

 Highrises, 20 to 25 storeys-high, are coming up in various 

 parts of the city. Many of them have deep tubewells to provide 

 continuous water supply. But will the underground water 

 table be able to sustain the load? Also, our fire personnel 

 are not equipped to tackle a fire in a highrise. The administration 

 should take into account all these factors before sanctioning 

 construction of multi-storeyed buildings.

 Prolonged power cuts have added to the misery of traders 

 and businessmen in the city. In our area, the power cuts 

 extend to about four to five hours at a stretch. This is 

 the first in many summers that we are facing such erratic 

 power supply. Low voltage also makes it difficult to operate 

 the water pumps, computers and and air-conditioners. The 

 CESC must implement remedial measures. 

 Rupchand Lohia, 

 Chowringhee Road. 

 Recently, an autorickshaw driver picked up a fight with 

 me early in the morning just because I tendered a Rs 10 

 note when the fare was Rs 3. The drivers should either carry 

 enough change or inform the passengers before the start 

 of the journey that he doesn?t have change.

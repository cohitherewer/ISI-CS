 Rocking to a new groove

 When most were rocking to retro, this gang made a subversive attack on Calcuttas musical sensibilities, forcing a rethink on rock roll. Cassinis Division, what fans refer to as a modern, alternative rock outfit, had the gall to force music lovers to sit up straight on their bar stools and then hit the floor, head-banging in tandem with a whole new sound.

 Rocking Someplace Else, the Mecca of live music in Calcutta, for over a month now, Cassinis Division has injected the music scene in the city with a freshness that was due for quite some time. The first outfit in the city to be playing alternative rock, the band already boasts a loyal fan following as can be witnessed at the witching hour on Saturdays at Someplace Else, when the party crowd troops into the pub to rock for real. The erstwhile sleepy Sunday evenings at the pub in The Park have also been woken up with a jolt when the band kicks in post 9 pm. 

 People are really enjoying the Cassinis Division sound at Someplace Else. They play a completely different genre of music from what other bands play at the pub, bringing in a breath of fresh air to our repertoire. Must say, our experiment to give Calcutta something extra on weekends is paying off handsomely, says Anirban Simlai, director food and beverages, The Park.

 The band regales with a wide variety of covers from modern rock bands like Creed, The Cure, The Calling, REM, Green Day, Lifehouse and more, but the USP lies in the huge list of original songs. Many of which like Caesar, Urban phenomenon, Only for a while, Shadowchase, Mr Mishra and Simba are regular requests.

 A lot of our own songs deal with the struggle to better oneself and overcome the hurdles we face as individuals as well as a society, says Rahul Guha Roy, singer, songwriter and guitarist of the band.

 Loneliness my friend/

 Emptiness my second skin/

 When will this be over/

 When will I get over this...

 The kind of stuff almost every second person in the audience can identify with. This shares sound space with adrenaline rushers like the one on lust for power and authority ? 

 Caesar had the power in his hand/

 Caesar had the military men and the tanks/

 But Brutus and the boys were busy conspiring/

 Talking to the contract killer theyll be hiring?

 Over the past four years, we have been able to mould a distinct, original style that combines elements of rock, industrial music and vocal extremes like deep throat growls with exquisite melodies that contrast both the beauty and the ugliness of the urban emotional landscape, adds Rahul. 

 The variety is palpable, given the wide-ranging musical influences of each member of the band. While Rahul traces his song-writing roots to grunge and hip-hop, influenced by groups like Nirvana, Pearl Jam and REM, Sukanti Roy, the other guitarist of the band, grew up listening to metal, John Bose, the bassist, moved from classic rock to groups like Radiohead, Staind, 3 Doors Down and Linkin Park, and Ludo (Ritoban Das), the drummer, is heavily into Afro-Latin percussion.

 Even though we come from different musical backgrounds, which of course overlap, we share a good chemistry that comes across as a unique Cassinis Division sound, says Ludo. 

 Among its memorable performances so far, the band recounts the concerts in Darjeeling and Kalimpong at the Darjeeling Carnival in November 2004, where the band rocked a 3,000-strong crowd, live. It was an amazing experience. Post the concerts, we realised there was no looking back. We chucked our day jobs and launched full time into music, reminisces John.

 At the moment, the band is shopping for a record deal but in the interim it continues to rock with new tricks up its sleeve. The element of rap ? the stuff that only the likes of Eminem, Jay Z and Arrested Development did on TV so far ? in Cassinis Divisions repertoire is a hit with Urban phenomenon being the most requested number. 

 Cassinis Division is going to rock Chennai next, where it plays in the JRO 2005 festival in July, south Indias biggest rock fest. With a view to inject the same flavour in Calcutta, Cassinis Division is also instrumental in trying to gang up with other young bands in the city to organise concerts on a regular basis. 

 This is important for a vibrant rock scene to develop and survive in a place like Calcutta. Talks are on with two other bands to work on a concert, probably on Independence Day, shares Sukanti. 

 The futuristic attitude is evident in the bands sci-fi artwork rendered by Sukanti that features on posters and the CD cover of the bands demo recording, Living in the loop. 

 The spirit has been manifest right from the baptism of Cassinis Division, which is named after the large gap in Saturns rings as viewed from Earth and ideologically translates into the mystery, enigma and illusion of it all.

 Beat bytes

 Celebrating the universal language of music that transcends geographical and cultural barriers, Kesivan Naidoo from South Africa drummed up a heady beat on World Music Day jamming with a plethora of musicians from this part of the world. The quartet, Talking Drums, formed especially for this hallowed day in a music lovers calendar captured a musical conversation between a drummer from South Africa and a tabla player from India and went on to tell many more tales.

 In Calcutta to study the tabla and the rhythms of Hindustani and Carnatic music under Rabindra Bharati University, Kesivan (picture by Rashbehari Das) is soaking in India and its culture. The jazz drummer from South Africa, of Indian origin, imbues the Calcutta music scene with his own influences in turn. 

 Talking Drums comprising Kesivan on drums, his tabla teacher Angshubha Banerjee, Ananda Sen on bass and Indraudh Bose on Indian classical violin is here to stay for the duration of Kesivans residency in India till 2007, during which time hell flit in and out of Cape Town.

 Indian musicians have a great sense of rhythm. I had played with Trilok Gurtu and Sivamani in Cape Town and was quite amazed at the level of their rhythmic knowledge, says Kesivan. He would like to play with Talking Drums as and when he gets the opportunity to do so. Back in his own country, he plays with a jazz quartet, Tribe, and has performed and toured with South Africas leading jazz musicians like Miriam Makeba, Bheki Mseleku and Zim Ngqawana.

 South Africa is experiencing a very dynamic and vibrant music culture at present, reveals Kesivan. Music is a big part of togetherness in my country. People are into new music and there is a lot of live and original music happening, he says.

 He lists Afro-jazz and Kewito (youthful and slow tempo house with South African lyrics and harmonic flavours) as the genres topping the list in the melting pot. The popular culture draws a lot from hip-hop and MTV stuff as well. Incidentally, Bollywood is gaining popularity too. On national TV there is one Bollywood flick every week, devoured by the likes of my mom, grins Kesivan.

 He, however rues the fact that Bollywood music is overshadowing other forms of Indian music. There is so much traditional music in India that is truly amazing, but something is holding back its full force and impact in the world. 

 The homogeneity is palpable in South African urban popular music as well. Its a very global culture with more orientation towards dance music and electronica, says Kesivan.

 The rural hinterland, though, still reverberates with a lot of traditional African sounds induced by instruments like mbra, djembe, base drums and khoisan bow as people sit around the fire, partying and telling stories?

 There is a huge vocal tradition as well and people dance and clap a lot, smiles Kesivan with a faraway look in his eyes.

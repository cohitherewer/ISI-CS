 A supreme sacrifice

 A tragic tale of love and sacrifice, Mohua Sundari rekindles in our hearts those finer sentiments and passions that have all but wasted away in an age of self-interest, self-seeking and gross materialism. This evening?s dance presentation of the love-story explores the nuances of human emotion and sensitivity with a maturity of expression rarely found in this genre of the performing arts. Based on a tale in the Mymensing Gitikabya, it tells the story of Mohua, a beautiful, young, gypsy girl, who would dance, sing and perform magic acts as part of a travelling circus. When Mohua and Nouda Thakur, the zamindar of a village where the troupe had gone to perform, fell in love, it was strictly opposed by the troupe leader, who wanted Mohua to marry his son. However, the two lovers secretly left the village and got married. When the couple was found, Nouda was captured and Mohua was ordered to kill her own husband. Seeing no way out, Mohua stabbed herself, after which her husband was killed by the troupe leader?s son. Choreography and direction: Sutapa Awon Pradhan.

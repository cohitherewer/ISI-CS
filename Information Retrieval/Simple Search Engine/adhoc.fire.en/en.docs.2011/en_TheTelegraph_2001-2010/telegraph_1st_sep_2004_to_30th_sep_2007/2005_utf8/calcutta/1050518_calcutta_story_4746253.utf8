The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scurry for bullets in civic ballot run-up 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Keeping pace with the build-up before the June 19 civic elections, the underground arms market in the city has been going through a boom.

 The market now abounds with all types of firearms ? branded as well as locally-made. There has been a steady supply of guns, rifles, SLRs, pistols and revolvers from Munger, Dasnagar, Mogra, Rishra, Konnagar, Titagarh, Belghoria, Jagaddal and Kankinara.

 In the city, the arms hubs are Tiljala, Tangra, Watgunge, Ekbalpore, Kidderpore, Rajabazar, Kalabagan, Tollygunge, Chetla and Sealdah. 

 Sources said firearms and explosives in the grey market were sold at 60 per cent higher than the normal prices.

 Mayoral council member (education) Moinul Haque Chowdhury was quite categorical: ?I am advising all my councillor friends in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to store aloo (improvised hand grenades, or peto) for the polls.? 

 Aslam and Chhanu, who are managing an ?armoury? in Ballygunge, anticipate a violent poll and vowed to fight the rivals ?bullet-for-bullet? at every booth.

 Chhanu regretted that like his rivals in Jorabagan, Tollygunge or Kasba, he could not procure sophisticated arms like SLRs and AK-47s because of paucity of funds. 

 An AK-47, he added, used to be sold at Rs 1.5 lakh three months ago. Now, the price stands at Rs 2.25 lakh.

 Aslam has ?come to know from his sources? that party-backed toughs like Sridhar, Manik (alias Welcome), Chhotka, Chunua, Mega, Dipu, Bhutan and Swadesh have already positioned themselves in their respective zones and are ready for D-day. 

 Chunua, an extortionist-cum-tough in east Calcutta who had gone underground in the aftermath of the Khadim?s owner abduction, is allegedly being reactivated by the CPM leadership in the Topsia-Tiljala belt. Chikna Raju and Swadesh Mondol, too, have been brought in from the Bantala leather complex area.

 At an election meeting in Mollapara, Topsia, on Sunday, local Left leaders had allegedly challenged the Opposition to match their muscle-power.

 Denying the charges, local MLA and CPM chief whip Rabin Deb said: ?All these are cock-and-bull stories. We have no link with the toughs. We have a mass base and will fight the election politically.?

 Deb?s claim notwithstanding, complaints of Opposition candidates and workers being roughed up are pouring in from Kasba, Rajabazar, Garden Reach, Kidderpore and Tollygunge. 

 Clashes over possession of walls for graffiti, too, are being reported from across the city.

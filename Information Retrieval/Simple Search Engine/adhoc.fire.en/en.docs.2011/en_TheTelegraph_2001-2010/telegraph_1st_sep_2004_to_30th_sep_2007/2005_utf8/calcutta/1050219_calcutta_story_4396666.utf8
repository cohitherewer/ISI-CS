 After being delayed for a year, the Park Street flyover will be opened to traffic on Saturday. 

 The Rs 57-crore flyover will be inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a function on the Maidan in the evening. 

 While the 795-m-long bridge is ready, officers said some work on the project is still pending. Repairs on a 300-m stretch of JL Nehru Road on either side of the bridge and below it is yet to start. 

 This will be undertaken over the next two months, possibly leading to traffic snarls at the intersection.

 ?Levelling of JL Nehru Road can be started only if the Park Street-JL Nehru intersection is closed to traffic. This is possible if all vehicles are made to ply on the new flyover. A roadblock will be installed here after the bridge is opened to vehicular traffic,? an officer associated with the project said on Friday. 

 The flyover, built by a Senbo-Skanska joint venture, is part of Package I of the Rs 400-crore Calcutta Transport Infrastructure Development Project funded by the Japan Bank of International Cooperation. Work on the originally 24-month project started on November 15, 2001.

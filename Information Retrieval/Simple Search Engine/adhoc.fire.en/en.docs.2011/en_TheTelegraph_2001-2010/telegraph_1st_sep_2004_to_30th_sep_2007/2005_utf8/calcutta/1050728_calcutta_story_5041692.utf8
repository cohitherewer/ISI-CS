 Screen magic, then and now: A still from 

Pather Panchali; (above) a brooding Bachchan in Sarkar 

The looting of passengers of Jagannath Express highlights 

how unsafe rail journeys have become, especially for those travelling in sleeper 

coaches (?Post- heist, train escorts?, July 2). 

 Those who take long-distance trains are either tourists or businessmen. Naturally, they carry money. The railway authorities urgently need to adopt protective measures for them. 

 All railway ministers assure during the presentation of the rail budget that steps will be taken to make journeys safer for passengers. But incidents of dacoity and robbery continue as usual. Words are not enough, sincere and vigorous effort is needed for positive results. 

 Bihar poses the greatest danger to rail passengers, but West Bengal, too, is no longer safe. 

 After the tickets are checked, the ticket examiners are not easily available. Policemen on duty march through compartments at night, but not at regular intervals. The long-distance trains need to be provided with adequate security personnel in the evening. The personnel also must be diligent in the discharge of duty. A policeman in plain clothes must be posted in each sleeper coach. 

 Ticket examiners must remain in the berth allotted to them most of the time and no hawker should be allowed to enter reserved compartments. The doors must be locked at night. If needed, electronic devices should be used to bolster security. 

 The driver and guard of the long-distance trains should be provided with mobile phones. The phone numbers should be mentioned in the reservation chart so that passengers carrying mobiles can get in touch in case of emergency. 

 Above all, the railway authorities should not forget that they are morally bound to protect the passengers and their belongings. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

 Apropos ?Howrah eviction sparks violence?, June 30, problems have again reared their ugly heads during the ousting of settlers. 

 Every time, the government conducts an eviction drive, politicians descend in droves to protect the evictees. In the process, they overlook the interests and rights of the community. 

 A law should be enacted to safeguard the interests of the state and keep opportunists eyeing political mileage at bay. Any move to jeopardise the interests of the state should attract penal action. 

 What is most ridiculous is that the squatters even hook electricity and are allowed to go scot-free by the politicians, who are to blame for shanties mushrooming all over the city. 

Subhankar Mukherjee,

Borehat, Burdwan. 

 Apropos the report ?Reaching Ray to the masses?, June 29, I would like to congratulate the four youths who formed Drishya to acquaint villagers with a different kind of real magic. Their endeavour to promote good cinema deserves kudos. The club has shown a way that others must follow. I hope the attempts of Drishya to bring about a change in the mindset of the common people meets with great success. Industrial houses should come forward in its support. 

Dalim Kumar Datta, 

APC Road. 

The effort being made by Drishya to screen classics 

for the common people is praiseworthy. Few villagers are even aware of films like 

Bicycle Thieves. Drishya?s initiative will not only provide villagers an 

alternative avenue of entertainment but will make them more culturally aware. 

Prasit Sen, 

Hatiara.

 I totally agree with the reviewer of Sarkar (?No myth, no magic, only factory finish?, July 5). The film fell short of the expectations fuelled by Ram Gopal Varma?s publicity machinery. Excessive publicity yet again had a negative impact. 

 I also feel that the film suffered due to the overconfidence of Varma, who perhaps felt that he cannot go wrong after Satya and Company. He unfortunately felt to failed to tap Amitabh Bachhan?s enormous potential. 

 The disappointment of the public with the film was evident from the movement of the share price of Sarkar?s production company, K Sera Sera Productions. Just before the first day first noon show, the price of a share of the company was around Rs 95. At the end of the show it came down below Rs 90. I sold my 400 shares at 12.30 pm that day, when the price had already come down to Rs 94.70. 

Govind Das Dujari,

Diamond Harbour Road.

Indian cinema has progressed in form and content. 

Ironically, the majority of the audience remain frogs in a well. Every time Amitabh 

Bachchan tries something different, they miss their He-Man who fights 50 people, 

bandages the mouths of crocodiles and hatches eggs. Subtlety be damned, the baritone 

cannot be missed! Hence, as Varma explores the histronical range of a 65-year-old 

with sagging skin, Bachchan fans who are proud to have sat through scenes of his 

chasing cocks, are very disturbed. Bachchan still means ?Rishte mein to baap?, 

?Sare zameene Hindustan?, and ?Mere paas Ma?. Harold Pinter in his 

plays uses a certain pause called Pinter Pause. Often no stage direction is given 

during such pauses. Used in the right manner, the Pinter Pause has the potential 

to heighten suspense and dramatises a situation more effectively than dialogues 

ever can. Unfortunately, the frogs in the well are insensitive to such tools. 

I fail to figure out, why, after adding such colour to Black, did the reviewer 

become mute to the finesse of Big B?s performance in Sarkar. 

Tathagata Chowdhury, 

Address not given. 

 It is a matter of delight that July 1, Bidhan Chandra Roy?s birthday, is celebrated as Doctors? Day. Few modern doctors are worthy of such honour. Most are blamed for failing to perform their duty. 

Ratan Kumar Halder,

Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Age no bar at age-old library?, July 4, the step taken by the National Library will please many young readers and their guardians. Not only will the membership count of the library be boosted, but school students would also get a chance to access reference books otherwise difficult to obtain. 

Sourish Misra,

Salt Lake.

 Apropos the report ?Rocky route to tech town?, July 18, I would like to point out that WTL is not the only profit-making enterprise in the Webel stable. Webel Mediatronics Limited, a hundred per cent subsidiary of Webel, has been consistently making profits for past several years and has no accumulated loss. 

C.S.D. Chakladar,

Assistant manager (P amp;A), Webel Mediatronics Limited.

Arya Mukherjee,

 Poila Baisakh has definitely lost out to New Year?s Day. The true-blue Bengali, however, is holding on tight to the community?s culture and traditions.

Joydeep Chatterjee, 

 Shyambazar

 Poila Baisakh still fascinates the Bengalis. Though we have become global citizens and follow the Gregorian calendar in our day-to-day lives, the day reminds us of who we are. Most Bengalis still spend Poila Baisakh in a special manner.

Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake

 All occasions are important in different ways. The modern life has become very fast and most people look forward to special days, be it New Year or Poila Baisakh. It?s apparent from the number of advertisements published in newspapers before the Bengali new year that Poila Baisakh has not lost out to New Year?s Day. The shops are stocked up and decorated, and restaurants introduce special menus before Poila Baisakh. For most Bengalis, Poila Baisakh is like a festival at home.

Nina Talukdar, 

 Gol Park

 Poila Baisakh is still a special day for traditional Bengalis. The community is cosmopolitan in nature and celebrates all festivals with equal zest. The day holds great significance for middle-class Bengalis.

T.R. Anand, 

 Budge Budge

 For most Bengalis, Poila Baisakh is as important as New Year?s Day. Regional celebrations cannot compete with international events, but that does not mean the Bengali new year day is losing its importance in the state.

Haralal Chakraborty, 

 Arabinda Nagar

 The educated upper middle-class Bengali follows the Gregorian calendar throughout the year and is not even aware of the Bengali year. But the common people in the city and the villagers follow the Bengali calendar. On Poila Baisakh, they visit temples and celebrate the day with various events.

Anjan Chatterjee,

 Graham Road

 Poila Baisakh has definitely lost its significance among Bengalis. The urban youth have become westernised. They don?t know much about gaajan and Chaitra sankranti but have all the information on Valentine?s Day. If Poila Baisakh is hyped by the media in the same manner as New Year?s Day, then the most important Bengali festival after the Pujas will regain its significance.

Soham Gupta,

 Anil Roy Road

 Great marketing has made New Year?s Day more popular than Poila Baisakh among Bengalis. New Year?s eve is all about partying and celebrations. On the other hand, how many people have got the time and energy to bargain for clothes at shops during the Chaitra sale, when they can get quality products at fixed price from big malls? Chaitra sales contributed a great deal to the festive spirit before the Bengali new year. Its loss of prominence is also responsible for Poila Baisakh?s declining popularity.

Sohini Roy,

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue 

 Poila Baisakh has not become insignificant for Bengalis. Though its celebrations have become muted, especially when compared with New Year?s Day, it retains its charm. The emotions associated with Poila Baisakh will never totally disappear. The culture and heritage of Bengalis is intrinsically linked with the day. The Bengali new year is celebrated in some form in the majority of Bengali homes and it will always be so.

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 Bengalis are very fond of art and culture, which is why artistes like VG Jog and V Balsara had made Calcutta their home. They not only celebrate their own festivals but also take part in the festivals of Sikhs, Christians and Muslims with equal enthusiasm. Therefore, Bengalis revel on both Poila Baisakh and New Year?s Day. Businessmen visit Kali temples to open their new books of accounts on Poila Baisakh.

Yashita Banerjee,

 Rashbehari Avenue

 No doubt, for most Bengalis, New Year?s Day is on January 1. But, they do care a little about Poila Baisakh, though the auspicious event is restricted to the Bengali business community. Surprisingly, even those who do celebrate Poila Baisakh greet you with Happy New Year?s Day instead of Shubha Nava Varsha.

Ahasan Jahir Molla,

 Mahestala

 Bengalis are in the habit of imitating others. Even a gift of hemlock from abroad is somras to them. Cakes have replaced pithas, miniskirts have taken the place of saris and dhutis are pass?. Similarly, January 1 has substituted Poila Baisakh in West Bengal.

Mehjibin Yunus,

 Bright Street

 Poila Baisakh has lost its significance these days. While some prefer New Year?s Day over Poila Baisakh, others don?t even know what it means. People should realise the importance of their own culture and festivals.

Prasit Sen,

 Hatiara

 Yes. Nowadays, Bengalis show more interest in celebrating New Year?s Day than Poila Baisakh. They go to restaurants, discotheques and movies on December 31, whereas they spend Poila Baisakh like any other day.

Sunil Banerjee,

 Hatiara

 Poila Baisakh has in no way lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis. The first day in the Bengali calender is auspicious to the members of the community and is observed in a befitting manner. The celebrations definitely outshine those on New Year?s Day.

MD. Ayub,

 Bright Street

 Poila Baisakh has lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis. The reason is that people of the state do not follow the Bengali calendar in their day to day lives, except to fix a marriage date or start a new business. Hence, it is not surprising that it is the business community which observes the day with fanfare.

R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Shyamnagar

 Yes, Poila Baisakh has lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis as most members of the community have become anglicised. They have forgotten their roots in the attempt to be cosmopolitan. Villagers, however, still look forward to the day. 

Ajit Kumar Das,

 Howrah

 I do not think that Poila Baisakh has lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis. The Bengali new year is celebrated with a great deal of enthusiasm even now. People buy new garments for the children and almost every businessman does the halkhata puja. The Bengali calendar is also widely distributed during the day, while publishers come out with new titles to celebrate the occasion. 

Kaberi Mukherjee,

 Santosh Roy Road

 Bengalis have always been very good at imitating the culture of others and forgetting their own. It is quite natural that they have made New Year?s Day more important than Poila Baisakh. For the few who do celebrate Poila Baisakh, it is an occasion to shop and eat, and nothing else.

Sitanshu Naskar,

 Howrah

 Bengalis being great imitators of the West, their culture is in danger of being lost forever. All the customs associated with Poila Baisakh are seldom observed now. In places and households trying to preserve the Bengali culture, Poila Baisakh celebrations have lost all colour. 

Babu,

 Serampore

 Poila Baisakh is losing its significance because Bengalis are becoming westernised. Our lives are governed by the Gregorian calendar, so it is natural that the Bengali new year is becoming unimportant. Very few young people know of all the months in the Bengali calendar.

ayan Mondal,

 Diamond Harbour

 Poila Baisakh is not losing its popularity among the Bengalis. We still buy new clothes and gifts to celebrate the day. Cultural programmes are organised in almost all localities on the eve of the Bengali new year. The Chaitra sale also reminds us of the Bengali new year.

Md. Tanweer,

 Gariahat

 No, not all. Bengalis love their language and culture very much. It?s true that the new generation of Bengalis is more attuned to the western culture, but even they do not ignore the Bengali culture totally. All is not lost, yet.

 Motivating mothers on baby feed

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 To remain in good shape, to beat the pressures of the workplace, or sometimes owing to plain negligence or ignorance, more and more women are depriving their little ones of breast milk.

 To drive in some not-so-well-known facts about the benefits of breast milk, the state government will start an awareness programme targeting all categories of women ? from rich, urban working women to those from poor, rural areas. 

 Calcutta will be the starting point, because the problem of breastfeeding is far more acute among urban working women.

 TV slots, radio jingles, posters and leaflets are being prepared to encourage and motivate mothers to breastfeed their little ones, and make them understand that human milk has anti-infective properties, unlike any other milk.

 The idea is to popularise the right kind of breastfeeding. If the campaign is successful, the government will prepare further plans to reach out to more working women through seminars and other awareness programmes, possibly with the help of non-government organisations.

 ?Urban families can financially afford to buy tinned or powdered milk for the baby, which poor families cannot. Moreover most urban working women join work a few months after delivery, leaving the child with the family or domestic help,? said state women and child welfare department secretary S.N. Haque.

 ?This is why most of the infants of urban working women are deprived of exclusive breastfeeding that is essential for the first six months.? 

 Since urban educated women, concerned about the way they look, often deprive their offspring of this natural milk, the government clarifies that breastfeeding, in fact, helps a mother shed extra weight gained during pregnancy.

 According to Haque, a host of misconceptions about breast-feeding is prevalent among women from all walks of life.

 One of them is centred around colostrum, the milk secreted for the first few days after childbirth. 

 ?Though it is the first immunisation a child receives from the mother and is highly nutritious and contains anti-infective substance, some consider it dirty and indigestible,? an official from the state women and child welfare department held.

 ?A difference in colour and consistency of this milk ? which is yellowish and sticky ? could be one of the possible reasons of such a misconception,? he added. 

 Some times, breastfeeding is delayed, though ideally it must be carried as soon as possible after birth.

 Late initiation deprives the child of valuable colostrum, which is why the newborn has to be fed glucose water, animal or powder milk.

 The Union department of women and child development?s Food and Nutrition Board, under the ministry of human resources development, has prepared National Guidelines on Infant and Young Child Feeding, from which the state government is taking the cue to popularise the right kind of breastfeeding. 

 A part of the awareness drive will be undertaken through 4,000 anganwadi centres in Calcutta (there are 54,000 such centres all over the state, funded both by the state and Central governments) where poor, expectant and lactating mothers and children up to six are offered free food, medical check-ups and immunisation. 

 ?The word will be spread from these centres,? Haque said.

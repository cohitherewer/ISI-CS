 At the Calcutta Book Fair. The 2005 edition will have a special IT park to vie with the titles on offer

 When you can?t battle it, befriend it. The book business and the Internet boom may, on paper, be at loggerheads, but the two shall coexist at the Calcutta Book Fair later this month.

 Riding the free market mantra ? and turning a blind eye to how the virtual word is blotting out the printed word internationally ? the Publishers and Booksellers Guild has rolled out a red carpet for the new-age knowledge economy to invade the 30th edition of the fair on the Maidan.

 ?It is true that new technology has affected the informative books market, but we think that this will not have any impact on creative literature,? argued Tridib Chatterjee, honorary general secretary of the guild.

 So, laptop and software, e-books and high-end gadgets in a 5,000 sq ft IT park will be vying with Rabindra Rachonabali and classics for their share of the visitor?s attention and purchasing power, between January 26 and February 5.

 More than 30 companies ? from hardware manufacturers to training institutes ? have confirmed their presence in the event. ?We are happy with the initiative and we congratulate the guild for taking this timely step,? said G. D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT.

 Explaining why such a space was earmarked for the IT industry, Chatterjee explained how the initiative could facilitate growth in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pet sector: ?The industry is on a growth run and estimates suggest a shortfall of IT professionals in Bengal by 2010. We are trying our bit to bridge the gap.?

 With special emphasis being given to the display of various software suitable for libraries, school education, latest hardware and training materials, the organisers are bullish about the impact of the endeavour. 

 The list of players ready to make their presence felt on the unlikely platform includes Xenitis Infotech and Samsung and training institutes like RICE, the Academy of Animation Arts and Technology, Brainware and Institute of Computer Accountants. ?We offer 2D animation courses and forums like Book Fair draw our target group,? says Deven Shah of the Academy of Animation Arts and Technology.

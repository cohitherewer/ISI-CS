 Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya

 Mayoral candidate, Left Front

 The municipal system is a local government and should function like one. There was a debate over whether we should adopt the Presidential form of government. But that decreases accountability. That is what B.R. Ambedkar had stressed in the constituent Assembly debate. The system gets office-bearers to sit in session before every decision taken. Therein lies the ingredients of democracy.

 Ajit panja

 Mayoral candidate, Trinamul Congress

 The mayor-in-council is a cabinet for the mayor. The modern system is all for decentralisation of power so that the benefits reach people easily. There are one crore people being serviced by the corporation and 50 lakh coming in daily. When I was health minister in Siddhartha Roy?s cabinet, I had to submit weekly reports to him. If the system is not working in other places, that does not mean that it should be done away with.

 Subrata Mukherjee

 Mayoral candidate, United Democratic Alliance

 The mayor-in-council is a useless system. The CPM had introduced this in 1985 to stop in-fighting in the party. The only consideration was providing powerful berths to some dissatisfied cadre. If I had the authority I would have scrapped this council. It leads to more wheeling-dealing than work. But it would require a government legislation. Three cities had the council. Mumbai has scrapped it. I do not know whether the system continues in Chennai.

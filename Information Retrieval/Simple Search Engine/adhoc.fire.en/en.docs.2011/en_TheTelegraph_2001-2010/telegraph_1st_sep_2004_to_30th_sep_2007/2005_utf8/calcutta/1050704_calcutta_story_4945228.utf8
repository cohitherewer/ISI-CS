 A guide from guide

 Dev Anand with Zeenat Aman

 The man born Devdutt Pishorimal Anand and still churning out films at age 83 has finally decided to chronicle his life and times. ?It has been such a long colourful journey full of activity,? says Dev Anand over phone from Mumbai. ?I was so young when I started out as a lead actor. I got my first break in 1945. Can you imagine how long the span is? I have had a great great life? he adds, a little bemused, in between editing his forthcoming release Mr Prime Minister. 

 The Guide star has scored a rap track for this film in Hindi and English and is excited about its prospects. ?I have written the lyrics too,? says Anand, having shot the song on location in Naples.

 A yen for acting brought Anand from Gurdaspur in Punjab to Mumbai, where he joined brother Chetan in the IPTA. After a few years of struggle, he got to debut in Prabhat Studio?s flop film Hum Ek Hain in 1947, which was followed up with some more hits and misses. Anand?s career took a dramatic turn in the early 1950s when he teamed up with Guru Dutt to produce Baazi, a thriller co-starring Geeta Bali. 

 So many faces and fond memories keep rushing back now when he sits to paint them in words. ?I am trying to capture a period through my autobiography ? the growth of India as a nation from my experiences as actor, director and writer. I am trying to sort the things that have struck me as important and those are really huge? It?s basically my reflections on life,? says Anand. From his Navketan days to friendship with Guru Dutt, relationship with brothers Chetan and Vijay to playing the urban lover boy on screen ? Anand promises to touch upon every nook and cranny in his career.

 Yet his readers will also look forward to titbits on the heroines he had launched and the ladies in his life. ?Oh yes, all the stars I have worked with will be there and also every milestone in my life,? he says. ?And lots of memories, like my marriage with Mona (Anand) on the sets of Taxi Driver at the dead of night? You will find it very nostalgic.?

 For a debonair like Anand, known for his penchant to do everything with a flourish, presenting his autobiography is equally important. ?I am looking at American and British publishers for my book. I am on the last scripts but I can write volumes. So the book has to be edited properly?,? says Anand, who wants his style and language to be retained.

 ?It is the style that matters. My narrative is like a screenplay. It will have lots of backward and forward movements,? he adds, wishing the book to be on the racks by the year-end.

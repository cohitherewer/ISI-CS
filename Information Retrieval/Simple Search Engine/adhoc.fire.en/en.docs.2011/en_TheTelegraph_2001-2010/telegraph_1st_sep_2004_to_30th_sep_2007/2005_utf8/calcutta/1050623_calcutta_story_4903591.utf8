 Mandarins juggle with numbers

 OUR BUREAU

 The day after its civic poll triumph in Calcutta, the CPM on Wednesday did two things ? it asked the captain-in-waiting to put his feet up and then set the ball rolling for team selection and strategy.

 Mayor-designate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya was told to confine himself to his Ramgarh home through the day to speed up recovery of his pothole-wounded leg. 

 In the evening, CPM leaders were closeted with their allies at the Alimuddin Street party headquarters, working out the numbers game and sketching a roadmap for effective running of the civic bodies in both Calcutta and Salt Lake.

 With Jyoti Basu, Biman Bose and Anil Biswas at the head of the table, the CPM unveiled plans of who would manage the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Bidhannagar Municipality for the next five years, and how.

 ?The discussions revolved around the quotas of representation in the mayor?s council in the CMC and the chairman?s team in Salt Lake,? said a party official.

 It is learnt that the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Forward Bloc and the Communist Party of India (CPI) have all staked individual claims to the posts of deputy mayor in Calcutta and vice-chairman in Salt Lake, in addition to ?heavyweight? portfolios.

 The RSP is believed to be riding its six-ward victory in 2005 ? against three in 2000 ?to make a pitch for the post of deputy mayor and also portfolios like markets and lighting.

 Hankering for health is the Forward Bloc, whose request for this CMC portfolio had been rejected in 1995.

 The new civic body in the CMC, under the leadership of Bhattacharya, must take oath before July 7, when the term of the outgoing body expires. 

 Though the date for oath-taking has not yet been finalised, sources in the Left Front pegged July 3 as a strong probability.

 Distribution of portfolios among the partners will be finalised on June 27, when the ruling Left Front meets. And the scramble could be for fewer seats this time.

 ?I have heard Bhattacharya wants a smaller council. We will take up the matter with him before finalising the size of the council,? said CPM state secretary Anil Biswas.

 Among the names doing the rounds for the CMC rolls are Nirmal Mukherjee, Swetabuddin Khondakar, Hena Chakraborty, Kanai Ganguly, Samar Roychowdhury, Karuna Sengupta, Tuhin Bera, Subodh De, Rupa Bagchi, Amal Mitra, Iqbal Hussain Gazi and Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

 In Salt Lake, the shortlist for chairperson includes Biswajiban Majumder, Ila Nandi and Tapan Talukdar.

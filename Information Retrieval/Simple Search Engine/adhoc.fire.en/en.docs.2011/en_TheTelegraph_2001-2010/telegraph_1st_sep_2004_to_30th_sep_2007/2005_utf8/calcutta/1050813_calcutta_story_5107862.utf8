 Alone, an island in the world

 Loneliness stalks even when one is in a group. And age is no bar to this state of mind, says Ishita Sanyal

 Ashim, an energetic young man of 26, burst out laughing in the office canteen. A sincere worker, he is tipped for a bright future. Yet beneath this outward sheen of a happy and happening life is a cloud of loneliness, gathering over the past few years. This is not just the longing for a partner; the loneliness is not accompanied by severe depression. Neither does he feel isolated as he always hangs around with a group. 

 This is the kind of loneliness that is making newspaper headlines on reaching extreme manifestations. 

 Most of us experience loneliness at some point in our lives. Traditionally, loneliness was considered just one aspect of a more encompassing psychological distress, such as depression or anxiety. 

 About a decade ago, loneliness began to be viewed as a unique phenomenon ? a problem in its own right. GeneratioNext ? social, extrovert and mixing freely in groups ? often suffers from pangs of loneliness, feeling all alone even when surrounded by friends and colleagues!

 Ashim?s troubles stem from both the personal and professional fronts. ?We may be friendly with many, but they do not really meet the expectations of a true friend.? 

 The late office hours also take take their toll on social life. ?After work, we do not have time to go out and meet friends and relatives, apart from on Sundays. We are all too busy to meet up.?

 Even in this crowded metropolis, where people are seen in groups, the problem of loneliness is looming large. Take Ritwik, all of 25. Recently the media reported that the youth took his own life and no one knows why. He was successful in his career and without a bother in the world. Even the day before the incident, Ritwik attended classes, chatted with friends in the evening. If he had any problems, he discussed them neither with his parents, nor with friends. 

 The rat race does not help either. It makes for a situation where self-centred peers flock together for a common interest, without any emotional attachment. And the phenomenon spreads vertically across all age groups. 

 Roshan, a nine-year-old from a reputed school of south Calcutta, has this to say ??We are all competitors in school. From the beginning, we are taught to want to be better than the others. That is what we try to do even when we play. We cannot think of our classmates as true friends.? 

 Some parents may have perpetrated this rivalry, but the result is disconcerting for all. Mamata, mother of a 12-year-old girl, says anxiously: ?There is a feeling of intense groupism in school among children. Though they play together, run together, chat together, the feeling of togetherness seems to be lacking in them.? Mamata feels this is probably why so many child guidance clinics have mushroomed. 

 Children today are under severe stress and become loners, being afraid to share their burden of worries with their parents; they dare not open up to friends in fear of rejection and abuse. 

 Ten-year-old Rumani told her mother that she feels very friendless in school. Her mother was surprised at the comment as Rumani received as many as eight New Year cards this year from her classmates. But Rumani says getting cards does not necessarily mean that the children were her ?true friends?. ?Giving a card on New Year?s day is a custom in our school. Those who gave me the cards expected lovely cards in return too,? she says bitterly.

 Today?s children may be more expressive and effusive, but the bonding does not happen. 

 This phenomenon flies in the face of the assumption that only adults and adolescents experience loneliness. The earlier reasoning was that loneliness could not be experienced until adolescence ? when more sophisticated cognitive abilities and greater friendship intimacy needs emerge.

 Children demonstrate that they do have well-developed notions of loneliness. In fact, children as young as three, have shown they too feel the pain of social isolation. The manifestation may be different than in adolescents and adults, but the basic experience is the same. In a more recent study by Ladd, Kochenderfer and Coleman, loneliness of kindergarten children in school was measured with a series of questions ? ?Are you lonely in school?

 Is school a lonely place for you?

 Are you sad and alone in school??

 These studies suggest that young children?s concepts of loneliness have meaning to them and are similar to those shared by older children and adults. Loneliness is a significant problem that can predispose young children to immediate and long-term negative consequences. They often feel excluded ?-a feeling that can be damaging to their self-esteem. In addition, they may experience boredom and alienation. 

 Early childhood experiences that contribute to loneliness may predict loneliness in adult life. Loneliness haunts a person in a very particular way when they?re young. It comes turbo-charged with a restlessness that can beat them up like the playground bully, especially on a Friday or a Saturday night when it seems like the whole world is doing something exciting and they have been left out. 

 What exactly is the meaning of loneliness in today?s world? It is a realisation that, at some level, there will always be a distance between yourself and others. You feel it in those silent areas that exist between your and your spouse, your family members, your friends and your community. There are always things that can?t be spoken, can?t be understood, can?t be harmonised, even in your most intimate relationships. This is the loneliness you feel when you drive away from a family gathering, finish that long talk with your spouse or try to explain something to your own child. At those moments you can feel like a minority of one ? alone morally with most of what?s deepest in you.

 Often we make suggestions for individuals, manufacturing lists of tasks to do or attitudes to manifest, hoping to divert the attention of the lonely person from himself. But these suggestions often tend to add to the stress.

 Many may become overwhelmed because they are powerless to do the suggested tasks. Loneliness is compounded by guilt for not ?getting over their feelings and moving on with life?. We are each prone to loneliness, and often we eventually emerge on our own from this overwhelming state. At other times, we need help. The hardest thing to do is identify how we ourself contribute to our loneliness. 

 Here?s a tip on how to start off. Ask yourself: ?What things do I do that keep loneliness in my life??

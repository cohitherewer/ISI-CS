 Shagun, the wedding mall on Shakespeare Sarani, unveiled its Puja collection with a fashion show on Friday afternoon.

 The mall, specialising in bridal outfits, jewellery and other wedding accessories, launched a collection of festive wear for both women and men.

 Durga puja is a time when people buy high-end clothes and jewellery. Besides clothes, people will have access to all kinds of accessories at our mall, says Rajiv Kumar Kanodia, director, Shagun.

 From lehngas to dhoti-kurta, from ornate colours to heavy embroidery, the models walked the ramp flaunting the lavish designs. Bright colours and heavy embroidery are in this season, adds Kanodia.

 The saris are classified into two segments ? formal and party wear. The formal wear comes in subdued colours, while the party pieces are in more vibrant splashes. Heavy embroidery and embellishments are a constant feature in both the ranges.

 For men, there is traditional wear with elaborate kantha work and embellishments as well as formal western clothes.

 If you are out shopping for the coming festive season and want to sport an ethnic look, Gharoya boutique at 1/57B, Dover Place could be your destination on September 2 and 3.

 A two-day exhibition at designer Jayeeta Mukherjees studio offers an extensive range of saris, salwar suits, lungi and top sets.

 These are adorned by hand-paint, Kutch work, block print, mirror work, kantha stitch, batik and different kinds of hand and machine embroidery.

 The fabrics used are mostly silks and cottons.

 This time I have innovated a lot with the colour combinations. The palette is mostly bright, but with very unusual combinations. The lungi and top sets also make for great casual wear, says the designer who plans to host another exhibition at her residence on September 9 and 10.

 The range is priced between Rs 350 and Rs 3,500.

 Shes been a cameo queen, a ramp hot bod, a favourite ad face and a television anchor. And now, well see Babuji girl Yana Gupta in a whole new avatar ? that of matchmaker, and quite literally.

 The peaches-and-cream beauty will don the role for a mega matchmaking contest titled Lee ? The Perfect Fit.

 Hosted by the denim major, the interactive contest will invite participation from young men and women from across the country and Yana will help them find the perfect fit for each other.

 To participate, one has to answer a set of multiple-choice questions that will be asked by Yana on Zee Trendz, Zee Caf? and Zee Studio over the next three weeks.

 One can participate by SMS-ing the answers to 7575. The questions, to be aired from Tuesday evening, will be based on topics including personality and romance.

 The contest is an extension of our brand motto ? the perfect fit. The phrase not only speaks about the perfect fit of a pair of jeans, it also talks about Lee fitting into your lifestyle. What could have been a better continuation of the concept than dating ? that of finding a perfect-fit partner for yourself, explains Chakor Jain, business head, Lee.

 He adds: Based on the answers to the questions, Yana will look at the compatibility quotient of absolute strangers and find a Perfect Fit winning couple.

 The two chosen ones will be flown down to Mumbai to join Yana for dinner at a star hotel and will be showered with a complete Lee wardrobe worth Rs 20,000 each, apart from other prizes like the Lee Supermodel calendar. They will also get free membership to Lee Club, which will train them on dress sense, etiquette, etc.

 Apart from the final winners, five couples will be selected every week for three weeks and they will also be given Lee wardrobe worth Rs 10,000 each in addition to the Lee Club membership and the calendar. A random selection through a draw will decide 30 other lucky winners.

 The contest will also be promoted through radio channels and some on-ground activities at colleges, malls and multiplexes in different cities.

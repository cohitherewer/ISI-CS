 Wanted: Godown to stock diplomas

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 For the first time in its 150-year history, Calcutta University (CU) is having to scout for a spacious godown to store diplomas that most of its affiliated colleges have never bothered to collect.

 Such is the urgency that CU is even planning to advertise in newspapers, seeking space to stock the course-completion certificates.

 For several years, CU had been facing criticism from its students, especially those targeting higher studies abroad, for the huge backlog in issuing diplomas.

 To address the problem, CU abolished the century-old system of giving hand-written diplomas and introduced computerised certificates. This also saved it the trouble of employing specially-trained staff to write on the diplomas. 

 ?Through a number of measures, we have regularised the processing and issuing of diplomas. Strangely, most of the 150-odd affiliated colleges are least interested in collecting these documents from our diploma section,? said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, controller of examinations, CU.

 A huge number of the 100,000-plus diplomas prepared in a year are now piling up with the university. ?We are at a loss. We don?t know where to keep so many diplomas. A separate godown will be required soon if the documents keep on accumulating year after year,? Adhikari added.

 The bulk of the diplomas, more than 70,000 a year, are of students who pass the BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations.

 The colleges concerned are approaching CU only when their students are demanding the certificates to gain entry into universities abroad. The pass diploma, along with the marksheet, is a must during admission to most foreign educational institutions.

 Post-regularisation, CU has been able to clear the backlog till 2003. It is now aiming at issuing the diplomas along with marksheets to the students from 2006. 

 But that, officials say, will be possible only when the old diplomas are collected by the respective colleges.

 After the Puja vacation, the university is planning to despatch a directive to all its affiliated colleges, asking them to collect the certificates of their students at the earliest. 

 The colleges will also be told to contact their former students who have not collected their certificates. The colleges will also have to make arrangements to store the documents on their campus till the students collect them.

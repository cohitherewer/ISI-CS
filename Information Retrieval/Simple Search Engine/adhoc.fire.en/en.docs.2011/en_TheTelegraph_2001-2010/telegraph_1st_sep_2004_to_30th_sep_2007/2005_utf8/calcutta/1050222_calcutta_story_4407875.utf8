 Confessions 2, hours 7

 - Roma Jhawar kidnap accused record statements in court

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gunjan Ghosh and three accomplices in the Roma Jhawar abduction case ? Ram Chandra Singh, Guddu Yadav, alias Dinesh, and Munna Sau ? were brought to the Bidhannagar court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Alok Kumar Choudhury on Monday. 

 They were to record their confidential confessional statements. However, after almost seven hours, the magistrate could record only two statements.

 The four were taken to the court in Mayukh Bhavan under heavy police cover, and produced before judicial magistrate Bipasha Mondal in turns. 

 The first in queue was Ram Chandra, who went into Mondal?s room at 12.30 pm, and left one-and-a-half hours later. Around 2.10 pm, principal accused Gunjan was taken inside. He emerged again at 5.35 pm, looking exhausted. 

 Guddu was summoned next, and made his confession till about 6.30 pm. He could not complete his statement, since the judicial time of the court ends at 4.30 pm, and the magistrate was convinced that Guddu would require more than the two extra hours he was given.

 Guddu and Munna will be taken to Mayukh Bhavan again on Tuesday to complete their confessional statements.

 While Ram Chandra was narrating his story to the magistrate, Gunjan, who was limping, was escorted to the court lock-up. 

 His wife Rumela, having braved disapproving parents at home, had come to the court by herself to catch a glimpse of her husband. 

 Before Gunjan was taken into the magistrate?s chamber, he was allowed to speak to Rumela for a moment, and then whisked away to the magistrate?s room.

 Surrounded by policemen, both in uniform and in plainclothes, Gunjan raised his head and told his wife: ?Take care of yourself and go home.?

 After the day?s proceedings, public prosecutor Anjan Chowdhury said: ?The statement will be sent to SDJM Aloke Chowdhury in a sealed envelope and we can only know about the confession during Gunjan?s next production on March 4.?

 The magistrate will also send a copy of the recorded confession of the quartet to the CID officials on Tuesday.

 Outside the court, Rumela reiterated her statement that Gunjan and Roma knew each other. ?My husband had many girlfriends and I never minded his relations with them, as I had complete faith in him. But the way the entire thing happened is still a mystery,? she said. Gunjan?s lawyer Kabir Biswas claimed that his client had been framed.

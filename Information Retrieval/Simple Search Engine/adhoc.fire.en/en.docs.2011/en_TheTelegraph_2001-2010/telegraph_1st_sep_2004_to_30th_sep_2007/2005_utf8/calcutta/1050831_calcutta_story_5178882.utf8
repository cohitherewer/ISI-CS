 Tales retold on telly

 A moment from the TV adaptation of Premendra Mitra?s Basanta Bahar

 The shades of a man-woman relationship ? sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet ? have seldom come out better than through the pens of some Bengali writers.

 On the birth anniversary of four such authors in the month of September, Akash Bangla pays tribute with four six-episode serials on the works of Premendra Mitra, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, Bimal Kar and Subodh Ghosh. The serials will be aired on the channel?s Sahityer Shera Shomoy slot.

 The literary bonanza kicks off with Premendra Mitra?s Basanta Bahar on September 5. To be directed by Joy Mukherjee, Basanta Bahar features Koushik Sen, Chandrayee Ghosh, Bhaskar Banerjee and Maitreyee. ?This is a story with a twist, unfolding in a decadent royal family of the 1950-60s,? says Mukherjee.

 Next up is Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay?s Sati, to mark the author?s birth anniversary on September 15. The tale of husband-wife and the other woman features Kunal Mitra and Chaiti Ghosal, under Manish Ghosh?s direction. ?Most of Sarat Chandra?s popular works have already been shown on TV. Sati is a little-known text and so we chose it,? says the director, who feels the man-woman relationship in Sarat Chandra?s works remains relevant to this day. Sati will be telecast from September 12 to 17.

 September 19 to 24 will be devoted to Bimal Kar?s Basanta Bilap, made famous by the screen romance of Soumitra Chatterjee and Aparna Sen. The rivalry between a bunch of young men and women comes back under John?s direction, with Gargi Roy Chowdhury and Bhaskar Banerjee in the lead. ?I wanted to bring in some relief between the serious literary works with this fun story,? says John.

 The last in the tribute series is Subodh Ghosh?s Duhshahodharmini, starring Pijush Ganguly and Mallika Mukherjee. The tale of a shrewd and unscrupulous husband who tries to use his wife to his advantage is being directed by Susanta Basu. It will be aired between September 26 and October 1.

 The popularity of its telefilms has prompted Akash Bangla to re-telecast some of the works.

Antaraley, starring Shankar Chakraborty and Arpita Dutta Chakraborty and directed by Anindya Sarkar, will be beamed on October 2.

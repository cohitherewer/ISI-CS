The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Help desk at hand to fill out forms 

 Sulekha Chaudhury: Why are the people at the inquiry counter of the regional passport office so ill-mannered?

 I don?t agree with you. However, it is fact that people at the inquiry counter are over-burdened.

 I have a plan to start a help desk manned by young men and women, who will be trained for the job. Retired armymen and NGOs could also help people fill passport application forms.

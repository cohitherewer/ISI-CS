 Krishnakali in New Alipore is the latest addition to the citys boutique brigade. The 1,500-sq-ft Indian ethnicwear and Indo-western outfits outlet made its presence felt to Calcuttas fashion conscious crowd through a show in the shop premises recently. 

 The event was to celebrate the spirit of womanhood and the tools for this were found in the six yards of magic. A woman dresses not just to suit the occasion but also her mood. The styles of draping the sari and the designs range from demure to wacky, said Sarita Chaudhary of the boutique. 

 Models flaunted various styles on the makeshift ramp that included everything from koorgi to churidar and the popular Mumtaz style made famous by the cinestar. 

 Using the usual fabrics ? cotton, crepe and georgette among others ? the saris have been embellished with sequins and intricate embroidery.

 Early lounge

 If you find just lounging around a tad boring, chill better with a jam session to boot. The practice, that was a rage in the 90s, is back and how. 

 Prince of Cal, the lounge at Souravs, has started a fun lounge on the lines of a jam session. We have registered a staggering sale of beer and Breezers during the last two Saturdays, since it all started, said Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO of Souravs. The action at Prince of Cal takes place between 3 pm and 6 pm every Saturday.

 The fun is spilling over to other night spots. Post a shopping spree at Forum, one can unwind at a jam session in Starstruck, the restaurant and lounge in the mall, on Saturdays from 4 pm to 8 pm. 

 We started off with the concept of jam session at Winning Streak in the mid-90s. The first jam session was attended by 10 people and thereafter it became a rage, reminisced Bunty Sethi of Starstruck who used to own Winning Streak. 

 We are targeting the college crowd who are often not allowed late nights. The music played here is totally commercial, added Sethi. 

 Silk smooth

 Did you know the more you wash muga silk the brighter it shines? This unique silk, only found in Assam, has many such interesting features.

 Sampa Das, a Bengali married to an Assamese, has taken it upon herself to champion the cause of the silks and weaves of Assam, retailing from Sampas Boutique on 42 Circus Avenue. 

 With the help of a number of trained workers, Sampa has been weaving yards of muga and other silk saris, and mekhla chadars (two-piece saris) in an array of colours, prints, styles and designs.

 Muga silkworms produce a golden thread that is sought after for its colour and sheen. Legend has it that at one time muga was worn only by royalty, and commoners made do with silk, shared Sampa. Though the Japanese tried to grow muga, they failed and Assam remains the only place where it can be grown.

 According to Sampa, there is only one gharana in Sualkuchi village near Guwahati that can create authentic and intricate work directly from the loom. It was after several trips to such tiny villages across the state that I managed to set up what is today the only place in Calcutta that deals with authentic Assamese muga work, she claimed.

 Though muga looks like gold silk and appears suitable only for winter wear, it has several thermal qualities that make it comfortable to drape during summer months as well, explained Sampa.

 She is slated to exhibit her wares in the Banga Sanskriti Sammelan in Manhattan next month and the Banga Mela in Chicago thereafter.

 The designs are either woven or embroidered and inspired by nature, combined with ethnic geometric tribal motifs of the Northeast. The colour palette is as extensive.

 Pure muga silk saris are priced between Rs 8,000 and Rs 15,000, while cotton saris, kurtas and mekhla chadars start at Rs 1,600.

 Confess cafe

 Esha Deol and Shahid Kapur with Karan Johar

 Till date, you have only heard Kareena do all the talking about the much-seen and much-shared liplock with Shahid. Now, on this Friday?s Koffee With Karan, you can catch Shahid get candid about the mobile video that made it to the front page of many a newspaper.

 ?The whole kissing episode did affect us emotionally. It completely shook Bebo and me. It is, without doubt, the most dramatic experience of our lives. However, the good part is that it brought the two of us closer. We were both looking for support from each other,? says Shahid on one of the more open addas on the small screen.

 The other guest on this week?s show is Esha Deol, who?s gone all Dhoom ever since Sunidhi Chauhan strained her vocal chords for Pritam?s composition. ?If my mom has to choose someone for me from the industry, it would be Vivek Oberoi,? says Esha in one of the most honest confessions on Karan?s hour-long show.

 The rapid-fire session gets even more interesting with both Esha and Shahid stumping Karan with their bold replies in the true spirit of the round. Get the real replies on everything from what makes Shahid turn off to which body part of hers Esha would like to change. 

 Also check out the survey which finds out whether Shahid and Kareena make a great couple and what kind of a man should Esha date. Friday, STAR World, 10 pm.

 All about the adorable labrador

 Labrador Retrievers 

 are kind and friendly, but require training. (Reuters)

 An extended puppyhood 

 and a playful nature are Labrador traits. (Reuters) 

 I look forward to my daily evening 

 walks around the block in Golf Garden. It?s got little to 

 do with fitness and more to do with meeting Phoni Bhushan 

 Bandopadhyay and Boomer Bandopadhyay, the two Labrador Retrievers 

 owned by the Banerjis in the next building. Phoni (three 

 years old) gets all jumpy and excited to see me, while his 

 father Boomer, (seven-and-a-half years old) is more dignified 

 and aristocratic when he greets me. I have concluded that 

 ?adorable? is an adjective coined for Labrador Retrievers! 

 HISTORY: The Labrador Retriever 

 must be from Labrador, right? No, contrary to its name, 

 the Labrador Retriever originated in the Canadian province 

 of Newfoundland, where they were used as hunting dogs who 

 retrieved ducks from the water, shot down, and helped fishermen 

 haul in nets filled with fish.

 CHARACTERISTICS: The most 

 distinguishing characteristics are its short, dense, weather 

 resistant coat; an ?Otter? tail; a clean-cut head with broad 

 back skull; powerful jaws; kind, friendly eyes; expressive 

 character; intelligence, and a good temperament to be a 

 family companion. 

 TEMPERAMENT: They mature 

 slowly, so you will have to deal with an extended puppyhood. 

 Their disposition is of a kindly, outgoing nature, eager 

 to please and non-aggressive. But they are infamous for 

 getting into mischief and are consummate retrievers, so 

 be prepared for them to carry off your things unless you 

 train them otherwise. 

 DIET AND EXERCISE: Labrador 

 Retrievers (females in particular) are prone to obesity 

 and enjoy their food a little too much! Ask your vet for 

 the best strategy for your Lab and follow the exact amounts. 

 They need exercise every day ? jogging, fetching and long 

 walks ? to be mentally and physically happy. Otherwise they 

 become bored, which they usually express by becoming destructive.

 GROOMING: Labradors are 

 easy to groom. With their short easy-care coat, a quick 

 towel-dry is all that?s needed after a bath! But for such 

 a short-haired dog, they shed more than you might think. 

 Their hairs come off on your hands when you pet them, and 

 stick to clothing, upholstery and carpeting. Be prepared 

 for vacuuming. Body odour is another area you may want to 

 look into. 

 HEALTH: Labs are prone 

 to orthopaedic and other genetic conditions. It?s imperative 

 you get your pup from a certified, professional breeder 

 or from the kennel club. Research carefully before purchasing 

 your Lab so that you avoid a dog with a genetic predisposition 

 for health conditions.

 TRAINING AND SOCIALISATION: 

 Their intelligence (they rate among the top 10 breeds) 

 makes them relatively easy to train. Use training methods 

 that incorporate positive reinforcement. These methods are 

 more fun for you and your dog, and more effective. They 

 are often used as guide dogs for the blind, service dogs 

 for the disabled, therapy dogs and search-and-rescue dogs.

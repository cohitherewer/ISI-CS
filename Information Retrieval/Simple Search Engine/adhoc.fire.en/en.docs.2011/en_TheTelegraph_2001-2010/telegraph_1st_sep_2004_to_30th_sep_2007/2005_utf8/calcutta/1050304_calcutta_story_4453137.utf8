The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Lift an evergreen song and weave a story around it. 

Thats the jukebox musical, which is fast gaining favour in the West. After 

experimenting with Beach Boys, Broadway producers are keen to cash in on the hummable 

tracks of one and all, from John Lennon to Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen, 

says Jesse McKinley

 Actors rehearse for the Broadway musical 

Good Vibrations

No one knows for sure what Brian Wilson and the Beach 

Boys were thinking when they wrote Car crazy Cutie, but it?s hard to imagine 

they thought they were writing a heartfelt reconciliation song. Yet, sure enough, 

halfway through the first act of Good Vibrations, the new Beach Boys musical 

at the Eugene O?Neill Theater, it is Car crazy Cutie that is sung by a 

guy trying to woo back his girl.

That seeming disconnect was just one of the many problems 

that critics found with Good Vibrations, which opened to a bundle of bad 

reviews on February 2. But it highlights the challenges faced by writers of so-called 

catalogue, or jukebox, musicals, an increasingly popular form of show in which 

a new story is woven around existing hit songs. 

In addition to the Beach Boys, the music of two other 

musical icons is being mined for shows that are expected on Broadway this year: 

Elvis Presley, whose music is featured in All Shook Up, which began previews 

last week at the Palace Theater, and John Lennon, whose songs form the spine of 

the biographical musical Lennon, due at the Broadhurst Theater in July. 

Jersey Boys, the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons 

musical, is also considered a possibility for Broadway this year. Several others, 

including one based on the music of Bob Dylan and another on Bruce Springsteen?s 

songs, are in the works. 

The rise of the jukebox musical comes at a time when 

Broadway producers seem increasingly unable to consistently strike gold with either 

overtly campy new work (Taboo, Bombay Dreams), high-minded, chamber-opera 

fare (Caroline, or Change) or movie-inspired shows (Never Gonna 

Dance, Footloose). Add to that the near-complete inability of contemporary 

Broadway songs to crack the Top 40 list, and the appeal of the jukebox musical 

becomes even more apparent: here, it seems, is a pre-packaged score guaranteed 

to be hummable and requiring no expensive stars. 

 Elvis Presley: Top draw

The most successful example of this breed, of course, 

is Mamma Mia!, the global sing-along to an inventory of hits by the Swedish 

group Abba, which has grossed more than $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide. 

The show, devised by the British producer Judy Craymer, opened in London in the 

summer of 1999, transferred to Broadway in 2001 and currently has 14 productions 

around the world in seven different languages. 

But even Craymer admits there is a certain madness 

in the method of making catalogue shows. ?It?s really doing things upside down. 

Usually you write the story first and then the songs are inspired by the story,? 

she explained. ?This is a whole different way of doing things.?

And it?s not always successful. While Mamma Mia! 

and Movin? Out, the Billy Joel-Twyla Tharp collaboration, are Broadway 

hits, in London, where the form is even more popular, a series of high-profile 

catalogue shows have flopped, including efforts by groups like the Pet Shop Boys 

and Madness. We Will Rock You, a catalogue show based on the music of Queen, 

did moderately well, but avoided transferring to Broadway.

In the case of Good Vibrations, the producers 

said they found the process of making a storyline out of hundreds of Beach Boys 

songs much harder than they had expected. ?We first thought about doing a revue 

type of thing,? said Nina Keneally, the show?s lead producer. ?But then we thought 

if we could craft a story around the songs, we could take the music to a whole 

other level. But, of course, easier said than done.?

In particular, the problem for Good Vibrations, 

and other jukebox shows, is that the song lyrics cannot be altered to fit the 

sentiments of the characters who sing them. So in many places, Keneally?s creative 

team ? including the director John Carrafa ? was forced to rely on staging that 

had to substitute for some of the lyrics, which were themselves trimmed to make 

the songs jibe more closely with the plot. 

Even so, some of the Beach Boys? most famous songs, 

including Little Deuce Coupe, simply could not be wedged into the story. 

?You can?t lyrically try to make everything fit,? Keneally said, ?because that?s 

a road to bedlam.?

Instead, she said, the idea was to use the songs as 

?tent poles?, between which the plot could be threaded. But that story ? boy meets 

girl, goes to California, loses girl, surfs, gets girl back ? did little to thrill 

critics. Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called the show ?a 

lumbering, brainless Frankenstein?s monster?.

Hoping to avoid such reviews, the creators of All 

Shook Up, the Elvis catalogue show, have turned to an impeccable source: Shakespeare. 

The musical?s director, Christopher Ashley, said he had combed through an estimated 

800 songs in the Elvis catalogue ? written by numerous composers, including Jerry 

Leiber and Mike Stoller ? before deciding to write a 1950?s love story ?poured 

through the funnel of a Shakespearean comedy?. 

Ashley said that the sheer size and variety of the 

Elvis catalogue had made it relatively easy to find songs to fit that plot, which 

he says borrows elements from both Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night?s 

Dream. 

The use of Shakespeare, of course, is not going to 

appease many traditionalists who feel that the jukebox musical is a corruption 

of the classic method of making new musicals, where composer, lyricist and book 

writer work in tandem ? and in real time. 

 John Lennon: Life story

?A musical is supposed to be a collaboration,? said 

Arthur Laurents, who wrote the books for Gypsy and West Side Story. 

?You don?t have a finished score and then work up a script to push it around. 

It?s not to my taste, and I think it?s hurting the musical theatre.? 

It?s not surprising, then, that many of the creators 

associated with catalogue shows are loath to be lumped in the jukebox category. 

?We are not one of those catalogue shows,? said Don Scardino, the director of 

Lennon. ?The songs are designed to be sung in the context that they were 

written. They are not divorced from their context.? 

Scardino said that unlike, say, Good Vibrations, 

which never mentions the Beach Boys, Lennon tells the story of John Lennon?s 

life, from his Liverpool childhood to his Beatle days to his murder in 1980.

?It?s all basically John?s words,? Scardino said. 

?It?s John Lennon telling his story and singing his songs.? That said, Scardino 

emphasised that he did not want to do a show with a Lennon impersonator; instead, 

he is using a nine-member ensemble of male and female actors who take turns playing 

Lennon. 

?We?re singing the songs as John, emotionally, from 

his point of view,? he said.

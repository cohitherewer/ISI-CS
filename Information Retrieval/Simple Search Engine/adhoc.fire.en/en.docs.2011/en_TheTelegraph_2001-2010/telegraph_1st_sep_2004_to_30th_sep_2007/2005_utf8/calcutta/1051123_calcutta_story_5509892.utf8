The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two arrested for bank loan fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 One of them was a smooth talker and she sought house-building loans against a property that was actually a pond in the interiors of Halisahar, in North 24-Parganas. 

 The other would approach prospective clients with the promise of offering them loans unlimited and then forge their signatures to withdraw money, amounting to lakhs. 

 Till cops from Ballygunge managed to bust the two rackets ? a rare achievement by a police station in handling white-collar crime.

 Seven persons have been arrested till date in these two parallel cases and a massive hunt has been launched to net others involved in the rackets. 

 Curiously, in both these instances, the accused had threatened police through SMSs, asking them to desist from probing the cases. 

 ?In both the cases, a large number of people are involved and they are still eluding the police net. These people would plan the operations and engage other members to execute them. Both these cases are instances of smart people involved in bank frauds,? said an officer of Ballygunge police station. 

 In the first case, attractive Mita Sarkar, in her late 30s, would go around looking for home loans. On November 11, she turned up at a private bank on Sarat Bose Road, seeking a loan of Rs 5 lakh and produced documents of a plot in support of her collateral security. She needed the money to buy a plot at Madrial, in Halisahar, from Sailen Banerjee, who lived there. 

 On the face of it, there seemed nothing wrong with her application and the bank agreed to pay the amount. 

 On November 18, when the land registration was to take place, bank officers gave her the cheque and then realised their mistake.

 Soon after, the officers realised the land that the woman had shown as her collateral security was just a pond. 

 ?On the basis of the complaint, we spotted her the next day as she was about to enter the bank from where she had taken the loan. After arresting her, we arrested Banerjee, who was waiting on the other side of the road, watching her movements,? said an officer. 

 A few days later, the third gang member, Pabitra Sadhukhan, who had threatened an officer on his mobile phone, was arrested.

 The second relates to a personal loan fraud. A group of youths would go around promising people they would secure personal loans for them. All that the clients had to do was to produce photocopies of all the relevant documents, including PAN and other returns and four blank cheques, without the signature. 

 Later, they would copy the signature ? that clients would have to put on the photocopies of their documents ? and withdraw amount in lakhs.

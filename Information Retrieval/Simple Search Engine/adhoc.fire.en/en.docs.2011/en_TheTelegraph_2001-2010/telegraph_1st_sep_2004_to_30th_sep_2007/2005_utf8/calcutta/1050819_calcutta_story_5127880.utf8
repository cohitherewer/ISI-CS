 If the ball rolls right, he could be seen next season alongside the likes of Nicky Butt and Emile Heskey in a Birmingham City shirt at the St Andrews stadium, pitting his goal-scoring skills against English Premier League defenders.

 Enter, Calcutta boy Paul Chiraag, 17, his foreign goal firmly in sight following an initial sortie in Sao Paolo and then Birmingham this summer.

 The nimble-footed striker, who took his O-level exams from Calcutta International School (CIS) earlier this year, has just returned after trials at Birmingham City?s training academy attached to Sollihul College, in the Midlands.

 ?I was carrying an ankle injury, which I picked up in Sao Paolo, and couldn?t go full throttle at the trials,? laments the talented teenager.

 But the Blues academy coach Michael Moore liked what he saw of Jeet (to family and friends) at a single session and wants him back at St Andrews (Birmingham City?s home) once he recovers from the ligament strain. ?The club has given me its prospectus and the manager wants to do a comprehensive assessment once I?m 100 per cent fit,? says Chiraag.

 The evaluation trip to the Premier League stop was facilitated by David Davies of the English Football Association, to whom Chiraag had written prior to leaving for Sao Paolo in June with ?friend-philosopher-guide? Douglas Da Silva, East Bengal?s Brazilian star.

 While dreaming of a Birmingham City shirt, the Ruud van Nistelrooy fan remains pragmatic about his overseas chances, and is not aiming all his shots at the English Premiership.

 Chiraag had earlier lit up the Sao Paolo arena, where he stayed with Douglas? family for six weeks, training and playing for Guarani. The Division I club from the Campinas region of Sao Paolo, which features in the Brazilian national Paulista League, checked him out in a pre-season tourney.

 ?We reached the final of that tournament and I scored a hat-trick before picking up this ankle injury and limping off the pitch. We lost 4-5,? recalls Chiraag.

 His on-field exploits impressed Guarani director (Durassi) and technical coach (Dino) enough ? ?they didn?t have a clue about Indian football prior to that? ? and they want him back in the Campinas as well.

 ?The Sao Paolo club has asked him to return for a minimum period of six months for further trials, offering to take care of Jeet?s education during his stay in Brazil and also pick up the tab for his travel,? says mother Arunima, who has always egged him on.

 The south Calcutta boy, who trains with East Bengal juniors in town, is now religiously undergoing his therapy sessions, itching to get back to the game by early next month.

 ?He has become far more focused on his football now, and even given up his favourite ilish, for fear of putting on those extra kilos,? smiles father Pradeep, an entrepreneur.

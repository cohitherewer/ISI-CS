The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 10 injured in gang war over graffiti 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barely a month before the Calcutta Municipal Corporation election, a clash broke out between supporters of the CPM and the CPI(M-L) in Thakurpukur?s Muchipara area on Tuesday morning, leaving 10 persons injured.

 One man has been arrested and several persons have been detained for questioning. The injured have been admitted to Medical College and Hospital and Vidyasagar Hospital. The CPM alleged the arrested man was a Maoist from Nepal.

 The area, comprising three wards controlled by the CPM, CPI(M-L) and the Trinamul Congress, has witnessed a series of clashes among political parties since the civic poll date was announced.

 The pretext for Tuesday?s violence, police said, was a dispute over graffiti related to the election. 

 Local CPM leaders alleged that around 9.30 am, some of their partymen had objected when a group from the CPI(M-L) started painting a wall already reserved by them.

 Within a few minutes, a heated exchange of words between the groups turned into a clash. Some CPI(M-L) supporters allegedly rushed back to their party office. They came out with bamboo poles and rods and beat up the CPM men.

 As news of the clash spread, CPM supporters of the locality gathered to take on their rivals. CPI(M-L) state committee secretary Chandan Pramanik, among others, was beaten up mercilessly.

 The CPM activists then allegedly ransacked the CPI(M-L) party office and shops and other establishments owned by supporters of the party. They even accused their rivals of harbouring a few wanted Maoists from Nepal.

 ?We know they are providing shelter to Maoists from Nepal, who are on the run since the army launched a crackdown,? Manju Kar, CPM councillor of ward 122, later said. 

 CPI(M-L) district secretary DiIip Chakraborty, however, denied that the clash was related to wall-writing or harbouring Maoist rebels from Nepal.

 ?Actually, we were trying to help a CPM sympathiser establish himself as a real estate developer, which he was not being able to because of his party?s reign of terror,? Chakraborty claimed.

 Late in the afternoon, a police team reached the spot and brought the situation under control. ?At this moment, we cannot say anything about the identity of the arrested man. All we can say is that things are better now,? said H.K. Kusumakar, additional superintendent of police (south).

 A police picket has been posted in the neighbourhood.

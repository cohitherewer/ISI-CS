The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Transit point to travel stop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Amman airport was to have been a transit point for two travellers from Calcutta. Instead, it proved to be the turnaround point, amidst charges of forgery.

 Sanjib Kumar Pal is a tabla player, who hails from Nabadwip and lives in a rented house in Agarpara. Children?s Theatre Group in Frankfurt, under the cultural exchange programme between India and Germany, had invited him in October.

 Kalyan Burman was flying to Zurich on a business trip.

 Both boarded a Royal Jordanian flight (RJ 0187) on the night of October 18 from Calcutta and reached Amman early on October 19.

 ?On reaching there, I was suppose to collect my boarding pass and catch my flight to Frankfurt. But once my turn came, they started looking at me suspiciously and asking various questions. Then they alleged that both my passport and visa were not genuine,? recounts Pal.

 The same blame was levelled at Burman, too.

 Despite repeated pleas, they were not allowed to contact anybody from the Indian embassy. ?We were told to shut up and sit in a corner of the airport lounge for three days. We had to sit on a wooden chair for more than 70 hours before being put on a flight back to Calcutta on October 21. We were not even given anything to eat. I told them I was not entering their country so they should not stop me, but they would just not listen,? says Pal.

 The tabla player had borrowed Rs 50,000 on interest for the trip and now needs to pay it back. But there has been no refund from the airlines. ?Initially, the officials in the Calcutta office refused to listen. Then we decided to take up the matter with the higher authorities. So, they started saying that they would try to provide some compensation. But that is yet to come,? laments Pal.

 ?They put scratches on all the pages of my passport. The treatment was inhuman,? complains Burman.

 When contacted by Metro, Royal Jordanian said they had got in touch with their officials in Amman. ?Our customer service department send me an email that the said passengers were sent back because their visas were forged. But according to the passengers, the visas were issued by the respective embassies and they have to be genuine. Even I thought what they said made sense, so I again communicated this to Amman. They have got in touch with officials of the embassies,? says John A. Crizzle, head, eastern and western operations of Jordanian Airlines.

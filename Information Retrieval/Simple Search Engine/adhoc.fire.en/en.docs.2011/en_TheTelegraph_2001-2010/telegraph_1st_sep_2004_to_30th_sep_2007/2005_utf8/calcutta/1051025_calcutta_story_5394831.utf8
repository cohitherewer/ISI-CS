 His puppets have a post-Cubist look and are dressed in shawls bought from Delhi and Rajasthan. The music of his production has influences from Japan, Finland and Norway. His own costume was made in Europe with a partly Indian look. His show is based on The Mahabharata. 

 ?I am not here to teach the epic to Indians; rather it is my homage to India,? says Massimo Schuster, who is as much an actor and a narrator on stage as he is a puppeteer. ?I am partners with my puppets,? he adds.

 The man from Marseille was drawn to the epic after seeing Peter Brooke?s production and then consulted myriad versions. ?I love working with stories that can travel from culture to culture.? He has staged The Iliad, the Ethiopian epic Glory of Kings as well as several Shakespearean tragedies. ?On the day Iraq was attacked, I staged Mahabharata in Paris. The similarity of the situation with the great, stupid war of Kurukshetra was obvious for the audience without my having to utter a word.?

 Schuster, now the president of the Union Internationale de la Marionette (Unima), an umbrella body of puppeteers, was drawn to puppets on seeing the American group Bread and Puppet Theatre perform on the streets with their giant puppets. ?Their anti-war messages fired my imagination in those post-Vietnam days.? He may not be speaking politics any more, but he deals with social issues. 

 His puppets do not belong to any particular variety, as he gets them made by artistes without any link to the art. For instance, the puppets he will use at his show on Tuesday evening at Max Mueller Bhavan are the work of celebrated Italian painter Enrico Bha. ?They are a hybrid between India and the West, and are more like statues.?

 His Mahabharata aims at familiarising a Western audience with the main story of the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

 Schuster finds similarities between the birth of Bhisma and Achilles, as well as the role of Krishna and Ulysses in the two epics. While he plans to return to the Iliad story in his next production, his link with India stretches beyond The Mahabha-rata. ?My daughter Nora has married a boy from Kanpur. My grandson Soham is now a month old,? the 65-year-old grins.

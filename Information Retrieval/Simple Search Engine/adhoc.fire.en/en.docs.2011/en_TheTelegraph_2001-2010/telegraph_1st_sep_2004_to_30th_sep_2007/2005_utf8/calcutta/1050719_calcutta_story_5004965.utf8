 Dropout to gang leader

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 24-year-old man arrested by Howrah police on Sunday, in connection with a string of cases, had studied in a reputed English-medium school in Liluah. Police said his crimes bore the hallmarks of a veteran.

 ?Arun Singh, alias Birendra, was arrested in his Belur residence on Sunday. He was wanted in a number of cases,? disclosed Howrah additional superintendent of police Kalyan Banerjee.

 Arun had studied till Class X in the Liluah school. As a student there, he had become friendly with some underworld operators of Bally and adjacent areas. Arun dropped out six years ago. Since then, he is believed to have devoted his time and energy to criminal pursuits. 

 After some petty jobs to find a foothold in the trade, Arun set up a gang of his own and enlisted some experienced criminals as members, said a police officer. ?Then he started planning big operations.? 

 A probe into Arun?s past has revealed that he had evolved a number of effective strategies to evade the police dragnet. A limited number of criminals formed his core group. Others were hired for specific jobs. No hired hand was used twice. During operations, speed used to be his gang?s forte. 

 ?Arun, along with his gang, once raided a husk mill at Pakuria, in Domjur. The gang came on motorcycles, raided the mill and bolted before bystanders realised what was happening,? said the police officer. 

 To conceal his identity, he introduced himself as Birendra to his gang members, the officer added. ?Despite working for him for more than four years, some members of his gang didn?t know his real identity.?

 The only son of a garment merchant, Arun was on the police wanted list for a long time. He was allegedly involved in at least four incidents of snatching and motorcycle theft in Bally. The theft of a truck from Malipanchghara, in Howrah, is also attributed to him.

 Police had obtained the number of Birendra?s motorcycle. A check later revealed that the number belonged to Arun Singh, leading to his arrest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Every artiste should have his own stamp?

 After his hit private albums Tera Chehra and Teri Kasam, ADNAN SAMI has finally made his full-fledged foray into Hindi film music with Lucky ? No Time For Love. With the soundtrack rocketing up the charts, the singer-composer speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about his new venture.

 You have earlier scored music for one-off 

tracks in quite a few Hindi films. Why did it take you so long to go all the way?

 Not quite a few. Just two, in fact. One was for Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke. That was because of Madhuri (Dixit), who is a very dear friend. She requested me to compose a track for the film and I can?t turn a friend down. The other song was for Dev saab?s Love At Times Square. I have been a huge fan of Dev Anand and it was an honour to work with him.

 So, why did you choose Lucky 

as your first complete film album?

 There are quite a few reasons for that. Firstly, I liked the story ? I found it very inspiring. Once I liked the story, I felt I needed to see whether it had musical scope or not. With the film set in Russia, it gave me a big opportunity to experiment with many Russian and European musical instruments. In fact, I have used many Russian folk instruments like the balalaika. So, the Russian backdrop did it for me. Also, Salman (Khan) is a dear friend and his family has been very supportive.

 You have used a lot of other male 

playback singers like Udit Narayan and Sonu Nigam. Why didn?t you sing the bulk 

of the songs yourself?

 Lucky being a film soundtrack, we wanted to bring in the best of singers. So, the film also gave me the opportunity to work with such amazing singers and in the process, the album got a very different flavour.

 How different was it for you to 

compose for a film soundtrack vis-?-vis your private Indipop albums?

 For an independent album, there are no limitations as far as the composition goes. You can go off on any tangent. But for a film soundtrack, the storyline is already defined. You have to take into consideration the situation and the locale. You have to keep in mind the continuity of the movie. So, a film soundtrack does create limitations but if you are able to come out of it convincingly, it is very exciting.

 Which other music directors in the 

industry do you look forward to for working as a playback singer?

 This may sound diplomatic on my part, but I have enjoyed working with all of them. All of the music directors have a unique element to them. They have their own methods of working and it is a pleasure to adapt to those different styles.

 The moment one listens to the Lucky 

songs one feels this distinct Adnan Sami flavour. What do you think contributes 

to that particular sound?

 I have no idea what makes critics feel that there is a typical flavour to my songs. I?m a slave to melody ? if that is what they mean. I think every artiste should have a certain signature of his own that can be recognised as his trademark stamp. 

 When you look at a Picasso, you instantly know it?s a Picasso. Musically too you are able to tell an RD Burman or a Madan Mohan or an A. R. Rahman. As for me, I can?t point a finger as to what exactly is my speciality. If at all, it is the melody.

 You have your favourite Asha Bhonsle 

singing for you in Lucky too...

 She had sung the Yeh Raaste? song for me. So technically we have worked together before for a film song. Even otherwise, we work a lot together. It is always a pleasure working with her. She?s known me as a kid and knows my psyche backwards now. Ashaji is truly an amazingly creative person.

 And what about Lata Mangeshkar who 

has also sung a track in the film?

 With Lataji, there are two firsts involved. She was singing to my composition for the first time. It was also the first time she was singing a duet with me. It was like a dream come true for me. She?s such a genius.

 Can you compare the two singers in 

any way?

 Well, both the sisters are brilliant. They have their distinct styles. One is a Rolls Royce, the other is a Bentley. It is very difficult to differentiate the two.

 Any other film projects in the pipeline?

 Yes, there are a couple of more soundtracks in the offing. But it is too early to talk about any of them. Once the films are finalised, I?m sure the makers will announce them. The film projects shouldn?t affect my private albums in any way, though.

 You are handpicking some great singing 

talents in the Super Singer contest on television. Are you going to use 

them in any of your projects?

 The Super Singer contest has been one emotional journey for me which gave me an opportunity to do a lot of soul searching. As of now, I have zeroed in on 25 singers having started with as many as 25,000 aspirants. Yes, I would love to use their singing talents for my soundtracks in the future.

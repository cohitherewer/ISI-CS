 Outlet owner absconding

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Forty-eight hours after sealing the kitchens of Haldiram Bhujiwala?s Jawaharlal Nehru Road outlet, cops are still on the lookout for owner Mahesh Agarwal. 

 The kitchens were sealed after police found that ovens were placed dangerously, flouting fire-safety norms.

 Mahesh is the brother of Prabhu Shankar Agarwal (owner of the other outlets of Haldiram), who has been arrested on charges of conspiring to murder a tea stall-owner in Burrabazar.

 Mahesh has been eluding police ever since the kitchens were sealed. He and a few of his managers, police claimed, had even changed their cellphone numbers. All attempts to track him through his acquaintances have failed.

 ?We will submit the chargesheet in the case within a few days. If Mahesh remains untraceable, he will be shown ?absconding?. Once the report is submitted, the court can issue an arrest warrant against him,? said a senior officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 Sources claimed that fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee had taken serious note of Agarwal?s attempts to elude police and has asked his officers to ensure that once arrested, he was not freed on bail. 

 On Friday, officials of the Andhra Bank branch (housed in a building adjacent to the Haldiram outlet) complained to the minister that it was becoming difficult for them to operate, as water was seeping in through the terrace.

 Soon after, Chatterjee asked his officers to probe the functioning of the outlet at 58, Jawaharlal Nehru Road. An inspection revealed that the kitchens on the first, mezzanine and second floors had around 45 gas and diesel ovens, all placed dangerously. 

 ?The case is very strong and we have concrete evidence that safety rules were violated,? said a senior fire services department official.

There is a growing concern among pet-owners about what to do when their pets are afflicted with rabies. Here are some dos and don?ts to clear common misconceptions.

 Rabies is: A serious viral disease that affects the central nervous system and is caused by the rabies virus present in the saliva of infected animals. Any bite, either deep or superficial, or even an infected animal?s saliva can be the source of this disease. Contrary to the popular belief that rabies can be caused only by the bite of a rabid dog, any warm-blooded animal, domestic or wild (cats,wolves, bats) can spread the disease.

 Symptoms: A dog suffering from rabies can show two forms of behaviour. The first is the furious form where the animal is aggressive and attacks anything it sees. The second is the dumb form where the animal becomes suddenly and unusually calm and withdrawn. The early signs of rabies are a sudden change in behaviour and voice. Some nervous symptoms may occur, like unsteady gait and onset of paralysis. Excessive salivation may also be seen and urination and defecation may be affected. If your dog gets into a fight with a stray animal or comes in contact with a suspected rabid dog, get him/her checked by your vet immediately. In case of a rabid stray animal, call the CMC or inform your local animal group to attend to the animal. Any animal suspected of rabies must be kept in veterinary quarantine for a period of 10 days for observation.

 When a rabid dog bites your pet: First clip the hair around the wound then clean the area with lots of running water and detergent soap. DO NOT COVER THE WOUND. Take your pet to the vet who will once again cauterise the wound and administer anti-rabies vaccination.

 Post-exposure: In humans, these vaccines are administered after contact with animals, which are rabid or suspected to be rabid. Previously, post-bite vaccinations involved 14 painful shots around the navel. But recent advances in science have made post-bite vaccinations in human beings safer and less painful.

 Pre-exposure: These are preventive vaccines for high-risk people like vets, animal caretakers, laboratory workers, forest rangers and cave explorers. If your work brings you in contact with the rabies virus or a potentially rabid animal, consider getting prophylactic pre-exposure vaccination annually.

 To help prevent rabies: Vaccinate your pet every year. However, pets should be kept away from stray dogs because no vaccine will guarantee 100 per cent immunity against rabies. Never leave your pet loose unsupervised because some dogs maybe carriers of rabies. Sterilisation and vaccination programmes are the only solution. Get a letter from your area councillor requesting an animal welfare group to undertake a sterilisation and vaccination programme.

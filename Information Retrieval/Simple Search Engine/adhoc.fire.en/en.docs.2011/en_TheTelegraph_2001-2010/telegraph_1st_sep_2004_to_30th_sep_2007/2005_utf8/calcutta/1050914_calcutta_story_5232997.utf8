 The Assembly standing committee on transport has pulled up the government for not taking effective steps to stop entry of trucks in the city during the ?restricted period?.

 The committee ? comprising MLAs from all parties ? held a meeting with representatives of the transport department and police in the Assembly on Monday to review the action taken by the government to ensure speedy vehicular movement.

 The panel blamed unrestricted movement of trucks for the traffic chaos in several parts of the city, especially the Burrabazar area.

 ?Entry of trucks in the city is banned between 8 am and 10 pm. But the rule is observed more in breach, as hundreds of trucks from the districts and neighbouring states enter Calcutta daily during this period. Neither police nor the transport department has taken any step to stop this,? said committee chairman Sadhan Pande.

 City-bound trucks are supposed to be parked at terminals and can enter the city only at night. Three terminals have been set up in Dhulagarh, Kona and Budge Budge. ?Yet, most truck operators park their vehicles on the road, and at petrol pumps and roadside dhabas, causing traffic snarls,? the chairman said at the meeting.

 According to officials, around 55,000 trucks enter the city daily. Of them, at least 15,000 enter during the ?restricted hours?. On several occasions, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has expressed concern over illegal entry of trucks in the city.

 The committee also observed that unless the restriction on the entry of goods vehicles was strictly enforced, pollution in the city could not be curbed. 

 Additional director-general of police Tapan Chatterjee, who was present at the meeting, said ?action had been taken? to prevent trucks from entering the city during daytime.

 ?The five-km stretch on Mumbai Road, up to Dhulagarh, has been declared a no-parking zone. I have asked the Howrah police to crack down on trucks parked on the road. Besides, the owner of the Dhulagarh truck terminal has been asked to run a campaign on the facilities available on the premises,? Chatterjee said.

 Green therapy: It is commendable on the part of the state forest department to take up a tree plantation programme near the city hospitals to soothe the nerves of patients (Foliage doll-up for health, March 28). The barren patches on the premises of government hospitals were becoming an eyesore. The entire operation would be more fruitful if the areas around the hospitals are cleaned and cleared of hawkers.

 Madhabi D. Ghosh,

 Salt Lake.

 The life of Sandhya Pal is a shame on society (?Driven by destiny, chasing elusive peace?, April 1). The tradition of respecting elders is on the way out in our country. Today, some of us do not even bat an eyelid while throwing our aged parents out of our homes. 

 It is ironical that despite being a mother of five well-settled children, Pal has no place to live other than the railway platform. There are more such women in the city who are constantly harassed by their children. I myself know of two. 

 One of them is a widow who earns her livelihood by reciting poems aboard local trains. Hawkers frown if she boards a compartment as her recitation distracts their potential customers. 

 Even the educated, and the otherwise well-behaved, passengers make fun of her by imitating her style of recitation and the cadence of her voice. The state government, however, conferred an award on this minstrel a few years ago. 

 The other such old woman I know is a granny who earns her living by begging on trains. She usually returns home, Sealdah station, by taking the Duttapukur local at 4.38 pm. Due to poor eyesight, she is dependent on others to count her alms. She is often cheated by the people with whom she entrusts her money. These people even offer her peanuts and snacks with her own money! They do not let the old woman sit beside them as she is slovenly dressed. Her money, however, is not untouchable to them. 

 The struggles of these aged women can provide inspiration to the jobless youth who prefer to sit idle. I hope NGOs come forward to alleviate the sufferings of such mothers and provide them a modicum of dignity for the rest of their days. 

 Debyani Basu,

 Apropos the report ?Thief at home, and not alone?, March 29, it is distressing to note that parents are succumbing to the pressure created by their kids. The youngsters are tempted by lavish lifestyles of their classmates in school, but the parents should not forget that meeting unreasonable demands of their wards will prove to be harmful in the long run. 

 Sometimes the mother provides funds to children unknown to the father or vice versa, which proves to be even more dangerous. The demands of the children then keep on mounting. Children should be made to understand that consumerism cannot be a goal in life. 

 Piyal Mukherjee,

 Lake Town. 

 Social pressure is not the only reason why teenagers like Sarika are trying to rip off their parents. I am sure that these children started by pinching small amounts from their parents? pockets. If at that time, their parents had punished them properly, things would not have come to such a state. Some children also do such things due to lack of attention and care from parents. By letting Sarika off so easily, her father is doing her more harm than good. 

 Sharmi Adhikary,

 Gorachand Road. 

 The report ?Girl rips off father to live high life?, March 28, left me with a distinct sense of unease. Why does a 19-year-old have such demands? Teenagers lead lavish lifestyles to battle deep-rooted loneliness and depression. It is the duty of parents to ensure that they do not indulge their children too much. 

 Mahelaka Begum,

 Christopher Road. 

 Unscrupulous doctors prescribing mammography to women below 40 for detecting breast carcinoma are a disgrace to the profession (Test radiation risk for young women, March 29). The unholy nexus among doctors, super-speciality clinics and hospitals are to blame for this. Mammography is similar to X-raying and is bound to cause tissue destruction. Regular X-raying for over 20 years can even cause breast cancer. The stress should be on breast self-examination, which can be supplemented by ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration cytology. 

 Dr Mohanlal Sarkar, 

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report ?Watchdog panel on school fees?, March 29, it is a good sign that the school education minister has expressed concern about the unjustified hike in fees of some English-medium schools affiliated to the Delhi boards and is planning to curb their freedom. It remains to be seen how stringently the measures against guilty schools are enforced. Many guardians are keeping their fingers crossed. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report ?Affidavit call in Sarobar slap?, April 2, I want to bring to the notice of the court and the government that the areas adjacent to the railway tracks, off Rabindra Sarobar, are not the only ones taken over by illegal settlers. Squatters have settled in parts of adjoining Govindapur as well. As a result, the area has become a den of anti-social activities. The Lake police station, under which the area falls, is indifferent to the pleas of residents. 

 Shanti Agarwal,

 Jadunath Sarkar Road. 

 Apropos the report ?Land scan for Lake squatters?, March 31, it is a welcome move on the part of the Left Front government to ask the railway authority to allot land before evicting the shanty-dwellers near the railway tracks, off Rabindra Sarobar. The state has agreed to construct flats for the evicted. But I am eager to know what the Left Front is planning for the people who were evicted from the areas surrounding Tolly Nullah and Beleghata canal. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane. 

 The state government?s initiative to rehabilitate the squatters on railway land along Rabindra Sarobar is laudable. Such a gesture is rational, humane and in tune with the spirit of a welfare state. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 The report ?Students and religion: a question of answers?, March 31, should evoke the interest of a cross-section of people. Hindus are liberal enough to allow the caricature of their gods and goddesses by people of other religion. But that does not mean that one has the right to degrade Hindu culture. I agree with the student who said ?do not touch us if you do not touch them?. 

 Pijush Banerjee,

 Sarsuna.

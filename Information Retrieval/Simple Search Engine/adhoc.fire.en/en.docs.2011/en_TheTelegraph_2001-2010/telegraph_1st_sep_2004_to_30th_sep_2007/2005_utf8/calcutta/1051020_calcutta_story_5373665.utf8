 Marriage portal goes offline

 - Lack 

of net-savvy parents among clientele prompts move 

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Match-making will now have a personalised touch

 At a time when most things are available online, a matrimonial portal is turning back the clock by making its member profiles available offline for the convenience of those who are still lost in cyberspace.

 In 1997, BharatMatrimony. Com became the first online marriage bureau. It now boasts 7.5 million profiles from across the globe. The entire database will be made accessible offline to tap those on the other side of the digital divide.

 In August, shaadi.com, another matrimonial service provider had set up an offline centre in the city.

 ?Though Internet usage is rapidly increasing, its penetration is still very low in our country. Most parents involved in matchmaking for their children are not Net-savvy. To address that segment of the market, we have decided to open an offline wing,? says Uday Zokarkar, head (new business initiative), BharatMatrimony.

 The offline wing is called BharatMatrimony Centre and is located on CIT Road, near the Kankurgachhi VIP Market.

 The company has so far been forging alliances through 15 regional portals. As per its records, the past two years have seen a rise in online matrimonial advertisements in Calcutta. ?We have had a hand in 500,000 marriages since 1997. Our portal makes it easy for anyone to zero in on the perfect partner. But there is still a section that cannot take advantage of our online database, as they are not comfortable with technology. Hence, BharatMatrimony Centre. The move will also provide a personalised touch to our brand name,? Zokarkar adds. 

 The centre, scheduled to open by October-end, is spread over 500 sq ft. ?We will have a team of customer-care executives and counsellors to guide the clients. From registering them offline to finding suitable matches, they will lend a helping hand at every step. By the time the clients walk out after registering, they will have at least five or six contacts. They will also be given an identity card so that they can avail of our matchmaking services,? states Biswa Priyo Chandra, regional manager (east) of BharatMatrimony.

 The company, with branches in the US, Canada and Dubai, is planning four more offline centres in the country. The Calcutta centre will be the only one in the eastern region. From horoscope matchmaking to planning weddings, the portal will also provide value-added matrimonial services. 

 ?We are trying to offer a complete package. For example, if somebody from US wants to marry here, we?ll do everything, from booking the venue to arranging the flowers,? says Chandra.

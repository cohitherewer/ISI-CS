The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Cinema for self-discovery

Light years away from his last film Deewaar, director 

MILAN LUTHRIA is on to a roller-coaster ride in Taxi No. 9211. He spoke to Pratim 

D. Gupta about the attraction of opposites, John Abraham and Nana Patekar, 

and the need to experiment

 John Abraham with Sameera Reddy in Taxi 

No. 9211, and (below) with director Milan Luthria John and Nana Patekar in 

Taxi No. 9211 

You switch genres at will. Is that deliberate?

Yes, it?s a conscious attempt to try something new 

every time I make a film. From Kachche Dhaage to Chori Chori to 

Deewaar and now, Taxi No. 9211, I have always tried my hand at something 

I have never done before. Otherwise there is no growth and you end up mass-producing 

the same thing. For me, commerce is not the only criterion. Every film should 

lead to a self-discovery, helping me learn along the way.

In hindsight, what do you think went wrong with 

Deewaar?

The timing of the release went totally wrong. Deewaar 

was preceded by LOC and Lakshya. So everybody thought that here 

was another film on border issues, about Pak bashing. People didn?t want to see 

another film on those lines. Families avoided it too, thinking it was all blood 

and gore.

The whole cast and crew including myself were very 

happy with the product. No regrets on that count. It was a special experience 

for all of us. Deewaar was logistically a very difficult film to make. 

Really can?t complain that it didn?t work at the box-office. Some of the best 

works of many film-makers haven?t clicked commercially.

Will Taxi No. 9211 click? What?s it all 

about?

You never know. It is about these two strangers in 

a city of 20 million people. They are from the opposite ends of the social spectrum, 

one is a taxi driver (Nana Patekar) and the other an industrialist (John Abraham). 

Their paths cross and thus begins a roller-coaster ride where the two end up blaming 

each other for the state they find themselves in. But they also see their reflection 

in each other, which makes them realise that the answer is within them. That?s 

the theme of the film ? the solution to all problems lies inside yourself.

But the film doesn?t look that heavy?

Because it?s packaged very differently, as a pacy, 

funny film. We have used the chance meeting of the two to lead into a snowball 

effect, where one thing leads to another. It?s like a crazy Tom-and-Jerry ride. 

The humour is cynical and subtle. It?s also very fast ? just 110 minutes.

So you have done away with the songs which have 

been a hallmark of your films like Kachche Dhaage and Chori Chori?

No, there are two songs but they are used more in 

the background. The film has a very international look, shot by Kartick Vijay, 

a fresh graduate from the film school in Los Angeles who?s already won an award 

at the Sundance Film Festival. The music is by Vishal-Shekhar and the songs sound 

very fresh and young. We shot the entire film in a start-to-finish schedule of 

just 45 days.

How did you come up with this bizarre idea of casting 

John Abraham and Nana Patekar?

I basically wanted opposites and was playing around 

with all the available options. I have always liked John a lot and believed that 

there is a lot of untapped potential in him. Nana is someone with whom I have 

wanted to work for a long time. The two are very different in their repertoires, 

coming from two different schools of acting. The two also have very different 

fan followings.

What about the ladies?

I cast Sameera Reddy because I didn?t want someone 

demure or petite opposite the strong physicality of John. Sameera has a very aggressive 

body language and the pair does look good together. As for Nana, I went for Sonali 

Kulkarni opposite him. She is a very accomplished actress and for that role I 

really needed someone to perform.

What next?

I have two to three ideas in mind and am working on 

the scripts. One we are planning with the same production house, that of Ramesh 

Sippy ? he?s brilliant to work with. It is an adventure film based on a true story. 

I am also writing a comedy and a fantasy film.

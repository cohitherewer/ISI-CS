 Wanted: Full stop to animal cruelty

 PET PASSION

 NILANJANAA

 Very often, I find myself screaming 

 from the window ? at passers-by kicking dogs, street urchins 

 tugging at the tails of puppies or ?dutiful? watchmen pouring 

 water on cats to drive them away. This is just the tip of 

 the iceberg as compared to some of the heinous crimes that 

 are committed against animals in the city every other day. 

 I still cringe in horror when I recall the gruesome killing 

 of a stray dog (in Sinthee) by 18 and 20-year-olds. 

 Why does animal abuse find a special 

 mention in my column so often? Because cruel acts towards 

 animals can be signs of worse things to come, often with 

 human victims.

 According to PETA, research in 

 psychology and criminology shows that people who commit 

 acts of cruelty to animals often move on to violent acts 

 against their fellow humans. 

 Animal cruelty or abuse is, ?knowingly 

 depriving an animal of food, water, shelter, socialisation 

 or veterinary care or maliciously torturing, maiming, mutilating, 

 or killing an animal?.

 The connection between animal 

 cruelty and human violence: 

 Many studies in psychology, sociology 

 and criminology during the past 25 years have demonstrated 

 that violent offenders frequently have childhood and adolescent 

 histories of serious and repeated animal cruelty. The FBI 

 has recognised the connection when its analysis of the lives 

 of serial killers suggested that most had killed or tortured 

 animals as children.

 Why would anyone be cruel to 

 animals:

 Animal cruelty, like any other 

 form of violence, is often committed by a person who feels 

 powerless or unnoticed. The motive is to shock, threaten, 

 offend others or just reject society?s rules. Some who are 

 cruel to animals copy things they have seen and others see 

 harming an animal as a way of getting back at animal lovers. 

 Violence begets violence: 

 The most disturbing correlation 

 is between cruelty to animals and violence against children. 

 Children raised in violent homes may in turn direct violence 

 at the only individual in the family more vulnerable than 

 themselves: an animal. A World Society for the Protection 

 of Animals study found 75 per cent of violent criminals 

 were abused as children, with many saying that they in turn 

 harmed animals. 

 What should you do:

 Most children naturally feel concern 

 and affection for animals but learn cruelty from society 

 and lose sight of their compassion. If your child has deliberately 

 harmed an animal, try to find out what caused the cruelty. 

 Use real-life situations to instil a sense of respect for 

 animals. Make your child help you feed the birds or rescue 

 an animal. With older children, discuss animal-cruelty cases 

 publicised in the news. Encourage children to speak out 

 for animals. 

 Compassionate children lead 

 to compassionate adults:

 In an effort to break the cycle 

 of violence and instil compassion at an early age, PETA 

 has developed a humane education programme called Compassionate 

 Citizen. The programmes, in print and on video, are free 

 to any school that asks for them. The printed material enhances 

 students? understanding of animals. Contact infopetaindia.org 

 or nnarayanpetaindia.org 

 Laws:

 We need stronger laws to protect 

 animals and stricter punishment for offenders.

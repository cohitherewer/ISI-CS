 Drop of golden sun to light up nuptial

 ?Samrat * Madhusree? announces the banner on the gate. In small print all around is written ?solely solar?, explaining what the symbol between the two names stands for ? the sun.

 A blind lane opposite 20, Kankulia Road, is playing host to a marriage reception (boubhat) on Sunday evening that is possibly Calcutta?s first wedding programme lit by solar energy.

 ?By opting for solar lights, we have completely bypassed the CESC grid. Not using electricity means not having to apply for connections, deposit a lumpsum amount and hire a generator for emergency purposes,? explains Samrat Laha, the bridegroom.

 A bold and unconventional move, no doubt. But the groom is not worried. He deals in solar energy himself. 

 ?We have done this at Ganga Sagar, where even the fax machine and the TV set at the district magistrate?s bungalow run on solar power. But people here have many misconceptions about such alternative energy. So, I thought this would be a good demonstration,? the 28-year-old smiles.

 For the past couple of days, silicon panels have been left in the sun on the roof of the Laha residence. Fifteen batteries have been charged from the silicon cells, that converted light energy to electricity. 

 These are now powering the lights above the buffet table, as people queue up for biryani and chicken butter masala or the stage, where cultural programmes are being held. 

 ?We are using 40 lights, of nine watts each, four ceiling fans of 20 watts each and two table fans of 15 watts each. So, our total load is 470 watts. Compare this to the fact that the wattage of just a neon light comes to 60, including the starter and the choke,? says Shibaji Sengupta, director of Solace, the firm behind the light show.

 The illumination bill is also easier on the pocket in comparison. ?For a similar lighting arrangement, a contractor would charge around Rs 6,000. Add to that the metered electricity charge which would come to around Rs 400. To guard against power cuts, one, of course, would have to hire a generator set as well. That means an addition of say, another Rs 700. So, the total would come to more than Rs 7,000. We can hire this out for another wedding and the bill will be less than Rs 5,000,? Sengupta assures. 

 But Laha?s concern centres more around the environment than economics. ?If people start using solar energy, imagine how we can conserve the conventional modes of power and cut down on pollution, both sound and air, that a generator causes,? he says, as the guests gape at the little lights on the wall.

 What if something goes wrong with the lights? Without alternatives, the alternative is pitch darkness. The groom?s aunt Ira Sen and mother Shila Laha both admitted to being a wee worried. ?But Samrat has taken charge,? Shila muses. 

 The mother trusts the son, even if not the sun.

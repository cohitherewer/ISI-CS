The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wisdom trail, wow amp; weird

 Bechu Chatterjee Street

 Judges Court Road

 Heysham Row

 Chetla Park

 Bhagabati Lane, Kalighat

 The veena-bearing goddess is said to have been born a river. She flowed by Brahmavartta, ho-me of the early Aryans. Being their most important source of water, she was as sacred to them as the Ganga has been to our forefathers. Thus she became a deity, venerated as the Muse who inspired the composition of hymns sung in rituals conducted on her banks.

 Since then a lot of water has 

 flowed down the stream of Time. The river Saraswati dried 

 up long back. A day before the fifth auspicious shuklapanchami 

 of the 21st century ? or Saraswati puja ? a couple of invitations 

 prompted a reality check on where the deity and her swan 

 stand on the piety scale. 

 Spoon full

 Stop One: Hazra. A little 

 makeshift temple has come up in a blind lane. The goddess 

 here is worshipped by students of the adjacent institute. 

 But the students here are not votaries of the text book 

 but of the arc light and the ramp. Architect-in-chief Swarup 

 has been hard at work with the decorations. But a call for 

 a photo-op induces many pretty young things to shed their 

 jeans and tops for saris (or in one hurried case, even use 

 the sari as a wrap-around). ?This is our second year. We 

 want to show that modelling is not aposanskriti but 

 is as faithful to rituals as any other art,? smiles Samrat 

 Mukherjee, the moving spirit behind the institute. The goddess 

 has been decorated with paat kathi and heaps 

 of ice-cream spoons. Where did they get the supply from? 

 ?We had asked the local ice-cream shops three weeks ago 

 not to throw away their used spoons,? the young man beams. 

 Used ice-cream spoons for puja? Twin sisters Mohua and Moushumi 

 exchange a quick puzzled glance. Then, silence.

 Model mould

 Stop Two: Kalighat Potuapara. 

 If the trip-up at the style temple was due to lack of wisdom 

 about the rights and wrongs of rituals, it is sheer market 

 mechanics that rule at the second biggest hub of artisans 

 in the city. Indrajit Sinha has laid out his choicest pair 

 of creations in front of his studio. In the middle of a 

 sea of idols all around, benign and in benison mode, the 

 two stick out for chutzpah. The three-and-a-half-ft high 

 things of buxom beauty in choli and ghagra 

 (flowing from well below the divine navel) are priced around 

 Rs 400. ?I have based them on models since that is an upcoming 

 profession,? smiles the 19-year-old, who graduated from 

 assistant to lead artiste three years ago. But they hardly 

 look like goddesses! ?Actually I am trying out a new look. 

 Let?s see if customers like it,? says the youth, in slight 

 discomfiture. Two other idols in the same style have already 

 been scooped up by customers, inform artisans from neighbouring 

 studios. Take a bow, Yana Gupta. 

 Out of syllabus

 Stop Three: Further up Kalighat Road. A sight of a man throwing handfuls of dust at an eight-ft idol was cause for the car to stop. The dust turned out to be sawdust and the man Bijoy Chakraborty. ?My clients are from Judge?s Court Road in Alipore. I have been supplying them idols for three years now. Last year, they took one with a coat of rice dust and of plaster of Paris the year before,? reveals the man who also shapes Durga idols. Innovations, he says, are being called for in Saraswati puja too ?for some three-four years? now. ?A couple of years ago I did a journey of the script ? stone carvings, leaf inscriptions, pen on paper and finally computers ? for a school in Salt Lake. But they have gone back to the traditional look,? he adds a trifle dispiritedly.

 Books in clay ? a pile of them 

 with the top one open ? also do good business, he says. 

 These are replacements of idols and are reminiscent of the 

 times when Saraswati puja used to be a quiet private affair 

 ? worship of text books at home. In the age of fusion, tradition 

 and innovation walk hand in hand.

 The resurrection

 Stop Four: Kalighat temple. 

 A walk up to the pivot of piety in the city reveals a beautiful 

 work of art in shells which from a distance resembles Lord 

 Krishna, with a veena in hand. Kalighat Matri Sangha, 

 an association of sebaits and priests, is known for 

 innovations through the 52 years of its existence. Here 

 it is a compulsion driven by religious diktat. ?We cannot 

 worship any clay idol within the periphery of the Kali temple. 

 So every year we have to resort to different materials, 

 be it buttons or bamboo leaves,? says treasurer Chinmoy 

 Mukherjee. The idol has been placed in the middle of a pool 

 with two-ft deep water. All around the cemented bank are 

 13 aquariums. ?The deity comes to rescue us from the depths 

 of ignorance. The shells go with sea life and the fish in 

 the aquariums are symbols of fertility, in this case of 

 wisdom,? explains artist Bibhas Mukherjee. Saraswati finally 

 finds resurrection in a well-woven theme.

 Other Mother

 Stop Five. Chetla Park. 

 From the temple to the church. That too in Atacama desert 

 in Chile. ?After a pagoda last year, we wanted to do a church. 

 A search on the Net landed us this model,? smiles Arindam 

 Ghosh of Chetla Park Cultural Club. It is a towering Gregorian 

 structure that welcomes the believer (and non-believer). 

 Inside stands Mother Mary. Only, her holy stick has been 

 turned to a veena and in place of little Jesus in 

 her lap is a rosary of rudraksh. ?We have consulted 

 the Bible Society about the changes as we do not mean to 

 hurt religious sentiments,? adds Ghosh. In a locality known 

 for myriad faces of Kali, the club concentrates its creativity 

 on Saraswati to ensure greater footfall. Going by the numbers 

 last year?s pagoda drew, Mother Mary should find quite a 

 following through Sunday. 

 Caste card

 Stop Six. Bechu Chatterjee Street. Saraswati Primary School has been opened a stone?s throw away from Thanthania Kalibari. Beside the idol, a woman of a lower caste in clay is poised to serve a meal to children seated in a row. But an angry babu is ready to pull away his son. This is Swami Vivekananda Sporting Club?s indictment of the ugly face of caste politics that came into sharp profile recently over mid-day meals at schools. ?We choose a social theme every year. This year the budget is Rs 55,000,? says club member Bimal Pal.

 Such a shadow on school premises 

 is enough to make the visitor ? and the Devi ? shudder.

 Love letter

 Last stop. Heysham Row. Taj Mahal beckons from the alley in Bhowanipore. ?If Shah Jahan created the original for his begum, this is my tribute to my wife,? beams Manoj Gandhi, head honcho of the para puja. From a humble half-a-foot beginning on a street corner, the puja has grown and how. ?Last year, the puja was on Republic Day and we built a Red Fort.? 

 ?Durga, Kali and now Saraswati have fallen prey to the pull of populist innovations. Why don?t they dare touch Lakshmi? Is it because they are scared to get hit where it hurts most?? wonders Debnita Chakravarti, lecturer with Shri Shikshayatan College.

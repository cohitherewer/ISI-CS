Add-ons bode ill for old edifice

 Writers? Buildings: Burdened

 Limitless add-ons do not bode well for a structure, and when it comes to a building as old as 200 years, the fallout can be disastrous.

 That?s what an experts? committee has assessed about Writers? Buildings, where a multitude of toilets and false ceilings in the rooms of almost all ministers and secretaries have been identified as the two most risky additions.

 The experts fear that these appendages not only threaten to disturb the building?s stability or impede manoeuvrability during crisis management, but hide dangers lurking in the corners from the maintenance staff.

 Following an incident last month, when a portion of the ceiling over the VIP stairway caved in, public works department (PWD) minister Amar Choudhury had formed a committee to study the overall condition of the building.

 The brief was to spot the vulnerable points and suggest measures to overcome the risks, present and potential. The panel had zeroed in on false ceilings and attached bathrooms as the two prime sources of concern.

 ?A large number of rooms with air-conditioners have false ceilings, either to keep the rooms cooler or because the occupants, mostly ministers or senior officers, do not like the old-fashioned high ceilings. Few understand that these low ceilings can spawn disaster,? said a senior PWD engineer, who was a member of the investigating team.

 He explained that false ceilings ? usually made of plywood or plastic ? are vulnerable to fire. ?Besides, as they hide the main ceilings, there is no way of knowing whether a crack has appeared in the structure. These fashionable ceilings indirectly lead to negligence, as far as regular maintenance is concerned.?

 As for the attached toilets, the experts opined that they increase the overall load of the building and create weak points on every floor.

 ?Water seepage is very much possible. No one seems to have refused to meet the demands for attached toilets by ministers and senior officers. We have to be careful in future and the current task is to ensure rigorous maintenance,? the official added. 

 The other add-ons telling on the health of this ancient edifice are computers, fax machines, air-conditioning plants and machines, exhaust fans, ceiling fans, pumps and lights ? all indispensable for a modern workplace.

 The most significant suggestion of the experts? committee is to prevent any further construction of false ceilings. ?We have to work out whether the existing ones must be dismantled or replaced. That has to be decided after the issue is discussed at length among the group of officials,? said a member of the committee.

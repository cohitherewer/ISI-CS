 Hard times are ahead if you have a craving for foreign cigarettes. For, they are fast disappearing from stalls in central Calcutta and are feared to disappear from stalls elsewhere in the city, too, thanks to raids by a government department.

 The department of legal metrology, acting on complaints from a reputed cigarette brand, has seized a large number of cartons of foreign cigarettes from stalls in the Park Street, Loudon Street and Little Russell Street areas over the past few days. Raids in other parts of the city are likely to follow soon.

 ?We have received complaints from a firm that foreign cigarettes are being sold here without valid papers, and at rates much more than the actual price,? said N.R. Banerjee, joint secretary of the legal metrology department. ?Following the allegations, our officials have conducted raids and seized a large number of cigarette cartons from footpath stalls.?

 Not long ago, a multinational had complained to the department that some of its products, marketed by a sister firm in China and Bangladesh, were being sold illegally in Calcutta.

 According to officials, most of these foreign cigarettes are stored in secret godowns. ?Our men, posing as customers, approached some stalls and asked for a foreign brand. They were charged thrice the actual amount. We later found out that prices of all foreign brands were hiked,? said an official.

 The department pressed the alarm bell on receiving reports that the illegal sale of foreign brands were not confined to the Park Street area, but has spread across the city.

 ?Selling these foreign brands without a licence means loss of business for the owners and revenue for the state. We are now trying to identify the smuggling route and those who are running the racket,? the official added. 

 To keep the supply chain secret, hawkers are changed every four to six months.

 However, as the legal metrology department does not have the powers to investigate and can only impose a monetary fine on offenders, the guilty get off the hook easily.

 ?Recently, we had booked four offenders and imposed fines on them. One of them paid the fine, around Rs 2,000, on the spot and requested our team to release him so that he could get back to business and realise the amount,? the official recalled.

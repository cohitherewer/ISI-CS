 Coffee break for Salt Lake

 The first coffee bar of the city is back with two more offerings ? this time for the coffee addicts of Salt Lake.

 Aqua Java, the coffee chain that opened way back in the late 90s, is in expansion mode now. The two outlets, one an express kiosk at City Centre and the other a coffee bar in the Kwality area of Sector I in Salt Lake, have already become hot haunts for the hip and happening.

 ?There are not too many coffee outlets in this bustling satellite township, so we decided to tap the market,? says owner of the chain Saket Agarwal. Indeed, with prices starting at Rs 8 for a steaming cup of hot mocha, business looks fetching. Strategically situated just outside INOX, the Aqua Java outlet in City Centre is attracting heady foootfalls.

 But with the summer sun out in full force now, the mochas and cappuccinos are giving way to large helpings of cool shakes, also part of the menu. ?Black currant, mango, strawberry and orange are among the flavours that are doing well now,? says Agarwal.

 Even though coffee remains the mainstay of the Aqua Java brand, the snacks section is an added attraction. ?We are not into Indian or elaborate food as yet. For now, we are sticking to sandwiches and longs,? says Agarwal. ?Even people who drop in for a quick drink like the mix of food and beverages,? he adds. 

 Crunchin Java and Brownie Java ? favourite cold coffees at the Wood Street outlet ? are proving to be quite popular at the new addresses as well. ?The idea is to give the Salt Lake clientele a taste of good Aqua Java coffee without having to go all the way to the heart of the city,? says Agarwal.

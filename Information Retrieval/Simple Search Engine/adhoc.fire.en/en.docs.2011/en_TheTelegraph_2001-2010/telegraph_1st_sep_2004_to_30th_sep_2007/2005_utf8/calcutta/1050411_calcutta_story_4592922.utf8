 Bengal art confronts the globe

 - Artists rooted in their individuality

 It is a matter of fact that Bengal artists try to retain their individuality, remain rooted, without blindly imitating what are perceived as global trends. It is too early to make pronouncements about the reasons behind this, but perhaps geography ? their remoteness from the West ? is one. The second could be an innate conservativeness, though, as is well known, Bengal had spearheaded art movements in the past.

 However, this is a blessing in disguise. They do not go overboard to package their work in ways that would be acceptable to a ?global? viewership. Quite unlike some recent film-makers who think nothing of thus transmogrifying classics of Bengali literature.

 So the current exhibition titled New Wave in Bengal Art at Akar Prakar gallery raised many expectations, more so because it was curated by art historian Pranabranjan Ray. Of the 24 artists, whose works are on display here, most belong to the post-70?s generation. The only two exceptions are Partha Pratim Deb and Jayashree Chakravarty, both well-known practitioners. These artists have one thing in common ? their education. They are all products of either Kala Bhavan, Rabindra Bharati or MS University in Baroda, institutions which have produced some leading artists of our times.

 At least one artist ? Arpan Mukherjee ? has used state-of-the-art technology ? digitography ? to create quite a large work. Some others have chosen to create installations. Adip Dutta has created an assemblage with a cast of his own head, a below-the-belt human figure made of steel wool and an upright mould of a somewhat menacing mummy. Over the years, the sculptor has managed to script a more terse dialogue though the ingredients remain the same. 

 Some of the best works are by artists who have chosen to work in a smaller format where, in spite of eschewing the beaten track, they don?t look beyond the traditional paint and brush. 

 Rima Kundu exploits the aesthetic possibilities of a typically feminine craft like needlework and rhymes once popular in the zenana. Mithu Sen creates icons of femininity that verge on the erotic by using real and synthetic hair and bright red cloth.

 The craft of the miniaturist comes in handy for Debnath Basu. The recurrent image in the background of a painting is that of a human being of indeterminate sexuality lifting weights along with rhymes in closely-written Bengali script. At the centre is a bed with bolsters. In another, a man lies on the ground his penis exposed. Between his legs is a sword poised for penetration. By appropriating and freely mixing images, Basu creates works that can be read at many levels.

 Samit Das apparently creates a set of eight black-and-white architectural drawings. He sticks strips of textured paper to his drawings to create an impression of a third dimension. One has only to look carefully at the works for the illusion to be dispelled. The same can be said of the works of Ashim Purakayastha who replicates what looks like a batch of postage or revenue stamps. The boundaries between the real and the unreal dissolve.

 Rajarshi Biswas goes a step further creating photographic reality on canvas with oil paints, cocking a snook at some of the basic tenets of modern art. Aku paints the face of a deity on its decapitated marble torso ? a found object. On the other hand, Chandana Hore?s impasto stands out by virtue of the colours she has juxtaposed. There seems to be a constant striving to break new ground as the artist tries out her/his own take on reality.

 However, some of the installations are too loopy for consideration. The exhibition sponsored by ITC Hotel will travel to Mumbai.

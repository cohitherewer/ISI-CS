 Nayanika (name changed on request), daughter of a multinational executive, was browsing the racks at New Market, when she was rounded up by New Market police and grilled for hours. Her fault: she did not have enough cash on her to prove that she intended to buy something. 

 The cops deployed to round up lifters during last-minute Puja shopping followed Nayanika for half-an-hour before taking her to the police station. She was released after they spoke to her family members over the phone. 

 Shop, but don?t window-shop, is the advice of Calcutta Police for those who have plans to visit shopping arcades in the near future. The detective department hopes the counsel will keep out of harm?s way those in the habit of hanging out at malls.

 ?If you aren?t buying, don?t stroll in the markets. And, obviously, do not move aimlessly from one shop to another. Follow our advice at least till Diwali,? stressed Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department.

 The cops have rounded up at least 25 people from different malls and markets, including New Market, Sreeram Arcade and Metro Plaza, in the past few days.

 ?Like every year, we decided to keep a close eye on shoppers to protect the store-owners. We took the people into custody during the course of our vigil at the markets,? added Singh.

 An officer of the detective department elaborated: ?We first asked them the reason behind their presence in the malls. Most of them said they had come to buy clothes. But we searched them and found they were not carrying enough money to buy anything. We had no option but to take them to police stations or Lalbazar.?

 The cops then found out the addresses and telephone numbers of the detained people. ?We contacted their family members and verified their identities. We released them after we became sure that they were not lifters. The process took at least two hours,? continued the officer.

 ?Before releasing them, we had asked them the real reason they had come to the malls. All of them said that they had come for window-shopping,? said another officer.

 Countering charges of harassment, a senior cop said: ?Identifying a lifter in a crowd is not an easy job. We detained the people who were moving about aimlessly. It is the responsibility of those who are intercepted to prove their innocence.?

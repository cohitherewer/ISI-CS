 Teddy talk for the tongue-tied

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 If the mind-boggling array of flowers, candies, jewellery and other Valentine?s goodies on offer has left you speechless, let a squeaky pillow or teddy do the talking for you. The heart-shaped padded pillows and teddy bears in various sizes, literally wearing their hearts on their sleeves or carrying the sweet burden of love on their shoulders, spell out the three magical words if you are feeling too tongue tied yourself. 

 The pillows that chant ?I love you? when pressed lightly is one gift option that never fails to bring a smile. The bright red hearts in various sizes also make a splash when thrown around the house for a dash of colour, apart from making cute gift options. 

RACK RAIDER

 What

Battery-powered pillows and 

teddies that chant I love you

 Where

Hallmark, Archies

 How much

Rs 45 to Rs 7,000

You get them in shiny polyester, smooth as silk, or even cotton if a subtle statement is more your style. A touch of fur and a cotton-polyester mix is also available if you want to achieve a fine balance. 

 While the 8-inch pillows are just eye candy, the 36-inch hearts can hold a head full of sweet dreams through the night. The sizes in between come in handy in case you want to indulge in some mock pillow fighting on V-Day, to make up in style thereafter! 

 If you want a cuddlier option, there are teddy bears starting from six inches and going up to six feet that also mouth ?I love you? when given a loving squeeze. 

 What makes them especially endearing is that they hold a heart either on their arm or on their shoulder, that usually features a mushy caption or two. 

 To send across a cosier message, there are two teddies clubbed together that all but go to tango singing ?I love you...? When they run out of steam, simply change the batteries and hear them coo all over again!

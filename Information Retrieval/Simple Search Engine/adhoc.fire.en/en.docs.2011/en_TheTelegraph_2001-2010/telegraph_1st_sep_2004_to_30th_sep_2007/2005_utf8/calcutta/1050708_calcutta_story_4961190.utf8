 You are coming out with a private album after five years. Why such a long gap?

 The last albums I did were Jaanam Samjha Karo, Aap Ki Asha and Parde Mein Rehne Do. These days you have to be very careful with the music companies you are working with. Sometimes they dont pay you properly. Sometimes they dont publicise the album properly. And at times, they dont even release the album ? record chhapti hi nahin hai. Its happened with me before. The labels here tell their foreign companies that the album didnt work and eat up the money. Nuqsan batake poore paise kha jate hain. In such scenarios, it doesnt make sense to sing songs. All the efforts go to waste.

 So you are back with HMV for your new album?

 Haan, HMV ke liye main bachpan se gaati hoon. The people who are looking after HMV now, the Goenkas, are khandaani people. So I sat with them and we planned out this album. 

 Theres this guy, Somesh Mathur, who has been after me for the last five or six years, trying to convince me to sing these ghazals recreated by him. Main taalti rahi? But this time, my son Anand asked me to listen to the songs. And I found them really nice ? songs from India, songs from Pakistan, sung by greats like Ghulam Ali and Mehdi Haasan ? Aaj jaane ki zid na karo and Aawargi? One of them is by Jagjit Singh. It was a new challenge. R.D. Burman ke baad, koi challenge to bacha nahin?

 Have you kept the original flavour of the ghazals or sung them in your style?

 I obviously havent changed the songs. Since they are all of three to four minutes and they are not classical songs, we havent been able to increase the duration. The orchestration is different. Uss din ke baaja peti aajkal ke bachchon ko pasand nahin ayenge. So weve made the arrangement different. I loved singing the songs ? kuch kami nahin chhodi? 

 The independent album industry has been badly hit in recent times due to the remix rage and rampant piracy. Do you think your album will be able to break the jinx?

 I definitely think so. Jo jo gaane humne gaaye hain, likhawat achhi hai, samajhne mein mushkil nahin hai. So I feel it will be kind of a relief to the constant dhan dhana dhan. Also, the music video (to go on air from Friday) has been shot very well ? aisa jo mann ko bhayega? The most important thing is that the music will touch you emotionally.

 Why have you cut down on your film songs so much?

 Mujhe woh log mere paise nahin de sakte. They cant pay me the amount I charge per song. When people come all the way from Calcutta, I happily sing for them. Main Bangal ke liye kam leti hoon. I have nothing against singing for Hindi films. I recently sang Lucky lips and it became a big hit. But if people dont pay me properly why go out of my way to sing in films? Mujhe naya naam ya naya paisa leke kya karna hai? I dont want to be in the rat race anymore. 

 Your versatility is still unmatched. How do you still balance a remix with a ghazal?

 I have learnt to sing that way. Having sung for the last 60 years, I can interpret all kinds of feelings. Subah bhajan, dopahar ko qawwali, shaam ko cabaret? thats what I have been singing all these years. Now it has become a habit. 

 So, these days just looking at the song is enough to understand the thought behind it.

 You have sung with Boy George and Code Red. Any new global projects?

 Yes, I have collaborated with a San Francisco band called Chrono Scotte who came to London and did research on RD Burmans songs, finally handpicking nine numbers. RD ko kahaan pahuncha diya? The album will be released under the Warner Bros music label this September. Apart from the eight Hindi songs, they have even chosen a Bengali song having liked the rhythm and tune. (Sings) Ekta deshlai kathi jalao?

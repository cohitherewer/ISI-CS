 Girl stages abduction with friend

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An 18-year-old schoolgirl connived with her boyfriend to stage an abduction drama, only to be caught red-handed while trying to extract a ?ransom? of Rs 50,000. The boy has been arrested and the girl detained for questioning.

 Suparna Das (name changed), a Class XII student of a school at Dum Dum Park, staged the abduction on Tuesday evening to extort money from her parents and ?have some fun? with her boyfriend, police said on Wednesday.

 ?The boyfriend, Pijush Mondal, was her classmate. On Monday, while leaving for school, Suparna told her parents that she would return after her tutorials. But after school, she did not go to the tutor. Instead, she and Pijush fled to Digha,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.

 They boarded a bus at Esplanade on Monday night and reached Digha the next morning. They put up at a hotel posing as spouses.

 ?But they soon ran out of money and decided to return to the city. Back in Calcutta, the two made several calls to the girl?s parents from telephone booths and told them Suparna had been kidnapped and that they needed to pay Rs 50,000 to secure her release,? said a senior police officer.

 They asked the girl?s father to come to the Ultadanga crossing with the money. Suparna?s parents contacted police and on their advice, decided not to turn up on the designated spot. Plainclothesmen, however, kept a watch.

 Seeing their plan fizzle out, Pijush called Suparna?s father again and told him that the ransom was now to be paid in Lake Town. Sleuths, meanwhile, learnt the truth after interrogating two of Pijush?s friends, Arnab and Subhadip. 

 ?Initially, their statements were incoherent. But soon they divulged the entire plan. We laid a trap for Pijush in Lake Town on Tuesday night and he walked straight into it,? superintendent Kumar said.

 A little later, police found Suparna hiding behind a bush. ?Both confessed that they wanted to make some easy money,? added Kumar. They also confessed that they had thought of the plan long ago.

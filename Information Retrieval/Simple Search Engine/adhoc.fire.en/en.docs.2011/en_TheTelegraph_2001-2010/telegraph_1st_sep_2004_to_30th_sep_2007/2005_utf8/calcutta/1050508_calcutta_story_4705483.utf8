Dancer Sanchita Bhattacharya putting up an Odissi recital. Tarun Bhattacharya on the santoor and Bikram Ghosh on the tabla. Jayabrato Chatterjees specially-composed poem. Rabindrasangeet exponent Pramita Mullick and Manipuri dancer Priti Patel in a simple rendition of peace, love, strength and friendship. Usha Uthup starting with I just called to say I love you and concluding with Stand by me, with them by her side?

 Culture was the catchword at a programme hosted by Balkrishna Dalmia at the Oberoi Grand on Friday night. The cause: a spectacular send-off for US consul-general George Sibley and his talented wife Lee Alison.

 A score gone and many more to go. Thats the count as Calcutta goes into a frenzy to bid farewell to the highest-ranked US diplomat in town (with trade union sympathies!) and his high-profile wife (with Rabindrasangeet sensibilities!).

 Among the party people, the focus this fortnight is clearly on Lee Alison Sibley ? an exponent of the classical arts, a multi-linguist, a teacher of languages and drama, a social activist and, of course, wife of the US consul-general. A soprano singer, having performed in operas like Pippin and Jack and the Beanstalk, she lost little time in immersing herself in Bengali music ? Rabindrasangeet and folk.

 ?As a singer shes spontaneous and has a vast repertoire of classical music. And her fondness for Calcutta has been exhibited over and over again through her rendition of Rabindrasangeet,? says Tanusree Deb, principal of the Calcutta School of Music.

 ?Once you can sing Rabindrasangeet, people here accept you at every level, and youre loved more,? smiles Lee Alison. ?Also, for a musician, where better to be than the cultural capital of India. It was a natural evolution ? a kind of love affair with Calcutta.? And it doesnt end here. She will sing Rabindrasangeet at the Banga Sammelan on July 3 in Manhattan.

 The flood of farewells that started early in April will probably go on till the couple leaves on the morning of May 19. If, at the Netherlands Consulate, a grand event bore testimony to ?all that Lee and her husband have done by inviting musicians, NGO workers, government officials and their friends?, at Taj Bengal, a small but special ladies lunch invariably started off with her favourite ?spinach? dish at Chinoiserie. 

 Then at the Calcutta School of Music, a ?simple breakfast and lots of conversation? is whats in store for ?a strictly non-professional? farewell for ?a dear friend?, says principal Deb. Whats in store next for the darling of Calcuttas social circuit? ?When I get to the US, my friends are going to ask me what happened (looking at my size!) and Im just going to tell them that my friends here just kept feeding me!? she laughs.

 On a more emotional note, she concludes: ?Magical things have happened here. It was my karma to come here. One day, Ill write a book about life in India.?

 Till then, she looks ahead to a life as Senora Sibley, a Spanish teacher in Madagascar.

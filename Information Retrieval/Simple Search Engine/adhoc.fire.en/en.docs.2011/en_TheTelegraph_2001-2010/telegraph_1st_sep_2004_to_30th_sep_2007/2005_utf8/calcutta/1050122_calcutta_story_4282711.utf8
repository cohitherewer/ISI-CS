 Corpus for campus ideas

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board is setting up a Rs 10-crore corpus to incubate ideas emanating from students in various academic institutions across the country. 

 H.K. Mittal, advisor and head of the board, which functions under the aegis of the Union science and technology department, said this in the city on Friday. 

 ?The objective of our department is to encourage entrepreneurship and we are setting up this fund to help students with brilliant ideas,? said Mittal. 

 He was in town to deliver the keynote address at the inaugural session of a six-day workshop, Intuition to Innovation, organised by the Entrepreneurship Development Cell at St Xavier?s College and The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE). 

 The workshop, to continue till January 26, will provide an opportunity for around 40 students from seven city colleges to interact with professionals on a host of issues, ranging from developing business plans to pitching for venture funds.

 ?As an organisation, our objective is to sow the seeds of entrepreneurship. That is why we have tied up with this initiative,? said V.V.R. Babu, president of TiE?s Calcutta chapter. 

 The Silicon Valley-headquartered outfit of Indian professionals operates in various parts of the country and its main objective is to develop entrepreneurship. 

 ?All these years, our focus was on technical and engineering institutes. St Xavier?s is the first undergraduate college where we have set up such a cell and we are very impressed with the response,? said Mittal, adding that there are 34 such ?incubators? across the country.

 The department is drawing up plans to reach other undergraduate campuses and equip the students with the knowhow of entrepreneurship.

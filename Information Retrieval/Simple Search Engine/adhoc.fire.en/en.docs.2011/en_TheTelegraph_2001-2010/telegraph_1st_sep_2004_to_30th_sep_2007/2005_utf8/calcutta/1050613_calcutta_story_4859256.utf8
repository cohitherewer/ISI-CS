 If picking up a diamond or two is on your list of things to do this month, the Nakshatra Utsav that kicked off across the country at leading jewellery stores comes just in time.

 The diamond fiesta is being celebrated as part of the launch of 500 different designs in the Nakshatra diamond jewellery line.

 Starting this year, we have decided to host this festival of Nakshatra diamonds as an annual event, said Premjit Sen of Diamond Trading Company on Saturday.

 Actress Swastika Mukherjee was the first among the women in the city to sample the dazzling designs, unveiling the collection of earrings, pendants, rings and necklaces at the Gol Park outlet of Anjali Jewellers.

 The festival ? also on at stores such as PC Chandra and Senco ? will continue till July 15. This years collection has been inspired by the sun and is called the Surya collection, added Sengputa.

 For early birds who pick up items worth more than Rs 30,000 from the newly-launched line, there is an exclusively-designed Nakshatra sari to be had.

 Uncut sheen

 If ornate jewellery studded with diamonds is what you are looking for, an affordable option that achieves dramatic effect is now at hand.

 Jewel Co, the jewellery store at HHI, is stocking up on period jewellery that flaunts the Victorian look at prices that are attractive.

 The key is in the cut and quality of the stones. The sets, priced between Rs 15,000 and Rs 70,000, are embellished with rose-cut diamonds that are cut on eight sides as opposed to sparkling ones that require far more intricate craftsmanship.

 Because they are cut differently and are yellowish in colour, these diamonds dont have the shine and are priced at much less. But these are perfect for the dull, antique look, explains Pratap Lodha, designer and owner.

 Perfect for weddings and other formal occasions, the silver sets also boast a range of stones like ruby, emerald and sapphire.

 The jewellery is inspired by Mughal and pre-Independence designs. What used to be very popular with the ruling British is now a hit in the West as well, adds Lodha.

 We participated in a jewellery fair in the US last year and the rush for these antique-look pieces was huge, adds his son and co-owner of the decade-old store, Nikunj.

 The jewellery house has been exporting the line to West Asia and Europe as well, reportedly with some success.

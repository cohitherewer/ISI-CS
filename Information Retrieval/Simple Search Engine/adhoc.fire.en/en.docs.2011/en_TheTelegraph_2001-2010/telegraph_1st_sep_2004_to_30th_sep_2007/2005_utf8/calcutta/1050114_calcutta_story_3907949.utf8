 It?s not much of a red-letter day on the Calcutta calendar but you?d better mark it bright on your festive menu.

 Pongal, the three-day harvest festival, is being celebrated at South Indian speciality restaurant Tamarind with treats in store for the adventurous Calcutta foodie. 

 A festive buffet lunch of traditional Pongal delicacies and other non-vegetarian specialities of the house is on offer till January 16 at the 64 Sarat Bose Road address. Chettinad Chicken, Hyderabadi Biryani, Mutton Pepper Fry, Chicken Pepper Fry and Appam are some of the items one can devour for Rs 175 per head. ?We wanted to break the myth that all south Indian food is vegetarian,? said co-owner Shweta Ishaque. 

 Chef Kannan, who comes from a lineage of traditional chefs of Chettinad kitchens, is the man behind the sumptuous spread. The special fare is an integral part of the three-day festival that is held in the month of January when winter is on the wane in south India. Celebrations involve family gatherings and feasting, while the last day is reserved for excursions. 

 The proceeds of an entire day?s sales during the weekend at Tamarind will go towards a tsunami relief fund. 

 Fusion feast 

 Restaurant, bar, lounge, hookah bar, disco ? Fusion at Golden Park is being pitched as a one-stop night haunt where one can start off as early as seven in the evening and continue till wee hours of the morning. And the 9,000-sq-ft plush hangout, expanded on their erstwhile watering hole, London Pub, has now added yet another feature by way of a live Indian kitchen. 

 Wednesday night was a celebration of all things Indian here with an extensive desi menu, special hookah flavours and Indian music to boot. 

 Wednesdays are being dedicated as the women?s night at this hot spot and DJ Sooraj promises to play only ladies? requests for the night, apart from his chosen repertoire of Indian-influenced UK music from the stable of Rishie Rich and Raghav.

 ?We are highlighting Fusion as a family hangout where women feel totally at ease. It?s heartening to see many girls? nights out happening here,? said Ramnik K. Sabharwal, head of sales and marketing, Golden Park. 

 Fusion started off with a live, interactive Chinese kitchen in October last year, but had to come up with an Indian option as well on December 31 owing to popular demand. ?A lot of the family crowd was asking for Indian main course and so even though we were always serving kebabs, we had to come up with an exclusive Indian menu,? shared Ramnik.

 Apart from the usual kebabs, one can start off with Kabuli Paneer Tikka (paneer marinated with walnut paste, cheese, a dash of saffron and cooked in tandoor) or Peshawari Tandoori Aloo (baby potatoes stuffed with cottage cheese, green chilli paste, Indian spice, coated with yoghurt sauce and cooked in a tandoor again). As the drinks start to flow, one can move on to dishes like Chicken Kandahari Kofta (minced chicken balls mixed with Indian spices and cooked in a pomegranate-flavoured gravy) and Lazeez-e-Jhinga (medium-sized prawn cooked in a South Indian gravy). 

 There is an extensive tandoor spread as well, which includes Murg Irani Tikka (chicken chunks coated with cashewnut paste, poppy seeds and yoghurt), Fish Shikanpuri Kebab (minced bekti mixed with Indian spices and almond paste), Mutton Khus Sheekh Kebab (minced mutton marinated with Indian spices, cheese, herbs and coated with onion, tomatoes and yellow capsicum). 

 Starters are priced between Rs 90 and Rs 110, while items in the main course cost Rs 140 to Rs 160 on an average.

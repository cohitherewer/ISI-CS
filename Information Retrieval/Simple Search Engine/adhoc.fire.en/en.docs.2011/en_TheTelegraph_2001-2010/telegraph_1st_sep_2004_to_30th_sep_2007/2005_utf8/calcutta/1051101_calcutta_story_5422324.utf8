 This Kali puja and Diwali, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board has decided to act tough not only with those who produce or sell banned crackers, but also those who burst them.

 Students of the National Institute of Fashion Technology, next door to the board office, got a taste of the toughness on Monday evening, when the pollution monitor lodged a complaint against them with Bidhannagar (South) police station for bursting crackers.

 ?This year, we have decided to be extremely strict with those found using banned firecrackers,? Sudip Banerjee, chairman of the state board, told Metro.

 ?Anybody caught red-handed will immediately be booked under section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Otherwise [read, if the offender manages to give the board the slip], a suitable representative of the premises where the illegal act has been committed will be showcaused,? he added.

 The penalty can be a fine to the tune of a lakh of rupees or a prison term of five years. 

 The last time the board was so active was in 1997, when 12 people were fined for bursting noisy crackers in front of the Salt Lake residence of Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, who had passed a landmark judgment on noise pollution.

 ?We have seen that the noise norms are blatantly violated in several multi-storeyed estates. A representative of such estates will be showcaused by the board as, more often than not, it becomes impossible to nab the offenders by entering the premises,? explained state pollution board chief Banerjee. 

 The noise pollution in the city during Kali puja and Diwali has steadily increased since the late 1990s. That has prompted the board to intensify its vigil this year. 

 ?Fifteen noise-monitoring teams will patrol the city, Salt Lake and Howrah. The number of teams has nearly been doubled compared to the previous years,? stated Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the board and the high court-appointed special officer in charge of noise pollution control.

 The board?s control room will remain open up to midnight, till Thursday, for registering complaints regarding use of banned crackers as well as loudspeakers. 

 The control room phone numbers are 23358212 and 23353913. The toll-free number is 16003453390.

 ?I hope the promises of the board do not remain mere lip service,? said environment activist Subhas Dutta. ?Increased board vigilance, increased public awareness and community monitoring will be needed to effectively tackle the problem,? he opined.

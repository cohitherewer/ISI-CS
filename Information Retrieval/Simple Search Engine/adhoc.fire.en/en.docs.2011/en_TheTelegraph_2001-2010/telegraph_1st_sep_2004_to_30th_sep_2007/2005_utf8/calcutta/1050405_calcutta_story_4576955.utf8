The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Ravindra Jain: Turn around 

 Uma Thurman?s Bride is back for some more blood. No, we aren?t talking about Kill Bill 3, although there is a possibility of Quentin Tarantino getting Daryl Hannah?s character of Elle back for another movie mayhem. Kill Bill 2, already out on DVDs and CDs, will be shown on Zee Studio later this month.

 The build-up to the television premiere has been planned with a lot of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the main cast and crew. In the second part to Tarantino?s ?roaring rampage of revenge?, we get to see Bill for the first time, played by martial arts legend David Carradine.

 Also in the line of fire of the Bride (you do get to know her real name finally) in Kill Bill 2 will be Michael Madsen?s Budd and Hannah?s Elle. Gordon Liu, who played a bit role in part one, plays the brilliant Pai Mei. More verbose than visual, the film has a brilliant finale, the final chapter ?Face to Face?, where the Bride and Bill fight a war of words before using their hands. Shot by Aviator?s Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson, Kill Bill 2 is an absolute must watch!

David Carradine plays Bill in Kill Bill 2: Cool cut

 The two-day short trip early this week was meant to promote musical talent among the visually-challenged. But for Bollywood composer Ravindra Jain, it was the rare chance for a trip down memory lane. ?I have lived in this city for nine years. My home used to be near the banks of the Ganga in Bagbazar? Amar mon pore thake ekhane,? said Jain in fluent Bengali. 

 The man who scored hit tracks for films like Chitchor was dragged towards Bengal by his love of Rabindrasangeet. ?While doing my graduation at Aligarh University, I used to hear a lot of Rabindrasangeet and then decided to come to Bengal in 1960,? said Jain. He migrated to Mumbai in 1969.

 Also on the Calcutta agenda was meeting up with old friends for whom he has composed lyrics and scored music on several occasions. ?Nirmala Misra, Arati Mukhopadhyay, Shipra Basu, Madhuri Chattopadhyay and Haimanti (Shukla)? I have worked with all of them. In fact, Aratidi had first taken me to HMV in the mid-60s, where I recorded my songs,? reminisced Jain, who is currently busy penning the dance ballet Amrapali for Jaya Prada.

Shyamalan with Bryce Dallas Howard: Back together

 Finally, some good music on MTV. The channel will provide its viewers exclusive access to a concert by one of the hottest bands of today, Coldplay. The British band will premiere songs from its eagerly awaited third album X amp;Y in a one-hour concert on June 5, the night before the album?s international release.

 The show itself, however, will be recorded this month at a ?secret venue? in London and will feature songs from the new album, including the new single Speed of sound and other Coldplay classics. MTV will also air a 30-minute special All Eyes on Coldplay where major artistes ask the band about the making of the album and its forthcoming world tour.

 Some of the MTV channels are running a competition to give fans a chance to attend the shoot in London. ?It?s really cool that fans are flying in from all over the world to see us play for MTV in London next month,? Coldplay frontman Chris Martin said about the event. ?We?ll try and make it worth their effort.?

 From the Elders in The Village to the Lady in the Water. From Disney to Warner Brothers. M. Night Shyamalan?s on a new spook trip. 

 ?We couldn?t be more pleased to be working with Night on this project,? said Alan Horn, president of Warner Bros. ?Lady in the Water will be a major event movie for us; I hope that it is the first of many outstanding films that Night makes at our studio.?

 Written by Shyamalan himself and produced by Blinding Edge Pictures, Lady in the Water will be shot in Philadelphia, where the Pondicherry-born has made all of his movies. It follows the superintendent of an apartment building who finds a rare type of sea nymph swimming in the apartment pool.

 According to president of production, Warner Bros. Pictures, Jeff Robinov: ?Lady in the Water combines modern fantasy with Night?s well-known brand of artistry and suspense. It?s both an expansion of everything that audiences already love about Night?s movies and an exciting departure from its predecessors.? 

 Responded Shyamalan: ?Since we met a few years ago, Alan and Jeff have gone out of their way to offer me the best on their studio slates time after time. I felt their personal connection to my movies. Lady in the Water is a personal movie with a big idea and it seems just perfect for Warner Bros. I?m thrilled they responded to the story and we all can?t wait to get started.?

 Casting is underway and Ron Howard?s daughter Bryce Dallas Howard who made a sparkling debut in The Village is slated to play the lead again. Production is set to begin in August 2005, for release on July 21, 2006.

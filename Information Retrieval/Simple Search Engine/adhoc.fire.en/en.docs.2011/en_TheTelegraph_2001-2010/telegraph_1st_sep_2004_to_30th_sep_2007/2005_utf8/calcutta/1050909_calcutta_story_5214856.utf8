 Fight fever, tarry for tests

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Raju Shaw stood by the door of the male ward of the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, pleading for help from all those who entered. His 18-year-old son Bablu lay bleeding inside, jostling for space with others like him. 

 Bablu was brought to the hospital on Thursday morning in a critical condition. He was shifted from Bhatpara State General Hospital after he started bleeding through his anus. The doctors suspected haemorrhagic dengue. They drew his blood for tests, prescribed pills and asked him to wait.

 Across the city, an ever-increasing number of patients and their kin were made to wait in the same manner ? at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, National Medical College and Hospital, School of Tropical Medicine... 

 The doctors said there was little else they could do, until the blood reports of the patients were available. But that was small comfort for the patients and their relatives, to whom the delay seemed interminable. 

 ?Are you a doctor? Can you save my child? He has been bleeding since morning and I don?t know what to do. They gave him a pill, took his blood and asked us to wait,? the relatives harangued passersby, in much the same manner as Raju.

 His son, a student of Class X, developed a high fever on Sunday night. He was taken to private practitioners, but their medication did not have any effect. Before long, Bablu had to be shifted to Bhatpara hospital from his Kakinara home.

 On Thursday morning, he was moved to Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, with the referral card reading ?better management, please?. Failing to hold his patience, Raju is now exploring options to get his son?s blood test done in a private clinic. 

 Other parents, too, are irked by the facilities offered at the hospitals. ?My son has to share a trolley with another patient on a passageway. His blood sample was sent for tests three days ago, but the results haven?t yet arrived. The doctors hardly visit the ward and we are totally in the dark. The child is running a very high fever and is losing consciousness frequently,? said Saswati Das, mother of eight-year-old Ranajit. He is admitted in the paediatric ward of National Medical College and Hospital. 

 At the School of Tropical Medicine, a serpentine queue of patients formed as the authorities pleaded helplessness in diagnosing and treating dengue. ?We had sent several blood samples for tests yesterday, but the results are not yet in because the testing kits have been exhausted. It will be between four and seven days before the results to come in,? said a doctor at National Medical College and Hospital.

 He added: ?Moreover, the authorities of Indian Council of Medical Research have informed us that they will only test blood drawn from patients who have had fever for more than four days. But patients who have suffered from fever for only a day are thronging the hospital. Due to the pressure, the test reports have also become unreliable.?

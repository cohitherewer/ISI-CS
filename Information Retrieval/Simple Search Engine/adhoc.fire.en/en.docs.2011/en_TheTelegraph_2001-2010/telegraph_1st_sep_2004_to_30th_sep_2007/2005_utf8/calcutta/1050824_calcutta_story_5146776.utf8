 Music instruments, huge square thick-rimmed shades, bandanas, baggy shirts and bellbottoms? Hippie fashion is back and so are the Hippies. Not the way we remember them, but as the Hip-Hop kind, adorning ashtrays, penholders and as showpieces too. 

 With thickened lips, outfits in vibrant splashes of red, green, yellow, lilac and blue, bare feet, red slippers or brown boots and colourfully knitted Santa caps, these happy-go-lucky tiny figures are seen smoking and drinking away to glory. 

 Made of polyresin, these Hip-Hop Hippies look more like hardcore music stars with some playing the guitar, some beating the drum, some with the accordion and others blowing the trumpet. 

 Shades, long hair and sideburns add to that retro glam look and feel.

 The range of Hippie goodies is imported and is being lapped up by all age groups. While oldies relate to the bygone days, youngsters love the spirit of freedom. Not only as gift items, many go for this range to add that extra zing to their home d?cor, says a spokesperson for Nik Nish. 

 Apart from rock stars, the range of showpieces includes happy Hippies carrying fruits and flower baskets. 

 These funky figurines come in an assortment of ashtrays, penholders, other stationery holders and CD holders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rollick recipe with rhyme, rhythm

 Tiny tots and teenagers, brainy and the bubbly relished the spotlight at various Children rsquo;s Day events across the city and at an inter-college fest. Young Metro caught up with some of the action...

 On the first day of Umang rsquo;05, the annual inter-college fest of Bhawanipur College, organised in association with The Telegraph, students tried hard to grab the top spot, with the girls wooing judge Jeet and the boys judge Sayantani. Later in the evening, participants in Mockband mimicked their favourite music bands and singers. The fest is on till November 20 (Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).

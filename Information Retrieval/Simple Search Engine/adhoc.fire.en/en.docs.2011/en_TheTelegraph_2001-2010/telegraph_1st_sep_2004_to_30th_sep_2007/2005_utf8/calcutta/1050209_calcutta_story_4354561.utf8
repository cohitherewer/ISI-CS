 Photo hunt in Bihar for kidnap pilot

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Salt Lake was his key area of operation for the past few years. But Arvind Bhai, who led the team that abducted Roma Jhawar last Friday, has also operated extensively across Calcutta, as found by CID sleuths working on the case.

 ?We have collected his photograph from Calcutta Police and handed it over to the CID team to facilitate its search across parts of Chhapra district in Bihar,? said R.K. Mohanty, additional director-general of police (CID).

 A smooth operator in his late 30s, Arvind Bhai ? as he is popularly known ? was earlier instrumental in a string of motorcycle thefts and even a dacoity in CF block.

 Police claim that besides Salt Lake, Arvind was often holed up at an associate?s place in Bagha Jatin, south Calcutta.

 Going by police records, Arvind was earlier arrested in connection with a robbery but was granted bail. Since then, he has been shuttling between Bihar and Bengal, carrying out acts of crime here and disappearing there.

 On every occasion, Arvind would hire a new team and leave after squaring up their dues. 

 Among gang members that carried out the abduction of Roma Jhawar from near her Salt Lake residence, Pappu and Kallu were direct recruits of Arvind, who had also supplied the firearms.

 Sleuths are interrogating Gunjan to find out more about Arvind?s contacts in Salt Lake and Bagha Jatin.

 Even while negotiating with the Jhawars, Gunjan used Arvind to make the ransom calls in Hindi.

 Arvind?s first call, apparently, was meant to strike terror in the home of the kidnap victim. ?Agar rupiya nahin mila to ladki ko instalment mein bhejengey (If we do not get the money, we will send the girl back, piece by piece),? Arvind had allegedly barked into the mobile phone.

 This was a deliberate ploy by Gunjan to rattle the Jhawars and force them into coughing up the ransom amount without seeking police help.

 Arvind and two others involved in the abduction continue to elude the police net, but the CID is confident of submitting a chargesheet in the case within 10 days. 

 ?By then, we should be able to get him (Arvind),? said a senior CID officer.

 Besides scouting for Arvind with his photograph in hand, the CID has also got in touch with the Bihar police brass, seeking their help to track him down and gather additional information about him from some of his gang members arrested in Bihar.

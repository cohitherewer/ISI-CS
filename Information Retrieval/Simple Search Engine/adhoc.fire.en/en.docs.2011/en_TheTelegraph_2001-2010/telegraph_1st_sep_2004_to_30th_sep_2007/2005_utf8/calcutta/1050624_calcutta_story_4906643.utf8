 With Bengal firmly on the radar of the new economy knowledge companies planning their next round of expansion, supply of IT workspace is seeing a spurt in the city?s tech township.

 State IT minister Manab Mukherjee on Thursday formally unveiled the latest address, Globsyn Crystals.

 A joint venture between Globsyn Technologies and real estate players Sureka and Shrachi groups, the project envisages creating over 600,000 sq ft of workspace in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec). 

 ?In the next 24 months, around 13.3 million sq ft of IT workspace will be created in the tech town. The interest among developers to create infrastructure in advance is an indication of the future of IT industry in the state,? said Mukherjee.

 The facility, with an approximate investment of Rs 150 crore, will come up in Sector V on a 2.5-acre plot and will provide workspace for around 5,000 to 6,000 people.

 From food courts to malls and digital theatres to yoga centres, the facility billed to be the ?new office of tomorrow? would integrate various life-enriching services.

 ?This is a new concept and it is driven by the growing need to merge technology with people?s lives. It will be a habitat and will fulfil aspirations of people working in the complex. This will, in effect, reduce the rate of attrition, a major concern area for the IT and IT-enabled services companies,? said Bikram Dasgupta, chairman, Globsyn Technologies. 

 Commenting on the concerns from a section of developers about supply of IT workspace outstripping demand, Dasgupta said he was confident about the building getting the right kind of occupants and facilitating the IT industry?s dream run in the state.

 According to one of the first home-grown IT-preneurs, who gave the city its first intelligent building, Infinity, in Saltlec, an infrastructure like Globsyn Crystals will help strengthen bonding between employees and the workplace. 

 The project, which will also include built-in training facilities and offer a host of fun and learning options to the family of those working in the set-up, will be implemented by December 2007.

 ?It will be a solution to the problem of unstable growth in the industry,? said Dasgupta, while explaining the unique proposition of his latest venture in association with Pradeep Sureka of the Sureka Group and Rahul Todi of the Shrachi Group.

 State IT secretary G.D. Gautama also stressed the need to arrest the rate of attrition to facilitate growth of the IT and IT-enabled services industry. 

 ?Estimates suggest that training cost per employee is around Rs 60,000 and if the companies continue incurring these costs, business suffers. Besides, the clients also get fed up with frequent manpower turnover. The industry must tackle this issue by using innovative ways,? summed up Gautama.

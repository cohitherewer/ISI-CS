 Lack of law fuels tree trim

 Illegal felling of trees has become rampant because of the absence of a law to deal with the offenders. 

 The state government, for the past eight years, has been sitting on a high court order asking for a law to stop the practice, which has been causing untold damage to the urban environment.

 A bench of Justice Gitesh Ranjan Bhattacharjee and Justice Nure Alam Chowdhury had directed the state government in 1998 to enact a comprehensive law as early as possible to stop illegal felling of trees in non-forest areas.

 ?The government should consider the matter promptly and with the due seriousness it deserves,? the judges had observed.

 Asked about the government?s response, forest minister Jogesh Barman said: ?We are planning to introduce a non-forest area bill in the Assembly soon. The Supreme Court, too, has passed a similar order.? 

 The bill, however, is not likely to be placed in the coming session of the Assembly in July. ?We have to take up the issue with the land and land reforms department and the department of environment. But we are working sincerely. We may introduce it in the winter session,? Barman told Metro.

 At present, a person booked under the Indian Forest Act is liable to serve a prison term of up to seven years. ?But the Act is applicable only in the forest areas. There is no such Act for non-forest areas,? Barman added. 

 State pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee, too, felt that a law should be enacted immediately to stop rampant illegal felling of trees in the city and elsewhere.

 Exploiting the situation, shanty-dwellers along VIP Road have chopped off a large number of trees on either side of the thoroughfare. 

 ?Our estimate is that more than 300 large and medium trees had been felled on the flanks of VIP Road,? said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the pollution control board.

 Illegal felling is also rampant on some stretches of EM Bypass, especially between Jadavpur and Garia. ?We are helpless because we can?t punish the offenders,? Mukherjee rued.

 Sources said the board had stopped issuing permits for felling trees in the city and its adjoining areas in North and South 24-Parganas. 

 ?Around 30 applications are pending with us. Each is being examined at the micro level,? Mukherjee said.

 The board issues a permit for felling trees on the basis of the forest department?s recommendation. 

 The department, however, has cleared all 30 cases.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?It will be difficult to play him opposite him?

 After his debut in James, MOHIT AHLAWAT is set to be Jai in Ram Gopal Varma rsquo;s remake of Sholay with Amitabh Bachchan as Gabbar. Pratim D. Gupta spoke to the most-hyped debutant from the Factory

 Mohit Ahlawat with James leading lady Nisha Kothari 

 Ram Gopal Varma calls you his biggest discovery. Why?

 That?s a very difficult question for me to answer. I think it?s the whole of me that he is talking about.

 When did the acting bug first bite you?

 I am not from Mumbai. My dad was into the export business which is a completely different background compared to something like films. I used to watch a lot of movies, though, and like all kinds of films. I honestly didn?t know what I wanted to do in life till I came to Mumbai. I was around 19 or 20 then. Once here, I have always wanted to become an actor.

 Where did he spot you?

 Around three-and-a-half years back, I walked into Mr Varma?s office with my pictures. He saw the pictures and asked me not to work outside his company and promised to make a film with me. That was from where James took off.

 James took a lot of time to be made. Were you feeling stifled, not trying your luck outside the Factory?

 I was getting frustrated but I also knew that I was working with a big name and banner. The reason why James took such a lot of time to be made is because, I guess, he wanted to make the film very carefully. Also, director Rohit Jugraj, who is a very young man, took a lot of care to make the movie.

 What is James all about?

 It?s about this guy from Goa who comes to Mumbai. Thereon, it?s about how the city reacts to him and how he reacts to the city.

 Is it a truckload of sex and violence as the promos on television promise?

 I would call James an action film. Violence is different from action. As far as sex goes, whatever you have seen in the promos is only limited to the songs.

 Did you have to work on your physique for the role?

 Not really. I have been working out for the last eight years or so. I was very fat before that. So I started working out to get into shape. As for homework for the role, all I did was some acting workshops by one of Mr Varma?s assistants who used to visit my place.

 What about your method of acting?

 I just go into a situation believing that I am the character I am playing. That?s it. I don?t believe in method acting and all.

 Most of Ram Gopal Varma?s discoveries like Manoj Bajpai, Vivek Oberoi, Randeep Hooda have played negative characters in their debuts. Not so with you?

 When Mr Varma saw my pictures for the first time, he wanted me to play a negative character. But when I went to him with a different set of snaps, he himself asked me never to play a negative character in my life.

 What was your reaction when he cast you as Jai in his Sholay?

 I was very happy. It was just like a dream come true for me. Sholay has been my all-time favourite film.

 And Amitabh Bachchan will be playing Gabbar?

 I know. I am a very big Bachchan fan. It will be very difficult to play him opposite him. I have to work very hard.

 What else?

 I will do another Ram Gopal Varma production called King, the details of which I can?t divulge at this stage except for the fact that I play a positive role there as well. And I am also slated to do a film for my cousin, Bhushan Kumar of T-Series.

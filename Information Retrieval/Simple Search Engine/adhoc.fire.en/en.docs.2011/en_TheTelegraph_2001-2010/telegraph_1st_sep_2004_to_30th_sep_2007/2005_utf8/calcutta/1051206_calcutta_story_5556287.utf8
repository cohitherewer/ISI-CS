The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fakes flood tech market

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA

 The next time your laptop dies on you without warning, blame it on the batteries you bought from the market recently. 

 The city is flooded with fake consumables, which police believe will pose a big problem in the next few months, unless tackled immediately. 

 Despite poor facilities, the enforcement wing and legal metrology department have stepped up vigil. With complaints pouring in from people who are being conned every other day, one cannot be sure about the genuineness of goods sold in neighbourhood outlets. 

 ?The consumables used in the IT sector are being duplicated. These include cartridges of printers, batteries for laptops and a computer system. We had warned all the dealers associated with COMPASS (an association of the computer dealers in eastern India) about this. Unless this trend is checked, it will spell disaster for the entire hardware industry,? said a COMPASS spokesman.

 According to COMPASS officers, in the past three months, four complaints were received from customers to the effect that several dealers registered with them were selling spurious products bearing tags of reputed brands. 

 ?We spoke to the dealers and warned them. But some of them said they themselves were being duped, as they could not distinguish between the fake and original items,? the officer said. 

 ?We are aware that several articles used in the IT sector are turning out to be fakes. We are organising regular raids and seizing these products, but unless the trader bodies or the duped customers come forward, it is difficult to take action. Once we receive a complaint, we will definitely take action,? said S.K. Pujari, deputy commissioner of police (enforcement branch). 

 According to enforcement branch officers, computer hard disks are faked by passing one with lower access speed for a higher one. Access speed ? rounds per minute ? determines the price.

 ?On products like multimedia cards, labels depicting higher storage capacities are pasted. The fake batteries, mostly rechargeable, look almost like the original ones but are not effective enough to work expensive gadgets like laptops,? said an enforcement branch officer.

 Officers of the legal metrology department, on the other hand, say some leading IT goods dealers are deliberately duping customers. ?If they realise that a customer is not familiar with the product, they try to dupe them. We had raided a reputed shop in Ultadanga and one at Chandni Chowk last month,? said an assistant controller of the legal metrology.

 ?We don?t have adequate training to check technical items. Moreover, we also do not have enough legal power to tackle these types of problems,? the assistant controller pointed out.

 Pious effusion: Local residents gather around 

the rath at Savarna Ray Choudhury boro bari 

The apprehension of the authorities of some English-medium 

city schools that illiterate guardians are lowering their standards is misplaced 

(Admission-time test in English for parents, July 18). On the contrary, these 

schools have failed miserably in discharging their social obligation to the cause 

of education by demanding hefty tuition fees and other charges. Now, they are 

gearing up to restrict admission of students who are guilty of not being born 

to parents fluent in English. 

 The argument that children whose parents are not well-educated will not be academically adept borders on the ridiculous. The veiled implication is that the doors of the schools will be shut to the economically weak who aspire to pursue English education. 

 There are instances galore of children from underprivileged backgrounds excelling in the pursuit of education. As the board examination results of the past few years show, students from far-flung areas are as likely to top as the products of the best city schools. Merit is not the monopoly of the elite. Often, penury does not translate into dearth of brain power. 

 What the English-medium school authorities need is dedicated teachers. They cannot shrug off their responsibility and shift the entire burden of bringing up children on parents. 

 A student spends more than six hours in school and proper contribution from the teachers is sufficient to steer him or her clear of hurdles. Schools are the ideal places to brush up communicative English. My daughter studied at De Nobili School, Maithon, where students were barred from speaking in any language except English. Those who used any other language were fined Re 1. During my daughter?s school days I had to cough up a heavy fine, however, with a wonderful return. This can be tried in every institution. 

Subhankar Mukherjee,

Borehat, Burdwan. 

I read the articles ?Chariots of fervour?, July 9 and ?A rare legacy of records?, July 19, with immense interest. They got my special attention as our family resided in the area for 25 years (1950-75). During childhood and adolescence, I had been closely associated with the festivals of the Savarna Ray Choudhurys ? Puja, dolyatra, rathayatra, shivratri etc. The events were held at the mejobari and barobari of the ?first family? of Calcutta. The vindication of their efforts to set the records straight was gratifying. The person who led the attempt, Gorachand Ray Choudhury, was my classmate in Barisha High School (1951-57). 

 The Saborno Sangrahalaya is a worthy effort. I hope more articles are written on the legacy of the family.

When so much noise is being made about preserving the heritage of Calcutta, why are trams, which are an integral part of the city?s tradition, being neglected (Turf tussle lines death tracks, July 13)? More road space is blocked by unauthorised parking of goods vehicles than by trams. A thought should also be spared for the aged and infirm, who find it easier to commute by tram. 

Moumita Nandi,

Behala.

Apropos the report ?State mulls Bill to protect its trees?, July 14, as the number of trees in the city is rapidly decreasing due to illegal cutting and trimming, it is high time to introduce the Bill. 

Sourish Misra, 

Salt Lake .

Shift of the BBD Bag bus stand becomes a talking point whenever beautification or reorganisation of the area is considered (Progress pitch, upgrade demand, July 21). The stand is an island of order amidst a sea of chaos. Instead, time and energy should be spent on improving the aesthetic and utilitarian side of the bus stand and surroundings. An underground parking facility may be considered. 

K.B. Goswami,

Salt Lake. 

Apropos the report ?Hoodwink operation in hospital?, July 14, it was most unbecoming of the state health department to attempt to fool the Medical Council of India inspectors. The con job is not only denying patients the facility that they deserve, but is also ensuring that there are vital gaps in the education of the medical students at SSKM. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

Though hoodwinking is nothing new in West Bengal?s 

shabby healthcare system, the manner in which the SSKM hospital?s ENT department 

was able to con the inspectors from Medical Council of India is remarkable indeed 

(?Ruse of missing morgue?, July 15). It is astonishing that putting a ?makeshift 

signboard? on a ?rundown building? could deceive the seasoned inspectors from 

the central regulatory authority for education and practice of medicine in India. 

Kunal Saha, 

Ohio, USA. 

Apropos the report ?Will Calcutta follow Kiev ? sack the cops to stem the graft??, July 21, it common to see policemen extorting money on one pretext or the other in full view of the public. The roots of corruption have spread in the various government departments. If Calcutta were to indeed follow Kiev, the majority of the public servants, and not just cops, would have to be sacked. 

A.S. Mehta, 

New Alipore.

If people in the heart of a city can go on a witch hunt, one shudders to think of the state of things in remote areas (?Witch tag on neighbour?, July 18). 

Hara Lal Chakraborty,

Arabinda Nagar.

The picture published on August 10 (Girl in sick bay goes unnoticed) was taken without our knowledge and permission from outside the school premise, violating our privacy. The caption demeans us ? the sisters of the convent ? especially by using a term like ?huddle? to describe our private interaction. We take strong objection to the report alleging that the student was ?locked in?! The sick bay is a school convenience especially provided to take care of students who fall ill. The student was taken there so that she could rest before she went home. 

Sister Smitha Thomas,

Principal, 

Our Lady Queen of the Missions School,

Salt Lake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Sunil Sen

 Proprietor, Jagat cinema (Sealdah)

 I am in no position to comment on how who should run his business. I have heard multiplexes charge about Rs 100, while some single-screen theatres like Paradise charge Rs 70-75. My highest ticket rate is Rs 30, that too for a few special seats. The majority of my 777 seats falls in the Rs 20 and Rs 16 categories, while the lowest rate is Rs 12.80. I am running a new release as well (Chand sa Roshan Chehra). My collections have been a paltry Rs 26,000 in three days. A full house can fetch at best Rs 36,000 for four shows in a day. It is true that I do not have an air-conditioner, but with 60 fans and two blowers it is not uncomfortable. I have changed 650 seats just a few years ago. The power bill comes to about Rs 30,000 a month. If I instal an AC, it will shoot up to Rs 1-1.5 lakh. Where will this money come from? About 20 halls have shut down between Moulali and Shyambazar trying to fight TV serials and video cassettes. I too might be forced to do so. If multiplexes can sell popcorn at Rs 20, charge so much more than us and attract rich youngsters, all the best to them.

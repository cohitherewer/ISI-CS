The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lapping up luxury

Pratim D. Gupta, Himika Chaudhuri

After 

luxury cars, it?s time for luxury cakes. Calcutta?s ?only tearoom? has just launched 

an entire new range of cakes that aims to give the city a new international taster. 

Sinful but sumptuous, the luxury line at Flurys includes everything from cheese 

cakes to meringue tortes.

 Conceived and executed by the entire Flurys team of chefs, the new bakes will be available in both cake and pastry formats. ?We are calling them luxury cakes because the ingredients going into their making are the best in the world,? claims chef Vikas Chouhan. ?You may get them at the five-star hotel cake shops but not at any other confectionery. In that way, Flurys is a first.?

 Topping the list of new cakes is the irresistible Sasha Torte, a rich and dense chocolate and almond sponge, layered with apricot preserve and topped off with rich dark chocolate truffle.

There?s a slice of Italy in the Choccomaretti Tiramisu 

straight from the Torrone region of the boot-shaped nation ? marzipan sponge layered 

with bitter chocolate, amaretti truffle and coffee mousse. 

 The American beauty is the New York-style baked Deep Forest Cheesecake, topped with fruits. And if you are not counting your calories, dig into the Triple Chocolate Passion, a cake with three layers of dark, milk and white chocolate mousse. 

 The luxury cakes have been priced at around Rs 400 per pound, while the pastries come for around Rs 50-60 each. 

 ?Now that we are settling down after the maddening New Year launch, we are innovating with our cakes and bakes,? says master chef Shaun Kenworthy, almost unrecognisable in a black (colour of the season) chef?s suit. ?It?s time for Calcutta to get a taste of the world,? says Shaun.

 Glitter grabs

 It took jewellery designer Varda Goenka just about three years to launch her third outlet in the city. Her now popular brand Diagold has got yet another home, this time in Sumangal on Lee Road, next to Vaibhav Plaza. 

 The other two are in Metro Plaza and City Centre. With the formal opening taking place on February 13, Friday morning was a relaxed exhibition of Varda?s contemporary designs as well as some Italian jewellery at her plush 1,800-sq-feet jewellery boutique. 

 ?We wanted to provide a good shopping experience for our clients,? says Varda. 

 Since the Diagold outlets at Metro Plaza and City Centre do not support personalised attention because of space constraint, this is where the designer hopes to indulge in custom-made jewellery and wedding jewellery designed in sync with the bridal outfit. ?A back-end workshop and computer-graphic designing facilities make custom designing easy here,? adds Varda. 

 The range of jewellery available here retains the essential style of the designer. ?Cocktail rings are doing very well at this store already, as are earrings,? says Varda.

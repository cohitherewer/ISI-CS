 Rights cry to home ouster

 A STAFF REPORTER

Mokhter Sheikh, 27, an inmate of Kishalay, the 

home for destitute children in Barasat, attempted suicide earlier this month. 

He stabbed himself in the belly to protest the authorities? decision to ask all 

inmates over 18 to leave the home.

 The incident has prompted the state human rights commission to ask the home?s superintendent and principal secretary of the state social welfare department for reports regarding the matter. 

 ?We will conduct an inquiry and submit a report shortly. The upper-age limit of the home is 18, so all over-age inmates had been asked to leave,? said a senior government official.

 He added that inmates are asked to look for alternative accommodation after they turn 18. The maximum time given to them is three years.

 ?At 21, they are expected to leave. If they don?t, we serve them an ultimatum. They cannot occupy slots that should be given to boys more in need of food and shelter,? he asserted.

 According to the official, seven of the inmates asked to leave were married and have families outside the home.

 ?They used the home throughout the day as a shelter and to get free food, and went to their families at night. It was sheer exploitation,? the official said. 

 One of the boys used to work in another home, Dhruvashram. ?He was in a position to leave, but wouldn?t because of free food and shelter. This could not be tolerated,? he explained. 

 The official added that the government would make sure that these facts are communicated to the commission in the report. ?Officials would visit the home and write in the report what they see. The commission would also be told how over-age youths were using the home.? 

 Social welfare department secretary S.N. Haque said: ?I have received the letter from the state human rights commission. I will conduct an inquiry and submit the report.?

 The home authorities had asked 33 youths to leave in June 2004. Only eight had left by January. The following month, the Kishalay authorities issued an ultimatum. The youths were ousted by police soon after.

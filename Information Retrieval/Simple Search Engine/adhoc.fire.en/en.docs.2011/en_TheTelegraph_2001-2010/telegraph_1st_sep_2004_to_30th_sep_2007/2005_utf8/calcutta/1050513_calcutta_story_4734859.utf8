 Chit Ch@t 

 Dream a little dream 

 From now on, Jui will remember May 7 as a red-letter day. For on that day, last Saturday, Rudraprasad Sengupta not only answered her probing questions on theatre in detail, but also blessed her inquisitive soul with a fatherly kiss on the forehead. For the student of Class VIII, who is also a theatre enthusiast, this is nothing short of a dream. 

 Of late, Rudraprasad Sengupta has spent a lot of his time attracting young people to theatre. He has even worked with the children of slum dwellers and pavement dwellers. More recently, he has started visiting schools to interact with students on theatre. 

 This was one of those visits, jointly organised by Samatat, a theatre group of Uttarpara, and the office of the sub-divisional information and culture officer, Serampore. The venue was Serampore Girls? High School, a 125-year-old institution in the historic town. 

 The topic of Sengupta?s speech was ?Role of theatre in education?. Being the master that he is, the veteran actor generated a lot of drama, also imparting education in the process. He didn?t just deliver his speech, he acted it. If he was a mother one minute, he became a loud-mouthed politician the next. 

 Sengupta blamed his own generation for failing to change the ?clerk-producing? education of the British into a progressive one. ?True education first develops one?s love for his locality, then for his country and finally for the whole world. We have failed to provide that education even after the end of British rule in 1947,? he declared. 

 Today?s education, according to him, teaches isolation and sparks off a rat race. Hence, so much tension, and therefore, so many suicides by students. Here lies the importance of theatre. ?Theatre is an art form based on the principle of synchronisation. It is the only art form which has a flesh-and-blood existence for the spectator. Just as the teacher has for the students,? the maestro explained. 

 The rapt attention of the impressionable minds while Sengupta was speaking proved that even at the age of 71, a master actor can mesmerise an audience without make-up, lights or stage props. All said and done, a large amount of praise is due for the students of Serampore Girls? High School, too. Their questions showed maturity beyond years. 

 Even Sengupta was stunned when Jui asked for a definition of a well-educated human being. Poulomi, a Madhyamik candidate, went one step further. She complained of the deteriorating standard of Bengali theatre, and asked how bad dramas can impart good education. 

 At the outset, Rudraprasad Sengupta had said that he dreamt of a happy world in his youth. That world was never built. ?But I really believe that through your efforts, that world will be built one day. That is why I keep coming to you,? he told the students. Having met those intelligent girls, the septuagenarian does not seem to be daydreaming.

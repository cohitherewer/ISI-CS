The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beyond fusion

 A one-of-a-kind musical concert that melodiously synthesizes the strains of Hindustani classical music with a whole range of Western musical forms, This Is Not Fusion goes beyond ordinary fusion music to witness a genuine marriage between contrasting cadences, styles, genres and musical legacies. The brainchild of author and vocalist Amit Chaudhuri, the progamme is not merely a physical meeting-point of the traditions of Western and Indian music. Rather, it is an attempt to move towards a common conceptual musical space where diverse musical lineages intersect and coalesce to give birth to a new musical form enriched by the influence of both traditions. Evoking the structural similarities between ragas and rock melodies, Indian folk tunes and their Western counterparts, the performance seamlessly merges two different sets of musical notes to create a new musical language and idiom. Accompanying Chaudhuri (vocals) in this evening?s performance is Amyt Datta (guitar), Debabrata Mitra (piano), Mainak Nag Chowdhury (bass) and Mayookh Bhaumik (tabla).

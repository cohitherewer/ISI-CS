The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Local rancour Left anchor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?Since the Trinamul Congress has no vote bank here, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has done nothing for us in the past five years,? complained Abdur Alam, resident of Merry Road Bylane in Garden Reach, borough 15.

 And this ? the voters? resentment ? is what the Left Front has armed its campaign warhead with. The party is going all out to bag the nine wards (133-141) in the borough. 

 In the last election, six wards went to the CPM, two to the Congress and one to an Independent. The Congress and the Independent later joined the Trinamul-led board.

 ?The people in this part of the city are disillusioned with Subrata Mukherjee?s board as it has done absolutely nothing for the area during its five-year tenure,? said Niranjan Chatterjee, CPM poll coordinator in the borough. 

 ?Besides, the pre-poll fracas between Mamata Banerjee and the mayor, and the formation of the Unnayan Congress Mancha, have stoked people?s antagonism towards the Trinamul. So, there?s no reason why we should not get all the seats here,? he added.

 Of the nine wards, the CPM has fielded candidates in seven and the CPI in two. Of the seven CPM candidates, all but one are sitting councillors. 

 In the last election, the Trinamul did not win a single seat from the borough. Poll experts feel the party is in no better position this time, either.

 ?More than 65 per cent of the voters in the borough are Muslims and they will think twice before voting for Mamata Banerjee?s party because of its alliance with the BJP,? said a political commentator. 

 Ashesh Ghosh, BJP candidate in ward 133, admitted that it would be ?difficult to win?.

 Another issue the Left Front is highlighting is the ?unreliability? of the Opposition candidates. ?In the last election, two Congress candidates who won from the borough defected to the Trinamul and helped the party form the board. The Independent, too, did the same. The voters have not forgotten the treachery,? said CPM candidate from ward 138 Iqbal Hossain Gazi, also chairman of the borough committee.

 On the question of development, CPM election coordinator Chatterjee said: ?The board had sanctioned only Rs 31 crore as budgetary allocation for the borough till 2004. Even that amount was not utilised fully. Only Rs 20 crore was spent. Apart from treating parts of Garden Reach Road with mastic asphalt, the board has done nothing for us.?

 Sheikh Abdul Latif, a resident of ward 138 (Battala), complained that waterlogging was a chronic problem in his neighbourhood. 

 ?My bedroom remains submerged in water for almost the entire duration of monsoon,? he said. Apart from ward 138, the problem persists, in varying degrees, in wards 139 (Kilkhana), 140 (Battala) and 141 (Badartala).

 Another problem plaguing the residents is an acute shortage of drinking water. Though a water treatment plant is operative in Garden Reach, the supply pressure is very low in almost all the wards, especially in 133 (Fatepur), 134 (Ramnagar) 135 (Bangalipara), 136 (Panchanantala) and 137 (Kesoram). 

 Three months ago, the mayor had promised to set up a water treatment plant on the vacant land of a closed factory. ?But money has not been allotted,? alleged Chatterjee.

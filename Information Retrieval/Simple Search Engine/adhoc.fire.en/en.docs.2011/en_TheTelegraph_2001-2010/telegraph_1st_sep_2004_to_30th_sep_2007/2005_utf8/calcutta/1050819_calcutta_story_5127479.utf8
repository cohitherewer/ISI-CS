 Tribute to a teacher

 In commemoration of the 71st birth anniversary of its founder-teacher, legendary danseuse, late Dr. Manjusri Chaki Sircar, Dancers Guild stages Manjusri Smarane, a programme of dance. The concert comprises choreographic presentations of lyrical compositions by poets, as well as performances based on original creations. Aaj Aakasher Moner Katha ? a choreographic collage of the monsoon songs and poetry of Tagore, vividly captures the beauty and energy of the season through subtle expressions and graceful movements. Nil Sagarer Pakhi, a choreographic rendition of this poem by Bimal Chandra Ghosh, is a brilliantly synchronized piece that celebrates freedom, peace and harmony. She Said ... the last choreographic composition of Ranjabati Sircar, crystallizes the feminine world with its pleasures, desires, anguishes and agonies.

 Event: Manjusri Smarane, a choreographic presentation by Dancers Guild

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Where: Kala Mandir

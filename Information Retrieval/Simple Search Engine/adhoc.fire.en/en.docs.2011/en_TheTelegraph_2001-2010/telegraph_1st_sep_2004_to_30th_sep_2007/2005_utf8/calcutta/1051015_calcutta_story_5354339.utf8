 Dessert stop

 Caf? Coffee Day on Ballygunge Circular Road has a new neighbour. Mama Mia! Gelato has started scooping ice-creams from its second outlet in the city, after the cool success of the first one in Alipore. 

 The outlet in Alipore received tremendous response and it prompted me to undertake another initiative in the heart of the city, says Natasha Aggarwal, proprietor, Mama Mia! Gelato.

 The new 1,200 sq-ft store is a one-of-its-kind outlet in the area. The place is not only much bigger than the first store, it also houses some new flavours to provide more variety, adds Natasha.

 The taste-bud tickling gelatos come in varieties like Tropical Trio (tropical French vanilla and melon combined with chunks of kiwi, peach and pineapple), Dark Twilight (mint twilight gelato with wild berry cheese cake, strawberry sauce and whipped cream), Irish Coffee, Muddy Fudge (dark Belgian chocolate gelato), Ferrero Rocher Sundae and After Eight (chocolate and mint combination). 

 A new offering from Mama Mia! Gelato is a line of diabetic gelatos for those suffering from the disease.

 The dessert destination was inaugurated by Italian consul-general Agostino Pinna.

 In Italy, we are just crazy about ice-creams and the country offers a mind-blowing variety. The ice-creams at Mama Mia! Gelato are quite authentic and I hope they give Calcuttans a true taste of Italy, says Pinna.

 Crackers net courier

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Tuesday confiscated around 40 kg of banned crackers and arrested a man in Sonarpur.

 Acting on a tip-off, a team rounded up the man ? police are not revealing his identity as they feel he can lead them to the kingpin ? while he was on his way to the city in a Matador van.

 Around 500 cartons of chocolate bombs and a huge quantity of explosive material meant for manufacturing banned crackers were recovered from him. The man had earlier despatched a consignment of banned crackers to Burrabazar. He confessed to collecting most of the crackers from Bawali, in South 24-Parganas.

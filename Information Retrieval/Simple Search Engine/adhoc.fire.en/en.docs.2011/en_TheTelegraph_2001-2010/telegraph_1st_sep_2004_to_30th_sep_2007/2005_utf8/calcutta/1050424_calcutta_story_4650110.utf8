The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Emperor?s new clothes

 The consumer is king, with the power 

 to choose one among the many traps laid for him in this age 

 of marketing

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This 

 friend of mine drives an expensive car. It met with an unfortunate 

 accident. No one was injured. A bus overtaking another misjudged. 

 It kissed the car rather passionately. The result was deep 

 denting on all panels.

 The automaker has a single dealer 

 in this city. The dealer was contacted to book the car for 

 repairs. With due apologies, the dealer said he could not 

 take the car in for another 10 days. My friend sent the 

 car anyway to get an estimate of cost of the repairs. He 

 wanted to complete the paperwork for the insurance claim, 

 so that some time was saved.

 The service station being located 

 on the outskirts of the city, the trip consumed a fair amount 

 of petrol and thus money. He did not know then that it would 

 be loose change compared to what he would need to spend 

 on repairs. The estimate ran into a lakh-and-a-half. And 

 to make matters worse, he was told, after the 10-day wait, 

 his car would need to spend another 12 days in the garage.

 My friend had no choice, either 

 in terms of money or in terms of time. Even if he wanted 

 to, he could not get the car repaired in any other place 

 in the city. The automaker had ensured that.

 India was playing the crucial 

 One-Dayer in Delhi. Will it be a three-all series as many 

 had predicted? Would Sourav?s absence be felt? Tensions 

 and questions have this uncanny habit of coexistence. In 

 addition there was the Musharraf and Manmohan angle. By 

 all accounts, this was not a run-of-the-mill match.

 I decided to bunk work and ordered 

 breakfast in bed. The breakfast arrived and I switched on 

 the TV, hoping to catch the toss. I was greeted by a snowing 

 black screen with irritating cacophony. The subscription 

 card was located and both the landline and the mobile numbers 

 were tried. At 11.30, contact was established. The mechanic 

 came at four in the afternoon. Inzamam, forget President 

 Musharaff, had gone home by then.

 I had no choice ? the cable operator 

 holds the monopoly. Quality of in-home entertainment that 

 I can enjoy no longer depends on me. He rules my life.

 They say this is the era of marketing. 

 We the consumers are constantly being lured. What we want 

 is apparently shaping the products of tomorrow. What we 

 reject is not even finding a place in the museums. Buy One 

 Get One is the most popular message in the marketplace. 

 For everything that we want to buy, they are giving us 16 

 options with three variants each. We never had it so good.

 During the late Sixties, there 

 used to be long queues in front of the HMT showroom to buy 

 the flat thin smart wrist watches. There was a time when 

 organising a tin of baby food was the best gift you could 

 give to a friend who had just become a father. And till 

 recently we needed to pay a premium for spot delivery of 

 Bajaj scooters or Maruti cars. These are images from the 

 distant past. This they say is a new dawn.

 There is just one snag. The products 

 that we buy are more than the physical entity of a refrigerator 

 or of an automobile. We also purchase the assurance of service 

 to keep these products healthy for the rest of their lives. 

 That part of the deal is seldom honoured. The 16 choices 

 that you encounter when you walk into a shop to buy a TV 

 or an AC are actually 16 different traps. We are allowed 

 to choose the least uncomfortable one. We all have the choice. 

 After all, this is the age of marketing. Now the consumer 

 is the king. Long live the King!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tours target niche market

 - Go golfers, 

marriage parties amp; single women 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The refurbished Netaji Indoor Stadium was brimming with activity on Sunday afternoon, as Calcuttans trooped in at the 43rd Travel and Tourism Fair. 

 ?The response has been quite good,? said Rajeev Nangia, associate director (operations), Trac, representing Sri Lanka tourism board. ?It?s our first time here. Most queries are basic ? how to get a visa, how to get there ? but we are encouraged. There are a few travel agents with Sri Lanka packages. We will build on that.?

 At the Malaysia Tourism stall, six travel agencies have already had bookings and ?solid queries? for their many special schemes. But with Malaysia already established as a holiday destination, the country is concentrating on the niche market in India ? golfers, the meetings and conventions segment, marriage parties and single women ? said Bhupesh Kumar, marketing manager, Tourism Malaysia.

 ?We had a couple of weddings held there, with up to 350 guests. So we decided to capitalise on that. We recently took eight wedding planners on a weeklong trip to some exotic locales in Malaysia. We can even help organise things, like an authentic Malaysian-style wedding,? added Kumar. ?Besides, our deal with UTI bank, offering special deals to women account-holders, has been doing well. Another thing we?ve started is the Fly and Drive deal, with tailor-made trips for those who don?t want package tours.?

 Sri Lanka, too, wants to target the top-end segment in Calcutta. The plan is to increase visibility, first by educating the distribution channels (travel agents) and then through customer promotions, explained Nangia. ?Indians are the top spenders in Sri Lanka. Last year, there were 100,000-plus Indian tourists there, this year?s aim is 120,000. Post-tsunami, there has been a 40 per cent rise in Indian tourists to Sri Lanka. From Calcutta, we expect even more high-end travellers than Mumbai and Delhi, because there?s a tradition of travel started by the affluent now inculcated in the masses.?

 Karnataka tourism held a presentation for travel agents on Saturday, while Uttaranchal lined up sops, like a rise in commission from 10 to 15 per cent for travel agents.

 ?A large number of people from Calcutta visit Uttaranchal, particularly during the Pujas,? said tourism minister Lt. Gen. (retd) T.P.S. Rawat. So, there are plenty of deals on offer from the 23 private partners at the state stall.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

City talents on a roll

Screen On amp; Off

 Bound by music: Babul Supriyo with Nicolette Bird and a male model who appear in the video 

 His playback singing career may not be as hot as can be but Babul Supriyo is on a high with his Indipop lifeline. Babul?s new album Kuch Aisa Lagtaa Hai, billed as ?an anthology of youthful, breezy and romantic songs?, has indeed won many a young heart since its release. 

 The popularity of the album has a lot to do with the first video single, Tere liye, shot in Greece and featuring Miss India Earth Niharika Singh.

 Now, Babul?s new video from the same album has just hit the airwaves. Called Pyaar hua hai pehli baar, the video features none other than Calcutta girl Nicolette Bird. Having appeared in remix videos like Saiyaan dil mein aana re and Nisha, this is one of the first original tracks that Nicolette will be grooving to.

 Exuding ?loads of energy and panache?, the foot-tapping single is all about first love and the plethora of emotions revolving around it.

 Miss vivacious: Chandana Sharma

 If the face on the right looks familiar, it?s because you have seen her many a time on billboards across the city. She is Chandana Sharma, Nilanjanaa?s sister, who?s all set to conquer the small screen this time, after having shared big-screen space with Jeet and (bro-in-law) Jisshu in Premi.

 Dubbed as the new 8 pm girl on STAR Plus, Chandana will star as Tara in a brand new serial titled Yeh Dil Chahe More to start in December. It?s not the first time that Chandana is doing TV. She started off as a teenybopper in the serial Just Mohabbat before doing other small-screen work in Dil Se Dosti and Ayushman.

 And not just Bengali films, Chandana has also done movies down south. But now it?s television where the girl with the winning smile is back for another blast.

 Howard Hughes setting a speed record 70 years ago by going at 352 miles per hour in the H-1 (the most advanced plane of its time) to today?s fast cars which reach speeds in excess of 240 miles per hour, speed has been a driving force in human history. 

 Discovery Channel probes the science and psychology behind man?s passion to hit top gear in Speed Week, airing till November 25 at 10 pm.

 ?Packed with adrenaline, Speed Week races onto television screens with a premier line-up that connects viewers with the human quest to push the acceleration threshold,? says Raja Balasubramanian, brand director, Discovery Networks India.

 The November 22 episode, The Road To Le Mans, investigates the design and engineering of endurance in sports cars. Through an exclusive access to the Creation racing team, every aspect of racing car design is examined. Racer Girlz (beaming November 23) focuses on the strength and resilience of female racing car drivers and mechanics who challenge stereotypes to excel in a male-dominated sport. The night after, Supersonic: Pushing the Envelope ignites an exploration into the world of jet-powered rocket cars and planes, where people risk death, disaster and dollars in the pursuit of speed. Speed Science on Friday investigates the human desire for speed and the physiology behind how the human body manages it.

 From movies to music. Warfaze, the popular rock band from Bangladesh, will perform at INOX (City Centre) on Tuesday, 5.30 pm onwards. Reinforcing the multiplex as a wholesome entertainment destination, the Warfaze show comes a year after Fossils rocked the plex lobby in 2004.

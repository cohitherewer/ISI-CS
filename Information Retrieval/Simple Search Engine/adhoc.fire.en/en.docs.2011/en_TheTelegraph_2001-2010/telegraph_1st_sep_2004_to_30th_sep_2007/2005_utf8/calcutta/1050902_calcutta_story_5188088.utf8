 What?s on your mind this week

 Healing hearts

 Heal the world,

 Make it a better place

 For you and for me

 And the entire human race...

 This song by Michael Jackson has invaded the hearts of many. It encourages us to dream of a world free of bloodshed and animosity. But each time we endeavour to transform this dream into reality, all our hopes seem to be shattered by heinous crimes like the recent London blasts and the bombings in Bangladesh. The common people generally fall prey to the whims and fancies of the exploiting classes. These criminals seem to be oblivious to moral values and the discrimination between good and evil. But if everyone of us who has the power to dream of a beautiful world was to come forward, then surely no evil force could stand in our way and hinder our progress.

 Killer strokes

 The gruesome bomb blasts in Bangladesh proved that the country?s greatest enemies are its Islamic fundamentalists. It also raises doubts about the ability of the Khaleda Zia government to tackle terrorism in Bangladesh. The Islamic fundamentalists cherish anti-developmental beliefs. They are against the four pillars of a democracy ? the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the press. That is why the prime targets were the institutions that symbolise civil liberties and democratic values. The most ominous message that came from the blasts is: Islamic law must be established in Bangladesh by creating terror and panic among the people. But who should be blamed for the violence? The Khaleda Zia government, because it had been warned about the religious fanatics in the country. Repeated attacks on secular politicians, authors (Taslima Nasreen) and social activists were conveniently ignored by the Zia regime for selfish political gains. India, too, cannot remain complacent about her own security, because the porous border between India and Bangladesh actually puts the religious fanatics of Bangladesh in an advantageous position. It?s time the Manmohan Singh government pondered the impending peril.

 Quota culture

 The Supreme Court has taken the right step by getting rid of the quota system in private institutions. It not only benefits unwanted beneficiaries, but also harms deserving candidates. However, stripping states of the powers of reservation in unaided professional colleges will affect not only the needy, but also those with merit among the economically weaker sections. Also, private institutions are better known as ?teaching shops?. It will now be easier for them to uphold their educational entrepreneurship. What is more disturbing is that instead of forming a watchdog committee to monitor the institutions, political parties jumped to the conclusion that this is against the backward class. In reality, they fear losing votes. Many mediocre students from affluent families get chances in good institutions because of the quota, whereas often good students miss the race because they are from the general categories. Real needy backward students seldom taste the benefits of the government?s rhetoric policy. If the government quota in colleges and institutions are designed for the poorer sections of society, then the reservation policy should be based on the economic status of a family and not caste. It will be wrong for the government to make a law promoting reservation in private institutions.

 The Diary

 You

 Frustrated I don?t know what to do

 Disillusioned all because of a thing called you

 I try to make anger a friend

 Knowing full well that all rage offers me is dread

 If ever there was such a thing

 Confused, betrayed, shamed I hide in the shadows

 of people I knew as me

 I feel the earth shake

 It?s hard to see clear anymore 

 Is it me, I hope its you

 I carry it all around my neck...

 A garland of empty pursuit to please people of irrelevance

 In this life or the next

 Walking down the street, distant memories buried in the past forever

 Reminiscing on things that I knew to be real,

 Things that I knew to be me

 I look to rediscover myself, one way or another

 On a mission of change

 Change me, change you...

 Lay it all on the line to please a thing called YOU.

 Death of a seed

 ...., And another seed dies,

 enveloped in his mother?s cries.

 He is not what he seems,

 he is lost in the clouded dreams.

 Oh Lady! why this ?aborted? lie?

 when you still have to hide and cry.

 Your sunglasses can?t hide your tears,

 although you?re freed from your fears.

 I know your conscience still fights,

 frantically stabbing those cursed nights.

 Fears of the unknown, will make your heart filled,

 Oh Lady! You?ll be unforgiven,

 for another seed is killed.

 CHIT CHAT 

 A critique on a Bollywood movie or your opinion on the latest political controversy, a poem, birthday party photos or just about anything? and all for the whole world to read. That?s what blogs (or web-logs) are all about. There are millions of them on the Internet, and on every conceivable topic imaginable. If you haven?t already joined the blog brigade, here are a few places to start.

 http://www.blogger.com

 Create an account, name your blog, choose a template? go! Three easy steps to nirvana. Blogger is one of the most popular blog sites launched five years ago and subsequently bought over by Google. Lots of templates to choose from.

 http://360.yahoo.com

 Yahoo!?s recently launched blog tool keeps adding to the bouquet of services you can use with a single Yahoo! id (yes, the one that you use for email). Share photo albums, groups, radio stations, and even reviews. You can invite everyone from your Yahoo! Messenger contacts list and even those in the Microsoft Outlook address book.

 http://spaces.msn.com

 If Google and Yahoo! are in the game, can MSN be far behind? Certainly not. Spaces allows sharing of words and photos, and lets you customise colours, themes and layout. You can also check which of your Hotmail contacts have a Space and quickly access them.

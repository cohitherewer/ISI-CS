Chit Chat

Youth forum with attitude 

The latest creative movement at Bhawanipur College 

manifests itself in the form of a monthly journal, Xcuse Me! ? Give 

Attitude A Chance, now entering its fourth volume. The brainchild of a few 

college students, funded by the institution and available free of cost, Xcuse 

Me! was initially a platform to showcase literary talent and exchange ideas 

among the students. 

But from the first volume it took up the task of bridging 

the gap between India and Pakistan. It was launched in the presence of the visiting 

principal and students of Karachi High School in November ?04, the journal, titled 

Sarhad Ke Par. There were interactions between the Karachi and Bhawanipur 

students. 

A passing glance at the eight-page kaleidoscope yields 

news and views, trends, events and entertainment, curriculum-based Q amp;A, young 

achievers, poems and essays, one liners, anecdotes, opinion polls and even a contest. 

The seven-member editorial team (picture below) toils 

long and hard. ?Our time in college and beyond is spent sniffing out stories, 

spotting talent, gathering articles and discussing themes. Then it?s back-breaking 

designing work at Online Graphics,? explain Sweta Sehgal and Sweta Bothra. ?Not 

to say that it?s all work and no play,? smile comrades Sumit Bhatt and Aziz Farooque. 

Shraddha Mundhra talks of the response: ?Xcuse 

Me! has not only spread beyond its profile of providing information and entertainment, 

it has snowballed into a movement. People want to contribute and be featured. 

Most of the 500 copies released are snapped up on the first day. Students have 

bonded and have developed a sense of belonging to the institution.? 

?Our dream would have remained just that without the 

backing of the heads of our Institution,? asserts Komal Singh. ?And without the 

cooperation of Ammi, principal of Karachi High School, the cross-border dialogue 

couldn?t have happened,? adds Tamanna Alam. 

Plans include increasing the size and frequency of 

the youth forum, and using it to spread social awareness.

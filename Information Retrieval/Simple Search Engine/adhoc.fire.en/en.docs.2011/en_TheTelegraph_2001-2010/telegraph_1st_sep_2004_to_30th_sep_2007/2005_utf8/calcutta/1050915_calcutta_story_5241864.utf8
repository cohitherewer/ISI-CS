 The John Abraham-Akshay Kumar-starrer Garam Masala will be one of the first films to be distributed by INOX

 After changing the way we watch movies in Calcutta, INOX Leisure Ltd, the people behind the multiplexes at Forum and City Centre, is now venturing into film distribution. 

 After seven multiplexes and 30 screens in six cities, this is the first time that INOX will be distributing Bollywood movies across the country. The group has already dabbled in film production with the recent Aamir Khan-starrer Mangal Pandey ? The Rising.

 As for distribution, the movies that will see INOX?s initial foray in this field include the Priyadarshan comedy Garam Masala (John Abraham, Akshay Kumar), Rakesh Mehra?s Rang De Basanti (Aamir Khan, Soha Ali Khan), the AB Corp-produced Family (Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar), Prakash Jha?s Apaharan (Ajay Devgan, Nana Patekar, Bipasha Basu), and the desi remake of One Flew Over The Cuckoo?s Nest, Priyadarshan?s Kyon Ki (Salman Khan, Kareena Kapoor).

 Having already spent Rs 5 crore to bring in the prized titles, INOX is only concentrating on Bollywood films in Phase I of its distribution plans before going international in Phase II. 

 ?Given our success with exhibition, this is a natural extension of our business,? says Manoj Bhatia, CEO of INOX Leisure Ltd. ?Operating a distribution company will give us greater control over the supply chain and bring us one step closer to an integrated set up.?

 The Bengal sector is an area which is of prime interest to INOX. ?On an average, our multiplexes in Calcutta account for one-third of West Bengal?s entire box-office takings. Hence, we see huge potential in distributing the top-of-the-line productions in that sector,? says Aroon Sharma, who will head the distribution wing with offices in Calcutta, Jaipur and Bangalore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fun zone for food buffs

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, ZEESHAN JAWED

Three 

hundred covers, six different kinds of cuisine, separate counters for fast food, 

beverages and desserts ? that translates into 9,0 00 sq ft of non-stop food and 

fun, on the southern fringes of the city.

 Yo Foodies in The Metropolis mall of Hiland Park formally opens on Friday and promises to be different from the never-ending list of new eateries in town. ?The idea was to bring home the international-style food courts which have exclusive counters for different categories,? says business partner Vishal Kapur. ?But unlike the food courts in Forum and City Centre, the counters will be manned by our own staff as we are not following any franchisee system.?

 The initial list of cuisine counters includes north Indian, Oriental, pizza and pasta, south Indian, chaat, snacks, beverages and desserts. ?The counters will be somewhat interactive and one can decide on their chaat or pizza toppings,? says Kapur.

 A regional festival counter will feature cuisine from various states of the country. And the month of April will, of course, be dedicated to Poila Baisakh.

 This one-stop food solution for families with diverse tastes is not just multi-dimensional in its fare but also has an ambience that is a melange of chill-out styles to suit all age groups. A kids? zone and an adda zone with lounge seating make for a complete package of relaxed dining and entertainment.

 Cricket craze

 The purchase of any LG product between March 8 and April 20 brings with it an opportunity to walk home with a bag of goodies. If you are luckier than that, you could end up playing for either Sourav Ganguly or Inzamam-ul-Haq in the clash of titans. 

 For LG Electronics India Private Limited has kicked off LG Challenge Khelega Kya contest, with a place in Sourav?s or Inzy?s team as the big bait.

 Lucky draws are being conducted at regular intervals, and it is the draw amongst winners that would decide the 22 who get to team up with the skippers.

 ?Cricket is a religion in this country and we launched this promotion to further add to the excitement and passion for the game that has gripped the whole nation,? said Sabyasachi Gupta, branch manager, LG.

 God?s gift

 This Holi, bring home the gods. Lladro on Wednesday launched Kanhaiya ? Lord Krishna and Radha Krishna figurines in Calcutta. It also unveiled the 2005 Lladro Humanitas Collection.

 The ceramic artists at Lladro in Spain undertook a journey into the mythological world of India to study the minutest of details to enable them to create the figurines of Kanhaiya and Radha Krishna. Exquisite craftsmanship and painstaking artistry convert the figurines of Kanhaiya and Radha Krishna into creations of beauty.

 The figure of Kanhaiya is inspired by Krishna?s childhood that is brought to life in fine porcelain. The Krishna figurine measures 22 x 7 cm and is priced at Rs 19, 750.

 Krishna is probably the most popular avatar of Vishnu and porcelain sculptors of Lladro, mesmerised by the legend of Radha and Krishna, have created this lifelike piece of art. The figurine measures 17 inches and are priced at Rs 2, 35,000.

 The Lladro Humanitas Collection is dedicated to romantic emotions and is full of life. The pieces in this collection feature new shapes and textures.

 The Kanhaiya and Radha Krishna figurines as well as the 2005 Humanitas Collection from Lladr? are available at Ganga Expressions in Metro Shopping Plaza on Ho Chi Minh Sarani.

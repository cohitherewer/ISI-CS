 CU centre on Gandhi

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to popularise Gandhian philosophy in eastern India, Calcutta University (CU) on Thursday opened a Gandhian Studies Centre with financial aid from the University Grants Commission (UGC). 

 Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty inaugurated the centre in the university?s history department. Judith Brown from the history department of Oxford University attended Thursday?s function.

 Pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das said CU had approached the UGC in January for setting up the centre. The clearance was obtained in February. The UGC released Rs 5 lakh for the centre. 

 Basudeb Chatterjee, a professor of CU?s history department, has been appointed director of the centre, while Suparna Gupta, also a professor of history, will function as his deputy. 

 Gupta said a section of people has started to feel that Gandhian philosophy has become irrelevant. ?Our main job is to make them understand that Gandhi?s philosophy is still relevant. We will organise seminars and workshops on his life and works and translate his writings in Bengali,? she added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Egged on to lay another 10 crore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Faced with a severe shortage of eggs in city markets, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has taken up an egg farming project in the state.

 Self-help groups, especially those comprising women, will be allotted day-old chicks, which the government will buy back and redistribute to lay eggs. 

 Animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman said the government will distribute 10 lakh day-old chicks in the current year, leading to the production of an additional 10 crore eggs annually.

 ?There are about two lakh self-help groups in the state, half of which comprise women, working in the animal resources development sector. We will spend around Rs 1.80 crore in allotting the day-old chicks to them,? Rahaman said.

 With this project, the government hopes to narrow the yawning supply-demand gap in the state. Against an annual demand for 830 crore eggs in Bengal, the markets get a supply of only 282 crore.

 Calcutta consumes over 60 lakh eggs daily, more than half of the state?s daily consumption of 112 lakh. To make up for the shortfall, about 75 lakh eggs are procured every day from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the country?s largest egg producers.

 ?A hen usually lays 60 eggs a year, but we are distributing the Rhode Island Red breed, a superior high-yield variety. Each will lay around 240 eggs,? Rahaman added.

 The project involves distribution of 100-day-old chicks to every leader of the 10-member self-help group, who will rear them until they are a month old. After brooding, the department will buy back the chicks and re-allot them for rearing. Self-help group leaders will be given a seven-day training in rearing young chicks.

 The government will also pay for vaccines for the chicks, as well as their feed, until they are a month old.

 The 22 government farms all over the state are working on producing the 15 lakh eggs, which will be required for rearing the hens.

 According to the minister, the cocks hatching from the eggs will be sent back to the farms, whereas the hens will be redistributed to be reared until they are six months old and ready to lay.

 The state currently produces 300 crore eggs annually, laid by the four crore-odd hens, but these are country fowl and the yield is poor.

 ?For now, we?re focussing on production and not distribution. The supply-demand gap is so huge that the produce will automatically make its way to buyers in the city,? said a senior officer of the animal resources development department. 

 Though the state?s demand for eggs has grown at a steady rate of 20 per cent over the last two years, growers prefer to raise poultry for meat only.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dancing to Bollywood?s tune

 The 

Bollywood beat was loud and clear at The Big Ben, where Planets, a group from 

Delhi, danced to some of all-time favourite filmi tracks. The 14-year-old group, 

in town to perform at the The Kenilworth nightclub, has danced alongside the likes 

of Shaggy, Ricky Martin, Bryan Adams and Britney Spears.

 ?Planets is known for having performed at every concert or function worth its salt in the circuit. It is the first Indian group to perform in more than 55 countries,? says Ronica Jacob, owner and co-ordinator of the group. 

 The band got its name as, at the outset, it had nine members. Now, there are 25.

 Despite its success, Bollywood has never been high on Jacob?s agenda. ?There have been many offers for my dancers. But it is a dubious place,? feels Jacob. They may have given the movies a miss, but Planets is still dancing to Bollywood?s tune. Saturday night saw the group swinging to blockbusters like Dekh le, Chunari chunari and Bheege honth tere.

It also has special plans for the Valentine?s Day. 

?The boys and girls will perform to some romantic numbers and interact with the 

couples. There would also be contests and spot prizes,? adds Jacob. V-Day is also 

the last night you can catch their act.

 Number game

 A night with the Bin tere sanam man is bound to be special. More so if his music helps express your emotions days before the Big Day.

 DJ Suketu played cupid at Tantra on Saturday night, taking to the console at around 11 pm, playing requests for a packed house and reading out dedications till the wee hours.

 At the first major event of the nightclub?s three-day V-Day package titled Heartbeat, technology bridged the gap between hearts as Airtel?s special service ensured that even amidst the chaos and blaring sound, reaching the DJ with a request and a dedication wasn?t a problem.

 ?I sent an SMS with my request for a number, with my dedication. It was flashed on a screen in front of the DJ, letting me reach out to my lady in style,? said an excited Amit Bajoria, a college student out on a date with his new-found love.

 Spinning out Indipop and Hindi remixes, Suketu soon set the house rocking, keeping the party animals happy ? even if the date for the evening came up short!

 Petal power

 Ferns and Petals, the Calcutta outlet of the flower chain on Loudon Street, is all set to colour the lives of the love sick. From a single red rose stem ? a must for V-Day ? to more elaborate arrangements like whole rooms and cars bedecked with blossoms, this boutique is all set to make your true love see red.

 With combo offers throwing in bouquet, card, gift and chocolate together, it?s proving to be the one-stop shop for the special occasion.

 ?We are sending personalised messages along with the flowers,? explains director Mehul Agarwal. Priced at Rs 10 per rose, the range goes up all the way to Rs 5,999. ?It?s a way to show your loved one that you care. It is the emotion that matters, how much you spend is immaterial,? adds director Indira Agarwal.

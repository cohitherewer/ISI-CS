 Rain to run taps

 - Plants set up at school, college

 At a time when experts are warning of an impending crisis due to injudicious use of groundwater, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board is spearheading an awareness campaign on use of rainwater for drinking and non-drinking purposes, known as rainwater harvesting.

 ?Apparatus for rainwater harvesting has been installed on the rooftops of Salt Lake Poura Bhavan, Bidhannagar Government College and Loreto Convent, Entally. While the Salt Lake buildings have 12,000-litre reservoirs each, a 10,000-litre reservoir is used at Loreto. At all three places, the harvested water is used not only for drinking, but also for gardening and fire fighting,? said S.K. Sarkar, member-secretary of the board.

 He added that rainwater treatment plants are ready to be set up on the rooftops of La Martiniere for Boys and La Martiniere for Girls.

 According to the member-secretary, water harvesting can be used to replenish groundwater reserves. ?For that, we will first have to identify the position of aquifers (the layer in the soil where water is deposited). A study is being conducted to identify the aquifers in Calcutta.?

 Elaborating on the concept of water harvesting, he said rainwater could be stored and used for various purposes. ?The water can be diverted into dugout ponds, vessels or underground tanks and stored for long periods. Construction of small barriers across streams to use the running water is another example of groundwater harvesting.?

 A major volume of the rainwater flows into streams, rivers and finally to the seas. An average of eight per cent of the rainfall replenishes the aquifers. ?Most of the rainwater is wasted,? Sarkar lamented.

 ?There are two different methods to harvest rainwater falling on flat and sloped roofs. Houses can be designed to maximise the amount of water harvested,? the member-secretary explained.

 The Institute of Environmental Studies and Wetland Management has taken up a project of rainwater harvesting at 40 schools in Birbhum, Bankura and Purulia districts.

 ?Awareness about dangers of water misuse and the virtue of utilising rainwater is desperately needed as we are heading towards a severe water crisis. Experts from all over the world have warned about the impending disaster,? asserted Sarkar.

 ?The United Nations Environment Programme has listed Calcutta among the 12 mega-cities that are increasingly becoming dependent on groundwater. And that is precisely why we should remain cautious,? the member-secretary signed off.

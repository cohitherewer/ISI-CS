Subrata Chakrabarty: The beautification of the Parnasree lake was started, only to be abandoned. Can you throw some light on the status of the project?

 The project was the first such taken up by Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The banks of the lake were eroding, causing concern to residents of the adjacent areas. About Rs 46 lakh of ADB money was spent on the project, before the work was stopped. The banks were cemented, and we were planning to build a walking track around the lake. We also want to plant trees around the lake and set up a children?s amusement park. Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, mayoral council member of parks and gardens, recently visited the lake.

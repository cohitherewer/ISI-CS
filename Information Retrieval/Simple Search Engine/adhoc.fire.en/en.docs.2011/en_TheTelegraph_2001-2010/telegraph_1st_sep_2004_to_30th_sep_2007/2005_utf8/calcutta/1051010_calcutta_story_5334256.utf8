The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 With thousands of pandal-hoppers on the streets, the number of roadside stalls 

selling junk food has also shot up. Most of these new vendors are temporary and 

will wrap up post-Pujas. They use harmful ingredients, like colours and flavours, 

in the food with the aim to make a fast buck. This is when Calcutta Municipal 

Corporation?s health inspectors should swoop down on these stalls. They should 

force the puja organisers in the vicinity not to allow unauthorised vendors in 

the area.

 Sometime in the end of September, I witnessed a horrible incident while travelling 

from Sealdah to Santoshpur in a suburban train. Just after Majherhat station, 

a beggar boarded our compartment with a big snake around his neck. The man thrust 

the snake towards passengers who refused him alms. In this manner, he managed 

to force some to part with money. The railway police must stop these beggars from 

boarding the trains.

 October 1 was International Day for the Elderly. Apart from a handful of programmes, 

no constructive scheme was launched for the city?s senior citizens, especially 

those who are ailing and homeless. Isn?t it time the government gave serious thought 

to the issue?

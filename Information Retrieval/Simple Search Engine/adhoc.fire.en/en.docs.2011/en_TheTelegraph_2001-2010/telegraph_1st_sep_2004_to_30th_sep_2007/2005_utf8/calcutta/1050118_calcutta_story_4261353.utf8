 Creating a new wave

 In a unique effort that aims to set up a consistent and permanent space dedicated to theatre, two of the city?s prominent theatre groups, Pancham Vaidic, led by Saoli Mitra, and Tritiyo Sutra, led by Suman Mukhopadhyay, jointly present a new platform for the dramatic arts, Punartaranga. Through a series of 104 productions to be staged throughout the year, Punartaranga hopes to underline the role of theatre in shaping society. Its performances also seek to place in a new, more relevant context, the ideas and dreams conceived by its forerunners. Marking the launch of this praiseworthy initiative is Punartaranga Utsav (beginning today), a festival of popular plays. A Pancham Vaidic production, Naathabati Anaathabat (picture along), the inaugural play, narrates the story of Draupadi, the Pandava queen, who discovers that she has lived the life of a destitute despite having five husbands. Directed and performed by Saoli Mitra, the play puts into perspective the isolation suffered by women down the ages.

 Event: Punartaranga Utsav, a festival of plays

 When: January 18 - 23; 6.30 pm

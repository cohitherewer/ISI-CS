 Cop bar chastens channels

crunch as astrology shows go off air 

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Stop stoking superstitions or shut down. A month since the cop caution to six local cable channels for violating the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act of 2002, only one has gone off the air. But it?s not quite business as usual for the rest.

 On September 17, representatives of the three city multi-system operators (MSO) were summoned to Lalbazar and asked by the state administration to blank out channels ?propagating and encouraging superstition?.

 Of the six channels under the scanner ? Channel Vision, Sristi, Aamar, CTVN II, Sonar Bangla and Fortune ? CTVN II has since downed shutters. ?We had to take the channel off air as we were facing a financial crunch,? said Sudeb Roychowdhury of CTVN, adding that all astrology-related programmes had been stopped a month ago. 

 ?We are having problems running our other channel as well,? admitted Roychowdhury.

 The prod seems to have worked for those still on air, as well. ?We are adhering to what the police said and are not beaming any programme related to astrology and other such things. Obviously, there are some problems financially, but it?s a little early to say how much that will affect us,? offered Ashok Agarwal of Sristi.

 ?There wasn?t any programme on supernatural things on my channel and there will not be any in future either,? argued astrologer Amritalal, the man behind Fortune. He also observed that the word ?astrology? was not mentioned in the letter sent by the administration cautioning MSOs about the channels.

 The common crib for these local cable channels is the high carriage fee demanded by MSOs, which forces them to opt for the high revenue-earning astrology and Feng Shui programmes. Substitutes like news, music and serials fail to rake in the money.

 ?The MSOs demand exorbitant amounts. I have even withdrawn my channel from one of the MSOs, since I could not afford so much,? said Amritalal.

 The other complaint is that the satellite channels are getting away with graver offences. ?Some of the advertisements aired on national channels are so vulgar that they cannot be for family viewing, but nothing happens to them,? complained Sristi?s Agarwal.

 The rough edges of the parar rock will be replaced by the cosy sling chairs. Earthen bhars of cha will give way to mugs of beer. Chicken Tikka Lasooni will take over from where telebhaja and muri left off.

 Gossip is all set to change the adda arrangement in Calcutta. The resto-pub, at Unnayan, the plaza next to the Udita housing complex, is born out of the concept of the adda that runs in Calcuttas blood.

 Eating, drinking and talking for hours at length is my passion. The people of Calcutta have also mastered this art over the decades. I thought it would be a good idea to provide Calcutta with a more sophisticated option, said Pradeep Paul, the Singapore-based businessman who set up Gossip, which opened on Thursday.

 And even if your gang deserts you, the walls and pillars of the pub will ensure you have enough food for stimulating thought, if not talk. 

 From the origin of the bikini (a piece of clothing as small as an atom but as explosive as a bomb) to the various uses of cigars (including the way Bill Clinton liked them), the walls have small anecdotes and gossip topics to tickle the funny bone.

 Given the theme of this hangout, the most powerful pieces of advice are on the central pillar of the pub: People who gossip with you, also gossip about you, and What you do not see with your eyes, dont witness with your mouth.

 Somebody who comes in and has no gossip to share will get enough matter on the walls and the pillar here. If my place inspires them, I think the purpose of place is served, smiles Pradeep.

 While no meals are to be served here, there is a selection of delicious finger food and kebabs. Dig into Prawn Satay, Sun Dried Tomato Fish, Italian Chicken Kebab, Kashmiri Lamb, Barbecued Chicken Wings, Paneer Finger and Makai Malai Seekh Kebabs. Guzzle it down with a wide range of mocktails and beer. The pocket pinch ranges between Rs 90 and Rs 145.

 But if you choose to take a bite out of your neighbours indiscretions instead, watch out, because even walls are known to have ears.

 Coiffure corner

 If your idea of a family outing is a coiffure for man, woman and child, there is a new place for you to go. Trendz is the latest hair salon that has sprouted to pamper the hair-proud Calcuttan, and it is unisex.

 With Calcutta becoming conscious about the way it looks, this seemed like the ideal time to set up a state-of-the-art salon, says Rajesh Jaiswal, owner of the parlour that upped its shutters on Thursday afternoon at 17, Elgin Road.

 Though skin treatments like dead-cell removal and skin polishing are on the list of services offered, its hair colouring and styling that is the forte of this style stop.

 A haircut is priced between Rs 150 and Rs 300 while hair colouring would set you back by between Rs 500 and Rs 2,500. From highlights to chunky hair colour and low-lighting, the shade options are plenty. 

 We are expecting both the young and old to try our colouring and skin care services, signs off Jaiswal.

 Mexican mix

 Its fiesta time at Starstruck in Forum. The restaurant and retro lounge is hosting a Mexican food festival from June 15 to 26.

 Start off with Nachos, move on to Tacos stuffed with kidney beans and veggies or the more exotic Tequila Margarita Cheese Balls.

 Move on to Stuffed Mexican Chicken, with olives and avocado. Or opt for Aves Con Chilli, which is fried chicken with tomato salsa, herbs and spices served with yellow rice, Mexican Grilled Fish with bell pepper and kidney beans or simple Mexican Lamb Stew.

 The pocket pinch is between Rs 125 and Rs 300, with a shot of tequila thrown in.

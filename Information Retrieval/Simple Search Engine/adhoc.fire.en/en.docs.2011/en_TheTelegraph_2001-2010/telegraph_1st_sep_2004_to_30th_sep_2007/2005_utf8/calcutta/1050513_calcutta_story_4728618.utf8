 Dynamics of domesticity

 Jean Genet wrote his first play, The Maids, the year India became independent. One wonders if that coincidence had anything to do with director Pushan Kripalani casting a British performer as the mistress and two Mumbai actresses as the maids who first playact her and then try to kill her. Post-colonial critics could go to town on the political interpretations of such an equation (however, the Mumbaikar maids retained curiously pucca English accents). 

 Of course, Genet himself primarily exposed the domestic master-servant power play. This is where I found the Industrial Theatre Company?s production wanting. Granted, all three women acted passionately, but neither the RADA-trained Imogen Butler-Cole nor the Indians (who must have encountered many maids in their own lives) credibly demonstrated the dynamics of the lady/serving girl relationship, specially through their eyes.

 Despite superficial attempts at realism, they came across seeing one another as equals, by using ample eye contact. An imperious mistress would not even register the presence of her servants facially; she would go about her business, talking to them dismissively or with back turned, certainly not looking them in the eye most of the time as Butler-Cole did.

 Only suddenly might she face them, for example in anger. Reciprocally, the maids (Shanaya Rafaat and Ira Dubey) should be far more docile, eyes permanently downcast, in front of her, presenting a stark contrast to their natural sisterly expressions earlier between themselves.

 While we must applaud the company?s continuing quest for novel non-proscenium spaces (Calcuttans may remember their version of Hayavadana in a Ballygunge garden), locating a site by itself does not guarantee creativity. Ritualistic theatre is essential to Genet stylistically. 

 Kripalani?s efforts in this direction were half-hearted. The loud unmodulated vocal volume in a small drawing room (of Halwasiya Mansion on Moira Street) overwhelmed the subtle possibilities of intimate theatre. Kripalani ignored the potential of silences or candlelight and darkness. 

 Nor did he involve the audience physically, treating them as usual behind an invisible fourth wall. Why then should this experience be more special than conventional theatre?

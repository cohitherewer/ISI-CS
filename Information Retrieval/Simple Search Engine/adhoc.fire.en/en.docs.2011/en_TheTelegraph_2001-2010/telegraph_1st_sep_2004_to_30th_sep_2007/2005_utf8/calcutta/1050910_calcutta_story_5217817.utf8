 Poetry on clay

 Showcasing unconventional paintings and sculptures made of terracotta, Burnt Sienna, Nabendu Sengupta?s maiden solo exhibition, is a measure of his successful experiments with clay as a creative medium. Inspired by the traditional potters of Bengal, his terracotta paintings are first outlined by engraving on earthen plates and then burnt. They are then painted upon. On display are some outstanding works including Banshee, which nostalgically evokes a village vignette, and those of the Sundari series, presenting a delicate study of the owl (picture above).

 Event: Terracotta paintings amp; sculptures

 When: Till September 12 (except Sunday), 11 am - 8 pm

 Where: Gallery Kanishka?s 2/1 Hindustan Road

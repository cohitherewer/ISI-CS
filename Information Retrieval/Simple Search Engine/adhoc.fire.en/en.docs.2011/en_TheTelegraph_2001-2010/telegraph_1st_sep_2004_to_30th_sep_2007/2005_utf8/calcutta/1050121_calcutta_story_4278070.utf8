 Prison for break-in scion

 - Woman, aides sentenced for robbing grandfather home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A city court on Thursday sentenced four men to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and a woman to seven years for a dacoity committed at a Harish Mukherjee Road address four years ago.

 Sanjukta Basu Roy (alias Bulbuli and Saira), along with her accomplices Mohammad Mukhtar, Nizam, Sahada and Nazimuddin, were convicted on Wednesday on charges of dacoity, using arms during the dacoity and criminal conspiracy.

 The verdict was delivered by additional district sessions judge Sukhlal Biswas in a packed courtroom at 3.30 pm.

 The convicts betrayed no sign of fear or remorse while the ruling was being read out.

 Asked if she had anything to add to her testimony before the verdict was pronounced, Sanjukta said: ?I am innocent. I have been framed in an incident I was not involved in.?

 Her four accomplices, however, said they had nothing to add to their testimonies and would accept whatever sentence the judge delivered.

 Besides serving the prison terms, the male convicts will have to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 each, failing which their stay in jail will be extended by two months.

 Sanjukta was fined Rs 1,000. Her prison term will be extended by a month if she fails to deposit the amount. The sentences will run concurrently.

 On February 23, 2001, the four men had raided the house of Kalyan Ghosh Dastidar, Sanjukta?s 82-year-old grandfather, in the afternoon and looted valuables.

 Sanjukta was present then and the gang ?abducted? her before fleeing, adding a twist to the tale that ultimately gave the game away.

 She returned to her Bansdroni residence two days later, claiming to have given her ?captors? the slip.

 Police, however, came to know that Sanjukta herself had led the four to the Ghosh Dastidar residence. The abduction, too, was staged.

 ?In the course of the investigation, police seized a few diaries of Sanjukta containing cell phone numbers of the four accused,? public prosecutor Tapan Kumar Banerjee said outside the courtroom. 

 On tapping the phone lines, the sleuths learnt that the conspiracy had been hatched in Bolpur Lodge, Santiniketan, where the four men and Sanjukta had assembled twice.

 In police custody, Sanjukta had claimed that she was pregnant and appealed to the magistrate for a test. 

 The magistrate granted her wish, but the gynaecologist who examined her found the claim to be false. In fact, the test revealed she had undergone an abortion.

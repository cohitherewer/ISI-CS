The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Behind the bar

Md Nadeem Siddiqui / Asst floor manager, Prince 

of Cal

The sun has started blazing already and in a few days 

time you will have to drop the glasses of brandy and rum in favour of chilled 

beer cans. There?s nothing like a glass of beer to chill out on a hot summer afternoon. 

But if you are not particularly fond of beer, some summer cooler cocktails would 

be just perfect to quench your thirst this season. These will also provide variety 

to your liquor options in the coming months.

At the Prince of Cal bar and lounge at Sourav?s, we 

have introduced a few innovative cocktails that are ideal for the summer months. 

The basic ingredients in these can be anything from vodka to rum or gin, but the 

fruity coolers, be it orange or pineapple, are extremely refreshing and particularly 

suitable for summer evenings. You can whip them up at home quite easily, provided 

you are armed with the right ingredients.

The cocktails have all been named after Dada (Sourav 

Ganguly) using cricketing terms, which is in sync with the theme of our restaurant.

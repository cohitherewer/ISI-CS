 Mind games people play 

 Why Athens was an Olympian blunder 

 as far as marketing of a sporting extravaganza goes

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Arguably, 

 one of the most significant marketing disappointments of 

 the last calendar year was the Athens Olympics. How does 

 one measure the success or failure of a sporting event? 

 There obviously are hard evidences ? TRPs and the like. 

 To me, the telling evidence comes from the kids who live 

 in the neighbourhood. They are all children of colour TV, 

 frost-free refrigerator, Santro+ homes.

 In the mid-Eighties, when day-and-night 

 limited over cricket matches were being telecast live for 

 the first time, the effect was not only dramatic but immediate. 

 The spaces in front of the lift have always been used for 

 cricket in our building. Tennis balls and cricket bats of 

 less than adult size were in use. Those gave the impression 

 that all this is child?s play. Make no mistake, a tennis 

 ball, spun viciously with an underhand delivery is far more 

 difficult to negotiate than what Trevor Chappel had bowled 

 many years ago.

 Post-day-night games, the nature 

 of the game did not change, timings did. The afternoons 

 were quiet. Homework was being attended to. Come evening, 

 the caretaker of the building switched on the landing lights 

 and the Gavaskars and Kapils, Maninders and Shastris would 

 storm the pitch.

 The response of some kids of the 

 neighbourhood told me that Athens was not a great hit. During 

 the Games I was worried that there would be kids who would 

 use the hard green patch next to the car parking space to 

 practise the long run and the jump that Anju Bobby George 

 familiarised us with. I did not spot anyone doing that. 

 Mercifully. 

 What went wrong with the telecast 

 of Athens Olympics? Why did it leave us cold? The most obvious 

 answer that knocks on your mind is that our country did 

 not do well. That certainly was disappointing. Yet the question 

 remains, were we all following Lea and Hesh passionately 

 on TV? Did we watch every move that Gagan Ajit Singh made? 

 The answer will be an unequivocal No. And that really is 

 the issue.

 Could the reason be Doordarshan? 

 Their feed came from international sources. One cannot really 

 complain about the visual quality. It is true that they 

 spent a little too much time showing sports that are less 

 than popular. But that possibly is not the major offence. 

 An unknown game can be made popular. It depends on the role 

 that the channel chooses to play.

 In covering an external event 

 like the Olympics, a television channel can act as an inert 

 transmitter or an active agent providing additional ingredients. 

 Admittedly, some events like the cine awards are strong 

 enough to demand nothing more than mere transmission. Sports 

 on the other hand often need a helping hand. Even for a 

 game like cricket, that is so popular and well understood, 

 imagine watching the February 13 tsunami match without a 

 Boycott or a Benaud, Gavaskar or a Greig.

 That was where the national channel 

 went wrong. It saw its task as sending out signals after 

 they are received. That is why the commentary was less than 

 educative, scheduling less than convenient.

 Make no mistake, Gavaskar and 

 Shastri clones can make coverage of an international athletics 

 meet into a super hit sports event. That is the point that 

 DD missed. It escaped the national channel that most Olympic 

 sports are like handicapped children. They need a helping 

 hand to reach viewers? homes.

 If Milind Soman floored every girl in B.E.D. on Friday, it was Indrani Dasguptas turn to have the boys vying for her attention on Saturday night at Virgose, the nightclub at the HHI. 

 The Delhi-based Bengali babe made a fashionably late entry after midnight when the house was jam-packed for the Hot and Haute Nite.

 Dressed in an asymmetrical short orange skirt and black top, the model mingled freely with the crowd. I like the spirit of Calcutta, smiled Indrani, raising a toast to them.

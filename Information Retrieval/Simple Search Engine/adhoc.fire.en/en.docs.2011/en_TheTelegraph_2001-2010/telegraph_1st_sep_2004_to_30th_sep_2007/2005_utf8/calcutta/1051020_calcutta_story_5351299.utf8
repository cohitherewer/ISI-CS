A resurrected, regal Chowringhee wing with an array of sumptuous suites; new, top-draw international channels on satellite TV; a spruced-up coffee shop with hot and fresh buffet fare on induction plates; new F amp;B outlets; an upgraded car fleet; recognition as a leading hotel of the world...

 The Oberoi Grand, once counted among the four hospitality jewels in the East (the others being Oriental in Bangkok, Raffles in Singapore and Strand in Rangoon), is gearing up to embrace the new Calcutta with a new persona.

 The business environment is extremely buoyant and, as I see it, in the next 18 months, Calcutta would be the same as any other metro in terms of the demand-supply scenario in five-star hotel rooms, says Amitabh Rai, general manager.

 Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberois sparkling edifice, the grand old dame among the citys star addresses, is consciously repositioning itself to adopt a more defined business profile.

 In view of the changing business climate, its critical to keep reinventing and be ready for fresh challenges, observes Rai.

 While the majestic building is getting an elaborate facelift, the restrooms have been endowed with rare and exclusive ayurvedic toiletries.

 La Terrasse, the 24-hour coffee shop, will undergo a makeover without shutting down, with a churn on the menu as well.

 The Sunday gourmet lunch, where the fare changes every week, is being beefed up with added options, and the spa, with day packages for Calcutta residents, gets a new therapy suite.

 We have introduced a clutch of new value-added satellite channels like Bloomberg and Channel Asia, again targeted largely at the business traveller, says Rai.

 The business traveller is at the heart of every new design as The Oberoi Grand plans to roll out two new F amp;B outlets next summer.

 The management has earmarked substantial funds for training programmes to fine-tune services at the Chowringhee property. We are also travelling overseas to study latest trends in corporate hospitality, the GM adds.

 Doing the basics right and casting a hawk eye on detail are critical to the star hotels aspirations of being clearly demarcated as a business hotel. For instance, we even have a pillow menu for the guests to choose from, offers Rai, who has been with the Oberoi group for 15 years, the last eight at the city property.

 Diligent basic hygiene has won The Oberoi Grand the leading hotel title awarded by the New York-based international parent body Leading Hotels of the World, feels the management. There are only around 409 hotels in the world in the same bracket and its a huge honour, simply because the assessment system is so rigorous, with over 1,600 points probed, Rai points out.

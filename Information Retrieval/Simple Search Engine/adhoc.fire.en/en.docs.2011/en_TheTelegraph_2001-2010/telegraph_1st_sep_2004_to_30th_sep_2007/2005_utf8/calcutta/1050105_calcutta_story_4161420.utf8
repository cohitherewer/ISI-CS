IPSITA DEB

Restaurant and caf? D? Fire--Ice has sizzled up some 

items on its menu and introduced new ones for the city?s food lovers. The 50-seater 

caf? with interiors (picture by Rashbehari Das) blended with glass, marble, stones, 

tiles and floral upholstery in a bright ambience, is under the able guidance of 

Dimpy G. Singh, former F amp;B manager with the Taj Group of Hotels.

 Hariyali Chicken and Cheese, Grilled Mushroom and Cheese Sandwiches, Paneer Tikka and Chicken Tikka Burgers, Boti Kebab and Prawn Tandoor are some of the hottest dishes here. 

 New recipes from Northern Frontiers, tandoori and Chinese quarters include the Shanghai Chicken, Makki Seekh Kebab, Chicken Rani Kebab. ?We make it a point to introduce new items into our menu every month,? says Singh. 

 The restaurant and caf?, open from noon to 11 pm, has a wide variety of blossoms, fizzes, slushes and mocktails to choose from as well. Some of the tasty ?soul stirrers? include Lover?s Dream, Rainbow, Tangy Pinky and D? Fire--Ice special (butterscotch, vanilla, soda and nuts).

Copper count

 Copper Chimney, an Indian and tandoori speciality restaurant on 31 Shakespeare Sarani, completed its first year in Calcutta recently. On this occasion, Sunil Kapur, managing director of the Copper Chimney chain, was in Calcutta to throw light on the year that was and future plans. ?The past year saw Copper Chimney carving a niche in the hearts of Calcuttans through their stomachs. The food was liked and the hospitality was appreciated,? added Kapur. 

Kebabs (picture by Pabitra Das) are by far the most 

popular items here, even if they are priced upwards of Rs 150.

 The initial success has prompted the food chain to look for more outlets in Calcutta. ?City Centre has come up well and Forum also looks nice. Talks are on with other places, too. We are looking for a place which is cost effective, up-market and easily accessible,? said Kapur. 

 Though last year saw immense competition, it does not deter the owner of Copper Chimney. ?When the competition increases, the size of the market also increases,? felt Kapur.

 He finds a great difference in the city now from about five years ago. ?The spending pattern has totally changed. People want to try out everything that is new. So all the establishments have a chance to attract attention,? summed up Kapur.

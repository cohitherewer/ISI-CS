The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cool spell in sudden rerun

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the western disturbance clearing from parts of north India, there?s a nip in the air once again, before the heat turns on. 

 The Met office claimed that this was owing to the sudden disappearance of the low depression line that seemed to create an obstacle in the movement of cold winds from the north. Temperatures have dropped since early this week, with a minimum of 21.2 degrees Celsius on Tuesday touching 19.7 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. On Friday, it was 17.8 degrees Celsius, likely to remain the same on Saturday.

 After boardroom brainstorming and target tirades, letting your hair down with a drink in a relaxed setting can be just the thing to revive your spirits.

 That?s what Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion offers on Wednesdays with its corporate nights. The theme enables the corporate crowd to unwind at its own pace, with complimentary entry, free drinks and music of their choice.

 ?Segregating the clientele helps us concentrate on the needs of a particular segment. Food, beverage, d?cor, themes? All can be tailored to to their needs,? says Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO, Sourav?s. 

 The first corporate night was organised a couple of weeks back where executives were allowed to play bartender for a couple of hours.

 lWhile most of the nightclubs in the city are high on Bollywood tracks, B.E.D (bars, entertainment and dining) on Ballygunge Circular Road, has dedicated a night to trance and underground music. Last Wednesday, it was DJ Nalin from Germany who made revellers trip on tracks like Open Your Eyes, Beach Ball, Soul Shock and Underwater Radio. 

 ?In a country where Bollywood music is so big, very few clubs take the initiative of playing Progressive House. But gradually, party people are placing requests for such music, mainly due to greater exposure to western sounds,? said the DJ. 

 For trance and underground, the milieu should complement the music. ?The mood has to be psychedelic; UV lights further enhance the ambience,? said a spokesperson for B.E.D. 

 ?We had conducted a survey amongst the party people which revealed a good demand for alternative music and so we?ll have it once a month,? he added.

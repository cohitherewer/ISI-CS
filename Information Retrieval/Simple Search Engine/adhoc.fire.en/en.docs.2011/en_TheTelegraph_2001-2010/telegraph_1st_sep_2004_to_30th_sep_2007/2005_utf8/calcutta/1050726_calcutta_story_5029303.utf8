 It?s one of the oldest and largest service club organisations in the world, with over 15 lakh members spread across 193 countries and 46,000 clubs. And in the 50-year history of the Lions Club in India, Ashok Mehta is only the second Indian to have been elected president of the International Association of Lions Clubs. 

 ?It?s a great honour, given the nature of the work this organisation does and its reach all over the world,? said Mehta, who is based in Mumbai, during a stopover in the city from Bangladesh on Sunday. 

 As far as Lions are concerned, India is only second in strength, with 1.5 lakh members and 5,500 clubs, while the US has 3.5 lakh members in 15,000 clubs. 

 Mehta?s term as the global president began this month when he took over from American Clement F. Kusiak, and will terminate in June next year. 

 ?There are some key areas that I would like to emphasise on during my stint,? Mehta said. ?Earlier, cataract was a big issue and we put in a lot of effort into it. Now, preventing blindness, particularly in children, is what we are working on.? 

 Children are the focus in value education as well. ?We?ve seen a remarkable effect on children in various schools where we?ve organised value education programmes. A parent came up to us and said that now his child stops him even if he?s jumped a red light,? laughed Mehta. HIV/AIDS awareness is the other area of work. 

 The journey of the 70-year-old began in this by-invitation-only organisation as a secretary of Mumbai?s Matunga club in 1963. ?I was working in Mukand Iron amp; Steel Company and was involved in various kinds of social work.? His family was involved in the Quit India movement. 

 ?When I moved on to a senior position in the company, some shareholders asked whether I?d be able to do justice to the company while devoting so much time to Lions. The management then stood by me and said that through me, they were making their contribution to society? Mehta recalled. 

 Several positions later ? including district governor and director ? the process of his being elected president began in 2000. ?From financial transparency to character, various factors are taken into account, making it a lengthy procedure.? 

 Mehta has tales to tell about his meeting heads of states. While the Chinese premier took keen interest in a book on Gandhi that he presented, the Governor-General of Australia discussed cricket and economics. 

 ?I see a great interest in India in the past few years, largely due to the country?s performance. This helps us highlight issues affecting our country,? offered Mehta. He is scheduled to meet US president George W. Bush and his wife next month, when he will try to push issues on US aid.

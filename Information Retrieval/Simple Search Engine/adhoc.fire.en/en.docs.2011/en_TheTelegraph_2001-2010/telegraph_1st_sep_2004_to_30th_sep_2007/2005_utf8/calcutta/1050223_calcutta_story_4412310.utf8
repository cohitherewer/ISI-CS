 Nod for transfer of lease-hold land rights

 - Salt 

Lake commercial plots unfettered

 The government has identified at least 310 commercial plots in Salt Lake ? 130 of them in Sector V ? that have been lying unutilised for years. A Telegraph picture

 Lease-hold rights of commercial and industrial plots in Salt Lake can be transferred from now. The state cabinet decided on Tuesday that those who have taken industrial and commercial plots in the township on lease for 999 years can transfer the holding rights after obtaining the government?s consent. 

 ?This is an outright transfer of the lease-hold right and it is being allowed subject to payment of a fee and adherence to certain conditions,? state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said. 

 The conditions include an undertaking that the plot will not be put to any use other than what had been specified during the allotment.

 There are around 310 industrial and commercial plots in Salt Lake, and according to the government?s reports, at least 130 ? mostly in Sector V ? have been lying unutilised for years, ?although possession had been taken several years ago?. 

 According to the urban development department?s proposal submitted to the government: ?Sector V is becoming one of the major centres of industrial activity in the state. Efforts are on to declare Sector V an industrial township. It is, therefore, essential to get the plots of the area gainfully utilised? but one of the reasons why this is not becoming possible is that none of the lessees of vacant plots is willing to surrender the land? as they do not stand to gain economically?? 

 This is the reason why the government has decided to allow the transfer of lease-hold rights, Bhattacharya explained. A change in the nature of a unit, too, has been allowed against a payment. If anyone switches over to IT, the fee is Rs 10,000 per cottah. And for switching over to a non-IT unit, it is Rs 20,000 per cottah.

 For a transfer of the holding right, the present lessee has to pay Rs 1.5 lakh a cottah to the government if the plot is industrial, and Rs 3 lakh a cottah if the plot is commercial. 

 The government hopes the move will put an end to illegal transfer of plots in Salt Lake. ?It is true the lessees will gain enormously, but the new system is much better than illegal transfers, which do not benefit the government,? minister Bhattacharya said. ?The important thing is that the supply of land will increase.?

 The finance department is considering whether a stamp duty can be charged for registration.

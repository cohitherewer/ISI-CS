 Practice sop spurs revamp cry

 - Teaching doctor cadre wants better facilities

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two days after the CPM decided in principle to allow teaching doctors to engage in private practice, a section of physicians has urged the government to carry out immediate and extensive reforms in the health sector.

 The government had banned private practice by teaching doctors 16 years ago.

 The Association of Health Service Doctors, a pro-government lobby, has submitted to the government a list of demands. ?The Medical Education Service was introduced in the state to serve the students better. It is not just enough to allow doctors to carry out private practice. Several other changes should also be considered,? said Gautam Mukherjee, association secretary.

 The doctors? demands include a satisfactory hike in the budgetary allotment for the Medical Education Service and that those being inducted into the teaching cadre be allowed to join regular sessions on the advancements in medical sciences. 

 A revamp of infrastructure at the medical colleges is also on the charter of demands.

 ?It was not just because we were denied the right to practise on our own that some of us had put in our papers,? said said Ashok Kar, who had recently resigned from the cardiology department of SSKM and joined a private hospital. 

 ?We were also put off by some glaring flaws in the teaching system, both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Those issues are yet to be addressed,? he added.

 Like Kar, Dipesh Mondal (neurology) and Kalyan Bhattacharya (radiology) had resigned from NRS Medical College and Hospital. 

 In fact, a dozen government doctors across the state resign every year, protesting one issue or another. Several of them are teachers.

 The exodus has kicked off a debate on whether the doctors were simply lured by the trappings of the private sector or the state system has gone terribly wrong.

 Hailing the decision to allow teaching doctors to practise, Institute of Child Health director Apurba Ghosh said: ?The decision is a major step towards roping in quality teachers. Earlier, those who taught us also engaged in private practice. But they were never found lacking in the hospital.?

 A large number of doctors are willing to join the teaching cadre. But they need to be assured that they will not lose out on career prospects joining the state sector, Ghosh added.

 Though the state government is still to decide on the modalities of filling up the vacant posts of teachers in medical colleges, officials said those willing to join could apply.

 ?The applicant?s merit will be considered, along with his service record. But let the declaration come from the state government,? said director of medical education C.R. Maity.

 Slum plans put on hold

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic body has abandoned ? or been forced to abandon, as mayor Subrata Mukherjee claims ? plans to turn Calcutta into a city sans slums.

 For the past three years, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had pleaded with the government to either hand over the slum land or ask the controller of thika tenancy to allow construction activities on the land. But the government did neither.

 ?We wanted to present every slum-dwelling family with a decent place to live in. We had to abandon the project even after allotting money for it as we realised that the government was not bothered about the fate of those families,? said the mayor.

 As the land on which the slums have come up belongs to the controller of thika tenancy, the civic body cannot develop it without the government?s consent, explained Shaktibrata Ghosh, CMC?s deputy chief law officer.

 Around 30 per cent of the city?s population lives in over 4,500 registered slums, spread from Tallah to Tollygunge. The Trinamul Congress, bracing for a battle to win a second term for the mayor, cannot afford to ignore the aspirations of these people.

 Mayoral council member (slum development) Javed Ahmed Khan said the civic body had drawn up a Rs 70-crore plan to convert the bustees into multi-storeyed structures, where the residents would have been rehabilitated. 

 Each apartment would have been more spacious than an average dwelling unit in the slums, which measures around 130 sq ft. ?Our plan was to provide the people with proper amenities and also set up community halls and parks for them,? Khan added.

 ?But the state government?s attitude has put paid to the dreams. It seems the CPM does not want to improve the living standards of the slum-dwellers. The party is only interested in gaining political dividends by prolonging the problems,? he alleged. 

 Elaborating on the CMC?s thinking behind the project, mayor Mukherjee said: ?Slum development will never work out unless the slums are phased out and the dwellers become flat-owners. For the past 30 years, nobody has thought on these lines.?

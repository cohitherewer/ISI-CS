 Woman?s journey in performance

 For Malavika Sarukkai, who staged Kashi Yatra on Friday evening, there is no separating dance from the woman.

 ?It is my reality. The structure and form is never given, it is something you have to find, and once you find it, it?s an intense emotion that will most definitely move a person who seeks to look into the performance and not merely at it,? says the Bharatanatyam dancer.

 As for the power of performance, Sarukkai believes it lies in the magic merger of then and now. ?It is a language that speaks only in the present tense with its own grammar, punctuation and alphabets? (yet) each performance is an adaptation of feelings and emotions that have concurred over time.?

 Kashi Yatra, first staged in Delhi in 2002 and evolving ever since, is the journey of a courtesan of Benaras, narrated through Bharatanatyam. In Benaras, ?the past is also the continuing present? and legend has it that the entire cosmos is held within the realms of this ancient town.

 Opposites co-exist as do life and death, the quest for pleasure and wealth and the search for spiritual liberation. ?Kashi Yatra is my story of a courtesan and her journey through these different spaces. The courtesan, a woman of taste and refinement, beautiful and adept in the games of love and accomplished in all the arts, is taken from the pages of Kuttanimatham, an 8th Century poem by Damodara Gupta,? says Malavika.

 The courtesan soon moves from this male-dominated society into a gender-free life of a pilgrim. This portion has been conceived from Bird Song, a poem penned by Malavika?s sister Priya Sarukkai Chhabria.

 Malavika shows through expressions, movements and a distinct state of being this transition where one life is intertwined with so many others. Through the dynamics and textures of dance, she takes her audience ? whether in Calcutta or California ? into the mind, body and being of this young courtesan to bring out a universal thought and ideal.

 ?This is a woman?s journey. It may be rooted in India, but the concept remains universal. After all, it is a human approach to a personal journey that just appears to be on a grand scale. It is about the possibility of change. The place itself is one rich in memories, history and conjoins the past and present in a beautiful unique sense of now.?

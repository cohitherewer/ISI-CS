Rocking on return route

After years of hibernation from mainstream Bollywood, 

Mithun Chakraborty made his big return as the bad guy in Vikram Bhatt?s big-budget 

multistarrer Elaan this weekend. While time will decide whether Mithunda?s 

comeback flies or flops, let?s look back at some of the most-hyped comebacks on 

Bollywood?s barometer.

Rekha: The ageless beauty has been on and off 

box-office glory. After her unchallenged reign in the late 70s and early 80s, 

she faced a stumbling block. Once south Indian superstar Sridevi stormed into 

Bollywood in 1983, Rekha was increasingly sidelined from the mainstream mould. 

It took a heroic turn in Rakesh Roshan?s Khoon Bhari Maang, five years 

later in 1988 for Rekha to rule again. Then, her marriage to businessman Mukesh 

Agarwal meant Rekha going off the screen track. K. C. Bokadia?s Phool Bane 

Angaarey in 1991 got her back into the reckoning. She also made another scorching 

return to Bollywood in Umesh Mehra?s Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996) where 

she got temperatures soaring again with the In the night number. Finally, 

the crowning glory has been her mom act in Koi... Mil Gaya.

Rajesh Khanna: Although his daughters got into 

films, Kakaji was as far away from Bollywood as Sidhu is from silence. 

No one could have imagined that it would be Rishi Kapoor (the two were never the 

best of friends) who would bring Rajesh Khanna back into filmdom with his directorial 

debut Aa Ab Laut Chalen in 1999. The film, marking 50 years of RK Films, 

bombed badly and so did the much-hyped comeback of the romance king of the 70s. 

He did try again, in vain, playing the father figure in the immensely forgettable 

Tusshar-Esha Deol starrer Kya Dil Ne Kaha. Kakaji has another release 

coming up in Paighaam alongside Aman Verma.

Jaya Bachchan: A return to the silver screen 

after 19 long years. Post her last official appearance in Yash Chopra?s romantic 

roulette Silsila in 1981, Jaya came back as a middle-aged mother to Joy 

Sengupta in Govind Nihalani?s Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Ma, based on Mahashveta 

Devi?s Jnanpith Award-winning Bengali novel. The film didn?t quite set either 

the critics or box-office ablaze but it proved to be a very smooth comeback for 

Bollywood?s guddi. She went on to play the anguished mother in Khalid Mohamed?s 

Fiza and the grand and teary Nandini Raichand in Karan Johar?s parent saga 

Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. The smiles and the sobs were back as Preity?s 

mom in Kal Ho Naa Ho.

Zeenat Aman: A 15-year break for the original 

sex bomb of the Indian silver screen. After captivating audiences everywhere with 

Laila main laila in Qurbani and luring Bachchan with Samundar 

mein nahake, Zeenie baby was stuck in a bad marriage with Mazhar Khan. And 

while it is still widely believed that it was Kaizad Gustad?s Boom that 

brought Zeenat back in front of the arclights, it was in fact Mahesh Mathai?s 

Bhopal Express which did the honours. Alongside the talented duo of Kay 

Kay Menon and Naseeruddin Shah, Zeenat was a touch off the beat but to see her 

back was precious enough. And then, of course, came the Chura liya dance 

atop the table for Bade Mia in Boom. Retro rocks! 

Sharmila Tagore: One had to wait all day long 

during the cricket match telecasts to catch her with her Nawab in the suiting-shirting 

advertisement. The offers were there but she was happy in her world. But finally 

she relented by playing Aamir Khan?s grandma in Indra Kumar?s 1998 dud, Mann. 

And then she came closer home playing the ageing star and scheming assassin in 

Rituparno Ghosh?s take off on Miss Marple in Shubho Mahurat. 

Waheeda Rehman: Guru Dutt?s chaudvin ka 

chand married a businessman, had two children, settled in Bangalore and ran 

her cereal business. She made a brief comeback in Yash Chopra?s Lamhe. 

The film flopped but there was critical acclaim galore. Perhaps she should have 

kept her film career at that. Saying yes to friend Anupam Kher?s directorial debut 

was a decision that one of our most beautiful actresses must be still regretting. 

Om Jai Jagadish unanimously hailed as one of the worst celluloid creations 

ever did little to justify the return of Waheedaji to the big screen.

Amitabh Bachchan: Almost half a decade without 

the badshah on the big screen ? painful! And Mrityudaata was no 

answer. If the best thing about the Mehul Kumar film was the item song with Daler 

Mehndi, the film couldn?t have been great shakes. The timing was gone and while 

the look did go with the drunk doctor image it hardly sent the pulse of a nation 

in wait racing. The films that followed were even worse and it was left to Siddharth 

Basu and his thinktank to come up with his perfect comeback, ironically on the 

small screen.

Dimple Kapadia: Forget the Leelas and 

Dil Chahta Hais. The big Dimple comeback happened long back in Ramesh Sippy?s 

Sagar. The baby fat of Bobby was gone and so were the marital problems. 

It was time to don the red sari and slide by the swimming pool even as the reflection 

of the waters made her look heavenly. And who can forget the sneak peek by the 

sea, which had the pause buttons of many a remote control stuck once and for all. 

It was a grandiose comeback ? of Dimple the woman and Dimple the star. 

The others: Mumtaz had tried to return on the 

wings of the Prosenjit-starrer Aandhiyan. Rati Agnihotri has had a mixed 

bag ? Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi, Yaadein, Kaatein? Deepti Naval 

was good as the elder woman in love with the young guy in Freaky Chakra. 

Sunil Dutt played reel-life father to real-life son Sanjay Dutt in Munnabhai 

MBBS. Rishi Kapoor is slated to return (yet again) with Hriday Shetty?s Pal 

Tham Gaya opposite his Bobby, Dimple Kapadia. Jaya Prada returned as 

Bachchan?s wife in Khakee and will romance Dino Morea in Deh. And 

the big one: Kajol will come back opposite Aamir Khan in Kunal Hum Tum 

Kohli?s next fluffy fare. 

But we await the mother of all comebacks ? Madhuri 

Dixit, who chose baby over Bolly...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Muggles must wait till dawn 

 - Much-awaited cardboard cartons arrive with coveted book

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Copies of the latest Harry Potter arrive at a distribution centre on Friday night. Picture by Aranya Sen 

 It could well have been Diagon Alley. Instead, it was a passageway with a haunted look, off Lindsay Street, that led not to the Leaky Cauldron but to India Book House (IBH). And both the magic world of wannabe wizards and the muggle world of rain-rinsed Calcutta played host to Harry Potter.

 At around 8 pm on Friday, the rundown building housing IBH came alive as cardboard cartons from Mumbai started streaming in. They were not textbooks for the next term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The only giveaway to their precious contents ? the blue sticker proclaiming ?Bloomsbury? and ?16?.

 Bloomsbury meant the titles had to be Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (HPB) and 16 signified the number of books per carton that were slowly filling up the floor of one long room at the distribution centre. There were 3,500 pieces of J.K. Rowling?s latest offering coming into IBH ? of the 9,500 shipped into Calcutta on Friday ? and they would all stay put till the clock struck 12 midnight at London.

 ?The books started moving to IBH and Indian Book Distributors late this evening under security cover. Only internal work will be allowed till 4.30 am. After the UK launch, they will be moved out to stores and smaller distributors,? explained Nirmalya Roychoudhury, eastern region head of Penguin India.

 From the UK to Mumbai to the central business district of Calcutta to city bookstores early on Saturday, when it reaches groggy-eyed Potter pals at 6.30 am ? the journey for HPB has been a long and exciting one.

 ?There was high risk because of the hype around the book,? said Anil Syal, vice-president, marketing, Safexpress Private Limited, responsible for warehousing and distributing the new Harry Potter title across India. 

 ?We handled the release of The Order of the Phoenix as well, but this time the number of copies has doubled from 68,000 to over 1.3 lakh,? Syal said.

 In it, Calcutta?s copy count (officially, at least) is less than Delhi (48,000), Mumbai (20,000) and Bangalore (14,000), but more than Hyderabad (5,500), Ahmedabad (1,600) and Pune (2,600).

 Security, everywhere, is of utmost concern, with the books placed under 24x7 electronic surveillance with guards manning storage centres.

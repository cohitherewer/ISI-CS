 Judge count drops

 - CASE PILE-UP FEARED AT HIGH COURT

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court, with 30 judges against a sanctioned strength of 50. A Telegraph picture

 Already short, and dwindling. The number of judges in Calcutta High Court will be reduced further in the coming week. 

 Justice Altamas Kabir, acting chief justice of the court, has been elevated to the post of chief justice of Jharkhand and will assume office on March 1.

 The second senior judge, Justice N.A. Chowdhury, will be appointed acting chief justice the same day, but he will retire after three days.

 After Justices Kabir and Chowdhury leave, the number of judges in the high court will come down to 30, against the sanctioned strength of 50. Lawyers fear the scarcity of judges will affect the process of clearing the pending cases.

 Three years ago, when the number of pending cases had touched 3.1 lakh, then Chief Justice A.K. Mathur had adopted several measures to speed up disposal of cases. In the past three years, the number of pending cases have dropped to 2.52 lakh.

 Since Justice Mathur left, the high court has been headed by acting chief justices.

 ?With the shortage of at least 20 judges in the court, cases are bound to pile up,? said Sardar Amjad Ali, president of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association.

 ?The process of appointing new judges cannot start until a permanent chief justice is appointed, as only the chief justice has the authority to recommend the names of advocates for the posts of judges. Our association has been repeatedly asking the Centre to appoint a permanent chief justice,? he added.

 Uttam Majumdar, former secretary of the association, alleged that the state government was not taking any initiative in the appointment of new judges.

 ?The government should ask the Centre for immediate appointment of a permanent chief justice. For some strange reason, the government does not want to strengthen the judiciary of the state,? he complained. 

 According to association secretary Chandi Charan Chakraborty, unless the number of judges in the high court is increased, the supervision of the 202 subordinate courts in the state will not be possible. 

 The responsibilities of the high court include supervision of the daily functioning of the subordinate courts. 

 High court sources said the number of pending cases in the lower courts in the state has increased. ?In 2002, the number of pending cases had been nearly seven lakh. In the past year, it was reduced to 5.12 lakh. But the figure, currently at 5.9 lakh, is on the rise again,? an official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Almost all channels on the small screen are ready with their Valentine?s Day packages. Here?s what some of them have to offer.

 Shah Rukh, Rani and Kajol in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai 

 It?s not going to be just celebrations of Valentine?s Day on MAX but of the Valentine season. The channel is airing some classic romantic Hindi movies, Monday to Friday, on Dil Se Dil Tak ? A Film Festival of Love Stories. Started on February 7 and continuing till February 25, there are goodies galore for the lovesick or just plain fans of mush movies.

 Offerings include the Madhuri-Aamir starrer Dil, Hrithik and Amisha?s blockbuster Kaho Naa... Pyar Hai, Amitabh at his romantic best in Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Subhash Ghai?s reincarnation saga Karz, and a lot more.

 V-Day, however, is reserved for Karan Johar?s Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, the tearjerker that propelled Johar, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukherjee to great heights and grossed crores at the box office.

 So with or without your Valentine by your side, catch these movies every weekday on MAX at 5 pm. It?s a date.

 The Shom Theke Shoni slot for the V-Day week on Akash Bangla features college romance with its twists and turns. Directed by Debidas Bhattacharjee, 14 February ? Dil Maange More finds Monami and Anindya falling for each other on campus. Starring Neel, Kunal Mitra and Rwita Datta Chakraborty, the six-episode Shahityer Shera Somoy also tugs at the heartstrings with Subodh Ghosh?s story Chittachokor. 

 On Alpha Bangla, love blooms among GenX as well as the salt-and-pepper brigade. Anindita Sarbadhicary?s telefilm, to be aired on Valentine?s Day eve, is called Golemale Ultochale Pirit Koiro Na. It?s about how two friends, Parambrata Chatterjee and Swastika Mukherjee, set up an arranged marriage between the boy?s widower father and the girl?s widowed mother. ?In the process, Param and Swastika end up in love and realise that such a marriage would only mar their prospects of a man-woman relationship,? says Anindita.

 The Paanch Dine Goppo slot on the same channel has the proverbial ugly duckling blossoming into a breathtaking beauty. Sonar Biye, directed by Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha, features June who looks adequately unfashionable with her buck teeth and thick black frames.

 The love saga continues on ZMZ, with three back-to-back romantic movies. Barbra Streisand and Nick Nolte star in The Prince of Tides at 11.30 am in a story about the memories that haunt us and the truth that sets us free. Next up, at 6.30 pm, is The Wedding Planner, a romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey. Cosy up later to Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore in Laws of Attraction at 9 pm. 

 But there?s more than just films on offer, especially if you?re looking for a sympathetic ear. Talk to Aftab Shivdasani on Suniyo Re, a Valentine?s Day special on Zee Music, which has Aftab playing love guru from 3 pm. 

 Cupid shoots arrows all through February 14 on MTV, replacing regular programmes with Valentine specials. Watch out for 60-minute Valentine?s Day segments like Pehla Pyaar, the Greatest Pataoing/Manaoing Songs, Dilwaale Gaane, Greatest Love Scenes, Greatest Duets, the most romantic Indipop Songs, Dilwaale Gaane, Pehla Pyaar and the most Sensual Songs Ever. 

 It?s also a chance to woo your Valentine with gifts. MTV will reward viewers for staying tuned with the Pappi Pakdo, Prize Pao contest. Watch non-stop love songs all day and spot the kisses (Pappis) on air. Catch them as they happen on screen, in the lyrics or even spot non-human objects in the act, such as two flowers mingling coyly filmi style. SMS your answers (Pappi, name of the song) to 6882 and win prizes. The first SMS received each time wins Rs 1,000. 

A two-hour special love marathon takes over the airwaves 

on Nick. The channel has a host of toon tales in store for kids as part of Smackaroony 

Toonies. The programme features the episode Arnold?s Valentine in Hey Arnold, 

where he gets caught with two girls for dinner.

 In It?s Cupid Stupid, every Rugrat is mustering up the courage to ask their crush to go for the Valentine?s Day dance. But when Dil?s new friend, the mysterious Lil Q (real Cupid ? complete with magical hackeysacks instead of arrows), mixes up whose crush is on whom, jealousy and envy threaten to ruin the day. 

 In Love Potion 9.368, a laboratory mishap makes boy genius Jimmy (Neutron), Carl and Sheen fall madly in love with the next female they see. The Valentine?s magic continues on The Fairly Odd Parents, too, in the episode Love Struck Act 1 and 2. 

 In true AXN style, it?s an action-packed Valentine?s Day, with four films lined up in Shot Through the Heart. It?s a thrill-ride all the way with Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in The Return of the Mummy. Love goes wrong, and then right again, with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in The Mexican.

 Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas fight the bad guys in Desperado, followed by the golden oldie Top Gun, with a very young Tom Cruise in the lead.

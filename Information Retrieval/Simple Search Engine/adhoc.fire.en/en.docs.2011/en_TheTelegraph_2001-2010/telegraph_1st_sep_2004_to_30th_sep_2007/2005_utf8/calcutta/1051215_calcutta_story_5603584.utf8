 The First Indian International Women?s Film Festival, taking place at 89 Cinemas and Priya cinema, is seeing a steady stream of film-makers and actresses breezing through town. After the inauguration by Sonali Kulkarni on December 12, film-maker Sai Paranjpye is here to attend a retrospective on her.

 The package includes Sparsh, Disha, Papiha, Saaz and Bhago Bhoot. The former chairman of Children?s Film Society of India is now planning to start her next feature, Xapai (meaning grandfather in colloquial Konkani), sometime in March. Sai will write and direct the English-Hindi-Konkani film set in Goa.

 ?It?s about a Goan Christian family with a very strong Portuguese hangover. There?s this old man living in a beautiful crumbling building, with his maid, cook and driver. He is approaching 90 and so his children gather around him. There?s a lot of family intrigue? It?s a black comedy and Habib Tanvir will play the lead,? says Sai, also planning to release Chakachak ? a children?s film on environment issues made in 2004 ? in Calcutta, in the DVD format. ?Chakachak is certainly not my best film, but it got me the best press ever,? says she.

 ?Disha is my favourite film and it?s very sad that the prints are not being preserved properly. I don?t even know if a proper print of Saaz or Sparsh exists or not,? rues the film-maker who started out as a radio announcer before switching to theatre and cinema. 

 Other Indian women film-makers featured in the ongoing festival are Aparna Sen, Mira Nair, Deepa Mehta, Gurinder Chadha, Pamela Rooks and Meghna Gulzar. The world cinema section showcases works from Hungary, France, Iran, USA, Poland, Italy, Russia and Norway, with Germany in the international focus. The seven-day festival has been organised by Kolkata Film and Media Studies.

 The rising number of road deaths has prompted the traffic department of Calcutta Police to turn to the celluloid and launch a sensitisation drive for drivers.

 The film, portraying the condition in which the families of accident victims are forced to live, is intended to be an eye-opener for the drivers. 

 ?We want the drivers to weep after watching what they have done to these families. We want them to understand that their reckless driving is responsible for this. We want them to repent,? asserted Banibrata Basu, special additional commissioner of police (traffic), who is supervising the project.

 An officer of the traffic department said the film would show how a victim?s family is eking out a living. ?The family members will also recollect the memories of their near and dear one, who had either died or had been injured seriously in a road accident.?

 The film will be dubbed in English and Hindi and screened for drivers of commercial vehicles. ?We will ask the drivers? unions to inform us before they call a meeting of their members. Our officers will go to the venue and screen the film,? Basu said.

 ?We hope the film will bring about some changes in the drivers? minds. The principal reason behind reckless driving is the commission system. The more passengers they pick up, beating other buses on the route, the more they earn. The drivers may realise after watching the film what irreparable damage they have caused to countless families, only to earn a few extra bucks,? he added.

 The film also aims to tutor motorists and pedestrians about basic traffic norms. A city-based schoolboy will play the anchor?s role.

 He will first tell the audience what he has learnt in school about traffic norms. Then, he will visit various spots and point out the violations committed by motorists and pedestrians. Every time he comes across a pedestrian or a motorist violating norms, he will ask him why he went against the law. The interaction will be recorded and shown in the film, said another officer. 

 Elaborating on the project, Basu said: ?We are trying to strike a chord in the drivers? minds. Talking to them on several occasions, we have found they are not insensitive, after all. After an accident, the guilty driver repents. And we want to exploit this sentiment.?

 Identity swap to freedom

 - Murder accused impersonates cell-mate, walks out of court

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 It was the bail prayer of convict A, but in the dock was convict B. So, when the court granted bail to convict A, it was convict B who walked free on Tuesday.

 A Bollywood-style identity swap left cops clutching for clues on Wednesday after a murder accused managed to obtain bail by proxy from Barrackpore trial court.

 Sushanta Mondal, accused of murdering his wife in April 2003 at Ghola, near Sodepur, had spent two years in prison till Tuesday afternoon, when he impersonated Ramen Das, a petty thief and drug addict, to be granted bail by the court inspector at Barrackpore court.

 Both Mondal and Das had been brought to the Barrackpore trial court lock-up from Barrackpore jail on Tuesday. Mondal made it to the courtroom, while Das did not.

 How did Mondal manage the audacious body swap under the gaze of cops and court officials? Das alleged he had been drugged by the murder accused.

 ?I dragged hard on the cigarette he (Mondal) had given me in the lock-up, and suddenly, my knees buckled and I collapsed on the floor. I lost consciousness after that,? Das told sub-divisional officer (SDO), Barrackpore, P.B. Salim, on Wednesday.

 ?Someone in the lock-up told me what had happened. I panicked. I went up to the policemen outside the lock-up and asked them to look for Mondal. But they refused to believe my story and bundled me into the waiting van, which brought me back to the jail ? this time as killer Sushanto Mondal,? Das added.

 Only when Das reached Barrackpore jail was the case of the identity crisis cracked. Officials refused to allow Das back into prison, ?as he had been granted bail?.

 With Das in no man?s land and Mondal missing, the matter came knocking on the police door. 

 Additional inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya said on Wednesday that the Barrackpore jail authorities had handed Das over to Barrackpore police station, where an FIR was lodged against both him and Mondal.

 ?It is the police?s duty to probe how Das landed up in jail instead of Mondal,? added Bhattacharya.

 That is the howdunnit the cops are struggling to solve. District magistrate Manoj Pant said a probe has been ordered to identify the real culprits.

 ?Action will be taken if policemen at the lock-up are found guilty of a nexus with court officials,? he warned.

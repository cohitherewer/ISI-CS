 Plays for a purpose

 A city-based NGO, Panchali ? the Women Power, presents National Theatre Festival 2005, featuring plays in almost all major Indian languages like Hindi, Bengali, Manipuri, Chhatisgaria and Malayalam. A six-day event, it is spread over five auditoriums across the city and participated by renowned theatre-groups. The festival is being held to raise funds for Panchali?s ongoing initiative in transcribing the entire corpus of Tagores literary works into Braille for the benefit of sightless children. Apart from regular shows, Panchali also proposes to hold open-air performances at the Rabindra Sadan complex from December 4 to 7, daily at 4.30 pm. Beginning today, the festival?s inaugural performance at Madhusudan Mancha, features Rangakarmee?s Kashinama, directed by Usha Ganguly (a scene from the play appears above). Other plays to be performed at the festival include Raja (tomorrow at 10 am) by Blind Opera, Charandas Chor (tomorrow at 6.30 pm) by Naya Theatre and Sidhartha by Abhinaya.

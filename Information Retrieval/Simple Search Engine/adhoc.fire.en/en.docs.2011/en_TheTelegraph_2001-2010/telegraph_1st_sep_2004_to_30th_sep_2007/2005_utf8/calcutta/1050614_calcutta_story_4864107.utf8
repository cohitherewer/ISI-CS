 Clause shift aborts organ transplants

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Saswata Choudhury will probably die, waiting for a liver transplant. The 50-year-old came very close to getting a lifeline last Friday, but the government?s failure to amend a simple clause in a law adopted eight years ago has left him with no hope. 

 In 1997, exactly four years after the Centre passed the Human Organ Transplantation Act in Parliament, it became easy for doctors to go ahead with cadaver transplants in Calcutta and rest of Bengal. But it was only a legal provision. 

 In actuality, Calcutta doctors cannot undertake cadaver transplants because in all these years, the government has failed to come up with a list of ?neutral? doctors who would certify ?brain-stem death?. 

 The law says that four doctors, two from the institution where a patient becomes brain dead and two ?neutral doctors? from other centres, must certify death to clear all obstacles for cadaver transplant.

 Last week, doctors at the Apollo Gleneagles Hospital learnt to their dismay that they could not go ahead with four transplants because the government did not want them to do so.

 ?A 21-year-old youth, who had suffered a road accident, came to our hospital. We could not save him and he was declared brain dead on Friday,? said intensive care specialist Suresh Ramasubban.

 When the youth?s family agreed to donate the body, the Apollo team decided to carry out several organ transplants. 

 ?We checked out our list and found there were many people waiting for a transplant. Therefore, everything was ready for transplant of the liver, lung, pancreas and kidney, but just to make sure that all legal formalities were taken care of, we called up health department officials. They told us that we could not go ahead because they did not have a list of doctors ready as yet,? recalled Lakshminarayan, head of nephrology department at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.

 ?Since we were left with no alternative, we called up all the possible recipients and told them that everything was cancelled. They broke down,? added Lakshminarayan.

 Last October, the government had called a special meeting where it was declared that it was keen to initiate an organ retrieval plan. But the one-off meeting was not fruitful.

 Gana Darpan, an NGO working in the field of organ retrieval programmes, and Debasish Banerjee, a transplant surgeon from AMRI Hospitals, have been trying to speed up things. 

 ?We have submitted a proposal to the government to start a centre in the city. We have also submitted a list of 15 well-known doctors who would volunteer as neutral experts to certify brain-stem deaths,? Banerjee said.

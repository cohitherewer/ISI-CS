 No signs of retreat

 - Arms 

 pile-up in squatters? colony 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Even three days after being issued a police ultimatum, not a single occupant of the shanties of Rabindra Sarobar has given any indication of leaving the spot on his own. 

 Their determination has prompted police as well as the Eastern Railway authorities to chalk out an elaborate plan for carrying out a peaceful eviction drive.

 Fearing strong resistance from the squatters during the proposed eviction drive, the city and state police have deployed plainclothesmen in Gobindapur so that firearms are not brought in from outside the area.

 ?We were informed that the squatters are trying to smuggle in large quantities of bombs, guns and other ammunition to counter police action and foil the eviction drive. So, we?ve posted men in the area. Some of our officers are keeping a vigil at night as well,? said a senior officer of city police.

 The last eviction drive by police and the railways on March 2 had to be called off after it was reported that squatters had gathered huge quantities of arms and ammunition in their shanties.

 The officer said forces from three police stations under Calcutta Police and three more from West Bengal Police would be present during the eviction drives. The police stations that have been asked to keep teams ready are Tollygunge, Lake and Charu Market (Calcutta Police) and Jadavpur (East and West) and Kasba. The deputy commissioner (south), under the leadership of deputy commissioner (headquarters) and the top brass of the Government Railway Police will be present during the raids.

 On Monday, Calcutta Police had alleged that the squatters were hurling bombs at night to terrorise the men in uniform.

 Mayor prod for early track repair

 OUR BUREAU

 The Left Front civic board has reversed its predecessor?s policy on repair of tram tracks and roads laid with them.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said on Wednesday that one of the priorities of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was to get a road and tram-track repair programme underway at the earliest.

 All through its five-year regime, the previous Trinamul Congress board had maintained that the uplift was the responsibility of the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC). The authorities had even put up billboards expressing their inability to repair the tracks and the roads.

 Mayor Bhattacharya asserted that the billboards would be removed and repairs started immediately. ?Trams are our heritage, they need to be preserved? The earlier board had evaded its responsibility and passed the buck to CTC.? 

 On Wednesday, representatives of both CMC and CTC inspected the roads where large craters have developed because of damaged tracks and prepared a ?situation report? for the mayor. ?We have identified the worst stretches. In immediate terms, around Rs 10 crore will be spent on repairing eight km of tracks,? said Tuhin Bera, mayoral council member (roads). ?Our objective is to have the tracks repaired before the Pujas.?? 

 CTC managing director S.N. Pal said stretches of Rabindra Sarani, MG Road, Nirmal Chandra Street and BB Ganguly Street would be repaired immediately. Soon to be taken up are BK Pal Avenue and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. Around Rs 2.5 crore had already been spent on the repair of Elliot Road, APC Road, RG Kar Road and Bidhan Sarani.

 ?Presently, CTC and Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners are repairing the tracks. The CMC will join soon. If the three agencies work together, repairs will proceed fast,? said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. 

 He, however, admitted that a facelift would require a lot of money. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta has been approached for funds.

 Foreign feathers are fewer 

 - BIRD CENSUS SHOWS DROP IN OVERSEAS VISITORS

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Migratory birds from overseas ? including pintails, falcated teals, comb ducks, shovellers, gadwals, tufted pochards and garganeys ? are giving Calcutta the slip, confirms the Mid-Winter Waterfowl Census 2005.

 The findings add that it?s mostly local migratory birds, mainly from the Chhotanagpur plateau, North Bengal and the Northeastern states, that are keeping their winter date with the waterbodies at Alipore zoo, Nalban and Santragachhi between October and February.

 The census was conducted at these three major retreats for migratory birds in mid-January by NGO Prakriti Samsad and, for the first time, the state forest department. Every year, a report on the census is sent to the Asian Wetland Bureau, where it is incorporated into the Asian Waterfowl Census.

 Trans-Himalayan birds like the pintail, gadwal and the garganey used to flock in thousands to the waterbody at Nalban till a few years ago. This year, however, the pintail did not visit at all, while the number of gadwals was fewer than in previous years. Migrant population of other ducks like garganey, shoveller, tufted pochard, common shellduck and wigeon have also dropped drastically.

 Kushal Mukherjee of Prakriti Samsad said: ?Nalban used to host around 5,000 migratory birds in the past.? This year, the number is down to 1,007. 

 The number of the migratory birds has also dwindled at Rabindra Sarobar, with only about 150 local migrant birds, mainly cormorants, turning up this year. ?Till 2000, about 300 night herons came here every winter. But this year, there were hardly any. We have stopped conducting a census here, since the number of birds is insignificant,? rues Mukherjee.

 Going by the findings of the Mid-Winter Waterfowl Census 2005, Santragachhi remained a popular haunt for the feathered visitors this year, but mostly for the local migrants. ?Attempts to conserve the waterbody will ensure that the wetlands continue to attract more migratory birds,? a forest department official said. The Eurasian wigeons, falcated teals, Baikal teals and shovellers have stopped coming here, while attendance of gadwals, northern pintails, pond herons, cattle egrets and even the common moorhen has thinned considerably.

 Environment experts blame the decline in the number of foreign migrant birds on the disturbed ecological balance of the sites.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Curtains on screen soothsayers

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses is published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should astrology programmes on television be banned? More letters will be published next week

 Subhankar mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan

 People who stay glued to the television 

 to watch astrology programmes are all sensible and mature. 

 They need not be told what is good or bad for them. Rejection 

 of such programmes by the audience would be more effective 

 than a ban. Mass awareness is the only way to keep superstitions 

 at bay. 

 Sudeshna ghosh, 

 Bonhooghly

 It is ridiculous the way astrology 

 programmes are proliferating on private channels. In fact, 

 there is a channel which airs only astrology programmes. 

 Such content merely disgusts sensible viewers and confuses 

 weak-minded ones. Allowing the programmes to be aired helps 

 in the spread of unscientific practices.

 Sampurna majumder, 

 Salt Lake

 People have always been interested 

 in knowing the future. A handful exploits this interest 

 claiming to foretell events. There is no way to verify their 

 claim, yet almost all local channels air astrology programmes. 

 The fortune-tellers take advantage of vulnerabilities to 

 push their products and services. The programmes should 

 be stopped. 

 Indranil sengupta, 

 Salt Lake

 I don?t think astrology programmes 

 need to be banned. Instead, television channels must enforce 

 stricter guidelines to prevent astrologers, who exploit 

 people, from coming on air. Astrology itself is not bad, 

 but some of its practitioners give it a bad name. The credentials 

 of astrologers who come on television must be checked. This 

 will reduce the possibility of the general public being 

 fooled.

 Payel bhattacharyya, 

 Diamond Harbour Road

 Most of the astrologers are unscrupulous. 

 They make people vulnerable and then exploit their weakness 

 to earn a living. It is important to ban astrology programmes 

 from television.

 t.r. anand,

 Budge Budge 

 Astrology programmes should be 

 banned on television as thousands of youngsters watch them 

 for solutions to their problems. Instead of working hard, 

 they start thinking that they can improve their position 

 by wearing stones and charms. 

 Kalyan ghosh,

 Park Street

 Astrology programmes should most 

 certainly be banned and the earlier the better. The subject 

 has no scientific basis and a lot of people are cheated 

 in its name. Fortune-tellers should not be allowed to use 

 a medium like television, which has a vast reach. The print 

 media should also discontinue publication of astrological 

 predictions.

 nirmal Biswas,

 Hridaypur Station Road

 Though fortune-tellers claim that 

 astrology is a science, it is nothing but a way of exploiting 

 those who suffer from indecision and uncertainty. With the 

 growth of the television audience, the malpractice is spreading 

 fast. Astrology programmes must be banned. Mass awareness 

 is necessary to root out the problem.

 iNdranil sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 No, there should not be a ban. 

 Astrology is based on calculations and can be quite accurate. 

 Human life is complicated and people struggle to find the 

 right path. If astrologers can show the way, they should 

 be allowed to. An astrologer should be given a chance to 

 prove his prowess. As far as misguiding people is concerned, 

 several serials are guilty of that. It?s unfair to put the 

 blame on astrologers alone. However, if an astrologer takes 

 advantage of his position, he should be punished. 

 Sushma jalan, 

 Alipore

 Astrology programmes on television 

 should certainly be banned, as they do nothing but misguide 

 people. It is impossible to predict the future of someone 

 just by listening to him or her for a minute. The fortune- 

 tellers either give false hopes or end all hopes. Their 

 irresponsible comments can even push people to suicide. 

 Study of astrology requires dedication and patience. Those 

 who come on air can do much harm by putting to practice 

 their half-baked knowledge.

 moumita nandi,

 Behala 

 Astrology is simply a shrewd way 

 of fooling people to earn money. It is not science by the 

 wildest stretch of imagination. People in power should not 

 remain aloof and let the astrologers do as they please. 

 A ban should immediately be enforced. 

 C.V.K. Murthy, 

 alipore

 The airing of astrological programmes 

 should be banned. Astronomy is a science, but astrology 

 encourages superstition. I know of many cases where otherwise 

 suitable matrimonial matches have not been made as the horoscopes 

 did not match. Those who have faith in God should not believe 

 in astrology. I am surprised that even educated people consult 

 astrologers and wear rings set with stones prescribed by 

 them.

 alokta chakraborty,

 Address not given

 Astrology programmes on television 

 should be banned. Only frauds come on air in an attempt 

 to cheat people.

 Shiv shanker almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street

 Astrologers on television channels 

 are only interested in cheating people. It is unfortunate 

 that some channels only air astrology programmes throughout 

 the day. Awareness and education are the only way out.

 SAIONEE Chakraborty,

 Sanghati Colony

 Astrology programmes on television 

 are a bane and should be banned immediately. Not only the 

 Bengali channels, but national channels and columns published 

 in newspapers and magazines, help the business to thrive. 

 Asking astrologers silly questions like ?when will I get 

 married? or ?when will I lose weight? reflects a mind infested 

 with superstition and lack of self-belief. While rosy forecasts 

 make these people complacent, the not-so-good ones have 

 a detrimental effect, leading to depression and even suicide. 

 However, implementing a ban would be difficult as the channels 

 bank on the shows for viewership.

 atri bose,

 Salt Lake

 Astrology programmes on television 

 should definitely be banned as soon as possible. The people 

 who call in are frauds and the so-called astrologers pay 

 local channels to air the programmes. They claim that they 

 can forecast the future, but are the ones with the maximum 

 problems in their lives. They should give more priority 

 to their own problems, instead of interfering in other peoples? 

 lives. Moreover, the astrologers give people false hopes.

 arpita mukherjee,

 Kestopur

 Belief or disbelief in astrology 

 is a matter of personal choice. But so many programmes on 

 astrology are aired these days that it has become difficult 

 for viewers to judge who among the astrologers are genuine 

 and who the impostors. Banning of such programmes will certainly 

 stop some people from being misled by astrologers.

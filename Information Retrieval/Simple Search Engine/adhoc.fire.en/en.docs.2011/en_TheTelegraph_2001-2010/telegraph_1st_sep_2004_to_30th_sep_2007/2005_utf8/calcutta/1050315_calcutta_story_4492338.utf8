 Soccer succour in aid of tsunami

 Football to the rescue, after cricket?s failure.

 Weeks after a tsunami fundraiser cricket match between Australia and Asia XI at the Eden Gardens was cancelled due to non-availability of star dates, the Salt Lake stadium is set to host a galaxy of World Cup footballers in a 90-minute exhibition match.

 The June 4 match will see top players from countries like Japan, South Korea, UAE and China, among other nations, brushing shoulders in an Asian XI team, that will take on Team India.

 Prodded by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), which wanted the match to be played in Calcutta, the Indian Football Association (IFA) has gone on an overdrive to ensure that everything goes according to plan.

 ?The venue and date have just been finalised and the players for the Asian XI are being picked,? said Subrata Dutta, honorary secretary of IFA and a member of the Tsunami Relief Task Force. 

 The IFA hopes to collect upwards of Rs 5 crore from the tie. The AFC has planned more such matches around Asia. Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia will turn out for the Asian XI in the matches.

 ?Since players from various countries will arrive in the city at least a day before the match, we are creating a special team to look after the wellbeing of the stars,? Dutta said.

 The biggest hurdle facing Dutta and his team is frequent power cuts at the stadium.

 Last year, a World Cup qualifying match between India and Japan was interrupted by a power cut, with an accusing finger later being pointed at a rat bite. Although power was restored within minutes, All India Football Federation president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi faced flak for the blackout.

 Efforts are on to ensure that power supply to the stadium remains uninterrupted during the exhibition match, IFA officials said.

 ?We are holding talks with officials in the power department to ensure that no fiasco occurs during the match,? Dutta said.

 The IFA is planning to issue Rs-20 tickets for the match to several schools and colleges.

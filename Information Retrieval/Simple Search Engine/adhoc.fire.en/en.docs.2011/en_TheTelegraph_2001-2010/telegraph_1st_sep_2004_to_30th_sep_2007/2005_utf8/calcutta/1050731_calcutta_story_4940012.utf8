 The Friday do was attended by actresses Locket and June, actors Tota Roy Chowdhury and Arjun Chakraborty, singer Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta and RPG Group vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka.

 Sing along

 Sing along between sips and bites. That seems to be the idea at The International Caf? at The Enclave in New Alipore that has started karaoke evenings on Fridays.

 Guests stepping in between 8 pm and 10.30 pm can make themselves heard on the microphone, choosing from a list of 2,100 songs showcased along with the menu on every table. We started the karaoke evenings sometime ago, but initially the response was lukewarm. Gradually it is catching on with the family crowd, says Manish Newar proprietor of the caf?. 

 Karaoke is a new concept in Calcutta. Its there in some pubs and discos, but those dont attract families with kids. Being inside a caf?, this will be more accessible to all, says Sanjeev Sinha, the resident karaoke singer at the caf?.

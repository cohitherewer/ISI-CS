 STAR axes local distributor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It had been termed a move, at the time, to reign in ?rogue? cable operators. But one-and-a-half years later, as two of the three players fall foul of each other, the market has remained much the same.

 STAR India, the country?s most successful broadcaster, announced on Thursday that it would not continue with Indian Cable Net (also the largest multi-system operator in the CMDA area) as its local distributor. 

 STAR sources termed the move of not renewing the contract post-March as a ?routine business decision?. 

 An Indian Cable Net official, however, admitted that the distributorship was not working out for the company. 

 ?Between August 2002 and January 2003, there had been an increase of 170 per cent in what STAR demanded and we were unable to meet that, since operators were not paying up,? the official alleged.

 Indian Cable Net (then called RPG Netcom) picked up the distribution of the STAR and Sony bouquet of channels in September 2003. According to sources, Indian Cable Net, which is on the verge of being bought over by Sun Network?s Gemini channel, is also looking to discontinue with Sony?s distributorship.

 Indian Cable Net had worked on a ?minimum-guarantee-per-month? basis with the two broadcasters.

 First, road Romeos at the door and now a Romeo and Juliet ? maybe not quite ? in the toilet. The spotlight on Wednesday was back on Salt Lake?s City Centre ? again for the wrong reasons ? four days after the eve-tease fracas.

 Police arrested two college students ? the boy 22 and the girl 19 ? drunk and, allegedly, in a compromising position, in the ladies? at City Centre. The two were later released on bail.

 Wednesday?s incident comes close on the heels of a group of school students being rounded up for hounding and harassing actress June and telefilm director Anindita Sarbadhicary near City Centre on Saturday evening.

 Security in and around the mall had been beefed up from Monday in the wake of the tease terror.

 On Wednesday, the arrests were carried out around noon but, according to police, the two offenders had managed to sneak in much earlier. The ladies? toilet on the first floor of the north side of the sprawling mall was where they were holed up for hours.

 The two students were picked up by Sankha Shuvro Chakraborty, SDPO, Salt Lake, who arrived on the spot with a number of lady constables, after being alerted by a private security guard at City Centre.

 A bottle of alcohol and a soft drinks bottle were seized from the toilet.

 ?We arrested the girl and the boy from City Centre after they were caught red-handed committing a nuisance in a public place. They were engaged in indecent behaviour,? confirmed Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 The two were taken to Bidhannagar (North) police station, where they were charged under Section 34 of IPC. Later, both sets of parents were called up and by evening, the two were released on bail.

 Spurred on by the arrest, plainclothes cops and women constables conducted combing operations in City Centre and detained seven youths found loitering on the premises.

 According to Kumar, raids would continue at City Centre in a bid to check eve-teasing and other illegal activities.

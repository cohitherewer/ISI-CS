The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A foul film, a fair game and foot notes

Gulshan Grover at the media briefing, Suniel Shetty at the Grand Cineplex, and 

yet another inane moment from Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav 

 Meant to be more than just another film awards ceremony, the first edition of the Global Indian Film Awards (GIFA), held in Dubai, was a three-day celebration of Bollywood in the UAE. From Tuesday, January 25, to the awards night on Thursday, the filmi trip, organised in association with the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF), was a rollercoaster ride combining everything from film premieres to star soccer matches to fundraising auctions.

 Here are a few notes from the diary of Pratim D. Gupta, who was there to soak in every moment of the action.

 Day 1, Tuesday, January 25

 Time: 8.30 pm

 Venue: Grand Cineplex Theatres

 Agenda: International premiere of Mahesh Manjrekar?s Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav

 Action: That the maker of films like Vaastav and Astitva could even conceive of a nautanki like this, must be seen to be believed. Devoid of a script, not even a wafer-thin storyline to boot, the supposed comedy was an insult to foolishness. Only a handful of Indian journalists sat through the film at screen number six in the huge cineplex.

 The red carpet was laid out but the stars couldn?t reach in time to kickstart the premiere. Suniel Shetty, Gulshan Grover and the film?s leading lady Masumeh Makhija stepped in at the interval. ?We haven?t yet seen the film fully,? announced Gulshan. No wonder he was looking so happy. The only high point of the screening was when the projectionist played a few seconds of American Beauty by mistake. It?s not a surprise now why Padmashree? was struggling to find distributors for the release here in India.

 Postscript: Apart from the cast of the film, which attended the premiere, there were other familiar faces from Bollywood at the Grand Cineplex. But wait! Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif couldn?t possibly bother to spend the evening watching the trash in the form of Padmashree? They went ahead and watched the hottest Hollywood flick of the season, Martin Scorsese?s The Aviator. Model-turned-actor Arjun Rampal also preferred to watch the Leonardo DiCaprio-starrer.

 Day 2, Wednesday, January 26

 Time: Noon

 Venue: Emirates Towers (Ballroom)

 Agenda: Official media launch of GIFA

 Action: The big honchos representing the host of sponsors of the awards, the performers of the show and the organisers got together to brief the local and Indian media about the three-day extravaganza. Sayeed Al Naboudah, CEO of DSF, stressed the importance of the awards to the festival, and vice versa. ?Both GIFA and DSF are meant to promote each other. We have tried to bring the essence of Dubai to GIFA ? everything from the shape of the award to the performances. Indian films are very big here,? he said.

 For industry veterans like Gulshan Grover, GIFA was important for Bollywood too. ?With this three-day festival, the Indian film industry will reach out to more homes here in Dubai,? said the ?bad man?, who is also on the advisory board for the awards. ?And you never know, in the near future, you?ll get to see collaborations between the film industries here and back home. Many Indian films have already been shot here and after this more such movies will be based here.?

 GIFA had aroused a lot of interest in the UAE, with residents voting for the first time for a Bollywood awards ceremony. Said Sameer Khan, vice president of Global Events, organisers of GIFA: ?This is the first time the people of UAE are voting for a Bollywood awards night and the response has been very heartwarming. We?ve received more than 25,000 votes from them and the ticket sales also have been very heartening.? 

 Postscript: The stars attending the media briefing had nothing to say and the media, too, had nothing to ask. Kareena Kapoor looked totally disinterested in what was happening. Diana Hayden defended the presence of so many beauty queens in the acting profession. ?When a director signs a Miss World or Miss Universe, he automatically capitalises on her familiarity across the country rather than taking a rank newcomer and trying to promote her,? she said.

Time: 5 pm

 Venue: Police Officers? Club

 Agenda: Star football match

 Action: Salman?s Red team took on Sohail?s Black team to raise money for the tsunami victims. The money raised in the charity football match will go to the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund. Salman led from the front, scoring two goals and steering his team to a 7-5 victory. 

 Postscript: Salman?s former girlfriend Sangeeta Bijlani was present to watch the match, not to see Sallu whip off his jersey (which surprise, surprise, he never did) but to cheer husband Mohammed Azharuddin who was playing for Sohail?s team. The soccer showstopper, though, was Mr Dhoom, John Abraham. ?Have you seen his legs?? whispered one local girl to another...

 Time: 10 pm

 Venue: Nal Al Sheba

 Agenda: Tsunami Charity Dinner and Auction

 Action: Like back home, Bollywood chipped in and did its bit to raise money for the tsunami survivors. Film outfits, designed by Neeta Lulla and Vikram Phadnis, were on auction and the amounts they fetched had a lot to do with the stars who wore them in the films. Shah Rukh?s blue kurta from Main Hoon Na fetched 30,000 dirhams, while Sushmita?s black and red sari from the same film collected 25,000 dirhams. The auction-cum-dinner was hosted by Perizaad Zorabian who invited other Bollywood celebs to egg the Dubai crowds on.

 Postscript: While most filmstars appeared for the auction-dinner, they all left in a jiffy to attend some major party at a famous club in town. The Prem Chopras, Shakti Kapoors and Feroze Khans were left to handle the starstruck crowds...

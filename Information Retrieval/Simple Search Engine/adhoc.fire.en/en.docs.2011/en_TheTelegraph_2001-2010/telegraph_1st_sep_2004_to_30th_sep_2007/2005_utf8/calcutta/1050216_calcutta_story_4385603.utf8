The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Thief, called by any name

Each week, Metro will ask its readers a 

question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every 

Wednesday. Today?s question: Should book thieves at the Book Fair be treated like 

common thieves?

 Tempting fare: Visitors at the Book Fair. Picture by Aranya Sen 

Sayan Banerjee,

 Belgachhia

Yes. A theft is a theft, and stringent action must 

be taken against anyone who commits such an act. Even books are not worth possessing 

if procured through unfair means. When they are stolen, the very morals they teach 

are trampled on.

Dipro Ray, 

 Address not given

The organisers should build a stage or set up a special 

stall where book thieves should be made to stand in full view of the visitors. 

Once the fair is over, they should be handed over to police.

Arijit Acharya, 

 New Santoshpur

There is one major difference between the theft of 

books and the theft of other objects. While books are stolen for the hunger of 

knowledge, other objects are stolen for material satisfaction. As knowledge enriches 

society and civilisation, book thieves should not be punished in the same way 

as common thieves. 

Priyanka Saha, 

 Birati

Book thieves should be punished more severely than 

common thieves. They bring shame to the city by their actions. Visitors to the 

book fair should help stall owners and fair organisers keep a tab on book thieves. 

Sayahna Bhattacharya,

 Salt Lake 

Book theft at the Book Fair is not uncommon, but most 

of the thieves are different from ordinary thieves. They steal to read. But there 

is definitely another kind of book thieves who steal for money. For the first 

kind, being caught and humiliated is punishment enough. For the latter, jail is 

the right place.

Neha Dokania, 

 Bangur Avenue

Thieves at the Book Fair should be fined an amount 

which is double the price of the book that he or she had tried to steal. Harsh 

punishment for book theft degrades justice. The authorities should consider being 

more vigilant rather than condemning such offences.

Md. Arshad Jamal,

 Collin Street

All thieves should be treated and punished in the 

same manner. If a book thief is given special treatment, then theft in general 

would receive a boost.

Saikat Ghosh,

 Lake Gardens

The resale value of books is nominal, so book thieves 

primarily steal to gain knowledge. Their contact details should be taken and verified 

and they may be given the book they were trying to steal to read and return within 

a specific date. 

Sushma Jalan,

 Behala 

Only true book lovers who cannot afford books attempt 

this petty crime. The majority of book thieves are college students who commit 

this crime due to lack of money.

Rimli Dutta, 

 Salt Lake

A thief, whether he is stealing a book or a diamond 

necklace, is, after all, a thief. The punishment should not depend on the nature 

of the stolen good. In a country like ours, where there is large-scale disparity 

in income levels, if a person, out of abject poverty, steals food, it might be 

pardonable. But the practice of stealing a book to save money for other purposes 

should not be encouraged at all.

Soumita Mallik,

 Lord Sinha Road

Book theft is definitely a crime, but is not comparable 

to robbery and murder. So, book thieves should not be punished like common thieves. 

Steps should be taken to prevent book thefts instead. 

Jyoti Agarwal,

 Lake Town

Just like you can?t judge a book by its cover, you 

can?t make out the motive of a book thief by looking at his face. The authorities 

should do a background check to establish whether the thief was stealing to sell 

or read the book. In case he was stealing to read the book, some mercy should 

be shown to him. 

Sukanta Pachal,

 Howrah

There is a great difference between book thieves and 

professional thieves. The former should be given a chance to rectify themselves. 

But I think everyone will be best served if the organisers of the Book Fair ensure 

that no one is able to steal books. 

Neha sharma,

 New Alipore

 No, book thieves should not be punished like common thieves. Many poor book lovers are left with no option but to steal books to satisfy their quest for knowledge. Unfortunately, there is no way of distinguishing between genuine book lovers and common thieves.

Arunima Chowdhury,

 Dum Dum

 Stealing is a great offence and all thieves are the same. So, why discriminate between them? It is our moral duty to stop book theft by severely punishing the offenders.

Saptadipa Ghosh,

 Serampore

 Thieves are thieves; whether they steal valuables from the house or books from the Book Fair. Why shouldn?t the book thieves be punished and put in prison? They certainly cause loss to booksellers. 

R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Shyamnagar

 All thieves should be punished uniformly. People should be searched more stringently at the Book Fair gates to minimise theft of books.

Jharna Chakraborty,

 Hindmotor

 The quest for knowledge is almost a natural instinct. When there is no fair way of satisfying that instinct, one often resorts to unfair means. So, in my opinion, book thieves should be treated leniently.

Rathi Chakraborty,

 Durgapur Lane

 There are people who despise stealing, but circumstances compel them to steal. But the majority steal out of greed. Book thieves fall in the second category. They should be punished more severely than common thieves.

Satyen Biswas,

 Pathak Para Road

 Book thieves should not be punished like common thieves. They should be given some public punishment that shames them so much that they never again try to steal books. 

Dev Mandi,

 Karl Marx Sarani

 The government cannot say that it wants to spread knowledge and punish book thieves at the same time. Most book thieves steal to read books and enhance their knowledge.

Yashita Banerjee,

 Rashbehari Avenue

 A person who steals books lacks honesty and conscience. That person may acquire vast knowledge through books, but will remain essentially immoral. A real bibliophile never reads books by stealing them.

Kanai Saha,

 Gauri Bari Lane

 Those who steal books at the Book Fair are in no way different from common thieves. Hence, they, along with all other types of thieves, should be given exemplary punishment.

Naren Sen,

 Ramrajatola

 Stealing books is a crime. But one should determine the motive behind the theft before meting out punishment. A serious book lover, without the means to buy books, should not be punished stringently as he is not as dangerous as other types of thieves.

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane

 Book theft at the book fair is not a common occurrence. The number of such incidents can be reduced further by bringing down the price of books.

govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge

 Book thieves should be made to stand before a camera and their images should be shown on a large screen set up on the fair ground.

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 A book thief should be detained at the stall, and released after payment of double the price of the book he was trying to steal. The name and address of the person may be announced through a loudspeaker to add to his humiliation.

Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane

 Book thieves are no better than petty thieves. In fact, they are worse, as they are generally educated and come from good families. They should be punished severely.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Retail, realty forge a bond

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Brace up for the big-box brands in your own backyard. Retail giants like Wal-Mart, Carrefour, IKEA and Kmart could be setting up shop in town way before you would have thought, riding on the back of a strategic alliance announced in Calcutta on Tuesday.

 Global corporate real estate consultancy major NAI, that services brands like Alcatel, Duracell, Siemens and Pizza Hut internationally from its 300 offices in 40 countries, launched its operations in eastern India during the day in association with leading city-based property service firm NK Realtors in a licence agreement.

 ?As part of this tie-up, we are bringing to town Asia Property Group Ltd (APG) for total retail solutions, right from pre-development assessment to operations and management,? Abhijit Malkani, regional director India and Middle East, NAI Global, told Metro.

 APG, which has done over 100 malls internationally, including the likes of Sunset Park Plaza, Los Angeles California, Park Royal Shopping Centre, West Vancouver and GO 2 City, Taoyuan, Taiwan, stepped into Indian territory with The Forum in Bangalore, and is keen to increase presence.

 In Calcutta, NAI is in talks with 16-odd developers, and ?six to seven among them have evinced interest to get on board with APG?, for either large-format malls of 350,000-sq-ft-plus area or concept malls less than 200,000 sq ft, peddling merchandise in a narrow format.

 ?Its not just about selling space and bringing in quality clients. In Calcutta, the trend till now has been to simply appoint an architect and ask him/her to design a swank mall. But to create a sustainable product in the ever-changing retail scenario, a lot of homework must go into the conceptualisation of the mall,? stressed Malkani.

 The APG bouquet of ?comprehensive project services? comes in three stages. Stage I involves project assessment, feasibility analysis and positioning strategy, stage II deals with programme development and implementation and stage III is about operations and management.

 While NAI feels Calcutta is a ?sitting-duck market? for the Wal-Marts of this world to wade in over the next three years, NK Realtors is equally excited about the marriage. ?This alliance will help us deliver services of international quality, thus facilitating tapping of FDIs and convincing MNCs to come to town,? observed R.N. Agarwal, director.

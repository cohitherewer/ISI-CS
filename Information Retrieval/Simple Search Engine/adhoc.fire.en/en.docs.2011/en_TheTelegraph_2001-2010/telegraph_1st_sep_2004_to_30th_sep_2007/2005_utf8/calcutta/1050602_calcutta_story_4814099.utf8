 The Dhakuria Lakes: Vigil all night long.

 Welcome to Rabindra Sarobar, or the Dhakuria Lakes, now being touted by police as a safe spot for Calcuttans to take a stroll.

 Rattled by a rap from the high court for failing to preserve the waterbody, the city police have decided to recast the vigilance system in the area, while keeping an eye on possible sources of pollution. 

 As a first step towards a coordinated movement to preserve the waterbody, police have roped in the Calcutta Improvement Trust to put in place a system that will cover the Lakes on all sides.

 Police have recommended increasing the height of the boundary wall around the Lakes at certain points and setting up three gates. 

 A thorough scan of the area by senior officers and members of the force deployed by the Lake police station revealed 13 points on the boundary wall that needed immediate renovation.

 ?We have identified the problem areas and, accordingly, deployment of forces has been beefed up. The number of constables on duty around the Lakes has been increased and round-the-clock vigil introduced. An officer will be leading the teams on each shift,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Besides, a special force from the Lalbazar headquarters has been brought in to further beef up security.

 During interactions with the men on duty, officers realised that a key problem plaguing the area has been lack of adequate lights. Based on the feedback, the Calcutta Improvement Trust has been asked to instal fluorescent lights across the stretch so the securitymen can effectively guard the sprawl.

 ?The lights are urgently required as often, after sunset, residents of the Gobindopur colony slip in and take a dip or wash clothes in the Lakes,? said an officer.

 ?We are not just asking our constables to go and do their duty. We are urging them to deliver in earnest. Briefing sessions are being held almost every day to drive home the point that protecting and preserving the Lakes is more than just a duty. It is a mission,? said Sukumar Chakrabarty, officer-in-charge of Lake thana. 

 Sources said the force is deployed on three shifts, and the briefing usually takes place at the beginning of the night shift, at 8.30 pm.

 Man opens door to death

 - Defaulters under scanner in moneylender murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A tap on the door, a spray of bullets and a stream of blood. 

 Khagen Chatterjee Road in Cossipore was jolted out of bed on Saturday night when two youths gunned down a 56-year-old man at his doorstep. 

 As Gouri Shankar Tiwari slumped to the ground, the assailants scampered away in the darkness, before anyone could identify them.

 The moneylender succumbed to injuries on the way to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 The cops reached the spot soon after, but are still to arrest anyone in connection with the murder.

 ?On Thursday, Tiwari had threatened two defaulters with dire consequences if they did not pay back his money. We are still not sure if there is a direct relation between the threat and the subsequent murder. It is possible that it was a revenge killing,? said Bimal Chaudhury, officer-in-charge of Cossipore police station.

 Tiwari had shifted to the city with his family 16 years ago. He moved from his native village in Chapra district of Bihar for the education of his children. Sons Manoj and Arjun are settled in Calcutta, while the youngest has moved back to Bihar with his wife.

 Thirty-year-old Arjun works in an engineering firm in Chitpur and lived with his father. His cousins also live in the house.

 According to neighbours, Tiwari wielded clout in the area because of his connections.

 ?Since it was almost 11.30, most of us in the neighbourhood were either in bed or preparing to turn in for the night. I could hear the television in Tiwaribabu?s house, so they must have been awake. Suddenly there was a loud sound, like a cracker going off. By the time we realised it was a gunshot, the murderers had fled,? said Munna Das, a neighbour.

 As soon as Arjun spotted his father lying in a pool of blood, he called out for his cousins and informed the police outpost in the area.

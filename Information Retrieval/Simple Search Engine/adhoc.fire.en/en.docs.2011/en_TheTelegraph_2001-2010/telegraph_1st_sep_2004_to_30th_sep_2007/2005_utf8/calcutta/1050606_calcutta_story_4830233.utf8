 - World Environment Day shows Bengal govt lagging in effective controls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 On World Environment Day, Metro takes a look at the pet pollution peeves and what the state government has done about them?

 EMISSION EVIL: ?It?s time to take serious steps to check the menace of auto emission,? thundered Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last year. The only serious (and very recent) step, however, has been the announcement of intent to ban commercial vehicles over 15 years of age. But the conversion-to-LPG deadline ? August-end for autos and December-end for buses, taxis, trucks and other commercial vehicles ? is expected to come and go just like earlier deadlines. We, meanwhile, continue to gasp ? recent government of India reports peg the incidence of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) at 24.8 per cent in the state, compared with the national average of 19.3 per cent.

 WETLAND WOES: ?Aar ek pao egote debo na? full stop,? has been the chief minister?s warning to promoters on wetlands. But the Ramsar East Calcutta Wetlands, off the EM Bypass, continues to be encroached upon, with no site management plan framed in three years. The enforcement buck continues to be passed between the fisheries and environment departments.

 TREE TRAUMA: This day, last year, Bhattacharjee came down heavily on the indiscriminate felling of trees in the city by private and government agencies. According to environmentalist Subhas Dutta, around 3,000 trees in Calcutta have been cut down to make way for flyovers, roads and other constructions. The Act preventing felling in non-forest areas is yet to be put in place, despite a Calcutta High Court directive to the state in 1998.

 PLASTIC PERIL: There are awareness programmes and pollution control board directives galore, but the Centre?s ban on plastic carry-bags of certain dimension and thickness is openly flouted in the city. The board?s blanket ban on plastic bags at heritage sites is not enforced either.

 WASTE WORRIES: According to the Central Act for Handling the Biomedical Waste, 1998, hospitals and nursing homes should treat biomedical waste (by themselves or through shared facilities) before handing it over to municipalities. Of the 88,000 beds in medical institutions across the state, waste treatment is done for hardly 32,000. The rest is dumped with other wastes by municipalities. The 1989 Act regarding management of hazardous waste (further amended in 2000) continues to be flouted; the government has failed to provide a single ?common hazardous disposal site?.

 SOUND STRAIN: Noise pollution control was one of the sole areas where the government had scored some points in the late 90s. But if Diwali 2004 was any sound byte to go, the police and district administration remain clueless about their responsibilities according to the Central Noise Act of 2000.

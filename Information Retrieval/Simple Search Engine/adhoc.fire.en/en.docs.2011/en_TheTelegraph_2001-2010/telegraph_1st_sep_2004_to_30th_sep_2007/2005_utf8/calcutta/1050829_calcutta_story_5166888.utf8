 Pilgrims, progress on water taxis

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Come September, and the Dakshineswar temple (above) and Belur Math can be reached by small speedboats. 

 A new mode of water transport will help people avoid crowded roads and launches and reach either Belur Math or Dakshineswar without hassles in a couple of minutes. 

 This mode of transport will be introduced next month, and the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC) will be in charge of operating it. 

 Armed with the approval of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, the corporation has entered into a joint venture with the Vivada Inland Waterways Ltd to introduce about 12 water taxis that will ply on the Hooghly. 

 ?Though we have 23 launches, which cater to about a lakh passengers daily, this mode of transport will be of immense help to those who prefer to visit places of interest in a group. A water taxi can comfortably carry eight to 10 passengers,? explained Asit Mondal, WBSTC managing director, on Friday.

 This is part of the corporation?s move to expand the scope of activities in the transport sector by joining hands with private entrepreneurs. 

 ?We have successfully launched air-conditioned buses on long-distance routes from Calcutta to Siliguri in collaboration with private companies. So, I am hopeful of being successful with the new project,? Mondal added.

 The corporation will not have to spend a single paisa to get the project going. ?Instead, we shall earn a substantial amount every month from the private party for allowing it to use the jetties. Besides, a considerable amount will be collected as licence fee from the same concern,? a corporation official said.

 R. Sushila, executive director of the private concern, said two water taxis will be in operation by the first week of September. ?We have decided to introduce the rest during the Pujas, keeping in mind the festive season. These are small petrol-driven mechanised 10-seater speedboats having the speed limit of nearly 12 nautical miles per hour,? she said.

 The specially-designed speedboats, known as a water taxi, will be called Hamsa. 

 ?Initially, it will start from Millennium Park and go up to Dakshineswar and Belur Math. Later, the services will be extended up to Nabadweep. On the southern side, we shall cover till Budge Budge, while on the northern side, we shall go up to Mayapur or even further,? she explained.

 Corporation officials said Rs 6 has been fixed as the minimum fare per passenger for travelling one nautical mile, which is equal to 1.85 km by road. ?The fare is moderate, and according to our survey, people can afford to pay the amount for a hassle-free journey,? said corporation managing director Mondal.

 In a related development, the company assigned to run water taxis is also refurbishing a huge launch to carry passengers from Calcutta to the Sunderbans from January. 

 ?There will be 34 cosy rooms on the renovated launch, in which Sunderbans-bound passengers can spend three nights comfortably on the river. This is also a joint venture project with us,? said a corporation official.

Behind the bar

The peak party days are just over and many among us 

are still trying to shake off the New Year?s Eve hangover. While you doused yourself 

in loads of wines and cocktails to welcome 2005, it?s time to give your system 

some rest and a thorough cleansing. 

But that doesn?t mean you quit sipping at parties 

in your resolve to avoid alcohol. Switch over to some harmless mocktails instead. 

If the usual creamy and sweet stuff repulse you, try your hand at making some 

tea mocktails for a change. Not only do these contain the health benefits of tea, 

they?re easy to make, too.

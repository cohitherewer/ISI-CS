Ganguly and Justice Maharaja Sinha, while hearing a petition relating to the monument?s beautification, asked the Memorial authorities to take all steps to make the bronze figure rotate from December 25.

 he bench also asked the authorities to undertake a special drive against plastic items on the Memorial grounds, especially during the festive week. The authorities were asked to put up boards displaying the prohibitory order on plastic. ?If necessary, the bags and containers of the visitors will be checked at the entry points,? the bench ruled.

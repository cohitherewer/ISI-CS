The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Celina bites tobacco bait

Screen On amp; Off

 Smoke screen: Celina Jaitley

 Even as celebrities take great pains to steer clear of tobacco and alcohol endorsements (even Amitabh Bachchan says, ?On principle, I don?t do tobacco or alcohol?), Celina Jaitley has just signed a Rs 2 crore deal with Baba Products, known for its tobacco items.

 Celina, of course, sees no wrong in endorsing the gutkhas and pan masalas and she is going to push the brand for the next three years. ?They were searching for some young and bubbly face and I think they found me perfect,? says the girl who shifted out of Wood Street, Calcutta, to make it in Mumbai.

 ?They have other plans that will be revealed soon. Initially I was very sceptical about endorsing tobacco, but got interested when I found out they were extending their brand.?

 After lying dormant for more than nine months, Metro cinema hall gets a fresh lease of life from Friday. The hall, inaugurated in December 1935, had earlier closed for renovation but just after a few months of reopening, it was shut down early this year by a staff strike.

 ?They have finally withdrawn all their demands,? reveals Arijit Dutta, who handles the programming of the Esplanade theatre. Metro, which started seven decades back with Bohemian Girl, will take fresh guard with Bluffmaster!.

 Talking about Bluffmaster!, you may like to sneak a peek into the Rohan Sippy movie on the STAR Gold special, Bluffmaster Kaun?.

 The main three cast members ? Abhishek, Priyanka and Riteish ? will talk about the movie and their experiences, on and off the sets. But hang on; like the movie which is full of twists and turns, there?s a googly on this show as well. Every word spoken by Abhishek and Ritesh is a bluff! Tune into STAR Gold on Friday, at 8 pm.

 Call it girl power or just co-incidence, but five of the top 28 in Indian Idol 2 are all from Bengal. And all of them are girls! Before rejoining their campaign in Mumbai, four of them came down to Calcutta on Thursday ? Jolly Das, Antara Mitra, Saberri Bhattacharya and Sandipa Datta.

 ?The reason we have fared so well in the contest is because we Bengalis are trained singers, unlike the rest of the country,? felt Antara, who comes from Maslandapur near the India-Bangladesh border.

 The fifth girl, Monali Thakur, daughter of singer-actor Shakti Thakur, was busy preparing in Mumbai. You can vote for the Bengali girl gang on January 2, 8.30 pm on Sony.

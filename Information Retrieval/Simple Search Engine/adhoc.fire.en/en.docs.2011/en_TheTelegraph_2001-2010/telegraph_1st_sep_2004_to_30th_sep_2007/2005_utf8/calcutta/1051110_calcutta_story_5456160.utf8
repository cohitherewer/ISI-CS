 On Sunday evening, the Taj Bengal terrace witnessed a students fashion show with a rather professional touch. And not just for the commendable quality of the ensembles showcased on the ramp. 

 Unlike most fashion shows in the city, the annual graduating show of Wigan amp; Leigh College started bang on time and ended in 30 minutes flat, without dragging on for a couple of hours as most student shows do.

 Titled Weaves 2005, the brief show displayed collections by the final-batch students of the college in 13 sequences.

 The inspirations and themes varied from the realms of the desert to the skin of snakes and the beauty of macaws. 

 Madhuchhanda Das walked away with the maximum number of awards, including the principals prize, for her collection called Ephemeral. The most practical collection award went to Ajanta for her well-co-ordinated line of knitted mens wear called 7/1 Down Memory Lane.

 The jury, however, chose Ruth Robinson for her collection inspired by orchids, which was marked by lots of textures and candy colours. 

 The models displaying the designs were Shonal Rawat, Deepti Gujral, Candice Pinto, Jenny, Ishika, Tanusree, Tina, Jessica, Pooja and Neeraj.

 French fare

 A select gathering of women at the Calcutta Club lapped up recipes and cooking tips sprinkled generously by Yvonnick Jegat Daniau, executive chef of The Park, on Tuesday afternoon. 

 The interactive session showcased authentic delicacies from Brittany in France.

 The items demonstrated by Yvonnick included Cotiarde D Armore (a soup originally prepared by the fishermen of the region), Ratatouille Brettone (eggplant, tomato, cauliflower, sweet pepper, onion and zucchini cooked in olive oil, garlic, bay leaves and thyme), Feuillete De Pomefret Ile Aux Moines (pomfret in cooked puff pastry) and Crepes, a popular dessert of the region. 

 The dishes are all specialities from my homeland Brittany. I have adhered to the authenticity and taste of the dishes as closely as possible, given the availability of ingredients in Calcutta, smiles Yvonnick, who has travelled extensively in England, France, Egypt and Jamaica.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bail veto for cell thieves

 - Hi-tech gadget enabled cops to smash father-son racket

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail pleas by Amal Kanti Sikdar and his son, Tarun Kanti Sikdar, who were apprehending arrest for their alleged involvement in a cell phone-smuggling racket.

 The chief metropolitan magistrate of Calcutta has issued arrest warrants against the two. Both are absconding.

 During the hearing of the bail petition, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah told the division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice S.K. Gupta that the detective department of the city police is looking for the father-son team for running a smuggling racket in electronic goods. The duo lives in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city. 

 The cops had recently busted the racket, which dealt mostly in cell phones, with the help of a hi-tech machine. After a series of thefts, the detective department had imported the device to catch the perpetrators.

 Called Anti-Theft Mobile Provider System, the machine helped the investigators track the stolen cell phones.

 ?In February this year, 41 cell phones were stolen from a showroom at Government Place. The robbers broke open the gate of the shop and decamped with the phones at night. The owner of the showroom lodged a complaint with Hare Street police station,? stated the public prosecutor. 

 The Lalbazar detective department took up the case. Using the machine, the policemen zeroed in on Dwipanwita Sikdar, a resident of Mahestala who was using one of the stolen phones.

 She was detained and interrogated, after which the cops started suspecting that her husband and father-in-law were the masterminds of most of the recent cell phone thefts in the city.

 ?The woman, while in police custody, stated before a magistrate of the Alipore court that her husband and father-in-law, with the assistance of a few others, were running a cell phone-smuggling racket. She mentioned that Pankaj Jaiswal and Gangasagar Shaw, residents of a village in Champak district of Bihar, were also involved in the racket,? the public prosecutor said.

 A police team from Calcutta went to Champak in search of Pankaj and Gangasagar. ?Both were in Champak jail. The city police, armed with a court order, brought them to Calcutta. During questioning, the two admitted that Amal Sikdar and his son used to supply them cell phones,? Safiullah added.

 Police sources said a hunt was also on for the other members of the racket.

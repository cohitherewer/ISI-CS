 Utility bloom on mayor largesse

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Has the funds-starved state government found a helpmate in Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which has just turned solvent after decades?

 According to mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the civic board has so far granted over Rs 20 crore for various public utility projects of the government, at the request of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 Among the projects being funded by the civic board are renovation of the century-old Minerva theatre, augmentation of the Garden Reach waterworks and laying pipelines at the Garfa pumping station.

 The civic board also wants to take credit for granting the allotments without getting any subsidy (except the statutory DA subvention grant of Rs 3 crore) from the government.

 The mayor even alleged that the government, beneficiary of his largesse, had failed to share revenue with the civic body (as suggested by the state finance commission) for three years. The amount it owes to the civic body is Rs 60 crore.

 Municipal affairs minister Bhattacharya, however, denied the claim and instead, alleged that it was the civic body that owed the government Rs 400 crore, the amount charged for receiving filtered water from Garden Reach.

 The civic board, he added, had also not paid the government its share of development charges collected while sanctioning construction proposals of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. 

 As for the promise of Rs 1 crore for the Minerva project, Bhattacharya pointed out: ?We are yet to receive the funds.? 

 The minister?s accusation notwithstanding, the civic body, under the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine, has been successful in shedding its tag of ?a deficit institution?. 

 Mayor Mukherjee is credited to be the only mayor, since the inception of the civic body, during whose tenure the board has earned more than what it pays to its employees. As of now, the board has a reserve of Rs 700 crore. 

 During almost the same period, the state government?s internal debt has risen from Rs 3,480 crore to over Rs 20,645 crore (four times its revenue earning). 

 The civic body?s current annual expenditure on account of employees? remuneration is Rs 205 crore, against its revenue collection of Rs 250 crore. In 1999-2000, when Mukherjee became mayor, the annual tax revenue collection was around Rs 170 crore, said municipal commissioner Debashis Som.

 The government, on the other hand, spends Rs 950 crore every month towards the salaries of a million employees.

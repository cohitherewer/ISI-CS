The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Theatre mania, measure for measure

 All the world?s a stage for nine days in November as the Prithvi theatre festival rolls out in Mumbai. This time, the spotlight will be shared by the Bard and bold experiments

 Her mother had started it in 1983; she has sustained it for the next 22 years. And despite so many years of experience, Sanjna Kapoor is nervous every November when the curtains go up on the Prithvi theatre festival.

 ?We began preparations for this year?s festival a year-and-a-half ago and we started work in the public arena three months ago,? says Sanjna over phone from Mumbai. That?s just how meticulous Shashi and Jennifer Kapoor?s daughter can be.

 Starting November 3, the high point of the nine-day festival ? spread over Prithvi and Jamshed Bhabha theatres ? will be London-based troupe Complicite?s Measure for Measure and the experimental Theatremania.

 ?These are the two focus areas. In fact, one led to the other. First is Shakespeare and we are bringing down Complicite after trying for seven years. This is a fantastic troupe that has survived 21 years. Its artistic director Simon McBurney and his team have broken new grounds. They have developed a new language of theatre,? says Sanjna excitedly, steering the gala. ?That apart, Complicite is staging Measure for Measure, which is very daunting for us. It?s a very difficult play and Complicite has given it a modern interpretation; they have explored its political, social and philosophical notions that pertain to today. It?s a hugely technical production but their technology does not overwhelm you. The simplicity is superb.?

The original production of Measure for Measure, 

as designed for the premiere at National Theatre London, will be staged at the 

1000-plus-seater Jamshed Bhabha theatre. Prithvi theatre will see a technically 

stripped down version.

 As a warm-up to the Complicite performances, Sanjna 

and her team organised a series of events surrounding Shakespeare over the past 

three months, which included small performances, film screenings and a touring 

exhibition on the Bard. 

 ?We just wanted to make people pick up Shakespeare before they saw Complicite, may be a scene or a play they might want to read. We also had 20 young actors workshopping on Shakespeare for three months. The pre-festival activities have been very successful. They brought people together around Shakespeare,? says Sanjna. ?Right now, some 30 volunteers of Prithvi are on a parade on the streets of Mumbai, with music and masks. I think it?s very important for theatre to reach out.?

 Apart from the Bard, the festival has invited local groups under one umbrella to create ?something risque and experimental, something that brings about newness?. Called Theatremania, the five-day spread will have daily performances of two to 60-minute duration on the works of Samuel Beckett to August Strindberg and Anton Chekov.

A daylong section of Theatremania is dedicated to 

playwright Vijay Tendulkar, inspired by Amol Palekar?s Ten Festival in Pune. ?These 

are productions made out of Tendulkar?s early works, journalistic writings and 

essays,? explains Sanjna. Theatremania gets more experimental with Rage?s 36 

Ghante, where 12 playwrights from Hindi, Marathi, English and Gujarati theatre 

will write 10-minute plays on a common theme in 10 hours and then give shape to 

the productions in 24 hours. 

 But apart from these yearly festivals, is experimental 

theatre really happening in Mumbai? ?Not consistently,? feels Sanjna. ?The Mumbai 

productions that travel to Calcutta I think are the commercially successful ones. 

By experimental theatre, I mean people exploring the medium and trying to evolve 

a new language. It?s a very sensual medium; something you can see, hear, smell 

and sense and work at different spaces. That kind of work, I guess, is not happening 

in Mumbai. Not even at Prithvi. There are flashes of wonder but they are sporadic. 

Not the kind of sustained work Satyadev Dubey, for instance, had done in the Seventies 

and Eighties,? says she. 

 As for herself, Sanjna prefers to remain backstage and observe. ?I love being on stage but I can?t do both at the same time. Acting, when it happens, has to be a full time activity for me,? she laughs.

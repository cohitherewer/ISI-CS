 Patient turns violent, leaps to death

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ten days after a bypass surgery, Mohammed Yahya Hussain jumped to death from the second floor of Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences on Wednesday night, after battling security guards and smashing a window pane.

 Hussain, 55, an employee of Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, was admitted to the hospital late in May with a chronic heart problem. 

 On Wednesday, he was in a cheerful mood. ?He had dinner and said he would take a walk before turning in for the night,? said a nurse who attended him at the second-floor male ward.

 Around 10.40 pm, Hussain started pacing up and down the ward. Soon, he started running. Two security guards chased him. When they caught up, Hussain started hitting them. ?He then smashed a window pane with his hand and jumped out,? a hospital spokesman said.

 Hussain was rushed to the trauma centre of the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A police case has been registered. ?We did not realise that Hussain was suffering from a psychiatric problem. The family did not inform us,? the spokesman added.

 On May 28, cardiac surgeon Mrinalendu Das had operated on Hussain, who was due to be released soon. 

 ?The nurses had noticed the patient?s erratic behaviour soon after the surgery, but thought it was the side-effect of the drugs he was taking,? the spokesman signed off.

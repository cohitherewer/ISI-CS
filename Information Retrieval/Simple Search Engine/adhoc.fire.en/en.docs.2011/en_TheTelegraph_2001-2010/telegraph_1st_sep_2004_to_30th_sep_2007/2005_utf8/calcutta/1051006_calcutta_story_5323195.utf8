The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mahatma survives sleaze wave 

 - Film on Gandhian values wards off competition from skin-flick trio

 The Father versus the way of all flesh. An unexpected box-office battle is playing out just fine ? at a theatre near you.

 Last Friday?s new release, Jahnu Barua?s Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara, has fought off concerted opposition from a slew of sleaze films in Rain, Sauda and Kasak. But the Mahatma has managed to tame the tease trinity.

 While Barua?s first Hindi-language film has garnered an average of 55 per cent occupancy in the city multiplexes, the flesh factory has been reduced to occupancy percentages as low as 15 to 25.

 ?It?s a no-contest,? says Prashant Srivastava of 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi). ?Although the period is bad for films, Maine? has been able to draw in crowds because of strong word-of-mouth publicity, just like Iqbal had done some weeks back. Stronger marketing would have made more people aware of the film.?

 Maine..., starring Anupam Kher and Urmila Matondkar, is not about the assassination of the Father of the Nation but explores how Indians kill the Gandhian values every day.

 The three other releases, on the other hand, are a flesh feast from the word go. Rain is a no-holds-barred Meghna Naidu enterprise (though she told Metro, this was her serious attempt to act). Sauda is another rehash of Indecent Proposal with Preeti Jhangiani and Suman Ranganathan the repeated victims of wardrobe malfunction. And Kasak has Pakistani actress Meera starting off from where she was stopped in her Bollywood debut Nazar.

 Barua, who caught the Tuesday night show at 89 Cinemas, told Metro: ?There is a notion that you need to titillate the audiences to make a film run. But you also have to use the language of cinema all right. There were some popcorn audiences in the particular show I was watching in Calcutta. They were initially very restless but soon went silent after they got hooked to the film.?

 But not many have been hooked to the rest, although multiplexes have accommodated at least two shows a day in the first week. Adds Srivastava: ?The target audience is very different. The little audience we have had for these sleaze films have been mostly young males, whereas families have queued up to watch a sensitive film like Maine Gandhi??

 Then why slot films like Rain and Sauda at plush plexes billed as entertainment hubs for families? Trade analyst Taran Adarsh explains from Mumbai: ?If you don?t run these films, you have to have 36 shows of Maine Gandhi? running every day. Now, that?s not possible. Also, since this is one of the worst phases of the year in terms of movie-watching, the B-grade films get maximum screens and are all released together.?

 And this big-screen burst of lust is short-lived. Says Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum): ?There is a demand for movies like these from a certain section. And being a multiplex, we try to give our patrons some variety. But the content of these films are so poor that we soon have to take them off.?

 So, while Gandhi marches into Week 2, the Meghnas and Meeras will take a tumble off the screens this Friday.

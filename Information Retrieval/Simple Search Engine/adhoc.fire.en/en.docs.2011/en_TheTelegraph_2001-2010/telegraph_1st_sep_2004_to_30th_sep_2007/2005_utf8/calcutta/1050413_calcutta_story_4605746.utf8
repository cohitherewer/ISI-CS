 Textured abstractions

 Specialising in the research of social and religious customs, specially among the Jain sects, Manish Pushkale displays the rare finesse of translating his experiences into spiritually profound, abstract works of art. Inspired by Indias renowned abstract artist, Syed Haider Raza, his paintings are in the minimalist mode, celebrating vacuity and absence. Painted in oil on canvas, Sanyastha, the ongoing exhibition of his recent paintings, portrays his pre-occupation with textures that unravel with a poetic touch the magnificent elements of colour, either soft and tender, or strong and passionately rivetting. The works on show suggest an artistic maturity and insight that find the artist in harmony with his inner self; instinctive and spontaneous in expression, at the same time preserving a delicate balance in his use of visual metaphors. The ?melodically repetitive? mesh-like permeations in his works, with their simulation of rags and pieces of textured fabric, embody an encoding of sorts, inviting the viewer to enter the artist?s private, metaphysical domain.

 When: Till April 30 (except Sundays), 3 pm - 7 pm

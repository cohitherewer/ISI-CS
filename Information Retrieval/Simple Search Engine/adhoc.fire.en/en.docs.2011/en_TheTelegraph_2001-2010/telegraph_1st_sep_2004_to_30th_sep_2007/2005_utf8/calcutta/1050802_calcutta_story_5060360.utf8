The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without...

 Catching the new-look Big B in KBC 

 Its time to dream double as Kaun Banega Crorepati finally returns to the small screen with a more cool and hep Amitabh Bachchan as quizmaster. While the prize money soars up to Rs 2 crore, theres an extra lifeline to resort to if you get cold feet in the hot seat. Dont forget to catch three Calcuttans as they sit for the Fastest Finger First round. So, Friday, 9 pm, STAR Plus, be sure and confident before you lock those answers.

 Watching out for the big wedding

 Will it or wont it? The wedding of the year, or so the unlimited tele-promotions scream, is slated to take up screen space at 9.30 on Friday night. The bride and groom (as per the card, but you never know with these soaps!) are of course ugly duckling-turned-supermodel Jassi and her Cassanova-turned-lovestruck groom Armaan sir. However, with Purab breathing his last and Jassi being beckoned to the hills up north just before D-day, who knows what twist awaits the tale in Sony TVs Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin. Especially when a snooty sister-in-law and disgruntled ex-girlfriend are waiting for an opportunity to ensure the wedding is called off. So, make sure to stay tuned all week to see if the big wedding will or wont happen.

 Cheering new talents in Team India

 If mega-serials are not your cup of tea, theres still enough reason to be remain glued to the small screen. With the ongoing Indian Oil Cup Tri-series, sports freaks can watch out for the new talents in Team India. If the telecast tussle between Ten Sports and Doordarshan was any indication, the stage was set for lots of action on the pitch at Dambulla. For India, of course, the series was a test-bed for the new captain and coach duo. Two matches later, a tame defeat against Sri Lanka and a decent win against West Indies hasnt quite been able to convince the pundits about the mettle of the new bunch. Perhaps Dravid and co. will find their rhythm in the next two matches, on Wednesday and Sunday, to secure a berth in the floodlit finals on August 9.

 Heading for the latest lounge bar

 The city is all set to get yet another lounge bar, this one in the heart of Park Street. Called Roxy, the new night-spot will be an addition to The Parks list of happening haunts. Scheduled to open on August 5, the plush bar on the ground floor of the hotel promises to be the perfect place to unwind after a hard days work. So, give your favourite hangouts a miss this weekend and head for the new destination, for Roxys the place to be seen. 

 Sporting the wet hair look

 Next time youre caught in a shower while heading for a party, use the excuse to sport a wet-hair look. An eternal fashion favourite, the wet look rarely goes out of style and theres no better time to flaunt it than the monsoons. Not only does it look cool and sexy, its probably the easiest hairdo to put together. Just give your hair a wash before you step out of the house and run your fingers through it without allowing it to dry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boys on the block

Of the two bands, one split up 34 years ago and only 

two of its four members are alive. The other disbanded in the late 60s and the 

mates have hardly been in touch with each other since. Yet, the Beatles and the 

Beach Boys had such a profound impact on the music and the cultural scene of their 

times that three decades on, productions inspired by their work are set to debut 

on stage.

 The Beach Boys, America?s answer to the Beatles, would be up first, with the musical Good Vibrations (named after one of their most famous songs) opening on New York?s Broadway in end-January.

 Previews at the Eugene O?Neil Theatre in New York in December have drawn a good response from viewers and critics.

 The show does not tell the group?s story but uses 30 of its songs to follow ?the romantic misadventures of a group of small-town teenagers from the East Coast on a life-changing odyssey to the Promised Land ? the beaches of Southern California?. Directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, it is based on a book by Richard Dresser.

The Beatles feature in something more spectacular 

? the dazzling Cirque du Soleil (picture on top). 

 Born in 1984, Cirque du Soleil is a travelling theatrical show that mixes the arts of the circus and the street, and features original music, light effects and costumes. Since inception, it has thrilled 40 million spectators in more than 130 cities in four continents. The production would be Cirque?s fifth resident show in Las Vegas? The Mirage, a resort opened in 1989.

 The Beatles project was born out of a personal friendship between Beatle George Harrison and Cirque founder Guy Lalibert?. The organisers plan to ?bring the magic of Cirque du Soleil together with the spirit and passion behind the most beloved rock band of all time to create a single, simple statement of delight?.

Though content details are in ?creative incubation?, 

the show aims to revisit the excitement of Beatlemania at its height. But it will 

be some time till the stage comes alive, since the production is set to debut 

only in 2006.

 Besides being creative contemporaries on two sides of the Atlantic in the 60s, the Beach Boys and the Beatles share much more. Brian Wilson (the driving force behind the Beach Boys) and Paul McCartney have retained a great friendship and mutual admiration over the years. McCartney has described Wilson?s God only knows as ?the greatest song of all time? besides performing with him on stage and collaborating on his album.

 Also, it was the Beatles? 1965 classic album Rubber Soul that prompted Wilson to come up with the groundbreaking Pet Sounds. The McCartney-conceived Beatles? reply was Sgt. Pepper?s Lonely Hearts Club Band, considered the finest album of the 20th century. Trying to outdo Sgt. Peppers, the 24-year-old Wilson started work on Smile, but unable to take the pressure, suffered a nervous breakdown and shelved the project, completing it only in 2003, at the age of 62.

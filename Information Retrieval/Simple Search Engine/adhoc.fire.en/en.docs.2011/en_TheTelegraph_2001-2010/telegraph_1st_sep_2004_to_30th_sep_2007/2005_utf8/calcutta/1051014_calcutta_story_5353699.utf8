 Reach out, rise up

 As a teenager, he was more brilliant than his brilliant gang of friends. So when he qualified for IIT Kharagpur, with a higher rank than any of them, no one was surprised, except his simple schoolteacher father. Murthy Sr. wasn?t surprised that his son had topped in academics yet again; he was shocked when Narayana, one of eight siblings, innocently told his Appa that he would like to study at IIT. ?Are you crazy! How can I to afford it?? was Appa?s reply.

 The story goes that N.R. Narayana Murthy even went to the station to see his friends off, as they boarded the train he deserved, but wasn?t destined, to be on. Fighting to hold back the tears, he waved goodbye to his friends and his long cherished dream; but as he walked off the platform he dared to dream a bigger dream, a far greater dream, one that would touch the lives of millions.

 Today, that dream, Infosys, is worth thousands of crores ? enough to build several IITs, the train, the engine and even the platform where his teenage dream lay shattered all those years ago.

 Now, if a dreamer of his stature publicly admits that he has never seen ?such heroism, such confidence, such compassion, such determination and so many who dare to dream?, there is, in little dreamers like us, a great sense of fulfilment and quiet satisfaction that runs deep, very deep.

 That is exactly how Biswanath, Partha, Denise and all my other friends at Heritage feel each year at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence. With it, each of us at The Telegraph Education Foundation (TTEF) feel humbled, small and inadequate. Humbled and small, because giants from the tiny to the little, from the weak to the frail, stride across the Science City stage, each like a colossus, towering over us; inadequate, because there is so much more to be done!

 Every year, our team puts out its silent radar in search of these giants ? some tucked away in remote villages and districts, some right here with us every day of our lives ? only we can?t see them!

 Every year, we wonder where next year?s giants will come from and how many more are locked up in cupboards of courage with determination of steel. Every year they come with their teachers, their parents, their inner strength; some come only with their teachers and inner strength ? while their parents look on from up above.

 Amandeep, Sukhjit and Sukhjot were three of our giants this year. In 1998, they lost their papa; in 2004, their mama! Orphaned and still a tender seven, 10 and 11, they have chosen not just to look life in the eye, but to stare it down.

 Priyanka Saha was another giant, standing tall. The 14-year-old may be a trifle past the age of playing ?doctor-doctor?, but cruelly young to fit into the real thing in the game of life. Caring for her parents ? both fighting cerebral strokes ? and responsible for her home, sister, studies and the small matters of the family income, she brushes aside the balls of fire that life throws at her with a breath of calmness that is so refreshing.

 Then, there were the Mondals, our giants from Kashidanga, South 24-Parganas. They live in a country in which you spend more when a boy is born into the family, simply because you will spend less when the shehnai is playing; a country in which non-boys are invariably burdens ? the less the better.

 So when Subhankar and his brother came as God?s priceless gifts to illiterate Diwakar Mondal and his wife, 16 and 14 years ago, there should have been great celebrations in the poor pheriwalla?s home. Instead there was a pall of double gloom. Both boys couldn?t move an inch without help. So what, if they couldn?t! They had giants to help them; giants who carried them to school, three kilometres each way; giants in the guise of parents!

 Logically, children of giant parents will be giants themselves! Subhankar is, and has taken giant strides in the journey of life, without physically moving an inch on his own. He has conquered the Madhyamik examination with 65.9 per cent and is working hard to walk tall in his next battle, HS 2007.

 You will agree that compared to these giants who bestride the narrow world like a colossus, we are petty men who lead ordinary lives. However, the point I?d like to make here is, that we are masters of our own fates. The fault, dear friends, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings. We too can be giants like them; we too can stride the world like a colossus!

 How, you may well ask! Here?s how! 

 Within hours and days of the School Awards, this year, prospective giants have called us. Vandana Paul, the principal of La Maternelle (which appropriately means ?the mother? in French), the school that has taken the responsibility of the three little Singh giants, called us the day after the awards, to tell us that her schoolchildren would be sacrificing a part of their pocket money to initiate a scholarship for future giants identified by TTEF.

 We have already put Usha Mehta, Priyanka?s principal, in touch with physiotherapists Subrata and Mohua Paul, who have volunteered to take total charge of Priyanka?s parents? medical treatment. We have already put Ranadhir Biswas, a 27-year-old caring Calcuttan, who phoned us out of nowhere, saying that he would like to contribute towards Priyanka?s monthly expenses. 

 Praveen Chand Dhandhania is already in touch with us, wanting to know how the Madanlal Dhandhania Charitable Trust, set up in memory of his grandfather, could join the movement in search of giants.

 Every year, at the School Awards, many watch in awe and admiration; many tell us how moved they were. This year one glassy-eyed friend urged us to distribute tissue paper at the ceremony next year. 

 While thanking them for their support and encouragement, and at the risk of being misunderstood, I would like to get something off my chest ? something I have been wanting to say all these years: let?s not wipe away our concern as we wipe away the tears every year at Science City. 

 Let each year?s awards ceremony end with a promise to stand beside one of these giants and become unselfish giants in our own way. Let us welcome them into our garden of comfort, good health and education. Like Basudeb Bhattacharya, the principal of Hariyana Vidya Mandir and his incredible teachers have, by donating Rs 66,000 from their salaries, for the third consecutive year. For us, it?s a giant leap ? khamata to welcome many more giants who come for assistance to our Jamir Lane office.

 Yes, friends, the time has come to act; to reach out and touch the lives of these giants; and become giants in our own small way. Subhankar and his brother are too heavy now to be carried to and from school; the tricycle that the local MLA had given them has broken down. They need a new one! Many, many other giants? tales lie buried in our files, collecting dust and losing hope. The time to act is now!

 Write to us right away at TTEF, 7/2Y, Jamir Lane, Calcutta-19 or hrplvsnl.net, if you feel inclined to becoming an unselfish giant. Do it now and I promise you, you won?t need that many tissues at Science City next year. Take care!

 Chit Chat

 When the lights went out in the midst of a programme at Nazrul Mancha last month, cell phones came in handy for youngsters out to enjoy the Fossils performance. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

Living you

 Who are you...

 Who are you? Like a shadow, 

 floating in my multi-hued dreamy sky.

 Who are you? Like a mirage,

 I can?t see you, yet I hear you cry.

 Oh my unseen and unknown reflection,

 I search in the mirror for you.

 Emotions are holding me back,

 yet I try to become what I want to.

 Who are you? Filling up my voids,

 melting freezing mind,

 painting my canvas of oblivion,

 with a reason to look behind.

 I long to touch your healing hand,

 guiding me what to do.

 People say ?you? are an illusive dream,

 but tell me... Who are you?

 Archan Bhattacharya,

 Class XII, Don Bosco Park Circus

 A bit of the sky

 All the passing years, fan the fire

 Burning in my heart is a raging desire

 Each breath I take

 Burns me deep each day,

 Each night awake or asleep of glory or fame

 I have my share, a bit of the sky,

 Bright and fair

 To walk the path walked by none

 To shine like a candle hot like sun,

 To have a voice of my own,

 A place in the world

 If not a throne.

 Chandra Ghosh,

 1st year, English (hons), Rabindra Bharati University

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Rewind with Ronan

The ex-Boyzone singer tells Pratim D. 

Gupta that attitude is the key 

For you will still be here tomorrow/ But your dreams 

may not?

Just like the words of the Cat Stevens classic Father 

and son, which is the highlight of Ronan Keating?s new album, the ex-Boyzone 

frontman is living his dreams to the fullest. The melody man spoke to Goodlife 

about yesterday, today and tomorrow.

Your latest release is called 10 Years of Hits. 

How have you evolved as a singer in these 10 years?

When I started out at the age of 16, I was a child. 

I was brand new to the business. I had no idea where I was going. No one knows 

where he is getting to at that stage. I was eager, hungry and passionate. In these 

10 years I have grown up and matured. I feel I have become a better singer and 

a better songwriter.

 Don?t you think it was too early for a ?greatest 

hits? album?

It?s not a ?greatest hits? album as such. It just 

features the hits of my first 10 years in music. I just hope I can come out with 

a similar album after another 10 years and yet another one after the next 10.

 You have sung the famous Cat Stevens number Father 

and son with him. How did it happen and what was it like?

It was an incredible experience. He is a genius, a 

legend. He has always been a big hero of mine. He came out after 27 years to sing 

this song with me. I had sung the same song when I had auditioned for Boyzone 

11 years back. We had become friends, too, and had stayed in touch all these years. 

When I was planning this album, I told him that this was the most important song 

of the collection. He said he?ll do it. 

You have sung solo versions of the Boyzone hits 

Words and Baby Can I Hold You. How different was the recording experience?

Kind of bizarre. It?s not that I wasn?t used to being 

alone in the studio. But it was different. Singing the songs with Boyzone was 

another feeling altogether. 

 Looking back, would you have preferred a solo 

musical career right from the start?

No. I had a great time in Boyzone. I have never taken 

the band for granted. I am here today just for them. Boyzone couldn?t last forever 

and had a short life span.

 How difficult was it to come out of a successful 

boyband and establish yourself as a solo artiste?

It wasn?t difficult for me. Once I started writing 

the songs and recording them, I knew I was on. People make mistakes by trying 

to be different people. I just tried to be me, the same person from Boyzone. I 

sang the records people wanted to listen to. 

 How do you approach your solo albums as opposed 

to the way you worked with Boyzone?

I just sit back and write my songs and then record 

them in the studios. I try to choose the right songs. It?s a long process but 

I feel relaxed.

 We have a lot of boybands here in Calcutta. What 

is the right recipe for a successful boyband?

Boybands need to co-ordinate within the groups, sing 

the right songs, have the right look and, most importantly, have the right attitude. 

There are a lot of factors that need to come together. We were at the right place 

at the right time. These days, the scenario has changed a lot but I believe the 

concept of boybands can still work.

 What are your memories of the India tour?

Oh! I remember the India tour so well. In Mumbai, 

the streets were all lined up with people. It was an incredible experience in 

Bangalore, too. I would love to come back to India in the next couple of months. 

I am doing a fundraising show for the tsunami survivors on the Phuket beaches 

at the end of this month. Maybe we can plan an India tour after that. 

 What is your take on Indian music?

I haven?t heard much. But I am making a new record 

and if I do come to India, I am sure I?ll be influenced by the colours, flavours 

and people and use them in my album.

 Who have been your greatest musical influences? 

I think everybody that I have loved listening to. 

Bryan Adams, Sting, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Cat Stevens, everybody.

 You got married at 21. Has your wife been an inspiration?

She?s been my rock. I wouldn?t be here without her. 

She?s guided me through every up and down.

 What plans for 2005?

I am doing a couple of Europe shows. Last year was 

really hectic with a whole lot of shows. This year I want to take it slow.

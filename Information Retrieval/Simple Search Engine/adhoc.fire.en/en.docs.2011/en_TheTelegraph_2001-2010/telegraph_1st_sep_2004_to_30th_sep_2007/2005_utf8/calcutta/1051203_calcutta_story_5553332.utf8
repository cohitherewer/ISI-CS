The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road law tightened 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Faced with a spate of fatal road accidents across the city, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government will tighten traffic norms and crack down on offenders. Starting Monday, traffic police will take action against jaywalkers and those violating traffic rules. Spot fines will be imposed on jaywalkers. 

 This was decided at a meeting chaired by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Friday afternoon. The transport department finalised the details of the Rs 2.5-crore traffic infrastructure system, entailing installation of an automatic signalling system, zebra crossings, bus bays and guard rails along pavements, at Esplanade and the central business district to begin with.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee has submitted a report to the state government on the commission system of payment for bus drivers and conductors. Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said Mukherjee held the commission system responsible for rash driving.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rain revives clean-canal chorus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It takes Calcutta to go under water ? which happens at least once a year ? to remind the mandarins of the clogged outflow channels. 

 Promises fly thick and fast after each round of waterlogging, that the channels will be cleared and brought to shape and the next spell of prolonged showers will not leave the city inundated.

 This time was no exception. The state government, Calcutta Metropolitan Water Sanitation Authority (CMWSA) and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) reviewed on Tuesday the havoc wreaked by six days of incessant rains and came up with a set of missions.

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and finance minister Asim Dasgupta vowed to expedite the re-excavation of Tolly?s Nullah and to start the long-proposed renovation of around a dozen other canals, funds for which are available from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Hudco.

 More than three years ago, Hudco had agreed to grant Rs 150 crore and the ADB had sanctioned Rs 16 crore for the revamp of the outflow channels. The ministers are still in the dark about its progress.

 An official, however, pointed out that the CMDA had spent Rs 80 lakh and excavated part of the Bagjola canal under the Hudco scheme, which started in April 2002. But work could not proceed because of encroachments on the banks.

 ?The revamp project could not be taken up despite availability of funds, as the authorities were reluctant to evict more than 5,000 families from the banks of the canals,? said a CMDA official. 

 On Tuesday, while minister Bhattacharya stressed that re-excavation of Tolly?s Nullah, from the Hooghly to the Vidyadhari, will start in November, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya announced he would take up the long-delayed revamp of the drainage channels with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his ministerial colleagues.

 The civic authorities feel the chief minister?s intervention is necessary, as several government departments and agencies ? like the irrigation and fisheries departments and the CMC, CMDA and the CMWSA ? need to be involved in the project.

 ?Four years have passed since the finalisation of the schemes, but progress is almost nil because of lack of monitoring. There?s no excuse for the lapse,? the mayor said.

 ?Draining out accumulated rainwater depends largely on the capacity of about a dozen channels, like Lower Bagjola, Upper Bagjola, Suburban Headcut canal and TP channel. But because of heavy siltation, the canals pour out even after a minimal flow,? pointed out municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

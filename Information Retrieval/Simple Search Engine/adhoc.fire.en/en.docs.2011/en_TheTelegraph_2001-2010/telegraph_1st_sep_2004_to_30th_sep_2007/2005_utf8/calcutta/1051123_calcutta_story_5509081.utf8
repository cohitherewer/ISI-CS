 Hub crosses legal hurdle

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta International Convention Centre at New Town, Rajarhat, crossed a hurdle on Tuesday when a single bench of Calcutta High Court dismissed a writ petition challenging the award of its Rs 2,500-crore contract to Bengal Unitech Universal Estate.

 Laxmi Realtors Limited (LRL) had filed the petition against Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco). 

 The company claimed to be the highest bidder and alleged that there was a nexus between the consortium and Hidco.

 ?The petitioner has failed to prove the alleged nexus between Hidco and the Unitech-Universal combine and thus, the court is dismissing the writ petition,? stated Justice Jayanta Biswas in his order.

 The judge also held that the government had done nothing wrong by taking into consideration the technical expertise of a company while awarding the contract.

 Advocate Anindya Mitra and Arunava Ghosh, representing LRL, had told the court that Hidco had violated the norms. 

 ?When Hidco floated tenders for the project, to come up on a 100-acre plot in Rajarhat, the petitioner company had submitted the highest bid of Rs 433.56 crore, while the Unitech-Universal combine?s bid was only Rs 185.29 crore,? they said.

 According to the advocates, Hidco announced that technical expertise would be a factor only after the submission of the bids.

 The government lawyers, including mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, successfully defended the bid process.

 Appearing for Hidco, state advocate-general Balai Ray told the court: ? A four-member committee was formed to consider technical expertise of the applicant companies.?

 The contract was awarded to the consortium after it agreed to raise its bid, he added.

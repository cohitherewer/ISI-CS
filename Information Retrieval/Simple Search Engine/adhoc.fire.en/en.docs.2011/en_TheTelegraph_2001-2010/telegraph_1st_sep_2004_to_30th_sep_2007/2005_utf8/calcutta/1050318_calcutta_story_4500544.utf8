The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kala-azar in comeback symptom

 - Drug-resistant strain alerts experts

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 UN Brahmachari invented a drug in 1921 to save the people from kala-azar, or visceral leishmaniasis. 

 More than 84 years later, as the disease threatens to make a comeback through a drug-resistant variety, the state government is left with no antidote in hand.

 With pharma firms stopping production of Brahmachari?s urea stibamine and multiple cases of kala-azar being reported from across the city and its adjoining areas, like Barasat and Garia, the government has turned to Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) for help in procuring new-generation drugs.

 The agency runs a programme called Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiatives, under which drugs are supplied to the state at affordable rates.

 Health department officials admit that the resurgence of kala-azar undermines the government?s claim that almost all diseases are in control in the state.

 ?In the past several months, 50 new cases of kala-azar have been reported from various parts of the city,? says Bibhuti Saha, head of the medicine department at School of Tropical Medicine.

 ?A survey reveals the disease has been stalking the migrant population. But considering that it is highly infectious, we fear the disease will spread fast in a densely-populated city like Calcutta. The threat perception is quite high and we are on alert,? warns Saha.

 ?The recent outbreak in and around Calcutta is ominous and it can lead to an epidemic. The city is definitely not safe, as perceived by many,? adds Mitali Chatterjee, a researcher at Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), a premier centre in kala-azar research.

 What worries the scientists and medical experts are the perfect breeding grounds of sandflies, carriers of the disease, in pockets of Hooghly, North and South 24-Parganas and Burdwan.

 The disease manifests itself with a prolonged fever and weakness and goes on to affect the spleen and the liver. Untreated, it can cause a painful death.

 ?It is often misread as malaria and we have seen cases where the patient?s condition had worsened after receiving a dose of anti-malaria drugs,? says Chatterjee. 

 ?To make things worse, there are kala-azar cases with HIV infection as well. This is something new and we are trying to find out the reasons,? Saha informs Metro.

 According to Chatterjee, the disease has not just come back with a vengeance, but has become drug-resistant. ?Almost 60 per cent of the patients do not respond to the available medicine, leaving us with no alternative but to try and find a new antidote.? 

 She had recently called a meeting of state government officials and representatives of leading bio-medical research agencies to discuss the ramifications of the outbreak and possible ways to contain it.

 Experts from IICB, National Centre for Cell Sciences (Pune), Saha Institute for Nuclear Physics (Calcutta) and National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases attended the meeting.

 Director of medical education C.R. Maiti urged the experts to find the antidotes from indigenous plants.

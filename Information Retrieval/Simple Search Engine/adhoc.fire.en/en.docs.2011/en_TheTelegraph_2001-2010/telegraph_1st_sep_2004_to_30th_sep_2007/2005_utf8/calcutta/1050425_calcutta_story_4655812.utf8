The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 July rollout for music caravan

 They said Calcutta is not ready for big-format organised music retail and the hole-in-the-wall store will continue to call the tunes. Nonetheless, MusicWorld, on Park Street, boasts the biggest ticket size per customer, Rs 443, against the national average of Rs 350.

 CDs will never do well in this price-conscious city, was another regular refrain. The cassette-to-CD sales ratio at the Park Street outlet in 2004-05 stands at 1:0.98, compared with 2:1 in 2002-03 and against the national average of 1.16:1. Another myth exploded.

 Now, the best-performing store in the RPG Enterprise chain is revving up to make new music for tomorrow. Set for a July rollout is Music on Wheels, a cool station wagon that will ferry old and new strains to the city?s fringes and its adjacent small towns.

 ?We want to reach out to those areas that don?t have access to the mother store. We will bring the music to them. They can come to the vehicle, listen and buy,? says Subbrata Kumar Chaudhury, vice-president amp; business head, Music World Entertainment Limited.

 The inside of the station wagon will be like a music retail store, with music and video-playing facilities. The exterior will carry product information in the form of motifs or posters. ?We might use the space for our own display or lease it out to various music labels for their commercial communication,? says Sanjay Gupta, head ? operations amp; marketing.

 The novel exposure vehicle will also serve as a promotional medium for Tollywood, besides marking musical and celluloid occasions including artistes? birthdays. ?We will also use the station wagon to launch certain music videos and audio software, which have the potential to do well in B and C-category towns,? adds Gupta.

 Another group project to be piloted in Calcutta is a toll-free number for the customer request log (CRL), which would enable the consumer to order his/her favourite music from the comfort of home. To be introduced by June-end, the toll-free number will enable the consumer to register from anywhere over phone.

 ?We are not happy with the gestation period for procurement of software requested through the in-store CRL. Requests registered through this special phone line will automatically trigger an e-mail to the nearest destination store, thus setting the search process in motion,? says Chaudhury.

 Also kicking off at the Park Street outlet is a customer-education initiative. A signage at the cash till will hold out relevant tips on cleaning, handling and storage of CDs and tapes. ?We have also imported a machine to clean up scratches on genuine CDs, and the service is available free at the Park Street store on Tuesdays and Thursdays,? the business head adds.

 Calcutta, which also has the chain?s highest-grossing Express outlet in Forum, is gearing up to unveil another Express store at the upcoming Gariahat Mall before the Pujas.

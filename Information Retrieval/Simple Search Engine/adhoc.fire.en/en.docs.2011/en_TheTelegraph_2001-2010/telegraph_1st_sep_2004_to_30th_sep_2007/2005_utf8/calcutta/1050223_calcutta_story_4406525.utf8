The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Vikas Syal

 General manager, INOX (Forum)

 Multiplexes like INOX charge more than single-screen theatres not only because their investment and maintenance costs are higher, but also because statutory laws governing multiplexes instruct them to do so, in order that the single-screen theatre market is not cannibalised. INOX with its multi-screen theatres, computerised ticket-booking facility, better projection and sound system, plush ambience, high standards of fire safety and hygiene, wide choice of films at flexible prices and different timings and a food court with multiple finger food and movie meals on offer, first introduced this international movie-going experience to Calcutta. Today, after being in operation for almost a year-and- half, it feels good as Calcutta?s leading multiplex, to realise that Calcuttans know when they get value for money and prefer quality to price.

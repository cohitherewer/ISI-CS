 Sarkarnama 

 Like countless directors all over the world, some of whom may admit to the fact and some who may not ? I have been deeply influenced by Francis Ford Coppola?s unforgettable movie The Godfather, both in technical style and story content.

 Yes, Sarkar has been inspired by the classic film, which offers something new on every repeated viewing.Yet at the same time, I would clarify firmly that Sarkar is not an imitation or a clone. Its story and screenplay have been located in an Indian milieu, and particularly so in the context of Mumbai?s power superstructure.

 ...The title character is not an underworld don. Rather he is a man who has rewritten the law. He has risen with time and circumstance, to wield unchecked and autocratic authority over the people living in a so-called democratic form of governance. By nature, he possesses the ability, the charisma, the intelligence and the Machiavellian cunning to control the working of the city, in all its various aspects. Sarkar is a volatile film dealing with crime, greed, love, family relationships and retribution. While acknowledging my lifelong debt to Francis Ford Coppola?s The Godfather, this is my extremely personal and original take on the Mario Puzo novel, which continues to have a universal resonance.

 Finally, I would state that Satya and Company were just preparatory blue prints for the film Sarkar. With this film, I hope that my trilogy on crime and punishment; within the reality of our country, our city and our neighbourhood; has come a full circle.

 Ram Gopal Varma

 Director, Sarkar 

 Amitabh Bachchan plays Subhash Nagare, a powerful patriarch inspired by Marlon Brando?s Vito Corleone, who believes in: ?There are no rights and wrongs... only power.?

 ?Amitabh Bachchan?s persona in Sarkar is built on the Vijay character developed by writers Salim-Javed in the 1970s. My childhood hero, I would always like to see him larger than life? ? RAM GOPAL VARMA 

 Kay Kay Menon plays Subhash?s elder son, Vishnu, quite in character with the hot-headed Santino ?Sonny? Corleone, played by James Caan in the Coppola classic.

 ?The Godfather intent is there in Sarkar definitely but the content is different. I just loved working with Mr Bachchan on the scenes and mulling over them? ? KAY KAY MENON

 Abhishek Bachchan plays the younger Nagare who, like Al Pacino?s Michael, is abroad in the initial reels before being forced to become part of the family plot.

 ?Sarkar, my next release with dad, has a very serious theme. It is totally different from the fun Bunty Aur Babli? ? ABHISHEK BACHCHAN

 The ladies reportedly play a bigger part in the Varma film than in the Puzo-Coppola screenplay. While Supriya Pathak plays Big B?s wife, Rukhsar is Kay Kay?s other half. Katrina Kaif plays Abhishek?s foreign love interest and Tanishaa his desi sweetheart.

 ?Although it is a men-oriented movie, all the women have important roles, if not lengthy ones? ? RUKHSAR 

 Manish Gupta has written the script, Amit Roy (Fida) has done the camera, Amar Mohile (Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost) the background score, and Nipun Gupta and Amit Parmar (Naach) the editing.

 How many times must a man see an ad?

 SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

 Last week I had to go to New Alipore on some work. I decided to drop in at Subir?s office. His workplace is a cosy comfortable one, not like other audit firms. He took me to a private corner away from the work desks. A TV was beaming the Test match. Irfan Pathan was in his 80s and Subir had no intention of leaving his ringside seat. He asked me to take the chair next to his. The unsaid instruction was ? do not disturb, enjoy the match.

 The over ended. That is the first time I noticed it. Subir immediately muted the volume. He started talking to me and when the picture from Kotla came back on screen, he stopped mid-sentence and resumed watching.

 This little drama kept repeating itself over after over. A million rupees worth of advertising was getting wasted. Many ask the question, why does the same ad get shown so many times? The answer is a complex one. For every ad, the aim is to reach as many people as possible and give each a reasonable number of opportunities to see.

 As any given TV programme is seen only by a small percentage of people, the ad-maker places it in as many programmes and as many times as the budget permits. There are issues that actually encourage such tear-gassing strategy.

 Quantum of advertising often has credibility connotations. When we see an ad multiple times it usually makes us believe that it is from a big company and thus reliable. Not a small benefit to have. Then there is the cost factor. Half a crore is common bill for a 40-second ad film. Having spent that money, an attempt to get adequate returns is imperative. That can only happen by showing it as many times as possible on TV.

 In the crowd of all these arguments, there is also the role of the advertising agencies. Every time an ad appears on TV, they are paid a per cent of the money that the channel charges. Can you blame them if they push for higher number of insertions? Yet, much can be said about the displeasure of watching an ad again and again. You may well ask ? doesn?t it entail the danger of switching off, first from the ad and eventually from the brand?

 The answer is yes but not many are overtly concerned. Some actually treat it as a necessary evil. The moot point is if there is a way out at all. Perhaps a solution does exist. For some time now, the mantra in ad film-making has been noticeability. The ad must stand out in a clutter. Necessarily, the form is given pre-eminence. Graphics and sound bites are more useful weapons of ad-making than a touching commentary. Maybe the time has come to shift the focus.

 Entertainment value of an ad may now need to take centre stage. It is important to remember that these days an ad is inevitably punctuating a Pathan straight drive or a Bachchan monologue. The ad needs to match that mood. Second, entertainment also has tremendous clutter-breaking potential. So, nothing needs to be traded off. And finally, higher entertainment value of an ad is possibly the only way to make the predestined repeat viewing less irritating. Indeed, it can make multiple viewing desirable.

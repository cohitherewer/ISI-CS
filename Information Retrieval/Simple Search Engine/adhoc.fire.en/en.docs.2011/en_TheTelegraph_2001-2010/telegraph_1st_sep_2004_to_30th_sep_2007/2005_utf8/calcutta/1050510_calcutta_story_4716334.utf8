 The Rs 10-crore Citizens? Park will have a permanent open-air gallery housing selected military hardware with texts explaining the role they had played in the country?s defence.

 The gallery will be a joint venture of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, army and the Indian Air Force.

 Fighter and bomber aircraft, canons, armoured vehicles, tanks that took part in the Kargil war and in the Indo-Pak and Sino-India hostilities and weapons seized from enemies will be put on display in the gallery. 

 Children will be allowed to enter the cockpits of fighter planes on display, like Hunter, Gnat, Vampire, Hurricane, Canberra and Mig-21, while older visitors can inspect tanks, anti-aircraft guns and long-range artillery that played important roles in protecting the country.

 ?Following a discussion with Union defence minister Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday night, I directed municipal commissioner Debashis Som to prepare a proposal to be sent to the ministry in Delhi,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Monday.

 It was agreed during the discussion that such a gallery would help in the promotion of patriotism and nationalism among citizens and lead to a better relationship among civilians and military personnel.

 Rs 8 crore has already been spent on the development of the park. The civic authorities might take on additional financial responsibility to set up the open-air gallery. 

 According to officer-on-special duty to the mayor Shaktibrata Ghosh, the gallery will have two special sections. One of them will commemorate through photographs and texts memorable feats by defence personnel.

 The other will deal with the birth of Bangladesh from East Pakistan and the unconditional surrender of the Pakistani army to the Indian force at Dhaka. 

 In another development, mayor Mukherjee has spoken to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee for the deployment of mounted police at Citizens? Park. 

 The 11-acre park has recorded high footfall after the defence minister inaugurated it on Sunday evening. 

 ?The rush was so heavy that we had to run the dancing fountain till 10.30 pm. The fountain itself cost Rs 1.5 crore,? said the mayor. He expressed hope that the park would become a must-visit for tourists in the city.

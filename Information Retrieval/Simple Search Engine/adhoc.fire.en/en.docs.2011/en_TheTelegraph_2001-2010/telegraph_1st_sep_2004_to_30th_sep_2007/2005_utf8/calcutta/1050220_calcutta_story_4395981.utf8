The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 That?s just the way it is

 From Lok Sabha to Indian Idol, can 

 a self-selecting sample be representative of public opinion?

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 I 

 was attending a conference in Orissa. Televisions in our 

 hotel rooms had a limited number of channels and Sony was 

 not one of them. This was a Friday. In the evening, there 

 was the usual get together. Even in their slightly inebriated 

 state, I found many middle-aged men remembering to call 

 their homes to find out who got chucked out that week ? 

 Rahul or Arpita or Ravinder? Indian Idol has brought 

 back some of the frenzy that was associated with earlier 

 superhits like KBC. People are again asking on Thursdays: 

 Sade nau baj gaye kya?

 There is just one reservation 

 that keeps getting voiced. In the final stage of the competition, 

 the jury has been changed. From experts, the onus to choose 

 the winners has been passed on to the public. No, the debate 

 is not whether the public is equipped to judge the talents 

 of these singers. Many in fact argue that it is the public 

 that pays money to consume their talent, so it is only fair 

 that they judge the talent.

 The issue that engages many minds 

 is whether true public opinion is being reflected. Why the 

 doubt? Inevitably it is because an individual choice has 

 quarrelled with the collective. The petite girl you were 

 rooting for got eliminated. You have every right to feel 

 upset ? after all, it is your choice that is being negated. 

 And you are as much a part of the public as anyone else.

 The issue being debated is whether 

 the judgment reflects true public opinion. To answer this, 

 we must know who the ?public? is. Is everybody getting included? 

 What if you are not watching the programme? What if you 

 do not have a mobile phone or find it too expensive to make 

 a long-distance call from the landline?

 Now, now, now, I can hear the 

 channel top brass censuring me, do not go overboard with 

 this. This is an upmarket television programme and that 

 is the segment of the Indian public we are interested in. 

 Fair enough. The question that remains is still very pertinent: 

 are the selections reflecting the views of this smaller 

 universe? Yes, of course, many would say, just witness the 

 millions of SMSs Sony gets every week.

 The catch is elsewhere. True public 

 opinion can only be gauged by knowing the views of every 

 member of the public, whichever way you choose to define 

 it. But census is an expensive proposition. Even the Government 

 of India can afford to do it only once every 10 years.

 Every Thursday, Sony leaves it 

 to us to decide whether we want our views to be included. 

 We have the choice. And like airlines and hotel feedback 

 forms, only those of us with extreme emotions of happiness 

 or anger take the trouble of responding. The rest of us 

 are happy criticising the system. The sample is not random 

 but self-selecting. And a self-selected sample can have 

 very little claim to representativeness and veracity.

 Let me remind you that the process 

 of selecting our MLAs and MPs is the same. To vote or not 

 to vote is our choice; the sample is self-selecting. We 

 conveniently assume that those of us who do not vote have 

 the same preference as those who are voting. If we can do 

 that for deciding who should run our country, should we 

 crib about the Indian Idol?

Long hours in front of the computer can 

play havoc with our general wellness. A few simple exercises done while at work 

can help keep common ailments at bay, says Zeeshan Jawed

The good, the bad and the ugly? The computer, they 

say, plays a triple role in our lives today. It?s good because of the obvious 

reasons ? cutting time and costs, vaulting barriers and boundaries. It?s bad because 

of what it does to our nerves, muscles and general wellness. It?s ugly because 

of a reason more insidious ? the machine it can make of us.

While the third and the biggest menace reveals its 

effects in the long run, the threat to the body can make life miserable after 

a few years in front of the computer. ?Except the fingers, none of the body parts 

are in motion when one is using the computer and this can be quite damaging to 

the body,? says Gautam Deb, senior trainer at Add Life fitness centre. 

The worst-affected areas are the eyes, neck, spine, 

wrists and fingers. While regular fitness regimens are a luxury for most professionals 

hard-pressed for time, some easy exercises done while at work can go a long way 

in keeping ailments at bay. 

Back basics

The back definitely bears the major brunt and hence 

it?s this part that suffers most. Lumbago or lower back pain is one of the most 

common problems, caused due to constant extension of the limbs. A simple exercise 

that helps tackle this entails keeping the spine in the neutral position and tightening 

the lower muscles, leaning backwards, lifting both feet a few inches off the floor, 

and returning to the starting position. 

Another major menace is sciatica ? nerve pain in the 

hips and rear thigh. ?Sitting straight on a chair and moving the legs up and down 

at 45-degree angles and bending the quadriceps helps reduce the pain,? says Deb.

Sitting in front of the computer in a particular posture 

for long stretches can cause spondylitis. To reduce hazards, one should move the 

neck forward and backward up to 10 degrees six times in a row and repeat this 

every 30 minutes. 

Hands down

Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common ailments 

caused by the computer. Continuous use of the keyboard for a long time can inflame 

tendons that press on the nerves in the wrist, ultimately damaging them and resulting 

in nagging pain. The pain can be relieved by putting the arms on the tabletop 

with hands folded in a fist and slowly moving the wrists forward and backward 

several times.

Typing in bursts can cause irritation in the fingers, 

which can be overcome by placing a hand towel on the table and squeezing it and 

folding the entire towel under the palm. 

Eye effect

Looking at the computer screen for long stretches 

causes the eyes to blink less often and exposes the surface to dust. Looking away 

from the screen every 15 minutes and eyeing something at a distance of around 

20 feet soothes the eye muscles. Blinking rapidly for a few seconds every now 

and then refreshes the eyes.

Watch out

While exercises help ease the problems partially, 

some basic precautions can go a long way in avoiding them. Choosing a chair with 

good back and arm support is essential. One must also keep changing the posture 

periodically throughout the day. While typing from a document use a stand for 

the paper to avoid twisting the neck and bending the spine. Position the keyboard 

at elbow height in front of you to reduce stress on the upper arm. 

?It?s also very important to be relaxed. If you are 

stressed out, the neck and shoulder muscles are tense and this can be damaging,? 

says Deb. 

Take a break

Taking periodic breaks is a must for both the mind 

and the body. ?I feel fatigued almost every two hours. The eyes hurt, muscles 

cramp and joints get locked. A walk to the coffee kiosk really helps,? says Arun 

Mookerjee, accounts executive with Vishnu Solutions. 

?Micro-breaks are not necessarily breaks from work, 

but from the use of a particular set of muscles that?s doing most of the work,? 

feels Deb. 

During a short break, stand up, move around, make 

a trip to the coffee counter, or do some other work like making a phone call or 

photocopying documents. 

Software support

We tend to ignore the number of hours we spend working 

at the computer. Installing a software (download at www.magnitude.com) 

displaying the number of hours the computer is in use at a stretch might prompt 

you to take a break or remind you of the exercises that need to be done.

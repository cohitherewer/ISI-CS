 You have to give tradition its due

 - Gandhian artist on guiding principles

 What do you make of an artist who is steeped in tradition yet clicks the mouse with the same ease with which he has wielded a brush throughout his artistic career? ?I use the computer a lot. If you feel the colour blue you can do it in a second. Cutting and pasting become so simple. You can scan a flower ? then I feel better ? and put it in your work,? says Haku Shah. 

 The artist and teacher from Valod near Surat is in his 70s, and is known for his passionate engagement with the indigenous crafts and his effort to bring them back to our everyday lives. He was in town on Tuesday for the opening of an exhibition at CIMA Gallery.

 Haku Shah is a tiny man in pajama kurta. Bubbling with energy and with an eloquent body language, he tries to explain his views on art influenced by Gandhian principles, his cheerful spirit never deserting him. 

 As a teacher and facilitator, his aim has always been opening the minds of his students to the infinite possibilities of the act of creation, without worrying about the nitty-gritty. This is how he taught in 1955 at Gandhi Ashram at Vedchhi, where students were told to clear a place, and embellish it with the simplest materials the way they enjoyed doing it. 

 ?Do whatever you want. That opens windows and doors for all art schools. If that can be done it is good,? says Hakubhai, as he is known, in a language that is as straightforward as the lines of his oils on canvases. This has been his guiding principle as a teacher in some of the best-known institutes.

 For him even something as simple as making chappals, too, is an art ?whenever there is creativity at the core.? A craft is an art if it is not mass-produced and creativity comes into play. ?The Kalighat and Nathadwara paintings had a great thing to offer. The ultimate aim of that is joy and to share that joy with the ultimate. The ultimate is not just god but the common man too.? 

 But he is dead against the imposition of ideas and concepts by NGOs, politicians and development workers because they have half-baked ideas on such issues, that can ruin traditional crafts, going by what has happened in the past. Similarly, he is against the distortion of tradition for political gains.

 He regrets that the NID neglects indigenous design and kantha, Warli and Madhubani ?return with a bad face.? 

 This does not make him a standpatter though. ?Change I don?t deny.? But it must be ushered in by designers, artists and dancers.

 Money, however, plays a vital role in his value system. While he is against discussions on artists as personalities instead of their art, Haku Shah makes it clear that ?cost is a part of life and it has to be respected fully.? If an artisan prices a pot at Rs 200, one has to pay him that much without bargaining. When it comes to his own work, too, he sticks to this principle.

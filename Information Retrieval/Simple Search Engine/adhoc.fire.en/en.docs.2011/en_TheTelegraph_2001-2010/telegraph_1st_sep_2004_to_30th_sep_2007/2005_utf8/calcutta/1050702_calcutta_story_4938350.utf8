The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor, men in the wings

 - COUNCILLORS CAUTIONED

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya will be elected mayor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on July 5. The newly-elected councillors, however, will take the oath a day earlier.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will address a victory rally in front of the CMC headquarters on SN Banerjee Road after the official swearing-in ceremony. 

 CPM councillor from Behala Nirmal Mukherjee will be elected chairman of the civic body on the same day.

 Senior CPM councillor Samar Roychowdhury will act as the pro tem chairman during the oath-taking ceremony of the councillors on July 4.

 The CPM will be holding most of the key posts ? that of mayor, chairman and seven members in the mayoral council. While the RSP has bagged the post of deputy mayor and a seat in the mayoral council, the CPI and Forward Bloc will take a post each in the council.

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas and other Left Front leaders on Friday met at the Calcutta district committee office, on AJC Bose Road, to finalise the allotment of portfolios. Biswas announced that RSP?s Kalyan Mukherjee will take over as deputy mayor and look after the twin portfolios of water supply in ships and agency and stores.

 Distribution of the mayoral council portfolios revealed that the CPM?s Calcutta district committee has scored over the South 24-Parganas unit. Only two councillors from the district unit ? Nirmal Mukherjee and Chandana Ghosh Dastidar ? have been inducted into the civic board in key posts.

 It is learnt that CPM state secretary Biswas and other Front leaders, like Ashok Ghosh and Manju Kumar Majumder, met the newly-elected councillors and urged them to attend the CMC monthly meetings regularly.

 ?Our Opposition parties ? the Trinamul Congress and Congress ? are strong enough to embarrass the mayor and you have to be alert about this,? the Front leaders had reportedly told the councillors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ideate versus 

implement

 What is worse mdash; poor planning or shoddy execution? For the consumer, the combination is what matters

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This was last Sunday. One of the popular Bengali channels had organised a day-long event, and called it Poila Mela. The event was telecast live. There were two large well-decorated stages to ensure seamless continuity of performances. Almost all the popular TV personalities were roped in as anchors. Most reputed singers of the city performed. In addition, there were stalls put up for each of the popular programmes that the channel telecasts currently. The ardent viewer could meet the stars of those shows at these pavilions.

 Then there were two stalls that were imaginatively conceived. The first one had a tree where you could tie a piece of cloth and wish for something. They called it ichhe gaachh or the wish tree. This was an excellent attempt at converting a semi-religious ritual into a fun thing. As one anchor confessed, he tied a cloth on the wish tree wishing for a long-awaited dinner date with Bipasha Basu. The second was christened Aro bhalo, meaning even better. Viewers went there and had their say about what they felt needed to be done to improve their favourite soap or game show.

 The programme started at eight in the morning. Right through the day, the ambience was hot and humid. Only in the evening did the atmosphere become conducive for a musical concert. Till then, the attendance at the venue was limited to local passersby. Then there were other telecasting hindrances. Dictates of commerce had to be given precedence. Commercial breaks went on as scheduled. The singer did not know; he had to stop midway and then start again as Surf or Pepsi had not finished singing their tunes for the umpteenth time. The news breaks had the same impact.

 Some minor hiccups were also there. The live feed network collapsed. The stage was frozen into inaction and the TV screen carried an apology message while showing scenes from popular Bengali films. At the very beginning, live on camera, four beautiful ladies and a handsome hero spent considerable time lighting the proverbial lamp. The breeze on the dais was too strong for lighting an oil lamp.

 The ceremony was well conceived, but the details were obviously not as well looked after. A television channel is not a mere medium. It is a content producer as well. The responsibility for generating eyeballs thus solely lies with it. Daily soaps, game shows and weekend films are the staple offerings. The idea to get off the beaten track, go outdoor and have a day-long festival was by any standards a good one. It would have possibly brought more people into its fold ? a marketing task difficult to achieve at the best of times.

 There were two things that conspired against that ambition. First, the channel neglected the task of attracting the audience to the venue. I cannot think of any other explanation for the day-long programme being held in the hottest month in Calcutta. The point to ponder is whether live audience is potential TV audience. And more importantly, a critical debate would be whether a large live audience adds to the enjoyment of the programme by the people sitting in front of their TV sets.

 Has a good idea been defeated by its execution? In the world of consumer entertainment, indeed in almost any world, good ideas are difficult to come by. It is even more difficult to execute good ideas. An unfortunate question perhaps needs to be answered ? is mediocrity in ideas preferable to slipshod execution? One point is however beyond debate ? you and I can hardly separate the execution from the idea. We consume the product of the two.

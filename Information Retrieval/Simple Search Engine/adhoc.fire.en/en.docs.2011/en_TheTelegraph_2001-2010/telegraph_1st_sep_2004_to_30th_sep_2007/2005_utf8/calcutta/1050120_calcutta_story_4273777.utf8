 Tech minnows make a splash

 - Fledgling firms grow silently, ramping up headcount amp; raking in revenue

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Growth was the buzzword in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s blessed information technology (IT) sector in 2004 and all eyes were on the Wipros and IBMs. But it was the smaller IT companies that kept growing silently, adding to the headcount and improving on top-lines.

 ?This is a healthy trend and we are happy with the performance of these small outfits,? said G. D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT.

 According to him, out of the Rs 1,780 crore of export earnings by the state?s IT and IT enabled services (ITES) companies in 2003-04, around 50 per cent was contributed by the smaller and fledgling outfits. Also, around 50 per cent of the 24,000 people, employed in over 210 such companies, work with these establishments.

 ?The fact that we are getting both bigger and smaller new companies here is encouraging. It is true that we need big names, but I must admit that the smaller firms are the fulcrum of this industry,? said Gautama, highlighting the names of the latest two entrants ? Customer First Services and iVision India ? in Saltlec?s IT space. Bangalore-based BPO outfit Customer First Services announced the launch of its city operations on Wednesday. The company, specialising in voice-based and web-based customer support, plans to ramp up headcount to 400 by March. iVision India will formally flag off its India operations on Friday.

 Though a steady stream of new players in the market will result in greater competition for manpower and demand expansion in infrastructure facilities, no one is complaining. While the companies are wishing away concerns with forecasts of higher business volume, the state government is confident about putting the necessary infrastructure in place at the right time.

 ?Despite the backlash against outsourcing, more and more companies are realising its benefits and projects are flowing in,? said Koustav Ghosh, managing director, Connectiva Systems. The one-and-a-half-year-old software product company is expecting a ?near 80 per cent growth? in revenue over last year?s $ 5 million and has plans to double its workforce from the existing strengths of 55.

 Growth and expansion plans feature high on the agenda of almost all new market entrants in the city?s tech township. ?We have around 140 people between our centres in Calcutta and Visakhapatnam. We will grow to 500 people and look at revenues of around $ 15 million this year,? said Kalyan Kar of the non-voice BPO outfit. Another BPO firm, Databazaar, should have 220 employees on its rolls by July and record a 15 per cent surge in group revenues.

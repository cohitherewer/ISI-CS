The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bars like to serve drinks till dawn

 - Hotels urge police to allow tipplers longer hours, cops cite brawl odds

 KINSUK BASU

 Hotels want to keep their bars open till the wee hours. 

 In a recent letter to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, a group of city hotels, under the banner of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India, has appealed for a reconsideration of the time bar and sought to operate till late, after submission of ?late-night fees?. 

 Now, only star hotels are allowed to stay open till 2 am on special occasions, after they have submitted the late-night fees. For others, police are clearly reluctant. Not everybody is equipped to keep things under control, they feel. 

 ?This is a mindset that needs to be changed. So, we have appealed to the police to take a fresh look at the rules and do away with the discrimination. This is not fair. All others are willing to abide by the rules to ensure there is no problem in operating till the morning. All that the cops have to do is listen to us,? claims S.K. Khullar, association vice-president. 

 Arguing its case, the association said in an age when consumer is king, confining late-night binges, particularly on weekends, to a few bars in five-star hotels cannot be right. 

 ?You are, in effect, restricting the choice of consumers. So, give them a chance as well,? argues Alok Chaudhury, secretary of the association.

 While hoteliers claim they are equipped to take on the challenge, police believe otherwise. 

 Citing problems of space jam and brawls, the police believe that throwing open the gate to all is not a good idea. Besides, the Calcutta Police regulations don?t have such provisions. 

 ?A guideline was framed years ago and we go by it. And it?s not just about the law and order alone. One has to consider crime and other factors. After all, the police will be held responsible in case of an unpleasant incident,? argues Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

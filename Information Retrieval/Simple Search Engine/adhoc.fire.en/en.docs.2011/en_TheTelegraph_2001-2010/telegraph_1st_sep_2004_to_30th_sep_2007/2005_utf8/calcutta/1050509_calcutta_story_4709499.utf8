 Tryst with Tagore

 A poet, a visionary and a Renaissance man par excellence, Rabindranath Tagore reigns eternally over Bengal?s cultural horizon. To commemorate his 144th birth anniversary, a number of celebrations are being held in different parts of the city. Performances of Tagore?s poetry, songs, drama and dances at the Rabindra Sadan complex and at Tagore?s birthplace, Jorasanko Thakurbari, take off at 6 in the morning, continuing throughout the day. Nava Nalanda?s cultural tribute, Rabindra Smaran (at 25 Southern Avenue, 6.30 am), features music and dance recitals by its teachers and students, besides solo renditions of songs and poems by eminent artistes. At Gyan Manch, 10 am, Surangama hosts a festival of recitation and songs featuring popular artistes. Bidhannagar Sanskriti Angan (at Central Park, 6 am), Golf Green Pachishe Baisakh Committee (at Golf Green, 4 pm) and Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture (at Ranikuthi, 5 pm) also offer a bouquet of the bard?s compositions to mark the occasion.

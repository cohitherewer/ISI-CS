The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Exercising control over stent pricing

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Goodbye surgery, welcome angioplasty.

 With a revolution in medical technology and angioplasties fast replacing conventional surgeries, a serious attempt has been made for the first time to bring some control over the quality of stents and their irrational pricing.

 In the past four years, the development of angioplasty and other minimally-invasive procedures like coronary angiograms in major metros, including Calcutta, has increased by a whopping 35 per cent, compared with barely a 10 per cent growth in cardiac surgeries, according to statistics available with the health department.

 Come December and all drug-eluding stent-manufacturing (about five to seven) companies, both foreign and domestic, will have to obtain a licence from the central licensing authority under the drug controller of India, after producing sufficient data of its efficacy and trial results before a stent is marketed. 

 This move is being viewed as the first step taken by health department officers towards quality control and exercising some hold over irrational pricing of stents. 

 A drug-coated stent is a metallic coil device implanted in the artery to stop re-narrowing and acute closure of arteries. The drug released gradually into the artery further helps reduce chances of re-narrowing. 

 ?With stents being brought under the Drug and Cosmetic Act (similar to drugs), this will be the first serious step towards bringing a regulation on usage of stents. We are working on the final modalities of the blueprint before the new rules are officially enforced,? Ashwini Kumar, drug controller of India, said over the telephone from Delhi.

 Health department officers said once the stents are brought under the new rules, the issue of irrational pricing can be easily addressed under the Drug Pricing Control Act, now being used to decrease prices of life-saving drugs. 

 With the price of stents hovering anywhere between Rs 60,000 (Indian stents like Pronova) and Rs 1.2 lakh (Johnson amp; Johnson) the patient is left at the mercy of companies and doctors with absolutely no scope of finding out which stent is best suited to him.

 In Calcutta, the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) ? a conglomerate of top private hospitals of the city ? has taken the lead in informing patients about the irrational pricing and how to stop this practice.

 ?We are aware of the price factor and are making all-out efforts to inform a patient about the prices and their variations. With the new rules in place, we are hopeful that our long-standing endeavour of providing quality cardiac treatment available even to the lower-income group is finally realised,? said Sajal Dutta, AHEI president and managing director of Ruby General Hospital.

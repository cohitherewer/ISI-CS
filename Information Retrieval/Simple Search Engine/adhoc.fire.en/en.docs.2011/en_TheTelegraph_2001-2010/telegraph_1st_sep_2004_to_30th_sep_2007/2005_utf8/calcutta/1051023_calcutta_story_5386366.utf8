 Members of Triple X at Virgose

 Virgose, the resto-bar at HHI, is hosting Triple X. Before the mind runs riot, Triple X is an all-woman band performing here till November 21.

 With Underground coming up, we now enjoy the choice of segregating our crowd. While the new disc would cater to the young and energetic, we want to project Virgose as a haunt for the corporate and consular crowd. We will make live music a regular feature here. The Columbian band has been brought in to liven up the atmosphere, says Vinay Jaiswal, head of operations, HHI.

 The band would initially play Columbian music with some English tracks thrown in.

 To add to the experience, dig into some Columbian delicacies at the food festival thats also on till November 21. Some of the items are Crab Meat Soup (with coconut milk and okra), Mexican Corn Soup and Jerk Chicken (Caribbean spiced chicken with rum). We would try not to dish out the same cuisine every time, says Jaiswal.

 Soul sound

 Chamber orchestra is a symphony where the members of the band play their instruments in a small enclosure or chamber without any amplifying accompaniments. It is attended by a very small gathering.

 On Wednesday and Thursday evening, a select few at Taj Bengals Crystal Room tuned into some soul-stirring music by Chamber Soloists Lucerne.

 The Swiss band comprises acclaimed musicians, most of them professors at the Musikhochschule of Lucerne, Switzerland. In our quest for entertaining and fulfilling programs, we play music spanning the broad stylistic range of chamber-music literature, from the flamboyant to the contemporary, says Jurg Eichenberger who plays the cello. The other members are Daniel Dodds (violin), Markus Wieser (viola) and Christina Gallati (viola). Ying Yang, a pipa player from China, joined them as guest performer. Both the string instrument and its sound drew quite a lot of attention. Pipa is a very ancient Chinese musical instrument. Back in China, it is played on happy occasions, said Yang.

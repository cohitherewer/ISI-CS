 A fund earmarked for cash awards to two destitute children, who did India and Bengal proud at an international event last year, has been diverted to an organisation without the knowledge of senior officials.

 Ashikul Islam and Saiful Mondol are the two unfortunate children who, along with 10 others, had made a film that bagged the first prize in the Kids for Kids Film Festival in Athens in 2004. The 20-minute documentary, Ami, was the sole Indian entry at the festival and was also the first film in India directed and acted in by destitute children.

 The protagonist are all inmates of Muktoneer, run by Free the Children-India in Dum Dum.

 The state government had been all praise for Islam and Mondol. Eleven months ago, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had met the duo and promised all help to further their creative pursuits.

 A few weeks later, Swapan Mukherjee, secretary of Free the Children-India, learnt that the government had backed the children?s names for national awards and also recommended a cash prize of Rs 20,000 for Islam and Mondol. The money was to come from a special fund in the social welfare department.

 After getting the governor?s mandatory approval in January, joint secretary in the department of women and child development and social welfare P.K. Sen wrote to the accountant-general and the pay and accounts office to disburse the amount to the two children. The money had been ?already allotted to them? in the 2004-05 financial year, the letter stated.

 On March 29, director in the social welfare department K.P. Sinha wrote back to Sen that the money allotted for the cash awards had been ?sub-allotted? to Anandamath, a government-run home in Purulia. 

 ?There is no balance left with the directorate to meet the expenditure on prize money,? he added.

 On learning the bitter truth, Mukherjee approached Sen for a clarification. ?He was stunned to hear that the children have not received the money,? Mukherjee told Metro. ?He said he had not gone through Sinha?s letter. He assured me of all help in the next financial year.?

 Sen did not wish to speak on the matter. ?Please get in touch with the social welfare director. He would be able to tell you what has happened to the case,? was all he would say. 

 Additional director in the social welfare department Ajay Bhattacharya said he did not have any clue as to how the money was transferred. ?I will find out what has happened in this case,? he promised.

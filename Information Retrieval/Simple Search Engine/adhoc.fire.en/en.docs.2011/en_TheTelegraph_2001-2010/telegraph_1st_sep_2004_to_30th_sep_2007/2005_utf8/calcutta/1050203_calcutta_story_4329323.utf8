 - State to probe expulsion, parents cry rights

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The state government on Wednesday threatened to withdraw the no-objection certificate (NOC) granted to Augustine?s Public School if the authorities are found to have taken a wrong decision in rusticating a Class IV student for not wearing a half-sleeved sweater.

 State school education minister Kanti Biswas said a senior official of the department would conduct the inquiry.

 ?We are aware that Augustine?s Public School is a private institution. But the government has every right to withdraw the NOC if any private school is found to unnecessarily harass students,? Biswas said. 

 The minister added that the government would take the final stand on the matter after getting the inquiry report.

 Augustine?s Public School is affiliated to the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations. According to rules, schools located in Bengal need to obtain an NOC from the state government to seek affiliation to any board with headquarters outside the state.

 The parents of the rusticated student, Bodhisatwa Chatterjee, have decided to appeal to the state human rights commission for justice. 

 ?We will present the matter before state human rights commission chairman Shyamal Kumar Sen,? said Bodhisatwa?s father Dilip Chatterjee. He added that the draft was ready and the petition will be on Sen?s table within a couple of days.

 ?The school authorities are depriving my son of a fundamental right for a silly reason,? alleged Chatterjee.

 Bodhisatwa and eight others, who used to sit beside the windows in the classroom, were reportedly asked by a teacher to wear full-sleeved sweaters, which prompted them to violate the school dress code. 

 ?Why would we ask students to violate a rule that we ourselves have formulated?? asked A.K. Augustines, secretary and disciplinary-in-charge of the school.

 The school has been on the boil after the authorities refused to take Bodhisatwa on an excursion to Millennium Park on Tuesday. 

 Chhatra Parishad activists had protested the decision by holding a demonstration and blocking the road in front of the Howrah school. The school remained closed on Wednesday.

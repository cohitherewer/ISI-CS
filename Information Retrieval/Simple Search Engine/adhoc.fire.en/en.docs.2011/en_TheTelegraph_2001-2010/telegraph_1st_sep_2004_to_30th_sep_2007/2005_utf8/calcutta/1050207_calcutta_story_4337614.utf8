 Together, to heal the tsunami scars

 - STUDENTS? INITIATIVE SNOWBALLS INTO MOVEMENT

 A STAFF REPORTER

Steve Waugh is firmly behind the YuthScape 

concert, which will feature band Aasma (above), among others 

 It began as an initiative by a bunch of students ?from the inability to sit back and be mute witnesses to nature?s fury?. The movement soon snowballed into a joint effort of adults and youngsters, the famous and not-so-famous. 

 The aim is just one: ?making a positive contribution to lives ravaged by the tsunami?. 

 YuthScape was born when students from various schools and colleges came together to do their bit. They put their heads and hearts to use, pooling their resources to raise funds for tsunami survivors. The unanimous choice ? a music concert. 

 For the past month, YuthScape has been overcoming the obstacles in its path, and the plan is now about to see the light of day. 

 One World will be held on February 12, in association with TTIS, with Calcutta and Mumbai artistes performing. The money will be used for the reconstruction of schools and homes and rehabilitation of the tsunami victims in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 

 The performers at the five-hour concert will be Insomnia, Fossils, Aasma and Neha Bhasin of Viva fame. The tickets are priced at Rs 100, and the concert will be held on the La Martiniere school grounds, with a standing capacity of over 10,000. 

 The tickets can later be redeemed at Clown Town. As an added treat, Aasma will be visiting schools and colleges, as well as the malls, to meet young fans. A surprise element will be a VJ, making the rounds with the band on February 11.

 To help the youth brigade in its efforts, several adults came forward, joining hands for the cause. 

 Together We Will was formed, comprising members from the Rotary Clubs of Calcutta, The Art of Living, Calcutta Foundation, BP Poddar Trust and Silver Spring, among others. 

 Even former Australian cricketer Steve Waugh has lent his support, with his face and words on One World concert advertisements. ?Together we will rehabilitate tsunami survivors in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Help us to help them,? is his message. Then, the Church of North India stepped forward, securing wider school support for the young organisers of the concert.

 ?The response has been overwhelming,? says Madhumita Das, a Jadavpur University student and one of the organisers of One World. 

 For block bookings from schools, as well as volunteers willing to lend helping hands on D-Day at the venue, dial 9831364693.

 Offers of help have been pouring in, even from celebrities. Actress June called up to lend her support. ?People like Moon Moon Sen, Piu Sarkar and Arjun Chakraborty said they would come to the concert because we are doing a good thing,? adds Madhumita.

 But not everyone has been as supportive. Some Calcutta bands wanted to be paid for their performances. 

 Others, however, were all ready to play for free for the cause, like Hip Pocket, Cactus and even Euphoria. The dates, though, didn?t match.

 The youngsters are happy to be able to do something to help those in need. In fact, some of them will be travelling to the islands, to aid the reconstruction work.

 Security deposit for use of civic parks 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Starting next year, organisers will have to make a security deposit with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to hold pujas or programmes in the civic parks.

 The decision was taken to prevent the parks from being damaged. 

 Deshapriya Park, Maddox Square, Md. Ali Park and other parks that were let out by the organisers during this year?s Durga puja have been badly damaged.

 Community pujas were held in 81 civic parks this year. Stalls were set up in 30 of them. 

 The civic authorities have started sending bills to the puja committees that had rented out space in the parks. 

 Among others, organisers of the Durga puja on Deshapriya Park have received a bill of Rs 1.3 lakh.

 This is the first time the civic body has tried to realise money from puja organisers for unauthorised use of civic space. 

 Mayoral council member for parks and gardens Faiyaz Ahmed Khan stressed that by letting out portions of the parks, the puja organisers had violated the undertaking they had signed while obtaining permission to hold pujas.

 He revealed that some leaders of the ruling party had requested him to exempt the organisers from paying the bills.

 ?We have information that the puja organising committees charged Rs 400 daily from even vendors and hawkers. Stall-owners had to pay to the tune of Rs 40,000,? Khan stated.

 ?The parks are severely damaged when they are let out for commercial purposes. The CMC has to then spend a huge sum to restore them,? explained the mayoral council member.

 Congress leader of the civic Opposition Pradip Ghosh could not care less. 

 ?We have been holding pujas in the civic parks free of cost before the birth of Faiyaz Khan and we will continue to do so in the future,? he asserted.

 He alleged that the CMC was using the city?s parks to earn money. 

 ?If the civic body charges money for holding functions or pujas in its parks, then how can people differentiate between a CMC property and the lawn of a private house?? asked Ghosh.

 ?Holding fairs in the parks have become lucrative business for a section of political leaders. In the future, organisers will have to pay up to hold any kind of religious and social function in the civic parks. Even the organisers of Kali puja and Urs will not be spared,? was how Khan responded.

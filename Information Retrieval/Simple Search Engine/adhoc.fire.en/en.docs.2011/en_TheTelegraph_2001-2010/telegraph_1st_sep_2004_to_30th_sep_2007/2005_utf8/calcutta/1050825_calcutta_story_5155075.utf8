 Being the President

 He is one of the most popular and controversial US Presidents of all time. She?s perhaps the most popular talk-show host in America.

 Bill Clinton meets Oprah Winfrey to talk about his fascinating new memoir and what it?s really like being President, on Oprah Prime Time.

 On the STAR World show, scheduled to air on Sunday, Clinton says: ?Becoming President requires decisions at a whole different level of difficulty and complexity. I had to be prepared to go ahead and make mistakes, then put them behind me. And in the end, if you make your mistakes in good faith, and you make more good choices than bad ones, it comes out all right. In writing the book, I wanted people to understand what it feels like to be President...?

 Oprah even asks the ex-President about his feelings toward Hillary during those many times when he betrayed her. ?I always loved her a lot,? Clinton replies solemnly, ?but not always well.?

 Or, how did he feel when his daughter would barely talk to him and his wife banished him to the couch? ?I was all alone again, just like I had been as a little boy.?

 During the in-depth, hour-long episode, Clinton dwells on his marriage, mistakes, childhood and the best-selling biography My Life.

 Catch Bill Clinton on Oprah Prime Time, August 28 at 8.30 pm, on STAR World.

 Parambrata: Fast trackThe Clintons: Kiss and tell

 Though he has made his name as a sensitive actor, the director?s seat has always appealed to Parambrata Chatterjee more than anything else. Now, the 20-something is getting behind the camera to shoot his first telefilm Premer Galpo, featuring Rajatava Dutta, Sudipa Basu and Kanchan Mullick.

 ?I had decided that I would be a film-maker when I was in Class VIII. Acting was accidental. But it has increased my association with the idiom,? says Feluda?s Topshe.

 Premer Galpo is a love story and a fun film but nothing of teenage mush, clarifies the debutant director. ?A relationship develops between Sudipa and Rajatava, while Kanchan plays the sutradhar?,? is all that he will reveal at the moment.

 The lanky actor admits to have learnt the craft of film-making by being a keen observer on the sets. ?Hands-on experience is very important. But I also used to read film analysis and had the habit of watching films right from childhood. My family has contributed a lot in this regard. I think telefilms is a good way to start and gather experience,? says Parambrata, who plans to switch to feature films later. 

 Parambrata starts shooting at a Hindustan Park house from end-September. Premer Galpo will be shown on Tara Bangla.

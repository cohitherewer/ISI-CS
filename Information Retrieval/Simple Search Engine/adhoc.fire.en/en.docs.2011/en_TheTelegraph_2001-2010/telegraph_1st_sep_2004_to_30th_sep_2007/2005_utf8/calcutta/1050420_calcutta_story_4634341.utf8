 Scorcher knock awakens bugs and maladies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The scorching summer may not have arrived yet, but Calcuttans are already facing the heat ? the rush of patients with severe muscle cramps, dehydration and diarrhoea have prompted doctors to sound the alarm.

 Although the maximum temperature has been hovering around 35 degrees Celsius for the past few days, the humidity is killing, working as a big deterrent to people with outdoor jobs.

 ?We are getting patients with electrolyte imbalance, caused by loss of salt. Several others are complaining of immobility and severe cramps in the evening,? said city-based physician Susovan Halder.

 Many corporate offices are advising employees to seek medical help, having found that by evening, most of them are left with severe muscle cramps and dizziness.

 ?I advise all of them to drink plenty of water and also eat citrus fruits to keep themselves fit,? Halder added.

 Almost all state-run hospitals ? including SSKM, Calcutta Medical College and RG Kar ? have been getting dozens of patients, including children, with heat stroke and fatigue over the past two days. 

 ?We have put the patients on fluids to save them from dehydration,? said A. Biswas, deputy superintendent at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.

 The hospitals are all gearing up for a possible outbreak of gastro-enteritis and viral hepatitis. 

 ?The most vulnerable group comprises those who drink too much water at eateries, or fruit juices or other drinks to keep themselves cool. They are most likely to contract water-borne diseases,? said Tarun Mandal, another physician. 

 ?Many people are down with throat infection or heat fever, caused by the consumption of too much chilled aerated drink,? he added.

 Muscle cramps and water-borne diseases apart, the heat and humidity over the past few days have alarmed doctors about the spread of skin diseases. The hospitals have already started receiving such cases. 

 Dermatologists have advised people to use plenty of soap while bathing to beat the risk of contracting skin ailments.

 ?It is quite common to have boils and rashes in summer, so people have to be careful about the heat and try and stay in the shade as long as possible,? said dermatologist Subrata Malakar. 

 Fungal infections, skin rashes and boils in the groin, armpits and on the back are the most common skin ailments during the season.

 Doctors said those who spend most of the time outdoors and do not get an opportunity to have a proper bath at the end of the day?s work are the ones most likely to get affected by the heat bug.

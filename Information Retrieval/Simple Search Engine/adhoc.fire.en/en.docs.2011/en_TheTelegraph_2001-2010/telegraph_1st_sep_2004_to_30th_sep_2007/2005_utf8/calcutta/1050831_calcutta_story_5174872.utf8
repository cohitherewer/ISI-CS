 Screen the eye to set sight right

 - Calcutta kids have highest incidence of vision problems, reveals survey

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta tops a list of cities with growing eye problems among children. A recently-concluded survey, conducted at the behest of the Union health ministry, has revealed that vitamin A deficiency ? the most common reason for eye problems in children ? is highest in Calcutta and the adjacent districts, second only to Bhopal, in Madhya Pradesh.

 Worried at the findings and World Health Organisation warnings that most eye problems among children, if not detected early, can lead to reduced vision and even blindness, the state government, along with Lions Club International, has embarked upon a Rs 25-lakh project to screen the eyes of over a lakh children in Calcutta alone. It will recommend remedial measures as well.

 The programme is meant to dig deeper into the national survey findings and find out how vitamin A deficiencies, along with refractive errors and pollution-related problems, are responsible for poor eyesight among the children of Calcutta, more than in any other city. 

 ?In the next six months, we will cover most city schools. Our focus is to reduce cases of childhood blindness. Survey findings seem to indicate that children are not taking care of their eyes very well and parents need to learn about it,? said Divyesh Shah, city-based eye surgeon, who is coordinating the project.

 The national survey report findings put Calcutta just behind Bhopal, followed by cities like Lucknow, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chandigarh, among others, where the screening test was carried out. ?What is significant from the survey is that vitamin A deficiency was found to be a major reason for eye problems in Bengal and we have to find out why this is the case,? added coordinator Shah.

 Worried at the extent of the problem among children, the Centre has decided to make efforts to prevent childhood blindness as its priority area in the programme ?Vision 2020: The Right to Sight?.

 Apart from vitamin A, uncorrected refractive errors, including high myopia and hyperopia, were found to be the other major reasons for poor eyesight, the survey revealed.

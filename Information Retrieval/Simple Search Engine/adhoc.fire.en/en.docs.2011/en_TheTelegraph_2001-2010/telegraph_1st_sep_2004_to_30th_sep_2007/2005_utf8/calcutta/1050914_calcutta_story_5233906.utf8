 Parents heap charges on school head

 A STAFF REPORTER

 September 6, 10.30 am. Students of Class X had just started writing their mock math test, when the acting principal came into the room and reportedly accused them of whispering amongst themselves. When the culprits were asked to identify themselves, no one stood up to be counted. The entire class was made to stand through the day.

 September 6, 8.30 am. The students were still standing, 10 hours since they were hauled up. One of the students fainted due to exhaustion and hunger. All students were allegedly threatened that they would not be allowed to appear for the ICSE exams?

 Ever since, the Class X students of Augustine?s Public School, in Howrah?s Ramrajatala, have been going to school, giving their attendance and coming back home. No classes, no preparations for their Board exams.

 Acting principal A.K. Augustine, against whom the students and their guardians have levelled the allegations, refused to speak to reporters in the school on Tuesday..

 ?She threatened the class she would ensure that all students failed their practical exams, and so would not be eligible to write their ICSE in March 2006,? said the father of one of the students. There were also complaints from guardians of corporal punishment meted out to students.

 ?Our children?s future is in jeopardy. We don?t know what to do, with just a few months to go for the Class X exams,? cried some anguished parents, after petitioning the school authorities to restore normalcy and enable the students to resume regular classes.

 In a petition to the ICSE council, the parents have alleged that there are ?no qualified maths and physics teachers?, as the previous ones were dismissed ?on flimsy grounds? a few months ago.

 Students are being kept ?locked in the school from 8.30 am to 9 pm? because some of them were found to be taking private tuition. 

 ?The school calls this special classes. This has been going on for the past three months,? says the letter addressed to R. Wilson, deputy secretary, Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, New Delhi.

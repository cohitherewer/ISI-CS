 Foundry trade in a flounder

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Sanat Dhara, a manufacturer of electrical machines in Howrah?s Balitikuri, sits in his room in stunned disbelief. Staring at him from the desk in front is a provisional electricity bill for over Rs 5 lakh. The only way to meet the expense, he thinks, is to sell off the factory.

 Dhara is not alone. The owners of around 4,500 industrial units in Balitikuri, spread over 16 sq km, claim they are all in a similar crisis. According to Balitikuri Manufacturers and Traders Association (BMTA), the state power board often raids the units and slaps ?false? theft charges on them.

 ?The units here do not consume power uniformly throughout the year. Consumption depends on production. But the board takes the highest bill as the yardstick and accuses us of theft whenever we consume less. We are forced to pay huge amounts as fine,? said BMTA vice-president Nemai Roy.

 Power cuts and fluctuations in the supply are the other problems in this industrial estate. 

 ?Fluctuations hamper production and damage our machines,? said R.K. Patra, owner of an induction heat treatment plant in Balitikuri. He claimed a loss of around Rs 2.5 lakh a year for power cuts and other disruptions in the supply.

 The BMTA further alleged that though the Electricity Act, 2003, stipulates that the electricity board will pay compensation for power cuts, the units have never received any relief even for major losses. 

 ?We incur huge losses because of stoppage of work during power cuts, but the board has never cleared any compensation package,? said BMTA president Samar Mukherjee.

 The board thinks the problems are not unique to Balitikuri. ?Fluctuations and power cuts happen across the state,? said S. Mukherjee, divisional manager (Howrah) of the board.

 As for compensation, he said it was beyond his jurisdiction. Denying the allegation that the board slaps false theft charges, he said: ?Theft is rife in that area.?

 The unit-owners also have a series of complaints against the Howrah Municipal Corporation. 

 ?During monsoon, our business suffers setbacks as the roads get waterlogged. Also, our clients can?t communicate with us as there is no postal address for our units,? said Mukherjee.

 Mayor Gopal Mukherjee said a committee had been set up to allot ?holding numbers? to the establishments. ?The authorities are also focussing on roads,? he added.

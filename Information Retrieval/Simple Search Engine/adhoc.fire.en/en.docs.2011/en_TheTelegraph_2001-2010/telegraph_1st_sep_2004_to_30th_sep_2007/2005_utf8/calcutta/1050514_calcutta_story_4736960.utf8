 Garment seller shot on platform

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 28-year-old garment dealer, Md Sabir, was shot on crowded Kankinara railway platform, north of the city, at 8.30 am on Friday when he was about to board a train for Sealdah. The bleeding man was first taken to a local hospital and from there to RG Kar Medical College where he succumbed to his injuries. 

 Minutes after the news spread, angry locals put up a roadblock in Ghoshpara at Naihati throwing traffic out of gear for more than one-and-a-half hours. The blockade was lifted after a contingent of police from Jagaddal and Titagarh reached the spot and resorted to a mild lathicharge. Till late evening, police were yet to identify the youths who had opened fire on Md Sabir. The GRP has initiated a case of murder in Naihati. 

 ?Two youths opened two rounds of fire leaving Sabir injured in his left thigh and chest. It is still not clear as to why they attacked him,? said Nabarun Bhattacharya, superintendent of railway police, Sealdah.

 Witnesses said Sabir carrying a bag was waiting on the northern flank of the platform along with the Sealdah-bound crowd. As the Down Naihati local pulled into the platform and passengers surged forward, two youths jumped out of the train and on spotting Sabir, opened fire.

 ?The sudden sound of firing rattled us. As we turned back, we saw two youths running down the platform, as Sabir lay in a pool of blood. He gasped for breath as the train moved out. Some of the passengers, who were in front of him got off the train, picked him up and started screaming for help,? said Gopal Nashkar, a tea-stall owner on the platform.

 Panic gripped commuters as they heard the sound of firing and the screams for help. Some started running down the platform, others jumped off and climbed on to the platform on the opposite side. 

 Alarmed at the cries for help, some railway cabin staff and two GRP constables rushed out and lent a helping hand to those who were carrying Sabir. After offering him some water, they called a car and took the profusely bleeding man to Bhatpara hospital. Doctors immediately put him on a drip and after dressing his wounds admitted him to the ICU. As his condition continued to deteriorate, Sabir was shifted to the RG Kar Medical College.

 Local CPM leaders believe that Sabir was a victim of the growing political rivalry in the area.

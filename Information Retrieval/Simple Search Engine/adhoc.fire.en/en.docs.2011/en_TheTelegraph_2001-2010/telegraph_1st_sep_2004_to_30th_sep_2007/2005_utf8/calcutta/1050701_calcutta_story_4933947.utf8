Lake brake on cars

 Rabindra Sarobar: Walk in now, don?t drive. A Telegraph picture

 To ensure that no one slips into the Lakes on wheels, two new gates, each almost 12 ft high, are being put up on the eastern and western ends of Rabindra Sarobar. The pillars have already been constructed and if things go by schedule, the wrought-iron gates will start keeping out cars, and even motorcycles, from as early as next week. 

 The eastern gate will come up near the Indian Life-Saving Society (Anderson Club) and the western one near Calcutta Rowing Club.

 ?The drop gates will soon be done away with. The new gates will protect the stretch of greenery from vehicles. The purpose is to ensure that the place is not spoilt and the visitors are undisturbed,? explained Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south). 

 The gates will be manned by policemen throughout the day. Officers of Lake police station have been specifically briefed about the deployment of personnel. Additional policemen have been sought for the purpose.

 At present, about 50 policemen, including officers, guard the Lakes in shifts to keep the waterbody and the area adjoining it free from pollution and to prevent crime. Officers said the men are regularly briefed on how to go about their duty without infringing on the liberty of the visitors.

 ?People can visit the Lakes any time. And there is no reason for them to feel insecure. We hope that the policemen, in uniform and plainclothes, are able to instil a sense of confidence among visitors,? said Sukumar Chakrabarty, officer-in-charge of Lake police station. 

 Besides setting up new gates and constructing a wall around the Lakes, police have decided to beef up presence in other parks, including Vivekananda Park, frequented by youths after sunset.

 For the first time, the cops have written to Calcutta Improvement Trust, asking its officials to immediately put in place lighting systems in parks so that people can venture there after dark.

 At the same time, couples visiting the parks have been asked to abstain from activities that are likely to offend other visitors, police officers said.

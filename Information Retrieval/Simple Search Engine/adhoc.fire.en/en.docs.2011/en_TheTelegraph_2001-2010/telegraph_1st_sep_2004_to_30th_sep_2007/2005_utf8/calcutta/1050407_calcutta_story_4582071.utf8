 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 They were among the first troupes to introduce contemporary dance in Calcutta. And after a run of over a decade, they are ready to re-invent themselves. 

 Abstract dance forms have been the primary focus of Sapphire but now it is time to go classical with their latest production ? Rituranga: A Symphony of Seasons. 

 According to founder member Sudarshan Chakra-borty, abstract dance forms are often bereft of ?grace and beauty?, hence the need for the change in their repertoire.

 ?We?ve had audiences complaining about our productions being too harsh, so we?ve made an attempt to create something more artistic. And Tagore?s works were the obvious choice,? said Sudarshan. 

 The current production by the troupe that showcases the seasons of India is set to music composed by Dr Partho Ghosh in western symphony style. Thus, while the show is interspersed with readings from Tagore?s prose and poetry, one can expect to see his works in a new avatar. 

 ?There isn?t the usual song list that one relates to Rituranga, for one. In fact, we are not performing to Rabindrasangeet at all,? explained Sudarshan. 

 Having premiered in Delhi at the LTG auditorium as part of Uday Shankar Dance Festival on March 29, the troupe is travelling to Kerala to perform at another cultural show. 

 The opening of the production in Calcutta has been timed to coincide with Tagore?s birth anniversary on May 9. Though the production went down well with the Delhi audience, Sudarshan is tense about Calcutta?s reaction to the novel rendition of Tagore?s work. ?Purists will shower brickbats, but Tagore himself advocated innovation and we?re hoping people will like it,? said Sudarshan.

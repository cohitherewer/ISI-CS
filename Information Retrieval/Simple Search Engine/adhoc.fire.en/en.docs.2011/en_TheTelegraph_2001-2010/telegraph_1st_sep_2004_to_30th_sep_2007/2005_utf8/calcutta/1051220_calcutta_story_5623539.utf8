 She loves Shah Rukh Khan, has written a book on Yash Chopra, and is fascinated by India?s popular culture. Rachel Dwyer, a London-based university lecturer, is now ready with her best of Bollywood list.

 Dwyer?s 100 Bollywood Films, part of a series taken up by British Film Institute, was released in the city by British Council in association with Taj Bengal on Friday.

 ?The first 50 films are pretty easy to choose. It gets harder with the next 50. Then you have to narrow it down to one director or actor. But there were always three to four things that settled the choice,? says the Briton who has been to Calcutta twice before.

 Her criteria cover films with big box-office collections to those that had the best performance of an actor or the best dialogues, or films that influenced other films. Though her personal preferences rule the list, Dwyer did go around asking friends for their views.

 ?It?s surprising but many of my friends in their late 20s went for the films of Gulzar and Hrishikesh Mukherjee,? says Dwyer, who picks Amar Akbar Anthony, Mughal-e-Azam, Waqt, Pyaasa and Sholay as her favourite five.

 Dwyer?s brush with Bollywood began almost a decade ago when, as a researcher on Indian culture, she started watching Hindi films to learn the language.

 And though Satyajit Ray films she says ?were my kind of films?, Dwyer soon got hooked to Hindi mainstream movies. 

 ?Bollywood takes a lot from outside but transforms it into something else. It gets Indianised. The films may not reflect society but they question society,? feels the reader in Indian studies and cinema at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the UK. 

 For her, the Fifties and the Seventies were Bollywood?s best decades. ?I enjoyed Bimal Roy and Mehboob Khan,? she adds.

 Yash Chopra, on whom Dwyer has penned a book, is her favourite director. ?It?s amazing when anybody can remain popular for 50 years, given that he comes from an ordinary background and saw the Partition. And he also never quite followed or set trends? It?s quite a challenge because he doesn?t say much,? she explains. Dwyer lives in Mumbai at least a couple of months a year and ?it?s more like home now?.

 Next up is yet another book on Bollywood. This time the focus is on the emotions in the songs and lyrics. And closest to her heart are the ones penned by Sahir Ludhianvi.

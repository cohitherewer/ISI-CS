 New den for pretty petals

 RIDDHIMA SEAL

 Theres one more addition to the array of new-age florists in Calcutta. Ferns Petals, the national flower boutique chain, launched its second outlet in the city last month, after the successful run of the first one on Loudon Street.

 Housed inside City Centre, this 1,200 sq ft boutique wears the same look as the other outlets of the chain, countrywide.

 The first thing that catches your eye is the riot of colours. With a whole range of colourful fresh-cut flowers, unique floral arrangements, artificial and dry flowers, candles and diyas, the ambience is a treat to the eyes.

 Fresh focus

 If saying it with fresh flowers is your style, this section at Ferns Petals will spoil you for choice. Roses, gerberas, sunflowers, tulips? Arranged in unique ways make for quite a visual treat.

 The ones to look out for are Pink Magnificence, a bouquet of pink orchids and carnations done up with net and ribbon highlights, Jewels of the Sea, an elegant creation of white roses and petals with wireball supports, and Rose Wrap, cellophane-wrapped yellow roses clustered to form a bouquet.

 We also have a very extensive catalogue through which our customers can order the bouquet of their choice and that too sitting in any part of the country. The code numbers of our bouquets are the same all over, says Rajani Saraf, proprietor of the Salt Lake outlet.

 Prices of the bouquets in this section start from Rs 900.

 Fake it

 A variety of artificial and dried flowers complement the fresh selection. From lilies and roses to orchids and raspberry sticks, the choice is wide.

 At times, people want their bouquets to be a combination of both fresh and artificial flowers to enhance its beauty. We even get customers who want the entire arrangement done in dry and artificial flowers, says Rajani.

 A combination of olive branches with crystal flowers makes for an elegant arrangement and is a hot pick as wedding gift. The artificial flowers look so real that people often cant make out that they are false until pointed out, smiles Rajani.

 Add-ons

 Apart from floral arrangements, Ferns Petals offers a wide range of home decor knick-knacks, too.

 Scented candles and candle stands in innovative designs and vases in various shapes and sizes are the things to look out for.

 Made of ceramic and wood, the unique vases are priced between Rs 250 and Rs 800.

 The show-stealer, however, is a line of cane flower baskets from the house of JJ Valaya. Coming in different sizes, these baskets are ideal for flower arrangements at home.

 The store also houses some Feng Shui items like lucky bamboo shoots, jelly, pot pourries and pebbles.

 Our Feng Shui range also includes potted plants that can be watered and grown at home, adds Rajani. The Feng Shui items start as low as Rs 50.

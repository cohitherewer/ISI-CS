 Shivari is the newest addition to the list of designer outlets mushrooming in the city. Opened on Wednesday, the store at 2, Hungerford Street is home to an exclusive collection of saris, unstitched dress material and bags.

 Saris these days are quite popular with the young brigade, too, who like to flaunt these six metres of sheer grace on special occasions. Ive designed keeping in mind all age groups, says designer Sunita Goenka, proprietor of Shivari. The designs and motifs are traditional as well as contemporary, she adds. 

 From sensuous georgettes and chiffons to sober cottons, the range of saris is extensive. They come in myriad hues of pink, peach, blue, red, yellow and green. Adorned with intricate embroidery, zardosi, sequins, stones, mirrorwork, gota and kundan, the collection offers buys for all occasions.

 The concept of wedding drapes has undergone a sea change. So, apart from the traditional reds and pinks, I have bridal saris in citrines, blues and a host of other interesting shades, says Sunita.

 For those with an eye for sober finery, there are authentic Kashmiri saris on offer.

 The extensive range of unstitched fabrics for salwar suits and kurtis is a medley of simple and heavily-worked designs. My aim is to provide complete dressing solutions and hence I am contemplating keeping suits with western cuts too, says Sunita.

 Leather bags in black and brown are smart and trendy. Pretty purses and batuas in pastels, ash, red and pink are show-stealers, too.

 The saris start at Rs 495 and go up to a few thousand. The bags are priced between Rs 345 and Rs 1,050.

 Fabric focus

 Mens wear brand Grasim Suitings kick-started its Puja promotion in Bengal on Tuesday afternoon with a new range and a new contest.

 Grasim, part of the Aditya Birla group, introduced a new range of fabric under the label Sofeel.

 The softest range of fabric from the Grasim stable, it consists of light to medium fabrics in different blends of polyster, viscose and modal.

 The fabric is available in soft subtle checks and bold classic designs in different twills, weaves and shades.

 And then there is the Win In Style offer. On till October 31 at all Grasim outlets in the state, the offer enables buyers to win assured gifts on every purchase of Rs 600 and more. 

 Up for grabs are VIP Alfa suitcases, Ganesh idols, wallets, pens, a Bajaj Pulsar motorbike and a Maruti Swift car.

 The sales in this region are at an annual high during this time of the year. So we decided to start this campaign that would widen our customer base, says R.K. Choudhary, vice-president (sales) of Grasim.

 Idol effect

 Indian Idol participant Harish Moyal enthralled the crowd at the Punjab Club at a recent performance.

 For the members of the club, it was a welcome break from routine club nights. Moyal kept the crowd on its feet till midnight, churning out movie numbers on request.

 Its an overwhelming experience to perform in front of such a crowd. I did not even win the contest, but the appreciation I received from the people was amazing. I never expected Indian Idol to take me to such heights, smiled Moyal. 

 The budding singer was a big hit with the young ones in particular as he belted out popular Bollywood numbers like Tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam, Dil to pagal hai, Hare krishna, hare ram and Dil deewana.

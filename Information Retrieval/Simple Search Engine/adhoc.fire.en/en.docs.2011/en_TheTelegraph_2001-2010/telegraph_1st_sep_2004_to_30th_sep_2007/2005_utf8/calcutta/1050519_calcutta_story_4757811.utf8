The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Practice spells success

 - Metro speaks to some high scorers after the results

Mainak Bose

Vivekananda Mission

 I was expecting good marks but I had not imagined it would be this good. Right now, I feel like I am walking on air. The key to cracking the examinations was concentrating on what I was studying, even though I did not spend too much time with books. In fact, I took tuitions only in English, physics, chemistry and mathematics. As far as preparations for the examinations are concerned, I started with the assimilation process mid-December and was through in February. I think taking school tests seriously gave me the edge. That apart, I put a lot of emphasis on written work. I wrote out whatever I was studying, and practised diagrams over and over again. I want to pursue bio-science.

 It feels really good to be a school topper, especially since I had not expected it. However, the marks I have scored in the different subjects have been as per my expectations. The support of my parents, schoolteachers and particularly my principal helped me achieve this as I had never put in more than seven to eight hours a day, even during the peak period of preparation. I used to study for four to five hours on an average throughout the year. I also took tuitions in all the science subjects. I plan to study engineering.

Priyadarshini Banerjee

Modern High School

95 per cent (ICSE)

 I?m thrilled and plan to take up engineering. I?d expected more marks in English, though. Even my science aggregate could have been better, had I scored more in physics. I only put in extra effort during the last two months and at the most, could pack in seven to eight hours of studies a day. I think it is the mock examinations that I took at my tutorial which helped, as the practice made me more confident. I took tuitions in only mathematics and Bengali.?

Pratiti Mondal

Vivekananda Mission 

96.2 per cent (ICSE)

 I am very happy as I have achieved this result entirely on my own, without taking tuition in any subject. I did not even take coaching from my parents. It was entirely due to the support of my school and the encouragement of my teachers that I was able to prepare well. I will now pursue science in the same school and want to become a mechanical engineer.

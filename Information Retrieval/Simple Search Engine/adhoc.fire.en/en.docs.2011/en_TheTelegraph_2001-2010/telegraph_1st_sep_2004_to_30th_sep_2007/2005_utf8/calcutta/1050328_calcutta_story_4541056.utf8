The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Low-cost carrier adds two flights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 India?s first low-cost carrier, Air Deccan, launched its daily flight to Hyderabad and Delhi from Calcutta on Sunday, bringing the total up to three flights a day. 

 The airline kicked off its Calcutta operations with a daily flight to Chennai from December 10. 

 On March 27, Air Deccan launched 10 new flights, including Calcutta-Hyderabad, Hyderabad-Calcutta, Calcutta-Delhi and Delhi-Calcutta. 

 There are also new flights between Bangalore and Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi and Mumbai and Delhi. Two new Airbus A320s have also been added to the fleet of aircraft. 

 The Calcutta-Delhi flight will depart at 10.25 am, while the Calcutta-Hyderabad flight will leave the city at 7 pm. 

 The Calcutta-Chennai flight is at 6.45 pm. 

 The Delhi aircraft has a capacity of 180 seats, while the Hyderabad carrier has seating capacity of about 100.

 By mid-April, the airline hopes to expand its services in the eastern region by connecting Calcutta with cities like Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Aizawl, Agartala, Dibrugarh and Bagdogra. 

 ?We are also working on starting flights from Calcutta to Jamshedpur,? says John K. Kuruvilla, chief revenue officer and head, commercial, Air Deccan. ?Then, we hope to start flights to Mumbai from Calcutta.?

 The airline has been expanding its operations in the north and the south. ?We only have that many aircraft, so we have to increase the number of flights gradually,? adds Kuruvilla. 

 ?The flights have been doing very well in Calcutta. The daily average capacity on the Chennai flight has been about 85 per cent. For the two new flights, bookings have been open for about a week. On the Delhi flight, over 150 seats were booked. We expect the Hyderabad flight to do well, too, but the Delhi flight will be very popular,? sums up Kuruvilla.

 Air Deccan is one of three airlines augmenting their operations this month-end. 

 Singapore Airlines and Indian Airlines, too, added new flights, including in Calcutta, starting this weekend.

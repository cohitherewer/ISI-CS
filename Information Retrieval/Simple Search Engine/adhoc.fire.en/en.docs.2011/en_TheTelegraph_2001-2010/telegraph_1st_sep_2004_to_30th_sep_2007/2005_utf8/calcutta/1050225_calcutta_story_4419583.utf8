Get set

Hair tattoos are the latest innovative twist to the 

art of body design, says Ipsita Deb

Move over body painting and nail art. It?s time to 

dress your tresses with myriad designs in various shapes, sizes and hues. And 

we?re not talking about highlighting and extensions anymore. For, the latest innovation 

on the traditional body art form of tattoos has now gone to the head!

Having done the rounds of international ramps, especially 

in Italy, and fashion scenes abroad, hair tattoos are finally here.

Says Marina of Marina Beauty Parlour in Beckbagan: 

?These are just perfect to accessorise your hair if you want to make a flashy 

style statement on a night out. They are extremely colourful and creative and 

can really make you stand out. In fact, you can tone down all other accessories 

and sport tattoos on a simple hairdo.?

She demonstrates a few designs on model Bindu?s hair...

Chic shapes

Hair tattoos experiment with the crimping technique 

to come up with a variety of options for your tresses. Specially-moulded design 

blocks in different shapes and sizes are placed on hot plates of the required 

hair-styling equipment (in this case Professional Style Mega 12). The hot plate 

is then placed on the hair and kept for a minimum of 15 minutes for the desired 

effect. For more elaborate designs, however, the time taken may go up to 45 minutes.

Design diary

Since the tattoos are made with pre-moulded design 

blocks, you cannot demand any shape that catches your fancy. You have to choose 

from the present set of shape plates. This wouldn?t give you a reason to complain, 

however, since the variety on offer is pretty wide. 

Stars, dolphins, honeycombs, waves and wriggles are 

just a few of them. There are other patterns resembling hair clips, too. Bindu?s 

hair has been decorated with patterns called Treccia, Rombi, Delfino, Stars, Catena 

and Ondulante. These are Latin and Greek names for particular designs. For instance, 

Delfino symbolises dolphin and Rombi stands for a rhombus shape. 

?Going to a party with hair tattoos on would really 

help you make a fashion statement. I like the wriggles best since these blend 

with the hair more naturally than distinct shapes,? feels Bindu.

Wash away

Usually, the tattoos last only till the next hair-wash 

and so you can sport one to a party at night and go to office with perfectly sober 

tresses the next morning. 

While simple crimping tattoos last till one wash, 

more lasting impressions can be created with some special gels and the heat-patter 

technique. These ensure that the tattoos withstand a few hair-washes. 

While the tattoos can be applied on any hair type, 

pre-coloured hair makes for deeper impressions.

?The tattoos look better on pre-coloured hair. Hair 

dyed in lighter shades make them more prominent. But the only thing to watch out 

here is that the colour of the hair should not be in contrast to the hues used 

in the tattoos,? adds Marina. 

Cool contrasts

The designs are most commonly done with glitter spray 

in single colours. But Marina is also experimenting with multiple-colour tattoos. 

These use contrasting colours in one design and hence the effect is very jazzy. 

The shades can range from bold blues, pinks and purples 

to more subtle earthy tones like chestnut brown or burgundy.

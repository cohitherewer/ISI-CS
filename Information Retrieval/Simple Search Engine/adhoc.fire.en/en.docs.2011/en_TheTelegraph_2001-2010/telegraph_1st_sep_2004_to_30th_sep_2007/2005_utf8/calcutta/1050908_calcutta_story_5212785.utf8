 Stop those scissors

 A collective will to mirror reality through the camera emerged during the five-day festival of documentary films held by Vikalp Kolkata at Max Mueller Bhavan last week. Starting August 31, the Films for Freedom festival screened the works of some 25 film-makers from across India.

 Writer-activist Arundhati Roy lent her voice to the cause on the concluding evening. ?If you look at the issues in Kashmir and the Northeast, so little of the news is reaching us. There?s a kind of censorship that exists in print and audio-visual media. There?s a kind of resistance to hearing the other point of view? Market is also a big censor. Success has seduced several writers,? said the Booker prize-winning author who has been involved with a wide range of social issues.

 ?The Booker coincided with the rise of BJP, communal politics and nationalism. I also found myself in a position where I did have a space (in the media) and I thought it would be a tremendous waste to fritter it away,? Arundhati told Metro.

 Sanjay Kak, documentary film-maker and founder member of Vikalp, who shared the dais with Arundhati on Sunday, said: ?All the vital portions of the content which they feel would hurt their interests are deleted. Once a film-maker thinks of the censor certificate, he starts imposing a sort of self-censorship. Even the national awards are only open to films with a censor certificate and we are against this system.?

 Apart from Kak, Films for Freedom screened the works of Amar Kanwar, Ranjan Palit, Deepa Dhanraj, Vasudha Joshi, Suravi Sharma, Pankaj Gupta, Sameera Jain, Serna Dastur, Ranu Ghosh, Nilanjan Bhattacharya, Nidhi Tuli and Sabu Dewan, among others.

 The festival was put together by the city wing of Vikalp, a movement of film-makers against censorship. 

 Vikalp was formed in 2004 when the Mumbai International Film Festival refused to screen several films due to their anti-establishment content.

 Several other film-makers withdrew their entries from the festival in protest and together floated Vikalp, which then arranged an alternative festival with around 50 films. Most of the rejected films addressed politically controversial themes, such as the Gujarat riots, Narmada agitation, communalism, Dalit rights and corruption in the government. 

 Films dealing with alternative sexuality, sex workers and similar anti-establishment themes were also rejected. Since then, the campaign against censorship has involved over 275 documentary film-makers from across the country.

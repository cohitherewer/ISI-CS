 Rare surgery gifts sight to young man

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Taking an eye out of the socket, preserving it outside and then suturing it back in ? sounds like a scene from a Bollywood horror film? This was actually a part of a rare surgery performed in the city recently to save a young man from going blind.

 When Amlan Barua, 23, first complained of diminishing vision in his right eye, his family members dismissed it as a common problem. When the eyesight deteriorated further, despite efforts by local doctors, the Baruas panicked.

 An asthmatic with occasionally severe breathing problems, Amlan discovered to his dismay that his eyeball had gradually started protruding from its socket.

 ?The problem became so acute that people started feeling scared on seeing me,? recounted Amlan.

 When several doctors failed to provide a remedy, the youth approached specialists at Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI). He was advised to undergo an MRI of the brain and the eye.

 The reports did not reveal much, so the doctors decided to conduct a CT scan of the eye. A large tumour, which was growing, was detected behind the right eyeball. The optic nerve was entangled with the tumour, making its removal extremely difficult.

 ?It was a complicated case. Considering the young age of the patient, we were determined to save his eyesight at any cost,? said neurosurgeon G.K. Prusthy. After lengthy discussions, the doctors decided to carry out the procedure of removing the tumour under an operating microscope. 

 ?The fact that Amlan was asthmatic did not help, but we had decided to go ahead with the surgery,? added Prusthy.

 The team of doctors, comprising S. Basthulan, Soumitra Roy, Abhijit Ghosh and Prusthy, cut open a bone to reach the eye. They had to be extremely careful, as even a minor error would have caused haemorrhage, leading to permanent blindness. 

 The nerves and muscles were then dissected under the operating microscope. The optic nerve, central retinal artery and the smaller arteries supplying blood to the eye were taken out and preserved.

 Once the tumour was removed, the eye was sutured back and the bone was replaced with a titanium plate. Finally, the wound was closed. Amlan came to his senses soon after.

 The bandage over Amlan?s eye was removed on Wednesday. He has got back his vision and will be ready to return home in a few days? time.

 ?I have seldom come across such a complicated case. Hopefully, Amlan will recover quickly and resume his normal activities,? neurosurgeon Prusthy signed off.

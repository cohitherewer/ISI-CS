The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Double order for muggle mania 

Potter in plenty

 - 500 copies sold a month before launch, book biz braces for Potter aplenty

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 July 16, 10 am: the magic moment. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will finally be let loose. And Calcutta?s marketing muggles are making the most of the biggest day of the year in the book business.

 More than a month before the sixth and penultimate chapter of J.K. Rowling?s phenomenon is released, over 500 copies have already been sold in town ? at least on paper. 

 Bookstores across the city are taking pre-orders, luring customers with discounts and freebies, while globally, HBP ? as it is being called ? has been at the top of Amazon?s bestseller list for months.

 Penguin, Bloomsbury?s distributors in India, is not taking any chances. ?Last time, we underestimated the demand for the book in Calcutta,? confesses Nirmalya Roychoudhury, head of Penguin?s eastern region operations. 

 In June 2003, 6,000 copies of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix came to town in the first lot. This time, the quota has almost doubled to 10,000 copies (with more coming in through middlemen).

 ?In India, if a book sells 5,000 copies, it is considered a bestseller, as opposed to the huge numbers in the West,? points out Rajiv Choudhry of Oxford Bookstore. That puts in perspective the 140,000 HBPs Penguin India has ordered, expected to last a month.

 ?Last time, we ordered around 60,000 books. We want to avoid the second order crunch with this title,? explains P.M. Sukumar, senior vice-president, sales and marketing, Penguin India. Cashing in as quick as possible is priority, with piracy cutting into as much as ?30 to 40 per cent? of sales for a book like HBP.

 A Rs 895 price tag for the 672-page hardback ? the most expensive of the six ? cannot deter Potterheads. Landmark still expects to sell its near-1,000-copy first consignment in a week. ?We have already booked 125 copies and expect at least 200 pre-orders by release date,? reveals Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark, which is offering a 15 per cent discount and a magic trick with every pre-booking.

 Another 200 copies would be sold on Day I, and book sales across the board are expected to go up on July 16.

 Those who have missed the first books are now catching up, with a sales spurt witnessed for back-list titles, too.

 Oxford Bookstore, also slashing the cover price by 15 per cent, has registered ?substantial pre-bookings? as well.

 Crossword, offering a Rs 100-voucher, has 300 pre-orders. ?We have a number of corporate bookings, with companies giving the book away as gifts. Everyone wants to cash in on the craze,? says Crossword?s Sidhartha Pansari.

 Even smaller players are hoping to sell around 500 copies. ?I have received many calls from customers eager for copies,? adds Ashok Barman, partner, Family Book Shop.

 If Barman had morning-walkers knocking on his Park Street door at 6 am on release day in 2003, pleading for the book (?they were afraid they wouldn?t get breakfast without it?), Jatia has to consistently turn down requests for a copy the night before release (?everyone wants to be the first to read it?).

 With every shop in town stocking Potter, the only problem for retailers is of plenty. In-store promotions and events are being planned weeks ahead, to woo fans away from the competition.

 For now, Harry can concentrate all his powers on quelling Voldemort. The sales will take care of themselves.

 A brush with divinity

 The doctrines laid down in the Vedanta hold the key to understanding the laws of the universe. In it can be found the thoughts and ideas that gave birth to philosophy and religion. Deeply influenced by the Vedanta and other spiritual treatises, Dipankar Mani attempts to portray in his art themes related to the mysteries of nature, the secrets of creation and annihilation, and the supreme, undying power of the spirit; subjects that have obsessed scientists and great thinkers for centuries. Titled Murtis-Mantras-Tantras, the present series emphasises cosmic forces, supernatural powers, spiritualism and divinity, represented through images of gods and goddesses, mainly depicted in their calm, benign aspects. The exhibition, showcasing Mani?s works based on Vedantic lores, is being held to commemorate the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, whose teachings inspired the artist to explore truths about mankind?s role in the universal scheme of things.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Dipankar Mani

 When: Till today, 3 pm - 8 pm

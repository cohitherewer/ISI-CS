The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Welcome kick of life for soccer

 - Marketing leader ties up with IFA for innovative and saleable solutions

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Better training and match venues, the right crowd, coaching clinics by biggies, neighbourhood clubs to cheer, live TV and vital corporate blessings? Calcutta football is set to get a welcome kick of life.

 TotalSportsAsia, the continent?s ?leading integrated sports marketing company?, has tied up with the Indian Football Association (IFA) as its exclusive marketing agent for four years, with the promise to deliver ?innovative, creative and rewarding solutions? to make the city?s soccer saleable.

 ?We are looking to leverage Bengal?s passion for the game and work in a tiered manner with the parent body (IFA) for complete uplift of the sport across the state,? Navneet Sharma, managing director, TotalSportsAsia, India amp; Middle East, told Metro on Friday.

 Spectator segmentation is the first move planned in Stage I. ?The idea is to lure Calcutta?s middle-income mass and college students to the soccer grounds, with interesting connects like sponsored SMS contests and Friday night floodlit ties,? said Sharma. The company, headquartered in Kuala Lumpur and having offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Mumbai, has brought in TVS Futsal Championships Kolkata 2005, the ?first-ever official five-a-side soccer meet in the country?, with IFA. It plans to market the IFA Shield and the Super Division League.

 TotalSportsAsia has also signed up Bhaichung Bhutia for an exclusive representation deal for two years, with further rights for another two years. ?We will control all commercial aspects, like endorsements, and also determine the club he turns out for,? said Ardeshir Jeejeebhoy, regional manager, business development, Indian subcontinent.

 Jeejeebhoy felt the innumerable stadiums in Bengal?s small towns and districts, coupled with the ?inherent knowledge of the game? and the buoyant economic outlook made this the ideal pilot pad for the soccer surge.

 While talks are on with various channels for live TV partnership, TotalSportsAsia is also getting a mobile content partner for IFA. ?Fans can, for instance, download a streaming video of Bhaichung?s goals or get the day?s scorelines on their cell phones,? explained Sharma.

 In Stage II, TotalSportsAsia will look at infrastructure ? sponsors to invest in dedicated floodlit home venues for a few clubs. ?This would create neighbourhood club connect, like in Europe,? he added.

 Second-string teams from Bayern Munich are slated to come for matches, clinics and appearances, and efforts are on to bring in ?B or C outfits of top English Premier League sides?. For this, TotalSportsAsia hopes to cash in on its exclusive tie-up with Ladbrokes.com, bookmaking partners to Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool.

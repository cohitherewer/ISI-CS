 Computer degree at self-fund college

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah?s only self-financing college, Sree Agrasain College, is set to introduce a course in computer science. The initiative from its seven-member trust is in keeping with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s concept of colleges self-funding their activities.

 ?There are private colleges where subjects relating to engineering are taught. But this is the first time that a private college in Howrah, under Calcutta University, will offer a three-year degree course in computer science under B.Sc honours,? said Manohar Prasad Shroff, chairperson of Sree Agrasain College in Liluah.

 On December 8, when the trust approached Calcutta University for a nod to offer bachelors? degrees in arts and commerce, the authorities okayed the computer course only.

 ?In keeping with the state government?s self-financing scheme, we were requested to teach subjects in keeping with the demands of the time,? said Shroff, also former president of the Howrah Chamber of Commerce and Industries. 

 Keeping in mind the models being followed in Maharashtra, Delhi and Karnataka, the Left Front government decided to log on to the self-financing college scheme last year, granting colleges affiliation but no direct grant. 

 The authorities said more than Rs 2 crore was spent in building the infrastructure of the college. 

 It will start off with the B.Sc in computer science, but degree courses like Ll.B and MBA, job-oriented and professional by nature, will also be taught in the future. 

 Shroff said every year, the college will be able to take in 30 students for B.Sc. But this year, as the session is over, only five students have been admitted. ?Perhaps this is the first time in Howrah that a college has only five students,? he added.

 Managerial skills to run church schools

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 A programme will shortly be taken up to impart managerial and administrative skills to the principals of nearly 200 missionary schools across Bengal, in view of the demands of the changing times as well as the government move to set up a body to regulate the working of schools affiliated to ICSE and CBSE, senior church officers said on Wednesday. 

 ?Running the schools has become a difficult task,? said Father Peter Arulraj, inspector of schools under the Calcutta Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, who had convened a meeting last week of the school principals to expose them to emerging issues. 

 ?Our priests and nuns, especially the young ones who have been tasked with running some of the country?s finest institutions, must learn to acknowledge that the times are changing and that they must acquire certain skills to run their organisations,? he said. The meeting was hosted by the Calcutta Diocese.

 Among the schools run by the Roman Catholic Church are the St Xavier?s and Loreto chains, Don Bosco group, St Joseph?s, St Mary?s, Holy Child and St Lawrence. The heads of nearly 70 schools of an estimated 200 (approximate student strength 250,000) visited Calcutta last week to acquaint themselves with the Church?s take on issues like admission and recruitment, syllabi, relations with the governing boards, student power and academic pressures. 

 The programme, according to Church officers, will seek to equip the principals with skills required to strike a balance between the vision and the philosophy that guided the schools in the first place and the competitive, technology-driven environment they are working in, with the government and the various pressure groups keeping a watch on them.

 ?We have felt the need for such a programme because we increasingly find our heads caught in a complex situation,? said Father Faustine Brance, a senior officer. ?Today, the head must know how to deal with a legal dispute, especially in view of the fact that some guardians and school employees go to court on the flimsiest grounds.? 

 The programme was envisaged as realisation dawned that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s regime will crack the whip once the regulatory body gets into action. 

 ?The watchdog body is a certainty,? said J.K. Sen, principal, Julien Day School (Ganganagar), who is also general secretary, Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools. ?We must know how to act within the framework to be introduced by the government.?

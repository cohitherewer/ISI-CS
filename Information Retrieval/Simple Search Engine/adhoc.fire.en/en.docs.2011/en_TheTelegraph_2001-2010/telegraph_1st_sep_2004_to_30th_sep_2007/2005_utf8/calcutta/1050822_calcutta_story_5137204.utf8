 New rule need for policy shift

Dinesh Chandra Poddar: There are many illegal constructions in the Karunamoyee housing estate. They cause infrastructural problems. Garbage chokes the sewer lines, which are interconnected. The lines need to be separated but the municipality is not helping us. Also, civic amenities are not provided inside the complex. Isn?t the area public property?

 To provide civic amenities inside the complex we have to think about amendment of rules. Other housing estates are also facing a similar problem. We have to think about it.

 Let me explain something: we approve plans and the residents pay the taxes, but that doesn?t make it our responsibility to maintain the area within the complex. Even then, we repair the roads and the drainage system inside.

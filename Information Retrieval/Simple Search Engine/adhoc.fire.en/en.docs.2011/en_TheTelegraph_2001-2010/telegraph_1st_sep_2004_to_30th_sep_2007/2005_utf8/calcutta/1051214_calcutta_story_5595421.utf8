The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Why don?t all footpaths in the city have railings? That would automatically prevent people from stepping off the pavement now and then. Those who have a habit of walking along the road and crossing the road through the gaps in the railings will gradually mend their ways. Railings will also prevent frequent road accidents because of careless pedestrians.

 Recently, my mother, aged 74 and physically challenged, was knocked down by an autorickshaw while she was walking down Marquis Street, opposite St Anthony?s church. She received serious injuries. The driver fled with the vehicle before anybody could take down its registration number. Autorickshaws should not be allowed to enter the narrow Marquis Street. Even if they do, they shouldn?t be moving at such high speed.

 The banks of Hooghly have been cleaned along a stretch of Strand Road from Babughat to Fairlie Place. A garden has been created and the otherwise omnipresent garbage dump cleared. This has completely changed the face of the riverfront in the area. However, the pavement-dwellers still dirty the river bank. The Calcutta Port Trust should set up free toilets along the stretch and maintain them properly.

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Hooghly.

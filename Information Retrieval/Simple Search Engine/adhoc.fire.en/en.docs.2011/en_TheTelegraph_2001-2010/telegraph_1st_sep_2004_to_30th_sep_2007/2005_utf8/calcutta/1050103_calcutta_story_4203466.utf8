The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Many traffic signals in the city are not functioning properly. They confuse 

both the drivers and the pedestrians and may result in accidents. The defunct 

traffic lights at Hazra Road-SP Mukherjee Road crossing is an example. 

 Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road. 

 Many students from the mofussils study in Calcutta. Most do not have relatives 

or friends here to stay with and they face much difficulty due to the lack of 

proper hostels. Many big colleges have discontinued lodging facilities, while 

in others the hostels are occupied by unauthorised persons. The authorities should 

build and maintain more hostels as the number of seats in many colleges have also 

gone up over the years. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 The local sub-divisional hospital in Uluberia dumps all the unclaimed bodies 

from its morgue on the banks of the river. As a result, people living nearby suffer 

the nauseating stench emitted from the rotting bodies. This practice may give 

rise to a serious epidemic. The state health ministry should look into the matter.

 The tree enclosures in front of the Bata outlet on Shakespeare Sarani and in 

the Puddapukur area are filled with garbage. Also, the streetlights on the roads 

south of Elgin Road and Sarat Bose Road are not lit till late into the evening.

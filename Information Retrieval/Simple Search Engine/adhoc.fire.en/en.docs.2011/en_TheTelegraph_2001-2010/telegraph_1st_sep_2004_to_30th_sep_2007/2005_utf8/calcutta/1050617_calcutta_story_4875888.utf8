 Rendezvous with a poet

 Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture, in association with Sahitya Akademi, hosts Kavisandhi, a poetry reading session featuring Jayanta Mahapatra, who reads from his own compositions. A forum for reputed poets who have already carved a niche for themselves, this programme is specially designed to offer poets a platform for direct interaction with a discerning audience. A writer of English poetry and, perhaps, India?s most celebrated living poet, Mahapatra has gained global eminence by virtue of his several volumes of verse that have been compiled in some of the world?s best-known anthologies of poetry. In his poems, Mahapatra examines the world around him, the feelings of common people, their burdens and struggles for survival, and society?s response to the actions of its components. This evening, the poet reads out selections from some of his most recent works, followed by an informal discussion with the audience on subjects related to his poetry and his role as a poet. Pankaj Saha will read out the Bengali translation of some of Mahapatra?s poems.

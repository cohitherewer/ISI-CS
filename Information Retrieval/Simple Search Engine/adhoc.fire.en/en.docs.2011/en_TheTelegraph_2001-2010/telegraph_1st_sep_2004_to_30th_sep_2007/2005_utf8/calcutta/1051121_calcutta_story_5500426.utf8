 Squatter duo deserts baby

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Fear of being evicted from their shanty along Rabindra Sarobar led 28-year-old Pratima to abandon her baby on the pavement at Lake Market after a tiff with her husband. 

 And now, she will have to go through a long-drawn-out process to establish the child?s identity, filing a plea in court and facing a DNA test.

 Pratima and her husband Bapi Maity were returning home to Gobindapur rail colony last week from Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, where she had had her delivery. But Pratima told her husband that she would stay at a relative?s home till Bapi made an alternative arrangement. 

 ?I cannot play with my son?s life. There could be violence any moment,? Pratima told her husband in front of Lake Market.

 Bapi, who is a daily wage-earner, told his wife he could not afford to move out and that she should continue to live with his family. But Pratima was determined to move out. ?Well, then you take the responsibility of your son,? she said, before putting the baby on the pavement.

 They walked off in two opposite directions, leaving behind the newborn on the pavement. ?It was evening and other pedestrians failed to notice the baby because he was wrapped up. After a few minutes, two persons heard him cry.

 Police took the baby to Seva Pratishthan because he was ailing and got in touch with an NGO. ?The baby was weak and suffering from breathing problems. Now, he is recovering,? said Geeta V. Krishnan, director of the NGO that is treating the baby.

 After a few hours, the couple went to the police station and said they wanted their baby back. ?But the policemen at the station were not sure whether the couple was the real parents. If they want their son back, they will have to prove their parenthood through a DNA test,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Pratima is now moving from pillar to post. The baby will be handed over to the Child Welfare Committee and sent to Sukanya, a state-run refuge centre for destitutes.

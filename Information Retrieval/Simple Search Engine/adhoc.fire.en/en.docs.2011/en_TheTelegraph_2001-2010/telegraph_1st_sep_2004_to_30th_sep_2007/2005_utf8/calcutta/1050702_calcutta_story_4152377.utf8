 Protein boost for immune system

 - SCHOOL PROD ON DIETARY HABITS

 MITA MUKHERJEE AND BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Diets low on protein and high on junk food may lead to weakening of the immune system of children, resulting in them easily falling prey to diseases such as measles, chicken pox and even temporary memory loss.

 The authorities of an English-medium school in Park Circus summoned the parents of its students from Class I to IV last week, after noticing that most of them were bringing pastries, patties and bhujia for lunch, instead of wholesome meals.

 The medical fraternity blames the ?growing junk food culture? for the rise in health problems. ?The over-consumption of a non-protein diet is causing harm, including inadequate growth and even memory loss. So, we are asking parents to ensure children have a protein-rich diet, either vegetarian or non-vegetarian,? said physician Susovan Haldar.

 At South Point School, nearly 25 children have fallen victim to measles and chicken pox over the past few weeks. With similar outbreaks being reported regularly, the authorities are now warning parents about the consequences of a non-protein diet, specially when examinations are round the corner. In the past few years, the authorities were forced to organise separate examinations for affected students.

 ?Considering the family background of our students, we cannot say the parents are not in a position to afford nutritious food. But they need to be more cautious about the kind of food they give their children, specially in their tiffin boxes. Parents must help their children develop good food habits, else they might not have the immunity to counter even seasonal diseases,? said school administrator Siddhartha Mitra.

 Eleven children from a class of Rajasthan Vidya Mandir were once down with measles and chicken pox. Following a close examination, the teachers found that none of them was given a protein diet at home. ?We are regularly prodding mothers to give their wards nutritious food every day,? said principal Kajori Mukherjee. 

 Paediatricians say animal proteins help form protein-building amino acids. Vegetarian food items, too, contain enough protein, but parents tend to ignore them.

 ?We are very concerned with the way children are being allowed to ignore protein diet. I have been advising parents who are vegetarians to give lots of milk, soya products and a diet of rice and dal to their children,? said Jayanta Ray, paediatrician at Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Centre.

 The authorities of many schools feel the need for extensive awareness campaigns among the students and the parents. ?We are not only preparing guidelines on the kind of food students should not be allowed to eat, but have also asked our teachers to focus on the issue in the guardian?s meetings,? said C.R. Gasper, principal of St Augustine Day schools. 

 A. Bansria, headmistress of Assembly of God Church School (junior section), said the institution had opened an in-house clinic to detect what was going wrong with the food habits of the children.

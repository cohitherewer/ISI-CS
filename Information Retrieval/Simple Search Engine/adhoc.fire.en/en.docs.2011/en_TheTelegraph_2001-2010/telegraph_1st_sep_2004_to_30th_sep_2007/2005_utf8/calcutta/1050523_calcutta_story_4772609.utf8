 Not just boxed in a climate-controlled, insular space, but more of a town square, a destination, a ?people place?. That?s the way new-age shopping centres are evolving the world over and Calcutta has to fall in step to stay in sync, feels Ro Shroff, one of the most respected retail space designers in the world.

 Shroff, principal, Callison Architecture, Inc, Seattle, Washington, has spearheaded design solutions for some of the most iconic international shopping centres including the ones mentioned above, and stresses the need for a ?hybrid, mixed-use format? to be sustainable.

 ?Over the past five years, the retail industry has matured everywhere, and the original American concept of an inward-looking shopping space has become antiquated. With a rethink on what today?s shopping environment needs to be, focus has shifted to a mixed bag of entertainment, lifestyle, F amp;B ? a total experience,? says the Callison chief.

 According to Shroff, even in Calcutta, retail as a separate entity won?t be viable any more. He predicts that the upcoming city shopping centres would borrow both from the typically vertical Southeast Asia model and the now-sprawling US style to leapfrog and achieve a hybrid format.

 The sustainable model is a combo of both inside and outside spaces, he points out, referring to Manila?s Ayala Center Greenbelt as a prototype most suited to Calcutta. ?In a city that offers its 10 million people little refuge from dense urban life, Ayala Center Greenbelt celebrates its precious green space,? Shroff says, defining the development as a ?meeting point of Times Square and Central Park?.

 That?s the effect created by Callison when masterplanning Ayala?s retail-entertainment-office-residential-hotel-museum concoction in the heart of one of the world?s most dense commercial districts. ?The whole idea is to make the place more enticing and have people linger, so that there?s more impulse buying.? 

 Callison, which has designed the Suwon Gateway Plaza in Suwon, Korea, The Grand Gateway in Shanghai, China, and is also providing inputs for Unitech?s nine-anchor mega mall, The Great India Place in Noida, could create something in Calcutta too, with a reconnoitre planned soon.

 So, what should be the ideal product-mix of a new-age shopping centre? Fashion and apparel, lots of entertainment and F amp;B in the shape of food courts, caf?s and fine dining, easy ingress and egress, strategically placed cinema theatres, lifestyle components like books and music and of course, a hypermart.

 ?Architecturally, the new-age spaces are more layered and nuanced, with a lot of tensile structures, shading and ?jumbotrons? (large-screen TVs), live concerts and open-air art forms. Even if these places are visually somewhat chaotic, they create a vibrant environment,? says Shroff.

 The greater the exterior orientation, lesser the common area maintenance charges, too. The Seattle firm, which has also created the high-profile Square One Powerhouse Mississauga, Ontario, Canada and the Continent Centre, Abu Dhabi, believes every retail centre is ?a community in which each component is an opportunity to connect with people?. The approach is an integrated one, affecting everything, from strategic positioning to tenant planning to environmental graphics.

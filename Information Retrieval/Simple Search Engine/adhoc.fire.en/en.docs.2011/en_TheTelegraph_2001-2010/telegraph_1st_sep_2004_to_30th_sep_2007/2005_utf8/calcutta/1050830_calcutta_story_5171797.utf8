 A chase, a slash, a bullet

 - Youth murdered in crowded lane, killer trio walks free

 A STAFF REPORTER

A dramatic chase in daylight ended in the murder of a youth on a crowded street in Watgunge on Monday afternoon.

 A gang of three, brandishing firearms and sharp weapons, ran after 28-year-old Mohammad Akram down Nazir Lane, slashed him and then pumped a bullet into his head from point-blank range. 

 With witnesses refusing to react, the assailants walked away scot-free.

 ?It was Shibu, a local extortionist, who led the attack on Akram, a local criminal, with the help of two accomplices. The killing appears to be the fallout of a gang rivalry,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Around 2.10 pm, Akram and three friends were playing cards on the pavement of Nazir Lane, when he spotted Shibu and two others approaching them from Michael Madhusudan Dutta Street, said an officer of Watgunge police station.

 ?Akram started running towards the Hemchandra Street end of Nazir Lane, with Shibu and his associates in pursuit,? he added. ?The four cut their way through pedestrians till Shibu and gang finally managed to pin Akram down.?

 As Akram slumped to the ground, one of Shibu?s accomplices attacked him with a razor. ?Then, Shibu put his revolver to Akram?s temple and pulled the trigger,? said a witness.

 As the pedestrians fled, the assassins walked away through the Hemchandra Street end of the lane.

 Tracing the gang rivalry, Ajey Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (port division), said Akram had attacked ganglord Kana Mastan two years ago. Mastan had escaped, with the bullet grazing his ear. He, police believe, could have ordered his henchman Shibu to eliminate Akram.

 ?We are raiding all possible hideouts and other areas. The neighbouring police stations have also been alerted,? said Ranade.

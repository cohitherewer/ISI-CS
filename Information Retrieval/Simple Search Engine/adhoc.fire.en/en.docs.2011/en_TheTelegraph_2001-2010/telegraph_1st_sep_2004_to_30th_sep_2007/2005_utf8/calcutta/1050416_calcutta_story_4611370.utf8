The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 There is a vast open-air water reservoir made of concrete just behind the Bengal 

Chemical factory, in Kankurgachhi. Two big pipes fill the tank located off EM 

Bypass. Most of the slum dwellers in the locality use the vicinity of the water 

tank as an open-air toilet and also bathe in the reservoir water. It has been 

noticed that a few lungi-clad men dip and fill dirty plastic cans at the 

tank. They then carry the 5 l-10 l cans in cycle vans and sell it as soft water 

in Salt Lake area. Salt Lake residents use it for drinking and cooking purposes. 

The unscrupulous vendors charge Rs 2 and Rs 5 for each 5 l and 10 l cans, respectively. 

Calcutta Municipal Corporation should take strict measures against them.

 I am using the Rs 499 scheme of BSNL?s internet service for the past one year. 

Thanks to the recent BSNL employees? strike, the service was disrupted though 

I had paid the previous month?s dues. With such shoddy service, BSNL would soon 

lose its customer base to private operators.

 A colleague of mine, a senior IAS officer, has an account with UTI Bank?s Gariahat branch. On April 11, around 9.50 am, he left his briefcase with important documents in the car and went inside the bank. The driver was present inside the car. When he returned after 10 minutes, he found the briefcase missing. The driver revealed that a stranger had drawn his attention to a few Rs 10 currency notes on the ground next to the car. The driver picked up the money assuming it might have fallen out of his boss?s wallet. In the meantime, the stranger decamped with the briefcase. The question is how such petty crimes are flourishing right under the nose of Gariahat and Lake police.

 Metro Railways gives discounts for 40 and 80 rides. However, if Metro authorities 

also give discounts on return tickets or other multiple ride tickets it would 

attract more commuters. This way it will save on clerical work and will also get 

committed commuters.

 The footpath along SN Banerjee Road up to Calcutta Boys School is not negotiable 

for elderly citizens in the mornings. The snack shops, meat vendors, tea stalls, 

barbers and a garbage dump take up much of the space. Schoolchildren and bus passengers 

also face great difficulty because of the filthy condition of the footpath.

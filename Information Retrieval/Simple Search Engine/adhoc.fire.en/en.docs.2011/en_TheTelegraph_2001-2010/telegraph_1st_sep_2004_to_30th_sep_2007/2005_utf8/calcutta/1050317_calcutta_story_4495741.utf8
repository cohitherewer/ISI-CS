 Water of life for Botanics lakes

 After almost a decade, the Botanical Garden authorities have initiated measures to resuscitate its lake system, comprising 24 lakes. The waterbody network flows through the 273-acre garden and is connected with the Hooghly through two sluice gates.

 The lakes are considered the main source of water for the 12,000 trees and shrubs, belonging to 1,400 species, in the garden. For the past 10 years, water flow to the lakes from the Hooghly has stopped.

 The garden authorities have sought the help of the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) to solve the problem. A high-level meeting between the CPT and the garden authorities at Shibpur, Howrah, was held on March 8 to find out how the lakes could be protected. 

 There had been a constant flow of fresh water into the lakes from the Hooghly. But in the past decade, water flow in the lakes has virtually stopped because of massive siltation in the river near the two sluice gates, said Botanical Survey of India (BSI) joint director G.S. Giri on Wednesday.

 ?Water in the lakes has become stagnant and we are finding it difficult to draw it from the river to maintain a regular flow in our lakes. We have urged the CPT authorities to help us get water from the river,? Giri said.

 Special secretary of the Union ministry of forest and environment Suresh Chanda and joint secretary of the department Veena Upadhaya attended the high-level meeting held between the BSI and the CPT. Chairman of CPT Anup Chanda, too, was present.

 Anup Chanda told Metro on Wednesday that they were exploring the possibilities of injecting fresh water into the lakes. ?We are examining how we can supply water in the garden lakes. We can conduct dredging operations at the two points where the sluice gates are located,? Chanda said.

 Giri said the second master plan for the garden was being prepared. The first master plan was drafted by Sir George King, founder of the BSI in 1875. ?We need to update the plan, as it was made 130 years ago and requires some modification,? Giri explained.

 A BSI official claimed that no major renovation work had been done after 1787, when the garden was laid out by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Kyd. It was landscaped by Sir George King in 1872. 

 It is learnt that the BSI in Delhi has recently cleared some modernisation proposals for the garden.

 Court pat for settlers? gesture

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The squatters along the railway tracks between Ballygunge and Tollygunge stations would bear part of the expenditure if they are provided alternative shelters under Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana, their counsel told the high court on Friday.

 ?The Centre allots funds for the Yojana and the state governments make matching grants. But if my clients are provided accommodation, they will bear part of the cost,? advocate Sukhendu Sekhar Roy told the court. 

 Appreciating the proposal, the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly said: ?File an affidavit stating your stand, and we will consider it.? 

 Uttam Majumdar, representing the Eastern Railway, stated that 2,738 families were living in shanties along the tracks between Ballygunge and Tollygunge.

 Petitioner Subhas Dutta, an environment activist, expressed satisfaction with the efforts of the railway authorities and the state government to prevent the squatters from using the lake waters. 

 The matter will be heard next on June 14.

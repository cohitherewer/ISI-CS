 PET PASSION 

Nilanjanaa

My husband (Jisshu Sengupta) and I have a strong karmic 

connection with animals, dogs in particular! And if the events of the past two 

weeks are anything to go by, I am on the right track.

Just another evening, we were in Vivekananda Park, 

having phuchka, when Pintu, a security guard from the government quarters 

across, informed us about an injured dog, Moti. And thus begins our sojourn. Moti 

had been hit by a speeding car a week ago. Though there were no external injuries, 

she was in excruciating pain and could not stand. We immediately took her to Moitri 

Veterinary Clinic. My first visit to Moitri left me spellbound. In AC comfort, 

soft music and friendly attendants, our canine-feline friends (both pedigrees 

and pariahs) were in a state of sheer bliss. Pain forgotten, no whining, only 

purrs galore.

The X-ray revealed Moti had two fractured limbs and 

an injury to the spine. Her legs would be in a cast and she would be completely 

immobile for the next 21 days. A couple of shots later, armed with medicines, 

Moti was out of Moitri and back home ? to the government quarters compound.

At 11 pm, I was amazed to see the concerned committee 

members waiting for Moti with milk and biscuits. In the days that followed, I 

was moved beyond words to see Pintu sharing his simple meals of dal-bhaat 

with Moti, cleaning her after she relieved herself and even powder her to prevent 

bed sores. All this, only to see Moti back on her feet again.

Next evening, another location. Tripti Fast Food, 

in Lake Terrace. Another candidate: a puppy we named Bandit Queen (BQ). Only two 

months old, she had also been hit by a speeding car. She had been badly maggoted 

and dehydrated for 10 days. The final result was total recovery but only after 

numerous trips to Moitri, on-spot saline administrations (by Laltu, an attendant 

at Moitri) and a diet of idlis and milk.

The boys of Tripti have actually made a makeshift 

home for BQ, complete with newspapers and towels. If you happen to pass by, you 

can catch them walking her, talking proudly about her miraculous recovery. Every 

case is not a success story, but Laltu treats the most hopeless and irreversible 

cases with optimism and hope. Alongside the animal and its owner, he fights the 

deadliest of diseases, constantly offering words of encouragement and hope. He 

feeds 40 dogs every night and then attends to dogs on the streets that need help.

Why are they my heroes? Because they go that extra 

mile. They do the unimaginable, the unexpected, most of the time going beyond 

the call of duty.

Pintu has one eye on the building gate and the other 

on Moti. Between taking orders from customers, the boys at Tripti step out and 

give BQ her share of idli. Laltu will attend to an animal in distress, 

24x7.

The next time you are at Vivekananda Park, please 

do say a word of encouragement to Pintu or tell Laltu (at Moitri) how you wish 

you could do the stuff he does. The smiles on their faces will be well worth your 

while.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Aural boon for kids

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a rare surgery performed in a city hospital, cochlea implants have saved two minor boys from leading a life without hearing anything.

 Three-and-a-half year old Tupur Das, a Salt Lake resident, was born with a congenital defect, which resulted in his turning deaf. ?When he came to me, he could not hear anything. I advised his parents to allow him to undergo a cochlea implant,? ENT surgeon Dulal Bose told Metro.

 Similar was the problem faced by nine-year-old Deep Saha, a resident of Konnagar, in Hooghly. ?As Deep could not hear anything, his speech did not develop. It was a big challenge for us,? said Bose. 

 On Wednesday, both Deep and Tupur underwent the cochlea implant operation at Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre. Special electrodes were attached to the cochlea or the inner part of the ear of the two boys, connecting it with the brain stem. 

 Cochlea implant surgery is very expensive (around Rs 6 lakh) and is performed very rarely in Calcutta. Hundreds of children afflicted with hearing impairments do not get an opportunity to undergo the operation, as their parents fail to bear the expenses. 

 Children suffer loss of hearing because of several reasons, including neonatal jaundice, German measles, premature birth and low birth weight. Some of the factors, experts say, are also genetic. 

 ?Parents often fail to understand the problem and believe the child will be able to hear with aids. Once they realise the truth, the situation is beyond control,? Bose said. 

 The team that performed the operation at Peerless include ENT surgeon Bose, audiologist Somnath Mukherjee and a speech therapist. 

 ?It went off very well and both children should be able to hear without the help of any aid,? said Mukherjee.

 Immediately after the surgeries, the doctors decided to depute a speech therapist to ensure that the boys quickly pick up their language. 

 ?With time, the boys will be able to speak and behave like normal boys,? Mukherjee said. The therapy will continue for several weeks, primarily because it will take the boys a long time to first get accustomed to a new world of sounds and then learn the language. 

 He urged parents to immediately consult a doctor if they find their children having any problem in hearing. 

 ?Most parents try out hundreds of things that do not work at all. They continue with the aids in the hope that one day their children will be able to hear, but that day, unfortunately, never comes,? Mukherjee added.

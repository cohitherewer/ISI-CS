 Priya wants CID probe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sixty hours after the killing of Howrah-based promoter and Youth Congress functionary Mohammad Akram Ansari in Pilkhana, in Howrah?s Golabari area, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi is gearing up to demand a Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probe into the murder.

 On Friday afternoon, Das Munshi visited Ansari?s home and met his widow Najma Begum. 

 The minister assured her he would draw chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s attention to the police inaction and request him for a CID probe.

 ?Golabari police station has been sitting on the case and no arrest was made till Friday,? he said. Das Munshi expressed astonishment at the fact that the man was murdered within half a km of the police station. ?We want the police to net the criminals as soon as possible,? he added.

 Disagreeing with Das Munshi, district police superintendent Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya said: ?We have located the criminals. A team of officers will raid their possible hideouts and arrests will be made as early as possible.?

 Ansari had helped Calcutta police arrest some criminals wanted in a dacoity case a few months ago, which may have led to the revenge killing.

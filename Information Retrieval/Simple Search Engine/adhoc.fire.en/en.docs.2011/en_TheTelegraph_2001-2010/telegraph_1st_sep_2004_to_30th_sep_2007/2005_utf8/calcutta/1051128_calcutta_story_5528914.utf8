 Major portions of a two-storeyed building, which the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had declared ?dangerous and unsafe for use? more than 10 years ago, collapsed on Sunday, killing one woman and injuring two others.

 Parts of the building at 250, Vivekananda Road, in the Narkeldanga police station area, collapsed around 10 am. 

 Dipannita Ghosh, Molly Das and Anjana Mukherjee were injured. While Ghosh and Mukherjee were released after first-aid from a local nursing home, Das succumbed to her injuries at Medical College and Hospital in the evening. 

 At least four balconies and sunshades on the first and second floors of the dilapidated building, at the crossing of Vivekananda Road and Institution Street, collapsed.

 Witnesses said 35 people were trapped inside the building as parts of the staircase collapsed. As they shouted for help, local residents gathered around the building, trying to evacuate the trapped people. 

 ?I was washing clothes at a CMC tap, outside the house. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash. Looking up, I saw the balcony on the first floor, just over my head, was breaking loose. I tried to escape, but in vain. The balcony fell on me and I lost consciousness,? said Dipannita, shivering. 

 She was rushed to a nursing home, and was later released. She incurred serious eye injuries. ?I can?t see. It seems something is stuck inside my eyes,? she said.

 ?We pressed four fire tenders into action. About 35 people were evacuated with the help of ladders,? said Ayon Ghosh, sub-inspector, Maniktala fire station. 

 ?Sixteen tenants and three owners of the building lived in the house. The CMC had declared the building unsafe more than 10 years ago. But the tenants refused to leave,? said Pratap Mukherjee, one of the three owners of the building.

 ?We are demolishing the dangerous portions of the building. Later, the CMC will decide what to do with this house,? said a contractor.

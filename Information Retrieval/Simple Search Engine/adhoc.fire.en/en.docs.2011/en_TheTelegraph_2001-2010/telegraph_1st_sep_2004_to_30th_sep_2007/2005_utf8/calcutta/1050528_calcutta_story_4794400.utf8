 Results set to miss date

 - HS examiners struggle to meet court?s June 10 deadline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Till the other day, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government maintained it would comply with a Supreme Court directive and ensure publication of the results of Higher Secondary (HS) 2005 on or before June 10. But with less than a fortnight to go, its education officers appear to have given up.

 ?You can?t say we have given up. We are trying our best, but it seems that adhering to the June 10 deadline will be tough,? Gopa Dutta, president, West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, said on Friday.

 Senior education officers said work on publication of results was on at a measured pace because any haste, they feared, might lead to mistakes in tabulation and marksheets, resulting in litigation.

 ?We have been able to reduce the number of lawsuits. We don?t want them to recur,? an officer said. Traditionally, HS results are published late in July. Last year?s were announced on July 28.

 The Supreme Court directive had offered Bengal some leeway, as it was to be followed from 2006 only in this state. 

 The Bhattacharjee government, however, told the state Assembly that it would declare the HS results in 2005 in compliance with the Supreme Court directive for all other state boards, as well as the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination and the Central Board of Secondary Education.

 ?We still aim to declare the results on June 10. But we have no directive from the government on the deadline,? council president Dutta said.

 Thirteen days are left for the target date but sources close to the council revealed that many preliminary procedures for preparing the results are yet to be completed. 

 For instance, the process of evaluation of several thousand answer-scripts written in Hindi and Urdu is not complete. These scripts were distributed late for evaluation, as there was an acute shortage of examiners in Urdu and Hindi.

 This apart, many examiners on various other subjects have not yet sent their marks to the council. 

 Tabulation of marks ? a vital part of preparing the results ? can start only after the marks in all the subjects arrive from examiners.

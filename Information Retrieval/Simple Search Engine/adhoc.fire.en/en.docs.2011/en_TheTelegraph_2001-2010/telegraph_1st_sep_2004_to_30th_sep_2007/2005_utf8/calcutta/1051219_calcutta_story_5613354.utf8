 Frontier fare on the plate

 Charcoal, a North-West frontier cuisine restaurant, was launched with much fanfare at 66/2B Purna Das Road. The launch was attended by the celeb brigade comprising June, Nilanjana Chakraborty, Mamata Shankar with son Ratul, and others.

 The restaurant is broadly divided into six sections ? a concierge lounge, a buffet section, an exhibit kitchen, a private dining area, an executive dining zone and the family section. The d?cor is modern and minimalist with a strong ethnic dose.

 We want food connoisseurs to enjoy a taste of the smoking delights at Charcoal. The restaurant will fill the gap of authentic Dum Pukht style cuisine in south Calcutta, said Subrata Ghose Chaudhuri, about his latest offering after Krystal Chopsticks and Tero Parbon.

 The platter comprises starters like Dahi Ke Kebab, Mawa Mewa ki Seekh, Awadhi Machhli and Kakori Kebab, which give way to the main course ? a delicious spread of Lal Mirch Moorg, Gosht Reshmi Chap, Paneer Aur Hari Mirch Ka Do Piyaja, Dal Takhshila and much more. 

 These can be accompanied by Atish-e-Naar, Dum-e-Biranje, Makhni Taftan and Kurkure.

 For desserts, the chef recommends Jaan-e-Azam.

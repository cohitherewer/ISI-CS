 Lowdown on high-fliers

 After Chandni Bar and Satta, Madhur Bhandarkar had been looking for a subject. And it was at one of those filmi bashes that he had the brainwave of basing his next film on the high-fliers of society, and maybe scratch the surface to see what lay beneath all that gloss and polish. But the wide array of characters posed the biggest problem ? how does one tell the story, and whose story, for that matter? 

 ?There are people coming in from all walks of life ? fashion, films, business, NGOs. But I needed to do justice to all the characters and also have an emotional bond with them. I was aware that it shouldn?t be a caricature,? says Bhandarkar. 

 With that objective, he began scrounging for a pair of eyes that could take the place of an omniscient observer. ?One who had access to all? and so I found the journalist on the party beat.? 

 So, in walked Madhuri Sharma, hailing from Bangalore and now settled in Mumbai, reporting on the Page 3 people for a supplement. For the role, Bhandarkar wanted a girl ?who could walk the streets freely, or sit in a bus?. ?Konkona fitted the bill. I had liked her in Mr amp; Mrs Iyer and Konkona too liked my work in Chandni Bar. We clicked from day one,? says Bhandarkar.

 As for Konkona, getting into the skin of Madhuri was quite easy. ?In the film, I slowly get disillusioned with the life I lead and get sick of the lifestyle. But Page 3 is all about real people, about Madhuri?s private life and office politics. With both my parents having been in journalism, I have met several journalists. I didn?t have anybody particular in mind while doing the role,? she says.

 As for the two other ladies in the film, Sandhya Mridul fitted the bill as a Christian girl with lots of energy and vitality. And Tara Sharma plays the upcoming actress with a naive and fragile look.

 Bhandarkar has shot 50 per cent of the film on steadycam, specially the party scenes, for a feel of the restlessness, to catch people unaware as they moved, nibbled and gossiped. 

 ?So, editing too was very difficult,? says Bhandarkar. The party sequences were specially problematic, as he had to tackle a huge cast of around 40, getting them organised with their make-up, costumes and dialogues. 

 The director had even hosted a bash where several real-life party people dropped in for cameos on request. Some visible faces among all those who make fleeting appearances would be Soni Razdan, Suhasini Mulay, Dolly Thakore, Anju Mahendroo and some big biz boys.

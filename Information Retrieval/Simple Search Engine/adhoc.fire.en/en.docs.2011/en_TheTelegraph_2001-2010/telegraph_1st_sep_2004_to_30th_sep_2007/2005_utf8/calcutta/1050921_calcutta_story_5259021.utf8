 This Saturday, after Amitabh Bachchan has rounded off another episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati on STAR Plus, your screens will go black.

 So will STAR One, STAR Gold, STAR Utsav and Channel V? for all of 20 seconds. And then, in the darkness, you will hear Rani ?Michelle? Mukherjee?s voice: Aur isi andhere mein usne dekha roshni ka sapna?

 The Sanjay Leela Bhansali big-screen best, Black, is all set for its small-screen premiere on STAR Gold this Sunday.

 And the usually reticent director is quite upbeat about the satellite prospects of his film. ?It would be a great opportunity for everyone to experience the catharsis all over again,? Bhansali tells Metro from Mumbai.

 The film, released in February this year, enjoyed a great run at the multiplexes even if it didn?t find much favour at the less urban single-screen theatres. Bhansali, however, doesn?t agree. ?That?s completely wrong information,? he replies vehemently. ?In fact, the film did very well in places like Mysore, east Punjab and West Bengal. We all expected that it wouldn?t run for more than a week at such centres. But contrary to our expectations, Black did very well and ran for many weeks. It?s undoubtedly the best opening that I have had so far.?

 But wouldn?t the beautiful film, thanks to cinematographer Ravi Chandran and production designer Omung Kumar, lose its impact within 21-inch confines? Bhansali disagrees again. ?I think people have now got used to seeing big stars on the small screen and small stars on the big screen. It is finally the content that matters to them. If you look at the changing trend ? Page 3, Black and Iqbal have all done well ? it?s evident that people are just interested in the content. Even I love watching Devdas on television, every time it is shown.?

 Bhansali not only takes great pride in his cinema but also in the fact that stars shine the brightest on his canvas. ?It feels very, very good to hear people say that Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee did their best ever in my film,? says the man behind Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas.

 ?These days, you are considered to be incomplete if you are a director and you haven?t worked with Amitabh Bachchan. And he gave everything of himself to Black. He, Rani? all worked on their roles in the film. All the magic moments that you see, is due to their hard work and concentration.?

 So does the Bachchan fan in him really think that Black is the big man?s best screen work? ?I am extremely proud of his work in the film but whether it is his best ever is open to debate,? comes the answer, after a pause. ?He was extremely good and honest in Black. Personally, I like him best in Mili and Abhimaan. I know this sounds strange, but I really loved him in Hrishida?s (Hrishikesh Mukherjee) movies.?

 And then, the talk turns to the big one: Will Black make it to the Oscars? First-things-first, will Black be sent by India to the Academy Awards? After all, Hindi is not exactly the most-used language in the film. ?The official language of the submitting country must be the predominant language of the movie,? states an Oscar entry rule in the foreign film category.

 But Bhansali vaults the language barrier with ease: ?That is not an issue at all. If you ask me what is the language of Black, well, it?s sign language? All around the world, people have reacted to the universal language in the film. Most of Black is about signs and silence. And they do speak in Hindi. English is only there in patches.?

 So is he already eyeing a seat in Kodak Theatre, March 2006? ?See, every film India sends, there is going to be a debate as to was it the right film to send to the Oscars. These debates kill the film rather than encouraging its prospects. So I wouldn?t like to get into that. But I do believe that Black has great merits in terms of performances and technicality. More importantly, it is about an Indian reinterpreting the life of such a great international soul as Helen Keller.?

 Finally, is the Black man ready to talk about his next magnum opus? ?There are so many rumours in the media? Some publications sell space on just speculation. That is how they work. But I believe every film-maker has the right to unveil his next film whenever he wants to. And as of now, I am not ready.?

 We remain in the dark.

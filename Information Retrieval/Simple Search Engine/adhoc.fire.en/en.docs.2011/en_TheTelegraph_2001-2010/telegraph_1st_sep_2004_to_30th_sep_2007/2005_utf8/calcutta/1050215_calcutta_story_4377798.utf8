Touch of crystal class

Displaying your sparkling baubles in subtle 

settings is the new mantra in home decor, says Himika Chaudhuri

Lifestyle stores around town are flooded with a host 

of crystal showpieces ? from fingernail-sized hearts to replicas of humans, birds 

and animals. But even as you dish out the thousands to pick up these eternally 

elegant pieces, it?s time to rearrange the positions of your enviable crystal 

collection at home. 

Moving the limited edition piece of an international 

brand that you bought a couple of years ago from the centre table in the drawing 

room to a more humble haven seems to be the right thing to do. Crystals ? once 

a rage and still a style in home decor ? ought to be shown off in subdued settings, 

feel interior designers. 

Set it right

The most important aspect of owning a crystal piece, 

no matter how small or big, is to showcase it well. It would make little sense 

to buy a huge piece of crystal and place it amidst a clutter of other knick knacks. 

?A crystal placed on a glass rack with a focussed 

light shining over it accentuates the beauty of the piece,? says interior designer 

Manjari Sahay. Thus, corners in a room can be used effectively by putting up small 

glass racks and positioning the pieces stylishly on them. The reflection from 

a crystal piece placed under a light brightens the room. 

Soft style

Crystals, unless a special edition piece, ought to 

be placed in subtle settings and off-set with things like flowers and candles, 

emphasises Sahay. While the drawing room has been the all-time favourite venue 

for showcasing these pieces, the newer and now ?in? positioning options are side 

cabinets, bar tops and the study. The dining table bedecked by a crystal fruit 

bowl might also be considered. For a more jazzy and formal arrangement, crystal 

candle stands can also be coupled with fruit bowls. 

?Putting a sparkling decanter on the bar is a good 

way to include some crystal in your house,? says Sahay, who also advocates the 

use of a crystal bowl to hold floating candles in a cosy corner. Placing some 

tiny pieces at the base of a big table lamp could also be a favoured set-up. 

?Crystal birds and animals that people used to collect 

earlier are not so fashionable any longer,? says interior designer Anita Mansata. 

Light note

Picking up the once-popular animal figures might not 

be the smartest shopping idea, but it?s the heavy-on-the-pocket crystal lights 

that you should consider as the next home decor thing to pick up.

?Crystal lights are very fashionable and they are 

quite new to Calcutta. The lights come in various forms like chandeliers, reflectors, 

ceiling lights, optic fibre lights and swimming pool lights,? says Ballabh Daga 

of the Swarovski outlet in Forum. 

With price points starting at Rs 3,000 for ceiling 

lights, Rs 5,000 for reflectors and Rs 30,000 for chandeliers, the demand is definitely 

on the rise, say store owners. 

?These lights are special since they provide focussed 

lighting and are yet easy on the eye,? says Daga.

The optic fibre lights that create the effect of a 

star-studded sky if placed across the ceiling have a wire fitted with crystals 

that glow when turned on.

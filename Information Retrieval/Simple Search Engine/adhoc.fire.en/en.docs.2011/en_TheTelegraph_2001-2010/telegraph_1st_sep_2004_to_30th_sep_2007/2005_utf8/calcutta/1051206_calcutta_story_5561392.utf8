The Celsius may have started its wintry slide, but the GoodLife Talk Show on Sunday evening spread enough warmth at Tolly Residency in Bansdroni. The topic: Parenting and Child Care.

 The residents turned up in hordes to listen to the star guests of the evening ? actress Suchita Roy Choudhury, Dr Sushmita Chowdhury and moderator Rita Bhimani.

 The discussion, under the open December skies, was initiated by Rita Bhimani who asked the two other members on the dais how far television was influencing the life of children.

 Dr Chowdhury said: Its mostly a misconception when we think that kids watching television is all bad. The basic responsibility lies with parents to teach children what they should be watching and what they should not.

 She stressed the importance of growing up in a secure environment at home, which would ensure that no matter how much television the child watched, it would not affect him or her directly.

 From a very young age, they should be made to understand that things shown on television are far from reality. And here parents have to play a big role, she added.

 Suchita picked discipline as the determining factor. Proper communication with the child is also very important, but I believe at a tender age, there should be some amount of regulation. No matter how much parents explain, young minds may think otherwise. So, I think they should watch television, but for a regulated period of time, said the actress, whose recent run of roles includes Ek Je Achhe Konya and Chokher Bali.

 The Q amp;A session was then thrown open to the floor. A flurry of questions followed. Some parents wanted to know what could be done to deal with their children when there were guests at home and the young ones would do everything in the book and beyond to grab attention.

 Both the doctor and actress said: With interaction becoming so very limited, this is a common problem. Most children these days grow up in nuclear families and are used to getting maximum attention from their parents. Unlike our times, when most of us grew up in joint or large families and our parents hardly looked after us, things are really very different now. To overcome this problem, you have to let your child be.

 The joint prescription to tackle tantrums: take them out more often so that they get a chance to interact with more people; you will see that your child will get over this problem and understand that parents too need their space.

 A group of young fathers in the crowd then wanted to find out how to deal with the problems posed by single children. 

 I think there is a tendency on the part of parents to pamper excessively and give in to most of their demands, especially when it comes to single children. But parents should at times say no. Children should be made to realise that the world is not all rosy and that as they step out of the shelter of their homes, they will not get all that they want, said the actress, amidst loud applause.

 Questions then ranged from sibling rivalry to the insecurities of a girl child as she grows up, and they were all handled well by the guests.

 The final question of the session that stretched for over an hour: should children be taught the tit-for-tat policy?

 I think it would depend upon the situation. A parent should teach children to protect themselves against any odds, but at the same time teach them that violence is only the last resort, smiled Dr Chowdhury.

 Cancer care is big bucks

 - Hospitals set up dedicated units to tap Rs 50-cr market

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Courtesy the phenomenal cost of treating the disease, the city?s medicare market for cancer patients is worth a thumping Rs 50 crore, and counting. But the state lags behind in providing the latest treatment facilities.

 An estimated 70,000 cancer patients are registered across the state every year. Of them, more than 10,000 are in the city and its suburbs. 

 The existing treatment options are deplorable. The World Health Organisation recommends one radiotherapy unit per one million people. Going by this, West Bengal should have 80 units, as its population is over eight crore. But it has only 18. 

 In terms of beds available for cancer patients at various hospitals across the state, there is a crying need for introducing more. There are only around 350 dedicated cancer beds in the state.

 Every year, at least 2,500 people of the state go to Mumbai, Delhi or Chennai for advanced treatment. But more than 8,000 people go in for hi-tech treatment at various private hospitals here. Besides, about 2,000 cancer patients are from Bangladesh, making this a Rs 50-crore market. 

 With a large number of patients going out of the state for better treatment, hospitals are coming up with a slew of state-of-the-art cancer treatment facilities. Major players in private healthcare facilities are going to invest over Rs 200 crore in the bargain.

 City oncologists feel there is an urgent need for setting up dedicated oncology units, as the present facilities are hopelessly inadequate.

 ?It is impossible to provide proper treatment to cancer patients without organised support from the private healthcare sector with strong back-up facilities,? said Subir Ganguly, ex-head of the oncology department, Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. 

 Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute is setting up its second campus on a 10-acre plot in Rajarhat. The Centre is investing Rs 55 crore in this new project, work on which is scheduled to start this financial year. This unit will have sophisticated radiotherapy instruments, nuclear medicine and advanced facilities. 

 AMRI Hospitals will invest Rs 70 crore in its new AMRI Cancer Centre, a super-speciality oncology unit, which is nearly complete. 

 Ruby General Hospital has plans to set up a 350-bed unit for oncology and neurology on 2.5 acres adjacent to its building on EM Bypass.

 Peerless Hospitals and BK Roy Research Centre will start its 50-bed oncology unit with radiation facility, cancer surgery and chemotherapy.

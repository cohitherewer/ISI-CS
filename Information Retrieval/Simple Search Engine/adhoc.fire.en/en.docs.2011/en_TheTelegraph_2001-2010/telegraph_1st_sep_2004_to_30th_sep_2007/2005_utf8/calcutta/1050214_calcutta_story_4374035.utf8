 It's Your Birthday So...

 You 

are practical and do not yield to impulses. You are fair in your dealings and 

just in your behaviour. You have a strong sense of aesthetics and a sharp eye 

for beauty. You have a jolly nature and people like to have you around. . Close 

ones have extreme faith in you and depend on you in times of trouble. You do not 

have to try too hard to stand out. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Training focus at druggist seminar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Each year, thousands of Indians end up in hospital, fail to get better and spend more than they should because they do not take their medicines properly. Yet, importance is seldom accorded to pharmacists and their training. 

 Few are aware that pharmacists can do much more than hand out medicine parcels. They can recommend drugs, monitor their side-effects and offer counselling.

 These and other issues will be taken up at a conference in the Science City auditorium to mark the national pharmaceutical week. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra inaugurated the conference on Sunday.

 The theme this year is ?know your pharmacist?. There will be special focus on training of pharmacists.

 ?The government will try to make the life-saving drugs available to the masses at reasonable prices. The pharmacists should also take a lead in this matter,? Mishra stated during the inauguration.

 A spurt in the number of drugstores in the state has increased the importance of pharmacists. There are more than 2,000 drugstores in Bengal, handling over 35,000 prescriptions every day.

 ?Learning about pharmacology is like opening the door to a whole host of benefits. Unfortunately, most people do not know what a pharmacist does. He fills the prescription and makes sure that the people take the right medicines,? said Avijit Chakraborty, deputy drug controller and council member of Indian Pharmaceutical Association, which is organising the conference.

 He added: ?Pharmacists can recommend non-prescription medicines for aches and pains. People should expect a higher level of service from today?s pharmacists. Therefore, awareness is the motto of the conference.? 

 ?A pharmacist can help decrease healthcare costs by advising the patients about the right way to take medicines. Taking medicines properly is one of the best ways to decrease treatment costs,? continued Chakraborty.

 ?Many patients are not aware that some medicines have to be taken on an empty stomach, whereas some other drugs must only be administered after eating. There are even medicines that can only be taken with milk. Drugs affect a patient adversely, often without his knowledge. The treatment and recovery process is prolonged due to careless use of drugs,? he added.

 According to the experts, pharmacists are much more than mere dispensers of medicines. They can advise people about the right way to administer medicines, clear doubts and suggest ways to make the drugs more effective. 

 Pharmacists can also monitor glucose and blood pressure levels, and recommend tests.

 Not taking medicines properly can result in complications necessitating hospitalisation and even surgery. 

 There is also a lack of awareness about the regulatory board of pharmacists. The board keeps an eye on manufacture of drugs, their marketing, patent rights and issue of licence to medicine shops. 

 It is also responsible for ensuring that every druggist employs chemists to serve the people better. Most importantly, the board ensures that everyone gets medicine at affordable prices.

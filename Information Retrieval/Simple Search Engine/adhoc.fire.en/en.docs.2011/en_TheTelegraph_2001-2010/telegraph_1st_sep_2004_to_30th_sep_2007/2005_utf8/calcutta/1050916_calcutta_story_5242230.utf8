 Bangle boom

 To add to the glitter of the festive shopping spree, jewellery house Tanishq is hosting a Bangle Mela at its outlets in Kankurgachhi, Camac Street and Gariahat till September 21. Launched on September 12 at the Kankurgachhi showroom by Tollywood actress Locket Chatterjee, (picture by Rashbehari Das) the mela offers a collection of more than 1,000 exquisite designs. 

 An eclectic blend of traditional and contemporary patterns is the style mantra of the mela, which draws inspiration from the bounties of nature.

 Available in plain and studded gold, the wide range caters to women of various age groups.

 Introduced at the store for the first time, meenakari bangles from Rajasthan, and mantasas and polas from Bengal lend an ethnic look. Also on offer are specially-designed sankhas.

 To add to the fun, each purchase comes with an attractive jewellery box.

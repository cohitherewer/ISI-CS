 Evolving trends in art

 New waves of thoughts and ideas have swept across the art scene in Bengal in recent times. Artists today innovate and experiment with new mediums, forms and techniques, forging unique art objects, which, besides giving full vent to their creativity, open up a whole new world of artistic expression for others to follow. Presented by The ZEST Group, Versions, the ongoing exhibition of painti ngs and sculptures, represents an effort to mark the changing trends in art over the last few decades. The works on show serve as the steps of a journey that seeks to explore, compile and document the different spheres of visual language as articulated in theme, style and symbolism by artists of different generations. Besides members of ZEST, participating artists include Wasim Kapoor, Ashok Bhowmik, Aditya Basak, Shipra Bhattacharya, Samir Aich, Subrata Gangopadhyay (The Wings; picture above) and Chittravanu Mazumdar.

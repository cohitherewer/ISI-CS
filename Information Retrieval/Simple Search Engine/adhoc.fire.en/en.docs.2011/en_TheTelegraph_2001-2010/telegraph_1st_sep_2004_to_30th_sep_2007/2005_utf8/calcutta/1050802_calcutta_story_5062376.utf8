 The 165-year-old Great Eastern Hotel, now playing out its last innings, will shut its doors by September 30.

 Announcing this on Monday, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government said all dues to the employees would be settled by October 31, paving the way for the hotel?s privatisation.

 ?The hotel will be readied for handing over to the private party by the end of October. We will clear all dues relating to the early retirement scheme and the final settlement by then,? tourism secretary Tapan Barman said.

 With the thorny issue of retrenchment resolved, the government is now preparing to invite technical and commercial bids from the eight short-listed parties. They are ITC Group, Park Hotels, Inter Continental South West Asia, Bharat Hotels, Claridges Hotel Group, Unitech Group, Glycem Industries and Ramuk Scan AB (a Scandinavian company).

 The Sinclairs group and New Kenilworth opted out during the screening process.

 State government officials, along with government-appointed consultants, have completed the ?due diligence? process and the bidders? meeting, in course of which the parties concerned visited the hotel, examined its documents and property and discussed details of the handover.

 However, some issues are yet to be sorted out.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has recently informed the tourism department that it will not be the referral authority for any clearance relating to a change in the hotel?s structure. ?The CMC has stated that the hotel?s buyer will have to approach the heritage committee for that,? said secretary Barman.

 Government officials fear the buyer may not find it worthwhile to invest in a building, whose design and fa?ade have to be retained.

 ?The rooms are very large. No buyer will be able to make the hotel viable unless the rooms are redesigned. Also, the building?s life is nearing its end. Any buyer will want to break down the structure and rebuild it. But will the heritage committee allow such a move?? asked an official.

 When the eight bidders raised the question at a recent meeting, they were assured that the heritage panel would be convinced of the need to rebuild the structure. 

 ?The committee is not unreasonable and will surely understand the situation,? an official said.

 The government, however, has requested the bidders to retain the name ?Great Eastern? after the handover. ?The name still has a brand value and retaining it, as a prefix or suffix to the new name, will work in their (buyers?) favour. The bidders have agreed to the proposal,? an official said.

 On Wednesday, two bills will be tabled in the Assembly for transferring the hotel?s assets to a new company. The bills will be tabled by the tourism department and the public enterprises and industrial reconstruction department.

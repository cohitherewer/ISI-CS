 JU students break ranks, sit for exam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The fortnight-long class and semester examination boycott by students of the engineering and technology faculty of Jadavpur University (JU) suffered a blow on Thursday, with a section of final-year students appearing for their examinations on both campuses.

 ?Final-year students of the pharmacy department sat for their examinations today. There were around 35 of them,? said faculty of engineering and technology student?s union (Fetsu) general secretary Amit Chakraborty on Thursday.

 The semester examinations began on Monday, but no final-year student had sat for the tests on the JU main campus that day.

 Thursday?s examinations were for the first and the final-year students. Final-year students of three departments on the Salt Lake campus, too, took the examinations.

 However, not a single first-year student took the tests on either campus.

 Asked whether the students? agitation was petering out, Fetsu general secretary Chakraborty said: ?We had to consider the various pressures that the final-year students are subjected to. Many of them are one step away from starting their careers. We appreciate the fact that they have expressed solidarity with our movement, even though not all of them can afford to boycott the examinations.?

 There are 14 departments under the engineering and technology faculty on both campuses. Students of information technology, instrumentation and printing in Salt Lake, and pharmacy in Jadavpur, sat for the examination on Thursday.

 ?We had made all arrangements to hold the exams peacefully and also to ensure that not a single willing candidate was prevented from writing the tests,? said controller of examinations P.K. Sengupta.

 The security arrangements followed a directive from West Bengal Human Rights Commission chairman Shyamal Sen on Wednesday. Some guardians had sought Sen?s intervention to restore normalcy on the campus.

 The SFI on Thursday called for a quick resolution of the impasse.

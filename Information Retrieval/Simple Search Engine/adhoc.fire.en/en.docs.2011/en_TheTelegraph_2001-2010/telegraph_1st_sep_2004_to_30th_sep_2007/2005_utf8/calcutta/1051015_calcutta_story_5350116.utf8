The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Monitor for wetlands safeguard

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is setting up a Wetland Management Authority (WMA) to ensure proper conservation of the East Calcutta Wetlands.

 An ordinance to this effect will be issued later this month, a senior officer of the environment department told Metro on Friday.

 ?The WMA will start operations from November-end. In the beginning, it will take up projects for desiltation of the three major fish-feeding canals to bring more sewerage water into the region,? said the officer.

 But the main objective of the body would be to protect the wetlands by demarcating the 12,500-hectare area ? a Ramsar site ? into the four categories of waterbodies, agricultural land, Dhapa garbage farming area and human settlement area.

 In 2002, the East Calcutta Wetlands was recognised by Wetlands International as ?an international ecological site? under the Ramsar convention, which meant no land-use would be permissible in the waste-recycling region other than those supporting wetlands or wetlands-related practices.

 Repeated reports of encroachment and the deadlock over the Waterbodies Bill between the environment and fisheries departments have prompted the government to float a new agency for the conservation of wetlands. 

 Now, all new projects in the East Calcutta Wetlands will have to be cleared by the WMA. The action points include setting up a wetland interpretation centre at Bantala, a bird sanctuary on a 25-acre plot, a watch tower and a wetlands museum at Bantala.

 A technical committee comprising academicians, Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) officials and bio-diversity experts will review the proposals before forwarding them to the WMA.

 Asim Barman, environment secretary, said the principal secretaries of the environment, fisheries, irrigation, forest, urban development, land and land reforms and panchayat departments would be members of the WMA.

 It would also have representation from NGOs, fishermen?s associations, district administration, the Institute of Wetland Management and Ecological Design, the pollution control board, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

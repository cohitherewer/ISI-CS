 Mayor offer for childcare facility 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will extend all help if paediatricians decide to set up a hospital dedicated to childcare, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has announced. 

 He was speaking at the inauguration of the 42nd national conference of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, being held in the city after a gap of 12 years, on Thursday. 

 ?I would like to invite you to take the initiative and set up a special childcare institute in Calcutta, which will provide speciality treatment at an affordable cost. The existing one, unfortunately, lacks infrastructure and there have been a few deaths because of this,? Mukherjee said. 

 The inaugural session was attended by doctors from across the country, as well as from the neighbouring nations. This is the first time that doctors from Pakistan are attending the Indian Academy of Paediatrics conference.

 The meet will focus on ?extra care for children of urban and migratory population? and also deliberate on some of the key diseases ? such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and HIV/AIDS ? that account for nearly 90 per cent of child mortality.

 Records reveal that infant (below five years) and neo-natal mortality rates are considerably higher among the urban poor, compared to the national and state averages. 

 The meet, sources said, will strive to play an active role in reaching the recent advances in healthcare to areas and communities that have long been neglected. ?It?s time we went beyond simple advocacy. We should give new directions to child survival interventions,? said Raju C. Shah, president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics. 

 Considering the increase in the number of cases of bronchial asthma among children, the organisation plans to hold a special programme ? Breathe Free for Quality Life ? to discuss the treatment and management strategies of the disease. 

 Toeing the mayor?s line of laying the thrust on an immunisation programme, the organisation said it strongly felt the need of adding two more vaccines, MMR and HIB, to increase the child survival rate. 

 It also resolved to organise workshops for quality reinforcement in immunisation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Fashion fun amp; new haunt for party people

Pub-crawling is not just about dancing and drinking 

anymore. If you have a passion for fashion, you can pick up an idea or two about 

the latest trends in town, for fashion shows at night haunts have become a common 

feature. 

Big Ben at Kenilworth was the place to be for fashionistas 

this Saturday as city models strutted new designer kid Pritam Panda?s stuff. 

The dance floor was jam-packed as early as 11 pm, 

Katrina Kaif?s starry appearance at Starstruck close by notwithstanding. The crowd 

readily made way for sultry models, however, as the fashion show kicked off on 

the dance floor, a little before midnight. 

The show unfolded in three sequences. Asymmetrical 

tops came on first, embellished with lots of embroidery and handprints. The second 

date was with denim, while the third sequence had attitude written all over it. 

It was this dare-bare collection, comprising skimpy skirts and skimpier tops, 

that had the mercury soaring. 

?The emphasis is on comfortable clothing. The lounge 

concept is really catching up and the clothes showcased today fit well in the 

lounge category,? said Panda.

The line is priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 60,000.

If the turnout at the launch party of BED on Ballygunge 

Circular Road last Wednesday was any indication of Calcutta?s growing taste for 

a vibrant nightlife, the inauguration of the much-awaited Starstruck Retro Lounge 

in Forum proved the point again. The new night-spot, which officially opened from 

Sunday night, played host to Katrina Kaif and a few hundred party people of Calcutta 

on Saturday night. 

The fourth-floor address at the shopping mall, tucked 

away inside the Starstruck restaurant, is all set to be the first ever authentic 

lounge the city has seen. ?We are very particular about the fact that there is 

going to be no dancing in this place, which is the actual concept of a lounge,? 

said owner Bunty Sethi. 

The well-done-up interiors with furniture imported 

from Italy, shattered-glass bar top and a black-and-white theme left even the 

glamorous Katrina raving about the d?cor. ?The interiors are beautiful,? gushed 

Katrina. Dressed in a blue chiffon top and white lowers, her ?no make-up? look 

drew the guests by hoards. A few autographs and photographs later, however, she 

decided to call it a night. ?I haven?t ever partied in Calcutta. This is my first 

experience and I liked it very much,? she added. 

And with free-flowing drinks, yummy snacks to munch 

on and close friends for company, other guests willingly gave the Saturday night 

club-hopping a miss as well, to settle comfortably at this new nook.

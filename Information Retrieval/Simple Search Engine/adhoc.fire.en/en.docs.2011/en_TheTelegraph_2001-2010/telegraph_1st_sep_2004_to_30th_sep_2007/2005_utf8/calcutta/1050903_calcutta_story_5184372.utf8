 Wealth turns waste in Salt Lake

 The call to turn ?waste into wealth? has been turned on its head in Salt Lake, where solid waste management equipment worth lakhs is gathering dust since May.

 The equipment ? hydraulic lifts, tractors, waste bins, tricycles and buckets ? was provided to Bidhannagar Municipality by Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority under the Rs 4-crore megacity project, funded by the Centre and the state government.

 These are lying in the civic body?s store and stack yard, right opposite the municipality building, as the authorities have failed to ready the collection system. ?It?s true the equipment is lying unused here as we have not put in place a segregated collection system,? admits municipal chairman Biswajiban Majumdar.

 As the waste bins are left unused, garbage remains scattered across the township ? at Banabitan, behind government buildings or at the site where the Sourav Cricket Academy is coming up. The situation worsens after a spell of smart shower, when filth covers almost the entire township.

 Not long ago, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya had dubbed the township the ?dirtiest in the state?.

 Civic officials, however, are blaming the environment department for the mess. Executive engineer Dilip Gupta admitted that the equipment could not be distributed as ?the new councillors are yet to work out a plan?, but wondered how could the civic body find a replacement for Mollar bheri to dump the waste.

 ?Salt Lake?s waste was being dumped in Mollar bheri since the 1960s. We have been asked to discontinue the practice. Where will we find another site that can hold the enormous amount of waste the township generates?? Gupta asked.

 The municipality has been asked by the state pollution control board to find an alternative site following a directive from the environment department that Mollar bheri, listed as a wetland by the Institute of Wetlands Management and Ecological Design, could not be used as a dump.

 Sources, however, confirmed that the wetland is still being used as a dump, while the pollution control board prefers to look in the other direction.

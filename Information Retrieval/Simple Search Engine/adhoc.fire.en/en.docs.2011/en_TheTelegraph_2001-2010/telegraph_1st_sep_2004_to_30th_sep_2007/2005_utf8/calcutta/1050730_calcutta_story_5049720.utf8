 The forthcoming occasion of Rakhi was the inspiration for the fourth Poorna Annapurna workshop at Stadel on July 28. The Raksha Bandhan special included a special segment on Rakhi tray decoration by Ashish Bajaj and cooking demonstrations and culinary tips by chef Narayan Chatterjee. 

 PR consultant Rita Bhimani, Sashi Dhupar of Punjab Biradree and model Sudipta were also present. Participants learnt easy and innovative ways to decorate trays and make artificial flowers and lumbas.

 The cooking segment was a mouth-watering experience, with Lebanese, Mexican and continental dishes on the table. Croissant sandwiches (croissants with carrots, cucumber, capsicum, cheese, french dressing and mint chutney) and tarts with a variety of fillings were tasty anytime snacks. 

 Demonstration of quesadillas (a Mexican dish served with tortillas, grated cheese and filling made with yellow capsicum, green capsicum, onion, pepper, paprika powder, Tobasco sauce and tomato sauce, served with salsa and sour cream) and the much-loved Lebanese falafel with taboulleh, and tahina sauce were lapped up by all present.

 Bypass bite

 If you thought that a Bypass bite could only dish out Chinese, take a U-turn. Destiny might not be a conventional name for a restaurant, but the food here is on a par with many other eateries in town. And yes, it serves cuisine other than Chinese.

 The restaurant is located at 113/C Matheswartala Road, right on the Park Circus connector, near Tangra.

 This part of the city and its food has become synonymous with Chinese cuisine. There is no doubt whatsoever it serves the most authentic Chinese food. But for those living in and around this area, there must be greater variety, says Irfan Javed, owner of the eatery. 

 Destiny is an 85-covers restaurant with an adjoining banquet hall that can accommodate more than 700 people. 

 The multi-cuisine restaurant that opened recently serves Indian, Chinese and continental fare.

 A vegetarian meal will cost around Rs 150 and a non-vegetarian meal Rs 175. We also have a takeaway counter where the prices are comparatively lower, says Javed.

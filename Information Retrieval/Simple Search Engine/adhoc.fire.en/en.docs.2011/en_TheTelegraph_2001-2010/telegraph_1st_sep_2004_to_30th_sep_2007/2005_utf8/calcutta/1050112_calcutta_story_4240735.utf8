 ?These are the doctors responsible for the death of my only son. He died because of their negligence,? Munni Devi, weeping ceaselessly, told the court of Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh on Tuesday.

 The Rajnis Patel case began again after a break of eight weeks, with the ?partial examination? of the budding cricketer?s mother, the second witness to be examined.

 Public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh said the 25-minute hearing, which started at 12.30 pm, was stopped for the day after Munni Devi started weeping bitterly.

 Her husband Manoj tried in vain to console her. The examination resumes on Wednesday.

 Of the five persons accused in the case, junior doctors Souvik Bardhan, Sandip Manna, Jayanta Mondol and Nirmalya Basu were present. Orthopaedic surgeon D.K. Majumdar was absent.

 On February 6, 2003, Rajnis, 17, suffered a fracture on his left shinbone during a practice match at Vivekananda Park. Some of his friends took him home in a taxi. 

 Munni Devi narrated the sequence of events that followed, up to the boy?s death in the Woodburn block of SSKM Hospital after undergoing five botched operations over a period of four months.

 ?The first surgery was on February 17, the second on March 3. After that, there was bleeding, and pus had formed in the wound,? mother Munni Devi recounted.

 ?When I went to inform Dr D.K. Majumdar, he seemed irritated and was rude. He told me to stop pestering him. My son died because of the doctor?s negligence,? she added, her voice quivering.

 The courtroom erupted when Ghosh posed his next question: ?Was it a natural death or an unnatural death?? 

 Munni Devi indicated the latter, prompting defence counsel Dipit Basu to object.

 In spite of his protests, the court recorded that the death was an unnatural one. 

 Munni Devi then identified the four doctors in the witness box, and mentioned that Dr Majumdar was not present.

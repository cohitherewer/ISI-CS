The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Meal makeover

The Palm Court at The HHI will soon get a makeover. 

Come June and renovation work will begin at the 24-hour coffee shop, where three 

open kitchens will share space, each specialising in different cuisine.

 The interactive counters will add to the ?international feel?, hopes the management, as part of its attempt to overhaul the hotel?s image and attract a new client base.

 Plans are being drawn up for a tandoor, as well as Italian and Oriental counters, to pamper palettes of every taste.

 Fresh from the oven is the promise at the round-the-clock destination, which includes everything from elaborate slow-cooked options to quick bites like sandwiches.

 ?The idea is to bring the visual delight of an open kitchen to the guest and allow him or her to interact directly with the chef while keeping intact the quick service of a coffee shop,? says Utpal Mondal, executive chef of the star hotel. 

 To usher in the new concept, a new look will also be rolled out.

 ?We have an international interior designing agency working on the new look. It will be younger and more vibrant in it?s d?cor,? reveals a spokesperson for the hotel. 

 More covers to accommodate the expected rise in footfall is also being worked in. ?The Polo Bar area and the back kitchen will be incorporated within Palm Court, making it more spacious,? adds the spokesperson.

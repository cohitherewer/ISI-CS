The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Romance revelry 

Himika Chaudhuri, Zeeshan Jawed

The 

Valentine?s Day fever that plagued the city for over a week peaked with the final 

lovestruck events late on Monday evening. Calcutta?s love brigade took to hotspots 

around town with a vengeance ? raiding restaurants, hopping nightclubs and lounging 

at lounges ? in a bid to make Valentine?s memorable.

 Goodlife was there at the key party places rocking to the sound of love...

The Park

 The excitement was on for three whole days here with Heartbeat, an event that saw DJ Suketu and model Upen Patel as outstation celebs helping Calcuttans rise to new heights of romance. While Suketu spun the music wheel on Saturday night, hot bod Upen Patel sent the mercury soaring. If a cosy date with a first-year student of City College ? winner of the Heartbeat contest ? at the Atrium ruled his day, at night he was busy giving away prizes and hogging the limelight at Tantra.

 So, who was the lucky girl? Rashi Kapoor, 19, who trooped into Atrium at 6 pm, dressed casually in a pair of denims and a T-shirt ? a little nervous, yet excited about meeting her celebrity Valentine.

 Dressed in a red-and-black mosaic-printed shirt, a pair of denims and a huge smile, Upen stepped into the coffee shop and planted a kiss on her cheek. Things began to roll instantly, thereafter. 

 ?I was sad because I was without a Valentine this year, so I decided to find one through a contest. I have a beautiful lady with me and we are sitting in a lovely restaurant listening to music, chatting and munching on goodies. What else can a man ask for?? said the model all set to woo Rashi. ?It?s her day. I?ll have to do whatever she tells me to!?

 Red Kitchen amp; Lounge

 Just the right place for a private evening out, this haunt had couples, both young and young at heart. With model Anchal Kumar playing hostess for the evening, it was not long before she pulled people off their seats and on to the dance floor at the Alipore hotspot.

 ?The people of Calcutta always listen to me and I love them,? said the model, moving to hip hop and Indipop numbers as the crowd warmed to the spirit of the night.

Big Ben

 The lovebirds at The Kenilworth address were treated to some exotic beats by DJ Nakadia from Thailand.

 The DJ who was performing in Calcutta for the first time has been to various venues across the world, including Germany, England, Italy, Greece and Poland. 

 Her forte is party music, and she prefers to be called a ?party DJ?. ?I always take it on myself to make every party I go to rock. I ensure that I play what the crowd wants to hear rather than imposing my own choices upon them,? said the 24-year-old DJ.

 The party kicked off at Sanjha Chulha at 8.30 pm. The fun fiesta peaked with a change of venue to Big Ben, post-11 pm.

That is when Nakadia took control of the console. 

From Every breath you take, Have you ever really loved a woman and My 

heart will go on to Superstar and Turn me on, there was something 

for everyone.

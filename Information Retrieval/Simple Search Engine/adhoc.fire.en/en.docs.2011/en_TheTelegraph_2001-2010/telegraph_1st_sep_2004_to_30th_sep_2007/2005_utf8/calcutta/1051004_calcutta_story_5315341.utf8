The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rain upsets road repair schedule

 OUR BUREAU

 It was a race against time, but with the skies opening up again, the last-ditch effort by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to conduct major repair work on city streets has been all but called off.

 A CMC survey on Monday revealed that over 60,000 potholes in the city require to be filled up before the Pujas, not to mention the vast stretches of road in urgent need of some patch-up job. 

 But the rains have played havoc with its plans. ?If the rain stops, the potholes will be filled up soon with bitumen and stone chips, as we have enough manpower and funds for the task, but for that we need at least three dry days,? said Tuhin Bera, mayoral council member (roads). 

 A CMC team, after conducting a detailed survey, came to the conclusion that it could not carry out major road repair work in such little time. ?We got in touch with the Met office and were told that we can expect more such spells of rain in the next two days,? a senior CMC officer added.

 Even though the rain stopped in the afternoon, civic labourers could not resume work. ?The road surface is wet and the supply of hot mix from our plants at Goragachha and Palmer Bazaar has become uncertain,? an engineer said.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay joined civic officers to inspect roads across the city in the morning and evening. 

 It was decided that only the carriageways between tram tracks along MG Road and RG Kar Road will receive new topcoats. Only craters will be covered with hot-mix.

 The morning rain played a spoilsport for Puja shoppers, with many deciding to stay back home. ?Today being a holiday, we wanted to visit the new malls, but could not because of the rain,? said Anurima Dasgupta, a resident of the Beckbagan area, which was waterlogged.

 The malls and shops heaved a sigh of relief when the rain stopped late in the afternoon. ?It was bad in the morning, but things improved in the afternoon. We are expecting shoppers till late evening,? said K. Sanghani, chief executive officer of Gariahat Mall. 

 Pantaloons and Westside on Camac Street, City Centre in Salt Lake and Big Bazar on VIP Road had much the same story to tell.

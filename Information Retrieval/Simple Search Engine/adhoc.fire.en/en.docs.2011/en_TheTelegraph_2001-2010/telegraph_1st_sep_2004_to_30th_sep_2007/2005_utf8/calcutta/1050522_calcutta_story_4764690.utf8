The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Not just a famous face

 Celebrity advertising driven by logic could prove far more potent in building brands and pushing products

 Vikas had just come back from work. He had a tough day in office. He needed to unwind. He picked up the remote for his TV set. He kept changing the channel, much to the chagrin of Mridula.

 This is when they saw Hrithik Roshan. No, not in a movie. Nor in a song. One of the minor channels, the kind that comes in the 50-plus slots, were showing an ad for Rasna. Hrithik featured in it, not as Hrithik Roshan but as the character he played in Koi... Mil Gaya.

 Celebrity advertising is often chastised by the pundits. They say it is only when you run out of creative ideas for a new campaign, you sign up a star. Others are even unkind. They accuse celebrity advertising to be caused by familial motives. The owner?s 12-year-old offspring has this intense desire to rub shoulders with a superstar; he pays crores to a Shah Rukh or an Aamir depending on his kid?s predilection.

 Be that as it may, it is also true that the presence of a celebrity in an ad makes it do things that it would find difficult to achieve otherwise. The most apparent of these is the ability of an ad to cut through clutter. In very simple terms, it means being noticed in a crowd. Imagine yourself taking a Metro in peak hour. You would see hundreds of faces during your journey, yet when you get down maybe you will remember none. Yet, if one of the faces was that of Leander or Sourav or Konkona, you will find it difficult to erase it from your mind.

 This, as they say, is the necessary but not sufficient achievement of an advertisement that uses a celebrity. It must go beyond and enrich the brand in question with an attribute of the star, be it the machoness of Akshay or the beauty of Aishwarya. At the very least, the brand is expected to get a rub-off from the intense love and affection that consumers have for an Amitabh or a Sachin. Most of the time the endorsing star has very little else to offer. Their credentials to vouch for the product will not stand rational scrutiny.

 This has been the thinking that governed the utilisation of celebrities in advertising. Things have started changing. Surf recently brought in Shabana Azmi and exploited her social activist image. This was a new dimension altogether. It meshed well with the brand claim.

 The Rasna ad using Hrithik is also unusual. It does not use the star in his private personae. It exploits one of his portrayals ? expectedly from a superhit film and also not surprisingly as a character that was possibly more loved by the audience than the star himself. The Rasna ad proves a fresh point. Anybody with deep pockets can use Amitabh in prime time. It takes some doing to pick a character as a celebrity in your ad albeit with a star playing it. Having done it, Rasna chose to drive home the advantage of this creativity by using minor low-cost channels, banking on the Hrithik character to get it the noticeability. The trick is to optimise what you do not have in plenty, rather than crib about what you ideally should have had. It assumes even more significance when you are competing against as affluent a competitor as Pepsi.

 Many say that creativity in accountancy and logic in advertising are rare ingredients. Time has come to change our opinion, at least the second one.

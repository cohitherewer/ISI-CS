 Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Soka University of Japan to enable its students and teachers to visit Japan for exchange of knowledge in humanities subjects. 

 As per the MoU, students, teachers and scholars of both universities will extensively interact on academics. 

 Officials said on Sunday that the exchange of views would help enhance their knowledge in the faculties of arts and fine arts, particularly studies on Tagore. 

 RBU vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee told Metro on Sunday that the university will initially send a team of five, comprising scholars and teachers, to Japan. 

 On their return, they will share their experiences with the other scholars and teachers. They will also be assigned to take special classes for post-graduate students. 

 Santosh Kumar Ghorai, RBU registrar, said the MoU was signed after a green signal from the state government. 

 ?We had approached the state government before signing the MoU with the Japanese university. It gave its consent two months ago,? he added.

 Apart from Soka University, RBU has also signed an agreement with North Carolina University. 

 This will enable RBU to send its students to the US-based university for higher studies, an official of the university said.

 RBU has recently introduced a number of certificate courses ? each of six months? duration ? on various foreign and Indian languages. 

 ?We are expecting help from teachers and scholars of Soka University in running some of our certificate courses, especially the ones on Japanese language,? said Ghorai. 

 A three-star status, recently awarded by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), has prompted RBU to tie up with two foreign universities in quick succession. It is also expecting funds from the University Grants Commission (UGC). 

 ?Our certificate courses will help the students get jobs outside the country. The UGC has specifically asked universities to introduce employment-oriented courses. We are sure our new certificate courses will be appreciated by the UGC,? said a senior teacher of the university.

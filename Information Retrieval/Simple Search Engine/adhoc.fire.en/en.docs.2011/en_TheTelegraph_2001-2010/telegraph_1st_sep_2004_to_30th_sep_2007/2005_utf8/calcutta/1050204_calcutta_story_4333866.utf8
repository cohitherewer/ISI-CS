The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Secret visit to sullied green

 - Judge sees Memorial in disarray, slaps injunction on work

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Victoria Memorial: Eyes wide open. A Telegraph picture

 What does a judge do when in doubt about his orders being carried out? He either waits for the truth to emerge in his courtroom, or he steps out to see the truth for himself.

 Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly took the road less travelled recently. His destination: Victoria Memorial. His mission: an anonymous, on-the-spot check to ascertain whether court-ordained steps were, indeed, being taken for the preservation of the monument.

 Justice Ganguly disclosed his secret visit to the Memorial when the public interest litigation he is presiding over, along with Justice Tapan Dutt, came up for hearing on Tuesday at Calcutta High Court.

?I went there unannounced and noticed a toilet complex 

and a pump house being constructed inside the proposed park, on the grounds adjoining 

the Memorial compound. I believe that the said construction will obstruct the 

view of the historic monument,? observed Justice Ganguly.

The judge, while passing an in terim injunction on 

the construction work, instructed the public works department (PWD) to send an 

expert team of engineers to visit the spot and submit a report within seven days. 

 quot;The PWD team should consult the pollution control board (PCB), Calcutta 

Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Victoria Memorial Hall while preparing their report, quot; 

the judge added, 

The park in the ground adjoining the Memorial is being 

constructed jointly by the CMC and Calcutta Police. Petitioner Subhas Dutta pointed 

out that the expert com-mittees recommendation for a green zone around the 

monument had not been implemented. The division bench instructed that tall trees 

with big leaves be planted immediately as a buffer to lower pollution levels.

The division bench also asked the PCB and the Botanical 

Survey of India to conduct a survey and recommend, within a week, varieties of 

trees that could be planted.The judges then directed the CMC to clear the sewerage 

and drainage system on the Memorial campus, also within seven days.

State government pleader Rabilal Moitra drew flak 

when he insinuated that the CMC had rushed completion of the park with an eye 

on the civic elections. quot;Dont bring your dirty politics into this court? 

We want the work to be completed, quot; said Justice Ganguly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 After 10 pm, hoodlums, pimps, pickpockets and unruly porters take over Howrah 

and Sealdah stations. The situation is so bad that people dread to get off the 

trains at the stations at night. The porters demand exorbitant rates from elderly 

couples and families. Having no other option, many are forced to pay up. Railway 

staff or Railway Protection Force personnel are nowhere to be seen. How long will 

this state of affairs continue?

 BSNL?s DataOne subscribers face several problems in connecting to the network. 

Once disconnected, it takes a long time to reconnect. Sometimes, it is almost 

impossible to log on. BSNL is refusing to acknowledge the problem. I have been 

facing it every day for the past two months. Several neighbours are facing the 

same problem. Registering complaints is useless.

 The Mohun Bagan ground used to be one of the finest not only in Calcutta, but 

also in eastern India. I was shocked on entering the ground recently. There are 

signs of neglect everywhere. The major portion of the gallery is in very poor 

condition. Many of the seats are broken and are covered in moss. The authorities 

of the club should immediately start restoring the ground. 

 Sourish Misra, Salt Lake.

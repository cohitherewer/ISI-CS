 Charges framed in soiree murder case

 OUR BUREAU

 Two months after his arrest, the police have framed charges against Dilip Banerjee, alias Hatkata Dilip ? the main accused in the Salt Lake soiree murder case ? and 21 others. The trial will commence on March 18.

 All 22 accused were produced in the court of additional district and sessions judge Ranajit Bag on Saturday. 

 Suparna Adhikary, alias Miss Laila, Dilip?s associate and a resident of Ultadanga, who was performing on stage on the night of June 27, and 15 others have been charged under Sections 302, 34, 109, 212 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. 

 While Dilip and 16 others have been charged with murder, footballers Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy have been found guilty of harbouring criminals.

 After a four-month chase, Dilip was arrested on October 29 last year at East Bengal footballer Sasthi Duley?s house in Noapara, Hooghly, on charges of killing two persons at a soiree in Nayapatti on June 27. Duley?s clubmate Dipankar Roy had brought Dilip to his house, where the goon reportedly took shelter for three months. 

 Duley, Roy and three others ? Rajiv Sinha, alias Bapi, Sanjeeb Sarkar, alias Pinku, and Tarun Das, alias Bachchu ? have been found guilty of harbouring criminals and hatching a criminal conspiracy. 

 Of the 22 accused, 15, including Dilip, are in jail custody, while the others, including Miss Laila, are on bail. 

 The footballer duo was also earlier released on bail. Police had initially detained Sasthi?s elder brother Uday but released him later. 

 ?We have gathered enough evidence of Dilip?s involvement in the murder case,? said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Parveen Kumar. 

 Dilip was initially lodged in Dum Dum Central jail but was soon shifted to Barrackpore sub-jail for security reasons. Police said Dilip had appealed for a shift, as many members of his rival gangs, including Pinaki, were kept in the same prison. 

 After the Nayapatti murder, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had ordered that ?Dilip must be caught alive?, as it came to light that the criminals enjoyed the support of a section of the CPM and the police.

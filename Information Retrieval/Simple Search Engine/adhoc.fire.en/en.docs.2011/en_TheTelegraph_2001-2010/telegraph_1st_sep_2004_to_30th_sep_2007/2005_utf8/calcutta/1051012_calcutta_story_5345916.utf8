The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Immersion fee from 2006, cages in place

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Immersion of idols in the Hooghly will no longer be free. Organisers of community pujas will have to pay a fee to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation from 2006 for the Dashami ritual.

 ?Let 2005 be the cut-off year for free immersions,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said on Tuesday, before leaving for China. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay added: ?No fee will be taken from organisers this year for immersions in the Hooghly.?

 To tackle another immersion-related issue, pollution of the river caused by dumping of puja waste, the civic authorities have installed cages, or vats, at Nimtala ghat and Baje Kadamtala ghat. Organisers will have to dump flowers, bel leaves, plastic and other waste in the cages.

 The decision to instal the cages was taken after a meeting between municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay and state pollution control board chairman Sudip Kumar Banerjee.

 ?The purpose is to protect the river from the baneful effect of fermentation of flowers and leaves. Civic personnel will retrieve the dumped material from the cages and dispose them elsewhere,? said Banerjee.

 Contrary to the popular belief, he pointed out, flowers, leaves and plastic are more harmful to water than the chemicals used to colour idols.

 The initial move was to instal the cages at 20 ghats between Cossipore and Garden Reach. But as 70 per cent of the idols, of community and household pujas, are immersed at Nimtala ghat and Baje Kadamtala ghat, the authorities decided to start off with these two spots.

 Executive engineer (parks and gardens) Somnath Sen said four cages ? two in the water and two on land ? each will be placed at the ghats. The cages, each of 200 sq ft, are made of bamboo poles and mats of palm leaves.

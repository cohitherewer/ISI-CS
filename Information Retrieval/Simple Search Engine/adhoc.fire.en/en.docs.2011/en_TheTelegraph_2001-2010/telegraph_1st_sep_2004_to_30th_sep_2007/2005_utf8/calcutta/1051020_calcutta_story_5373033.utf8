 The little big things

ANUMITA GHOSH

Does your childs room look like a battleground? 

A mad medley of books, shoes, Legos and hairpins? Or worse, does it look dull 

and bedraggled ? a place even you wouldnt like to be in?

 Nik Nish seems to have come up with the perfect answer to your problems. After all, what better way to initiate cleanliness and housekeeping than gifting your children with furniture tailor-made for their needs? Colourful cupboards, chairs and tables with decorative motif that can change the look and feel before you can say wow.

 Though these are popular with children of all age-groups, the older ones (five to eight) seem to like them more. The fact that these are playthings that also have a utilitarian value make them unique, explains a spokesperson from the 22 Camac Street store.

 There are pretty mirrors, photo frames, attractive boxes and wall hangers in vibrant lemon yellow, further decorated with flowers and butterflies in green. The bright hangers may just tempt your child to put away ? rather than pile up ? his or her clothes.

 Children generally love hoarding their favourite things and the beautiful boxes are bound to catch their eye. You can forget seeing a floor scattered with clips, bangles or colour pencils once the boxes come into play.

 The walls can be made warmer with family photographs inserted in the long caterpillar frame that gives options for lots of photos. Or you could gift them the simple squarish one with a smiling cartoon caterpillar on top.

 Those with a thing for pink will go crazy seeing the collection of items in baby or dark pink decorated with hearts, flowers, checks and stars. Here again, you have photo frames, boxes, wall hangers, chests, drawers and pen stands.

 The Nik Nish mirror is something out of a fairytale. The attractive mirror has on it a bright smiley girl with braided hair. If it is hung up near the wash stand, even brushing teeth can become your childs favourite activity! 

 From cute little three-storied boxes to ones that have a mirror attached, the box options are varied. You also have the simple ones with a lid on top. The wall hangers with feathery borders have mirrors attached to them.

 And if this is not enough there are stools in bright hues with cartoon motifs on top, from Mickey Mouse to Tweety.

 You could indulge in a whole set for around Rs 1,555 or select individual items.

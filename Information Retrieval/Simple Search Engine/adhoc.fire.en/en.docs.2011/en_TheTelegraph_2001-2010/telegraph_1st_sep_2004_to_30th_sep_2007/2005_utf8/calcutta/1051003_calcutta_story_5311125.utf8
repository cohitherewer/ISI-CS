 Youth held on rape cry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kinkan Sasmal, 19, was arrested on Behala?s Nafar Chandra Das Road on Saturday for allegedly raping a 13-year-old who worked as a maid in his house. His father Mantu, a cloth merchant, wanted on the same charges, is absconding. 

 The girl complained of the alleged rape to her mother, when she visited the Sasmal residence on Saturday evening, after nearly two months. The mother first tried to discuss the matter with Kinkan, but when he declined, she approached a local club, Trishakti Sangha.

 The members, rattled by the account of the girl, immediately informed police. Sensing trouble, Mantu fled.

 ?We have registered a case based on the complaint lodged by the girl?s mother,? said S.N. Gupta, police superintendent of South 24-Parganas.

 The Sasmals had employed the girl in early August. Her father was down with tuberculosis, and the family desperately needed money. 

 ?The man said that his wife had passed away and that my daughter would stay in the house like a family member. I had come to collect money from her when she told me how they were exploiting her,? the girl?s mother recounted.

 The girl has complained that she was sexually abused by the father-son duo ever since she took up the job.

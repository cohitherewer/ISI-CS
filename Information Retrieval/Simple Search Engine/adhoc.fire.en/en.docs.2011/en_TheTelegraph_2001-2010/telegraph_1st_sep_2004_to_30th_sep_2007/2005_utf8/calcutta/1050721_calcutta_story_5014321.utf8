The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Progress pitch, upgrade demand

 OUR BUREAU

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Wednesday unveiled initiatives to showcase Calcutta, even as the industry called for an upgrade of facilities.

 The initiatives include a series of development ventures in Calcutta and major towns in Bengal, backed by the Centre?s Rs 2,500-crore National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM).

 ?The chief minister wants a regeneration of Dalhousie Square (BBD Bag), which has been declared a heritage site. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority is framing plans for the renewal of the area. Parking facilities, shifting of the bus stand and beautification till the riverfront are on the cards. We?ll ask for Central assistance under the NURM,? said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 The government is also keen on rejuvenating Howrah and Kumartuli, home to idol-makers.

 Bhattacharya will sit with ministers from the public works, planning and development, and transport departments, as well as the mayor and officials of Hidco, on Thursday evening to finalise the list of proposals to be tabled for NURM assistance.

 Calcutta apart, Asansol and Durgapur are among the towns expected to benefit from the Centre?s scheme. 

 While Delhi will provide 35 per cent assistance for Calcutta, the Bengal government will have to contribute the rest. For Durgapur, Central assistance will be to the extent of 50 per cent.

 If at Writers? Buildings the minister was busy painting a rosy picture of Calcutta Tomorrow, at the Assembly, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) was making a strong pitch to improve Calcutta Today.

 At an interactive session on Wednesday morning, members of the industry body called for infrastructure revamp, overhaul of the transport system and beautification drives in and around Calcutta. 

 The need for coordination between legislators and the industry, private-public partnership and corporate participation to accelerate development was also stressed.

 Biswadip Gupta, chairman, state council, CII, also focused on the need to develop Haldia, Siliguri, Kharagpur and Asansol as self-sufficient growth areas.

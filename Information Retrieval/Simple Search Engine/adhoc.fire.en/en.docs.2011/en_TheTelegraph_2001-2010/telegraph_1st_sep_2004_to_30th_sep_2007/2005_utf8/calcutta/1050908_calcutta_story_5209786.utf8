 Dengue ward sets off 25 crib deaths

 KINSUK BASU

 The dreaded fever has not hit any other hospital so hard.

 At least 25 newborns have died of ?cross-infection? at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children in the past six days, after the authorities decided to reserve a room for dengue patients and moved all kids and their mothers from there to another room.

 Sources said six babies died on September 5 and five each on September 1 and 2.

 ?My four-and-a-half-year-old grandson, Manoj, died around 12.30 pm. Even after waiting for more than four hours, we don?t have any clue to his death. No one has time to talk to us,? rued Kalipada Mondal, from Howrah?s Tentulberia, on Wednesday.

 Room no. 11, on the second floor of the hospital, has been converted into a dengue ward, and those who were being treated there, along with their mothers, have been shifted to room no. 7, already full with mothers and newborns.

 The condition at the state?s only referral hospital for children has worsened to such an extent that director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee and director of medical education Jayshree Mitra made a sudden visit on Wednesday.

 The two went straight to the second floor, visited the rooms and talked to nurses and doctors. They left after noting down the details, reportedly peeved with the state of affairs.

 BC Roy was the second stop of the day for the duo, after Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital, in Beleghata. The ID Hospital authorities were pulled up by the directors for ?shirking responsibility? and referring suspected dengue patients to National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases.

 ?We wanted to see the condition at these hospitals,? said Mitra. ?The BC Roy authorities are doing a tremendous job despite being hamstrung. There has been no refusal. Some problems exist, but they can?t be discussed with the media.?

 In room 7, mothers left their babies on the beds and sat on the floor or on wooden stools. Six newborns, weighing between 550 and 750 gram, were laid on three open-chamber heaters, as visitors walked in and out.

 In room 11, the dengue ward, the authorities had ensured that most children and their mothers were covered with mosquito nets. 

 ?The problem is for everyone to see. We are not trying to hide things. What more can we do? We are working hard, but the pressure is beyond our capacity,? said hospital superintendent Mrinal Chatterjee.

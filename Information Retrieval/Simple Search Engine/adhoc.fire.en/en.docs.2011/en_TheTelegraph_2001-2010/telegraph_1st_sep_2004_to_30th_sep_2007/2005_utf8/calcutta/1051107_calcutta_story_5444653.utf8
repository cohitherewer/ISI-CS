 Exam system in shift mode

 - New site, computers to iron out glitches

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta University is ready to overhaul its examination system. Among the string of measures being contemplated is relocation of the examination department from the College Street campus. 

 ?There is an urgent need to make over the entire examination system to cope with the changing education scenario. Introduction of new courses in emerging fields has also necessitated the change,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic) of the university, on Sunday.

 ?Our measures are aimed at making the examination system 100 per cent transparent and error-free. A complex exclusively for exam-related work will help us achieve this target,? the pro vice-chancellor added.

 The proposed complex will be set up with a Rs 10-crore grant from the Centre to mark the university?s 150th anniversary next year.

 The increase in the number of students who take the university?s 600 undergraduate and postgraduate examinations has coincided with more complaints of under-marking, faulty evaluation and errors in tabulation and entry of data in marksheets. 

 Mistakes in admit cards and registration certificates have also shot up in recent years.

 ?We have decided to procure sophisticated, computerised gadgets to help us iron out the glitches in the examination system,? said a senior official of the university?s examination department.

 For example, specially-designed scanners will help to do away with manual entry of data, explained the official. Consequently, the tabulation work can also be computerised totally.

 Hi-tech machines will be used to print question papers and other important documents in bulk. This will help the university change the question papers hours before an examination in case of a complaint of a leak. 

 Recent reviews by the university have revealed that shortage of examiners and delays on their part often push back the date of declaration of results of major examinations like BA, B.Sc and B.Com.

 To speed up the evaluation process, the authorities have decided to build huge halls in the proposed complex, where the examiners will sit together and correct the answer-scripts.

 ?We have a plan to gradually do away with the system of allowing examiners to correct the answer-scripts at home. Officials can maintain round-the-clock vigil in the halls while the examiners correct the answer-scripts. This will minimise the chances of malpractice and under-marking,? said the university official.

 A large plot on the Hastings campus of Viharilal College, affiliated to the university, has been identified for constructing the examination complex. The building will be equipped with modern amenities and house all units of the university dealing with examination-related work.

 The tempting smell of freshly-baked cake wafts down a bylane behind Bow Barracks, called Rubber Street. The area around the Buddhist temple, usually sleepy, is bustling with activity, but only in one corner. Montoo?s bakery is busy dishing out hundreds of Christmas cakes on Thursday afternoon.

 Workers churn up to two kg of flour, sugar, butter and other ingredients by hand and whip egg whites in large containers ? under the watchful gaze of men and women from the Anglo-Indian community cooking up their seasonal specials.

 Every December, for 10 days leading up to the 25th, several small bakeries around town, from Beckbagan to Bowbazar, hire out their ovens to bake ?home-made? cakes. ?Our shop is at least 100 years old. My father bought it in 1949 and we religiously follow this Christmas tradition,? smiles Montoo, ordering cha on the house for his Xmas brigade.

 Adding to the quaint nature of the cake-bake deal, the customers are charged by the kg of sugar they bring ? anything between Rs 100 and Rs 200.

 Most clients are regulars. Cheryl Manual lives in Park Circus, but returns every year-end to make her cakes here. 

 ?We bake them in sizes of about two lbs each. Almost 60 per cent is distributed. Considering the amount of cake we bake, it?s not possible to do it at home. We need a bhatti,? says the marketing manager of a travel agency. And it?s often more than just about finding an oven. ?There?s a community feeling here, a good opportunity for friends and family to gather together,? Cheryl adds.

 Just as the family recipe is a matter of pride and tradition ? each recipe is different, passed down the generations, usually from mother to daughter ? so is the custom of going to a bakery to bake the Christmas cake. The queues often start at 5 am, and at Montoo?s shop (officially called J.N. Barua Food Products), it continues till midnight, with up to 50 customers a day and 250 cakes in the oven at a time.

 Philomina David has been following the custom for over 20 years. She used to make the once-a-year pilgrimage to a bakery on Eliot Road, which was sold and converted into a hotel. This year, the resident of Picnic Garden went to a little bakery at 8, Ripon Lane.

 ?Sometimes, we cannot afford all the ingredients, but we always make the cakes. Our Hindu and Muslims neighbours and friends distribute sweets on their festivals, and this is our chance to reciprocate. Most of our family comes to Calcutta for Christmas and New Year, because it?s the best here,? says Philomina, placing paper nametags on her dough before its put in the oven.

 Luttfur Chowdhury?s father ran a bakery on Chandni Chowk, which was shut down years ago. But he has continued the Christmas tradition for 25 years, hiring bakeries from their owners in the mornings and renting them out to his 100-odd customers every December. ?I have a specific set of people whom I ring up and tell them where to go,? says the van-driver from Arambagh.

 Sherman Mcatee, a caterer who uses Montoo?s bakery to make cakes for parties, sums it up: ?Christmas just isn?t the same without this tradition. And there is a world of difference in the taste between our cakes and the ones sold in stores.?

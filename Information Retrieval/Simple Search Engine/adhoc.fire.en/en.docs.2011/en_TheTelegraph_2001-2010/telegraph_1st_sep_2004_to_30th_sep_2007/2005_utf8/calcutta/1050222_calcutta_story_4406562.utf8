 GAURAV BELANI

Gaurav Belani

Sporty Scorpio...

 Is this 17-year-old. Gaurav has been playing football, cricket, 

rugby and hockey since he started school. Swimming is another hobby that brought 

fame. The La Martiniere for Boys student has represented his school in cricket, 

football and swimming. 

Booked for success...

 Is Billu ? as he is known to family and friends. He?s in 

the school cricket team and is also the goalkeeper of the football team. But this 

youngster has as much brain as brawn. The boy of substance scored a 90 per cent 

in his ICSE exams, and is set to deliver in the Class XII boards in 2006. 

Teen sensation...

 In more ways than one is he. But the Ricky Ponting fan has 

more on his plate and up his sleeve than meets the eye. He?s a member of the school 

Interact Club and is also an editorial board member of the nature club.

Scoring a century...

 Is neither new nor novel for cricket-crazy Billu. Taking 

part in extracurricular activities ? mostly of the sporting kind ? is almost second 

nature to him, having played in around 30 cricket matches. Among the feathers 

in the ace batsman?s cap is representing his school at the under-16 and under-19 

levels. 

Business unusual...

 Is his aim. Despite his sporting success, the biology freak 

wants to study biotechnology or business. Sports is his passion, not profession. 

And he?s sure to make it, with his businessman father as role model.

He says...

 ?I hope I may one day become a successful person and be remembered 

for making a difference. I would like to thank my parents and my school for the 

opportunities I have been given. I am what I am today because of them.?

 With shortage of land coming in the way of the implementation of its future projects, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authorities (CMDA) is planning a drive to create a land bank.

 ?We will approach various government departments for plots so that we can go ahead with the various social and infrastructure projects in the pipeline,? said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer, CMDA.

 A survey will soon be conducted to identify the plots needed for the projects.

 The Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation department of the state government and the district authorities of North and South 24-Parganas will be initially approached for land. ?Plots will be purchased from these departments,? stated Baviskar.

 The agency is finding it difficult to procure bulk land in and around the city to pursue projects like construction of bridges and flyovers, widening of roads and setting up of water and sewerage treatment plants. 

 At present, CMDA only has a 70-acre plot in Nonadanga, off EM Bypass. It hasn?t yet been decided how the land will be used. According to Baviskar, various proposals regarding the utilisation of the land are being explored.

 ?A major portion of our land has been used up for housing projects,? said a CMDA official.

 Four major infrastructure projects by CMDA are ready to be kicked off immediately. Work on the Kona logistic hub, Dankuni housing project, Barrackpore-Kalyani Expressway and the flyover at the EM Bypass-Ultadanga intersection is expected to start soon. All the projects will be implemented through public-private partnership.

 In the next phase, the elevated road from Parama island on EM Bypass to Park Circus and other projects would be taken up. 

 For the Kona logistic hub, to come up on 108 acres, two private firms have submitted technical and financial bids. 

 Eleven parties have submitted bids for the Dankuni township project, which is likely to be completed, at least partially, by 2011. A committee has been set up to acquire land for the township, which will also have educational and entertainment facilities. Around 1,000 of the 5,010 acres will be developed as an industrial hub.

 The township will be a 20-minute drive from the airport once the second Vivekananda Setu and a connecting expressway are ready. 

 The 41-km Barrackpore-Kalyani Expressway will also be extended by six km to Dum Dum and widened from four to six lanes. 

 ?The private party implementing the project will be given the right to collect toll,? a senior urban development official said. 

 The 1,200-m EM Bypass-Ultadanga flyover will help motorists to and from the airport avoid the regular traffic snarls at the Ultadanga crossing. 

 Plans have also been drawn to plant 20,000 trees along the entire stretch of EM Bypass. The state forest department has provided a fund of Rs 15 lakh for this.

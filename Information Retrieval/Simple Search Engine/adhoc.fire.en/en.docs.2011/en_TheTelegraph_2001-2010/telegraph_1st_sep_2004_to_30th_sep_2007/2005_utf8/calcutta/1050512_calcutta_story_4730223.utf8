The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Run B ?n? B run

 Rani Mukherjee and Abhishek Bachchan in Bunty Aur Babli

 From the Taj Mahal to the banks of the Ganges, the saffrons of Varanasi to the browns of Kanpur, the whites of Mussoorie to the tinkling bells of Rishikesh ? run B ?n? B run. That?s the race the entire nation could be cheering, once Bunty Aur Babli hits the theatres on May 27.

 Arthur Penn is a popular man in Bollywood these days. His The Miracle Worker inspired Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black, which worked quite a few miracles at the box-office. And now Bonnie And Clyde, another Penn classic, is the take-off point for the Yash Raj production which brings together the two Bachchans on-screen for the first time with their favourite leading lady Rani Mukherjee for company.

 And the man behind the megaphone, Shaad Ali, who earlier adapted Mani ?Sir? Ratnam?s Alaipayuthey to rocking success with Saathiya, has added an extra Sehgal to his name. ?That was my grandfather?s name. I?ve wanted to have it for a long time. With Bunty Aur Babli, I?ve finally made it official,? points out poet-film-maker Muzaffar Ali?s son.

 But Shaad, like his film?s producer Aditya Chopra, has chosen to stay mum prior to the release of his colourful celluloid creation. ?I am so drained, personally and emotionally that I don?t think I am in a position to talk about the film. It is too personal an experience to share. My job was to make the film and now it is up to the audiences to accept it or reject it,? Shaad tells Metro.

 Apart from pitting the two Bachchans against each other for the first time, Bunty Aur Babli has gimmicks galore. After Shakti ? The Power, Aishwarya Rai does her second item number with both the Bachchans for company. Australian hot bod Tania Zaetta, known for her daredevil darting around in AXN?s Who Dares Wins, plays a meaty role in the film as a foreigner named Kate.

 Also, in a carefully planned surrogate advertisement, Maruti will launch its new car Swift, used in the film, on the release date of Bunty Aur Babli.

 But the big draw remains the clash of the Bs. Amitabh plays Dashrath Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, who has just four passions ? bidis, chanas, Bunty and Babli. The last two, played by Abhishek and Rani, are big-time cheats who become everything from spiritual gurus to bureaucrat-secretary to gangster-moll to business partners to henpecked husband-pregnant wife.

 ?If you ask me how the two Bachchans were together on screen, I would say it was very nice and they were great on the sets. But the film has to justify my claims,? says Shaad. ?Trust me, Bunty Aur Babli will do all the talking once it releases.?

 Shot across a record 116 locations by Calcutta?s ace cinematographer Abhik Mukhopadhyay, Bunty Aur Babli has music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and lyrics by Gulzar.

 Eden project duo shelved

 - Toy train, open-air gym plans put on hold in fee-row wake 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The forest department has shelved two projects for the Eden Gardens, in the wake of the army shutting the park down over collection of entry fee from visitors.

 Officials of the urban and recreational forestry wing of the department had planned to introduce a toy train and set up an open-air gymnasium at the Eden Gardens, but they have now all but abandoned the idea, with the park remaining closed since March 22.

 On March 21, army officers raided the garden and asked the department to stop collecting entry fees. They dismantled a cafeteria constructed by the department in the garden.

 The department, which introduced the entry fee last November, has made it clear that it would not be possible to reopen the garden if the entry fee is withdrawn.

 A meeting between the army and forest officials was held on Tuesday to resolve the issue. The park, however, is still shut, with the army yet to show the green light for its reopening.

 ?A number of public-sector undertakings, as well as private companies, had agreed to donate the toy train to us. We had planned to start work on the two projects from the new fiscal beginning Friday. But we are now in a dilemma and cannot think about the projects at the moment,? said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests, on Thursday. 

 ?If the army does not allow visitors in the garden, it is useless to think about implementing our ideas,? he added. Mukherjee is in charge of the Eden Gardens.

 The forest officials had identified a site for setting up the gymnasium. ?Since we were planning to set up an open-air gym, no building is required to be constructed. We had a plan to construct a temporary roof to protect the instruments from the weather. Our plan for the gym is ready, but we are now hesitant to proceed,? said a senior forest official.

 Forest minister Jogesh Burman is also worried about the future of the projects taken up by his department. 

 ?I don?t know when the garden will be reopened. I hope the army will not object to reopening it with entry fees. I feel that our projects will be implemented and the army will not raise any objections,? Burman said.

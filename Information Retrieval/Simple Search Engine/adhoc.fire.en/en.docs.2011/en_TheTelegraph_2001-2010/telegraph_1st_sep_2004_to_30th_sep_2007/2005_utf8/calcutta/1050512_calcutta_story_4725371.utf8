 In search of a raga

 Diverse, expansive and rich in heritage, the oeuvre of Indian classical music includes a number of ragas that are lost to us, having suffered the ravages of time. No less distinguished in comparison with the more famous ones, Deepak Raga is one of the lesser-known ragas, bearing the unmistakable stamp of a glorious tradition of royal patronage. Embarking on a musical journey to rediscover Deepak Raga and unravel the mysteries shrouding it, Srijan?s listeners? forum hosts an evening of classical music devoted exclusively to this raga. Presented by Debabrata Mukhopadhyay, the different strains attempt to explore its form, origin and the possibility of it being derived from any other raga. The concert takes the audience on a melodious trip down history, dwelling on compositions of musical maestros of the time. From Tansen to Faiyaz Khan, Nissar Hussain to Ghulam Mustafa, Ali Akbar Khan to Ravi Shankar, and even Khayal to Rabindrasangeet, the presentation promises to be a superb auditory feast for the true classical music connoisseur.

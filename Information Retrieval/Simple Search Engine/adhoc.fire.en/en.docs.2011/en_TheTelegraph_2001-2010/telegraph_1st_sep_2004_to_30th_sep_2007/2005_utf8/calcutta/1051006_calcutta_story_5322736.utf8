 The impact of mime as a vehicle for highlighting social evils is unparalleled. With its heightened expressions, gestures and movements, it is an art form that effectively draws attention to critical social problems. This evening?s classic mime performance by Suman Mukherjee, besides dwelling on several topical themes, celebrates the human spirit of ambition and adventure. An experimental presentation that blends mime with ballet, it includes My Dream (a combination with contemporary ballet), Imagination (based on Western classical ballet), Modern Valentine (a comedy) and Kolkata Metro Rail (a stunt show). Hosted by Howrah Kalamanjari.

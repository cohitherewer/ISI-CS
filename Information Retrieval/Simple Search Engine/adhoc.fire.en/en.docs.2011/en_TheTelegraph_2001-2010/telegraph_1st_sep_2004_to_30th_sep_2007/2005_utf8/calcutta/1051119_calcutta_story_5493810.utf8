 Indian Craft Village Trust is all set to unveil Craft India 2005, from November 23 to December 2. Hosted under the aegis of the Crafts Council of Bengal, it will be inaugurated by governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi.

 Housed on the sprawling fair ground behind ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, this exhibition will form a cultural crucible of sorts. It will, after all, be the meeting point of around 100 craftsmen from all over the country, showcasing more than 20 categories of crafts.

 Madhubani, Orissa chitra, kalamkari paintings, cane baskets, bamboo seats, trays, sholar saaj, magazine racks, kantha work, dewal chitras, Shibori paintings? All this and more is set to take centre stage at the fair.

 Indias best, all under one roof, is what you are going to see, promises Ruby Palchoudhury, secretary, Crafts Council of Bengal. Crafts from Bengal comprise 15 per cent of the total display.

 Other highlights include an exciting food court. Giant pipuli umbrellas will shelter the food zone, while the Birbhum moras will provide comfortable seating, adds Ruby. Other than typical Bengali fare, perennial Calcutta favourites like phuchka and muri will be on offer, too.

 Special workshops called hathey khori will be organised for school children. Also on the agenda is a top-of-the-line cultural programme.

 Star participants include Priti Patel, Tanushree Shankar, Vikram Iyengar, Sharmila Biswas and Ankita.

 The venue, 3 JBS Haldane Avenue, was acquired 12 years ago. The idea behind acquiring this piece of land was bridging the gap between the main city, Salt Lake and Rajarhat. All of it is now like a dream come true, says Rajiv Gujral, managing trustee of the Indian Craft Village Trust. 

 Things have changed since and their dream project is taking shape. The ultimate aim is a hub for crafts, billed to be a designer amalgamation of art and marketability of such crafts. Till then, this land will play host to many art-related events, such as workshops, camps and the like. We aim to make this place the meeting point of the arts, smiles Ruby.

 And the Maidan can breathe easy.

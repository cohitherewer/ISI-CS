 Multiplexes are luring away the patrons of single-screen theatres, but are not exactly killing them. The ticket prices at multiplexes are very high and most people cannot afford to spend so much on entertainment. Middle-class people visit multiplexes only once or twice a year. 

 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 

 Barasat

 Multiplexes are the latest craze among cinema-goers. Single-screen theatres, on the other hand, are battling acute financial crisis and showing signs of decadence. The reduction in the ticket prices of multiplexes could be the death knell for halls.

 Hemanta Kumar Dutta, 

 Shibpur, Howrah

 Several halls have closed down in the city in recent times. However, I don?t think multiplexes had anything to do with their shut-down. While it is irrefutable that multiplexes offer certain advantages, the disadvantages, too, cannot be overlooked. The tickets, for example, are priced beyond the reach of common people. The halls have suffered the most on account of cable television.

 Debasish Chakraborty,

 Cossipore

 Multiplexes offer more facilities than single-screen halls, though at a price. The latter are finding it increasingly difficult to run a profitable business.

 Santosh Chakravarty, 

 Unique Park

 It is impossible for multiplexes to kill single-screen halls. There aren?t enough multiplexes to cater to all cinema-goers in the city. Also, they will not be able to lower ticket prices and maintain the same service quality. The upstarts and the affluent class may throng the multiplexes, but the vast middle-class will prefer to remain satisfied with the neighbourhood halls. By sprucing up their infrastructure, single-screens can continue to flourish for a long time. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Multiplexes are for the rich, while single-screen theatres are for the middle-class and the poor. With growing affluence, more and more people are watching films at multiplexes. In the process, standalone halls are closing down.

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati

 The advent of cable television has hit single-screen halls hard. Lack of maintenance, poor sitting arrangements, bad acoustics and projection, malfunctioning airconditioners and faulty ventilation have also played their part in driving away their patrons. So far, multiplexes only have had to capitalise on the weaknesses of the single-screen halls. Their higher ticket prices are justified given the additional facilities they provide.

Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

 Multiplexes have only hastened the death of single-screen halls, which have been steadily going downhill for several years.They are in a deplorable state ? the seats are broken and infested with bugs, there is unpleasant odour inside, the toilets are unhygienic and rats abound. The patrons have to watch films in mental and physical discomfort. It is only natural that they would prefer multiplexes, even if the tickets are priced higher.

 Mahasweta Saha,

 Garia 

 I don?t think multiplexes are killing the halls. Ordinary people still prefer the latter.

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

 Most single-screen halls, except a handful, are in very poor condition and don?t even offer the basic facilities. Multiplexes are merely filling the gap between the demand and the supply. The owners of single-screen halls can bring back customers with an infrastructural boost.

B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 Definitely. The present generation prefers multiplexes for the clean surroundings, good sitting arrangements, mindboggling sound and clear screens. In comparison, most single-screen theatres are in a wretched condition ? the seats are broken and bug-infested, the airconditioners do not work and the toilets are dirty.

 Kanai Saha,

 Gauri Bari Lane

 The ticket prices at multiplexes seem a bit high, but one gets a complete entertainment package in return. On a visit to the theatre, people now look forward to much more than watching a good film. Multiplexes, naturally, are preferred by most. They will thrive till the halls are renovated. 

 Naren Sen,

 Howrah

 Multiplexes, with their wider entertainment package, have captured the imagination of the youth. However, single-screen theatres will survive till the multiplex tickets prices are slashed. Only the rich can afford the multiplex experience regularly.

 Suchanda Sen,

 Bally

 People nowadays want more options under one roof to utilise their leisure time fruitfully. Multiplexes offer the option of watching more than one movie in an evening.

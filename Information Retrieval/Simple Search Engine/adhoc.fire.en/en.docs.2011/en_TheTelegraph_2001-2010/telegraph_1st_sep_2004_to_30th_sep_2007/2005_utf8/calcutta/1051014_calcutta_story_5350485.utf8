 Six on pandal hop battered at eatery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Six youths on a pandal hop were allegedly assaulted by the employees of Sharma?s Dhaba, on Ballygunge Circular Road, at dawn on Wednesday, after an altercation over the payment of a bill that the six had run up at the eatery.

 Three of the youths were seriously injured. One of them is admitted to a south Calcutta nursing home and is in a critical condition. The owner of the dhaba and two employees have been arrested.

 ?We were travelling in two cars. We reached the dhaba around 2.30 am and ordered kebabs and rotis. After finishing the food, we asked for the bill and paid the waiter who brought it,? said Samrat Saha, one of the youths. The bill amount was Rs 136.

 The altercation started when the youths were boarding their cars after leaving the eatery. ?One of the dhaba employees came up and asked us to pay the bill. We told them that we had already paid. The man then called Lalan Singh, who owns the dhaba,? Saha recounted.

 He continued: ?Singh, along with other staff members, repeatedly kept asking us to pay the bill. We told them a number of times that our bill was cleared, but they were not ready to listen.

 ?The situation took an ugly turn when the employees started threatening us, saying: ?Yahin pe mar doonga, jaldi rupaiya nikalo? (We will kill you right here, pay up quickly). Within minutes, others, who appeared to be local residents, joined Singh and his men. We tried to convince them that we would not lie for Rs 136, but to no avail,? said Saha.

 Soon, a scuffle broke out. ?We suddenly noticed that one of the men was brandishing a chopper, while another one had the iron rod used to prepare food in the tandoor. They smashed the windscreen of our Maruti Zen and attacked us. The local residents, too, all of them drunk, joined in,? Saha added.

 The six were apparently caught off guard by the sudden attack. ?An employee hit Ajay Mehra, who was with us, on the head with the iron rod. He slumped to the ground. Before I could get to his aid, I saw another man about to attack me with a knife. He went for my neck, but I managed to evade the slash. I was, however, lacerated on the face,? said Saha. He required three stitches.

 Shouvik Bose, also in the six-member group, was beaten up. The youths alleged that their valuables were snatched during the assault.

 The entire incident occurred in 10 minutes. No one came to their rescue, the youths claimed. 

 ?Two guards from the Army office, which is just across the road, urged the assailants to stop. They did not pay any heed,? Saha recalled.

 The six went to Ballygunge police station from the spot. ?They lodged a complaint mentioning the eatery-owner?s name. We arrested Singh and two other staff members,? said K.K. Patra, officer-in-charge of Ballygunge police station.

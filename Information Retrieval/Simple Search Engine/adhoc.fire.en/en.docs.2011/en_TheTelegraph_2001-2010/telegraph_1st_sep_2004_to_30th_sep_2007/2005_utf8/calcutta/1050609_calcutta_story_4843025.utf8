 Dawn of despair: Monthly income scheme depositors wait for their turn in front of a post office 

 The photograph along with the report ?Blaze toll mounts to nine?, May 20, highlights the dangers of unsystematic wiring. 

 Fires are often caused by stove bursts and short circuits. Instead of stopping the sale of non-standard stoves, the government ignores the incidents. There also seems to be no mechanism to periodically check the wiring in offices, markets and houses. 

 In the photograph, the wires are entangled in such a way that it is impossible to identify which wire originates where. Unfortunately, almost all old offices, markets and multistoreyed buildings are connected in this manner. The insulation covering cables harden over time and start peeling off. When the exposed positive and negative wires come in contact, a short-circuit is caused, often resulting in fire. It spreads quickly because of the nature of the wiring. 

 Faulty wiring by one resident can spell doom for others. In some buildings, wires are entangled in a dangerous manner at low heights even in passages and staircases. Unfortunately, the landlords do not have the right to disconnect power supply if the wiring of a particular tenant is improper. He is, however, the one to be arrested in case of a fire due to faulty wiring. 

 The government should make it mandatory for multistoreyed buildings, office complexes, markets and even residential houses to employ licenced electricians. They will be responsible for the maintenance of the wiring and major electrical equipment, and may even recommend disconnection of supply. 

 The government should issue a rate chart so that the electricians do not take advantage of the situation. Also, electric supply authorities must double check the electricians? reports.

 Apropos the report ?Dawn vigil for the aged?, May 13, I know of a sub post office where there are three counters for MIS interest payment. The counters are open from 10 am to 4 pm. There is a computer at each counter, but the majority of the work is done manually, perhaps because of the non-uniform sizes of the pass books. 

 The central department of communication issued a circular introducing Electronic Clearance Service (ECS) in collaboration with Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, the postal department levied ?a nominal charge of Rs 20 per transaction?. This charge was not leviable if the monthly interest is credited to post office savings accounts. Would a prudent depositor forego this ?nominal charge? when most of them are totally dependent on the interest income? 

 When RBI introduced this system, it was offered free, as it is now. For decades, corporates are disbursing dividends to shareholders across the country through ECS without paying any charge. When RBI is rendering the service free, how can the postal department levy a charge on it?

 The report brutally exposes the hypocrisy prevalent in India. The state that has no qualms in squandering billions for space research, fails to increase the staff strength of post offices, forcing senior citizens to queue up for hours from the break of dawn to collect the interest from the monthly income scheme. In a rabid thirst to attain ?modernity?, the authorities are neglecting the basic needs of ordinary citizens.

 I had a talk with the postmaster of the non-delivery sub post office at Salt Lake AB block, who said on an average, the two staff members clear 500 MIS pass books in a day (between 10 am and 3 pm). Formalities like ledger entry are done in the second half of the day. The post office has about 7,000 customers who hold about 11,000 MIS pass books. I think the travails of the aged at Santoshpur post office have more to do with inefficient staff than anything else. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake. 

 It is hard to believe that in this age of information technology, the rate of work at post offices remains so abysmally slow. If this is the condition at urban post offices, I shudder to think of the scenario at rural ones. While Calcutta is being touted as a hotspot for computer companies, elderly people are being forced to stand in a queue from 4 am to collect their legitimate income. All the changes being made in the city will become meaningless if they do not benefit the residents. It is high time for the government to adopt the latest technology in workplaces and show a little more compassion and respect for the elderly. 

 Rajdeep Guha, 

 Panchanantala Road. 

 Kudos for highlighting the plight of elderly people at Santoshpur post office. The situation is similar in many small post offices in and around Calcutta. I would like to draw the attention of the human rights commission and the post master-general to the problem.

 The inhuman suffering of the senior citizens in collecting the money that is rightfully theirs is pathetic. An inquiry should be conducted into the matter and the guilty punished. 

 Kalyan Ghosh, 

 Park Street. 

 The death of the unusually overweight Lokman Hakim came as a shock. He was somehow reduced to a showpiece, and would have been far better off had his treatment started earlier. I hope that people draw a lesson from the case. In hindsight, the publicity surrounding Lokman appears inhuman. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Apropos the report ?Relay fast, exam boycott?, the university authorities were well aware that the inquiry commission report would provoke strong reaction from the students. Why then was the report made public just before the semester examinations? 

 P.C. Kar,

 Ramkrishna Park. 

 Apropos ?After Black, I wanted to do something colourful?, May 10, your focus on Ravi Chandran was commendable. The irony was while the interview carried photographs of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee, whose faces are all too familiar in the media, there wasn?t a single photograph of the person who was interviewed. 

 Prantik Sanyal,

 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road.

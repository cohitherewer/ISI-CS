 The story of the Kuruskshetra battle through the eyes of the lower-caste women who were affected by its devastation. The lives of prostitutes struggling for independence, when India was fighting for her own freedom. Four tales of oppression of helpless victims by a cruel system. All this is from the latest instalment of the English translation of Mahasveta Devi?s works.

 The launch at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre on Friday evening by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi of After Kurukshetra, Bedanabala, Wrong Number and Other Stories in the Collected Works series was followed by the first-time screening of Talking Writing. The documentary has the author in conversation about her life and work with publisher and friend Naveen Kishore.

 Speaking on the occasion, Mahasveta Devi said she was ?very happy? with the result of the efforts of translators Anjum Katyal, Sunandini Banerjee and Subhransu Maitra. ?Writing about history? she said was her endeavour, as was exploring ?between the lines?. 

 Referring to the Kurukshetra story, she said: ?We only talk about the heroes. But what about the foot soldiers?,? adding that it is important to ?read into the story and compare it to our own times. All I?ve been trying to do for years is to get people thinking.?

 The governor gave an emotional perspective of the award-winning writer?s works. ?Writing is almost incidental to you. It is the experience of life that matters. It is because you write as you speak and speak as you write that your books have such power,? he said, while describing the ?redemptive quality? of her stories.

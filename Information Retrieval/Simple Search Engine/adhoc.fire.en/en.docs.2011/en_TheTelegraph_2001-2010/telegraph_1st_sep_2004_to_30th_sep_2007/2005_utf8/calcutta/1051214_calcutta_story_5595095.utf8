 Timeout

 Enticing consumers with endless attractive incentives and schemes, the market-driven society of modern times thrives on feeding their desires and duping them into spending more than they need to. Creating compulsive buyers out of perfectly ordinary middle-class folks, the proponents of the free-market system rake in profits at the cost of these unsuspecting buyers, who are left saddled with commodities they neither require nor can afford. A satirical take on such a socio-economic scenario, Ki Nilay Faou? undertakes an imaginative exploration to the limits marketers will go towards fulfilling their ends. Full of tongue-in-cheek humour, the play introduces us to Bhabadulal, whose frenzied buying is influenced by the freebies on offer. Kochi is an insurance agent of meagre means, unable to marry his fiancee, who also has an unmarried sister. Aware of Bhabadulal?s nature, Kochi hatches a bizarre plan. He approaches Bhabadulal with a scheme, purportedly launched by his firm, which entails that a person would get a bride, plus another free, provided he buys an insurance policy with a fat premium. Direction: Subho Gupta Bhaya.

 Tolly cry to curb piracy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Troubled by rampant piracy of Bengali films, producers, distributors and exhibitors of Tollywood called for an interface on Tuesday with police and government officials to curb the menace.

 Organised by Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA), the meeting was attended by Nazrul Islam, inspector-general, enforcement branch, and Bakul Sarkar, joint director, films, state information and cultural affairs department.

 Complaints tabled by Eimpa ranged from piracy to illegal video parlours and screening of unauthorised telecast of films by cable operators. 

 ?It takes barely three to four weeks to get a new film pirated. All the last six to seven releases have been pirated. We are losing huge amounts,? complained producer distributor Vijay Khemka. The video monitoring committee formed by the state government in April 2003 has inspected around 344 cases. 

 ?We have been able to stop screening of pirated films in the districts and sub-divisions to a large extent. A good number of CDs and cassettes were also seized during these crackdowns,? said Bakul Sarkar.

 ?If someone whose copyright has been infringed comes to us with a complaint, it becomes easier for us to crack down,? said Nazrul Islam.

 Screening of pirated films by cable operators was the other thorny issue. ?The government had formed a committee to monitor cable operators but that is also not being maintained,? said Pulak Mukherjee, chairman, exhibitors? section. Eimpa is planning a meeting of the film fraternity, multi-system operators, police and government officials to address the problem.

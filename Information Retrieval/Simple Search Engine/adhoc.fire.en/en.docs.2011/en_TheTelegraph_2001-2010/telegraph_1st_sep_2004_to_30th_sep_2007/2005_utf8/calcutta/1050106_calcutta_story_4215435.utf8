Bar smoke-belchers at the gate

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Alarmed at the increase in auto emission caused by vehicles entering Calcutta from the neighbouring districts and states, the state government has decided to put up emission checkposts at four major entry points ? Kona, Dakshineswar, Barasat and Shalimar.

 Drivers will have to produce the mandatory Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates at the checkpoints, which will be manned by officials of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, transport department and traffic police.

 ?We will stop vehicles and check the PUC certificate at the entry points. Drivers who have the certificate will be allowed to proceed. Those without it will have to pay a spot fine of Rs 1,000 and they won?t be allowed to enter the city,?? elaborated pollution board member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar.

 ?We will also crosscheck the vehicle?s emission standards, but we have to equip ourselves for that,?? Sarkar added.

 According to transport department officials, nearly 200,000 vehicles, including 55,000 trucks, enter the city every day from different states and districts, and most of them do not have PUC certificates.

 ?Vehicles, especially goods carriers, enter the city from outside and leave after polluting the air. If we can check such vehicles at the entry points, the auto emission in the city will definitely be reduced,?? deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Sharma said.

 ?Though we conduct drives from time to time with pollution control board officials to check PUC certificates, a vigil at the entry points will be more effective. We are forming a special team, which will check auto-emission only. We have already procured new emission-testing machines,?? he added.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said that no vehicle, private or commercial, can ply without a PUC certificate. ?The transport department officials and the traffic police will take action against violators,?he asserted.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had recently expressed concern over emission by vehicles from outside. ?Thousands of trucks and other vehicles enter Calcutta every day and leave after polluting the city. This cannot go on. We have to take steps to curb the menace,?? he had said.

 Bhattacharjee had later asked transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and environment minister Manab Mukherjee to take effective steps to curb pollution by vehicles from outside.

 To facilitate testing of vehicles, the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) has decided to instal emission-testing machines at the Dhulagarh and Budge Budge truck terminals. ?This will benefit drivers without PUC certificates. The new testing machines will be installed soon,?? TIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee said.

 Apart from keeping a vigil at the entry points, the pollution control board, along with the traffic police, will conduct an emission-checking drive at wholesale markets and arterial roads like VIP Road, EM Bypass, BT Road and Jessore Road, officials said.

 A special team, comprising officials from the board and traffic police, has already conducted surprise auto-emission checks at different points in the city and slapped penalties on more than 300 vehicles for not having the required PUC certificates.

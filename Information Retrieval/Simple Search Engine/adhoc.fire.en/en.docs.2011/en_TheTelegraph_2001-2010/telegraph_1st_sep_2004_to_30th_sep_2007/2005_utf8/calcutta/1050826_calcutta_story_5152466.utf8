 The timeless appeal of tussar took over Kanishkas on Thursday evening with the launch of its pret line for women, as part of its 35th anniversary. Kora, the new flank of the sari boutique on Hindustan Road, was unveiled by Konkona Sen Sharma, looking stunning in a pink silk top and mauve skirt from the store. 

 Kora is contemporary in approach and we have targeted women in the 18-to-35 age group. We have used 95 per cent natural fibre and traditional techniques to print the fabrics, said Kora proprietor Prateek Raja. 

 The ready-to-wear collection flaunts a range of tops, kurtis, salwar suits, A-line and gypsy skirts, jackets and stoles in a wide palette of earthy tones, green, pink and navy blue. The outfits have been embellished with hand embroidery, kantha, mirror work, contrast lining, piping and kalamkari.

 Tussar, matka, mulmul, cotton, khadi have been used and in some of the garments, two or more fabrics have been stitched together for a stylish texture.

 Most of the embellishments are minimal so that the designs do not weigh down the texture. The focus is on silk, keeping the winter season in mind, added Prateek, who is chalking out plans to showcase the collection in New York this November.

 Step style

 To keep in step with the festive fever of the coming months, footwear brand Khadims unveiled its Puja collection with a fashion show at Peerless Inn on Wednesday.

 As Siddhartha Roy Burman, director of Khadims, launched the collection, city models Tanusree, Priyanka, Ishika, Ronita, Supratim and Abhishek sashayed down the ramp showcasing the latest assortment of footwear.

 If comfort is the key in all six segments launched, other factors like fashion trends, colour schemes and weather conditions have been taken into account while designing the range. 

 The collection includes 1,300 new designs for all age-groups.

 A lot of research and intricate detailing has gone into this new collection, says Joydeep Basu Roy, senior brand manager, Khadims.

 Prices for mens casual shoes start from Rs 100, while the more formal Executive line starts at Rs 350. 

 Women can take their pick for Rs 90-plus. Kids shoes start from Rs 50.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A matter of character

 Non-resident Bengalis would only like 

 to return to a Calcutta that takes visible pride in itself

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Brishti 

 and Riju were visiting the city of their birth after some 

 years. Like many others, they have ambivalence about Calcutta. 

 On the one hand, they have an undeniable emotional bonding 

 with the city. It still is in one sense their home. On the 

 other, they keep getting exposed to the other world. Having 

 been to many cities across many countries, their expectations 

 of urban living are no longer the same. The concerts they 

 go to, the restaurants they eat in, the art galleries they 

 frequent have, all together, set a different standard in 

 their minds. They can no longer defend Calcutta logically. 

 Their best effort often produces apologetic explanations. 

 On their past trips they have experienced erosion of their 

 bonding with the city. They could take very little back.

 It would have been no different 

 this time. Brishti and Riju were taken around the city by 

 their friends. The Rajarhat bypass, the Circular Road flyover, 

 the illumination at Millennium Park? they saw it all. There 

 were, they thought, unmistakable signs of rejuvenation. 

 Yet, by global standards, they were too little. These were 

 hardly the things that they could boast of when they return.

 And then it happened. One day 

 they were driving down the stretch from Gol Park to CC amp;FC. 

 They saw the ads on the huge hoardings. They were mostly 

 in vernacular. Their language was very modern and lyrical. 

 The models in the ads looked distinctly local but unmistakably 

 fashionable. Be it the ad for a jewellery shop or a condominium 

 in New Town ? all of them celebrated ethnicity. Brishti 

 and Riju were delighted; they had never experienced such 

 visible pride of Calcutta in itself, in its own character.

 Another day, they planned an evening 

 out with some old friends. Being early diners they first 

 went to one of the new eateries of Calcutta. The dining 

 experience bowled them over. A bottle of vintage French 

 wine to go with dab chingri and ghee bhaat 

 was something they had not experienced ever, anywhere. Most 

 importantly, they were not apologies of their originals. 

 The dishes served had all the flavours of their grandmother?s 

 kitchen. The evening ended with a movie in a comfortable 

 auditorium in one of the new cineplexes. This is as good 

 as they ever got in any city of the world with all the additional 

 pleasures of belongingness. 

 The couple had only one regret 

 ? the dab chingri still had to be ordered in English. 

 The name tag of the steward disclosed his mother tongue 

 but he still did not use that to reply to a question in 

 that language. He was possibly trained not to. Indeed, during 

 another evening in one of the social clubs, Riju had to 

 wear closed shoes and socks, shirts with collar, etc. The 

 lingua franca there was distinctly alien. Vernacular has 

 not yet been given membership of this Calcutta.

 Maybe that will be our next stage. 

 Like in Paris or in Frankfurt, some day we will also be 

 able to order food in our mother tongue in a fashionable 

 Calcutta eatery. Some day at the airport, to the lady at 

 the check-in counter we may be able to speak in the local 

 lingo. Some day we will be allowed to enjoy a summer evening 

 in a social club wearing our designer churidar kurta 

 and kolhapuri sandals. Having come this far, 

 it will be a pity not to reach there. Our heritage deserves 

 the effort and our culture the respect. 

 Then, may be then, the Brishtis 

 and Rijus will make this city their home again.

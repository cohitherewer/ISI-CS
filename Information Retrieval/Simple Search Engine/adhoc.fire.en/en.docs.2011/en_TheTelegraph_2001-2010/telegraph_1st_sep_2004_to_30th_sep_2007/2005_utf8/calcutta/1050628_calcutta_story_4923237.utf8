The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Card for car book arrives

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Monday started distribution of smart cards to the owners of old cars in Calcutta. 

 The cards will replace the registration certificates or blue books.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty inaugurated the process at the public vehicles directorate (PVD) office in the morning. 

 ?I?m happy our city has taken a lead in issuing the smart cards. We will gradually introduce the system across the state,? said Chakraborty.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said that after the cards replacing blue books were issued to the owners of all eight lakh vehicles in the city, the department would start replacing the driving licences. The entire process, he estimated, will take around six months.

 The PVD will have to issue around 20 lakh smart cards in Calcutta ? five lakh for registration certificates and the rest for driving licences. 

 Minister Chakraborty promised car-owners that the cards would be handed over to them within 10 minutes of submitting applications.

 A transport department official explained that a four-KB micro chip is embedded in a smart card, which is of the size of a credit card. 

 The card for the registration certificate contains details of the vehicle, while that for the licence will store details of the driver and the period of validity. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee launched the distribution of smart cards at Writers? Buildings in November last year. 

 Around 1.25 lakh cards have already been issued to owners of new vehicles.

 An applicant seeking a smart card for a registration certificate will have to pay Rs 340 as ?Webel charges?, plus Rs 230. 

 For conversion of the driving licence, an applicant will have to cough up Rs 140 as ?Webel charges? and a fee of Rs 220.

 Fake sleuth, con groom

 - Families swindled by smooth phoney posing as CBI officer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Arun Mukherjee, 37, had an appetite for money. And the surest way to lay his hands on it, he thought, was to respond to matrimonial advertisements and present himself before the parents of prospective brides as an upwardly mobile law-enforcer.

 But his dream run came to an abrupt halt on Thursday, when he found himself handcuffed by those whose identity he had assumed to fleece unsuspecting victims.

 ?We have been looking for him for some time, but it seemed that luck was on his side,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department. ?He was on his way to trap the next target when we got to lay our hands on him.?

 Singh added: ?We had been on his trail after two families in Muchipara lodged complaints. Both were duped by him in the past month.?

 Elaborating on the modus operandi of Mukherjee, a resident of Howrah, the deputy commissioner said: ?He would scan the matrimonial advertisements in various newspapers and draw up a list of phone numbers, especially mobile phone numbers, of the families looking for a groom.?

 He would then send messages to those numbers, posing as a prospective groom who was either a CBI officer or an inspector of the directorate-general of security (cabinet secretariat). 

 ?When the girls? families contacted him, he would set an appointment and meet them,? said an officer on the case. 

 In the course of conversation, Mukherjee would earn their sympathy by saying that he was the only child of his parents, who had been killed in an accident. 

 ?The way he spoke, the girls? families found no reason to suspect him. Most parents were led to believe that Mukherjee was the perfect match for their daughters,? the officer added.

 Mukherjee would start his operation only after he convinced himself that his target had swallowed his bait.

 Thereafter, he would often visit the girls? families and strike up a special relationship with them. Once, he told a family in Muchipara that he had been injured in the head while conducting a raid and that he needed money for treatment. 

 He told the girl?s parents that his salary would be deposited in his Delhi account while he was on leave and that he would pay back shortly.

 The family took his words at face value and gave Mukherjee Rs 70,000 and a diamond ring. ?They found nothing amiss, as Mukherjee had even signed the marriage registration papers,? the officer said. Another family was fleeced of Rs 65,000.

 Following the complaints, police obtained Mukherjee?s photographs from the families he had targeted and launched a hunt. ?We started calling the numbers mentioned in the matrimonial advertisements in newspapers. We could locate a family in Kakdwip, who had received a call from CBI officer Rahul Mukherjee,? the officer said.

 A trap was laid and Mukherjee walked into it.

 See no evil, hear no evil: Bandh supporters stop a commuter from going to work 

 Apropos the item ?Campus protest? in The City Diary on October 1, it is shocking that the students of the Hindi department of Presidency College have engaged themselves in virulent protest against the decision of the government and the college authorities to transfer one of their teachers. 

 Why can?t the students trust the government and college authorities? decision in matters as important as the transfer and appointment of lecturers? 

 The students have every right to express their preference for a particular teacher, but how could they dare to boycott classes, disrupt proceedings of the college and start a fast-unto-death? They did not even desist from blocking the busy College Street, causing chaos, confusion and endless harassment for commuters. 

 The students of the department have set an extremely bad example, which, if emulated by others, could pin the last nail in the coffin of state?s education system. 

 Not long back, students of Jadavpur University and Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute had resorted to agitation and protest against the authorities. 

 In future, the government should deal with such campus turmoil with a firm hand. An ultimatum should be served to the students. If they want to continue their education, they will have to abide by the rules and regulations of their institute.

 Apropos the report ?Bandh Buddha turns deaf ear?, September 29, it was only expected that the chief minister would feign deafness when faced with unpleasant queries on bandhs. Unfortunately his attitude is not going to enthuse foreign investors or help in any way to bring back work culture to the state. The act also betrayed the chief minister?s deep apathy to the harassment faced by the ordinary people. The bandh is going to create more problems than it will solve, but then it will also help Bhattacharjee earn ballot brownie points next year. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 Buddhababu?s silence on bandh-eve could have been sarcastic. It might also have been enforced by his party?s archaic disciplinary code. While the chief minister goes from door to door seeking investment for the state, the politburo members and the Alimuddin Street bosses are bent on making his task uphill. The September 29 bandh was a cruel blow to the state?s industrialisation dreams. If the politburo butts in at every step then the chief minister would find it difficult to boost the state economy. Belated realisation of follies by his colleagues will not be of any use. It is high time the Left shuns its negativism and dogma.

 It is a measure of the bandh?s success that even the chief minister decided to keep his ears closed (bandh). The shutdown policy boomeranged, as highlighted by the next day?s headline: ?Bandh boomerangs as Buddha?s wife faces CPM mob?s might?. We can only pity the chief minister.

 Apropos the report ?Tech township in tatters?, September 30, it is a bitter truth that hooligans had a field day during the September 29 bandh. All because of the tacit support of the ruling parties. It is unfortunate that the rulers of the state are under the misconception that investors will flock to Bengal knowing fully well that bandhs are a part of life here. Are we supposed to conclude that work culture is just a nice expression?

 The growth of the IT sector in Bengal suffered a tremendous setback on September 29. Infosys chief N.R. Narayana Murthy had praised the facilities here the day before. He must have reconsidered his opinion by now. 

 Over-confidence on the part of the administration worsened the situation. The steps taken by state governments in Bangalore and Hyderabad only made the Bengal government?s failures more glaring. Bandhs continue to be the acid test of the latter?s commitment to industrialisation. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala. 

 Apropos ?Maharaj menu for Marines?, October 3, the constant publicity given to anything associated with Sourav Ganguly has contributed to the erosion of his form. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report ?Shining in school, not by books?, September 30, Palash Mondol?s achievements are remarkable and ought to serve as an inspiration to the students Holy Child, where he works.

 Apropos ?Hidden eyes on the bridge?, October 4, it is most welcome that the Port Trust has taken the initiative to instal close-circuit cameras on the Howrah bridge. The move will surely help the Port Trust and the police identify and punish those who damage the bridge. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Apropos the report ?Call for law against use of ajinomoto?, October 5, any food item that harms our health must be banned. Japan and China have already banned the use of the chemicals in food. Why is India lagging behind? 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos ?Mega puja in jeopardy?, September 2, there is no feud between the Bengal Secretariat Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank amp; Housing Society and the Jodhpur Park Institute. The dispute started between the society and the Jodhpur Park Saradiya Utsab Committee (JPSUC) when we did not let the latter use our address ? 1D, Jodhpur Park ? as its registered address. But the institute was authorised to use our address. 

 The claim of JPSUC that this year is their 53rd year of puja is false. The committee was registered only in 1994, while the institute was registered in 1967. We, on the other hand, were registered in 1945. 

 We do not want to stop the puja, as misunderstood by S. Roy. We want a puja to happen but will not allow unlawful organisations like JPSUC to conduct the puja. JPI, being a subsidiary body of the society, has no authority to go against the society?s wishes. 

 Aloke Kumar,

 convener, research and development committee, Bengal Secretariat Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank and Housing Society Ltd.

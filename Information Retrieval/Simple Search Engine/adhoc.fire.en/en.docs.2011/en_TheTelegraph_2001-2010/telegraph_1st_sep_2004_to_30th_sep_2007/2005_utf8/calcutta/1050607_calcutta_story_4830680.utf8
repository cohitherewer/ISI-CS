 Curbs amp; checks on monkey business 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 With cases of monkeys attacking humans on the rise in and around the city, the forest authorities are drawing up an action plan to control the primate population.

 ?The increase in the number of monkeys is the prime reason for conflicts between man and monkey. We are in the process of finding out ways of curbing the population,? V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden of the state forest department, said on Sunday.

 The steps include increasing the natural food base of monkeys in the forest areas, creating awareness, sterilising monkeys and improving solid waste management. 

 In the past few months, there have been several cases of monkeys attacking humans, destroying orchards and crops and creating panic. 

 Two types of monkeys ?rhesus and langur ? are found in abundance around the city and the adjoining areas alongside the Hooghly bank. From Jadavpur, Golf Green, Budge Budge, Baruipur and Behala in the south to Dum Dum and Barrackpore in the north, and Howrah and Hooghly districts, monkey population is rising.

 A troop of 70 to 80 langurs in the Dakshineswar area takes shelter in the nearby Wimco match factory at night. ?During the day, they crowd around the temple. Some frequent Rishra, Serampore, Dum Dum, Barrackpore and other places,? said Yadav. At night they return to the factory. 

 Similarly, a gang of around 40 langurs is marauding the mango and guava orchards and agricultural crops in Hooghly. Another group of 50 langurs is running amok in Sankrail and other parts of Howrah, injuring people and creating panic. 

 ?Lack of proper solid waste management, too, is a major problem. These monkeys gather near garbage vats to feed themselves,? said an official. 

 Rogue monkeys are a cause for concern to the authorities. ?An alpha male monkey often fights with other males to hold sway over the group. This leads to one of the male monkeys turning rogue,? explained an officer. The monkey then has to be tranquillised.

 To combat this trend, a detailed survey will be conducted to find out about the primate population and reasons for their invading urban and suburban localities, identify areas where they carry out depredation and suggest remedial measures. 

 On Monday, a tranquilisation programme was organised in Garchumuk, Howrah.

 ?We will seek the advice of experts on sterilisation before implementing any scheme,? a forest official said. A detailed report will be prepared and sent to the state government and Union ministry of environment and forest.

 Exploring a musical heritage

 Music has the power to soothe our souls and elevate us to a sublime state of being. Hosted by Srijan?s Listeners? Forum, this evenings musical session features Manilal Nag (picture along), the celebrated sitar maestro, who traces the heritage of the Vishnupur gharana.

Through the rarest of recordings and musical reminiscences, evoking a sense of romantic nostalgia, the master sitarist shares with his audience how the Vishnupuri strain, the only one to have its origin in Bengal, was nurtured and evolved through the efforts of generations of classical musicians Jadu Bhatta, Nityanand Goswami, Jnanendra, Anantalal Bandopadhyay, Satyakinkar, Ramaprasanna, Govinda Nag and Gokul Nag. Conceived and anchored by Mita Nag.

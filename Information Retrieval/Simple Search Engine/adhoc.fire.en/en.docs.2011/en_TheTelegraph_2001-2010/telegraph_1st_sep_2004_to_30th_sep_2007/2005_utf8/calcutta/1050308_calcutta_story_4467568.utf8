The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Don?t expect Salman-Ash back on screen?

SPOT THE DIFFERENCE: (From top) Salman Khan 

and Aishwarya Rai in a moment from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam;Salman with Sneha 

Ullal in Lucky: No Time For Love 

 How different was the world of cinema from 

that of music videos?

 The world was pretty much the same. Only, the film was much longer than a music video. The stress was always on only one thing ? to deliver a hit at the end of it all.

 The promos of the film look very 

glossy. Are you trying to induct the school of music videos into films?

 No, we are not exactly trying to recreate the world of music videos in the film. It is the demand of the script. Nothing deliberate on our part.

 So what is Lucky?

 Lucky: No Time For Love is a love story with a fable quality. We liked the story, decided to make a film on it and went on to write the script. It has a damsel in distress. It also has a knight in shining armour. It?s like a fairy tale. This also happens to be Salman?s (Khan) first home production with an outside director. His brother, Sohail Khan, has previously directed most of their home productions.

 How did you get Salman to produce 

the film?

 We wanted Salman to play the hero. We went over to his house with our bound script. Luckily, he was there. After the narration, he just stood up, shook our hands and said: ?Congratulations! I?m doing your film.? Then we told him that we haven?t yet got producers for the film. He asked us not to worry and promised us that everything will be worked out. The very next day, we got a call from his office saying everything has been arranged.

 So, it is kind of a fairy tale for 

two of you, too?

 Yes, it is like a fairy tale for us, as well. We are very lucky to get Salman in our kitty. We have no filmi background. We didn?t even have a producer backing us. So, we?ve been lucky.

 Why did you go for Adnan Sami to 

do the music?

 Music plays a very important role in our film. We had a specific rhythm and arrangement in our minds. We heard a couple of music directors and didn?t like their work. Then we met Adnan and in five days we finalised most of the songs with him.

 What made you sign Mithun Chakraborty 

in Lucky?

 We had this very important character in the film which was a parallel role to that of Salman. But we didn?t want a character actor because that wouldn?t have worked. Now, Mithun Chakraborty is a superstar himself apart from being a fantastic actor. So we went to meet him in Ooty. Before that Salman had already called him and put in a word for us. So, once in Ooty, we gave him a narration of the script and he was on board straightaway.

 So, does Mithun play the villain 

in the film?

 (Laughs). Mithunda is the best-kept secret of Lucky. So we can?t really say much about his character in the film. You have to wait for the release to find out more on that.

 n Why did you choose Russia as the backdrop?

 Lucky is the first Indian film to be shot in Russia. And by Russia, we do not mean Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. We mean proper Russia. We shot the film in St. Petersburg. The script demanded a fairy-tale setting. 

 Russia was just the right place for us ? away from the regular humdrum of life. Even in places like Switzerland and Australia we get so many Indian faces everywhere. But not so with Russia, where we could shoot the film without any Indian hangover whatsoever.

 The most written-about member of 

your entire production cast and crew is Lucky?s leading lady, Sneha Ullal. 

How and where did you two discover her?

 Even the girl?s character?s name is Lucky. The film is titled after the heroine. We needed a newcomer to play the role of Lucky and Salman did not have any issues with that. 

 Along with the film?s co-producers, the T-Series people, we did a nationwide search for which we came to Calcutta, went to Delhi and Chennai but couldn?t find anybody to our liking. Salman knew about this struggle of ours. He asked us to check out Sneha Ullal, who happened to be a collegemate of his sister, Arpita. Sneha came to meet us and we auditioned her like other girls. She just seemed perfect for the role and we signed her on.

 She is being touted as an Aishwarya 

Rai-lookalike. Was that a reason for signing her on?

 Not at all. In the first place, we don?t think that she looks like Ash. Sneha is just an 18-year-old newcomer. And Ash, of course, is one of Bollywood?s biggest leading ladies who is almost on the threshhold of an international breakthrough. 

 I think it?s a little bit unfair on the part of the media to keep comparing Sneha with Aishwarya. Also, the people shouldn?t go to the theatres expecting Salman and Ash to be back together on the big screen.

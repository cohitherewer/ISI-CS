Life

 Pretty space for precious pieces 

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 A stylish dressing table displaying a neat assortment of cosmetics, expensive perfumes and accessories stashed away either in an old, worn-out pouch that you got during a previous jewellery purchase, or in an old chocolate box. And if the whole effect is somewhat dulled, blame it on a small, drab bag or a faded box.

 So, if youre thinking of discarding that dowdy jewellery holder, the Archies gallery at City Centre deserves a dekko.

 Attractive imported glass jewellery boxes are found in shapes of hearts and rectangles. A border with a sparkling silver finish makes for quite an ornate effect. 

 A chromium polish and a coat of lacquer ensure that the edges dont black out and hence promise longevity of the look, says Gautam Shroff of Archies.

 Those with a frosted glass cover are embellished with a bouquet of tiny pink roses and leaves tied with a golden ribbon at one side.

 A heart-shaped case with a combination of frosted and transparent glass is a definite eye catcher. This too is embellished with intricate flowery motifs.

 Where

 Archies at City Centre

 How much

 Jewellery boxes start at Rs 550, the holders at Rs 399

With the wedding season on, these boxes make good gift options. They stand out because of their fine finish and detailing, adds Shroff.

 To complete the set there are cosmetic holders with the same look. These ornate broad-mouthed holders are ideal for stocking lipsticks, kajals and eyeliners, as well as hairpins and scrunchies. 

 The hexagonal or square holders have alternate surfaces of textured and frosted glass. They come entwined with bright stone flowers and leaves.

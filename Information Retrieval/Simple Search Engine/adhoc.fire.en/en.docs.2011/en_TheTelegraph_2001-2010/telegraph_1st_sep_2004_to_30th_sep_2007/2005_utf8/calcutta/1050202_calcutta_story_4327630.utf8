The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kin in wait for news of tourists

 OUR BUREAU

 The state of emergency in Nepal has triggered a mini crisis in some city homes, with no word of or from the Calcuttans stranded in the Himalayan kingdom.

 At least 250 tourists from the city are said to be in Nepal, where telephone lines have been cut, flights cancelled and the media muzzled.

 Hundreds of anxious relatives called the airport authorities, airline offices and travel agents, desperately seeking news of travellers to Nepal.

 By Tuesday evening, Indian Airlines officials said they would operate the flight to Kathmandu on Wednesday as per schedule.

 ?We were initially cautious, but we have now decided to operate on schedule,? an official explained.

 With a cloak of secrecy descending on the tourist draw, travel agencies reported about 50 cancellations in bookings on the day yet another political crisis broke in Nepal.

 ?Many Calcuttans went to Nepal for a short holiday between January 23 and January 26. Currently, there are at least 250 tourists from Calcutta in Nepal. Most of them were planning to come back on February 6,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (eastern region), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Sanjay Tamang, a city-based businessman, was frantically trying to get in touch with his younger sister Nilima, who left for Nepal last Tuesday along with her husband and one-year-old daughter.

 ?I last spoke to Nilima on Saturday. After watching the news on TV, I?ve tried to call her several times, but in vain. My 80-year-old mother has fallen ill with anxiety,? said Tamang.

 In south Calcutta, Kasturi Dasgupta, a housewife in her late twenties, is anxiously awaiting news of her husband, an advertising executive in Kathmandu.

 ?The worst thing is that there is no news. I?ve tried his number since morning; now I?m told all the lines have been jammed,? she said.

 The Nepal tourism market from Calcutta has dwindled from Rs 30 crore in 2001 to Rs 10.58 crore in 2004, but it remains a significant holiday destination.

 ?We are still not clear about the details of our tourists there, but the Central government is in touch with the Nepal government,? said home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, adding that the Bengal government had issued an alert along the border.

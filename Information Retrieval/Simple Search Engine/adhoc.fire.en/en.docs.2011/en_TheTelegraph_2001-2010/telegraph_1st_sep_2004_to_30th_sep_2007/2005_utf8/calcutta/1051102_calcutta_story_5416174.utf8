 Hugli, the lifestyle store at Hastings Court, has come up with a whole new line of festive buys. This includes elegant pieces for the home as well as the wardrobe.

 Pretty skirts with asymmetrical hemlines and straight cuts adorn the racks. From crushed full sleeves to plain short sleeves, there is a variety of tops to choose from. Exclusive saris and suits with intricate detailing catch ones attention, too. 

 Bright hues complement the revelry all around. Most of my ensembles are in silk, though I am stocking some cottons too, says Madhulika Khaitan, proprietor of Hugli. 

 There are table accessories like kantha table mats embellished with nature motifs and matching napkin holders. One also comes across nut bowls, tea sets, dishes and other homeware in silver.

 The showstealers have to be the handmade paper and woven lamp shades in earthy hues. Also on offer are bamboo trays, photo frames, vases in abstract forms and a host of other knick-knacks.

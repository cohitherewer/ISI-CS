 Mayor orders market overhaul

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The day after a roof slab collapsed at New Market, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya announced that the entire estate would be overhauled in collaboration with private partners.

 In 1986, after large parts of the market were ravaged in a fire, then mayor Kamal Kumar Bose had ordered that the north-western part be rebuilt. 

 On Monday, minutes after meeting shop-owners, the mayor directed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to initiate the process of inviting expressions of interest from private developers for the makeover of the 120-year-old heritage structure, formally known as Sir Stuart Hogg Market.

 The meeting, also attended by civic engineers and police, decided to set up a committee to explore the feasibility of short-term repairs in the affected parts. The committee will comprise two civic assistant engineers, the officer-in-charge of New Market police station and two representatives of the shop-owners.

 Sources said the New Market overhaul would be on the lines of the Star theatre revamp, carried out during the tenure of Subrata Mukherjee.

 The civic authorities are banking on the height of the market complex, spread over 10 bighas, to rope in private parties for the revamp. 

 ?The market can easily be turned into a two-storeyed structure without disturbing its heritage character,? said a senior engineer.

 The authorities are eyeing an eight-cottah plot on the north-east corner, lying vacant since the demolition of the staff quarters six years ago, for a possible extension of the market.

 The main problem at present seems to be encroachment by traders. According to an estimate by the civic body, around 70 per cent of the pathways in the market had been encroached by traders. The encroachments were later legalised by the authorities.

 Despite the ?neglect? of the civic authorities, New Market still tops the list of 200-odd city markets in dimension, style, heritage, diversity in merchandise and quality.

 More than 50,000 customers visit the market daily and purchase goods worth around Rs 1 crore. 

 During winter, especially Christmas, New Market has always been a coveted place for cakes, said Pradip Chakravorty, general secretary of the Sir Stuart Hogg Market Shopkeepers Welfare Association.

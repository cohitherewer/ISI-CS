 Coastal India evokes images of magnificent beaches, lush backwaters, swaying palm trees and lip-smacking food. And cooking up coastal fare right here in Calcutta is Porto Rio, the speciality seafood restaurant on Circus Avenue. The restaurant is hosting a coastal food festival till November 20.

 To begin with, there are the usual starters like Chicken Afghani Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Chicken in Fire Sauce to choose from.

 But the coastal magic starts only once you move to the main course. Barbecue Bhetki, Pomfret Richardo, Lobster Coondapuri, Stuffed Squid and Steamed Shorshe Boneless Hilsa are some of the delights on offer.

 The Crab Hariyali steals the show with the whole crab cooked in a mixture of coriander, herbs and spices, barbecued on a slow fire. 

 For your breads, you can choose from the Neer Dosa or the Hariyali Naan.

 The dishes are priced between Rs 150 and Rs 600.

 Apart from usual mocktails like Pink Heaven, Pinacolada and Blue Lagoon, there are some south Indian drinks like Soul Kudhi (a speciality of Kerala made with curd, tamarind and coriander).

 Oriental bite

 Baan Thai, the Thai speciality restaurant at The Oberoi Grand, is playing host to Tantalising Indonesia, a festive offering for food lovers of Calcutta. On till November 6, the festival presents some rare delicacies from the south-east Asian country.

 Says executive chef George K. George: We are leaving the flavour of the food intact and preparing it in authentic Indonesian style. Each dish is distinct in taste. This is part of our effort to bring to Calcuttans the best of world cuisine.

 Non-vegetarians can start with Nasi Goreng (traditional Indonesian stir-fried rice with chicken, shrimps, greens and tomato sambal, topped with fried egg and served with chicken satay, shrimp crackers and peanut sauce) or Mi Goreng Java (stir-fried noodles with greens, topped with bean sprouts and fried shallots).

 Vegetarians can order Nasi Kuning (turmeric-flavoured rice with coconut milk and lemon grass).

 To go with this, one can opt for Sayur Lodeh (assortment of seasonal vegetables in coconut milk flavoured with chilli, coriander and galangal), Ayam Panggang Bumbu Kuning (yellow spiced grilled chicken from Java) and Udung Peddas (stir-fried prawn and Edamamae with chilli, chives and tomato).

 Other dishes to look out for are Opor Ayam (chicken cooked in coconut milk with tamarind, cumin, pepper and ginger), Dadar Isi (Indonesian omelette with a choice of chicken, pork or seafood filling) and Ikan Bumbu Bali (Balinese spiced deep-fried whole pomfret topped with tamarind, lemon grass and sweet soya).

 The Indonesian platter on offer for both lunch and dinner costs Rs 1,200-plus for two people.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Back track

 Please don?t take pictures here,? Onirban cringes. Back to his alma mater Jadavpur University, the director of the acclaimed My Brother? Nikhil is flush with pleasure as well as embarrassment. 

 Settling down at the Amenity Centre, the 37-year-old starts stock-taking. ?We have recovered costs,? he says. That in itself is an achievement for a film with ?zero cast made by a nobody?. The film, on a swimmer afflicted with AIDS, is perhaps the most sensitive portrayal of same-sex relationship in Indian cinema. It is being talked about internationally, with a review in the revered New York Times. The result is an invitation to the San Francisco Film Festival in June. Festivals in Brazil, Singapore and Germany want the film too. 

 Onir is excited about a call from Cannes. ?Though it?s quite late for entry, I hope something works out.?

 Onir is clearly not comfortable pushing for promotion. ?A film like My Brother? Nikhil depends on word of mouth. What do I do if a newspaper writes after three days that it is a flop?? Nikhil?s Friday war was fought with the star-studded Tango Charlie, pitting 300-400 prints against all of 31. ?They never bothered to check the logistics.? 

 Onir, who bunked his MA finals to take up a scholarship in Germany, has twin grouses against the system. People, he says, are all for sensitive cinema. But the support does not come from the exhibitors or the audience.

 The result is veering away from his own script on another hard-hitting subject. Though he ?cannot do a song-and-dance film?, Onir plans to have ?serious fun? in his next project. Sanjay Suri stays in the lead. He is on the lookout for a fresh female face for his ?love story with layers?. 

 On Thursday, he is off to Shillong to show the film to the army. ?Assam has high AIDS density among women,? he explains. 

 Commerce may have failed him, but Onir cannot fail his cause.

 IPSITA DEB EXPLORES THE TRINKETS THAT ADD VALUE TO THE INTERIORS

 Call them charms, trinkets, knick-knacks, Chi-enhancers or what you will. Every home has some of these embellishing nooks and crannies. While some of us focus on the placement of these objects with reference to Feng Shui and Vaastu, others merely use them as showpieces.

 Goodlife explores ways in which charms can be used to best effect.

 Bright beam 

 Bringing light into your life through natural or artificial means is recommended by all energy-enhancing sciences. Placing lamps, lanterns and candles in your favourable directions is a good way of doing this. Mirrors, too, are very effective as they help bring a pleasant view into the room, multiply abundance, activate stagnant energy in dark corners and hallways and deflect negative energy.

 ?Crystals, with their ability to tap suns rays and break them into the seven colours of the rainbow, enhance positive energy. Candles, too, are great stimulants for any desired aspect, especially passion,? says Feng Shui expert Pinky Kapoor. 

 Sound signs 

 According to Feng Shui, wind chimes and bells are known to add bursts of Yang energy to either deflect bad luck or enhance good luck by channelising the chi through the hollows of the rods. Feng Shui apart, the tinkle of wind chimes or bells lend a happy feel to a room and are a great way of welcoming guests when hung on doorways. 

 ?My mother loves wind chimes and we have an abundance of these in our home, picked up from Singapore and Kathmandu,? says actress Rituparna Sengupta.

 The wooden or metals chimes are known to be the most effective ones. The effect also depends on the number of rods in a chime. While the five-rod metal ones denote the deflection of poison arrows, the wooden counterparts ward off the ill-effects of beams. Eight-rod wooden ones enhance health and financial luck, while six or seven-rod metal chimes are beneficial for career pursuits.

 Nature nugget

 The bamboo has been the symbol of good fortune in Asian culture for ages. Believed to inspire art and creativity, its presence brings fortune to a home. ?Bamboo is a symbol of longevity, durability and endurance due to its ability to adapt and grow in minimal light conditions. Carrying the element of wood, it has an influence on energy, growth, vitality, and physical activity,? says Kapoor.

 Here too, like the chimes, the number of stalks has varying significance. Three attracts happiness, four wealth, seven good health and so on.

 ?We do follow Vaastu while designing a home, but I dont encourage using objects to create an artificial environment. The common charms are crystals, fountains, paintings and money drawers,? says interior designer Manjari Sahay. 

 A well-placed fountain can enhance financial luck as flowing water symbolises money flow. Placed near the front door, the falling water is believed to deflect negative chi. ?Fish bowls and floating candles, too, are good for a house,? says interior designer Anita Mansatta.

 Idol effect

 The most popular Feng Shui artefact and a much-loved gift, the Laughing Buddha is again a sign of prosperity and good luck. While some merely like the look of the pot-bellied Buddha, others value it for its ability to attract wealth and even rub its tummy everyday for better results. 

 ?The happy demeanour of the Laughing Buddha is an excellent cure for depression,? says Kapoor. 

 Another favourite charm in this segment is the Ganesha. The elephant-faced god is symbolic of siddhi (success in undertakings) and buddhi (intelligence). This idol, placed at the entrance of a house, removes obstacles and ensures success. 

 Legend amp; lore

 Legend has it that since horses were considered to be one of the most sacred animals, their crescent-shaped shoes became symbols of good luck. They were nailed outside the thresholds of houses to ward off witches and evil spirits. However, while hanging a horseshoe outside the door, one must ensure that the heels point upwards as the opposite will result in ill luck.

 According to Chinese lore, a string of uniquely-shaped coins symbolises an inexhaustible source of income. These coins have a square in the centre representing the energy of the earth and a circle representing the Chi of heaven. This union is most effective when placed in the north-west. 

 Another mythological charm is the dream-catcher, which Americans believe has the power to ward off bad dreams. Given as gifts to newly-weds or children, it is believed that if the dream-catcher is hung above a sleeping child, it would attract all dreams before they entered the childs head. Since bad dreams are unable to follow directions, they would get entangled in the web, while good dreams will follow the path of the design and slide down the feather to the child. 

 Animal aura 

 Figures of animals and birds often fill up cabinets in our homes. While most people display them for plain show value, these have beneficial effects when placed carefully.

 Figures of horses are considered very lucky and to dream of the animal or to see one (even in the object form) is believed to bring luck. The dragon symbolises good luck for the Chinese, while the turtle is believed to enhance longevity.

 Office shift fuels sleuth discontent

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Enforcement Branch officers fear the impending shift of their office from 12, Ballygunge Circular Road to Tantuja Bhavan, in Salt Lake, will cripple investigation and associated work.

 Citing an example, they said that with the daily allotment of six litres of petrol, it will be an uphill task, bordering on the impossible, for them to conduct raids across the city from an office in Salt Lake, which, incidentally, falls under the state police. 

 Limited car fuel is not the only resource constraint the department faces. The lock-up of the enforcement branch is now lodged at Ballygunge police station. 

 After the office moves to the new address, the lock-up, too, will be relocated in Ultadanga thana.

 Officers involved in regular investigation said the distance between the new office and the new lock-up would pose a problem in ?handling the accused?, which includes interrogation.

 Defending the move to shift the office, senior officers of the city force said the Ballygunge building was in such a state that the department could no longer function from it.

 ?The proposal has been cleared, but it will take some more time to effect the shift,? said C.V. Muralidhar, additional commissioner of police. ?We are working out the process. The present building is dilapidated and collapsing.?

 S.K. Pujari, deputy commissioner (enforcement branch) said: ?Minor problems are bound to occur whenever an office is relocated, but they are eventually sorted out. I have visited Tantuja Bhavan and am seeing to it that the changeover takes place smoothly.? 

 A major problem to vex sleuths once the Salt Lake office is operational relates to transport. 

 Officers fear that unless the daily release of fuel is increased, the entire process of investigation, raids and arrests will be in jeopardy.

 The department?s jurisdiction runs through the entire city, right up to Tollygunge. 

 Apart from seizing illegal commodities and arresting the accused, officers have the added responsibility of producing the accused in courts and taking them to hospitals.

 All these will have to be performed, from a faraway place, with the same allotment of vehicle fuel.

 ?The idea of shifting the office of a Calcutta Police department to an area manned by the state force is ridiculous,? pointed out an officer. ?It will be impossible for us to carry out our duty from Salt Lake.?

 Another area where the department may face problems is escorting arrested persons. According to the procedure, an accused has to be lodged in a Calcutta police station nearest to the office. 

 After the shift, the nearest city police station will be in Ultadanga. From there, the accused will have to be taken to Tantuja Bhavan daily for interrogation and other investigation purposes.

 Another officer pointed out that the new office does not even have a proper interrogation room.

 ?Escorting the accused to our office and back to the police station will be a waste of time and resources,? the officer added.

 The City Diary

 The high court on Thursday ordered Calcutta Police to reinstate Jayanta Sikdar, who was sacked as sergeant on grounds of indiscipline seven years ago. Sikdar, who was in former chief minister Jyoti Basu?s security team, was dismissed after a woman alleged that he had duped her with a false promise of marriage. The division bench of Justices A.K. Ganguli and Tapan Kumar Dutt also ruled that the government would have to pay 50 per cent of the salary due to Sikdar over the past seven years.

 The woman had complained to Basu?s confidential assistant Joykrishna Ghosh that Sikdar, her ex-husband?s friend, had promised to marry her after her divorce. The two had lived together in several places, including New Delhi?s Banga Bhavan, as husband and wife. However, Sikdar later denied the relationship.

 hosh forwarded the complaint to the police authorities, and Sikdar was dismissed after inquiries ?revealed that the charges were true?. Sikdar then moved the State Administrative Tribunal, which declined to accept his petition.

 Advanced Medical Research Institute (AMRI) was accused of negligence after the death of a patient, Nanigopal Panda, on Thursday. Panda, 46, a Kakdwip resident, was admitted to the hospital with diabetes a few days ago. Dissatisfied with the treatment, his relatives wanted to shift him to Vellore. But the hospital authorities allegedly dissuaded them from shifting the patient. The relatives claimed that the death was caused by air bubbles in saline bottles. AMRI president S.B. Purkayastha denied the allegation. ?The patient was bedridden and suffering from uncontrollable diabetes. He suffered a cardiac arrest, not unusual in such cases,? Purkayastha said.

 One man was arrested in Behrampur, Murshidabad, on Wednesday night and two of his accomplices were netted in Sovabazar on Thursday in connection with a robbery at a jewellery shop on Nimtalla Ghat Street on August 12. Police said five persons were involved in the case. 

 A group of people blocked the crossing of Nemat Mahal Road and Garden Reach Road, in Kidderpore, from 11.25 am to 1.25 pm on Thursday. The group demanded that a swing bridge in the locality, now closed, be reopened to avoid traffic snarls. A memorandum was submitted to the Calcutta Port Trust deputy chairman.

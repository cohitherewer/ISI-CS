 Achromatic art

 Perhaps the most powerful colours on an artists palette, black and white add dimension and intensity to any form or image. While some artists use these colours to capture a moment of ecstasy or sorrow through a combination of lines and textures, others pin down their elusive personal memories through the magical interplay of light and shade. ... through another lane, the ongoing exhibition of black-and-white paintings, brings together an interesting, eclectic mix of works by 15 contemporary city-based artists to create an enchanting, aesthetic environment. Participating artists: Prakash Karmakar, Jogen Chowdhury (one of his paintings appears above), Paritosh Sen, Wassim Kapoor and others.

 Event: An exhibition of black-and-white paintings

 When: Till October 6, 2 pm - 7 pm

 Where: Artists Circle, 46 Circus Avenue

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cops amp; friendly counsellors

 ANUJ SHARMA, deputy commissioner of Calcutta Police (south division), met readers of The Telegraph at his office on January 27 to answer their queries. 

Participants included Samir Bhattacharya, Diptimoy Ghosh, Sudarshan Chhabra, Saileswar Chakrabarty, Jatindra Nath Das, S.K. Khetri, Sandip Banerjee, D.G. Pillai and Chandrima Sen

Diptimoy Ghosh: There is a possibility of JL Nehru Road becoming prone to traffic snarls due to the bottleneck created by the Park Street flyover. How would you prevent that? 

 When the proposal for constructing the flyover was mooted, its effect on the traffic system was discussed in detail. There is no reason to think that the vehicles using the flyover will disrupt normal traffic flow along JL Nehru Road. Police gave a green light to the project only after chalking out alternative traffic arrangements, to be adopted once the flyover is completed.

D.G.Pillai: Policemen on duty at Vidyasagar Setu harass truck drivers for bribes. The toll-tax collectors at the plaza are hand-in-glove with them.Why can?t you take action against the guilty policemen?

 This is not the first time that we are hearing such a complaint. Apart from city police personnel, officers of the state police are involved in such acts, which prevents us from taking stringent action.

 When we receive such a complaint, we warn officers deployed there, and sometimes take action against them. It must be understood that it is not possible for us to maintain a 24-hour vigil.

J.N. Das: I am over 60 years old and survive on my pension. My wife continuously harasses me mentally and physically. She destroys valuable documents, and spends lavishly, forcing me to pay the bills. She even threatens to commit suicide and hold me responsible for it. Is there a police-run centre that extends help to men like us?

 We have set up counselling centres in some police stations in the south division. In these centres, we do not discriminate between man and woman. Any person who feels that he needs counselling may contact the office of the deputy commissioner of police (south division). We will direct him to a counsellor. If the person concerned needs police help, we will provide it.

 As far as your wife?s threats are concerned, you can take legal help or keep the local police station informed about the developments.

Saileswar Chakrabarty: A reputed private bank is charged with fraud. A complaint had been lodged with the police commissioner and a copy was forwarded to you. But no action was taken. Can you explain why?

 In case of white-collar crimes, we act only after gathering sufficient evidence to prove the culprit?s guilt in a court of law. Sometimes, delays take place and this is misinterpreted as slackness on the part of police.

 When we get a complaint, we try our best to book the offender. However, a criminal might go scot free due to lack of evidence.

 As far as your grievance is concerned, I have not received such a complaint against any private bank from the commissioner. However, if you have a complaint, you can discuss the matter with me. I can assure you if your complaint is justified, we will take up the case without bothering how big the bank is.

S.K. Khetri: I have a complaint against some officers of Karaya police station. I had been framed in a case in 1999. Even after winning the legal battle, I cannot wind up the case due to non-cooperation of a section of the officers attached to the police station.

 It is not possible for me to keep a track of all pending cases in the 15 police stations under my jurisdiction. Please make an appointment and meet me so that we can discuss the problem and try to solve it at the earliest. You can also meet the assistant commissioner in charge of the police station. In case the problem persists, you can meet me or write to me about it.

Concluded

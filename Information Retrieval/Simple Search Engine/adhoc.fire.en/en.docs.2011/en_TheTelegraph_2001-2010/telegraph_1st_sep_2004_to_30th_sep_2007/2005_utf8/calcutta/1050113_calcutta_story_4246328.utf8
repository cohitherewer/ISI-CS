 Garbage gripe in Howrah

 - Ward committee yet to be formed a year after elections

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Over 80,000 residents of the Baltikuri and Dasnagar area, covering about 10 sq km of Howrah town, have had to go without regular civic services for a year.

 The reason: the area, under ward number 50 of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), does not have a ward committee.

 ?Twelve months have passed since the municipal elections, but the ward committee has still not started functioning. The authorities are sitting tight and it is the residents who have to suffer,? complained Prasanta Manna, a resident.

 He added that areas like Baltikuri, Kashipur, Library Road and Dasnagar have been the worst-hit because of civic services becoming irregular. 

 From clearing of sewage to regular cleaning of vats, municipal services have come to a standstill in the area. The residents are being forced to bear the stench every day.

 ?It is a fairly well-populated chunk of Howrah and as a result, large amounts of garbage pile up on the sides of the roads every day. The sweepers come to clear the litter once in a blue moon,? complained resident Tarak Nath Dey.

 It was learnt that garbage has piled up for more than 15 days in the Baltikuri and Dasnagar areas and has almost blocked the roads.

 Inquiries revealed that there are only 20 sweepers working in this ward, which is hampering clearance work. 

 The number of sweepers is much higher in the other wards of Howrah. 

 The ward committee is responsible for looking into these problems and bringing them up for discussion during the meetings of the HMC. The absence of a committee has ensured that the problems remain unredressed.

 ?As the pocket is an added area of the HMC, developmental work carried out here is far less compared with other wards. The non-existence of the ward committee has further complicated matters,? resident Manna said. 

 HMC councillor of the ward Ram Lal Chatterjee admitted that there were problems in the area. 

 He said: ?We hope that the ward committee can be constituted soon. Once that is done, the problems of the residents will be solved.? 

 According to officials of the HMC, the previous secretary of the ward committee, Rabindranath Chatterjee, was thrown out of the CPM just after the election. Since then, no one has been appointed to the post. 

 Local CPM activists said that a section of the residents want Chatterjee to take over as secretary of the new board. But, according to party rules, an expelled member cannot hold such a portfolio. 

 The HMC officials said that the committee can easily be formed if the mayor takes the initiative. When contacted, Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said: ?The ward committee will be formed within a short period of time. The local residents will not have to suffer for long.?

 He denied that the stand-off was the result of a feud within his party..

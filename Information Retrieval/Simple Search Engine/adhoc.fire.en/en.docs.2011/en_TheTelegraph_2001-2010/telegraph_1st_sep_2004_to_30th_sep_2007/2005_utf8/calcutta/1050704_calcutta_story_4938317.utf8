 Pretty-in-pink girlie treats

ANUMITA GHOSH

If your favourite game as a child was house-house 

or hide-and-seek, its time to go pink with envy. There are now enough play 

things out there to equip your child to take on the CEO you hope she grows up 

to be.

 Give your kid a taste of hi-tech life with a range of dummy laptops, cameras and other gadgets inspired by Barbie. Mostly in vibrant pink, these are sure hits with girls.

 Laptops offer quite an authentic experience, playing music and allowing kids to even chat with Barbie.

 Not just gadgets, the Barbie line includes an impressive array of stationery and other knick-knacks. 

 While she can flaunt pretty pencils, pens, erasers and crayons in school with style, you could hope their charm works to get her hooked to homework.

 For older children with an eye on girlie grown-up gear, here is an option that might keep them at bay for a few more years.

 The Barbie make-up kit comes with nail varnish and candy-flavoured lipsticks, colourful watches and sunglasses, sure to find favour with to-be-teens.

 The line offers some functional items too. Pop-up bins can be used to put away toys or even dirty clothes. Keeping in mind the hygiene factor, the tiffin boxes and water bottles come in food-grade plastic, explains Deepa Seth of Queen of Hearts in City Centre, an authorised retailer for Barbie products.

 Barbie also brings an easy option for a theme birthday party. There are enough goodies to throw together a Barbie party on the terrace. 

 There are play tents big enough for a kid to snuggle in, while colourful Barbie play cards can keep restless hands busy. Or, pick up a projector that beams Barbie images that the children can trace out. The perfect final touch would be a pretty-in-pink dress code.

Other colourful items on offer include folders, alarm 

clocks, school bags and guitars.

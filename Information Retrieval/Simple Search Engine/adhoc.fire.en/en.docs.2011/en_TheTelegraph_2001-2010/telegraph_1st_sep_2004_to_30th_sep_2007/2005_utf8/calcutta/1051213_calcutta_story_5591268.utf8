 It's Your Birthday So...

 You are easy-going and usually make a living doing something fun. You always keep a foot on the ground. Although strongly opinionated and stubborn, you never try to control others. You express your needs and expectations clearly and like to keep relationships and business separate. You manage finances pretty well, but have a tendency to take on more than you can handle. ? Kusum Bhandari

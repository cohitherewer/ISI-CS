 Death stalls court work

 - Lawyer died without proper medical aid, cry colleagues 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Work at Calcutta High Court came to a standstill on Friday, following the death of a lawyer on the premises. 

 Gunendra Nath Ghosh suffered a heart attack and died without receiving proper medical attention, alleged the legal fraternity, demanding immediate uplift of facilities.

 At about 10.25 am, Ghosh came out of courtroom no. 12, where he had been attending the hearing of a case, and soon collapsed. A doctor from the nearby medical unit, Subhash Kumar Adhikari, attended to the patient, but within 10 minutes, Ghosh was dead.

 The lawyers held a demonstration in front of the medical unit at high court, with the body of their colleague lying on the floor. 

 No more cases were heard after the agitating advocates declared that they would not allow the regular business of court to resume till the state government promised improved medical facilities.

 Acting Chief Justice Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury stepped in, requesting the lawyers to call off the agitation, assuring them that a meeting of judges would be called during the day to discuss the matter. 

 Chowdhury also asked the lawyers to submit their demands in writing. 

 Only then was the body sent for the last rites.

 Uttam Majumdar, general secretary of the West Bengal Lawyers Association, claimed that Ghosh died without proper medical attention. ?There was neither oxygen nor Sorbitrate in the medical unit. There is also no ambulance, so the patient could not be taken to hospital,? he alleged.

 Doctor Adhikari said efforts to revive the patient failed, as there had not been enough time to treat him.

 Later in the day, a memorandum was submitted to acting Chief Justice Chowdhury, who assured representatives of the lawyers? association that the state government would be asked to provide more medical facilities in the high court.

 ?Daily, at least 10,000 people visit the court. There is one doctor, who also has to attend to patients at City Civil Court, the New Secretariat and, sometimes, even Writers? Buildings,? the lawyers alleged.

 Calcutta High Court Bar Association president Sardar Amjad Ali also placed a memorandum before Justice Chowdhury, seeking his nod for the association to construct a medical unit at its own cost.

 ?The association had already broached the subject with former acting Chief Justice Altamas Kabir, who had assured us he would take it up with the government. The lawyers are still ready to bear the expenses,? Ali said.

 Sandra Bullock and Regina King in Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and FabulousRegina King: Power packed

 For all Miss Congeniality fans, it?s time for more femme fatales as the sequel Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous comes to town this Friday. While Sandra Bullock reprises her role of Gracie Hart, it is her brutally honest partner in the FBI, Sam Fuller, played by Regina King, who is the sequel showstopper. 

 After stunning one and all alongside Jamie Foxx?s Ray Charles in the Oscar-winning Taylor Hackford film, King makes Miss Congeniality 2 her own as she matches step for step with actor-producer Bullock.

 And reportedly Bullock had no problem in sharing the limelight with King. ?She?s not like a person where it?s ?all about me?,? says King about her more famous screen partner. ?Her thing is just everybody has to be good. Everybody has to be great, and the story playing the best is the most important thing because I?m going to look better if the story is a great story. She felt it made more sense that my character continued to do the whole thing because originally my character freezes up and then I can?t sing, I can?t do it, and then she steps in and does it. She decided that Sam should be the one that freezes up, but that?s the one moment that we just really fall in love with Sam. We want to see her have fun ? she can?t be hard through the whole thing. So, I said okay? yeah.? 

 King recalls how her character evolved into something quite extraordinary once the Armed and Fabulous plot started developing. ?We added the element that she had these allergies, so as a kid she couldn?t play any sports, was picked on, and she couldn?t release any pent-up energy that kids have. So, it?s usually either sports or drugs that kids get into. She didn?t do either one so she probably was kicking ass all of her life, and this is how she dealt with things. She didn?t know any other way to deal with things. So, this woman has helped her see that there is another way, and the only reason why this woman could is because in the first Miss Congeniality, she was the same type of person. In the first one, she and Benjamin Bratt have this serious fight scene. So I was able to understand the character by putting that background in it for me.? 

 But wasn?t it difficult playing a character who?s pissed off and frowning for most of the movie? ?A lot of the characters that I?ve played are usually the heavy in the movie or the person that isn?t always the more realistic person in the movie. This is probably the first time where I?ve really had to just really keep it one note through the majority of the movie. When I saw the movie, initially I was kind of concerned that Sam was so hard, but then I watched as she used her hardness to bring Gracie back. Gracie was sad over a frickin? guy. Your best friend is about to die and you?re tripping off of your dude being gone? This is ridiculous. Originally, they felt that it should have been a softer moment, but I personally felt it shouldn?t have. If Sam is going to be tough throughout this movie, the only way she?s going to pull her out of this is to still be tough.? 

 Regina King: Power packed

 In fact, until the now-famous ?Tina Turner scene?, Sam?s femininity is very questionable in the movie. ?Sam wasn?t sure about it right away, because she?s just all about her job,? says King. ?Clearly, men have pissed her off. Everyone has pissed her off ? she is anti-people. And if anyone asks about it, she?d probably punch him. She dealt with everything through anger. That was her emotion that she hid behind. If I yell, if I hit, I won?t have to deal with the surface stuff. So it?s not until she actually has somebody that?s considering her a friend that she felt like she could peel off a few of the layers.?

 King also recounts her experience at this year?s Academy Awards. ?The Oscars were amazing. I don?t know why I felt like it was going to be just like this really different red carpet. The difference was it was bigger. In the past three years, the unfortunate thing about the Oscars is that it?s become about fashion. It?s not about this incredible work that these people have done. You know, I think I even saw an interview the other day where Hilary Swank was getting to the Vanity Fair party and she has her Oscar in her hand and the interviewer was saying, ?Congratulations, Hilary,? and Hilary begins to start talking about winning the Oscar, and the interviewer says, ?No, I don?t want to hear anything else. Just tell me about this dress.? She just won her second Oscar ? tell me about the dress? You?re kidding me. So, that?s what it?s become.?

 In the middle of all this, King is also planning a film of her own. ?It?s a period piece set in Chicago in the 70s. It?s called My Tribe is Lost. It?s a coming-of-age story about two little boys in Chicago during the Black Panthers era and all the Black Power movements that were going on during that time. And just how these two boys are living in an all-white neighbourhood and their relationships within the neighbourhood. Although race relations was a big issue at that time, this group of kids that was black and white ? were still just kids. At the end of the day, kids are the only ones who pretty much let that colour thing go. Not black or white, it?s brown and pink.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Love?s lovely labour 

 A moment from 2046, and (below) director Wong Kar Wai

 He was slated to come to Delhi this year for the Osian?s Cinefan festival, but like all true auteurs, he got busy with the editing of his new film Eros. But Hong Kong-based writer-director Wong Kar Wai?s frames continued to seduce the viewers at the Siri Fort Complex as his magnum opus 2046 enjoyed a double screening at the festival.

 Shown for the first time at Cannes 2004, 2046 took four years in the making with Wong continuing to shoot it weeks after the festival for the premiere of the full film in China in September last year. The maker of such classics as In The Mood For Love and Chungking Express, Wong first thought of the idea of 2046 when China announced to the world its intention of reclaiming Hong Kong after it remains sovereign for the first 50 years post the 1997 handover.

 Around this theme, Wong spins his signature brand of mystique romantic melancholy and strings together the physical and mental journeys of writer-journalist Chow, who?s living in Hong Kong?s Oriental Hotel and writing a futuristic novel about humans and androids. Using Chow?s pen, Wong?s screenplay goes to-and-fro in time even as it gives space to Chow?s encounters with the three women who live in the opposite room (number 2046) to his.

 What makes 2046 the most important film in recent times is the way it uses technology to show its redundancy. The way Wong equates the China-Hong Kong handover and love is through the concept of change ? how a couple wants to hold on to love and not allow anything to change. As the lines Chow says in the film: ?You can?t leave 2046... Hope it can leave you.? 

 Made at $15 million, 2046 is the most ambitious project of arguably the most romantic film-maker in the world and certainly the most respected contemporary director in Asia. Starring Tony Leung Chiu Wai as the protagonist Chow, the stunningly shot film has a brilliant support cast in the form of Gong Li, Kimura Takuya, Faye Wong and Zhang Ziyi.

 Wong had to fight the SARS epidemic and a fallout with his longtime collaborator, Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle, to finish his dream 2046. And good he never gave up... otherwise world cinema would have been robbed of the mesmerising masterpiece. While we Calcuttans continue to be unlucky when it comes to foreign flicks, we can only catch the modern-day classic on DVDs that are in circulation.

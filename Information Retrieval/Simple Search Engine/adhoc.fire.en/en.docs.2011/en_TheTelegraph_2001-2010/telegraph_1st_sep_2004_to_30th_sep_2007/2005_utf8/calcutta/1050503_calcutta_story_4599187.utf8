 Charges fly over civic land deals

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee and Opposition leader Nirmal Mukherjee (CPM) have both demanded a probe into alleged scams in the sale of civic land.

 But the unanimity ends there ? while the mayor points to the period till he came to power, his rival indicates just the opposite.

 CPM leader Mukherjee on Monday alleged that the mayor had handed over a huge chunk of prime land to some private parties at Rs 194.76 crore. But the land had been under-valued, causing a loss of crores to the civic coffer. 

 He demanded a probe by an independent body to ascertain the extent of loss during the mayor?s tenure, starting 2000.

 Welcoming the demand, Subrata Mukherjee said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had also sold land when CPM?s Prasanta Chatterjee was mayor. ?I am ready to face even a CBI probe if it digs into the alleged losses during the period 1994-2005.?

 Congress leader in the CMC Sailen Dasgupta said: ?We, too, are interested to know who, the CPM or the Trinamul, inflicted more losses on the civic body.?

 Records with the estate department reveal that 365.5 bighas in east Calcutta, equalling around 20 per cent of the Maidan, have been sold out to 14 private parties during 1994-2005. The authorities have earned Rs 216.24 crore. 

 Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer on special duty (OSD) to the mayor, pointed out that more land was sold out during Prasanta Chatterjee?s tenure (205.26 bighas) than during Mukherjee?s (130.24 bighas).

 The CPM said there had been no uniformity in prices in the deals worked out by mayor Mukherjee. In some cases, the price per cottah in 2004 was less than the 2002 price. 

 The mayor?s response: ?The CPM board had sold 1,816 cottahs to a private company in 1996 at Rs 549 a cottah, while in 1994, it had sold a plot to ITC at Rs 1.17 lakh a cottah. Let them first explain this contradiction.? The plot sold in 1996 was the largest the civic body had ever sold to a private party.

 A civic estate department official said the civic body?s earning from the 1,816-cottah plot would have been 12 times higher if it were priced at the rate the civic body had charged while selling the Swabhumi plot the same year.

 On allegations of differential rates, the mayor said: ?Land use should be a factor in fixing the price. A public body cannot charge the same unit price as a hotel group or the state industrial development corporation.?

 According to the civic accounts department, the highest and lowest prices per cottah during Prasanta Chatterjee?s tenure were Rs 1.45 lakh and Rs 549. The figures during Mukherjee?s tenure were Rs 6.6 lakh and Rs 18,519.

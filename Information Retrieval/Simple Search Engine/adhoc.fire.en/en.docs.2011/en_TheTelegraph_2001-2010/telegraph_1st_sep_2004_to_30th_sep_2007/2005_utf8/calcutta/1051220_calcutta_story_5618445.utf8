 A lot of people watch birds. I watch marriages, smiled Shobhaa De, as attractive as ever in a yellow top and blue jeans on Sunday evening. 

 The writer, who has made a best-selling book (Spouse: The Truth about Marriage by Penguin) out of her hobby of 30 years, was addressing the GoodLife Talk Show on lifestyle, marriage and parenthood at Space Town, off VIP Road.

 With author-filmmaker Jayabrato Chatterjee as anchor, the chat drew more than 200 residents of the housing complex to the lawns. They not only lent an eager ear to Shobhaas views on what makes a marriage click, but also flooded her with queries that ranged from marital myths to parenthood problems.

 Jayabrato set the ball rolling by highlighting the collapse of the joint family and the toll it has taken on marriages. But I feel young people now are discovering the joys of the extended family? Joint family provides a cultural background, stability and security that are essential to bring up a child, felt Shobhaa.

 Is there a sense of guilt in young parents because they cant spend enough time with them? asked Jayabrato. Working mothers often pamper their children with material things in order to compensate for lost time. And kids become very demanding as a result. They misunderstand material things for love, observed Shobhaa.

 And where is marriage going now? wondered Jayabrato.

 Single parenting hasnt worked in the West, gay marriages are in too early a stage to say anything about. Every other version of marriage has been tried and we have come back to the old set-up, smiled Shobhaa, a strong advocator of the traditional institution of marriage. 

 Awareness is the take-off point. You should be able to talk about your problems and address them. TALK is the most important four-letter word in our lives. More you talk, less misunderstandings (there are)? There is no such thing as a perfect marriage, a perfect husband or a perfect wife. Its fine as long as you give it your best shot, she added, happy to be back in her shoshurbari.

 And what to do when the marriage isnt a smooth ride? Does one go for counselling? asked a lady from the audience. Professional counselling is not a very good option. Earlier we had old people at home to talk to. Now with the collapse of the support system with the joint family, we turn to counsellors who feel they will give us a solution? There are going to be rough patches in every marriage. One has to try and overcome that. Walking out is an option but todays young people take it too hastily without trying their best, felt the author.

 TV serials and films are portraying open relationships. What do you think about them? a concerned senior citizen wanted to know. Serials and films are reflecting what is happening in society. Lets wake up to the fact that a lot has changed. Our social mores have changed, implored Shobhaa.

 Is the Indian man ready to change for the changing woman? asked a 17-year-old girl. Thats a good question! laughed Shobhaa, adding: Indian men are not used to the idea of recognising a womans needs. Now husband and wife are equal partners in the marriage and the Indian man is changing faster. Our men are far more compassionate and attuned to us than the western man.

 Arent live-in relationships becoming too rampant, was the query from a gentleman in the audience. A live-in relationship is a no-win situation for a woman because it is dictated by the man. She doesnt have any security and becomes very emotionally vulnerable when he doesnt need her anymore and kicks her out, reasoned Shobhaa.

 A brief photo session later, the author bid goodbye with a smile and a wave, leaving the audience with enough food for thought on matters social and personal.

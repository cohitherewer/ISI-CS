 Gherao shuts tech varsity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) was closed for an indefinite period on Tuesday after students began a night-long agitation.

 Tension has prevailed on the university?s Salt Lake campus since Monday, after some students gheraoed senior officers, including the vice-chancellor and registrar, till early on Tuesday, demanding supplementary exams for clearing their backlog. 

 Most of the agitators were those who had recently failed in semester examinations conducted by the university. The gherao was lifted around 5 am on Tuesday, following police intervention. 

 But around 9 am, the agitators returned and gheraoed the officers.

 ?We had to close the institution as the situation was sliding from bad to worse,? Samir Bandyopadhyay, WBUT registrar, said after declaring the closure.

 This is the first time since the university was set up four years ago that the authorities had to shut down the institution sine die.

 Around 540 aggrieved students from various private engineering institutions affiliated to the university had launched a movement last week, demanding supplementary examinations.

 They had been organising sit-ins and shouting slogans in front of the campus since Wednesday last week. 

 The situation worsened on Monday afternoon, when the agitating students locked the main gate of the campus.

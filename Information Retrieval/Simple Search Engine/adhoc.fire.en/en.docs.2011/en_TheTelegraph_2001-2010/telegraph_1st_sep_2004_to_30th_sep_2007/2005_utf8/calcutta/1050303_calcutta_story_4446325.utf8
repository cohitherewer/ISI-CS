 Document of a way of life by the tracks

 They call themselves the Shalti Research Group. ?It is named after Indranath?s boat in Saratchandra?s Srikanto. That moved very fast; we are slow in comparison,? group member Ashish Mukherjee says by way of introduction. Yet the work the team of four has been doing since the Pujas has given birth to a key tool in the awareness campaign to garner support for the dwellers along the railway tracks.

 The group had started off with a survey on 378 families in Netaji Colony, Tollygunge. ?The Supreme Court had just ruled for eviction. We wanted to find out what the effect of displacement would be before the bulldozers came rolling,? Mukherjee says. This took them door to door on a survey. At a later date, cameraman Sukhendu Manna suggested they put the images they had gathered into a documentary format. The result is Biponno Boshobash, an 18-minute film. 

 ?The upper classes regard these people as lumpens. But they are families that have settled into a rhythm of life. The colony where we worked is about 10 years old, sheltering people mostly from South 24-Parganas. A few are from Bangladesh and the pavements,? Mukherjee says. Their income averages Rs 1,800, with the woman being the steady bread-earner, working as domestic help in nearby houses. Children go to school; an NGO runs adult literacy classes at night as well as a cr?che for working mothers. ?All this will be disrupted if they are evicted. It is wrong to think they are rich enough to return wherever they came from. The threat of eviction is escalating rents in the neighbouring Jhaldar Math slum to Rs 600-650 a room. So, most will just be left on the streets,? Mukherjee reasons passionately.

 Biponno Boshobash has been screened at a number of places ? from Jadavpur University to street-corners. It argues against the main charge that has been levelled against the dwellers ? of polluting the Lake. ?It is the clubs that are doing the damage, especially through get-togethers. Our film has shots of Kinley and Black Label bottles floating in the water. Surely slum-dwellers cannot afford that stuff. As for bathing and washing, it is tough to pollute 73 acres of water by just that.?

 The foursome, which earlier worked by the Beleghata canal and Tolly?s Nullah, has become involved with the cause of the trackside settlers. ?We are working on a rehabilitation plan to be submitted to the government,? says Mukherjee, waiting on Tuesday night for the hour of confrontation.

 When it became apparent on Wednesday that there would be no eviction, Manna, surrounded by the encroachers, cried: ?Please highlight our victory.? The hand that held the camera had become the voice of the subject.

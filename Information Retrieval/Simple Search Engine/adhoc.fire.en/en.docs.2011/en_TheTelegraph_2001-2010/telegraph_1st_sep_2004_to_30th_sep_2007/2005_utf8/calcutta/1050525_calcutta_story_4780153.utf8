The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A vernal romance

 Celebrating the eternal love of nature for spring, its favourite season, Jahnavi Centre for Performing Arts presents Ranganayaker Jonye, a dance-theatre based on Tagores Rituranga. Portraying nature as a mysterious, enigmatic woman, the performance plays upon the paradox of love that thrives on separation. At the touch of spring, nature bursts forth with its treasure of fruits and flowers, beauty and fragrances. Yet, nature never fully surrenders herself to spring, nor is ever completely fulfilled by spring, whose attentions and affections are short-lived. As spring departs, nature loses it splendour and becomes arid, bare and bereft of all her gracious abundance. Then, with the return of spring, nature again manifests herself in all her fecund glory. Perhaps, in her sadness, separation and loneliness, lie the fountainhead of her creativity, in which she revels and rejoices. A musical metaphor for the contradictions in human life and relationships, the dance-theatre is conceived, scripted, directed and performed by Madhuboni Chatterjee.

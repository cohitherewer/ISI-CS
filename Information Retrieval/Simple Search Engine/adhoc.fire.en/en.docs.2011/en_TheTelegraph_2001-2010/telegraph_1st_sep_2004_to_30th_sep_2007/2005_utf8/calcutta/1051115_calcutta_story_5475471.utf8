The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Facelift plan for heritage offices

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It?s one of the city?s best-known secrets: Calcutta?s decrepit buildings ? many owned or used by central government departments or undertakings ? make the city uglier. Now, after years of neglect, New Delhi finally appears to be stirring itself to do something about the tumble-down edifices.

 Officers said on Monday the Centre has asked the different ministries and undertakings owning or occupying heritage buildings in Calcutta and elsewhere to draw up a comprehensive programme aimed at repairing and maintaining the structures. 

 The ministry of environment and forests was the first to respond to the initiative and directed its offices to draw up a conservation programme for the buildings.

 ?We believe many old buildings belonging to the Union government?s various departments are not included in the lists of heritage structures and they cry out for immediate attention,? said officers connected with the exercise. 

 ?It is an overdue step,? said Pratap Chandra Chanda, chairman of the West Bengal Heritage Commission. ?We could try to convince the owners of other such structures, with the central departments showing the way.?

 A high-level meeting was held on September 12 in Delhi, when the secretary of environment and forest met senior officers of the civil construction unit and chalked out a detailed plan for maintaining heritage buildings under its control.

 Three major heritage buildings in Calcutta under the control of the ministry ? the Geological Survey of India building, Botanical Survey of India building and the Anthropological Survey of India building ? are not in a very good shape and require immediate care. 

 All the three buildings are located in the Indian Museum complex on JLNehru Road. The Roxburgh buildings at the Shibpur Botanical Gardens, too, is in poor shape.

 The ministry of forests and environment has instructed the civil construction unit to complete the lists of heritage buildings under its control. 

 ?The buildings constructed during pre-Independence period had a distinctive architectural character and should be classified as heritage buildings. The list of all such buildings should be prepared with the help of the departments or institutions under the ministry,? a document of the ministry said.

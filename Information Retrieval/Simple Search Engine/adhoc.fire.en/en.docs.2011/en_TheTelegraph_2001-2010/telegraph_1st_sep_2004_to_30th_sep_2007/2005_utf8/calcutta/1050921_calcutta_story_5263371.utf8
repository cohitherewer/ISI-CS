 Judge link in land scam

 - Receiver of Bypass property given free hand to sell plots

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has directed its registrar-general to take action against an Alipore court judge, who allegedly allowed a lawyer to sell litigated property on the EM Bypass.

 In his order, Justice Prabir Kumar Samanta raised questions on the authority of Alipore court judge P.K. Rakshit, who allegedly allowed lawyer Shankar Sen, a court-appointed receiver, to transfer and sell landed property on the Bypass that belonged to the Sanpui family.

 While sentencing Sen to simple imprisonment for three days, Justice Samanta said: ?I direct the order (passed by him) to be placed before the registrar-general of this court for taking appropriate steps against the subordinate court judge. The judge concerned should be asked to explain his conduct in dealing with the matter.?

 The judgment was delivered a fortnight ago, but a copy of it was made available only on Tuesday. Justice Samanta indicated that the manner in which the Alipore court judge had allegedly helped the receiver to sell the litigated land was contrary to the law.

 Sen has already moved an appeal against the order of Justice Samanta and obtained an interim stay. The hearing of the appeal is pending with the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Bishi. 

 A case between the owners of a vast plot of land, covering seven mouzas (from the Kasba connector to Garia, on both sides of the EM Bypass) is pending in the Alipore court since 1962.

 The subordinate court had appointed Sen, a receiver, to look after the land. According to rules, status quo should be maintained while there is a legal dispute over the right to a landed property. 

 ?A section of owners had informed Justice Rakshit that Sen, as a receiver of the property, was allowing the promoters to construct buildings on the disputed land. They also sought an order of the court to remove Sen from the post and appoint another lawyer to look after the land,? said Anamika Das, counsel appearing on behalf of one of the parties to the case. 

 She alleged that the judge, instead of responding to appeals of the parties, had allowed Sen to change the character of the litigated land.

 When asked what steps the high court authorities had taken against the accused judge, a senior officer said: ?We have received the copy of Justice Samanta?s judgment a couple of days ago. The order of the court will be carried out in proper time.?

 Settler shift in doubt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rehabilitation of settlers along the Lakes remained uncertain, with the case relating to their removal scheduled to come up for hearing in the high court on Friday. 

 The state government and the railways have expressed their helplessness in providing land for the rehabilitation.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya held a meeting at Writers? Buildings on Wednesday to formulate a strategy for the rehabilitation. 

 Departmental secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, home secretary Prasad Roy, city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and senior railway officers attended the meeting.

 The railway officials made it clear at the meeting that they would not be able to provide land or offer compensation to the encroachers.

 ?We have no provision for providing compensation or rehabilitation to unauthorised settlers on railway land. If it wants, the state government will have to do that,?? a railway official said after the meeting.

 Clarifying the government stand on the issue, the urban development minister told the railway officials that the state government would take the responsibility of building a housing estate for the squatters, if the railway provided the land. He pointed out that the railway had large chunks of land at various places near the city.

 Trinamul Congress legislator Saugata Roy, who attended the meeting on behalf of the settlers, reminded the railway officials that the railway minister himself had said that he would arrange for land to rehabilitate the squatters.

 The officials, however, denied receiving any such order from the railway board.

 The high court had directed the state government and the railway authorities to evict the squatters to protect the Lakes. The court later modified the order, asking the government to consider rehabilitation of the settlers before evicting them. It, however, asserted that the areas along the railway tracks from Ballygunge to Tollygunge would have to be cleared. No deadline was set for the eviction.

 The government undertook a drive on March 3, 2005, to evict the settlers, but had to put it off following strong opposition from the encroachers. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee later said that he was against any forceful eviction.

 The Kalighat temple: Looking up. A Telegraph picture

 The Kalighat temple, revered by the Hindus as one their 51 pithasthans, has a number of unsavoury aspects, too ? duped visitors, unwanted elements taking shelter in shops in the complex, irrational schedule of opening and closing the temple doors... But things are improving, following a recent order of the Alipore district and sessions judge, also ex-officio chairman of the Kalighat Temple Committee.

 Acting on a series of complaints from various quarters, the judge has passed the order to stamp out the irregularities and ensure smooth running of the temple. The order was preceded by a detailed inventory carried out by a team of judicial officials. 

 ?We have already implemented a number of measures. A report will be submitted to the judge later this month,? temple committee president Ajay Mitra said on Friday. ?We also plan to renovate the complex,? he added. Details of the plans will be worked out within a few months and will be submitted to the judge for approval.

 The temple used to remain open from 2 am to midnight. Following the order, the gates now open at 4 am, for visitors to watch mongolarati, and close at 10.30 pm. On Tuesdays and Sundays, the temple closes at 11 pm and on Saturdays, at 11.30 pm. ?The schedule, however, will be relaxed on festive days,? Mitra said.

 Several devotees have complained that they had been taken to the naat mandir by persons donning some identity cards and forced to part with money and other articles for the sankalpa. Following the order, temple officials have stepped up vigil in and around the naat mandir.

 The judge also observed that some persons in the guise of priests gather in front of gate 3 and persuade devotees ? at times even force them? to avail of their services to enter the sanctum sanctorum. Apart from the fact that such services do not come free, the uncontrolled entry causes problems in performing puja. 

 Mitra said the paladars owe a huge amount ? Rs 30 lakh, according to sources ? to the management. The secretary or the treasurer of the temple committee has been asked to hold talks with them to realise the arrears. Action will be taken against them if they fail to clear the amount within a reasonable time.

 ?The temple?s earnings during the day and the evening are deposited in the bank the next day. I am trying to introduce a system, subject to the approval of the judge, by which the amount will be deposited to the evening branch of a bank,? Mitra told Metro.

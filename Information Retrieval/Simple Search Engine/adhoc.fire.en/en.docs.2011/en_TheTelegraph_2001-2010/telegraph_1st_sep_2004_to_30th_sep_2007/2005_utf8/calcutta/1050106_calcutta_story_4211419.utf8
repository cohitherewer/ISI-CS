 Music-makers? prop for survivors

 Usha Uthup on song: A little help for my friend

 This New Year, the city may have partied on despite the tsunami, but now music-makers have stepped up to do their bit in aid of the survivors.

 Three events will see musicians on song to raise money for relief operations. The first ? called Our Planet, Our Life and Our Duty ? is being organised by Oxford Bookstore on the Apeejay lawns on Park Street on January 7. The same day, Art of Living will host a pianist from the Netherlands at GD Birla Sabhagar. Finally, on January 16, Calcutta?s top DJs are getting together at Ordnance Club to scratch and spin out some cash. Money raised through ticket sales and donations at all three events will go to relief funds.

 The Oxford event has the biggest star line-up ? Wired, Pandit Shantanu Bandopadhyay with fusion outfit Class Apart, Krosswindz, Usha Uthup, Anjan and Neel Dutt and Paban Das Baul. This is its third fundraiser for a cause; the earlier two were in aid of the Bhuj quake victims and Bapi Sen?s family.

 ?This will be bigger and better, hopefully, as it will be an all-day affair,? hopes Neel Adhikari, who has played at both previous gigs as part of Krosswindz and will play on Saturday with Wired and Class Apart. The open-air concert is slated to start at 11.30 am and should continue till 4.30 pm, attracting a dedicated audience, as well as passers-by. The music will be multilingual, but primarily rock. Drop boxes will be positioned around the lawns and volunteers will also collect donations, all to go to the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund.

 Also on Saturday, pianist Mireille Heijltjes from the Netherlands will play, 6.30 pm onwards, as artist Tinku Das paints a canvas, which will then be auctioned. All proceeds will go to the tsunami survivors.

 Next Sunday, the DJs will get into the charity act. Nine leading names ? Ravi, Harish, Saranjit, Dippy, Kunal, Ashish, Paras, Gursimran and Anshul ? will spin tunes for a cause at Ordnance Club. ?Being an artiste, this is the best we could do,? says DJ Ravi, a committee member of Ordnance Club and the brain behind the event. ?We have priced the tickets low, at Rs 50, and are each trying to bring in at least 500 guests,? he adds. If it works out as planned, the club will see 5,000 guests, apart from members, to queue up at the venue?s donation counters. The club hopes to raise between ?Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh?.

 DJ Harish refuted the allegations slammed on the deejay fraternity for carrying on with 31st night celebrations. ?Tourism has started in Phuket already. It?s their livelihood. Similarly, we have to play every night for our bread and butter. It?s not that we don?t want to do anything for the tsunami victims,? he said.

 Young singer Shayne Hyrapiet is also to perform at the show. ?This is the first time I have been asked to be a part of something like this... All we can do is pool our talents and hope for the best. We?re doing it free,? explains Shayne.

 Two of the city?s biggest dance groups, Zodiac and Footloose, are also warming up for the event. ?We will be doing our regular crowd-pulling numbers, so people will have to pay to watch us perform,? says Dippy, of Zodiac. The group is spreading the word about the event through college posters, radio bytes and SMS.

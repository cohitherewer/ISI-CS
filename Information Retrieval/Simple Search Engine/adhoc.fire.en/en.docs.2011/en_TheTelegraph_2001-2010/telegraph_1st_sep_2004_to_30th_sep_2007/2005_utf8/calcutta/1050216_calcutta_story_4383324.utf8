 Gunjan Ghosh, mastermind of the Roma Jhawar abduction, not only killed Arvind Bhai, who led the abductors, but would not have hesitated to kill others who came in the way of his getting the ransom. 

 This was the verdict of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday.

 ?Going by Gunjan?s nature, he would have gunned down others if there was any slip-up or if they came between him and the money. He is an extremely cool person with perfect knowledge of what he is doing or is about to do,? said additional director-general of police (CID) R.K. Mohanty.

 A sum of Rs 16 lakh, of the Rs 20 lakh-plus paid as ransom, has been recovered from Gunjan. Having provided the men to carry out the abduction, as well as a revolver, Arvind had reportedly demanded Rs 10 lakh from Gunjan. Arvind?s associate Pappu had sought Rs 8 lakh, said the investigating officers.

 ?Gunjan had realised that after making all the payments, he would be left with a pittance ? something that he was not willing to accept. He, therefore, decided to murder Arvind,? said Rajeev Kumar, CID deputy inspector-general (operations). 

 Soon after the murder in the early hours of the day after the abduction, police claimed, Gunjan asked Mukesh, one of Pappu?s associates, to drive to Science City to dispose of Arvind?s body. Besides the two, Pappu was in the car when the body was dumped. 

 The three returned to Guddu?s garage on Narkeldanga Main Road, where Roma was kept through the night. She was released a few hours later. 

 ?Gunjan did not allow Roma on the rear seat fearing that she might see the blood stains. She was made to sit beside the driver (Mukesh) and Pappu,? Kumar added. 

 The five, including another member of the team named Munna, took the car to Subhas Sarobar, cleaned it and then burnt Arvind?s clothes, before throwing away his shoes and other belongings into the lake. 

 On Tuesday, a team of divers from the Calcutta Police?s Disaster Management Group reportedly fished out from Subhas Sarobar a mobile phone chip that was thrown away by Gunjan.

 In the afternoon, a team of CID officers took Gunjan to NRS Hospital morgue to identify Arvind?s body. 

 Another team went looking for the clothes he had worn on the day of the murder. Cops are now trying to match bloodstains on Gunjan?s clothes with that of Arvind?s.

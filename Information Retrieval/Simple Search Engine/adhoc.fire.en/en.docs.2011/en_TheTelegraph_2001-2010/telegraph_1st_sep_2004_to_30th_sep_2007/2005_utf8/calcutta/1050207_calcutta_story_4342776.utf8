 Howrah count on computer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Taking a cue from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, its Howrah twin has decided to introduce computerised birth and death registration certificates from mid-February. 

 Mayor Gopal Mukherjee said on Sunday that over a crore people living in the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) area would avail of the system.

 ?A sum of Rs 100 has to be deposited for a computerised certificate, while Rs 50 will fetch a hand-written one. We will gradually do away with hand-written certification, since the system delays registration of births and deaths,? Mukherjee added.

 According to the mayor, lack of funds has stood in the way of computerising the entire system. 

 ?Within the next few years, the entire records system will come under a modern and computerised management,? he claimed.

 The computerised certificates will be available only at the HMC central office for now, he explained. 

 Howrah health department officials said that every year, more than 8,000 people die in the municipal area. 

 Of the 18,000 babies that are born in the area every year, nearly 10,000 are born in the Howrah District Hospital. The rest take birth in the 43 registered nursing homes and private hospitals across Howrah.

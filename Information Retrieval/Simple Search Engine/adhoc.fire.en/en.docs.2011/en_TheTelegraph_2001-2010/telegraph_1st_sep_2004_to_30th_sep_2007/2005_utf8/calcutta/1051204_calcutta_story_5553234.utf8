 The Dalhousie destination

 Club Sandwich 

 The Palladian Club Lounge at Bengal Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry

 Roast turkey, plum pudding and broth soup on the Christmas buffet brunch menu. Art shows, musical evenings and supper theatre. Theme food festivals, debates and workshops and a defined connect with the broader heritage precinct of one of the world?s architecturally richest business districts?

 As it counts down to celebrating its first anniversary, The Palladian Club Lounge, the business club of the oldest business chamber east of Suez ? The Bengal Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry (BCCI) ? is gearing up to become the definitive Dalhousie destination.

 The regal rendezvous on the third level of the Royal Exchange Building is really the reincarnation of the old Bengal Chamber Club formed 16 years ago. With trappings of wood panelling, carpeting and an old-world charm, it was called The Chambers and run by an external contractor.

 ?In 2004, as we marked our 150th anniversary, there was a reassessment of objectives, roles and portfolios and it was decided to hand over the club to professionals. So, the ink was dried on a 10-year agreement with Asian Hotels (which runs Hyatt Regency in the city) to provide food and beverage, service and staff, and run the place,? says BCCI secretary-general Khokan Mookerji.

 The makeover, a conservative-surgery initiative by architect Dulal Mukherjee, marries the traditional with the contemporary. The teak panelled walls with their varnished copper hue and the plush old sofas, the round dining tables and ornate newspaper racks are all meant to preserve the old-world look. On the other hand, the newly laid artificial-wood flooring, the modern bar and the state-of-the-art business centre exude a contemporary feel. 

 ?The desired brand positioning of the place is of a warm and welcoming business lounge,? says Mookerji.

 Architect Mukherjee is sure the Palladian Lounge could be the tip of the iceberg and the starting point of an integrated revival of the entire business district.

 ?The idea is to create recreation and relaxation avenues with a difference and an intellectual touch. For instance, the beautiful tiled courtyard of the magnificent building can be utilised in fair weather with sit-outs, gardens and maybe mood lights at night. Also, the chamber management can look at constructing a few guestrooms on the top level, which could be prestige accommodation for business travellers, like a heritage hotel,? he observes.

 While the courtyard clean-up and the rooms might take a while to happen, the chamber is actively considering a bistro and a library to accentuate the cosy feel of the business lounge. ?We are also readying a clutch of events like art exhibitions and live music, besides the food festivals we are holding every month,? says Bipasha Mookerjee, spokesperson for Asian Hotels.

 Within walking distance of Writers? Buildings, Lyons Range, the Tea Board and prime banking units, the novel Bengal Chamber business lounge offers not only fine dining, but a sundowner platter of kebabs and spring rolls, besides soup-salad-sandwich combos. ?From tea and cookies to high tea and full-course lunch and dinners, F amp;B is a prime USP at the Palladian Lounge. Though essentially for Chamber members, we entertain walk-ins as temporary guests after a profile screening,? explains the Asian Hotels spokesperson.

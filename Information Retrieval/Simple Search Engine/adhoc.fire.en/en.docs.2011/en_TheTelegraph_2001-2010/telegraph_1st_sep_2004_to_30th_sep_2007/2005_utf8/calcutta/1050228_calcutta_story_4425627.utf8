The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Poet Dante had said of Hell: ?All hope abandon, ye who enter here?. The same 

seems to hold true for government offices here. I am a 72-year-old former IAS 

officer. Two months ago, I had a bitter experience during a visit to the state 

government?s housing department. After not getting a reply to our claim of common 

expenses of our property, I met the secretary, the joint secretary, the deputy 

secretary, the assistant chief engineer and the estate engineer of the department, 

but to no avail. I dragged myself from floor to floor, chamber to chamber in the 

New Secretariat but the officers didn?t even offer me a seat or spare a few minutes, 

let alone help solve my problem. The chief minister?s transparency and dynamism 

should percolate to the lowest government functionary. A government servant must 

be made to clamber each level up the administrative hierarchy only through sheer 

hard work and sincere service to the public.

 R.K. Mookherjee, BT Road. 

 I am regular passenger of the Sealdah division. I have noticed that whenever 

a local train enters the platform, people waiting to board it literally go berserk. 

They jostle their way into the train even when it is moving and, in the process, 

make it very difficult for those already in the train to get off. At times, the 

jostling even leads to a scuffle among passengers. We are forced to face this 

ordeal day after day. To curb this nuisance, I appeal to the authority concerned 

not to display the platform number, from where a particular train is scheduled 

to depart, before hand. Trains on a section of routes should be allotted a few 

platforms. When a local train enters the platform, five to 10 minutes should be 

given for people to get off. The train can then be ascribed another route on the 

same section and the route and platform number be announced. Ten more minutes 

can be given for people to board the compartments.

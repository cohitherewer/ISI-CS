 The West Bengal Commission for Women has intervened in the case of 40-year-old housewife Jaya Majumdar, allegedly branded a witch and assaulted by her neighbours in Lake Gardens.

 After Metro reported the assault last week, a five-member team visited the area on Tuesday and will submit its findings to city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. 

 Panel member Bharati Mutsuddi, who was part of the five-member investigation team, on Sunday said: ?We have started a suo motu investigation and have spoken to officers of Charu Market police station, the assaulted woman and some neighbours, including those who allegedly beat her up.?

 Others on the team included Rama Das, vice-chairperson of the commission, and member Shyamashree Das.

 According to Mutsuddi, the Poddar family, the neighbours who allegedly assaulted Jaya, believed she practised black magic for which members of the Poddar family remained chronically ill. 

 ?It is because of her witchcraft that I suffer from chronic giddiness,? Abha Poddar had told Metro. 

 They allegedly pulled Jaya by her hair and repeatedly called her a witch, beat her black and blue with a broom and almost pulled off her sari. 

 The commission team spoke to Jaya and some other neighbours who provided valuable information, Mutsuddi said. 

 Commission officers feel the need to launch awareness campaigns against superstitious beliefs and practices.

 ?It is evident that superstition related to witchcraft and black magic prevails in many areas, and is not just restricted to villages. We are planning to launch an awareness programme in this locality,? the commission member said. This is intended to enable people from different walks of life to come together and help remove such fears from the minds of people.

 ?However, police have to do their bit. We gathered that officers of Charu Market police station have said that any further complaint would lead to severe action being taken against the offenders,? Mutsuddi said.

 An awareness programme was launched on Friday in Changual village of West Midnapore, over 130 km from Calcutta, where a woman was allegedly beaten up by a couple who claimed that thereby, they would exorcise a spirit that inhabited her body. The woman, Panchami Singh, who was suffering from anaemia, died later. 

 Immediately after this incident in June, the commission started an investigation. Commission chairperson Jashodhara Bagchi was herself present, along with Mutsuddi and Rama Das, during Friday?s visit to the village.

 ?Panchami?s family was told that an evil spirit had entered her body and she had turned into a witch. So the spirit needed to be exorcised. To drive out the spirit, she was beaten up severely by the couple, who claimed they were exorcists, and Panchami died later, as a result. No one rescued her then because most villagers were convinced that the spirit was actually inside her,? said Mutsuddi. 

 Three persons were arrested in this connection. Commission members visited the village on Saturday to begin an awareness programme. 

 ?The response was extremely good, and nearly a thousand villagers ? including 900 women ? had turned up. They were told that superstition might lead to such deaths. Only proper treatment could have saved Panchami,? Mutsuddi added.

 The daily contests will be held from 11 am, at the college. Turn up to take part or cheer the participants.

 In addition, you can cut the queue at the venue with Airtel Friendz. Call and book tickets. For each booking, the caller will have to pay Rs 10. A logo appears on the phone. Show it at the gate and walk through.

Plus, Presidency Special Ringtones are on offer. Dial

 On a mission

Fundraising for tsunami victims, fun and games for 

underprivileged kids, free cataract operations for the poor... Phew! The youngsters 

of Chowringhee High School have been busy. The students raised money for tsunami 

victims through a rally in their area on January 8, collecting Rs 15,000. Of this 

amount, Rs 5,000 they gave to the ABP Tsunami Fund, and the remaining was handed 

over to minister Sunil Dutt on January 29. The next day, they held a sit-and-draw 

contest for the students of Ghoshpur, their adopted village, with gifts for the 

winners. The young boys and girls of Chowringhee High School also helped 12 patients 

get cataract operations for free. The pre and post-operative care was arranged 

by students Premnath Thakur and Ajay Kumar Das. Put your hands together for these 

youngsters, ladies and gentlemen. They surely deserve it.

by the institute recently.

Question hour

Answering tough questions is a classroom classic. 

But it?s obviously something we can?t get enough of. Three quizzes have done the 

rounds of the city ? and the country ? recently. First up, on February 8, was 

the Wai Wai Quiz eastern region final. About 32 schools participated, with eight 

teams vying for the challenge trophy. And the winner was... Birla High School 

(boys), represented by Siddhant Agarwal, Nikhil Jhanji and Shourodip Roy. The 

first runner up was Apeejay School, Salt Lake, followed by Don Bosco, Park Circus. 

Then, on February 18, was the Junior Inter-school Quiz organised by Birla High 

School (girls). There was reason to cheer for the little ladies ? St James came 

out on top of the 10 teams, but in the second and third place were the host and 

La Martiniere for Girls. And finally, Tata Crucible ? The Campus Quiz national 

finals was held on February 21. IIM Calcutta made it to Mumbai for the event, 

but ICFAI Business School, Chennai, took home the trophy. 

 Time to talk

Communication skills was the focus of two seminars 

this week, from tots to teens and beyond. Let?s start with the little ones. The 

workshop on behaviour modification at Little Champions Montessori House was for 

their parents, actually. Dr Aniruddha Deb, psychiatrist, and Zena Deb, psychologist, 

spoke to parents about programmes that aim to stop undesired behaviour among kids. 

The stress should be on developing communications skills, rather than simply speech, 

added Deb. Other topics, too, were addressed, like genetic counselling and the 

guilt problems of parents with children with special needs. On January 21 was 

communication skills development programme at Prafulla Chandra College, for the 

students. Updating the education system to include communication in the curriculum, 

how to find and excel in one?s area of interest, written communication, writing 

ad copies, body language, the importance of interviews, competition... The packed 

programme with talks from eminent personalities in various fields left 42 students 

from different colleges inspired and motivated.

Around 500 students from over 40 schools 

took part in the 2005 TTIS YMCA Inter-school Athletic Meet held on February 

11 and 12.

Helping hands

People have been coming forward in many ways to help 

the tsunami victims. But never is it too much. Kalyani Central Model School held 

a two-day carnival on February 5 and 6, to raise funds for the cause. Several 

schools stepped in to lend a helping hand. There were about 25 stalls and several 

contests, books, food and plenty of fun. TTIS conducted a school quiz, 

in which the host team emerged winners. There was much singing, dancing and masti. 

But the money collected will be used for a cause.

 Coming up...

The weekend brimmeth over with activities of varied 

kinds. On Saturday, Apeejay Anand Children?s Library is organising a workshop 

with children of different schools for the age-group six to 12. Underprivileged 

kids will paint T-shirts on the lawns of Apeejay House, from 10 am to 1 pm. Joyland 

Play, Nursery and Kindergarten School will host a fete at Calcutta Club Sports 

Complex, from 10 am to 2 pm. The proceeds will go to Anandan, an NGO educating

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crime and punishment

 In celebration of its 15th anniversary, Swabak?s on-going Calcutta Theatre Festival (April 10 - 12) features, besides theatre performances, seminars and discussions on drama and felicitation of noted literary and theatre personalities. Among the programmes slated for this evening is Shasti, a play produced by Swabak. Based on a short story by Tagore, it is a tale which explores exploitation and hypocrisy in their various facets. Abused and tortured by the zamindar?s agent, brothers Dukhiram and Chhidam, ironically, rely on his advice when a grave calamity befalls them. Thus, Chandara, Chhidam?s young, innocent wife, is made the scapegoat to save Dukhiram from the consequences of murdering his wife. Chandara?s feelings of shock and betrayal at this turn of events and, finally, her total apathy to her fate, sums up the hollowness of justice for the poor and the ignorant. Direction and acting: Nilima Chakraborty. Tomorrow: Nandikar?s Chokh Gyalo.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Shasti, produced by Swabak

 When: Today at 6 pm

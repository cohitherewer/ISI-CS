 Adding to the plethora of personal care products in the market, Marico has launched Silk--Shine, a post-wash hair conditioner.

 To promote it, the company organised a hair styling workshop at Tantra, the nightclub at The Park on Friday. Hair stylist Jolly from Satin Rose showcased some trendy hairstyles on models Sayantani, Devdutta, Ishika and Shreya.

 The leave-in conditioner, enriched with fruit extracts and Vitamin E, is being pitched as an easy way to replicate the parlour look at home.

 Silk--Shine gives your dull and tangled tresses a soft and silky look in minutes, even if you are too busy to visit a parlour, said a spokesperson for Marico at the session, which will also be held at other parts of the country.

 The conditioner can be applied by running the fingers through the hair, or by bunching it up, depending on the desired effect.

 The product can be used to add the professional touch to straight hair or a fringe, to get the fresh-out-of-the-shower effect, or gloss over a swept-up style.

 The product is available across retail outlets, chemists and cosmetics shops.

 Reach out

 It aims to lend a helping hand to the creatively challenged. Me, a communication platform, has just been launched in the city, promising to help all those wishing to reach out to the masses.

 A large number of individuals and business houses find it difficult to reach out to the people they want to. We are trying to help them speak out, says Sushovan Chaudhuri, director, Me.

 The firm has in its repertoire a range of communication solutions including catchy outdoor hoardings, interesting websites and even direct marketing strategies.

 While we want to help businesses speak out, we also have a wing for the glamour industry of the city, and we will help market models and celebrities in a professional manner, adds Chaudhuri.

 Live act

 Cloud 9, the resto-bar at The Astor, is usually known for its peppy tracks (remixes and retro) that keep the crowd on the floor.

 But on Wednesday, Cloud 9 rocked to a different beat. A rock band, not a DJ, kept everyones feet tapping. Rudra, the rock band, was dishing out all-time favourite soft rock and pop numbers.

 Having live bands is a trend nowadays. Contrary to commercial tracks the DJs play, the band has been instructed to stick to rock, said a spokesperson of the resto-bar. Also heard were pop tracks like Summer of 69, Pretty Woman and Every Breath You Take.

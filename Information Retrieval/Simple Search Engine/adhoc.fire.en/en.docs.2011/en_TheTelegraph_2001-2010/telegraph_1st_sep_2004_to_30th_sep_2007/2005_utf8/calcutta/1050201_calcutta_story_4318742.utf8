 Partition pangs

 Perhaps the most controversial and misunderstood writer of his time, Saadat Hasan Manto finally earned recognition nearly 50 years after his death, with his short stories being translated and simultaneously dramatised in several Indian languages. In its latest project, conceived in the form of a series of three collages, Rangakarmee proposes to offer a comprehensive understanding of the humanism that Manto represented. Sarhad Paar Manto, the second collage of the series, focuses on his better-known stories on Partition. Featuring a double-bill of Khol Do and Toba Tek Singh, the stories are born out of the pain that the author carried with him in his own experience of exile. In both stories, Sirajuddin (inKhol Do) and Bishan Singh (in Toba Tek Singh) feel the shock of Partition as a terrible wrench. Through the loss of sanity of both characters, Manto seems to suggest that madness alone can bring a sufferer to terms with the horror of a country torn apart by communal politics. The two short plays are woven together with ironic snippets written by Manto and narrated by Usha Ganguli, who also directs.

 Rs 4.18-cr upgrade for Howrah?s health

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The health department has decided to make over the healthcare system in Howrah, spending well over Rs 4.18 crore on upgrading 50 health units in Howrah town and other areas.

 The ambitious project will be carried out under the Centre?s National Rural Health Mission and the state?s Health System Development Initiative.

 Elaborating on the proposed upgrade, Howrah chief medical officer of health (CMOH) Sankar Saha said: ?Initially, eight block primary health centres (BPHCs) and 42 primary health centres (PHCs) will be upgraded under the two schemes.?

 Describing the proposed makover ?a sea change? in Howrah?s healthcare infrastructure, Saha said the five BPHCs will be upgraded to 30-bed healthcare facilities.

 Besides, doctors, nursing staff and other necessary manpower and instrumental and medicinal back-up will be added to those health centres. 

 The five BPSCs to be upgraded are Jagadishpur in Jagachha; Kamalpur, Brindabanpur and Manikpur in Uluberia; and Mugkalyanpur in Bagnan. 

 ?The upgrade work will soon begin at these BPHCs,? the CMOH said.

 Besides, a similar process of upgrade has already been initiated at three BPHCs. They are at Kulai in Panchla, Hazi ST Mullick in Sankrail and Jhunjhuni in Shyampur, he added.

 The BPSCs were selected on the basis of ?patient load? on the health centres.

 ?First of all, we identified which health centres cater to the maximum number of people. Besides, road connectivity, availability of electricity and water and existing infrastructure have also been taken into account,? he added.

 All the BPSCs to be made over will get operating theatres, X-ray and ambulance facilities, labour rooms and other emergency facilities. Medicine supply will be doubled to those health centres.

 ?Around Rs 2.50 crore will initially be spent on upgrading the BPSCs,? the CMOH said. The funds will be expended in constructing buildings and electrical back-ups. 

 ?We will supply necessary funds later for instruments, and medicinal and other infrastructural development for the BPHCs. It is difficult to say off-hand the total project cost,? he said.

 Besides, major infrastructural development will be undertaken in 42 PHCs.

 A doctor?s room and an examination room will be set up and medicine supply increased at three PHCs in 14 blocks. About Rs 1.68 crore will be spent on the upgrade.

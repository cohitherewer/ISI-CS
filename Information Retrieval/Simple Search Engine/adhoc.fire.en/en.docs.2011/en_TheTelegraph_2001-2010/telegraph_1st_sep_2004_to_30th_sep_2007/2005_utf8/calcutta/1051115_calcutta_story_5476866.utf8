 Eviction blueprint ready

 - November 24 deadline for settlers to vacate shanties

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The blueprint for the eviction of illegal settlers along the banks of Rabindra Sarobar was drawn up at the Lalbazar police headquarters on Monday. 

 Various government and private agencies attended the meeting called by police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to discuss the eviction. A government official described the two-hour meet as the first step towards implementing the high court?s directive.

 ?The date of eviction is yet to be finalised. The role that the agencies will play was discussed today,? stated Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 The agencies, including Calcutta Municipal Corporation, CESC, Eastern Railway, Government Railway Police and South 24-Parganas Police, have agreed to help the city cops in every way on eviction day. 

 ?This time, we are set to carry out the court?s order. We will have to complete the eviction by November 30, the deadline set by the high court,? added Sharma. ?We will hold more talks to finalise the date for starting the eviction process.? 

 According to the cops, the eviction will be carried out between November 25 and November 30. ?The settlers can vacate their shanties by November 24,? said an officer.

 The high court had directed the police to deploy an officer of the rank of assistant commissioner round-the-clock at the Lake police station or police outpost. The cops were directed to approach the squatters and convince them to vacate their shanties.

 ?The settlers have to write to us within seven days, expressing their willingness to vacate their huts. The November-24 deadline will not be extended,? asserted an officer.

 ?None of the 5,500 shanty-dwellers have, till date, expressed an intention to leave the spot,? he added.

 About 1,000 squatters, including 200 women and children, took out a procession from Rabindra Sarobar on Monday afternoon to protest the proposed eviction drive.

 ?They had a plan to march to Rabindra Sadan, where film festival screenings were being held. A large contingent of police, led by deputy commissioner (south) N.R. Babu, stopped the squatters at Hazra crossing,? said Sharma.

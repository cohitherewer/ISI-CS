 Femme force is ruling the city?s night life ? and we?re not just talking footfall here. A hawk-eyed, baton-wielding security guard, a manager stationed at the door to scan each entrant, a customer relationship executive mingling with the guests? All women, on top.

 From Tantra to B.E.D, Red Lounge to Roxy, women hold the key to our night haunts. Whether giving out ?we are safe, we are clean? signals or upping the glamour quotient, the ploy seems to be working just fine.

 ?Having female staff in key positions is an exercise to give a more women-friendly image to our night clubs,? says Anirban Simlai of The Park. This can, of course, be directly attributed to the rise in female footfall. ?The number of women who party alone has gone up more than 50 per cent. They come in droves through the week. So, there are activities and strategies revolving around this emerging clientele,? admits Simlai.

 The change of gender guard is just not cosmetic. ?Girls tackle a tricky situation more sensibly, without hurting the ego of the customer. With a difficult customer, the boys are more prone to lose their cool,? says Megha Vohra, managing director, B.E.D, on Ballygunge Circular Road.

 Half her team is female ? two managers and two disc jockeys. ?I hope someday I will have an all-girls? team to run the night club because they are amiable and creative? The comfort level at work is very high,? smiles Megha.

 Even those manning the gates till dawn are not complaining. ?Anybody would fancy a warm smile from a beautiful lady at the entrance. The presence of a woman does make the club more attractive for revellers,? admits Hem Dhillon, manager of B.E.D.

 Handle with care is the motto for night clubs crowning women guest relationship managers. ?Taking care of high-profile guests comes naturally to women,? says Jitson Wangmo Rinchen, guest relationship manager at Roxy, the cocktail bar at The Park.

 ?The male guests behave decently and the female guests find me more approachable,? says Andrea Boston, customer relationship officer at Red Kitchen and Lounge in Alipore.

 Having a female force at hand also helps the management handle awkward situations involving women revellers. ?The lady security guards check all the ladies coming in. If someone gets drunk or feels unwell, the lady attendants take necessary steps,? says Simlai.

 Most party people are not cribbing. ?When partying with my wife, I am always wary of the safety factor. The presence of female managers and attendants is reassuring,? says disc regular Vivek Kaul.

 But then, men have their uses, too. ?If somebody gets drunk and creates a scene, you need male attendants to step in,? feels party-hopper Richa Srimal.

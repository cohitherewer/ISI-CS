 Dazzling start to designer dreams

 Talk of young talent in the fashion field and our city seems to be overflowing with it. After aspiring designers Ruhee Shah and Ruth Alison Narjinari made it to the finals of Lakme Fashion House earlier this year, it was another student stylists turn to steal the show at yet another national meet.

 Poonam Malpani ? final-year student of National Institute of Fashion Technology ? won the best design collection award at a confluence of graduating Niftians held in Hyderabad recently. Poonam had bagged the same title at the graduating show of NIFT, Calcutta earlier this month. 

 The Hyderabad meet saw winners of various categories from all seven NIFT centres across the country (Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Gandhinagar) vying for the final awards. 

 This is the first time a student of NIFT Calcutta walked away with the best design collection award, the most prestigious title for graduating students at the confluence. The only other time a Calcutta name had featured on the list of final awardees was when Sabyasachi Mukherjee won the viewers choice award way back in 1999.

 Its a great achievement for me to be judged the best among all NIFT students of my batch. More so because the judges included top designers like David Abraham and Narendra Kumar and even someone from Japan, says Poonam.

 Her winning collection titled East Meets East draws inspiration from Japanese street wear and Indian culture. Its a winter club line with lots of fun elements. Its for the kidult who has a fetish for cute things, she smiles.

 Surface ornamentation with buttons, mirrors, conch shells, pom poms, crochet, polka dots, cartoon prints and soft toys add the fun factor to the tees, jackets and skirts. 

 The 21-year-old has already been signed up by a Mumbai-based export house, which she believes will give her the requisite experience before she ventures to launch her own label.

 A natural canvas

 The beauty of Nature has always been the focus of Phalguni Dasguptas art. The ongoing exhibition of his watercolours celebrates his vision of life as he comprehends it through his experiences with the natural world. His themes, refreshingly simple and scrupulously avoiding any sociological implication, express the artist?s fond pre-occupation with a carefree life within the folds of a benevolent, bounteous nature. Sharing a lifetime affair with watercolours, his works show excellent innovation and experimentation in his use of pigments, mixture of brush strokes and colours as well as in the texture of the paper. Driven by his instincts, beliefs and emotions, Dasgupta?s paintings are a true reflection of his mind and communicate to the viewer, without any pretension, all that the artist loves and treasures. Such is the simplicity of his approach to art, that common men can easily identify with his birds and beasts, his figures, both human and divine, and his representation of nature as his home in the world.

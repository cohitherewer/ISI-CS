 Medical student 

kills self

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 24-year-old final-year student of MBBS at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital committed suicide late on Tuesday by hanging himself in his hostel in Giri Babu Lane, in the Bowbazar police station area. 

 The youth, identified as Sanjiv Mishra, from Madhubani, in Bihar, hanged himself in the second-floor bathroom. He was dead by the time his roommates discovered him around midnight.

 Police found a suicide note in Sanjiv?s room that said: ?Ma, I am feeling lonely. Please forgive me, I am going. In my next life, I shall come back to you.?

 ?We can make out from the note that depression and loneliness led the student to take such a drastic step. We will have to check why he was depressed,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (central division).

 According to the staff of the hostel, Sanjiv was unlike the others. ?He was an introvert. After returning from hospital, he either used to study or read books and newspapers,? said Baburam Kundu, a staff member. ?But he was also popular.?

 Other students and Sanjiv?s friends said he was a brilliant student and passed all examinations with distinction. 

 ?When we saw him last night, we did not realise that he was about to take his life,? said one of his friends. 

 Sanjiv?s father, Surendra, rushed to the city on hearing about the death.

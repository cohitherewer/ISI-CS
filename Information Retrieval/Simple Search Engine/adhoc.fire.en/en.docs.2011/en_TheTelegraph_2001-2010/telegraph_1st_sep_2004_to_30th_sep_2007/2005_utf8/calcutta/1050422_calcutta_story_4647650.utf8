 Baghdad Burning: Girl Blog From Iraq may not be a very good play, but the production is sure attracting attention. For, it is the only political drama in New York written from the point of view of an Iraqi who lived through the American invasion. And, for better or worse, it inaugurates an entirely new (and seemingly inevitable) theatrical genre ? the blog play.

 Melding two chic cultural forms, the documentary drama and the blog (a web diary of sorts), the Six Figures Theatre Company has turned the online writings of Riverbend, the pseudonym for a 25-year-old Baghdad woman who has become something of an Internet celebrity, into a dramatically awkward series of readings.

 Instead of building a character, the show includes readings of her words from three women and one man, which adds to the muddled feel.

 Riverbend is a thoughtful writer whose articulate, even poetic, prose packs an emotional punch while exhibiting a journalist?s eye for detail. She is decidedly anti-war and critical of the Bush administration, but not polemical. 

 Judging from the play, the tone of her writing about the war is one of exasperated disappointment. Log on to www.riverbendblog.blogspot.com for more.

 Hollywood actress Christina Applegate has finally staged her Broadway debut Sweet Charity, after two months of apprehension ever since she broke her foot during rehearsals. 

 The Emmy award-winning actress who starred in The Sweetest Thing, Wonderland and Surviving Christmas, plays the lead role of Charity Hope Valentine, a kind-hearted dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man.

 Applegate had auditioned for the role, once coveted by Jenna Elfman, Marisa Tomei and Jane Krakowski, in December 2003. She was officially declared to play Charity in March 2004 and the show was slated to open in April 21, 2005 at Al Hirschfeld Theatre. 

 But during a rehearsal in February this year, Applegate injured her foot after missing a step around a lamppost. The show?s producers wanted to carry on with a standby, while Applegate went for treatment. 

 In March, the play opened for a two-week run with Charlotte d?Amboise as Charity but fetched average reviews, following which the producers decided to shelve the project. 

 But Applegate intervened and insisted that the show go on. 

 Applegate, who shot to fame as the blonde beauty Kelly Bundy in the TV sitcom Married With Children, said that it had been her dream to play Charity. 

 She has reportedly passed on roles in the Broadway versions of Chicago and Nine (starring Antonio Banderas) for Sweet Charity. 

 The lead role was first essayed by Gwen Verdon in the 1966 musical by Neil Simon, Cy Coleman and Dorothy Fields. Shirley MacLaine starred in the 1969 film version. 

 The production, to be directed by Walter Bobbie (a Tony Award winner for the Broadway hit Chicago), will open on Broadway on May 4. 

 It has begun previews at Al Hirschfeld Theatre on April 11.

 Tea Colada, Mango Cha, Rose Petal Tea, brownies and ice cream, waffles and honey, flavoured popcorn? Sounds like a perfect hangout? Not unless you fancy spending time in hospitals. But if a medical emergency were to call on your family, the impatient hours in the waiting room just became somewhat sweeter at one city hospital.

 The unusual venue of this gastronomic offering is Woodlands Medical Centre. To liven up the usually stressful hospital experience, the Camellia Tea Bar of the Assam Company has set up shop at the Alipore lobby on March 1, in a first-of-its-kind initiative for the city. 

 ?To provide clients with the best service has always been the motive of the hospital. So, when the Assam Tea Company approached us with the idea of setting up a tea bar, we were sold on it,? says Sumedha Sen, chief executive officer, Woodlands.

 The Camellia Tea Bar has already tasted success at Saturday Club, Calcutta Swimming Club and CC amp;FC. ?Our objective is to provide good and hygienic food and a customer-friendly staff,? said a spokesperson for Assam Company Limited. 

 It has injected a dose of cheer to the premises as well, with the old cafeteria?s plastic furniture giving way to wrought-iron chairs and wooden tables.

 Camellia has shifted focus from the conservative middle-aged tea drinker to more experimental consumers of all ages. Masala Tea, Dhaba Special, Saffron Tea, Watermelon Tea, Lemon Ice Tea, Litchi Tea and Hopper Sipper are some of the tantalising varieties that will be served, at prices ranging between Rs 5 and Rs 40.

 Shakes, in flavours like mango, litchi, vanilla and chocolate will be available, priced between Rs 12 and Rs 25. A quick bite will also be dished out, including Chocolate Cake, Tea Cake, Croissant Cheese and Brownies, at between Rs 15 and Rs 20.

 The hospital venue demands special attention to hygiene. ?We will be serving tea in disposable eco-friendly cups instead of plastic. The staff will also wear disposable gloves while dealing with the customers,? assures the Camellia spokesperson.

Texture trail

 Here?s another young fashion design graduate making an effort to set out on her own. Atrayee Basu, a year 2000 product of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), Calcutta, has already gone national with her year-old label.

 Retailing out of Espee, the Rawdon Street boutique where the likes of Sabysachi Mukherjee started out, and Kyra, the young designer?s work is also adorning the racks of some of the better known outlets across the country and a few in the UK, too. Her style ? blending ethnic and western elements ? gains individuality from her trademark texturing of fabric.

 ?I prefer texturing to embroidery to achieve the same richness,? says Atrayee. For example, she would add texture to her base fabric and embellish it with metal sequins and plates, rather than go for the straightforward zardosi look.

 Her cuts range from the classic to the contemporary. While she is experimenting with the ethnic look, Atrayee prefers to steer clear from the traditional sari and lehnga. 

 ?I prefer making those on order and still don?t produce a range of them,? she explains.

 The designer is ready with her summer collection that is available at Espee and Kyra.

Mother courage

 Tell that tale where you stoked the fire within you and stood up to fight for your rights. For, the stage is set for the eight open mike session of That Takes Ovaries. 

 The movement started by Rivka Solomon in Boston as a podium for women to voice their acts of courage touched Calcutta in 2002.

 Ever since, the city has witnessed a bunch of spunky women from all walks of life gathering at the sessions to share their experiences against discrimination, communalism and gender bias.

 To be hosted by Thoughtshop Foundation, Spandan and State AIDS Prevention amp; Control Society on International Women?s Day, this year?s show will start on a dramatic note with Lee Alison Sibley, Renu Roy and Mira Kakkar reading out plays from Solomon?s That Takes Ovaries! Bold Females and Their Brazen Acts. The book is a collection of real-life accounts of women and girls about the gutsy things they have done. 

 ?We invite ordinary women to talk about things they had taken for granted. Once they share their stories they feel good and that motivates others to come up with their stories too. The accounts are bold or brash, in-your-face or outrageous,? says Kakkar.

 On March 8, That Takes Ovaries starts at 5.30 pm at the Oberoi Grand.

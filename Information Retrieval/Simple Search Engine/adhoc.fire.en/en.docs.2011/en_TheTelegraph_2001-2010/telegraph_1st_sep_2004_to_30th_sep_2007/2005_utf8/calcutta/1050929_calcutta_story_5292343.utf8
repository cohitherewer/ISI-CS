 The festive season is much more than just about clothes and fashion accessories ? its boom time for toy manufacturers, too. And leading the race, in this age of video games and electronic gizmos, are the good old soft toys. The reason is that the scope and range of soft toys has expanded greatly in the last decade. 

 Soft toys are no longer just kiddy items. They are unisex products in great demand from teenagers looking for gift items during Valentines Day and other festivities. There is also a growing trend of using soft toys for home or car d?cor and lifestyle products. Manufacturers are coming up with cushions with Disney characters which are in great demand during the festival season because that is when people try to do up their homes in a big way, said Paul De Gamma, manager, Landmark, Emami shopping centre. 

 The sale of soft toys picks up from the Pujas, through Valentines Day, Christmas and New Year, said Subir Biswas of Play--Pets, which launched its latest Premium Range at The Golden Park on Tuesday.

 ay--Pets is a product of Hanung, one of the largest soft toy manufacturers in India. Based in Noida, Hanung has an annual turnover of US $ 15 million and exports toys to leading retailers in Sweden, Germany, the US and other countries. 

 Our brands Muskan (economy range for small outlets), Play--Pets (for the upwardly mobile) and Play--Pets Premium (for high-end buyers) dominate almost every store and city mall. Today we deal with a buyer who is quality conscious and is not satisfied just buying toys off the pavements. The items have to look good and be made of good material. People care more for the safety and comfort of children and are willing to pay for it, said Biswas of Play--Pets. 

 With an immense factory and in-house designing unit, Hanung has a product range of over 7,000 designs and production capacity of 30,000 pieces a day.

 In Bengal the Pujas are a time of homecoming and many people dont come with enough gifts. Clothes and accessories are generally bought by parents but the kids expect toys from guests, and since our toys are uniformly priced people can get the same item at the same price whether in Mumbai, Delhi or Calcutta, said Biswas. 

 Hanung has a wide range of keepsakes for teenagers. The toys are mostly the same, the usual teddies or cartoon characters, but they come holding messages appropriate for occasions like I Love U, Happy Birthday etc. There are also toys with zodiac signs and beanbags. 

 The huggable toys come as large and small animals, fruits and hearts, appealing primarily through their feel (furry, soft or silky) or their kinky designs. 

 But there is another set of buyers, those looking for infant products. For some reason a number parents want to redecorate their nurseries around this time. They ask for specific themes like the Winnie the Pooh motif, said De Gamma. The soft toys cost anything from Rs 49 to Rs 2,000.

 A number of new stores have recently mushroomed that cater only infant products, like Little Shop at Forum and Just Kidding on Park Street. Some of these stores have shown interest in Hanungs new infant accessories ? Play Pool, Play Gym and Infant Sofa ? which cost around Rs 2,000 a set. 

 The soft-sided play pen shaped like a pool can be rolled up when not in use. While the Gym is perfect for the energetic and curious infant who can clamber up the all-soft monkey-bar like contraption with its array of soft rattles and reflective surfaces. The cosy infant sofa set can be opened out to allow the child to lie down.

 Though there are still some companies importing soft toys like Mahindra Inter Trade with their brand Soft Wonders and individual manufacturers like Calcuttas Niki Arts and Toys, Hanung is not worried. Not even about the Chinese products, because only we can offer a huge range, said Biswas. 

 And at every toy store, there are great expectations from these little wonders.

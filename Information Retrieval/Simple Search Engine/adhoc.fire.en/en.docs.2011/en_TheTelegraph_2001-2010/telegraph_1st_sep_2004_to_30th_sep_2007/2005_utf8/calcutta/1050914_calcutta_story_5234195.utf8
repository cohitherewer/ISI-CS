 Jailed for making fake oil

 - Trademark infringement leads to arrest of trio in Rajkot

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Justice Dilip Kumar Seth of Calcutta High Court on Tuesday sent three owners of Neeranand Oil Industries, a Gujarat-based company, to Alipore Central jail. The trio was arrested in Rajkot by Gujarat police, and later handed over to Bengal police on Monday.

 Mitesh and Aswini Thacker and Mehul Nathuvani, owners of the oil company, were arrested for allegedly using the trademark of Dey?s Medical and minting money by manufacturing fake Keo-Karpin hair oil and other products. 

 They were selling the products in eastern India, including Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal. 

 Tuesday?s court order followed a contempt petition by Dey?s Medical Stores Private Limited, alleging that despite Calcutta High Court?s directive, the oil company owners were using their trademark and selling fake Keo-Karpin and other products in Gujarat and Maharashtra.

 Appearing on behalf of Dey?s Medical, advocate Ajoy Gupta told the court that the owners of the oil company in Gujarat had violated rules by infringing on the trademark and copyright registration of his client?s company.

 On the basis of the Dey?s Medical plea, Justice Seth had directed the police to ensure the presence of the accused before him. 

 But the police, in their report submitted before the court on August 8, stated that the accused had already shifted their company to Gujarat. 

 ?It is impossible for police to arrest the accused without the assistance of our counterparts in Maharashtra and Gujarat,? police said.

 The court then passed an order asking the director-general (DG) of the state police to seek the help of the DGs of Maharashtra and Gujarat to arrest the accused. 

 The court also directed the state police to produce the accused before it on September 15.

 The DG, West Bengal, communicated with his counterparts in Maharashtra and Gujarat and the trio was arrested.

 A big force of the city police came to Calcutta High Court on Tuesday and requested advocate-general Balai Ray to inform the court about the arrests.

 Though the matter was listed on Tuesday?s cause list, the advocate-general moved the case as an unlisted motion. 

 The court adjourned the hearing till 2 pm on Wednesday.

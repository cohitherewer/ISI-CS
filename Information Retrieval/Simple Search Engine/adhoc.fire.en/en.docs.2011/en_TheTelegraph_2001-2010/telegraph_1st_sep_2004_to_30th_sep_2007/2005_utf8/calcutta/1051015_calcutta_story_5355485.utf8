 Plastic quells pickpockets 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five years ago, Sheikh Naseem was one of the most wanted pickpockets in the city. He is equally wanted now, but not for lifting wallets. He is now known for his expertise in snatching valuables at gun-point. Like Naseem, there are others who have shifted from picking pockets to other crimes. 

 A study carried out by the city police has revealed that the shift has been caused by changing lifestyles. 

 ?This is the age of plastic money. Now, people don?t carry cash in their wallets. They use credit or debit cards. Stealing a wallet with three or four cards brings no money to pickpockets,? said an officer of the detective department?s anti-snatching wing.

 ?Initially, we had no idea why the pickpocket count was dwindling. A clearer picture emerged only after we interrogated some snatchers,? said an officer of Jorasanko police station.

 A number of snatchers confessed to being new to the trade. ?They told us they used to pick pockets on buses or trains. But the experience was disappointing. On more than one occasion, the wallets they swiped had several cards, but the cash did not total more than Rs 300,? said another sleuth.

 The pickpockets-turned-snatchers revealed another interesting feature. 

 ?Most of the ?workshops?, where pickpockets have to undergo a year?s training, have been shut down. The training sessions are very crucial for recruits. They are taught to identify a person carrying a sizeable wad of cash and lift a wallet smoothly from his pocket,? said the sleuth.

 The detectives find a direct link in the dwindling count of pickpockets and the spurt in snatchings. 

 Those who were snatchers have turned to robbery. ?All wanted robbers are in jail for the past five years. The space has been taken over by snatchers, who are not facing any competition,? said an officer of the dacoity wing. ?This is also a reason why robbery has resurfaced after a gap of five years.?

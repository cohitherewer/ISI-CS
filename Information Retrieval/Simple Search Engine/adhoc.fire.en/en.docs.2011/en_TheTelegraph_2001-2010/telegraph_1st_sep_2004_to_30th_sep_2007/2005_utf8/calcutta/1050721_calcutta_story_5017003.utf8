The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fardeen and the F-factor 

 Tuesday night was the F-thing at the Taj nightclub, Incognito, with Fardeen Khan firing up the Fantastic Females Party, organised by International Lux Body Wash. After a couple of hours of breathless wait, when the oh-so-cool dude stepped on to the bustling dance floor, the girls made it known, loud and clear, that all they wanted was to have some fun. ?We love you, Fardeen,? was the collective cry from the crowd of 200-odd. While cute Kalindi won the contest and got to dine with the man of the moment, Fardeen did take some time out to chat with reporters?

 On No Entry: There?s excitement and nervousness around my next release. This is the first time I?m doing an out-and-out comedy. I have done a bit of comedy before but in No Entry I have really made an effort to make people laugh. My character in the film is basically someone who?s come up the hard way and treasures the one cap which his father gave him and something which stays with him throughout the film. He becomes, kind of, the fall guy who has to handle pressure situations and that leads to a series of comic situations. Director Anees Bazmee is one of the finest writer-directors we have in the country.

 The other comic multistarrer: Shaadi No. 1 is about three neighbours and their wives. I am the sober of the three guys alongside Sharman Joshi and my cousin Zayed Khan. It?s a typical David Dhawan film where logic takes a back seat and you just let things ride... go with the flow. David and Anees are from completely different schools of film-making. Every director has his own brand. While comedy is the forte of both directors, for David it is the spontaneity on the sets which counts. In Anees?s film, we usually go by the script. Both the styles have their own advantages and disadvantages.

 On his Calcutta co-stars: That Celina (Jaitley) and I have done one film together (Janasheen) before doing No Entry did help and our comfort levels were high on the sets. The two films, though, are completely different from each other. Here, both of us play comic characters. Then there?s Koena Mitra in the Pritish Nandy Communications film, Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena, which is a thriller. She is extremely talented, a hard worker and very eager to learn. Koena is also very brave ? in the couple of action scenes we did, she sported a smile.

 On marriage: What will my female fans feel once I get married? Well, I?ll ask Hrithik, Shah Rukh and Aamir to answer that one. Seriously, I am sure there will be a certain section of my fans who will be disappointed at my marriage but at the same time I feel that somewhere deep down they will be happy, knowing I am happy. My fiancee Natasha and I have known and seen each other as two very normal people in a normal context. You can say, I have given myself to her...

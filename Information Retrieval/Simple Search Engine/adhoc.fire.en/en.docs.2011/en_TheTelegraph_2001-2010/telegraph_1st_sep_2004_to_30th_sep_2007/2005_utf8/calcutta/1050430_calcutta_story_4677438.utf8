 Bitter-sweet taste of life

 Childhood traumas leave psychological scars that can haunt for life. Moreover, taunts, derision, neglect and lack of understanding damage the victim?s life as an adult, preventing the victim from leading a normal life. Unfortunately, few are willing to discuss or share experiences of childhood abuse, which only increases their mental agony and suffering. Working with real-life incidents of child abuse from Pinky Virani?s bestseller, Bitter Chocolate, the play, directed by Arvind Gaur, highlights victims? fear of being ostracised and the social stigma associated with such abuse. Charged with a power-packed solo performance by Lushin Dubey, the play promises to shake the viewers out of their stupor of wilful ignorance and complacence, making them aware of their responsibilities as socially-conscious citizens. Playing several characters ? a manipulative lawyer, a disbelieving mother, a cynical policeman, a deceptive guru-turned-abuser, among others ? Dubey?s performance delves deep into the psyche of a tormented child and the travails of his/her family, to paint devastating pictures of aberrant morality.

 When: Today at 7.30 pm

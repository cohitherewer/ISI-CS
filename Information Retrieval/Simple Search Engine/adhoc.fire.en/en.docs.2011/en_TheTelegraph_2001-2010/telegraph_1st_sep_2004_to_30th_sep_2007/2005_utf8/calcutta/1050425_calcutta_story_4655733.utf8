 Code on water supply

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to draft a universal plan for standardising water quality and submit it to the State Planning Board.

 ?It is essentially a codification of common rules and regulations that the civic body will have to follow to ensure the supply of safe drinking water,? said CMC?s chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury on Sunday.

 Contamination in the water supply usually occurs due to lack of maintenance and monitoring by the civic authorities or because of negligence on the part of the households. 

 The proposed rules and regulations will, therefore, have a section for each of the two possibilities.

 The rules make it mandatory for all civic bodies having their own water treatment plants to set up laboratories where physical, chemical, bacteriological and mineralogical tests of water samples collected from different distribution points can be carried out regularly.

 According to an official in the State Planning Board, it has been principally agreed upon that the local councillors will be duty-bound to monitor redressing of contamination problems at the households. 

 They will have to oversee that private reservoirs in their localities are cleaned at least twice a month.

 Leaky pipelines at houses, unclean reservoirs, water supply lines submerged in filthy water because of clogged and overflowing drains or their proximity to overflowing septic tanks are some of the potential causes for contamination in the potable water supplied by civic authorities.

 It has also been suggested in the draft proposal that if a landlord is reluctant to change a leaky pipeline, then the tenant will have the right to change it by realising the expenses from the rent.

 The CMC?s water supply department collects water samples after distribution from 50 points daily and tests them at the laboratory at its headquarters.

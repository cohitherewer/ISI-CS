The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Schools log in to tree drive

 SOMENATH MUKHERJEE, deputy conservator of forests (urban and recreational forestry), met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Lalit Singh Nahar, G. Laha, Chandrima Ghosh, Sandip Banerjee, Diptimoy Ghosh, Jitendranth Das, Amit Roychowdhury and Soumya Ghosh

Diptimoy Ghosh: Every year, your department distributes saplings among people free of cost. Do you maintain a record of how the saplings are utilised?

 Last year, we took steps to assess the impact of the free sapling-distribution programme. We maintained a record of the names and addresses of people who collected saplings from us and later, wrote to them. Many responded, but quite a few did not. 

 We undertook a survey and found that only around 48 per cent of the saplings had actually been planted. This year, we will write to those who had responded to us earlier. Our aim is to ensure survival of at least 85 per cent of the saplings that will be distributed by us during monsoon.

Soumya Ghosh: What are your plans in arresting the depletion of city greenery?

 The forest department will plant 100,000 trees this year under its Kolkata Green Action Plan. The survival of the trees will be ensured with help from administration. Planting such a huge number of trees is not an easy task. So we have approached both the government and private organisations for help. CMDA has assured us that it will take the responsibility of planting 15,000 saplings.

 We are talking to some schools where the students will help us plant saplings. We have also approached the authorities of various hospitals and will soon start a plantation programme at National Medical College and Hospital. The work on the project will start in monsoon.

Amit Roychowdhury: There are large lakes inside Banabitan and Eden Gardens. Can ordinary people go for fishing there?

 Visitors can practise angling at Banabitan and Eden Gardens for a nominal fee. Between August 1 and January 31, we organise various events in the lakes, in which thousands of anglers participate. The events generate an annual revenue of about Rs 4 lakh and is one of the major sources of income of our department.

Lalit Singh Nahar: The forest department has regulations regarding planting trees and creepers. Since the regulations are not binding on agencies that maintain greenery in the city, we often see trees planted in inappropriate locations. Why don?t you monitor the planting of trees?

 The civic bodies and agencies like the public works department and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority own several plots of land and they plant trees there according to their own programme. 

 We can?t force them to follow our regulations. We can only offer consultancy. For example, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation recently sought our advice regarding planting of trees. 

 We generally try to plant trees that have a great deal of foliage as it helps purify the polluted city air. However, we also plant trees like neem. Unfortunately, its branches are snipped off once it grows. People need to come forward and help us in our endeavour to increase the greenery in the city. 

Soumya Ghosh: Nowadays, we hear a lot about plantation of medicinal plants and shrubs, which are also economically viable. Does your department have any plans on this score? 

 The Agri-Horticultural Society has started such a venture. We are also planning one such project at Banabitan. In fact, we have already started preparing the soil. Once the project is underway, we will be able to sell the medicinal plants to businesses. We will check the papers of those who approach us to ensure that the plants are properly utilised.

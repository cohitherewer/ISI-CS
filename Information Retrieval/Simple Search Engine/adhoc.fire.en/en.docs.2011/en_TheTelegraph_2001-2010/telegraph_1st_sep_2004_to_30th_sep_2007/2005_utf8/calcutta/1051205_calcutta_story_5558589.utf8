 Brittle truth about bones

 - Survey figures dismal, lifestyle and junk food blamed

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The first-ever mass survey to determine the bone strength of Calcuttans has thrown up dismal figures. 

 Fifty-five per cent of the women and 45 per cent of the men in the city have brittle bones, thanks to sedentary lifestyles and a yen for junk food.

 Following feedback from the doctors that most Calcuttans over 35 are showing symptoms of osteoporosis, the Arthritis Foundation of India undertook the survey, with the help of Britannia New Zealand Foods. 

 Teams from the foundation set up camps in several busy areas of the city from November 12 to December 3. People in the 35-plus age group were requested to undergo an osteoporosis risk test, followed by a bone scan.

 A T score was obtained, indicating whether the individual was normal, osteopenic (with a tendency to develop osteoporosis) or osteoporotic (afflicted by osteoporosis). The bone density report was then referred to a doctor, who answered queries on bone health.

 ?The survey confirmed our worst fears. We knew that most residents of Calcutta do not take care of their health. They lead sedentary lives, to disastrous effect,? said orthopaedic surgeon Gautam Saha, who took part in the programme.

 While conducting the tests on over 3,000 people, the doctors found out that most Calcuttans were unaware of osteoporosis and its dangers. The survey further revealed that almost 90 per cent of the osteopenic population did not exercise or even go for walks.

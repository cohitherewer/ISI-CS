 Turning the screws on private schools

 First, the invitation to share details of earnings and expenditure.

 Second, a quiet cross-check of the details, to be furnished in writing in reply to specific questions.

 Third, a public outing of the ?liar? if the details are either suppressed, falsified or varnished or if the answers to queries are not sent within the allotted time.

 A 12-member government committee follows this procedure to ?compel? 350-odd private English medium ICSE-CBSE schools to provide correct data about their performance. The panel, set up by the state government, will suggest guidelines to the government to regulate the functioning of ICSE-CBSE institutions.

 Step III is to be the most vital part of the exercise, given that the government had set up the committee following complaints from a cross-section of guardians that many ICSE and CBSE schools are providing poor facilities against exorbitant fees. ?Every private school, whether reputed or not, must maintain transparency in respect of its earnings and expenditure,? said Bhabesh Moitra, a senior Left academician and a member of the committee. ?The government must have a clear idea on how they are functioning,? added Moitra, who plays a significant role in framing all major education policies of the CPM.

 The information sought from the schools, however, is mostly on rates of fees charged from students and the pay scales and other financial benefits provided to teaching and non-teaching employees. 

 ?Step I is over. Step II, preparation of the questionnaire containing the queries which the schools need to answer is almost over. Our recommendations on the guidelines, which we are supposed to pass on to the government, will depend on how the schools react to the questions,? Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, commissioner, school education department, and chairman of the 12-member committee, said. Every school will be given a deadline by which it will have to send the answers to the queries.

 Sources close to the committee said the strategy ? publicly naming the defaulter schools ? is primarily intended to pressure the institutions to meet the deadline. 

 ?We neither have adequate manpower nor the mechanism to visit the schools separately to collect data. They themselves must send the data to us. We want to ensure it is correct and does not overshoot the deadline,? a government officer said.

 Meeting the deadline is important because the government has a target to complete the process of framing the final policy on private English medium schools within six months from the time the panel begins to function. The committee started work last month. 

 Once the committee receives the information, it will start the process of examining every detail supplied by the schools. If the committee suspects an irregularity, it will then organise surprise visits at random to the schools concerned and compare the facilities actually available with the information supplied.

 ?The schools must understand that our exercise is not aimed at causing unnecessary harassment. We expect them to cooperate with the government so that we can get a clear picture about their functioning,? said Biswas.

 All private English-medium schools offering ICSE and CBSE courses are included in the exercise even if they do not accept government aid. Sixty-seven missionary schools avail of government assistance.

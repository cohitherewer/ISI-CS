The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

The hand that donateth

Guest Column 

Victor Banerjee

In tsunami, the world has found a celebrity disaster 

that allows it to make all the right charitable noises

 Forgotten: (From top) May 2004: protesters 

chant anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans in Istanbul; January 2001: earthquake victims 

reach for food near Bhuj; January 2002: detainees guarded at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 

during in-processing to the detention facility

A few years ago, I learned of something I had never 

heard of before: El Ni?o. Sure, it had affected our lives but, unfortunately, 

not devastatingly enough for some of the wise to understand what the Kyoto Protocol?s 

pledge meant for our planet. In Rio a few years later, Kyoto was shelved once 

again, while the wise felled millions of trees in the rainforests of Brazil and 

dumped nuclear waste in an African continent whose inconsequential people would 

starve if they didn?t allow the wise ones? garbage in. Then I learned another 

new word: al Qaida.

It didn?t effect a climate change and nor did it send 

ocean currents spinning into whirlpools. Instead, it played out a Japanese Nintendo 

game wherein enemy aeroplanes veered off course, startled somnambulant fighter 

squadrons unused to scrambling and prone to chewing sugar-free gum, and slammed 

into two towers called Hiroshima and Nagasaki (or so I, while toasting the Maharajkumari 

of Burdwan on her birthday, in my ignorance of world politics and geography, stupidly 

thought) and killed thousands of innocent people. The wise who had ignored the 

rays of knowledge that had descended upon them from heaven, through a hole in 

the ozone layer they had created and enlarged everyday, now reacted, with all 

their might, to destroy the poppy fields of Afghanistan.

Apparently the Lord, who inhabited barn houses in 

the grain fields of the wise and inspired bushels of hope in the lives of innocent 

(or rather, awesomely ignorant) farmers, had identified an axis of evil and his 

?chosen? soldiers were self-appointed to annihilate it, so good might triumph 

over evil. In Sodom and Gomorrah, the biblical Lord of the scriptures had asked 

his agent to tell the innocent to leave before He struck with fire and brimstone 

but, this time, the Lord?s army confronted an enemy that it had trained, armed 

and played chemical and biological tiddlywinks with and a people they had crippled 

with economic sanctions: therefore, in their crusade to rid the world of satanic 

demons of mass destruction, they were left with no choice but to kill innocent 

children and women along with a gallery of faces they printed on playing cards 

in their simplistic attempt to be simple farmers reaping a harvest in a unilaterally 

sponsored tournament of coalitionised stud poker in alien killing fields. 

Years ago, when I was a suckling at the breast of 

international recognition, at a banquet in Los Angeles, in aid of the famine in 

Ethiopia, the cover charge was $1,500 per person. As the ?nobility? of the tinsel, 

celluloid, media and entertainment world pulled damask napkins over their Rodeo 

Drive sartorial extravagances, they stared down at silver that augured salads 

in a million island dressings, Fois Gras from geese in gay Paris and Game P?t? 

cooked in Cognac. And how fashionable it still is, in some parts, to have black 

waiters balance a tray over one shoulder, grin white like Satchmores sans trumpets 

of glory and, swaying to the music, serve. They did, that night.

The 30-piece string orchestra played Strauss? Blue 

Danube while the glitterati waltzed back to their tables to ponder on the 

tiny gilded spoon that was placed for them to perhaps explore the gulls? eggs 

or cockles or mussels gathered by overlooked illegal Chinese migrant labourers 

(many of whom die fighting the waves on rocks) along the coasts of England, a 

nation bending over backwards and straining its spine to please the new masters 

of the universe.

One by one, on each plate was heaped one spoon of 

rice. You were asked to eat it with that special spoon. For $1,500, that is all 

that was served that night. The opening bars of another Strauss? Thus Spake 

Zarathustra, drove home the point that a spoonful of rice was all the people 

of Ethiopia got to eat, per person, per day. 

Geldoff was knighted (as he richly deserved) to the 

horror of the British aristocracy and today, Great Britain?s generous government 

has donated ?50 million for that Sumatran quake while over the past year, wagging 

their tails in the face of millions who took to the streets in protest, they spent 

nearly ?6 billion to clean up the deserts of Iraq that were an esoteric group?s 

idea of a threat to humanity.

On Boxing Day this year, I was in the foothills of 

Darjeeling when I received a call at 0930 from a local grower of mueslex that 

his other farm in the Andaman?s was reporting a terrible earthquake. Later, I 

spent a leisurely morning with him walking through hectares of jackfruit, vanilla, 

sweet lime, tea seed trees and hybrid pumpkin fields and, of course, acres of 

mueslex for the new generation of discerning breakfasters who would, in my opinion, 

benefit far more from the Ethiopian diet. The next morning, in the daak 

edition of a newspaper from Calcutta, I learnt a new word. Tsunami.

By the time the new year crept up on us, I was astonished 

at the calculated grief expressed by the media, politicians and of course the 

United States who had dispatched a retiring Powell, with an opportunistic Governor 

Bush, to investigate how much they could eat into their deficit to appear properly 

concerned. Back in Phuket on New Year?s Eve, the flesh trade had bounced back 

for the brave libido of Western hunters and gatherers and new orphans were being 

exported from Southeast Asia to genuinely sympathetic homes in Europe and America. 

The Indonesian army in Sumatra was using the wave to quell the insurgents that 

had plagued them and we in India were pondering the geographical significance 

of Indira Point that had allegedly been lost forever.

But the world had finally found a celebrity disaster 

that it could use to show how deeply we felt for mankind. The plunder of hundreds 

of thousands of innocent lives in Rwanda, Sudan, Palestine and West Asia; the 

neglect, deprivation and humiliation of millions of starving tribal peoples in 

India; the hapless disaster victims in Latur, Uttarkashi, Bhuj; and the sacrilegious 

inhumanities perpetrated on Guantanamo Bay detainees, all paled into insignificance: 

and the world?s acutely immune but proficient syndrome, even our homespun glitterati?s, 

found an alternative to AIDS to win social accolades with. Meanwhile, to the relief 

of us all, Justice Banerjee declared that, in another paranormal example of spontaneous 

combustion, almost 60 people committed suicide within a train bogie in Gujarat 

and not a single man, woman or child decided to use any one of the four exits 

available to get out but, instead, locked themselves in to perish and find salvation 

in the inferno of a Ram-derived euphoria.

In Calcutta, on the heels of a tsunami catastrophe, 

I received an SMS, in Mirik, inviting me to a New Year?s Eve bash where all the 

Page 3 celebrities and a smattering of intelligentsia were gathering for a dinner 

and dance in a bhoomi dedicated to our traditional diversities: how apt, 

thought I. And around the corner from where I was, one newspaper reported that 

a leader held a small feast for his disciples and followers where loaves and fish 

were miraculously replaced by 250 kilograms of chicken, 350 kilograms of mutton, 

two buffalos, 5,000 kilograms of rice and 7,500 kilograms of vegetables. Is it 

honestly atypical of us that one hand should donateth while the other simply consumeth 

unashamedly?

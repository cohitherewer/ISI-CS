 SC paves way for Victoria entry fee 

 R.VENKATARAMAN IN NEW DELHI

 The entry fee is here to stay at the Victoria Memorial Hall.

 The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a petition challenging the Calcutta High Court order on entry fees and removing the final hurdle to its imposition at the Memorial.

 A division bench of Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice P.P. Naolekar observed that it would not interfere with the high court order upholding the Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti?s plea, that an entry fee be charged from visitors to help preserve the historic monument.

 The petitioner, Memorial curator Chittaranjan Panda, argued that the fee fixed by the high court, Rs 4, was not enough to cover the cost of preserving the monument from environmental degradation. He pleaded for an enhancement of the entry fee.

 The bench granted Panda leave to move ?an appropriate application? before the high court, but ruled that he must first start the ?operation? of implementing the fee.

 Samiti general secretary Subhas Dutta, present during the hearing, hailed Monday?s order as a ?victory? for the ?people?s movement? to preserve the Memorial.

 Dutta had moved Calcutta High Court last year with a plea that the Memorial must be saved from visitors who were littering the place and even using the premises and its surrounding areas as an ?open-air toilet?.

 Acting on the petition, a division bench of the high court, comprising Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutt, had appointed an expert committee to study the problems and suggest remedial measures.

 One of the suggestions from the committee was the imposition of an entry fee on visitors. The court accepted the proposal and pegged the fee at Rs 4. 

 This was to have been collected from September 1, 2004. But as the case was still pending, the deadline had been extended to February 1, 2005. Even that fell through as the curator moved the apex court.

 The state government has been opposed to the introduction of an entry fee at the Victoria Memorial. This had been spelt out by government pleader Rabilal Moitra while appearing for the state before the high court.

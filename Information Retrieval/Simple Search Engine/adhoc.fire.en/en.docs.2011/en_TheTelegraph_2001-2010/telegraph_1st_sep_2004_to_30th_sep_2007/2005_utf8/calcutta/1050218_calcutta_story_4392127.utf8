 Red faces amp; track repairs 

 OUR BUREAU

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Thursday admitted that tramlines in the city were in need of urgent repairs. 

 At a meeting at Writers? Buildings, senior ministers discussed at length the issue of repairing ravaged roads with worn-out tracks. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and their departmental secretaries discussed how to deal with the repeated embarrassment of being pulled up by Calcutta High Court for neglecting the city?s peril pathways. 

 After the meeting, Dasgupta said: ?We had felt the need for immediate repairs of tramlines for some time and funds had been allotted. A meeting was held today and the advocate-general will submit a report to the court. The government will initiate measures in keeping with this report.? 

 The finance minister, however, did not disclose what these steps were, or whether the government would ask for some time from the court to execute these measures. 

 ?I would like to tell you what the report contains. But the high court will be angry about it,? Dasgupta maintained, adding that he would rather tell the high court first about its contents. 

 Rajdeo Goala, chairman of the Calcutta Tramways Company, who was present at the meeting, said: ?The discussion today remained largely inconclusive. We, however, agreed that tracks need to be repaired. The finance department is yet to make a commitment. Another meeting will be called shortly so some concrete decision can be made.?

 For others who attended the meeting, mum was the word.

 A public interest litigation was filed in the high court demanding the court?s intervention in the neglect of roads. 

 The high court had asked various agencies dealing with the issue, like the Calcutta Tramways Company, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the Public Works Department, to submit status reports. 

 The civic body has said in its report that many roads cannot be repaired as tram tracks have damaged them already.

 The Calcutta chromosomes

 Eye on Calcutta 

 Renu Roy

 A creative artist concerned about 

 roots and identity cannot escape the frame of reference that 

 the city continues to be

 It cannot be entirely an accident 

 that two of our greatest living writers of the English language 

 were born in this city. Amitav Ghosh in 1956, and Amit Chaudhuri 

 in 1962. The dates are important because they clearly indicate 

 that the cultural context I am referring to is firmly post-colonial, 

 yet probably it does refer to the Raj, in a deeper and more 

 significant way. 

 Calcutta was, after all, the first 

 city to be built from scratch by the British outside Britain. 

 It also hosted their first university overseas, their first 

 medical college, and even their first civilian engineering 

 college, that is outside the army. That the English language, 

 and its literature, has a history of connections with our 

 city is only natural, and historically inevitable. 

 How else do you encounter the 

 plaque on Free School Street that tells you that William 

 Makepeace Thackeray lived here once? How else do you account 

 for the fact that our Park Street cemetery bears an epitaph 

 written by the English poet Walter Savage Landor, in memory 

 of the woman he loved? Rose Aylmer belongs as much to Calcutta 

 as to English poetry. However much you may wish to shake 

 them off, the ghosts of the Raj continue to haunt us to 

 degree that we have almost got used to it. some of us, I 

 know, would feel downright neglected and lonely without 

 those colonial visitations. 

 Our city has certainly shared 

 more than its fair share of glory and greatness through 

 its literary citizens, so much so that the history of Bengali 

 literature cannot be written without Calcutta in view. But 

 the English language too has a rightful claim to its own 

 piece of turf on the east bank of the Hooghly. This becomes 

 all the more apparent when we remember that the first great 

 Bangla poet to emerge in our city wrote first in English. 

 If any one had changed the course of the history of Bengali 

 literature it was Michael Madhusudhan Dutt, especially in 

 his monumental and modern rewriting of the Ramayana 

 narrative from the point of view of Ravana.

 It is interesting to remember 

 that Michael?s first published poetical work was in English. 

 Entitled The Captive Lady it told the romantic Rajput 

 tale of the love and valour of Pritviraj Chauhan. Michael?s 

 departure from the English language and his return to his 

 mother tongue has of course, achieved the status of one 

 of the great legends of cultural nationalism, but the poet?s 

 original choice cannot be forgotten. It certainly indicates 

 how deeply English had been part of our city and its culture. 

 Michael was not an exception. 

 The other Dattas must also be remembered. The Datta sisters 

 ? Aru and Toru ? also wrote verse in English and won accolades 

 from discerning readers even in the England of their days. 

 In their painfully short lives, truncated cruelly by death, 

 they left behind an immense possibility for Indian writers 

 of English verse. And all this was at a time when the literati 

 refused to accept English as an Indian language. Its acceptance, 

 in fact, has come much after Independence, when colonialism 

 has long ceased to cast its shadow on our cultural context. 

 Unfortunately, verse in English 

 never won kudos for Calcutta after the 19th century. Despite 

 the countless volumes published by the Writer?s Workshop, 

 and the painstaking efforts of P Lal, Calcutta has not been 

 able to produce a poet of the stature of a Nissim Ezekiel 

 or even a Dom Moraes. 

 But prose it has continued to 

 produce in plenty. One may challenge the Calcuttan-ness 

 of an Amitav Ghosh or Amit Chaudhuri, who were born here, 

 or Jhumpa Lahiri, who returned to her parental roots to 

 be married here, or even an Upamanyu Chatterjee, but the 

 fact is that if you are a Bengali, either first generation 

 or second, culturally you will always have an umbilical 

 connection to Calcutta. It is not for nothing that Amit 

 Chaudhuri returned to come and live here. There is something 

 about roots. And sometimes it is so deep, and so complex 

 that it is difficult to explain rationally. The Calcutta 

 chromosomes survive in devious ways. A very patriotic Bengali 

 friend of mine put it rather ironically, when he said that 

 the best Bangla novel this year has been written in English. 

 He was referring to Amitav Ghosh?s latest book ? The 

 Hungry Tide. 

 The English language chromosomes 

 seem to have survived through a significantly long period 

 of time, from their first appearance in the 19th century 

 right into the 21st. It might seem a little dated now, but 

 the novels of Bhabani Bhattacharya in mid-20th century had 

 their own quaintness and subtle impact that may have lost 

 its edge today, but certainly not their validity, as a statement 

 of the times in which they came to be written. I am sure 

 that I am leaving out many names, perhaps too many, of writers 

 in the English language who have been linked to our city 

 and have made their contribution. But I am neither a historian, 

 nor a critic, but a lover of both literature and our city.

 Again and again, the spirit of 

 our city surfaces in the most unexpected and startling ways, 

 especially in literature. How else do you explain the emergence 

 in Calcutta of the semi-successful writer Jayojit, the protagonist 

 of Amit Chaudhuri?s A New World, who returns from 

 the American Mid-West with a broken marriage and a young 

 son in tow, to revel in the ?tranquility of watery lentil 

 daal in a chinaware bowl and paabda fish in 

 mustard?. How else do you account for the beginning of Jhumpa 

 Lahiri?s The Namesake, where a pregnant and perpetually 

 hungry, Bengali woman desperately tries to rustle up some 

 jhaal muri in her New York apartment? And if jhaal 

 muri isn?t all about Calcutta, what else is? 

 Whether you are a second generation 

 Non-Resident Bengali like Jhumpa Lahiri, or brought up in 

 Mumbai like Amit Chaudhuri, if you are a creative artist 

 who is concerned about roots and identity, it is impossible 

 that you will be able to escape the frame of reference that 

 Calcutta continues to provide to all those who are historically 

 linked to it. This certainly is not only about being a Bengali, 

 because the same predilections seem to haunt the visual 

 imagery of a Wasim Kapur, or the Hindi writing of a Mannu 

 Bhandari or Alka Saraogi. 

 The acceptance of English as an 

 Indian language; the recognition of its Indian practitioners 

 throughout the English-speaking world; and the resonances 

 of this body of writing with what I choose to call The Calcutta 

 Experience; all are post-colonial and post-Partition. 

 We are therefore confronted here 

 not with a nostalgic connection between the city and the 

 English language spawned by the Raj, but with a comparatively 

 new experience translating itself through new artistic expression. 

 We are being presented here with a wider, larger vista than 

 contemporary Bangla literature, which is still caught up 

 in its own middle-class vortex, but which is inextricably 

 entangled with our city. The Calcutta Chromosomes seem to 

 be growing everyday, in unpredictable directions, and one 

 feels confident that evolution will see its emergence into 

 a considerable cultural context, to which we will all be 

 proud to belong.

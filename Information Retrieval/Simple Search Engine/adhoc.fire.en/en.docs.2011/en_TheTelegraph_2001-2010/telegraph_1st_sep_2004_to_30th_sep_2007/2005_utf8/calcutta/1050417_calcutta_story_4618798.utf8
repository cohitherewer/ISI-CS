The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Radio vs television

 To score over the small screen, the 

 audio box must reinvent itself and not be just another telly 

 clone

 The 

 stag party quickly got into full swing. Boisterous laughs, 

 lewd jokes and unabashed leg pulling filled the air ? the 

 hallmark of an enjoyable stag party. This is when someone 

 picked on me. As luck would have it my glass was empty. 

 I was actually feeling lazy and wanted the next guy to fill 

 it up for me. My wait was for a suitable prey. 

 Avinash walked across the room 

 and said: ?Wife is not here and your glass is still empty.? 

 He is one of those happy-go-lucky characters who introduced 

 us to Ursula Andress in school. He sat next to me and said: 

 ?Miya biwi ka rishta, radio jaisa hona chahiye. TV jaisa 

 nahin.? 

 It took me a while to comprehend 

 the full import of the statement. No, I was not thinking 

 so much about the prescription for marital bliss. I was 

 fascinated by the characterisation of the two media ? radio 

 and TV.

 Radio is far weaker than television 

 as a source of infotainment. Yet because of this very weakness, 

 it is blessed with a distinct character. Radio is a passive 

 medium; it does not demand undivided attention from its 

 audience. The intimacy is as much. Still, unlike TV, it 

 does not expect exclusivity.

 FM channels, the new metropolitan 

 entertainers, have possibly stripped the medium of this 

 unobtrusive nature. One cannot really say that they have 

 erred in their judgment. Their focus is on the younger audiences. 

 For this group, passivity may be boring. They would want 

 the phone-in, the chat with John Abraham or listen to the 

 favourite songs of Lara Dutta. In their altar, the behind-the-scenes, 

 quiet entertainer has to subjugate.

 The question really is whether 

 the youth-only business model is the best one. Why bother 

 about other target groups? A radio channel depends solely 

 on advertising revenue. Apart from the youth products they 

 also want a share of this detergent campaign and a bite 

 into that automobile major?s ad budget. One therefore needs 

 to entertain the mother while she is cooking. Or the tired 

 father when he gets back home. Being an audio MTV may not 

 be the complete answer.

 It is not that the FM channels 

 are not aware of this. They play different genres of music 

 at different times of the day. Unfortunately the rest of 

 the programme does not alter significantly. The radio jockeys 

 remain the same and thus behave the same way irrespective 

 of the kind of music that is being played.

 The West handles it differently. 

 A channel called Classic FM in the UK only plays music that 

 befits its name. The anchor person meshes with the music 

 genre ? in language, in tone and most importantly in mood. 

 In short, she holds the ?Do not disturb? sign aloft.

 There is another reason for widening 

 the vision of the radio medium. TV had come and hogged a 

 substantial portion of the ad pie. Their strength lies in 

 their reach. Yet, today, TV to many is like ?water water 

 everywhere, not a drop to drink?. 

 Much of TV viewership today may 

 be up for grabs, even in prime time. A well-produced radio 

 play could draw quality audience away from the K-series 

 in the evening. Perhaps the ailment of the FM channels in 

 India is TV phobia. They may need to be reminded of a great 

 wisdom. If you follow someone?s footsteps, you can never 

 overtake him.

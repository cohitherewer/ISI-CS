Rocker with a world cause

Bono the man beyond the mesmerising beats

Every age has its massive moral blind spots. We 

might not see them, but our children will.

That?s Bono, receiving his honorary doctorate of laws 

at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Paul Hewson ? the father of four ? isn?t taking any 

chances. The angst of the Boy may have mellowed, but the U2 frontman is 

becoming omnipresent when it comes to saving the world.

In the same speech, the Dubliner spoke of a month 

he spent in Africa with his (one and only) wife Alison, where an impoverished 

man begged him to take his son, to give him food, education and a chance at life. 

?? At that moment I became the worst scourge on God?s green earth, a rock star 

with a cause. Christ! Except it isn?t the cause. Seven thousand Africans dying 

every day of a preventable, treatable disease like AIDS? That?s not a cause, that?s 

an emergency.?

Angst for the sake of angst was never Bono?s style, 

and neither is protest merely for effect. In fact, when the Bono-the-saviour image 

threatened to get the better of the band in the 90s, Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen 

Junior and Adam Clayton went into artistic hibernation. They came back with Achtung 

Baby, where the fire of the cause was cushioned by some of the most complex 

lyrics (seemingly of love, but hours can be spent peeling away the layers), Bono 

has ever written.

Even now, U2 may sell music with a conscience, but 

its lead singer?s campaign is, for the most part, independently conducted.

Bono has proved that he is always good with the mike 

? whether he picks it up to sing or deliver dry facts and cold figures about hunger, 

poverty and death. His dedication to humanitarian issues and, more importantly, 

his knowledge about them, have made world leaders sit up, pay attention and often 

act.

In recognition, tributes have poured in almost as 

fast as the Grammys. Days before U2 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 

Fame, Bono?s name was up for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize and the position of World 

Bank president.

If the people who matter tend to take Bono?s campaigning 

seriously, it is with good reason. He sits pretty like the best of them at high-profile 

events like the World Economic Forum. But he also stands by his cause when the 

company is far less fashionable. He holds private talks with George W. Bush and 

sings at the Democratic National Convention. He hangs out with US treasury secretary 

Paul ?Neill ? with whom he toured Africa to highlight the need for development 

of the poorest continent ? and addresses the British Labour Party convention.

He speaks of ?extraordinary? events like We Are The 

World and Live Aid. He still takes part in them too (think tsunami). ?But 20 years 

on I?m not that interested in charity,? he clarifies. ?I?m interested in justice. 

There?s a difference. Africa needs justice as much as it needs charity.?

Spirituality may be a big part of what makes Bono?s 

song-writing so powerfully poetic, but it doesn?t interfere in the clinical approach 

to what he has set out to do. His main agenda is to convince the world?s richest 

nations that cancelling debt of the poorest countries is in everybody?s best interest. 

That to withhold generic AIDS medication from millions of dying Africans is reprehensible. 

That hunger in a world of waste is unjustifiable. His organisation DATA (Debts 

Aids Trade Africa) campaigns for just that. 

Sometimes, just sometimes, Bono opts for feel-good 

Santa missions. Like in 2002, when he took part in Operation Christmas Child, 

where hundreds of thousands of Christmas presents were sent to Africa.

Three decades and counting as ?keepers of some of 

the most beautiful sonic architecture in the rock-and-roll world? (as Bruce Springsteen 

called them in his tribute during the induction to the Hall of Fame), might ensure 

that U2 is remembered mainly for its music. Fans, surely, will have no argument 

with this. But when it comes to Bono, the world will also remember a man who tried 

to shine some light on this generation?s blind spots of choice.

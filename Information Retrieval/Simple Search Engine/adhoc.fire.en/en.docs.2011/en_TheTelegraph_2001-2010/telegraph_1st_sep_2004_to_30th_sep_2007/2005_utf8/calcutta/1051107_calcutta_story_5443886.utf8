 This winter, the new fair grounds off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass will host one of the city?s most popular draws ? the West Bengal Handicrafts Expo.

 The fair, to be held in February 2006, might also be the first one at the new location, opposite Science City. According to an official, the state commerce and industry department has so far received only one formal application seeking permission to organise a fair on the Bypass. Though some activity was noticed at the site on Sunday, senior officials, including the police, were unable to confirm what the preparations were for.

 ?We have already received clearances for holding the handicrafts expo on the new fair grounds in February,? Satyabrata Chakraborty, director of cottage and small-scale industries, said on Sunday. Officials said apart from some issues on the rent, most other matters relating to the crafts fair have been sorted out.

The Expo is held every year since 1984.

 Number of artisans: 1,800 to 2,000 (from all the districts of Bengal).

 Sale: Between Rs 7 to 8 crore every year 

 Held last year at: Brigade Parade Ground. 

 Years before that: Ground adjacent to Victoria Memorial.

 Crowd-pull: Three to four lakh every year.

 The foundation stone was laid at the Bypass fair complex in February 2004. While a crafts village was to take up over one-third of the 17.5-acre plot, the rest of the area was to be developed especially for hosting fairs. An average of 30 fairs are held in the city, spread over 140 days of every calendar year. They draw about 46 lakh visitors.

 However, a section of government officials and fair organisers feared that poor connectivity would prove a bane of the fairs at the new venue. It was also felt that the crowds would throw traffic out of gear on the Bypass.

 But now, at least some organisers are enthused about the new fair grounds, with the government chalking out plans for improving transport along the stretch. ?The footfall at Science City on a weekend is not discouraging at all. We believe that the handicrafts expo has the potential to draw a huge crowd even at a changed venue,? Chakraborty said.

 Nevertheless, the organisers of the Book Fair will decide on the venue only by the second week of November. ?We have applied to the police and the army, but have not received a response yet. We are not keen about the new venue, as the space there is almost a third of that on the Maidan,? said Kalyan Shah of Publishers and Booksellers Guild.

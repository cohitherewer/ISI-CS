 City Lights

 Tech flourish to festival

 Whether you live abroad and miss the action back home or live in the city but can?t muster up the courage to make your way through the madness, there?s plenty happening on the computer, television and mobile screens to keep you busy and in sync with the celebrations. Here are the tech picks on the festive days.

 For non-resident Bengalis, it was the virtual place to be for a flavour of the festivities back home last year. This year looks to be no different.

 Images and video clips from pandals across the city, recipes from the best eateries in town, games (beat up Mahishasur!) and comic strips, the history of Durga puja, e-cards? there?s something for every nostalgic one. Those living abroad can also upload images of their local Puja to the website.

 On the lighter side, the highlight is Mahishasur Pala 2 (picture above), the sequel to last year?s hit animation film. If, in Part One, the much-maligned Mahishasur got a chance to present his side of the story, now the battered beast is badgered into outsourcing the fight, by Narad. What follows is a hilarious twist in the tale tackling mythology and global issues. Dhak, an award-winning animation film from National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, is also on display.

 STAR Ananda

 Pujo Dekhun STAR Anande is the tagline for the number one Bengali news channel?s festive coverage. And there?s lots of fun in store.

 Star Pujo is a contest to crown one Puja from Calcutta, Howrah and Salt Lake. The audience is also a part of the judging process, sending in SMSs to vote their choice. The winning pujas will be awarded titles of Blockbuster Pujo, Megastar Pujo, Superstar Pujo and Star Pujo according to their popularity.

 Around 200 shortlisted pujas from the entries have already been showcased since September 11 and the winners will be announced on October 10.

 Ananda Safar is a travelogue that looks at the Puja celebrated across Bengal. The programme has been on air since September 28. One of the anchors began his journey from Darjeeling and will end in Baruipur; the other started from the Sunderbans and will end in Hooghly. 

 The programme tries to capture the unique characteristics and heritage of the places it visits, embellished with the history and culture of the area.

 Bonedi Barir Pujo and Flat Barir Pujo are the other highlights. The former showcases traditional pujas from the channel?s Pujo Hall of Fame, while the latter features private pujas in residential complexes. Capsules like Pujor Khawa, Pujor Fashion, Pujor Berano, Pujor Lekha and Pujor Kena Kata spice things up further.

 Hey Ya!

 Over 400 pandals from Calcutta, Dinajpur, Durgapur, Raniganj, Burdwan, Cuttack and Assam have registered for Mobiley Pujo Niye Asche Hyundai Colour TV. 

 Stop at any of these during pandal-hopping and if you want the idol?s image on your phone, simply SMS to 8243 with the code of the pandal (which is displayed on the premises). The organisers get a chance to win great prizes as well, if their Puja wallpaper is downloaded the most.

 Picture messages, logos, wallpapers, ring tones and other goodies are up for grabs. Special wallpapers and ring tones will be on offer to celebrate the October birthdays of Amitabh Bachchan, Rekha, Hema Malini and Sunny Deol.

 The personal touch

 I like to think of myself as a cosmopolitan person, but the sense of belonging I find in India and Pakistan, I find nowhere else. Here, I am at ease,? smiled writer Bapsi Sidhwa, settling into a seat at The Oxford Cha bar. In Calcutta for the first time, Bapsi was thrilled to be in the ?land of her dreams, the land of Tagore and more recently Amitav Ghosh and Amit Chaudhuri?.

 She was struck by the beauty of Bengali women and the amazing variety of names. ?Bapsi, you see, means nothing. My grandmother wanted to give me an English name, now all my friends laugh at me,? she confided.

 But the name Bapsi has certainly made its place in literary circles, thanks to her novels like The Crow Eaters, The Pakistani Bride, The Ice-Candy-Man and The American Brat. Her latest is an editorial assignment, The City of Sin and Splendour, an anthology of writings on Lahore. Part of Penguin?s ongoing effort to encapsulate the spirit of various Indian cities.

 The City? presents Lahore, remembered by people with a long and intimate relationship with the city. It is a rich spread of essays, stories, poetry, chronicles and profiles. Everything from Lahore?s Hira Mandi, the legend of Anarkali, the effects of Partition and traditional cuisine get touched upon.

 The anthology also includes excerpts from Bapsi?s Crow Eaters and The Ice-Candy-Man (which was adapted into the film 1947: Earth). Born in Karachi in 1938, Bapsi came to Lahore as a three-year-old. This was where she grew up and repeatedly returned to, in between her stays at Mumbai, Karachi and Houston.

 ?It was the loneliness of childhood that propelled me to books, I couldn?t go to school because of polio and had very few friends because we were Parsis and there were so few Parsis in Lahore. So I was reading a lot, imagining myself as a Victorian Lady? but never as a writer,? said Bapsi.

 It was only on her second honeymoon to the northern lands between Pakistan and Afghanistan that she got her impetus to write. 

 ?The landscape was at once so beautiful, harsh and lonely. Then I saw this new Pakistani bride, dark skinned among all those fair complexioned tribal people? I was too naive then to realise that she must have been bought. She ran away after a few days,? said Bapsi. 

 The episode haunted Bapsi so much that she began to write secretly and soon discovered that her forte lay more in comedies than tragedies. Personal experiences strengthen Bapsi?s oeuvre. Not just childhood memories of the pre and post Partition years, but the experiences of a wife and mother, an adviser to Benazir Bhutto on women?s development and a Pakistani immigrant in America.

 ?I am too tall and too thin for Hindi films. So, I don?t really have a line-up of offers. I am choosing the best I have on my platter,? confessed 

 Dipannita Sharma with a disarming smile. She was in town to promote Koi Aap Sa, co-starring Aftab Shivdasani and Natassha, at INOX Forum. ?Probably destiny wants my career to be slow,? added the lanky model who has recently forayed into theatre. Picture by Aranya Sen

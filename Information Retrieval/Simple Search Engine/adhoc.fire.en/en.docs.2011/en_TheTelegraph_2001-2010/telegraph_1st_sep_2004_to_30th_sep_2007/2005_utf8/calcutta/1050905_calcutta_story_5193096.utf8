The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Booster dose for bridge, 62

 - Traffic load, pedestrian volume decisive factors in repairs, restoration

 SANJAY MANDAL

 How safe is the Howrah bridge?

 Months after a barge rammed into its belly, a study will be conducted to find out whether the structure, 62 years old, is capable of holding the weight of an increasing volume of traffic. The study will be undertaken by Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), custodian of the bridge.

 ?The study will measure the traffic load on the bridge and whether any measure is necessary to strengthen the structure,? A.K. Chanda, CPT chairman, told Metro on Sunday. ?We want to ensure that the traffic load is within safety limits, as set by the Indian Road Congress.?

 A traffic census will be undertaken during the study. ?The number of vehicles plying on the bridge, types of heavy, light and medium vehicles and the weight the bridge has to bear will be taken into account,? Chanda said.

 Also to be considered are the number of pedestrians using the bridge and at what time of the day and the year the load is the maximum. 

 ?The study is part of our measures to repair the bridge and provide adequate protection so that mishaps ? such as the one on June 24, when the mast of a barge got stuck in the underbelly ? do not damage the structure,? a CPT official pointed out.

 The study, he said, will be undertaken within a few months, after the ?immediate repairs? to the damage caused by the mishap is completed. Two of the six longitudinal girders, each 700 metres and running from the Calcutta end to Howrah, were damaged. A few of the 40 cross-girders were also broken and a newly-constructed trolley guide was damaged considerably. Overall repairs were carried out in 2004 and the bridge is generally in good condition, an official said.

 Rites, a Port Trust consultant since the eighties, had conducted a survey of the bridge along with CPT officials after the accident. A team from Rites conducted ultrasonography and magnetic particle tests to find out whether the ?integrity? of the girders was intact.

 ?Preliminary investigations reveal that there are no inside cracks,? a CPT official said. Rites is now preparing the detailed report, which will also suggest restoration measures. The restoration plan, based on structural analysis and the extent of damage, is expected to reach the CPT office in Calcutta by the month-end. 

 Besides the repairs, the CPT plans to take some protective measures. It is considering setting up a height gauge ? a protective layer on the belly, covering the main structure ? or a secondary structure. The secondary structure will be like a cage covering the bridge?s belly.

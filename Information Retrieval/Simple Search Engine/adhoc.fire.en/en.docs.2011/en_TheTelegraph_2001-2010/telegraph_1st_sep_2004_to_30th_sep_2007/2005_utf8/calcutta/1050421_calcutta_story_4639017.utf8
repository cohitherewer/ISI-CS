The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two crushed by speeding buses

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Reckless driving claimed two lives on Wednesday. In both cases, the victims were crushed under the wheels.

 As news of the mishaps spread, residents set up roadblocks demanding intensified vigil by traffic personnel to check rash drivers from causing deaths almost every day.

 The first mishap took place around 11.45 am at the intersection of APC Roy Road and Grey Street, in Maniktala police station area. A 32-year-old man, yet to be identified, died on the spot when a speeding minibus on the Howrah-Teghoria route knocked him down.

 ?The victim was standing on the road, waiting for a bus,? said an officer of the traffic department. ?The speeding mini hit him from behind. The man didn?t get a chance to save himself and was crushed under the front wheels,? he added.

 Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said bystanders caught the driver while he was trying to flee and handed him over. ?We have impounded the killer vehicle,? he added.

 Immediately after the incident, a mob squatted on the road, blocking traffic on both APC Roy Road and Grey Street. They demanded permanent posting of a traffic sergeant on the spot, because the intersection is one of the busiest in the city. 

 The blockade was lifted after officers from Burtolla police station intervened.

 The second mishap took place around 12.35 pm when a speeding private bus on route 240 knocked down 55-year-old Swapan Nag on Bidhan Sarani, in the Shyampukur police station area. 

 ?The victim was crossing the road and the bus, coming from Shyambazar, hit him. Witnesses confirmed that the driver lost control after overtaking another private bus. He slammed the brakes but the bus came to screeching halt only after running over the man,? said an officer of Shyampukur police station. The driver fled.

 A group of local people blocked the thoroughfare for over half-an-hour, accusing police of negligence in taking steps against reckless drivers.

 According to officers of the traffic department, a number of measures have been taken to check the number of deaths caused by rash driving. 

 ?We have organised a series of workshops and shown the killer drivers video clips of mishaps. We told them about the crimes they commit,? said an officer. ?But it is not working. There is no sign of the deaths on road decreasing.?

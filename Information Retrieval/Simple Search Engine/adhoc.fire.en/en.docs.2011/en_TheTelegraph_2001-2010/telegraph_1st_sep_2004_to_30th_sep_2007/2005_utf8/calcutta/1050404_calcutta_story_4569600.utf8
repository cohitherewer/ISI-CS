The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Calcutta boasts of quite a few popular hangouts like Victoria Memorial, Alipore 

zoo and Birla Planetarium. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) renovated 

the Town Hall and transformed it into a story-telling museum. Visitors are now 

fascinated by the undoubtedly impressive show there. But in spite of its potential, 

it is yet to be recognised as a popular attraction. The footfall is quite insignificant, 

compared to that at Millennium Park. The CMC is, thus, losing out on revenue by 

not exploiting the tourism potential of the Town Hall. It should hold events frequently 

at the hall to popularise it.

 The police and administration need to be lauded for the glitch-free arrangements 

during the Test match between India and Pakistan at Eden Gardens from March 16 

to 20. Cricket Association of Bengal officials, the ground staff at Eden and the 

police personnel deployed there took their work seriously and did well. 

 Bhupendra Nath Bose, Dum Dum Park. 

 The signboards put up by the civic body displaying the names of roads and prominent 

landmarks is very helpful. However, some of them give wrong information. A signboard 

at the Lord Sinha Road-AJC Bose Road crossing reads Rabindra Sarani, instead of 

Rabindra Sadan.

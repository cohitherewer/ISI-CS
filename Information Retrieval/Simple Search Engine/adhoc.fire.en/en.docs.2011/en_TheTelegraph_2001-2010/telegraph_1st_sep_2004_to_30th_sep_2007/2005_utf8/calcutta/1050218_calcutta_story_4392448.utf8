 Absentee pilot duo sacked

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the ATR-42 flights to and from the Northeast remaining suspended for the third day on Thursday, Alliance Air has toughened its stand against the agitating pilots. 

 The airline terminated the services of two pilots since Wednesday. Pilots Sanjay Gupta and S.S. Bindra were slapped with marching orders, an Indian Airlines (IA) spokesperson said on Thursday. 

 Though the ATR pilots were called upon to resume dialogue with the recently-constituted committee, three pilots chose to absent themselves from duty, the spokesperson said. 

 The committee is headed by deputy managing director and director (finance) Sushma Chawla, and includes deputy managing director Manet Paes, managing director Alliance Air and director personnel of Indian Airlines. It was set up to consider the pilots? demands.

 Alliance Air?s 46-seater ATR services to the Northeast have been disrupted since February 15 morning after 20 pilots reported sick. 

 The pilots have been demanding better wages. IA officials claimed that the agitating pilots had been promised redress of their legitimate complaints by the month-end.

 The IA spokesperson said connectivity within the Northeast has been ensured by positioning additional Boeing aircraft in the region and operating additional Boeing flights.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kid corps for the environment 

 SUDIP BANERJEE, chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Jayanta Sthanapati, Prabal Ganguly, Jiten Das, Sandip Banerjee, G. Laha, Sital Das, Sandip Ghanti, Ranajit Basu, Sailen Bhattacharjee and Sudhin Chatterjee

Sandip Ghanti: What are the responsibilities of the pollution control board?

 The board is responsible for planning a comprehensive programme to prevent and control pollution. It acts as an advisory body of the state government in matters related to prevention and control of pollution and pollutants. It also serves as the nodal agency to provide licence to industries adhering to environment laws. We undertake surveys to determine environmental condition and act as a regulatory body for units violating pollution norms. 

Sailen Bhattacharjee: You pass laws from time to time banning bonfires, loudspeakers and recycle of rechargeable batteries. But the laws are seldom enforced. Why?

 Enforcement of laws depend on the administration, judicial system and social consciousness. I am sorry to say that our education is not reflected in our behaviour. Laws can never be enforced unless the masses become conscious about the need to protect nature. Awareness is the key to a healthy environment. 

Sudhin Chatterjee: Why don?t you start a pollution awareness campaign among students?

 We have started a programme among students of district schools. Under the programme, the students form a group to exchange ideas related to the development of a healthy environment and set up eco-clubs. We call the groups National Green Corps (NGC). Nearly 2,850 schools across Bengal have already joined the programme. The objective is to develop a sense of responsibility towards the environment among the students. 

 To co-ordinate the implementation of the NGC programme, a State Steering Committee has been constituted. District Implementation and Monitoring Committees (DIMCs), headed by district magistrates, oversee the implementation of the programme at the district level. The DIMCs have been constituted in Calcutta, Hooghly and Purulia. Paschim Banga Vigyan Mancha, an NGO, has been implementing the programme on behalf of the board.

Sandip Banerjee: Though my car has a pollution-under-control certificate, I was fined by police. Do I need a certificate from the board.

 The board does not have the provision to issue any certificate to vehicles. Obtain a pollution clearance certificate from an authorised emission testing centre. 

Sital Das: How can I get help from the board if I spot felling of a tree or filling up of a pond?

 Complain directly to the pollution control authority in your area or the public grievance cell. Alternatively, send in a letter or register a complaint through our website. Public grievances are heard and registered in districts. In case of noise pollution, the district magistrates and the police commissioner in Calcutta are empowered to take action without assistance from the board. Keep in mind, environment laws are different in panchayat and urban areas.

G. Laha: Does the board accept complaints regarding the poor quality of municipal water?

 No, the board does not accept such complaints. Contact your councillor or borough committee member.

Ranajit Basu: Does the board take major steps against violators of the pollution laws?

 Once we find an agency guilty of violating pollution norms, we definitely take action against it. In 2004, we ordered closure of 15 industrial units, while in 2003 and 2002, we closed down 12 and 13 major industrial units, respectively, as they failed to comply to our rules.

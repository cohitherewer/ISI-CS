The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An unlikely hero

 A play that interrogates social and economic issues, the pathetic condition prevailing in Indian villages, the misuse of power by the government and the importance of self-help in an administrative setup that has all but ceased to function, Thaneer Thaneer presents a clear indictment of the powers-that-be and their absolute failure in alleviating the problems of the rural masses. It begins with Vellaisamy, a fugitive, finding refuge in Athipatti, a drought-stricken village. He sees the villagers struggling to survive amidst extreme poverty, with no water to meet even their basic, daily needs. His bold spirit and firm conviction that men can achieve what they want if they try hard enough, motivate the erstwhile disunited villagers. Instead of waiting in vain for government help, they together solve their problems, only to find that the authorities disapprove of such people-led initiatives. Written by Komal Swaminathan; designed and directed by Kunal Padhi.

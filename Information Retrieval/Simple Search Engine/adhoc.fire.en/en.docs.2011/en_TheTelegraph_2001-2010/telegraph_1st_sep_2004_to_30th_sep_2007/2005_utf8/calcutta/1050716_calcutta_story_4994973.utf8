 Chime for a church without walls

Eye on Calcutta

Barry O'Brien

 For over a century, St. Paul?s Cathedral remains as much a place high on heritage as the place for a tryst with holiness within

 I have vivid memories of Mrs Sweeny, our catechism teacher at St. Xavier?s ?small school?. We were too ?small? to differentiate between ?a pious old lady? who knew the Bible like the back of her wrinkled palm and ?a strict teacher? who knew every sin of ours even before we committed it; and since we were too ?small? to differentiate, we didn?t! We were ?small? and innocent and catechism was just another subject. 

 It was only when we ?got big? and went across, to the ?big school? on Park Street, did we realise how wrong we were: Mrs Sweeny was not just another ?strict teacher?; she was ?a pious old lady?, a woman of God. Her?s was not ?just another subject?; it was a way of life! I remember Jesus? miracles in the order that they happened and every little detail of his Crucifixion as if she had ?taught? it to us only the other day. I think, that?s because she didn?t ?teach? it; she told it like a story ? straight from the heart!

 Though I must admit that of the two most vivid memories I have of her, one was extremely embarrassing ? for my mother, that is. It was the time when Mrs Sweeny had called her to school to show her what I had written as an answer to the following question: ?Which was Jesus?s first miracle?? I?m not sure whether it was innocence or the lack of it, but this was my answer: ?He turned the water into gin!? Understandably, there was consternation and concern among the elders of this decent Christian family. How could he possibly have written something like this? What will he be like when he grows up! 

 Till this day, I don?t really know what had got into me and why I had done such a ?naughty thing?, but I suspect it had something to do with what my mother had started sipping once-in-a-while at parties and the fact that it looked like water! 

 The other vivid memory is of a serious nature ? it?s to do with how she made us understand that God was present in every human being. Even today, her soft quivering voice comforts me in times of trouble or strengthens me to stay out of it, with, ?Remember son, God is in you. He is everywhere!? 

 Dominique Lapierre too said something on those lines. He wrote, ?I have found God is everywhere in Calcutta!? He did, however, admit, ?My favourite spot is the beautifully trimmed garden surrounding the Victoria Memorial? and the magic moment when Surya, the Sun God, surges up, framing itself in the turrets of the neo-Gothic bell tower of St. Paul?s Cathedral.? 

 With Lapierre?s words fresh in my mind and Mrs Sweeny?s message tucked away safely in my heart, I found the strength to accept the great challenge of speaking in one of the places where God has always been in Calcutta ? St. Paul?s Cathedral! 

 In fact, recently, I had a double honour! The first was a couple of months ago at the commemorative service for the late Pope John Paul II. Imagine me ? a normal guy like you ? fluctuating between part-time sinning and full-time sinning ? speaking from the same pulpit as priests, bishops, swamijis and Sister Nirmala! Though I was nervous as hell, (there I go sinning again!) I managed to do a reasonable job as the only speaker at the service below the age of 60!

 In fact, it made me feel so good, that I was hoping it would happen again. ?Funny are His ways,? they say! A couple of weeks ago, it did! 

 There I was, yet again, speaking from the pulpit and wondering what I had done to deserve all this. It was the thanksgiving service of St. John?s Diocesan H.S. School on completing 111 glorious years. What made the honour even more special was the fact that more than 90 per cent of the congregation was non-Christian. Hindu and Muslim children, from St. John?s free school in Topsia, praised the Lord in Hindi; teachers and belonging to all faiths, did the same in English; the School Captain, a Hindu girl, read one of the Lessons; Srikanta Acharya said a passionate prayer with music and melody. I cannot remember all that I said, but I know I said what I wanted to. I was inspired; and moved! It?s an experience I will always cherish. Mrs Sweeney was right ? God IS in each one of us! Lapierre was right too ? God IS everywhere in Calcutta! 

 Right through the day, on any day of the week, you will see common people ? people of all faiths ? meditating or just sitting quietly in the Cathedral. Many of them drop their written requests for a special petition in the prayer box, which is opened every Friday. 

 Many of my non-Christian friends have been religiously attending the St. Paul?s Midnight Service on Christmas Eve for years. Perhaps this is why the late Rev. Subir Biswas, the Cathedral?s dynamic Vicar in the early 70s, always said: ?It is a church without walls!? Perhaps this is why these words are inscribed on its bell: ?Its sound has gone out into all lands!? 

 Designed by W.N. Forbes, this magnificent work of Gothic architecture was consecrated in 1847. Till today, it houses some extraordinary expressions of creativity. Special among them are its stained glass windows, particularly the great west window by Sir Edward Burne-Jones; the India Lamp presented by Field Marshall Montgomery during the First World War and kept in a glass case in the Memorial Chapel; and its clock ? a sister-clock to the one at Christchurch, Oxford. 

 While all this is certainly of importance and priceless in terms of heritage value, what is even more significant is the contribution that the Anglican Church has made to the city and the region. The Church of North India, over the last several decades, continues to serve the people, particularly in areas of education, women?s empowerment and health. Who can forget the role that the Cathedral Relief Service ? set up post ?71 for this specific purpose ? played in providing relief to the homeless in Bangladesh and the refugees who came across! 

 St. Paul?s continues to be a sacred Cathedral for believers and an imposing landmark of universal brotherhood and harmony for others ? character traits that will always bind the people of this incredible city together, with chords that cannot be broken!

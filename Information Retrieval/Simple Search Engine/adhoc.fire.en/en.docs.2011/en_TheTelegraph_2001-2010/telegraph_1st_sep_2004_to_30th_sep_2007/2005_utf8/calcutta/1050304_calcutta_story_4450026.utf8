 Fashion, music, dance and poetry ? different art forms blended beautifully to play out the theme ?woman of substance? on the lawns of designer Jyoti Khaitan?s d?Studio in Ballygunge on Thursday afternoon. 

 Called Amazing Grace, the event gave the select gathering a few glimpses of the designer?s spring-summer collection through a unique presentation. 

 The small audience at the rather informal affair included the likes of actor Arjun Chakraborty and wife Nilanjana, model-turned artist Piu Sarkar and artist Wasim Kapur among others.

 Actress Koneenica Banerjee, draped in saris designed by Jyoti, put up a modern dance performance along with members of the dance troupe Sapphire Creations. The dancers ? Paromita Saha, Moumita Debnath and Dibyendu along with Koneenica ? performed to the beats of percussionist Tanmoy Bose?s music and vocal invocation. 

 ?Music, fashion, poetry and dance are all various creative activities that have a very deep symbiotic relationship. These aesthetic forms complement each other beautifully,? said Bose.

 A couple of dance sequences, in which Koneenica displayed the saris to full effect, was followed by a poetry rendition by thespian Renu Roy, who also compered the programme. She recited two poems ? The Return and A Woman ? both from her own collection of English verse.

 ?While A Woman is in sync with today?s theme, The Return is a poem very dear to my heart and it is dedicated to my son. Both poems are from a collection published 25 years ago,? smiled Roy.

 The collection presented by Jyoti comprised a couple of ornate saris, which highlighted the designer?s forte. The first sari in metallic white georgette was heavily embellished with embroidery, beadwork, crystals and antique gold. Bright pink floral motifs in thread work blended with the silver shimmer of stones and beads. The second sari in bright gold used more elaborate embroidered floral motifs, primarily in shades of red, again with a sprinkle of shine and shimmer with stones and beads. 

 ?For my spring summer collection I have used beige and metallic white as the base colours for the saris. I feel this summer we will see lots of white and neutrals in fashion. But I have also combined a lot of bright colours in the surface ornamentation. The saris have been embellished with resham work, beads, crystals, stones and antique gold zari,? explained the designer.

 ?I decided to showcase the collection only to my close friends first through this event. Since the collection is very feminine, we decided to celebrate womanhood through this programme,? added Khaitan. 

 The collection will be launched publicly at a fashion show next month.

 ?The fashion extravaganza, to be held at The Park, will also be very different from the usual ramp shows. The clothes will be flaunted by a handful of good models and celebrities from various walks of life,? she revealed.

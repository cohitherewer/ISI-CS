 Hes done in months what many fashion biggies have taken years to achieve. But Shahzad Kalim is in no mood to take a break, commercial or otherwise.

 In fact, the winner of Lakme Fashion House is off to Milan for the six-month internship with Versace ? the bumper prize of the reality fashion show, along with the chance to showcase his designs at the India Fashion Week earlier this year.

 Just before Shahzad left last week for his high-profile internship with one of the biggest names in global fashion, GoodLife caught up with the 25-year-old from Patna.

 I am getting goosebumps all the time, he smiled. I have always wanted to learn fashion from an international school because in the world of fashion they do things much ahead of India. So their techniques and skills are greater than ours. I just hope everything goes well at Milan.

 Shahzad, a diploma holder from the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) from Hyderabad, still mentions on his CV the first position in an on-the-spot painting competition, organised by Patna University. But it was his 14-week stint at the Lakme Fashion House ? a talent hunt show on STAR One ? that changed his bio-data dramatically.

 It was a dream come true... The best thing was getting a shot at the India Fashion Week, the best platform for any designer in the country.

 It was more than a passing shot as Shahzads line at the Fashion Week received a standing ovation from the crowd and rave reviews from critics. 

 I got just 17-18 days to finish the entire line, for the opportunity came real quick and real easy, he recalled. 

 Ramp impact is all I was looking for. But I was really surprised at the response from buyers who found my designs very practical. There were words of encouragement from acclaimed designers. Wendell Rodricks came up to me and said that he had expected something bizarre but found my work very creative. Tarun Tahiliani applauded each outfit.

 Egged on by the response at the Fashion Week, Shahzad went for a two-day exhibition of his designs in Dubai.

 They were highly appreciated and all the 30 ensembles sold off in no time. The clients there were looking for more stuff and so I had to finish another collection of around 25 outfits before the Milan trip. All the designs were an extension of my Fashion Week creations.

 ashback over, Shahzad cant stop talking about Milan. Versace is among the most innovative and respected names in the world of fashion today. The way they drape, the making of patterns, the combinations of colours ? Im looking forward to learning a lot. In India we dont really focus on pattern-making because we use so much embroidery. I want to stay there beyond the scheduled six months and learn more if possible. When I met Donatella (Versace), she was so charming. She promised she would take care of me in Milan.

 But that doesnt make the boy from Bihar an NRB. I would definitely come back to India. I want to design clothes for Bollywood and have my own label here. All my friends are here and I love our fashion industry. Rather than being rivals, the other designers are encouraging me to keep my feet on the ground and keep doing great work.

 At the end of the day, Shahzad, whos worked with Bollywood fashion guru Manish Malhotra for a few months, wants to create clothes for a period film.

 I also want to make clothes for a fun film like say Dil Chahta Hai or maybe a Karan Johar film, where fashion plays such an important role.

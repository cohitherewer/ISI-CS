 A 22-year-old youth was killed in a bomb explosion in south Calcutta on Friday, the first death in poll-related violence this municipal election. 

 The blast occurred inside a building under construction on Panditiya Road, around 12.45 pm, where Kochi Mondal and Gopal Naskar were making bombs. 

 A resident of Paschimgram, in Joynagar, Kochi had come along with Naskar to make bombs for a local tough. 

 ?Naskar and assistant Kochi were hired to make bombs at the rate of Rs 60 each. Three bombs were found at the site. Three accomplices had fled,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department). The two were rushed to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, where Kochi succumbed to his injuries. 

 After the death, Independent candidate Debashish Kumar blocked the Sarat Bose Road-Manoharpukur Road crossing for 10 minutes, protesting the rise in ?criminal activity? in the area. 

 Poll checks

 The government on Friday announced strict measures to ensure peaceful polls all over the city. For the 2,948 booths spread across 141 wards, around 24,215 policemen, including Rapid Action Force personnel, will be deployed. In addition to over 3,000 polling personnel, 24 officers of magistrate rank will be deployed. 

 Vivek Kumar, district magistrate, South 24-Parganas, and district municipal election officer, has received 108 poll-related complaints, of which 41 were made by the Trinamul Congress, 25 by the NDA and eight by the Left Front.

 Over 5,000 people were arrested between June 6 and June 16, said Chayan Mukherjee, additional director-general (law and order). Of these, 779 were made in connection with specific cases. Police have seized 132 bombs, around 4500 litres of liquor, 43 firearms and 59 pieces of ammunition in the course of election-related raids.

 Pickets will be put up in 40 places to restrict entry of outsiders into booths, while patrolling will carried out at railway stations and on the Bypass. Two-wheelers will not be allowed within 200 m of the booths, Mukherjee said. 

 Political parties will not be allowed to set up camps within 200 m of a polling booth. Convoys of more than two cars will not be allowed on the days of polling and counting. Candidates will be allowed to use only one car.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 West plus east equals happy union

 TAPAS GHOSH AND SANJAY MANDAL 

 A 40-year-old businessman from Lancashire has come down all the way to Calcutta on a one-and-a-half month mission. Not to explore investment opportunities in resurgent Bengal, but to find a true Bengali bride.

 James B. Davies (name changed on request), who runs a roaring business in antique furniture, has registered himself for ?200 with the marriage agency Relations. 

 ?In our country, the rate of divorce is very high and women are opting to remain single,? says Davies. ?I know Bengali women are very homely and caring, so I have come here to find a match.? 

 Davies is not alone in his quest: Bengali women are increasingly winning the hearts of western men, leaving behind their Caucasian counterparts by several knots.

 ?One in three marriages in our country ends in separation or divorce. Also, the women there put their personal needs above the needs of the family,? explains Davies. 

 ?There are many like me in the UK who want to lead a peaceful conjugal life. We want children and a loyal wife who supports her husband as much as he supports her,? he adds.

 Davies had once witnessed a Bengali wedding in London and found it ?exotic and charming?. ?I, too, would love to marry in that manner. However, there will be a small ceremony in my country.? 

 According to Davies, most westerners find the traditional Indian system of arranged marriages captivating. ?In the UK, there?s no such concept. But it?s very interesting.? 

 He wants the agency to initiate discussions with the bride?s family on his behalf.

 Dutch national Jerry O?Brien, too, has decided to have Indian in-laws. Now based in Delhi, Jerry is an executive with an international airline. 

 Since last year, Relations has enrolled 16 prospective grooms from abroad. ?We have an extended clientele coming from the US, the Netherlands and other countries,? elaborates Anindyo Sanyal of Relations. 

 ?They all seek Bengali brides and have chosen some of the profiles listed with us. Some of the cases are close to finalisation,? he says.

 A few western women, too, have approached the agency, which has offices in Philadelphia (US) and Hampstead (UK), for Calcutta grooms.

 As for the response from the other side of the fence, Sanyal says: ?Forty per cent of our Bengali female clientele have sought Caucasian husbands.?

 Sanchita Chatterjee (name changed), an executive with a multinational firm, says: ?I am keen to go to the US or the UK, which has loads of employment opportunities and where life is comfortable. I do not have any reservations about marrying a westerner.? 

 Shyamasree, a teacher, feels marriage is all about mutual understanding. ?Racial, geographical or religious differences cannot affect a happy married life.?

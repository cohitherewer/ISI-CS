 An international tea brand. A global advertising agency. An Italian production crew. A Chinese storyboard. Location? Tollygunge, Calcutta!

 The city has registered a blip on the international advertising radar, thanks to a combination of geography (proximity to tea gardens), demography (a large Chinese populace) and economy (cost of the 100-plus extras plummeting dramatically, vis-?-vis Western rates).

 Steered by Kas Movie Makers, the Delhi-based production company that handles line production for foreign shoots, a full-fledged Chinatown was created near the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. All for a 15-strong Italian crew to shoot two 30-second commercials for a leading tea brand on Sunday and Monday nights, before heading off to the hills of north Bengal.

 If one of the ad films is about a Chinese tea-taster going missing with the head of the dragon on New Year day, the other one is about a Bengali bridegroom not reaching on time for the marriage, again, due to tea-tasting assignments.

 The proximity to the Darjeeling tea estate was a selling point, but the presence of a large number of Chinese faces did more than its bit to tip the scales in Calcutta?s favour. 

 ?We had to get hold of more than 110 Chinese people for the shoot. Had the Chinese element not been a part of the storyboard, the ad would have been shot in Kunnoor,? said production manager Sandeep Rudra.

 The New Year celebrations, however, made it difficult to draw so many Chinese residents to the shoot. ?They just don?t want to face the camera,? said Jikesh Shah, one of the casting coordinators. ?We spent more than a week in Tangra trying to convince them to appear in the ad film.?

 Those who finally did, ended up making close to Rs 1,000 per day. And that?s where the economic consideration comes in. As Ragesh B. Asthanaa, casting director of Kas Movie Makers, put it: ?In the West, they have to pay every extra actor at least $500 a day. Here, one can make do with as little as Rs 500 per day. So, for a shoot that involves 110 extras, you can imagine how much money is saved in a place like Calcutta.?

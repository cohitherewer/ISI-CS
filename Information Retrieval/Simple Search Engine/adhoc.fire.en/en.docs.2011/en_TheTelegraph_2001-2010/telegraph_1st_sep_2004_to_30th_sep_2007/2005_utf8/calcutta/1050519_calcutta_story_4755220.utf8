 Man and nature

 In a world where man uses his energy to fight nature, deforming and defiling its beauty with the ugliness of his ambitions, it is the duty of the artist to revive mans love for nature, reminding him how inextricably his life is linked with it. ... I go on forever, the ongoing exhibition of watercolours by Indranath Bandyopadhyay, epitomises this vital responsibility of the artist. The works on show portray the awesome beauty and power of nature, emphasizing its ability to protect and nurture human life. The juxtaposition of stiff, bold strokes in stark colours, along with soft, hazy tones spread lightly across the canvas, combines to generate an impression of nature in all its aspects ? fierce and calm, destructive and benevolent. Richly symbolic images depicting human cruelty to nature and its harmful consequences help us realize man?s absolute dependence on nature and his need to care for it for his own survival.

 Event: An exhibition of watercolours by Indranath Bandyopadhyay

 When: Till May 20, 10 am - 7 pm

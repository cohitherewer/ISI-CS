The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Step out with the skipper, go global with grub 

What 

does it take to give your boyfriend the slip and jive at the call of the console? 

A captain?s knock. Revellers at Prince of Cal in Sourav?s were taken by surprise 

when Sourav Ganguly himself made a surprise visit at the nightclub on Saturday 

night. 

The skipper made many a female heart skip a beat with 

his moves on the dance floor to guest DJ Sunny Sarid?s mix. The Maharaja grooved 

to tracks like Bheege honth tere, Saat samundar paar and Bin 

tere sanam, proving that even if he?s more used to wielding the willow on 

22 yards of green, he doesn?t have two left feet on the dance floor, either!

The cricketer let go of the initial inhibition to 

step out in style (not to a spinner, for once) as the crowds went wild. 

?Though I like to dance, I hardly get the time to 

do so. But now I try to come and relax here once in a while,? said Sourav.

Better half Dona and daughter Sana also paid a brief 

visit to the Park Street address but steered clear of the dance floor. 

All that jazz

The chilly winter evening on Friday saw a cosy crowd 

all wrapped up enjoying some delectable music while warming up with endless rounds 

of free-flowing drinks at Tollygunge Club.

The Seagram?s 100 Pipers- sponsored Open Doors musical 

meet brought Mito to the club lawns. An internationally acclaimed Indo-German 

jazz band, Mito played in India for the first time on Friday, interspersing Indian 

classical ragas with jazz tunes quite effortlessly. 

Mito, rated among the top three bands in Germany, 

uses an eclectic range of instruments including tabla, flute, guitar and 

something called a vibraphone.

The Calcutta crowd was left spellbound by the display 

and the musicians were applauded generously, even if that meant pulling the palms 

out of warm jacket pockets.

The band is led by Ralf Kampuis, the leader of Hamburg 

Jazz and one of the more respected names in German music. Other members include 

Torge Niemann whose flamboyant playing style was perfected under the guidance 

of some leading guitarists and who has composed and produced for Bob Dylan, no 

less. Electric bassist Martin Drees and Dipak Sharma on flute got together with 

Juergen Busse, a jazz drummer, and another member Subrata Manna to complete Mito.

The band has recently released an album, Dance 

With Us, which is a heady mix of flamboyant displays and retrained playing 

by the various musicians.

Jam jamboree

World cuisine and Bollywood beats flavoured the International 

Night at Calcutta Club, held in association with The Telegraph, on Saturday. 

The melody mix kick started with a vigorous jam session 

involving percussionists Tanmoy Bose and Bikram Ghosh, that helped warm up the 

mood on the cold Saturday night. 

After their handiwork, it was time for some foot-tapping 

numbers. Bombay Vikings brought Bollywood to town with tracks like Woh chali 

and Chhod do aanchal, and Calcuttans to the dance floor. DJ Akash took 

charge thereafter to keep the good times rolling. 

All the spirited jiving was reason enough for members 

and guests to tuck into the lavish food spread from across the globe. Recipes 

from The Alps and The Mediterranean, courtesy Oberoi Grand, rubbed plates with 

Chinese cuisine from Mainland China. Not to be left behind, HHI came forward with 

a Mexican mix, while Sourav?s tried its hand at some Qatar cuisine. There were 

stalls by the consulates of Nepal and Portugal as well, among many other countries 

that readily offered their own brand of exotica. 

One could wrap up with some delicious desserts by 

Escoffier. The Bavaros and the Choco Fudge Brownies were great hits.

Sending the spirits soaring was the launch of Royal 

Crown Rare Deluxe Whiskey by Mason and Summers. The single malt scotch blended 

with quality Indian grain spirits went well with the mood of the international 

night.

The team of experts from Chateau Indage helped out 

with tips on storage, choice, serving and drinking etiquettes to carry the fun 

home.

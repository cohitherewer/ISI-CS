 A remote-controlled vehicle that reaches places humans can?t; a wave of a pen that negates the need of the keyboard and the mouse to operate a PC.

 Not products from the research and development laboratories of a giant MNC, these are, instead, gadgets developed with passion by a small engineering school in Howrah.

 Meet the Unmanned Ground Vehicle and the Smart-eyed Finger Pointer, projects perfected at the Liluah campus of MCKV Institute of Engineering, and on display at the Infocom 2005 exhibition on the Salt Lake stadium grounds.

 ?The Unmanned Ground Vehicle is ideal for jobs like bomb-detection or to access places beyond human reach,? said Saurav Chakraborty of MCKV.

 The device can be guided by a mobile phone over the existing GSM network. ?One phone is placed on the vehicle and the other is in the user?s hand. The keypad can be used to control the speed and direction,? Chakraborty explained.

 There is also a camera on board which captures images and sends them back to a display unit through a built-in antenna. ?The vehicle can move within a range of 100 m but the limit is only due to licensing issues and not technology,? Chakraborty added.

 The institute has pitched the idea to Calcutta Police.

 The other wonder device is a keyboard and mouse replacement, developed by MCKV students keeping in mind the physically challenged. This system utilises a webcam to input data into a PC that would otherwise require a keyboard and a mouse. A software first ?trains? itself for a particular colour placed before the camera. Movement of the colour then mobilises the cursor and performs point-and-click functions. Microsoft?s in-built visual keyboard is utilised to type words and numbers.

 ?A tool like this would greatly benefit the physically challenged. Just by wearing a headband with a particular colour on it, they can operate a PC,? said Subhadip Basu, supervising professor for the project done by students.

 NGOs working with disabled persons have shown interest in the system, Basu added.

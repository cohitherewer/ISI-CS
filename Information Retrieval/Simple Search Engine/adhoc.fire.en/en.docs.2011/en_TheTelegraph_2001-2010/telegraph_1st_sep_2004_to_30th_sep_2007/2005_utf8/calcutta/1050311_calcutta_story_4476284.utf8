Maureen Wadia?s scathing remarks on the ill-exposed 

and inexperienced models of Calcutta may have taken some wind out of the sails 

of the city youth eyeing the glamour path. But the hometown of Koena Mitra still 

has some steam left. 

 Representing Calcutta at the Britannia Gladrags Mega Model and Manhunt Contest 2005 in Bombay on April 9 will be Konkona Bakshi. A regular face on the city ramp, Konkona has been selected to strut the stage on the big night and stake her claim to the most sought-after title on the Indian fashion scene. 

 The resident of Lake Town was one of the 300 participants from the city who appeared for the preliminary round in Calcutta on February 22. ?When I enrolled for the prelims I was absolutely sure that I would not even make it to the next round. But when I received a confirmation letter from Maureen Wadia?s office a couple of weeks later, I was absolutely thrilled. It came as a pleasant surprise,? admits candid Konkona.

 Though Gladrags is her first shot at a beauty contest, Konkona did participate in the Zee Musafir Item Bomb Contest last year and emerged first runner-up. 

 So how did the Class XI student of Mother?s International School manage to impress the lady with a sharp eye for beauty who has launched many a starry career. ?The only criteria to make it through to Gladrags is to have a great body. They always look for a proportionate frame and a good height. A positive attitude is also what they like in a contestant. You stand no chance at all if you are nervous and shaky,? says Konkona.

 This Bengali babe, who won the Gladrags Mega Model 

Contest in 2002 from Calcutta, has no inhibitions in doing things Khullam khulla. 

Though KOENA MITRA does not have a single solo performance to her name as an actress, 

she is still among the most sought-after item girls in Bollywood today, specially 

after her scorching performance in Saki saki re from Musafir

Traversing the road from the Calcutta ramp to the Mumbai scene hasn?t been easy. Konkona had to compete with 300-odd participants in the first round that saw 50 per cent of the girls being disqualified, even as they slipped into their bikinis to display their toned torsos.

 ?It was during the swimwear round that I got a hunch that Maureen was giving me extra attention. She had a careful look at my body and told me that I could go places if I groom myself under proper guidance,? recalls Konkona.

 Not surprisingly, she sailed through to the third round, and before long found herself among the three finalists. A few weeks later, Konkona learned she had been selected to represent the eastern zone.

 Surprised she might be but Konkona is raring to put up a good fight on D- day.

 ?I am quite comfortable in swimwear and the question-and-answer round does not matter much in this contest. So there is little cause for concern,? beams the mega model wannabe.

She leaves for Mumbai on March 14 and from there Konkona, 

along with other contestants, goes to Mauritius for the grooming session.

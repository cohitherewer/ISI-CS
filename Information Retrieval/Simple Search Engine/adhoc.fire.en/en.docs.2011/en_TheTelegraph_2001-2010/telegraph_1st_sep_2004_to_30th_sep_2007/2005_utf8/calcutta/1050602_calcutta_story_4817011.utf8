 ?You can create an impact in just two scenes,? feels Rukhsar

 Return of the prodigal 

 girl

 From Deepak Anand to Ram Gopal Varma. From Aditya Panscholi to Randeep Hooda. From Yaad Rakhegi Duniya to D. Rukhsar never thought anyone would remember her two-movie filmography after her 12-year hibernation from filmdom. But the world, in parts, does remember her and with D releasing this Friday, her reappearance is sure being touted as a comeback.

 ?People still remember me because of my performance in that film (Yaad Rakhegi Duniya),? she says. ?Wherever I went to look for work after all these years, they knew who I was and where I came from. And it?s not that I want to hide my early films from the industry.?

 But what was the secret behind the sudden sanyas after being lauded for her performance as the sweet little Naina? ?I was very young then and my parents thought the film industry was too big for me to cope with,? Rukhsar reasons. ?Also, I come from a very small place named Rampur in Uttar Pradesh. So, I went back and finished my studies. And now, when my parents feel that I am intelligent enough to handle the industry, here I am.?

 In her second innings, Rukhsar visited quite a few film studios looking to be launched afresh. Varma?s Factory was among the first places she turned up at. Varma, unlike other so-called pros in big, bad Bollywood, had neither heard of Yaad Rakhegi Duniya nor did he care about Rukhsar?s early association with filmdom. ?I was first signed for Sarkar,? the actress reveals. ?Then D?s director Vishram Sawant saw me and cast me in his film.?

 It was the role in D that turned out to be more meaty. ?I play this film actress who Deshu, played by Randeep, comes across in the course of his journey in the underworld,? is all that Rukhsar?s ready to divulge.

 And she also refuses to be drawn into the controversy about D allegedly being a docu-feature on the rise of Dawood Ibrahim and being sanctioned by Chhota Rajan.

 So, how harsh were the arc lights after all these years? ?Acting has always been my first love,? declares Rukhsar. ?So there was no camera fright as such. There was no edgy feeling or nervousness at all. In fact, now that the film is about to release this Friday, I am having those butterflies in the stomach.?

 And the butterflies can do more darting around once the real Varma biggie, Sarkar, hits the theatres later in June. So what exactly is Rukhsar doing in the all-male desi remake of The Godfather? ?I play the wife of Kay Kay Menon, the elder son of Mr Bachchan, who is Sarkar. And yes, although it is a men-oriented movie, all the women ? Katrina, Tanishaa and me ?have important roles, if not lengthy roles. I don?t think you need a big role to create an impact. If you even have just two scenes and you perform well and your role is properly etched out, you will create an impact,? says Rukhsar.

 Her small-screen stint before the Varma double bill is something Rukhsar?s not too willing to talk about. ?Yes, I did a serial on Zee TV called Chi And Me,? she almost whispers. 

 ?I didn?t sign any film then and being a working woman I couldn?t sit at home and do nothing. Also, the producers of the show were friends. But now that the contract with the channel is about to end, I am not going to do the serial anymore.?

 Will it just be big-screen products churned out by the Varma Factory? ?No, not only the Factory,? insists Rukhsar. ?Inshallah, my next release should be outside the Factory. Two big projects are almost finalised. I want to do all sorts of movies in the next 10 years but they should be performance-based.?

 Urmila, Antara, Ishaa and?. Rukhsar?

 Bin tere sanam rocked the party circuit. Woh lamhe became the national anthem of the night clubs. The man behind the two remixes, DJ Suketu, is back with yet another chartbuster ? Kya khoob lagti ho from the Feroze Khan and Hema Malini starrer Dharmatma, a superhit of the Seventies. 

 It is a superb song, shot on the stylish Feroze Khan and the elegant Hema Malini in the deserts of Afghanistan. We have the hot duo of Upen Patel and Udita Goswami to set the screen on fire. The video is directed and choreographed by Ahmed Khan. It is an absolute dance track. Even a person with two left feet would be forced to hit the dance floor if this track came on, DJ Suketu told Goodlife from Mumbai.

 The album is called Bed Lounge, after the nightclub where he is the resident DJ. They have produced the entire album, hence the name, adds Suketu.

 The album has nine tracks of which eight are remixes and one an original track. Some of remixed tracks are Ho jaata hai kaise pyar from Yalgaar, Teri chahat from Mr Aashiq and Meri nazar hai from The Burning Train. 

 Would Kya khoob match up to the success of its two predecessors? Comparisons of any sort are absolutely unfair, says the table-turner.

 But it is also inevitable. I am aware of it. With the success the two songs had, people will be expecting the sky. The song I have chosen is very good and an all-time hit. I have remixed it in the best possible way I could. As for the final result, thats completely up to the junta to decide, adds Suketu. 

 The DJ is quite upbeat about the look of the song. First of all this is the most expensive video shot for a private album. Udita looks really stunning. But the USP is the various special effects that have been used in the video, very similar to those used for films like The Matrix, Spider-Man and The Terminator, says Suketu. 

 Kya khoob lagti ho is here, but the success of Woh lamhe is anything but a thing of the past. That song follows me wherever I go, admits Suketu.

 Next in console line is another song from the Bhatt brigade sung by Atif Aslam of Woh lamhe fame.

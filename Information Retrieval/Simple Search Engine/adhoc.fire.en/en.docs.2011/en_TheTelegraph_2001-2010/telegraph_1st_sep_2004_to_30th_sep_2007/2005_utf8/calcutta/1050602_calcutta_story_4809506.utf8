 Plaster of Paris in a house of wax

 Paris Hilton is 

 one of the leading ladies in House of Wax 

 She loves fishing, although she lets them back into the water. The blonde babe also likes cooking. But what very few people probably know is that Paris Hilton is an ice hockey pro, having played the game since the 10th grade. Catching and defending are her strong points. She keeps in shape with her physical activity, not by working out in a gym. And she?s a regular girl next door ? her best friends are the ones from childhood.

 The hotel heiress has tried her hand at more than a few things ? perfume business, reality shows, singing and now acting. The star of House of Wax says she just loves doing what she loves. ?I love my music, my acting and I get to do everything I love. And I just feel really excited and I can?t wait for the next day. And I?m excited to wake up every morning and just live my life.?

 The dream does sour every now and then. Every time she steps out of home actually, with 50 photographers camped outside her home. It?s scary, she says. Don?t pay attention to what the media says, or you?ll go crazy, is her advice. But a small price to pay, perhaps, for being able to do all that she loves. ?I love me. I don?t think anything?s wrong with it,? she asserts.

 In House of Wax, Paris plays Paige Edwards, who, along with friends, is stuck in town where the residents turn people into wax statues. The star of The Simple Life loved doing the horror flick, but screamed when she saw the film. ?And I was screaming when my death scene happened. It?s just a really cool death scene. This movie is a great, fun summer movie. It?s really scary. It?s really gory. It?s sexy. The guys are so hot.?

 See Paris Die was the film?s promotional line. See Paris Strip could also have done the job. But the striptease scene wasn?t as easy to do as most might assume. 

 ?They were actually singing my single Screwed while I was shooting it. And I said that I wanted a closed set. And I only had Jaume the director there, who I trust. And he was just filming. No one else was there because I was embarrassed to be dancing and taking my clothes off. Oh, I felt so cheesy. But I was doing it to my song, so I felt really sexy. And then I just did it. And it turned out really good.?

 The sexy lady has finished filming Bottoms Up, a romantic comedy, with co-star Jason Mewes. For now, she?ll continue to do what she loves. But even that?s a tough task sometimes. ?I don?t like to watch myself onscreen really. Not on the big screen ? some parts I liked, but then, I don?t know ? you always think things like, ?I don?t like the face I made there.? Things like that.?

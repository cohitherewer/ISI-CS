Fusion, the resto-bar in Golden Park, hosted Abbey Fizardo on Saturday night. The Goan singer was last seen crooning Khallas in Ram Gopal Varmas Company. Currently, Tarana pyar ka, the title track from his new album, is being aired on all channels. 

 Abbey was in Fusion to croon some of the latest hits from Hindi movies. And, of course, to promote his new album. It is an album with eight great remixes. It took a little long ,but I am sure listeners would not be disappointed, said Abbey, whose only Bollywood venture was Khallas in 2002.

 Kal kya hoga, Andar bahar, Chalti ka naam gadi ? songs that Abbey has chosen for his new album, turn the clock back. But at Fusion he stuck to the party numbers Teri toh, Dus bahaane, Just chill and Woh lamhey?

 Tarana Pyar Ka is his third album after Josh (2000) and Fida (2002). Choreographer Ganesh Hegde, a good friend of mine, put me through to RGV and within no time, I was on. Along with the playback, I also made an appearance in the video, smiled Abbey. 

 That was the last one heard from Abbey in the movies. After Khallas, I was flooded with offers for item numbers. But I decided not to sing for any other movie.

 But very soon, he will take up position in front of the camera, for the small screen.

 Where crime roams free

 - Thakurpukur?s goons won?t spare even policemen?s kin

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A dozen incidents of snatching and assault, but not a single arrest.

 In the Thakurpukur police station area, it is not just local residents but also the cops? families that are suffering, while criminals go about their business without a care.

 Around 4 pm on Tuesday, a cyclist snatched a gold chain from Sanghamitra Thakur, a beautician by profession, who had stepped out of her Chatterjee Bagan residence in Keorapukur for some work.

 ?I tried to grab him by his collar but he escaped as the road was almost empty. A washerman who was ironing clothes in his stall nearby tried but didn?t succeed in stopping the thief,? she said.

 The incident is not an isolated one as in the past one month, there have been at least half-a-dozen cases of snatching in Keorapukur alone. Residents claim all of them were reported to the local police but no action was taken.

 ?Police could neither arrest the culprits nor recover the loot,? alleges Sudipto Thakur, Sanghamitra?s husband.

 The brazen snatchers do not spare relatives of the cops, either. A few days ago, some of them made off with a gold chain from a cop?s mother. 

 She, too, complained to the local police, but to date nothing has been done. The criminals are active mainly in Chatterjee Bagan, Banerjee Para and Bank Colony areas ? where streets are usually empty in the afternoons.

 ?When we reported the incident to the local police station, the men on duty pleaded helplessness. We suggested patrolling in plainclothes. But they told us clearly that fighting crime was impossible till the number of policemen and vehicles were increased,? said a local resident.

 Rabin Chakraborty, another resident of the area, said the crime rate had been under control till a few years ago. ?In the recent past, a girl was assaulted by a local youth. When she went to Keorapukur police outpost with a friend, the duty officer misbehaved with them. Though the matter was brought to the notice of higher police authorities, no action has been taken against the officer. After every incident, the local police offers lame excuses,? Chakraborty said.

 Even till a year ago, there were hardly any cases of snatching or eve-teasing in the area. ?But recently, the number of such incidents has risen rapidly. If local police maintain a close watch, such crime can easily be curbed,? he said.

 C.K. Dutta, additional superintendent of police (rural), who is also functioning as superintendent of police, tried to play down the spate of incidents, claiming they were the handiwork of two or three youths. ?We are putting all efforts to arrest the criminals,? Dutta said.

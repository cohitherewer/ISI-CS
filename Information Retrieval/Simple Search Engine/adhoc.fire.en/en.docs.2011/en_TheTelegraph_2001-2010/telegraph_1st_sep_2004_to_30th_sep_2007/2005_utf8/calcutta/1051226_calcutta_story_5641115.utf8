What: Beyond Barriers, organised by St Xaviers 

College Calcutta Alumni Association in association with The Telegraph.

Where: St Xaviers College campus.

When: Friday night.

The show: The star-studded bash kicked off 

with a performance by local talent Tritha at 6.30 pm. Then, it was the turn of 

another local favourite, Shayne Hyrapiet, to make the crowd dance to his tunes.

The star: The high point of the evening, of 

course, was the 150-minute stay of Sourav Ganguly, on selection eve. His arrival 

caused a near stampede with everyone trying to get close to the old boy. A Xaverian 

from Class I till graduation, Sourav looked quite at home on the Park Street campus. 

It was so difficult to find time for sports, but thanks to my teachers I 

was always encouraged to play, recounted Bengals sporting hero. Looking 

chilled out in a brown jacket and accompanied by his mother, brother and sister-in-law, 

Sourav unveiled plans for the colleges second campus before taking his place 

in the front row.

Bollywood beat: Vasundhara Das and Kunal Ganjawala 

were the stars on stage. The Salaam Namaste girl performed for a good 45 

minutes, belting out hits like Its the time to disco, Kajra re, 

My heart goes... and Salaam namaste. She bowled everyone over, including 

the Prince of Calcutta. It was really a privilege to have Sourav in the 

house. He walked up to me and congratulated me, smiled Vasundhara.

Kunal kicked off his performance with Janabe ali, 

followed by Bheege honth tere and Salaam namaste.

Souravs presence, the crowd count in thousands 

and some great performers. The efforts of the organising committee were not wasted, 

smiled Imran Zaki Siddiqui, secretary, SXC Alumni Association.

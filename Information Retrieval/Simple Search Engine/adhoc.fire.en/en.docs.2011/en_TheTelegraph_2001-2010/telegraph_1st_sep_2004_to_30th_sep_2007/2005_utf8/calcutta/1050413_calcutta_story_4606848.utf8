 From the latest array of building products, fittings and furnishings to expert advice on vaastu, Feng Shui and interiors. Home finance tips and legal counselling on interactive voice response to landscaping and even assistance with plan sanction.

 Block By Block, the 215,000-sq-ft speciality mall coming up in Action Area I, New Town, Rajarhat, dedicated to homemaking accessories and allied resources, promises to address the entire gamut of consumer needs in the burgeoning township and beyond.

 Being developed by Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd, a joint venture between the West Bengal Housing Board and the Shrachi Group, the ?complete home solution mall?, housing around 150 retail outlets, will be up and running by August 2006.

 ?This will be the first such effort in the public-private partnership domain. With 10,000 individual plot-owners within a two-km radius, we have a growing demand and the idea is to stitch together under one convenient roof the goods and services of a College Street market and a Chandni Chowk,? explains Rahul Todi, managing director, Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd.

 Designed by Singapore-based architect Stephen Coates, Block By Block will have a ?trendy international look? from both inside and outside. Coates, serving corporate and international clients for 15 years, has lead design teams for commercial projects including offices, retail, residential, master planning, mixed-use developments and interiors in the UK, mainland Europe, Hong Kong and China.

 The second ?first? at the home solution stop is a call centre, a ?convenience at fingertips?. To avail of the service, one has to dial the helpline number and follow automated prompts through the interactive voice response system (IVRS), with the option of speaking to a home-solution specialist. The service will be chargeable at normal landline/mobile rates, as per the relevant tariff plan.

 ?At Bengal Shrachi, we are constantly working towards providing quality homes. And as our punchline goes ? ?The Complete Home Store? ? we wish to give our customers a rich blend of quality products and services for the perfect home,? Todi adds.

 With its complete range of home-related products and services, the Rs 75-crore project promises ?an unparalleled international lifestyle experience?. A training centre for masons and plumbers will be housed within the mall to add to the resource pool of the catchment, and a wing for fire safety-related products and processes will showcase best practices.

 ?We are keen to address the minute needs of a household, like sending the washing machine or the mixer-grinder for repair. Block By Block will house service hubs for all household gadgets and articles,? says Todi. 

 It will also serve as cash-and-carry for small retailers in far-flung areas, feels the mall management. 

 Adequate storage space will be provided to ensure ?odd-time and small-quantity? delivery to customers.

 For New Town residents, both current and prospective, Block By Block will also offer specialised counselling on all housing and property-related issues, besides helping out in plan sanctions and relevant approvals from Hidco.

Featuring works of renowned old masters as well as established contemporary artists, the show holds some surprises too. Participating artists include Shyamal Mukherjee, Santosh Rohatgi (The Shepherd Boy; picture above), Sumon Roy, Apto Bhattacharya, Sujit Karan, Sibsaday Chaudhuri, Somnath Chakravorty, Chandra Bhattacharya, Prokash Karmakar, Bratin Khan, Sanatan Dinda, Subroto Gangopadhyay and Suhas Roy.

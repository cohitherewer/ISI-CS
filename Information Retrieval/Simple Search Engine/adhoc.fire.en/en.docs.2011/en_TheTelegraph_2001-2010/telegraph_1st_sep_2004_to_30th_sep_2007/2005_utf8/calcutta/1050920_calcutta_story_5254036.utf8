 Toons, made in Calcutta

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Disney cartoons could soon have a ?Made in Calcutta? stamp, if a city animation agency is to be believed.

 ?We have recently procured the US Animation Harmony software, used by companies like Disney,? said V.C. Bhalotia of Dawsen Infotech. The company claims to be the first in the country to have the high-end animation set-up.

 ?Disney is looking for suppliers in India and China who can do the same kind of work on the Harmony platform,? Bhalotia added. 

 Dawsen, which has produced animated serials like Thakurmar Jhulie and the soon-to-be-aired Tuntuni, is discussing projects with ?leading global animation companies?.

 ?The software set-up allows us great improvement in the quality and speed of work. We can now look at animation projects that can earn $5,000 per minute and $3 million for an entire series,? Bhalotia said.

 The company, which claims to cover ?80 per cent? of the Calcutta animation market, is planning to increase its staff strength from 70 to 100 this year, and has invested around Rs 70 lakh on the US Animation setup.

 Harmony is produced by Canada-based Toon Boom Animation Inc, which counts among its clients big names like Warner Bros and Paramount Pictures.

 The software enables studios to produce high-quality digital and traditional animation with features such as morphing and inverse kinematics.

 Some of Toon Boom?s animation tools have been used in movies like Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Rugrats: The Movie and SpongeBob: The Movie.

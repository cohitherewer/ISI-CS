 Charlize Theron: Monstrous appeal

If, traditionally, the Golden Globes kick off the 

major Hollywood awards season, they also provide a glimpse of the sights that 

will sizzle on the red carpet. 

 But in that regard, this year?s Globes ? as far as the women were concerned ? seemed a bit of a letdown, with unremarkably dressed winners and not a single scandalous one (think J.Lo?s star turn at the Oscars).

 Best actress (drama) Hillary Swank looked? well, okay, but minus much oomph. Best supporting actress Natalie Portman, too, looked rather simple in white.

 Some of the gorgeous gals who didn?t win, however, added the much-needed glam. Leading the way was Charlize Monster Theron, looking like a zillion dollars. The blonde look of Monster has given way to a dark, new hairstyle. Theron?s also back to her hourglass figure after the bloat-up job for the Oscar-winning role in Monster.

 Another actress with a monster connection who stood out was Halle Berry, looking more and more beautiful with every passing year. Nicole Kidman didn?t fare badly either, shining resplendent in short hair and peacock feather-stuffed dark blue gown!

Preity with the Indian Idol contestants: We are family

 After the Zayed Khans and the Juhi Chawlas, it will be the turn of film-maker Sanjay Leela Bhansali to become judge number four for the Thursday episode of Indian Idol. But the real attraction is the Friday episode when none other than Preity Zinta strides into the sets of the happening talent hunt show on the telly.

 Preity will not only grace the show but also conduct a confidence-building workshop for the contestants. Catch her in action as she spouts words of wisdom and some useful tips on building the right attitude, poise and stage presence. The Indian Idol finalists will try to have all their doubts and apprehensions about life in the limelight addressed.

 Speaking on her experience with Indian Idol contestants, Preity said: ?As goes the famous saying? confidence, like art, never comes from having all the answers? it comes from being open to all the questions. I believe that the one to scale heights is the one who knows the secrets to making dreams come true. I think it?s quite brilliant that such talented singers have come to the forefront and have already become celebrities in their own right. I am extremely happy to be a small part of their significant journey.?

 And speaking on Preity?s appearance on Indian Idol, Tarun Katial, executive vice-president amp; business head, Sony Entertainment Television, said: ?We are sure that Preity Zinta?s expertise will bridge the yearning for the right mix of poise and self-confidence required for success.?

 Continuing its campaign to dig out the truth and nothing but the truth, STAR News has recently blown the lid off a startling and rather widespread racket involving tantriks. 

 STAR News has uncovered the fraud on a daily basis for 21 days through its popular crime bulletins ? Sansani and Red Alert. Captured on camera, these tantriks have admitted to gross wrongdoing including rape, murder and extortion.

 Subsequent to the overwhelming response from the viewers on the initial revelations, STAR News kicked off an aggressive campaign to expose these acts. The channel threw open a dedicated phone line for viewers to report such fraudulent tantriks they have encountered or are aware of. Close to 40,000 viewers called in since the night of December 27, 2004, and complaints poured in from different parts of the country.

 Sansani telecasts at 11 pm (Monday-Friday) with repeats the next day at 10.30 am. Red Alert telecasts at 11.30 pm on Saturday, with repeats at 5.30 am and 11.30 am on Sunday.

Jennifer Lopez: Namesake

 Jennifer Lopez?s breakthrough music album On The Six was named after the bus she used to take everyday before becoming the big international celeb that she is. 

 And now her new album?s title too has a tale to tell. The actress-singer is so sick of her ?J. Lo? stage name, she nearly titled her upcoming album Call Me Jennifer. The singer ? who ultimately settled on Rebirth as the moniker for her new disc ? is desperate to ditch her J. Lo tag so she can propel the true Jennifer into the spotlight, and bury the reputation attached to her alter-ego. 

 As she puts it: ?I?m not J. Lo, she?s not a real person. She was just a bit of fun that got really crazy. I?ve never been anyone but Jennifer. I was going to call the album Call Me Jennifer because that would be my way of saying goodbye to the whole J. Lo thing. But Rebirth is perfect because it means so much more.?

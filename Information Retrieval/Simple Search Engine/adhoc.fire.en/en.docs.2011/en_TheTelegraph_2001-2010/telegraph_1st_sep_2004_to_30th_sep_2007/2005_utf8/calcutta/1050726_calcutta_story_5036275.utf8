 An island in the mainstream

 Scarlett Johansson in a moment from The Island

 If you thought she was lost in translation, find Scarlett Johansson filling up the frame in this Friday?s Hollywood action-adventure release, The Island. Directed by Michael Bay, the film is about Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor), an ordinary man hoping to be chosen to go to the The Island, reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. But when Lincoln discovers that he and all the others around him are actually human clones providing ?spare parts? for their original human counterparts, he makes a daring escape with fellow resident Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett).

 ?Jordan is very sweet and innocent,? Scarlett says about her character. ?She is completely passive about restrictions on her life. She believes there is an island, but she has a bond with Lincoln that makes her go along with him when he tells her, ?There is no island ? you have to trust me.? She is shocked, but every instinct tells her to go with him. So she does and trusts him more as a friend.?

 But there?s no physical fireworks between the two. ?It?s more of a soulful connection,? says Scarlett. ?They don?t know anything about sexual chemistry... totally naive because they have been living in a kind of a plastic bubble with no knowledge of the outside world. But, it?s a wonderful love story in a way as it shows that, against all odds, people who are supposed to come together will.?

 And the soulful chemistry was an important reason for Scarlett to take up the film. ?The development of my character?s relationship with Lincoln is only one of the things that brought me to The Island,? she says. ?I am a big fan of genre movies, and when I read the script, I was excited to know what was going to happen next. I really wanted to work with Ewan and Michael, too ? so all of those elements made me want to do this movie.?

 But it wasn?t easy for the lady, with a whole lot of stunts thrown in. ?I?ve never done anything like that before ? it requires you to really keep fit,? Scarlett exclaims. ?The stunts were made even more challenging by the fact that when I arrived on the set, I had barely recovered from atonsillectomy. So there was almost no time for me to train for the physical demands of the role. Nevertheless, it?s interesting to have to push yourself to new limits. I?ve never had to run for my life, ever, but I did it every day on the set.?

 After The Island, Scarlett will appear in three films that come from very different schools of film-making. First up there?s an untitled Woody Allen project alongside Hugh Jackman about an American student having an affair with an aristocrat in London. Then there?s Brian de Palma?s The Black Dahlia set in 1940s Los Angeles about the investigation of the brutal murder of a young woman. And finally, there?s Barry Levinson?s A View From the Bridge about how an infatuation with a niece places a strain on a man?s marriage and goes on to create a scandal within the family.

 ?In relation to the character roles I play, I feel there is a little piece of yourself in every character that you do, even if you are playing some psychotic person,? feels Scarlett. ?I have an obsessive character, I manicure my nails at three in the morning because nobody else can do it the right way. Maybe that?s the secret to my success. Also, it?s great to get older and learn ? it doesn?t really bind me by the years I have lived. I can identify just as much with my 86-year-old grandmother as I can with my sister.?

 And unlike the other actresses around, Scarlett does not believe in exposure. ?I think that the other actresses are kind of proud of the way they look and show it off. That?s never really been my style. There?s nothing really disgusting or wrong about it ? if you?re 18, you?re 18 ? it?s your body, it?s your right to show yourself. However, I don?t really take part in that. I like to look nice, but I think that there are ways of doing it that are more tasteful than just wearing a bikini wherever you go.?

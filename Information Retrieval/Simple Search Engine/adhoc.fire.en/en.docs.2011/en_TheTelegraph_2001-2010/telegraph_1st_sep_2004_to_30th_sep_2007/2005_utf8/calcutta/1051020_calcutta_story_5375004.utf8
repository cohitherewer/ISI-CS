 Justice? Come back later

 - Police jeep victim?s kin cry lost in blockade bandobast

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Chatterjee family?s quest for justice hit a dead end on Wednesday, with the police busy figuring out ways to combat Mamata Banerjee?s road blockade programme.

 On Tuesday, young executive Indranil Chatterjee, the sole breadwinner of the family, had been crushed under the wheels of a police jeep at the intersection of Cathedral Road and Queen?s Way. His mother, wife and four-year-old daughter survive him.

 The Chatterjees are determined to fight on. ?We have been asked to meet the police again on Friday. We will appeal to the chief minister to grant us a hearing and provide some justice,? said Indranil?s uncle Dipak Chatterjee.

 ?Indranil was the only earning member of the family. We will request the chief minister to provide his wife a job in any department of his choice,? he added.

 Dipak said it was rash and negligent driving on the part of the police driver that led to Indranil?s death and that the government should compensate the bereaved family.

 ?There is no way we can get Indranil back and the void will remain forever. The least we can expect is some help so that his family can pull through. We appeal to the chief minister to consider our case on humanitarian grounds,? the uncle stated.

 The traffic police claimed Indranil had taken a right turn from Queen?s Way into Cathedral Road and rammed into the police jeep. His family members maintained that the jeep had jumped a red light at the intersection and hit Indranil?s two-wheeler.

 They pointed out that since Indranil was heading for Tarakeswar, there was no need for him to take a right turn into Cathedral Road.

 He was heading for Vidyasagar Setu, they said.

 On Wednesday, Dipak and Indranil?s neighbour Manju Kar turned up at the office of the deputy commissioner of police (south) N.R. Babu, seeking justice. 

 The meeting had to be cut short as the deputy commissioner was busy with arrangements for Beni Santoso?s visit to the city on Thursday. 

 ?We even wanted to meet the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), but that wasn?t possible. We have been asked to come back on Friday,? said Kar.

 Back home, Indranil?s wife Rakhi and his mother Santana stayed in their rooms through the day, refusing to eat anything or even drink water. His colleagues visited them during the day.

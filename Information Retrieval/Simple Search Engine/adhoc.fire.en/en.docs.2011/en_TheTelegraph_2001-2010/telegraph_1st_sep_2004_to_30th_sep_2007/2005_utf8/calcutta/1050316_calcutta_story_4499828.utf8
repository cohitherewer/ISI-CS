The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Tip or two to beat exam blues

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should counselling for parents and students at school be made mandatory in the run-up to the Board exams? More responses will be published next week

Nilanjan Bhattacharjee,

Ultadanga 

Everyone has to face several pressure-cooker situations 

in life. The Board exams are only the beginning. Such a situation recurs innumerable 

times in one?s professional life. Anyone who needs counselling to face pressure 

situations would do well to spend his life in an asylum.

A. Bhattacharya, 

 Narendrapur

Yes, counselling of both parents and students is definitely 

required before Board exams. Given the competition in every sphere of life, parents 

are sometimes forced to put pressure on their children. Counselling sessions could 

help them and their children immensely in maintaining a proper perspective.

Pijush Banerjee, 

 Sarsuna

As a teacher, I find that counselling is very much 

necessary not only for students but for most parents, till their wards clear the 

Board exams. Most students suffer from psychological problems and have a fear 

psychosis concerning their teachers. Counselling can help students overcome their 

mental demons. 

Vinay Kumar DokanIa, 

 Howrah

Examinees and their parents have to handle a great 

deal of stress during the Board exams. Even basic counselling would go a long 

way in helping them cope with the pressure. Students will also be able to perform 

better if they are not tense.

Anuj Kumar Ghosh, 

 Vivekanandanagar

When youngsters try to become successful by doing 

something they are not cut out for, they put tremendous pressure on themselves. 

Career counselling can help them choose the right subjects, while psychological 

counselling can make them better equipped to deal with pressure. Hence, both are 

very, very necessary for students.

Nidhi Poddar, 

 Salt Lake

Counselling could be very productive at the school 

level. However, it is not necessary for schools to employ psychologists for the 

purpose. Teachers and parents could also be very effective as counsellors.

Shiv Shanker Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street

Why counselling? There are several more effective 

ways of reducing pressure on students before board exams. Scrapping the system 

of ?away centres? would cut down the stress level of examinees considerably. Improving 

the standard of teaching would also help.

Jyoti Agarwal,

 Lake Town

The necessity of counselling can be gauged from the 

number of workshops being organised to help students deal with stress. If counselling 

facilities are provided in all schools, then the students and parents won?t have 

to approach private organisations for the service.

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur

It will be pragmatic to make counselling sessions 

mandatory in view of the spurt in suicides among students appearing for Board 

exams. To make the sessions more effective, schools should appoint trained counsellors 

and psychiatrists. Counselling throughout the year may also be considered.

Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake 

Certainly. In these competitive times, parents sometime 

unwittingly transfer their own anxieties to their children. Counselling sessions 

are essential not only for the betterment of the students? results and life, but 

they also teach parents how to reduce the pressure on their children, instead 

of becoming the sources of pressure themselves.

Sushma jalan,

 Alipore 

Pre-Board exam counselling of parents and students 

should be made mandatory so that both parents and students have a clear idea about 

the exam and what lies ahead. Parents often pressure children to study, sometimes 

to disastrous effects. Counselling will help both parents and students to approach 

exams in a level-headed manner. Counselling can also help students have a better 

idea of what they should study after clearing their Board exams.

T.R. Anand, 

 Budge Budge

Counselling of students and their parents should not 

be made mandatory at schools. Forced counselling might backfire and yield poor 

results. Counselling should be made optional instead.

Joydip Sur,

 CIT Road

Counselling of parents and students should definitely 

be made mandatory not just before Board exams, but in school as well. Despite 

having the best of intentions, parents sometimes do not handle their children 

well. To deal with issues better, both parents and students need professional 

help.

Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Borehat

Parents tend to push students into a rat race, without 

considering their ability to handle pressure. It is the duty of educationists 

to ease such pressures on children. Teachers and psychologists should work in 

tandem in schools. Counsellors can help parents realise the true potential of 

their wards. 

Rajarshi Ghosh,

 Surya Nagar

Yes, I think it should be mandatory for students and 

their parents to undergo counselling in the run up to the Board exams. The counselling 

sessions would at least help students to deal with tension better and bring out 

their best.

Sandip Mallik,

 Hazra Road

Most students find the tremendous competition in academic 

spheres difficult to cope with. Parents add to the pressure by laying too much 

of an emphasis on good results. To protect students from psychological damage, 

counselling is necessary.

Sohini Roy,

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue

The counselling of parents and students must be made 

mandatory in the run-up to the Board exams. There has been an increase in the 

number of students who commit suicide before Board exams due to severe pressure 

and resultant depression. Exams are causing mental trauma in students and something 

must be done to improve the situation.

Debashree Mukherjee,

 Salt Lake

Nowadays both examinees and their parents become stressed 

before board exams. Counsellors can provide valuable tips to help them deal with 

tension.

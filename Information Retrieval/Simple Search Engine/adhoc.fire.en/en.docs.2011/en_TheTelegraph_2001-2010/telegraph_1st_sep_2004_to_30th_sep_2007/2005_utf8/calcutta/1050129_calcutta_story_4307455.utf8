 Arts and the woman

 Comprising a group of women artists, The Groups mission is to bring to focus talents in the world of art. The ongoing exhibition of their paintings and sculptures is a study in experimentation and use of innovative techniques. Boldly re-inventing their individual styles, the women have drawn inspiration from topical themes to visually narrate recent social happenings as viewed from an artists perspective. Santosh Rohtagis paintings (picture left; Faith and Despair) show a combination of rhythmic, linear strokes with an impression of structural solidity to give realism a new dimension. Shyamasree Basu?s commitment to social issues is depicted through abstraction and juxtaposition of colours. While mythological tribal magic is the forte of Dr Anjali Sengupta, Sudeshna Das stands out as a master of graphic design, manifested through her floral and close-up face forms. The compositions of Arati Das and Anita Dutta rely on sober, subdued tones, whereas Madhushree Muchhal concentrates on colour balance to achieve desired artistic effects. Also featuring the works of Sefali Mukherjee, Ballari Mukherjee, Tapati Mukhopadhyay, Uma Roy Choudhury and Minati Nath.

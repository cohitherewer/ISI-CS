 Withering of a rose

 Based on the life-story of a well-known actress of the Bengali stage of the yesteryears, Abhaashs latest production, Apurba Golap, is a socio-political narrative highlighting the futility of reform in a backward society steeped in rigidity, ignorance and false beliefs. In the play, Golap Sundari, a fallen woman, is introduced to the stage by radical reformer Upendra Nath Das. She adopts the pseudonym Sukumari, and soon becomes a popular actress. Gostabehari, a young actor, marries her, but society refuses to accept it. Meanwhile, Upendra is forced to leave the country after he transgresses a new law enforced by the government against anti-establishment drama. Gostabehari, who looked upon Upendra as his mentor, feels frustrated at the turn of events. Losing all purpose in life, he gives up his profession and sails abroad as the porter of a ship, leaving Sukumari all alone. Gostabehari dies on foreign soil and Upendra Nath returns to his native country to find his ideals dead. Instead, a different kind of theatre rules the contemporary stage. Written and directed by Dr Sekhar Samaddar.

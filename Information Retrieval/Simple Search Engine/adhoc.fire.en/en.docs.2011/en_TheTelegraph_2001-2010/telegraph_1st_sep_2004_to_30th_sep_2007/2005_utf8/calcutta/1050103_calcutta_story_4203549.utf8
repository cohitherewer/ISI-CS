Ticket 

tag: Rs 20 vs Rs 150 

Popcorn price: Rs 5 vs Rs 40 

Parking ticket: Rs 10 vs Rs 50. 

If price was all that mattered to the Calcutta consumer, 

the big-screen battle could not have been more lopsided. But the reel reality 

is the opposite ? the pricey multiplexes are bringing our precious single-screens 

crashing down.

As the audience hunts for more than just the movie, 

the biggest name on the casualty list for 2005 is Globe. ?Owing to spiralling 

cost of establishment, I have decided to close down Globe, latest by October,? 

said Arijit Dutta, owner of the Lindsay Street landmark and president of Eastern 

India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA). ?It pains me to close one of the city?s 

premier halls, established way back in 1827 as Grand Opera House, but I am losing 

anything between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000 every week to carry on operations.?

Globe is the latest in a growing list of single-screen 

theatres that have either downed shutters or are about to shut down. The multiplex 

effect, for many, is the closure cause. 

?It is more of a sign of the times,? said Prashant 

Srivastava of 89 Cinemas. ?We are going the Western way. Most single-screen theatres 

will give way to multiplexes over the next few years. And then, some multiplexes 

will also be eased out.?

For the moment, go multiplex or be murdered is the 

mantra. Owners of as many as 23 closed cinemas in Calcutta are poised to petition 

the state government to allow conversion of their premises into multiplexes. ?We 

are also trying to get the state government to pass an exit policy to help hall-owners 

use their premises for other commercial purposes, like shopping malls and restaurants,? 

said L. K. Kankaria, owner of Orient cinema.

A preliminary estimate prepared by the hall-owners? 

association of EIMPA pegged Rs 5 crore as the minimum requirement to convert a 

single-screen theatre into a multiplex. ?If we maintain the existing structure, 

then the cost can be kept to Rs 1 crore,? said Shyamal Dutta, a senior official 

of EIMPA.

Those behind the other movie-plus experiences in town 

feel it all boils down to the package you dish out. 

Gurinder Jeet Singh, vice-president, operations, INOX 

group, said: ?It?s just that the kind of package we offer, in terms of sound, 

picture quality and service, find favour with people right away. A certain section 

of the film-watching audience does frequent our multiplexes at Forum and City 

Centre, but now we are gradually reaching out to everyone.?

The main problem with single-screen theatres lies 

in revenue-generation. ?Loss of revenues is the prime reason behind the decision 

to close down Ujjala,? explained Dilip Kankaria, owner of the south Calcutta hall.

?Cinemas these days have become a losing concern due 

to a slump in the number of viewers. As far as Bollywood goes, the entire East 

generates only 15 per cent of the total revenue in the country,? added Arijit 

Dutta.

The owner of New Cinema in central Calcutta, B.K.Sethi, 

has been forced to use a portion of the hall as a shop stop. ?I had spent Rs 30 

lakh for renovation of the hall in 1997, but I was not getting adequate number 

of viewers,? he said. 

Large-scale piracy of potential money-spinners at 

the Bollywood box-office is the other killer. ?By Monday, pirated CDs of Friday 

films sweep the market and viewers refuse to take the trouble of going to the 

halls,? complained Tapandeb Banerjee, chairman of EIMPA?s exhibitor?s section.

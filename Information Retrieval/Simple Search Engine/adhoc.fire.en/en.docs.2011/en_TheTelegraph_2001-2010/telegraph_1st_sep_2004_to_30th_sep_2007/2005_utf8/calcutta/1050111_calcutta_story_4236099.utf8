 An extraordinary remedy

 What constitutes normal human behaviour is indeed a debatable issue. Often we perceive absurdities and eccentricities in a person because we ourselves hold a distorted view of acceptable social conduct. This is the theme of Mangalik?s production, Haroon-al Rashid. Written by Mohit Chattopadhyay, the play tells us the story of Jadupati Biswas, an elderly man, gentle and sympathetic by nature. Of late, he appears to be hallucinating about Haroon-al Rashid, the legendary, benevolent Khalifa of Baghdad. His wife, Charu, anxious and worried about his strange behaviour, seeks the advice of her brother, who calls in a famous psychiatrist to handle Jadupati?s case. What follows is as entertaining and eye-opening for the audience as it is bewildering and perplexing for Charu and her brother. Directed by Sameer Biswas, who also plays Jadupati, the comedy focuses on the fears and insecurities lurking within the human psyche.

Life

 His rhythm?s gonna get you

 When one of my students was practising, I told him to beat the drums as if it was the first time he was losing his virginity. Otherwise, how would he be different from all those who drum around?

 That?s from one of our best drummers, Ranjit Barot, for you ? unplugged. More popular as the music arranger and designer of such Bollywood musicals as Asoka, Aks, Fiza and Kisna, Barot was in town to jam with Skinny Alley, before hitting Someplace Else next Friday as part of the SPE festival Thank God It Rocks.

 Son of Sitara Devi, one of the greatest exponents of Hindustani classical music, Barot was into music very early. ?My mother told me, ?You can be with music as long as you make money?,? recalls the self-confessed foodie.

 ?So I started drumming for Kalyanji-Anandji, Laxmikant Pyarelal, RD Burman just to make enough money not to be sent for a higher education degree. Then I went on to be part of bands like The People and Waterfront.?

 And then the electronic revolution hit Barot in 1985. ?I was unemployed. There was no work for people into live music. I was forced to learn keyboards and all the technical stuff. It?s good that I did, as now I can write a 60-piece orchestra. At that time I started doing advertisement jingles with Louiz Banks before moving into film music again. This time, though, I wasn?t drumming ? I was writing background scores and arranging music.?

 Apart from setting to tune popular jingles like those of Nescafe and Reliance, Barot collaborated with Anu Malik, A.R. Rahman and Ismail Darbar for Bollywood scores. ?Every music director makes me perform in a different way and that?s how I like it. I will speak in Tamilian if I am in Chennai and in an American accent in New York. I love to take on the personality of the individual I am with.?

 Barot believes that his Indian roots and Western education in music equip him to turn a ?raw melody in a cassette? to the final mixed song in the soundtrack.

 ?I have a rich musical listening heritage. And that?s exactly what kids lack today. Their reference point is too current,? he feels.

 Amidst his filmi and advertising assignments and his live performances across the country and beyond, Barot has set up a sound studio near the Mumbai Race Course.

 ?It?s called Nirvana. When I was setting this place up, the people around kept asking, ?What the f*** is this guy building? Some sort of Taj Mahal?? But it?s turned out really good and I spend most of my hours there writing all kinds of music.?

 It is the music of Anubhav Sinha?s Dus, with half of Bollywood in it, that Barot is scoring now.

 ?Vishal-Shekhar have done the songs but the producers are also planning to bring out the original soundtrack of the film. I am also slated to do Anubhav?s next film titled Tathastu.?

 Calcutta, Barot admits, is one of the few places where he hasn?t played that much. ?The last time I came here for a show was way back in 1997 when the cops asked us to stop at CC amp;FC since our sound was creating pollution,? he laughs. 

 ?There should be more places like The Park who would be ready to support music. Music, like the arts as a whole, needs to be patronised for it to survive,? he signs off.

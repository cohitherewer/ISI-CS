 Trading charges over tram tracks

 - Bowbazar jewellers blame road mess for losses

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Roads mine, tram tracks yours. That?s mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s stock reply to the government whenever he is questioned about the condition of streets that have tram tracks.

 Now, over 500 jewellers of Bowbazar, under the banner of Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee, have decided to submit a deputation to the mayor, citing and blaming the condition of BB Ganguly Street for their losses.

 Mayoral council member (health) Pradip Ghosh, also president of the jewellers? committee, has initiated talks with other councillors of wards that have such damaged roads, in a bid for a joint deputation to the mayor.

 The thoroughfares worst-affected due to ill-maintained tram tracks are Mahatma Gandhi Road, Rabindra Sarani, Bidhan Sarani, APC Road, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Elliot Road, the eastern stretch of Park Street, Surya Sen Street, Lenin Sarani, BB Ganguly Street, Kalighat Road, Judges? Court Road, Circular Garden Reach Road and BK Pal Avenue.

 ?Why should tax-payers suffer? People are least bothered about jurisdiction. When the city and its roads belong to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), the mayor cannot deny responsibility for the deplorable condition of the roads with tram tracks,? pointed out mayoral council member Ghosh. ?If mayor Mukherjee really wants to wage war against the state government, he can cover up the tram tracks while repairing the roads,? added Ghosh.

 Worn-out tram tracks regularly cause traffic snarls on BB Ganguly Street, for which customers shun the jewellery shops. That, accounts for 30 per cent loss in daily business for the jewellers, Ghosh claimed.

 Welcoming the proposal for an all-party deputation, CPM parliamentarian Sudhansu Sil said: ?The mayor is offering twisted logic to evade his responsibility. He must remember that the government cannot refuse to treat malaria patients in hospitals on the grounds that CMC has failed to carry out anti-malaria drives.?

 The mayor on Wednesday reacted sharply to the criticisms, saying: ?If I have to repair the tram tracks without getting funds either from the state government or the tram company, then it will be done only over my dead body.?

 Describing the accusations levelled against him as ?politically motivated?, Mukherjee pointed out: ?His (Sil?s) CPM colleagues have failed in running the tram company. I am ready to take it over, along with all its liabilities and assets, to show them how to run it profitably. Can he start negotiations in this matter with the government??

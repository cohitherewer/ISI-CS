 Woeful widowhood

 It is common knowledge that widows in earlier times led lives of misery and servitude. Kananpishir Japamala allows the audience a glimpse into the past, to gain an insight into the melancholy lives and secret sufferings of these hapless, unfortunate women. Written by Kalyani Dutta, the play, which begins in contemporary times, initially appears to be the story of two children. They spend their time after school playing games on their computer. But one day, when the computer crashes, the children, having nothing else to occupy themselves with, start rummaging through old, discarded possessions that lay forgotten for years in the house. They find a string of prayer beads (japamala) and, on further investigation, realise that it belonged to a widowed grand-aunt. This chance discovery stirs their young minds, prompting them to raise many questions on the condition of widows in the past. Direction: Suranjana Dasgupta.

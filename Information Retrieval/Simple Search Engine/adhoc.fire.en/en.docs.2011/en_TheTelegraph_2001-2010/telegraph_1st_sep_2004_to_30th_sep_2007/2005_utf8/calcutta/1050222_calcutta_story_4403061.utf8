The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A lakh saplings to turn the city green

 - Rs 6-crore afforestation draft plan 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Dense foliage around the Maidan, roadside trees, shrubs on boulevards and pavement gardens ? Calcutta is set to become greener.

 With the state government bent on increasing the city?s green cover, the forest department has been asked to undertake its biggest ever afforestation drive ? planting a lakh saplings this year.

 The government?s intent was spelt out at a meeting chief secretary Asok Gupta held with forest officials at Writers? Buildings on February 14.

 ?We want Calcutta to be greener. Our target should be much higher than what we usually set for ourselves. You should plant as many as a lakh saplings this year,? Gupta reportedly told the officials, including forest department secretary R.K. Tripathy. The department plants around 5,000 saplings a year in the city.

 It was not just Gupta?s directive that was indicative of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s commitment towards the cause, but also the time he spent with the forest officials discussing the issue.

 ?Given his busy schedule, it was quite unusual for the chief secretary to deliberate on the topic for 90 minutes. He seemed to be very enthusiastic about the issue,? said an official, who was present at the meeting. 

 The plan on ?greening Calcutta?, which will cost around Rs 6 crore (including two-year maintenance), envisages: 

City forest on JL Nehru Road (from Manohar Das Tarag to the Park Street crossing) 

and on the Vidyasagar Setu approach (from Hastings)

Large trees (at an interval of 10 ft) along AJC Bose Road, Ballygunge Circular 

Road, APC Roy Road, Strand Road, Outram Road, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Syed Amir 

Ali Avenue, Red Road and Kidderpore Road

Ornamental shrubs/medium-sized flowering plants/herbs on boulevards and median 

islands on James Long Sarani, Hastings Road and in BBD Bag

Roadside gardens on the pavements of Ultadanga-CIT Road, AJC Bose Road, SP Mukherjee 

Road, Gariahat Road, Southern Avenue and in front of Writers? Buildings

Climbers on foot-rails and median-rails on Central Avenue and on the AJC Bose 

Road flyover 

Shrubbery under the AJC Bose Road flyover.

 ?While planning the plantation drive, we took into account all such schemes drawn up by the forest department in the previous years,? Gupta told Metro on Sunday. ?We want to lay greater emphasis on plantation. Once the forest department finalises the plan, I will call a meeting with the agencies concerned,? he added.

 In response to the officials? reservations over availability of funds, the chief secretary directed them to tap the civic body, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, the army and NGOs.

 ?If we fail to get enough support from these agencies, we?ll approach banks and other corporate sponsors,? said Rakesh Sinha, chief conservator of forests (social forestry).

 ?Evergreen trees that grow quickly and can withstand pollution ? such as mahogany, palash, sesham and tamarind ? have been shortlisted for plantation. Broad-leaved trees, like teak, which can collect dust and absorb smoke, are also on the list,? said an official.

 Flowering trees like spathodia, jacaranda and jarul, and fruit-bearing trees, too, will not be ignored. More than 16,000 saplings were planted in the city last year, of which around 5,000 were planted by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and 8,000 by the army.

 ?A survey is on to identify stretches for afforestation. We have already prepared around 30,000 saplings. Another 1.5 lakh are being raised in nurseries,? said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests (urban and recreational forestry).

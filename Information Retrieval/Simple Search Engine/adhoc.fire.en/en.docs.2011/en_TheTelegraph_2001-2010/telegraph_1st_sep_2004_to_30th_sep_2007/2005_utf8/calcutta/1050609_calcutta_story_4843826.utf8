The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Telephony treat for home users

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After tapping the enterprise market with its basic telephony services, Reliance Infocomm is now all set to enter the city?s home segment with it.

 According to the plans, drawn up at the corporate levels, the telecom major will kick off a nation-wide pilot project in the next ?six to eight weeks?, with Calcutta being one of the test-beds. The necessary tie-ups with cable operators, who will provide exchange facilities and last-mile connectivity, are in progress.

 ?We will start in 10 cities, including Calcutta, and will gradually expand it to 70 cities. Right now, we are collecting data, as it will help us in planning the pilot efficiently,? said a source in Reliance Infocomm. 

 The offering from the Reliance stable will start with telephony and then Internet facility and entertainment options will be bundled into it.

 In Calcutta, the company has identified a stretch in Dum Dum for the pilot project. 

 Reliance Infocomm plans to seed around 250 homes in the area initially ? those already having BSNL landline connections ? with its wireline phones, offering the service for free in the first few months. ?This will help us in understanding the market and fine-tune the product before the commercial release,? observed the Reliance Infocomm official.

 Pricing for the basic phone service has not been determined, but according to market sources, it will be less than BSNL rates. The company is likely to go into a revenue sharing model with local cable operators for the offering.

 ?Cable operators have a direct connection and a long-standing relationship with their consumers, which puts them in a great position to promote a service such as this,? the Reliance Infocomm source observed. 

 The company plans to tap the existing infrastructure of the cable operators to reach its service to the consumer.

 The pilot project will kick off simultaneously in Calcutta and Delhi and all the cities will be inter-linked through a fibre-optic network. 

 After basic telephony, broadband Internet and value-added services, like video-on-demand, will also be offered. The company plans to acquire around 10 million customers across the country in the next two to three years.

 ?They would have launched the services much earlier, but the ownership issues in the company deferred the project. Now the plan is final,? said an industry observer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Database click in crime fight

 PRAVEEN KUMAR, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph at his office on Wednesday to answer their queries. Participants included Ajay Pal, Arpita Banerjee, Bimal Bhattacharya, Kaushik Dey, Samir Ghosh and Sanjana Basu

Sanjana Basu: What is the extent of the jurisdiction of the North 24-Parganas police? How many police stations are there in the area?

 The area under our jurisdiction extends from Chingrihata in the south to Naihati and Bagda in the north, and from Sandeshkhali and Basirhat in the east to Garulia, near Barrackpore, in the west.The stretch encompasses an area of 4094 sq km.

 There are 36 police stations in the area, supervised by about 75 officers of the inspector rank. The total number of police officers deployed in the area is about 4,000. The headquarters is at Moyna, in Barasat, while the district police line, where the reserve forces are stationed, is at Doltala, near Madhyamgram.

Arpita Banerjee: As part of an e-governance initiative, computers have been set up at several police stations. However, one still has to file a complaint manually and get a paper receipt. How has computerisation helped police in tackling crime?

 The main objective behind setting up computers at police stations was to develop a network. We are building a database of criminals operating in the area under each police station. The information is utilised to conduct day-to-day investigation.

 Photographs of the most wanted criminals are stored in the computers. When we arrest a criminal, our first priority is to identify him. Earlier, we had to wade through files for the photograph of a criminal. Now, the entire process happens at the click of a mouse. When a police station arrests a criminal wanted at another police station, it can now easily obtain his photograph for verification. This was not possible earlier.

 Let me cite an example. Recently, a gang committed a robbery in the office of a milk marketing federation. By going through our database, we found that another gang had committed a similar robbery in a Baguiati bank around a year back. We had caught the culprits and entered their details in the database. We summoned the perpetrators of the earlier robbery and started interrogating them. The clues we obtained helped us solve the case.

 Ever since police stations got computers, it has become easier to get in touch with them when their wireless are busy. Immigration records can also be verified very easily with the help of computers.

Sanjana Basu: Urban areas like Salt Lake, semi-urban areas like Barasat and rural areas like Bagda and Basirhat fall under your jurisdiction. Given the diversity of the population, don?t you face problems in maintaining law and order?

 The socio-economic profile of the people of an area is immaterial to us while solving crimes there. However, there are problems that have become typical in some areas. For example, if teenagers of opposite sex are seen talking to each other in an urban area, people would not raise an eyebrow. If the same thing happens in a conservative rural area, police intervention might be required to maintain peace. Moreover, white-collar crime is prevalent in the urban areas, whereas violent crimes are common in rural areas.

Samir Ghosh: What do you do to keep policemen in shape? Officers with protruding bellies are a common sight, but they would definitely find it difficult to chase criminals.

 It is taken for granted that a policeman is physically fit to do the kind of work assigned to him. We organise rigorous physical training sessions for our personnel, but even then, some of our officers become overweight. It is mandatory for police officers to participate in daily drills to keep fit. But work pressure, coupled with unwillingness to follow a rigorous exercise regime, takes its toll on the officers? health. In the police lines, reserve officers undergo strenuous physical training to keep fit.

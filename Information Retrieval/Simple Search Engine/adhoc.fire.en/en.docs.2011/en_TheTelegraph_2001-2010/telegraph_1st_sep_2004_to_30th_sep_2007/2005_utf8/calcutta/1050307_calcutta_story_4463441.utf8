The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sacred but scary

 Half-past 10 in the night, a couple rides out in front of Victoria Memorial in a phaeton. Barring a few cars that whiz by, the horses? hooves couple with the neon-washed road and the darkness beyond to give an eerie feel ? just the right mood the makers of Sacred Evil want to capture on celluloid.

 Starring Sarika, the joint venture between Percept Pictures and Sahara One has its basis in a baffling real-life account by Ipsita Ray Chakraverti, recorded in her book Sacred Evil. At the centre of the story is a nun, Claudia, who seeks therapy from the wiccan when hounded by a murky past. 

 Before joining the nunnery, Claudia was a sprightly Anglo-Indian girl who resented her mixed roots and dull life in a dingy flat on Ripon Street. What she longed for was a true-blue European spouse. Life seemed right all of a sudden when a French researcher crossed her path. It was one of those moonlit evenings when the two took a ride around Victoria Memorial and set sail in a boat on the waterfront that life went awry, forever.

 ?The film focuses on the human relations in the context of the supernatural,? clarifies Abhigyan Jha, who held the reins of the production, while his brother Abhiyan took over as director.

 ?Ipsita was reluctant to give her story to anyone who didn?t know anything about wicca. We saw her conduct a healing with ancient Egyptian rituals at her Delhi home which was video-graphed and we shot the sequence exactly in the same way,? adds Abhigyan. The brothers shot almost the entire film on location in and around Calcutta ? from Free School Street to St James Church, Kidderpore to Chandernagore.

 The 110-minute-long English film tries to tie up the loose ends in Ipsita?s story, reveals Abhigyan. ?A film of this sort demands a definite ending and we have given one,? he adds.

 The narrative progresses with Sarika, who wears the wiccan?s robe and reconstructs the past, in a back and forth manner.

 ?Claudia watches a lot of English films and models herself on Western actresses. Her clothes are inspired by fashion magazines like Vogue and has the 70s look. And her mother?s persona hangs over the entire film,? says Abhigyan, who has co-written scripts for spooky serials like X-Zones, Mano Ya Na Mano and the extremely popular Tum Bin Jaoon Kahan on Zee TV.

 For the lead cast ? Scottish actress Linsay Pow plays Claudia and French actor Frederic Andrau her friend ? the Jhas scouted for artistes in the West through video-conferencing. Both Pow and Andrau began their careers on stage before appearing on screen, small and big.

 Ivan Kozelka, who called the camera shots in Ismail Merchant?s documentary on Soumitra Chatterjee, Gaach, is in charge of the cinematography.

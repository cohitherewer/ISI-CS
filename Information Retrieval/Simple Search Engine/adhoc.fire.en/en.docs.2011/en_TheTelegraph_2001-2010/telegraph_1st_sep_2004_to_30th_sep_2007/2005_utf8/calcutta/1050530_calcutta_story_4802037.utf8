 Legacy yoke of Subrata 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The next mayor will have to make a few difficult decisions soon after assuming charge. 

 Re-introduction of water tax, eviction of hawkers, curbs on jobs in the civic body and bringing colony areas under the property-tax net are the thorny issues that need to be resolved. 

 Following a roll-back of the water tax in 2004, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has been under pressure from the state government to reintroduce it.

 The withdrawal of the tax has caused the Calcutta Municipal Corporation an annual revenue loss of Rs 8 crore, even as the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority has been insisting that the civic body pay up for the filtered water from the Garden Reach waterworks.

 The mayor has also been under pressure to resume the hawker-eviction drive. Early this month, Calcutta High Court ordered the civic body to remove all encroachments from some important city roads within three months.

 Several thousand people were provided with employment in the civic body between 1985 and 2000. Mukherjee has had to ward off criticism and agitation for not providing employment to the 76 block sarkars empanelled by the municipal service commission.

 With over 2,000 posts vacant in the civic body, the next mayor will find it difficult to withstand political pressure to provide employment.

 Making 150,000 households living in apartments on colony land pay property tax is another unpopular task that the mayor-to-be will have to take on. Most of the apartments are in localities like New Alipore, Jadavpur, Picnic Garden, Dhakuria and Tollygunge.

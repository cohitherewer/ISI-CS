 WAR CRY: Top, launcher, stadium and warrior

 For more than 700 kids ? and more than an equal number of parents ? Independence Day was spent in battle. This was the battle of Beyblades, the latest boy toy pushing kids into combat mode.

 Most parents flooding Landmark on Monday afternoon and evening to cheer on their child in the first Beyblade championship in town referred to the game as a ?sophisticated lattu?. But try telling that to the little warriors armed with the spinning top inspired by the Cartoon Network animation series.

 For 240 teams of three Blade Breakers each ? all between ages six and 15 ? the spinning top (with spikes), the launcher (shaped like a space shuttle) and the stadium (plastic tray with a slope) is nothing short of an obsession.

 ?In school, we cannot play so freely and we do not have so many teams to compete with,? beamed the winning trio from La Martiniere, crowned Calcutta Beyblade Champions after six hours and several rounds of intense battle.

 While parents filled up the staircases and every available space at the Lord Sinha Road store from 2.30 pm to 9 pm, five groups of 48 teams each fought it out to make it to the 27-team finals. The Beyblade that pushed the rival top out of the ?stadium?, won the round.

 Entries were received from schools all over the city, with a solitary all-girl group and just 10 girls in all. The names of the boy gangs mirrored the mood the little ones were in. Triple Tornadoes, Demolishing Boys, Disaster in Disguise? were what they were called; streaked hair, colourful jackets and bandanas was the war gear. This was, after all, a competition of and for the Blade Breakers.

 ?As this was the first tournament of its kind in the country, Funskool did not have any format. So we asked the kids who kept on calling us about the tourney and they suggested the format to us,? said Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark.

 ?Most parents buying this toy ? priced between Rs 149 and Rs 349 ? for their children were unaware of what it was. On Monday, they saw the craze from close quarters,? smiled a spokesperson for Funskool, importers of the toy into India.

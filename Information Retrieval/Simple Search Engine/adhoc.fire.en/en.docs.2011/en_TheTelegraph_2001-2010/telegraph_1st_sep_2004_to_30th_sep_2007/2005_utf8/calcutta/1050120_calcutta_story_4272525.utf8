 No child?s play

 In an increasingly crumbling social order, the lack of family ties makes people drift apart from each other, threatening the very existence of this fundamental unit of society. It is ironical that in an age where communication holds the key, there is little interaction among members of the same family. Being staged as part of Punartaranga Utsav, Pancham Vaidics Putulkhela brings to the fore the serious problems that arise when there is a total absence of communication and understanding between husband and wife. Based on Henrik Ibsen?s A Doll?s House, the play confronts us with a couple who cannot express their true emotions and feelings for each other as they are constrained in playing out the roles pre-defined for them by society. Their inability to break free from the shackles imposed by society destroys their inner selves and also their mutual relationship. Directed by Saoli Mitra, Putulkhela raises pertinent questions that challenge the role of social conventions in determining human relationships.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Putulkhela, produced by Pancham Vaidic

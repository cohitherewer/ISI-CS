 Arrest busts sandal log export racket

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sleuths from the central revenue intelligence department have stumbled upon a racket engaged in smuggling sandalwood through the Haldia and Calcutta ports.

 According to the detectives, the sandalwood was sourced from big smugglers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and sent abroad, mainly to Nepal, through the city.

 The recent arrest of Sunil Singh while he was trying to export a sandalwood consignment, worth around Rs 3 crore, to Malaysia led the sleuths to the racket. Based in Behala, Singh used fake Customs documents to obtain export permits. He was produced in Bankshal court and remanded till September 18.

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that the 29-year-old employed youths to work as clearing agents for him. They negotiated with warehouse owners and those dealing in large containers on Singh?s behalf.

 Singh himself liaised with the smugglers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and worked out the details of fetching the consignments to the city, the cops said.

 ?After the logs reached Calcutta, generally by road, they were kept in trusted warehouses. Singh then started work on forged documents to send the sandalwood abroad,? explained an officer of revenue intelligence.

 Singh specialised in procuring fake copies of the Customs transit documents required for obtaining the mandatory Customs clearance, the officer added. Singh had claimed that the consignment with which he was caught had arrived from Raxaul, in Nepal.

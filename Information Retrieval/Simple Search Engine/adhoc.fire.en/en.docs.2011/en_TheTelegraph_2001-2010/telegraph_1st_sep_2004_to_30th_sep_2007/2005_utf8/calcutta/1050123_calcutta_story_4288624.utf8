 Thanks for writing in with your 

 computer worries. Keep the emails coming!

 Gourab Naskar: I have a HP Pavilion 8622 PC with Pentium 

 III 733 MHz processor, 128 MB SD RAM, 20 GB HDD, DirectX 

 8.1, Windows 98 (4.10, build 2222), Intel 82810 graphics 

 controller, Advance AC 97 sound card. I cannot run EA Sports 

 Cricket 2004 game which I bought. After installation, when 

 I try to run the game, it starts to load, then returns to 

 Windows. I don?t have an AGP card. 

 Cricket 2004 specification: Processor 

 500 MHz, RAM 64 MB, (128 MB for Windows XP amp; 2000), 

 Graphics 32 MB, DirectX 8.1, HDD 900 MB free space, OS Windows 

 98 SE, XP, 2000. 

 TechTalk: The integrated 

 video chipset on your motherboard is not capable of handling 

 beyond the average games. Intel 810/810e-based systems use 

 part of the system memory as video memory, instead of the 

 costly VRAM which can use higher resolution and refresh 

 rates needed for high-end games. Since you have 128 MB system 

 memory, at the most 10-12 MB video memory can be spared, 

 while you have mentioned Cricket 2004 requires 32 MB. Adding 

 more RAM would help a little. But the solution is to upgrade 

 to an AGP-based motherboard.

 Charles Huang: I have a PCS computer with Pentium III 

 500 MHz processor, 160 MB SD RAM, 6 GB HDD and PC 100 system 

 board. I can log on to the Internet and surf websites but 

 I?m unable to open the link of a webpage with Java script.

 TechTalk: You did not mention 

 anything about your web browser. Whichever browser you are 

 using, upgrade to the latest version. If it is Internet 

 Explorer, instal the latest service pack from www.microsoft. 

 com/downloads. Then, download and instal Java Runtime 

 from www.sun.com.

 Mini is the Mantra 

 The new Mac Mini and iPod 

 Shuffle at an unveiling in Seoul. Apple is targeting 

 Windows users with the Mini priced at $499. The iPod 

 Shuffle is the companys first flash-based music 

 player, at $99. (AFP)

 Farzana Alam Rahimi: My PC configuration is Pentium 

 IV, Intel motherboard, 128 MB RAM and Windows 98. I had 

 provided a password for logging on to Windows. After booting, 

 the PC asks for a password but if I press ?Esc? I can get 

 the working environment of the desktop. This means the password 

 was not given properly. How can I protect my PC from unauthorised 

 access? How can I go to system setup after booting? Also, 

 what is a webcam?

 TechTalk: The Windows 98/ME 

 password simply identifies who is logging on to a Windows 

 computer for Windows to adjust the personal desktop (and 

 a few other) settings for multiple users on the same computer. 

 This password alone is not sufficient to protect your computer, 

 and can easily be bypassed pressing the ?Esc? button or 

 clicking ?cancel?.

 To prevent others from logging 

 in MS-DOS mode and click OK. At the C:\WINDOWS prompt 

 that comes up, type ?ren win.com xyz.com? (without the inverted 

 commas) and press Enter. From now on, when anyone switches 

 on your PC, instead of Windows they?ll get an error message 

 and a C: prompt. You can load Windows typing ?xyz? and pressing 

 Enter. 

 To return to regular boot, at 

 MS-DOS mode type ?ren win.com xyz.com?, press Enter and 

 reboot.

 You can also set a boot password 

 (or ?power on password?) to make your PC prompt for the 

 password every time it boots. You can do this in the BIOS. 

 Usually, the computer tells you when you can enter the BIOS 

 (?press Del to enter setup? or in some BIOS versions you 

 have to press F1 or F2 instead of Del). Check your motherboard 

 documentation to know exactly how to set a password. You 

 can also password-protect your screen saver to keep people 

 off your PC when you leave it on while you?re away. For 

 best protection, however, use third-party encryption software 

 or upgrade to Windows XP which has built-in file encryption 

 system and better security.

 As for your last query, a webcam 

 is used to host images and live video streams over the Net. 

 It can also be used for remote surveillance systems, monitoring 

 event/places and broadcasting live events. 

 Somnath Chakraborty: I had been using Nero Express (on 

 Windows XP) before it got corrupted. I tried to remove it 

 by using Add/Remove Programs, when a message came: fatal 

 error during installation. Then I deleted all the related 

 folders from Documents and Settings and also from registry. 

 But still it appears in the list of Add/Remove Programs 

 with the Change/Remove button remaining inactive. As a result, 

 I am unable to do a fresh installation.

 TechTalk: Since you are 

 using Windows XP, you can use TweakUI PowerToy to remove 

 the program from the list of installed software. Microsoft 

 Windows PowerToys is a suite of tools, including TweakUI, 

 available for free download from the Microsoft site. Follow 

 these steps: 

 and double click on TweakUI. Click Add/Remove tab, select 

 the program you want to remove and then click Remove. Click 

 OK and close Control Panel. You can also try to edit the 

 registry by using the Registry Editor and Delete the appropriate 

 key named after Nero Express under the following registry 

 key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall. 

 You mention that you already worked 

 with the registry. Incorrect registry editing may cause 

 serious problems. To rectify, you will have to reinstal 

 your operating system.

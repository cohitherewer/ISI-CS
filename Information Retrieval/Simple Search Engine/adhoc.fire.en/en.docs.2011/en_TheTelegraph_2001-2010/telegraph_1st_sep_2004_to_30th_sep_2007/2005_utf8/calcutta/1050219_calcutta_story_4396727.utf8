 Pilots back at work on court prod 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Friday restrained the striking pilots of Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Indian Airlines, from staying away from work.

 In the evening, 15 of the pilots rejoined duty and Indian Airlines announced that normal flights of Alliance Air would resume from Saturday.

 Justice Pranab Kumar Mukherjee observed that the pilots had not served the three-month notice, mandatory for abstaining from work.

 The interim order will remain in force till March 1. The next date of hearing has been scheduled for February 24.

 Alliance Air operations to the Northeast (in all six sectors) have been disrupted since the pilots, operating the ATR fleet, reported sick en masse on February 15 to press for better wages.

 Moving a petition for Indian Airlines, advocate R.N. Majumdar told the court that the pilots were demanding salaries on a par with those flying Boeing 737s of Alliance Air.

 ?The agitating pilots fly planes that are smaller than Boeing 737s. That is why a separate pay-scale has been fixed for them by the airline,? Majumdar argued.

 He stressed that the manner in which the pilots had expressed their grievance was arbitrary and ultra vires to the Constitution. 

 ?Their act has put thousands of passengers to great inconvenience,? he submitted.

 The airline authorities have already held a few rounds of talks with the pilots to break the deadlock.

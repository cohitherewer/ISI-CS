The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bulldozer threat breaks settler ranks 

 OUR BUREAU

 As the clock ticks on the eviction deadline of March 2, the 20,000-odd residents of the 3,000 shanties along the railway tracks near Rabindra Sarobar are living in constant fear of what Wednesday will bring. 

 In December, Calcutta High Court had directed the squatters to vacate the area voluntarily by February 15. Very few families have relocated so far. 

 With local Trinamul leaders vowing to resist the joint eviction drive by the railways and police, the shanty dwellers are now in a quandary. 

 ?What will we do when the bulldozers come on Wednesday? We don?t want to be involved in political games and have started shifting our belongings quietly,? said Ajay Naskar, a tea-stall owner and one of the settlers. 

 Unwilling to take chances, around 500 families have moved their valuables elsewhere. Some of the shanties have also been vacated. 

 ?We can?t shift in the daytime because political leaders are forcing us to stay here. They refused to let us leave saying that we fight this together. But it is ultimately our houses and belongings that will be destroyed if there are clashes. Why should we suffer because some politicians will get mileage out of our misfortune?? said squatter Bipul Pramanik, an electrician. 

 The local Trinamul leaders have planned an elaborate resistance exercise. According to councillor Ratan Dey, the party workers will put up all resistance possible. 

 ?We will see the end of this at any cost. As the bulldozers approach, there will be a four-tier human barricade. Children will form the outer ring, followed by women, then aged people and lastly, the young people at the centre of the giant circle will resist the bulldozers,? said Dey.

 ?If they shoot us, we are willing to die,? the councillor added. 

 Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee has decided to await the bulldozers on the spot from Tuesday night.

 Meanwhile, 81 children in the area are appearing for Madhyamik examinations this year.

 Asked about the fate of the students, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya on Monday expressed helplessness.

 ?I think something should be done to help the candidates. However, this is a high court order which the police and civic body have to carry out. My department has nothing to do with the matter,? he said, adding that police had sought help from his department.

 The squatters, under the banner of Ballygunge?Tollygunge Rail Colony Sangram Committee, had tried to march to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s residence last week.

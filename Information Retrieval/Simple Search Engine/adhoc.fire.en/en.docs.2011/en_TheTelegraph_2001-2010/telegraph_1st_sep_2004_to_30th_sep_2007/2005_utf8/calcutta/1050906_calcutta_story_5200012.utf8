The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ditto inspiration, different intent

 Dhoop maker Ashwini Chaudhary admits that the basic plot of his new film Siskiyaan is same as that of the recently released Dansh, but also tells Pratim D. Gupta that the issues are divergent

 You are known as the Dhoop maker. But you had won the National Award for a Haryanvi film?

 Yes, it was my first film, titled Lado, which dealt with the woman?s position in a Haryanvi social set-up. It won the National Award in the best debut director category.

 Why did it take you two years post-Dhoop to make Siskiyaan?

 When you make a film like Dhoop, you get offers to make similar kinds of movies. So even after making my first film and receiving so much critical acclaim, I had to kind of struggle to get hold of a producer. Also, the subject of Siskiyaan ? set in post-riot Gujarat ? was such a sensitive issue. The Hindu-Muslim theme is such a dangerous issue here in Bollywood that producers fear problems. Finally, I got Gudduji (Dhanoa) to back the film.

 How have you used the Gujarat riots in the film?

 The story of Siskiyaan takes place one year after the Gujarat riots. It?s basically about these three characters ? a Muslim journalist Ayesha Sheikh (Neha Dhupia), her husband Javed Sheikh (Sachin Khedekar), who?s a publisher of a weekly newspaper, and a Hindu doctor (Sonu Sood). In the film, all these characters have gone through some experience during the riots and all that comes back to them.

 Is your film trying to make a political statement around the riots?

 Obviously, through these characters, I am trying to make a political statement against communalism and fundamentalism. But one thing I want to make very clear is that the stand we take in the film is in the context of Gujarat and not greater India.

 What?s Neha Dhupia doing in a film like this?

 When Gudduji agreed to produce my film, Neha Dhupia was doing the film Sheesha with his production company Rama Entertainment. So it was initially his idea to try Neha as the female protagonist. But honestly I was a little apprehensive about Neha with the kind of roles she was doing. She was anyway known for her oomph and sex appeal. Then again, I thought, it would be an unpredictable casting rather than the Urmilas and Tabus. Since I made Dhoop, mere naam ke saath ek khaas bracket, ek khaas niche aa jaata hai. What Neha?s done is brought a fresh, commercial flavour to the project.

 And you?ve got Sachin Netaji Khedekar playing a Muslim fundamentalist!

 Sachin has always been associated with sensible cinema and looks good in the role, very polished. There were no second thoughts in casting him. Same with Sonu, who was very good as Bhagat Singh (in Shaheed-e-Azam) and Yuva (as Abhishek Bachchan?s elder brother).

 The stories of Dansh and Siskiyaan are strikingly similar?

 Yes, they are. The basic plot is the same. Both films have been inspired by the Ariel Dorfman play Death and the Maiden. But now that I have seen Dansh, I am not worried. It?s set in Mizoram while mine happens in post-riot Gujarat. While I wouldn?t like to comment on Dansh, but I would certainly say that Siskiyaan tackles much larger issues and talks about women being the main victims of a riot.

 What next from Ashwini Chaudhary?

 I am starting a young campus comedy talking about our education system for Mukta Arts from November. While I do venture into commercial cinema with Siskiyaan, it?s still a hard-hitting psychological thriller. The next film will be totally mainstream, with songs and all.

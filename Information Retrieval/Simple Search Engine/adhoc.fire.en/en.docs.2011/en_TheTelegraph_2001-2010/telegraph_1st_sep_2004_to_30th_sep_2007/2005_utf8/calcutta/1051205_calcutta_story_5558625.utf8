 Parents pray for only son?s return

 An earlier picture of Rahul Khan, 11

 The Khans of Mathurbabu Lane, in Tangra, turned to prayer on Sunday as they waited desperately for their only son Rahul to return.

 The 11-year-old was last seen around 9.30 on Friday morning ? almost the same time when the residents of Behala thronged Sadhan Hari Mukherjee Road to mourn the murder of five-year-old Rick ? and has remained untraced since. The police are stumped and anxious neighbours dread the worst. 

 While Rahul?s parents have not received any ransom call, people of the neighbourhood cannot help recalling the fate of 13-year-old Hasan Iqbal, whose body was found in a septic tank in Mir Mehera Ali Lane just a few weeks ago. 

 Iqbal?s body was found five days after he disappeared.

 ?It?s killing me. Even though I know I have to put up a brave front, I just can?t take it any longer. My son can?t spend a night without us and I don?t know how he is managing now,? said Mrityunjoy Khan, before breaking down into tears. ?He is my only son. It?s been well over 72 hours and we have no clue about his whereabouts. I am prepared to do anything to get him back.?

 Last Thursday, Rahul went to his grandmother?s house close by, at 44/2, DC Dey Lane, around 10.30 am, and having spent over two hours there, returned home. 

 It was then that his mother, Deepa, pulled him up for not informing her about a parent-teacher meeting in his school ? Santi Sangha High School in Beleghata ? that was scheduled for the day soon after the declaration of the half-yearly results. The Class V student had said the meeting was on December 6.

 ?Deepa had learnt from Rahul?s friends about the meeting and when the boy returned home, she gave him a drubbing for not informing her. Since he had failed a year in Class V, all of us were worried about his studies,? said Malati Hazra, Rahul?s grandmother. ?But we would never force him to do anything since we knew he had problem retaining whatever he read,? she added.

 That night, Rahul?s father had a heart-to-heart with his son, trying to explain to him the need to study hard. 

 ?I asked him if he was not interested in studying any more. He didn?t say anything,? Mrityunjoy said.

 The next morning, Rahul changed his trousers, slipped into dark brown pants, put on a blue-and-white full-sleeve jumper and walked out of his house. 

 Police claim that boy was last seen in Gazipur, off Amta, in Howrah, on the same afternoon that he went missing. But there is no corroboration for this.

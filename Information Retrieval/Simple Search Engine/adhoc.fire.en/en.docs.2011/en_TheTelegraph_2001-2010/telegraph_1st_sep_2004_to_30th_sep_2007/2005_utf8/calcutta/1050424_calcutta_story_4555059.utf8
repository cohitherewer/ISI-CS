Life

 Fun and frolic with folks

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Dark interiors, groovy music, 

 free-flowing liquor and a packed floor. But do not be surprised 

 if you find a big family in total control of the dance floor 

 and making frequent trips to the DJ?s console for song requests.

 The dadas and the boudis have found a new haunt to let their hair down ? the nightclub. The ladies dressed in their saris or churidars and the men in their smart casuals are a regular feature now at the revelry spots.

 ?Nightclubs are fast becoming socially acceptable. They?re no longer a social taboo,? says DJ Harish of Dublin. 

 The factors drawing these families to night clubs are many. ?Families are no longer afraid of stepping into a disco. The inhibition is fast disappearing,? adds DJ Harish. 

 The profile of these families evokes much interest among the party people. ?One look at them and you can tell that they are stepping into a nightclub for the first time. The body language and the behavioural pattern is also different from the regulars at these places,? says Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO, Sourav?s.

 They are hesitant initially and make themselves comfortable in a remote corner of the place. ?The first few minutes are spent deciding over the drinks and the food,? says Mazumdar. The munch menu consists of Indian or Chinese food and the liquid list has beer, gin or vodka. ?They normally don?t drink too much and most of them leave the place by 10 pm,? he adds.

 FAMILY FUNDA

 Budget basic: Rs1,000 to Rs 1,500 per person

 First aid: Safety

 Music masti: Bollywood tracks

 Sip savour: Beer, vodka and gin

 Big bites: Indian and Chinese

Though commercial Bollywood tracks are appreciated, very few make it to the dance floor once the usual night crowd takes over.

 ?Most families come in on weeknights at around 7 pm or 8 pm and leave after having their share of fun, before the crowd comes in. Though they?re hesitant to hit the dance floor initially, once on it they throw caution to the wind,? says Anoop Ravindaran, manager of Tantra.

 The family crowd, however, is very choosy about the nightclubs it visits. Foremost on their minds is the safety factor. Places with a reputation are steered clear of.

 ?When you are coming out to party you do not want to be harassed by ruffians. We do not allow anybody who we think can create the slightest of problems,? asserts Ramnik Sabharwal, spokesperson for The Golden Park. 

 So, is the nightclub an effective base for family bonding? Nineteen-year-old Chitvan Jaipuria, who parties with his mother and sister, sure thinks so: ?Going out and partying together is a good way of spending quality time with family and friends at the place of your choice. We look for safety and good music.?

 Even celebrating a special occasion in a nightclub scores over doing the same at home or elsewhere. ?There is light and sound. The DJ is playing your favourite tracks. Food and drinks are being served. It is total hassle-free fun for the family,? feels Chitvan.

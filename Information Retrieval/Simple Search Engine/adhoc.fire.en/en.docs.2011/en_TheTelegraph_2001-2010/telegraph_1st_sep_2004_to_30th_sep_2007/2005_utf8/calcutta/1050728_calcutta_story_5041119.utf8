 Rape verdict in child court

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three years ago, when he was 16, he had abused a five-year-old. On Thursday, he will pay for it.

 Sheikh Nasiruddin has been found guilty of the crime by the juvenile court, in Salt Lake, on Tuesday. 

 ?We have established his guilt. A number of witnesses appeared before the magistrate and we submitted all evidence,? said G. Chakraborty, public prosecutor at the court.

 Reconstructing the gruesome crime, the prosecutor said Nasiruddin, a resident of Tangra, had gone to the girl?s house in the same locality on a day in March 2002. The girl?s parents were away.

 Nasiruddin asked the girl to accompany him to a closed factory of leather goods, where, he promised, he would show her something she liked. ?The child was too young to suspect Nasiruddin?s intention and followed him to the factory, close to their house,? Chakraborty said.

 Once inside the desolate factory, the teenager abused the girl for more than two hours and left her in an unconscious state. The victim returned home in the evening. Her parents were back a little later and were shocked to find her writhing in pain. 

 Grilled by them, the girl recounted what she had been through a few hours earlier. Police were soon informed. Sub-inspector of Tangra thana Prabir Saha went to the spot and recorded the statement of the girl and her parents. 

 The girl was then taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where she was treated for over a week. The report of her medical test confirmed her statement.

 During the trial, two doctors deposed as key witnesses. ?Besides, sub-inspector Saha submitted a lot of evidence. The victim also identified the culprit,? said Chakraborty.

 What could be the punishment, to be announced on Thursday? Chakraborty said: ?Law provides for rigorous imprisonment up to 10 years and a fine. But the culprit was a minor when he committed the crime, and the magistrate will keep that in mind.?

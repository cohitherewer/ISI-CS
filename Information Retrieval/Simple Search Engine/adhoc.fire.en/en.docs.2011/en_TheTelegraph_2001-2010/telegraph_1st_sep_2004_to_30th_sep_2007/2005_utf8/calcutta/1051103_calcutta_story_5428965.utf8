The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop agenda to rein in cell smut callers

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Around 5.30 pm at the Dorina crossing in Esplanade. A young, attractive woman from south Calcutta is waiting in front of a sweet shop. Five minutes later, a 21-year-old youth appears on the scene. As soon as he comes close, the woman screams and seeks help from the cops standing nearby. They take the youth to Hare Street police station.

 The woman is another victim of harassment via the mobile phone.

 Unable to put up with dirty calls, the young woman, married and with a son, decided last week to catch hold of the college-goer who had been disturbing her for the past couple of months.

 ?I did not want to give him a chance to escape. So I decided to catch him myself. I agreed to meet him and I reached the rendezvous along with my son,? she said.

 In this case, it was possible to arrest the youth because the woman herself caught him. But in other cases of harassment of women over cell phone or by SMS, the detective department has a new strategy. Police themselves are calling up the tormentors and threatening them with dire consequences if they continued to talk dirty.

 ?This is a new trend. We are being flooded with complaints from teenagers to women in their 30s. Most of the complainants say they first tried to gently impress upon the callers not to phone back. But this did not work and the calls continued throughout the day and even late at night,? said a detective department officer handling the complaints.

 Elaborating on the new strategy, another officer said: ?After going through the complainants? cell phone memory records, we found the callers were not from Calcutta alone, but even from Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad.?

 Most of the callers from Calcutta were from well-to-do families. ?If we go by the book, we will have to trace the culprits and produce them in court. Then, the accused will get bail because the section applicable to them is a bailable one,? added the officer.

 So, without taking recourse to the law, police are noting down the caller?s number from the recipient?s cell phone. Thereafter, police call up the tormentors at unearthly hours and threaten to pick them up and give them what they deserve.

 Police would also find out the tormentor?s landline number and would threaten to expose him. ?We started giving them twice as much trouble as they gave the women. We stated in no uncertain terms the consequences of sleuths going after them. It worked like magic. All of them apologised and stopped calling the complainants. We even called some of them to Lalbazar and allowed them to go after they gave a written undertaking.?

 Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said: ?Whenever you face such harassment, find out the telephone number of the callers and dial 100. Give the number to the policeman who will receive your call. We will take care of the rest.?

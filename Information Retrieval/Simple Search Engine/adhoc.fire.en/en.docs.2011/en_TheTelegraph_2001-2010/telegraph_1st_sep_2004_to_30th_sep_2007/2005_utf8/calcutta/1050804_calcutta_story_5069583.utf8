 Mother-daughter duo of Saroj and Megha Dalmia, designers at the store M amp;S, have launched yet another ethnic collection in keeping with the festivities of Rakhi. The New Alipore store has introduced a wide range of saris, salwar suits, lehngas, kaftans and even an Indo-western line. 

 Collared kurtas teamed with Patiala salwars and jackets and an ensemble called the double sari are some of the latest innovations. Long kaftans with fitting cigarette churidars, short ponchos and stylised shirts are some of the other items worth a second look. Bridal lehngas with embroidery, embellishments and intricate work are ideal for brides-to-be. 

 Theres georgette, crepe, cotton and silk, in a wide variety of colours from pastels to bright shades of red. In the fusion look, there are skirts with printed tops and mens shirts and kurtas. Bags, belts and costume jewellery have been styled to match the ensembles. We believe in modern concepts with a traditional touch, says Megha.

 While the saris cost upwards of Rs 8,000, the salwar suits and fusion gear start at Rs 2,000. The mens line begins at around Rs 500.

 Great grabs

 Its raining novelties and goodies at the Ice Skating Rink this monsoon. The Lions Club of Calcutta (Presidency) has come up with Utsav 2005, an annual exhibition-cum-sale that ends on Thursday.

 The funds raised help us to aid various charitable events like blood donation camps, health check-ups, eye operations, and support women and children in need. The exhibition this year has been organised with the aim of setting up a multi-purpose project for medical relief, explains Savita Agarwal of the organisation. 

 The range of clothes comprises tops, kurtis, salwar suits, saris, ponchos and unstitched materials. There is also a host of exclusive stone-studded bangles, earrings and neckpieces.

 Home accessories like cushion covers, rugs, dressing table mats, wooden hooks, bread baskets and table linen and jewellery boxes embellished with meena work are pretty and useful. There is also a range of rakhis and lumbas, as well as lip-smacking home-made chocolates, cakes and pickles. Prices start at Rs 2.

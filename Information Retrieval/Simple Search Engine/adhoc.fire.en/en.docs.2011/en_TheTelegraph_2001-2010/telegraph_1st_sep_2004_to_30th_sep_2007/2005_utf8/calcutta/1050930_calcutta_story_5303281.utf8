 After Chokher Bali, Rituparno Ghosh will work with the Raima-Prosenjit pair again in Khela

 First it was Bipasha Basu, then Vidya Balan. Quelling rumours of either featuring in his next film, Rituparno Ghosh has signed up Manisha Koirala. Titled Khela, the Bengali film will star Prosenjit as a film-maker and Manisha?s husband. Raima Sen joins the cast as a Delhi-based dress designer who falls in love with Prosenjit.

 Manisha, long out of arclight action, will camp in the city in November to shoot for her first Bengali film.

 Marking a departure from Rituparno?s favourite domain ? the private world of man and woman ? Khela shifts the spotlight to a child and the film-maker.

 ?There?s a rift between the director and his wife at one point over having a child. While the wife wants a kid, the man doesn?t. But while shooting for his film, the director needs to pamper a child (actor). So, there?s a love-hate kind of relationship with him,? said Prosenjit, whose film production house Ideas is involved in the project.

 ?Khela has a fantastic script. It will be something on the lines of Sonar Kella which children will enjoy very much... And Raima?s role is very interesting. She falls in love with the director but he returns to his wife,? added Prosenjit.

 Manisha Koirala

 For Raima, this will be a Rituparno hat-trick, after a stunning show in Chokher Bali and a bit role in Antarmahal. ?Rituda told me he had a role which suited me and I am very excited to work with him and Prosenjit again, after Chokher Bali. This time it will be more exciting with Manisha Koirala around. I will be shooting from November 9 to 30,? said Raima, currently busy with Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Eklavya, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan.

 Khela requires a lot of outdoors ? ?as the child is kidnapped? ? and the hilly stretch from Siliguri to Nepal and Sikkim is being thought of.

 While firming up plans for his forthcoming film, Rituparno is also scripting and searching for the right faces for Draupadi, his take on the Mahabharata that is slated to roll next year.

 His recently-shot Dosar on marital infidelity, starring Prosenjit and Konkona Sen Sharma, is in the final stages of post-production, while Antarmahal is awaiting release any time in November. 

 The period piece starring Abhishek Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, Soha Ali Khan, Rupa Ganguly and Raima went down well with the Locarno audience this August.

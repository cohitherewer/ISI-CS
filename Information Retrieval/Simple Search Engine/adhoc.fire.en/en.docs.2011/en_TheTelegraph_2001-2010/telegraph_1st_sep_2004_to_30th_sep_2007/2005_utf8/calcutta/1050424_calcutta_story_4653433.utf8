 Display dilemma 

 TechTalk

 Narasimha Murthy: I have a Compaq PC with Pentium IV 

 1.8 GHz processor, 845 GE chipset motherboard, 128 MB DDR 

 RAM and 40 GB HDD. I have a Compaq EVO D320 monitor and 

 Windows 98 Operating System. The colour setting is ?16 colours? 

 and screen area is ?640x480 pixels?. When I try to change 

 nothing happens. I have misplaced the driver CD of the motherboard. 

 Is there a remedy or should I go for a new motherboard? 

 TechTalk: You need to instal 

 the driver software for your graphics card. Don?t worry 

 if the motherboard CD is lost. Latest drivers and other 

 utility software can be downloaded for free from the hardware 

 manufacturer?s website or from sites like www.driverfind.com. 

 In your case, go to http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/CS-009236.htm, 

 download the graphics driver and software for Intel 845 

 GE chipset and instal them. Do check the Operating System 

 specifications before you download. Restart the computer 

 and your problem should be solved.

 Bharat Raimagia: I have a Pentium III 1 GHz processor 

 with 128 MB SD RAM and Windows XP Professional. For the 

 past few days, during booting, my PC hangs for three-four 

 minutes, after which everything becomes normal. When I disable 

 Norton Antivirus 2003 from MSCONFIG, the computer bots comparatively 

 quickly.

 TechTalk: Chances are that 

 some programs you installed recently are being activated 

 on startup and having a conflict with Norton Antivirus. 

 It could also be due to faulty device driver. Check the 

 startup list in MSCONFIG and disable all unnecessary items 

 by clearing the checkbox, but keep the Norton Antivirus 

 related items activated. Download and instal the latest 

 drivers for motherboard chipset, graphics and sound. Also, 

 instal the latest service pack for Windows XP Professional. 

 If the problem persists, try uninstalling and then reinstalling 

 Norton Antivirus. You can also try some other anti-virus 

 software.

 Swati Ghosh: At the time of booting, my PC displays 

 the message: ?CMOS setting is wrong. CMOS checksum is bad. 

 Press F1 to Run Setup. Press F2 to load default values and 

 continue.? When F1 is pressed, setup runs and after exiting 

 setup (without making any change) the PC boots as usual. 

 But the wrong date and time is shown in the CMOS setting. 

 When F2 is pressed, the PC boots up but desktop remains 

 blank.

 TechTalk: Most likely, 

 your motherboard battery needs to be replaced. You have 

 to open the outer casing of the CPU to do this. If you do 

 not feel confident, ask a hardware expert to do it for you.

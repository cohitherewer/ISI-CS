The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fruity pretty prints

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 The juices needn?t feel jealous of foods anymore. You could garnish a dish in a hundred different ways but what could you do with liquids of the edible kind, apart from adding insult to injury by placing a couple of innocuous mint leaves on top? This summer, however, drinks are all set to give eats solid competition, in colourful see-through clothing. 

 Before you think it to be another toy story in the making, peep into a glass pitcher and glass set pepped up with bright bold prints of juicy fruits.

 Yummy watermelons, soothing lemons, crunchy apples, exotic strawberries and kiwis, all jostle for their share of the glass space.

 Needless to say, the set is apt for serving juices. Create a stylish cocktail by serving orange juice in watermelon prints and vice versa. As the mercury climbs higher, you can opt for as many combinations as the number of prints you can fit into your crockery cabinet. 

 One can also opt for an additional ice chiller to keep inside the pitcher. The ice in the chiller would help keep the contents cool without dilution. 

 If you don?t quite fancy an elaborate set, you could also buy the components separately for a more colourful dining table conference. 

 There is a choice in getting on or off the brand wagon as well. Most of the unbranded products in this category are imported from China, but those who swear by their brands would better look out for names like Luminarc, Parka, Pasabahce and Borosil.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Just rewards, selfless feats

 A trip to Clown Town on Monday turned extra special for Utkarsh Tulsiyan (kindergarten, Birla High School), Shibangi Sarda (Class II, MB Girls Higher Secondary School) and Bismita Nath (Class III, Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan). 

 At a fun-filled ceremony, they were called on stage as the chosen three who were handed over a scholarship of Rs 50,000 each and crowned Starkids .

 The talent search, sponsored by Tata AIG Life, reached out to over four lakh children across 1,311 schools in 12 cities. The search was for India?s best all-round child talent. In Calcutta alone, the number of participating schools stood at 100. The Starkids Talent Search is an annual community initiative. This year, 36 such Starkids were identified in the age group of four to nine.

 The Children?s Day programme at DPS Megacity, Rajarhat, was a little different from the run-of-the-mill cultural extravaganzas. Parents, teachers and children participated in a panel discussion on the book Critical Triangle of Education? by Lt Cdr. (Retd) Narendra Mohan. The author moderated the talk.

 The discussion touched upon issues like teachers and parents as role models, peer and parental pressure, punishment at school and the expectations parents, teachers and students have of each other. 

 Suggestions poured in from every corner on how to make the parent-teacher-student triangle closed and mutually beneficial.

 Earlier in the day, there was a role reversal with the teachers of the school taking the stage, while the students enjoyed watching their teachers sing and dance for a change .

 St Xavier?s College (Cal) Alumni Association, along with Rotary International, celebrated Children?s Day with 30 underprivileged children of nearby slums.

 First up was a trip to the zoo. Then came the surprise gifts and chocolates. A host of fun activities, including a sit-and-draw, was arranged at the zoo. At the end of each contest, prizes were given out to the participants.

 City students came out with flying colours at TCS IT Wiz, a quiz on information technology for classes VIII to XII, held last week at GD Birla Sabhagar . Rajashri and Rijoy from St James School won the Calcutta edition of TCS IT Wiz 2005. The runner-up was the team of Anshuman and Aayush from Don Bosco, Park Circus. The audience in the packed hall cracked quite a few tough questions fired by quizmaster Giri Balasubramaniam.

 Late in the afternoon of November 14, a special treat awaited 600 underprivileged children from across the city.

 Students from government-aided primary schools and mentally-challenged children from Asha Niketan trooped into the Calcutta Boating Resort wearing red caps handed out to them. They settled down on the durries to witness a variety programme, organised by the NGO, Chip (Children In Pain). 

 The programme began with mimicry by Sunil Adak and Moumita Adak. Munching on popcorn and cake, the children enjoyed the puppet show and dance items that were next in line.

 Stage-Addict, a theatre group formed by undergraduate students, recently debuted with Not Oedipus at Gyan Manch. The play?s writer-director, Adwaita Das,

 An English (hons) student at Jadavpur University, has sent in a few lines on the experience of the cast and crew.

 Double double toil and trouble, 

 Fire burn and cauldron bubble. 

 Basic Sophocles, pinched Shakespeare ? 

 Topsy-turvied, fuzzied and clear.

 (?Scuse this rhyme-lunge at chanted flair?)

 Rape victims, lesbians, infant females ? 

 We decided to tell their tales.

 Media-society: how they hound;

 ?Unnaturals? by their judgment bound.

 Tragedy queen from tragic king.

 ?Self-indulgent!? some proclaiming.

 Verdicts passed as we trembling stood,

 The reviews bad and reviews good ? 

 (Pardon the grammar) our thought?s food.

 A gestation of three months and,

 Out we were ? a theatre band,

 The mixed success our passion fanned.

 Now we want to entertain again!

 Let?s see, when shall we meet you then,

 In thunder lightening or in rain?

 When Christmas is over and gone,

 After the New Year?s showed its dawn?

 Maybe ere the set of January sun.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Last call to vacate Lakes

 - Process of ousting squatters by November 30 begins

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The process of evicting squatters along the Dhakuria Lakes (Rabindra Sarobar) began on Monday, with railway officers spending the day at Lake police station, waiting for people to leave on their own.

 Though nobody turned up, the officers will camp at the police station every day between 10 am and 2 pm, till November 10. 

 ?Measures are being taken according to the high court guidelines. If any settler surrenders within the court-stipulated time, railway officers at the police station will first verify his claim and visit the spot he has vacated. After confirmation, they will hand over a certificate to him,? explained Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 From October 10, police started requesting the settlers over a public address system to remove their belongings by November 10. 

 The general manager of Eastern Railway held a meeting with the officers of the Government Railway Police, Calcutta Police, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and CESC to decide on a course of action.

 A senior police officer said: ?In keeping with the judgment, we will not touch the structures till the stipulated date (November 10). If the settlers do not pay any heed to our plea, we may carry out the high court order on any day from November 11 to November 30, the last date for us. 

 He pointed out: ?The court clearly directed us to clear the debris within December 7 and submit a detailed report on December 9 before the division bench of the high court, presided over by Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar.?

 According to senior officers at Lalbazar, they will be compelled to clean up the land along the Sarobar this time. ?We failed to carry out the drive twice. Last time, it was on April 2. We could not initiate action anticipating bloodshed and disturbance that may spread across the city. This time, we have no choice,? they said.

 The first order to evict the squatters was passed in December 2001 after environment activist Subhas Dutta moved a petition in the high court in 1997, demanding development of Rabindra Sarobar. 

 The Calcutta Improvement Trust, which looks after the waterbody, alleged in court that the squatters were polluting the Sarobar. The squatters moved the apex court, which upheld the high court order and directed their ouster.

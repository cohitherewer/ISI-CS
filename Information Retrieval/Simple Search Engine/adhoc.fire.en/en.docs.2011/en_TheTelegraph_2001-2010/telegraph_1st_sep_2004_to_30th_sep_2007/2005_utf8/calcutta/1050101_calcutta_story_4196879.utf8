The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bye-bye 2004, with air most foul 

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 2004 has left in its wake an alarming rise in the poison content of the city?s air.

 According to the findings of West Bengal Pollution Control Board, the winter air has seen a sharp rise in suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (RPM), which are slow poison for humans. 

 On December 31, the SPM and RPM levels had been recorded at 409.75 and 264.75 microgram per metre cube, more than double the permissible limits of 200 and 100. 

 On December 31, 2003, the corresponding figures had been 365.25 and 203.

 ?The SPM and RPM content has increased sharply during winter, compared to last year,? pollution control board member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar told Metro on Friday.

 ?Though the annual average of the SPM and RPM content has been on a decline, the levels are increasing during winter. The situation will soon spin out of control if we fail to take effective steps immediately,? he added. 

 Board scientists have attributed the steep rise in the poison level to auto emission, burning of bio-mass and coal, and the presence of road dust.

 ?There is no sign of any reduction in auto emission and burning of cowdung cakes, dry leaves and coal. And, no effective step is being taken to keep the city roads free from dust,? pointed out a board official.

 Pollutants in the winter air tend to cluster at low altitude and hence, people are more at risk of inhaling them in winter than in any other season. 

 The effect, scientists pointed out, can be felt in any hospital or clinic. Maximum number of patients, from infants to the aged, with bronchial diseases turn up during winter than in any other time of the year. 

 As per the report of the pollution control board, the most polluted pocket on December 31 was Moulali, where the SPM and RPM levels were 441 and 296 (more than double the permissible limits).

 The second most polluted spot was Behala (the SPM and RPM were 422 and 276), followed by Topsia (SPM: 420 and RPM:267) and Salt Lake (SPM:356 and RPM:220).

 ?For the sake of the Calcuttan?s health, the government should ensure that the New Year doesn?t see a repeat of 2004. The average levels of the SPM and RPM must be brought down by at least 25 per cent,? said environmentalist Subhas Dutta.

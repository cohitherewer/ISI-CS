 Determined to make oil companies open more LPG dispensing outlets in the city and suburbs, the state government has decided to provide them with space in the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) depots. 

 ?We have to motivate oil companies to start more LPG-dispensing outlets in the city. We will have to popularise green fuel to control air pollution,? transport minister Subhas Chakraborty told a CSTC board meeting, convened at the corporation?s Ganesh Chandra Avenue headquarters last week. 

 The minister reportedly expressed concern that the leading oil companies had so far set up only seven LPG dispensing outlets, against the 16 they had promised. At a meeting with senior officials from oil companies at Writers? Buildings last month, Chakraborty had urged them to set up more such units. 

 The oil companies feel that the seven outlets are enough to fuel the current fleet of LPG-run vehicles. 

 ?We have stopped short of opening more LPG outlets in the city as they have no takers,? said A.C. Dey, deputy general manager (LPG) of Indian Oil Company (IOC).

 ?In fact, the seven outlets have the capacity of supplying 630 metric tonnes of gas per month. The monthly sales have never gone beyond 60 metric tonnes. Why should we open more LPG outlets?? he asked.

 Dey added that the oil companies have no problem in starting LPG outlets in large numbers, provided that they get ?free land and other benefits from the government?. 

 It has been decided that the CSTC will allot 20mx20m space to all four oil companies in its seven depots for setting up LPG dispensing units.

 While IOC will set up units at the Maniktala and Purbasha depots, BPCL will start outlets at Kasba and Barasat, while HPCL will set up LPG dispensing stations at the Thakurpukur and Howrah depots. 

 ?We shall earmark the land in our depots and inform the oil companies by June 10, so that they can complete the work within six months, with clearance from the Central controller of explosives,? CSTC managing director Ashoke Bhattacharya said.

 According to him, the CSTC will bear 50 per cent of the construction cost, but the amount will have to be realised by way of commission from the sale of fuel.

 Rustic riot in urban hub

 Stadel, the hotel on the Salt Lake stadium campus, turned a year older this month, and a three-day celebration culminated in a rural fair on the lawns on Sunday. It took the form of the Kingfisher Sunday Night Bazaar, which takes place in major cities across the country. A year ago, the venue shifted to Stadel.

 ?The open area here has added that rustic touch to the event,? says Anil Bhutoria, owner of the hotel.

 As families trooped in for an evening of fun uninterrupted, they got a chance to consult a palmist, pick up small handicrafts and dig into yummy chaats. The concept drew a group of foreign tourists as well, who wanted to sample a taste of rural India. Sitting on a charpoy, they smoked hookah and dug into authentic Indian food. For those who wanted to tune into some music while sipping beer, the in-house live band provided enough reason to cheer.

 Southern spice

 This is not the ideal season to try hot and spicy food but the cool environs of The Eden Pavilion at ITC Sonar Bangla make the ongoing Chettinad food fest at the venue worth a different try. 

 Gaze at the trickling waterbodies outside as you savour South Indian delicacies like the Vazhaipoo Avarai Poriyal and Pumpkin Avial. A simple but delectable dish, it represents the synergy of locally grown spices like coriander, cumin, pepper, fenugreek, aniseed and sweet stick that are ground and added judiciously to a typical Chettinad dish. 

 Then there is Vengaya Kari, a mutton dish made magical simply with turmeric, green chillies and shallots, besides Pollachi Yeral Thandu Poriyal, a banana stem preparation that melds beautifully with coconut and prawns. 

 There are times when one looks for the high point of a meal but here the reverse is true. The Ellu Roti at best can be touted as a health food. Surul Paniyaram among the desserts too belongs to this list. The rest, from Kaima Biryani, Thoothu Valai (a herb) Rasam to Kariveppilai chutney with Ellu Kara Dosai strike a balanced note. 

 The meal (lunch or dinner) comes at Rs 650 plus taxes, and will be available at the 24-hour coffee shop from 12.30 pm to 2.45 pm and from 7.30 pm to 11.45 pm.

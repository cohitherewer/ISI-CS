 It was a party to see and be seen at. Thursday night at the Pala, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, was overflowing with Calcuttas celebrity brigade. 

 From Soumitra Chatterjee to Debasree Roy, P.K. Banerjee to Bhaichung Bhutia, Nabaneeta Dev Sen to Sunil Gangopadhyay, Harsh and Madhu Neotia to Arjun and Nilanjana Chakraborty, Sharbari Dutta to Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Alokananda Ghosh to the daughters of PC Sorcar (Jr), ...

 They were all there and more. The occasion was a cocktail and dinner party hosted by Sanjay Budhia, honorary consul of Malaysia. As the drinks flowed, the chatter and the laughter grew louder.

 On the menu was a variety of Malaysian delicacies. And the guests chowed down on the sumptuous vegetarian buffet spread, which included dosas served up at the live counter.

 Design dozen

 Sourav Gangulys XI is struggling to break the final jinx abroad, and back home at Souravs, a team of 12 is gearing up for a final showdown on September 30.

 The second leg of the designer hunt, which involves a dozen designers from all over the city, took place at the Prince of Cal on Friday evening. The star attraction at the lounge bar of Souravs: The Food Pavilion was singer Babul Supriyo, in town to promote his second album Kuch Aisa Lagta Hai.

 I like wearing good clothes and the clothes that are in vogue. But judging a fashion show is something I have never done. I hope my judgment goes in favour of the deserving candidate, said the Bollywood singer, flanked by fellow judges Piu and Sonali.

 The three designers vying for a place in the finals were Neetu Bhura, Seema Saraf and Indrani Biswas. Their Indo-Western fare was judged on the usage of fabrics, craftsmanship, freshness of designs and sense of colour.

 Indrani Biswas stole the show ? and a berth in the final ? with her saris, ghagras and salwars.

 Gone are the days when gumboots were the only solution to combat puddles, mud and water in the monsoons. Now, keep it stylish even on days when it rains cats and dogs. Footwear company Khadims unveiled a brand new range of Wash and Wear shoes on Wednesday at its Lindsay Street showroom.

 The Wash and Wear range was launched by Khadims in 2002. Last year the range sold very well and registered a growth of more than eight per cent. Originally developed for monsoon and beach wear, the PVC footwear is used by consumers all through. Some are also used to prevent corns, explains Joydeep Basu Roy, senior brand manager, Khadims.

 The shoes come in shades of black, brown and beige. The mens category boasts three new inclusions this season, with floaters, slip-ons and office shoes on offer. For women, two new designs provide ethnic and western style alternatives.

 Comfort, safety, durability and a new-look despite getting drenched are the plus points being used to pitch the product. The mens range is between Rs 100 and Rs 120, while the womens options are between Rs 78 and Rs 101. The product is available at all Khadims showrooms and a number of multi-brand outlets across the city.

 Fresh petition by axed quota bloc

 - Plea seeks course option, demands damages

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Thursday admitted a public interest litigation seeking an alternative arrangement for the 69 MBBS students, whose admission under the NRI/NRI-sponsored quota had been cancelled on a Supreme Court order.

 A division bench, headed by Justice Altamas Kabir, asked petitioners? lawyer Idris Ali to serve a notice on the state government. In the evening, Ali said the notice had been served on the additional government pleader.

 The petition, filed by the All India Minority Forum, put the entire blame on the state government for the situation the 69 students find themselves in. 

 Instead of making alternative arrangements for the victims, the government is busy hiding its goof-up, the petition alleged.

 Counsel Ali prayed for an order asking the government to make alternative arrangements for the students, as well a payment of compensation to them. ?A group of youths cannot suffer because of the government?s wrong policy,? he argued. 

 He pleaded with the bench to admit the case, as public interest was involved in it.

 The students had studied five months of the current academic session at SSKM Hospital and Midnapore Medical College.

 Two days ago, a division bench of the Supreme Court had turned down their plea that the Bengal government be asked to admit them to other medical colleges of the state. 

 The apex court, however, ruled that the students could approach a higher bench. The hearing by the higher bench will take place within a few months.

 The bench has been constituted to dispose of cases on the legality of government quota in various courses conducted by the states.

 The case in the high court will come up for further hearing on Friday.

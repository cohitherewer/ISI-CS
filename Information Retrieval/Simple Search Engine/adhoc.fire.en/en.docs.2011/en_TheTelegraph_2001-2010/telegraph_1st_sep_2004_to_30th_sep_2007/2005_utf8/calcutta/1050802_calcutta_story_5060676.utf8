 Howrah drive to blot out bad blood

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 As part of a project aimed at countering the spread of thalassaemia in Howrah, the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), with support from the local administration, has made arrangements for carrying out blood tests of schoolchildren at a low cost.

 Nandini Chakravorty, district magistrate of Howrah, said: ?In most cases, children die of this disease because their parents are too poor to continue the treatment. So, we are trying to help the children as much as possible.?

 A thalassaemic requires around Rs 1 lakh every year for treatment alone.

 Under the IRCS scheme, blood tests to detect thalassaemia will be carried out among schoolchildren at Rs 20 each. The same test costs around Rs 300, or more in some cases, in government and private hospitals. ?The tests will reveal whether or not the children are thalassaemia carriers,? Chakravorty added.

 ?Already, blood samples of about 250 students, of Classes IX to XII, from three schools in Howrah town have been tested by the thalassaemia treatment and detection centre run by IRCS,? said Jayanta Mukherjee, organiser of the centre and a member of the society.

 ?We are getting a massive response,? district magistrate Chakravorty said, adding that an awareness campaign will be launched soon, funds for which will be sought from sponsors.

 ?Awareness is the only way to muzzle the disease,? says haematologist Sharmila Chandra. ?Thalassaemia carriers usually lead a normal life. But if two carriers marry, in 25 per cent cases, the offspring is a thalassaemia patient and in 50 per cent cases, the child is a carrier of the disease.?

 And this is the message that the awareness drive will stress on. ?Through the campaigns we can pass on the word that pre-marriage blood tests of the bride and groom can rule out the possibility of the child being a thalassaemic or a carrier,? Chandra said.

 In Howrah, four to six per cent of the population is carrier of this disease, said Reena Das, secretary, Howrah IRCS

 ?Already, about 200 patients are availing of the facilities at our treatment and detection centre at Panchanantala, which was set up in January 2004,? she added.

 Das said the state government is also extending its support to the society. ?Minister of state for health and family welfare Pratyush Mukherjee helped us get a steady supply of blood for patients who need two to four blood transfusions every month,? she said.

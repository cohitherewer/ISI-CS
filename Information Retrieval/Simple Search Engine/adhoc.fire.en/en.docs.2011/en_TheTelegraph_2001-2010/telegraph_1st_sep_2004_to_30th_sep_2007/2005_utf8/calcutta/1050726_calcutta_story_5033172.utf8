Population problems

 Unbelievable though true, the world?s population in the year 1900 was less than 2 billion, in 1950 it was 2.5 billion, the turn of the century saw the figure rising to a whopping 6 billion and the projected figure for 2050 is 9 billion. The contribution of China in this explosion is 130 million (approximately) and India is fast catching up with nearly 110 million as of today. In 1950, 30 per cent of the planet?s people lived in cities, while it was 50:50 in 2000. The situation is likely to reverse in 2030, with 70 per cent urban and 30 per cent rural. 

 Considering the fact that the resources are limited and are exploited extensively, depleting them at a fast rate, this is a crisis situation. To say it is a massive problem is an understatement. It calls for a global concerted effort. To draw the attention of school students to this problem, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum observed World Population Day on July 11 with a variety of programmes. There was a slogan writing competition (in Hindi, English and Bengali) for Classes IX and X, and a sit-and-draw contest for Class I to VIII (in three levels). 

 A total of 492 students accompanied by 112 teachers from 28 schools participated in the programmes and took back with them some idea to act in future to mitigate the situation. The winner in the slogan writing competition was Ankita Saraf of Mahadevi Birla, while the top honour for the sit-and-draw in the junior level went to Priyanka Sarkar of Loreto Day School (Sealdah), the middle level to Arnab Ray of Salt Lake School (CA) and the senior level to Sanchari Saha, St Paul?s Mission School.

 Season of celebration

 South Point celebrated its annual day function earlier this month at Science City auditorium. At the prize distribution ceremony, the top ten students of each class as well as the toppers of individual subjects from Classes II to VIII were awarded. Derozio House came out with flying colours, winning the champion?s trophy in the high school section and the runner-up in the junior section. Tagore House won the junior category, while Nivedita House finished second in the high school section. 

 The Magic of Love was a show with a message put up by the students. Scripted by Anjana Sen, produced and directed by Tamali Ghosh and choreographed by Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop, it portrayed how nature helps people in their fight against evil, and suggested that if you respect and take care of nature, it will ultimately take care of you.

 By The Children, For the World was another innovative presentation by the students. It included John Lennon?s Imagine, songs by Simon and Garfunkel and Michael Jackson, poems of Rabindranath Tagore and Pablo Neruda. Dana Roy was the choreographer. Biswajit Sarkar helped the students in their efforts.

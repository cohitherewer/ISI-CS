 Eina Ahluwalia?s Breathing Space is a designer brand of jewellery that is all about colours, tradition and creativity. Each piece moulded on sterling silver is unique with traditional influences from various regions of the country fused with contemporary styles.

 The collection is divided into the rocks, atlantis, contemporary, traditional and antique themes. A variety of semi-precious stones binds them. One can spot everything from the commonly used amethyst, peridot, citrine, garnet, smoky topaz and rainbow moonstone to the little known chalcedony, wood jasper, rhodocrosite, tiger iron, black star, dalmention, leopard skin obsidion and snowflake jasper. 

 ?This collection depicts the many facets of life,? says Eina. A lolite pendant in the contemporary range, for example, depicts life as a mesh of people connected to one another, according to the designer, while a multi-coloured and multi-faceted ring shows humanity as a crowd with each person standing out and shining bright.

 The antique collection comprises tribal neckpieces, earrings and bangles dating back to the 1920s, bits and pieces of which have been collected during various trips undertaken by the designer. 

 The summer collection contains a lot of pastel colours, semi-precious stones, pearls, curves and poker straight lines in plain silver. The designs are very Zen and minimalistic. Chandelier earrings a la the Oscars stand out in the range. 

 Needless to say, the pieces can be worn with both ethnic and western ensembles. 

 Prices start at Rs 200.

 Vegas vroom

 ?What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas? was clearly drowned in Saturday night?s performance by Harley Davidson girls Melinda and Carrie, who rocked the bartop at Tantra. 

 The well-known restaurant ? Harley Davidson Caf? ? based on the bike, of course, is a huge tourist attraction in Las Vegas, complete with showgirls, music and a 50,000 lb motorcycle bursting out of its fa?ade on to the strip. 

 While Melinda was the funky hip-hop girl, Carrie enthralled all with her graceful belly-dancing moves. Both wowed the crowd with several bartending tricks as well.

 The outfits changed with each sequence, leather and lace being the binding force.

 A desi touch was also in store when the girls tried some bhangra moves at the end of it all.

 Console queen

 From turning the tables to striding the stage, her long legs have covered some distance.

 She started disc jockeying more out of passion for dance and music but her stint with modelling was more under duress, revealed Megha Kawale, the music maker from Mumbai who was in Shisha on Friday night.

 ?A woman is subjected to more scrutiny and criticism compared to her male counterparts. Very few people want competition from a girl,? said Megha, who took to the turntables six years ago. She has been the resident DJ of 1900s in Taj Mahal Hotel and Mikanos Club in Mumbai.

 ?I love to play house but I guess Bollywood tracks are a universal favourite all over the country. So I never try to impose my choice on the people,? says Megha. 

 When she is not busy mixing tracks, she can be spotted on the ramp.

 ?Modelling came much after I started disc jockeying. Given my height and figure, all my folks practically forced me into modelling,? chuckled Megha.

 Walk in for a bottle of phenyl, walk out after booking a dream flat.

 Until now, footfall in malls has been linked to a motley basket, comprising apparel, movies, food, grocery, jewellery, shoes, accessories, household items? Come March, and Calcuttans can even seal a deal for a coveted home while shopping in a hypermart.

 Signalling its arrival in Calcutta with a novel product linking retail with realty, Chesterton Meghraj, the first international property consultant to set up a fully operational office in town, is launching a shop-in-shop solution for home buying.

 Called the Home Shoppe, this permanent stall, to be housed within the Big Bazaar outlet anchoring Metropolis, the mall in Hiland Park, will showcase a wide range of upcoming and under-construction residential stock in Calcutta and Rajarhat, with price tags of Rs 10 lakh-plus. There will also be a home-loan counter to facilitate financing. ?We want to create a one-stop solution for the customer to make house-hunting easy and convenient,? says Abhijit Das, head of Chesterton Meghraj?s eastern operations.

 The company, which has a similar format running ?very successfully? in the Big Bazaars of Delhi and Mumbai, envisages a lot of resale transactions through the Home Shoppe. It will introduce the concept at the VIP Road Big Bazaar shortly.

 The coming of Chesterton Meghraj to Calcutta is a reaffirmation of the retail and real estate potential the city now holds out. Incorporated in India in 1995, it is a venture of Chesterton International Plc and Meghraj Group of the UK, with offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad. Chesterton International Plc has a strategic alliance with Blumeneuer Immobilien of Germany and Binswanger International of the US and a worldwide presence, with over 127 offices across North America, South America, Europe, West Asia, East Asia, Africa and Australia.

 The company provides specialised retail and commercial agency services, advisory services, facility management and project management services. In Calcutta, Chesterton Meghraj was responsible for bringing leading retail brands to Forum, City Centre and Metropolis and doing facility management for these malls.

 ?While these activities had been concluded by our Mumbai and Delhi offices, we are currently working on consulting projects after setting up shop in Calcutta. These involve best-use options of land, commercial and financial feasibility of proposed townships and retail projects for some very large developers,? says Das, promising a lot more action in the future.

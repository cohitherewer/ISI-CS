 Italy unplugged

Smita Roy Chowdhury unearths the 

culinary secrets of The Hub the citys only round-the-clock speciality 

restaurant

A ?round-the-clock informal Italian eatery? is how 

executive chef of Taj Bengal Surinder Singh likes to describe The Hub. And he 

emphasises the ?informal? factor being the USP of the plush 102-seater restaurant. 

?People often refer to The Hub as a coffee shop, but it?s not. It?s a 24-hour 

eatery serving authentic Italian food in an informal setting. Most Italian restaurants, 

all over the country, are very formal,? says Singh.

 Italian food is gaining prominence all over the world and Singh attributes this to the diversity of the cuisine, which makes it acceptable to most tastes. 

 While food from north Italy is comparatively bland, the south throws up spicy and hot flavours with the extensive use of Pepperoncini chilli and fresh crushed black pepper. ?Italian food has gone down quite well with Calcuttans and it?s becoming a popular choice while eating out,? the chef feels.

 While pizzas and pastas are obviously synonymous with the cuisine, another item that?s emerging as a favourite the world over is the Tiramisu, the classic Italian dessert. ?Having cheese separately after an Italian meal is also becoming a popular practice,? says Singh.

 Fresh and quality ingredients, the chef says, do 50 

per cent of the trick in Italian cooking. Good quality pasta, risotto, olive oil, 

tomatoes and cheese are the trump cards. The restaurant imports all of these from 

various parts of Italy.

 An amazing variety of cheese, the backbone of Italian cuisine, makes its way to the kitchen straight from Italy. The most widely used ones are Grano Padano (an Italian parmesan cheese that finds maximum use), Mozzarella (both cow and buffalo varieties), Ricotta (a soft cheese made with cow milk), Feta (a semi-soft goat cheese) and soft goat cheese. The other varieties include Brie, Scarmozoa, Smoked Scarmozoa, Twin Mozzarella, Gorgonzola and Mascarpone (a special one used in Tiramisu). Soft cheese has a shelf life of 15 days, while the hard ones can be stored up to a month.

 In the grocery section, the pastas, risottos, olive oil, balsemic vinegar, porchini mushrooms, Illy beans (used for espresso and cappuccino coffees), canned fruits like blueberry, strawberry, passion fruit and wild berry for desserts and canned Palatti tomatoes (a special variety used widely in the cuisine) are sourced from Italy. For other important vegetables like bellpepper, broccoli, zuchini, brussel sprouts, aubergines, curly endives, red endives and Romane, the restaurant depends on fresh supplies from Ooty and Mahabaleswar. Essential herbs like basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano and parsley are also sourced from there.

Fishes like salmon (both smoked and regular), cod 

and red snapper are imported from various parts of Europe, while the rest like 

prawn, lobster, bekti, mussels and clamps are sourced locally. Some meats like 

lamb chops and corn-fed chicken are also imported. The delicatessen section is 

totally dependant on supplies from overseas. So the Pharma ham comes from Pharma 

in Italy while other varieties like Black Forest ham, Mortadella, Pepperoni and 

Honey-glazed ham are imported from other parts.

 Offering exotic Italian flavours in the huge a la carte section round the clock, running a lunch buffet with a different menu on each day of the week, plus dishing out Indian and tandoori delicacies for breakfast and post-midnight hours might seem a difficult task. But the kitchen at The Hub, divided into various sections, runs like clockwork. 

 The Cold section deals with sandwiches, salads, antipastis and cold beverages. A separate section takes care of the desserts. There are two teams dishing out vegetarian and non-vegetarian Italian fare. Three different sections prepare Indian veg, non-veg and tandoor. And yet another section, part of the live kitchen inside the restaurant, prepares the pizzas and pastas. The staff come and go in three shifts, 24X7.

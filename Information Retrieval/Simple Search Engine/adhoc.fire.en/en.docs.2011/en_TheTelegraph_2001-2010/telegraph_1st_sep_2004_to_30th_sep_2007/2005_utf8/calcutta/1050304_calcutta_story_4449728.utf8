 Death after fidelity row

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Paritosh Das, 35, a security guard with a private agency, killed wife Shila, 30, on Wednesday night, suspecting she was involved in an extra-marital affair.

 He hit her with a bamboo at their home in Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city, following a quarrel. 

 Neighbours rushed her to a local hospital, where doctors declared her dead.

 After his arrest, Das confessed to his crime, according to Manoj Verma, additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore, on Thursday.

 Das, who was posted at the Barasat branch of the youth welfare department, had married Shila around a year ago. They stayed at Subhasnagar, Nilgunge.

 Neighbours said that initially, there was no trouble between the couple. Das?s parents did not stay with them.

 Problems arose after Das started suspecting that his wife was being unfaithful.

 ?The situation worsened after Shila gave birth to a girl only six months after their marriage,? Verma said. Das refused to accept that the child was his.

 Their quarrels often would take a violent turn and Das had beaten up his wife a number of times, the neighbours said. Shila, however, had never lodged a complaint with police. Initially, the neighbours would intervene and restore peace.

 ?The neighbours even held meetings with the couple and their families to sort out the issue. Their efforts went in vain,? a police officer said.

 Around 10 on Wednesday night, the couple started quarrelling. Since fights between them were common, the neighbours did not pay much heed.

 But it soon turned serious and Das started beating up his wife. He ran out of his room, picked up a bamboo and started hitting Shila with it, neighbours recounted.

 Shila tried to flee, but Das continued hitting her until she collapsed on the ground, they added.

 The neighbours could not respond to Shila?s cries for help as the main entrance of the house was locked. They later broke the lock to enter the house.

 They found Shila in a pool of blood and Das sitting by her side, with the bamboo beside him. They immediately rushed Shila to hospital. 

 Das did not have any criminal background, police officers said.

 He was arrested and produced in the Barasat sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court, where he was remanded in police custody for seven days.

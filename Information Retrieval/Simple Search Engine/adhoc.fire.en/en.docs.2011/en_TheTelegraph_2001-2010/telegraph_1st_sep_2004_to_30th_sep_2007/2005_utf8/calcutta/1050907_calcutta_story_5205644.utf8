The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talks fail to reopen campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A second round of talks on Tuesday between students and the authorities of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) failed to resolve the campus crisis. 

 Accompanied by institute director Abhay Srivastava, film-maker and SRFTI governing council chairman Basu Chatterjee dropped by in the morning for a meeting with the agitating group of students. 

 ?The chairman said he would convene a governing council meeting if we called off the strike. But we stuck to our ground and told him that we will call it off only after the meeting,? said an SRFTI student.

 A governing council meeting ? where some 150 students will put forth their grievances relating to academic and financial malfunctioning ? had been tentatively slated for September 12, but on Tuesday, Chatterjee hinted that it could be held any day before September 17.

 ?The chairman is looking into the matter. We are trying to have a meeting provided all the faculty buildings are opened. This is our stance but we can work around it. All the council members have been informed of the meeting and they will get back to me on Wednesday,? director Srivastava told Metro.

 The administrative wing of the main building remained open on Tuesday, but no official work took place, with the non-teaching staff staying away.

 For Steve Waugh, charity and business both begin at his second home ? Calcutta.

 On Friday morning, the former Australian skipper led a business delegation to Writers? Buildings, armed with plans to start a business venture in his beloved city. 

 He was accompanied by officials of an Australian bank, with which he is associated, and members of the Australian High Commission.

 After a 40-minute meeting with chief secretary Asok Gupta, Waugh said: ?Calcutta is another home for me. A lot of development has taken place here in the past two years. There are a lot of business opportunities in Calcutta. It will be easier starting something here than in any other city.? 

 The former inspirational leader of the invincible Aussies said he has also initiated talks with the Maharashtra and Karnataka governments for investments in the social sector and infrastructure development.

 Gupta later said the Australian delegation wanted to concentrate on building townships and hospitals in and around the city.

 ?The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is undertaking many projects in the vicinity of the city. I have asked the Australians to meet CMDA officials tomorrow,? Gupta said.

 Waugh has always been passionately involved with this city and is a principal patron of Udayan, a special home for children of leprosy victims located in Barrackpore, on the outskirts of Calcutta. He is also thinking of setting up a school for visually-impaired girls in the city.

 This could, however, be the beginning of an entirely new innings for the ex-skipper, as he takes fresh guard on what has virtually become his home turf now. 

 Chief secretary Gupta has assured the Australian team of all co-operation and logistics support to carry the initiative forward.

 Asked where the projects would be located, Gupta said Rajarhat New Town could be an option.

 ?They came to the city via the New Town and are very impressed by what they have seen. We will also arrange for them to meet officials of the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco),? Gupta added.

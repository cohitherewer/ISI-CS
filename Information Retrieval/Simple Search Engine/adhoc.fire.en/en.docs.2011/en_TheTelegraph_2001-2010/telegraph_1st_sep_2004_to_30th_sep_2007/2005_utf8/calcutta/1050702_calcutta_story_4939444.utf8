The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Arrest in midnight hit ?n? rob 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Subir Sardar, alias Minku, in his mid-20s, was arrested in connection with the stalking, assault and subsequent snatching of valuables from a couple at gunpoint on the midnight of June 23.

 Sardar was one of the trio that attacked Subir Mitra, a senior executive of a private firm, and his wife on Palit Street, in south Calcutta. 

 The accused is a Group D employee of a prominent English-medium school in south Calcutta. He was picked up from his residence in Entally. 

 Police recovered the handbag, which was snatched from Mitra?s wife, from Sardar. 

 ?We have found the couple?s cell phone. The camera kept in the bag is yet to be recovered,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department, adding: ?Mitra identified the articles we recovered from Sardar?s possession.?

 Mitra and his wife were driving back home around midnight after attending a dinner. Soon after taking a turn into Palit Street, off Maddox Square, Mitra noticed a motorcycle approaching the car. Mitra gave the two-wheeler room enough to pass by. But the motorcycle trailed the car.

 Alarmed, Mitra drove the car into the garage he parked in every night and as he and his wife were getting off, the three young men stopped the couple. 

 When the Mitras tried to resist the youths, they first fired a shot. The bullet hit the pavement. Then they attacked the Mitras with a dagger. Both Mitra and his wife received injuries on their hands.

 Sardar told police that his accomplices had both been convicted earlier in a dacoity case. A hunt is on to track down the two.

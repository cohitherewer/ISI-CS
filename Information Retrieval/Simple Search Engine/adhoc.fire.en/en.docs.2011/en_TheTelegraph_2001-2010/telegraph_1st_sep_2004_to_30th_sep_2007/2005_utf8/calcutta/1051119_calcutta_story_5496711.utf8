 Setting sail on troubled turf

 Tossing on the waves of controversy, Kallol finally anchored at the hastily-created structures on the Yuba Bharati Krirangan turf. But not many among the 50,000-odd viewers at the November 14 (and again on November 15) show returned satisfied.

 Though some in the rows up ahead said ?just seeing the giant ship under the open sky and a full moon was a different experience? (and the crossfire of dialogues did briefly transport us back in time), those from the galleries grumbled they weren?t able to catch a word and could barely spot the actors.

 To many, Kallol, presented by the state department of youth welfare, was a king-sized farce amounting to more than Rs 25 lakh. Senior actor Shobha Sen ? and Utpal Dutt?s widow ? summed it up by stating that PLT?s Kallol and its latest avatar ?stand no comparison?.

 But like it or not, Kallol seems to have thrown up fresh possibilities for theatre in Bengal. Raising questions as to just how possible it is to present proscenium plays (or for that matter any play) before audiences of 30,000 or more. 

 Just how viable is it to play to the galleries? If one is using pre-recorded dialogues and LCD screens for close-up of actors, is it drama any more? Isn?t it historically proven, starting from Greek and Roman classics, that drama presented in large spaces like stadiums leaves less scope for subtlety of expression and depends a good deal on the spectacle?

 Apparently, Utpal Dutt had once presented Kallol in a stadium on a basic stage using microphones. But then he was addressing a smaller audience seated on the ground, not in the distant galleries.

 ?Stadium drama is not uncommon in the West. I had seen a show directed by Augusto Boal of Chile. It is important to have the necessary gadgets and the know-how at one?s disposal,? says Chandan Sen, technical director of Kallol.

 ?This is where we fell short in Kallol. We should have had a budget of Rs 80-90 lakh (not ?Rs 25 lakh?). There should have been six LCD screens, each measuring 100 ft-by-100 ft (like the ones used for big concerts). We should have gone for lapel mikes, instead of pre-recorded dialogues. But we had to cut down on costs. Lapel mikes need experts to control them. In Broadway, there are 300 or more lapel mikes and more music gets added on live. But here, technicians who can handle seven lapel mikes are hard to come by,? adds Sen.

 Samir Majumdar, who has directed Kallol, often stood in for Utpal Dutt when the actor was not well enough to play Admiral Rattray. 

 ?This is a strong and fiery play that deserves this kind of treatment. Here, we could present a boiler room in the HMS Khyber just as it was in real life and instead of acting in front of a black screen like we used to, we could present a lifelike waterfront bustee, just as it was in those times,? he says.

 The thing Sen is really pleased about is the way it has been possible to erect the 350 ft-by-100 ft set at the stadium with the 90 ft-by-28 ft ship on the stadium ground ?without damaging the ground?.

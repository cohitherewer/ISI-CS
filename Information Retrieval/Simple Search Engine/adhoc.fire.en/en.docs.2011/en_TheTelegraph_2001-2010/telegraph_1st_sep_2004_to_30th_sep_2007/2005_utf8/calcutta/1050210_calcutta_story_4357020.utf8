 A cure for loneliness

 A clinically accurate study of schizophrenia along with its apparently absurd symptoms, Theatrecian?s presentation of Edward Albee?s The Zoo Story is an attempt to highlight man?s essential loneliness within an apathetic, indifferent social environment. In the play, Jerry (Deborshi Barat) and Peter (Tathagata Chowdhury), the two protagonists, embody the typical characteristics of ordinary human beings. The willingly dominated, simpletons among us are the Peters, who are happy with their ?one wife, two cats and two parakeets?. The Jerrys, on the contrary, play an active part in shaping their lives, refusing to conform to the norms pre-determined by society. Staged against the backdrop of two park benches, the play shows Jerry mocking Peter about his dull, mundane way of life. The inane, incomprehensible conversation between the two serves as a metaphor of man?s inability to communicate with others, due to which he suffers isolation and detachment. Full of humour at its darkest best, the play ends with Jerry finally arousing Peter from his passive stupor, and Peter agreeing to stand up ?for his rights?. Direction: Tanushree Das.

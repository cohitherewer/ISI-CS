The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Not all employees in the offices of the IT firms in Salt Lake?s Sector V own vehicles. Many have to depend on the public transport to reach their workplaces. But the public transport system here is barely adequate. A few private buses on routes 215A and 46B and a small number of public buses are the only options available. They are insufficient to cope with the increasing number of office-goers in Saltlec. I appeal to the transport department to address this issue immediately. 

 Piyal Mukherjee,

 Lake Town. 

 I commute in Birati-Garia CTC buses twice or thrice a week from Baguiati to Jadavpur. Usually, the fare is Rs 8, but sometimes the conductors charge Rs 8.50. It will be of great help if proper fare-charts are put up in all CTC and state buses.

 Prasit Sen, 

 Hatiara. 

 The security guards at a temple in Ballygunge unnecessarily harass visitors. They don?t allow devotees to stand at any spot for more than a minute. During arati, all visitors are instructed to sit facing the idol and not move even an inch. Also, the security personnel there put their hands into the visitors? handbags despite having metal detectors. The temple authorities should change these illogical rules. 

 Moumita Nandi,

 Behala.

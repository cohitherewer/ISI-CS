 Finding fashion flaws

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 The wisdom of What Not to Wear, 

 a blisteringly frank BBC lifestyle show now comes in the 

 form of a book. The series ? which can be seen in India 

 on Discovery Travel and Living ? tears to bits fashion disasters 

 and reconstructs them with the help of tips on how to dress 

 to hide figure flaws.

 The best part of the Rs 435 book, 

 written by Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, who 

 also host the series, is perhaps the introduction, which 

 also explains with clarity the raison d?tre behind 

 it all ? Looking stylish is as much about knowing 

 what not to wear as it is about knowing what suits you.

 There is hope in the message these 

 two women bring. To look good is very much within the realms 

 of possibility. Perhaps not in the fashion model sense of 

 the term, which they dismiss ? thankfully ? as unattainable 

 for mere mortals such as ourselves. We incorrectly 

 believe the notion of becoming stylish is a feat way beyond 

 our grasp, write the authors. In fact, they stress 

 that the supposition that we are born with style is unfair 

 codswallop.

 Instead, they entreat the reader 

 to follow a strategy of showing what you love and 

 hiding what you loathe. If that means rejecting fashion 

 trends or picking and choosing only that which suits your 

 figure type, then so be it. And also taking responsibility 

 ? without blaming the shabbiness on the diet that never 

 took off or the raise that never materialised.

 What works for the book beyond 

 that is these women ? attractive but not goddesses ? hold 

 themselves up to the same scrutiny here as they put their 

 subjects through in the show. On TV, they admit, they are 

 often accused of employing harsh and unforgiving tactics 

 ? though they are proud of the results. Here, 

 they turn the camera on themselves, using their own body 

 imperfections to demonstrate how real women with real bodies 

 can choose clothes that make the most of what they have. 

 They are educated well in the art of camouflage 

 and wish to pass on that critical knowledge to their audience.

 The book is divided into chapters 

 on the common complaints ? breasts (big and small), no waist, 

 big arms, flabby tummy, saddlebags, short neck, thick ankles 

 and calves, big bum. 

 Then, the duo proceeds to wear 

 some truly hideous outfits to demonstrate the fashion must 

 nots, with the easy, attractive alternative provided on 

 the opposite page.

 A word of warning ? these two 

 make it all deceptively easy. And without the best of British 

 stores at your disposal, replicating the look is likely 

 to be more challenging.

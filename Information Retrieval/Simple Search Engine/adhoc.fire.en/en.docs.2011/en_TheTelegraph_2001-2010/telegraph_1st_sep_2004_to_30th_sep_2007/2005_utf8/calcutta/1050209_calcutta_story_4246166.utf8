 30 zones in city too noisy by far

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The survey by the state pollution control board reveals that the noise level in several pockets of the city is far above the permissible limit.

 The environment watchdog had monitored the noise levels round-the-clock at 30 spots from May to August 2004. At all the spots, the levels were far beyond the permissible limit.

 Noise pollution was last measured in 1999.

 According to the report, the four most noisy zones are the Howrah bridge approach (96.9 db), Moulali (94.4 db), Hazra (78.7 db) and Jadavpur (77.9 db). 

 The daytime noise limit is 55 db in residential areas, 65 in commercial areas and 75 in industrial areas.

 ?We had measured the noise level at 30 locations, close to residential areas, with sound-level meters. The data were recorded after every 30 seconds for 24 hours,? said Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary of the pollution control board.

 Admitting that the noise levels in almost all the 30 spots were above the permissible limit, he, however, said the extent of noise was less than what was detected in 1999.

 ?The places where we recorded a drop in the noise level include Shyambazar, Ultadanga and Sealdah. We need to take more steps to bring the level further down and within the permissible limit,? Sarkar added. 

 The decision to monitor the noise level followed a series of complaints from residents of several roadside buildings, especially in Ultadanga, Moulali, Gariahat, Bowbazar and Burrabazar.

 According to the findings, the peak-hour noise level in Moulali, Ultadanga, Howrah Bridge approach, Hazra and Jadavpur can be considered ?unbearable?.

 The key reasons for the noise level crossing the permissible limit, according to board experts, are excessive honking of horns, use of loudspeakers, hawking and occasional bursting of crackers.

 ?Some drivers blow horns unnecessarily. Some honk to overtake a vehicle, while a few do only to prod the traffic cop to turn the signal green,? said a pollution board official.

 ?It is enough to blow the horn once or twice to alert someone, but we often find drivers honking continuously. We had recorded 22,168 honkings a day at the JL Nehru Road-AJC Bose Road crossing. We had also spotted drivers plying vehicles with their music systems on at full blast. Noise level cannot be brought down if such practices are not curbed,? the official added.

 As part of its winter reading, the pollution control board has been measuring the noise level at different parts, since December 2004. The round-the-clock monitoring will continue till February.

 ?We will analyse the winter report and compare it with the one obtained during summer. Only after that, an effective action plan can be chalked out,? said the official.

 ?If honking can be checked and the use of loudspeakers minimised, the noise level can be reduced by 50 per cent. The board, traffic police and vehicle operators will have to work together to achieve the objective,? member-secretary Sarkar signed off.

 Tips on right upbringing

 - Workshop will train parents to rear tomorrow?s citizens

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 When Rashtraguru Surendranath Banerjee founded the Indian Association (Bharat Sabha) in 1876, his mission was to make people aware of socio-political issues and help them become responsible citizens.

 Nearly 130 years later, with the socio-political scene having undergone a sea change, a group of teachers ? under the Association?s banner ? has planned to take forward the founder?s vision.

 In a workshop scheduled for February 16, the association will counsel parents on how to bring up their children, the citizens of tomorrow. 

 ?We are targeting parents for our awareness programme because they spend the maximum time with their children,? explained association secretary Satyabrata Choudhury. He has been the principal of Bangabasi College and had also taught at St Xavier?s College. 

 The workshop-cum-discussion will take place in the Association auditorium, in central Calcutta. It will be attended by parents, schoolteachers, academics and psychiatrists.

 ?Today, when the number of ?problem children? is rapidly increasing, we have a very important message for the parents ? don?t turn your children into mental patients,? said city-based psychologist Mahua Ghosh, who will attend the workshop.

 Several social workers, including Sister Cyril, have been invited to deliver lectures on moral aspects of personality development.

 ?We may discuss with parents how to inculcate in the children the habit of speaking the truth,? said Arundhuti Mukherjee, organising committee convener and a teacher of Gokhale Memorial School.

 ?Lying has always been discouraged. And it is especially important for the children of this generation to learn to speak the truth,? she added.

 Certain moral, social and political issues will be discussed with the parents, who will be taught how to present them in proper perspective to their wards. ?For example, we may take up communalism and ask the parents to elaborate their stand on it,? said an organiser. 

 ?The idea is to ensure that the parents give their children the right advice on combating communalism,? he added.

 Over the years, the association has undertaken several schemes to create awareness about various issues. ?Our current move is a step in that direction,? secretary Choudhury signed off.

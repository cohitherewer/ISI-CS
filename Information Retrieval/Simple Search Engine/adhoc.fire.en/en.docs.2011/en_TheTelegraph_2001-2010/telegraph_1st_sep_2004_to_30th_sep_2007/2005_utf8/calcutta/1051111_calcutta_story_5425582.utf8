The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Foreign focus to build a brand 

Stress on student exchange

 - Biggies jockey with job offers; B-school network grows beyond barriers

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Tuck School of Business and Wharton are coming to the Joka campus for management games. Pan-IIM meets are travelling to London, New York, San Francisco and Singapore. Student exchange programmes are embracing City University of New York and European Business School. And then there?s a plum role in the Association of Asia-Pacific Business Schools.

 Clearly, foreign is the focus for the Indian Institutes of Management, and Joka, too, is jostling for brand presence beyond borders.

 And this comes with IIM Calcutta preparing for its ?best summer placements?, with November 12 as day zero (see graphic).

 A large number of firms ? including some global biggies and a few first-timers ? jockeying for favourable recruitment positions has further buoyed the brand equity of IIM Calcutta.

 Close on the heels of what is billed to be a summer placement to remember, Joka will be playing host to its biggest on-campus meet.

 Intaglio 2005-06, Joka?s annual business-school meet, is slated for December 22-25. 

 Teams from Harvard Business School, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Tuck School of Business would lead a star line-up for a competitive meet that tests the marketing, finance and strategy consulting skills of tomorrow?s managers on city soil.

 ?Intaglio has evolved into a platform for partnership between industry and the best B-schools from all over the globe,? says a key organiser of the flagship event.

 If the current batches are playing high-profile hosts, the IIM alumni have been gathering in places as diverse as San Francisco, London, Singapore and New York to help build Brand IIM. 

 ?This is one area that has been overlooked. In order to position ourselves as a global destination for graduate management studies, all the IIMs must be projected together as centres of excellence,? says Anup Sinha, dean, programme initiatives, IIM Joka.

 Back in Joka, the student exchange programme, or STEP, is being used to forge collaborative partnerships with B-schools around the globe. 

 Last month, STEP saw 40-odd students from IIM Joka packing their bags for a term of international experience in Institute De Empresa, City University of New York, European Business School, WHU-Koblenz and more.

 ?We want to increase the number of outgoing and incoming students taking part in STEP. It is one initiative by which IIM Joka can be known as an international centre of excellence in management education,? says Shekhar Chowdhury, director, IIM-Calcutta.

 Closer home, IIM Joka has a role to play in the Association of Asia-Pacific Business Schools, formed to advance the quality of business and management education in the region. 

 ?Being part of this network, we can access so many resources. Collaboration and sharing of case studies, joint research work, student exchange programmes, joint diploma or degree programmes? the opportunities are boundless,? feels Chowdhury.

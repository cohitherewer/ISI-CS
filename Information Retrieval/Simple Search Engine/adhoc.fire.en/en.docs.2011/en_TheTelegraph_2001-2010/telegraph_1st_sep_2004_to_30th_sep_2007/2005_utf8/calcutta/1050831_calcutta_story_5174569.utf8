 Quest for spirituality

 Ostensibly conceived as an invocation to the Tathagata in these troubled times, Anasuya Majumder?s ongoing exhibition of paintings, Reaching for the Buddha, ends up more as a struggle to relocate the Buddha in an alien knowledge system. Obliterating the face of divinity with objects and symbols of man?s endeavour to control and regulate nature to the point of destroying it, her works articulate the artist?s fear of an imminent moral collapse in life and society. Majumder?s search for the Buddha, however, remains outside the terror, violence and chaos she associates with modern civilisation. It is in the form of an eye, which symbolises knowledge, or a hand, which represents co-operation and understanding, that she attempts to find bliss, peace and contentment. Traces of ironic suggestions about the uncertainty of the possible success of her quest, however, remain. Still, there is enough strength in her compositions, no matter how obscure at times, to give her search a meaning and a significance.

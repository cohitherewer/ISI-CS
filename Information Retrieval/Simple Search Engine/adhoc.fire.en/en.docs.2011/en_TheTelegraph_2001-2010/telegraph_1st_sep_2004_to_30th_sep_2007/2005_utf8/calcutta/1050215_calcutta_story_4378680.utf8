 CPM levels out the green

 - On-the-spot survey of Maidan clean-up by army on Tuesday

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A day after cleaning the Maidan, the CPM went a step ahead on Monday in an attempt to ?restore? the ground and set an example of sorts. 

 Around 10.30 am, six workers, under the supervision of Provash Halder of Jayshree Decorators, started filling up the pits left behind by Saturday?s mega rally on the green. 

 A truckload of white sand was brought in and the workers carried it in carts to dress up the pits formed by the poles dug in to instal loudspeakers. 

 When they left after three hours, the ground was level. There was no litter in sight. The work continued till late in the afternoon, as the labourers filled up about 1,200 pits, reportedly at the behest of an army team that directed them to do the ?unfinished task?. 

 ?The army team asked us to complete the job by today and we are following the orders. This, incidentally, is the first time we are doing such a job,? Halder said. 

 He added that the CPM had entrusted his company with accomplishing the mission.

 The clean-up act by the CPM, as party insiders claimed, was aimed at sending a message to the high court that had expressed its unhappiness over rallies being held on the Maidan because of the mess they leave behind.

 The sprucing up on Monday was not only the first operation of its kind by a political party but also served to pacify the army, the custodian of the grounds. 

 On Tuesday, the GoC-in-C (Bengal Area), Major General Z.A.U. Shah, will visit the Maidan to make an on-the-spot survey and take note of the work done so far. General Shah will not only see the section of the ground where the CPM rally was held, but will also move around the area where the Calcutta Book Fair was organised. 

 The fair organisers, Publishers and Booksellers Guild, have been given till Tuesday to ?restore? the ground before handing it over to the army. 

 On Monday the police said they were ?satisfied? with the job done so far. 

 ?Just the electric poles remain. The rest has been cleaned up. We have taken photographs to submit them in court,? said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Ranveer Kumar. 

 Asked why the Guild was taking so long, police said all Maidan mela organisers are given time to clear up. This was no exception.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Action heroes unsung

 They form a vital cog in the wonder wheel of Bollywood. They risk their life and limb so that the audience is spellbound with scenes of death-defying stunts. But life hasn?t changed much for the stuntmen in the world?s busiest film industry.

 National Geographic Channel?s Stuntmen of Bollywood narrates the tales of these unsung heroes. The programme is part of the channel?s 12-episode It Happens Only in India series, which airs on Sunday. 

 ?We had been planning Indian content for the past one year. We wanted to present the real, true India and not the typical ?colours of Rajasthan? kind of programmes,? said Dilshad Master, senior vice-president, content and communication of National Geographic Channel, at the launch of the series in Calcutta, on Friday.

 The Stuntmen of Bollywood episode was screened at the launch. The highlight of the documentary was the story of car stuntman Habib Haji, and his mentor, action director Alan Amin. Habib?s father was a leading stuntman of his time who met a tragic end during a shoot. Standing in for Anil Kapoor, Habib?s father drove a car into a lake, although he didn?t know how to swim. Worse still, his seat belt wouldn?t open. Yet, Habib followed in his father?s footsteps. ?If anything, it has made me more careful and prepared about taking risks,? Habib said.

 The documentary examines issues like safety standards, compensation and insurance norms for stuntmen in Bollywood.

 Vidya Shetty, a daring stuntman, had a bad fall that left him paralysed for life. Since it happened during a practice session, he could not even claim insurance. Another stuntman jumped from a high building, missed the landing and died on the spot. ?But that?s how it is, no risk no gain. And you never say never,? offered a stunt trainer.

 The situation is improving slowly as awareness grows. Stunt directors like Alan Amin, who has worked on action movies like Dhoom (picture below) and Blackmail, are importing props like glass bottles made of sugar, as a safety measure.

 Can?t action heroes do more of their own stunts? ?When I started out, I used to do 99 per cent of the stunts myself and there were injuries as well. But now, when several crores rest on your shoulders, one isn?t allowed to do all that,? said Suneil Shetty. Vivek Oberoi admitted that it?s very different when a hero is injured on the sets, as opposed to a stuntman.

 It Happens Only in India?s other episodes take a look at topics as varied as killer tigers in the Sunderbans, witch-hunts in tribal India, the Indian Railways, a project on providing Internet access to street children and more.

 ?Currently, of the 316 hours of our programming aired annually, around 15 hours are on Indian content,? Master said. The channel is also planning a programme based on Durga puja in Calcutta.

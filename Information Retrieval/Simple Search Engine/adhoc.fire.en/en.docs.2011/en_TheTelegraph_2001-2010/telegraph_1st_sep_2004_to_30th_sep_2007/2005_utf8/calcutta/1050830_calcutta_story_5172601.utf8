 Scurry for dengue damage control

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 After pussyfooting over the dengue outbreak and the toll it has taken, the state government on Monday finally sat up, with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee taking stock of the situation, and declaring that it was imperative to be on the alert.

 Hours after holding an emergency meeting with the health top brass on Sunday, chief minister Bhattacharjee on Monday admitted that while the death count had not increased, the number of victims had crossed the 200-mark, and this was a cause for concern. 

 ?I had a meeting with the health minister yesterday, and going by the number of people affected to date, we need to be on the alert. Based on a survey, it appears that areas adjoining the Lakes and Dhakuria are affected and need to be fumigated,? Bhattacharjee said, leaving the state health department and the civic authorities red in the face. 

 As a first step towards damage control, the government claimed it would reach out to the print and electronic media, including Doordarshan, to spread awareness about the virus so that people know what to do in case of illness. 

 The campaign will be aimed at making people realise the hazards of storing dirty water and tell them how it served as a breeding ground for the Ades mosquito, carrier of the dengue virus. 

 The move came on a day when doctors at almost all the major hospitals across the city desperately tried to handle the steady stream of patients turning up with symptoms of haemorrhagic fever. 

 With no proper kit available, the hospitals depended on pathologists to do the work as early as possible. 

 At Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, of the 30 patients with fever who turned up for a blood test, eight tested positive. Similar reports emanated from RG Kar Medical College, where a first-year student was admitted after he complained of dengue-like symptoms. 

 But more than adults, doctors at this hospital seemed concerned over the number of children turning up at the paediatric outdoor with dengue-like symptoms.

 ?Last Saturday, for instance, out of 119 patients turning up at the paediatric outdoor, almost 40 children had dengue-like fever. We are not taking chances. The blood samples are being sent to the School of Tropical Medicine for special tests,? said Pradip Mitra, superintendent of the RG Kar Medical College. 

 Things were no better at the Medical College. On Monday, tension ran high as patients started pouring in and the hospital authorities struggled to accommodate them, on the floors as well. 

 A clash broke out when the guards reportedly denied entry to the family members of Md Mouli Mondal, a resident of Haji Mohd Mohsin Square, admitted with a fever on Sunday. Lying on the floor, the youth showed all the signs of dengue. On Monday, when his relatives were denied entry, they went berserk, throwing furniture at the ward master. 

 Senior hospital staff stepped in to pacify them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Storm shield for airport

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has installed special protective shields around the radars at the Calcutta airport to ward off adverse weather conditions.

 On the evening of May 2, heavy thunderstorms and lightning damaged the radars at the airport completely. As a result, the air traffic controllers had to depend more on procedural landing and instrument landing systems.

 ?Although, the radars were not functioning till May 7, the safety aspect was not compromised. Radars are only for surveillance, while navigational aids and the communication network are used to make a flight land or take off. The latter were in perfect condition,? said A.K. Misra, executive director (communication-navigation-surveillance) of AAI.

 Praveen Seth, the regional executive director (eastern region), announced plans for setting up Advanced Lightning and Search Protection Systems (ALSPL) in Calcutta within six months. The radars presently have four lightning arresters. ?Once the system is in place, presently installed only at the Chennai airport, the electrostatic energy from lightning can be easily repelled,? Seth observed.

 ?The protective shield is very popular in Australia. We have plans to have those in Calcutta as well,? Misra said. Weather conditions in Calcutta usually get worse during this time of the year, and according to aviation safety experts, a protective shield would be apt for the safety of the aircraft.

 The AAI has plans to cover the entire Indian landmass with route radars, aimed at providing better air safety and increase airspace.

 As of now, there are 14 radars on the Indian landmass. With the commissioning of four more, all flights in the Indian airspace will be visible on the radar. ?Aircraft now fly at a distance of 50 nautical miles from each other. It will then be reduced to 30 nautical miles,? added Misra.

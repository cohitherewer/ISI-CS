 Clusters of ostrich feathers dyed in splashes of orange, fuchsia, yellow and turquoise adorned each table, unleashing a kaleidoscope of colours and setting the mood for the opening evening of the countrys largest wedding show.

 If the myriad hues hinted at the riot of colours to be unveiled on the ramp over the next three evenings, the unique d?cor created the right ambience for Extravaganza, the opening night of Bridal Asia 2005.

 The annual exhibition that brings together the best of wedding finery from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was unravelled with an exclusive three-day fashion event at The Grand in Delhi.

 The opening night of the seventh edition of Bridal Asia on Tuesday saw three style stalwarts ? Rocky S from Mumbai, Aneela Haque from Bangladesh and Sonya Battla from Pakistan ? showcasing for the first time at the event, along with regulars like Calcuttas Shantanu Goenka and the house of Satya Paul.

 The extravaganza was flagged off by Rocky Ss fairly traditional take on bridal wear ? a vibrant palette of lime green, red, orange, fuchsia, pink and pale blue, use of sheer nets and flowing georgettes and loads of heavy fusion embroidery with silver and gold on the stylised lehngas and saris. 

 My bridal collection is a very personal statement and doesnt follow any fashion forecasts or trends. I think thats the way the trousseau should be, said Rocky.

 From ethnic opulence to an arty display of a poetic travel journal, the mood of the show took a dramatic turn with Aneelas Majestic Royals collection. 

 Graphical prints and stitches in different languages ? scripts of Rabindranath Tagore, Jibanananda Das and Chinese and French poems ? embellished the bold red, black and white ensembles. 

 The unique silhouettes ? a mish-mash of dhotis with drapes, Patialas, kurtas with long coats for men and uniquely-draped saris with coats for women ? were paraded to Bengali folk tunes. 

 People may expect me to showcase traditional wedding gear of Bangladesh, but I am not claiming to do so. I have always been very influenced by these poets and wanted to use their scripts in my work, smiled the designer.

 The inspiration travelled to Morocco next, with Shantanus refreshing new look at bridal gear. 

 Ivory, black and red embellished with fine silk threads and metallic shimmer, and chunky pieces of Swarovski crystals embedded in plush velvets transported the ramp to the lanes of Marrakesh.

 From far-off Morocco to next-door Pakistan, designs by Sonya took the stage next. Clean, crisp lines, extensive use of draping and layer after layer of sheer fabrics defined the look. 

 Minimal embellishments on the body-flattering silhouettes brought a fresh feel to the show. 

 I feel Indian bridal wear is often very overdone? Wedding is the most important day of your life and you need to be yourself. So, dont overload your clothes with unnecessary embellishments, is how Sonya explained her minimalism.

 Finally, it was back to Indian bridal basics with ornate lehngas, saris and churidar kurtas from Satya Paul. The typical Indian wedding colours were elaborately worked with silver and gold, with the trademark Satya Paul prints peeping out. Models catwalked the opulent line to live shehnai tunes.

 Indian weddings are a celebration of the fantasy of colours, said Nazneen Shafi, managing director of The Special Events of Dubai, which has created the show ambience. 

 Colours are the mainstay of Indian bridal wear and we wanted the ambience to set the mood for the show. The feather look, however, is drawn from Paris and Vegas.

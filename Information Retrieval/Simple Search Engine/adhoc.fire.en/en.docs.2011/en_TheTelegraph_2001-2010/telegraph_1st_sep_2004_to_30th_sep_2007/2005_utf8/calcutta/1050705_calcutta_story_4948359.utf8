 Swamiji?s vision turns into varsity

 OUR BUREAU

 Swami Vivekananda?s vision has been translated into reality, with Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute opening its doors in Belur Math, Howrah, on Monday.

 On July 2, 1902, just two days before his death, Vivekananda had prophesied that a university would come up on the Math grounds. He had earlier written: ?Now, the aim is to gradually develop this Math into an all-round university.? 

 Swami Gahananandaji Maharaj, president of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, inaugurated the ?deemed university with a difference? at Vivekananda Sabhagriha, Belur Math. He also released the concept paper on Monday.

 Swami Gahananandaji Maharaj said: ?The university is meant not only for intellectual development, but also for discharging of moral responsibilities.? 

 Union minister for human resources development Arjun Singh, the chief guest, could not attend the programme ?as his doctors prevented him from travelling due to high fever?.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose name figured in the invitation for the inaugural ceremony, also could not make it ?due to pre-occupations?.

 Singh sent a copy of his prepared speech, which stated that ?a special grant of Rs 2 crore will be provided through the University Grants Commission (UGC) for the infrastructure development of the deemed university during the 10th Plan period?.

 ?The country, nay the whole world, is expecting a lot from this new university under the aegis of Ramakrishna Mission. It is our earnest hope that true to its tradition, the Mission will make a dedicated effort to take this university to great heights,? the text read.

 Swami Atmasthanandaji, vice-president of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Atmapriyanandaji, vice-chancellor of the institution, Ved Prakash, UGC secretary, and Sunil Kumar, joint secretary of the Union ministry, attended the inaugural programme.

 The Mission currently runs three colleges and two polytechnics, which will not be part of the university.

 Later in the day, vice-president of the Math, Swami Gitanandaji, inaugurated Vivekananda Research Centre for Fundamental Science and Philosophy at Swamiji?s ancestral house on Gour Mohan Mukherjee Street. ?The inauguration of this research centre is a historic event,? he said.

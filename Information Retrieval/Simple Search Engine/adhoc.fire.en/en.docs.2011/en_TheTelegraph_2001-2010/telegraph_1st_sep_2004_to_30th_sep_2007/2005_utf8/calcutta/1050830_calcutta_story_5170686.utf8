 Random dumping endangers the delta

 - THE PROBLEM WITH THE SUNDERBANS LIES FURTHER UPSTREAM, SAY EXPERTS

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Dumping waste and burnt oil in the Hooghly has put the Sunderbans delta in peril

 The problem with the Sunderbans, the world?s largest active delta system, lies not in the Sunderbans, but further upstream, all along the river basin, not the least in Calcutta, according to the Centre for Built Environment (CBE).

 The city-based think-tank of professional architects, city planners and environmentalists is sending its representatives to the eighth International Rivers Symposium 2005 in Brisbane, Australia (September 6 to 9) to share its views with a focused global audience.

 Architect-planner Unmesh Kirtikar and Shivashish Bose, architect and reader in the department of architecture, Jadavpur University, have been invited to present papers at the rivers symposium, part of the Brisbane River Festival organised by the Queensland government and Channel Nine.

 The two are joint-secretaries in the voluntary, non-profit society, which has grown into an internationally-recognised institution, with linkages to similar organisations in 50 countries, and will try to establish that faulty urban practices and wrongly controlled growth have combined to spell ecological doom in the mangrove domain.

 The theme of the Brisbane convention is ?Water and food security ? rivers in a global context? and it will feature 215 paper presentations from 37 countries. Kirtikar?s paper is titled Environmental parameters of rivers, canals, streams and estuaries, and is a case study across the Bengal delta looking at the technical side of the problem.

 Bose will chair the session ?Environmental flows in rivers and estuaries? and his own paper is called Mangroves in Sunderbans active delta ? ecological disasters amp; remedies. He will focus on the environment?s impact on the river system and synergies with the Sunderbans biosphere.

 ?Calcutta and its fringes are supposed to constitute a vital buffer zone to protect the delicate ecosystem of the Sunderbans. However, through flawed urban practices, like indiscriminate deforestation and construction activities and discharging burnt oil from speedboats and motorised barges into the Hooghly, we have ensured that the estuaries are highly polluted,? says Kirtikar.

 He laments the absence of a risk-management plan or vulnerability analysis programme for the delta islands, which are choked by silt from upstream, and suggests comprehensive studies in subjects like geo-morphology, hydro-geology and geo-chemistry in a holistic vein. ?Not just silting, all the hydrological and geographical changes, like the disappearance of small dunes, change in flora and fauna pattern and widespread coastal erosion are upstream problems, more often than not originating in the city,? stresses Kirtikar.

 His colleague in CBE, Bose, agrees. ?Sweeping urbanisation and human intervention upstream have put the complex biosphere of the Sunderbans in peril. Practices like wholesale land reclamation for shrimp culture have seriously disturbed the delta?s fragile ecosystem,? he observes. Bose in Brisbane will prescribe an environment management plan based on the United Nations? Man amp; Biosphere Programme.

 Kirtikar points out that unless ?we, as responsible citizens, manage our consumption and waste practices better?, the delta system will hurtle towards ?technological and ecological disaster?. To save the Sunderbans, Calcuttans must modify their lifestyle habits and indiscriminate dumping in the river has to stop, he emphasises. ?After all, there?s a dialectic relation between the city and the aqueous delta?.

 CBE, which has also been approached to present five sessions at the fourth edition of the World Water Forum in Mexico next year, feels the Brisbane river rendezvous can throw up a clutch of critical inputs for Calcutta. ?River restoration is a burning issue the world over now, and the Brisbane symposium could well yield a viable prescription to improve productivity in our riparian delta,? says veteran architect and town planner Santosh Ghosh, CBE president.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Downtown feel, New Town site

 - ?Organised chaos? to mark twin of Salt Lake shop-eat-entertainment address

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The urban chic of Tokyo?s fashion district Ginza, the timeless melange of New York?s Times Square or the celluloid charm of London?s Leicester Square ? a little bit of the look and feel of a downtown destination is coming to town.

 Poila Baisakh 2007 is when Calcutta will have its own melting pot of ?organised chaos?, City Centre Downtown, in New Town, Rajarhat.

 The sequel to the Charles Correa-signature shop-eat-entertainment hangout will be ?in a way dramatically opposite? to the Salt Lake address, claims Harsh Neotia.

 ?City Centre I was an architectural monolith. There was no plurality in the grammar as we tried to create a cityscape. In Downtown, the homogeneity will be deliberately broken and there will be many more diverse elements creating their own drama, much like a city square,? says Neotia.

 The 550,000-sq-ft Downtown, designed by Mumbai-based architect Kapil Bhalla, will have a 425,000-sq-ft retail-and-entertainment zone, ?50 per cent larger than in City Centre I?. Of this, 50,000 sq ft will be taken up by Kishore Biyani of Pantaloons, the anchor tenant, who is yet to decide on the appropriate format.

 89 Cinemas will run the four-screen cineplex, spread across 30,000 sq ft, while KFC, Pizza Hut and Italian coffee-shop chain Costa Coffee are likely players on the F amp;B footplate, along with other restaurants, nightclubs, museums and even a butterfly park.

 ?On the remaining 125,000 sq ft, sitting on the top, we could either have a three-star or an apartment hotel, or even a management institute or IT space,? says Neotia, managing director of Bengal Ambuja Housing Development, developing the Rs 150-crore project, next to its Ujjwala residential complex at the VIP Road end of the Rajarhat connector.

 The company has also acquired a one-acre plot from Hidco adjacent to the development, for a dedicated car-park building, housing 550 to 600 vehicles. Together with the twin-basement and on-street parking slots, City Centre II can hold more than 1,500 cars.

 ?The new City Centre is designed to bag its own identity as Downtown Rajarhat, a place that derives its character from its eclectic synergy. This isn?t about walls and columns, it?s about creating an experience, a tune you will carry in your heart,? Bhalla tells Metro from Mumbai.

 And the learning curve from the Correa creation will be used to the benefit of Downtown. ?While plurality is the essence, there will be an aesthetic connect that binds the blocks together and the somewhat confusing configuration of the Salt Lake project will be reduced,? observes Neotia.

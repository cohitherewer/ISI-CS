 Car twist in kerb hit job

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after a youth was fired at in Burrabazar, two people were arrested on Thursday in connection with the incident. 

 Pawan Kumar Sharma, who owns a Basmati rice godown in Posta, was arrested for providing a car to the assailants. He has been remanded in police custody till April 11.

 Following Sharma?s interrogation, Md. Taher, allegedly one of the assailants, was arrested late in the evening.

 Police said the brown Hyundai Accent in which the assailants drove to Jagmohan Mullick Lane, where they shot at 21-year-old Pramod Kumar Sharma, belongs to Pawan Sharma. 

 The target, however, was Pramod?s uncle Satyanarayan, who owns a tea-stall in the area. The gang had failed to identify him. 

 Preliminary investigation revealed that the attack was a fallout of a dispute between Satyanarayan and the owner of a confectionery, who is also engaged in real estate business. 

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department-I), said Sharma has four cars. ?He uses two of them for his car-rental business. However, the one used by the attackers was Sharma?s personal vehicle. We have not yet found it,? he added. 

 The mastermind of the attack has been identified as Gopal Tiwari, on the run for the past two years. 

 ?Tiwari was engaged by someone to eliminate Satyanarayan. The promoter tops our list of suspects,? said a detective department officer. 

 Early on Wednesday, Tiwari had met Pawan Sharma and asked for the car. He promised that the vehicle would be returned by the evening.

 While interrogating Sharma, sleuths came to know that he had provided cars to Tiwari on a number of occasions.

 ?But he never took money from the gangster. Asked why he allowed Tiwari to use his personal cars, Sharma could not give any satisfactory answer,? said the officer. 

 Deputy commissioner Singh said: ?Local residents gave us the vehicle?s number and told us that it was a Maruti Esteem. A search revealed that the car was a Hyundai Accent and was owned by Sharma.?

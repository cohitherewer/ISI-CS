 Wardrobe watch

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Chemb, with its collection of 

 clothes, bags, bangles, accessories and lifestyle products, 

 opened at City Centre on Saturday (picture Rashbehari Das). 

 Chemb, along with the parent store Radha, caters to 

 the wardrobe and more. Be it the corporate woman or home-maker, 

 our aim is to enhance the pleasures of womanhood, 

 explains owner Amita Bajoria.

 The clothes line designed by Amita is a colourful medley of Indian, western and Indo-western outfits. Saris, salwar suits, skirts, embroidered trousers and ponchos are on offer. I have used a lot of nets, georgette, and cotton. The designs and fabric keep the taste of Calcutta women in mind. Im also working on capris and a couple of other things, she smiles.

 The collection of bags called Sanguine comes in red, orange, white and more. The bags are suitable pack-ins for both party and office use. Bags with beautiful embellishments of butterflies and flowers can be matched with traditional Indian apparel.

 Comb clips, Juda clips, bangles, earrings, bindis and mobile covers are all available in various shapes and designs. Bathroom accessories, lamp shades, vases and figurines with bronze finish are definite eye catchers. Also check out the candle stands, photostands and kids hair clips. 

 All about eve

 Flowers are synonymous with women. And Flower Power in Tantra on July 13 ensured that they all came adorned in floral attire to avail of the complimentary drinks on offer. A hibiscus bud tucked neatly behind the ear to a floral-print ankle-length skirt, the nightclub at The Park saw it all on Wednesday night.

 All our Chromosome X nights highlight the various facets of a womans mind, be it the delicate appeal of Flower Power or the ruggedness of the feminine self in Sexy Sporty later this month, said Namrata Ray, manager, events and entertainment, The Park.

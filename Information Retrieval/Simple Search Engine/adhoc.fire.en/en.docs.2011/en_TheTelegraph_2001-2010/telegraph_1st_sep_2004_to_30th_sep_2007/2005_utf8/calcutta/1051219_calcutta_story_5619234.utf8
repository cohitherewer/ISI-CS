The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tourism potential and policies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 How does our city grow? Is it just part of the mammoth Manhattanisation sweeping all major cities of South Asia or does it still retain its identity? Is it the poverty-stricken, self-centred city lulled by a cultural and colonial nostalgia or a hip and striving metropolis conscious of its ecological responsibilities?

 The recent seminar hosted by the Centre for Built Environment, at Academy of Fine Arts, may have been on The Changing Face of South Asia ? Society, Culture and Environment, but out of the myriad points raised by the speakers emerged this basic preoccupation with the city Calcutta.

 Staffan Lindberg, from Sweden?s Lund University, described the changes noted by his study on 25 years of change in rural south India. But one could not but think of the just started impulse for water conservation and wetland recovery in Calcutta. 

 Sandra Cristine Simoes Marques, of University of Lisbon, spoke on changing perceptions in tourism, criss-crossing Maldives, Bhutan and India. 

 For a study of Indian tourism, she focussed on Calcutta where the phenomenon ?is only just starting?. Calcutta, she said, must take itself seriously and try to create a permanent place on the international tourist map ?not just as a stopover for the Himalaya adventure tourists?. Tourism policies, she stressed, are still too general, and there is a need for ?more precise attention?. 

 President of the Centre for Built Environment, Santosh Ghosh, spoke on the need for Calcutta to augment its identity and preserve its heritage buildings and traditions. Other speakers were Mahua Mukherjee (IIT, Roorkee), Lorena Gisbon (Massey University, New Zealand) and Mahalaya Chatterjee (Centre for Urban Economic Studies).

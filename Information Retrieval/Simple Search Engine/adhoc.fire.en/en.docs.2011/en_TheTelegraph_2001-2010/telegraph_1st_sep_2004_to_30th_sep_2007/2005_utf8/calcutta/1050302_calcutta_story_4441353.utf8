The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A beautiful date at calendar call

 Yana Gupta shows off her photographs at the launch 

of the Lee Supermodel Calendar in Mumbai

When six of the country?s best photographers (Prabuddha Dasgupta, Subi Samuel, Nisha Kutty, Tarun Khiwal, Suresh Natrajan and Tejal Patni) take thousands of shots of one of the most stunning women in the country to find the perfect 12 images, the results are sure to hold your gaze. And when the dozen frames are of supermodel Yana Gupta for the Lee Supermodel Calendar, you are guaranteed the pleasure of marvelling over them for an entire year ? from March ?05 to March ?06.

 Launched at a star-studded bash at the chic Vie Deck and Lounge in posh Juhu last Thursday, the first-of-its-kind fashion calendar promises to be an annual feature, with a new beautiful face every year.

 This time, however, all eyes were on Yana. She began the evening dressed in a sari teamed with a spaghetti top, hair softly framing her face, making an entry well before the other guests, playing host more than celebrity.

 ?This is my party! I have even got my favourite CD along for the DJ to play. I don?t party too much but today will be different,? she chirped. To prove her point, she shed her ethnic ensemble in favour of a short, sequinned number just minutes after the on-stage formalities with the shutterbugs were over.

 The wind-caressed open-air lounge with its ship-deck theme overlooking the evening sea was the perfect, magical setting, as a slide show displaying the photographs gave way to a glittery evening. Salman Khan, John Abhraham, Bipasha Basu, Saif Ali Khan, Lara Dutta, Katarina Kaif, Sanjay Suri and Rahul Bose were just a few of the movers seen shaking a leg alongside a host of models, choreographers and photographers.

 Kebabs and a peppery fish concoction kept wine and whisky company, before an Italian feast was laid out. The stars nibbled and sipped for just enough sustenance to party late into the night, dancing to Yana?s tunes, catching up on gossip and basking in the beauty of a dark sea and a starry, star lit night.

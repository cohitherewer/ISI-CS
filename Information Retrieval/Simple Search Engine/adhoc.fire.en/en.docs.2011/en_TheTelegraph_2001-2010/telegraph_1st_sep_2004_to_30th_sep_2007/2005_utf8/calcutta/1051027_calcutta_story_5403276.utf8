The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Roads, lights and water for township

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Better roads, more lights and adequate drinking water ? a Diwali boon awaits the residents of Salt Lake.

 The government announced on Wednesday that Rs 75 lakh would be spent to repair roads in the township and set up street lights in the added areas.

 While Rs 50 lakh has been allotted for road repair, the rest of the funds will be spent on the lights, stated state urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya. The minister met the officials of Bidhannagar Municipality during the day.

 ?The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority has been entrusted with the responsibility of road repair. Work has already started,? Bhattacharya added.

 According to municipality officials, important thoroughfares would be repaired before the roads in the blocks.

 The authorities have faced severe criticism from residents of Salt Lake over the poor condition of the roads. There are about 222 km of roads in the township proper and about 53 km in the added areas.

 Last year, the state government had taken up a Rs 5-crore project to repair roads in the township. 

 The municipality had spent Rs 4.75 crore on road repairs in 2004. This year, it has allocated nearly Rs 5 crore for the purpose.

 ?We had taken loans and raised some money by utilising our own resources. At least Rs 10 crore is needed for a thorough repair,? said an officer of Bidhannagar Municipality.

 The civic Opposition, Trinamul Congress, alleged that the sum allocated by the government was inadequate.

 ?This is an eyewash. Even half the total length of the roads cannot be repaired with such a meagre amount,? said Indrani Dutta, Trinamul councillor of ward 10 of the municipality.

 ?The civic body is not in a position to spend much, as it has to repay the loans. The state government must open its purses for the benefit of Salt Lake?s residents,? she asserted. 

 Regarding installation of street lights, minister Bhattacharya said: ?It has been a longstanding demand of the residents of the added areas.?

 He added that he would hold talks with Calcutta mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya regarding supply of 10 million gallons of drinking water to the Salt Lake, Dum Dum and South Dum Dum municipalities. 

 ?A project for generating 20 million gallons of drinking water at Tallah-Palta is being implemented. It will be completed in a few months,? the minister elaborated.

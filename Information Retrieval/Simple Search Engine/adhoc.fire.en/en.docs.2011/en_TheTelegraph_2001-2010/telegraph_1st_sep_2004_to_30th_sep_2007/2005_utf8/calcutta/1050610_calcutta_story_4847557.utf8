 In spooky spirit

 Skull cakes amp; skeleton masks can give your bash a scary twist, says Himika Chaudhuri

 Do up the venue with bright lights and happy colours 

A restobar in the city just played host to a night dedicated to all things devilish, giving guests a chance to flaunt sequinned horns and masks as they danced the night away. A wicked evening with some demons from the dark side and ghosts as guests could be a great way to twist the party tale, with skull-shaped cakes and watermelon vodka shots adding to the fun of a freaky night out.

 D?cor drama

 Its difficult to get into the mood of a ghost party unless the d?cor suits the occasion. You obviously cannot have bright lights and happy colours all over the place and expect people to feel spooky, says event manager Riya Mitra.

 The idea is to dim the lights and do up the venue with plastic skeletons and masks placed under focussed neon lights to shock the guests.

 We do some interesting digital paintings of scary faces on ceramic tiles that can be put up on the walls or placed in strategic positions to add to the effect, explains Surendra Kumar Jhaluka of Aart el Cristal, a store on Lenin Sarani that specialises in digital designs on ceramic tiles.

 You can try out your artistic skills at home, too. We usually use florescent paint on black cotton cloth to draw some unusual signs and faces that can be hung on the walls, suggests Riya. Or get the help of a poster painter.

 To add a touch of class and comfort, make liberal use of black and red cushions and drapes. 

 Ghostly gear

 Your guests will never get into the mayhem mood if there isnt a dress code. They could dress like Count Dracula, wearing black cloak, black breeches, a white shirt and a red bow-tie, or paint a human skeleton on an all-black outfit. If you are desperately short of imagination, take a ghostly turn draped in a white bed-sheet with holes for eyes.

 I would suggest some make-up on both the men and women for the occasion. One should go for blood red lips, dark eyes and a pale colour on the face, recommends makeup artist Abhijeet Chandra.

 A host of accessories available at various stores in the city can jazz up the ghastly ghost look, adds event manager Amit Hatiramani. Horns to vampire teeth ? look around for the perfect add-ons.

 While masks and headgear with weird hairstyles are available at Nik Nish on Camac Street, the shops off Free School Street sell some skeleton masks and scary faces made from plastic that are suitable for the bash.

 Food amp; drink

 Plan ahead and order cakes and cookies shaped like a human skull, or other spooky designs. If you are looking for some real gore, the skull cake can have a jelly filling so that the red fluid flows out.

 One of the hosts can dress up as a cannibal ghost and serve meat to the guests while cutting off slices from a large chunk, says Amit. 

 Bloody Mary and Virgin Mary are the ideal drinks for a ghost party because of their red colour, says bar expert Irfan Ahmed. 

 Cold watermelon juice would also work well. For a variation, top off vodka or white rum with watermelon juice in a shot glass and serve cold.

 Fun games

 Some spine-chilling games can help turn up the fun before dinner. Play darkroom, for instance, where everyone hides and the lights are turned off. One of your guests will be deemed a ghost till he or she finds someone and is released from the spell.

 For a sense of drama, ask one of your guests in the spookiest outfit to hide behind the door to scare the daylights out of all who arrive.

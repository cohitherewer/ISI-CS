Designer Sayon Mitras autumn-winter 2005-06 haute couture collection is all about opulence. 

 Luxurious, grandiose, and regal are some of the words that can be associated with my winter collection, says Sayon.

 He has used faux fur along with pure wool, tweed, silk dupion, jacquard crepe, silk and jamewars. Divided into two distinct segments, the first one has well-structured clothes like corsets, jackets, trousers, dresses, skirts, bandhgalas and sherwanis with uncluttered silhouettes. 

 The silhouettes in the second segment are busier, more draped and less structured. The fabrics used are fluid, crepe, georgettes and dupions, says Sayon. 

 There are richer embroideries with Swarovski crystals, zardozi and appliqu? with traditional jamewars. Sayons diffusion line comprises simpler silhouettes and is highly textured.

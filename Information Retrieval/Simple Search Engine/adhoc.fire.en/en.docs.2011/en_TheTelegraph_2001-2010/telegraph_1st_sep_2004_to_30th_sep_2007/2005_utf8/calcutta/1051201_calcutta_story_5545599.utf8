 Letters

 Five decades ago: Vignettes of old Calcutta 

 N.S. Mani?s letter ?A city worth a look back in wonder? on October 27 made for a wonderful read. It also brought back some wonderful memories. 

 I, too, was not born in Calcutta. I came to the city for higher studies from a small town in Assam around the same time Mani first set foot here. 

 To my young eyes, the city looked new every day. It was far cleaner than it is today. Most of the streets were washed twice daily ? early in the morning and in the afternoon. 

 Roads in a state of disrepair were unthinkable back then. Repairs were done round-the-clock. The footpaths were clean and free of hawkers. 

 Nobody littered the roads or dumped garbage on the kerb. The designated dumps were regularly cleared. 

 There were more trees and waterbodies and the people were friendly and ever ready to lend a helping hand. It was customary to vacate seats in trams and buses if the aged and women were standing. 

 The price tags would be difficult to believe now. A pair of Bata shoes used to cost only Rs 2. Ice-creams were available for half an anna. One could have a proper lunch for six annas. A lavish spread with a choice of fish and desserts cost only 14 annas. 

 The Maidan looked more green then and a tram-ride past it was heavenly. The Victoria Memorial was the top draw for tourists. The zoo, which housed more animals then, came a close second. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos ?Hotel room suicide ends extra-marital affair?, November 3, it is shameful that the young people are abdicating their responsibility towards their families and pursuing illicit liaisons. In the name of mirroring social reality, the media glorifies immorality. A section of people is in the process encouraged to pursue indiscriminate sex. This trend might shake the foundations of the society. Love is too feeble an excuse for extra-marital affairs. 

 Samir Chakraborty,

 Ramrajatala. 

 Apropos the article ?JU students will study in Japan?, October 31, it is wonderful that Jadavpur University has entered a student exchange agreement with a Japanese institute. This will widen the job prospects of the students. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 The chief minister should get the credit for securing the Union nod to establish a national institute of science education and research in the city (Science on revival route, October 29). Calcutta did not figure on the preliminary list. It made the cut only because of his initiative. 

 Progress in science is vital for the development of a country and such an institute would provide a fillip to the chief minister?s industrialisation dream. The institute would also help arrest brain drain, not only from the state, but also from the country. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos ?Trees felled for rural feel?, November 3, it is a matter of serious concern that grown trees were indiscriminately felled in the city by Kali puja committees to decorate pandals. 

 The chief minister himself had to discipline people who were chopping trees on Park Street in the name of trimming. It is difficult to figure out how the officials responsible for looking after the city greenery can continue to draw their full salary, yet remain so lackadaisical about their job. 

 S. Banerjee,

 Address not given. 

 Apropos ?Residents lack civic sense?, October 29, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) needs to look at itself rather than blame the residents of the city. The CMC should also learn from municipalities of Surat, Ankaleshwar and Hyderabad. These civic bodies actually provide some service in return of tax and their staff aren?t as lazy and irresponsible. 

 Shiv Shankar Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Apropos ?Time to rock on the river?, November 1, Calcuttans will at last get a chance to enjoy a river cruise. The well-heeled will now be able to try something out other than amusement parks and discotheques. 

 River cruises are very popular in Guwahati, where the vessel is called Jolpari. A one-hour cruise on the Brahmaputra costs Rs 50 per head. The steep ticket price at Calcutta can prove to be a deterrent for the ordinary people. 

 Amit V. Sengupta,

 Sarat Colony. 

 It is reassuring to know that not all people have sacrificed their values ?Woman returns money found in taxi?, October 29. Everyone should follow Sashwati Mitra?s example when such situations arise. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala.

 The report ?Cops take a boat to dole out relief?, October 25, shows policemen in a positive light. The officers deserve kudos for trying to rescue those stranded in Liluah after heavy rainfall for a week. Their act would make people think twice before branding policemen ?government?s criminals?. The ordinary people would like nothing better than to have such Robin Hoods at hand. 

 Debasish Ray, 

 Liluah, Howrah.

 The Government Railway Police deserves credit for busting the job racket (Arrest rips rail job scam lid, October 26). The incident underscores how greed, dishonesty and selfishness have taken roots. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park.

 Apropos the report ?Hawker ouster order gathers dust?, October 31, it is unfortunate that though the high court has ordered eviction of hawkers from important city roads, both the civic body and the police are reluctant to act. Pedestrians have to risk their lives by walking along busy thoroughfares, only due to these hawkers. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake.

 Apropos ?Nodal agency to tackle bird flu?, October 31, the migratory birds that nest in the city during winter might be infected with bird flu. Hence, the decision of the state animal husbandry department to set up a nodal agency in Salt Lake to monitor possible outbreak of the disease, is a step in the right direction. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia.

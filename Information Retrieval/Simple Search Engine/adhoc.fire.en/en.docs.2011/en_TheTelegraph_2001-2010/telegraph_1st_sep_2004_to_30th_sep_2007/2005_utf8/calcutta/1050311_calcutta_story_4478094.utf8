 ?Kidnap? kid back home 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fourteen-year-old Amit Parbat, who was allegedly whisked away in an autorickshaw on his way to school on Wednesday, returned to his Baruipur home early on Thursday. 

 Amit, a Class IX student of Baruipur High School, admitted that he had fled home ?because he was not well-prepared for his Bengali examination?, police said.

 The Parbat family, however, maintained that Amit was kidnapped and had been physically tortured. He returned without the school uniform that he was wearing when he left home, they pointed out. 

 ?My son told me that he was whisked away at gunpoint on his way to school. Some people took him around in a car all day. They made him call us, asking for Rs 20 lakh. He was finally dropped off near our home,? Amit?s mother Dolly said.

 Amit?s father Anil Parbat, is a Central government employee.

 Inspector-general of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said: ?The boy initially told us that he had been kidnapped. But he broke down under interrogation and admitted that he had left home because he was not prepared for his Bengali paper on Wednesday.? 

 According to Mukherjee, Amit told police that he left home for school but proceeded to Baruipur railway station. There, he called his father from a public booth around 11.15 am. 

 Then, he went to Madarihat, where he sat for some time in a temple. He made the second call from another booth around 12.15 pm, asking for the ransom.

 Amit then went to Burtala More, where he watched a cricket match till 7 pm. 

 After the match, he killed time by wandering about and on realising the futility of his act, decided to return home, Mukherjee added.

 ?Amit told us that he was dropped off close to our residence. He was in a daze and some neighbours brought him home. The kidnappers beat him up, slapped him and hit him with a revolver butt,? mother Dolly said.

 Police said the family contacted Baruipur police station right after the boy?s return.

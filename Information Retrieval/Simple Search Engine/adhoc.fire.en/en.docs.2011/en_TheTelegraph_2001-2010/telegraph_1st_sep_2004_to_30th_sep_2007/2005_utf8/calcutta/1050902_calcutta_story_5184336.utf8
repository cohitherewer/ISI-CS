The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Puja tours, special schemes at travel fair

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Old wine in a new bottle is how Sanjiv Agarwal, chairman and managing director, Fairfest Media, describes the 43rd Travel and Tourism Fair. But this time, there?s more wine in the bottle, too.

 The first event at the Netaji Indoor Stadium after its refurbishment is set to begin on September 3. Around 150 participants ? travel agencies, airlines and hotel chains, as well as 21 state and 10 country tourism boards ? have signed up to showcase their wares in 200 stalls. 

 The additions this time at the fair, organised by Fairfest Media, include Egypt, the UK, Switzerland and Sri Lanka. 

 Singapore and Malaysia are back with a big bang, while states like Jharkhand, Uttaranchal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Karnataka are here in a bigger way than last year.

 In 2004, there were 30,000 visitors to the fair. Expectations are of a similar number this time, too. 

 ?We have again priced the entry tickets at Rs 25. Mumbai is Rs 20, while in the other cities, it?s free. Nothing can match the numbers in Calcutta,? says Agarwal.

 The international participants are more in Mumbai ? it accounts for 40 per cent of outbound travel in India, compared with only five per cent from Calcutta. 

 But Agarwal feels that this year, there will be more international bookings from Calcuttans at the fair, and more outbound travel during the Pujas. ?Prices are low, it?s more affordable, there are more choices and the marketing is aggressive,? he explained.

 The state tourism boards entering the fray in partnership with private players proves that this sector is coming of age, adds Agarwal. 

 In addition, as always, during the three-day fair, from September 3 to 5, there will be spot bookings on offer, as well as special packages and schemes for Puja and winter holiday tourists.

 There is a wide range of holidays on offer, starting from as low as Rs 200 per person per day, explained the chairman and managing director. The reason is participation from small, medium and big players at the event. 

 The travel and tourism fair will be inaugurated by state tourism minister Dinesh Dakua and sports and transport minister Subhash Chakraborty on Saturday at the stadium. 

 Several state tourism ministers will be in town for the event, as well as the chief minister of Jharkhand, Arjun Munda. Some of the states will also host cultural shows at their stalls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Youth vs youth leader 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sanjay Bakshi, known more as a rogue on the roads than a youth leader, finally has a fight on his hands. And ironically, it?s from a young man, the victim of Bakshi?s latest fit of fury.

 ?I am afraid. If anything untoward happens to me, Sanjay Bakshi will be responsible. But I will not take back my complaint. He is a youth representative, and I want to show him what the youth can do,? pledged Vivek Sharma, hours after struggling through Friday?s Higher Secondary (HS) papers.

 On Thursday afternoon, an altercation on CR Avenue had resulted in the 18-year-old being bashed up by the Trinamul Youth Congress president.

 On Friday evening, Vivek sat at his Haldarbagan home, his face bearing marks of the assault and bandages, lamenting how he could not complete his HS papers.

Despite Vivek?s predicament, police failed to arrest 

Bakshi, on a ruse they had used in an earlier assault case ? that the Trinamul 

leader could not be traced .

 When Metro contacted Bakshi on his mobile phone on Friday afternoon, he claimed to be home.

 ?An arrest warrant has been issued in Bakshi?s name, and we will find him eventually. We conducted raids at his house last night and today, but he was not there. If he says he was at home, he?s lying,? claimed Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 Asked if he had led the police team that had raided Bakshi?s residence, Kumar retorted: ?Of course not, I am a deputy commissioner and he is a petty criminal. Officers from the local police station are enough to tackle him.?

 Elaborating on the delay in carrying out the arrest, senior police officers said an investigation was conducted throughout Thursday, and by the time Vivek?s complaint was established as genuine, Bakshi could not be traced.

 ?Our officers spoke to witnesses on the spot where the boy was beaten up. When we came to know that his complaint was genuine, police went to Bakshi?s house, but he was not there,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Bakshi, meanwhile, hardly sounded perturbed by the turn of events. 

 ?This is a politically motivated conspiracy, masterminded by the ruling CPM. If they have an arrest warrant with my name on it, they can go ahead and arrest me, but police have not contacted me... I am a political leader and I will fight this politically,? he announced.

 Vivek?s father, R.K. Sharma, a doctor attached with Unesco, said the teenager was suffering from trauma and was in considerable pain, hampering his ability to write his exams.

 ?I had prepared thoroughly for the two economic geography papers on Friday, but I just could not write properly. I am afraid I won?t get admitted to a college of my choice,? Vivek lamented.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A brand by another name

 Without being called IBM, can Lenovo computers make their way from the KBC sets to drawing rooms?

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay 

 I have this weekend escort duty. The destination often varies geographically but seldom alters in character. Once we reach the mall or the supermarket, I am allowed to roam around but never permitted to leave the premises. Last weekend I was enjoying one such interlude of freedom. This is when I saw the stall selling computers. I was delighted. My enthusiasm got slightly dampened when I saw that they had only one notebook and one desktop on display. Both were IBM products; at least so said the mark on the machines. Yet, what seemed strange to me was that the stall itself had a different branding. Lenovo was written boldly and prominently in multiple banners.

 The name rang a bell, but I could not immediately recall where I had seen it before. Then the picture of Big B in his cool seat of KBC II flashed through my mind. His Computerji of late is also sporting the name Lenovo.

 I looked at the machines on display; they sure had the IBM logo and the appropriate sub-branding of the Think range ? Thinkpad, Thinkcentre, etc. I was a little perplexed. So I spoke to the man who looked like the boss of the stall. He was kind and patient with me. A summary of what he told me would read like this: Sir, do not get bothered by all this naming business. The most important thing for you to know is that these computers are made by IBM and they will be serviced by IBM. I am guaranteeing you this. At this juncture duty beckoned and I had to rush off.

 Back home, the World Wide Web enlightened me. It informed me of an intercontinental marriage. The Lenovo site said: ?In 1984, not long after the personal computing division of IBM was founded, 11 computer scientists in Beijing, China, also had a vision ? to create a company that would bring the advantages of information technology to the Chinese people. In 2003, Legend changed its brand name to Lenovo, taking the ?Le? from Legend, and adding ?novo? the Latin word for new to reflect the spirit of innovation at the core of the company. With Lenovo?s landmark acquisition of IBM?s personal computing division in May 2005, the new Lenovo is a leader in the global PC market...?

 What a marriage! I was truly lost in this fairytale. Yet the original unease in my mind resurfaced. What exactly has been acquired by Lenovo? It is obvious that IBM?s personal computing division with all its assets and liabilities now belongs to Lenovo. All its assets, except one perhaps. The right to use the name IBM has possibly not been given to Lenovo. The billion-dollar issue is, how crucial is that? The website tells us that in the home PC market Lenovo is on its own. Yet it is the home PC consumer who is clueless about motherboards and chips, hard disc capacities and processing speeds. He necessarily depends on brand names. Stripping of the IBM name would surely be a serious handicap.

 Eleven wise men from Beijing must have known the implication. Or did they err by defining the business in terms of technology rather than brands? It is unlikely that they mistook Thinkcentre and Thinkpads as operative brand names. Or maybe the IBM name was never up for sale. Whatever the reason, Lenovo now needs to build its brand beyond the Great Wall. It needs to take on giants like Compaq and Dell. That will take some doing. Even in India, the market is competitive with the added complication of the segment called assembled computers. Even here, branding Computerji in KBC can only be an innocuous first step.

 Make no mistake, this will be the marketing battle to watch.

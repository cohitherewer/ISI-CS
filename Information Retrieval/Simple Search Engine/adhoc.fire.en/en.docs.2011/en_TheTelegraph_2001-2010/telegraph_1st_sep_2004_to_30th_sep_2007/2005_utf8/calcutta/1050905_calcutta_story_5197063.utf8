 To the moon and back

 Colin Farrell: India bound

Lisa Ray in Water: Bollywood or Hollywood 

 It?s spawned many a raging controversy but after 

many a struggle Deepa Mehta is finally ready to unleash Water to the world. 

The third of her elemental trilogy, after Fire and 1947 Earth, Water 

will open the 30th Toronto International Film Festival on Wednesday.

 The film, which was originally planned to be shot in Varanasi with Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Akshay Kumar, had to be finally shot in Sri Lanka with Seema Biswas, Lisa Ray and John Abraham last year. The protests in Varanasi were so traumatic that Deepa temporarily sidelined the project and went on to make the light romantic comedy Bollywood Hollywood.

 Shot with the working title of River Moon to avoid further controversies, Water is set in pre-independent India. The film, seen through the eyes of an eight-year-old widow Chuyia, revolves around the lives of the residents of a widows? ashram. It is in the ashram that 20-year-old widow Kalyani (Lisa Ray) breaks tradition and falls for a young Gandhian (John Abraham), who forces the widows to question their faith.

Water is expected to release commercially some 

time in November.

Desi deal

 Colin Farrell might not be good enough to step into 

the shoes of Pierce Brosnan, but he looks set to do what Roger Moore, Patrick 

Swayze, Matt Damon and Toby Stephens have done before ? come to India on assignment.

 Farrell has signed Tree of Life, co-funded by Sahara One Motion Pictures, 30 per cent of which is slated to be shot in India.

 Apart from the Alexander star in one of the leads, two more Hollywood stars would be roped in but it?s not yet known whether the film produced by Donald Rosenfeld will feature any Bollywood names.

 ?Pre-production of the film is slated to commence in January 2006, and the release is expected some time in 2008,? said Shantonu Aditya, CEO, Sahara One.

 Tree of Life will be scripted and directed by Terrence Malick whose forthcoming release is the Farrell-starrer The New World, to hit theatres in November 2005.

 Producer Rosenfeld ran Merchant Ivory Productions between 1987-1998 where he produced several films including Howard?s End and Remains of the Day. Emmanual Lubezki is the proposed director of photography.

?We will get to know the storyline, the final cast 

and the shooting locations only after January,? said a source in Sahara. The budget 

is pegged at around US $ 500 to 600 m.

 Art and soul

 A treasure-trove of visual delight, the ongoing exhibition of paintings of Subhomita Bhattacharjee Dinda, Partha Bhattacharjee (The Puzzle Game; picture left) and Sanatan Dinda embodies a group of work that transcends the boundaries imposed by time and space to evoke a world of fanciful, dreamlike abstractions that are yet meaningful on close observation. Presenting their current crop of work, their canvases, though not set up within the confines of a theme, nevertheless illustrate a commonality of purpose. Setting out to conquer space, texture and form with fervour, the paintings are marked by a youthful buoyancy and a strong sense of conviction in interpretation. Depicting beautiful, sensuous and, at times, inscrutable female forms, often in solitude, the paintings express the artists yearning for a liberation of the soul from the clutches of a rationalist universe and a search for religious experience in a corrupt, dark and sordid world.

 Event: Exhibition of the recent works of Subhomita Bhattacharjee Dinda, Partha Bhattacharjee and Sanatan Dinda

 When: Till today, 3 pm - 8 pm

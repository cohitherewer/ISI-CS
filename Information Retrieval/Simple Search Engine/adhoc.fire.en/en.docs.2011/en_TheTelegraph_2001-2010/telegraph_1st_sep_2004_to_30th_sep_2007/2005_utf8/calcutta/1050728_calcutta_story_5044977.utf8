Jessica Biel: Action cut 

Man machine match-up

In director Rob Cohen?s newest action adventure, Stealth, 

U.S. Navy pilots Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) and Henry Purcell 

(Jamie Foxx) are part of a close-knit elite division of test pilots flying highly 

classified stealth fighter jets. Then commanding officer Captain George Cummings 

(Sam Shepard) introduces the team to their new wingman ? an artificial intelligence-based 

UCAV (Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle), nicknamed EDI. 

 To the team?s amazement, EDI proves to be a cracker-jack wingman. But on the return trip to base aboard aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, EDI is struck by lightning, expanding its brain. But Cummings declares EDI ready to rejoin the team. 

 On their next mission, EDI?s problems only get worse. Ben decides the risks of the attack outweigh the benefits to the team. When he aborts the mission, EDI goes against orders. The danger escalates when EDI decides to execute a top-secret mission that could spiral into a nuclear Armageddon?

 ?I really thought there was a way to create an intense experience in the air,? says Cohen, ?not dissimilar to the way I depicted drag racing in The Fast And The Furious or the avalanche in XXX.? He was fascinated by a recent technological advance called Tergen (terrain generator), developed by Digital Domain, which would give him the ability to create virtual backgrounds. ?So, if you want to fly over the mountains in Tajikistan, you dial up the real maps of those mountains,? he explains. ?From there you can create the actual terrain and, once it?s virtual, match it to whatever you want.? 

 Stealth is about war and technology. ?What will be the consequences when computers become smarter, faster, more creative, self-generating and self-replicating? If they have control of our energy, they have control of our communication systems and of our military systems. What happens when they decide, in their evolution, to exercise free will??

 The action in Stealth revolves around a prototype of a computer-driven aircraft, EDI (Extreme Deep Invader), referred by the military as a UCAV. ?In the film, we examine technology and what happens to the nature of war when the technical equation shifts because America has the ability to create a capable air force of smart drones, like EDI. This capability already exists, it?s not science fiction. It?s where we?re heading. The Navy told me they will no longer be ordering jets for human pilots.?

 Catch the film in Calcutta halls next Friday.

Matt Lucas and David Walliams: Fun funda

 Just ?who are Britain?? Well, according to award-winning comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams, the British Isles are packed with surreal stereotypes who have disturbing habits, horrible dress sense, a total lack of self-reflexivity and no idea what ?normal? means. Pack a trip to the world of Little Britain, starting Saturday, July 30 at 10 pm on STAR World.

 An account of British foibles and idiosyncrasies, and an exercise in wild imagination, the two introduce a cast of characters in a series of sketches every week. There?s Vicky Pollard, an incomprehensible girl, the nemesis of many a teacher and social worker. She stubs out her fags, orders snakebite and acts innocent in the face of guilt. She also happens to have elocution problems, although not ineloquent. 

 Emily Howard is an unconvincing transvestite for whom the donning of womanly clothes is more hobby than inclination. Dafydd, the ?only gay in the village?, hails from the Welsh mountain village of Llandewi Breffi. A committed ?homosexualist?, Dafydd is on a mission to out the pretenders, convinced he isn?t the only ?gayer? in his locale.

 Lou and Andy live in a minefield of grotty pubs, grotty swimming pools and food shops called ?supermarkets? in the Midlands. Lou is a ?helper? who helps wheelchair-bound friend Andy. Monosyllabic and grumpy, Andy is pulling the biggest blinkers over the eyes of his oblivious friend ? he gets out of his wheelchair, walks, climbs and even dives when he wants! 

 Lucas and Walliams write and perform all the characters.

Amitabh Bachchan: All over

 Did you pray at Kalighat temple when he was battling with death after the accident on the sets of Coolie? Did you make it a ritual to catch the first day, first show of every film starring him all these years? Do you pick a fight with whoever refuses to call him God? Here?s your chance for recognition.

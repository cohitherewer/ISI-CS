The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The two supports of the footbridge under construction at the base of the Dhakuria 

flyover, towards Dakshinapan Shopping Complex, completely block the footpaths. 

Pedestrians are forced to step on to the road to cross the few feet. It is a known 

fact that vehicles speed on their way down an incline. By forcing pedestrians 

off the footpaths, the authorities have literally laid a death trap for them. 

Instead, the pillars could have been designed in a manner so as to allow people 

to pass through.

 I escorted my son to a nearby school for getting him photographed for the voter?s 

ID card and found that the process is extremely cumbersome. He had to queue up 

thrice over a period of one-and-a-half hours for completing different formalities. 

Many elderly persons found it very difficult. It would be helpful if the Election 

Commission shortens the procedure.

 Of late, there has been a spurt in satta, sale of illicit alcohol and drug 

peddling on Nawab Abdul Latif Street, under Park Street police station. Police 

raid the vice dens, but it seems like the offenders get prior intimation of the 

raids and vacate the spot. The narrow lanes and bylanes also help them give the 

cops the slip.

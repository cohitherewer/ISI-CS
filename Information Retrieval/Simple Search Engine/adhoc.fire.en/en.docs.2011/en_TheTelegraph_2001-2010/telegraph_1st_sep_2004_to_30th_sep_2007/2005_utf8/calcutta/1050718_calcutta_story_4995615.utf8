The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Business thrives in squalid Babughat

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Ramashish Rao, 70, sits on the steps of Babughat and spends his day looking at the murky waters of the Hooghly. Much water has flowed down the river since he came here nearly 40 years ago from his home in Motihari, Bihar. ?This place has seen many changes, but not for the better,? he laments.

 The area known as Babughat is a three-km-odd stretch of Strand Road from the Man-O?-War Jetty to Chandpal Ghat, which has four jetties and five ghats, including Raj Chander Doss?s Ghaut (opened in 1830), or simply Babughat. 

 The entire stretch, despite three extensions of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s Millennium Park, is lined with hillocks of garbage and puddles of urine. Rows after row of buses are lined outside. This is a hang-out of pot smokers, besides being besieged by armies of hawkers. 

 The entrance to the ghat, maintained by the public works department (PWD), is blocked with Brahmins waiting for devotees who perform rituals. The roof of the entrance is so dilapidated that the PWD has slapped a ?no-entry? red tag on it. 

 Piles of garbage left behind by devotees, frames of immersed idols and human excreta welcome visitors. 

 ?We conducted a survey of the Babughat area in 2003 for a beautification project. We submitted the map to the PWD long ago. We don?t know what happened to that project,? said Ashok Dey, assistant engineer of PWD?s survey department.

 If the environs of the ghat are revolting, the VIP entrance to Netaji Indoor Stadium opposite, encircled with pools of urine, is equally nauseating. People from all walks of life also relieve themselves on the outside boundary wall of Circular Rail?s Eden Gardens station. 

 The stand for long-distance buses to and from Orissa and Bihar is like an impregnable wall. ?An estimated 1,000 buses ply on more than 20 routes from here. They bring in and take away about 40,000 passengers daily,? said Tapas Nag, Band Stand parking superviser of the Regional Transport Authority, Calcutta. 

 Besides, at least 40 buses on the Calcutta-Orissa and the Calcutta-Bihar routes park at this stand, and the footfall increases by another 1,200 a day at Babughat.

 Another 20,000 people from Howrah are ferried by Hooghly Nadi Jalapath Paribahan Samanway Samity and West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation . 

 Because of the astounding number of people the area attracts daily, business thrives. Band Stand Bus Terminal Management Committee officers said the private and long-distance express buses register an estimated Rs 25 lakh of business daily at the stand.

 The ferry operators together see an estimated Rs 25,000-worth of daily business at their Babughat and Chandpal units. Hawkers, too, make a killing.

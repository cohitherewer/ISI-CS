The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Temple uplift on track 

 SAHELI MITRA

 The first phase of the Kalighat temple makeover has kicked off, with funds for the Rs 65 crore project flowing in.

 The transformation of the century-old temple into what is billed to be the first eco-heritage tourism site in India is on track.

 Of the Rs 20 crore needed for phase one of the project, Rs 4 crore has been disbursed by the Union tourism ministry.

 ?This will be used in three fields and will go towards a major part of the restoration work,? said Rono Banerjee, creative advisor to the project.

 ?The state government is executing the project through the Calcutta Municipal Corporation on the basis of plans, drawings and designs prepared by the International Foundation for Sustainable Development (IFSD),? explained project director Sibabrata Dutta.

 Phase one will include:

Restoration of the temple complex, for which around Rs 4 crore will be required

An administrative office and pilgrim facilitation centre, costing Rs 62.63 lakh

Around 26 kiosks, at an estimated Rs 32.57 lakh

 To enhance the visual appeal of the area, organised stalls will replace the shops that crowd the vicinity of the temple. ?The kiosks that will come up initially will act as models, built in the typical aatchala style. Shops and stalls along the road will look like small temple structures,? added Banerjee.

 Work on the ambitious project ? conceived by NRI Mridul Pathak ? had so far begun with funds from the IFSD. 

 ?I wish to rope in a few private organisations like Emami and Peerless, as well as nationalised banks that can sponsor certain parts of the structure, like gates and security arrangements,? said Pathak, hoping to raise Rs 15 crore from industry.

 Another Rs 1 crore is pending from the tourism ministry. Funding for the later phases of the project will only be decided after work at hand is completed, for which a 30-month deadline has been set. 

 The irrigation department has completed the first phase of dredging the Adi Ganga. ?The dredging work, amounting to Rs 10 crore, is almost over and the rivulet is now more navigable,? added Dutta.

 This initiative is part of a larger plan to create a water transport network linking all temple sites in and around Calcutta, including Kalighat, Dakshineswar, Belur Math and Mayapur.

 ?The Kalighat temple area has a huge revenue earning potential and once the project is complete, it will become a heritage tourism spot and attract tourists in hordes,? feels a state tourism official.

 Bodies found at soiree site

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The bodies of two criminals were found near the venue of a soiree in Bantra, Howrah, late on Monday.

 One of them has been identified as Sanjay Adak, alias Sanju. There were several cases pending against him, police said. Local residents said the other body was also that of a local goon. Police, however, have not confirmed this.

 The bodies had bullets lodged in them, apart from marks of injuries inflicted with sharp weapons. 

 The heads had been smashed with some heavy object, an officer said. While the bodies have been sent for post-mortem, pipe-guns found on them have been impounded.

 According to a senior police officer, a soiree had been held on Laxman Das Road on Monday night. After the programme, around 2 am, policemen on duty in the area heard gunshots. They stumbled upon the bodies, lying a few yards apart, close to the dais where the function had been held.

 Police said the two criminals had been the terror of Bantra, Shibpur and Howrah for the past few years. Though they used to work together in the past, they had later fallen out. It is suspected that the two had plans to come together again and had decided to meet at the venue of the soiree. 

 Police suspect a rival gang to have seized the opportunity to murder them.

 Another version doing the rounds is that the two criminals had engaged in a drunken brawl after the function. It is possible that they were then lynched by some irate local people, said another officer.

 Five persons have been arrested in connection with the incident.

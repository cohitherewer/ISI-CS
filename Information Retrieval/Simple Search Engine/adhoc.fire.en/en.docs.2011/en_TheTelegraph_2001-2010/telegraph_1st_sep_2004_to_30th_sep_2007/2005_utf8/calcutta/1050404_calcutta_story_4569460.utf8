 Lakhs lifeline for Salt Lake parks

 - REVAMP, REPAIRS AND GAMES ACADEMIES ON THE GROUNDS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Salt Lake civic authorities have decided to renovate the 100-odd parks in the township.

 The decision was taken last week at a meeting of a five-member committee, set up for the development of the parks. ?All the parks, big and small, will be given a facelift,? Bidhannagar Municipality chairman Dilip Gupta said on Sunday. Initially, Rs 20 lakh will be spent on the project. 

 The parks and playgrounds in Salt Lake were earlier maintained by the state urban development department. The parks in Sector I were handed over to the municipality in 1998-99 and those in Sectors II and III, a couple of years ago.

 Civic officials allege that most of the parks were handed over in a sorry state. ?Earlier, we did not have enough funds to maintain the parks. But this time, we are laying special emphasis on them,? Gupta added.

 The boundary walls will be rebuilt, weeds cleared and games equipment reinstalled. ?In many parks, the boundary walls and the equipment are broken,? said Chandan Ghosh, CPM councillor and a member of the committee.

 Trees will be planted beside the green enclosures. ?Every year, the ward committees are provided with funds for plantation. We will request them to plant trees beside the parks,? a municipality official said. 

 Pathways inside the parks will be repaired for use by morning walkers and senior citizens. Residents had long been demanding that the pathways be repaired. ?The senior citizens and morning walkers face a big problem, as most footpaths in the blocks have been encroached upon by the residents and turned into private gardens,? said Ajit Chatterjee, secretary of the Salt Lake Senior Citizens Association. The group has also written to the municipality, drawing its attention to the problem.

 The civic body is also planning handing over some parks and playgrounds to private organisations. 

 As part of the project, Bidhannagar Sports Academy, a wing of the township?s municipality, has revamped the FC Block park. 

 According to Ghosh, the parks will also house academies for various games. ?We will set up a cricket academy and another for football. A basketball coaching camp and other academies are also on our agenda,? councillor Ghosh told Metro. 

 The municipality is planning to raise funds by letting out playgrounds to big clubs. ?We have already finalised plans to let out the ground adjacent to Central Park to two big clubs of the Maidan,? an official said. 

 Welcoming the municipality?s move, Ramen Das, an office-bearer of the Bidhannagar Welfare Association, said: ?This was long overdue and we hope that the parks will now be maintained properly.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Woken up, shot at on pavement

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gunshots woke up residents of Jagmohan Mullick Lane, in Burrabazar, on Wednesday when criminals opened fire on a youth. ?Teastall-owner Pramod Kumar Sharma, 21, was hit on his left thigh. He was admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 According to Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department), two others were injured in the firing.

 Professionals had been engaged for the hit, but they fired at the wrong person, Singh said. The target, it is claimed, was Pramod?s uncle Satyanarayan.

 Around 5.15 am, four men, aged between 25 and 30 and toting improvised pipe-guns, got off a car parked near the Sharmas? tea-stall in Jagmohan Mullick Lane. 

 The men were asleep on cots on the pavement outside the stall, along with several others. The armed men went from cot to cot, lifting the sheets to scan the faces. 

 On finding Pramod, they started berating him in hushed tones. According to witnesses, the youth, still groggy, responded with a gesture. Then, the criminals fired.

 ?I woke up at the sound of the gunshot. I saw Pramod jump out of bed and scamper across the road. He was bleeding profusely and moving with difficulty. The criminals did not chase him,? said driver Ranjit Kumar Rai, 36, who was lying on a cot nearby.

 One of the criminals shot at the fleeing youth, but missed. The bullet hit Rai on his right leg. Rai added that by then, a crowd had started to gather, so the four jumped into the waiting car and sped off.

 Police arrived around 6 am and rushed a semi-conscious Pramod to hospital.

 An officer of Posta police station said that the incident was the fallout of a property dispute that had been settled in court around two years ago.

 ?There has been unrest in the area of late because of the dispute. The owner of a snack shop in the same lane, who is also engaged in promoting buildings, wanted to take over the tea-stall run by Satyanarayan, his brother Manoj and nephew Pramod,? the officer said.

 ?In the past month or so, there had been another attack on the Sharmas and one of the walls of their stall had been razed,? the officer added. The Sharmas hail from Varanasi.

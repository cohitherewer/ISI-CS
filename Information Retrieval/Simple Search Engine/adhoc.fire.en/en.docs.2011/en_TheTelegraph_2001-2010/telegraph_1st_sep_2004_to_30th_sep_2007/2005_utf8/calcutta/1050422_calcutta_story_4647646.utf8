 Silver jubilation 

 It has been 25 years and counting for Joyland Play, Nursery and Kindergarten School. Having nurtured young minds for a quarter of a century, the teachers and toddlers of Joyland celebrated the school?s birthday with a bang. ?We wanted it to be really special,? says Jayati Ghosh, principal and founder. 

 The year started with the Tiny Talent Show, with events like ?the most charming baby show?, ?the most active child?, the most talented in singing, dancing, recitation and acting? and a sit-and-draw.

 At the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Better Kolkata Contest, kids expressed their creativity in the visual and performing arts categories. The theme was appreciation and conservation of the environment. Joining in the efforts of the Joyland toddlers on this occasion were underprivileged children and their mothers of Anandan, an NGO that Joyland has been working with for the past five years.

 The winners of the trophy and merit award put up a play, Ramukaka, about the ill effects of felling trees. The three and four-year-olds dance to Tagore?s Paush toder daak diyechhe. 

 The usual events through the year, like Independence Day celebrations and festivals like Diwali, Holi, Durga Puja, Id and Christmas were all done in a bigger way. For instance, grandparents were invited to school to burst firecrackers and light diyas on Diwali. The sports day of the school at 15/1B Loudon Street in December last year had the tiny tots amazing the adults with yoga asanas.

 In January, a picnic at Millennium Park was the highlight. The celebration climaxed with a fete at Calcutta Club in March, with parents, teachers and children joining in the fun and games. Proceeds from the fete were donated to the welfare fund of Anandan.

 ?It has been a wonderful year,? smiles Ghosh.

 Celebration 

 From 25 to 50. Carmel High School is marking an important milestone this year ? its golden jubilee. Started in Calcutta on April 1, 1956, by Mother Veronica, it is run by the Apostolic Carmel Congregation. 

 Under principal Sister Ann Imelda?s guidance, the next one year, from April 2005 to April 2006, will see a series of events to celebrate the school?s 50th birthday in grand style. 

 The congregation also runs various formal and non-formal institutions, welfare centres, health clinics and children?s homes. Carmel High School is releasing a brochure to commemorate the occasion. 

 The proceeds from the advertisements will be used to create a corpus to offer scholarships to underprivileged children.

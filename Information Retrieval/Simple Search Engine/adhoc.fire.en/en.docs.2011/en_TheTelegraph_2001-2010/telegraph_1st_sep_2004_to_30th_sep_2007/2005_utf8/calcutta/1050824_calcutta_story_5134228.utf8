 Below the AJC Bose flyover, towards Park Circus, a group of men is regularly spotted gambling in broad daylight. Initially, when the flyover was built, the government had made grand plans of how to utilise the space below the highroad. The plans seem to have been restricted to paper. First, local residents started dumping garbage there. Now, it has turned into a gambling den. When would the government?s grand plans, apart from the flyovers, take off?

 The portion of Jessore Road near the Patipukur railway bridge remains perpetually filthy, with garbage from the local vegetable and fish market strewn on the sides. Sometimes the waste piles up into mounds and becomes the cause of traffic snarls, a regular feature in this section of the road. The problems for the pedestrians and vehicles multiply manifold in the rainy season due to formation of puddles in road depressions.

 The public vehicles department has become a money-spinning machine for the state government. The recent hefty increase in road tax and other fees is grossly unjustified in view of shoddy services provided by the department. The latest blow to the car-owners is the introduction of smart cards. The Rs 560 charge for blue book replacement and Rs 140 bill for driving licence replacement is nothing but a ruse to garner easy money for Webel. Whether the law-enforcing authorities are prepared with gadgets to handle the smart cards remains to be seen. The government first needs to introduce smart cards to regulate its employees, but will obviously not do so.

 Of late, the amount of work handled by city post offices has been curtailed drastically due to reduction in telephone tariff and widespread use of email. Despite that, letters continue to disappear. During April and May, I wrote seven missives to a friend, who stays in Haltu. None reached. I request the postal department to do something about letters disappearing en route. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia.

 The forms provided at the Indian Immigration Office are old. The paper is of poor quality and has become discoloured with age. It is high time the office prints new forms. 

 Abdul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Hooghly.

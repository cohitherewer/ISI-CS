 They had disbanded by mutual consent four years ago to take a sabbatical and recharge their batteries. Now, French rock act Louise Attaque is back, rejuvenated with ?new elements? and ready to sway Calcutta (at Bow Barracks on Tuesday, 7 pm) with their eclectic blend of finely-chopped notes.

 ?We never really parted. It was just a pause, when we decided to try out different things in 2001. We didn?t know then when we would end the break. But now we have regrouped, making music together again and it?s exciting,? Arnaud Samuel, the violinist in the quartet, told Metro on Monday.

 The group arrived in town late on Sunday following ?very successful? gigs in Mumbai and Bangalore. The city concert is presented by Alliance Francaise de Calcutta and The Telegraph, in collaboration with Bow United Organisation.

 Singer-lyricist Gaetan Roussel is equally buoyed by the comeback caravan, which started rolling in St Petersburg and Moscow and is set to take in South America after the Indian tour. ?We never reunited with any structured agenda, but decided to put on the table ideas that had fomented during the lay-off,? he said.

 The break saw Gaetan team up with Arnaud to form the duo Tarmac, while bassist Robin Feix and drummer Alexandre Magraff collaborated on hip-hop and bass-n-drums pieces as Ali Dragon. Before the second coming in Russia happened, the melting pot of fresh ideas threw up a motley mix that the band now tries to add to their repertoire.

 ?Our first album was purely acoustic and folksy, but then we changed tracks and just tried to express ourselves in our second effort (Comme on a dit). It?s important to reveal your individuality and take care of your ego and we hope the individual inputs add up to a meaningful collective expression,? observed Arnaud, who loves Vivaldi.

 ?Yes, now we have a lot of electric and electronic stuff to go with our acoustic pieces,? confirms Robin, hugely influenced by Violent Femmes bass player Brian Ritchie. In their third studio album, being readied for a September release, Louise Attaque have incorporated new elements like reggae, also including for the first time, some instrumental numbers and a lot of ?live recording?.

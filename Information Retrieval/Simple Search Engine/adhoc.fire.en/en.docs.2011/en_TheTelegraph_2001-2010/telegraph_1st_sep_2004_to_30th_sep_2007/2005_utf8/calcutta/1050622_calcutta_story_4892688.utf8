 Vaccine against viral scourge of infants 

 - Trials await nod for bug that brings on dysentery, death

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The deadly ?rota virus? is responsible for the deaths of more than 1.8 lakh children across the country, and at least 150 admissions a day in hospitals across Calcutta. Most infant victims are down with acute dehydration, with a few suffering from permanent brain damage and even death.

 All that is set to change, with the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) gearing up to conduct a Phase III trial (human) of the first-ever vaccine that can make a child immune to the virus that causes diarrhoea and, in extreme cases, death.

 ?We are getting ready to conduct the trials in Calcutta from next month. It should continue for some weeks before we find out the efficacy of the vaccine,? said Sekhar Bhattacharya, NICED director.

 Apart from Calcutta, Vellore, Chandigarh and Pune are the other centres where similar trials will be carried out, once the government gives the formal approval.

 ?Since the vaccine has already been launched in a foreign country (Mexico), we have decided to straightaway conduct a Phase III trial to reconfirm its efficiency,? Bhattacharya said.

 Rota virus, which looks like a wheel, causes acute intestinal viral infection, resulting in fever, vomiting and severe diarrhoea, which leads to dehydration and hospitalisation.

 ?In Calcutta, rota virus has emerged as a major trigger for watery diarrhoea that can have severe repercussions. The count of patients we receive round-the-clock is mind-boggling,? said paediatrician Subhasis Bhattacharya of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.

 According to moderate estimates, about 25 cases of diarrhoea with rota virus-like symptoms are admitted in city hospitals every day. Throughout the world, the virus, which is transmitted through the faecal-oral route, causes 440,000 deaths every year. 

 In other words, rota virus kills a child every minute. In India, over 100,000 child deaths are reported on account of the virus every year.

 With no chance of curbing infection, the community of scientists as well as doctors are keeping their fingers crossed, hoping that the trials for the vaccine are carried out quickly before it can be formally launched in India.

 ?We are avidly looking at India to give the world the vaccine that can save so many lives in the country and elsewhere. A few shots of the vaccine will protect the child from the virus. The virus might still attack a child later, but he or she will not get affected at all,? said Joseph Bresee, medical epidemiologist at the viral gastroenteritis section of the Centers of Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA.

 The virus is highly infectious and hardy and can live on objects for days before attacking infants between six and 24 months of age. Vomiting is the first symptom of an attack. ?The youngest infants are at the greatest risk. The symptoms of rota virus are similar in both developing as well as developed countries,? Bhattacharya added.

 Bomb haul, arrests in pre-poll raids

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city police on Thursday continued raiding hideouts across the city to round up criminals in the run-up to the civic polls on June 19.

 In a drive on Thursday, officers of detective department?s election cell ? a special wing formed a month back ? recovered more than a crore chocolate bombs from a godown on Kaliprasanna Singha Road, in north Calcutta.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of detective department, said: ?Acting on a tip-off, sleuths raided the godown in Cossipore around 1 pm on Thursday and found the bombs, weighing more than 5,000 kg, in jute bags. The owner of the storehouse managed to flee.? 

 Police are yet to ascertain why the huge consignment was stored in the godown.

 Meanwhile, officers of the south division executed 20 pending arrest warrants. ?Altogether 80 persons were rounded up. Two firearms, 40 crude bombs and more than 400 litres of illicit liquor were seized in overnight raids,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, south division.

 Over the past week, city police and their counterparts in North and South 24-Parganas have arrested at least 2,500 persons with criminal antecedents. 

 ?The decision of making the arrests was taken at a high-level meeting headed by senior officers. The efforts were initiated to ensure a peaceful election,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 As a precautionary measure, police have prepared a list of sensitive areas where chances of political clashes are high. 

 ?Bhogalpara and Barabagan slums, home to south Calcutta?s notorious dons Shahzada and Sheikh Vinod, are under scanner. We are planning to cordon off the areas from the night before the polls,? said an officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Goons operating in Rajabazar slums, Harijan Bustee, Number 15 Bustee, Narkeldanga slums and Channa Sil Lane are giving cops of the eastern suburban division a tough time.

 ?There are reports that political parties are roping in goons from outside Calcutta also,? said a senior officer. ?This time, officers who will be in charge of polling booths will be provided cell phone re-charge coupons so that they can be contacted by senior officers anytime,? he added.

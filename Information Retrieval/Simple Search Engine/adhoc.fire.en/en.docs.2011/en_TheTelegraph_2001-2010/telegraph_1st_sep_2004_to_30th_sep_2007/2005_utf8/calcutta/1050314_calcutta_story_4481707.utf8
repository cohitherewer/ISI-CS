 Brought to book, at last

 - Asiatic society library publishes names of defaulters in bulletin

 Exactly a year ago to the month, Asiatic Society had started the exercise of taking stock of its collection, that is a vast treasure trove of rare books and journals, manuscripts, coins and other artefacts, many of which have gone missing under mysterious circumstances. 

 The last time such an exercise had been undertaken was 60 years ago. Allegations involving influential public figures and scholars associated with this institution of national importance have added grist to the rumour mill down the years.

 During physical verification of the books in the collection, it was noticed that many of the books had disappeared. Among the missing books were many that had been borrowed from the library and never returned. So, the Asiatic Society authorities went public on this issue, and published the list of defaulters in its monthly bulletin dated January 14.

 The list covers three pages, with 25 to 30 names on each page, adding up to 92 members, who had borrowed 155 volumes between 1964 and 2004. Many of the defaulters had taken three books, which is the maximum number of books a member is allowed to borrow. Some defaulters have returned the books ever since the list was published. Some are dead.

 Among the defaulters are eminent historian, the ailing Bratindra Nath Mukherjee, and Pabitra Sarkar, research professor of Asiatic Society involved in a dictionary project, who gets an honorarium of Rs 8,000 per month from the Society. The three books he had borrowed in 1979 are Critical Study of Sanskrit, Studies in Indian Linguistics and Outline of Indian Philosophy. Former teacher Hussanur Rahman had borrowed Sufis of Bijapore in 1995. Among the other defaulters are A.K. Samanta, former police officer, and art collector Mukunda Lath.

 Some people, not public figures but closely associated with the Society, also figure on the list. Ashok Mukherjee is a member of the staff who is also a defaulter, and so are Ratna Basu, library committee member, and M. Firoze, council member of Asiatic Society?s governing body. Ratna Basu had borrowed Kamasutra in June 12, 2002. It is, however, doubtful whether this exercise will goad the moribund Society into a flurry of intellectual activity.

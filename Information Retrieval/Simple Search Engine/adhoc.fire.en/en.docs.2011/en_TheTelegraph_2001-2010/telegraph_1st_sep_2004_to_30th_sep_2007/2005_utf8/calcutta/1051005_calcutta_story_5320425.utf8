The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dipak Ghosh

 Puja theme-maker

 The organisers are asking for equally elaborate themes, but forcing us to do them within the restricted space. This is putting pressure on us, the artistes. At Mudiali Club, for instance, I am doing a replica of Mukteshwar temple. Since the puja is held on a road, all the new rules apply to it. The entrance of the actual temple is 2.5 ft by 5 ft, presumably to ensure that people enter with heads bowed. But the organisers made me make the gate 12 feet wide, citing some fire brigade rule. The entire facade is ruined. The pandal has deviated a lot from the original now. The ban on fireworks was a positive move. Couldn?t the authorities control the traffic methodically rather than forcing these curbs on us?

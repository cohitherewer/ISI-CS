 One rerun in JU tests

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The examinee count on Jadavpur University?s main campus and Salt Lake campus dropped to one again on Friday.

 The university authorities, meanwhile, have neither arrived at a decision on what to do with the replies handed in by the showcaused students, nor declared the date for the next executive council?s meeting. 

 University teachers entered the scene on Friday by offering to function as mediators between the students and the authorities.

 ?Only one final-year student of the IT department on the Salt Lake campus appeared for the semester examination held today. We will carry on with the agitation until the university authorities inform us about their decision,? said Amit Chakraborty, general secretary of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu). 

 ?We want the executive council to meet at the earliest and we want it to reject the Prof Amit Sen inquiry commission report at the meeting,? he added.

 Members of the Jadavpur University Teachers? Association (JUTA) held another meeting to discuss the impasse, even as students of the entire science faculty continued to boycott classes.

 The JUTA special general meeting on an emergency basis lasted four hours, and its executive council finally decided that it would ask the students and Fetsu representatives to restore normalcy on the campus and return to the examination halls for the semester examinations. It resolved to appeal to the vice-chancellor to ensure that justice is done by the five show-caused students.

 ?There were two resolutions tabled in the JUTA meeting today, but only the first was passed,? said C.R. Mandal, chairman of JUTA.

 The first resolution read that JUTA was deeply concerned over the present situation and appealed to the student community to restore normalcy, and urged Fetsu to reconsider its decision regarding boycott of semester examinations. 

 JUTA will meet with the vice-chancellor in this matter to appeal to him and the executive council to ensure that justice is done. JUTA further decided to act as mediator to resolve the current impasse.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Time to take an ad break

 Exactly one year after shooting Parineeta, PRADEEP SARKAR was back in the city on a commercial assignment with the same team that had helped him capture the classic on celluloid. And Dada?s magic shone again, reports Pratim D. Gupta

 November 4, 2004: Straight from Siliguri, Pradeep Sarkar and his team start their 40-day Calcutta shoot of Parineeta.

 November 4, 2005: Flying in from Mumbai, Sarkar and his team start a two-day Calcutta schedule for a Parachute commercial.

 It?s quite amazing,? smiles the veteran ad film-maker waiting for the camera to be set up for the next shot in a guest house in south Calcutta on Saturday. ?As if life?s come full circle.?

 One year on, Sarkar?s Parineeta team hasn?t changed a single bit ? Natararajan aka Nutty behind the camera, actor-choreographer Howard Rosemeyer assisting him, wife Panchali Sarkar as executive producer and Tanushree Sarkar in charge of the art department.

 ?I like to work with the same team,? Sarkar clarifies. ?It?s like a well-oiled machinery working round the year on advertisements. So, once we are ready to start a feature film, there?s no rust and we can just roll.?

 But for this 2005 assignment, Sarkar doesn?t have his favourite Vidya Balan on his monitor. Neither does he have the luxury of yelling ?Saif? into his cordless microphone or requesting Sanjay ?Sir? Dutt to give another extra take. 

 The only cast member of his minutely-detailed Parachute storyboard this time is southern superstar Shriya Saran, who?s just upstaged the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Ayesha Takia to bag Rajnikanth?s next Tamil film Shivaji, to be directed by the prolific Shankar.

 Delighted to work with Dada ? a Sarkar, not a Ganguly ? Shriya, who?s been in a Bollywood film too (Shukriya opposite Aftab Shivdasani), is ready to climb up and down the same staircase dozens of times till Sarkar gets his perfect shot with the hair whiplashing the lens.

 ?She is my wife?s friend?s daughter,? Dada reveals. ?I had helped her feature alongside Madhuri Dixit in the Sony show Kahin Na Kahin Koi Hai. She is supposedly huge in the south now. For this particular commercial, I needed someone with a nice face and she?s just fine.?

 Just back from Rajasthan, Sarkar is upbeat about Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Eklavya which was shot in the deserts and havelis of Udaipur, Jaipur and Bikaner. Being the visual director for the film, he has sketched every frame himself. 

 ?Ashadharon hoyechhe,? Sarkar says of the film that stars Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff, Vidya Balan, Raima Sen and Sharmila Tagore in a special role. ?Mr Chopra has written it very well and it?s going to be a great watch. We have all shot like crazy in all that heat.?

 That will take some time to hit the screens with the Munnabhai MBBS sequel, Rajkumar Hirani?s Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi, yet to make it to the halls. Both Eklavya and Munna 2 are at various stages of post-production.

 But being away from Mumbai for two months for the Eklavya shoot has meant Sarkar losing out on many an ad film. ?I had lost four months for Parineeta and now this. So for six months in one year, my production company (Apocalypso Film Works) was just kept shut. That?s not really a great idea.?

Does that mean he regrets switching to feature films and making one of the year?s biggest hits? ?Making movies is, of course, creatively a lot more satisfying than ads,? admits Sarkar. ?It?s a lot more exciting, too. But making ads is my profession and it?s difficult not to do it for a long stretch of time.?

 Parineeta remains his most special phenomenon. ?It felt so funny doing the director?s commentary for the DVD edition. I have never heard the foreign directors commenting on their movies when I have watched Hollywood DVDs. Ja mone eschhilo bole gechhilam.?

 So after Parachute in Calcutta, it?s going to be more of Parachute in Mumbai and then some Kurkure. ?I plan to shoot one ad after the other and make up for all the time I have lost,? smiles Sarkar.

 But when do we get to see a Pradeep Sarkar film again? ?I am going through a lot of stories ? novels and originals,? he reveals. ?But I am yet to zero in on any one. Once we finalise the story, I will start writing the script parallel to the ads and then choose the location.?

 You never know, Dada being Dada, it may just be Destination Calcutta again!

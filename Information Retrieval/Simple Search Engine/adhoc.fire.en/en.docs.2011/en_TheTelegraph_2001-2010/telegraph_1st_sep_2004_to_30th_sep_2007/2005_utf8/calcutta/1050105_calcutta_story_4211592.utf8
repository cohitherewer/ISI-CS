The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sneak peek, spring and summer style

The past few years have seen designers from Calcutta 

creating ripples at the Lakm? India Fashion Week (LIFW), the most prestigious 

platform for showcasing designer wear in the country. 

 The list of designers from this city participating in LIFW is increasing with every passing year and this April may see a new entrant in the big league ? Shantanu Goenka.

 The young designer has been specialising in bridal wear for the last six years, but it?s his pret line that he wants to showcase at LIFW 2005. That is, if he gets the nod of the jury which will give him the go-ahead to participate. 

 ?I have already become a member of the Fashion Design Council of India, which organises LIFW. And now I will appear before a jury that will decide if I get to participate,? said Shantanu.

The outfit sported by model Sharan Mishra in the picture 

by Rashbehari Das is one that he has designed for the LIFW jury. 

 ?I have designed four-five outfits so far and if I am chosen I?ll develop the whole line which will be called Eliza?s Tea Party. It will also be my offering for spring-summer 2005,? informed Shantanu. ?I am very satisfied with the way the collection has shaped up and I hope it pleases the jury,? he added.

 The look

Eliza?s Tea Party has a vintage look and the designer 

promises that the clothes will remind one of the Hollywood classic My Fair 

Lady. ?The clothes have a typical 1920s English feel to them. They are ultra 

feminine, romantic and soft,? he said.

 The clothes are essentially western in essence, without any influence of the ethnic. Skirts and calf-length dresses dominate the line. 

In layers

The layering technique, a strong trend in designer 

wear right now, has been used extensively in the garments. And this has been done 

using various kinds of fabrics in one outfit. 

 Pretty prints

Floral prints portray the feminine feel, with lots 

of colourful rose motifs used to bring about an overtly romantic effect.

 The designer has steered clear of jarring ornamentation. Delicate embellishments like hand-made velvet flowers and ruffled trimmings have been used to enhance the retro feel.

Fabric feel

In creating the Eliza look, Shantanu has used light 

and flowing fabrics like silk, French lace, velvet, chiffon, silk-jute blends 

and tweeds. ?Each of these fabrics fall beautifully against a woman?s body,? said 

the designer.

 Even the jackets drape well and are liquid in feel, with the lining being removed from most of them. Several layers of lace and velvet ensure a soft touch for most of the ensembles.

Colour capers

In keeping with the essence of the ultra-feminine 

theme and also to ensure a summery feel, the palette has been kept soft and fresh. 

 Pale rose pink, lavender aquamarine, light green, olive, ochre and earthy hues rule the range. 

 ?Colours are just as important as fabrics and styles, as each hue can help make a different statement each time. The entire palette is refreshing and soft. Loud, bright shades are an absolute no no in this collection,? stressed Shantanu.

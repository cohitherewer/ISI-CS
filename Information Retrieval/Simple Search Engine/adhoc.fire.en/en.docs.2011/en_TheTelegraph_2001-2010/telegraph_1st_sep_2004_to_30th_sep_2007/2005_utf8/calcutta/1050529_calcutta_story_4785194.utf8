Life

 Small talk

 What would we do without cine saga? What we see on screen is just the tip of the iceberg. Take a peek at the inside story as you go scuba diving to beat the heat.

 Starry romance

 Just when you thought the Brad and Jolie romance was getting a little stale to warm up for the weekend, the lady in question busts all speculation by flatly denying the whole thing. She couldnt ever consider dating a married man when her own father cheated on her mother, she cries. Looks like her adopted son Maddox is the only guy in her life at the moment, apart from her string of maintenance men that is! But then its Hollywood and looks like the romance season there is far from over yet. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are the hottest love birds, cooing (and kissing) loud enough for all to hear. And a love-starved, star-struck world is all ears.

 Bolly boo

 Bollywood is embroiled in controversy yet again, this time over the depiction of some objectionable scenes in the highly ignorable Jo Bole So Nihaal. The twin blasts in Delhi earlier in the week and subsequent pack-up of the film from theatres across the country calls for a heated debate on the issue of freedom of speech or the pettiness of we the people or the plain stupidity of it all. 

 Last word

 Finally, spare a thought for how the world of films lost Sunil Dutt and Ismail Merchant on the same day. Touch upon Dutts charitable ways or Merchants kitchen craft to be heard above the obit din.

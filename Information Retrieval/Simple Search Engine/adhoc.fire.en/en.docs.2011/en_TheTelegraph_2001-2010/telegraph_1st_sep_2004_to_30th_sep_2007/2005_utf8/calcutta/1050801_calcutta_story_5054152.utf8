 Even as it presses for the rehabilitation of settlers along railway tracks, the state government has taken a completely different stand on the re-instatement of shop-owners. 

 The state is taking on Eastern Railway in a division bench of Calcutta High Court demanding land for the settlers along Rabindra Sarobar. Paradoxically, it has told the same division bench that it will not rehabilitate about 200 shop-owners of the Garfa area, who are to be evicted during the extension of Prince Anwar Shah Road to EM Bypass.

 Providing land for the rehabilitation of the shop-owners was not a compulsion as the area in question has been acquired for greater public interest, counsel for the state held.

 Shop-owners of Janapriya Market, in east Calcutta, had moved court challenging the eviction notice. Additional government pleader Debasish Kar Gupta argued that the case was not maintainable and the petitioners had no right to start such a suit.

 ?The shop-owners are not street vendors. They had put up their structures on a plot that does not belong to them. The land is now required for the construction of a very important road, which will connect greater Calcutta with the southern part of the city,? Kar Gupta asserted.

 He informed the court that Prince Anwar Shah Road was being extended to connect Raja Subodh Mullick Road with EM Bypass.

 ?The proposed road will pass though Dhakuria, Garfa and Kalikapur. People of a vast area will benefit from the construction of the road,? Kar Gupta explained. 

 He and his junior Somnath Dey told the court that 80 per cent of the construction work for the four-km road was ready. ?The rest of work cannot be taken up due to resistance by the shop-owners,? the lawyers said.

 The petitioners had moved a public interest litigation requesting the court to direct the government to make arrangements for their rehabilitation before they are evicted.

 A division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly, admitted the petition on Friday and asked the state to file an affidavit. The matter will be heard after a couple of weeks.

 The lawyers appearing for the petitioners argued that as per the national policy on street vendors, the state could not evict a single shop-owner of the market without providing them with an alternative establishment.

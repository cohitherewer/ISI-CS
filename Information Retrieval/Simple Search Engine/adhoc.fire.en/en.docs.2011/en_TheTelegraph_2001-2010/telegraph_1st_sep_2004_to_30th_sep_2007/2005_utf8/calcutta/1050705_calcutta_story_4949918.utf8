 Protest over death disrupts trains

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Citu-backed hawkers blocked train tracks for over two hours at Bidhannagar Road station, in Eastern Railway?s Sealdah division, after one person, who they claimed was a hawker, was run over on Monday during an eviction drive.

 A large contingent of Railway Protection Force (RPF) and railway officials started the drive at 11 am, while members of Pashchim Banga Railway Hawkers Union were holding a protest rally. 

 The trouble started after a tea stall on platform 4 was razed by the authorities. The hawkers protested the move and an argument ensued. 

 ?The police and RPF started beating up a hawker, who jumped on to the tracks in a bid to escape. He tripped and fell near platform 3 and was run over by a long-distance train,? alleged Nepaldeb Bhattacharya, general secretary of the union.

 The incident occurred around 1.15 pm. Hawkers squatted on the tracks from 2 pm to 4.10 pm, disrupting services on the Main line, and on the Bongaon and Dankuni sections. 

 Bhattacharya announced that Citu workers would gherao the divisional railway manager, Sealdah, on Tuesday and meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 ?The railway minister had pledged that hawkers at platforms would get licences and the railway board is finalising the proposal,? the union leader claimed.

 Art of reconciliation

 Modern art tries to relate to its social surroundings in such a way as to decipher reason and meaning from the cluttered heap of our emotions and experiences. The exhibition of paintings by Kamal Kushari, Swapan K Ghosh (Couple II; picture above) and Sanjoy Rakshit defines their attempts to derive a semblance of order and harmony by resigning oneself to the evil, corruption and decadence that have become synonymous with contemporary living. More than anything else, their art is an expression of their own state of mind, which is confused, tormented but ultimately gives in to the discord and disorder that forms the crux of modern existence. Unhappiness at the loss of values, ideologies and human relationships pervades their paintings, yet there is an urge to break free from social shackles and move towards an unfettered life.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings

 When: July 11 - 17, 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central Gallery

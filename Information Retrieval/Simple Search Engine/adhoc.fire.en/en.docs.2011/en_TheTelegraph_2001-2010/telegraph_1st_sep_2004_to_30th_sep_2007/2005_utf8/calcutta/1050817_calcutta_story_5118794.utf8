 Flower power

 The art of Ikebana, a special type of flower decoration and arrangement of the Japanese, has its origin in Ikenobo, whose history encompasses the traditional and the modern. The Japanese believe that flowers can reflect their own feelings and also the passage of time. The arrangement of flowers, leaves and branches in a wholly new appearance in Ikebana, is an expression of the unspoken words of plants and their hidden vigour and power. Ikebana also suggests the forces of nature with which plants live in harmony; branches bent by winter winds or flowers in radiant bloom after the rains. Hosted by Ikenobo Calcutta Chapter and consulate general of Japan, Calcutta, in association with Indo-Japan Welfare and Cultural Centre, this evening?s Japanese-style flower arrangement demonstration by Prof. Takashi Moribe, a renowned Ikebana exponent of the Ikenobo Institute of Floral Arts, Kyoto, Japan, is an event not to be missed by those with an eye for the aesthetic, specially in nature.

 Backache? Blame office

 - Tendency to shirk linked to stress and poor conditions at workplace

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The tendency to skip work may not, after all, be related to any culpable offence among office-goers, but to extreme stress and poor conditions at the workplace.

 So says a series of studies, which also traced a plethora of ailments, ranging from chronic back pain to high blood pressure and frequent headaches, to the same cause.

 ?Stress at workplace can greatly hamper the quality of work. And if working conditions are bad, they tell on an employee?s health as well,? says cardiologist Abhijit Banerjee.

 In fact, the Grant Thronton International Business Owners? Survey confirms that India is one of the 28 countries where business growth is being affected by stress at the workplace. The survey has also found that the stress level in business houses in India has increased by almost 15 per cent in the past year. The rise has been 12 per cent in Australia, 10 per cent in USA and just six per cent in Japan. 

 According to medical experts, people engaged in sedentary work and striving to meet targets within a specified time-frame are most vulnerable to stress-related disorders. The surveys have revealed that 40 per cent of Calcuttans skipping work lead a sedentary lifestyle.

 Spine surgeon L.N. Tripathi (Apollo Gleneagles Hospital) says: ?Cramped rooms, bad working conditions and acute stress are definitely taking a toll on the body, causing back and spine disorders and other health problems.?

 The latest Surgeon-General of India report draws an alarming scenario: ?One-third of adults in the country are not physically active.? 

 To better the situation, some offices in Calcutta, including those of Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and Central Bank of India, are now turning to ergonomically-designed offices (ergon in Greek stands for work and nomoi for natural laws). Dull colours are being replaced with motivating interiors. New layout plans have been introduced to give the offices a more comfortable look.

 ?Business houses are realising that simple makeovers in office can increase productivity a lot,? observes Anil Mathur, vice-president, Godrej Interiors and Furniture Group.

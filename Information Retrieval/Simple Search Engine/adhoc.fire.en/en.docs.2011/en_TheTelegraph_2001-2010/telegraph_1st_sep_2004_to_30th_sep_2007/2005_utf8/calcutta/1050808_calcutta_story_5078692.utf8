 Trend talk for tiny tots

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Theres no underestimating the little ones when it comes to style talk. Todays kids like to choose their clothes, shoes and accessories with as much precision as their teenaged brother or sisters. And with stores around town pampering the tiny tots with rackfuls of attractive goodies, you cant blame them for wanting to keep up with fashion trends. 

 When parents are out shopping, children like to spend time in special corners offering stuff for them. Kids are particularly attracted to accessories. The kids section in Chemb has received an overwhelming response from the little ones, says Amita Bajoria of the lifestyle store at City Centre.

 Goodlife browses through kids corners at fashion and lifestyle stores to hunt out some of the popular accessory picks.

 Hair wear

 Most children like to match hair accessories with their outfits and thats not a difficult task at all considering the plethora of colours and shapes that these come in. 

 The most commonly used hair accessory is the hair band available in a host of varieties, from plastic ones to the more popular elastic bands of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai fame. Decorated with flowers, bows and teddies, they are effortless ways to make your little angel look tidy and cute. 

 For ponytails and plaits, black rubberbands are things of the past. Ponytail holders and tie-ups in vibrant splashes come combined with colourful beads, butterflies and floral motifs. Reputed brands ensure the hair does not break while pulling these off. 

 ip-ons come in interesting shapes and sizes with stones and cartoon characters attached to them. Clips with rounded edges prevent the scalp from being injured. Comb clips with wooden finish are apt for children with longish hair. Also on offer are ruffled scrunchies and clutches.

 Bejewelled

 Costume jewellery is no longer a domain restricted to college-goers and teenyboppers. Children like to flaunt their share of earrings, chains and anklets, too. 

 From studs and hoops to danglers in floral and abstract designs, the collection is vast. Those not too keen on getting their ears pierced can opt for the clip-ons. Chains with Mickey Mouse pendants and cute little motifs of the moon, butterflies and smiling hearts are favourites for the neck. 

 Silver chains with rhodium polish are non-allergic. Reputed brands like FITSIN ensure that they are safe for childrens skin, explains Amita.

 Another A-team accessory for kids is the finger ring that sports the same motifs as the pendants and hair accessories. A line of rings in vibrant pink is a show-stealer at Chemb.

 Bag it

 They might dread those heavy school bags, but they will be only too eager to carry the assortment of smart and trendy party ones in interesting shapes and sizes. Strap-on waist bags, cross bags and purses, Beni Bear, Barbie and Spiderman prints adorn most of them. The tweenies can go for glamorous purses with heart and star motifs.

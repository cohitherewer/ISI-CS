The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City bags UN safe water project

 - April study tour for minister and mayor 

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta will be the first metro in the country to get specially-treated water from May, thanks to the UN Habitat, which has chosen Calcutta and Howrah to release funds (grant) and technology to provide safe drinking water.

 On an invitation from the UN Habitat, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra will lead a delegation on April 17 to Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, where similar schemes have been implemented, for an on-the-spot survey. 

 Mishra is expected to be accompanied by mayor Subrata Mukherjee and officials from the Union health ministry, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (AIIHPH).

 ?UN Habitat provides aid for poor and developing countries for safe drinking water. They have their own schemes for the project, including quality of water, process of filtration, treatment and also distribution,?? explained AIIHPH director Indira Chakraborty.

 ?The UN Habitat has accepted our concept paper. We will visit three countries to see how the project has been implemented there and how they are running. We expect to implement one pilot project in the city and another in Howrah within a month of our return,?? she added.

 Mayor Mukherjee said the city is lucky to bag the project. ?Since the UN Habitat will fund the project and also provide technical assistance, there will be no problem in implementing it. We will select the sites for setting up the filtration units after discussions with the departments concerned,?? the mayor said.

 Under the UN Habitat scheme, micro filtration units will be connected with the outlets of the water reservoirs to get the water specially filtered, before supplying it to different areas.

 Officials said the UN Habitat will invest around Rs 500 crore for the project. 

 The cost of one unit (with a capacity of filtering 200,000 litres of water a day) will be nearly Rs 5 crore. Though the target is one such unit for each Calcutta Municipal Corporation ward, officials said preference will be given to the poverty-stricken areas. 

 The first plant will come up at Garden Reach, in Calcutta, and Shibpur, in Howrah.

 The water will be supplied free to schools and health institutions.

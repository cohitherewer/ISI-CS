 Village vignettes

 Images of rural Bengal have seldom been so true to life and yet have the power to captivate the imagination as the paintings of Pintu Paul. Rural Feelings, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings, witnesses the artist portraying not so much the habits and activities of rustic folk, as trying to gain an insight into their private, inner lives. Done in oil on canvas, his works concentrate on uncovering the energies and emotions that kindle and illuminate the rural spirit with an almost ethereal radiance. Mainly depicting female figures in varying moods and dispositions, Paul uses rich, earthy overtones in thick, solid and powerful strokes to achieve a degree of realism where human passion and desire become all but palpable. Characterised as mother, wife, lover or courtesan, Paul?s figures underscore the enigmatic, charming and alluring qualities of women. Yet, for all their sensuousness, they retain an aura of simplicity and innocence which accentuates their unpretentious, raw beauty.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Pintu Paul

 When: Till June 16 (except Sunday), 2 pm - 7 pm; today (10 am - 3 pm)

 Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 12E Park Street

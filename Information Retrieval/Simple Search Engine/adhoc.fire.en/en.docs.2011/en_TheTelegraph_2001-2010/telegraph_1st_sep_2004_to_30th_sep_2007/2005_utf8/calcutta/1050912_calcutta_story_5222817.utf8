To cash in on the festive mood, You Ensembles, a designer 

boutique on Lake Road, is hosting an exhibition-cum-sale till September 13.

 The store is home to in-house as well as other designer collections. On display is a medley of ethnic wear, Indo-western apparels and accessories. Salwar suits and kurtis come in a vast array of fabrics like raw silk, georgettes, cotton, khadi and chanderi. Theres a lot of innovation on the necklines, which are either heavily worked upon or simple and elegant. Also on the racks are interesting wrap-arounds.

 The saris include organzas and cottons. Very soon we will keep georgettes and crepes as these do well during Diwali and the wedding season, says Priti Nathany, proprietor of the store.

 Pretty bags and batuas in jute, raw silk and leather come in all shapes and sizes. While those with trimmings, brocade and kasab work go well with party ensembles, simple jute ones with leather finish are suitable for college-goers. Colourful earrings that include studs and danglers complete the picture.

 Apart from the ready-to-wear stuff, You Ensembles also offers customised garments. A lot of people have their own design specifications. For them we have unstitched materials that we tailor according to their tastes, adds Priti.

 Glamour drapes

 The festive frenzy continues at yet another fashion address as Rozelle, a sari store at 1, Rawdon Street, launched its new range of drapes for the season.

 The highlight of the line is the sequin katori work that adorns almost all the saris in the collection. The inverted sequins are combined with threadwork in floral motifs. Another new offering is the sari embellished with pitta and silver zari kasab work.

 The fabrics are georgette, crepe, silk, jacquard and brocade and the palette is vibrant, in keeping with the mood of the moment. With the festival and marriage season around the corner, our colour story focuses on pink and magenta, says the proprietor of Rozelle, Aditya Diwan.

 Theres a touch of innovation in the blouses and each sari comes with a set of two differently-styled blouses. Prices of the sets range from Rs 3,000 to Rs 7,000, while those opting for designer blouses only can get them between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000.

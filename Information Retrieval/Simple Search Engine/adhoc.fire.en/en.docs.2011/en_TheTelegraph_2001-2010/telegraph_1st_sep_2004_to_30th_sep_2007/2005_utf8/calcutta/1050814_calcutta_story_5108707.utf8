 Music masti, beer bash

 Amit Sana, the Indian Idol runners-up, dropped into Virgose, the resto bar at HHI late on Saturday to get a first-hand feel of the party scene in Calcutta.

 Back home in Bhilai, there are really very few options as far as partying is concerned. Calcutta seems to have a throbbing nightlife, said Amit. 

 Accompanied by the 107.8 Power FM team, the boy from Bhilai hit the dance floor with Kajarare and Dus bahane before breaking into Chal diye from his debut album. 

 After his share of fun at Virgose, Amit hopped over to Shisha where he partied into the morning.

In tune

 Fosters, the Australian beer company, uncorked a lavish beer-and-barbecue bash in honour of percussionist Tanmoy Bose at The Taj on August 10. The occasion: the launch of Tanmoys new album Navras ? The Natyashastra Revisited. 

 The star guest list led by director Goutam Ghose, who has lent his voice to the narration in the album, ranged from Harsh Neotia, Sanjay Budhia and Rita Bhimani to June, Arjun and Nilanjana Chakraborty, Locket and Sharbari Dutta.

 The evening began with a rendition by Tanmoy to introduce the CD and it was formally unveiled by Goutam Ghose and June. The CD captures the nine human emotions in musical notes. The royalties from the album will be donated to the Institute of Child Health.

Do the dirty

 Bars, entertainment and dining, better known as B.E.D., was the destination for some dirty dancing on Friday night. Rajeev from Mumbai and Rosa from Spain were supposed to set the party at Ballygunge Circular on fire, but that was not to be.

 The first sequence was on the bar top, with the two dressed in their skimpiest best. The second came after a break of 20 minutes and the dance floor was cleared for the grand performance.

 But that drew more jeers than cheers. The woman is well past her prime and the guy is so un-cool? Its better to watch a Mallika Sherawat flick (or MMS), said a regular reveller. No one, one presumes, can do the dirty quite like Bollywood.

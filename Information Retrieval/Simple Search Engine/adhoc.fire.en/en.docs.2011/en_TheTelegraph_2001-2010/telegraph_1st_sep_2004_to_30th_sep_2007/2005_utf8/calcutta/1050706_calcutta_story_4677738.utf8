The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Plant puts sweets on a hygiene high

 - Leading Names agree to adopt new technology

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Bitter protest was not the only activity at Jadavpur University over the past month. The food technology and biochemistry department in the meantime provided finishing touches to a miniature plant that can manufacture germ-free and bacteria-free rasogollas and sandesh.

 Not only that, the facility, equipped with state-of-the-art gadgets, can make sweets of uniform sizes. The recipes can also be standardised using the new technology.

 The texture of the sweets manufactured in the plant is better than those made by hand, claimed the researchers who developed the plant.

 ?In Calcutta, sweets are manufactured almost entirely by hand. Consumers often complain of the poor hygiene standards in sweet-manufacturing units,? said Utpal Raychoudhuri, a senior teacher of the department and leader of the research team.

 ?Sweets are an indispensable part of the daily diet of most Calcuttans, but so far, almost nothing has been done to make their manufacturing process healthier,? he added. ?There will be no scope for consumers to question the hygiene aspect of the sweets manufactured using our technology.?

 According to officials, the university decided to carry out the research at the insistence of the food processing department of the state government.

 A survey of the sweet industry by the government had revealed that the combined capital of the manufacturing units was Rs 10 crore-odd.

 ?It is surprising that despite the resources, science and technology have in no way influenced the conduct of this business. The entire industry depends on simple, traditional manual methods,? stated the survey report.

 ?Even though almost no money is spent for advertisement, the volume of sweet sales is increasing every year without any challenge,? officials of the department quoted the report as saying. 

 The plant, developed on the university campus, has been shown to leading sweet manufacturers. Some of them, including Dwarik?s and Bhim Nag, have reportedly agreed to adopt the technology.

 ?Sweet-making is one of the oldest businesses in Calcutta, and also in West Bengal. Unfortunately, we are still entirely dependent on the age-old system of using manual labour. There are many deficiencies in the process and it is high time we introduce modern technology to the trade,? Partha Ghosh, who works for Dwarik, said. 

 Total absence of bacteria and germs is not the only USP of the semi-automatic plant.

 ?The plant is computerised and consists of smaller units. It can handle the entire process of manufacture of various types of sweets,? Raychoudhuri stated. 

 The operations of the plant will start from the manufacture of the chhana (cottage cheese), a common ingredient in sweets. It will be prepared by mixing milk and acid in a chamber.

 Once the process is completed, the chhana will be transferred to another chamber. There, whey will be drained from it by applying pressure.

 Preparation of the dough will constitute the next stage, followed by its division into small pieces. The pieces will then be rolled into balls.

 Finally, the balls will be boiled in sugar syrup to turn them into rasogollas.

 Similar processes will be followed at the plant to prepare various types of sandesh. 

 Consumers and sweet manufacturers would benefit in several ways by taking advantage of the new technology, asserted those connected with the research.

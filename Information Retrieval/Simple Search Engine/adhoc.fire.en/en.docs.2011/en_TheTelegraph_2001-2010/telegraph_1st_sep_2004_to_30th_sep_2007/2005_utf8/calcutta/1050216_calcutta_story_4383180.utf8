 Home truths shock rights panel chief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The inmates of this home have never been hardcore criminals. Yet, their appointed guardians don?t care that they haven?t bathed in ages, that they skip the unpalatable meals, or that their toilets haven?t been cleaned for a long time.

 All this and more stories of neglect is what state human rights commission chairman Shyamal Sen heard on Tuesday when he visited Kishalay, a government-run home for destitute male children in Barasat. 

 Such was the stink that Sen had to tour the premises holding a kerchief to his nose.

 The rights panel chairman took exception to the appalling conditions in which the children, rescued from various parts of the state, were lodged.

 Over the years, there have been frequent incidents of inmates escaping from Kishalay. Only last Thursday, 18 boys escaped, 10 of whom remain untraced. 

 On Tuesday afternoon, some of the 172 inmates, aged between five and 14 years, who had been locked away in a three-storeyed building to be kept out of sight, managed to draw Sen?s attention by banging on utensils and making a lot of noise. 

 When Sen walked up and spoke to the children through the ground-floor window, a barrage of grievances poured out. ?We are not allowed to play within the campus. Mihir uncle and Ananda uncle beat us on the slightest pretext. Even animals cannot use the filthy dining room and bathrooms,? complained one of the boys. 

 Apprehending a thrashing if his ?uncles? saw him, he quickly turned away from the window.

 ?This is absolutely unacceptable!? Sen told home officials. ?The government is giving grants to this institution. Where is all the money going?? Sen rebuked the home authorities, including additional district magistrate (transport) Shankar Mondal.

 ?The bathrooms are choked, the food is below standard and the children don?t get enough facilities for development. There are also complaints that they are tortured. No wonder these boys try to escape so often,? Sen later said.

 Power utility to take on pilferers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 With the festive season round the corner, the CESC authorities on Tuesday appealed to customers to identify and report cases of power pilferage.

 The utility has also decided to step up its drive against pilferers and educate its two million customers about the impact of power theft.

 ?Last year, we had lodged complaints against 478 Puja organisers. On an average, we incur losses of around Rs 15-20 crore during the Pujas due to power theft,? said Santanu Chatterjee, executive director (corporate development) and the in-charge of CESC?s loss-control cell.

 Chatterjee, however, felt that the situation had improved lately. ?There are 4,500 cases of power pilferage pending in courts. The suits will be transferred to five special courts that have been set up to deal with power theft.?

 Last month, a man named Debabrata Naskar was fined Rs 5,000 and sentenced to three years? rigorous imprisonment for stealing power.

 The power utility, with police assistance, is presently engaged in building a database of people with a history of power pilferage.

 ?We have already printed a leaflet with the picture of a power thief in Serampore. We are collecting data on more such power thieves and will mail the information to our customers,? an official said. 

 The CESC will also let its customers know about the consequences of power theft.

 ?Some Puja organisers have a tendency to steal power from supply lines, claiming they have installed a temporary meter of 10 KW,? said the executive-director. 

 ?In effect, they consume at least double the capacity for various kinds of illumination.We request consumers to immediately inform us about such activities,? he added.

 As part of its awareness campaign, the CESC wants to inform customers that pilferage results in overloading, which ultimately damages costly equipment. 

 Pilferage also affects supply, causing fluctuation and a sharp drop in voltage, Chatterjee warned.

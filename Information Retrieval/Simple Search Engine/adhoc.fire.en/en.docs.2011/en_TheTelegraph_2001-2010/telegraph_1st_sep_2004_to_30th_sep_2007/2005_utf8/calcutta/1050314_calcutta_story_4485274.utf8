 Feminism in modern art

 Specialising in abstract, expressionist art, Eleena Banik comes across as a modernist painter committed to spreading the message of world peace and harmony. Richly-coloured washes with a strange combination of shadows and highlights impart to her large, expansive canvases a strong, looming presence, at the same time evoking the feeling of an overall pleasing unity. Interpreted from a feminist viewpoint, her works articulate a concern for the security of women and a need to establish their identity on an equal footing with men. Loaded with psychological overtones, Banik?s art uses religious and contemporary iconography to invoke the notion of a woman?s angst both as a blessing (of escape into fantasy) and a curse (endless mental torment), poignantly exposing the suppression of women?s experiences down the ages.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In search of India?s answer to Mickey Mouse

 Chhota Birbal: Local hero

 It takes 16 years to become a good animator, said Walt Disney. The master had his reasons. ?If you are directing a live action film, you have an art director, cameraman, costume designer and location hunter. But an animator has to find his location, get his look right as well as tell his story. The gamut of faculties that he needs to have is daunting,? explains Kireet Khurana, creative director of 2nz, a Mumbai-based animation studio.

 The man, who created Chhota Birbal, ?the first Indian animated character to be licensed?, is in town to formalise a tie-up with The Academy of Animation Arts amp; Technology (AAAT), a Hazra Road institute that started in 2003 with a promise to train students in classical animation. ?There are 5,000 to 6,000 good animators in the country. We need about 30,000 hands.?

 If quantity is lacking, quality will take some time as well. ?It is not fair to compare us immediately to the West. Disney made Snow White and Seven Dwarfs (the first full-length animated feature in colour with sound) in 1937. In comparison, animation in India made a real beginning around 1998. It will take us another five-six years to reach even that level,? feels the graduate from Sheridan College, Canada.

 According to the secretary of The Animation Society of India, the industry in India is doing business of about $ 300 million. Of this, about $90 million is coming from servicing contracts outsourced by major studios in the West. 

 Original content is still hard to come by. Ramayana was the first Indian story beamed on Cartoon Network, but it was made in Japan. Pandavas and Sinbad from Pentamedia Graphics followed. Tenali Raman, produced by Toonz Animation, Alibaba and Forty Thieves, Hanuman and Khurana?s Adventures of Chhota Birbal came next. ?The concept took six-seven months to take shape while four months went in production.?

 There are about 200-250 studios in India now, centred in Mumbai and the south. ?Once full-fledged studios come up in Calcutta, more work will surely be generated here.? He will conduct a day-long workshop for AAAT students on Sunday, filling them in on the basics of cell animation and the progress around the world. 

 Khurana?s one regret: ?There is no Indian character even half as popular as Mickey Mouse among today?s children.? His Calcutta effort might be a step towards a remedy.

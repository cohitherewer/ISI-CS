 Western wows from design duo

Design collaborators with roots in two continents have been turning heads across the country.

 Nil or Navonil Das, a Bengali from Australia, and Dev or Debarghya Bairagi, based in Calcutta, have combined their creative sensibilities to come up with a line of western outfits for what they call the non-typical woman.

 Our clothes are for the mature dresser who can carry off her outfit in style, says Nil, who conceived the label known simply as d while in Australia.

 He teamed up with NiFD student Dev a few months ago to start operations in a swank workshop in Howrah. 

 Dev had made his own mark as a finalist in the Style File Young Masters Talent Hunt in 2004.

 The duos collection includes skirts, dresses, eveningwear and tops. The clothes are tailored primarily in silk-satin, georgette, organza and crepe.

 The range will soon be found on the racks of Little India on Elgin Road, Cinnamon in Bangalore, Amethyst in Chennai and Ffolio. They also have an international ticket to ride, with a corner in Jean Townsend, a designer outlet in Canberra, Australia.

 Model Priyanka Pal sports an ensemble from designer Preeti Jhawar rsquo;s summer 2005 line. The collection is inspired by the punk culture of the late 70s and early 80s. ldquo;I have tried to redefine a Bohemian rock-punk look. Key elements include stovepipe skirts, digitally-printed sequinned tops and beaded tie-ups. It has been accessorised with studs, coloured chains worn as bangles and safety pins, rdquo; says the designer. Picture by Rashbehari Das

Gujarati garb

 I am a pure Gujju and I want to promote the handicrafts that are inherent to Ahmedabad, says NIFT graduate Shradha Manaktala.

 The young designer, who completed her formal training in 2004, has just launched her summer collection under her label Seven.

 My label caters to the urban woman for whom fashion is not just about looking good, but also feeling comfortable, explains Shradha, whose collection is presently being retailed at Ogaan.

 Her range this time is essentially for the cool Calcuttan who prefers cotton outfits in a range of soft colours.

 I have primarily used cotton with some georgette as relief, to give a transparent, feminine look, she explains.

 The range of long kurtas can be teamed with churidars, trousers or jeans. Patchwork and applique (both used widely in Gujarat), with subtle use of sequins and some embroidery are the favoured embellishments.

 Ladies nite

 Wednesdays are fast gaining ground as the preferred girls night out in town. First, Big Ben at The Kenilworth started a midweek womens night. Now, its Tantras turn.

 Called X Chromosome, starting this week the night-club at The Park has special offers for its female following, in the form of free entry and 50 per cent off on all alcoholic beverages. 

 Pretty in Pink is the inaugural theme. Women in their favourite pink outfits are invited to dance the night away. Next week, the party goes retro.

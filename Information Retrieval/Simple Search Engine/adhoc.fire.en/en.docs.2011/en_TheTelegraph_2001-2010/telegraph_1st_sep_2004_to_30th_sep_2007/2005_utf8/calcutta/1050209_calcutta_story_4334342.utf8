The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Food amp; mood mantra at lounge launch

Virgose 

at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) will complete a hat-trick of sorts on 

January 14 when it opens its doors to the night raiders of Calcutta. It will be 

the third nightspot after BED and Starstruck Retro Lounge in less than two weeks.

 HHI unveiled its dining and lounge bar on Monday evening. With the star hotel as its backdrop, the new lounge is supposed to usher in a new concept of unwinding.

 ?The place is primarily about food and mood. Music comes much later,? says D.K. Jaiswal, chairman and managing director, HHI. ?With changing trends, people seem to be shunning crowded discos. Virgose will provide a complete and sophisticated alternative.?

 The international cuisine spread will consist of Mexican, Italian, Lebanese and Japanese dishes, to name a few.

What?s different about Virgose? There?s no dancing, 

for one. ?There are strict instructions to play only lounge music and some commercial 

English tracks. No Hindi music as of now,? says DJ Vikrant, down from Delhi to 

rock Virgose.

 The DJ box boasts a Pioneer console and Bose solution systems. The Fibre-LED lights are meant to set the mood. And there are the five cosy lounge spaces? 

Flower power

They work for the cause of the downtrodden and delight 

in using household products for home d?cor. Members of the National Indian Association 

for Women got together last week to bond over a flower arrangement demonstration 

with Parul Swarup.

 The organisation, started in 1907, is two years from celebrating its centenary and is still going strong, organising charity events to fund projects for the underprivileged.

 Last week?s event, however, was all about putting together a flawless flower arrangement. The brief demonstration by Parul Swarup that showed how to use pulses from the kitchen in a glass container to best effect had the members mesmerised.

 ?The idea is to encourage latent talent and we keep organising competitions in the field of art and music for our members,? says Arunlekha Gupta, president of the organisation. 

 Haute hair

 Cate Blanchett, Jodie Kidd ? and now the Calcutta girl! Australian hair stylist Millicent Howe, who?s styled the locks of many a Hollywood celebrity, was in town to share hair colouring techniques with salons here.

 Basically promoting Schwarzkopf hair products in India, the Europe-based stylist was armed with handy tips on colours to match Indian skin tones. 

 ?Golden brown, honey, caramel, gold, red and violet are the colours I recommend for Indian women, but of course the personal style of the client reigns supreme,? suggests Howe.

 She is all for personal consultation with the client before any session. ?The most important thing for a stylist is to understand client preferences and offer solutions accordingly.?

 Howe goes on to make the Calcutta colour chart even more colourful by suggesting a combination of two shades, especially red and gold. 

 ?Experimenting with styles works better on a younger clientele. The use of two colours also gives the hair more style and volume,? she explains.

 Also, layering of the hair for a stylised look suits the profile of the Indian woman. ?Most Indian women part the hair in the middle. They should go in for a side-parting instead, since it opens up the face and makes the facial features more prominent,? suggests Howe.

 Love gems

 With jewellery stores all over the city gearing up to ride the Valentine rush, Anjali Jewellers at Gol Park has launched its Hum Tum collection. 

 Comprising intricately carved gold pieces with a youthful and trendy feel, they are affordably priced to appeal to the youthful market.

 The promotional campaign for the Hum Tum collection contained the USP of reaching out to all kinds of people and instead of having a model or actress showcase the jewels, a loyal patron of the store did the honours. 

 The Hum Tum collection is unique and personal. It showcases a wide range of jewellery to suit diverse budgets and tastes. 

 The Lover?s 22-carat gold chain and pendant comes packaged at Rs 1,250-plus, while the Hum Tum pendants are priced starting from Rs 1,650.

 An interesting Hum Tum ring and Hum Tum chain and locket sets can also be found here. While the ring starts at Rs 2,850, the chain comes for Rs 4,500 and more. 

 A Forget-me-Not ring is priced above Rs 3,000, while the Lover?s diamond ring and Lover?s gold amp; pearl leaf set starts at Rs 2,400. 

 The collection will be available in all four showrooms from February 11 to 14.

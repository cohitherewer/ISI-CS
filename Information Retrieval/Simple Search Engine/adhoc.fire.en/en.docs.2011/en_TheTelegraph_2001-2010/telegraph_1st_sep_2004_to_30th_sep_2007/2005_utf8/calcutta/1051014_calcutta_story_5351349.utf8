 Molest tag on 4

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four youths allegedly molested a 40-year-old housewife in her house in Gaighata, North 24-Parganas, on Wednesday evening. They entered the house on the pretext of exchanging Bijoya Dashami greetings with the woman?s husband.

 Police said the woman was molested in front of her 15-year-old niece. Her husband, headmaster of a primary school, was watching an immersion at a pond nearby.

 ?According to the complaint lodged by the husband, local tough Shakti Biswas and three others came into the house and said they wanted to exchange greetings with him,? said a police officer. 

 ?On being told that the teacher was away, Shakti pounced on the woman.?

 As the niece raised an alarm, the youths gagged her. 

 Her cries, however, were heard by those who had gathered at the pond. A group of people, including the woman?s husband, rushed to the house. 

 ?Seeing them, the molesters fled after scaling the wall of the house. We?re looking for them,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police.

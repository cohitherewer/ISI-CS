 The Kellys amp; the couple: Caught in the 

web

Marred by marriage

It?s not your average marriage or love story. The 

tagline for the new show on STAR World, Married To The Kellys, reads: ?An 

uptown boy weds a rustic family?. 

 Manhattan-ite Tom Wagner (Breckin Meyer) is swept off his feet by Susan Kelly (Kiele Sanchez), a Midwesterner. They get married and move to Susan?s Kansas hometown. But it?s not quite the way Tom envisaged being happily married. 

 Tom tries to befriend his wife?s control-freak mother Sandy, her highly competitive sister Mary, the nerdish, bug-collecting kid brother Lewis and smug, condescending Uncle Dave. In return, the Kellys welcome Tom with open arms. Except, Tom doesn?t quite fit in with his big-city attitudes and his reluctance to chow down on Midwestern manners and corn-fed culture. 

 But Tom?s panic-stricken life is relieved by the growing camaraderie with his father-in-law Bill, who says, ?Family is like quicksand. The more you struggle, the deeper you sink.? 

 Married To The Kellys premiered on August 22. Tune in on Mondays at 8 pm.

 Sonali Kulkarni and Kay Kay in Dansh: 

Think time

 It?s a small film with a whole lot of potential. Kanika Verma?s directorial debut Dansh, which was screened at the Osian?s Cinefan festival, explores the human mind through three 

 characters caught in a precarious situation. 

 Set against the backdrop of Mizoram, the film revolves around Maria (Sonali Kulkarni) who suspects guest Dr John Sanga (Aditya Srivastava) of being her former rapist. Maria?s husband Mathew (Kay Kay Menon) is in two minds, whether to believe her or not. 

 Before the film releases at the theatres, you can check out a paid preview of Dansh with some of the cast and crew members at INOX (City Centre) on Wednesday at 6.25 pm.

 The team will also be visiting the Crossword bookstore to discuss the film and its theme.

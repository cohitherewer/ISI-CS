 Brows raised over police role in probe

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Officers of Tangra police station have come in for criticism for the way they conducted the investigation following the abduction of the boy whose body was found in a septic tank on Wednesday morning.

 It is felt that Tangra police should have kept their investigation confined to the area under their jurisdiction, covering a radius of two km, instead of fanning out into adjoining districts and states.

 A day after taking charge of the probe into the murder of 13-year-old Hasan Iqbal, the detective department stressed that this was the lacuna in the investigation carried out by local police. ?The investigation was not driven in the right direction. Officers of Tangra police station did not react properly immediately after receiving the complaint,? said a detective department officer.

 Hasan was abducted on November 11 evening and his family received a ransom call for Rs 5 lakh. His father lodged a complaint with Tangra police station. After five days, Hasan?s decomposed body was found in a septic tank only 50 yards from his residence. 

 The post-mortem report confirmed that he was gagged to death either on November 11 night or early the next day.

 Police detained nine persons, including the owner of the house adjacent to the septic tank. ?We are interrogating them. We are delving into the past of Sheikh Harun, the landlord, who was released from jail a few months ago,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police (detective department).

 Police feel it was not possible for Harun to have committed the crime alone, because both his hands are chopped off.

 Elaborating on some vital points local police overlooked, an officer of the detective department said the thana officers should have known that picking up a 13-year-old boy forcibly from a congested lane in the Tangra area is next to impossible. Had the police combed the neighbourhood immediately after the incident, they could have found the boy alive.

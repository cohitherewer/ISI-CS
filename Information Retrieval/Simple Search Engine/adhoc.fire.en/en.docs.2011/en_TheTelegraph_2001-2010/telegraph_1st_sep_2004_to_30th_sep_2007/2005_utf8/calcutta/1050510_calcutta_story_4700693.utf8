 Looks like Souravs: The Food Pavilion has spawned a trend in blending fashion with food. The concept of weekly fashion shows at unlikely venues seems to have appealed to others in the hospitality industry as well. The latest to bite the bait is Caffeine.

 The coffee shop chain is set to position itself as a fashion bistro, with round-the-clock fashion extravaganza.

 The one-and-a-half floor Elgin Road outlet hosted the first style show of the series on Saturday night as designer Pritam Panda showcased his latest collection. Subsequent shows may include fashion photography exhibitions, photo shoots and a host of related activities. 

 ?Fashion cafes are a rage across the world and I think it wont be long before cafes in Calcutta will also be specialised in either art, literature, music or fashion,? said Rajdeep Ghosal, owner of Caffeine.

 The cafe turned out to be a cosy place indeed for a line launch, with Calcuttas hip brigade agreeing to hang around post the 10 pm gong to witness a fashion fiesta.

 ?Since fashion shows are usually held at five-star venues they have been restricted to a select audience. Many people in the city havent witnessed a live fashion show. I think these events would help bring an elitist concept closer to the masses,? added Rajdeep. 

 The line on display on Saturday showcased the transformation of Maya, the protagonist of Vatsayanas Kamasutra from the Medieval ages to the 21st century. ?The collection was meant to show how Maya still holds her relevance and sensuality in the present context,? explained designer Pritam.

 Meant for the transit season, between spring and summer and autumn and winter, the palette packed everything from bright hues to subtle shades. Pritam concentrated both on texturing the garments as well as embellishments, among which real gold zari work also featured.

 ?The response of the first event is encouraging and we intend to have a monsoon accessories show at the caf? soon,? signed off Rajdeep.

 Italian ice

 With the skies opening up like never before, its not enough to burrow into the sinful pleasures of a Kwality ice cream or even Baskin Robbins. The flavour is Italian this summer. 

 Mama Mia! gelato, at 19/S Block A, New Alipore, is offering cool desserts straight from Italy, the land where ice-cream originated (according to one school of thought for food, at least). ?Calcutta has a lot of local and national brands. But we felt there was nobody catering to the premium segment. So we thought of setting up this Italian import,? said proprietor Natasha Aggarwal.

 Gelato is Italian for ice cream. The production of gelato, which is an integral part of Italian culture and cuisine, is an ancient art. The cool delicacies at Mama Mia! gelato are based on original recipes from chef Danielle Ghisalberti of Bergamo, Italy. The ice cream here is made in small batches in a workshop attached to the parlour, involving a greater level of craftsmanship and creativity compared to regular industrial ice creams.

 The flavours are claimed to be natural, be it strawberries, honeydew melon, cocoa, pistachio or vanilla and the cream 96 per cent fat free!

 Ice cream can be roughly divided into fruit and cream gelato at Mama Mia... Favourite fruity flavours include Red Orange, Honeydew Melon, Watermelon, Green Apple and Wine Grape. And some of the preferred cream gelatos are Forest Berries and Cream, Pina Colada, Nutella and Figs and Cream.

 Hot n cold

 If you thought only brownies and pastries went down well with a steaming cuppa, try the kebabs and cappuccino combo at Adda, the coffee bar at Tandoori Nights, 54/1/2A Hazra Road. 

 The North-West Frontier cuisine restaurant has converted a portion of the space into a coffee shop. ?We want to capture the flying customer segment. There are many people who come here for a quick bite and not an elaborate meal,? said Indranil Dasgupta, owner of the restaurant.

 Tandoor Nights has come up with a unique concept of pairing various flavours of coffee with different types of kebabs. ?It would make for a semi-meal without taking away the flavour of a coffee adda,? claimed Dasgupta. 

 For a choice of cold coffee and kebabs from the regular menu, the pocket pinch is Rs 40, while hot coffee with the same fare comes a little cheaper at Rs 35. Sans eats, cold and hot sips cost Rs 25 and Rs 15 respectively.

 Hot faves at the outlet include Chocochino, Irish Coffee and Caf? Mocha. Iced Caramel Latte and Iced Mocha are among the cool picks.

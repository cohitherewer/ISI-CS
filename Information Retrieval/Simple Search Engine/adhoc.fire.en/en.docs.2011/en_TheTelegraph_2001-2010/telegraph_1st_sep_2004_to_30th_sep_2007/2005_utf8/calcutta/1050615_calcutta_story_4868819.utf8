The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Helping hands or headache

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses are published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should the mayor?s council in the Corporation be done away with, leaving only the mayor and the civic officials?

 Samyak nandy,

 Bangur Avenue

 I feel the mayoral council should not be done away with. Instead its strength should be increased, primarily because it is impossible for the mayor and his officials to look after the civic body on their own. Many hands make a work light and the mayor can certainly do with help. With more mayoral council members, the development of the city would take place more rapidly and in a systematic way.

 Hemanta Kumar Datta, 

 Shibpur

 The idea of abolishing the mayoral council is not a bright one. The council is supposed to help the mayor in solving various problems that crop up during the day-to-day functioning of the corporation. It would hardly be possible for the mayor to effectively supervise the work of different departments on his own. Problems among mayoral council members are bound to crop up. The mayor needs to handle such situations with tact.

 Arjun Chaudhuri, 

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane

 The mayoral council is vital for the efficient functioning of the corporation. There is no reason to do away with it. However, the civic authorities have to ensure that it is not reduced to an ornamental body that merely eats into civic funds.

 Indranil Sanyal, 

 Dhakuria

 The mayoral council members are not elected, but they are part and parcel of the corporation. It will not be possible for the mayor to look after the development of the 141 wards on his own. The mayoral council members directly interact with the people, hence their role is vital for development. Suggestions from the members are also important, considering the present political situation.

 A.K. Mitra, 

 Padda Pukur Road

 The party which wins the civic election selects the mayor and mayoral council members, and the system should continue. My suggestion is that in addition to the existing members, the sheriff, the ex-mayor and three eminent citizens should also be included in the council. That is the only way to ensure smooth functioning of Calcutta Municipal Corporation and that citizens get proper civic facilities.

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane 

 The mayoral council is essential for proper functioning of a civic body. Committees should also be constituted in every ward to help the councillors.

Debasish Chakraborty, 

 Nilmoni Mitra Row

 There is no need for the mayor?s council. The members of the council are in reality good for nothing. The body should immediately be dissolved to minimise expenditure. The mayor and civic officials are enough to run the corporation.

 Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 It is not a judicious suggestion. If the mayoral council is abolished, it will be difficult for the mayor alone to coordinate and oversee the different service and development projects in the municipal area. Nobody expects the chief minister to look after the various departments of the government alone, so why target the mayoral council? If the council is done away with, local needs may not be properly represented and acted upon. Civic officials are nothing but executives. They cannot replace mayoral council members in a democratic set-up.

 Naren Sen,

 B.N. Lahiri Lane

 Abolishing the mayoral council will not reap dividends in the long-run. Without the help of the council, the going will get too tough for the mayor.

 Ahasan Jahir Molla,

 Mahestala

 Too many cooks spoil the broth and too many heads in a civic body hamper developmental activities. I feel the mayoral council should definitely be trimmed if not abolished altogether. 

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue 

 The sooner the mayoral council of the corporation is made defunct, the better. It is superfluous, and makes a mess of everything instead of rendering constructive and beneficial services to tax payers. The corporation will discharge its duties more efficiently provided civic officials are pressured to be sincere and vigilant about their work.

 Debashis Saha, 

 Anath Nath Deb Lane

 It will not be right to abolish the mayoral council. The council helps the mayor in arriving at the right decision. Without the council members, the mayor would be saddled with too many problems and responsibilities. I feel instead of abolishing the mayoral council, it should be entrusted with more responsibilities.

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Baguiati

 Doing away with the mayoral council would certainly depoliticise the civic body to a great extent. The move can be tried out, at least on an experimental basis. In case there are problems in the functioning of the corporation, then the council can be reinstated. 

 Ayon Hazra,

 College Street

 The mayoral council should certainly be pruned. Its responsibilities should also be defined better and the members made more accountable. But abolishing the council totally would be counterproductive. 

 Arnab Jyoti Pal,

 Lake Town

 The corporation should immediately dissolve the mayoral council. The body is nothing but a hotbed of corruption and hampers developmental work rather than aiding it. Options of increasing the efficiency of the council are not feasible due to its political nature.

Kaushik Ghosh,

 College Street

 The mayor-in-council should be abolished as it intensifies factional feud within the party/parties ruling the civic body, in turn destabilising the board. Besides, the system also delays execution of projects. In place of the council, the civic body should function only with the mayor as the political head and the municipal commissioner as the administrative head.

 Dilip Chakraborty,

 Thakurpukur

 Of what use is the council except to pamper the ego of some councillors? All they do is drain the exchequer and indulge in in-fighting. Why can?t the people?s representatives work without an extra tag to their name? They can always question the mayor if he is going off track.

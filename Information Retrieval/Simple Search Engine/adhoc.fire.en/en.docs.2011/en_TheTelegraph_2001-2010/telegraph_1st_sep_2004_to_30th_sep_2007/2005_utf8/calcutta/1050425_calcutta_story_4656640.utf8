The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 VAT-scar market still shut 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The situation at the VIP Market complex, in Metiabruz, was anything but normal on Sunday, a day after it was rocked by violence over the value-added tax (VAT) shutdown. 

 Most shops were closed as the traders were too scared to conduct business. They have decided to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Monday and demand that security at the market be stepped up further.

 A contingent of jawans of the Rapid Action Force, combat force and Eastern Frontier Rifles has been patrolling the area since Saturday.

 Babulal Laskar, owner of the market and a member of the Bangla Readymade Garments Chamber of Commerce, said the traders were suffering from a ?fear psychosis? and were not keen on reopening their shops.

 ?Wholesale markets in Metiabruz house around 15,000 shops, which remain open for only two days in a week. Because of the violence, we have incurred a loss of around Rs 10 crore,? a local trader said.

 Local CPM legislator Mursalin Mollah blamed the violence to the failure in generating awareness about VAT among traders.

 Additional superintendent of South 24-Parganas police (rural) C.K. Dutta said: ?We have deployed a large police contingent in the area to ensure that the situation remains peaceful.?

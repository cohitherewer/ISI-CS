Life

 Stylishly sporting, sunny side up

From the tennis court and joggers 

park to the dance floor and hookah bar, the outdoor look has travelled far and 

fast with a brand new glamorous twist. Shradha Agarwal tracks the trends 

 It all began with modest track pants teamed with a sweat tee, the Nike tick ordering you to do it now. Steadily and stylishly, it graduated to Swarovski-studded jersey tops teamed with equally embellished bottoms. And now, suddenly, the sporty look has acquired a whole new pretty, feminine and oh-so-glam avatar, thanks to a host of super-fashionable sports stars who endorse this look so naturally.

 l in all, sporty fashion has never had it so hot. Heres the GoodLife take on the sporty, hottie look this winter. 

 Icon watch

 Sania Mirza, Michael Schumacher, Maria Sharapova, David Beckham? When power at the game sets the pace, style statements just have to follow the same sporty route. So, girls sporting Sania glasses or nose-pins hardly comes as a surprise.

 But, wait a minute. This isnt a sudden shift of style icons because Bollywood still pretty much tops our list. The only difference being, this time, instead of setting a trend or two, Bollywood is also busy following the leaders on field or court.

 Proof of the cine style going sporty ? Preity Zinta in Salaam Namaste, Katrina Kaif in Sarkar, Tanishaa in Neal N Nikki or even Tanushree Duttas tennis babe look in Chocolate.

 According to designer Sejal Kanoi, the filmi angle to the sporty look has been slowly built by the Yash Raj heroines. Kajol in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Karisma Kapoor in Dil To Pagal Hai and Kareena Kapoor in Mujhse Dosti Karoge ? all of them introduced the sexy angle to the sporty look, says Sejal.

Glam turn

 Embellishments or fabrics ? all the outdoor elements have undergone a major makeover since the sporty look in general has gone from tomboyish to glamorous. The stitch detailings have acquired a hint of shimmer. Also, the blues and reds are now complemented by shiny silver or bronze.

 According to designer Gauri Bajoria, the little things that go to make an outfit sporty have been given a modern twist. The rubber piping has metamorphosed into satin, and the added play of zippers and buttons is not uncommon.

 Even the rubberised printing that was so sporty has gone from regular to textured. The white print now has a gold metallic foil for company, says Gauri. 

 The traditional sporty jacket can be given an interesting twist too. The plain jacket that is ribbed on the bottom and at the end of the sleeves, can be made contemporary with the use of a rich velvet fabric and some intricate embellishment, says designer Aparna Chandra. 

 So, from boring to beautiful, from plain to party ? sporty wear is all set to dazzle your evenings too. You can capture the sporty look in any garment with a dash of extra zippers, exaggerated pockets and nylon tapes in solid hues. The printed numbers too have gone glam with sequins and flirty frills, says Sejal. 

Super styling

 The acceptability of the sporty look is because of its high comfort quotient, feels Aparna. Easy to style and easy to carry is what works for this statement.

 You can style a sporty garment just about any way you like ? leave the house in a vest and jeans and as the day progresses into night, pile up the right add-ons to make it work. Choose from a pair of high heels, a jazzy belt and delicate jewellery, adds Aparna. 

 A host of sporty add-ons rounds off the right look. Be it caps, glares, closed shoes and chunky bags, shimmer and shine have caught up with em all. So, you can choose from adjustable sling bags, funky glasses, metallic belts and large hoops. 

 For the hair, neat is the way to go ? gelled back into a high ponytail, under a thick hair band or just a cool short cut. 

 Team talk

 The versatility of sporty garments is very high and thats another reason for them being a runaway hit. A jersey teamed with fitted pants looks just as striking when worn with a chiffon-layered skirt. A racer-back lycra top can complement a full-volume gypsy skirt on one hand, and look equally stunning with a well-fitted pair of denim roll-ups. 

 The sporty look retains the basic charm and silhouette, but whats new is the manner in which it is being worn. A short pleated skirt, very tennis-like, is worn with fitted churidars or with a silk crushed top, says Gauri.

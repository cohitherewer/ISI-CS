 Metro Railway security was beefed up further on Monday by shutting down nine entry and exit points at various stations. Sniffer dogs were also pressed into service at the stations and on the trains.

 The stations where entry and exit points have been shut are Shyambazar (near the five-point crossing), Chandni Chowk (on Ganesh Chandra Avenue), Esplanade (opposite Peerless Inn and near Grand Hotel), Park Street (Maidan entrance), Jatin Das Park (Basusree Cinema entrance), Kalighat (beside the park and on SP Mukherjee Road) and Rabindra Sarobar.

 A special team, comprising members of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Calcutta Police, on Monday conducted a survey of the stations and identified the entrances that could be shut down. 

 ?The number of security personnel has also been increased. The two terminal stations are now manned round-the-clock,? stated S.Z. Samuel, chief security commissioner, RPF (Eastern Railway with additional charge of Metro). Nine RPF personnel each have been deployed at Tollygunge and Dum Dum stations.

 ?Some entrances were unnecessarily eating up our manpower and causing problems in providing proper security,? Samuel added. 

 Six sniffer dogs from the RPF?s Howrah division and two from the city police?s dog squad will be used to bolster Metro security, an official said.

 On Monday, four of the dogs ? two each from RPF and the city force ? were taken to various stations and inside trains to conduct searches. While the pair from Lalbazar was used for platform checking, the RPF dogs sniffed the inside of the trains.

 In a meeting late last week, attended by senior officials of the Metro, RPF and police, it was decided that apart from deploying additional forces, sniffer dogs would be used to tighten the security. ?The RPF dogs are being kept at Liluah, from where they are being brought to the Metro stations every day,? Samuel said.

 High-level meetings were also held on Monday to review the Metro security arrangements. ?We have identified the loopholes and are working on plugging them,? said a senior police officer at Lal Bazar. Sources said 30 RPF personnel and 18 patrolling parties have been deployed at the stations.

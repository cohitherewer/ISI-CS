 SUBHRO SAHA

 Warmth and comfort, combined with style, mark the debutant range of home linenware

 No, we are not talking garments here, but home textiles. A segment, which was ?simply a necessary commodity? till now, is set to be catapulted into the domain of hip fashion, thanks to a clutch of lifestyle outlets planned in the city by home linen major Welspun.

 ?While we tend to change our shirts virtually every day, for fashion or for hygiene, the same hardly applies to our bedsheets or bath towels. Similarly, while we tend to pair our shirts with the trousers, our bedcovers and curtains could be weirdly disparate,? observes Anshuman Singh, CEO, Welspun India Ltd (retail division ? domestic).

 The company?s retail mission is to change that mindset and bring in the concept of ?fashion, hygiene and coordination? in the home textiles arena through a three-pronged initiative that will cater to the needs of all consumer categories ? the elite, the mid-segment and the discount freak.

 Welspun hopes to launch its first Spaces store inside a city mall in the next three months. ?The store will address the complete needs of home furnishing by offering a wide array of innovative products in the bath, bed and kitchen segments,? explains Singh. 

 Designed as a home to ?exude warmth and comfort?, Spaces will seek to provide ?critical inputs? to the Calcutta shopper in home linen fashion.

 For the super-rich, the company, a licensee of the internationally-renowned brand, will launch one or two exclusive Tommy Hilfiger stores in town. ?These outlets will showcase the latest in global home textiles fashion, from specially-printed towels with designer motifs to exotic bed linen and premium curtains,? Singh promises, lamenting that India spends only 1.5 per cent on home linen.

 All that could soon change, though, as in the next six months, Welspun will also bring to town store-in-store concept corners in multi-brand outlets like Shoppers? Stop, Westside and Pantaloons, besides two to three factory outlets selling export surplus at ?throwaway prices?.

 Welspun is the only textile company to have invested Rs 670 crore in production, when other market players were cutting down costs. ?That?s because we believe the next retail segment to really explode will be home textiles, and we are geared up to drive this as a fashion avenue,? Singh declares.

 Welspun India Limited, the flagship company of the $440-million Welspun Group, is targeting to become the number one home textile player in the country by 2006, riding on an aggressive retail foray.

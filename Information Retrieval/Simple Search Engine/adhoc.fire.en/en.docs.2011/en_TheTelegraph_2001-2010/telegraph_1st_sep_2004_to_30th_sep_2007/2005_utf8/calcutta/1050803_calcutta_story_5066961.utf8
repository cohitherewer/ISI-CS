 In a knee-jerk reaction to the recent blasts at home and abroad, city police have decided to train officers in police stations to handle emergencies on their own, instead of waiting for expert units to arrive. 

 At an exhibition of sophisticated gadgets at the Police Training School on Tuesday, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said henceforth, two officers from every police station would attend training sessions to keep themselves abreast of ways to handle these instruments. This would help police stations tackle on their own any emergency arising out of a blast or something equally serious. 

 ?Most officers are not aware of what is in store, or how to use specialised gadgets. The practice is to wait for specialised units to arrive and take charge. But on many occasions, things can be handled locally by using our brains. Just that the training has to be there,? Mukherjee said.

 To begin with, officers and their subordinates will attend a specialised course on handling ?trappings for explosives? and intra-explosive devices at the police headquarters on August 5. A.K. Maliwal, director of security, will conduct the session. 

 While the exhibition, held at the behest of the city police chief, was meant to offer all officers a glimpse of all the equipment and gadgets, it was also an occasion to make a quick check of what gadgets were in use and how effective they were. 

 ?The instruments and the equipment are fine, but some of them need to be maintained well. A few of them have become rusty, and others have not been used regularly. The superior officers who are new to the force should also keep themselves informed about these gadgets so that they know what to seek for before drawing up the list for modernisation,? Mukherjee said. 

 The exhibition and the drill was organised at ?Dojo? ? the gymnasium hall where police cadets undertake unarmed combat training. During the drill, some of the instruments failed to deliver, inviting stern criticism from the police chief.

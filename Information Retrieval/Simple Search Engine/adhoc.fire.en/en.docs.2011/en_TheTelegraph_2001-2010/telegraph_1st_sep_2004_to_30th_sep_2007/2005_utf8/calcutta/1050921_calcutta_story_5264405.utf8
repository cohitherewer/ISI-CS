The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The rules do affect the festival adversely as we have to compromise on many counts. In keeping the prescribed space of 12 feet on the road, our pandal has lost its centrality of position. This affects the line of vision of approaching visitors. Since our road is a winding alley, they can now see even the back of the pandal. So we are thinking of decorating that side with potted plants. Last year, the pandal was 30 feet wide. This time it had to be squeezed to 20 ft. We can accommodate lesser number of visitors inside at a time. So the queue will increase. It seems we will have to barricade the approach this year. Our neighbours had got accustomed to our arrangements all these years but of course we have to abide by the legal norms.

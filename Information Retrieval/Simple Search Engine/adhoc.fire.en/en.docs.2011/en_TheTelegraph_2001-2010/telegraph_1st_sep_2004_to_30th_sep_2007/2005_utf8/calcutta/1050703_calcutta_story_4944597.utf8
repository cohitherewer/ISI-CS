 Multiple magic

 Imagine singing along to music 

 in the bathroom while your mother watches a movie in the 

 bedroom and your father catches some soccer action in the 

 living room. All through a single system ? and simultaneously.

 Add pausing and recording live 

 television, viewing photo albums and playing your favourite 

 video games to the features-list and Korean giant LG?s MyHomNet 

 promises to be the single entertainment device you?ve craved 

 at home.

 At the heart of MyHomNet is Microsoft?s 

 much-touted Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 Operating 

 System, which allows integration of home entertainment experiences, 

 from photos to music, television to games and more.

 While LG is one of the few PC 

 manufacturers selling Media Center-enabled desktop PCs, 

 the company claims it is the only one to truly harness it 

 as a home entertainment device. ?We have taken it a step 

 further and created MyHomNet,? said R. Manikandan, general 

 manager (sales amp; marketing) of PC amp; Peripherals 

 for LG Electronics India.

 In MyHomNet, a single ?hub? (a 

 processing unit with a TV-tuner card and Windows XP Media 

 Center) can connect to multiple output devices like desktop 

 monitors, plasmas and projection TVs. Images, video, music 

 and other data are stored in this central device. This can 

 be connected to displays in various parts of the house through 

 wires or wirelessly, with the help of ?extenders?.

 MyHomNet allows a great way to 

 relive your personal moments. Store all your photographs 

 in an online library and watch them in slide shows on the 

 big screen. Ditto for home videos. The music library can 

 also be controlled and played from one of the displays. 

 As far as gamers go, they can play their favourite titles 

 on the large displays as well as battle opponents online.

 Much like the TiVo in the West, 

 this device can change the way television is watched here. 

 For instance, you can watch a movie while your favourite 

 television programme is being recorded for viewing later. 

 You can also pause live television and skip through commercials, 

 in real time.

 The Media Center has been around 

 for a while now, but it?s only with the latest edition that 

 Microsoft has actively started promoting it and licensed 

 original equipment manufacturers like LG to use it for extending 

 their entertainment offerings.

 LG has just soft-launched the 

 product in the city, with plans to promote it through CyberShoppes, 

 the first of which is slated to come up ?in a month?, according 

 to Manikandan. Available currently at select stores, the 

 MyHomNet models start around Rs 60,000.

 Staged as part of Nandikars ongoing 22nd National Theatre Festival, Jungle Me Mangal, produced by Awishkar of Mumbai, brings alive the traditional folk-style Maharashtras living theatre and is presented in the form of the popular tamasha. The Marathi adaptation of Shakespeare?s romantic comedy, A Midsummer Night?s Dream, the play is an amalgam of magical acts and comic capers interspersed with music and dance interludes. The plot is built around Suguna and her lover Sarjerao, who elope and run away to the jungle to evade the marriage arranged for Suguna by her father. Her other eternally optimistic suitor, Bajerao, follows close on their heels. Compounding the confusion, a Fairy Queen and her merry band join them in the jungle. What follows is some hilarious action, full of amusing twists and turns. Finally, true to the custom of a fantasy play, all complications are miraculously unravelled, and it ends on a note of joyous celebration. Direction: Chetan Datar.

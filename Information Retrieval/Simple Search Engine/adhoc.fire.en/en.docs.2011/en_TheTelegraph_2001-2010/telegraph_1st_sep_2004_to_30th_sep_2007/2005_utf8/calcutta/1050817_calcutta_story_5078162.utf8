The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 AC coach for pandal hop

 - 200 new luxury vehicles with snacks, beverages on board

 BARUN GHOSH

 Come October, crowded public transport need not be your only option to go pandal-hopping. Cosy, new air-conditioned buses will be available aplenty on city roads to take you from one puja to another. 

 Snacks and beverages will be served on board. You will even be able to tap your feet to piped music or watch videos while on the road. 

 The West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC), along with a private firm, promises to make this real. They have entered a joint venture to ply nearly 200 specially-designed buses, about 70 of them air-conditioned, in Calcutta during the Pujas.

 ?We have decided to launch the grand project during the Pujas to attract more passengers. If the venture clicks, more such buses will hit the roads in the future,? WBSTC managing director Asit Mondal told Metro on Tuesday. 

 Pirojiwal Timbers Pvt Ltd is WBSTC?s partner in the project. ?But we don?t have to spend a single paisa to ply the buses. The corporation will, instead, earn a substantial amount as licence fee by issuing road permits to the bus operators. We are targeting Rs 150 per bus per day,? Mondal explained. 

 Officials of the WBSTC said the popularity of the buses that ply between the Karunamoyee international bus terminus at Salt Lake and Dhaka and between Esplanade and Petrapole has prompted the introduction of more air-conditioned buses on city routes.

 ?The air-conditioned bus service to and from Dhaka and Petrapole is packed to capacity on every journey. There is a growing demand to introduce such services on city routes,? Mondal added.

 The WBSTC earns about Rs 6.5 lakh every year from the company that operates the Salt Lake-Dhaka service.

 A survey carried out by the WBSTC has bolstered the belief that air-conditioned buses will be viable on city routes. 

 ?People, particularly office-goers, will not mind spending extra to reach their workplace on time and in comfort. So, we are confident that the venture will be a great success,? said Barin Basu, managing director of Pirojiwal Timbers. 

 According to the WBSTC officials, passengers will be charged a minimum of Rs 10 for journeying in the air-conditioned buses. 

 For non-airconditioned buses, the fare will range between Rs 5 and Rs 6.

 At present, the corporation that operates buses on the Dhaka route charges 80 paise per km from a passenger travelling in an air-conditioned bus and 40 paise per km per passenger on a non-airconditioned bus. 

 The city routes have been earmarked in such a manner that passengers can avail of the services at important road intersections in north and south Calcutta. The buses will initially ply between the airport and Tollygunge, Salt Lake and Shibpur, and Salt Lake and Garia. 

 ?We are trying to rope in the Metro Rail passengers as well. They can take the buses from the stations for a hassle-free journey to their destinations,? said a WBSTC official.

 Talks have been initiated with the Metro authorities in this regard, the official added.

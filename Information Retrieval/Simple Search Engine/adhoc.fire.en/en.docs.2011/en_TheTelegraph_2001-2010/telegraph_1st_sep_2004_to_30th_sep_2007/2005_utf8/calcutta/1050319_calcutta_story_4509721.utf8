The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Fast forward to Formula track

Eye on Calcutta

Barry O?Brien

Calcutta?s rich pedigree in motor sports, dating back 

a century, is fuel enough to plan ahead for an entry into the F-league

(From top) The Inaugural Run, the first motor sports event 

in India, on August 20, 1904; Desmond Rendell, founder of Calcutta Motor Sports 

Club, at the wheel on Red Road in 1950; Kinny Lal, Indias first international 

racing driver in both Formula 3 and Formula 2, seen here with the Qmarri 

Super Saloon and the trophy he had just won at the Barrackpore Dirt Track in 1965; 

At the Alipore Mint Airstrip in 1955

If your children refer to me as ?Barry Sir? and belong 

to the generation that I am so warmly welcomed into, though don?t belong to, do 

me a favour. Keep today?s edition of the paper out of their reach. I know that?s 

a difficult thing to do ? with so much of it and something in it for each one 

in the family ? but do try! 

Right! Now that I have no reputation to keep, nor 

words to beep, here goes! Shakti Kapoor and I... don?t worry, you don?t have to 

hide the paper from your elderly parents too. Shakti Kapoor and I have two things 

in common: we get paid for being ourselves and have similar antecedents ? we are 

both descendants of a bandar! There is a difference though. He remains 

proud of his heritage and clings to traditional behavioural patterns, in an effort 

to make an ancestor of himself; I have stopped aping my primate forefathers, monkeys 

years ago. 

Though I have never been a bullish stakeholder in 

Shakti?s genre of monkey business, I was, as a youngster, quite nutty. Our circle 

of friends ? all of whom have since been tamed ? was deemed ?WILD!? No, we didn?t 

have the monkey on our back (an expression to describe those who do drugs!); but 

we did jump from one of the many trees there were then, to the next, to pinch 

daabs. I remember dressing up as a woman and hanging around Park Street, 

smoking a cigar. No, I didn?t raid my mother?s cupboard because I was an experimental 

cross dresser; I did it because I was playing the lead in a St Xavier?s production 

of Charley?s Aunt, who coincidentally, was ?from Brazil ? where the nuts 

come from?! 

Nothing stopped us! Nothing shocked us! Everything 

was cool, yaar ? till the day Niaz Ali invited us for a drive in his Fiat. 

We had just swum a race at the DI, which Nafisa, Niaz?s stunning elder sister, 

had won. We were drowning our sorrows over a double Campa Cola following our double 

defeat ? Nafisa had thrashed us and was rushing off for a movie with a guy who 

couldn?t even swim a stroke! Depressed, we decided to accept the treat. Goodness 

me, what a treat we had! 

Before we could say Dum Dum, Niaz was revving all 

the way to the airport. We soon realised what dum-dums we had been to sit in a 

car being driven by a man who took turns like Niki Lauda and risks like Charles 

Sobhraj. I?m not sure what route he took ? one usually isn?t if you have your 

head on your knees and heart in your mouth! All I know is that when he finally 

jammed on the breaks the car did a smart about-turn and we were facing the other 

way. As we got out of the car scratching our heads, we noticed that there wasn?t 

a scratch on the car. 

Niaz exclaimed that we had been christened and from 

that day forth, our faith would increase. It was quite like a baptism or mukhey 

bhaat at which adults have all the fun and Fish Orly, while the kid, who the 

tamasha is for, wants to get it over with. He was right, though. From that 

day on, we became drive-freaks. 

On a serious note, one must conclude that Niaz was 

brilliant at the wheel. He, the Kumars and several Calcutta drivers before them, 

were good enough to go the distance. Formula 3, for sure! That won?t come as a 

surprise if you are aware that it is the centenary year of motor sport in India 

? make that Calcutta! It was all of a hundred years ago when 11 of the 60 registered 

motor cars in the city ?raced? from Lord Dufferin?s statue, which was at the top 

of Mayo Road , to Barrackpore. It won?t come as a surprise if you are aware that 

India?s first motor sports club (CMSC) was founded right here in Calcutta in 1949; 

or that the Calcutta Grand Prix of 1953 was probably the first in Asia; or that 

through the sixties and seventies, Jaguars and Harley Davidsons burnt the Calcutta 

track. It won?t come as a surprise if you are aware of the fact that the Kanchrapara 

World War II airbase for Spitfires, the Mint Airstrip in Alipore and the RCTC 

track in Barrackpore, have all been raced on; or that in the seventies and eighties, 

Fiats and Ambassadors blazed the dirt-track at Barrackpore; or that Robbie Robertson, 

winner of the inaugural GP, built the first ?special? in India with a Jaguar engine 

and parts from, guess where? Mullickbazar, where else! It won?t come as a surprise 

if you are aware of the fact that in 1964, the CMSC built the first indigenous 

sports car in India, the Cheetah; or that the Kumars rebuilt their humble Herald 

into a race-winning brand, the Q?marri. 

So, Calcutta was the obvious choice when Formula 1 

was looking at India a few years ago. Not only did it have the richest heritage, 

the state has a CM who has his foot firmly on the pedal of progress. Buddhadebbabu 

manoeuvred every bend with Schumacheresque skills and hit the final lap to close 

the deal. He realised before anyone else, that an F1 track at Rajarhat would make 

the city a pit-stop for other commercial races and help zoom the economy nearer 

pole position. However, only months before the finish line was to be crossed, 

the Union government announced a ban on cigarette sponsorship in sport. BAT, the 

prospective sponsors, refused to bat on and retired hurt. 

Now, with Karthikeyan in the big league, the time 

has come to turn the clock back. After all, this is where the very best have raced: 

from the tall Brit boss of ICI, Mike Satow, to the local lad who flew Dakotas 

for a living, Dicky Richards; from the passionate Peters, Cowper and Adams, to 

winners who are still around, nonagenarian B.P. Feroze Shah, Suraj Singh and Bishu 

Shah; and of course, the best of them all, Kinny Lal! He raced F2 (there was such 

a thing then!) and F3 cars on the British and American circuits in summer and 

was back in Barrackpore for the winter. Stalwarts say he was good enough for F1, 

but didn?t have the means. If he did, Karthikeyan wouldn?t have been the first 

Indian in F1. In fact, he may not have been the second or the third, because many 

others would have taken to the sport over these 40 years ? as they will now. 

It?s now up to head honcho Ravi Kumar and the rest 

at CMSC to get things going. F1 looks tough, with a twentieth race being added 

to the circuit next year in Cancun, Mexico, but what about the rest? If Fiats 

took on Ambassadors, why can?t Esteems take on Ford Ikons? We could even go up 

to F3! There are loads of people in the city like my brother-in-law Jason and 

his wife Sabrena, who avoid friends and phone calls on F1 race days. I?m sure 

they and thousands of others will turn out; that means the sponsors will, too! 

As for the drivers, you bet there must be heaps of local talent strapped up behind 

many a steering. 

Who knows, Niaz could take the first flight out of 

Perth!

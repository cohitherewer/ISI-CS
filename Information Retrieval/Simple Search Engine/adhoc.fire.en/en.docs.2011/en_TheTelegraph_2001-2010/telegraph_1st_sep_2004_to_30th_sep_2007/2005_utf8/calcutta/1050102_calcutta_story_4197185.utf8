The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For wind beneath their wings

 The caged bird sings with a 

 fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and 

 his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird 

 sings of freedom. 

 ? Maya Angelou?s Caged Bird

 India is home to some 1,200 different 

 species of birds. Despite measures to ban capture and trade 

 of wild birds, records indicate that as many as 300 of these 

 species are caught and traded with impunity.

 In India, parrots contribute 60 

 to 70 per cent of the total live bird trade. Chicks (two 

 to four weeks old) are preferred to adult parrots because 

 they can be taught to mimic words. The chicks are removed 

 from their nests with curved needles tied to a rope that 

 are inserted into the nest cavities, entangling them.

 For every bird that makes it to 

 the market, two die due to cruel capture methods, in transit, 

 or of hunger, thirst and poor housing.

 As birds spread seeds, forests 

 remain intact. For every parrot or Munia that is kept in 

 a cage in a house, there?s one less tree in India. Under 

 the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960, it is illegal 

 to keep or confine any animal in a cage that does not measure 

 sufficiently in height, length and breadth to permit the 

 animal a reasonable opportunity for movement. It is totally 

 illegal to cage or trade any Indian bird which is listed 

 in the four schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act of 

 1972. 

 This is what you can do to stop 

 cruelty to birds:

 2Tell owners of caged birds that 

 the practice is illegal and cruel. Report bird owners, fortune-tellers 

 with caged birds and bird sellers to the local animal protection 

 group or law-enforcement authorities.

 2Release birds in a wooded area 

 with a water source, sprinkling plenty of birdseed on the 

 ground to ease the transition. If the bird?s wings have 

 been clipped, it can still be set free within an enclosed 

 area. If the wings grow back, wild-caught birds should be 

 released.

 The bird trade flourishes because 

 of ?collectors? of birds and you are encouraging it if you 

 have a caged bird at home. Won?t you rather begin the New 

 Year by going on a nature trail with your children and discover 

 birds where they belong?

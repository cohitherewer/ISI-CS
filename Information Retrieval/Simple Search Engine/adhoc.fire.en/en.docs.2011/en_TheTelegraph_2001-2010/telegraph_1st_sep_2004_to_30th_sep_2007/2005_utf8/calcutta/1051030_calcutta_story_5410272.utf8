 Message of a messenger

 The screenplay, the monologue and the actor were all made for each other in the Hutch campaign

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 I really enjoy the Big Fight(s). No, I am not talking about the television programme. My reference is to the pleasure of watching a contest between brands on television. The immediate trophy they compete for is not your purse, but your mind. The hope is that if they capture the mind, can the purse be far behind.

 I used to enjoy the battle royal between Surf and Ariel till both of them said enough is enough, let us make some money. The duel between Coke and Pepsi is a continuing one. Both claim that the battle helps the cola market as a whole, rather than any one brand. Believe it if you will, but enjoy it you must. New kids on the block are AirTel and Hutch. With sim cards in their hands, they have invaded our lives. If in one phase, AirTel scores with an A.R. Rahman tune, then you can be sure that Hutch will enchant you with the pug.

 The very latest in the series is a Hutch campaign. It has a very powerful spokesperson in Irrfan, of Maqbool fame. The campaign talks about full talk time from low-value recharges. It is a powerful communication in more ways than one. For a start, the simple proposition of getting as much talk time as the face value of the card has been transmitted very clearly, unambiguously and with credibility. Perhaps the more crucial achievement of the campaign is that it has successfully got the pithy message to emit an aura of corporate honesty. And this bolstering of the corporate image of Hutch probably happens amongst audiences that lie far beyond the immediate constituency of pre-paid customers.

 Another reason why this campaign is significant is because the campaign owes its success not to what it is saying but entirely to how it is saying it. Yet, the ad does not rely on fancy sets or a good-looking model to communicate its message. That is no mean achievement.

 The ad has many great things going for it. It has a very tight screenplay. There are a few subtle touches like the lift bell ringing to announce its arrival and Irrfan disappearing from the screen, ostensibly into the lift. It adds to the reality of the situation. Also, Irrfan?s monologue is very well scripted. They are surely some of the key contributors to the success of this ad.

 In my view, however, the piece de resistance is the choice of Irrfan as the protagonist in the ad. When one chooses a star for a celebrity ad, his glamour value is usually the major attraction. It boosts the noticeability of the ad in prime-time clutter. Additionally, the hope is that the love for the star will get transferred on to the brand.

 Unfortunately, there is a flip side of the story as well. Sometimes an Amitabh or Shah Rukh carries a duality on to the ad. The star personae and the character in the ad are often in conflict with each other. Consequently there always is a risk of dilution of the intended communication. Unless, of course, star presence is the only communication that is desired.

 In choosing Irrfan, the makers of the Hutch campaign have shown the courage to go off the beaten track. Irrfan the actor has already arrived but Irrfan the star is yet to be born. So he could not have brought any significant glamour value to this ad. Chances are that it was never intended. They wanted Irrfan to come to the party as an actor. Instead of distracting attention as a star, the screenplay begged for someone to enact the drama. Most importantly, through sheer acting ability, the actor had to impart credibility to the message. That this was achieved is possibly the main strength of the ad. The screenplay, the monologue and the actor were all made for each other.

 They say marriages are made in heaven. Once in a while ad makers also achieve such heavenly heights.

 Therapy for air ailments

 OUR BUREAU

 Arnab Chatterjee, an executive with a multinational company, has been irregular at work for the past few months. He has been suffering from lung impairment. 

 Chatterjee?s case may not be an exception, say experts, with more than 56 per cent of Calcutta?s population suffering from lung impairment.

 To fight the ailment, Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) has teamed up with the health department to set up a diagnostic-cum-research centre on air pollution-related diseases at SSKM Hospital. 

 The Air Pollution Related Disease Diagnostic Centre is part of a bigger plan, which envisages setting up of more centres for respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases.

 Health officials said the centre would function as an autonomous body from the hospital?s cardio-thoracic department from April.

 ?GAIL has given us Rs 20 lakh for setting up the centre. They also have plans to start a treatment centre here,? Santanu Tripathi, superintendent of SSKM Hospital, said.

 ?We have funded similar projects in other eastern states, like Tripura and Assam,? said A.K. Nandi Roy, zonal general manager, GAIL. 

 The organisation is promoting 22 such premier centres across India.

 Experts said the number of lung impairment cases was increasing alarmingly in the city, air pollution being one of the major causes. According to Twisha Lahiry, assistant director, Chittaranjan National Cancer Research Institute, 45 to 50 per cent of those suffering from lung impairment are non-smokers.

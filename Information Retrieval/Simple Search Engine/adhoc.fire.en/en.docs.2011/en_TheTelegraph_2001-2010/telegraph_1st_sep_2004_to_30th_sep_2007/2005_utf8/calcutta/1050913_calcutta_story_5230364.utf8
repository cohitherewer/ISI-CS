 Data belie dengue claim

 - 166 cases diagnosed in a day, larvae found in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya on Monday declared that the dengue situation in the city was ?under control?.

 During the day, 166 cases of dengue were diagnosed in Calcutta and its adjoining areas. The death toll did not increase from 18.

 The total number of dengue cases detected across the state has risen to 1,890.

 At Writers? Buildings, state urban and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya echoed the mayor. 

 ?Dengue detection is being properly carried out in Calcutta, which is why the number of cases seems high. But there is no need to panic. Dengue is completely under control in the city,? he said.

 The minister asserted that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was taking the necessary measures to prevent the spread of dengue and pointed out that the death toll had not increased.

 However, according to official figures, on Monday itself, 137 cases of dengue were diagnosed across Calcutta.

 Two more people were found to have been affected by the disease in Salt Lake, taking the total number of patients in the township to 50.

 The chief health officer of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority has been given the responsibility of tackling dengue in Salt Lake. He, along with a team of civic officials, surveyed the township on Monday.

 ?In many houses, residents have allowed water to accumulate for months in containers. Mosquito larvae were also found in mugs and pots stored in some buildings. Laxity of a section of people is posing a serious threat to public health,? said Sutanu Kar, executive officer of Bidhannagar Municipality, who accompanied the chief health officer.

 The municipality will undertake a survey of the township to identify unauthorised wells and water tanks, which are the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, Kar added.

 He explained: ?Councillors have informed us that there are a large number of unauthorised waterbodies in Salt Lake. We, too, came across some of them during Monday?s survey.?

 Back at Writers?, state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra promised to allot a contingency fund of Rs 50,000 for clean-up drives in some state-run hospitals in the city. 

 The minister had recently visited the Beleghata ID Hospital and was shocked to find clogged drains and accumulated water in several places.

 ?The minister had asked the authorities to clean up the hospital premises immediately,? a senior health department official said.

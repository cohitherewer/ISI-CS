 ?We help take the children?s classroom experience beyond routine, give them first-hand information on the hows and whys of science,? said a spokesperson for Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, where the annual Vacation Hobby Camp started on Monday. 

 The camp will run till October 26 but registrations will remain open till October 18. So far, around 50 students from various schools ? including La Martiniere for Boys, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Shri Shikshayatan, Loreto Day School Sealdah, Brahmo Balika, AK Ghosh Memorial and Lakshmipat Singhania ? have signed up. The number is lower than in the BITM Summer Hobby Camps because most schools no longer have extended Puja holidays, say museum officials.

 The hobby camps help develop technical skill so that students gain confidence to do their own experiments. The camps held in two sessions ? 11 am to 1 am and 2.30 pm to 4.30 pm ? focus on subjects like physics, chemistry, life science, geography and basic astronomy. 

 Students from classes V to X are divided into groups under trained instructors. The camp charges (Rs 300) are nominal, considering that all material and instruments are provided by the museum. Geography and basic astronomy, which has had the largest number of entries till date, takes students through model-building sessions. They get to build a sun dial, a star clock, and models on the solar system and eclipses.

 Those who opt for physics are taught to measure the specific gravity of solid substances, make models on the laws of refraction and reflection, measure sound velocity, learn how electricity can be generated and make an electromagnetic induction gadget. 

 Those who choose life science get the chance (rarely available in schools) of handling microscopes to study plant and animal cells and go on field trips. They can even dissect a cockroach or a goat?s eye to study the lens.

 Everything is graded according to age and learning capacity. Instructors have been told to give personal attention to individual needs. The course ends in an informal test, after which certificates will be distributed.

 Mediterranean magic

 Exotic belly and pole dancers from Marrakesh and Casablanca, bongo drummers, fire guzzlers and fortune-tellers. Open tents with laid-back low seating, an elaborate spread of lip-smacking delicacies, the choicest finger food to go with the single malts and enchanting music to embellish the magic milieu.

 Midnight in Morocco, the theme for Shishas first-ever outdoor bash to mark this New Years Eve, will transform Nalban into a typical Moroccan souk, recreating its attendant hustle and bustle through a clutch of characteristic elements.

 We decided on a Mediterranean theme since Shisha essentially dwells on a Mid-East concept and the December 31 night party is an effort to replicate a larger Shisha outdoors. Nalban gives us just the right setting for the theme with its courtyard gardens, trees, plants and patios to recreate a Moroccan market ambience, says Arvind Bhatnagar, head of operations, Grain of Salt, which runs the popular hookah bar.

 The venue will be done up in Moroccan style with low seating, bolsters, cushions and comfortable pillows to seat guests informally and ensure the Shisha connect.

 A huge dance floor is being created to accommodate the 2,000-plus guests expected, with Shishas resident DJ Girish manning the console from his perch 15ft above the ground to catch a birds-eye view of the audience and gauge its mood.

 We want to give the people of Calcutta an all-new party experience by delivering higher standards and making it a night to remember with an eye on every minute detail, promises administration head Pankaj Tandon. 

 While the cuisine will primarily be Northwest Frontier, rice and noodle bars will encourage interactive cooking on the last night of the year.

 Its not very pleasant when you have paid your way into a New Years Eve bash and have to wait in a queue indefinitely for your drink or dinner. By setting up ample food and beverages counters across the venue, we will ensure zero waiting, declares Tandon.

 While DJ Girish will use a melange of the usual Shisha fare to trace the evolution of popular dance music, a fireworks display will light up the night sky at the stroke of midnight.

 We will fly in an expert team from Mumbai to handle the fireworks, since those 10-12 minutes are extremely special and evocative as guests embrace each other and usher in 2006. The pyrotechnics must be suitably sensitive, stresses Bhatnagar.

 The Grain of Salt management, which has had the Nalban menu specially crafted by master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, is confident its core competence in F amp;B would set the big-bang outdoor bash of Shisha apart.

 Our experience of catering to a doctors conclave of 4,000-plus and a software majors annual meeting of 3,500 makes us confident we can deliver a product that could well become a signature tune in Calcuttas party echelons, says Tandon. 

 The party people can buy their Nalban passes at Grain of Salt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 House-owners will pay for tax swindle

 - Civic amenities: Pass the buck while the sewers are set right

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 House-owners who have no property tax pending but have misplaced the receipts may have to pay their bills twice for a particular period between 1997 and 2004.

 Thanks to manipulation of computer records by a section of civic employees ? two are in custody and at least seven more may be arrested ? several house-owners face the prospect of being shown as defaulters, fear officials.

 The most vulnerable are those living in the Kasba-Dhakuria-Jadavpur-Bijoygarh belt, as they deposit their tax at the Gariahat treasury, where the scam has surfaced.

 The amount defalcated by the racket by manipulating the records has been pegged at Rs 4 crore for now. The authorities suspect the actual amount may be many times more, as the computers of the revenue departments at other Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) offices are yet to be checked.

 An estimate put the amount pocketed by the racket since 1997 ? when computerisation started in the revenue department ? at around Rs 20 crore. 

 Officials said the records at the offices in Ramlal Bazar, Garia, Santoshpur and at the headquarters would be checked shortly. If the entries at these offices are found to have been manipulated, a source in the revenue department said, more than 40,000 house-owners may be tagged ?defaulters?.

 To tackle the situation, municipal commissioner Debashis Som has convened a meeting with chief of municipal finance and accounts (CMFA) Abdul Ohid, special CMFA Debotosh Dasgupta, chief municipal auditor Tapas Guhathakurta and the deputy municipal commissioner (revenue) Nandan Roy.

 Sources said the meeting is likely to decide that ?defaulter? house-owners would be exonerated from paying property tax twice if they could produce receipts of their previous payments. But those who have misplaced the receipts or fail to produce them for any reason will have to cough up the sum again.

 Of the two employees arrested on the charge of being involved in the scam, one is a peon in the assessment section (Arun Das) and the other an official in the treasury department of the Gariahat office (Sirajul Haque).

 The detective department of Calcutta Police has blamed the ?lackadaisical? attitude of the civic administration for the biggest civic scam ever.

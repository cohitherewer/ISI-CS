 Daylight heist in business district

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a daring daylight strike, criminals walked into the main building of Raja Katra, in Burrabazar ? one of the city?s busiest business zones ? and decamped with more than Rs 5 lakh, robbed at gunpoint from the landlord?s office.

 The gangsters walked into the three-storeyed building through the narrow corridors lined with hundreds of shops, went to the first floor, where the office is located, and pulled off the heist in 10 minutes.

 Senior police officers, including city detective chief Gyanwant Singh, conducted a spot investigation. ?It seems the dacoits had prior information about the money. Before committing the crime, they must have done some homework,? said Singh. However, no arrest has been made so far.

 Recounting the robbery, Gupteshwar Singh, assistant manager of the office, said: ?It was around 2.35 pm, and our landlord, Aloke Mundra, was not in the office. We five employees were busy counting the Diwali collection. Suddenly, a gang of six youths entered the office and drew the collapsible gates shut. Before we could raise the alarm, all of them had drawn out revolvers, which they aimed at us. They pushed four of us into an ante-chamber and locked the door from outside.?

 The intruders, all in their late 20s and speaking both Bengali and Hindi, did not touch the 82-year-old manager Jaleshwar Singh. ?I was sitting in front of the cash-box. One of them aimed a gun at my forehead. He demanded cash and I had no choice but to hand him the keys of the iron chest,? he narrated.

 Four of the criminals were busy opening the iron safe while two others stood guard in front of the main entrance. ?They took out all the money from the vault. Before leaving the room, they warned me not to shout for the next 10 minutes,? said the manager.

 Jaleshwar Singh opened the hatch of the ante-chamber and helped the other staff members out.

 ?On hearing their shouts, other shop and office-owners rushed out. But it was too late then. No one in the building had noticed the gangsters,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central division).

 The private guards of the building were on post-Diwali leave and a number of shops were closed on Thursday. The criminals must have been aware of this.

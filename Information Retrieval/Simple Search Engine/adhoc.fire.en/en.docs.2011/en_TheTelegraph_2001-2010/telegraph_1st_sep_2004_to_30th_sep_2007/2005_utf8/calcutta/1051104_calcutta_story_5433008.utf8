 Census tab on cabs and autorickshaws

 - Smart card clone for operators 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 How many autorickshaws ply in the city? The public vehicles department (PVD) says it has issued 10,000 permits and the traffic police puts the figure at 15,000, but the auto operators themselves maintain that the count is closer to 20,000. 

 No one is quite sure about the number of taxis plying in the city, either. It is estimated that more than 5,000 cabs are without permits.

 To help identify the vehicles plying illegally in and around the city, the PVD has embarked on a census of autos and taxis. According to the plan, data on each vehicle, including information about the owner, operator and the permits obtained, will be preserved digitally after physical verification. Tax receipts, insurance papers, hypothecation documents and pollution certificates will also be stored.

 The owners will have to produce their taxis and three-wheelers at the PVD office along with papers, which will be inspected by motor vehicles inspectors. If everything is in order, the owners will be given a card with a computer chip, similar to a smart card. All the relevant data regarding a vehicle will be stored in the chip.

 Officials said a new wing at the PVD office in Beltala would handle the census-related work. Once the exercise is completed, it will be mandatory for all operators to carry the card.

 ?Once the cards have been issued, we can keep a tab on the taxis and autos plying without valid papers. Traffic policemen and motor vehicles inspectors will impound vehicles on the spot if the operators fail to produce the card. The census will be completed within a month,? asserted PVD director H. Mohan on Thursday. 

 Secretary of the Citu-controlled West Bengal Autorickshaw Operators? Union Anadi Shaw admitted to the problem of three-wheelers plying without a permit.

 ?At least 7,000 to 8,000 autorickshaws have been brought to the city from Delhi and the neighbouring Bihar and Jharkhand. They are plying in Calcutta without permits or are using fake number plates. The illegal operators are eating into the business of those with their papers in order,? rued Shaw.

 He added that the union had welcomed the move to identify the illegal vehicles and impound them. ?We have already written to the PVD director and traffic police, offering our assistance in tracking down the illegal vehicles,? the union secretary stated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Sound waves from Down Under

 Australias hottest 

 new star MISSY HIGGINS speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about 

 the categorised American music market, singing in East Timor 

 and her future plans

 Sound waves from Down Under

 Her debut album, The Sound 

 of White, started at number one on the Australian charts 

 last September and since then, Missy Higgins has refused 

 to back off, sealing a place as the hottest new star Down 

 Under. In a telephonic chat, she took Goodlife on 

 a trip down memory lane and gave a glimpse of the future, 

 too.

 Start me up

 I was in middle school when 

 I first saw my Technicolor dream, recalls Higgins. 

 It was my first solo performance in school and there 

 was a spotlight on me and also a microphone. I remember 

 loving it very much and deciding to become a singer and 

 nothing else.

 It was her brother, seven years 

 older than her, who introduced Higgins to jazz music, which 

 would go on to be the basis of most of her musical creations. 

 I looked up to him, she reminisces. 

 He was writing great songs 

 then, which I found the most amazing thing to do. He also 

 had a jazz band of his own. So, then on I started listening 

 to a lot of jazz and even started singing with his band 

 for many clubs in Melbourne.

 But it was the demo competition 

 conducted by the alternative radio broadcaster Triple J 

 that turned the tide in Higginss favour. Still in 

 high school, her song All for believing quickly became 

 one of the stations most requested tracks of 2001. 

 I was 17 then and in my 

 final year, she recalls. I signed a deal with 

 a management and record label on the condition that I will 

 go on a one-year backpack trip of Europe before recording. 

 Thats something I had planned for a long time with 

 my best friend.

 Settling in

 After the year in Europe, which 

 helped her grow up as a songwriter and a human being, 

 Higgins started recording her first album. The opening 

 song was All for believing, which was the very first 

 song I ever wrote. I could have changed the words since 

 I had written it when I was all of 15. But I found something 

 really innocent about the song. I didnt want to tamper 

 with the naive flavour. I had written the song without thinking 

 how the audiences would feel about it. Something which came 

 instinctively, naturally.

 Her fascination for instruments 

 was also born. I got very interested in experimenting 

 with different instruments, explains Higgins. 

 I also wanted every record 

 to sound different. I wanted to draw from different influences. 

 So the use of strings could take me back to my liking for 

 classical music. Then there would be a horn and a whole 

 lot of percussion.

 The hit album was followed by 

 several trips to the US. The American music market 

 is so very different, she feels. In Australia, 

 there are radio stations for underground music, for non-mainstream 

 musicians. But in the US, its all so categorised. 

 If you dont fall under a category, you dont 

 get played.

 More to come

 Her musical journey also took 

 Higgins off the usual course to East Timor. Apart 

 from the military folks, there were really beautiful local 

 people. Some of the places there are amazingly different. 

 Its such a positive and optimistic country ? a really 

 heart-warming culture. And my show was such a big thing 

 for the local people there, who hardly get to hear any live 

 music at all.

 Higginss inclination towards 

 different cultures and traditions has also got her looking 

 to India for inspiration. While I havent quite 

 heard pure Indian fare, I love the sound of the Indian way 

 of singing. I am also a big admirer of London-based Indian 

 musician Nitin Soni. His music is not entirely Indian but 

 does have strong influences.

 Looking forward to more tours 

 in the US and the UK, Higgins wants to come to India, too. 

 It may not be the best time right now but I would 

 definitely like to come there as soon as possible. 

 The Sound of White, though, is available in India 

 for those who want to board the Higgins bandwagon.

 And variety, at the very least, 

 is what you can expect from this budding star in years to 

 come. I guess, I am a songwriter first, then a singer, 

 then a piano-player and finally a guitar-player. Quite 

 a line-up!

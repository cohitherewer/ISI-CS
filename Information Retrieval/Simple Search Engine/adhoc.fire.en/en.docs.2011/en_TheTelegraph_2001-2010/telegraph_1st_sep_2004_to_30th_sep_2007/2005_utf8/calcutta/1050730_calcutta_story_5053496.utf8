The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It?s time for some Tamasha Mumbai Istyle! That?s not just the theme of this play, but also the name of the Bharat Dabholkar comedy that?s coming to Calcutta on August 6. Presented by Sanskriti Sagar, the Bottoms Up group brings to town a ?titillating, topical, musical laugh riot?.

 Using the folk format, the presentation is a first in folk tamasha theatre, combining the modern with the traditional. The story centres around a king and queen in Bharatpur who are childless and on a continuing quest for an heir. And then the queen gets pregnant. By mistake or by intention...? 

 A colourful cast of characters including the loyal pradhan, the bumbling havaldar who dreams of becoming the police commissioner some day, a godman, a spiritual businessman and a US-returned gynaecologist who is actually a vet, add to the madness. 

 The sets, costumes and lights are extravagant. A dance troupe will also perform to folk-fusion music. Catch it at GD Birla Sabhagar, 6 pm next Saturday.

 Two distinctly different performances are lined up in August for the monthly theatre show at Bharatiyam, organised by the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, in Salt Lake.

 On August 9, at 6 pm, is Gorur Garir Headlight, by Natyasena. Businessman Swabalambi Ghosh sets out to form a theatre group, according to the wishes of his dead wife. An ad in the paper brings forward a confectioner as a playwright, and actors like one who stammers, a retired military man, a hearing-impaired individual, a usurer, a flirt, an opera actor and two ruffians. 

 Ghosh recruits his sister-in-law as an actress. But she is engaged in research on love and its effect on modern men and women. She starts experimenting on the hapless members of the group...

 While the comedy is sure to elicit more than a few laughs, on August 23, at 6.30 pm, is another Bengali play, but on more serious lines. Raktakarabi is directed by Shib Mukhopadhyay and presented by the group Natadha.

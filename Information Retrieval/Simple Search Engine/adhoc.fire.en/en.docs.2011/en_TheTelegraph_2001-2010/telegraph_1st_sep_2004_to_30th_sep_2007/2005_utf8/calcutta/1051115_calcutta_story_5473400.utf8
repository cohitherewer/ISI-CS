 - ?CALCUTTANS MORE ROMANTIC, NEED OPEN SPACE?

 Balkrishna Doshi: To soak influences and still stay rooted to the essence. A Telegraph picture

 Step out of your work station and into a caf? for a quick bite or catch a short film, or simply engage in dialogue with yourself at a serene waterside rendezvous. All this on multi-level decks wrapped around the existing urban fabric of this concrete jungle.

 If architect-planner Balkrishna Doshi has his way, Calcutta would be given a new plan, which would enable its people to have easy access to relaxation and entertainment destinations from their offices in the form of a vertical village.

 ?Man wants to share joy and sorrow, seeks a sounding board. If we can touch his emotions, we can release him from the trapped urban environment which has forced him to sever all ties with nature,? Doshi told Metro in his Ahmedabad shrine, Vastu-Shilpa Foundation, the NGO which researches built environment.

 The visionary, who gave the city its first taste of organised large-format housing in the shape of Udayan, The Condoville, felt Calcutta, more than any other city, needs the breathing space to grow and flower. ?Calcuttans are much more romantic and don?t like a set pattern. Hence, you have to break the mould,? he emphasised.

 Lamenting the lack of public spaces in the city, Doshi advocated a more sensitive approach by developers and designers and a ?human scale? to new projects. ?Why cant developers have in their team sociologists and poets, artists and film-makers?? he asked.

 The tilt towards IT is another reason why Calcutta needs more interactive spaces, he felt. ?IT burns out and devastates. So, you must create alternative antidotes through coolants,? Doshi stressed. 

 The multi-level parallel aerator spaces could be created as a pilot project in any given zone to make people aware of the need, he added.

 He felt Calcutta needs to adopt a style that is sympathetic to its cultural roots. ?Often, they are following a model which is not suitable for Bengal, but for Mumbai, Gurgaon or Singapore. It?s more of an implantation and swims against the trait advocated by Tagore, to soak influences and still stay rooted to the essence,? he pointed out.

 Doshi, who has now designed Upohar, on the other side of the Bypass opposite Udayan, again for Bengal Ambuja, admitted that creating the first complex was a more joyous experience, since the city was ?more impressionable? then.

 In Upohar, there is more interplay of connectivity, so that the common areas are shared better, he explained. 

 ?Today, we are talking of just demand-supply, not of love and even housing is a packaged commodity. Given the opportunity, I would love to do a sizeable community project in Calcutta, which would belong to the past, present and future,? Doshi said.

 He reiterated the need to return Calcutta?s river to its people, ?because it belongs to them?. The master architect called for a project to invite famous people to walk by the river and talk on it. ?Look what the European cities have done with their rivers. Calcutta can do even better, since its river is so wide, so sacred,? he observed.

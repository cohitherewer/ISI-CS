The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Vendors at Howrah maidan are seen selling cut-fruit stored in very unhygienic 

conditions. I even spotted a policeman buying the same. Monsoon is the season 

when people are mostly taken ill after consuming such roadside food. The Howrah 

municipality should take necessary steps to stop sale of such eatables in the 

open through regular raids.

 BSNL?s internet plan 499 runs at a very low speed. On certain days, it doesn?t 

work at all, and on others, its speed does not exceed 32 kbps. BSNL should launch 

an unlimited internet plan, other than the broadband service, for those who access 

the Net for more than six hours a day. For such customers, BSNL?s broadband connection 

is too expensive as they have to pay Rs 2 per mb for usage above one GB.

 Ration card holders are supposed to buy a part of their quota of ration from 

time to time to keep the card valid. However, it is often found that the fair-price 

shops do not stock essential items like rice, wheat and sugar. Just in order to 

keep the ration card ?alive?, card-holders are forced to buy items like exercise 

books and turmeric powder, which they can get at a cheaper price in the open market. 

The government should do away with this absurd rule when it can?t keep the shops 

well-stocked with low-priced items.

 In 2004, a ban on smoking in public places came into force in Calcutta. But 

even now, the ban is flouted openly. A recently-opened shopping complex in Salt 

Lake is one such place. Scores of young boys and girls can be spotted smoking 

in the open places there. During my visits to metropolitan cities like Delhi and 

Mumbai, I had noticed that the general public there is more aware of the ban and 

tries to abide by the rule. When Calcuttans consider themselves more rational 

and cultured than their counterparts in other cities, how can they afford to make 

mockery of a law in place?

 Residents of Kankurgachhi are helpless witnesses to encroachment of the boulevard 

on a portion of the CIT Road. Almost every other day a new shanty is coming up 

in the area opposite the post office here. The shanty-dwellers use earthen ovens 

for cooking every morning and evening and the resultant smoke pollutes the entire 

area. The residents in the neighbourhood are forced to shut their windows to keep 

out the smoke. We urge the local police and administration to immediately evict 

the settlers before they stake a claim to the land.

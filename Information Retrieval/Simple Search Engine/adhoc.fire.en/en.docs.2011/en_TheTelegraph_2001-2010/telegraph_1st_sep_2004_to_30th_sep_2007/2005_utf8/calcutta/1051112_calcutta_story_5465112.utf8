The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Many places of tourist interest, like the children?s museum and the Rabindra Sadan-Nandan complex, are located near the crossing of JL Nehru Road and AJC Bose Road. The intersection is also a busy one with a continuous flow of vehicular traffic. But unfortunately, pedestrians find it difficult to negotiate the footpaths in the area as some stretches are always wet and slippery. Authorities must check if there is a leak in the underground water pipelines in the area.

 The street lights on Lee Road, Woodburn Park Road, Allenby Road, Ray Street and in the nearby areas stay switched on even during daytime. Why don?t the Corporation staff attempt to avoid this waste of power? The money could be better spent.

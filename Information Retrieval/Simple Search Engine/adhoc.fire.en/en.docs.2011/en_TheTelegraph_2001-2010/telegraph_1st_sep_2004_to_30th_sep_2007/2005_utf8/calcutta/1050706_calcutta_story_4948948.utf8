 Fruit flavours with smiley skewers

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Available in sets of six, the skewers are simple steel rods ending in tiny forks. The fruits are made of polystone material, which is light and washable, but it is advisable to cleanse gently, lest the paint peels off.

The skewers also come with their own colourful holders, fashioned like fruits. While a whole guava stands on its own, a holder shaped like a slice of watermelon sits pretty on a plate. The carrot holders come in singles or bunches.

 Just in case you were in search of yet more dining table cheer, the orange holder comes topped with a smiley, hands and boots.

 Before you go bananas over the cute cutlery, check out the banana butter knife set as well. Also available in sets of six, the knives are topped with banana-shaped handles, in polystone. But its the knife holder that really stands to give your fruit basket competition. Shaped like a bunch of ripe yellow bananas, the lifelike look is heightened by one of the fruits in the cluster, which is peeled on top.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Feet funk for a steal

From trendy denim slippers to sexy tie-ups 

and chic pointed heels Himika Chaudhuri tries on a variety of shoes 

that score high on the fashion factor without pinching your pocket

Calcutta?s fashionistas have the world at their feet 

and at a price that is almost out of this world. Priced between Rs 100 and Rs 

250, this unique range of trendy and chic footwear can tempt even the brand-conscious 

buyer into switching loyalties.

A sudden boom that started about a year ago in the 

city, brought with it everything from flat slip-ons to pointed heels and sexy 

tie-ups for evening parties ? selling at half a dozen for Rs 1,000. A walk through 

the alleys of Metro Plaza, Vardaan Market and New Market (Old and New) is sure 

to throw up a mind-blowing range of options in materials including cork, jute, 

denims and foam. 

Interestingly, both the material and designs are imported 

from Southeast Asia, but the shoes are manufactured in India, which explains the 

low price points. ?We get design catalogues from abroad and also import parts 

of the shoe like the heel or the foam. But it?s put together in factories in Calcutta 

and other cities,? says Shamim of Valentinee, a store in Metro Plaza.

The other secret behind the dirt cheap price tags 

is often excess production, and not necessarily poor quality of work as one would 

readily presume. ?Most of these small shops have factories that cater to bigger 

shops or branded outlets. They usually have surplus of raw material or finished 

goods, which they sell at much lower prices,? shares an industry insider.

Though the pieces don?t come with warranty tags, the 

throwaway prices give you the opportunity to replenish your stock with the latest 

designs every now and then. Store-owners say that the designs go out of style 

every two months and after that it?s time to pick up a new pair.

Goodlife takes a walk around the city malls 

to check out the fare. 

Slip-on 

show

Comfortable and hardy, these pieces are made from 

cork and/or jute and have thick straps to make both wearing and walking comfortable. 

The colour of the base for the cork slippers are predominantly brown, while the 

jute slippers come in bright hues of greens and pinks. The colours of the straps 

range from muted shades of cream to classic black and vibrant red. Fit for everyday 

wear, these can be picked up by all age groups to team with any attire. 

Price point: Rs 100 to Rs 150

Denim dream

oth as a material for footwear has caught on big time, 

primarily due to the flexibility it offers to the designer in terms of colours 

and patterns. Denim coupled with leather-look straps and trimmings are best for 

those looking for a bit of funk.

Available in platform heels and flats, metal buckles 

and bead embellishments give these pieces a fashionable edge. A range of colourful 

bases in stripes and checks are also on sale. Though they wear the look of cloth, 

these are actually a kind of foam that allows the slippers to be washed and makes 

them suitable to be worn during the rains. 

Price point: Rs 190

Evening 

elegance

This section offers maximum variety and styles. Dalmatian 

prints on the base paired with transparent straps to electric blue straps with 

sequin work and pointed heels ? the options are wide. Be it the fit-for-weddings 

silver and golden coloured party shoe with elaborate work on the straps, or sleek 

black high heels with a hint of colourful sparkles glued to the almost non-existent 

strap, these are the pop picks for slipper shoppers. 

?These look more expensive than they are and one can 

actually pick up one to match each formal outfit,? feels Sristhi Nevatia, a regular 

shopper for these shoes. 

Price point: Rs 190 to Rs 250

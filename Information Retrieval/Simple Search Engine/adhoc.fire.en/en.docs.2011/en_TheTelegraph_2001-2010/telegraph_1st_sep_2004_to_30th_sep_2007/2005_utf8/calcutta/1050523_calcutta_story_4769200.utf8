 A favourite summer accessory ? the sarong ? can be draped in innovative ways, finds Ipsita Deb

 In 1998, soccer star David Beckhams picture in a natty little wrap-around number was splashed in newspapers and websites around the globe. Bangladeshi designer Bibi Russell has been creating waves internationally with her gamchhas and lungis for quite some time now.

 The sarong may go by different names across the world, but it never goes out of style. The two-metre rectangular fabric is draped differently in various parts of the world, but its essence is always the same ? it is a length of cloth that can be tied around the waist.

 But this traditional yet trendy summer accessory can be wrapped and twisted to create looks ranging from the cute to the chic. Tie it on the side for a sexy look, in the middle of the waist to cover your hips, around the chest like a tube top, as a shawl or stole or just spread it as a beach blanket. Whats more, theres just one size and so many styles to suit different body types. 

 The sarong is a versatile fabric that can be moulded into a multitude of styles. Being a flat piece of cloth, its very affordable, yet it can be used as a highly stylised garment, says Amita Raha, manager, Anokhi in Forum. 

 Model Kimberlene shows off different drapes with some stunning designs from Anokhi, which are ideal for a seaside getaway or even an adventurous evening out. 

 Regular wrap

 Wear your sarong as a skirt with a cute front twist. This style is simple ? just wrap the fabric around the waist from back to front. After making the necessary pleats and gathering the ends, tie it in a knot in front. 

 Tied at the hip after folding the sarong diagonally is another simple, yet elegant style. Kimberlene teams the sarong with a printed dupatta tied as a halter-neck top, by wrapping the fabric around her chest and tying the ends around her neck. Beaded chappals complete the ensemble. However, you can sport a tank top, a spaghetti or just a printed tee with this casual look. 

 Sari style

 Time next for innovation, but only if you have an adventurous streak in you. The style that looks much like the traditional Maharashtrian sari drape focuses on the pleats carefully made in front to produce a layered effect. 

 The method is not as simple as the previous one but not as complicated as it seems. But if you are lost, ask your father, brother or husband to pitch in with their dhoti-tying expertise.

 Bring the sarong from the back to the front and tie a knot. Take out fabric from both sides of the knot and, ensuring you have made at least three to four pleats, give it a firm tuck. For the top, the dupatta has been diagonally wrapped around the chest with the ends tied at the back. 

 Beach beauty

 A popular beach accessory, sarongs can be tied in a number of innovative ways to go with swimwear. The style Kimberlene flaunts is ideal for plus-sized women, who can wear it over their swimsuits to hide a bulge here and there.

 Sarongs are ideal as beach wear. Those planning a seaside summer getaway should definitely pack one of these. I personally prefer the regular wrap but when on holiday, experimentation with different styles is always fun, smiles Kimberlene.

Around the world, even today, depicting the Indian 

look is dictated by a dot. So when it comes to the bindi, the taste of 

tradition remains firmly embedded among make-up artistes in the country, beyond 

every style that?s a rage in the international arena. 

The result, of course, shows in the continuous and 

innovative use of the age-old dot on the forehead while creating different looks 

? be it the bride draped in her wedding finery or the contemporary smoky-eyed 

beauty who dons a fusion outfit at her best friend?s wedding.

Thus, from the plain vermillion bindi, women 

are now going for elaborate pieces made from American diamonds, coloured stones, 

pieces of fabric and so much more.

Bridal binge

?Deciding on the right kind of bindi to accessorise 

the wedding attire is as important as choosing the colour of the outfit. Because, 

a bindi can make or mar the look of the face,? says Rita Mohan of Rapunzel 

beauty salon, that creates personalised bindis for its clients. 

Designer wedding dots are catching up fast and these 

elaborate stone-studded and often fabric-textured bindis are almost an 

extension of the bridal outfit.

?I decide the colour and motifs to be used in the 

bridal bindi depending on the shade and design of the sari or the lehnga,? 

says bindi designer Jasmine Chanchania. 

?We ask the customer to give us a piece of the fabric 

and use either the material itself or the colour combination to design the bindi,? 

adds Rita. 

If the bride has an extended bindi stretching 

across her forehead, equally dressy but less elaborate pieces are created for 

her close friends and family. ?Age plays an important factor while designing a 

bindi, and one has to go for subtle designs for the elderly brigade,? says 

Jasmine. 

Dewdrop, which has a single stone drop in the centre 

and silver sparkles around it, is a big hit this wedding season. For the partygoer 

or the subtle dresser, single flat stones with a hint of silver around it is the 

order of the day, say bindi designers. ?However, it?s easy to achieve an 

elaborate motif by clubbing various small bindis,? reveals Rita. 

Hit hues

ues and pinks are doing well in the non-wedding section 

now, but red and silver stones remain the favourites for the wedding season. ?Bridal 

outfits usually have touches of gold or silver zari work, that?s why silver 

and gold stones do well in bridal bindis,? explains make-up artiste Prabir 

De, who uses a lot of designer bindis for bridal make-up. 

Accessory act

It?s not just bindis in their original and 

traditional form that are in vogue. Accessories made from these stone-studded 

dots are the new offerings from bindi designers. ?From armlets to earrings 

and even neckpieces, one can use bindis to make jewellery easily,? suggests 

De. ?One can make a sleek choker with bindis matching the colour of the 

outfit or try a hair accessory made from these,? he adds. These are not readily 

available and have to be ordered in advance. 

Pick-up points

Apart from salons like Rapunzel and June Tomkyns that 

sell these bindis, designers like Jasmine and Mahek Gupta do a good job, 

too. These can also be picked off the racks at Abhilasha in AC Market on Theatre 

Road and Radha Stores on Camac Street. The bindis are priced between Rs 

100 and Rs 1,500.

 Men in khaki: Target of public ire 

I did not know before going through your report ?Three 

cities and their parks?, January 24, that the Maidan, the lungs of Calcutta, is 

more than double the size of Hyde Park in London and only slightly smaller than 

Central Park in New York. 

 But while Hyde Park, Central Park and other parks in big cities around the world are properly maintained, the Maidan is at the mercy of the politicians and the judiciary. 

 Since childhood (I am 57), I have been wondering why the Maidan is bereft of tall, flowering trees arranged in neat rows and I still haven?t figured out the answer. 

 Planting of trees like debdaru and neem for greenery and palash, shimul and krishnachura for flowers can only add to the beauty of the Maidan. 

 These trees can withstand the Calcutta climate and absorb polluting gases more efficiently than most other types of trees. The area where Calcutta Book Fair is organised would be an ideal spot for planting the trees. They would add considerably to the beauty of the surroundings. 

 The Book Fair can be continued at the same venue without uprooting the trees, which would, in fact, provide shade to the visitors. 

 Shifting the Book Fair to the EM Bypass is not a good option. What about the people who do not have transport of their own and those who come to the city from outside to visit the fair? Moving the annual affair from the Maidan would inconvenience them greatly. 

Piyush Banerjee,

Sarsuna. 

The report ?Buddha block bays for bookie blood?, January 26, underlines how police and anti-socials have formed a symbiotic relationship. 

 Though the report talks about the inactivity of the personnel of Karaya police station against criminals, the scenario is more or less the same in other police stations in the state. 

 It is astonishing that despite the area falling under the constituency of Mamata Banerjee and not being far away from the chief minister?s residence, the police officers dare to harbour satta gangs under their wings. 

 With such anarchy prevailing, it is not surprising that the crime graph is soaring. Even the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission has expressed concern about the spurt in crime against women in the city. 

 Given the situation, can the common people be blamed for not having faith in the police any more? 

Debyani Basu,

Birati. 

It is an open secret that there is a nexus between 

police and satta bookies and other criminals. Satta rackets are 

run in most parts of Calcutta with the help of cops. Ministers, including the 

chief minister, will not be able to stop gambling, whether it is online or off-line, 

in the city. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

Rakhal Ghosh Lane.

The report ?Rights rap amp; probe?, January 26, was an eye-opener. It has become almost ethical to take bribes. So the police do not spare cyclists carrying goods, even if they pay only a rupee. Refusal to oblige results in consequences like harassment or even beating. 

 The situation is no different in police stations. It is useless for the chief minister to harp on work culture in a state where most residents have been victims of the police, in one way or the other. 

Madhabi D. Ghosh,

Salt Lake. 

Apropos the report ?Library boon for research?, January 28, it is wonderful that Calcutta University?s central library has opened a section on business history. The section is yet another feather in the cap of the 157-year-old institution. 

Prahlad Agarwal, 

Majdia, Nadia. 

The 148-year-old Shibpur Bengal Engineering College, which was recently recognised as a full-fledged university, deserves the status of an Institute of National Importance (INI) (Shibpur varsity eyes tag for Delhi grant, January 22).The status would help the institute procure financial aid to develop infrastructure and improve the standard of teaching. The state government should assist the institute in its quest for the honour. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road.

Apropos the report ?Show your tongue, Calcutta?, January 24, Gunter Grass? views on Calcutta of the present would be of immense interest to residents of the city. He is a keen observer and does not shy away from discussing controversial issues. Hopefully, this visit will inspire Grass to pen another book revolving around Calcutta. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee,

Nayapatty Road. 

Payment problems at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation counters are nothing new (Counters few for tax-payer count, January 24). Not only has the old system not been revamped, it has been made more complicated. A lot more people would have benefited if the mayor spent some of the time, energy and money in advertising the tax-waiver scheme in improving the efficiency level of the civic body staff. 

Shiv Shanker Almal, 

Lower Rawdon Street. 

Apropos the report ?Job beeline for IIT biz school kids?, January 26, the picture is not as rosy as it appears. Job-hopping and retrenchment are rampant in the corporate world. Add to that the perpetual anxiety of a forced handshake at the end of the accounting year. No wonder many bright students still prefer the security of the civil services. 

Jatindra Nath Bhowmick,

Kalyani. 

The interview of Ashok Mehta made for interesting reading (I?ve changed the colour of mainstream cinema, January 25). It came as a timely reminder that people behind the camera contribute as much as, or even more to the final product than, the people in front. 

Anil Kumar Sen, 

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 GenX thrust in growth graph

By the book

 To scale up the scope of management development programmes and the evening MBA programme for working executives, the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta is ready to move into a new facility in the city. 

 The government had given a Rajarhat plot to the premier B-school and the authorities are bullish about commissioning the facility in 2005.

 The second campus of St Xavier?s College, off the Bypass, near the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, will be on a six-acre plot. It will have a media centre, post-graduate departments of biosciences, information amp; technology as well as a management centre, with plans to introduce short courses in astrophysics, photography, business finance and export and import. 

 Though the project will require five to 10 years, a portion of the basic foundation work should be ready next year.

 On the school front, Calcutta International School is bidding adieu to its Lee Road premises and heading for the Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital. At over two acres, the campus will be more than three times the size of the present school, but the student body will be kept small.

 The third instalment in the growing Delhi Public School brigade in Calcutta will also open its doors to students from the new academic session in 2005, this time at Rajarhat.

Maidan bypassed

 The city centre will lose much of its winter colour, with fairs shifting eastwards ? for the Maidan action, as we know it, is finally moving to the Bypass this year. 

 This, environmentally speaking, is good news for the green that has been trampled year after year by lovers of books, leather, handicrafts and what not. 

 No more heaps of trash, no more anxious feet crushing tender grass, no more fights about who gets to clean it all up. But will the Bypass fall foul of the Maidan fair load?

Club culture

 Most traditional clubs are keen to present a younger countenance to draw GenX crowds. In this effort, 2005 will be the watershed, with renovation and reinvention touching food and fitness, look and leisure.

 With the rules of the club game changing, Ocio, the leisureplex at Alipore, should unveil all its facilities by the first quarter and even keep a parallel channel open for walk-in, pay-and-play users.

 Another significant addition to the new-age clubbing matrix will be Spring, slated to open its doors in June. 

 Located inside the premium Silver Spring residential complex on the Bypass, the club will have a heated swimming pool, air-conditioned indoor playing arena, rooftop tennis court, a state-of-the-art health club, business lounge and ?unique tutorials? in yoga, meditation and different forms of performing arts.

 Royal Calcutta Turf Club, ready to transform its Russell Street premises into a swank city social club, hopes to launch the first phase of its membership around March, according to the stewards. 

 The turf club authorities are also keen to begin work on a gradual makeover of the race course.

 Royal Calcutta Golf Club, the oldest outside the British Isles, hopes to become ?the best golf course in Asia? in the next two years by acquiring better equipment, like fairway aerators and green polishers, and also through better maintenance. ?Much of the action on the course, remodelled by Peter Thompson, should begin by March,? says immediate past captain Ashit Luthra.

 The Dalhousie Institute sports complex is also slated to get underway in 2005.

Small Screen

 Tune into a flurry of new channels this year. 

 STAR News focuses on regional, with the launch of its Bengali channel, while the bull-bear line defines three new beams. Zee Business News is already on air and one each from NDTV and TV18 is revving up. Kids gain with Disney Channel and Toon Disney, while music-lovers (of the phoren flavour, that is) can rock to VH1.

 The other prime point: the beam-and-block cable industry finally starts to clean up its act, with the state government completing a ?cable census? and laying down rules for service providers. 

 Switch on or switch off? Let?s wait and watch.

Big Bite

 Kentucky Fried Chicken?s debut is big among a significant chunk of the Calcutta consumer. That?s at City Centre, where Mainland China is also slated to open its second address, but in a different avatar. 

 Also worth digging into is Amber?s foray out of Waterloo Street, the consolidation drive by Grain of Salt, Tangerine, Star Struck and KK?s Fusion. 

 Another significant new addition will be Dalchini, an 80-cover Indian-Chinese restaurant on Camac Street, from the popular Bar-B-Q stable.

 STAR amp; STYLE

 Having fun will be even more fun in 2005, as party places up the tempo. 

 The Park has major expansion and revamp plans, with Tantra not only expanding, but possibly multiplying. ?A truly international experience for the city?s party animals,? is all that Anirban Shimlai, director F amp;B, would hold out the promise of. 

 At another end of town, the Hyatt nightclub is finally happening this year.

 If fun is in focus, can food be far behind? At least five new food places are starred in 2005. 

 ITC Sonar Bangla plans to revolutionise the way Calcuttans eat healthy with a 30-seater wellness caf? that will serve Spa cuisine.

 The HHI is all set with a lounge restaurant to dish out Mediterranean and Mexican cuisine. A new restaurant is also on the cards at The Golden Park.

 Going international this year is popular city nightspot Shisha. The first hookah bar in town plans to branch out to Singapore and London in 2005. 

 But Camac Street won?t be losing out, with a new resto-bar and a nightclub covering one-and-half floors on the eighth and ninth levels of the Jewellery Mall.

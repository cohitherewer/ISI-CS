 Probe ordered into cop-realtor nexus

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to probe how some city policemen and a prominent realtor allegedly joined hands to evict tenants from a south Calcutta property with the help of forged court documents.

 In a strongly-worded directive, Justice Girish Chandra Gupta asked home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy to investigate the alleged nexus between officers of Gariahat police station and the property developer and his associates, all of them well-known. 

 ?The home secretary is advised to initiate strong action against Gariahat police station if the allegation of its complicity in the wrongful eviction (of tenants) is found to be true by the inquiry,? Justice Gupta said, while disposing of a petition filed Priyalal Bhowmik, one of the tenants.

 In his writ petition Bhowmik, owner of clothing outlet Khadi Emporium, described how a large team from the police station, accompanied by the realtor?s men and a bailiff from Alipore court, forced their way into his store and four adjacent shops, at 145, Rashbehari Avenue, on March 5.

 Within minutes, the realtor?s men, with assistance from Gariahat police, allegedly started demolishing the shops and carried on through the day. 

 ?On being asked, the policemen showed certain court orders, which later turned out to be forged,? the petition claimed. 

 Providing the details of the police operation, Bhowmik?s counsel Supradip Roy said the day of the demolition was chosen to coincide with the visit of Hugo Chavez, President of Venezuela, to the Lakes, a short distance from Rashbehari Avenue. The chief minister and other dignitaries had accompanied the President, keeping police busy in arranging for their security, the lawyer stated. 

 ?My client tried his best to bring the illegal act to the attention of the police bosses, but none responded because they were busy with the visit,? Roy added.

 Cash and goods worth Rs 2.5 lakh had been looted in the course of the demolition, he claimed. 

 It was also brought to the court?s attention that the developers carried out the operation using forged documents after agreeing ? under a compromise decree passed earlier by a trial court ? to provide monetary compensation and space for business on the same premises.

 The court allowed Bhowmik to initiate a case demanding restoration of the lost space.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 There is an urgent need to construct underpasses and footbridges in some busy 

road crossings in Calcutta. Underpasses are required at Brabourne Road, extending 

from Illaco House to Tea Board; Old Court House Street ,near Telephone Bhavan; 

near the Brabourne Road-RN Mukherjee Road crossing; the GPO in BBD Bag and the 

busy Mayo Road-JL Nehru Road crossing. The underpasses should remain closed at 

night so that they are not dirtied by vagrants or misused by criminals.

 Dhaka more is the narrowest stretch of Prince Anwar Shah Road. It is 

made even narrower by a minibus stand and a taxi stand. Driving through or crossing 

the road there is a harrowing experience. After the inauguration of the Lake Gardens 

flyover, the traffic on the road has increased manifold, leading to further chaos. 

Shifting of the minibus and taxi stands and erecting road dividers is the need 

of the hour to prevent mishaps at the crossing.

 Jagdish Kumar, CR Avenue. 

 Howrah station looks shabby and disgraceful due to the practices of hawkers, 

who regularly dump leftovers and garbage at the base of the pillars. The vendors 

often spill water on the platform, making the floor slippery. Even the tracks 

are littered with waste and excreta, adding to the pollution at the station. The 

area outside the station is no better. Taxi drivers urinate on the walls due to 

lack of public toilets in the area. The authorities should give the station a 

facelift. 

 Sunil Banerjee, VIP Road. 

 Karunamoyee island is one of the busiest crossings in Salt Lake. On any weekday, 

3 pm onwards, autorickshaws and chartered buses crowd at the roadsides to pick 

up passengers. As if private vehicles were not enough to clog the road, even Calcutta 

Tramways Company buses stop here for passengers. Those waiting for the buses have 

to stand in the middle of the road to check the bus route numbers. Though some 

traffic policemen are posted here, they don?t take any initiative to clear the 

snarl. Authorities must change the traffic system here to avert accidents.

 Sourish Misra, Salt Lake. 

 During a recent visit, I found that the ground at Deshbandhu Park was dry and 

hard, with no grass. I feared that my five-year-old daughter might fall and hurt 

herself badly. Children?s parks should be given special attention and maintained 

well.

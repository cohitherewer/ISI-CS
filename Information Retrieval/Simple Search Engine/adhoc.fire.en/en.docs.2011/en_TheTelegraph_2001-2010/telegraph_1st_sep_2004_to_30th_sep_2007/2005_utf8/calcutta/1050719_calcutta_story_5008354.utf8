 It's Your Birthday So...

 Always busy with a plan, your analytical, active mind keeps you flowing forward. Not outwardly romantic, there is passion within you and you?re an emotional softie. A good cause always touches your heart and you?re always ready to help the weak. You enjoy your own company and don?t mind being alone. ??Kusum Bhandari

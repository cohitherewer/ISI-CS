The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Focus on fair trade fare

 - Justice, empowerment mission of craft and lifestyle showcase

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Traditional weaves and vegetable dyes from Andhra Pradesh, palm-leaf baskets from Kerala, stone home accessories and costume jewellery from Uttar Pradesh, tribal terracotta and iron crafts from Madhya Pradesh, organic dals, rice and spices?

 It?s not just another exposition. Being held for the first time in Calcutta, the Crafts, Textile amp; Food Fair (at Ice Skating Rink, November 4-6), presents a kaleidoscope of works of numerous fair trade organisations from all over the country and strives to create opportunities for economically-disadvantaged producers.

 Hosted by the Fair Trade Forum (eastern chapter), the social development fair will showcase lifestyle products, traditional crafts and textiles, organic and natural food items and accessories by artisans, craftsmen, various producer groups and fair trade marketing organisations.

 The fair is being organised by Sasha, Silence, Madhya Kalikata Shilpangan (MKS), CRC and Equitable Marketing Association (EMA), all members of the Fair Trade Forum-India (FTF-I). Of the 35 participants, 40 per cent are from the East.

 ?The fair is an attempt to promote our artisans, to market their products and obtain recognition for their efforts in the domestic market,? explains Roopa Mehta, secretary, FTF-I. The forum is also providing them space at the fair to demonstrate their skills, ?the primary calling card?.

 The mission is to promote fair trade practices among all the stakeholders, and also educate the consumers with the core message of fair trade, which espouses economic justice, not charity, and empowers people and communities, Mehta points out.

 ?The fair will exhibit high-grade, export-quality handcrafted green products. These are environment-friendly, organically grown, sustainably harvested and responsibly produced,? says Chanchal Sengupta, associate secretary, FTF-I.

 Fair trade is a trading partnership based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade, according to the International Fair Trade Association (IFAT), headquartered in Holland.

 In India, the key principles of fair trade being followed by the national forum include, besides creating opportunities, transparency and accountability, capacity-building, ensuring payment of fair price, gender parity, ideal working conditions, fair wages, environment protection and prevention of exploitative child labour.

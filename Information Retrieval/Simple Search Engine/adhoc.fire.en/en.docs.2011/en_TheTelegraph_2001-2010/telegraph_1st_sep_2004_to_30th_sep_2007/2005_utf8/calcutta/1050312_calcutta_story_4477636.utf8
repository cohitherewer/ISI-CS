 Taking the cue from Victoria Memorial Hall and Eden Gardens, the National Library authorities have decided to restrict use of the 35-acre premises by morning walkers.

 Though an entry fee for the walkers will not be introduced right away, the authorities will issue photo-identity cards to each of them, in view of a recent order by the Centre to tighten security arrangements at the library.

 ?We will issue photo ID cards because we want to ascertain who exactly are using our premises every morning,? library director Sudhendu Mandal said on Thursday.

 Residents of Alipore and Hastings use the sprawling library campus for constitutionals. ?Of late, the number of morning walkers on the library grounds has gone up, as entry fees have been imposed on walkers at the Memorial and Eden Gardens. Our securitymen have informed us about the increase in the number of morning walkers,? said a senior library official.

 Library director Mandal said he had so far received more than 1,000 applications from morning walkers. ?All of them have submitted two copies of passport-size photographs for the identity cards. We might have to restrict the number of morning walkers because of security reasons,? Mandal said.

 The Centre?s department of culture had asked the National Library authorities to strengthen security at the library, in the wake of the theft of the Nobel prize at Santiniketan and that of the Buddha head from Indian Museum.

 Following the instruction, a private security agency was engaged to step up vigil at Bhasha Bhavan, into which lakhs of books and journals are being shifted from the original library building.

 ?The shifting process is on 24 hours a day and allowing in morning walkers for three hours from 6 am is taxing on the securitymen,? an official said. 

 The library has its own guards at the main building. However, 17 out of the 45 posts of security personnel are lying vacant.

 Private securitymen were deployed on March 1 after the Union government cleared the proposal of the library authorities to engage them in order to strengthen the security network at the library.

 Court mends a marriage

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Having been successful on six earlier occasions to patch up troubled marriages, Calcutta High Court on Thursday asked a battling couple to stay in a rented apartment for a while and sort out differences.

 The judiciary had earlier succeeded in reuniting estranged couples. The latest attempt to reunite Sneha with her husband Suraj Dokania seems to be working as well.

 A division bench of the high court on Thursday sent the Dokanias to a flat in Pathuriaghata, rented by Sneha?s father, so that they could live in conjugal harmony. 

 The bench, comprising Justice A. Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra, had tried to re-unite the couple after six family members of husband Suraj Dokania, a dance teacher living in Serampore, Hooghly, prayed for anticipatory bail. 

 Suraj was fearing arrest after his wife Sneha lodged a complaint with Serampore police station against him and his family members under Section 498 A (cruelty and torture on women) of the IPC.

 Appearing for Sneha, her advocate alleged that Suraj was having affairs with his dance students. When Sneha protested, her husband barred her entry into his house in Serampore. Since May 3, Sneha is being forced to stay at her parents? house in Lake Town, her lawyer said. 

 A fortnight ago, the court had passed an order asking Suraj to escort Sneha from her parent?s house every day, so that she could remain with him while he trained his students. 

 The judges had directed the Dokanias to return to the court after a fortnight and report about the relationship between themselves.

 Accordingly, they came to the court on Thursday and told the judges that they had decided to stay together for some time and work out a reconciliation. 

 ?Sneha?s father has written to his son-in-law, Suraj, asking him to join his company as an accounts assistant. He offered him a salary of Rs 5,000 per month,? additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said. 

 This is not the first time that an estranged couple has been asked by the court to settle its differences. 

 In one such case, the court had directed a couple to stay in a hotel and come to a settlement. In two other cases, the court had asked couples to go to Puri, settle their troubles, and report to it.

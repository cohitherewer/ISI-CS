 Ain?t we cool, asked Ishaa Koppikar and Tusshar Kapoor as they breezed through town promoting their ?naughty comedy? Kyaa Kool Hain Hum. While they want to do meaningful Bengali films, both Jeetendra?s son and the item girl are choosy about the script and the director. Ishaa will return to Khallas mode with Ram Gopal Varma?s new film D and Tusshar will do more comedy in the future.

 Ramp rage

 Kali boutique in Alipore celebrated its 10th anniversary in style recently. Apart from doing up the store in colourful sequins, a sizzling fashion show was part of the celebrations, displaying seven design collections.

 The show kicked off with Varun Gandhi and Rahul Khanna, whose style of simple, straight lines stood out in each of the creations.

 Next on the ramp was Manju and Bobby Grover?s line of shirts and ponchos dominated by bright colours and geometric patterns on flowing fabrics. The look was young and stylish.

 Niki Mahajan wowed with vibrant colours, bold prints and interesting dyeing techniques. Her special occasion wear and pret clothing lines comprised lehngas, corset tops, skirts and dupattas. 

 Aki Narula?s collection of leisurewear in pastel shades provided a sharp contrast.

 Things got a little arid with Chanda Gupta?s creations inspired by the sand dunes of Rajasthan. The result was a range of salwar suits in a combination of cream and gold on muslin. 

 The flow continued with Geisha, the label of Paras and Shalini, displaying a wide spectrum of silhouettes and styles using floral patterns.

 The last sequence was an ode to the most sensuous garment of them all, the sari. Designed by Anju Mody, the range of embroidered saris was teamed with interesting blouses boasting plunging necklines. 

 Sandwiched

 Life just got easier for those living in the fast lane. Grabbing a bite on your way to office or a quick lunch would now have more variety with Biscotti in Forum unveiling a sandwich bar. 

 The special counter at the confectionery shop stocks white and brown bread, croissants and whole-wheat bread to choose from. The customised option involves a choice of spreads and fillings. Goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and mayonnaise are some of the spreads, while one can choose to fill up with grilled vegetables, Russian salad, a variety of lettuce, salmon, chicken salami and eggs.

 ?People have varied tastes in sandwiches. So we thought it makes sense to let the people do their own choosing as they would in their kitchen,? said Kanta Mittal, director of Biscotti.

 The sandwiches are priced between Rs 45 and Rs 95.

 Third bake

 What better way to celebrate the birthday of a bakery and confectionery than to introduce some yummy chocolate pastries and fresh bakes?

 And that?s exactly what Escoffier, the confectionery brand on Sarat Bose Road which turned three last week, offered as birthday treat.

 Gooey Creamy Fudge Pastry and Original Oreo Pastry were the birthday digs in the the sweets section, while eggless breads in the bakery section remained the centre of attraction even on the big day.

 There was yet more reason to cheer with prizes sponsored by Patchi, Little Shop and Dolphin Leather going out to customers every hour.

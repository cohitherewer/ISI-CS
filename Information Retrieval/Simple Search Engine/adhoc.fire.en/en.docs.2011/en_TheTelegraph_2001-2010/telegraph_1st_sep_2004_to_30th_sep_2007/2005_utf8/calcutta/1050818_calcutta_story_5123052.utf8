 Doubts over motive in boy murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eleven-year-old Saddam Mollah disappeared from his neighbourhood, Purba Para, under Howrah?s Sankrail police station, on Monday evening. 

 His body, with strangulation marks on the throat and hands and feet bound, was found in a field in Manikpur, close to his home, the next night.

 ?He was strangulated with a rope. A murder case has been registered and search is on for the killers,? said Basab Dasgupta, additional superintendent of police (rural), Howrah.

 Police are baffled looking for possible motives of the murder. 

 ?Who could have abducted Saddam, whose father is a daily-wager and family subsists below the poverty line? Besides, from what we have gathered, the boy never mixed with criminal elements. He had a clean record,? said an officer working on the case.

 Another officer said all possibilities were being kept in mind by the sleuths. ?We are not ruling out anything and are probing the abduction and murder from all angles. The case is likely to be solved soon.?

 At 8 pm on Monday, Saddam?s father, Akbar Mollah, had sent him to a jewellery shop near their house to repay a debt of Rs 100. 

 The boy did go to the shop 10 minutes later and paid the money, as the owner testified to police. But he did not return home.

 Father Akbar went to Sankrail police station a few hours later and told the officers about his son?s disappearance. 

 ?Immediately after the complaint was lodged, we alerted all arms of the force and contacted police stations and investigation centres at Panchla, Manikpur, Nazirgunge and Uluberia. These are the places where Saddam?s relatives and acquaintances live,? said an officer.

 The sleuths also asked for a photograph of the boy, which they wanted to circulate among various police stations. But before an effective search could be launched, the body was discovered.

 The jeweller told police that when the boy visited his shop, he was wearing a T-shirt and a pair of trousers, the outfit in which the body was found the next day.

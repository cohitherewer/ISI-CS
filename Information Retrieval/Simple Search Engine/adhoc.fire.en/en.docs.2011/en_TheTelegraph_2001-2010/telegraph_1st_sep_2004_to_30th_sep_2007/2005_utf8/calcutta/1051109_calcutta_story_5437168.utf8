 AP Jewellers at 21, Camac Street unveiled an exquisite collection of bridal jewellery titled Vivaha last week.

 The collection stands out for the fine finish, intricate detailing and guaranteed quality. The designs are in-house and a blend of ethnic and contemporary styles. Our collection will also suit most pockets, says director Arun Poddar. 

 Gold and diamond combined with rubies, emeralds, tourmalines, amethysts, aquamarines, topaz and a host of other precious and semi-precious stones make stunning pieces. While in some the gold is rhodium polished, in others it is frosted or retains its usual shine. Theres a variety of contemporary as well as ethnic designs to match different kinds of outfits, says Adishri Poddar of AP Jewellers.

 The collection includes elegant necklaces, long cascading earrings, traditional jhumkas, mangtikas, rings, armlets, nose rings, anklets and watches. From single line diamond-studded bangles in interesting shapes to authentic pacheli bangles to meenakari to coloured stones, the bangle section offers you a plethora of options. 

 Then there is the changeable jewellery line where a watch on flipping the dial becomes a bracelet or a neckpiece can be worn with your choice of coloured stone. 

 For the men, you have bracelets, rings, watches, kurta buttons, buckles, coat pins, pens and cufflinks. 

 Also on offer are gift items like small sets, earrings, fancy pendants and lockets that resemble cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse, Snoopy and dolphins.

 Prices start at Rs 2,000 and can go up to a few lakhs.

 Textile touch 

 Srijoni, a house of exclusive hand-crafted Indian textiles at 40/1-A, Bhupen Bose Avenue, launched its winter bridal collection on Monday. 

 True to its tradition, the thrust is mainly on various forms of hand embroidery. Keeping the Indian wedding colours in mind, the palette comprises shades of red, pink, deep blue, yellow and other vibrant hues. 

 Heavy Bangalore silks, Kanjeevarams, Ikkats, Bomkais and tussars have been exquisitely embroidered with zardosi, kantha and aari work, sometimes combined with block prints. For not-so-traditional brides there are crepes and georgettes heavily embellished for an ornate look. 

 Many women these days dont want to drape the traditional Benarasis for their weddings. Lighter fabrics like crepes and georgettes go down well with them. These are easy to carry off and also look very stylish and chic, says Arpita Chatterjee, the lady behind Srijoni.

 The line also boasts an array of Dhakai Jamdanis and muslins from Bangladesh and lighter silks, tussars, chiffons and georgettes adorned with signature block prints. Salwar suits for the trousseau come with elaborate embroidery, often teamed with gold tissue dupattas.

 While the printed saris range from Rs 1,700, the heavier bridal saris are priced between Rs 6,000 and Rs 9,000 and the Dhakais start at Rs 4,000. 

 The occasion was also marked by the announcement of the winners of the Puja lucky draw of the boutique. Doing the draw was city model Shreya Pandey. 

 The gala prize ? a holiday at a resort in Puri was won by Kumkum Nandi, while the second prize, a complimentary dinner for two at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton and Towers, was bagged by Seema Mullick. Manju Pramnik walked away with the third prize, a Kodak camera.

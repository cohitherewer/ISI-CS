 You share your birthday with...

 Susan Sarandon 

You are argumentative, but in a charming and winning way. You strive to be open-minded and progressive. You keep a low profile; you are neither driven, nor overly ambitious. You are able to see beauty around you that others ignore or overlook. Sometimes, it is hard for you to translate your ideas into practical form because you slip into a fantasy world. ? Kusum Bhandari

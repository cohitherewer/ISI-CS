 A portrait of Aishwarya Rai in your bedroom, glass masks printed on your door or a huge dragon on your carpet. If you can visualise it, Aart el Cristal will print it.

 Digital technology allows the studio at Lenin Sarani to make prints on the surface of your choice. Ours is the first studio of its kind in the eastern region where we can print images, pictures and paintings on any surface of your choice, says owner Surendra Kumar Jhaluka.

 Rigid or flexible materials in the form of boards, sheets, canvas, glass, mirror, ceramics, camphor board, leather and metals could all bear the chosen design, with a machine in Mumbai doing the trick.

 Roving eye

 If your child is fiddling with your digital camera, dont dismiss it as a passing phase. To catch the next generation of Sanjay Leela Bhansalis and Raghu Rais as young as possible, Oxford Bookstore on Park Street launched Flash, a film and photography club, on Thursday.

 The club is an endeavour to provide a platform for students who take an active interest in photography and film-making, whose talent often gets restricted to family albums. Every month, Flash will see some action, hoping to keep the flashbulbs alight.

 It is not a club but an idea that the Oxford Bookstore has floated. With the DVD-Handycam revolution, more and more people can make short films. But there is a dearth of platforms to showcase it. This club will have help unearth some real talent in film-making, observed film-maker Goutam Ghose, who inaugurated the club.

 Flash will encourage young talent to come together and cut across all barriers to produce good films and photographs, said Maina Bhagat, events consultant, Oxford Bookstore.

 Fusion fare

 A desire to showcase the rich heritage of Rajasthan and Bengal prompted childhood friends Pikoo Singh from Jodhpur, and Manju Jotwani, an airlines professional, to join hands. 

 Six years ago Pikoo mobilised an entire village in Rajasthan to create ethnic and Indo-western clothes in cotton and tussar embellished with beads and traditional Rajasthani motifs.

 Pikoo sells from a boutique in a heritage hotel in Jaisalmer owned by her in-laws and has now brought her repertoire to Calcutta. Manju pitches in here with design inputs to fuse Bengali and Rajasthani handiwork. 

 Calcuttans can check out their work at an exhibition on the ground floor of Ambassador Building, Park Street. Designed on soft cottons and tussars, the outfits are embellished with block prints, beads and kantha embroidery. 

 The kurtas at the exhibition start at Rs 300, salwar-kameez sets are priced at Rs 600 and above, crushed skirts start at Rs 300, while saris are priced higher ? Rs 3,000 onwards.

 The exhibition is on till Sunday.

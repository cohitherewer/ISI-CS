The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 An hour?s reprieve in summer

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should offices start and end an hour early in summer? More letters will be published next week

Diptimoy ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 Such a move would be appreciated by employees who live in the city. The summer schedule could be in effect from early April to the middle of July. However, its introduction might jeopardise office and domestic routines for a couple of weeks. A change of office timings in winter can also be considered.

Biswajyoti Bagchi, 

 Alipore

 Starting and ending office an hour early in summer will not help employees much. The hottest part of the day is generally between noon and 3 pm. Even if the times are changed, employees will still spend those hours in office. A better idea would be to provide a break to employees who have to work outdoors during mid-day.

Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

 Workers at various offices suffer a great deal during the scorching summer. To reduce their suffering a little bit, it would make a lot of sense to start and end office an hour early.

Srijan Dawn, 

 Sovabazar

 Yes, I support the move because starting office an hour early would help employees conserve their energy. Besides, the move would free an hour at the end of the day. The Japanese follow a similar system.

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury, 

 Dum Dum Park

 What next? Rainy day at office? Efforts should be made to improve working condition in offices by installing cooling machinery. Such a move would not only motivate employees, but boost their productivity. Changing office timings with seasons will only create confusion and make workers lethargic.

Suvadip Goswami,

 Mahestala 

 Humidity is as much a problem in summer as heat. So, starting and ending office an hour early will not significantly improve the working condition. Employees are also inconvenienced in winter and monsoon, but nothing can be done about that. The best solution would be to adjust to the climatic conditions.

P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur Avenue

 Yes, offices might start and end an hour early in summer, even though the heat in West Bengal cannot be categorised as extreme. Some offices in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh advance their timings during summer. I have doubts whether such a move in West Bengal would be welcomed by everyone.

Debasish Chakraborty,

 Nilmoni Mitra Row

 Keeping in mind the interests of the employees, offices should start and end early in summer. 

Abdul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Bandpur

 Many employees live outside the city and have to start from their homes early in the morning to reach office on time. They will find it impossible to reach office earlier. The availability of transport might also be a problem. On top of this, employees will have to leave office in the afternoon with the sun blazing away. In West Asia, several offices start and end early in summer, but most shops, government departments and public utility services stay open almost 24 hours. They only need to change the shift timings.

Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road 

 Offices starting and ending early in summer, will create more problems than it will solve. Most people will find it impossible to reach office in the morning given the dismal state of the transport system. Many of those living outside the city will have to start at 6 am or earlier to reach office on time. The system should be tried out before being implemented.

Sandhya Banerjea,

 Salt Lake

 It?s a great suggestion. People who have to work outdoor in summer often suffer from heat strokes and would welcome such a move. Generally, people get out of bed earlier during summer. Hence, very few employees would face a problem in making it to office around 9 am. The efficiency of workers would also rise if the office time is advanced. 

Seraj Alam,

 Sankho Nagar 

 It is a good idea. The 10 am to 6 pm schedule should be changed to 9 am to 5 pm. It will protect employees and consumers from exhaustion. However, the changed times must be adhered to strictly. 

Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake

 Yes, I strongly feel that in summer, offices should start and end earlier than usual. This way, employees would be able to avoid the scorching sun without hampering work. A schedule shift would also do wonders for the health of employees.

Dalim Kumar Dutta,

 APC Road

 Offices should certainly start early in summer. Those who work at the desk should be in office by 10 am, while those who work outdoors should do their work in the morning and evening. Traffic snarls will also ease if the office schedule is changed. The timings at banks also need to be changed.

Ahasan Jahir Molla,

 Mahestala

 The people who suffer the worst during summer do not work in offices. A vast majority of workers do not have the luxury of staying indoors even at mid-day. The proposal will only add to the comfort of a handful of people and does not deserve much consideration.

Sonal Jain,

 Address not given

 The office timings should not be changed. Otherwise, the employees would start demanding a special schedule for winter as well. Temperature should not be allowed to affect office discipline. 

Yashita Banerjee,

 Rashbehari Avenue

 If offices start early, then employees would be able to reach their workplace before the heat becomes unbearable. In the evening, they would be able to come back home earlier, and hence would get enough time to relax and get ready for the next day.

U. Roy Chowdhury,

 Address not given

 It is a good suggestion, especially since a lot of offices are not equipped with gadgets to combat the summer heat. With the change in weather pattern in the city in the past few years, summers are becoming more and more uncomfortable and steps need to be taken to improve the working conditions of employees. However, marketing people would hardly gain from such a move. 

Dipro Ray,

 Beniapukur Lane

 Getting up early is not much of a problem in summer, so employees won?t find it difficult to make it to office earlier. A change in schedule would help them reach office without losing a lot of energy. Offices should also arrange for some recreational activities so that employees who do not want to start for home at 4 pm can stay back and enjoy themselves for a couple of hours more.

Samyak Nandy,

 Bangur Avenue

 I don?t think there is much reason to change the office timings. An advancement of timings would only expose employees to the afternoon sun during their journey back home. The authorities should not experiment with the standard office schedule.

Moumita Nandi,

 Behala

 Keeping in mind the late hours that most private sector employees keep, it would not be feasible to start and end office an hour early. Morover, it would be difficult to implement the system in the private sector. The move might result in confusion among employees. 

Ajit Kumar Das,

 Naskar Para Road

 Such a system has already been started in other states and needs to tried out here as well.

Kaushik Guha,

 SN Roy Road

 Soaring temperature adversely affects the output of employees, so starting and ending office an hour early in summer is not a bad idea. Clients/customers would also find it more convenient to visit office in the morning than at mid-day. Since several government offices are not yet air-conditioned, government employees stand to gain the most from the move. 

Rajarshi Ghosh, 

 Surya Nagar 

 If office starts an hour early, then this would help people get in early and avoid the tremendous heat outside. Otherwise, people could get sunstroke. 

Sonal Bothra,

 Sagar Dutta Lane

 The heat and humidity in summer not only causes various ailments but saps the energy of workers. An early start to office would increase the productivity of employees manifold.

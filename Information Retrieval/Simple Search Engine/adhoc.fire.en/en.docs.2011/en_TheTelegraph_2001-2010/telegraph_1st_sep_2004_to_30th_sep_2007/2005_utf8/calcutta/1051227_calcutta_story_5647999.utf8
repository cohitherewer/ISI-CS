 Board a capsule on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, dock at a station in space, head straight for the Red Planet for an experience of a lifetime.

 Calcuttans are set to get a first-hand look and feel of Mars when the ?Landing on Mars? exhibit opens at the Energy Education Park on the last day of this year.

 ?Our Journey to the Sun exhibit has become very popular. The ride to Mars, a first in the country, is a continuation of that,? said P.P. Gon Chaudhuri, director of West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA), which set up the park.

 The trip begins with a journey in a 12-seater ?spacecraft? from Earth to the docking station in space. ?This is a special feature in case of this ride, through which children would actually be able to know how docking takes place in space,? explained Gon Chaudhuri.

 Visitors are then asked to step across to another ?spacecraft?, from which they can view the Martian environment. The red earth, rocks, craters, dead volcanoes and dust storms ? all come alive through models and simulation.

 There?s even a model of the Rovers craft, seen in action collecting samples to be sent back to Earth. The complete ride takes about half-an-hour.

 The show took around eight months to prepare, said park officials, and cost nearly Rs 35 lakh.

 Starting December 31, 2005, it will be open to public, with tickets priced at Rs 50. ?Usually, the park is closed on Fridays. But for the next month or two, we will remain open on Fridays too,? said a park official.

 ?We always try to have new exhibits that are exciting to kids. The park has tried to raise awareness regarding renewable energy since inception,? Gon Chaudhuri added.

 Minister for power and non-conventional energy sources, Mrinal Banerjee, inaugurated the ?Landing on Mars? journey on Monday.

 The energy park is generating around 47 MW of non-conventional power, servicing nearly a lakh subscribers in the Sunderbans, West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and Darjeeling, Gon Chaudhuri said.

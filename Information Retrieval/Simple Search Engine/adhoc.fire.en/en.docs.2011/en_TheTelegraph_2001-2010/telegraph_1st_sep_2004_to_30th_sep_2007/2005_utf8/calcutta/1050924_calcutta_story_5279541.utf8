The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Mohinder Amarnath 

You are brave, enthusiastic and a bit boastful. You are a pragmatist; determinedly and persuasively, you wrestle with destiny, soon to emerge the winner, rarely giving in. Meticulous by nature, you detest half-hearted relationships. Never lazy, always eager to get agendas completed on time, you are efficient and cooperative but never aggressive. ? Kusum Bhandari

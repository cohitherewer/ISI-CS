Tuesday was Prem Prakash Singh?s lucky day. On the 

advice of his astrologer, the man better known as bank robber Pappu Singh, chose 

Tuesdays to rob four banks, and got away with it each time.

 But on Monday afternoon, he finally walked into the police net. The 29-year-old mastermind of a string of bank heists was arrested in front of Lake Market around 3 pm, a few hours after he arrived in the city from a hideout in Jharkhand.

 Pappu, who hails from Bihar, has been in Calcutta for the past seven years. His role was discovered in a string of recent bank robberies ? including a Rs 2.81-crore heist in Raipur, Madhya Pradesh.

 ?He was also behind the robbery of a bank in Jasidih, where he walked off with Rs 18 lakh. He always operates with the help of associates in Bihar and Jharkhand,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 City police and their counterparts in Jharkhand believed one gang was behind all four bank robberies. ?All of them had been committed on Tuesdays, which was very suspicious,? said a detective department sleuth.

 Pappu later revealed that an astrologer had told him the planet Mars would have a positive effect on his luck.

 Four months ago, Pappu?s role behind the Rs 85-lakh robbery at Central Bank of India was learnt. 

 ?In broad daylight on December 16, 2003, a 10-member gang, armed with revolvers and knives, raided the bank in the Watgunge police station area. They emptied the vault. An eight-month investigation had earlier drawn a blank,? said an officer on the case.

 Police got their first lead in September 2004. 

 ?Siddhinath Singh and Bhushan Singh were arrested by Jharkhand police on charges of robbing Rs 18 lakh from a bank in Jasidih. Meanwhile, Patna police informed us about the arrests of Sunil Singh and Umesh Singh in connection with the Raipur robbery,? said Pandey.

 The first Calcutta link emerged when sleuths from Lalbazar interrogated Sunil and Umesh in Raipur. 

 A land-line number was found in Sunil?s cell phone, which had been dialled on the day of the Raipur robbery.

 The number led to Pappu?s residence on Kali Temple Road. But he had not been home since the day of the Watgunge robbery. 

 Finally, Pappu returned on Monday morning, and he was nabbed in the afternoon.

 Charged up by a novel platter of chicken choices, Calcutta is asking for more and the rumblings could soon be heeded.

 It?s one outlet too few ? and too small ? for KFC, what with the Colonel Sanders? juicy Original Recipe chicken to the crunchy Hot ?n? Crispy variety, the light Kentucky Burger to the classic whole-filet Zinger Burger, the wraps and strips and the combos flying off the oven.

 Buoyed by the frenzied response to the fare served at its maiden Calcutta outlet in City Centre, the world?s largest chicken restaurant chain, with over 12,300 restaurants, is gearing up to spread its wings in town.

 ?Yes, the acceptance has been phenomenal and we are looking at a large second outlet in south Calcutta in the next six months and at least one more by end-2006,? Sharanita Keswani, director-KFC marketing, Yum! Restaurants International, told Metro on Tuesday.

 Each of these new outlets will seat 100-plus and the chain plans to pick and choose the ?right malls or high-street locations, where there?s a lot of natural foot traffic?. Keswani feels Calcutta can eventually gobble up ?20 to 30? KFC outlets, including Express counters housed in food courts.

 ?Our market survey reveals Calcutta has a nearly 95 per cent non-vegetarian population, as opposed to around 50 per cent in Mumbai or Delhi among the SEC A and B segments,? she said.

 This, coupled with the growing aspiration levels of the youth here and the retail revolution sweeping the sidewalks (?fast food has great synergy with shopping?), makes the city a ready rendezvous, the marketing chief felt.

 Much of this chicken chutzpah stems from the Salt Lake success story, starting June 22. With mean weekday footfall topping 1,500 and weekend business at 2,500-plus and soaring, the City Centre restaurant has been forced to shore up seating capacity from 64 to 75.

 ?What is encouraging is that all our core international brand standard products, like Chicken on the Bone and the line of burgers, have been smashing hits in Calcutta, alongside the more Indianised wraps and rolls and thalis. This clearly shows the city is ready for this format and we are convinced Salt Lake is not a flash in the pan,? Keswani said.

 To acknowledge this ?loyalty and support?, KFC is kicking off a ?festive feast? from September 23 ? a customer mania initiative to culminate in a Global Customer Appreciation Day on October 7, with fun and games, gifts and music. And, of course, a lip-smacking spread of ?great-tasting food, served super-fast in a lively ambience and at everyday affordable prices?.

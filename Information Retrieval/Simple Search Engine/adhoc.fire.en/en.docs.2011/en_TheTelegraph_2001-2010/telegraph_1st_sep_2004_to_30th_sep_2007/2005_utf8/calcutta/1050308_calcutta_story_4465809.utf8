 Mishaps kill one, injure 11

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Blood was spilt on city streets once more in three accidents on Monday. 

 Reckless driving claimed the life of a 50-year-old man on CR Avenue, another bus overturned, injuring 11, and three pedestrians narrowly escaped when a taxi turned turtle at the Lindsay Street-JL Nehru Road crossing.

 The unidentified victim was crushed under the wheels of a private bus on route 237 in front of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. 

 He was crossing the road when the driver lost control of the speeding bus. The man died on the spot. The driver fled but his vehicle has been impounded.

 Close on the heels of Sunday?s Chowringhee mishap, 11 persons were injured when a private bus on route SD16 overturned in Thakurpukur. The bus hit a roadside railing while overtaking another bus. 

 The driver fled. The injured were admitted to Vidyasagar Hospital and a local nursing home, where their condition was stated to be stable.

 Around 6 pm, a taxi overturned at the intersection of JL Nehru Road, near the northern section of the Park Street flyover. The driver lost control after the car developed a snag, police said. 

 The passenger and driver were unhurt, though the vehicle barely missed three pedestrians by a few feet, said an officer of the traffic department. The taxi has been impounded and will be examined.

 Dwitiya Basanta

 Office colleagues Jhinuk (Rituparna Sengupta) and Sudipto (Shilajit) seem to be just good friends. But Sudipto secretly nurtures a soft corner, though Jhinuk remains a doting wife. When her husband (Sabyasachi Chakraborty) dies, Jhinuk takes a transfer to Kalimpong, where Sudipto turns up one day. The woman is at a crossroads ? new love beckons, while the past pulls her back.

 It?s middle-of-the-road fare ? neither too taxing, nor too frivolous. Debutant director Avijit Dasgupta does a tightrope walk between friendship and extra-marital relationship. 

 Rituparna is best in her darker moments; she has quite clearly come a long way from her Nishijapon days. Shilajit stands out both as a carefree friend and a pensive lover. But blink and you are sure to miss Sabyasachi.

 Aveek Mukherjee?s cinematography is a visual treat. Be it the green valley spread out against a blue sky or the winding roads brushing past the mist. The interior shots are pleasing, too. 

 The tension between Rituparna and Shilajit just doesn?t build up during the reunion. And where is the husband-wife chemistry between Rituparna and Sabyasachi? 

 The slow pace is a strain. The script, penned by Dasgupta and his wife Manjulika, is weak in the latter half.

 The shoddy English sub-titles need to be worked on, if Dwitiya Basanta has to travel to any film festival. Example: ?I can?t live without you? scripted as ?I can?t leave without you?).

 Last word: Watchable for its interesting theme and the convincing performances from the main cast.

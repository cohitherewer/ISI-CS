 The St Xavier?s College Calcutta Alumni Association (SXCCAA) in collaboration with The Telegraph and the West Bengal Federation of United Nations Associations, organised its annual inter-college debate on October 26 at the St Xavier?s College auditorium. The debate on ?The UN is dead at sixty? was held to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the United Nations.

 With the role of the world?s foremost socio-political organisation coming under increasing scrutiny, the topic was expected to be hotly debated, and the speakers did not disappoint. Suman Mukherjee moderated the talk and all the debaters for or against the motion spoke passionately on the role and importance of the UN, and whether its principles are still effective in context of the 21st century?s political, sociological and geographical scenario.

 With some of the city?s foremost educational institutions taking part in the debate, it was expected to be a keen affair. A major topic of contention was the principles of the United Nations as laid down in its charter. Chandrabali Ghosal of NUJS speaking for the motion cited Afghanistan and Iraq as examples of America?s hegemony over the UN. She pointed out that the developments showed the UN?s lack of control over nuclear powers. It, therefore, had lost the right and position of being the world?s leading mediation and arbitration body, she said.

 Speaking against the motion, Rudhira Mitra of Loreto College scored a telling point by arguing that the millennium development goals set by the UN were initiatives that had been adopted by all member nations who have decided to reduce the debt burden of the economically-weaker nations. This proved that the UN as a world body had retained its significance.

 With both sides making thought-provoking arguments, a tough decision had to be made to choose the winner. In the end, the motion failed to be carried. Rohini Bhusan of Presidency College, speaking against the motion, was adjudged the best debater, while Amrita Mukherjee representing Lady Brabourne College was adjudged the runner-up.

 Some of the dignitaries present on the occasion were Assembly Speaker H.A. Halim, MLA Sougata Roy and Sitaram Sharma, honorary consul of Belarus.

 Day throughout

 Colours everywhere, 

 vibrant and bright

 Hiding the shadows of the deep dark night.

 Laughter spilling everywhere, high and low

 Tireless eyes burn in 

 an ethereal glow.

 The dark hues of night 

 merge with the roseate 

 hues of dawn.

 Colours disappear

 And colours are born.

 It is a time of the year 

 when it rsquo;s day all through

 And it is the warmth of joy 

 that pervades through

 Our body and mind 

 and drenches our souls

 In its mellifluous shades!

 Calcutta

 In some lonesome cafe,

 Its white walls, long since dark,

 The wooden benches and chairs speak of times better seen.

 Sometimes Pablo Neruda peeks, from a book cover held 

 in some unknowing hands, 

 Reading for pleasure.

 Imitation of life in the noisy 

 hubbub, where intellects meet 

 and collide, 

 And clash and burn,

 Some envious, some admiring,

 Others, simply watching.

 It rsquo;s a strange sight,

 Entertaining nonetheless.

 Some isolated corridor,

 Of a dinghy, harboured and set to sail into the horizons,

 Over the sacred feminine.

 The mother of the land.

 There bloomed a brighter flower,

 Of a colour unperceivable,

 But belonging to some 

 ruler unknown.

 Sometimes beneath a 

 certain highway,

 One can hear cries of anguish,

 Oh! It rsquo;s just another person.

 What care we?

 When the sights are as

 Marvellous as it ought to be.

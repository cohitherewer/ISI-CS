 Virgo, an ethnic-wear boutique in Bhowanipore, celebrated its second birthday on Wednesday by offering a weeklong 10 per cent discount. 

 Saris in georgette and crepe are suitable picks for party or regular wear. The salwar suits, too, come in semi-formal and formal styles, with jamewar, gota, mukaish, aari and batik embellishments and prints come to life in splashes of red, blue, orange and more. 

 My in-house creation is called Rave, though I do carry the work of other designers, too. My collection, a medley of floral as well as geometric motifs, has been designed keeping in mind the current trends, monsoon and the upcoming Rakhi, explains owner Ritu Sonthalia. 

 Salwar lengths, kurtis, tops and skirts are also available. You can team your outfits with bags and trendy batuas peppered with aari, mirror work or sequins. Also on offer are rakhis, cell phone holders, bangles and shoes. 

 Bio basics

 Biotique, the cosmetics brand, launched a range of ayurvedic tablets at a seminar-workshop on Tuesday.

 Bio Skin Feed and Bio Age promise glowing skin and rejuvenation, while Bio Cellulite provides control for fat. Also on offer are tablets to combat the effects of pollution, stress and depression.

 The company hosted a seminar on skin, body and hair care at Flavours of India on AJC Bose Road to coincide with the city launch of the oral tablets. In attendance were beauticians finding out about a range of mens, ladies and babies products.

 We have launched food supplements for glowing skin, cellulite control and rejuvenation. Anti-depression supplements and Chawanprash are also available, explains a spokesperson for Biotique. 

 The workshop conducted by Nutan Rastogi showcased facials like the Thermoherb treatment that keeps away wrinkles and combats pigmentation. Pimple problems are also catered to, while a coconut milk cream lightens blemishes. 

 The mens range of products includes coconut shaving cream, face and body wash, after-shave and moisturiser. An exclusive range for babies has also been launched.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Global appeal, local flavour

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Has Poila Baisakh lost out to New Year?s Day among Bengalis? More letters will be published next week

Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

Barrackpore 

New Year is celebrated worldwide while Poila Baisakh 

is celebrated only among the Bengalis. It is impractical to expect that it will 

have the same kind of impact as New Year. Having said that, the Bengali new year?s 

day is still very special for the older generation. It, however, holds little 

significance for the youngsters. 

Samir Chandra Saha, 

 Baguiati

Poila Baisakh is certainly not losing its significance. 

Many Bengalis buy dresses and jewellery for the day and greet each other with 

shubha nava varsha. Businessmen all over the city perform halkhata puja 

to seek blessings from the deity. We do not enjoy as much on New Year?s Day.

Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge

More and more people are becoming westernised these 

days. Western festivals like Christmas, New Year and Easter are now celebrated 

with more pomp than the Indian ones. Poila Baisakh retains its charm only among 

hardcore Bengalis. For those with a cosmopolitan outlook, it is just another day.

Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur

New Year?s Day is celebrated all over the world, but 

several communities hold their ethnic calendars in high regard. Thus, Navroz remains 

special for the Parsis, even if they are away from their homeland. Unfortunately, 

except among shopkeepers, Poila Baisakh has lost its significance. Which is not 

surprising given that ?cosmopolitan? Bengalis are of the view that assertion of 

their regional identity is a sin.

Arpita Chowdhury,

 Dum Dum 

It is ironic that Bengalis in Calcutta do not celebrate 

their new year the way the people of Chinese descent do in Chinatown. The razzmatazz 

of the New Year has lured the Bengalis. 

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 

 Entally

Despite the New Year glitter, Bengalis look forward 

to Poila Baisakh with a lot of hope and happiness. The day has definitely not 

lost out to New Year?s Day. Every Bengali family has its own special way of celebrating 

Poila Baisakh. It is evident from the way the day is celebrated that it has a 

special place in Bengali hearts. 

Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore

Poila Baisakh will never lose its importance among 

the Bengalis. While the young and the well-heeled do go to parties on the New 

Year Eve, the day itself is pretty uneventful for most. In contrast, long queues 

can be seen outside temples on Poila Baisakh. Bengalis also go out to eat and 

visit relatives during the day. Even football clubs wait for this auspicious day 

to erect goalposts.

Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

Although Poila Baisakh is an auspicious day and holds 

much significance in the social, cultural and economic life of every Bengali, 

it is losing out to New Year?s Day. Numerous well-to-do and educated Bengalis 

seem more interested in observing New Year?s Day and Christmas with great fanfare. 

Satyen Biswas,

 Behala 

Needless to say Poila Baisakh has not lost its charm 

among Bengalis. Even now, most Bengalis wear new clothes, go out for lunch or 

dinner and spend time with family and friends on the day. Poila Baisakh will remain 

as colourful as ever.

P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur Avenue

True, the Bengali new year?s day has lost its importance 

in the Bengali calendar. Very few of us are aware of the current Bengali year, 

not to speak of the Bengali month. Only the business community observes the halkhata 

ceremony on the day.

Debashis Pathak, 

 Beleghata

New Year?s Day is celebrated extravagantly, whereas 

Poila Baisakh is more like a house party. Not as many people join the celebrations 

on the Bengali new year?s day, but the events are more traditional and the day 

itself retains a special place in the heart.

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,

 Dum Dum Park

Yes, to a certain extent, one of the main reasons 

for it being the Western influence on our lifestyles. For the younger generation, 

Poila Baisakh is symbolic only because of the Chaitra sale. In the process of 

adopting the Western culture, Bengalis are losing touch with their roots. But 

there still are a few who greet friends with a shubha nava varsha on Poila 

Baisakh.

Suvadip Goswami,

 Mahestala

Whenever we think of Bengali culture, first and foremost 

it is Poila Baisakh that comes to our mind. Visits to the temple, delicious homemade 

food, new clothes, family get-togethers and going out on a date? Poila Baisakh 

is way ahead of New Year?s Day in terms of revelry. 

Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

Ask Bengalis the date on the Bengali calendar and 

90 per cent would mutter ?I don?t know?, ?Can?t remember?, and give other vague 

replies. Everyone is more accustomed to the Gregorian calendar. During my childhood, 

we used to seek blessings from elders on Poila Baisakh and shopkeepers would offer 

sweets.

Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake

Earlier, Poila Baisakh used to be a big event in the 

literary circuit. Almost all Bengali newspapers would bring out extra pages or 

supplements featuring some excellent literary pieces by the Bengali intelligentsia. 

Most publishers in College Street would release their latest books on that day 

and the bookstores would host interactive events between authors and readers. 

Poila Baisakh was a festival then. But today, we don?t even bother to call or 

send a message to our loved ones wishing them shubha nava varsha, whereas 

on New Year?s Day the phonelines are all jammed. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

 Lake Town

Like in any cosmopolitan city, New Year is celebrated 

with a lot of fanfare in Calcutta. But that does not take anything away from the 

Poila Baisakh celebrations. The Bengali new year remains special among members 

of the community. It is one of the most awaited days of the year, especially in 

areas of the state outside Calcutta. There is no question of Poila Baisakh losing 

its popularity.

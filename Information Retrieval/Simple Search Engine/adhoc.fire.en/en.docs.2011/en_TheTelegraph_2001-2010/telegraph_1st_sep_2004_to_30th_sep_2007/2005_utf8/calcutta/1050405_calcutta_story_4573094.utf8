The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Outsider count in city eludes police

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohammad Rafiq?s choice of Calcutta as a base to run his murder racket had been anything but random.

 The 31-year-old contract killer, arrested recently following a raid on his Entally hideout by a police team from Kanpur, knew for sure that the city was one of the safest metros for undercover operations.

 The perception is shared not just by the likes of Rafiq, but also by those whose duty is to keep them on a tight leash ? the police.

 ?There is simply no way to keep a tab on the influx in densely-populated pockets of the city, such as Beniapukur, Entally, Narkeldanga, Ekbalpore and Tangra. The database on the outsiders lodged in these areas is far from complete. The police have no clue about who is arriving from which part of the world,? said a senior officer of the resident protection (RP) wing of the special branch.

 The wing is supposed to keep a vigil on those coming in from Pakistan and Bangladesh and provide necessary inputs to the criminal intelligence wing. Insiders, however, admit there is hardly any exchange between the two cells. 

 This, despite the confession of Asif Reza Khan, an Aftab Ansari henchman who was later killed in an encounter with Gujarat police, that most of those involved in the American Center attack had put up in his Mofidul Islam Lane house, in Beniapukur.

 Keen to plug the lapses, former police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty had issued a diktat asking all police stations to prepare an ?active tenant profile?. 

 Officers-in-charge of all police stations were asked to distribute forms among house-owners who let out premises and collect details about the tenants. A year-and-a-half after the gazette notification, there is hardly any tenant profile with police.

 ?People should know who is coming to their locality and inform us if they notice anything suspicious. You can?t expect police to go about verifying all newcomers in each neighbourhood,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division).

 ?In Rafiq?s case, not many in Chhatu Babu Lane were aware of his presence. And a handful of those who were, did not know that he was from Kanpur,? he added. 

 To address the problem of intelligence-gathering and to bring about efficient coordination among policemen, every officer-in-charge (OC) had been made ex-officio divisional officer of the special branch. Years later, few OCs are aware of the role.

 ?There are some densely populated areas ? including Chhatu Babu Lane, Motijheel and Bibibagan ? where you just cannot keep count of the outsiders unless residents inform us. And not many want to inform us about their tenants, trying to avoid legal complications,? explained Baidyanath Saha, OC of Entally police station. 

 ?Several fly-by-night operators are setting up offices, mopping up money and disappearing. On most occasions, we don?t even have an address to track them down,? said an officer of Lake police station.

 The department has, however, not given up hope. ?We are trying to motivate people to keep regular contact with us. The officers have been briefed, but the liaison will take some time to happen,? said Barun Kumar Mullick, deputy commissioner (north).

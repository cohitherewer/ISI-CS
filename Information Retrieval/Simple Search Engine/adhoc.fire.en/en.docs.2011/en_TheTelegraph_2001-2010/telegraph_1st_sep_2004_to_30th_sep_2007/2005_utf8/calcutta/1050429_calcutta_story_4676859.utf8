The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A few good men on screen and stage

 Antonio Banderas floored his viewers with the knockout musical Nine year before last, while Denzel Washington is currently riding high on Julius Caesar. For the Hollywood heroes of substance, theatre means more than a passing love affair. Metro takes stock of the star attractions in theatre this season

 Kevin Spacey

 While his compatriots straddle the Broadway boards, the American Beauty star has leaned towards West End. Having taken over as the artistic director of one of London?s oldest theatre companies, Old Vic, in 2003, Spacey?s debut directorial project was Cloaca, which opened to mixed response last autumn. The next two Old Vic productions, Aladdin and The Philadelphia Story, didn?t wow the London crowds either, but Spacey is far from calling it quits. 

 He is now gearing up to launch his first Shakespeare act in the UK ? Richard II, where he plays the lead. The Oscar-winner?s first theatre stint was playing the messenger in Henry VI on the New York stage in 1981. 

 Billy Crystal

 It is quite by chance that this actor with a fine sense of comedy (from When Harry Met Sally to America?s Sweethearts) got to script one of the Broadway box-office successes of the year ? 700 Sundays. First performed as a benefit show for only two evenings, Crystal soon adapted it to a larger version for Broadway. 

 Referring to the 700 memorable Sundays Crystal had spent with his father, who died when he was barely 15, 700 Sundays is an autobiographical show about all the characters who have influenced his life. 

 Dwelling upon his growing-up years in a world of jazz to adulthood, marriage and family matters, Crystal has sc ripted his own two-act play. 700 Sundays has set the cash registers ringing ever since it opened in December 2004.

 Ethan Hawke

 He has been very busy ever since his nomination for an Oscar in a supporting role for Training Day, but Hawke took time off from his film schedule to feature in an off-Broadway revival of Hurlyburly (the original was in 1984).

 Set in the Hollywood of 1980s, the production is a comic take on a decadent society. Hawke plays a casting agent who, along with three of his friends, gets involved with several Hollywood women. 

 The 34-year-old Before Sunset star says theatre is his first love and a great learning process. Hawke, who ran a theatre company some years ago, tries to do at least one play a year.

Val Kilmer

 A drama graduate from the famed Juilliard School of Acting, Val Kilmer kicked off his Broadway career with Slab Boys in 1983, alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. 

 The star of Batman Forever and Alexander has balanced a flourishing stage career alongside his film projects with a string of plays (including Shakespeare?s Henry IV Part I, Hamlet and As You Like It).

 From May 24, Kilmer stars in a West End production of James M. Cain?s The Postman Always Rings Twice. He plays Frank, whose affair with a married woman leads to murder, intrigue and courtroom battles.

 Known for his trademark twirling of small objects between his fingers, Kilmer appeared on stage last year in Los Angeles in the musical version of The Ten Commandments. 

 David Schwimmer

 Ever since the curtains came down on his popular sitcom this February, the Friends star has busied himself with the West End stage. But neurotic paleontologist Ross Geller from Friends is no stranger to the high-wire live act. After graduating from Northwestern University in 1988, Schwimmer co-founded Chicago?s Looking Glass Theatre Company and steered a successful career on stage.

 At the prime of his Friends popularity, Schwimmer starred in Roger Kumble?s Turnaround in Los Angeles. This May, he launches his West End career with Some Girl(s). Schwimmer plays a modern single man who flirts with his four girlfriends before deciding whom to tie the knot with.

 Hugh Jackman

 The mutant superhero Wolverine from X-Men is a must mention in this series as he wrested the Tony Award for the best lead role with his first Broadway venture last year. 

 Jackman mesmerised audiences as the singer, songwriter and dancer Peter Allen in the high-spirited musical The Boy from Oz.

 Discovered by Judy Garland, Allen began his career as a performer in a small town in Australia. The musical tells the story of his life and death after a long battle with AIDS. 

 Jackman says Peter is the most demanding part he has ever played. But the Australian actor has been in the theatre circuit since 1983, making a name for himself with the West End production Oklahoma.

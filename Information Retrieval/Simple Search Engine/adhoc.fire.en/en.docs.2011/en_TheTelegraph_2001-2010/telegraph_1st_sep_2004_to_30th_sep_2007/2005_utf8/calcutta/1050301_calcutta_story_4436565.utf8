 Rajnis uncle faces kinship test

 OUR BUREAU

 The defence team in the Rajnis Patel death case interrogated Girish Patel, his uncle, for the third day on Monday in the Alipore court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh.

 Rajnis died at 17 at SSKM Hospital from complications arising out of a broken shinbone. His parents, Manoj and Munni Patel, charged five doctors with negligence following the death in 2003. 

 Dipit Basu, representing accused orthopaedic surgeon Dilip Kumar Majumdar, initiated the day?s proceedings by asking Girish a number of questions to check the veracity of his statements. 

 Basu tried to prove that Girish was only superficially associated with the Patels.

 Girish said he is a farmer and earned barely enough to sustain himself. ?I did not know in which division Rajnis played cricket or any of his friends,? he added.

 He, however, asserted that he knew Dilip Kumar Majumdar and had been introduced to the doctor by Rajnis?s father.

 ?After the second operation, when did you leave Calcutta?? Basu asked.

 ?On March 6, three days after the second operation,? answered Girish.

 ?I used to inquire about Rajnis?s condition from Manoj over the phone. I generally called him at a relative?s place. This relative is associated with the telecom industry,? he added.

 ?Is this relative among the prosecution?s witnesses?? Basu asked, prompting public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh to object.

 ?How can the witness possibly know whose names figure in the prosecution?s list of witnesses?? Ghosh exclaimed. 

 The court sustained the objection.

 In response to a question, Girish admitted that the doctors treating Rajnis used to prescribe medication for him whenever it was necessary.

 ?After Rajnis?s death, did you go to the police or did the police come to you?? Basu asked.

 ?They came to us. I was the first to be interrogated. Manoj and Munni were questioned later,? Girish answered.

 Asish Kumar Khan, representing accused Souvik Bardhan, continued the cross-examination.

 ?I can identify the accused doctors, but I don?t know other doctors of SSKM Hospital. I don?t know where the X-ray films were kept or how Manoj obtained them. I had removed Rajnis?s body from the hospital premises in a Tata 407 van, along with Manoj and others. Munni had not accompanied us. I didn?t know that a mob had gone on the rampage in the hospital,? Girish said in response to a question.

 Tie-up with US for trade mediation

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With more and more business establishments preferring arbitration over legal recourse to settle commercial disputes, the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is tying up with the Council of State Governments in the US and the University of Kentucky to offer mediation and reconciliation services. 

 As a precursor to the formal tie-up, a 12-man team from the city-based chamber will visit the US next month and touch base with experts on mediation, reconciliation and arbitration in institutes like Harvard Law School in Boston, American Arbitration Association in New York, Northern Virginia Mediation Services. 

 ?People are looking for faster and cheaper ways to settle commercial disputes and that?s why companies are embracing alternative dispute resolution methods. Now, we are trying to tie up with an international body to handle cross-border disputes from Calcutta,? said Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, ICC. 

 Every year, the Council of Arbitration gets around 25 to 30 such cases, wherein parties try to settle the conflict without seeking legal recourse. 

 Companies from both knowledge industries ? like information technology and bio-technology ? and traditional sectors ? like construction ? are turning to the chamber for speedier solution to their problems. The order is binding on the parties but it can be challenged in the court under extreme situations. 

 ?The new trend of turning to institutional arbitration is a welcome change, as it will reduce the burden on the legal system. But the there is, indeed, a dearth of expertise on arbitration and other such reconciliatory measures in our country and that?s why we have tied up the US government?s agency,? added Arif. 

 The team, including representatives from industry, legal community, academia and the chamber, will undergo training sessions in the US and will act as resource persons on their return to India. 

 ?This is not a one-off kind of a tie-up and we want to continue the association and offer services to the companies,? said Arif. The chamber is also planning to organise sessions with the National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) to tackle the situation of resource crunch.

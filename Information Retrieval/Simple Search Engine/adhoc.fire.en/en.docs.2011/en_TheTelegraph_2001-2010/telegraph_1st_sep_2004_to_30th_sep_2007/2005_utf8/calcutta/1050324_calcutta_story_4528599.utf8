 Holi come early: Encroachers celebrate after 

the eviction is called off

Apropos the report ?Mayor sees lack of political will?, 

March 4, the way Trinamul Congress stalled the eviction drive by the railway tracks 

is shameful. 

 Using such delicate and sensitive issues to gain political mileage is unfair. But Trinamul seems to be bent on reviving its corroding popularity by any means, and will not let right and wrong come in the way. 

 The illegal encroachers must have been emboldened by the way the party came in the way of the administrative machinery. They can?t be blamed for thinking that they will always have the Opposition party to protect them, even if they are in the wrong. 

 Growth of shanties perilously close to railway tracks, regularly used by goods trains carrying highly inflammable material, might result in tragedy any time. As has been reported, the shanties were witness to two major accidents during the last decade. But, obviously, such considerations do not matter for Trinamul. 

 The state administration, on the other hand, made all the arrangements to evict the illegal settlers, but on facing resistance, took the soft option of blaming the railway authorities for not offering attractive rehabilitation packages, as was done in Mumbai. 

 The decree of the high court was not followed in this case and there is no explanation except lack of political will. The reason is not far to seek: our leaders cannot see beyond votes. There is no reason not to initiate contempt action against the state administration and Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 

 The development of the state cannot be compromised. Since relocating of tracks is absurd, the chief minister should deal with the issue firmly. The judiciary should remind the administration of its duties one more time.

Apropos the report ?Husband in burning bid?, March 1, the incident should not be considered a stray one. Unfortunately, such incidents do not receive as much media attention as cases involving women. While it is the women who are generally tortured, the male victims should not be neglected. It is high time the law and the NGOs extend a helping hand to male victims of torture. 

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

Shibpur. 

Women are not the only victims of mistreatment. In 

fact, quite often, they take advantage of their gender and legal weapons like 

Section 498 to harass men. The media houses should start focussing on men?s rights. 

The law should be blamed for its bias. 

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

Salt Lake.

The media coverage of a new-born eaten by dogs after it was dumped near Baguiati was responsible for the rescue of the seven-day-old girl from Mayo Road (This time, a baby saved, March 1). The coverage reminded the residents of the city of their humanitarian duty. However, the man who drew the attention of passersby must be commended. 

Madhabi D. Ghosh, 

Salt Lake. 

Apropos the report ?Teen toll up in TV tug-of-war?, February 25, it is shocking that a teenager committed suicide because her parents had rebuked her. Both children and their parents are to be blamed for such incidents. The parents expect too much from their children, who are prone to over-reaction. 

Rimli Datta,

Salt Lake. 

 The trend of teenage suicide needs to be 

arrested immediately. Parents must be more friendly with their children and try 

to understand their problems. There is nothing wrong if children watch TV programmes 

during leisure time. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

The report ?Facility collapse at state hospitals?, March 2, draws attention yet again to the deplorable condition of state-run hospitals. There is no denying the fact that the red tape is responsible for this acute infrastructural crisis. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

It is most disheartening that several expensive medical 

equipment have broken down in state hospitals. Only those who have no alternative 

admit themselves in state hospitals now. 

Bhupendra Nath Bose, 

Dum Dum Park.

The report ?School tips on stream options?, February 26, was interesting. Every year, careers of several students are nipped in the bud because of wrong choice of stream. Failing to motivate themselves to study subjects they do not like under pressure from parents, the students become prey to depression. This leads to drug abuse, and even suicide. It is praiseworthy that schools are stepping forward to offer a remedy. 

Debyani Basu,

Birati. 

Apropos the report ?Cancer care is big bucks?, February 28, Cancer Centre Welfare Home and Research Institute at Thakurpukur and Barasat Cancer Research Centre are providing yeomen service to the humanity against the dreaded disease and therefore deserved mention as well. 

Swapan Bose,

Mahesh Dutta Lane. 

 Apropos the report ?Toast to the toppers?, February 26, Gone with the Wind won 10 Oscars, not eight. The tally included one for technical achievement and an honorary award. 

S.K. Rungta, 

Moore Avenue. 

The travel article on Gorumara, February 27, had some factual errors. River Raidak does not flow through the National Forest, as mentioned in the article. Raidak meanders through the Buxa Tiger Reserve, about 100 km from Gorumara. Also, the panorama that can be observed from the Jatraprasad watchtower does not include the view of any lake. The view could be of the Murti river, passing through the Park. 

Heerak Nandy, 

Golf Club Road. 

In the report ?A story to tell, on the wings of a song?, March 19, the song-writer featured was Leena Das, a senior librarian at National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organisation. 

The report of a new-born eaten by street dogs while people stood and watched makes one sick in the stomach (?Cry for Calcutta?, February 25). The mother of the baby, who must have abandoned it on the road, deserves as much condemnation as the people who watched it being eaten. What prevented them from chasing away a few street dogs is beyond comprehension. Leave alone criminals, have Calcuttans lost the strength to fight a few rowdy dogs? If four-legged creatures become so scary for the people, who will dare to stand up against the corrupt leaders? The incident is shameful for the entire state. 

Kunal Saha,

Columbus, Ohio. 

It is difficult to find any rationale behind the criticism of certain aspects of the film Black by Sanjay Leela Bhansali in ?Several shades of grey in the colour black? (March 1). The cast has performed wonderfully with Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee and little Ayesha Kapoor leading way. Dhritiman Chatterjee has been singled out for harsh comments, though he, too, has done a good job in the movie. Also, the background score of the film is out of the world. I do not remember hearing a more brilliant score in Indian films, including Satyajit Ray?s masterpieces. Bhansali has done a superb job in holding the attention of the audience throughout the film, which deals with a difficult and complicated subject. The beginning and the end of the film are memorable. 

Kalyan Ghosh,

Park Street. 

Apropos the report ?Health risks for late pregnancy?, February 28, the entry of women into professional life is largely responsible for late marriages. Given the tremendous competition in almost all professions, young people cannot be blamed for delaying marriage for the sake of their careers. 

Hara Lal Chakraborty,

Arabinda Nagar. 

Apropos the report ?Club shuts out dhoti, kurta? (March 4), it is perplexing to learn that the Tipu Sultan dining room of Tollygunge Club debars members in dhoti/kurta or kurta/pyjama. This dress code restriction is unjustified as every citizen of India has got the rights to wear kind of dress which is in vogue in their respective society. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

Majdia, Nadia. 

Apropos the report ?Red tape binds baby fate?, March 2, it is a matter of regret that handing over of an abandoned child to people willing to adopt it is a long drawn and time-consuming process. Abandoned babies need more love, care and attention than normal babies. The legal formalities should be expedited to protect the baby?s mental health. The government should contemplate streamlining the system. 

Rabindra Nath Kar, 

Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

The police doctors who confronted two ladies and berated them over a minor incident deserve to be punished (Bashed for war of words with cops, March 3). The cops who beat an unarmed person for protesting their activities and manhandled his wife also deserve punishment. Given the nature of the incident, the police chief?s assurance of justice would comfort few. 

Biswajyoti Bagchi,

Address not given. 

lIt is a shame how cops assaulted an innocent citizen. 

The police chief should make them apologise in public. 

Krishna Banerjee,

Jodhpur Park.

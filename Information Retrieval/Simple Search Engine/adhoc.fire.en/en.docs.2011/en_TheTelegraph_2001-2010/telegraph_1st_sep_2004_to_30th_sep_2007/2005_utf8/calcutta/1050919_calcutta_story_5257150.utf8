 Karan Sharma and Annabelle Wallis in moments from Dil Jo Bhi Kahey

 KARAN SHARMA

 Flashback: I was doing my graduation in International Business amp; Management Studies in London. I came to Mauritius to my parents and soon found myself doing a French TV series Cest La Vie (This Is Life) that was being made by dad (Romesh Sharma). I did that before we thought of adapting it to a Hindi film, which became Dil Jo Bhi Kahey.

 Action replay: I found the TV series and the movie quite different from each other although I play the lead in both. Not only was there a two-year gap, but the scenes and structures were different, too. Dil Jo Bhi Kahey was a lot easier since I had got acting coaching in the middle from Pandit Satyadev Dubey, Roshan Taneja and Kishore Namit Kapoor.

 Star sojourn: I have always looked at Amit uncle (Amitabh Bachchan) as dad?s friend. We?ve met at Holi functions, gone on holidays together. I have also seen how people feel just to share the frame with the man. I must have done something really nice to have got the chance to work with him. As for Revathyji, she helped a lot. I found her very humble and down-to-earth. Once we were like, ?Humein aaj ganna khana hai?? And in no time, there she was pulling out sugarcanes from the ganne ki khet.

 Twin trouble: If you ask me who I like more, Annabelle or Bhumika, I won?t be able to answer. It?s like asking do you like your mom or your dad more? But yes, I have had very different kind of chats with the two ladies. With Annabelle, I would discuss the state of theatre in England. With Bhumika, I had a very different kind of rapport.

 Director dad: I think the best thing about having dad as the director of my first film is the comfort level on the sets. A newcomer is so irritating for other people when he or she is struggling in a particular scene. But with dad around I could always go up to him and ask him to show me the right away. He was always dad. I would just ask: ?Dad what do I do??

 ANNABELLE WALLIS

 Flashback: I was born in the UK, but brought up in Portugal. There I did some short films before moving to London to pursue a career in movies. In London, I did some advertisements, went to drama school and got hold of an acting coach. I also did a British film called Jerhito, which will release in November. When the Dil Jo Bhi Kahey team came to London to audition for an actress I applied through my agent. And after two auditions, I was okayed for the role. So, here I am in Bollywood.

 The experience: I never had a language problem since all my dialogues in the film are in English. I became very much a part of the group and although the initial nerves were there, things settled down gradually. While I was very much aware of the Bollywood scenario, I hadn?t really seen any of the films.

 Star sojourn: When I learnt that I will be acting alongside Amitabh Bachchan in the film, I went to the local video shop in London and got hold of his movies and also Aishwarya?s. I have great admiration for both Amitabh and Revathy for being able to work for so long in an industry as tough as Bollywood. It?s a great honour that I got to work with them.

Co-star Karan: I am lucky that Karan and me got along so well. It?s very tough to work beside your father. He?s done very well to surface from that and I hope he goes on to become big in Bollywood.

 British desi: I have got addicted to Indian food ? chicken tikka, pickles and chai. I love chai. As for the language, I have picked up bits and pieces ? bhook laga, paani, khana, shukriya and the absolute must, main tumse pyaar karti hoon. While I don?t say that in the film, I did do so on the sets.

 Fast forward: I have been in talks for big studio projects in America.... I?m, of course, always open to any work from anywhere. Bollywood has great things to offer and I wouldn?t mind doing another film, if I do get it.

 Civic laxity prompts club suit

 Forty clubs have decided to move the high court against ?negligence and lack of transparency? on the part of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in implementing the waterbody beautification project, funded by the Asian Development Bank.

 ?Gross laxity and absence of transparency in the development of waterbodies, under the Rs 1,500-crore-plus Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project, are not only hampering work, but also hiking the expenditure abnormally. We have decided to protest against the civic body?s attitude,? asserted Bhaskar Sinha, general-secretary of the Sports Development Council (SDC), a joint forum of the 40 sports clubs and organisations.

 Some of the clubs and organisations are located on the premises of College Square, Tallah Park, Victoria Square and Deshbandhu Park.

 According to Sinha, it was initially decided that about Rs 4.46 crore would be utilised to beautify the waterbodies under the CMC jurisdiction. 

 The plan included upgrade of the existing swimming pools and construction of fences and pavements around them. ?Work for the Phase I of the project started in December 1, 2003. The deadline was June 22, 2004. The work is yet to be completed.? 

 The quality of the completed work has also been poor, Sinha alleged. 

 ?College Square is one of the waterbodies where vast amounts of money have been wasted. Accidents are quite common there. So, we wanted a high fence to be erected around the tank to prevent unauthorised people from entering the water. A low and weak fence is what we got. The fence, which we discarded, is now gathering rust,? he explained.

 Allegations of financial anomaly have also been levelled against the civic body?s project and management unit. 

 The SDC general-secretary said: ?In almost all the waterbodies where the first phase of the project has been completed, the expenditure has been hiked without floating fresh tenders, which is the norm. For example, in case of Tallah Park, Rs 26 lakh was allotted. The project cost was revised to Rs 49 lakh, but no tender was floated. In the case of College Square, the project cost was jacked up to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 24 lakh.?

 Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, mayoral council member (parks and gardens) expressed vexation over the issue. 

 ?I really don?t understand how the project costs were increased by so much without floating fresh tenders. I have been asking the project and management unit to send me the relevant files, but they are not cooperating,? said Khan.

 Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee was unperturbed by the allegations. 

 ?Let them move the court against us,? he said.

 STYLE ICON: Naomi Campbell struts the ramp

 You?ve seen her sashaying down the world?s best ramps. You?ve ogled her on Fashion TV. You?ve gaped at her gyrating to Michael Jackson?s In the closet. And now, you?ll get a glimpse of Naomi Campbell in Calcutta.

 The international supermodel is almost sure to be in town to flag off the latest reality show on the small screen, Lakme Fashion House, to be beamed on STAR One from February 19. 

 ?She should be coming to Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi in the first week of February,? confirmed a STAR spokesperson.

 The show will feature 16 young and talented fashion designers selected from across the country through auditions by designers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla. The Calcutta auditions take place at Swabhumi on January 24 and 25. Naomi, along with celebrated Italian designer Donatella Versace and desi stars, will handpick the winner, who will bag a six-month internship at Versace?s Milan headquarters, and a chance to showcase his or her designs at this year?s India Fashion Week.

 Neha, an ex-student of NIFT who has sent her entry for Lakme Fashion House, said: ?Earlier, international fashion icons would visit Delhi and Mumbai and give Calcutta the miss. Naomi?s visit would mean that Calcutta is on the right fashion track.?

 Sabyasachi Mukherjee mixed caution with candour: ?If she does actually come down, it will prove that Calcutta is no longer the armpit of fashion, but a serious fashion hub.?

 Around 15 students from NIFT, mostly from the batch that has just passed out, have sent in their entries. 

 Swarup Dutta, course coordinator, Fashion and Textile department of NIFT, while observing that there had been no ?official intimation? about the supermodel?s visit, predicted ?a scramble among students? to catch a glimpse of her.

 ?I believe any aspiring Indian designer will give his or her right arm for this prize,? says Anuradha Narasimhan, marketing manager, Lakme. ?We are not looking at established names at all, but trying to scout raw talent.?

 Based on the European reality show Fashion House, the Indian avatar is also slated to have scandalous little parties through its run on television. Tantra at The Park will be the venue for the Calcutta big bash.

 Apart from Naomi, a whole lot of Bollywood stars, cricketers and other celebrities will be involved in the final judging process. ?We are in talks with biggies like Amitabh Bachchan, who should be part of the final jury along with Naomi and Versace,? revealed designer judge Sandeep Khosla, also one of the creative directors for Lakme Fashion House, along with Abu Jani.

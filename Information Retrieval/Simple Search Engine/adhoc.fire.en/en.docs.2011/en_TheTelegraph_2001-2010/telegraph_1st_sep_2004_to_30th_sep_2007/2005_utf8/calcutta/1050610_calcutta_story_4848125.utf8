The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hawker eviction ordered

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Thursday passed an interim order that is likely to have a long-term impact on the issue of hawker eviction from city footpaths.

 In his order, Justice Jayanta Biswas asked municipal commissioner Debashis Som to remove hawkers from a footpath near Pam Plaza, a new mall opposite Gariahat market, if it is found that they had settled there illegally.

 ?Conduct a probe to find out more about the hawkers. If it is found that they have encroached upon the area illegally, evict them within a month, with assistance from local police,? Justice Biswas ordered.

 The court, however, decreed that the petitioners would have to bear the cost of the eviction drive.

 The order followed writ petitions by owners of shops in the mall. They alleged that Gariahat police station was not taking action against the hawkers, who were creating obstructions at the mall entrance.

 Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Saptangshu Basu argued that according to the Calcutta Municipal Act, it was the duty of the civic authorities to ensure that visitors did not face any problem in entering the mall.

 ?My clients had approached the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for removal of illegal encroachers from the footpath. The civic body had subsequently asked for assistance from Gariahat police station, but the officer-in-charge there said that he did not have enough men to evict the hawkers,? the lawyer told the court.

 Basu called for an order directing police to take steps to remove the illegal encroachers from the footpath.

 Suman Ghosh, appearing for the state, argued that police could not take action against the hawkers without finding out their status.

 The lawyer representing the civic authorities said he had no instruction from his client on the eviction. He prayed for more time.

 Spirit of spring

 What better way for city denizens to enjoy the pleasures of spring than by celebrating its verdant, fragrant beauty through art? Basantotsav, the ongoing exhibition by students and teachers of the visual arts department of Rabindra Bharati University, has on show a collection of paintings and sculptures that captures the very breath and spirit of the season. Hosted by Gallery Kanishkas, in association with Rabindra Bharati University, the exhibition brings together works in a wide range of mediums including watercolour, oil, acrylic, terracotta and papier-m?ch? works, glass and graphic paintings. Also on display are tastefully designed art objects like masks, figurines, wall-hangings and hand-painted calendars that can add colour and character to home interiors. The panoramic rural scenes, bright landscapes and vivid images of wildlife provide sheer visual delight to the art lover. Reflecting the mood of mirth and merriment associated with Holi, the festival of colours, the works on show are in a riot of rich and radiant hues and express a cheerful optimism about life.

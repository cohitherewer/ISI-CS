Deck up your den for Diwali

Vibrant candles, fresh flowers and a riot 

of hues ready your home for the coming festivities with a personal touch,

 As the lights and sounds of Durga puja fade away, giving way to another bout of celebrations, its time to gear up for Diwali. And along with a vibrant touch to your wardrobe, its also time to lend some colour and sparkle to your home.

 The occasion does call for lots of lights in the form of candles and diyas during the festive evening, but there are a lot of other ways to deck up the interiors for the festival of lights.

 Diwali d?cor is an expression of a womans individual aesthetics. Every woman wants to decorate her home for the festival and it should be very individual, feels interior designer Anita Mansata.

 GoodLife talks to interior experts to find some d?cor dos for Diwali.

 Light lustre

 Light is obviously the mainstay of Diwali d?cor and though modern alternatives like small colourful bulbs serve the purpose of lighting up your home, traditional ones like diyas and candles score higher on the aesthetic scale.

 Terracotta diyas of various shapes and sizes are always in fashion and they look beautiful. You can go for the plain ones or the more ornate sequinned diyas or hand-painted ones, says Anita. You can light them up with oil in the traditional way, or place small candles inside them.

 Scented candles in different shapes, sizes and colours placed all over the house will add three basic elements that ring in the festive feel ? lights, colours and fragrance.

 Diwali is not just a festival of lights. Colours and fragrances are an integral part of the festival. Aromatic candles are thus a good choice. We also use lots of incense sticks while doing up a home for Diwali, says Indira Agarwal of Ferns and Petals.

 The other form of light decoration that gives a stunning effect is Orly or floating arrangement. A water-filled glass bowl with floating candles, fresh flowers and petals is usually placed near the entrance. The Orly arrangement is supposed to welcome you as soon as you enter a house. The candles also burn longer when placed in water, says Indira.

 Petal pretty

 owers play a major role in any festive d?cor, more so during Diwali. Fresh flowers go well with any festivity and during this season we get lots of them in the market, says Indira.

 Right from roses, tuberoses, marigold and carnations to the more exotic Oriental lilies, Asiatic lilies and anthuriums, the choice is endless.

 These can be used in arrangements to decorate various nooks and corners of the house, as well as in elaborate rangolis that are vital to the puja. Indira recommends the use of coloured pebbles made of glass and crystals along with petals in rangolis.

 While fresh flowers are the flavour of the festival, you can combine them with loads of other forms to stunning effect. Crystal flowers in silver, gold and different colours as well as fillers made of crystal help bring oodles of sparkle into your home.

 Acrylic and silk flowers, again in silver, gold and bright colours, lend a vibrant touch.

 We also use lots of natural dried flowers that are coloured in hues of orange, red, yellow, silver and gold and glittered, adds Indira, whose store on 8/1 Loudon Street boasts a wide collection of flower arrangements specially made for Diwali.

 owers can also be combined with peacock feathers as fillers, as this enhances the festive feel.

 Colour call

 Once youve finished the two main elements of decor, let your imagination rule as you add some sparkle and colour to the surroundings.

 There can be many innovative ways of doing up your home and for that you dont even need to spend much. Just take out some beautiful drapes from your wardrobe and play around with them in any way you like, suggests Anita.

 Pieces of bright-coloured, sequinned, embroidered or stone-studded fabrics can be wrapped around cushions, used as linen or draped around rods. Vibrant bandhni saris when draped over the curtains as frills produce a gorgeous effect.

 The other very important part of Diwali d?cor is the bandanwar or door decoration. 

 Small bells made of terracotta or ceramic, fresh or silk flowers, silver and golden beads can be combined to do up hanging decorations for the door and even windows.

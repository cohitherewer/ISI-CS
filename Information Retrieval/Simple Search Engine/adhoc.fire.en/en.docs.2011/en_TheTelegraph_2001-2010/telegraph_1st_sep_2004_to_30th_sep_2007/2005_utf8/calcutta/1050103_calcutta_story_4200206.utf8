The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Peak-hour noise monitor meters at 30 key crossings

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Alarmed at the rising noise pollution, the brunt of which is borne by educational and health institutions and residents of roadside buildings, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board has decided to monitor sound levels at 30 road intersections across the city.

 The move follows a sample survey conducted recently by the board in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Beleghata, Behala, Minto Park, Burrabazar, Jadavpur, Rabindra Sarani and Shyambazar.

 The peak-hour noise at all these places were found to be between 70 and 80 decibel (db).

 According to the norms set by the Centre, the permissible daytime sound level in residential zones must not exceed 55 db. For commercial and industrial areas, the permissible limits are 65 db and 75 db. 

 The corresponding figures for night are 45, 55 and 65 db. 

 ?There is no denying that the peak-hour noise at some places is really unbearable. Indiscriminate blowing of air horns disturbs students and adds to the patients? woes in hospitals. We are trying to evolve some effective means to curb the menace,? said pollution control board member-secretary Shyamal Sarkar. 

 The projects lined up by the board include installation of sophisticated sound meters at 30 locations. The gadgets will work round-the-clock and will ascertain the decibel, sound frequency, nature of sound and the peak-hour noise pollution. An action plan will be prepared based on the findings, Sarkar added.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Arun Sharma said honking horns unnecessarily is a punishable offence.

 ?The area around a health or an educational institution is a no-horn zone, but a section of drivers invariably violates the rule. We often book errant drivers and fine them Rs 100 each, but the menace has not been rooted out. It is not possible for the police alone to fight sound pollution, in the absence of proper infrastructure and adequate manpower,?? Sharma said. 

 The traffic police, he informed Metro, are preparing a blueprint for curbing sound pollution, in consultation with the environment and the transport departments.

 Environment secretary Asim Barman underscored the need for creating public awareness. 

 ?We must enforce the rules strictly, but it is also imperative to make people aware of the effects of pollution,? Barman argued. 

 According to state pollution board officials, the main reasons for the rise in noise pollution are excessive blowing of horns, indiscriminate use of loudspeakers and occasional bursting of crackers.

 ?During the survey, we had come across several drivers unnecessarily honking their horns. Some others were spotted playing tape-recorders in their cars at full volume,? said a board official. 

 The board is being flooded with complaints from various organisations, institutions as well as residents of roadside buildings about the ?horrible phenomenon?.

 According to doctors, any high-frequency sound can be fatal for cardiac and neurological patients. 

 Besides, high-decibel sound causes high blood-pressure, stroke, cardiac arrest and hearing and sleeping disorders. The effect on students is only too well-known.

 Trinamul braces for bulldozers 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Unable to elicit a positive response from railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav regarding provision of land to rehabilitate squatters along the tracks between Tollygunge and Ballygunge, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has directed party members to gear up to oppose the eviction.

 Though the railways might seek more time when the case on squatter rehabilitation comes up for hearing on July 15, Mamata is convinced that it won?t finally agree to provide land to the settlers. 

 ?Though Lalooji expressed concern about the fate of the settlers when we spoke a few days ago, he did not promise anything about providing land to them,? Mamata told her associates on Tuesday. 

 She added that she had requested the minister to give a serious thought to the matter. 

 ?If bulldozers are used to evict the settlers, we know how to counter them,? the Trinamul chief warned. She was not available for comment, but the general secretary of her party, Mukul Roy, made it clear that any attempt to evict the settlers would be opposed. 

 According to Trinamul sources, Mamata will leave for Delhi to discuss the matter once again with Yadav, after the party?s rally on July 21 to commemorate the death of 13 Youth Congress activists in police firing. The leadership has already instructed the party?s Rajya Sabha member, Dinesh Trivedi, to take up the matter with senior railway officials.

 Trinamul legislator from Dhakuria Saugata Roy, who is also the president of the Tollygunge-Ballygunge Railway Sangram Committee, said the party is preparing a blueprint on its next course of action. 

 ?We are waiting for the case to be heard. Let?s see what the railways have to say about providing land to the settlers,? he added.

 The proposal for alternative accommodation having met with resistance, the settlers are preparing for a long haul under a common platform, irrespective of party affiliation.

 ?If the railways do not provide us with land, we will approach the state government to provide the land for our rehabilitation. It is the government?s headache to resolve the matter,? stated Ratan Roy, Trinamul councillor of the area and member of the Sangram committee.

 The government, however, is trying to make the squatters move on their own. Lake police station officers have initiated a dialogue with the settlers to that end.

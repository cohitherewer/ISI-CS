 More colour, more flavour, and more mouth-watering delicacies from Hyderabad and Coorg, are on offer at Tamarind.

 For, the eatery at 64 Sarat Bose Road has just added some hard-to-find-on-any-other-menu items to its food list. The decision to make the menu more elaborate stirred out of the thought of re-consolidating its position as a south Indian speciality restaurant.

 ?If you are not providing a wide variety of a particular cuisine, you cannot be called a speciality restaurant. There is a wide array of delicacies these states have to offer and as an authentic south Indian restaurant, as we claim to be, we must give the people of Calcutta a taste of everything,? says Shafiul Ishaque, owner of Tamarind.

 The 90-seater restaurant was established in April 2004 and is a rare only-south Indian address in the city that serves non-vegetarian dishes from that part of the country.

 ?The belief that south Indian cuisine is all about vegetarian dishes is a myth. Coorg and Hyderabadi food have a variety of non-vegetarian items. The belief that we use coconut in large quantities again is not totally correct. It is used sparingly as and when required,? says Ishaque. 

 The new dishes that have been added to the menu are Coorg Chicken, Mutton Fry, Hyderabadi Biryani, Salan, Gosht Ki Shikampur, Pomfret Fry, Erachi Barata Curry, Andhra Pulao and Hyderabadi Keema Murg Pulao. The new items that have been included in the menu will be served on the buffet till March 6, at Rs 199. 

 Quench your thirst with the new range of mocktails that are being whipped up. Coromandel Cocktail (concoction of tender coconut water and honey), Malabar Mix (coconut lassi), Kanya-Kumari Koncoction (the southern special fruit punch) and Lovedale Lake (strawberry crush with lime and soda) are some of the special sips.

 The desserts include Cool Coorg (mango juice with coffee liquor and ice cream), Munnar Magic (fresh cream with milk, cinnamon powder and ice cream) and Backwater Blues (iceberg float). The prices of these concoctions range between Rs 30 and Rs 65.

Nature crafts

 Nimble Fingers is organising an exhibition to promote various forms of crafts from all over Bengal. The exhibition of terracotta mugs, cups, saucers and wind chimes is on at Caffeine on 10/4 F Elgin Road. The NGO?s exhibition was inaugurated on February 25 and will continue till March 10.

 ?The motive behind organising such exhibitions is to create awareness about the handmade and traditional crafts of Bengal. The products on display have been created by artisans residing in some remote areas of Bengal. The sale proceeds would go to the artistes,? says Shubhojit Roy, secretary of Nimble Fingers. The prices of the products range between Rs 15 and Rs 450.

Neck line

 Arrow, the premium menswear brand, has launched a new range of shirts with self-adjustable collars. This is one of the many in a series of firsts like Bespoke, adjustable trousers and unstainable shirts. This is the first time any apparel company has launched self-adjusting collar shirts, claims Arrow. 

 ?We have a deeper understanding of the requirements of the customers. The collar sizes across all brands are standardised. But keeping in mind the convenience of the customers, we are launching the adjustable collar range,? says Janak Dave, business head, Arrow.

 The idea behind launching this shirt was to look into the requirements of people whose neck size does not match their collar size when it comes to wearing a tie. This results in discomfort (also known as pain in the neck!) throughout the day. 

 The adjustable shirt line is crafted in super-fine two-ply cotton and is available in colours like white, blue, beige, grey and yellow. The shirts are found in Arrow outlets all over the country and are priced at Rs 1,395-plus.

Leather lair

 You do not necessarily have to go into the woods to nurture your love for wildlife. For, there is a jungle out there in the two outlets of Leather World at 50B Shakespeare Sarani and Metro Plaza.

 After pioneering leather utility goods like wallets, handbags, portfolio bags, belts and mobile cases, Leather World has brought to the people of Calcutta animals in leather.

 Tigers, lions, elephants, panthers, practically all popular members of the animal kingdom, are available in the leather model. These are handcrafted with genuine leather, in natural colours and textures.

 ?Previously, people would use leather bags and wallets to give out as gifts. But the exotic range of leather animals will give people an alternative for doling out durable gifts. These can also be used as decoration pieces,? says Andaleeb Hashmi, owner of Leather World.

 The pieces are crafted in Calcutta, Indore and Agra. The highly durable items are priced between Rs 300 and Rs 7,000, depending on the size that varies from six inches to the original size of the animal.

Global garb

 From Shantipur to Shanghai ? students of The Apparel Training and Design Centre, Calcutta, charted a fashionable route on Friday to put Bengal on the global style map. 

 Boyon ?05, a fashion show organised by the institute in association with the Directorate of Handloom and Textiles, government of West Bengal, at Annapurna Garden in Garia, was targeted exclusively at the exporters of the eastern region. Creating exportable garments out of traditional Bengal handlooms was the show highlight, with an added intention of helping the weavers of Shantipur. 

 Boyon, the Bengali translation for weave, showcased the ?modern? use of traditional silks and cotton handlooms from the state, apart from using jute, tussar, viscose and rayon in Indian, western and Indo-western ensembles. ?The garments have been designed for the next style season and exclusively for export purposes,? stressed Ranjan Dasgupta, principal of the institute. 

 ?The project was given to our institute by the Handloom and Textiles Directorate of West Bengal. We have attempted to develop new fabrics into exportable garments,? he elaborated.

 With sequences titled Oomph, Spring Flowers, Life is Beautiful, Quilt Quench, Rang De Basanti Chola, Ikkat Era and Silk Route, the collections presented were bound to be lively. Multi-layered garments for both men and women, accessorised with caps and socks, casual Indo-western wear for women with lots of frills and flounces, semi-formal wear for the ?metrosexual? man in cotton twills, flowing silhouettes for women in a riot of colours, Ikkats fused with Japanese motifs, Chinese designs in Shantipur cotton and silk blends, were some of the ramp picks created by the budding designers.

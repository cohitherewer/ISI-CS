 Three men and their music mantra

 Ashish Roy, Ashvin Mani Sharma 

 and Arjun Vagale have more than just the A-factor of their 

 names in common theyre Delhi-based DJs and 

 music producers who recently decided to pool in their resources 

 and form an electronica band called The Jalebee Cartel. 

 We have known each other 

 for a while now. All of us have been in the industry for 

 about eight years. More importantly, we think alike, which 

 is extremely important for musicians, says Arjun, 

 the charmer in the group. 

 In the words of Ash (the self-proclaimed 

 dreamer): We dont make remixes but we make remakes 

 because we rerecord the tracks ourselves! 

 At Tantra, the Cartel came together 

 for an evening of house and psychedelic tracks titled Twisted 

 Sessions. Their house music repertoire included tracks like 

 Lanoche by Coca Villa, Owner of a lonely heart (new mix) 

 by Max Graham and Drop the Pressure by Mylo.

 The hero

 Ladies night out is becoming quite a common phenomenon 

 in Calcutta night clubs. Some give discounts on entry, others 

 offer complimentary drinks. 

 But B.E.D. (bar, entertainment and dining) on Ballygunge 

 Circular Road dished out a handsome hunk in the form of 

 Milind Soman on Friday night just for the party gals. 

 The model-turned-actor, who had partied hard the whole 

 night at Shisha when he came to town for the promotion of 

 his film Jurm in February this year, made a brief visit 

 to the Ballygunge address after midnight.

 I like to party and mix around with people, 

 said Milind, taking a break from the dance floor. 

 The women in the house went berserk over the man, as cellphones 

 and cameras worked overtime and everybody tried to get within 

 touching distance.

 Usha fans

 The members of Light Horse Bar in Saturday Club were in 

 for a pleasant surprise on Wednesday night when Usha Uthup 

 dropped in unannounced and treated everybody to some evergreen 

 numbers in an impromptu performance. 

 Belting out numbers from the 60s and the 70s like only 

 she can, Usha made it a night to remember.

 A motley crew of regulars had gathered at the bar after 

 its recent renovation. The bar was set up by the Light 

 Horse regiment. Keeping this in mind, the management committee 

 decided to spruce it up without disturbing the authentic 

 ambience and old-world charm of the place, said Brigadier 

 A.K. Dutta, CEO and secretary of Saturday Club.

 The renovated bar was reopened only on Wednesday 

 and the members were having a nice time in it when Usha 

 Uthup dropped in, smiles Dutta.

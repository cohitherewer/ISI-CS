 Fire control room crucial at Writers?

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has been grappling with repeated outbreaks of fire at its administrative headquarters. But with little funds and lesser attention given to long-term preventive measures, the fire minister is worried about the situation spinning out of control in the event of another mishap.

 The fire services department is now chalking out a list of corrective measures, including setting up a control room at Writers? Buildings to avert accidents.

 However, fire minister Pratim Chatterjee is still ruing the government not taking up major long-term plans in this regard. 

 ?I have drawn up a detailed plan, which I will submit to the chief minister,? he said on Sunday.

 A control room, manned round-the-clock by officials from the public works and fire services departments, is imperative, Chatterjee said. 

 ?They can keep a close watch on every corner of the building, where old wiring and worn-out fire-safety equipment have made the situation precarious,? he added.

 ?It is fortunate that all fires at Writers? in the recent past had occurred during the day. Had they occurred at night, the situation could have spun out of the control of fire services officials,? the minister emphasised.

 Stressing on the need for fire, smoke and heat alarm systems, the minister said: ?All these modern gadgets are very crucial, because officials can be alerted about the exact location of even a small fire. So, the present fire-prevention system needs to be overhauled??

 Chatterjee reasoned: ?Fire services no longer means only dousing flames with water.?

 ?A large number of the incidents of fire are because of the air-conditioners. These machines need to be examined from time to time by the public works department (PWD). I am not sure how often that is carried out. The measures taken so far are not enough, and so, I will request the chief minister to implement a thorough plan to avert a disaster,? the fire minister said.

 PWD minister Amar Choudhury, in charge of the overall maintenance of Writers?, said: ?There is a funds crunch when it comes to addressing an overhaul of fire-safety measures at Writers?. Specific schemes need to be discussed between the fire and PWD departments. The finance department can also be approached.?

 Rising sun to shine on Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The land of the rising sun is all set to shine on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Bengal.

 In February 2006, a 75-member business delegation from Japan will visit Calcutta to explore a variety of business opportunities.

 Osamu Watanabe, chairman and CEO, Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), will lead the team, that will also visit New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai between February 5 and 11.

 ?Japanese companies have always looked at options in southeast Asia and China. But now, they want to have collaborations in India, and Bengal is very much on our agenda,? Fujii Hiroshi, director, Jetro, told Metro on Tuesday evening.

 ?There were some doubts about Bengal among the Japanese investors, but the state?s image has changed due to the chief minister,? he summed up, after meeting chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and a host of other officials through the day.

 The focus area for the team will be automobile and auto components, electronic components, research and development, and outsourcing. 

 Different groups, with specific industry interests, will travel to various parts of the country, after spending four days in Delhi and Bangalore.

 The teams looking at opportunities in R amp;D, automobile and components will come to Calcutta between February 9 and 11.

 ?Among foreign investors, Japan has the highest exposure in West Bengal. It seems that they are now trying to expand the scope and that is good news for industry in the state,? said Rajeev Singh, regional director, CII eastern region.

 Bengal tops the list of states in terms of attracting investment from Japan. 

 Mitsubishi Corporation?s investment of $450 million is the single largest foreign direct investment in the state. 

 Besides, government agencies, like the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, and Jetro are also active.

 Jetro, a division of the ministry of economy, trade and industry of the Japanese government, has funded the feasibility study for the East-West Metro Railway corridor project and is also keen to take part in other infrastructure areas like power.

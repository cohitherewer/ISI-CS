 End road menace, thunders Buddha

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday termed the practice of private buses racing with each other down city streets a ?menace? . He said stringent action is being taken against private bus drivers violating rules.

 State home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy echoed the chief minister. He said the matter of rash driving by private buses is being reviewed and police have recently been instructed on ways to deal with the problem.

 Sukhari Pawan, 58, whose arm was torn off in an accident involving two speeding private buses on Sunday, is now stable. He is under treatment in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Drivers of both buses were arrested.

 ?Fresh instructions have been issued to the police, asking them to review the situation and take stringent measures against rash drivers of private buses and minibuses,? said Roy.

 ?The deputy commissioner of Calcutta Police (traffic) has been asked to hold detailed discussions with transport associations, as well as officials of state transport department, to find out ways to rein in errant drivers. Licences of drivers who violate traffic rules will be seized and criminal cases will be initiated against them,? he added.

 According to the home secretary, the matter was also discussed with the commissioner of city police. 

 Sunday?s accident occurred around 6 pm near the intersection of APC Road and Aurobindo Sarani. Paswan was travelling in a private bus on route 234. It was racing with another private bus on route 34C.

 Paswan was sitting near a window at the rear of the bus with a part of his arm outside. As the buses grazed against each other during an overtake attempt, the arm was wrenched off from the elbow. 

 Paswan was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he underwent a surgery. Police later recovered the torn arm.

 The hospital authorities said the hand was brought to them late and it was too severely damaged to be reattached surgically.

 ?Paswan is stable and recovering well. It was too late as well as complicated to surgically reattach his arm. He spoke to family members and newspersons today. He told the senior doctors that he was feeling a lot better,? said Utpal Dutta, principal of RG Kar hospital, on Tuesday.

 Paswan, who hawked ground gram, hails from Vaishali, in Bihar. He stays in Bosepara, on Bagbazar Street.

 ?We arrested the drivers. One of them was held on Sunday and the other, the day after. Stringent action will be taken against them according to the procedure laid down by the law,? asserted Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 91 trees face axe to make a wider road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city may have earned the dubious distinction of being the most polluted metro, but that doesn?t deter the local authorities from felling nearly 100 trees to widen a road.

 The South 24-Parganas administration has sought the forest department?s consent to chop 91 trees along a 13-km stretch of Budge Budge Trunk Road, from Zinzira Bazar to Indian Oil Corporation gate 6.

 The Rs 15.43-crore project entails widening, strengthening and shouldering the stretch, as well as construction and repair of culverts. A survey has been conducted and 91 trees ? mostly mahogany, banyan, Krishnachura, Chhatim, peepul and neem ? have been identified for felling.

 ?These trees, along with some electric and telephone posts, are a major hindrance to widening the road,? said Tapas Chowdhury, sub-divisional officer (Sadar), Alipore.

 District officials said the expansion work would depart from the existing alignment. The road could not be extended to the left, as the provisions for utility services ? such as the water mains of the Calcutta Metropolitan Water Supply Authority (CMWSA), electricity posts and telephone lines ? could not be relocated. 

 The water mains, for instance, run extremely close to the left edge of the road.

 The right-ward expansion, too, will not be entirely free of hurdles. ?Despite altering the alignment, we cannot help relocating certain utility facilities and chopping some trees,? said an official.

 The decision to fell such a large number of trees has sparked widespread protest in the neighbourhood.

 ?We do feel that the road needs to be widened. But the decision to cut nearly 100 trees cannot be accepted,? said Mursalin Mollah, CPM legislator from Mahestala. ?We will try and persuade the authorities concerned to change their stand,? he added. 

 Ashok Deb, Trinamul Congress MLA from Budge Budge, threatened to organise a people?s movement against the proposed felling of trees.

 ?An all-party meeting had been called on the issue and we had agreed to the felling of a few trees. But such a large-scale chopping of trees will not be tolerated,? he asserted.

 When contacted, state pollution control board officials said they would probe the matter and intervene, if deemed necessary. 

 ?Trees are being cut everywhere, but we need specific complaints to take action,? explained an official. According to him, the state does not have any specific law on felling of trees. ?Calcutta High Court has issued some guidelines. We will verify whether the authorities are abiding by them,? he added.

 Sub-divisional officer Chowdhury, however, claimed that the guidelines were being followed. ?We will plant six saplings to compensate for every tree felled,? he added.

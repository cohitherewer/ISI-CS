 Stalemate at college star-tag meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The University Grants Commission (UGC) meeting on Thursday to decide on bestowing centre-of-excellence status on short-listed colleges ? including eight in Bengal ?remained inconclusive, as some members objected to the parameters of selection.

 ?The centre-of-excellence tag is a prestigious honour. We have to examine all aspects before selecting the colleges,? UGC vice-chairman V.N. Rajasekharan Pillai said over the phone from Delhi. After a two-hour discussion, the commission?s standing committee decided to meet again next month.

 The objections raised by a section of members of the standing committee were mostly related to the UGC?s proposal that the colleges be graded in proportion to the number of self-financed courses they run, the number of grievances they deal with and the amount of donations they receive. 

 Summing up the members? objections, an official close to the panel wondered: ?How can one come to a conclusion that a college receiving more grievances is better? This is quite strange. If a college is run efficiently, there should obviously be fewer grievances.? 

 Officials in the state higher education department heaved a sigh of relief after news of the meeting ending in a stalemate reached the city. ?Most of the short-listed colleges from Bengal would have fared miserably had they been graded on the basis of their self-financed courses,? said an official.

 In the race for the tag are five city colleges ? St Xavier?s, Loreto, Scottish Church, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandir (in Belur) and Lady Brabourne ? and three in the districts ? Serampore Girls? College (affiliated to Calcutta University) and a college each under Burdwan and Vidyasagar universities.

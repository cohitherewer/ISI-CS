 Time plea to clear fair mess mounds

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Just a little over 24 hours left, and a mountain of mess to demolish. 

 Faced with mission impossible, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild on Wednesday appealed to the army and Calcutta Police for a grace period to clear the garbage from the site of the 30th Book Fair.

 The guild has also applied for permission to organise Book Fair 2006, from January 25 to February 5, at the same venue. ?We have applied, like every year,? said Sudhangshu Dey, ground convener of the guild. ?Now, it?s up to the authorities concerned to give us further instructions,? he added.

 According to a high court ruling, all fairs have to be shifted out of the Maidan, and to a yet-unprepared alternative site, this year.

 As far as the mess on the Maidan goes, Dey said: ?We have the whole of Thursday to clean up the place. We have to hand over this portion of the Maidan to the Calcutta Police and the army on February 11. But we realise that a lot of work remains to be done. So, we have written to the army and police to give us at least three to four more days.?

 The guild was confident of completing the clean-up work by February 15.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, who hadn?t received the guild?s appeal for extension of the clean-up deadline till Wednesday evening, said work was being monitored and the guild had been asked to expedite matters.

 Ranveer Kumar, deputy commissioner (headquarters), who visited the fair grounds on Wednesday, confirmed that ?work is going on as usual? and the guild had been asked to ?speed it up?.

 On Wednesday, a large number of stall structures were still to be dismantled and electricity poles yet to be brought down. An entire stretch was submerged in plywood, paper, plastic packets, earthen cups and sundry waste.

 ?Over 1,500 workers are on the job till late into the night,? said guild convener Dey, adding that the garbage is now being dumped in one corner of the fair ground, to be removed later. ?Like other years, we will ask the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to remove the garbage,? said Dey.

 The CMC was paid Rs 18,000 as conservancy charge by the guild authorities for the task last year, Dey claimed.

 But there was no sign of the war of words between the guild and the CMC abating on Wednesday. The mayor said the CMC hadn?t received last year?s conservancy charges from the guild. 

 ?Moreover, we will not maintain any ties with the guild if it doesn?t pay us amusement tax,? added the mayor.

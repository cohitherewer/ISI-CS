 Scam arrest amp; revamp

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In the wake of an arrest on Thursday in connection with the recent tax scam at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation office, state municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya announced that the government was taking steps to revamp the civic accounting system.

 Mohd Sirajul Haq was arrested at his Rifle Range Road residence in connection with the defalcation of more than Rs 1 crore from the civic treasury at Gariahat. 

 Haq, a head assistant at the treasury, had allegedly manipulated entries in the computer to siphon off the money. He was remanded in police custody till June 28.

 At Writers? Buildings, the minister added that municipal accounts committees should place monthly accounts in board meetings. 

 ?We want to make sure that the civic bodies keep their accounts clear and transparent. For this, a number of systems need to be introduced and followed,? Bhattacharya asserted. 

 In addition, the government has also made a policy decision to change the single-entry system to double-entry system. 

 The new system has already been introduced in the Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor project funded by the British government?s Department for International Development. The double-entry system is known to be foolproof. 

 Municipalities have been asked to carry out internal audits, because the Comptroller and Auditor-General audits are conducted after an interval, delaying the detection of financial discrepancies. 

 ?We are making it compulsory for the municipalities to place their accounts before ward residents and internal committees. We feel this will bring about transparency in the system. We want to make it clear that citizens have a right to know the accounts of their municipalities,? minister Bhattacharya signed off.

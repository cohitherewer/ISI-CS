 Staff shortage delays book index

 - Titles fail to reach section for bibliography update

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 It takes years for a new book to travel from National Library to Central Reference Library, a few yards away on the same campus. The consequence: readers are deprived of the titles and Indian National Bibliography ? Index Indiana, the only authentic index of books published in the country, cannot be updated and its publication gets delayed.

 The last issue of the bibliography, compiled by Central Reference Library and published by the Union culture department, was out in 2003. The 2004 issue is being printed.

 Most of the titles in the last issue of the bibliography ? a priceless guide for researchers and general readers alike, and the only one on books from India for libraries across the world ? were published five to six years ago.

 National Library director Sudhendu Mondol blames shortage of staff for the delay in sending books to the reference library. He has written to the Central government for immediate recruitment.

 Under the Delivery of Books Act, copies of all books published in 14 regional languages and English are to be sent to National Library. 

 The books then undergo ?Accession? at the various language sections. After titles and the authors are enlisted and the dimensions of the volumes measured, the books are sent to the reference library.

 The reference library enlists, catalogues and classifies the books, and then prepares the monthly and yearly versions of the bibliography.

 However, thanks to a staff crunch in the language sections, most new arrivals remain stacked in National Library for five to six years before they go through ?Accession?. As a ripple effect, the publication of the bibliography runs severely behind schedule.

 Readers, too, suffer in the process ? unless a title is enlisted and catalogued, it is not accessible to them.

 ?We need to get the titles from National Library on time for entering them in the bibliography. As the bibliography has to be published within a deadline, we miss out on several titles because of the delay,? said K.K. Kochukoshy, librarian of Central Reference Library and general editor, Indian National Bibliography. 

 ?The bibliography is a much-sought-after publication in both India and abroad. Countries like Germany, France and the United Kingdom order bulk supplies from India,? he added.

 National Library director Mondol said: ?There?s an acute shortage of staff in various departments, especially the language sections. Each section needs at least four more employees. We also need experts in Tamil, Assamese, Telugu, Punjabi, Gujarati and some other regional languages to classify the books.?

 The National Library Staff Association, too, has taken up the matter with the director.

 ?Thousands of books are piled in various divisions. They are supposed to be processed at the earliest and sent to the reference library. But this is not being done because of lack of staff. Officers-in-charge refuse to handle day-to-day work. We have offered to put in voluntary work to clear the backlog,? said Saibal Chakraborty, secretary of the association.

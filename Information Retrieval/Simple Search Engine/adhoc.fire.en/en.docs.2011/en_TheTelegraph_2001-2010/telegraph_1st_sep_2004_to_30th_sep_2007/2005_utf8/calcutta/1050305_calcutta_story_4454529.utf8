The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talks on to restore blackout bouquets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Saturday is when the country will get to know who the first Indian Idol will be. 

 Friday offered a ray of hope to the nearly 2.5 lakh cable households under SitiCable going without the STAR and Sony beams for almost a week now, to catch a glimpse of all the excitement.

 On Friday, Indian Cable Net, the distributor for STAR and Sony in the city, and Calcutta Communications (the SitiCable unit on whose network the channels were switched off last Saturday) approached Delhi High Court for an adjournment.

 Indian Cable Net had moved court contesting a judgment passed by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), which had directed it to switch on the channels on Calcutta Communications on Monday. Delhi High Court adjourned hearing of the case till March 9.

 Calcutta Communications and Indian Cable Net are now looking to settle the issue out of court, a decision that followed a six-hour meeting among representatives of the parties concerned on Thursday.

 ?We are trying to reach mutually acceptable terms and conditions through discussion,? offered a spokesperson for Indian Cable Net. 

 According to sources, a set of guidelines has been framed for both sides to agree on and abide by. The companies have sent the guidelines to their respective legal departments for review.

 STAR, Sony, Indian Cable Net and Calcutta Communications are scheduled to meet on Saturday to ?thrash out all the differences once and for all?. 

 With everything falling in place, the two beams are likely to return to the households serviced by Calcutta Communications on Saturday evening, just in time for the high-profile finals of Indian Idol.

 The two channel bouquets had been switched off on charges of piracy. 

 STAR and Sony had alleged that Calcutta Communications provides unauthorised signal to around 25 cable operators and few hotels. Calcutta Communications had approached TDSAT and the matter subsequently reached Delhi High Court.

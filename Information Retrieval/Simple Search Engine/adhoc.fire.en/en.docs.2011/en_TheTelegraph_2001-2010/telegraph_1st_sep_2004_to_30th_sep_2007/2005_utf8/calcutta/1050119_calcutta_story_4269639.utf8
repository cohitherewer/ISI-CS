 Kids best at home, observes court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday observed that children should not be involved in legal wrangles between parents. 

 The court pointed out that the children should not be allowed to witness the proceedings of such cases, as it causes extreme mental stress, which, in turn, adversely affects the development of their mental faculties.

 While instructing a mother, who is fighting a case against her separated husband, to come to court on Monday for a reconciliation, Justice Amit Talukdar of the high court said: ?Do not bring your daughters to court on Monday. Your legal battle against your husband will affect the mental condition of your daughters and that will be reflected in their studies.?

 The court said that even the Supreme Court had observed that the children should not be parties in a case between their parents.

 Middle-aged Sabita Dutta, along with her two teenaged daughters, appeared in person in the courtroom of Justice Talukdar on Tuesday. 

 ?Sir, my endless distress prompted me to knock the door of the judiciary. On the basis of an earlier court order, I receive a sum of Rs 1,000 every month from my separated husband, Soumendra Mohan Dutta, an employee of a nationalised bank,? Sabita told the judge.

 ?You can realise that it is impossible for me to maintain my children on this meagre sum. Therefore, I am requesting you to intervene in the matter and do something so that I can survive with my daughters,? she pleaded.

 Dutta added: ?My elder daughter had to quit studies for want of money. My younger daughter does not wish to do the same and is appearing for her Higher Secondary examination this year. Now, I have no option but to request you to pass an order so that I can get more money from my husband.?

 Justice Talukdar told Soumendra Mohan Dutta?s counsel Saswata Gopal Mukherjee that he wanted to hear the matter on Wednesday in the presence of his client. 

 Mukherjee prayed to the court to grant him some more time to contact Dutta. 

 The court fixed the next hearing on the matter on Monday.

 Dutta?s lawyer also told the court that his client was still interested in a reconciliation and wanted to stay with his daughters. 

 He alleged that Sabita was now living at a flat in Beleghata hired by his client. 

 ?The woman (Sabita), with the help of local hooligans, drove out her husband from the flat and then moved court, alleging that her husband used to beat her up in an inebriated state,? counsel Mukherjee told the court.

 ?But, my client, who is now leading a vagabond?s life, is still interested in returning to his wife and daughters. If Sabita thinks alike, the matter can be resolved in court,? the lawyer said. 

 He, however, asserted that local people and Sabita?s neighbours should not interfere in the domestic discord.

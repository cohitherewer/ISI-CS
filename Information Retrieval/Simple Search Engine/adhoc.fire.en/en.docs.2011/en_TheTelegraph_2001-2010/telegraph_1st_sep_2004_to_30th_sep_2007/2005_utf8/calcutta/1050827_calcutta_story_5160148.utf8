The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 My culture, my calling card

Eye on Calcutta 

 Renu Roy

 Unlike yesterday, people now are not only proud of their ethnicity but are confident about proclamations of it

 It is really quite intriguing how often Calcutta returns to the public eye on the screen. One wonders if the recent success of Parineeta, and the earlier hit that came out of Devdas, could lead towards a kind of genre film set in 19th or early 20th century Calcutta of the baboos. If the Wild West can still survive in cinema today, centuries later, is this certainly not a possibility? 

 The making of Jhumpa Lahiris novel The Namesake into a film by Mira Nair was shot expectedly in New York and Calcutta. So the Bollywood successes of Sarat Chandra?s almost forgotten works are not as isolated as examples as that they may seem to be. Devdas, of course, has long been a legend in Indian cinema, and has been remade into all the southern language cinemas, apart from the Bengali and Hindi versions. In fact, many of the enigmatic southern stars have been known to rise to stardom with their screen portrayals of the self-destructive lover. 

 Even the Hindi small screen has tried to cash in on the interest created by films located in the Bengal of yesteryear with the revival of Saheb Bibi Aur Ghulam. And the number of daily soaps on the Hindi satellite network that show women draped in those gorgeous Dhakai sarees worn in the manner of our grandmothers seems to be growing every day. Am I being presumptuous in thinking that Chhoti Bahu has become a cult figure on the national screen? I am neither a film critic nor an academic concerned with esoteric and fashionable disciplines like culture studies, but there does seem to be a groping towards a definitive ethnicity among our filmmakers and audiences today. 

 Parineeta, in fact, has spawned a plethora of fashion shows, musical evenings and theme parties which I am sure some of you may have witnessed or even participated in. 

 What is suddenly so exciting and chic about the ambience of Bengal in the past? Is it just a passing fad, or does it stem from the need to reaffirm some values in the increasingly value-bereft world that we live in. That it is not only about Bengal, nor is it a local fancy of the bored and idle rich of Calcutta is borne out by the fact that the arts, as the mirror of popular culture, chooses to explore other avenues and spaces as well. The evolution of Bhangra rock as an expression of the Punjabi diaspora comes a full circle when Bangla rock returns to folk roots with Bhoomi and Chandrabindoo for instance. It is not only about Notting Hill or Narkeldanga, or about Southall and Sarsuna, but about the need to articulate one?s roots in today?s context. 

 The success of intensely Punjabi films that strongly and aggressively assert their ethnicity, like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge at one end and Monsoon Wedding at the other end of the spectrum, seems to indicate a shift in the way the audience wishes to see its films today. This assertion of ethnicity is not only attractive to people who belong, or the diaspora, but also to a much wider audience. Mira Nair?s success with Monsoon Wedding has made her a cult figure in the most unlikely country of Japan. So much so, that a significant part of her funding for The Namesake was raised from the land of the rising sun. 

 See all this in the light of the reality that the characters of commercial Hindi cinema till the 70s, or perhaps even the 80s, never had surnames. For decades we have had to live with heroes like Mr. Rakesh and heroines called Miss Pooja, and comic servants like Ramoo, and the only surname that was acceptable was at best a Kumar, shown on the gate of the hero?s palatial mansion. 

 There was a conscious effort to shy away from identification of region among the characters of Hindi commercial cinema, for fear that the regional touch would distance the audience from the necessary identification with the protagonist. If Hindi film characters were denied their naam-gotra for so many decades, even when the stories themselves were embedded in regional literatures, why are we now suddenly confronted with the Bhallas, Banerjees and Baidyanathans on the national screen? 

 Obviously a quantum shift has taken place. People today are not only proud of their ethnicity, but are also confident about proclamations of it. In my own observation of people around me, I see many more of my male Muslim friends and associates wearing their customary caps and their cropped-moustaches-with-beards than they used to 30 years ago. Every time I go to a wedding I am no longer surprised to see more than one Bengali girl, sometimes even the bride, wearing her saree in the Gujarati drape, or a Marwari girl wearing hers a la Chandramukhi. Films are only a reflection of what is happening in the world outside, and that an assertion of ethnicity is taking place, is obvious. 

 Fortunately, Calcuttans have never really aggressively asserted their ethnicities, but have been able to promote a kind of laissez faire through time. Of course, we too have our shameful moments of disgrace like the Great Calcutta Killing. There is comfort of course in the fact that nothing quite like that has erupted since in the last 60 years. There was a not even a single Sikh life lost here in the days that followed Indira Gandhi?s assassination, when carnage had become the rule. We have every reason to be proud that in the three centuries of our history we have been able to welcome different communities and create a tradition of tolerance. 

 There is a dark side as well to this assertiveness that claims my attention when there are repugnant incidents like Godhra, or when I am confronted with the political demand for Greater Bombay to become a city-state, outside the influence of Greater Maharashtra. They indicate the complexity of the times we live in, and the insidious manner in which a turbulent multi-ethnic society articulates its own interpretation of ?democracy? and the assertion of ethnicity runs the risk of becoming synonymous with intolerance. 

 Perhaps we in Calcutta have both a historical opportunity and a tradition that equips us to look at the whole question of ethnicity with the quiet confidence that sponsors tolerance and enriches each other?s cultural lives and personal sensitivities. Perhaps we in Calcutta have the means to show the rest of the country, and the world maybe, that we can interpret multi-culturalism in terms that can withstand the challenges from the darker social and political forces that lurk in the shadows. 

 Of course it will take our courage and our conviction. And we may choose to be inspired by Bhola Moira, the unlettered bard of 19th century Calcutta, when he sang out in protest and in favour of a Vidyasagar under attack. Viddeshagor mathaar moni, naarir muktidata/ Taar unchoomatha henth koriye dholaali Kolkata. (Vidyasagar is the jewel in our crown, the liberator of our women/ How can you make him hang his head in shame?)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Study reflects what bus users want 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A recent study commissioned by the state transport department on Calcutta?s buses reiterates what regular passengers have been yearning for. 

 Apart from suggesting ?rattle-free? and comfortable bus bodies, the report submitted by Consulting Engineering Services (CES) also calls for annual amendments to the motor vehicle rules.

 The study aimed at examining the state of public transport in the city and suggesting measures for improvement.

 The consultants observed that chapter 7 of the existing West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, is not updated regularly. Besides, the existing rules are silent on the length, width, overall height and other specifications of the body of a vehicle, as well as on basic factors concerning passenger comfort. The rulebook regulates construction, equipment and maintenance of motor vehicles in the state.

 CES has suggested that the government bring amendments in the rules and incorporate provisions relating to the structure of vehicles, as well as on passenger comfort.

 The rules should also be amended every year, taking into account the technological changes in the automobile industry, particularly in bus body manufacturing, they said.

 The consultants have recommended that ordinary buses have a minimum leg room of 279 mm and luxury buses 406 mm. According to them, city buses should have seating space of not less than 380 mm in ordinary and 418 mm in luxury buses for each passenger. 

 The report also proposes widening of aisles from the existing 310 mm to 356 mm. Doors, which currently measure 530 mm, should not be less than 600 mm to facilitate easy entry and exit and the floor height should also be low.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said the report is yet to be discussed in the department. ?We have just received the report. The minister is yet to go through it. I?m sure some of the recommendations can be implemented,? he added.

 Other recommendations on passenger comfort include:

Provision for two doors

Push-back seats with spring loaded reclining mechanism

Pleasing interiors and exteriors, including d?cor and large bay windows

Avoiding of en route delays

 Buses should also have good air suspension, with the chassis mounted on tough pneumatic buffers to absorb shocks, a consultant says. In case of long-distance buses that run more than 150 km at a stretch, the air suspension is a must to reduce vibration. Also, the chassis should conform to the emission norms.

 Focussing on improving safety measures, the consultant wants the government to make accessories, like seat belts, rear view mirrors and collapsible bumpers, mandatory.

 ?There is a need to insist on a new truck and bus chassis to be fitted with power steering and power brakes, as well as a secondary brake system,? the report says.

 It recommends that the government extend subsidy schemes to encourage private operators to replace old buses.

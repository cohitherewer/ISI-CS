Debasish Nag: There is no garbage vat in Parnasree. Will you please see to it that a vat is installed in the area to keep it clean?

 Garbage is produced in every household, but the majority do not cooperate with the civic authorities for its disposal. I shall see to it that a permanent vat is built near Khudiram Bose Sarani to ensure that residents of Parnasree can live in hygienic surroundings.

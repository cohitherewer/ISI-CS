 Around 800 labourers engaged by the Silver Springs Housing Project, near ITC Sonar Bangla, were rendered homeless on Christmas as a fire razed their huts adjacent to the site. 

 The mishap struck around 8.30 am. None of the workers ? hailing from Bihar, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and other states ? was injured as they were at the construction site. But almost all lost their wages, paid recently, in the fire. 

 The blaze originated at the rear of the five-acre plot housing the 500-odd quarters of the workers. It spread fast through the huts made of bamboo, straw and other combustible material. Strong winds fanned the flames further.

 The fire services department was informed, even as the labourers and local residents tried their best to douse the fire by pouring buckets of water drawn from ponds nearby. By the time tenders arrived, the blaze had engulfed the entire area.

 Four tenders and a Browser fought for an hour and brought the fire under control. But nothing could be retrieved, as burnt bamboo poles and asbestos sheets were all that remained. Apart from money, the labourers had lost their clothes and utensils. 

 ?The wind and the material with which the huts were made helped the fire spread rapidly. Nothing much was left after we put out the fire, the cause of which is yet to be ascertained,? said Partha Pratim Kar, in-charge of the local fire station.

 ?We were paid our wages on December 22 and none of us has sent the money home. All our belongings have gone,? lamented Mahesh Paswan, a labourer from Bihar. 

 ?We have been staying here for the past two years and it is not before another year that the project will be completed and we can leave. We had settled down here with all our belongings and have lost everything,? said Ramesh Singh, a supervisor of the project. ?Had the fire broken out at night, many of us would have been dead.?

 The authorities of the Rs 100-crore housing project, a joint venture of Bengal Silver Springs Private Limited and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said the workers would be provided with alternative shelters.

 Sip champagne amp; sign up 

Fast-track screen for debutants

 - Club?s walk-in membership drive to woo corporate clients

 SUBHRO SAHA

 An outdoor champagne brunch on a mellow Sunday, offering an Indian, Oriental and Continental spread, with reggae riffs in the air and raffles for the kids? We are not talking just any winter carnival here. It?s the serious business of getting past the hallowed portals of an elite social club.

 As the waiting list outside city clubs lengthens, DI (Dalhousie Institute) is rolling out an out-of-the-box effort to cut through the clutter. The club opposite Modern High is opening an ?informal? window to induct 10 corporate members under its 3-4-5 Priority Scheme, wherein four executives from a private or public limited firm pay Rs 3 lakh for a five-year membership.

 ?It?ll be a completely casual setting on February 27, where you come in at 8 am with family and enjoy the sumptuous brunch, with champagne flowing on the club lawns, even as the committee members mingle with the applicants,? says DI president Derek O?Brien.

 And by 6 pm, the verdict is out, with the names of the 10 successful candidates ? picked through the novel single-window, fast-track scheme ? announced.

 ?It?s prompt, fun and transparent,? stresses O?Brien, even as the 42, Jhowtalla Road address gears up to take in 800 new individual members over the next three years to support its upcoming Rs 10-crore sports-cum-leisure complex.

 Across the road, it?s enrolment time at CC amp;FC, too. The club has laid out a criteria crucible based on a scoring scale of 100, with different values attached to various attributes.

 While ?interest in sports? accounts for the maximum 50 points, ?age and occupation? take up 20. ?Compatibility with club ethos? and ?academics? make up the rest of the pie with 20 and 10 points, respectively.

 ?We have a huge backlog of 400-plus applicants piling up since 2000, and we want to take in a few members in March,? says CC amp;FC president Utpal Ganguly.

 The club, careful not to ?overload? the roster, has set up a screening committee for ?stringent? scanning. All applicants have also been allotted computerised IDs for ?transparency? in processing.

 Tollygunge Club, which has a waiting list dating back to 1996, can scarcely afford to open the floodgates to let in permanent members.

 Sitting on the ?optimum? cushion of 1,500 permanent members, a filtered flow of new corporate members is maintained subject to vacancy, with stiff riders of a Rs 100-crore turnover and a Rs 10-crore net worth as floor qualifications.

 At Saturday Club, too, the freeze on new individual members stays, with the Wood Street institution brimming at 2,200-plus. ?We are taking in members? children, though, besides a few corporate members every now and then,? says president Vijay Burman.

 Like DI, the club scours the profile of the aspiring corporate firm and its past three years? balance sheets, with short-listed applicants first called for the ?informal meet seven?, when seven members of the committee interact with the nominees. 

 A two to three-month probation period is followed by a full-fledged interview for those getting the nod.

 Pre-poll alert on leaders, criminals

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The officers-in-charge (OCs) of all 48 police stations in the city have been asked to keep an eye on political developments and rowdies in their area in view of the upcoming civic polls.

 At a pre-poll meeting at the police headquarters in Lalbazar on Thursday, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee called upon all the OCs to keep a tab on political developments in their area and prepare reports.

 The reports should have details of the increase in political activities and notes on all crackdowns, including those on local toughs, goons and groups trying to resurface in view of the polls, the commissioner said.

 He added that to file such reports, the OCs would have to be in closer contact with the masses and step up their vigil of neighbourhoods.

 In a near-repetition of what chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said earlier to his men in uniform, all the OCs were told that there should be no discrimination on the basis of political affiliation while arresting goons. The cops were also asked to collect information relevant to the polls.

 ?This was the first meeting before the polls. The officers have been adequately briefed on how to assess the situation and react accordingly to ensure that mistakes of the past are not repeated,? said police commissioner Mukherjee. 

 ?Today?s meet was also an attempt to gauge how much the officers know about their respective areas. It appears they have done their homework well,? he added. 

 Besides Mukherjee, the police brass, including the additional commissioners, joint commissioners and the divisional deputy commissioners were present at the meeting. 

 Prior to submitting reports on political developments in their areas, the OCs have been asked to submit reports on the condition of the polling booths.

 ?Certain booths may not be suitable for polling, while there may be a law-and-order threat at others. We have been asked to make an assessment of such booths so that the necessary changes can be made before the polls,? said an OC.

 The police commissioner will soon meet the chief secretary and the home secretary over the civic polls.

 Little man on the big screen

 Rajpal Yadav with Rituparna Sengupta in Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh

 He is billed as the small wonder of the big screen. In an industry where comedians have always been last-minute add-ons in an effort to induce belly laughter, he?s had people writing films around him. Because, with Rajpal Yadav around, you are guaranteed truckloads of giggles, chuckles, sniggers and everything in between.

 So, you have writer-director Chandan Arora, the man who gave Rajpal his breakthrough role of a village simpleton helping his lady love become Madhuri Dixit, scripting a dream role for the little big man. And this time, the Main in the title is Rajpal himself, trying to figure things out between his patni and the mysterious woh.

 ?Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh is my best performance ever and that includes my entire career in films and theatre,? says an excited Rajpal. ?I respect every performance in all my films. But this one is 3D in every possible way ? length, mentality, need, conflict, everything.?

 Rajpal feels that his association with Arora will take on legendary proportions in time to come. ?The way he has experimented with me has given the actor in me a lot of satisfaction... In this new film, humne Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon ke purana chemistry ka faida liya. When he decided to make Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh, he called me up or we sat face-to-face for even the minutest of changes, character kis mod pe ja raha hai... So I was living the character of Mithilesh Shukla all the while. There has been a lot of work on detailing ? from my haircut to my gaining of 10-12 kg for the role.?

 The film is also a comeback of sorts for Tollywood queen Rituparna Sengupta on the Bollywood screen. And if Rajpal is to be believed, the actress is a revelation in the film. ?The conflict between Rituparna and me in the film is very different from the conflict between my character Raja and Chhutki (Antara Mali) in Main Madhuri...,? is how Rajpal puts it.

 ?Here, there?s a lovely relationship between the husband and wife but the pati suffers from an inferiority complex. I would say that Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh is five times more mature than Main Madhuri... which was a lovely film at the time of its release.?

 But will it be a box-office no-no like its predecessor and only be lapped up on the small screen?

 ?We have made the film with a lot of love and care and my positive thinking tells me that the audience should come to the theatres to watch it. I am 100 per cent in love with my role and I know this film will give a new character to Indian film history.?

 We have to wait for Friday to see whether history is indeed made.

 As for Rajpal, he has his hands full. ?March tak poora busy hoon,? he elaborates. ?I have films with everyone from Ram Gopal Varma to Satish Kaushik to David Dhawan to Priyadarshan. And each one of them has been written with me in mind.?

 Can?t talk about love, but talent does come in all sizes!

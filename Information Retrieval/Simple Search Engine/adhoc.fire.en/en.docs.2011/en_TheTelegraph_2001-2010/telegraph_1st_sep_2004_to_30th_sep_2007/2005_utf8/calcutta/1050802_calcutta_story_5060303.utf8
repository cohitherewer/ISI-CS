 After an inaugural fashion show with Tollywood stars showcasing various Indian ensembles recently at Jamuna banquets, Roop Shringar Sarees launched its very own showroom at 7, Sudder Street on Sunday. Inaugurated by actress Mouli Ganguly, the 8,000-sq-ft retail outlet will house saris, lehngas and salwar suits from different states around the country. 

 We have chosen Calcutta to set up our retail base and will look forward to expanding our chain across India, said Suresh Tolani, director, Roop Shringar Sarees. 

 Our designs and outfits are much sought after in India, Bangladesh, Mauritius, the UK and West Asia. It was always our dream to have an exclusive outlet, but it takes time. With 28 years of experience, we are now ready to repeat our success in the retail sector, he adds. 

 The Roop Shringar showroom will showcase a mix of affordable and premium designer wear ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 1.5 lakh. This includes Benarasis, kanjeevarams, paitis, patolas, gadwals, venkatagiris and bandhnis, to name a few. 

 There are also more modern crepes and georgettes that have been stylised with zardosi work, embroidery and embellishments like kundan, sequins and crystals. 

 Tunnel tales

 Calcutta was drenched in more fun than rain over the weekend, with Tantra hosting a theme party titled What Lies Within on the lines of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. While the entrance to the nightclub resembled a cave ? dark and dingy ? thereafter there was no sight of the 40 thieves nor the chests of wealth that are synonymous with the fairytale.

 Instead, it was the scintillating performances of Nilofer Khan and Rachna Maurya that upped the tempo of the party. The performers dressed in their Arabic best emerged from a big black pot placed in the centre of the bar. The dancing duo set the bar top ablaze to songs like Deedar de, Kajra re and Baras ja.

 Dhaba do

 The couches gave way to charpoys, the Punjabi platter took over Chinese cuisine and the Jazzy Bs and Sukhbirs took control of the console. Fusion, the resto bar at The Golden Park, was converted into a dhaba ? Chakki da Dhaba. 

 We have quite a few Punjabi patrons. The night is a tribute to them. Everybody likes theme nights because they provide value-added entertainment in the form of ambience, special mocktails and snacks, said a spokesperson for the resto bar.

 For the occasion, DJ Sanjay was flown down from Hyderabad to provide some Punjabi panache to the evening. His repertoire included songs like Kali teri choti, Gur nal ishq mita and Teri toh. 

 The staff, too, was dressed in pagris and dhotis. The kebab section saw quite a few takers.

 Starry stop

 When it comes to shaking a leg on the dance floor, nothing beats Bollywood beats. Unless its a congregation of Tollywood stars dancing to the tunes. Starstruck, the retro lounge at Forum, was witness to such an event recently. 

 The programme in memory of mahanayak Uttam Kumar, organised on Saturday, was a big success. To celebrate it with all of Tollywood, I have thrown this small party, said Pallavi Chatterjee, the hostess of the get-together. 

 While the boy brigade consisted of actors Jisshu Sengupta, Tapas Pal, Kunal Mitra and Arjun Chakraborty, the girl gang included Chandrayee Ghosh, Koneenica Banerjee, Monami Ghosh and Nilanjanaa. 

 The house was packed by 9 pm, and the stars were soon grooving to tracks like Saki saki, Bin tere sanam and Dus bahane.

 Tales of womankind

 Dignity Foundation, in association with Spandan, presents a theatre event, Three Acts of Faith, featuring three short dramatic enactments. Dealing with themes about women and how they cope with life?s trials, the plays offer a frank, honest appraisal of the truth in women?s lives. The first play, The Divorce, is a solo act, written by Nag Bodas, directed by Lee-Alison Sibley and performed by Renu Roy. Set in a courtroom, it is a one-act play in which a woman makes an impassioned plea for divorce, in somewhat unusual circumstances. The Runaways, written by Bubbles Sabherwal, directed by Lee-Alison Sibley and performed by Renu Roy and Mira Kakkar (a scene from the play appears above), is a story of two women who meet by chance on a bus journey. Exploring their past, it shows how the women discover a common bond while helping each other deal with their emotional crisis. Going Home, the concluding sketch, is a touching, humorous piece that expresses the natural affection and understanding between a widowed mother and her married daughter, who meet on their way home. Written by Neil Simson, this piece is directed by Punam Singh, who also acts with Nandini Das.

 The unrest at Jadavpur University continued on Thursday, with students of the engineering and technology faculty deciding to extend their class boycott till next week.

 Arrest warrants issued on Tuesday night against nine students for assaulting policemen on June 10 had sparked the agitation.

 On Thursday, the agitating students also threatened to intensify their protest if the authorities failed to take the necessary steps to dispose of the case against the nine ?within next week?.

 The chief judicial magistrate of Alipore court had declared the students ?absconders? and ordered Jadavpur police to arrest and produce them in court. They had not obtained bail after being charged under the Criminal Procedure Court.

 Eight of the students appeared before the court on Thursday and were granted bail. The ninth student is employed outside the state. The students said they have been asked to appear before the court again on December 16.

 Lectures were not held in any of the engineering and technology departments of the university on Thursday as the students stayed away from classrooms. Classes were, however, held in the other departments of the university.

 Members of faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) pressured the authorities, through demonstrations, to contact senior police officers and request them to withdraw the case against the students.

 University registrar Rajat Bandopadhyay promised to ensure that the students did not have to face harassment by police in connection with the case. But he added: ?We cannot give an assurance to the students that the case will be withdrawn within the deadline set by them. We are sympathetic towards their grievances. But we have to follow the right procedure.?

 The nine students are afraid that they might not be granted passports and may have to face difficulties in landing jobs with reputed companies if the cases against them are not withdrawn. 

 ?The university authorities should immediately take an initiative and contact the highest officers of the police and appeal to them to withdraw the case against us. If the case continues, it might jeopardise our career,? said one of the accused students.

 Fetsu leader Amit Chakraborty stated: ?It was the university officials who had called in the police on June 10 to break the fast-unto-death by some students in front of the gate. Now it is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that police withdraw the case.?

 The registrar, however, dismissed the allegation that the authorities had called in police to the campus that night.

 The students were forced to call off the strike after the incident. The South 24-Parganas police had subsequently filed a case in Alipore court, alleging that the students had beaten them when they attempted to ?peacefully? shift the agitators whose condition had deteriorated, to a nearby hospital, in an ambulance.

 Following the incident, the Fetsu leaders and the university authorities had resolved their differences. 

 The agitating students said the police are now victimising them over an issue that is dead and buried.

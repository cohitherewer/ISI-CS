The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fog havoc in chill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dense fog played havoc with flights and train services in the city on Thursday, even as the minimum temperature dipped and Calcuttans felt the winter chill once again.

 Met officials said the low-pressure area that had developed over south Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa, accompanied by an upper air circulation, had cleared on Wednesday. The system had sucked in warm moisture-laden air from the Bay of Bengal, blocking the North Wind. 

 The incursion of moisture had led to unseasonal rains and a cloud cover over the city on Monday night and Tuesday. 

 But, from Wednesday, the system began to dissipate and the sky cleared. ?The North Wind has again started blowing unhindered and the city recorded a minimum temperature of 13.6 degrees Celsius,? an official said. 

 The fog, officials said, was created by a mixture of the warm moist air left behind by the system and the cold air rushing in from the north.

 ?For the same reason, a haze hung in the atmosphere that prevented the sun from shining bright enough. So, the maximum temperature, too, could not rise higher than it did,? an official said. 

 The maximum temperature on Thursday was pegged at 23.8 degrees, four degrees below normal.

 More than a dozen trains were held up at various stations on Thursday morning, and the first flight left the city only at 10 am, because of the fog. Hoping to catch their flight on time, passengers, who had booked their seats on the 6 am Indian Airlines flight to Delhi, reached the airport an hour in advance, only to be disappointed. 

 ?Some of them were anxious to know when the flight would eventually leave, but there was nothing we could do but tell them that it has been postponed by at least three-and-a-half hours,? said an Indian Airlines spokesman.

 Several long-distance trains from north India, as well as north Bengal, reached hours behind schedule because of the dense fog. ?There was dense fog from midnight in the Howrah, Sealdah, Malda and Asansol divisions of Eastern Railway,? said an official. 

 Local trains, too, were delayed by 30 minutes on an average in the morning.

 Tussle over tour rights

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 A tussle has erupted between two state government departments over the right to invade the tourism turf.

 Central to the row is a decision by Subhas Chakraborty?s transport department to organise package tours in and around the city. The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) will strive to earn much-needed revenue by conducting the tours.

 ?We don?t know what has provoked the transport minister to do this,? said a source close to Dinesh Dakua, who heads the tourism department.

 He continued: ?Organising such tours is the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation?s job. The CSTC will have to make good its losses by utilising its own resources. It should not invade someone else?s turf.?

 On Tuesday, CSTC officials said the tourism department?s objection did not matter, because there was no formal bar on state departments diversifying into related areas.

 ?We transport people. Tourism is a logical extension of our operations,? they said, pointing out that Chakraborty is a former tourism minister.

 CSTC managing director Ashok Bhattacharya felt ?there is little scope of making a profit by plying buses alone?.

 ?We are in the process of organising regular package tours to more destinations. We will announce the packages and the schedules shortly,?? he added.

 The transport minister asserted: ?We have to be self-dependent as the government will no longer provide subsidies.?

 The CSTC move comes at a time when the government has started to restructure the five state-run transport corporations by downsizing the staff strength. 

 The CSTC will start the package tours from October. Vehicles have already been procured for the purpose and the destinations decided, the managing director said.

 The inaugural package will consist of Kamarpukur, Joyrambati, Antpur and Radhanagar. The tour will start from Esplanade at 7 am and end at 9 pm. 

 The CSTC has also organised Puja parikrama in the city from October 9 to 12. There will be two conducted tours ? Jadavpur-Bagbazar-Jadavpur and Bagbazar-Jadavpur-Bagbazar. 

 Five non-airconditioned buses will be used for the tours, to cost Rs 150 per head.

 Those who prefer to travel on their own during the Puja can avail of the CSTC?s season tickets. A season ticket for the festival days will cost Rs 75.

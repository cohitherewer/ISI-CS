Egging on Easter bunnies

With Easter comes spring ? a time to welcome back 

the tulips and daffodils, a time for new dresses, a time to celebrate life, a 

time for chocolate bunnies, marshmallow chicks, and multi-coloured eggs. As Easter 

weekend beckons, Goodlife takes a trek down fun munch lane.

Rabbit rage

The Easter bunny has its origin in pre-Christian fertility 

lore. The hare and rabbit were considered to be the most fertile animals, serving 

as symbols of abundant new life in the spring season as legendary producers of 

Easter eggs. 

?Of all the symbols associated with Easter, the egg 

is the most identifiable. The custom and tradition of using eggs have been associated 

with Easter for centuries. The exchange of eggs in spring symbolised happiness 

and growth,? said a spokesperson of the Hyatt.

With the festive spirit of colours, eggs are often 

stained with various vegetable dyes. Among the Syrians and Greeks, the eggs are 

crimson in honour of the blood of Christ, while in Austria artists fasten ferns 

and tiny plants around the eggs. The Poles and Ukrainians decorate eggs with plain 

colours or simple designs (Krasanki), while in Germany and other parts of central 

Europe, the eggs are not broken but pierced with a needle on both ends, and used 

for games.

?Here, it?s all about celebrating a change of season 

?one where the use of pastel colours on the eggs comes to the fore. We can experiment 

with various fun elements in our creations and, of course, sales soar too (though 

less than Christmas),? says Kookie Jar proprietor Lovey Burman.

Recipe by Lovey Burman

Chocolate Truffle Eggs in Crispy Nests

 Ingredients for 8 nests with 24 eggs: 150 g chocolate, broken into pieces, 

2 cups corn flakes, 115 g icing sugar, 3 tbsp double cream, hundreds and thousands 

of sugar sprinkles

 Method: 

 Crispy Nests: Place a sheet of greaseproof paper on a baking sheet and 

set aside. Fill a small pan one-third with water and place over low heat till 

the water simmers. Put half the chocolate into the bowl, place over the pan of 

water and allow it to melt. Crush the corn flakes into the bowl and stir with 

a large metal spoon until coated. Put heaped teaspoons of the mixture on to the 

baking sheet. Using the back of the spoon, lightly press the middle of the mixture 

to make a slight hollow for the eggs to sit in. Repeat this with the rest of the 

mixture to make eight nests. Chill them in the fridge while you make the Truffle 

Eggs.

 Truffle Eggs: Put the remaining chocolate in a clean heatproof bowl 

and place over a pan of simmering water. Allow the chocolate to melt. Remove the 

bowl from the water and leave the chocolate to cool for 10 minutes. Sift the icing 

sugar into a large glass bowl. Pour the cool melted chocolate over the sugar icing 

and add the cream. Using an electric blender, beat until well-blended. Cover with 

plastic film and chill for 20 minutes. Dust your hands with icing sugar and roll 

the truffle mixture into 24 small balls (the mixture is sticky so keep dusting 

your hands with icing sugar and return the mixture to the fridge to chill if it 

becomes too soft). To shape the balls into eggs, roll each one between your fingers, 

making one end more pointed than the other. Pour loads of sugar sprinkles on to 

a plate and roll the eggs in them. 

 Arrange three eggs in each nest.

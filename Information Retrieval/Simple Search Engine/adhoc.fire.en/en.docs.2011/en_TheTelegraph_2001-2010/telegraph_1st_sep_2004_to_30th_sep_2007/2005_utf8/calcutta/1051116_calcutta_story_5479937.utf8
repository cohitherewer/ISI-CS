The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 A few days ago, a sergeant on duty near Writers? Buildings 

 stopped the Parnashree-Howrah minibus I was travelling in 

 on a narrow stretch of Brabourne Road. The driver was at 

 fault as he had slowed down to pick up a passenger where 

 he was not supposed to. For a full five minutes, while the 

 cop was writing a chalan of Rs 100, the traffic slowed 

 down as the bus was partly blocking the road. The driver 

 had committed the offence of slowing down at the wrong spot, 

 but wasn?t the sergeant guilty of a bigger offence by making 

 the bus halt on such a busy stretch? This is not an isolated 

 incident. The sergeant could have followed the bus to a 

 wider stretch or noted down the licence number of the vehicle 

 and sent a notice to the owner by registered post, asking 

 him to deposit the fine with the traffic police within 15 

 days, failing which the licence would be cancelled.

 Earlier this month, I took a local train from Sealdah main 

 station in the afternoon. I reached the station at 3.30 

 pm but found long queues in front of all the ticket booking 

 counters. It took me almost 40 minutes to buy the ticket 

 and in the process, I missed about three trains to my destination. 

 This, despite the fact that I had the exact fare at hand. 

 While I was awaiting my turn at the counter, I found that 

 vendors and porters were breaching the queue at their sweet 

 will and walking away with tickets. I feel the railways 

 should come up with special counters for passengers who 

 are willing to tender the exact fare. Also, automatic ticket-vending 

 machines would be of great help to regular travellers. I 

 hope the authorities take note of my suggestions.

 Saving lives after death

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 He saved two lives, in death.

 In the first-ever cadaver transplant in eastern India, two persons in urgent need of kidneys were saved from death, thanks to the noble wish of a family which wanted to keep alive a dead member.

 When Aloke Roy (name changed on request) fell from a bus near Shyambazar on his way home on April 5, little did anyone realise that the subsequent chain of events would change the city?s medical history.

 It was around 2 pm, when Roy was wheeled into Apollo Gleneagles Hospital with serious neurological damage. 

 ?By 7.30 pm, he slipped into a coma. We did whatever we could, including an emergency surgery, but he could not be revived,? said intensive care specialist Suresh Ramasubban.

 Roy?s brother Bishwajit and sister Gouri were informed that he was ?brain dead?, that he could never be brought back to life and that putting him on life support would only prolong the functioning of his organs.

 Late on April 7, Lakshminarayan, head of the nephrology department, got an unexpected call about a possible cadaver transplant.

 ?I was told that the family had, quite surprisingly, agreed to hand over Roy to the hospital for possible transplants. It was a rare gesture. The two actually wanted to immortalise their dead brother,? said Lakshminarayan.

 Since it was very late in the evening, Lakshminarayan and his team of doctors scheduled the transplant for the next day. From a pool of six patients awaiting kidney transplants, the two who did not have donors from their families were selected.

 ?We conducted a series of tests, including that of HIV, before we finally agreed to operate the body,? said Lakshminarayan.

 Around 6 pm, the left kidney was transplanted into a 57-year-old patient and the right kidney into a 30-year-old. Both recipients were male. 

 After a quick post-mortem, Roy?s body was handed over to his family.

 On Friday, the patients who received the kidneys were hale and hearty, but were not told about the donor?s identity, as required by law.

 ?Gouri and Bishwajit are yet to come to terms with the death of their brother, but are happy in a way, after having succeeded in keeping their brother?s memory alive. They have decided to stay away from all attention,? Lakshminarayan added.

 Happy is the doctor, too. He has succeeded in performing a cadaver transplant in the city after 10 years of struggle.

 ?About four years ago, we had come very close to doing a cadaver transplant at Westbank Hospital, but legal issues came in the way and the plan had to be shelved,? he signed off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Standstill in fuel bill cry

 OUR BUREAU

 Wheels will come to a halt on Monday by the statewide transport strike, called by Citu-backed West Bengal Road Transport Workers? Federation to protest the rise in petrol and diesel prices.

 Private and state buses, trams, taxis, autorickshaws and rickshaws will remain off the road. School buses, too, are not likely to pick up students.

 The ruling Left Front has decided to support the strike with all its might. Throughout Sunday, the leaders were busy mobilising public opinion in favour of the ?chakka jam?.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had earlier said: ?This is a spontaneous protest. If you ask me about the problems commuters may face, all I can say is that if any one wants to work on Monday, let him/her walk to office.?

 Transport operators are shrugging off all direct responsibilities for the ordeal the city is sure to face. ?As drivers and conductors are not expected to report for work? we don?t think there will be any vehicles on the streets,? Swarnakamal Saha, of Bengal Bus Syndicate, said on Sunday. Most transport operators concurred.

 Taxi operators plan to ply around 5,000 vehicles. ?But if Citu attacks any of our cars, we will promptly withdraw all,? said Madan Mitra, of the Progressive Taximen?s Union. 

 Trains, including the Metro Railway, are scheduled to run, but since the sector has a considerable Citu presence, officials wonder whether operations will be smooth.

 Emergency services ? hospitals, milk, newspapers, fire brigade, etc ? have been kept outside the purview of the strike. Mrityunjoy Mukherjee, superintendent of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, said: ?We will focus on the emergency departments, labour rooms and operating theatres.? Though the civic body and Writers? Buildings will be open, attendance is likely to be very thin.

 Hopping on to the protest bandwagon, 

 the Trinamul Congress announced a mahamichhil on 

 Wednesday against the price hike. The day before, the Left 

 Front will hold a rally on Rani Rashmoni Road.

 From one centre to 25 in a year, 2,600 students and a new company launching operations. The abacus revolution has kicked off in Calcutta. 

 Malaysian company Universal Concept Mental Arithmetic System (UCMAS) launched its city operations in April 2004 with just one centre. Now, it has 25 across the city, from Burrabazar to Ballygunge. Plans are to expand it beyond the borders of Calcutta to all of Bengal in the next one year.

 In April 2005, another Malaysian company, SIP (Sociable, Intellectual Progressive) Academy, set up base in Calcutta, with licensed centres in areas like Salt Lake, Paikpara, Kidderpore and Bhowanipore. 

 SIP licensees Ranajit Chowdhury and wife Varsha are currently operating from Success Academy in Pretoria Street and Kisalaya Montessori in Loudon Street, with 25 students. Their expansion plans include starting classes in Nopany Vidyalaya by July, as well as adding batches to the two existing centres.

 ?There have been a lot of inquiries in the two months since we set up. There is huge interest. Not as much as in south India, where abacus is almost like a religion, with around 75 per cent of students learning the skill, but it?s catching on in Calcutta,? says Chowdhury.

 Abacus, an ancient Chinese number calculating tool, is used to teach children mathematics. But it?s not just about numbers. ?The parents are happiest about the improvement in concentration, visual skills and memory,? says Sharmila Sengupta, a licensee of SIP in Behala. ?It was a little slow to catch on in Calcutta, but people are realising the potential of the abacus. I?m going to increase the number of students soon.?

 The course is for around two-and-a-half years, for children from about six to 14, in eight or 10 levels. There are some differences between the two Malaysian academies, but the basic principles and course structure are similar. 

 Surekha Mimani, who started one of the first centres under UCMAS last year in New Alipore, now has 200 students. After one year, the future looks bright, considering the response from students and parents, she says. 

 ?We?re going to start a state-level abacus competition in the next two months. The winner will be sponsored for the national round. Those winners will then be taken for the international tournament in Malaysia,? says N. Anand, head of West Bengal operations, UCMAS. ?Last year, the national competition entered the Limca Book of Records with 11,000 students participating.?

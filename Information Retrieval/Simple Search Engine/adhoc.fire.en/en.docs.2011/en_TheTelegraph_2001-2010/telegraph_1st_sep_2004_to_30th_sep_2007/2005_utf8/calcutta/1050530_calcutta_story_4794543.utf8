The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without?

 Stocking up on designer candles

 Discount the grim situation of grimy hot evenings. When you are stranded in the dark, courtesy a power cut, which is making its way back to the city after a brief hiatus, spread a smile around by lighting a designer candle, preferably of the aromatic kind. Pad up your terrace with summery goodies, call in your friends and youd be loathe to move indoors when the lights come back.

 Developing water- saving habits

 The monsoons are at least 10 days behind schedule and have just hit the Andamans now. The alerts on for draught situation, so develop some eco-friendly habits in anticipation. Much as you are tempted to take another shower as soon as you finish taking one, youd do well to acclimatise yourself with ice-cold sponges instead. Before you wrinkle your nose at the thought, think dry taps and parched tanks ? a not-so-distant possibility.

 Learning how to scuba dive

 Dont envy the fish, join them. Enrol for a scuba diving course at Subhash Sarovar and then head further off to plunge into the ethereal waterworlds of Goa or Phuket or even the Andamans to hibernate through the season. Surface only when they promise snow.

 Ringing in some romance

 Angelina and Brad are out, but lovebirds should take heart from the smitten Katie-Cruise story to let the heat stay, humidity notwithstanding. If you follow the celeb example, coy hand-holding behind bushes is passe. Cuddle and kiss in broad daylight, even invite a few shutterbugs to your party? As pre-release publicity, anything ? or just about ? goes.

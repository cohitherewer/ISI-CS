Where each person is a small society

 An image by Stefan Moses on display at the exhibition

 Portraits of people are his passion, in a sense, but there?s nothing ordinary about the work that Stefan Moses does. The photographer has captured the course of history in Germany through the camera lens, catching his subjects in unexpected moods. Street cleaners and newspaper sellers, actors and artists, politicians and academics ? it?s a chronicle of post-war Germany represented by its people.

 Inaugurated on Wednesday by Erhard Zander, consul-general of the Federal Republic of Germany, Deutsche Vita, presented by Max Mueller Bhavan and Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, will be on view till May 11 at Seagull. 

 Moses?s leitmotif was a quote by German poet Novalis of the Romantic genre: ?Each person is a small society.? That is his trademark ? revealing the many and unexpected facets of ordinary and extraordinary people.

 Born in 1928 in what is now Poland, Moses took his first photograph at age eight, with his father?s plate camera. Forced to leave school in 1943 because he was a Jew, the 15-year-old turned to photography, working as an assistant to a photographer. A year in a labour camp from 1944-45 didn?t deter him, and he returned to his passion after the war, initially doing theatre photography in Poland.

 It was in the 1950s that Moses found fame, as he emigrated to Germany and toured around the world, to New York and through Europe, South America and Asia. While working as a photojournalist in the 1960s for German publications, he found his favourite subject ? Germans. The results of his long-term projects are now travelling around the world as the Deutsche Vita exhibition.

 The uniqueness of the award-winning photographer?s images is that they?ve been set up, and yet, the expressions and reactions of his central subjects are entirely natural. Even the posed-for pictures seem authentic. 

 For instance, there is a collection of group portraits where the background is a white cloth, with the people placed in front of it. This throws them into sharp prominence, removing all other surrounding distractions. The groups ? street cleaners, gymnasts, etc ? are arranged in front of the camera. But each individual seems completely at ease.

 The Self In The Mirror series is singularly unusual for it?s theme. Moses placed people in front of a mirror with a self-timer cord in hand, so the amused subjects could click themselves. It?s creative yet ingenuous. 

 The Great Elders of The Forest and Artists Make Masks are two collections that are fantastical and real, absurd and enticing at the same time. Distinguished elders standing in the forest, in front of trees as weathered with age and wisdom as themselves, artists disguising themselves with self-made masks, presenting another side to the mosaic that is the human psyche.

 There?s nothing conventional about the photographs. Each image is a slice of life, but larger than life itself.

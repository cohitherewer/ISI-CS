 Virtual games and combat mode

 - Traditional toys take a beating, but computer sport turns tots aggressive

 Trivial Pursuit vs True Crime. Business vs Brute Force. Monopoly vs Menace.

 Sounds like serious business, but it?s almost a no-contest. For the winner ? computer games, of course ? takes it all.

 And the beating traditional toys are taking at the hands of the tech and the trendy seems to be mirrored by the behaviour patterns of the players ? aged below 12, but aggressive as hell.

 A survey conducted by Funskool, the largest manufacturer and importer of toys in India, shows how children high on a diet of virtual games are affected physically and mentally. The most common symptoms: the kids turn unsocial and aggressive.

 ?In the past decade or so, the toy market has been revolutionised by virtual games. Kids have been spoilt for choice and even parents feel proud of the fact that their children are with it. Though the computer has many other uses, youngsters mostly utilise it for gaming,? says David Daniel Selvaraj, marketing manager, Funskool (India) Limited.

 ?Very few parents realise the adverse effects these games can have on the impressionable minds of their kids,? he adds.

 Sweaty palms, raised voices and rushing adrenaline ? seven-year-old Angshuman taking on eight-year-old Amit in a virtual war game. At stake is peer pride.

 They are fast becoming the rule, not the exception, kids who love their Tomb Raiders and swear by their Soldier of Fortune.

 And the sales of software explain the surge. ?The sales of computer games have far outstripped that of conventional games,? says Gautam Jatia, Landmark chief executive officer. ?The gaming technology is changing constantly and there?s a new game every month. If I sell 10 CD-ROMs a day, I might only sell one conventional game.?

 A prime casualty is patience. ?While playing the game, if children come across even the slightest problem, they press the re-start button. While games like chess and monopoly also involve competition, it inculcates in children patience, imagination and creativity,? feels Selvaraj. 

 Take the case of Arjun Rawla. All too often, he gets into combat mode with younger brother Anil. ?He picks up the stunts from computer games,? rues mother Sheila.

 ?My daughter has become aggressive after she got hooked on to the games. She also tends to talk louder at times and sweats and pants on reaching a critical stage in a game,? says Rachna Banerjee, mother of eight-year old Piyali Banerjee.

 Being lost in the world of virtual gaming also means that kids can shut themselves out, unlike chess or ludo or carrom. A spin-off: lack of sporting spirit and reclusive behaviour.

 ?Kids start thinking that so much of violence and bloodshed are the order of the day,? says child psychiatrist Rima Mukherji. ?Virtual gaming is addictive because it?s all about visuals and one hardly requires imagination.?

 But, according to some why blame computer games alone. ?There is violence everywhere, so why single out virtual gaming. Moreover, kids can distinguish good from bad,? says Milestone Interactive Software Limited?s eastern region head, Arnab Banerjee. 

 An obvious prescription is parental guidance on what type of games should be played. ?Like in every other thing, gaming also requires parental guidance,? says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword.

 Try explaining that to 10-year Sanjeev, who spends every spare moment practising his hand at Raw and dreaming of the day he can beat the living daylights out of 12-year-old Kunal.

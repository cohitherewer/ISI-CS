The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Water mains block sewers

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Why does it take so long for water to recede in Calcutta after a smart shower?

 A special task force, formed after the six-day (October 18-23) post-Puja deluge to study the problem of waterlogging, has found out that waterlines have blocked the drainage system under important roads in the city proper.

 Water mains have blocked all sewers running under the connecting roads of CR Avenue, Bidhan Sarani and Camac Street. The other affected areas are around Camac Street, Madan Mohan Burman Street and Gokhale Road.

 ?We have prepared a package of Rs 15 crore to repair the faults pointed out by the task force. But before taking action, we will review the report with experts from the CMDA, irrigation department and other agencies,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. The report was submitted to him on Monday.

 The task force ? headed by director-general (civil) Uday Shankar Sengupta and special officer, traffic infrastructure development, Swapan Datta Gupta ? was appointed following criticisms that the drainage system collapsed under the load of just 380 mm rainfall over six days.

 Apart from water mains, the report has blamed the designs of the pumping stations at Hrishikesh Park and on Southern Avenue; siphons at Kalighat, Belgachhia and Kalighat pumping stations; silt in the sewers and in the sumps at the 20 pumping stations for the clogged sewers.

 The report points out that the Hrishikesh Park station, set up in 1998 to prevent waterlogging in the Thanthania area, has actually aggravated the problem. There is a similar complaint about the Southern Avenue station.

 As for the silt, a civic engineer said that if the entire deposit ? over 10,000 truckloads ? was to be scooped out and dumped in Citizens? Park, the 10-acre space would rise three feet above the road level.

 Silver chapter in spring soiree

It is a fragrance of a special kind that permeates one of the perennial events in Calcutta?s melodic calendar. Gulab Bari, all set to complete 25 years of its existence, readies itself for another round of song, dance, music on March 5 at the Neotia residence at Queen?s Park.

 While Calcutta does not lack in music conferences and recitals by top-notch names in the classical music and dance arena, there is something about the whole concept of Gulab Bari which makes it a rose-inlaid sustainable tradition. The spirit and the rendering have remained embedded in the very hues of its early conception. And very little else has changed, except for the larger audiences, who await the advent of spring through the chaiti strains at Gulab Bari. 

 From the mid-80s, when I was invited by Bimla Poddar through an elegant card, where the personal salutation was always penned in her own hand, the event has always created a frisson of excitement in the anticipation of how the weather would be, what the performers would have on offer, and of course how consistent the food would be. 

 Possibly no single private soiree has such charismatic innuendos as this one, where a magnificent multi-tiered garden is the venue. Since there are no confines of space, the seating gets spread out, in front of the performers, on the higher grassy verges, in the gazebo and in the open verandahs of the bungalows.

 Before I recount the music, the food is an item that needs to be highlighted, only because it has remained constant, and even more significant, simple. The Benarasi menu consists of puri, khasta kachori, aloo-kumra sabzi, tamatar ki longi, panchmela sabzi, dahivaras, papad and boondi. Served also with earthenware simplicity in a round setting that enables people to do a maypole turn without any major queues. Tea and thandai are passed around from the beginning. 

 Why or how did it all start anyway? Talking to Suresh Neotia we gather that it all happened quite by accident. It was an incidental meeting with Girija Devi on a flight when Neotia introduced himself to her. Around the same time, Murari Lal Kedia, a celebrated personality in the field of art, music and literature and a good friend of his, took him to a function in the month of Chaitra. It turned out to be no other than a Gulab Bari, which was an offering to Radha and Krishna with chaiti roses through music and dance and rose petals being showered on the guests and artistes. There was, imaginably, a huge participation from the audience. The Gulab Bari tradition turned out to be more than a century old, and was just one of the many festivities like Varsha Mangal and Kartik Utsav observed with splendour in Varanasi. 

 Varanasi, the seat of learning for 2,500 years, has had music intricately woven into its psyche and the basic character of this city is that both life and death are taken as a festival, muses Neotia, as death is ?conquered and inevitable too and accepted without much grief?.

 Having culled the essence of Gulab Bari from such a city, and seeing that it was becoming extinct like so many other festivals because of a paucity of patronage, Neotia placed before Girija Devi, when she visited them in Queen?s Park, the whole idea of replicating this at home. Bimla Poddar was at that time developing her own interest in music and the arrival of Girija Devi enthralled her and she became her disciple. 

 The general consensus was that Gulab Bari would be held in the garden, and 1980 saw the first one with an audience of a less than a couple of hundred people. Girija Devi took the stage and rendered Chaiti and Holi. Chetna Jalan, who was a well-known dancer and a friend of the family, was invited to perform a Kathak number. 

 By the next year, the audiences had grown and Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra possibly took the stage for the first time at their place along with Girija Devi, to give a holistic recital.

 Those were the days of baskets of roses coming all the way by train from Varanasi and Ghazipur-desi roses that stunned all those present with their heady fragrance. The children of the family would carry the baskets of rose petals and shower them on guests and artistes, and everyone would, additionally, get a sprinkling of rose water. 

 From 1983, the whole function took a much larger shape and they started having over 500 guests and invited the most eminent artistes of the country to come and perform. 

 While it is not a private affair, yet the melding with family functions has given stronger filial bonds and meaning to the event. When one of the daughters of the house, Smriti, was married, in 1984, Sanjukta Panigrahi performed at the wedding, and Harsh Neotia?s reception was crowned with the shehnai strains of Ustad Bismillah Khan. Girija Devi, of course, sang, as she has continued to sing to this day.

 Those magical evenings, generally held in early March, start up with the children of the family, usually an unmarried girl, no matter what her age, doing a ceremonial prayer. I recall a couple of occasions in the 1980s when the young Madhu Neotia, then a coy bride, and a shishya of Girija Devi, beautifully rendered a Krishna stuti as a prelude to the proceedings.

 Over the years, with growing audiences, which stand today at over 2,000, the personages on the specially-crafted stage have also grown in stature, adding to the growth and glamour of the event.

 For several years, Pandit Birju Maharaj has charmed us with his impish interactivity, taking us through all manner of innovative taals, and this year, too, he will be there with his star disciple, Saswati Sen.

 Talking to some old-timers and inveterate regulars, many recollect the percussive beats, the melodious and appropriate raags, the thrilling dance renderings and the exciting jugalbandis that have taken Gulab Bari proceedings to beyond midnight, when over the years some singular greats have performed.

 The likes of Kishori Amonkar, Zakir Hussain, Pandit Jasraj, Nishat and Imrat Khan, Bhimsen Joshi, Balmurali Krishna, Kishan Maharaj, Amjad Ali Khan, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Rathikant Mahapatra, Aditi Mangaldas, Valavika Sarukkai, Mallika Sarabhai, Padma Subramaniam.

 And the regulars recollect the performances of those who are no more in our midst, like Ustad Vilayat Khan, Sanjukta Panigrahi, V.G. Jog and Kelucharan Mohapatra. Guru Kelucharan looked so remarkably agile when we last saw him, frail though he was. 

 And so the cycle of music, of death and regeneration, and the rustle of spring will once more be heralded by notes and notables who will continue to weave their traditions into the weft of Calcutta?s musical fabric. The familiar will continue to take on fabulous overtones.

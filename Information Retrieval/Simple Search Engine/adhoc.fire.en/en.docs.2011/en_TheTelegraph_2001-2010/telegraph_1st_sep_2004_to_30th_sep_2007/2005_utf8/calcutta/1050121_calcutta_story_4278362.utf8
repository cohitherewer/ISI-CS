 Benefits of a Beijing link

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Realising the potential benefits of higher business bonding with China, local bodies have started taking initiatives ? ranging from organising visits to that country and lobbying with the state and Central government ? to put in place the necessary linkages. 

 Led by CPM parliamentarians Nikhilananda Sar and Amitava Nandi, a 13-member delegation from the South Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently toured Yunan province to take part in the second Kunming-Calcutta meeting in Kunming. 

 ?There are a lot of complementarities between the eastern and northeastern India and the southwestern part of China. A highway of 570 miles can link these two regions,? said Sar, highlighting the need for air and road connectivity.

 During the trip, the chamber signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Yunan Society for China-India Cooperation and Exchange to facilitate flow of goods and services across the borders. 

 ?Be it agriculture or manufacturing industry, both regions will gain a lot from mutual cooperation. Besides, the Chinese also want Indian expertise in training,? said Nandi. 

 The team, he added, will present a detailed report to the state government and take up the air link with the Centre.

 Set sail for your luck to turn

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Ships have always been symbols of trade and prosperity. To enhance your luck in export and import, place a model or a replica of a sailing ship in the north of your office. Ensure that the ship is sailing into your office and not out of it

Q: I am an export-import trader and want to seek your advice to enhance my wealth. I have been experiencing immense bad luck and business is also going through a downswing. I am very worried. Could you please suggest a simple and strong remedy to improve my luck and finances?

 Anjuman Shivdasani

 The solution: Ships have been symbols of trade and prosperity from ancient times. Since you are into import and export, I would recommend you place a model or replica of a sailing ship in your office.

 The north is connected with trading and communication and hence could be an ideal place for your ship. Take care and ensure that the ship is sailing into your office and not out of it. However, please see to it that it is not a model of the Titanic or any other sinking ship. 

 Dont place it at a very high level in your office.You could also place a few currency coins wrapped in silver and gold-coloured paper along with a few items in which you trade in.

 Land lowdown

 Q: I am getting a very good deal to buy a bungalow on a huge plot of land. I plan to demolish the old bungalow and construct a new one. Is it necessary for me to look into Feng Shui aspects before I buy the land or can I do so during the planning stage of the construction? What are the general guidelines I can follow? 

 Pintoo Chakravarty

 The solution: It is always advisable to check for Feng Shui friendliness of a plot of land you wish to buy. You should always look for a perfect plot.

 A plot with minor errors is still tolerated since rectifications can be made comfortably.

 The most valuable information you need is obtained by calculating the flying stars of the land, according to the exact degree it faces and the year in which the bungalow will be constructed on it. 

 This provides valuable insights on luck that this plot will bring to its occupants. Make sure that the plot is not at a dead end. 

 It should have a wide road or an empty space across the road to enjoy the benefits from the massive quantities of positive chi flowing into the house. 

 Ensure that the plot is not at a level lower than the main road. Such properties are considered to be sunken properties.

 It is also important to verify the shape of the plot. It should not be tapering towards the north-east or southwest directions. Strange shapes like cross, triangle, L, V and T should not even be considered.

 Home hassles 

 Q: We are planning to buy a bungalow in a new township. The complex has a row of identical bungalows. The ones that are available to us now are two corner bungalows, situated in the north-east and south-west corners. Could you tell us which would be more Feng Shui friendly?

 Ravi Munot

 The solution: Southwest corner bungalows are generally not recommended in Feng Shui because the eastern part of your bungalow will then be blocked by your neighbours walls.

 East is the direction of the rising sun which is the universal life force and when this gets blocked, the health and growth of the residents get severely affected.

 Hence I would suggest you buy the bungalow that is in the north-east corner. 

 Moreover, that is known as the Almightys corner that will receive direct energy flow, symbolising his blessings.

Power of words, novel amp; nice

From Grisham to Ghosh, Forsyth to Follet, Steele to 

Seth and Twain to Taylor-Bradford ? it?s an eclectic spread that adorns the racks 

of the freshly refurbished The Telegraph library at The Saturday Club.

?The library that dates back to the first quarter 

of the last century has been an integral part of the club through the years. We 

decided to revamp it and increase storage space to accommodate more books as value-addition 

for members,? says club president Vijay Burman.

The new-look library, which was inaugurated last month, 

is fully air-conditioned, with freshly-laid flooring and redone cosy reading lounge. 

The reception area has also been given a completely new look. ?Besides, we have 

procured software for data entry and will shortly introduce bar-coding of books,? 

adds club vice-president Arjun De.

A computerised catalogue will also follow, to serve 

as a ready reckoner of the racks. ?However, most importantly, we have managed 

to double the library area by adding another 970 sq ft on the mezzanine floor. 

The extra space translates into more racks and more books,? says Burman. The library 

currently houses over 1,400 tomes spread across various genres.

Every year, the club adds 600 to 700 books to its 

rack repertoire and discards some slow-moving titles. ?Being a social club, the 

emphasis is more on fiction and the majority of the borrowing is from that category,? 

says librarian Sumit Basu.

Danielle Steele is easily the favourite with the ladies, 

who generally prefer romance novels, according to Basu. Sandra Brown, Mary Higgins-Clarke 

and Barbara Taylor-Bradford come next in the pecking order. Men, on the other 

hand, plump for thrillers, with Ken Follet, Jeffrey Archer and Collin Forbes circulating 

fast.

The genre classification has been finalised by the 

club?s library committee under the guidance of library convenor Renu Roy. 

Besides fiction, there are volumes on philosophy, 

psychology and religion. Social science books have been sub-classified into political 

science, economics, law and social service.

Books on criminology, language, pure and applied sciences, 

Indian and world history also adorn the racks. ?Cookery and beautycare books are 

much in demand and we also have a decent collection of titles on arts and outdoor 

games that moves well,? says Basu.

The children?s library, ?a very popular section?, 

houses more than 1,200 books ranging from the Ladybird series to Enid Blyton to 

Satyajit Ray to classics like Charles Dickens. ?Of course, Harry Potter steals 

the show hands down!? smiles the librarian.

While the library has been the rendezvous point for 

a clutch of book-reading and adda sessions featuring the likes of Amitav Ghosh 

and Taslima Nasreen, convenor Roy is keen to carry the thread forward through 

more such initiatives like art shows, quiz contests, debates and ?a host of other 

intellectually-inclined activities?.

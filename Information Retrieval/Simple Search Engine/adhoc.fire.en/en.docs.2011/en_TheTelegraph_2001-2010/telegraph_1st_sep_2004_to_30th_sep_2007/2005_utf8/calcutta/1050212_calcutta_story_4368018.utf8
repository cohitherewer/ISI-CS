The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, man with the moustache

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Detectives of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probing the Roma Jhawar abduction case on Friday stumbled upon a new name, Muchhwala, who was allegedly present in the red Maruti Omni and played an active role in the kidnap of the 20-year-old. 

 In his early 40s, Muchhwala, who, as his name suggests, has a bushy moustache, was recruited by mastermind Arvind Bhai for the job, the sleuths said. 

 He was not in the white Omni that intercepted the Jhawar car off CA Island in Salt Lake around 8.15 am on February 4. 

 But soon after the abductors swapped the vehicle for Gunjan Ghosh?s red Maruti van, Muchhwala stepped in. He remained with the gang as it moved from Phoolbagan to Park Circus to Sodepur and, finally, to the garage on Narkeldanga Main Road. 

 Detectives believe Muchhwala has followed Arvind and slipped into Bihar, without collecting the ransom. 

 A reconstruction of the events suggests that Gunjan and driver Vikas did not step out of the car while Roma was pulled out of her car at gunpoint. The two sat inside, while Arvind Bhai, Kallu, Pappu and Munna caught hold of her. 

 By this time, Roma?s friend Sabari Mitra had stepped out of the Jhawars? Indica. 

 ?She thought the gang was trying to hijack the car. It was much later, after Roma was spirited away, that she came out of her daze,? police said. 

 Vikas drove the car up to Phoolbagan, where the vehicle was changed from white Maruti Omni to red. Gunjan drove the red Maruti.

 Before the abduction, Arvind Bhai had stayed for a while at KB-KC block, sleuths said.

 Security beefed up 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An alert has been sounded across the city and the state following the militant attack in Ayodhya. 

 ?We condemn this incident. I have spoken to the home secretary and a statewide alert has been issued. We?re taking security measures at all levels. The law-and-order situation in other states appears to be normal,? said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings on Tuesday evening.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said vigil had been stepped up at all vital installations in the state.

 ?Apart from the city, we are keeping an eye on sensitive areas and border districts, like Murshidabad, Nadia, Malda and North Dinajpur. A watch is also being kept on religious and fundamentalist groups,? he added. 

 Roy spoke to city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee on beefing up security in the city.

 According to additional director-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee, patrolling parties, and, if necessary, pickets will be put up at trouble-prone spots. The state intelligence machinery has kept under surveillance pockets in North and South 24-Parganas and Asansol, he added.

 Immediately after receiving instructions from Writers? Buildings, a high-level meeting, headed by Prasun Mukherjee, was held at the Lalbazar police headquarters. 

 ?We have alerted all the divisional deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and officers-in-charge of all the police stations,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Elaborating on the measures, Sharma said: ?Officers have been asked to keep a special watch on all places of worship. Vigil will be intensified in pockets of mixed population. The Heavy Radio Flying Squad and Radio Flying Squad have been alerted.?

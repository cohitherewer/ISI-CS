The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Your logical thought process can find a solution to any problem. If you want something, you?ll go any length to get it. Although your views can be quite extraordinary, you can convince others with ease. Left on your own, you produce brilliant results. You are extremely witty, although you do not say all that you think. Family and friends will never waste an opportunity to be around you. ? Kusum Bhandari

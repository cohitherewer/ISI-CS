The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor?s dream tower in line of fire

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s dream to construct the city?s tallest building has triggered a wave of protest from members of his own council, who claim he has taken the decision unilaterally.

 The members allege that the proposed 50-storeyed residential-cum-commercial property, to be built on the EM Bypass at Rs 400 crore-plus, had not been discussed in the mayoral council or the civic House.

 The mayor, however, doesn?t see any irregularity. When contacted in Greece, he told Metro: ?My concepts, my dreams and my ideas need not to be ratified by the mayor-in-council or the civic house till I start translating them into action.? 

 The proposed complex has been planned on a 13-acre plot, of which 10 acres belong to the civic body. 

 When Mamata Banerjee was coal minister in the NDA government, the civic body had pledged the 10-acre plot to Coal India for constructing a hospital. The proposal was ratified by the mayor-in-council and the civic house.

 But the handover never took place, and the mayor, subsequently, decided to launch his dream project on the 10-acre plot and an adjoining plot of three acres.

 The mayoral council members up in arms against mayor Mukherjee on the issue include Anup Chatterjee, Swapan Samaddar, Javed Ahmed Khan and Sovan Chatterjee. 

 ?The mayor should have discussed the matter with Mamatadi before taking a decision,? said Anup Chatterjee. ?He told me that he had discussed the matter with her. But when I asked didi, she said she had not been informed.? 

 Samaddar said: ?One fine morning, the proposal will land in my department and I will have to clear it.?

 Sovan Chatterjee felt that before launching the project, the mayoral council should formally revoke the earlier decision of allotting the plot to Coal India.

 According to the mayor, the matter will be placed before the council only after the civic body decides to go ahead with the project. ?It will not be implemented unless the members okay it.?

 For now, a team of civic officials and engineers, led by municipal commissioner Debashis Som, is scrutinising the ?concept proposals received from interested parties?.

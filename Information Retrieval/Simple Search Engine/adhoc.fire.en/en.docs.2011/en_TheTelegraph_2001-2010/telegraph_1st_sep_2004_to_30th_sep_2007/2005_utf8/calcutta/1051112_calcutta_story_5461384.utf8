The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Golf glory amp; movie magic

 - Giant-screen fairway premiere for fourth Harry Potter film edition

 SUBHRO SAHA AMP; PRATIM D. GUPTA

 A still from Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire

 The golfing greens, not a bookstore. Popcorn buckets, not page marks. Two hours and 38 minutes, not 734 pages.

 After being swept away by the sixth book, brace for the craze of the fourth Harry Potter movie. Come November 18, a record number of screens in Calcutta ? for a Hollywood release, that is ? will be turned into the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

 If the rest of the city can queue up with the rest of the Potter-mad world for the same-day-same-date release of Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, a select group of 1,000 will be lucky enough to catch all the action the evening before. For, the Calcutta premiere takes place on November 17 at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).

 A giant screen (16ft-by-20ft) will come alive at 7 pm to death, danger and the blossoming of teenage love. 

 The audience can loll on the lawns with rugs and blankets, sip on mocktails and cocktails, and munch on finger food while feasting on Pottermania, as golfing glory merges with movie magic.

 The first fairway will be the scene of the larger-than-life Warner Brothers action as golf?s oldest home outside the British Isles swings into celluloid mode again, following last season?s success of the drive-in screenings. ?This is a huge honour for us and we are sure the audience will have a whale of a time, since this is a most unique venue to enjoy a movie,? says M.M. Singh, CEO of the club.

 There will be burgers from KFC, pizzas from Fire ?n? Ice, popcorn picks, ice-creams from Kwality Walls and, of course, the signature kathi rolls from RCGC?s own kitchen at arm?s length. ?Our endeavour has been to reposition the Royal as a family destination and the Potter premiere adds steam to that thrust,? Singh observes.

 Premiere done, The Goblet of Fire will rage through Bengal with 12 prints, and not limited to plush multiplexes. ?The film will be released at standalone halls not only in Calcutta but in Barrackpore, Khardah and Burdwan,? said Kushagra Jalan, the film?s Bengal distributor. The dubbed Hindi version will also be released next Friday.

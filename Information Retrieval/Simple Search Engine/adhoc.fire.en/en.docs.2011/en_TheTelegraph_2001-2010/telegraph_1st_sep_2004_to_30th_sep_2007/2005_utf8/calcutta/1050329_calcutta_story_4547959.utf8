The Calcutta chapter of Sindhar Institute of Gemology, a city-based gem and jewellery institute, hosted its graduating show last week. The afternoon affair displayed the creativity and practical knowledge of jewellery design students of the 2005 batch.

 From the traditional Devdas collection to an abstract range titled Constellation, a variety of moods were captured. ?The students are allowed to let their thoughts flow. What has been showcased today is the material outcome of their training and innovation,? explains Punit Srimal, president of the institute.

 The students were quite inventive in the collections, both precious and imitation, using wacky features like feathers and fabric to create bold and colourful accessories.

 The courses at the institute equip the students with both design skills and practical knowhow like how to become an entrepreneur in the field of jewellery. ?The best thing about jewellery is that one can pick up this skill at any age and make a future of it,? signs off Srimal.

 Ethnic effect

 Finesse, a decade-old sari boutique on New Road, Alipore, is calling traditional dressers in the mood to splurge. Exclusive woven saris and antique-look Benarasis are the highlights of the spring-summer collection.

 ?Heavy saris ranging from the traditional zari-bordered pieces to party wear worked with stones and those woven and embroidered are special attractions of the new range,? says owner Sujata Nevatia.

 The two-day exhibition kicks off on March 29 with outfits created by young designers. 

 ?We?ve always tried to create a platform for young talent,? adds Sujata. Prices begin at Rs 700.

 Floral fills

 It is an apparel brand born in the city that has got plans to go beyond. But first, tune into the latest offering at First Impression or FI, at Forum and City Centre.

 The spring-summer collection is laden with stitched and unstitched kurtis, kurtas and salwar suits for women.

 Bright colours and floral prints are the two basic ingredients of the range that covers daily wear and party clothes in cotton, crepe, and georgette. A range of ponchos with metal embellishments on the neckline deserves special mention.

 ?The cotton pieces will be the hot sellers this season,? says Vikash Goenka of FI. Created by their team of in-house designers, sequins, patchwork, embroidery and stones jazz up the garments. 

 Priced Rs 800 onwards, there is a discount of up to 50 per cent now, making it worth at least a look.

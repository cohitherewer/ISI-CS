 Dwijendranath, Swarnakumari Devi, Abanindranath, Rabindranath? you name them and they are there. Some in their rare writings, others in their unpublished articles and manuscripts.

 That, in short, is how Baitanik plans to capture Thakurbari in its latest endeavour to set up a museum, which will offer a rare peek into the minds of almost all members of Bengal?s most revered family, the Tagores.

 To be set up on the first floor of Soumendranath Tagore?s house on Elgin Road, the museum will boast collections that had never been brought out of the family?s closet. 

 And the icing on the cake, as it were, will be some rare writings and manuscripts of Soumendranath ? the grandson of Rabindranath?s eldest brother Dwijendranath. 

 Among them is Sadharan Sottobadi Ishtahar, the first ever Bengali translation of Karl Marx?s Communist Manifesto.

 ?Not many are aware of the translation, done in 1920s. This is a classic document. That apart, there will be several other documents and papers, including those of Swarnakumari Devi, Rabindranath?s sister,? says Amit Das of Baitanik, a music school set up by Soumendranath himself.

 One of the writings of Swarnakumari, to be displayed in the museum, speaks of the necessity of translating major works of the West for the women of Bengal. 

 ?This was at a time when Bengal was being swept by the ideals of Renaissance, ushered in by Rammohun Roy and Iswarchandra Vidyasagar,? said a member of Baitanik.

 The museum ? to be set up in a room once illegally taken over by an outsider, who had clamped a nameplate of minister of state for transport Sushanta Ghosh on the door ? will also display Rabindranath?s writings on Ramakrishna Paramahansa.

 There will also be the manuscripts of Soviet Russia and Soviet Republic ? the two books that Soumendranath had sent to India through Rabindranath, when he went to the USSR. Soumendranath was then under detention in connection with the Munich Controversy.

 Visitors will also have a glimpse of Abanindranath?s rare paintings and a book on Bengali shorthand by Dwijendranath Tagore. 

 ?We plan to start from one room of this historic house and then gradually spread out. We are now putting the pieces together and the museum should be ready by September-end,? said Das.

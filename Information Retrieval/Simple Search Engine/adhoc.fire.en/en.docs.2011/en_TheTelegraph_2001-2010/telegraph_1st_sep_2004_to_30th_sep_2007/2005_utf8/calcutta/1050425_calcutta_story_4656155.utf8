 Calcutta will soon be home to the country?s first rooftop tennis academy and Indian ace Mahesh Bhupathi will call the shots. The clinic will come up on the top level of the six-storey mall, The Axis, in Rajarhat New Town, developed by Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company, a joint-sector unit with the West Bengal Housing Board.

 Spread over 4.75 acres with a built-up area of five lakh square feet, the mall will be located less than a kilometre from the six-lane bridge connecting Salt Lake and New Town. Apart from the academy, it will have a four-screen cineplex, food court, swimming pool, automobile showroom, entertainment corners and service apartments.

 ?I plan to run the academy once the project is complete. I will come now and then to provide guidance to the youngsters,? Mahesh Bhupathi, also the brand ambassador of Bengal Peerless, told Metro on Sunday.

 The Bengal Peerless move to rope in Bhupathi is seen as a response to a joint initiative of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and housing minister Goutam Deb to try and market housing stocks created by joint-sector companies, mainly to the NRI audience.

 ?The foundation stone will be laid on May 8 and the mall will be completed by 2008,? said K.S. Bagchi, Bengal Peerless managing director. Funds for the Rs 250-crore project will be raised by selling 1.5 lakh sq ft as retail space, through lease rentals and from internal resources.

 The Axis will comprise three blocks and park 800 cars. Block A will have jewellery and watches, telecom and automobile showrooms. ?We are in talks with German telecom fair giant CeBIT for setting up a telecom and IT expo arena,? Bagchi said. Block B will house the rooftop tennis academy, the cineplex, food court, branded retail, a sports complex and a children?s corner, while Block C will have service apartments, banquet halls and a swimming pool. 

 ?The Axis will be designed in the European renaissance style,? explained architect Hiren Chowdhury of Pace Consultants, executing the project based on theme design by UK-based consultants Avery.

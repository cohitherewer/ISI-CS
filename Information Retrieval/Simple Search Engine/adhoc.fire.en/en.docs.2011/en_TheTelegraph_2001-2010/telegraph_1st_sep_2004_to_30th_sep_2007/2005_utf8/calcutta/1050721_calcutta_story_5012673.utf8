 Scheme to widen tax net

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 

 To bring nearly 400,000 unassessed properties under the tax net, mayor Bikash Bhattacharya is planning to allow the owners to assess the levy on their houses and flats themselves.

 The properties will have to be listed in the civic records to avail of the facility.

 ?I have begun to sound out the state government in this regard,? Bhattacharya said on Wednesday. ?It is important to widen the tax net. The owners of unassessed properties must realise that the situation cannot continue.?

 The mayor elaborated: ?A system would shortly be evolved which will allow owners of unassessed houses and flats to determine the tax on their properties according to a per-sq-ft rate to be announced by the civic authorities.?

 The rate is likely to be lower than the prevailing property tax rate, said sources in the civic body. 

 For new flats, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation currently calculates annual valuation at the rate of Rs 13.20 per sq ft.

 ?I think it is imperative to bring down the rate to bring more property-owners under the tax net. And I see nothing wrong in it, because we have already waived the interest and penalty under two schemes for a section of house-owners,? stated the mayor. 

 According to the civic assessment department, a huge number of buildings and flats in the city have remained unassessed over the past 25 years due to political considerations.

 ?In 1993, we tried to assess buildings in the colony areas, but the venture had to abandoned after an assessment inspector was kept confined by residents of a colony in Jadavpur,? said director-general (civil) Uday Shankar Sengupta.

 The civic revenue department reckons that the earnings of the CMC would go up by at least Rs 125 crore if 70 per cent of the targeted property-owners respond favourably to the planned initiative.

 ?The figure will be higher than what the CMC would get by starting a new waiver of interest scheme,? said a civic official.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a wildlife enthusiast, creates photo ops as he celebrates Wildlife Week every year. 

 Last year, Bhattacharjee celebrated the occasion by making a bonfire of tiger pelts, elephant tusks, and leopard and snake skins ? trophies made from endangered animals under the Wildlife Act.

 This year, on October 30, Bhattacharjee will set free hundreds of colourful birds, natives of Calcutta and surrounding areas, but endangered species all the same.

 ?The chief minister will release hundreds of birds which we have seized in raids on bird-sellers all over the city. It will be an apt gesture on the inauguration of Wildlife Week,? said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief conservator (wildlife). 

 The programme this year will be held at Narendrapur wildlife sanctuary, formerly Kalayer Bagan, on the southern fringes of the city, which Bhattacharjee will declare open. 

 ?The sanctuary has been renamed Chintamoni Kar Abhay Aranya (wildlife sanctuary) and a notification to the effect has been issued. In doing so, the government is acknowledging the noted sculpture?s contribution in the campaign to accord sanctuary status to the orchard,? said a forest department official.

 ?Kar played a pivotal role in the public campaign for the orchard. Unfortunately, the government could acquire the land only a few days after he passed away,? he added.

 Bhattacharjee?s government recently bought the 17.82-acre orchard from Promod Das and others, paying Rs 3 crore in settlement.

 Preparations are on to give finishing touches to the sanctuary before the big day on October 30.

 The 4,000-ft boundary of the sanctuary is being fenced and bamboo benches with thatch roofs are being built inside for visitors to sit on. The forest department is laying 8,000-ft-long nature trails criss-crossing the park for ramblers.

 ?We?re using wire mesh fencing in front and chain link fencing on the sides. On the canal side at the rear, we?ll use barbed wire fencing to discourage intrusion,? said Somnath Mukherjee, officiating as divisional forest officer (South 24-Parganas). 

 The department plans to set up a deer enclave on an abandoned football grounds inside the orchard.

 ?It will be turned into a glade and four to five deer will be released. We also plan to release some turtles and alligators in the big waterbody inside the sanctuary. Once Baruipur and Sonarpur are developed industrially, the sanctuary will be the lungs of the area,? said another forest department official.

 Though the new sanctuary will be open to public, visitors will have to seek permission from the Alipore office of divisional forest officer (DFO), South 24-Parganas.

 Entry will be free for now, but those wanting to take photographs will be charged a fee. 

 Despite being declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1982, disputes over land compensation continued to dog the orchard. 

 The sprawling orchard, with its thick canopy of trees and dense undergrowth, has been a haunt of birds and animals. A total of 112 avian species have been spotted in Narendrapur, besides jackals, jungle cats, civets, mongoose and monitor lizards.

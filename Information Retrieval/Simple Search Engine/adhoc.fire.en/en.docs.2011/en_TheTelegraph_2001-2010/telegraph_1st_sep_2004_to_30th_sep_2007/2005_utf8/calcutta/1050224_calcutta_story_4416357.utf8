RESHMI SENGUPTA

 When you see her, you think of a laugh riot. Be it a Parsi girl working on her English in Zabaan Sambhalke or Amisha Patel?s bubbly friend in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, Tanaaz Currim can get the audience to crack up. 

 Yet, unlike most actors, the comedian tag is not something she is worried of, as she believes making people laugh is the most difficult thing to do. ?Initially you think that no one takes you seriously, but slowly you realise that comedy is not everybody?s cup of tea,? says Tanaaz, hours before taking over The Park banquet with Two to Tango.

 Comprising four single-acts, Two to Tango is a hilarious take on man-woman relationships. Produced by Rael Padamsee and directed by Vikranth Pawar, the play also features Vinay Jain, Dilnaz Irani and Digvijay Savant.

 ?Two to Tango is the kind of play where you can bring in anybody and not feel embarrassed. We have performed it in restaurants and hotels in Mumbai and Bangalore and had an amazing response. My dad enjoyed it a lot, too,? says Tanaaz. 

 It was while studying commerce in college that adman Bharat Dabholkar spotted Tanaaz in a Rael Padamsee production, Mischief Mania. Two weeks later, Dabholkar offered her the lead in his production Bottoms Up, which fetched Tanaaz critical acclaim and some much-needed exposure in the theatre circuit.

 ?With Bottoms Up, I found I was so good at comedy,? says Tanaaz, who now has to cut down on theatre for more work on the small and big screens. ?I started doing theatre when I was in Class VII. And in all these years, I have always done main roles,? she smiles.

 When it comes to balancing stage, TV and films, Tanaaz just sticks to the best offer. ?There?s no priority... I bring in a lot of variation in all my roles, in the way I talk or through my body language,? she adds. 

 Though it?s English theatre that Tanaaz is more seen in, her personal favourite is the Hindi production Bhago, Hansa Phir Ayee. ?There are six different and contrasting characters, in terms of age and look, in this play. I play Meena Kumari, Phoolan Devi, a male folk dancer, twins called Pallavi and Parvati (the black and white characters in the STAR Plus sitcom Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani), a schoolteacher and a housewife. I asked myself whether I would be able to pull off all six characters and I could at the end,? says Tanaaz, waiting to take the play abroad.

 But right now, she is gearing up to hit the floors with as many as four films from March. ?One of the roles is just funny, another is a mix of funny and the vampish. The third is serious and the fourth normal,? explains Tanaaz, now seen in serials like Yeh Meri Life Hai and Dono Mila Ke Dus.

 Doing a bit of this and that seems to suit her fine. ?There are so many actors in Mumbai and even the top ones are finding it difficult to carve a niche for themselves in films,? explains Tanaaz.

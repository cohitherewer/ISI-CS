 Flat-owners flummoxed

 - Steep hike in property tax burden without intimation

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city?s civic authorities appear to have increased the property tax burden on owners of recorded flats without any intimation.

 Cases have come to light from early this year, in which apartment-owners were forced to shell out extra amounts as tax. The flat-owners who had approached the assessment department with last year?s bills were reportedly advised to be ready to pay a supplementary bill of arrears.

 Over 300,000 flat-owners not covered by the cooperative housing society Act or the apartment ownership Act have been hit the hardest by the levy hike. There are instances of such an increase being effected during general revaluation of the property tax of a flat or building at an interval of six years.

 ?This is not proper. A section of flat-owners should not be victimised just because there is a legal provision,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 A few hundred thousand apartments, most of them in colony and slum lands, and nearly 200,000 houses in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, continue to remain unassessed for property tax for over 20 years due to political considerations.

 Calcutta High Court had earlier ruled against an exorbitant hike in property tax in a particular case and directed Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to conduct a reassessment. 

 After the CMC refused to reassess the tax following the court directive, the owner of the flat, on Prince Anwar Shah Road, filed a contempt petition against the civic body. 

 The Trinamul Congress has decided to protest the issue before the civic board on August 3.

 According to officers of the assessment department, property tax can be between 11 per cent and 40 per cent of annual valuation. A house-owner or flat-owner has to cough up 40 per cent of the annual valuation if the sum touches the Rs-18,000 mark.

 ?We have produced several tax bills before the civic assessment department where the annual valuation of the flat has been pegged at between Rs 5,000 and Rs 7,000, but 40 per cent of the amount has been charged as property tax,? said Amar Mitra, president of All Calcutta House Owners? Association Amar Mitra.

 Deputy municipal commissioner (revenue) Nandan Roy said the higher rate could have been charged as the annual valuation of all the flats in a building had crossed Rs 18,000.

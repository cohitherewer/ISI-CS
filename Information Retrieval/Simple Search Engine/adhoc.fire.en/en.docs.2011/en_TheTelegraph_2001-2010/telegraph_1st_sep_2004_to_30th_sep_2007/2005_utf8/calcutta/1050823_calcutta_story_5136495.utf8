The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Back in post he never held

 - Row over Re-employment of in-absentia teacher

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A teacher of polymer science at Calcutta University has not taken a single class in the past 12 years because of illness. Yet, he had been paid his salary every month and before retirement, the authorities had extended his service.

 The move has triggered resentment among teachers and students, as the extension is in violation of rules. Both students and teachers have threatened to take up the matter with the state higher education department.

 The circular on the extension of service was sent to the polymer science department on Saturday evening.

 According to government rules, a state university can re-employ a teacher after he reaches the retirement age of 60 only if he fulfils certain criteria during the service period.

 The two most important of them are that the teacher has taken classes regularly and he has made significant contributions to the subject.

 ?We are shocked at the way the university has re-employed the teacher,? said an aggrieved colleague. ?We feel sorry for him, as he has been ill for a long time. But there is no reason why the university should re-employ him, a privilege reserved for those who have an outstanding record.?

 The teachers have also demanded an inquiry into the expert committee?s recommendation on granting re-employment to the teacher.

 What has perturbed the teachers the most is that the decision comes at a time when most universities, as well as the government, are considering ending the practice of re-employing retired staff members to make way for fresh recruits.

 Dean of science faculty P.K. Das Poddar said he was not aware of the resentment among teachers and students. He, however, promised to look into the matter, though he refused to divulge any information about the teacher?s illness.

 Expressing concern over the decision, a student said: ?We don?t even know what the teacher looks like, as he has not taken any class. We only saw his name in the class routine. How could the authorities re-employ him, when they know very well that topics allotted to him will either never be taught or will have to be taught by someone else??

 Rules state that before re-employing a teacher, the university should appoint a committee of experts, which will probe the teacher?s record to ascertain whether he deserves an extension of service.

 The extension can be a maximum of five years. During that period, the teacher will draw the same salary that he drew just before retirement.

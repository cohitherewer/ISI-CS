 Court sends rights panel back to girls? home 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the West Bengal Human Rights Commission to visit Liluah Rescue Home and file a report on the alleged mismanagement by the authorities of the home for destitute.

 This is the second time since 2000 that the high court has asked the Commission to visit the home and file a report on it. In its previous report, the rights panel had stated that the home authority had failed to provide adequate security to the inmates.

 A division bench, comprising acting Chief Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutta, passed the order on Friday on a public interest litigation (PIL) by advocate Tapas Kumar Bhanja, who had accused the home employees of trafficking in girls.

 Bhanja, in his petition, also alleged that some of the inmates had conceived during their stay at the home. ?The authority, despite knowledge of the fact, didn?t take any action,? the lawyer complained.

 ?The government has done nothing to implement rights panel?s proposals, submitted in 2000,? Bhanja told the court.

 ?A number of girls have fled the home. Some of the employees of the home are helping the inmates to flee,? Bhanja alleged. 

 The court asked the Commission to verify whether the home authority was acting in accordance with the Juvenile Justice Act, 2001.

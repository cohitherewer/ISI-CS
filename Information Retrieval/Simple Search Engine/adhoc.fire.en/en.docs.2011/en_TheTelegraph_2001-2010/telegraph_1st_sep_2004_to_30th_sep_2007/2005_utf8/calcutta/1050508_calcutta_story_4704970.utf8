The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The bright amp; the black

 From the colour Black to the darkness of Nishijapon. The party people stripped off their veneer or an artist?s struggle to come to terms with his wife?s body. There?s no faulting Bollywood or Tollywood on the variety score this year. But what about the hits, the misses and the talking points to date? Here?s a breeze through? 

 Rani Mukherjee and Amitabh Bachchan in Black

 Bollywood

 Black

 Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee

 Director: Sanjay Leela Bhansali

 Storyline: A fitting tribute to the spirit of Hellen Keller, the film revolves around the unique relationship between a blind-deaf-mute girl and her never-say-die teacher.

 Released on: February 4

 City run: In week 13

 Rated: Great opening, hit in the metros after positive worth-of-mouth publicity

 Plus point: Bachchan and Rani act out a human drama with a difference. ?Black was quite an extraordinary experience. (For Sanjay) To make Black after the colourful and grand Devdas is a great departure. That?s a sign of a genius,? says Amitabh Bachchan.

 Cast: Konkona Sen Sharma, Boman Irani, Atul Kulkarni

 Director: Madhur Bhandarkar 

 Storyline: A peek into the high-flying party life of Mumbai through the eyes of a journalist.

 Released on: January 21

 City run: Nine weeks

 Rated: Average opening, surprise pick-up and hit in metros, average elsewhere

 Zeher

 Cast: Emraan Hashmi, Shamita Shetty, Udita Goswami

 Director: Mohit Suri

 Storyline: A broken marriage in the first few reels, an extra-marital relationship in the next few, and a gripping thriller from there on.

 Released on: March 25

 City run: Six weeks

 Rated: Slow opening, hit in the metros, average elsewhere

 Plus point: The Bhatt formula of making small-budget (Rs 3-4 crore) thrillers. ?The director and producer used the sex thing to create hype around the film, to make the audiences come to the halls. They always knew, once the audiences came to the theatres, they would love the film,? says Udita Goswami.

 Salman Khan and Sneha Ullal in Lucky

 Lucky ? No Time For Love

 Cast: Salman Khan, Sneha Ullal, Mithun Chakraborty

 Director: Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru

 Storyline: A fairytale set in the pristine locations of Russia, where a schoolgirl and an older man fall in love while on the run.

 City run: In week five

 Rated: Fabulous opening, semi-hit in the metros, good elsewhere

 Plus point: Salman Khan still rocks at the box-office, especially with Ash II for company. ?Lucky is a love story with a fable quality,? say Rao and Sapru.

 Priyanka Chopra and Akshay Kumar in Waqt

 Waqt ? The Race Against Time

 Plus point: Families are booking tickets in bulk to laugh in the first half and cry in the second. ?It is an honest film about emotions. We are real. The relationships are real? Everybody who loves someone fears losing him or her,? says Akshay Kumar.

 Juhi Chawla and Sanjay Suri in My Brother... Nikhil

 Not to forget

 A throwback to the turbulent times of the Sixties through three different mindscapes make Sudhir Mishra?s Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi one of the best films to come out from India in recent times, while the honesty of My Brother? Nikhil tosses up a fresh perspective to the persistent problem named AIDS.

 Tollywood

 The first four months have been a downer for Tollywood. Of the dozen releases, the mythical potboiler Devi is reportedly doing brisk business in the suburbs. But tinsel town, as we know it, is still waiting for its first hit of the year. Here?s focusing on the five most talked-about films that have sailed through this tepid season.

 Koushik Sen and Churni Ganguly in Shunyo e Bukey

 Shunyo e Bukey

 Cast: Koushik Sen, Churni Ganguly, Tota Roy Chowdhury

 Director: Kaushik Ganguly

 Released on: April 15

 Run: Fourth week at Nandan and the two INOXes. 

 Rated: Above average, say the serpentine queues at Nandan

 Plus point: Pre-release hype coupled with a controversial subject is pulling in the college crowds. ?Nandan is doing daily business of around Rs 75,000. On weekends, it is touching Rs 85,000. Talks are on with Mumbai-based Shringar Films for a nationwide release,? says Kaushik Ganguly.

 Nishijapon

 Released on: April 15

 Run: Fourth week at Priya and the multiplexes

 Rated: Average, faring better than Shunyo e Bukey at the two INOXes

 Minus point: Something?s missing, say some. The drama isn?t taut, say others. ?Not all films can be a Bombaiyer Bombete,? counters Sandip Ray. ?It has been a dream production but I am not satisfied with the distribution. Publicity has really been very low.?

 Koel Mullick and Jeet

 Manik

 Cast: Jeet, Koel Mullick, Ranjit Mullick

 Released on: April 15

 Run: Fourth week in the city and its outskirts

 Rated: Above average, expected to have a steady run

 Plus point: Much of the charm in Probhat Roy?s comeback film after three years comes from the rustic hero adapting to the ways of the world. Plus, the proven screen chemistry of Jeet and Koel. ?I have packed in everything a family would want to watch together ? comedy, emotion and drama,? says Roy.

 Cheeta

 Cast: Mithun Chakraborty, Rambha

 Director: T.L.V. Prasad

 Storyline: Mithun romances damsel-in-distress Rambha in between kicks and punches

 Released on: January 14

 Run: More than three months in the city and suburbs

 Rated: Above average

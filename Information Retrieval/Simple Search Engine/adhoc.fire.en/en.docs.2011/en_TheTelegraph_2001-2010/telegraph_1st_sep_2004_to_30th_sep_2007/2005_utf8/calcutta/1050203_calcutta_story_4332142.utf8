The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

She is only 18-years old, but 132 on the WTA rankings. 

Meet the current toast of India, Sania Mirza. The story goes that she was only 

six years old when she turned up for her first tennis lessons. The coaches thought 

she was way too young for serious lessons. Then they saw her hit the ball, and 

realised that she was not any six-year-old with a fancy racquet in her hands. 

Sania has come a long way since those early days in Hyderabad but she certainly 

has many streets to cross before she can be counted close to the Sharapovas and 

the Williamses. Here?s wishing her all the very best!

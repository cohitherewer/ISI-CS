From boo to shiver

 Naomi Watts: In the ring

The horror movie will not go away. Look at the change 

in the Hollywood landscape as a signifier of its durability. At one point it was 

just one of many styles of films called ?product? that between, say, 1930 and 

1970, the movie city ground out like sausages or hula hoops at a rate of four 

or five a week. They were called ?genre pictures?, and they usually lasted no 

longer than a week at the bottom end of the then-popular exhibition strategy called 

the double feature. 

 Then the genres went away. The business changed, the audience changed, the theories changed, the marketing departments changed, everything changed. ?New? movies ?hipper, faster, mixer of genres ? ruled the roost. Except for the horror movie. 

 The Amityville Horror, a remake of the 1979 horror hit that spawned a series, will arrive soon. It retells the story of the family massacre that shocked Long Island and part of greater Queens in 1974, inspiring a bestseller as well as the movie. 

 One big horror movie, The Ring Two, has already opened in the US, as well as some lesser mutts like the disappointing Cursed and Boogeyman. Then there?s a big-budgeter with Keanu Reeves and computer-driven FX to die for, Constantine. 

 And it continues. Coming up are Man-Thing, Cold and Dark, French import High Tension, remakes of House of Wax and The Fog, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Land of the Dead, Hatchet, Saw 2, The Vampires Vs Werewolf sequel Underworld: Evolution and, finally, some kind of prequel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 

 The existence of horror as a theme in literature certainly suggests that stories which inspired fear were a staple of the imagination long before boys and girls sat next to each other in darkened auditoriums, waiting for the scary parts and a chance to cuddle without moral meaning.

 The first horror movies took their cue from the prose of Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker, as well as their stately, 19th-century progress toward resolution. James Whale?s Frankenstein and Tod Browning?s Dracula (both 1931) were elegant documents. Both also established the aesthetic of the horror movie, which would play out over the next 30 or so years. These movies relied on the imagination as the most potent tool of fear induction. There was no tradition of viscera, no acknowledgement of the anatomical secrets that lay within the body?s vault. All that would come later.

stuff

Probably the high point of the horror movie as implicit harbinger of fear was Val Lewton?s Cat People (1942). The makers relied on insinuation for a sense of menace, evoking fear without showing the unshowable. The next big thing in horror was foreign ? the influence of the gaudy, brilliant films from Hammer Studios in the late 50s and 60s, with such long-faced actors as Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, on classical Dracula-Frankenstein themes like The Brides of Dracula and The Curse of Frankenstein. The movies seemed to inspire another schlockmeister, Roger Corman, to go into the horror biz. Corman?s most fondly remembered works included 1964?s The Masque of Red Death and 1963?s The Raven.

 It all changed with a movie called Halloween the 13th on Elm Street. The slasher film was a subset of the more elegant horror movie, but like bad money driving out good, it all but killed the horror movie. Its banal literalism took the imagination out of fear and replaced it with smaller, less intellectual meanings. 

 Today, though, the slasher film is largely dead. It was killed not by parental and critical scorn but by market saturation. The Scream films and Scary Movie 1, 2 and 3 marked the genre?s last stand. 

 Now, once again, there?s been a mutation. We seem to be in what might be called a new period of internationalisation. The zone of influence seems to be Asian, specifically Japanese. Both The Ring and The Grudge, the relatively refined, star-driven flick released last year, began in Japan and they brought a new sensibility to the horrors. 

 Unlike the slashers, the Japanese or Japanese-influenced films don?t specialise in gore, but in menace, almost like the great days of the 30s. They also in some way are postmodernist ? they turn on and incorporate new media. The Ring, for example, is based around an urban legend of an outlaw videotape so full of powerful, demonic imagery that even to see it is to doom yourself in seven days. 

 In both cases, the logic is quite iffy, the details sketchy, the cause-effect baffling. But the movies return from the boo to the shiver. The Japanese films insist on a more generalised, almost primordial fear. Though death is at the end of it, the actual mechanism isn?t invasion of body by blade, but invasion of mind by ghost. 

 The Grudge illustrates this best. It?s set in a house where a man killed his family in a rage and the rage seems to still hover in the air, pictured as a kind of inky cloud out of which springs now and then the image of the murdered child. 

 Keanu Reeves: Nothing?s constant

In fact, the most financially successful horror movie ever made, though apparently not influenced by the Japanese, shares the artistic principles of postmodernism. That?s The Blair Witch Project, which again plays with media and the very unreliability of the media (the camera is always looking in the wrong position or is shaky or out of focus) intensifies the emotions of the ritual of stalk and implied slaughter gigantically. 

 The new Amityville Horror doesn?t look like that kind of movie, but more a retro re-creation, as does House of Wax. It just shows that in horror, it?s still possible to scare the old way and therefore get the boys off the bench and into the game.

Apropos Dinabandhu Mukherjee?s letter ?Govt to blame 

for immersion of green sense?, October 20, why just blame the state for the immersion 

mess? What about the common people who hold the pujas? 

 Mukherjee has lamented the pollution of waterbodies in Gujarat due to the immersion of Ganesh idols. But he is strangely silent about the pollution of the Hooghly due to immersion of Durga idols. 

 The stretch of the river, from Babughat to Strand Road, is dotted with the kathamo of idols every year after Puja immersions. Here, too, the water is polluted by the chemicals used for decorating the idols. Unfortunately, no NGO has ever measured the increase in the pollution level following immersion. 

 The remnants of the innumerable pandals erected all over the city are also not disposed of properly. The discarded material is dumped on the roadside. The broken-down structures remain there for months or get crushed under the wheels of trucks and buses. The leftovers of pandals sometimes block roads and are a source of pollution. Why aren?t the organisers asked to remove or destroy the waste after the Puja? 

 Even the companies that confer awards on Puja committees which adhere to fire safety norms and pandal rules do not attach weightage to post-Puja pollution. The patrons of the pujas and the media also cannot care less.

Jadavpur University?s move making it mandatory for undergraduate students to participate in research is laudable (?Research for undergrads?, October 21). The initiative will definitely enhance the institution?s status. 

 Opportunity of research from the undergraduate level will prepare the students for the rigours of higher education and put them on a par with their counterparts in the West. Involvement in academic activities will keep them away from the path of meaningless agitations. 

 The university?s decision to improve the libraries, laboratories and hostels is also praiseworthy. The students often resort to protest against lack of facilities. If grievances on this count are addressed, it will ensure peace on campus. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

Apropos ?End road menace, thunders Buddha?, October 19, it is heartening that the chief minister has at long last realised that several lives can be saved if the drivers of private buses are reined in. The buses often race with each other with terrible consequences. A passenger?s arm was torn off recently during one such fatal race. 

 It is a matter of anguish that our transport minister continues to patronise the private bus operators and auto operators knowing fully well that they violate traffic regulations at will.

Apropos ?Climber remains in coma?, October 19, it is extremely unfortunate that Anita Sarkar had to suffer due to the negligence of the civic authorities. 

 Once an accident occurs, there?s invariably a lot of talk about what should and should not have been done. Even then, it is difficult to digest the promise by an officer of Lake police station to take stock of the situation and inform his superiors about the condition of Rashbehari Avenue. Was he sleeping all this while or was he waiting for something drastic to happen? 

 People in power often survey the scene of a calamity and promise help. But has anyone ever heard or read of a victim who has benefited significantly from administrative help?

Apropos ?Lost in Puja crowd surge?, October 15, pickpocketing and suffocation are two obvious dangers of being in a crowd. It?s unfortunate that festivals have to be enjoyed in this manner. Better crowd management is urgently needed. 

S.S. Almal,

Lower Rawdon Street.

The Puja offers us an opportunity to escape our humdrum life, whether we go pandal-hopping amidst all the crowd and the noise or curl up at home with a good novel (The Other Puja, October 16). It?s the time to enjoy and recharge our batteries. There?s something on offer for everyone ? gorgeous pandals and idols, discotheques, dandiyas, holidays or even movies. 

Arjun Chaudhuri,

Bhowanipore.

Apropos ?Get set to run, marathon man?, October 19, Bimal Mahato?s achievements will delight sports lovers. It is no mean feat for a man from a humble background to participate in the New York marathon. It is wonderful that he has been able to overcome the shock of his father?s death. Kudos for highlighting his struggle. I wish Mahato all success. 

B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum Park.

Apropos ?Who will take care of my special child??, October 18, the Indian ?welfare? state is not bothered at all about the care of children with disabilities. The NGOs that have mushroomed for the benefit of special children are, in reality, exploiting gullible parents and sympathetic patrons. It is amazing how the government continues to play the ostrich. 

 With no support system in place, the parents have to worry constantly about their children?s future. The rehabilitation council of India does not do much except accord recognition to special education courses. 

Jatindra Nath Bhowmick,

Kalyani. 

Apropos ?Railway shrugs off rehab onus?, October 20, the only way the stand-off over eviction of settlers can be resolved is by agreeing to rehabilitation. A joint rehabilitation package for the settlers by the Centre, state and the railways is the pragmatic solution. Unless this is done, the stalemate will continue and other projects by the railway will be delayed and eventually, derailed. 

Govinda Bakshi,

Budge Budge. 

The article ?Big gains for brand Bengal?, November 10, carried photographs of two hotels that were mentioned as Intercontinental properties in Delhi and Mumbai. Both pictures are of hotels belonging to the Taj Group of Hotels ? Taj Palace Hotel, New Delhi, and The Taj Mahal Palace and Towers, Mumbai.

Public relations manager, Taj Bengal. 

The article ?Security shield for Eden match? on 

November 10 mentioned that the India-South Africa ODI at Eden Gardens is on November 

26. The match is on November 25.

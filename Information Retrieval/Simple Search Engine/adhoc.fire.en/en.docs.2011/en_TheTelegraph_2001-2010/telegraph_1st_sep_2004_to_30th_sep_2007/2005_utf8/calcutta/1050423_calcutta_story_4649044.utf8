 A few thousand commuters were stranded at various Metro stations on Friday morning as services remained suspended for over an hour because of a technical problem.

 According to Metro Railway officials, the tie rod in the Up TD 41 broke around 11.08 am, when the train was approaching Central station. 

 All passengers were evacuated at the station. The train left for the Noapara car shed for repairs around 11.24 am.

 Services had to be suspended as the train, moving very slowly, took more than an hour to reach the car shed. Two trains were cancelled and nine rescheduled.

 ?After the rod broke, the train lost speed and was travelling in jerks and starts. Running it with passengers on board could have resulted in a more serious breakdown,? said a Metro Railway spokesman. 

 Tempers ran high among the passengers as the authorities announced the suspension of services over the public address system. 

 The service for Dum Dum resumed around 12.10 pm, while that for Tollygunge at 12.07 pm.

 Risk assessment

 The men who stormed Akshardham temple (Gujarat) after it was taken over by militants and scripted one of the biggest rescue operations in the country, have now set their eyes on Calcutta?s underground.

 In what appears to be a complex training schedule, a team of 124 from the National Security Guards (NSG) will arrive in the city to take part in a crisis management course in the Metro Railway. The purpose: to prepare the country?s best-trained commandos for an emergency intervention in the tunnel. 

 The five-day session starts on April 24. On April 29, NSG director-general A.N. Mitra will be present to assess what the exercise has achieved.

 ?Our commandos will go through a familiarisation process, as handling a crisis underground is not easy,? Satwavir Yadav, inspector-general (operations) told Metro over the phone from Manesar, in Haryana.

 The operation ? to take place late at night, when men armed with latest-make rifles will invade the tunnel ? has been divided into two parts. 

 First, the commandos will be asked to get a feel of the entire 16.45-km route, across 17 stations, and then identify the sensitive or vulnerable points.

 In the second part, they will be presented with a crisis-like situation, which they have to tackle successfully ? that is, without causing any injury. 

 The commandos will have to submit a report on the way the entire operation has been coordinated. The report will be analysed by the NSG brass and the loopholes, if any, will be highlighted.

 The detailed schedule has been kept a secret. ?We have received an intimation about the arrival of NSG commandos. Our role is restricted to providing logistic support,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Ranveer Kumar.

 Tradition touch to tote trend

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 If you?ve been carrying a mismatched leather bag to weddings and ethnic evening dos while flaunting outfits in shiny silks with sequins, it?s probably time you went on a tote trail. Made entirely of brocades, silks, velvets, with a touch of fur and canvas, the variety of bags to hit malls and roadside stalls goes perfectly with formal Indian wear. And it is all the rage this wedding season. 

Sporting a patchwork look with a mish mash of fabrics 

and a variety of embellishments like sequins, leather, embroidery, stones and 

even buttons, these are a funky match for casual and western wear as well. The 

look can be described as bohemian yet traditional (picture by Rashbehari Das).

 While neon sequins, imaginative appliqu?s and loose shapes lend the bags a hippie touch, the use of a lot of shine and shimmer makes them ideal to go with the elegance of saris and other ethnic wear.

 What

Ethnic totes, pooches 

and jholas

 Where

Megha Modi, BE: and Mams 

at Forum, New Market, and 

roadside stalls at Esplanade

 How much

Rs 100 to Rs 3,000

Mostly rectangular and square in shape, the bags are slightly rounded on the edge that gives way to a sling, usually in similar tones.

 Other varieties, however, are just to be carried on the arm without a sling and are aptly called pooches. Most of the bags are fitted with buttons, but some also come with zippers and fancy tie-ups.

 Apart from the glitz and glamour, the bags also score over their leather counterparts in terms of maintenance. Most of these can be simply hand-washed, but if you opt for those with velvet and fur trimmings, it?s best to get them dry-cleaned. 

 The designer efforts in this category are a little steep as opposed to the not-so-classy copies at roadside stalls. The latter, however, is a good enough option for college kids to accessorise their frayed denims and rebellious T-shirts with. 

 And, of course, there?s nothing to beat the do-it-yourself spirit if you want to take matters in your hands before swinging them on your shoulders, in style.

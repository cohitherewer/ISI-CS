 Fruity flavours in wax

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 A host of fruity flavours can now sit pretty on your dining table, whether or not all of them are the seasons produce. Gel candles stuffed with artificial fruits can lend colour to your dining space or kitchen, and even come in handy for an occasional candle-lit dinner.

 Big jars of translucent wax contain shapes of red and green apples, watermelons, sweet lime and even coffee beans. The artificial fruits look as good as real, with the shapes and colours being fairly authentic.

 While candles with petals floating in the wax are quite common now, a newer variety has artificial flowers entwined on the outer surface of the curvaceous glass containers, while the wax inside looks crystal clear.

Another variety comprises small petal-rimmed jars with clear wax inside.

 The candles pick more from nature than just fruits and flowers. Ocean theme candles capture sand, starfish motifs and seashells in coloured or translucent wax.

 The candles in vibrant splashes of red, pink, lemon, green and soothing hues of lilac and blue come in glass containers of various shapes. Small and medium round glasses, small shot glasses, long glass jars and champagne glasses house the medley of sea motifs.

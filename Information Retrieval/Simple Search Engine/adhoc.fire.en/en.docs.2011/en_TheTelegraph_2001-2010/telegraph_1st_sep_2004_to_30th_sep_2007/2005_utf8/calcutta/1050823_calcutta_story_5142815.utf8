 Buy Indian identity for Rs 5,000

 KINSUK BASU

 Want a voter?s identity card? Forget the Election Commission of India. For Rs 5,000, you can have one home-delivered.

 After fake passports and duplicate marksheets, police have stumbled upon a racket in producing fake voter?s identity (ID) cards. 

 While the target customer is the infiltrator from across the Bangladesh border, investigations so far suggest that the offer is open to anybody willing to buy an Indian identity. 

 All the racketeers do is replace the photograph already on a genuine card with the image of the person who wants to buy a new identity. 

 The name and the address remain the same. The only giveaway is the laminated card. While the original is hard and thick, the fake ones are thinner and softer. 

 The revelation comes following hours of interrogation of two Bangladeshi nationals, Mohammad Masum Ali Khan and Roshan Ara Begum, who were arrested on Sunday night in the Burrabazar police station area. Both 23-year-old Masum and Roshan Ara admitted having purchased Indian voter ID cards for Rs 5,000 each from racketeers who operated in parts of Uluberia, Bagnan and Sankrail, in Howrah. 

 They target the Bangladeshis, who trickle in without valid documents. 

 Masum told police that almost four years ago he, along with Roshan Ara, had bought the cards from a tout in Uluberia because he was going to Gurgaon for employment. 

 At Gurgaon, Masum wanted to join his brother Badsha Khan, while Roshan Ara was keen to meet her husband Sattar Sheikh. Both Badsha and Sattar are Bangladeshi nationals who had crossed over earlier. 

 Masum and Roshan Ara told police they had paid for the voter?s ID cards to ensure that they were not identified as Bangladeshis and pushed back during their stay in Gurgaon. In the process, Masum, of Ratuakhali, had become Samsher Ali Mullick of Uluberia. And Roshan Ara of Khulna had turned into Feroza Begum of Muslim Bazaarpara, also in Uluberia. 

 Four years after they had slipped into India, the two were now on their way back to Bangladesh when Burrabazar police nabbed them. 

 While Roshan wanted to meet her husband Sattar, who had gone back to Bangladesh, Masum was returning home to get married. 

 ?We have already started a probe based on the statements of the two,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

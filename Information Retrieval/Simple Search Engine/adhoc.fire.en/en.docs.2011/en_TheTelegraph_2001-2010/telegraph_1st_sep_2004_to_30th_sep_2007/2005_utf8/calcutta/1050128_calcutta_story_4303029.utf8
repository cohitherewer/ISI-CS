The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A slice of life

 A musical full of fun, frolic, songs, dances,and even a dash of mystery, Ensemble?s Shirir Neeche goes further than being simply a ?below the stairs? comedy. Literally dealing with people who spend a large part of their lives in spaces underneath the staircases of large houses, the play tells us the story of the maids, durwans, sweepers and gardeners; the multitude whom we call our domestic help. Ostensibly loud and boisterous in presentation, the plot is delicately woven around the lives, loves, ambitions and aspirations of its protagonists, offering a sensitive understanding of their desire to rise to higher, more respectable positions in society. Without attempting to moralise or pass judgement, the play gives a true-to-life but colourful account of the various levels of interaction and layers of undercurrent that run between those living above the stairs and below. Providing an entertaining study of the dynamics of the relationships between the haves and have-nots of society, the real theme of Shirir Neeche is, however, tolerance, which is initially reflected on a personal level but finally assumes a universal, social significance. Direction: Sohag Sen.

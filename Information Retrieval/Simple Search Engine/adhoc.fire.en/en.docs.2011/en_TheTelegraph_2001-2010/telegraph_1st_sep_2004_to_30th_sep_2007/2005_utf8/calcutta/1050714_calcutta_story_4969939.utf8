Monsoon is the time when your skin starts misbehaving. It might suddenly get oily or become very dry and dehydrated. Which makes it even more necessary than usual to take care of it during this season in order to look fresh and beautiful, says Aparna Santhanam, head of medical services, Kaya Skin Clinic.

 And in a city like Calcutta where humidity levels remain so high, eruptive skin problems are almost a certainty. Sweat and oil secretions are deposited on the skin, making it look dull and this attracts dirt and pollutants from the atmosphere more easily. This is the reason why eruptive conditions like rashes, spots and pimples are common during the monsoon, she adds.

 So, while the rain is a pleasant respite from the scorching summer sun, a special skincare regimen is the perfect prescription to enjoy this season.

 Santhanam has a series of skincare tips that are bound to keep your skin healthy and glowing all through the pitter-patter weeks of the rainy months.

 Firstly, cleansing is of utmost importance to remove grime and pollutants. Removal of make-up every day is also essential, as cosmetics can clog the pores and lead to eruptions. 

 For oily skins, a medicated cleanser, cleansing lotion or cleansing milk may be used, while facial scrubs or cleansing grains help deep cleanse the skin, making it more translucent. So after a wash, its best to rub the skin gently with a scrub.

 The second step is a solid toning regimen to tighten the pores and prevent spots and pimples. 

 Toning is a must at night. During the monsoons, a lot of air-borne and water-borne microbes are let loose. So, a good anti-bacterial toner will go a long way to prevent skin infections and eruptions, says Santhanam.

 It also helps maintain the natural moisture balance, enhancing the freshness and elasticity of the skin. 

 Step number three is moisturising. Monsoons can have a de-moisturising effect on dry skin and an over-hydrating effect on oily skin. The skin gets wet often and with the constant wetting and drying, a lot of dehydration (yes, in the rains!) takes place. That explains the itchy feeling, adds Santhanam, from her Delhi office.

 If getting wet in the rain is a constant feature in your daily schedule, using a non-water-based moisturiser is a good idea. 

 For those with dull and dry skin, the doctor suggests thorough exfoliation to keep the pores free of hardened oil and clear of dead cells.

Mangal: from Amitabh to Aamir

Back from the standing ovations in Locarno and Dublin,

of the theme, the Berlin Wall between commercial and art cinema, and the strength 

of music in Indian films

Pandey 

The final countdown is on as Aamir Khan and his Mangal 

Pandey team are not only headed for the big screens this Friday but thanks 

to The Telegraph?s Ticket to the Stars, they are coming to town this Saturday. 

And while some of you would SMS your way to the dinner table with the man of the 

moment, the rest can rise to the return of the small man on the big screen in 

the Ketan Mehta dream project. 

You have often spoken of having lived with the 

Mangal Pandey dream for years. When did you first think of making a film 

on him?

In 1987. The script was written then and the project 

was about to take off. But then it turned out to be too ambitious and too risky. 

Also, historicals as a tradition hadn?t taken off in India. At that stage I was 

planning the film with Mr Amitabh Bachchan. Then again in the mid-90s, the project 

was planned as a co-production with the UK-based Channel Four. But that too didn?t 

work out. Finally it had to wait for Aamir (Khan), Bobby (Bedi) and me to join 

hands and make it in 2005. It?s almost like a dream come true.

Has this 18-year delay helped the project?

The project has grown substantially in all these years. 

Even the script has been developed a lot. Most importantly, today there is a major 

curiosity about Indian cinema in the West. The technical gap has been bridged 

too.

From small films like Mirch Masala to this 

Rs 40-crore magnum opus? has the director in you changed?

Each film has a different kind of form and technology. 

Of course, the visualisation changes completely. The inputs change too. Many more 

people come into the fray. But the quality never suffers. In fact, the quality 

improves with the coming of much finer expertise. Here, you have the genius of 

A.R. Rahman scoring the music, the lyrics written by Javed Akhtar, who is one 

of the greatest poets of the country. For art direction you have Nitin Desai, 

who?s done films like Lagaan and Devdas. Also the costumes, the 

screenplay, the camerawork? you have some of the best talents of the country.

Your earlier forays into commercial cinema have 

not found favour at the box-office?

The media demarcation between commercial and art cinema 

is as false as the Berlin Wall. And Mangal Pandey is definitely an attempt 

to break that wall. For me, commercial films are also avant garde. Oh Darling! 

Yeh Hai India was a political satire while Aar Ya Paar was an existential 

thriller. 

I am very happy that big stars are working in films 

that have themes relevant to today. Film-makers have also become more adventurous. 

There is a churning happening in Indian cinema. Even in your Bengali cinema, you 

have Hollywood stars wanting to be part of projects of Buddhadeb Dasgupta and 

Rituparno Ghosh. It?s an exciting trend and should be encouraged.

How did it feel to get such a huge applause in 

Locarno and Durban?

The response was overwhelming. You have 8,000 people 

watching the film on a giant screen as high as four storeys and the ovation feels 

like a cloudburst. It blows you away emotionally. 

Is the international version different from the 

desi version?

The difference is only in language. We had shot the 

Hindi and English versions separately. The titles are different ? Mangal Pandey: 

The Rising in Hindi and The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey in English. 

In terms of length, the Hindi version is four or five minutes more since Hindi 

is a more elaborate language and English a tighter one.

So you haven?t done away with the naacha-gaana 

in the English version as some other Bollywood directors have done before?

I really believe that music is the strength of Indian 

cinema. The songs actually make the cinematic form so vibrant and exciting. There?s 

no need to be apologetic about it as we have been in the past. In fact, Mangal 

Pandey is inspired by musical folklore. It blends the oral tradition of the 

Orient and the written tradition of the West.

With just a few hours to go for the Indian release, 

how do you think our audiences will receive Mangal Pandey?

I am just hoping that this film reaches as many people 

as possible. It?s essentially an Indian story although the subject matter is very 

global. And the subject resonates even today. We are surrounded by similar problems 

in places like Afghanistan, Iraq and even India. So, in many ways, Mangal Pandey 

is a cautionary tale showing the results when greed is allowed a free reign. 

And that cultural sensitivities and peculiarities can lead to a crisis in basic 

civilisation.

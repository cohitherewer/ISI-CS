 He has been treating the world to mouthwatering gosht preparations for some 50 years now, but the josh has not diminished. His Urdu is so chaste that you may feel a little lost, but you just cannot miss the twinkle in his eyes.

 Meet ITC Welcomgroups grand master chef Imtiaz Qureshi, in town from August 26 to September 4 to cook up a vegetarian storm at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp;Towers.

 But why vegetarian, when he is synonymous with non-vegetarian dishes? Well, good food to people always means a spread of non-vegetarian food. But this perception is very wrong; well-cooked vegetarian food can be a gourmets delight. And I am here to do just that ? cook vegetarian fare in non-vegetarian style to suit every food lovers taste buds, but with a difference.

 The kitchen has been Qureshis kingdom right from the age of nine and ever since he has been picking up his recipes from places as diverse as the maidans of Lucknow and urban milieus.

 Once his association with the Welcomgroup began in 1976, Qureshi embarked on a five-year pilgrimage to resurrect an ancient cuisine that later became famous as Dum Pukht.

 For now, what veggie delights does the master of meats have up his sleeve for city foodies? People here are known to love and praise good food. So I have selected the menu very carefully and dished out more or less the same fare that I had arranged for Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri and several other eminent personalities back in the year 1962 in Mumbai. Although a vegetarian affair, I had given all the dishes non-vegetarian names, as Pandit Nehru was not too fond of vegetarian fare. The food went down very well and most of them mistook the vegetarian dishes to be non-vegetarian, smiles the 76-year-old through a grey handlebar moustache.

 To begin with, there is a spread of kebabs ? Shammi and Hariyali. While the Shammi Kebab is made of a mixture of raw banana paste and curd, the Hariyali is a mix of a variety of green leaves and nuts to be had with pudina and coriander chutney. Accompanying the kebabs are two varieties of bread items ? the melt-in-your-mouth Mughlai Paratha made of maida, ghee and milk, and the Virahi Roti made of chana ki dal, moong ki dal, atta, turmeric and a combination of masalas.

 Reach the main course and find Chaman Biryani with pieces of khoya thrown in. Though cooked in ghee, the biryani is not very oily and is light on the stomach. You can make out each grain of rice, says Qureshi.

 Then you have the Arbi Kalia cooked in a smooth gravy, the Awadhi Moong Dal which is green moong in cream and malai. And theres no missing the Paneer Labadar and the Gobi Anar Dum, easily two of the best items on the menu.

 The first has the paneer in a gravy of tomato and cheese and is then put on dum, while the second is cooked in much the same manner with just a change of ingredients.

 To round off a dream date with vegetarian cuisine, theres a host of desserts to choose from, exciting in both nature and nomenclature. For instance, a kulfi answers to the call of Lab-e-Mashooq.

 The festival also brings together the Double Ka Meetha from the kitchen of Hyderabad and its Lucknawi counterpart Shahi Tukda. The fusion Apple Jalebi flame is hot.

 My cuisine is an outcome of research, familial influences and inspiration through the years. It has been a long journey for me, but I dont intend to stop here, smiles Qureshi.

 The dinner buffet the grand master chef is laying out at the Eden Pavilion from 7.30 pm is priced at Rs 675-plus.

 Busy bites

 Quick bites for busy jet-setters are no longer restricted to sandwiches and coffee. One can now indulge in a lavish Thai spread prepared in a matter of minutes.

 Minute Meals, the new offering from Baan Thai, the speciality restaurant at The Oberoi Grand, offers pre-plated vegetarian and non-vegetarian menus for lunch. 

 Most people who drop in at our restaurant for lunch want to grab a quick mouthful. But Thai cuisine is very elaborate and it takes time to prepare as well as eat. However, we strive to serve it in the minimum time possible. The portions on a platter are tailor-made for one individual and hence saves time and theres no wastage of food, says The Oberoi Grands executive chef George K. George.

 The vegetarian platter comprises Baamee Nam Prik Thai (broth of noodles and seasonal vegetables), Kaeng Kiew Wan Phak (spicy green curry with vegetables, coconut milk and pea aubergines), Pakchoy Normai Farang Fai Daeng (stir-fried Pakchoy and asparagus in chilli sauce), Phad Phak Ruam Mit (stir-fried vegetables in garlic and soya sauce), Khao Plao (steamed rice) and Bamee (stir-fried egg noodles with celery and spring onion).

 Apart from the steamed rice, soup, noodles and a vegetable curry, the non-vegetarian meal includes Kaeng Kiew Wan Kai (spicy green curry with chicken, coconut milk and pea aubergines) and Pla Lard Prik (crispy fried bekti in sweet chilli sauce).

 Ngow Ice-cream Krati Sod (rambutans served with home-made coconut ice-cream) makes for the perfect sweet ending.

 Both the meals are priced at Rs 470.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

Better know your cricket from your diplomacy if a 

power lunch or a cocktail party is on the cards this weekend. And don?t forget 

to take a dig at the affairs of the royalty in not-so-far-off London?

Royal retreat

The wait is getting longer by the day for the jinxed 

couple, even if it?s only for a day. The postponing of Charles-Camilla wedding 

by 24 hours to avoid a clash with the Pope?s funeral calls for sympathetic sounds, 

but Diana fans can take the leeway to delve deeper into the juicy details of how 

Charles?s wedding plans have been dogged from the start by unexpected snarls. 

The venue had to be switched in a mix-up over marriage licences, constitutional 

experts questioned the legality of a civil ceremony, the Queen has decided to 

steer clear of her son?s wedding and now the day?s delay? star-crossed, eh?

Bus fuss

Attack your egg pudding with care and crib about the 

proverbial egg on the face of the country vis a vis the smartness showed by mastermind 

Musharraf, yet again, in the event of the much-hyped Srinagar-Muzzafarabad bus 

service. Condemn the security lapse in the tourist reception area, loud and clear. 

Empty bravado and little spadework from the Indian side as a theme would make 

for a roaring talk show. That the Pakistani leadership chose to downplay the whole 

thing and not go in for the star-studded affair like the Indians sets up the clincher: 

?Unlike ours, their cricketers could learn a thing or two from their politicians!?

Dhoni amp; Dada

You may not be much of a cricket fan but you just 

have to go ga-ga about 23-year-old Dhoni?s typhoon on Tuesday. Raving about the 

braveheart from Ranchi can only be matched by raging about the boy from Behala 

not knowing where his stumps are. ?He is only there in the team to win the toss,? 

could be your dig at the diminishing stature of Dada.

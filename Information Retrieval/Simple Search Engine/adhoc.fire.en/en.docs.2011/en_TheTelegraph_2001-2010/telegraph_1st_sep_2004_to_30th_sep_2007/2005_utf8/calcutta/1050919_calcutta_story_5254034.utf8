The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Monitoring what we watch

 If the fight for the television viewer?s attention was between channels and genres so long, it is now spilling over to those who measure that span of attention.

 ?Like everything else, the television ratings system should also be online and in real-time,? offered Tapan Pal, CEO of Audience Measurement and Analytics (aMap), India?s first ?overnight television ratings system?. 

 The only other player in this market, Television Audience Measurement (TAM), takes around a week to provide viewership data. 

 Also, compared with TAM?s existing 4,800 peoplemeters, aMap claims to have some 5,000 meters around the country by end-2005, and 20,000 by 2006. ?Besides a larger sample size and quicker analysis, we can provide data across more categories as well,? Pal said.

 That ranges from household criteria like income, language spoken and vehicle ownership to individual criteria like education, gender and occupation. 

 For instance, in Calcutta, aMAP found STAR Ananda ? the leading news channel ? to have 28.2 per cent market share of Sec A homes, 18.6 per cent for housewives and 37.1 per cent for viewers who are executives in junior, middle or senior management.

 ?There are also checks in place to monitor things like abnormal viewing, meter malfunction and improper button pressing,? Pal said.

 In the aMap model, the meter attached to the viewer?s TV set relays the data back daily to the central server in Ahmedabad in the middle of the night. This is processed and made ready by 10.30 am the next day.

 TAM recently announced it would increase its current 4,800 peoplemeters to 10,300. ?The entry of aMap will certainly make TAM pull up its socks,? offered the head of a news channel. ?And monopoly isn?t good in any market.?

 But the industry is yet to be convinced fully and TAM ratings are what media buyers and planner still go by. ?You can?t compare an agency that gives data for just a few cities with one that provides all-India figures,? says Jasmin Sohrabji, president of Mumbai-based MediaCom.

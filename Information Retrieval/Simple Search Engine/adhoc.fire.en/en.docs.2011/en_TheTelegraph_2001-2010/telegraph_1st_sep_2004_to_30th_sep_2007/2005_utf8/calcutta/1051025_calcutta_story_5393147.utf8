 Furs and stripes

 Having begun his love affair with pen and ink more than two decades ago, Bishnu Dhars drawings reflect a passionate zeal that transforms apparently simple images into objects of serious art. Using a textured canvas on which he paints with waterproof ink, he creates sensitive expressions with deft, free-hand strokes. Rather than portraying his subjects realistically, he gives his works a graphic form, in a style that is fresh, original and inimitable. Beautiful People, the ongoing exhibition of pen and ink drawings by Dhar, brings together a selection of 30 of his recent works. Depicting creatures of the wild, the drawings bring alive the intelligence, power, compassion and tolerance of wild animals with an amazing richness and veracity that belie the unaffected quality of their monochromatic tones. Emphasising on the face and the hind part of the animals, while indicating the rest of it with a single stroke, the artist achieves rare sublimity in form and expression, at the same time giving his creations their distinctive identity and character.

 Event: An exhibition of recent pen and ink drawings by Bishnu Dhar

 When: Till October 31 (except Sunday), 2 pm - 7 pm; Saturday 10 am - 3 pm

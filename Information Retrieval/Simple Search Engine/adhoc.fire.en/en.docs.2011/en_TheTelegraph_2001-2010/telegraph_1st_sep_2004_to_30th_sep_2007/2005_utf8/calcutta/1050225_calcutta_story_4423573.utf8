The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Danny Denzongpa 

You have the gift of the gab, and it?s difficult to resist your charm. Once into a relationship, you?re loyal till the very end. You?re a great person to work with; you come across as pleasant even on your worst day. You never look down on people; in fact, you seem to find something that you can learn from them. You make a very patient and understanding teacher. ? Kusum Bhandari

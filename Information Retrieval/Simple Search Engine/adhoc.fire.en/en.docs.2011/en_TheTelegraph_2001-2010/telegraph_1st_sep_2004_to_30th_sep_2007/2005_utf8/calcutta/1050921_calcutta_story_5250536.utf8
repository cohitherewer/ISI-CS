 The dismal early-morning drizzle let up but the Mohammedan Sporting Club grounds was already a mass of foot-sinking, sticky and slippery slush. Okay for football, perhaps, but hardly recommended for kite-flying, when eyes are fixed skyward and hands busy manoeuvring the scraps of paper as they twist and turn and soar in air. But the contestants at TTIS Touch the Sky kite-flying contest didn?t seem to mind.

 The competition, the first of its kind, drew a mixed group of kids and grown-ups. Yellow Kites with TTIS logos were handed out to the 64 teams who had been chosen by a lucky draw from around 720 entries. Each team of two participants now vied for the top position.

 ?Bhon?. katta!? yelled Prattush Bhattacharya, a Class V student of National Gems Higher Secondary School, as his opponent?s flag twirled helplessly to the ground, leaving him a winner in the first round.

 Kite-flying, learnt from his father three years ago, comes right after cricket on Prattush?s list of hobbies. He often engages in rooftop matches with others of his age near his home in Behala. ?Pet-Kata is divided down the middle into two colours, Mukhpora is black with a full moon-like shape in the centre? ? Prattush says knowingly. Two other boys from Behala were also in queue, Kaustab Banerjee and Siddharth Merhotra of Class VIII, Julien Day.

 As the morning wore on, the sun came out and a cheery breeze swept the kites up high. A couple of seniors in the viewer?s pavilion couldn?t resist the temptation of doing what they had loved to do as children. In between, a quiz was conducted, with spot prizes for correct answers. The team led by Alfred Ness of Lenin Sarani, won the contest. The runner-up was the squad led by Aniket Das of JN Tewari Road, Dum Dum.

 A group of curious street children had gathered near the gate, waiting for a stray kite to come their way. When told that they too could take part in the TTIS contest, they were stumped. One eager 13-year-old, his bare feet splattered with mud, asked: ?Latai achhe, manja ghuri debe??

 Kite-flying will remain as long as hopes and aspirations remain; what it needs to really soar is opportunity.

 It was a project floated during a game of frisbee at the esplanade of the Louvre. Three young Parisians ? Adrien Roche, Timoth?e Alazraki and Padminie D?frene ? scripted a plan to come down to Calcutta and capture on camera the biggest non-religious festival in the city. So, there they were, roving with their equipment on the Calcutta Book Fair grounds.

 Of the three, one had done a stint here with the Alliance Francaise, another had come on a visit, while the third had heard a lot about the city from the other two. ?The common man in France knows Calcutta for Mother Teresa and poverty, and, therefore, does not consider it a place worth a visit. When I returned to Paris after my stay, people asked me ?Was it tough?? ? shrugged Padminie, a former cultural coordinator with Alliance Francaise de Calcutta. The aim of the project, in her words, is ?to disprove the clich?s that cloud conceptions about Calcutta?. 

 ?France,? she said, ?is in the process of discovering India, so there should be takers for our independent project.?

 The choice of the book fair as the focus was prompted by the selection of France as the theme country this year. ?Book fairs in Europe are boring. They concern dealings only among publishers. Here, it seems to be a collective party,? grinned Timoth?e, a sound recordist who has worked with eminent Italian filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci for his latest film The Dreamers, which was shot in Paris.

 The threesome had been following the fair ever since the bamboo poles started being planted on the Maidan. ?It was surprising how so many people recognised the pyramid of Louvre on seeing the France stall,? said Adrien. 

 Other than the French ambassador Dominique Girard, authors Jean-Claude Carri?re, Daniel Pennac and Sebastien Ortiz, who came down on the occasion, the team interviewed more than a hundred visitors. 

 ?The best thing about the fair was the people. Because of them, it was easier to shoot in India than in France. They asked what channel this was for, but they were always ready to face the camera. Also, they were very knowledgeable about camera angles and how to talk into the mike. No wonder India produces the highest number of films in the world,? pointed out Timoth?e.

 The trio had some ?surprises? ? ?some Bengali girls spoke to us in French, young men broke into song in front of the camera??. ?We also spoke to Sobhanlal Banerjee, architect of the book fair since its inception, to place the fair in historical perspective,? explained Padminie in fluent, though a little accented, Bengali. College Street has been covered to complete the book story. Some local authors are also to be spoken to.

 ?Which country are you from?? asked yet another curious voice, drawn by the fair complexion and the camera. On getting the answer, he added: ?You came in aeroplane?? The nod draws a true-blue Bengali wisecrack (not caught on French camera): ?We came from very near. In a rickshaw.?

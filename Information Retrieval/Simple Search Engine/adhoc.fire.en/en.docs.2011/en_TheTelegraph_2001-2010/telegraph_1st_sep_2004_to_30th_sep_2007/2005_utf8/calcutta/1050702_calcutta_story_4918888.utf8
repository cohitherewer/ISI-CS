 Island?s first pre-primary school

 RICHA BANSAL

 Sagar island will soon have its first-ever Montessori house, thanks to the efforts of a few individuals, who took up the cause on their own nearly eight years ago.

 In recognition of their work, the state government gave two bighas to Arindam Acharjee, currently officer-in-charge, Malda police station, Shimanti Das, managing trustee of Calcutta NGO Schools of the World, and P.B.S. Nair, a mechanical engineer, on June 17, to set up the school. 

 They had been imparting pre-primary education to children on the island for years in an informal manner. 

 ?But now, the children will have a proper Montessori house to look forward to,? says Das. ?Pre-primary education is neglected on the island. Though there are a number of primary schools, high schools and even a college, there is nothing by way of Montessori education. As a result, when children go straight to primary schools, starting at Class 1, they are unable to cope. Realising this, we took up the cause of teaching children between the ages of two-and-a-half and six,? she adds.

 The idea took shape in 1997, when Acharjee went for a dip in the Ganga Sagar with his family. ?I noticed an old man sitting under a tree, teaching 13 children, who used a single slate by turn,? he says. ?I was so impressed that I decided to support him.? 

 Acharjee regularly sent money to the man and slowly, the number of children increased. Later, Schools of the World joined him and now, they have 180 children being taught by local teachers.

 ?Seeing our work, the state government approached us last year and we were told that we would be given land on the island to build a Montessori school,? says Das. 

 For the past year, they were scouting for sponsors for the school. Finally, this June, the Sagar Sunderbans Sewa Samiti gave them the land. The plot had been allotted to the Samiti by the government for community development work.

 ?Though we were offered eight bighas, we have registered only two for now,? says Acharjee. The school will be called Schools of the World, Ganga Sagar branch, and they have already raised Rs 1.8 lakh.

 ?We have submitted the plan of the building and want to build it on the lines of Santiniketan,? says Acharjee. ?It will have a capacity of 500 children. In addition, we will also provide vocational training for the mothers of these children,? he adds.

 The children will be taught in the activity-based, play-way method. Trained teachers from the city branch of Schools of the World will impart this training to the local teachers on the island. ?Moreover, we will rope in retired teachers for the purpose,? says Acharjee.

 Though the school is to be inaugurated soon, initial funds being in place, the time taken to complete it will depend on the sponsorships, as the estimated cost of construction is more than Rs 10 lakh. ?But the rate at which people are coming forward to help us, with a computer already being donated to the school, I don?t think it will take too long,? concludes Das.

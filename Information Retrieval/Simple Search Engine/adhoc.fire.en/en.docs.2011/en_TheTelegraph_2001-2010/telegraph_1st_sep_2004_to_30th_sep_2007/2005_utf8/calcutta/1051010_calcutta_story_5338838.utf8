 A child who came all the way from Madhya Pradesh to enjoy the Pujas in Calcutta was run over near Bhabani Bhavan, in Alipore, on Sunday morning, in front of her parents. She later died in hospital.

 Jayita Mandal, 3, came to the city on Friday along with her father Tapas, mother Jayasree and one-year-old sister Jhumpi. Tapas is a lower-division clerk in the Indian Army and is posted in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. 

 The family was staying in the quarters of Jayasree?s mother Jyotsna Tudu, an employee of the public relations department of Calcutta Police, on Belvedere Road. 

 Around 6.10 on Sunday morning, Tapas set out for his parents? house in Basirhat, North 24-Parganas, along with his wife and children. They were at a taxi stand in front of the quarters, when Jayita was run over by a Matador, headed towards Behala along Belvedere Road.

 ?I crossed the road with Jayita and hired a taxi. Asking her to wait beside the taxi, I came back to the other side of the road to accompany my wife and younger daughter to the vehicle. I didn?t notice that Jayita was following me,? Tapas recounted.

 ?The goods carrier materialised from nowhere. It was moving at an abnormally high speed. It crushed Jayita in front of our eyes. My trousers were splattered with her blood,? he continued.

 The child was rushed to Command Hospital, where she was admitted and later succumbed to her injuries. ?She was born in the same hospital on January 14, 2002,? said a tearful Tapas.

 Jayita?s maternal uncle said: ?We didn?t break the news to my mother. My sister is in a shock. She is losing consciousness repeatedly and talking incoherently. We don?t know what to do.? 

 ?We have impounded the vehicle. The driver and his assistant were arrested. A probe has been launched,? said Nandadulal Pal, officer-in-charge of Alipore police station.

 The Mandals had planned to come back to Calcutta on Ashtami so that Jayita could enjoy the Puja festivities in full swing.

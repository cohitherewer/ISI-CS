 Season of sensuousness

 Bidding adieu to winter and welcoming spring, The Warmth of Colours, Idiyas Gallerys ongoing exhibition of Indian art and sculpture, marks a successful attempt to capture the transition of the seasons in a picturesque and sensuous manner. Making a stunning visual impact, the works on display are in a wide range of mediums including tempera, watercolours, oils, acrylics, charcoals, as well as experimental forms like metal, bronze, marble and fibreglass. In a blend of rich colours and themes that captivate the imagination, the carefully selected compilation of masterpieces and inspired works of art convey a sense of seamless harmony, perhaps as a metaphor for the quiet change of the seasons. The show features works by celebrated masters like Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Suhas Roy, Prokash Karmakar and Shyamal Sen (one of his paintings appear above), along with those of contemporary artists (Bratin Khan, Subroto Gangopadhyay and Partho Bhattacharjee) and promising newcomers (Rintu Roy, Shyamal Mukherjee and others).

 Trendy twist to tradition

IPSITA DEB

If 

you thought designer touches were limited to the Great Punjabi Weddings, a la 

Monsoon Wedding, check out the winter Bengali nuptials this season. 

 The unveiling of designer shankha, pola and loha at A. Sirkar on Friday afternoon can be a case in trendy wedding point.

 The contemporary face of the traditional accessories of a married Bengali woman saw polas in shades of black, blue, yellow, maroon and green instead of the usual red, interspersed with a touch of gold or diamond or mingled with dual shades. The shapes were as varied, which could be that of a watch or bracelet.

 The loha collection veered from the usual strip 

of gold on an iron base to include intricate designs like binuni loha (designed 

like a plait), floral and geometric motifs and baansh gath lohas (with 

bamboo knot-like designs). 

 The stark white shankhas are intricately wired to make them look more interesting as well.

 The four-day exhibition starting January 21 and titled Sonar Chhoanyay Sankha, Pola, Loha at the Rashbehari outlet, aims at creating a wider market for the traditional accessories.

?Our designs can be teamed with both western and ethnic 

wear. We especially hope to bring younger women into the fray,? said Brinda Ganguly, 

who has designed the collection. With the target audience widening, Brinda hopes 

the accessories will sell through the year and not just during the wedding season. 

 Premjit Sengupta of Diamond Trading Company agrees. ?While shankha, pola and loha are traditional symbols of a married Bengali woman, innovations in this segment seem to suit the modern mindset,? said Sengupta. 

 The collection unveiled by Rabindrasangeet exponent Riddhi Bandyopadhyay and model Priyanka Pal is priced at Rs 3,500 onwards. 

 Punjab palate

 The five-star food promotion race in town is on in full swing to fill in for the party lull, as it were. After the Hyderabadi special menu offering from neighbouring Hyatt Regency, ITC Sonar Bangla has come up with a Punjabi food fest.

 Being held at the 24-hour multi-cuisine restaurant Eden Pavilion, for the second consecutive year, by ?popular demand?, the buffet has all the trappings of traditional Punjabi fare, including a thick padding of stuffed parathas.

 Served up by chef Sweety Singh from Delhi, the range on offer is as wide as his grin. Reassured, one feels like digging into parathas stuffed with seasonal vegetables, Makki di Roti (chapatis made from maize flour), Patiala Shahi Murg, Dhaba Butter Chicken, Amritsari Machhi, Sarson da Saag, Kadi Pakora and a lot more on offer at the buffet priced at Rs 650 per head.

 ?But the piece de resistance is the butter chicken that is all buttery and chewy as it is meant to be,? recommends the chef.

 Like last time, Sweety has brought in his special pickle package from Delhi. The masala-stuffed red chillies, Dele ka Achaar and Shalgam Gobi Khatta Meetha Achaar make a plate full of snack by themselves.

 ?I make these myself, the recipes of which were passed on to me by my grandmother,? shares Sweety. 

 Owing to the late winter bonanza, Sweety has experimented more with vegetarian dishes this time around to come up with Gheeye ka Kofta, Kamalkakri ka Kofta, Karele ki Sabji, Seetafal Sabji and more.

 ?You don?t get that many vegetables during summer, so this seemed like a good time to organise the festival,? said Sweety.

 If you haven?t topped it all with sweets, you haven?t tasted anything. The calorie-count crowd better stay away from the rich and creamy Chuhare wali Kheer or a variety of halwas on offer like Gajar ka Halwa, Moong Dal ka Halwa and more. 

 The spread will be on till January 23.

 Film fare

 Madhuri Dixit fans can?t afford to miss out on the trademark jhatkas and matkas at Tantra this Saturday. 

 No, Mrs Nene won?t be here in person, it will only be one Geetal Patel from Mumbai, fed on the actress? moves starting from Ek do teen to Choli ke peechhe and Maar daala. 

 Nevertheless, that million dollar smile firmly in place, Geetal excels in the make-believe. Not convinced? Be there to get as close to Madhuri as you probably ever will.

 There?s no stopping the plex parade. If INOX is going north (read Jessore Road), 89 Cinemas is first going south before crossing the river and then returning to Rajarhat.

 Buoyed by the boom in the summer of 2005 ? which saw footfall at the Swabhumi cineplex leap from ?barely a thousand to 2,500-plus? ? the home-bred multiplex has decided to go places.

 First up, 89 Hazra, at the intersection of Panditiya Road and Hazra Road. The address, a mixed-use complex being developed by the Ffort Group, will follow the Swabhumi four-screen format, seating 1,100-plus. ?We should get the property next September and should be up and running by January 2007,? says Debashis Ghosal, CEO, 89 Cinemas.

 The group, aiming to become the ?number one multiplex provider in the east?, has announced ?at least 23 screens? in the next 24-odd months. 

 ?Having a presence in south Calcutta is absolutely crucial to achieve pole position in the east,? says general manager Prashant Srivastava, of the Hazra move.

 Also in 2007, slated for a Puja launch, is a ?four or five-screen? cinema at City Centre 2, being developed by Bengal Ambuja in New Town, Rajarhat. By April ?07, Howrah will get its ?first four-screen multiplex? in the heart of Salkia, claims 89 Cinemas. ?We have signed with BMR Developers for the 1,000-seat property,? says Ghosal.

 But before all that, a three-screen 89 in Durgapur is being readied now for a Puja launch. Another four-screener will come up in Siliguri by early ?07. ?While the B and C-class towns hold out immense promise for the multiplex business, there?s room for 10 to 15 properties in Calcutta, if they are properly spaced out,? feels Ghosal.

 Much of the ?big-screen-bigger-magic? bullishness stems from a 360-degree turnstile turnaround at Swabhumi. ?Yes, business in the first nine months (89 Cinemas opened on June 25, 2004) was lean. But we have gathered steam since April this year, and have been the highest grosser in town for a number of blockbusters. The momentum carried the weaker films as well,? claims Srivastava.

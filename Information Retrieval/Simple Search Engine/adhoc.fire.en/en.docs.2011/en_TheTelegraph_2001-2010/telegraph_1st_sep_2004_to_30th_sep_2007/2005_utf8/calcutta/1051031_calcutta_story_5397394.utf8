 They came all the way from Dreamworld, a popular theme park in Australia, to interact with children at the Shoppers Stop outlets in City Centre and Forum recently. Friendly Koalas, Kenny and Belinda Brown, along with Rocking Rangers Tony and Matt, entertained the tiny tots with their fun act.

 In keeping with the holiday spirit, this is our effort to do our bit for our tiny customers. The event was part of our Down Under Fest, says Naveen Misra, customer care associate and unit head of the Forum outlet.

 Kids joined the team as the entertainers belted out action songs like Give me a home among the gum trees and Kenny Koala has a park. The fun session also included a quiz round for the kids where the winners walked away with gift hampers. 

 The cute foursome had been to Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai before coming to Calcutta. It has been a great experience with the kids out here, said Tony and Belinda, the thumbs- up expressing the excitement.

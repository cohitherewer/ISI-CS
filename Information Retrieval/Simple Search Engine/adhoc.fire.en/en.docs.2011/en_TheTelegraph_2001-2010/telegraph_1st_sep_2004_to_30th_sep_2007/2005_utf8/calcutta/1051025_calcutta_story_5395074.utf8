 They were poised to step into the pond, paved on one side with glass, for a scene vital to the narrative of Praner Swami. Instead, the heroine had to be wheeled into ? and then out of ? a nursing home with a heavily-bandaged left foot, a unit member ended up in an operating theatre and the hero had a close shave.

 On Monday evening, Tollywood actress Rachana Banerjee and Bangladeshi actor Firdaus were shooting for the Indo-Bangla project at Technician 2, on Prince Anwar Shah Road, when the accident occurred.

 The culprit: a ?pond? in which Rachana and Firdaus were ready to make a splash.

 ?The makeshift pond was around 20 ft long and 5 ft deep. Three sides of the pond were made of concrete and the fourth was of glass. The idea was to roll in the camera through the transparent glass to shoot scenes underwater,? said a technician on the spot.

 ?Moments before the shoot, a concrete corner gave in and the glass panel was blown to pieces under the pressure of the gushing water. Rachana, who was standing by the pond, was hid by shards of glass. Her make-up man and another member of the unit were also injured,? added the witness.

 Rachana was rushed to EEDF Nursing Home, in Jodhpur Park, where she was administered a few stitches, put through a precautionary X-ray and then discharged.

 ?She has been advised a week?s bed-rest, after which the doctor will examine the wounds,? Rachana?s mother told Metro late on Monday.

 The other unit member was wheeled into the operating theatre of Bangur Hospital with ?heavy bleeding? from leg injuries.

 ?We had made a tank for a shoot, but it buckled under water pressure. The joints of the tank had become weak after the rains. One person, who has been critically injured by the glass shards, has been admitted to Bangur Hospital. Rachana was also taken to a nearby nursing home but was discharged after an X-ray,? summed up Vijay Khemka, producer of Praner Swami.

 According to witnesses, the pond was constructed on Sunday and had not dried up due to the incessant rains. The accident could have been devastating as electric wires had been immersed in the water.

 ?As soon as the water gushed out, somebody switched off the power line from the main connection. Otherwise, there could have been a major tragedy,? said another technician.

 Praner Swami is directed by A.K Sohail, with Swapan Saha as adviser.

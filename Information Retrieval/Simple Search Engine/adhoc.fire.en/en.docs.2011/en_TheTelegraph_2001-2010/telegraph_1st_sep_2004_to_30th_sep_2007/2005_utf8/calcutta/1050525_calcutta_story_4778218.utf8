 A celebration and a song

 - Buddha Jayanti art show

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Gallery Katayun celebrated Buddha Jayanti on Monday evening by holding an exhibition on the theme of the great teacher who is drawing more and more people from all over the world to his fold. As Italian artist Giovanna Caruso, the only Buddhist among the participants, marked the opening by lighting candles, Kishore Chatterjee in his emotionally-charged voice sang several songs from Chandalika when the untouchable girl encounters the Buddhist monk who asks her for a drink of water.

 Significantly, Chatterjee?s painting was inspired by a lyric from Rabindranath?s opera, where he describes the monks in their saffron robes bright like tapers. Essays on Buddha can go into lyrical excesses. Here they did not. Caruso?s painting was celebratory. The vividly-coloured artist floats down to earth on a cloud of balloons. In the backdrop is a huge Buddha painstakingly double-hatched .

 Aditya Basak had chosen to reflect on the human side of Buddha, which makes him so appealing to people of our times. He had drawn a large head of Buddha illuminated by offertory candles. The play of light was skillfully handled. Partha Pratim Deb?s Buddha minus the nimbus was no divinity either.

 Suhas Roy?s Buddha could have been a sketch from the caves complete with birds and beasts. Wasim Kapoor?s image has the minimum of lines, like his Jesus ? brown lines on white. Shuvaprasanna draws a pretty picture of lotuses and similarly shaped hands. Chandra Bhattacharya, too, focuses on this limb. He is a mendicant in Atin Basak.

 Only Sanatan Dinda and Subrata Gangopadhyay turn Buddha into an object of veneration. Both paint him as a mammoth statue that is worshipped.

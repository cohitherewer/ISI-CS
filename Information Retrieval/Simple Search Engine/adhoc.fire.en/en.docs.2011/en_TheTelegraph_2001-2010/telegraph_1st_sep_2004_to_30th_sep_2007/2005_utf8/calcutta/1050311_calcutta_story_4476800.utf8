 Shayne on a Swiss roll

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

His favourite performance venue is a girls? school. 

And not without a reason. Shayne Hyrapiet has a neat fan following among young 

women in the city, courtesy his cute looks, which, along with his substantial 

singing talent, has catapulted him to the status of Calcutta?s crown prince of 

cover performers. 

 But even as the fan mails pour in and the crowd goes crazy with every new performance he stages in town, Shayne himself is all set to test new waters (or mountains to be precise) and give his boy-next-door image an international boost. 

 He has been roped in by international tours and travel agency SOTC to perform in destinations across Switzerland to entertain guests from around the world with his vocal prowess. 

 Just back from performances in Bangkok, Shayne is all set to take up this new challenge, selecting a mix of Indian and western tracks to sing during his year-long stint in the playground of Europe. Play might begin as early as next month. 

 But for the 20-something who has shared stage with everyone from Usha Uthup to Shaan and Bombay Vikings, a performance abroad isn?t a new story. Having staged shows in the US, Bangkok, Dhaka and Bhutan, Shayne is confident of making a mark with his next assignment. 

 ?I will be representing India in the world forum, and that?s the biggest challenge,? says the singer who just a year ago performed for the President of the country during his visit to St Xavier?s College, Calcutta. 

 The one grumble of Shayne ? he will have to give the city and its yummy Chinese food at the Tangra restaurants a miss for so long!

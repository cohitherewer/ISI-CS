Theatre

 Deepadanda

 Bohurupee?s latest production turns back time to the kingdoms of Pataliputra and Magadh, and the divergent worldviews of surgeons Kumarbhatta Jibak and Sudatta. The social reality of the period is reflected in the conflict of ideologies of an idealist and a realist. Directed by Kumar Roy. 

Catch it at Academy of Fine Arts, 6.30 pm, October

 With loads of humour and witty repartees, the Nandipat production exposes the pompousness and false grandeur of the wealthy landed gentry. The play by Badal Sircar is directed by Prakash Bhattacharya.

 Ho Sakta Hai Do Aadmi Do Kursiyaan

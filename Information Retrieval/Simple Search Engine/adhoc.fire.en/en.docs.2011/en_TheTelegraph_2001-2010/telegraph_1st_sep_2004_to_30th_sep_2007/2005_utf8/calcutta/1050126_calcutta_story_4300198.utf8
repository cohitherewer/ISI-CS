The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Voices on view

 On January 12, a hall on the ground floor of Hotel Intercontinental in Mumbai saw 25 pairs of nervous feet troop in for the ?intensive round? of the Samsung [V] Super Singer contest, post-breakfast.

 ?The room was dark. Strains of piano notes could be heard from within. We took it to be a musician on the sets playing some tune by Adnanji (Sami). Then a light came on behind the piano and we saw ? A.R. Rahman!? Kaushiki Gupta, Calcutta?s sole representative in the ?intensive round?, recalls how they had squealed the maestro?s name in shocked chorus. 

 Rahman has joined Adnan Sami as a judge in the final audition phase of the musical reality show that comes on beam every Thursday at 9 pm. ?When they approached me, my first thought was, who am I to judge them?? said Rahman.

 Sami, on the other hand, has been in the judge?s seat since Day I of the contest. ?As a judge one does get attached to a lot of them. You literally see them grow from one round to the next. But of course one has to stay neutral,? he smiles.

 Sami, playback and pop sensation, travelled the length and breadth of the country for auditions in 10 cities. About 25,000 passionate contenders participated in this nationwide hunt.

 ?The biggest surprise was Cochin. No one has ever gone there to tap talent. But there were some amazing voices.? Sami must have liked what he heard for he chose as many as three singers from there for the zonal round.

 Calcutta ?did not disappoint? either, with two participants making the zonal grade.

 Is singing talent enough to make it in the world of Hindi music? Not really, feels Rahman. ?I heard the 25 finalists. Some of them have great voices. But what I was looking for is originality of style.?

 Rahman, who has turned musical arrangement in Bollywood on its head, is known to often use a voice as just another instrument in his scheme of things. ?A singer is as good as he conveys the words of the song,? he clarifies.

 Singing well is, of course, important. Some of the singers who had landed up at the city auditions had trained voices but others were raw. Is it possible for untrained voices to make a mark? ?Why not?? counters Sami. ?I never had any training in singing. I was a pianist.?

 As an example, he also cites the one amateur who taught a sargam or seven to many trained vocalists ? Kishore Kumar. ?Please do not shoot these kids down before they take off. Kishore Kumar was hardly a name when he arrived here,? he reasons.

 Sami?s attachment to the ?kids? was evident in his interactions with them. ?He used to play such pranks. After the initial round, he came behind the stage and told us that we had sung so badly that he could not select anyone. I dissolved in tears. Then he sat beside me and slowly said: ?Tum pass ho gayi ho,? ? recounts Kaushiki.

 Having made it to the top 25, the 26-year-old, who sang the Jewel Thief number Raat akeli hai before the duo, feels the training they were given in yoga and vocal practice before landing in front of Rahman was well worth the journey to Mumbai. 

 Moreover, the loser also does not lose out entirely. ?I have chosen one of the rejects to sing on track for an upcoming film. If the producer likes his voice, he may stay in the album,? stresses Rahman.

 Since the results are not out on the telly, he is not giving out the name of the lucky loser, yet.

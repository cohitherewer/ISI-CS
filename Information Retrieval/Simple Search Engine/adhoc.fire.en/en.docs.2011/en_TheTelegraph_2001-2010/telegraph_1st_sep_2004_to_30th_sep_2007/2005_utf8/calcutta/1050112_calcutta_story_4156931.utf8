The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic body winds up tardy wing

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

The Kasba booster station and Southern Avenue pumping station, both handled by 

private agencies, have been completed in 18 months and 13 months, respectively. 

The booster stations at Bagmari and Ranikuthi, handled by P amp;D, have been commissioned 

in four years and two-and-a-half years, respectively.

 Having tasted the efficiency of the private sector, Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided to shut down one of its oldest departments, Project amp; Development (P amp;D). 

 ?It?s sad, but shutting down P amp;D has become inevitable,? mayor Subrata Mukherjee said on Tuesday.

 ?Our experience with private firms, such as Larsen amp; Toubro, Tantia Construction and Simplex, tells us that they are far more serious about commissioning a turnkey project within the deadline. But the same, unfortunately, cannot be said of our own departments,? he added.

 As per schedule, P amp;D will be phased out after the Rs 15-crore Kalighat pumping station is commissioned in March. 

 More than 200 engineers and other employees of P amp;D will be redeployed in other departments. ?It will be difficult for us to get them new projects,? the mayor explained. 

 And the reason is not far to seek: all major ongoing projects, totalling about Rs 100 crore, are being executed by private agencies. 

 The civic body had incurred losses in all projects, save one, undertaken by the P amp;D. The exception was the BK Pal Avenue community hall, from which it has earned a profit of Rs 7 lakh.

 P amp;D was set up in 1980 as the market complex department to monitor and implement development projects at civic markets. It was rechristened P amp;D following a devastating fire at New Market in 1988, during the tenure of mayor Kamal Basu.

 After the reconstruction of the fire-ravaged market, P amp;D took up over a dozen projects ? including community halls, hawker rehabilitation schemes, housing estates, water treatment plants and booster pumping stations. Most of the projects have failed to meet the deadline. 

 The P amp;D role was gradually restricted to working out project designs and awarding work orders to contractors.

 ?But even the design workmanship of P amp;D was not up to the mark,? said mayoral council member (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee. ?And that is the chief reason why the water supply department has started taking up projects on its own,? he added.

 Artists Circle has taken upon itself the noble task of providing medical aid and insurance coverage to senior artistes. To that end it had organised a four-day art workshop at Vedic Village, miles away from Calcutta at Shikarpur in Rajarhat. Twenty-one artists, some well-known, participated in the workshop.

 The workshop, which ended on Friday, marked the beginning of the organisation?s health support programme. The scheme is open to all performing full-time artistes who hold no jobs. 

 Medical coverage up to Rs 1 lakh would be provided. Beyond that, cash will be paid. The sale proceeds from the works made at the workshop will be forwarded to the artist welfare fund. Artists Circle has tied up with an insurance company to provide medical insurance. A panel has been formed for the selection of candidates. 

 Six senior artists ? Paritosh Sen, Suhas Roy, Bijon Choudhury, Prakash Karmakar, Rabin Mondal and Alok Bhattacharya ? have been given medical insurance coverage.

 ITC sponsored the programme and gave the participants an honorarium.

 Nobody expects art workshops to be hotbeds of creativity. Artists churn out works on short notice and within a very very short period of time, when it is not really possible always to produce works of great aesthetic value. So what most artists do is to produce something that would take least effort and yet would keep both organisers and buyers happy.

 It has become a trend for many artists not to paint at workshops at all. They just produce a readymade painting, already neatly framed, ready to be sold. This workshop was no different. Prakash Karmakar had his signature nude with floppy breasts. Sunil Das had his raging bull. Suhas Roy his Radha.

 Dewashish Das painted two village women. Partha Bhattacharya human beings painted by lamplight. Amitabha Sengupta a bright collage of glossy paint and hieroglyphics.

 Alok Bhattacharya rarely shows his paintings in Calcutta nowadays. So his works were a welcome change. He has used thin layers of paint to create delicate works that are very different from heavily muscled men he used to paint once.

 Aditya Basak had made a very strong drawing of a face. But that is to be expected of him.

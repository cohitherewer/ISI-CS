The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 British cradle for managers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pune, Bangalore? Calcutta. After the campus capitals of the west and south, TASMAC (Training and Advanced Studies in Management and Communications) has set its sights on the east.

 The new three-storeyed campus of TASMAC was inaugurated in Salt Lake?s Sector V by British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall. 

 The third TASMAC campus in the country is in line with its vision to ?bring the best of British management education to India?.

 Giri Dua, chairman and managing director, TASMAC, said: ?We are extremely proud to have our campus in Calcutta, as it will provide an excellent opportunity for students in this region to acquire an MBA qualification from the University of Wales, UK.?

 Dua started TASMAC 15 years ago as a consultancy to other educational institutions. The first TASMAC campus started off in Pune. Today, there are three campuses and an extensive network of over 150 TASMAC counselling centres spread over 50 cities across India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

 The Calcutta campus, on 15,000 sq ft, is equipped with modern educational facilities and a state-of-the-art computer lab, an up-to-date library and a modern conference room.

 ?India is on the brink of becoming a knowledge superpower and Calcutta is well poised to be in the forefront,? observed the deputy high commissioner. ?And TASMAC?s partnership with the University of Wales is a sign of the growing trend of partnerships between the United Kingdom and India in every aspect.?

 Eligibility for admission to TASMAC is a bachelor?s degree or a postgraduate qualification from a recognised university and at least two years of relevant managerial or professional work experience.

 TASMAC is the first institute outside Europe and the only institution in India to be accredited and recognised by the British Accreditation Council for Independent Further and Higher Education (BAC). By setting up a campus in Calcutta, it has given students of this city an opportunity to acquire high-quality education in management.

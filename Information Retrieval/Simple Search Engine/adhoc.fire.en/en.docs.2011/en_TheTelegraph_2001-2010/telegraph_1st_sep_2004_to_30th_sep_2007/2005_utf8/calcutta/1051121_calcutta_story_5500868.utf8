 BIMAL SINGH, RJD councillor of ward 47 and chairman of Borough VI, met readers of The Telegraph on Friday to answer their queries. Participants were Suren Sharma, Manali Desai, Sikha Lodh, Kinshuk Kar, Motiur Rahman, Jagannath Ghosh, Mala Datta, Sitanshu Joardar, Sandip Banerjee, Md Muzahirul Hassan, Sanjoy Koley, Rakesh Kumar Ojha and Nasim Siddiqui

Manali Desai: In Malanga Lane and Madan Boral Lane, there is chronic shortage of filtered water, though potable water is wasted round-the-clock from roadside taps.

 I have taken up a scheme to lay a pipeline between Madan Boral Lane and CR Avenue.

Sandip Banerjee: Why isn?t wastage of filtered water through roadside taps prevented?

 A good percentage of Calcuttans do not have taps in their homes. It is expected that they will use the roadside taps responsibly. Unfortunately, that is seldom the case.

 Wastage of filtered water through standpipes is a problem in all parts of the city. The water supply department is considering a proposal to seal standpipes with broken taps.

Kinshuk Kar: There are several street dogs in Kenderdine Lane, frequented by students of Loreto school and St Joseph?s College. 

 The civic health department is duty-bound to keep the roads free of stray animals. There is a dog squad and a dog pound at Dhapa. But since 1998, following pressure from Maneka Gandhi, the civic authorities have handed over the responsibility of controlling the dog population to several NGOs. The dog squad now acts only against rabid dogs.

Sanjoy Koley: Since most of the NGOs exist only in name, we will have to wait till the dogs go mad and bite us, before the civic body takes some action... 

 The civic authorities have entrusted the job of controlling the canine population in the area to Calcutta Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (CSPCA). Despite repeated requests, members of the organisation are not sterilising the stray dogs. I will meet the CSPCA officials. If they still do not act, I will ask another NGO, which is doing good work, to take on the responsibility.

Jagannath Ghosh: Shop-owners have encroached on Jadunath De Road. Why aren?t you doing something?

 I admit it?s a serious problem and something needs to be done. I request you to submit a mass petition, so that I can take up the matter with the proper authorities. 

Sitanshu Joardar: Jadunath De Road and Kenderdine Lane have turned into an unauthorised parking lot for trucks. There is also a public urinal polluting the air of the area. Please act against the twin menace.

 I will ascertain whether the civic estate department has permitted the trucks to park there. If necessary, I will take up the matter with the police. I have already taken up a scheme to renovate the public urinal in Kenderdine Lane. It will be cleaned regularly from now on. 

Mala Datta: To prevent littering, we had placed several flowerpots in Malanga Lane. But residents of Mogpara have broken all the pots.

 The matter can be sorted out through discussion. I am ready to mediate. 

Sikha Lodh: Mogpara residents also dump garbage in Malanga Lane. 

 That is unfortunate. Littering of roads is an offence and the civic body can realise cash fines from the offenders. Moreover, trash is collected daily from every house.

 I have introduced conservancy service in two shifts ? morning and afternoon. I hope this will give you some relief. If sweepers don?t clean your area, please inform me. I am available in front of Jabakusum House every morning.

Sikha Lodh: Street lights in our area are not switched on by the civic staff. 

 I have taken up the matter with the lighting department.

Concluded

 Ramp to lead role

 Sayantani with Prosenjit in Raju Uncle

 A sultry siren with a flair for acting. Tollywood?s latest contender for the top heroine?s throne comes across as a blend of beauty and brains in her debut feature film. And barely two weeks into the release of Haranath Chakraborty?s Raju Uncle, Prosenjit?s leading lady Sayantani Ghosh is at the receiving end of kudos galore.

 ?I admit there is much scope for me to improve but considering that it?s my first film, the industry has appreciated my performance and I am very happy,? gushes Sayantani. ?Luckily for me, I had quite a few scenes in Raju Uncle which were performance-oriented.?

 With a background in ramp walk and modelling, Sayantani has also pulled off a sizzling number in short skirts and skimpy outfits in style. ?The outfits were a little revealing but I am comfortable in these clothes as I have done modelling before. But I will never show so much skin that everyone can?t go and see my film,? says the final-year English (hons) student of Bhawanipur Education Society. 

 The former Sananda Tilottama started off with print modelling and ramp walk before trying out TV anchoring and starring in a telefilm or two. Sayantani had a major role in the Zee Bangla mega serial Ekdin Pratidin, but her character was packed off to Bangalore ever since her film commitments made it difficult for her to juggle the two screens. ?Though I did some TV assignments, my aim was always to get into films,? she admits.

 In Haranath Chakraborty?s forthcoming Ekar Sansar, being produced by Saregama Films, Sayantani has been paired with Prosenjit for the second time. Yet, a twist in the tale makes her settle for Prosenjit?s screen brother Jisshu Sengupta instead.

 ?Prosenjit plays the elder son who sacrifices everything for his family but is misunderstood by everyone, including my character. So, I get married to Jisshu. I have only one song in the film but the role is very important. It has lots of shades,? says Sayantani. But she admits that there isn?t much scope for her in Sujit Guha?s Nayak. ?This is mostly on a father-son relationship and there is Swastika Mukherjee with me.?

 Both films, in the final stages of shooting, are gearing up for a September release.

 So does she have her eyes set on the leading lady?s crown? ?Well, there is Rachanadi (Banerjee), Koel (Mullick), Swastika, Rimjhim (Gupta) and Arunima (Ghosh), and I think all of them are very good. The top seat is vacant now and let?s see who gets it. I think there?s healthy competition among us all,? smiles Sayantani.

 - CPWD apathy wholly to blame

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Is the seafarers? chapel-turned-clinic awaiting the demolition man? Picture by Pabitra Das

 It was an old seamen?s church in Hastings, that later became a clinic. If it is demolished, the criminal apathy of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) would be wholly responsible for the destruction. 

 The CPWD, as representative of the Union of India, was the original defendant in the case of the sale of this beautiful and ancient structure, standing on approximately 9,000 sq ft. It has been shrouded in mystery ever since it was auctioned in the 1950s for a paltry Rs 7,000.

 Ironically, while the CPWD has practically given up the case, another government organisation, Port Health Organisation (PHO), the added defendant in this case, has appealed to the divisional bench against the high court verdict.

 The March 7 verdict has gone in favour of plaintiff R.K. Burman.

 The building became derelict after the CPWD told the PHO to vacate the building in 1996. Now, it is fenced off, as if its end is close at hand.

 After it was abandoned in 1996, the two-storeyed building at 6, Clyde Row, which was an old seafarers? chapel and later a seamen?s clinic under the Seamen?s Welfare Association (SWA), turned into a squatters? haven.

 The CPWD had taken over charge of the building in 1954. In 1939, SWA acquired the building from the Calcutta Diocesan Trust Association. 

 The management and control of the premises were handed over to the port health officer in 1948 for a rent of Re 1 per month, payable to the SWA. Payment of ground rent, municipal taxes and carrying out repairs were the liability of the port health officer ? terms approved by the director-general of health services (DGHS) under the Union ministry of health. 

 Though the CPWD had taken over control of the premises (maintenance and payment of taxes) from the DGHS under the ministry of health in 1954, the port health officer continued to run the seamen?s clinic there. But the CPWD had neglected to pay ground rent totalling Rs 271 and 5 annas from April 1, 1954 to September 30, 1957, to the state government through the Khasmahal collector, 24-Parganas. 

 So, the Khasmahal certificate officer sold the building by auction on May 22, 1957, for Rs 7,000 to Burman. 

 Perhaps sensing that something was amiss, on August 28, 1957, the government of India, through the executive engineer, CPWD, filed a petition along with the SWA to set aside the sale on November 13. Since then, the case has dragged. 

 Appeals have been filed and dismissed several times. The Union of India, through the executive engineer, CPWD, filed a petition to be party in the civil suit that was granted. On June 12, 1962, the rule was made absolute by Calcutta High Court. 

 Despite the legal wrangle, the clinic operated there all the while. Ultimately, an ex parte decree in favour of R.K. Burman was passed on April 28, 1994, which was subsequently set aside. 

 The PHO became party only in 2002. Ever since it moved out of the building, it has operated from Marine House. The CPWD did nothing to repair the building. Till the latest verdict, the PHO was in symbolic possession of the building.

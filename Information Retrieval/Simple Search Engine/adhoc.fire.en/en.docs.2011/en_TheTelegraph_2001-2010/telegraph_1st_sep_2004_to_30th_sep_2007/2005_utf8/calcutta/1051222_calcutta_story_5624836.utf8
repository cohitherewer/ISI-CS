The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School for organ transplant skills

 SANJAY MANDAL

 India?s first organ transplant training institute is coming up in Calcutta. 

 The centre will be part of the Rs 175-crore organ transplant hospital, to be set up in New Town, Rajarhat, by Hyderabad-based Global Hospitals Group. The courses can be joined by postgraduate medical students, doctors, para-medical staff and nurses.

 ?Our institute will train candidates in the high skill required for organ transplants. No other institute in the country provides such training. I have sent a detailed plan on the hospital and the institute to the state government,? said surgical gastroenterologist K. Ravindranath, managing director of Global Hospitals, over phone from Hyderabad.

 Talks are on to rope in doctors from the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences and PGI Chandigarh for the hospital.

 The 750-bed hospital was initially planned to be set up on 20 acres in New Town. But the implementing agency of the township, Hidco, has told the group that a single plot of 20 acres could not be made available.

 Global Hospitals has, instead, been offered two plots across the road. The group has held a series of meetings with the state government, including with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, on the location issue.

 The hospital was planned to comprise seven towers, housing a cardio-thoracic unit for heart transplant, a gastroentrology unit with liver transplant facilities, a nephrology and urology unit, a haematology unit, an ophthalmology centre with retinal transplant facilities and units for stem cell harvest and research.

 A hotel, malls and guest houses, along with staff quarters, were planned to be the other features of the project, all under one roof.

 ?We need to modify the project if a single plot is not available,? Ravindranath said. He, however, made it clear that all the departments and the training institute would be set up, though they may not be under the same roof.

 Global Hospitals is also setting up three other organ transplant centres ?in Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi. The Bangalore unit will be commissioned by April 2006 and the one in Mumbai will start functioning from early 2007. ?We are also planning to expand the hospital in Hyderabad and convert it into a health city,? Ravindranath told Metro. 

 The group, with help from Save Health, a healthcare body providing guidance to patients on treatment facilities, is setting up a clinic in the city. ?It will be operational in a few days,? said Tamal Bhattacharya, director of Save Health. 

 The clinic will have tele-medicine facilities and will be visited by doctors from Global Hospitals, Hyderabad.

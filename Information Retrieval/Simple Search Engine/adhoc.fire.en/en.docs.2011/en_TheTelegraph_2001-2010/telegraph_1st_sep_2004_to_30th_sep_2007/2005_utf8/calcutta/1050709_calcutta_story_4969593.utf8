The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Festival comes of age

 It can at last be said that the Odeon festival has come of age. Rather than confine itself to the mainstage mainstream, this year it also embraced street theatre, dance theatre and what it termed ?intimate theatre?. Actually intimate theatre means something else, not performance inside a bookshop, which belongs to what specialists now call theatre in found spaces.

 The concept behind ?found spaces? is simple. When theatre lost its former mass appeal and realised the pointlessness of playing to large but three-quarters empty halls, some directors decided that if audiences don?t come to the theatres, theatre will go to the audience. So they searched for appropriate spaces where this can happen. Thus the new practice of shows in cafes, lobbies, malls and stores, which have captive clienteles that, troupes hope, may be intrigued enough by what?s going on to sit down, watch, and get hooked.

 In fact, Ensemble?s Jogajog at Crossword Bookstore turned out to be the most interesting of the Bengali plays at Odeon. By a stroke of mischievous genius, Sohag Sen chose as her satirical object the mobile menace at a performance ? in a festival of performances sponsored by a mobile network! As viewers settled down to listen to a singer who started the programme, a cellphone rang in the audience and everyone overheard the recipient?s loud conversation until they succeeded in shutting him up. Every time the singer began, another mobile rang.

 The story of each (phoney) dialogue became the story of the play, some quite gripping, like the call about someone dying, which we discovered merely relayed a TV serial?s latest developments, or the wannabe don who kidnaps a housewife for ransom, but her husband tells him he can keep her. Dipak Ghosh as a godman and Abhrajit Chakrabarti, who does filmstar imitations, had the spectators in splits.

 In comparison, Theatre Spandan?s Shabdagaon, outside Madhusudan Mancha, fell flat. This five-year-old team dramatised the real-life incident of two well-meaning NGO workers killed in a Bihar village by the politician-police-pradhan alliance against their honest efforts. A fine message of resistance, but Saurav Gupta directs too casually, unmusically and simplistically to leave an impact.

 The two proscenium productions selected by the jury also proved that Odeon has expanded its catchment area to not-so-famous groups, superseding the big names who used to corner its support previously. This segment of the festival assumes greater importance now because it encourages original Bengali scriptwriting, evaluated for possible funding by the judges.

 Both plays projected women?s sorrowful history before our eyes. Gobardanga Shilpayan dramatised Antarjali Jatra, Kamal Majumdar?s 1960 novel about post-Ram Mohun Roy sati. Ashis Chattopadhyay directs good ensemble scenes, gets the best acting from Priyendushekhar Das as the drunk but compassionate dom and stages an impressive climax where floodwaters sweep in, but Majumdar?s problematic conclusion remains.

 Illusion debuted promisingly with Kalyani Dutta?s Kanon Pishir Jawpomala (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), based on research into the state of widows sent off to Kashi or Vrindavan. A schoolgirl discovers prayer beads in her home and asks her parents who they belonged to, but receives evasive answers. She reads up about Hindu widows on the Net and, magically, three such women appear, telling her how they dealt with the inhuman conditions imposed on widows, and then vanish as suddenly as they came.

 It strikes me as unlikely that Kanon Pishi would leave her beads behind when going to Vrindavan. However, Suranjana Dasgupta directs her own daughter, Kathakali Deb, in a very natural performance as the girl, Chhanda Chatterjee makes by far the best of the widows, and Tania Banerjee gives the maid?s voice a nice raspy edge, while the others support well. 

 This play conveys the same moral as Jogajog ? in today?s technological world, nurture face-to-face communication.

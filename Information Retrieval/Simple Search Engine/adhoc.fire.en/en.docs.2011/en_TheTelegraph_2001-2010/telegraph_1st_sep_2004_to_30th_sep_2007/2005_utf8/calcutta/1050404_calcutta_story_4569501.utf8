 Cops pressured out by prison unions

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The move to deploy policemen on the Presidency jail premises proved futile after unions of warders and officers pressured the authorities to withdraw the ?humiliating? decision.

 In the face of stiff opposition by the unions, social welfare and jails minister Biswanath Chowdhury had no choice but to withdraw the four policemen who had been deployed five days ago in front of Presidency jail?s main gate to search the warders every time they entered or left the premises.

 The first-of-its-kind move of posting policemen in the jails was taken after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stated in the Assembly that high-risk prisoners ? including Aftab Ansari, the alleged mastermind of the abduction of Khadims owner Parthapratim Roy Burman and the attack on American Center ? were in constant touch with their associates outside.

 Bhattacharjee?s statement hinted that a section of warders, who have easy access to the prisoners? cells, were aiding the criminals. 

 Inspector-general of police (prisons) Joydeb Chakraborty then met commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee at Lalbazar to thrash out a plan for stepping up security in the jails.

 Accordingly, four policemen with metal detectors were deployed near the main gate of Presidency jail. 

 All four unions of warders and officers ? affiliated to the CPM and RSP ? opposed the decision from the day it was implemented in Presidency jail. They demanded immediate withdrawal of the police posting, saying it was humiliating, and insisted that there was no reason for frisking staff members at the gate.

 ?We are not supporting those who aid the prisoners. We will not oppose punishment of those found guilty. But the past incidents do not indicate that all the warders are maintaining links with prisoners in exchange of money,? said a union member. 

 ?Why should every staff member go through a security check at the start of work and while leaving office?? he demanded to know.

 In a bid to sort out the problem, minister Biswanath Chowdhury intervened in the matter and told the unions that the move had been initiated at the instruction of the chief minister. 

 To this, the representatives of all four unions said: ?We are running short of staff. If you want to beef up security, fill the vacant posts immediately. And if you have decided to deploy police, let them do the rest of our job as well.?

 The union members even threatened to go on strike if the policemen deployed on the premises were not removed immediately. Minister Chowdhury gave in to the unions? demands and withdrew the policemen on Friday night.

 ?The deployment had been effective. Probes into a number of cases in the past revealed that prisoners maintain contact with the underworld outside by bribing the warders,? said a Lalbazar officer.

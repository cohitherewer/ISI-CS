The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Upgrade jams cell network

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Subscribers to cellular service provider Airtel in the city woke up to a signal-less morning on Wednesday. Neither calls nor text messages could be sent or received by Airtel users for nearly four hours.

 ?Not available, please try after sometime,? greeted those from other networks trying to reach Airtel consumers.

 The service provider, which has around 5.13 lakh subscribers in the city, attributed the problem to a ?planned upgrade? of its network.

 ?We have been in the process of upgrading our networks from Siemens to Nokia,? said N.V. Subba Rao, chief operating officer, mobility, Bharti Tele-Ventures, Calcutta.

 The service provider had planned to finish the work early on Wednesday but there was some delay. ?The Calcutta network is a big challenge as it is the oldest network in the country. While working on the new hardware integration, we saw that some areas required more attention than we thought,? Rao explained.

 As a result, users across the city were affected, he added. Nokia and its team of engineers is ?working round the clock? to restore and upgrade connectivity, the company said.

 Airtel is carrying out upgrade work in its West Bengal circle, including 500 base-stations in Calcutta. ?The upgrade is also being carried out to safeguard against any bottlenecks during the Christmas and New Year period.?

 In case of a repeat of Wednesday?s no-network scenario, the company will inform its subscribers in advance, officials said.

 Airtel recently entered into an agreement with Nokia to expand its GSM/ GPRS/EDGE networks in eight circles ? Mumbai, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bihar, Orissa, Calcutta, West Bengal and Maharashtra.

 With substantial investment in the networks, there would be less congestion and lower number of call drops, Airtel claimed.

 But for subscribers who went through the Wednesday woes, just remaining connected seemed good enough.

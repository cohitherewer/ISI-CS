 Repair of roads a civic duty

Chandrasekhar Sil: City roads with tram tracks are in a bad shape. The condition of roads such as BB Ganguly Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and parts of MG Road is appaling. The previous mayor refused to repair them. Will your stand be the same?

 The civic authorities are duty-bound to repair roads for easy movement of vehicular traffic and pedestrians. They cannot refuse to repair a road on the ground that maintaining a part of it is the responsibility of some other body. Hence, sticking to my predecessor?s stand on the issue is out of the question.

 It is a fact that the onus of repairing the portions of roads adjacent to the tram tracks lies with Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC), which is not financially sound at the moment. We will discuss the issue with the CTC and extend a helping hand if it fails to repair the damaged roads.

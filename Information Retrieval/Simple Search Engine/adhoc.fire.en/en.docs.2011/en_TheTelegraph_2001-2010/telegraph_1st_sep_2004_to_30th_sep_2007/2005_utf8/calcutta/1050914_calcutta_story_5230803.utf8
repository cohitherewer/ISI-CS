Life

 Patience the key to good parenting

 It was a rain-drenched Sunday evening. An evening most Calcuttans would have preferred to spend indoors with steaming cups of tea. But not the residents of Swaranica Housing Complex at Shakuntala Park, off Behala Chowrasta.

 For this was chosen for the fourth GoodLife Talk Show with star guest Aparajita Auddy.

 Braving the rain, residents comprising both parents and children in this 400-plus apartment complex turned up on the patch of green in hordes to watch their favourite telly star talk on Child Psychology and Parenting, the topic for the evening.

 The first half, however, had to be carried by Rita Bhimani, moderator of the show, as Aparajita got delayed because of a shoot.

 But the audience did not seem to mind as they flooded Rita with a flurry of questions right from the start. Parents wanted to know what they could do to keep their children away from television, how they could handle their tantrums, and what they could do to make them concentrate more on their studies.

 Rita preferred to start from scratch and analyse why parents faced so much difficulty in bringing up their children these days.

 Now, right from a very young age, children are exposed to a whole lot of more things than we were. This very often tends to have an adverse effect on children, making life a lot more difficult for parents. Parents have to handle their children with a lot more patience.

 In most families, both parents are working to make ends meet. And very often they are not able to spend adequate time with their wards. But parents should not feel guilty about it, as it is always about being able to spend quality time and not quantity time with children, stressed Rita in her characteristically easy style.

 Rita, mother of budding cricket commentator Gautam Bhimani, went on to say how sending children for private tuitions at the tender age of three was very very wrong.

 This paved the way for a whole lot of questions from different sections of the crowd on parents trying to push their children into too many extra-curricular activities. All work and no play no doubt makes Jack a dull boy, but parents of today pressurise their children into doing too many things at the same time, without understanding the kind of stress it creates on the young mind (and body). A child can specialise in only a few things; you cannot expect him to play, sing, dance and draw all at the same time, said Rita.

 A Class VIII student, Saptarshi Bhattacharya, then brought up an issue of real concern when he talked about how a fellow student in his school had actually complained to the principal about being beaten up by his parents for not being able to score 80 per cent marks in his exams.

 Said Rita: This is indeed a dangerous trend. You have to let your child be the way he or she is...

 Then, enter the star of the evening, in an off-white embroidered sari teamed with a red blouse, apologising profusely for her delayed arrival.

 After listening to a clutch of questions, Aparajita returned to the root cause of the problem and picked on nuclear families as a major source of disquiet.

 Most of us grew up in joint families and hence, right from childhood, we knew how to share things. Todays children are extremely selfish, and small families are the sole cause for this. Also, since most parents are working today, they often pamper their children with gifts to compensate for their inability to spend time with them. This has to be stopped immediately, as its causes irreparable damage. Then, if a parent says no to something, the child throws a tantrum as he or she is so used to being pampered,said the actress.

 In answering questions from Sayan Sinha, Kuhu Mukherjee, Nilanjana Dasgupta and Amit Ghosh on excessive parental pressure, Aparajita said: Todays parents are far more educated than our parents or grandparents were. As a result, their aspirations for their children are also much higher. They want their children to be a Sachin Tendulkar, a Shah Rukh Khan and an Amartya Sen all at the same time.

 Not for once do they realise how impossible that is and what adverse effect it could have on their tender minds. Parents have to be more patient in dealing with their children and instead of beating them up for every other reason, should sit down with the child and explain things.... That would bring in far more positive results. Parents should never try and impose their unfulfilled expectations on their children.

 On this note, the enjoyable and educative evening drew to a close.

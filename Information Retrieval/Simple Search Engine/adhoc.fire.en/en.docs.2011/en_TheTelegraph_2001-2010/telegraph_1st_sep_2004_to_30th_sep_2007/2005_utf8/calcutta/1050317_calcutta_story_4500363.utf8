 Bank-sleuth huddle over fake note bust 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A delegation from the Reserve Bank of India will reach the city on March 18 to discuss with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) the ramifications of a Rs 22.5-lakh fake-note racket busted a few weeks ago.

 The team, to be led by executive director P.K. Biswas, will include Sewali Chowdhury, chief general manager (issue department, eastern zone), who will help the CID figure out how the racketeers could flood the markets with ?neatly forged currency notes that almost had security inscriptions on them?.

 The notes also passed the ?error-free? laser test, prompting sleuths to suspect that they were printed using the latest technology and at a press where the staff was well aware of all identifying features of Indian notes. The only catch was the number of watermarks ? there were seven instead of the usual six.

 ?The RBI officials will discuss ways to prevent proliferation of such notes and additional measures to be taken to prevent printing of such notes,? said a CID officer said.

 Probing into the racket busted recently, sleuths said the notes seized from Sankar Acharya were meant for a Pakistani national, who had been camping in Howrah. 

 Acharya had carried the notes while returning from Khulna, Bangladesh, where he reportedly runs a business in dried fish. 

 It was later learnt that the notes had originated from Karachi. The Pakistani national, who was supposed to receive the notes, evaded arrested. 

 ?The racketeers had plotted to send the consignment to a spot in western Uttar Pradesh, where a team had made advance payments to the Pakistani national. The man had sensed danger after the consignment failed to reach him in time and slipped out,? said a CID officer.

 The probe revealed that the Pakistani national was in touch with operatives in Karachi through e-mail. He had reached Calcutta from Delhi. 

 The Reserve Bank-CID meeting will also focus on another racket busted last year by the city police. 

 Armed with a tip-off from Mumbai police, the cops had arrested a ?messenger? from Bangladesh, who had been camping in Beniapukur.

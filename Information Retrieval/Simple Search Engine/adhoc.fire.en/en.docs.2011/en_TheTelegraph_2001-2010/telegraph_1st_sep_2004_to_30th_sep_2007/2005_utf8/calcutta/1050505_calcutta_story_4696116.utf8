 A hospital with a history

 - Modern heart institute opens on Friday in condemned house

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles had washed their hands of it. So did Mark Tully. 

 Yet, Albert Victor Hospital, where Bidhan Chandra Roy had worked till his last days, has the potential of turning into the city?s best institute for cardiovascular sciences.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate the Rs 10-crore, state-of-the-art cardiac facility inside RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Friday. The public works department had sought to demolish the building 15 years ago.

 ?Its history goes back to 1912, when King George V and Queen Mary had donated Rs 5,000 to complete the hospital, named after Queen Victoria?s grandson, Albert Victor. We have retained the plaque and all other historical pieces as evidence. We wanted to turn it into the best centre for cardiac diseases and now, our dreams have finally been realised,? said Abhijit Banerjee, head of cardiology department and director of the new institute.

 Banerjee had earlier tried in vain to attract funds from Britain. ?I had told them that it was their duty to save the hospital and the building which was very much British, but they only thanked me for my efforts to save the building. The government then decided to mobilise grants to save the hospital,? said Banerjee. 

 Help came from unexpected quarters. The Armenian Church decided to allocate Rs 50 lakh for the first time in a non-private health facility. Funds rolled in slowly.

 Apart from a well-furnished lobby and reception desk, the hospital is equipped with one of the best cath labs, which can take care of cases of angioplasty, balloon valvoplasty and stent implants. 

 The cardiac operating theatre (OT) is equipped to carry out multiple bypass and valve replacement surgeries on a daily basis, apart from those for congenital heart diseases and paediatric cases. 

 ?Unlike other hospitals, the cath lab and the cardiac OT are separated by a door. If a patient crashes in the lab, we can immediately transfer him to the OT without delay,? Banerjee added.

 A 16-bed ICCU and a six-bed post-operative ICU will give a complete makeover to the hospital, which has special male and female cardiology wards. ?A 200-strong-capacity annexe for cardiac patients is in the pipeline,? Banerjee indicated. 

 The government is now scouting for good surgeons and medical staff to ensure that the institute achieves the standards it has set for itself.

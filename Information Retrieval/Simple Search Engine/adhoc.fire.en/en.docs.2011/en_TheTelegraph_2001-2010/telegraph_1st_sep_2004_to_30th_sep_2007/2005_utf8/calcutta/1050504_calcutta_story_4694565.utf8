The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Up so early to beat the heat

 Each week, Metro asks its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses are published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should offices start and end an hour early in summer? 

More responses will be printed next week

 Under Lights: Work on in full swing at Writers rsquo; Buildings 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur

 No, it is not a good idea. Thousands of employees throng offices in Calcutta from as far as Asansol, Kharagpur, Krishnagar, Bongaon and Diamond Harbour. Advancement of office time will force them to start from home at the break of dawn. An early end to office will be worse as they will have to leave for home in scorching heat. 

 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 

 Barasat

 The productivity of most employees suffers during summer as a result of the heat. Offices should ideally start between 8 am and 9 am and end between 3 pm and 4 pm in April, May and June. The change in office timings can be tried out. The heads of departments, trade unions and the chambers of commerce should be consulted before such a step is taken.

 Ashok Kumar Ram, 

 Garden Reach

 Yes. Offices should start and end an hour early in summer. This would enable employees to avoid the scorching sun and reach their workplace more comfortably. The move will also help to boost productivity. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, 

 Borehat

 If providing more comfort to office-goers is the objective behind the move, then I doubt that many people will benefit. During summer, the start of office an hour early would hardly make a difference for employees. But by leaving office earlier, they would have to brave the blazing sun. The current office schedule is time-tested and there is no better alternative. Some district courts, however, have special summer schedules. Besides, government employees anyway maintain their own schedule. 

 Samir Chandra Saha, 

 Baguiati

 It is a good idea. An early start and end to office would help employees avoid the worst of the heat. Change in office times would also ease the traffic congestion at peak hours. However, making government employees maintain the new timings would be difficult. They generally enter and leave office at their convenience. Proper vigilance would be needed to keep them from taking advantage of the new schedule.

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore 

 The tremendous heat during summer not only tires people physically, but also mentally. But the idea of a change in office timings in summer is unacceptable as that would not lessen the sufferings of office-goers. On the contrary, those living far away would find it difficult to reach office on time. The logistics associated with the shift would also be quite complicated.

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 It is good idea, but the administration must take steps to ensure that office-goers do not face a problem in reaching their workplace earlier. The rescheduling will to an extent shelter employees from the extreme heat. Such a practice was common during the Raj. Even now, offices in Jharkhand, Bihar, UP and MP follow a different schedule during summer.

Debjani Basu,

 Birati

 Start and end of office an hour early would provide comfort to employees. They will thus do their work energetically and the productivity will, no doubt, increase. The advancement of office hours will also help in efficient utilisation of sunlight. The power consumption at the offices should drop and the regular power cuts also would not hamper work significantly. I feel the timings of schools, colleges and courts should also be brought forward. 

 Soumya Verghese,

 Howrah

 I am not in favour of offices starting and winding up an hour early in summer. Office timings are not like a dress that can be changed at will. A new schedule will hamper and delay important work. Moreover, an hour?s change would not make much of a difference. It would be practical not to change the current office timings. 

 A. Bhattacharya,

 Narendrapur

 Offices should start and end an hour early in summer to protect employees from the intolerable heat. But then, it is unlikely that such a move would be implemented.

Pijush Nandi,

 Barasat

 Eighty per cent of the employees live far away from their offices. Given the regular traffic snarls on Calcutta roads, it is not feasible for them to attend office an hour earlier.

Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane

 The move will presumably help to beat the heat, but with office ending an hour early, the weary employees will have to bear the brunt of the afternoon sun. However, it is worth experimenting with the proposal. 

 Ananya Banerjee,

 Unique Park

 For smooth and steady work in offices, it is important that the employees are fit, comfortable and energetic. Excessive heat has a dampening effect on the efficiency of employees. To maximise the output from them, it would be beneficial for companies to start and end office an hour earlier.

 Nirmalya Biswas,

 Hridaypur Station Road

 In Scandinavian countries, different times are followed during summer and winter to maintain parity in sleeping patterns of the people. Since we have long days in summer, offices starting and ending an hour earlier would leave people with ample time for recreation.

 Ali Asgar Poonawala, 

 Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road

 It will not be of much use to start and end office an hour early in summer. The heat and the humidity level will be pretty much the same even at the changed timings.

Sohini Roy,

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue

 There should not be a summer schedule for offices. Advancing office timings by an hour, will not provide much respite to employees.

Sushma jalan,

 Alipore

 An early start and end to office during summer will provide slight relief to employees. However, I feel that an advanced summer schedule will be more effective in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, than in Calcutta. More than heat, humidity is a problem in Calcutta. Changed office times will not provide much protection against humidity. However, the idea is worth a try. It would also be a good idea to construct shades and provide for clean drinking water on the roadside. 

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge

 I don?t think advancing office timings by an hour would provide employees much of a respite from the sun. A better idea would be to advance the start of office and make the work week five-day. That way, employees would have a full-day?s rest from scorching sun and the employers would save on fuel, electricity, phone bills etc. Some companies have a system of a month-long summer vacation.

 Indranil Sengupta,

 Salt Lake

 I do not think a small shift in working hours during summer would be of any use. Instead, the office schedules need to be restructured, like in Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa. Offices can start at 7 in the morning and end at 3 pm. Then, the employees will at least reach office fresh.

Payel Bhattacharyya,

 Joka

 Rescheduling of office hours will take a heavy toll on productivity without providing much comfort to employees. The current timings have been followed by workers for a very long time. I don?t think the new-generation of employees have become too weak to work in the summer heat.

 Nidhi Dokania,

 Bangur Avenue

 Starting and ending offices an hour early is no way to fight the summer heat. Most modern offices have air-conditioners, so people do not have to suffer the heat once they reach office. Also, to modify office hours, banking and share trading hours need to changed also. It would be neither feasible nor practical to go in for such a massive exercise.

Tanima Dey,

 Habra

 I don?t think it would help much if offices start and end early in summer. In fact, such a move might pose several problems to people who have to commute a long way to office. Since summer vacations are also out of the question, I think the duration of office should be reduced by an hour in the summer months to provide some relief to employees.

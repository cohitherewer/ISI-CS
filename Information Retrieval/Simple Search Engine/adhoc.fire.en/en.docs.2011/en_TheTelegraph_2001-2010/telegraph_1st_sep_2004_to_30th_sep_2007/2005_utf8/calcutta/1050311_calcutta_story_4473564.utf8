The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Man in the mirror

Madhumita Bhattacharyya pens a tribute 

to MICHAEL JACKSON, from Thriller to Bad and nothing beyond

To some, he is nothing more than Wacko Jacko. And, 

clearly from the headlines breaking everyday, Michael Jackson has done much to 

deserve it. He has been accused of child molestation ? not once but twice. He 

has transformed himself through a series of horrifying cosmetic surgeries from 

a smart black boy (picture above) to something that closer resembles a 

white woman (picture right). He lives a strange, secretive life surrounded 

by animals, kids and a few lonely friends on a ranch he calls Neverland.

And his music? Well, it?s just not what it used to 

be.

But, once, it was really something.

In 1982, Michael and his music moonwalked their way 

into the hearts of 26 million people. That is the number of people who have bought 

Thriller, till date. Twenty years after its release, it continues to be 

the biggest phenomenon the music industry has ever seen, second only in sales 

by a million copies to Eagles? Greatest Hits.

Forgive the generation that grew up on N?Sync and 

Britney Spears their ignorance ? they are too young to know better. They see only 

the pale ghost of a man the world once knew.

To those even a few years older, MJ was everything.

His Jackson Five days may have missed many in our 

part of the globe, but for those on the wrong side of 20, Thriller is likely 

to have been one of the first LPs they picked off the shelf. They would have got 

goose bumps the first time it spun and Vincent Price?s devilish cackle was released. 

They would have been torn by the vocal tussle over a girl between Michael and 

a strange man. (Forgive them as well; MJ fans too were young once and knew not 

who Paul McCartney was. They soon found out!)

Once the vinyl stopped spinning, they gently, lovingly 

guided the needle back to the opening grooves, to hear it all over again.

History (not to be confused with the misguided 1995 

effort HIStory) was made.

Two years later, the magic was back. Forget the maudlin 

melody of Heal the World. (It later provided fodder for wisecracks everywhere. 

?Feel the World? was a joke just waiting to happen.)

Turn your attention instead to a tune authored in 

1985. Michael co-wrote the original ?we care? song ? We Are the World ? with 

Lionel Richie, to raise money for famine-afflicted Africa. It is one of the fastest-selling 

singles ever.

He followed it up two years later with another smash 

hit ? Bad. Though it didn?t rival its predecessor in terms of numbers, 

the album packed in some memorable tracks, including I Just Can?t Stop Loving 

You, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man in the Mirror, and, of course, 

the title song.

It wasn?t just the tunes, it was some classy showmanship 

too. MJ invented the music video as we know it, the first to have a storyboard 

to go with the theme of the song.

By the time the cable revolution came to India, it 

was too late to catch the thrill of the first real video. It was too late 

to be awed by the eerie zombies of Thriller, which broke every rule in 

the book.

But the country still watched with adoration and glee 

when Black or White hit the tube. Not only was the catchy song an instant 

success, it brought to the screen the cherubic face of McCaulay Home Alone 

Culkin, and what was, for its time, the use of stunning technology to morph 

a seemingly endless stream of faces, one into the other.

And that was probably the last time Jackson stole 

his fans? hearts, the last time he would razzle dazzle them with his own blend 

of vocal hiccups, smooth dancing and (crotch) gripping videos.

It was all downhill from there. For the Thriller 

generation, it is still hard to shake the memory of the old Michael, the man in 

the mirror with a heart and some sweet, sweet soul.

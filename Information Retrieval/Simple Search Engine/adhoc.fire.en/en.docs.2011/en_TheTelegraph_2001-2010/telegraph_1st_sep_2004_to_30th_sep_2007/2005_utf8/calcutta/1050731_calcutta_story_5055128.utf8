 Metro Recommends

 THE DVD

 (Landmark, Rs799) Alas, Ben Folds Five is only Ben Folds 

 now, having let go of its fifth member. All the more reason 

 to celebrate the music of the American band with this DVD. 

 On offer is a 1998 set from the show Sessions at West 

 54th, featuring tracks like Missing The War, 

 Kate and more. Bonus footage: an intimate look at 

 the band with a 45-minute film called Spare Reels. 

 THE EXHIBITION

 (Artisana, till August 5, 11 am to 7 pm) The event, presented 

 by the Crafts Council of West Bengal, offers a wide range 

 of traditional handicrafts and textiles, made by skilled 

 craftsmen, at affordable prices. 

 THE GAME

 (Ten 

 Sports, July 31, 2 pm) They looked more than a little wobbly 

 against the home team on Saturday. Will Team India, under 

 a new coach and captain, shake off its slumber when it takes 

 on West Indies on Sunday? Find out in the second ODI of the 

 Indian Oil Cup.

 Rain spurt in green prices

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcuttans who waited for winter to gorge on capsicum and green peas are a disappointed lot. Sporadic rain in January, together with other factors, has taken a toll on the supply of greens ? pushing up prices even in peak season.

 ?There is hardly any joy in buying winter vegetables this season,? rued Madhu Agarwal of Hindustan Park, a regular shopper at Gariahat market. 

 ?One has to think twice before buying vegetables in bulk, as prices are far above the usual winter prices? Even the prices of onions, palak and methi have gone up this year,? she pointed out.

 Horticulture department officials said the state is yet to recover from the deluge last October, which caused a loss of Rs 400 crore in the farm sector. Vegetables accounted for a substantial amount of the loss.

 Besides, the showers last month affected the standing crop in North and South 24-Parganas, Murshidabad, Hooghly and Nadia ? which together supply the bulk of the city?s vegetable requirement.

 ?Sowing of winter vegetables was delayed this year because of the floods,? a department official said. ?It was only in November that we could distribute vegetable kits, comprising seeds of cabbage, brinjal, tomato and lady?s finger, among farmers. Hence, the winter supply reached the market quite late,? he explained.

 Leafy vegetables, as well as those growing on climbing vines, like lauki, parwal and cucumber, are easily affected by rain. A few others, like cauliflower, tend to get infested with pests.

 ?The situation this season has been aggravated as the supply from Bihar and Jharkhand dried up because of the Assembly elections,? said Krishna Singh, general secretary, Posta Goods Transport Operators? Association.

 Thirty truckloads of vegetables ? especially cauliflowers, cabbages and bananas ? usually come to Calcutta every day during this time of the year.

 The third factor that made vegetables rare was the marriage season, which further pushed up the prices between late January and mid-February.

 ?The prices of green peas, tomatoes and capsicum are simply refusing to dip,? lamented Arup Nag, a caterer and the general secretary of Decorators? Samannay Samiti.

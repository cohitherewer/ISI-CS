 True to its name, Taj Khazana, the lifestyle store at the Alipore star address, has always been a treasure trove of elegance. The latest offering from the store is a festive line of apparels, home d?cor and jewellery.

 The sari section spoils you for choice. There are silks embellished with kantha work in rich maroons and blacks, kantha crepes, tussar, baluchuri, georgettes, chiffons and Dhakais. Also on offer are embroidered salwar suits, kurtis and jackets. Pretty scarves in silk and even hand-painted ones are good buys for the coming winter months.

 Women on the move during the day can opt for pure leather handbags in shades like burgundy, tan, black, brown and mustard, while ornate potlis and kantha stitch totes are suitable for evenings out.

 The jewellery corner is an assortment of earrings, pendants, necklaces, rings and chokers in pure silver as well as precious and semi-precious stones. The mens section includes cotton printed shirts, kurtas, silk ties, kantha sherwanis and mufflers in cashmere and pashmina.

 Regal-looking sofa sets and centre tables in silver come adorned with ornate carvings. Vases, figurines and artefacts in white wood, sandalwood and gold-plated marble stand out. The home d?cor section also comprises original Tibetan tankhas and ivory-hilt paintings. 

 Paintings by artists like Chhaya Parekh and Kiran Mohinder are on offer. Bedcovers and cushion covers in earthy hues are worth a look.

 We house stuff that is exclusive and almost regal, but there is also something for everyone out here, says store manager Simanti Nair.

 Mans world

 You can feast your eyes on an array of designer mens wear crafted by some of the fashion honchos of the country at the Grain of Salt banquets on Sunday. 

 Rohit Bal, Ashish Soni, JJ Valaya, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Priyadarshani Rao, H2O, Seyam, 99 Grams, Medhavini Khaitan? the list of designers showcasing their works reads like the whos who of the Indian fashion fraternity.

 As most designers focus their attention towards the fairer sex, this exhibition showcases a refreshing change towards a series of innovative and critically-praised collections targeted at the male clientele, says organiser Aditi Kohli, who boasts her own exclusive studio on Syed Amir Ali Avenue. 

 The collections on display include mens wear for every occasion and taste ? from glam to golf and sleek sophistication to essentially casual.

 The exhibition will be on between 11 am and 8 pm at the 22, Camac Street stop.

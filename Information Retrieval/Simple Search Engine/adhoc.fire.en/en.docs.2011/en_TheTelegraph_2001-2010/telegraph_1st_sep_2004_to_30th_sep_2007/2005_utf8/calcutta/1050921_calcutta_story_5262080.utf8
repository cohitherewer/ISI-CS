 It was launched in 2002, and despite a lack of advertising, became a huge hit. Now, the chilli pepper spray is back in a new avatar, courtesy Cobra.

 In its new version, launched a couple of months ago in Delhi and now in Calcutta, Cobra Magnum, the ?self-defence spray? is available in three sizes, priced at Rs 399, Rs 499 and Rs 599, ?to cater to the growing demand?.

 ?There are a few modifications, like the cheapest one is smallest in size, the hand clasp is a little different as is the nozzle. The Rs 599 one is the most popular,? says Vicky Singh, spokesperson for AAX Global, the company that manufactures Cobra Magnum. 

 Singh is in town, checking out dealers interested in retailing the product from their stores.

 Businessmen, police officers, community watch teams and even zoo wardens are target buyers of Cobra Magnum. 

 But the majority of users are ?women, ranging from homemakers and working women to college students and call centre employees?, says Singh. 

 ?The market does vary,? she admits. ?For instance, in Delhi, the largest group of customers is women. But in Mumbai, the Cobra cans are more in demand among businessmen, since they carry a lot of cash.?

 In Calcutta, while it isn?t quite the craze it has become in some other metros, the demand is ?definitely according to our expectations?, adds Singh, both among women and businessmen. 

 The aim now is to explore and expand the market further, increase awareness and reach out to target groups through more dealers.

 Made from the extract oleoresin capsaicin, which makes chillies hot, Cobra Magnum is 10 times stronger than chilli powder. The can gets emptied in 10 seconds when pressed continuously. 

 The user just has to aim the nozzle in the direction of the attacker and spray. A half-second burst is usually enough, and it can go up to six feet. It takes effect immediately on contact. 

 Cobra Magnum is not lethal, but it causes severe burning on exposed skin and temporary blindness. It is painful for at least half an hour to 45 minutes, but its effects are not permanent. 

 ?Which is why people prefer it to weapons like guns,? observed the spokesperson.

 The company is also working on other devices like security horns. ?But the legal process of licensing is long, so it takes time. The chilli pepper took two years to be launched. We are working on the process, slowly but surely,? summed up Singh. The Bangalore-based company was started by Rana Singh, director of AAX Global.

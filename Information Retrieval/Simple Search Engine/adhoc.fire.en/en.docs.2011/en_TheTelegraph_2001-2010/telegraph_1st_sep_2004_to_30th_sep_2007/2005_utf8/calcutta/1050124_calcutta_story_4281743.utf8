 Job courses at primary schools

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities plan to wind up their primary schools and convert them into vocational training institutions. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said on Sunday that the existing schools and infrastructure could be utilised to run vocational training centres for the economically-weaker section and slum-dwellers.

 ?We don?t think there is any need for the CMC to run primary schools, as the state government has made education free up to the Madhyamik level. The schools were opened during the Raj for imparting free primary education to poor children,? said the mayor.

 He added that of the 2,617 primary schools in Calcutta, 1,100 are free and run by the state education department. 

 Mayoral council member (slum development) Javed Ahmed Khan said a large number of teachers were due to retire shortly from the primary schools run by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). ?So, it will be easier for us to convert the schools into vocational training centres,? he added.

 The CMC now runs 242 primary schools, in which the teacher-student ratio is 1:42. According to a civic estimate, the teacher?student ratio will shoot up to 1:130 by June, as over two-thirds of the teachers will retire from service.

 According to Khan, international funding agencies have advised the CMC to wind up the schools. They have pointed out that education does not come under the purview of civic activities, following the 74th amendment (Nagar Palika) to the Constitution.

 ?The funding agencies have said that if the schools are closed down, the civic body will save Rs 16 crore annually. The vocational training centres, on the other hand, will enhance the scope of self-employment and help change the financial condition of the youth of the slum areas,? said Khan.

 ?Automobile servicing, TV repairing, electrical work, tailoring, cloth-printing, cookery, repairing of mobile phones and electronic gadgets, masonry, ikebana, beauticians? training, hair-cutting and plumbing are some of the courses being thought about,? added Khan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, cable player IV

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Government efforts at regulation through cable count were stillborn. Addressability attempts through means like conditional access system came a cropper, too.

 Now, the buzz in the local cable trade is about the entry of a new player ? Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services ? promising to play the game by the rules.

 The multi-system operator (MSO) is scheduled to start operations on September 1, taking the MSO count ? which had dropped to three after the takeover of Indian Cable Net by SitiCable in May ? back to four.

 At the broadcaster level, last-minute negotiations are on to provide the decoder boxes to the new MSO, which plans to reach out to over 1.5 lakh households in areas such as Dum Dum, stretches of VIP Road, BT Road, Dunlop and pockets of Salt Lake.

 ?Almost everything is in place and the broadcasters have agreed in principle to provide their signals,? said Mrinal Chatterjee, one of the promoters of Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services. 

 The new MSO also plans to offer broadband Internet and basic telephony services in the near future.

 One of the problems, claims Chatterjee, is ?indirect pressure? on broadcasters from existing MSOs.

 Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Services is expected to carve a subscriber chunk out of SitiCable ? from which it had broken away ? as well as from Manthan and CableComm.

 ?They are talking about an idealistic model of operation, claiming they will not place channels according to carriage fees but according to TRP ratings. We really doubt whether they will be able to do this,? said a spokesperson for an existing MSO.

 But for other cable operator bodies mulling breakaway options, the success or failure of the new player could set the course of action for them.

 ?It will be encouraging for people like us planning a similar independent set-up where the operators would be shareholders and the control would be with them,? offered an official of Srishti, which provides service to the Behala area.

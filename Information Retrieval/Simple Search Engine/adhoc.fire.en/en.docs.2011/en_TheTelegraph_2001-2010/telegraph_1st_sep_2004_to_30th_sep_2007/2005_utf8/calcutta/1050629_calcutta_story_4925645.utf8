 Debate on doctor arrest rule

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcuttans will debate on July 1 the government?s decision that a doctor cannot be arrested on charges of negligence till a medical board clears the case.

 The programme, coinciding with Doctor?s Day, will be attended by leading medical practitioners, legal experts and human rights activists, including state rights panel chairman Shyamal Sen.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and minister of state Pratyush Mukherjee, too, have been invited.

 ?Apart from the government?s directive, the speakers will debate on various aspects of medicine and law,? said Moloy Ganguly, secretary of People for Better Treatment, organisers of the event. The association has also filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court against the government?s stand on arresting errant doctors.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee decision that a doctor cannot be arrested even if there existed prima facie evidence of negligence against him, has kicked off a controversy. Among those who are backing the move is Indian Medical Association.

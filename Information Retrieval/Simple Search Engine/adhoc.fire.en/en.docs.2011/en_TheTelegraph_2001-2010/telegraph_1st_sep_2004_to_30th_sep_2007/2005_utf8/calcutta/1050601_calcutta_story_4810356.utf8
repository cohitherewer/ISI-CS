The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech major touches base with high growth plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over 1,500 on the rolls to begin with and the potential to touch 5,000; initial investment of around Rs 50 crore, to be hiked closer to Rs 150 crore over the next few years ? GE Capital International Services (Gecis) has big plans for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Bengal. 

 ?Calcutta should be, can be and would be the intellectual capital of India. The momentum is growing and Calcutta is progressing,? said Pramod Bhasin, president and CEO, Gecis Global, on Tuesday, as he announced the company?s decision to set up its fifth business process outsourcing (BPO) centre in Sector V.

 The Gurgaon-headquartered company, a leader in business services and technology solutions, has centres in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Jaipur.

 Bhasin, whom the West Bengal government has been courting for the past three years with the request to set up a centre in the city, was in town to receive the letter of allotment of land from G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, information technology (IT).

 ?We are very happy with this development. A Gecis facility in the city will have a positive impact on the branding of the state,? said Gautama.

 The new facility, to come up on a three-acre plot in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), with a built-up area of around 100,000 sq ft, will be operational by the second quarter of 2006.

 The centre will provide an entire gamut of specialised services, like analytics, finance and accounting, and software solutions to its clients and the headcount at the complex will be around 1,500 in two years.

 Gecis already has a presence at the Bengal Intelligent Park in Saltlec, operating out of 26,000 sq ft.

 ?We recruit heavily from Calcutta as we are interested in tapping the intellectual quality of the state. There are reasons to believe that we can take the number to 5,000 over time and in that case, the investment will be no less than Rs 150 crore,? observed Bhasin. 

 Gecis employs over 19,000 people and with business growing, the company plans to ramp up the headcount to 24,000 by the end of this year and 30,000 by the end of next year.

 According to the company?s estimates, over 25 per cent of its employees are from this part of the country and they will be given a chance to relocate to the Calcutta centre.

 ?We expect that in two years, this centre will contribute around eight to 10 per cent of the company?s revenues and I think that?s just the tip of the iceberg,? said Bhasin.

 The company is looking at revenues of around $ 500 million this year and the forecast for 2007 is over $ 750 million.

 Gecis also has plans to tie up with some universities in Bengal to impart skills in risk management, data mining and warehousing and high-end software project management. ?Training is vital and we want to join hands with academic institutes to develop the right skill-set among students,? said Bhasin.

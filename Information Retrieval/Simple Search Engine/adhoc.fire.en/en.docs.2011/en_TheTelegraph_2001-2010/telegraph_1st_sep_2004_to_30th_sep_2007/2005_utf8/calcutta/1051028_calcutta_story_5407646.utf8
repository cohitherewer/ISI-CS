The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Master plan for township

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Representatives of a joint-venture company met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday and submitted a master plan on the redevelopment of Batanagar, a landmark on the city?s southern fringes.

 The project will be executed by Riverfront Holdings Private Limited, a special-purpose vehicle company set up by Bata India Ltd and Calcutta Metropolitan Group. 

 The scheme entails setting up a modern township, on 262 acres, in place of the old, dilapidated buildings and vacant spaces. The Batanagar estate is spread over 300-odd acres.

 According to municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, redeveloping Batanagar will include setting up of residential and commercial buildings, office estates, schools, hotels and clubs and a golf course, among others.

 ?The chief minister?s response was very encouraging,? said Hemant Sahai, chairman of Riverfront Holdings.

 ?Bata will continue to function. The area around the factory will be redeveloped. Employees living in Batanagar will be shifted to new houses within the township,? he explained.

 Bhattacharya said the land character needs to be changed ? from an industrial area to one that encompasses residential, commercial and industrial activities. For this, clearances are required from several government departments. The pleas for the approvals are pending.

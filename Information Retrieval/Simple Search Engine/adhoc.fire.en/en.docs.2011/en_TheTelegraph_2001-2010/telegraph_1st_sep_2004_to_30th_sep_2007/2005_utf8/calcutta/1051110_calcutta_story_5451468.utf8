 Conduit that kept canal navigable

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A landslide on the southern embankment of the Maratha Ditch in Galiff Street, north Calcutta, led to the discovery of the skills of British engineers, who, 263 years ago, kept the canal navigable round-the-clock without the low-lying city areas becoming flooded and the drains spilling over during a high tide.

 The engineers of the state irrigation department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) discovered that the underground brick conduit under Galiff Street, which was erroneously taken for a brick sewer for the past 50 years, was actually a brick channel to feed the canal during a high tide when lockgates would remain closed.

 There was a lockgate at the river point of the moat and it was lowered during a high tide to prevent flooding of the city?s low-lying areas.

 In those days of early British rule, trade with East Bengal (now Bangladesh) via the Bidyadhari river used to be carried out along this important channel. 

 Closing the lockgate might cause loss of draught to the freight boats. Hence, to feed the moat during a high tide to maintain its navigability, the British engineers constructed an 8 ft x 5 ft brick conduit to act as an underground invisible link between the Hooghly and the Ditch. It runs 14 ft underground along Galiff Street from the Lockgate point.

 The moat was excavated in 1742, 15 years before the Battle of Plassey, to save the city from the Marathas and hence its name.

 During the past 50 years, the civic drainage and sewerage engineers, mistaking it for an underground brick sewer, connected all the drainage lines of the locality with this conduit. It caused siltation and scouring of the conduit, which eventually collapsed last month during the week-long post-Puja rain.

 The sheds built under the hawker rehabilitation scheme have come up right on the 260-year-old underground brick conduit which has to bear a deadweight now. 

 Engineers of the state irrigation department think the discovery of the underground feeder conduit will brighten the chances of introducing a ferry service between Lockgate and New Town, Rajarhat, by February.

 The city civic authorities and the state irrigation department are taking up an ambitious project to revamp Galiff Street, the tram track along the road, the embankment of the canal and the collapsed brick sewer. 

 A team of engineers of the state irrigation department and the CMC, led by MP Sudhanshu Sil, local MLA Rajdeo Goala , municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera visited Galiff Street on Tuesday morning. The project cost will be over Rs 20 crore. The CMC will also take up realignment of the sewer lines.

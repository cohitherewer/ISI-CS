The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tourists top applicant list

 M.K.Singh, regional passport officer, met readers of The Telegraph in his office to answer their queries. Participants included Sourish Misra, Ershad Ahmed, Sulekha Chaudhury, Gautam Bagchi, Sandip Banerjee, Asim Majumdar, Tathagata Bose, Mahesh Datta, Sanjay Ghosh, Chanchal Das and Dinesh Agarwal

Sandip Banerjee: Which group dominates among passport-seekers in Calcutta ? students, businessmen or tourists?

 About 500 passports are issued every day by our office. Tourists top the list of applicants, followed by businessmen and students. 

Tathagata Bose: Can people with a criminal past obtain passports?

 An applicant is asked to mention the details of offences committed in the past five years, if he has been convicted by an Indian court and imprisoned for two years or more. 

Sourish Misra: The problem of Bangladeshis infiltrating into India has reached alarming proportions. Most Bangladeshis probably do not take the trouble of applying for passports before entering our country.

 It is true that the infiltration problem is on the rise, but you cannot assume that the majority of Bangladeshis are infiltrators. The Indian High Commission offices in Dhaka, Chittagong and Rajsahi issue over 4,000 visas every day.

Gautam Bagchi: How many passport-related complaints are lying pending in your office?

 I look into all the complaints personally and there is not a single pending case at this point of time. It has been possible due to the cooperation of the principal home secretary and the city and district police authorities. 

Asim Majumdar: After applying for passport, one has to visit your office three to four times to find out the status of the application. It is a waste of time. 

 I don?t know why you bother to visit the office so many times. You can instead send an e-mail or a fax (2225-4762). I myself go through the e-mails and faxes.

 However, we don?t entertain e-mails or faxes from unknown addresses or numbers. After we introduced this service, some brokers started sending e-mails or faxes to us on behalf of their clients. We found out that the faxes were being sent from phone booths. 

Sanjay Ghosh: What steps have you taken to keep brokers out of the regional passport office?

 Some people are fond of taking the help of brokers. More than 20 per cent of the applicants take their help even though there is no need.

Gautam Bagchi: Your application form is printed in English? Do you think everyone who wants to go abroad knows English?

 You will be happy to know that the Calcutta office is the first regional office to publish the passport information booklet in regional languages.

Chanchal Das: What should I do if I lose my passport? 

 Immediately inform the local police station and the nearest passport office or the Indian embassy. Unless you do this, you will remain liable for any misuse of the lost passport. The passport is not your personal property. If the issuing authority asks you to return the passport, you are legally bound to deposit it.

Mahesh Datta: Why can?t passport application forms be filled in pencil or red ink?

 The computer which goes through the applications is programmed to recognise only blue or black ink.

Dinesh Agarwal: Why are literate people asked to put their thumb impression on passport applications? 

 Thumb impressions have nothing to do with literacy. They are preserved for verification by the airport immigration office.

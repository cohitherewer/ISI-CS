The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Remix stars: Pop pourri

 Remixed to rock rsquo;n rsquo; roll 

 Remix sells. From golden oldies with jhankaar beats to school kids with attitude. And now it?s Calcutta?s time to get jiggy with it. The four main characters of STAR One?s popular serial Remix will camp at the Golden Park hotel this Saturday for a jam session with DJ Akash at the restobar Fusion.

 The serial, set in an elite school for the kids of the rich and famous, revolves around the four characters of Tia, Anvesha, Yuvi and Ranveer, whose love for music not only brings them together but also gets them to create their own band, named Remix. Apart from the loveable characters, the music by Pritam and vocals by Popstar band Aasma has made the serial very popular among school and college kids.

 ?We are showing what?s happening in schools around the country and that?s what has caught on with everyone,? says Karan Wahi, who plays the role of Ranveer. ?The crushes, the fights, the groups ? they are all there.?

 For Raj Singh Arora, who plays Yuvi, coming to Calcutta is a dream come true. ?We all have great expectations from the city. Apart from a lot of friends, my first girlfriend was from there.?

 This is also one of the rare occasions when a jam session has been planned exclusively for school and college crowds. ?We are trying to get those young people for the afternoon jig who cannot party at night,? says Akash.

 Finding Neverland: Turning back time

 A place where children never grow old or have worries, a story that caught the imagination of kids and adults alike and continues to do so a century after it was written. Finding Neverland was nominated in several categories at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Released earlier this year, the film grossed over $116,410,613. Catch the Indian television premiere on STAR Movies on June 3, at 9 pm. 

 The film is loosely based on the true story of Scottish author JM Barrie and his friendship with the Llewelyn-Davies boys and their dying mother in London in 1904, which resulted in his most famous work, the Peter Pan play. The film stars Johnny Depp as Barrie and Kate Winslet as the boys? mother Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, as well as Freddy Highmore as Peter Llewelyn-Davies.

 Making a guest appearance is Laura Duguid, JM Barrie?s god-daughter and the daughter of Nico, the youngest of the real Llewelyn-Davies boys. She plays the part of the theatregoer who at the party following Peter Pan?s premiere suggests that young Peter Llewelyn-Davies must be the real Peter Pan.

 Says Depp: ?In life there are many good and bad things that happen to us but there are very few of us who overcome adversity and are inspired by it to write a story, like Barrie did. At the end of filming Finding Neverland, I cried. I was overcome with emotion when we finished working because I understood that imagination and fantasy are essential in a world like this one.?

 The film was originally titled Neverland, but due to an independent film?s release in 2003 with the same name, Miramax was forced to change the title. During filming, Dustin Hoffman lost the tip of a finger and performed one day of shooting on morphine.

 With India continuing to produce films aplenty ? mainstream, crossover, multiplex, etc ? film reading and film appreciation courses are growing by the day. 

 After the overwhelming response last year, Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre is again presenting a film-reading course this year from June 1 to 14.

 Open to students between the ages of 15 and 20, the intensive course, simply titled Reading Film, ?discusses film as a text using film screenings, illustrated lectures by different faculty members, interactive discussions, reading material and exercises?. 

 There is also a brief introduction to the history of world cinema and its different periods from the Italian Neorealist to the French New Wave, from the De Sicas to the Truffauts. 

 With some of the most noted names as members of the faculty ? Father Gaston Roberge, Biren Das Sharma, Moinak Biswas, Gopalan Mullik, Amit Patra, Sukanya Ghosh ? the course at Rs 1,500 is a steal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Alone at home and slain

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Tuesday recovered the body of 70-year-old Tulsidas Roy, a former employee of a private firm in Dhaka, from his apartment in Dakshin Roynagar, Regent Park.

 An unnatural death case has been started, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 Roy had come to live in the city about three months ago. His family members are still in Dhaka, where his son works in an embassy. In Calcutta, Roy was looked after by relatives, who live nearby.

 ?He was last seen on Sunday afternoon. Today, as a foul smell emanated from the apartment, we informed Regent Park police station. The cops broke open the door and discovered the body,? said Subhas Dey, Roy?s next-door neighbour.

 The body, he added, was lying in a pool of blood on the bedroom floor. ?Roy was naked and a napkin was found beside the body.? 

 Another neighbour, Manatosh Mirdha, suspects Roy had been murdered. 

 ?He was a rich man. Recently, he had a quarrel with one of his relatives,? he said. Several of his neighbours said Roy was an introvert. ?He would talk to us only if we asked him any questions,? Mirdha added.

 Shyamal Roy, a relative, said: ?A man sent by the local cable operator knocked on the apartment?s door in the morning. But there was no response.? He, however, claimed that the death was natural.

 Police are waiting for Roy?s family members to reach the city. ?They are supposed to come tonight. Only after talking to them will we be able to know whether Roy had any dispute over property with any of his relatives,? police superintendent Gupta said.

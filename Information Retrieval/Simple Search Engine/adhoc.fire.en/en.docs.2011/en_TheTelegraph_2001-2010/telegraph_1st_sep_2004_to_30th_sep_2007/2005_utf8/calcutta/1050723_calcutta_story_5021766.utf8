 Brunch binge

 Start off with grilled meat, crunch into a dosa, polish off pasta and risotto. All this and more is part of the Sunday Gourmet Brunch at La Terrasse, the multi-cuisine restaurant at The Oberoi Grand.

 The spread, which has been laid out since July 1, includes an assortment of dishes from various cuisines. For a breakfast bite, make a beeline for the omelette station where eggs are whisked up with crispy bacon, diced ham, spinach, tomato, onion, broccoli and roasted mushrooms.

 Move on to pastas and risotto with a selection of vegetables and meats. There is a choice of hot dogs and burgers from the grill and crepe counter serving crabmeat with tomato and leek and mushroom with spinach. 

 On the buffet table there is a spread of four non-vegetarian and six vegetarian salads. Most people only get time on Sunday afternoons to spend with their family and friends. At La Terrasse, we have a host of dishes to add variety to a brunch, says a spokesperson. The meal comes at Rs 815.

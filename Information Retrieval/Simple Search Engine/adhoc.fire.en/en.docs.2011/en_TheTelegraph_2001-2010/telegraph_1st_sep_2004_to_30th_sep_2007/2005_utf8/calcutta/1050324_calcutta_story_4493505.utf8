The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sudan, Congo amp; toxic mix

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 The city has been flooded with foodstuff adulterated with colouring agents and additives that are not only carcinogenic but can adversely affect the brain and the eyes. 

 People were shocked when the UK government stumbled upon a deadly carcinogen colouring agent, Sudan-1, in a popular sauce from Mumbai and pickles from other parts of India.

 Not just Sudan-1, non-branded chilli powder in Calcutta has been found to be mixed with Congo Red, another harmful colouring material that affects the brain and eyes.

 Officials said some ice-creams are regularly laced with metanil yellow, a harmful carcinogenic chemical. The substance is also added to biryani to give it a look as if zafran has been mixed.

 Reports with Metro reveal that there seems to be nothing called safe food in Calcutta anymore ? food adulteration has been so rampant that the authorities have been forced to launch an offensive. 

 According to medical experts, nearly 60 per cent of all types of cancer ? particularly in the colon, bladder, pancreas, breast and liver ? are caused by carcinogen-rich food.

 ?We have seized samples from licensed restaurants in the city. The samples include soft drinks, chicken and biryani. We believe several restaurants use non-permissible additives like metanil yellow while cooking biryani,? said Atanu Mukherjee, officer-on-special duty (health), Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 ?More such raids are being planned,? he added.

 Officials have identified some pockets ? spread across Burrabazar, Canning Street, Beleghata, east Calcutta and Sonarpur ? where food adulteration takes place. Adulterated food items worth Rs 2 crore is distributed from Burrabazar alone.

 Some units have been identified on Strand Bank Road and Strand Road, where costly edible oils are adulterated with mineral, palm and rice bran oils.

 ?We cannot catch the guilty red-handed because of their nexus with a section of law-enforcing officers. They almost always come to know about the raids and escape,? said Mukherjee.

 Agencies like the Federation of Consumers? Association (FCA) have been carrying out surveys at the behest of the Union consumer affairs ministry over the last few years and the results are startling.

 ?Cakes, pastries and biscuits contain tartazin beyond permissible limits, causing asthma and vertigo in children. Indigo carmine, which causes asthma, is used to preserve sweets, meat and fish. Cancer-causing metanil yellow and chromates are used in sweets and turmeric powder,? said FCA president Mala Banerjee. 

 Experts from All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health and Kalyani University added that they had found cancer-causing material like mercury, lead, chromium, and hexavalent chromium in fish and vegetables.

 ?It?s well established that our food chain has become contaminated with carcinogens,? said K.J. Nath, president of Institute of Public Health Engineers.

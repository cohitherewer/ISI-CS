 From boardroom talk to Bollywood tunes

 The occasion: From seminars to exhibitions, from heated discussions to fresh innovations, from new concepts to tested solutions, the 2005 chapter of Infocom has been another roaring ride through the world of IT. 

 If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjjee hogged the spotlight in the afternoon, Thursday evening belonged to Kunal Ganjawala.

 The Bollywood singer, made famous by a Murder, brought the biz boys out of the boardrooms and took them on a musical journey that really rocked. 

 The cocktails and dinner do that followed at the Hyatt Regency poolside rounded off the entertainment evening on Day II of Infocom 2005, organised by Nasscom and Businessworld. 

 The man: Kunal was just another singer doing the rounds of sound studios and music directors trying to get a Bollywood break. After a host of ad jingles, his Saathiya song humdum suniyo re did become a chartbuster, but couldnt change his fortunes.

 It took a Bheegey honth tere from Murder for Kunal to have a killing. Since then, he has roared his way from one hit to another. His incredible vocal prowess was on full-throated display on Thursday evening when he kickstarted the show with Kaal dhamaal.

 The show: The packed Hyatt banquets didnt need a hip-shaking Shah Rukh Khan or a sizzling Malaika Arora to make the most of the Salim-Sulaiman number. 

 What followed was an amazing array of songs ? from the silken Bheegey honth tere and the soothing Shehzaadi hai koi to the racy Channa vey and the romantic Dil keh raha hai.

 The songs were punctuated by interesting anecdotes, like how Salman Khan would ask him in his phoren accent about his singing and how an obscure Sheesha song would be lapped up by the Dutch and the South Americans with elan.

 The response: They may be prim and propah at work, but at play, with Kunal egging them on, the IT brigade swayed and shouted, clapped and cheered, and even greeted him with salaam namaste as the Mumbai man rounded off the evening in style.

 And when Kunal crowned Calcuttans the best audience anywhere in the world, the banquet brigade went berserk, even singing Janabeali in a chorus that could have reached Camac Street.

 Some even joined Kunal on stage while others were content capturing him on their mobile cameras.

 The party: After enthralling everyone for an hour of pulsating music, Kunal left straightaway to catch a flight to London, with a promise that he would be back in the city three more times before this year gives way to the next: on 18, 23 and 31 December. 

 The action then shifted to the poolside where food and beverages awaited everyone.

 While the bartenders got busy mixing mocktails and cocktails, the dinner counters were chock-a-block, what with Schezwan Fish and Kasha Mangsho on offer. 

 For the sweet ending, there were slices of chocolate mud cake and hot gulab jamuns.

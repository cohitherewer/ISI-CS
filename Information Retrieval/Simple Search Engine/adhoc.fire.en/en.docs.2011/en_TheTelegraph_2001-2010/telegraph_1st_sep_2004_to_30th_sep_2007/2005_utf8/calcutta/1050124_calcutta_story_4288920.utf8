The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sewage treatment plant ready yet idle

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 A sewage treatment plant, constructed by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) with funds from the Centre, has been lying idle since completion three months ago.

 Reason: urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who is supposed to inaugurate the Mahestala plant, has just come to know that the plant is ready. 

 Mahestala municipality chairman Kali Bhandari said: ?I have spoken to the minister about the matter. We want him to unveil the plant and are waiting for a suitable date.? 

 When contacted by Metro, minister Bhattacharya said he was not aware about the status of the project. ?A number of CMDA projects are being completed. If this one is ready, it can start functioning as soon as the departmental report is submitted,? he added.

 With no end in sight for the delay in commissioning the project, around 500,000 people in the Mahestala area, on the southern fringes of the city, fear this monsoon will see a repeat of last year?s nightmarish experience. 

 As the drains are clogged with refuse dumped indiscriminately, even a brief spell of rain or a smart shower inundates the locality.

 Set up at a cost of Rs 5 crore, provided by the Centre in phases under the Ganga Action Plan, the sewage treatment system is designed to tackle the problem. Besides, it will also treat waste water so it can be used for various domestic purposes, except drinking.

 The project, known as the Switch Treatment Plant, has come up on a 30-acre plot. It comprises two main pumping stations (MPS). 

 The first MPS (built at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore) started functioning in 1999, but it caters to adjoining areas, such as Behala and Garden Reach. 

 Reacting to resentment among Mahestala residents who felt cheated, the CMDA decided to set up a second MPS at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore. 

 The second station was meant exclusively for the Mahestala region.

 According to CMDA executive engineer D.K. Pandit, MPS II is ready since November, except for some minor work, such as building a boundary wall. 

 ?But the unit can start functioning any day,? Pandit asserted. 

 A significant feature of the second pumping station is its electrical installation, which was set up with imported technology under the guidance of Japanese experts.

 Local residents suspect the entire amount spent on the second phase of the sewage treatment system will finally go down the drain.

 ?Though the work was completed three months ago, it could not be commissioned because of red-tapism,? complained Pranabandhu Nag, general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee.

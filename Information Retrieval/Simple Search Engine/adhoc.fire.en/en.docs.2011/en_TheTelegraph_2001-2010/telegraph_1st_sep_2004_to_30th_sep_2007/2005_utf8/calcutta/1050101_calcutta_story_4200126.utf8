The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Newsmakers 2005

Nandana Dev Sen

actress

The infatuated girl in Goutam Ghose?s Gudiya 

went missing for eight long years. After dabbling in theatre, scripting, production 

and acting in a string of foreign films, Nandana Dev Sen is all set to resurface 

in Bollywood, and how!

Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black finds this younger 

daughter of Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen and writer Nabaneeta Dev Sen playing Rani 

Mukherjee?s screen sister. 

Nandana has also played Beatrice in the off-Broadway 

production Modgliani, while Delhi-based NGO Rahi had her performing for 

its play on incest. Of the films that kept her busy, the literature student from 

Harvard University earned loads of accolades for her lead role in Hunt Hoe?s Canadian 

venture Seducing Maarya. 

2005 is sure to see a lot of this vivacious girl from 

Hindustan Park ? sharing screen space with Amitabh Bachchan in Black, opposite 

Anil Kapoor in Ram Gopal Varma?s Galti Se and with Ajay Devgan in Mani 

Shankar?s Tango Charlie.

Parambrata Chatterjee

actor

2003 caught him exerting his grey cells and chasing 

goons with Big Brother Feluda. This year finds Topshe in the big league, yet again. 

Parambrata is playing Soumitra Chatterjees younger son and Sabyasachi Chakrabortys 

younger brother in Sandip Rays next feature film, Nishijaapon. The 

intense tale of relationships being put to the test under strange circumstances 

has Raima Sen playing Parambrata?s love interest.

While the 24-year-old is busy shooting in Kalimpong, 

a host of soaps and telefilms awaits his return back home. The megaserials Swapner 

Rong Neel, Kon She Aalor Swapno Niye and Alokito Ek Indu, has 

our man at the centre of the family dramas. Waiting in queue is Tridib Poddars 

yet-untitled film, co-starring Jishu Sengupta and Reshmi Ghosh, which will take 

Parambrata to Canada for the shooting.

Neel Dutt

musician

?The guitar was always lying around at my home but 

I never bothered to pick it up.? But ever since Neel Dutt did that at the age 

of 13, he hasn?t looked back. Today, the talented 25-year-old is arguably the 

most promising solo musician in the city. Having been in many a stage musical 

during his school days, Neel started jamming with dad Anjan Dutt from 1993 and 

went on to play the guitar in his debut album Shunte Ki Chao? 

?I never learnt the guitar formally,? says Neel. ?Amit 

Datta stayed in my para and he helped me out. Once I started playing, I 

also began writing my own songs, which I never dared to sing anywhere. Then once 

into college, I started composing jingles. Baba (Anjan) got into television and 

I started doing background scores for his telefilms. I even acted in a serial 

called Half Chocolate.?

With 35 telefilms under his belt, Neel decided to 

give up his copywriting job at Bates as he took up the assignment of lyricist-composer 

for his father?s second feature film, Bow Barracks Forever. ?The music 

is very nostalgic and hummable and very Calcutta. The album should come out in 

end-January. I always knew how special this film is for Baba and so I made him 

sing the title song.?

There are more film assignments in hand with Neel 

composing for the six-in-one film Chhoy and the Bengali thriller Ananya 

Apartments. ?This year, I will also venture into Hindi film music and continue 

to play my own music at live gigs. Nothing?s better than that.? 

Shantanu Goenka

fashion designer

The young NIFT pass-out has carved a niche in the 

designer bridalwear market in the last six years that he has been around. While 

2004 saw him winning accolades at Bridal Asia and another prominent bridal show, 

it?s the Lakme India Fashion Week (LIFW) the most-coveted platform for Indian 

designers, he is eyeing in 2005.

Shantanu has already been inducted into the Fashion 

Design Council of India and is now all set to face the final jury which will give 

him the go-ahead to showcase at the LIFW to be held this April.

Retailing from stores across the country and even 

Kuwait and Bangladesh, Shantanu has also made an entry into the pret market with 

his Western line that he launched in early 2004. 

But it?s trousseau talk that interests him more than 

anything else and he is even venturing into complete wedding planning ? right 

from wardrobes to pandals, cards and trousseau designing. 

?In 2005, my primary focus will be LIFW, for which 

I am doing a vintage Western line called Eliza?s Tea Party. Talks are on for shows 

abroad, but that?ll wait till later in the year,? he says.

Girish

disc jockey

Lounge was a concept alien to Calcuttans but things 

turned around when Shisha Bar lit its hookah. And the success can be majorly attributed 

to the music at the lounge bar. Girish, the resident DJ of Shisha since its inception, 

now promises to look beyond. 

And that could be as far as Europe. ?I am playing 

at quite a few parties abroad. In January I?ll be playing at Dhaka. In March I 

will play in Bangkok and from there I?ll head to Spain to play at a party,? says 

the table turner. 

But the high point will be when he cuts his own album 

later on in 2005. ?I have decided to try my hand at production. Talks are on with 

a leading label and if things work out, the album will see the light of day in 

the second half of 2005,? reveals the disc jockey. And the content of the album 

won?t be very different from what has made him a rage in the year just past. ?Most 

of the songs will be remixes, but in my own style,? says Girish.

It?s the console at Shisha, however, that still occupies 

prime position in Girish?s priority list. ?I am sure Shisha will retain its top 

position in the coming year... I?ll pick up loads of international tracks from 

my trips abroad,? he signs off.

Nicolette Bird

model

The 20-year-old model is a popular face, nationally, 

in print ads and we also saw her sizzle in a couple of music albums like Saiya 

dil mein aana re and Nisha. 2005 starts on a high note for this svelte 

beauty as she will soon add fizz to a Pepsi commercial alongside Shah Rukh Khan. 

?It?s an experience of a lifetime for an amateur like me to shoot with Shah Rukh. 

Till the day of the shoot we didn?t know that the ad would feature him and so 

I was in a dream-like state the entire day of the shooting in Mumbai,? she recalls. 

The other big project Nicolette will start the year 

with is an AIDS awareness campaign produced by Hollywood star Richard Gere?s production 

agency. Both the ads are scheduled to hit the screens in January. These apart, 

she has been signed by brands like Pantaloons, Elle 18 and Reliance as their in-house 

face of the year. 

While things are shining on the modelling front, Nicolette?s 

sights are set on completing her graduation in May. ?To have a proper education 

is important, career can wait,? says this English honours student of Bhawanipur 

Education Society College. ?In the later half of this year, I?ll try my luck in 

the movies. I?ve already got offers that I had to decline because of my exams,? 

she says.

Puneet Soi

artist

Trained in Baroda, 33-year-old Puneet Soi uses traditional 

techniques of painting to create works that pull from various sources, many of 

them localised. 

Schooled in Calcutta, the city keeps recurring in 

his work, and though he has been living in Amsterdam for some time, he often returns 

to meet artists such as Paritosh Sen. 

After a stint at the University of California in 1998, 

he was artist in residence at the prestigious Rijksakademie Van Beeldende Kunsten, 

Amsterdam, in 2002 and 2003, and a guest artist at Duende Studios, Rotterdam, 

last year. 

Soi?s latest project is a collaboration between video 

artists, theoreticians from the Netherlands and Calcutta artists. Slated for September, 

he wants ?to let accidents happen?.

 January rain sent Calcuttans scurrying for cover ? nowhere more dramatic than on the Book Fair grounds ? on Friday afternoon. As heavy rain lashed the city and its outskirts, the Met office recorded 7.9 mm of rain till 5.30 pm.

 Officials at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore forecast more rain on Saturday and said once the sky clears in the next couple of days, the North Wind will begin to blow and the city will experience a cold spell before winter bows out.

 ?From Thursday, a low-pressure trough developed across east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, following the arrival of moisture-laden winds from the western part of the country, known in meteorological parlance as a western disturbance,? said an official.

 ?Also, an anti-cyclonic upper-air circulation developed over north Orissa and south Bengal. This also helped bring in moisture from the Bay of Bengal. Under the impact of the two systems, the city received a huge amount of moisture that led to formation of rain clouds,? he added.

 The rain clouds caused havoc on Day Three of the 30th Calcutta Book Fair and even forced Day Four to be struck off the mela calendar.

 The skies opened up ? and the lights went out ? just when a discussion on love was underway at the Desh pavilion.

 On the dais were some leading French authors, alongside big names from Bengal, and Sunil Gangopadhyay was holding centre stage when the deluge and the darkness descended.

 ?The lights were switched off as a precautionary measure to prevent a short-circuit,? explained U.N. Adhikary, divisional fire officer in charge of the fair.

 The memory of the last fire at the fair being anything but distant, power supply was not restored till Friday night, forcing publishers and stall-owners to call it a day well before the day was done.

 Long after the rain had stopped, the fair ground remained waterlogged and slushy, prompting the Publishers and Booksellers Guild to declare Saturday a no-fair day.

 ?The decision was taken jointly in the best interests of the visitors to the fair,? said a Guild spokesperson.

 ?The condition of the grounds is very poor and restoring electricity supply to the stalls could prove risky. So, we would rather increase the Fair timings on the rest of the days than open the gates on Saturday,? he added.

 Back at the weather office, a rise in the minimum temperature was recorded as the weather condition blocked the passage of the North Wind. 

 The minimum temperature on Friday was 15.9 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal and 1.5 degrees higher than that on Thursday.

 Officials, however, maintained that once the North Wind begins to blow after the sky clears, an effect of the ongoing cold wave in north India would be felt.

 ?We can expect another cold spell in the city and the state,? an official elaborated. 

 This year, he added, winter had been frequently interrupted by western disturbances and anti-cyclonic circulations. The city had also received some rain early this month.

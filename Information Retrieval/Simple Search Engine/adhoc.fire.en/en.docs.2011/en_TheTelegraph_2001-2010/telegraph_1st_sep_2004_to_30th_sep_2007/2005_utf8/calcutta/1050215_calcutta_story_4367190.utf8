The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Getting your date approved

If folks don?t approve of your new-found date, ask them to take a cue from the 

queen of England! Their upper lips couldn?t be stiffer than the British royalty. 

Even Her Highness Queen Elizabeth has given sonny Charles the go-ahead to marry 

long-time girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles. So ?chill, mom? or ?cool it, dad? 

could work best when love is in the air.

Rooting for the rooster

More excuse to tuck into Chinese food with an extra helping of chilli chicken 

this year of the rooster. The Chinese community in the city is celebrating its 

New Year with gusto and you can?t miss out on the exotic fun, from Tangra to Tiretta 

Bazaar, till February 20. While the quaint eateries in the Chinese lair have always 

taken top priority on your eat-out agenda, add to it some heady dragon dance, 

a dazzling decor and you couldn?t have had a more enjoyable treat!

 Greeting spring in style

If you?ve been fretting over the early departure of the Calcutta winter, look 

at the brighter side of things by embracing the colours of spring. It?s also the 

time to celebrate freedom as you shed the load of woollens and blankets. Lighten 

up in style by investing in some vibrant summer wear. With necklines plunging 

and hemlines rising, however, there would be no ignoring the soaring temperatures 

in a few weeks from now!

Catching Sheesha

If you thought Neha Dhupia was hot in Julie, well, just watch her tantalise 

the censor scissors in her new release, Sheesha. And why not, when you 

have two Nehas in the same film. Playing twins (one is deaf and mute) Neha is 

at her seductive best. Some posters don?t lie?

 A table treasure of Bengal bites

 A crispy platter of Chingri Patisapta, a scrumptious portion of the Rajadhiraj Kakra (a giant crab) or a handsome helping of Rajshahi Ilish.

 A marriage of traditional cuisine from both Bengals at pocket-friendly prices and in a relaxed, home ambience is what Subrata Ghose Chaudhuri and wife Sunetra had in mind when they launched Tero Parbon just before the Pujas.

 We wanted to present a kaleidoscope of 100 years of Bengali food and in that quest travelled extensively on both sides of the border, says Subrata, who had set up Krystal Chopstick, the Chinese eatery off Rashbehari, in 1994.

 From Khulna to Jessore to Dhaka in the east and Midnapore to Bankura to Purulia in the west, the couple, with a taste team in tow, criss-crossed the culinary frontiers to cull delicacies representative of regions and rustle up a roster of ravishing recipes.

 Be it Stuffed Kakrol and Chitol Peti from across the border or the Posto Bora from this side of the divide, expect Bengali food in all its traditional glory at this 54-cover eatery (49/C, Purna Das Road).

 We want to bring back to the table those lost dishes that are quintessentially Bengal, either from the east or the west, with a twist here and there to make them palatable to todays generation, explains Subrata.

 Thus, from the Kumror Chhokka of Burdwan to the Doi Begun of Midnapore and the Ilisher Matha Die Kochu Saag of Chittagong, the Mocha Ghonto and Lau Chingri, the Chingrir Shorshe Jhal and Tel Koi ? traditional Bengali cuisine in all its regional resplendence, finds pride of place on the menu.

 The kitchen repertoire of the Bengals is too vast and we dont claim we can do full justice. We just want to give our clientele value for money and a conducive setting to appreciate traditional dishes, offers Sunetra, who has conceptualised the interiors.

 The Ghose Chaudhuris have tried to impart a jamidar-bari feel to the eatery, which, housed in an old building, is fortunate to have a double-height ceiling, optimised by a quaint mezzanine level. The red floor, ornate chandeliers, wooden stairway and old paintings all add to the yesteryear atmosphere.

 And theres a mouth-watering buffet spread too. A platter of Pulao, Luchi, Chholar Dal, Begun Bhaja, Alu Phoolkopir Dalna, Chhoto Chingrir Kalia, Mangshor Jhol, Chutney, Payesh. Or Sada Bhat, Luchi, Kolaier Dal, Kumror Chhokka, Jhinge-Peyaj Posto, Tangra Machher Jhal, Murgir Jhol, Chutney, Payesh. All this for a pocket-pinch of Rs 140 plus taxes.

 Lawyer held for forging order

 OUR BUREAU

 After the marksheet scandal, now it?s a lawyer forging the signature of a judge.

 The detective department of the city police, probing the alleged fake marksheet scam involving lawyers, stumbled upon another case of forgery, on a complaint by the registrar of the high court. The registrar alleged that an advocate from Baidyabati had forged the signature of a judge to produce a fake eviction order. 

 A team of officers from the detective department raided a few places in Baidyabati in tandem with the local police on Saturday, and arrested Romi Banerjee, a practising advocate of Calcutta High Court. 

 A former Trinamul Congress councillor, Banerjee was arrested at her residence at Baidyabati Chowrasta.

 Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (special) of the detective department, said a copy of the fake eviction order was seized from the arrested advocate. ?Earlier, Dipankar Mukherjee and his brother Subhankar were arrested in this connection. The brothers engaged Romi to seek the court?s help in evicting their tenant,? she said.

 After the death of Tapan Mukherjee in 2003, his sons Dipankar and Subhankar wanted their tenant Narendra Nath Rajak, a laundry-owner, to vacate the premises in the Baidyabati Gate area. ?Rajak refused to leave. The brothers then moved court and the case finally reached high court,? said a senior officer of the detective department.

 The arrested advocate produced a copy of a high court order in which Serampore police was directed to evict Rajak as early as possible. Serampore police carried out the order.

 When Rajak filed a petition before the high court to find out on what ground he was evicted, no record could be found in the court. The Mukherjee brothers were arrested. On being grilled, they came out with Romi?s name.

 The devastation of the natural disaster over, life in the Andaman amp; Nicobar islands is slowly returning to normal. And efforts by Rotary International, particularly in healthcare, are trying to speed up the process.

 A tele-medicine facility is expected to become operational in the next six months, while a hospital ship is scheduled to travel to different islands and treat patients, in a year?s time.

 ?The poorest of people in the islands will be able to access Dr Devi Shetty sitting in Bangalore through the tele-medicine facility,? said Shekhar Mehta, past governor of district 3290 (which covers India), during the Calcutta visit of Frank Devlyn, trustee chair of the Rotary Foundation, on Monday.

 The Rs 1.5-crore project will involve 24 health centres across 19 Andaman amp; Nicobar islands, with Indian Space Research Organisation providing the connectivity.

 The mobile hospital is being housed in a ship provided by the island administration. The Rs 1-crore facility is being jointly funded by the Rotary Foundation and the Rotary Club of Birmingham. ?The ship will try to eliminate the need of sick people to travel great distances, by spending 10 days at each port,? Mehta offered.

 ?I?m in India to observe how the money that comes in from around the world is used under Rotarians here,? said Devlyn. ?And I?m happy with the work that?s being done?. India is the highest recipient of the grants from the foundation, which spends around $100 million in projects in various countries.

 Devlyn returned from Guwahati on Monday morning, from a peace and conflict-resolution session. Rotary has instituted 70 scholarships worth $50,000 internationally and plans to offer 30 more worth $2,000 locally for study in the area. 

 ?We are also on the verge of eradicating polio in India and by December, we should achieve 100 per cent success,? said Kalyan Bannerjee, a past international director.

 Racing truck claims youth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A 29-year-old man was crushed under the wheels of a truck in Howrah on Wednesday morning. According to witnesses, around 9 am, two trucks were trying to overtake each other on PTR Siding Road, in the Shibpur police station area.

 The driver of one of the trucks lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a sharp bend, near the intersection of PTR Siding Road and Foreshore Road, and hit Sandip Kumar Singh from behind.

 The impact flung Sandip in the air and he crashed on the road, at least five m away.

 Bystanders and employees of the transport company the victim worked for rushed a profusely-bleeding Sandip to Jain Hospital, but he died on the way. Doctors at the hospital pronounced him ?brought dead? and sent Sandip?s body for post-mortem.

 Local councillor Pradip Tewari said: ?Sandip was giving instructions to the driver of one of the trucks of the transport company when the mishap occurred.?

 Sandip?s younger brother, Satish, said: ?One of the employees of the transport company came to our house around 10 am and informed us about the tragedy.?

 Sandip?s father, Nirmal Singh, is a traffic police officer. Brother Satish said: ?My sister-in-law, Tanni Debi, passed out when we broke the news to her. We don?t know what will happen to her and her three-month-old daughter.?

 ?The errant drivers escaped with the vehicles. A probe has been ordered,? said Mihir Bhattacharya, superintendent of police, Howrah.

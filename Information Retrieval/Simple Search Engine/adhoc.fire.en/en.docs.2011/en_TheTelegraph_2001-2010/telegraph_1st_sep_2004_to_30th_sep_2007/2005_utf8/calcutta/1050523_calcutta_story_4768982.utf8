 Little women no more

 A quietly disturbing, yet extremely thought-provoking comedy, Ina Mina Dika, produced by Addiction, attempts to trace the motivations that lead modern young women to break away from age-old conventions and live on their own terms. Choosing to escape into their private worlds by deliberately distancing themselves from their roots, three girls, Ina, Mina and Dika, find themselves embroiled in a life full of uncertainties, doubts and misgivings. Written and directed by Rajarshi Dey, the play focuses on their endeavour to overcome their sense of isolation and ennui, brought about by life in the big city. In a bid to run away from their past, they concoct for themselves a world enveloped in illusions and fantasies, and are unable to touch reality. Searching for more meaningful relationships, the girls are eventually led into tentatively accepting a bond that deviates from the stereotypical pattern. Solo performance by Sudipta Chakraborty.

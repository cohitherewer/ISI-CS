The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Reality bite: lily white to shades of grey

 Everybody wants a bit of Aishwarya Rai. The West, waking up to the sheer number power of brand Bollywood, eyes her with more than a passing interest. Time magazine has included her in its power list for the entertainment industry. The December 2004 issue of L?imprint has put her on the cover of its India special edition. The young Calcutta male picked her as his dream date in an opinion poll published in Metro on Sunday. The media clamour for a quote or two to pour from that pretty pout, even in Mumbai, where the stars walk the streets.

 So, getting Aishwarya to speak is a mission made possible only by plenty of pluck and lots of luck. Even when the call is finally put through, one is tantalisingly put on hold as the voice, elaborating a point to another journalist, is heard, as if to drown the faraway grumbles of those denied access to her.

 The wait ends. It is a late hour and she has clearly been doing a lot of talking. Yet, a mention of Calcutta and Metro?s dream date poll results, and the lady is instantly all sweetness and light.

 What does it feel to be coveted by men who are perfect strangers? ?I am lucky. The cross-section of my fans includes women, children, elderly people and typical family people,? she elaborates, politely tossing away the tag of an object of male desire.

 Aishwarya knows and speaks her mind, unlike the ask-Mummy generation of yesteryear, and even unlike the role she plays in her forthcoming film Shabd, reaching the theatres this Friday.

 ?I was drawn to the character by the intricacy of the narrative. Sanjay (Dutt, who plays her novelist-husband, reeling under the shock of his failed second work) is far senior to me in the film. That?s why she puts on make-up to look confident, to match up to him. She is in complete awe of the man, his intelligent mind.?

 In Shabd, Ash is a professor of fashion technology. ?Yes, she is a working woman with a show of outward confidence. Her fragility and turmoil are internalised. Deep within lies a fairly confused mind. Therein lies the intensity of the film.?

She has to be reminded of the actual question: Does 

the husband push the wife into a relationship (with Zayed Khan) in the film (to 

seek fodder from life for his next work of fiction)? ?The husband has a strong 

impact on the wife. As the story unfolds, she starts to discover her own personality.? 

No straight answer there. The plot is not to be given out before the curtains 

go up on Friday.

 ?Can such a thing happen in real life in this day and age?? Ash is asked. ?The human population is so diverse. We are dream merchants who dwell on the diversity of life. Even in a single relationship, there are so many greys. We depict characters that are reflections of real people. Come on, there is someone somewhere leading such a life!?

 So does pure Paro aka Nandini ultimately tread the path of infidelity as Antara in Shabd? The mention of greys steers talk towards the recent variety of shades she has put on, providing a break from the image of the prim-and-propah princess.

 ?Yes, Antara in Shabd, Binodini in Chokher Bali, Mahalaxmi in Khakee? all these women occupy grey areas in the narrative. They are out to discover themselves. Binodini is vulnerable; she makes mistakes. Interestingly, if you think of it, even Raincoat was grey. Thanks to directors like Raj Kumar Santoshi and Rituparno Ghosh, who had the confidence in me, I have had the chance to discover these women.? 

 When a heroine who has stuck to roles of the righteous through her career suddenly switches sides and trains her gun on a cop (Akshay Kumar in Khakee) with whom she does the song-and-dance routine before shooting to kill, it does come as a shock. ?That woman was outright dark,? says Ash. ?But all through, she was clear to herself about her one love (Ajay Devgan, the crimelord). It is the audience which was surprised.?

 Is bringing out the shade of darkness more difficult with a near-perfect face? A similar moment of betrayal is easier to accept with others (Think Bipasha Basu pointing the gun at John Abraham in Jism after scorching the screen together through the better part of the passion saga). ?Raj Kumar Santoshi used my looks to his advantage. As for being convincing, that is what acting all about,? says Ash.

 Shabd has her looking very convincingly steamy in a song sequence with Sanjay Dutt. Is there more steam in store for fans? That brings the chat to boiling point. ?With my stature as an actress, I do not need to do such things. Please go and see the film first and then ask such questions!?

 More frostiness follows. Her last release Raincoat did not do too well. But is it fair to expect its showing to compare to the box-office achievement of a blockbuster like Veer Zaara? ?It is you journalists who are making the comparison. As an actor, it was a very satisfying experience for me. I have got some wonderful feedback. Critics have said it is my best acting to date.?

 The media, one is told, have been unfair, panning her for foreign projects that never took off. But the recent visit to India of Hollywood biggie Michael Douglas has surely gagged those wags. ?We have met a couple of times; we have agreed to work together; we have seen and given our consent to the script. It takes time to coordinate. Both of us are busy with our own schedules in different parts of the world...?

 If that sounds slightly uppity on our prima donna?s part, there?s a report of the US National Intelligence Council to back her up: it suggests that Bollywood will outstrip Hollywood by 2020. In other words, Bride and Prejudice will go Balle Balle!

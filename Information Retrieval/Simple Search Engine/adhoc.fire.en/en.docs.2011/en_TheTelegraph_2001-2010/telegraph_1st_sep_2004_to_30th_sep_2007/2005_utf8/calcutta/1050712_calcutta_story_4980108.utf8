 The Indian Anti-Terrorist Cell has to stop terrorist Jamwal from causing a big dhamaka somewhere in Canada. What follows is a battle of wits and bullets between the operation team (Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Abhishek Bachchan, Shilpa Shetty, Zayed Khan) and the baddie battalion.

 The loopholes in the plot are so huge you may actually slide into one if you try to make sense of it. Sample: If you know that the Indian Prime Minister will be at a big gathering in Canada on the blast date, why would you waste our time in cracking codes to pinpoint the site of action? 

 They have been in the industry for years now, but watching Sanjay Dutt and Suniel Shetty cry is like watching a shoddy episode of Jaspal Bhatti?s Flop Show. And it?s not even funny!

 Even if you sit through without blinking, don?t expect to catch Dia Mirza and Raima Sen. If you are unlucky enough to spot them, you won?t be asking for more. 

 Pankaj Kapoor isn?t in full form but is still the best thing about the Anubhav Sinha film, generating fun and fear with equal ease.

 Abhishek Bachchan keeps the good work going with another effortless performance. The John Wayne swagger works, so does his newly acquired dancing shoe.

 The special effects, the action stunts and the innovative editing style give the film a slick start and a techno feel. 

 First weekend watch: 99 % at INOX (Forum), 93% at INOX (City Centre), 95 % at 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi)

 Last word: Catch the show before Dus and hang around for the title track. Slip out after that.

 Marks racket bust nets duo

 - 36 documents seized in undercover operation 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 City police on Thursday busted a fake marksheet racket and arrested two persons, including the alleged kingpin.

 Seizures of fake Madhyamik and Higher Secondary marksheets and certificates are common in the city as well as the districts, but this is the first time counterfeit documents ? 36 in all ? pertaining to the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations have been recovered by police.

 The council conducts Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) and Indian School Certificate (ISC) examinations in the Class X and Class XII levels, respectively.

 ?Humayun Kabir, 40, and Pawan Jaiswal, 35, were arrested at Beltala, near Ballygunge Government High School, on the charge of running a fake marksheet racket,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 ?This is a major breakthrough, since we have been tracking the racket for quite a while now. It is likely that we have hit the tip of the iceberg, and there will be more arrests in the coming days,? he added.

 Acting on a tip-off that the duo would be meeting at a spot near the school, in the Ballygunge police station area, police officers in plainclothes sprung a trap to nab the two.

 Masquerading as pedestrians, snack vendors and mechanics, the policemen fanned out in the area and watched out for their targets.

 Jaiswal appeared first. He stood under a tree, waiting. After almost half an hour, Kabir, the alleged mastermind of the racket, was seen walking along the opposite footpath, casting casual glances all around. He had a large packet tucked under one arm. The police team did not make their move, waiting for the two men to meet.

 ?Our officers did not draw any attention to themselves. The idea was to catch the duo red-handed,? said K.K. Patra, officer-in-charge, Ballygunge police station.

 Kabir soon crossed the road and walked up to a visibly tense Jaiswal. The two started walking together, speaking in low tones.

 ?The team swooped down on the two as soon as Kabir handed the packet to Jaiswal. They didn?t see the officers coming and were caught completely off-guard. We seized 36 fake marksheets of the West Bengal and Delhi boards,? Sharma said.

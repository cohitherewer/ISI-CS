The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cricket commentary and beyond

 For a cause: They came, they partied and 

performed for a cause. Members of Mumbai band Aasma spent time with students in 

city schools and colleges on Friday ( picture above in Bhawanipur College by Sanjoy 

Chattopadhyaya), and performed at the concert One World on Saturday, presented 

in association with TTIS, to raise funds for tsunami victims. Local group 

Dhwani (picture right by Rashbehari Das) also performed at the event.

Educating, enlightening, witty, amusing and enthralling ? these aren?t adjectives that one would normally use ? together ? to describe a typical B-School talk. But when the speaker is the pioneer of television cricket commentary in India, you can expect things to be a little different.

 Students at Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, (IIM-C) got firsthand insight into why Harsha Bhogle is so popular, when he spoke to them at an event organised by IIM-C?s platform for industry interaction, Colloquia. 

 From Sidhuisms to serious career advice to his experiences in TV broadcasting, the talk had it all, with the audience sitting on the edge of the seat for over three hours. 

 The session kicked off with a packed house being treated to select clippings of Harsha?s on-screen achievements, after which the man himself held sway. Fit as a fiddle and oozing enthusiasm, he said it was a pleasure for him to exchange views with young people as it filled him with energy and optimism. 

 An alumnus of IIM, Ahmedabad, he said doing an MBA helped him believe in his capabilities and gave him a tremendous sense of achievement. ?It is difficult to find such talent together in one place, as in India?s premier business schools,? he said.

 However, he thinks there are significant areas for improvement. Staying fit and being able to deal with stress is extremely important to survive in the corporate world, and these should form an integral part of management education, was his opinion. Focus should also be on communication skills, implementing ideas and team spirit.

 Citing examples from the sports world, he said the most successful people are those who have a strong passion for their work and are humble and unassuming. Hence, the focus in this stage of a student?s life should essentially be on building a career. 

 But it was not just about advice, as he regaled the audience with anecdotes on cricket and his co-commentators, from Geoffrey Boycott and Navjot Singh Sidhu to Ravi Shastri and Wasim Akram. His recent forays into advertisements was also the topic of an interesting discussion. 

 His clarity of thought, knowledge, spontaneity and humour made him a hit with the student community, reflected in the lively question-and-answer session after the talk.

Culture and creativity

 It was a bid to hold on to an age-old tradition and inculcate it among today?s children. Last week, a bunch of excited kids barely three years old were waiting to be part of the ritual. Something that their ?miss? in school called hathekhori. Days before Saraswati puja, Kidz Konclave, a play-school and montessori tucked away in a residential area off Southern Avenue, organised hathekhori, with painter Suvaprasanna playing the role of the elderly member of the family initiating the youngest into formal education using slate and chalk.

 ?This tradition of introducing the child to writing using stationery is an age-old practice and exists in various forms around the world. It used to be celebrated with fanfare and elaborate rituals in Bengali families. It?s fast fading away, and an event like this can help retain it?s charm,? said the painter, who held tiny hands to help them sketch something of their choice on a slate as part of the ritual.

 ?With nuclear families, most parents either don?t know of these traditions or don?t have the time to follow them. So we thought we would give these kids an experience they?ll cherish,? said Indira Sengupta, the lady behind the school.

 Toddler talents

 Children pranced and did workouts to popular melodies, dressed up as gypsies and danced to the beat of their tambourines, transformed into fairies with gauzy wings and pot-bellied rajas, a choo-choo train and the mulberry bush around which they went round and round in circles at the annual day celebrations of Army KG School at Barrackpore on February 4. 

 The venue of the show was Sainik Institute on BT Road. The hall was packed with eager parents and senior officers from the armed forces. Flash bulbs popped as chief guest Brigadier P.S. Siwach lit the lamp to announce the opening of the programme, along with principal Puja Diwan. Then the children appeared on stage and played the parts they had been assigned with professional elan.

 Army KG School, meant for the children of both civilians and those of defence personnel, was established in 1976. In 28 years, the number of students has increased from 350 to 480. So, the right teacher-student ratio is maintained. Surrounded by greenery and huge trees that have graced India?s oldest cantonment for years, the school has just the right surroundings for outdoor activities. 

 The stress is on extracurricular activities like clay-modelling, recitation and fancy dress. To encourage such activity, competitions are held every month. The school also boasts a computer lab. Recently, parents donated Rs 25,000 to the Prime Minister?s Tsunami Relief Fund. 

 The celebration ended with a rousing finale when children dressed up in the costumes of the various states, sang and danced to celebrate India?s unity within diversity.

School talk

 One hundred and fifty years ago, Barisha High School was a seedling planted by Sabarna Ray Chowdhury, Biren Roy and Jagatmohan Tarkalankar, on the sanctified spot called aatchala. A devastating flame swallowed the school two years later. Another two years, and the school was rebuilt, where it now proudly stands. 

 There was a four-day cultural festival to celebrate the occassion. It was inaugurated on January 25, by state minister for school education Kanti Biswas. Early the same morning, students, teachers, ex-students and prominent personalities of the locality took out a procession to make everyone aware of the importance of education. 

 On the first day, singer Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta thrilled the audience with her musical soiree, while Odissi exponent Dona Ganguly, wife of skipper Sourav Ganguly, held the audience spellbound with her performance. 

 On January 26, the school organised a seminar on ?Education in the 21st Century?, where minister for transport Subhas Chakraborty, mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the registrar of JU and the chairman of SCERT spoke. Then, the younger lot presented a drama show. The curtains came down on a performance of folk songs by Swapan Basu. 

 The third day began with Praktani, a reunioun organised by the ex-students. They presented a dance drama and Pallav Kritania sang. Teachers were also felicitated.

 The final day featured a felicitation programme, honouring some remarkable personalities of the area. The 1939 school topper Santipriya Chattapadhaya, former headmaster Binaybhusan Aich and classical music vocalist Dipali Nag were present. Students then presented Pous Fagunar Pala, a dance drama. It ended with the drama Natasena. There will be more events through the year.

 Back together again

 The annual reunion of Loreto College was held on February 5. It was a happy occasion, where past pupils met and relived their college days. Current students also contributed, either by helping with the decorations or organising the food. Several others worked tirelessly to ensure the occasion went off without a hitch. The college band kept the audience entertained. They even sang Happy Birthday for an ex-student who is going to turn 83 soon. While the ex-students felt nostalgic, we, the present generation, revelled in the joys of our own college days, aware that not long from now, we too, will be left only with fond memories.

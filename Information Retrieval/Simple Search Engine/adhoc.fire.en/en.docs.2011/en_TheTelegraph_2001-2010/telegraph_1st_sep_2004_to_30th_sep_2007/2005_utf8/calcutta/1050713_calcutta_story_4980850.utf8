 Meals sans frills for President

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 True to his simple lifestyle, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has made it clear that he wouldn?t ?like anything special? for his meals at Raj Bhavan. 

 The President?s secretariat has also indicated that he is not very particular about South Indian cuisine, either.

 The President?s secretariat has clearly spelt out the kind of food President Kalam prefers. ?The President is a vegetarian and doesn?t have any special liking for South Indian dishes. Any local preparation may be served.?

 In keeping with this, it has been decided that the President will be served a no-frills vegetarian meal. 

 Accordingly, Raj Bhavan?s household department has briefed its pantry unit and arrangements have been made for a three-course meal.

 ?We have kept in mind that our President is a frugal eater. So, it will be a plain-and-simple spread. We will make sure that the food is served piping hot, though,? said one of the employees in the household department.

 As of now, the menu finalised comprises dal (not sambar), mixed vegetables, and a seasonal vegetable preparation. This will be followed by plain curd and, finally, the President will be served a Bengali delicacy ? narom paker sandesh.

 It is expected that the President will have his lunch between 1.15 pm and 3.30 pm ? after meeting the children at Nandan and before visiting Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur.

 While the schedule doesn?t mention any visitor joining the President for lunch, the Raj Bhavan authorities have geared up to meet any last-minute requirement. 

 ?We just need 15 minutes and things will be ready,? said a pantry staff member. 

 Apart from President Kalam, his entourage will also be served lunch at Raj Bhavan and there will no change in the menu for it.

 The President will have his breakfast at Raj Bhavan before proceeding for his first stop ? Jadavpur University, at 10 am. 

 The breakfast menu couldn?t be any simpler ? bread, bananas and eggs.

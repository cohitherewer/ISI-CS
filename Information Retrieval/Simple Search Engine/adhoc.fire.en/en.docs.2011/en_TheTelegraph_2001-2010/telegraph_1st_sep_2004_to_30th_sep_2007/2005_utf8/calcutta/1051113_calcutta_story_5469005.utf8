Life

 Go as Chameli or Chandni maam

When you dress up filmi style, the 

options are endless from the Zeenat dare to the Poo bare. Shradha Agarwal 

picks five striking statements for a Bollywood bash you could attend soon

 Time it: A week in hand.

 The look: Rekha as Umrao Jaan.

 Copy code: The classic tawaif look is all about ornate jewels and luxury fabrics. The silhouette ? long, flowing kurtas with fitted churidars ? is all ethnic. The outfit is completed with a heavily-embellished dupatta in a shiny metallic hue.

The look is very over the top. The kurta 

should have lots of gheras and an empire line cut. A small sleeveless waistcoat 

in a bright colour is a great add-on, offers designer Agnimitra. For heavy- 

duty accessorising, she suggests gold chandelier earrings. Use an old pendant 

on the forehead, wear a nose pin and try some jingling trinkets on the payal. 

Carry a jewelled bag and wear embellished jootis. Dark, glossy lips, heavy 

kohl-lined eyes and lots of shimmer on the face complete the look.

Time it: Straight from work.

 The look: Konkona Sen Sharma in Page 3.

 Copy code: The original journo ? khadi kurtas and denims ? look might be a hot statement right now, but thats not where the Page 3 style file ends. Konkonas wardrobe can well dictate your office outfit for the after-work party.

 Wear trousers or jeans teamed with a kurti. Alternatively, show off a pretty skirt, flared or straight. The trick to get this look right lies in the right accessories.

The jewellery should be kept minimal, maybe just a 

pair of silver hoops. A smart bag, jhola style or sturdy leather, is a 

must. Make your hair non-fuss but neat. A thin line of kajal and fruity 

gloss on the lips are enough. Also, dont forget to tuck in that pen.

Time it: Two days to go.

 The look: Kareena Kapoor in Chameli.

 Copy code: Kareenas in-your-face look ? loud make-up, cheap fabrics and mismatched accessories ? is actually quite easy to ape.

 Wear an inexpensive acrylic sari of a loud colour with a gaudy brocade border. You can also dangle some tassels on the edges of the sari. Pleat the pallu tightly and pin it on the shoulder, revealing most of your midriff to telling belly-button effect.

 The cut of the blouse is very pronounced and it should be styled in the form of a sexy low-cut choli, says designer Agnimitra Paul. The blouse should be of a cheap fabric and the sleeves should have some danglers.

The correct accessories will perfect the look. Go 

for a nose pin, gold jhumkas, loads of multi-coloured plastic bangles and 

a jasmine to clip on your hair.

Time it: Just after youve got a hot bod 

to show off.

 The look: Bipasha Basu in No Entry.

 Copy code: The temptress look in question revolves around flowy chiffon dresses and lots of sheer layers. An empire line dress in red is the Bipasha look, with lots of sequins and shimmer. The neckline can be beaded. You could also wear boots with an anklet over it, says designer Preeti Jhawar.

Low necklines, strappy clothes, high hemlines and 

clingy layers. The make-up, smouldery and dark. Lots of kohl for the eyes 

and generously-applied bronzer. Dust some shimmer on shoulders and cleavage. Accentuate 

cheekbones, apply lush nude gloss.

Time it: Last minute.

 The look: Sushmita Sen in Main Hoon Na.

 Copy code: This look is simple yet effective and within moments you can transform yourself into the enchantress, also known as Chandni maam.

 A plain, solid colour chiffon sari and a sexy blouse are all you need to get it right. In the film, Sush wore an array of pretty pastels like baby blues and lilacs in some scenes and a crimson chiffon with a bold animal-print halter in others.

 Pick a sari of your choice and please dont forget the co-ordinated cloth folder to perfect the look.

 Play around with the blouse neckline; you can choose from a sexy halter neck or a cut-away sleeve, says designer Preeti.

 Sushmitas trademark blouse also had a tie-up knot at the back.

 Wear a delicate neck piece and studs in your ears.

 The make-up is very subtle and rosy. Just a hint of blush on your cheeks, a dash of liner and two coats of mascara are adequate.

 Finally, iron out the tresses if your hair is wavy and dont forget to flutter your eyelashes, lest a charming student comes singing Tumhein jo maine dekhe...

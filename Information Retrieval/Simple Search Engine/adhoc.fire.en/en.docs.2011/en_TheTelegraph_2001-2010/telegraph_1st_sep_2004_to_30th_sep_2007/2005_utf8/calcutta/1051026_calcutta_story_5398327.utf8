 Personnel of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and a large contingent of police were deployed on Sudhir Bose Road, in Ekbalpore, following a clash on Monday night between residents and Calcutta Armed Police constables with quarters in Alipore Bodyguard Lines.

 Many residents did not step out of their houses on Tuesday, fearing recurrence of violence. On the opposite stretch of Diamond Harbour Road, armed personnel stood guard at the main gate of the police quarters. Police have started a probe into the clash. 

 An incident of alleged eve-teasing around 9.30 pm on Monday snowballed into the fight. Ten people, including constables of the Bodyguard Lines, were injured. Two local residents had to be admitted to hospital. Half-a-dozen shops were ransacked.

 Police officers maintained that the violence was over drinking water served in a hotel.

 ?As far as I know, a dispute over drinking water led to the clash. We have deployed RAF personnel and cops in the area to curb any more violence,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner (port).

 ?We have started an internal inquiry. Restrictions have been imposed on the area and a police picket posted at the gates of Alipore Bodyguard Lines. The incident is unfortunate and should not recur. We will punish those who are found guilty,? asserted Zulfiquar Hassan, joint commissioner (armed police).

 According to the local residents, drunk cops often tease women in the area. 

 ?We are too scared to venture out of our houses after the incident. Inebriated cops were teasing a girl who was passing by. When we protested, a scuffle ensued. Later in the night, policemen ransacked a number of shops in the locality and beat us with lathis. They also broke the doors of houses and pelted stones at glass windows. They did not even spare the children,? said Md. Iqbal, one of the injured. 

 Shops and other business establishments on Sudhir Bose Road were closed on Tuesday and RAF personnel patrolled the deserted streets. Cops from the Reserve Force and Watgunge and Ekbalpore police stations were deployed at the intersections.

 ?We want the gate of Bodyguard Lines, facing our locality, closed permanently. Every evening, the policemen venture out and pass lewd comments at the girls, as they return from schools and other work. We have lodged numerous complaints with the police, but nothing has been done,? complained Md. Anzar Alam, a local businessman whose shop was allegedly ransacked.

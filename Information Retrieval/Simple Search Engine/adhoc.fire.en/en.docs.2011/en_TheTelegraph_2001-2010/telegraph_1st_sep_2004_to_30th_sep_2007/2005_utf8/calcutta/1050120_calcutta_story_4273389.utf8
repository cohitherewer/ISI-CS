of controversy

The report ?Marks forgery rerun at CU? on January 

3 highlights the fact that the state education system is on the verge of collapse 

and total anarchy reigns in the academic institutions. 

 A few months ago, Mukti Deb was arrested on the charge of tampering with her B.Sc marksheet to get herself enrolled in an M.Sc course at Jadavpur University. Later, she was even appointed a lecturer at Visva-Bharati. 

 What is really difficult to comprehend is how her forged B.Sc marksheet passed scrutiny at Jadavpur University, and later at Visva-Bharati. 

 Now it has been found that a student of Ranaghat College in collusion with a coaching centre, increased his marks by 125 by paying Rs 25,000. 

 This, too, could happen only due to the irresponsibility of Calcutta University officials. Either something is wrong with the process of scrutiny or the staff in charge of scrutiny are not dutiful. If the latter be the case, steps should immediately be taken against them to ensure that such incidents do not recur. 

 The coaching centres and tutorial homes that are coming into being every week are driving the last nail into the coffin of our education system by alluring students with the promises of ?sure success?. They are trading in education as if it is like any other commodity. These institutions should be banned. 

 The forgery cases are not isolated incidents. The state education system is gasping for breath and would break down unless corrective measures are taken soon. 

Debyani Basu,

Birati. 

 lIn this age, when even men have started wearing make-up, it is quite strange that the headmistress of a girls? school in the city is not willing to let lady teachers wear lipstick in class (Saris or salwars, but no lipstick for teachers, January 5). Someone should point out to her that wearing lipstick no longer constitutes abnormal behaviour. She must have had an old score to settle with the teachers against whom the ban is directed. The headmistress should bear in mind that dwelling at length on such minor issues will not improve the school atmosphere in any way. 

Rabindranath Kar,

Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

The diktat of the headmistress is astounding. Does 

she seriously believe that the students would follow suit if the teachers stop 

wearing make-up? In these days of satellite television, the headmistress? assumption 

seems ludicrous. Such mandates encroach on one?s fundamental rights. 

Santosh Chakravarty, 

Unique Park. 

The ban imposed by a north Calcutta school on teachers 

wearing lipstick and carrying cell phones to class is justified. To maintain discipline, 

students are bound to obey the teachers. The teachers also have an obligation 

to abide by the decisions of the school authorities. The government, in fact, 

should frame dress codes for teachers of all schools. A code of conduct should 

also be prescribed. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala. 

It isn?t surprising that a hue and cry has been raised 

over the principal of a girls? school imposing a ban on teachers wearing make-up 

and carrying cell phones to class. In contrast, there was no hue and cry from 

any quarter against a recent ban on wearing waist-revealing jeans and top at a 

high school in liberal and permissive Italy; the embargo was gracefully accepted 

and obeyed by all concerned. 

Jatindranath Bhowmik, 

Kalyani. 

By issuing a fatwa against wearing make-up in classrooms, 

the headmistress of Bonhooghly Girls? School has only succeeded in providing the 

media and political parties an issue. The administration should instead ensure 

that regular classes are held in the school and the syllabus finished on time. 

Anjan Chatterjee, 

Graham Road. 

Apropos the report ?Bye Bye 2004 with air most foul?, January 1, it is distressing that the pollution level in the city has risen to an alarming level and is causing one health hazard after another. The government has been a passive spectator in this undesirable state of affairs. Despite repeated court directives to adhere to pollution norms, it has done nothing to that effect. 

Piyal Mukherjee, 

Lake Town.

Apropos the report ?A white ribbon against violence?, January 4, it is heartening that men have come together to prevent violence against women. Two years have passed since the tragic death of Bapi Sen, but little has been done to preserve his legacy. Let?s hope that the new initiative does something for the cause for which the braveheart cop gave up his life. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee,

Nayapatty Road. 

It is praiseworthy that the mayor has taken an initiative to curb indiscriminate dumping of litter on city roads and is taking measures to put an end to the practice of treating the city like an open litterbin (Boycott tag to check litterbugs, January 5). 

Sankar Lal Singh,

R. L. Street. 

The report ?Priceless, yet of little value?, January 6, gave the impression that Indian Museum officials and detectives are hoping against hope. The ?organised gang? behind the theft of the Buddha head must have considered its possibilities of sale. It is a lucrative bait for private collectors. The CBI should at least see that the head doesn?t go outside the country or it might be lost forever. 

Abhijit Chakraborty,

Howrah. 

In the report ?Fare of the fair, flavour French?, (January 18) it was mistakenly mentioned that Jean-Marie Gustave?s Le Clezio would be published in the Book Fair. The author?s name is Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio and the book to be launched at the fair is Onitsha.

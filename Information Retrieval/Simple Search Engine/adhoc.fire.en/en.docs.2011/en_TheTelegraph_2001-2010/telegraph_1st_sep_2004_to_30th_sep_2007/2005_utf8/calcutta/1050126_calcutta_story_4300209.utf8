The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Leonardo DiCaprio: 

 Soaring high

 They should both be up for a clutch 

 of golden statuettes at the 77th Academy Awards. But before 

 D-day February 27, will you be able to judge for yourself 

 whether they deserve the honours they receive or don?t? 

 If The Aviator and Finding Neverland are what 

 we are talking about, then the answer is yes.

 The two big ticket movies are slated for back-to-back Indian release in early February, and besides Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai, Calcutta is also on the rollout roadmap.

 The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale, hits city theatres on February 4, while Finding Neverland, featuring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet strikes the screens the week after, on February 11.

 ?Thanks to the multiplex boom, latest releases are arriving early in the city,? said Prashant Srivastav, general manager, 89 Cinemas, which would be screening both the movies. ?If a thousand seat capacity theatre earlier saw 30 per cent occupancy, our 300-seater now sees full occupancy. So, distributors are also interested in bringing the films,? he added.

 Besides being strong Oscar contenders, the two movies have another factor in common ? they are both biopics. While The Aviator chronicles a period in the life of Hollywood producer and aviation expert Howard Hughes, Finding Neverland tells the story of the creator of the classic children?s tale Peter Pan, J. M. Barrie.

 Martin Scorsese and DiCaprio try to build on their Gangs of New York success with The Aviator. Cate Blanchett playing Katharine Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale in the shoes of Ava Gardner should be worth the watch, along with Alec Baldwin, who portrays Hughes? fierce competitor Juan Trippe.

 Finding Neverland is from Monster?s Ball director Marc Forster. Besides the star duo of Depp and Winslet, the film also stars Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie.

 There used to be a time when the Oscars would come and go without any sign of the movies that featured in it, at Calcutta theatres. Movie buffs should be glad that that situation is almost a thing of the past now.

 Bipasha and Raveena: 

 Crusaders of compassion

 If Hollywood can do it, so can Bollywood. A bevy of Hollywood celebrities, led by George Clooney, recently joined hands for a telethon to raise funds for tsunami victims.

 Now, Bollywood is getting together to do the same, with children?s rights as the added emphasis. On Republic Day, Sony Entertainment Television will beam India?s first fund-raising telethon, organised by Child Relief and You (CRY) in partnership with UTV. 

 The list of celebrities from Bollywood includes Shah Rukh Khan, Raveena Tandon, Bipasha Basu, Rahul Bose, Diana Hayden, Boman Irani, Ashutosh Gowariker and Farooque Sheikh. Others sharing screen space from different fields would be Sachin Tendulkar, Jagjit Singh, Shaan and Harsha Bhogle. 

 The theme of the seven-hour show is ?The child in all of us?. Each celebrity would be invited to perform an act related to the magical experience called childhood, that, unfortunately, many Indian children never get to know.

 CRY expects the telethon to raise around Rs 1 crore, with the entire amount going to tsunami relief efforts in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

 Viewers would be able to participate through SMS, telephone or the Internet. Tune in to Sony on January 26 at 1 pm to catch this historic show and make a difference, too.

 ?One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind? ? these were the famous words uttered by Neil Armstrong when in 1969, he first set foot on the moon, changing the course of human history. Considering the limitations of technology and the dangers involved, the achievement was monumental. Why then, so many years after the event, is a growing band of people claiming that the moon landings were faked? 

 One in five Americans, if polls are to be believed, suspect that the landings might have been a hoax. The conspiracy theorists believe that the evidence, ranging from the limitations of technology that existed in 1969, to flaws in some photographs and video footage, prove that the moon landings actually took place on our own terra firma. 

 A Russian author, for instance, created quite a stir by publishing a book where he pointed to a number of discrepencies ? a fluttering American flag, for one. How can that happen when there is no air in the lunar environment, he argued. The contention was that the Americans had faked the landing at Mozav desert near New Mexico.

 If it is a giant conspiracy, it took place on a global scale and involved many, including Nobel Prize-winning scientists.

 On February 5, Discovery Channel attempts to unveil the facts in a programme entitled Truth about Moon Landings at 9 pm.

 The programme takes up each conspiracy theory and with the help of experts, dismantles it, ending with proof from a forensic examination of a recovered moon rock sample. As experts sort out fact from fiction, find out if man really did land on the moon on the historic day.

 Jajantaram: Giant on small screen

 Is Jajantaram Mamantaram (or J2M2) influenced by Gulliver?s Travels or by the fable of Bakasur? The Jonathan Swift novel, an favourite across generations, is about a sailor who reaches the land of the Lilliputs during a voyage. The old Gujarati fable on Bakasur tells the story of a sleeping giant who only gets up to eat small people.

 Children can make up their minds on watching the movie itself on Republic Day, being brought to them by Hungama TV at 5 pm. 

 J2M2 is the story of Aditya ? a cool dude from Mumbai, who, after a shipwreck, lands in Shundi, a mystical island somewhere in the Arabian Sea. There he finds himself to be a walking giant in comparison to the villagers. 

 J2M2 has 63 minutes of special effects, which is sure to keep everyone on the edge of their seats. The film that was screened at Cannes, has funny man Javed Jafferi in the lead, pitted against the villainy of Gulshan Grover.

 The channel will announce a prize for its ongoing contest Kids Ka Kamaal; the winner will get to gift his/her mother a diamond set.

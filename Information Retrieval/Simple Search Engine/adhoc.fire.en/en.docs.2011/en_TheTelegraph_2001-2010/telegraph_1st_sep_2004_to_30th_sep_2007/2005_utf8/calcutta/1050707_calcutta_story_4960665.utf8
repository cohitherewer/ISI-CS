The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

 Three visits to two different multiplexes last week has left me a little broke. First, Parineeta (good), then Sarkar (good), and then a highly forgettable night show: War of the Worlds. Add to that the caramel popcorn, the cola and the parking, and the Metro story on Calcutta?s overpriced multiplex tickets becomes a real-life pocket-pincher. We are going to Mumbai on a business trip next week where we will probably see Yakeen. The popcorn and tickets are cheaper there.

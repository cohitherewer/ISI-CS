The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Games and the girl

Koena Mitra: Leading lady

Pamela Anderson might have announced on reel: ?Don?t 

call me babe!? but Koena Mitra is still screaming in real: ?Don?t call me an item 

girl.? After her extended special appearances in Musafir and Insan, 

Koena has finally struck it big in Bollywood ? she plays the leading lady opposite 

Fardeen Khan in Pritish Nandy?s new production Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena, written 

and directed by journalist-turned-film-maker Suparn Verma.

 ?It is an out-and-out masala film by Bollywood standards,? Koena told Metro from Mumbai. ?Shot totally in Mumbai, mainly outdoors, the film can?t be slotted in any genre. It?s a lot of fun but not just a comedy, it has fights but is not a hardcore action film and it can?t even be called a thriller.?

 While Koena was not too keen to talk about her replacing Bipasha Basu in the film, she was ready to reveal the plot. ?I play a psychiatrist who gets interested in the con artiste, played by Fardeen. The film then shows how he takes me to his world. There are also a lot of surprises at every turn of Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena.?

 The Bengali model-turned-actress is also excited about her director Varma. ?It?s his debut ? so he?s giving his heart and soul in the film. He sits with every scene and since he has written the script himself, once he narrates you can actually visualise the scene in front of your eyes. Even his treatment is quite different.?

 The Saki girl has good things to say about the film?s music too, scored by Pritam of Dhoom fame. ?We have only shot the title song, which will come on screen as the credits roll. It has a very international style to it and I have been given a 60s-70s look.?

 Mallika Sherawat and Akshay Kumar in London: 

More murder

 The best of Bollywood celebrated Holi in London on Friday. For the second time, after Dubai, the Zee Cine Awards was held abroad. This would remain a landmark as it is on stage that doyen Yash Chopra announced he would compete no more in the ?best director? category. So what if marching on and off the stage, to receive consecutive trophies for Veer-Zaara, he looked very much his sprightly self? But fans of the Yashraj Films banner need not despair as he has promised to continue making films.

 The evening would also be remembered for bringing Aishwarya Rai and Salman Khan on the same stage, so what if they appeared for different song-anddance items and Ash stayed seated beside Salman?s bete noire Vivek Oberoi (or should it be the other way round?) through the rest of the evening. It was a cosy evening for another pair of lovebirds ? John Abraham claimed his seat beside Bipasha Basu whenever he was not doing duty on stage, vrooming in on a yellow motorcycle to collect an award for Dhoom or telling the audience as MC the best pick-up line he had heard since the cop-and-robber film: ?Take me for a ride. And I am not talking about your bike.?

 Shah Rukh Khan, nominated for three films as best actor, did a star turn as announcer too, unveiling Zee?s new sleek logo. ZMZ simultaneously was rebranded Zee Studio, Zee English as Zee Caf? and Alpha Bangla as Zee Bangla.

 The final programme in BBC World?s Secrets of Antarctica series focuses on Rothera, a modern-day scientific research station in Antarctica, and the members of the British Antarctic Survey who are based there.

 The station itself is an environmental indicator, with retreating snow lines and the colonisation of plants and microbes made possible by global warming. The scientists are trying to understand how predicted climate change will affect the continent and the rest of the world. Catch the half-an-hour show on April 1 at 3 pm.

 Click Online, BBC World?s tech magazine, looks at blogging this week. Blogging has become a phenomenon over the past couple of years with some of the more popular online diaries now starting to have an impact on traditional media. The programme examines this fast-growing culture and also assesses the future of laptop computers, which are continually getting smaller and more powerful. The Webscape slot in the programme explains an easy and free way to organise digital pictures. Tune in on April 1 at 1 am.

 Theme for a dream

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Kids rsquo; cushions from Spaces. Picture by Rashbehari Das

If you worry about the rough edges of a toy trains engine or the maintenance of keeping live fish in your childs aquarium, play safe with the fake variety.

 Colourful cushions designed as a train engine attached to a wagon, a car, various kinds of fish and snails could keep the little ones happy for some time, at least.

 The roughly one-ft-by-one-ft cushions double as a cosy pillows for tiny tots to dream playfully on. Designed with colourful appliqu? work on strictly cotton fabric, the cushions pack in minute detailing, like the ridges on a snails shell with textured stitches.

 While the train engine with an attached wagon makes for a nice pillow, with its own side pillow set, the car cushions are also quite comfortable to plonk down on, shaped like the sturdy Ambassador. The snails are round and cosy too, but the fishes with their tails and fins sticking out are likely to serve more as surrogate teddies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The incredible suspension of disbelief

 They spend crores making their dream films. From Michael Mann to Ashutosh Gowariker to Ravi Kinnagi, the auteurs do not leave any stone unturned to claim that theirs is the best film in town. But even in the seventh or ninth draft of their scripts, they fail to identify the glaring loopholes that make the films look all so implausible. Here are some of the big bloopers of 2004.

 Kyun! Ho Gaya Na...: The inverted discus that served as a good luck charm around happy-go-lucky Arjun (Vivek Oberoi)?s neck is ceremoniously presented to Diya (Aishwarya Rai) to help her with her exam. The exam over, they visit a friend?s birthday party. And guess what? The charm is back around Arjun?s neck. A few scenes of welcome later, they sit at the dinner table. The charm is no longer there. Did Vivek silently pass it on to Ash during their off-camera t?te-a-t?tes? It reappears in the final act of the treasure hunt in Dia?s hometown, where she throws it to Ishaan (Suniel Shetty), Arjun?s rival in love.

 Swades: Ashutosh Gowariker has a picture of Satyajit Ray in his office, but he did not care to check the spelling of his film in Bengali on the title card carrying a mosaic in a variety of Indian languages. Result: a jarring error in the last ?s?. 

 In the opening scene, Shah Rukh walks out to the balcony with a friend towards a horizon darkening just after sunset, but when the camera zooms in, it is a pitch-dark night sky. The conversation over, they head back into the apartment; the time clock switches back again with the sky taking on a dark blue tint.

 Back to Charanpur and Mohan?s dream of ?lighting a bulb?. Mohan?s dream becomes reality, as his wishes are horses. How else does one explain a hydel power generation project rolling out in barely three weeks ? after drawing up the plan, making villagers understand, seeking help from colleagues in the US, digging a pool, cementing it, sourcing machines, setting pipelines across mountains et cetera et cetera? And in Gowariker?s Swades, the panchayat must be the last word in village administration. In our land, one surely needs permission from the government to divert a stream and set up a scheme of such magnitude.

 Collateral: There was plenty of unusual 

fare to break the Hollywood norm in 2004. But few caused as much hype as Collateral, 

just for the star?s new look, making a giant splash on the big screen in an anti-hero 

avatar.

 It worked. The Top Gun looked dashing in silver hair as the intense assassin, and director Michael Mann transformed an ordinary action thriller into a successful film noir suspense story. But while the life of a New York City cabbie, as one will tell you, can be real life inspiration for reel life, in Collateral, it crossed the line just a little bit.

 Cab driver Jamie Foxx had a few opportunities to escape the madman in the course of the night-long killing spree, and yet, he didn?t. In fact, he became quite the hero in the end, overcoming his fear. Cruise could have killed the cabbie and taken another ride ? he was, after all, a cold-blooded psychopathic assassin ? but chose to stick with the man who threw his laptop off a bridge. 

 Why? Who knows. The relationship between the two men was an ambiguous and complicated one. But it made Collateral come together in a way that had the viewer on the edge of the seat all through. There?s a lesson here, in making the improbable work to cinema?s advantage to make a film incredible.

 Bandhan: Imagine this: The heroine flees to Singapore to marry the hero, gets homesick and discusses everyone in the family except her twin sister. Why? Because director Ravi Kinnagi had to cook up another love story, like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. So, Koel No. 1 dies during childbirth, Jeet returns to his in-laws with their kid and love blooms again. This time with Koel No. 2. But why keep the twin-sister thing a secret? Because the girls, apparently, had decided to take Jeet by surprise one day! Hello, is anyone convinced?

 Classroom joys, caked in mud

 A red rag is Chhotu?s constant companion. The scrap hangs from the makeshift canopy that shelters the two-month-old, a faded gamchha suspended from stacks of unbaked bricks. He lies on another gamchha, the only protection from the sun-heated soil that is his bed. Chhotu?s mother piles grey blocks 10 feet away. She keeps an eye on him, as best she can.

 Families ? fathers, mothers and children ? are at work all around under the sweltering sun, carrying mud, moulding it into bricks, ready for the furnace.

 Hariharnagar mouza, just 40 km from Salt Lake, has been identified as one of two ?backward and vulnerable areas? of North 24-Parganas. There are around 25 brick fields here, attracting migrant workers from around Bengal, as well as Bangladesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and beyond.

 After the 2001 census found the area ? which has no permanent population ? without education, health, sanitation or other essential services of any kind, the district administration started a project to educate the migrant children. In February 2005, Prayasam, an NGO, set up three non-formal centres, supported by Unicef, for around 150 kids from six kilns in the area.

 There is a ?season? for brick making ? November to June. Labourers come when the rains leave, and go back to their native villages ? and little income ? when the monsoon returns. 

 Husbands and wives bring their children with them, older kids are put to work or made to look after the younger ones so mothers waste no time. The more bricks you make, the more you get paid.

 ?There is no child labour in our brick fields,? insists Ashok Rahara, president, Brick Field Association. ?The children you see fool around while their parents work.?

 Parents, too, deny the little ones are on the job. But ask the children, coated with mud, sitting in class after working in the bhata from 4 am till late in the evening.

 Last Thursday, a batch of 40-odd kids between the ages of three and 14 were at Sahaj Path One, where caked mud on tattered clothes is their only uniform. At Sahaj Path Three, where kids had their weekly off, they showed up squeaky clean.

 Taslima Khatoon chatters about her daily activities. ?I wash dishes and smoothen out bricks,? grins the five-year-old. Elder sister Rina has graduated ? she moulds and stacks them. Both have shaved heads to tackle the prickly heat.

 ?I work because abba told me to,? explains Rina. They work from around 4 am to 8 pm, with a few breaks in between. Three months ago, their favourite ? and only ? thing to do was make bricks. Now, it is coming to school, five days a week, around noon.

 It has taken time to get this far. When social workers first came to this hinterland, parents had two fears: that the babus would take their children and sell them or that police would lock them away for child labour.

 The upshot of the intervention is that apart from education, adult awareness is on the rise. Immunisation, health and hygiene, sanitation and even adult education are issues being explored by the Prayasam team.

 ?The target of the project is not child labour. Since the kids are away from their villages for six months of the year, they lose out on education,? explains Manoj Pant, district magistrate, North 24-Parganas. ?Working with bricks all day, they don?t have a proper environment to develop,? he adds.

 The system leaves parents and kids helpless. ?After Class IV or so, village schools refuse to let students continue if they are absent for half the year,? explains mother Ayesha Khatoon. So dropout rates skyrocket, though such roadblocks rarely dent child labour rates.

 But with every season taking these migrants to a different place, what is the guarantee that education ? even in this non-formal form ? will continue? ?If multi-activity centres can be set up in brick fields across the state, kids could have a continuing education,? explains Prayasam?s Amlan Ganguly.

 Fires burn underground, turning clay dredged from the canal-fed river into money. But on the surface, change will take a generation, if Taslima and Rina are lucky.

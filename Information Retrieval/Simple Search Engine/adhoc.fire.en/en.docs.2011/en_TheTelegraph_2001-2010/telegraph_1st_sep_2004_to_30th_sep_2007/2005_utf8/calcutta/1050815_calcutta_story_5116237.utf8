The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Big nite with Big A

 For 20 couples who won The Telegraph Ticket to the Stars contest and a handful of other guests, it was a memorable dinner date with Aamir Khan on Saturday

 ?The best thing about Calcutta is that the people are so loving and emotional. I am sure they are going to like my new film, The Rising, which has been made with so much love and care. And I am going to be back here in six or eight months with my next film Rang De Basanti,? said Aamir, before mingling with the guests for the evening.

 What can I say about Aamir Khan? He is the Big A of the industry.?

 That, kind of, summed up the awe and admiration the winners of The Telegraph Ticket to the Stars promotion, at the Oberoi Grand on Saturday night, had for the small man with a towering presence.

 Aamir spent a good hour and more with 20 couples chosen to dine with the hero on the basis of their SMS entries, making their hour-and-a-half wait well worth it. Watching Dil Chahta Hai was an entertaining diversion till then, but their evening began at 9.45 pm when the star of Mangal Pandey ? The Rising walked through the Ballroom door.

 ?It?s a pleasure to be here in Calcutta....,? said Aamir, followed by Toby Stephens and Ketan Mehta, before the winners were invited up on stage to get their photographs clicked and autograph books signed.

 As Aamir smiled and chatted with every eager fan, the more enthusiastic seized the moment, grabbed the mike and praised the star to the August skies.

 And by the time Aamir bid adieu close to 11 pm, he had given the hundred-odd guests a night to talk about for years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Damage bill put at 1.5 crore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The hit that Howrah bridge took on Friday afternoon has caused ?sufficient damage?, with the effects likely to linger for at least two months.

 The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), entrusted with the upkeep of Howrah bridge, said prima facie evidence suggested that the ?bridge barge? would cost it Rs 1.5 crore to repair.

 Anup K. Chanda, chairman of the CPT, said it would take at least 60 days to fix the faults caused by the accident.

 The port had just completed maintenance work on the bridge but the MV Moni mishap means that it would be back on bridge with a full repair plan.

 ?Initial investigation suggests damage under the structure, even though the deck of the bridge seems to have been saved,? Chanda told Metro.

 ?There are no problems as far as movement on the bridge is concerned. But we will carry out further tests to ensure that no damage was done to the deck,? he added.

 Further ?confirmatory examinations? will be carried out for the sake of public safety.

 The port has decided to sue Ganges River Transport Company Private Ltd, the company that owns MV Moni, for damages. 

 The mast of the barge has damaged two of the six girders that support the structure at that point. It also smashed into the trolley channel that the CPT had built recently for inspection of the under-structure.

 ?We will have to assess the damage to these supporting beams and the extent of strength loss in them. That may take one or two days,? said Captain A.K. Bagchi, director, marine department of the CPT, overseeing operations on the spot.

 According to CPT guidelines, there should be a clearance of 51 ft under the bridge during the lowest end of the low tide.

 The port circulates tide charts predicting the schedule of high and low tides for the benefit of all ships and barges. Sea-going ships are not allowed to move upstream beyond Kidderpore dock.

 MV Moni on Friday broke the rules and strayed from its sailing path to cause the first such accident on the Hooghly in the 62-year-old history of Howrah bridge, as we know it.

 The high tide drama on Friday afternoon has prompted the CPT to push for a comprehensive traffic regulation binding on all vessels plying on the river.

 The port has also proposed a traffic superviser to control the movement of vessels. 

 ?We are trying to promote inland water transport in a big way, since Calcutta is a riverine port. So, we have to streamline the entire process to avert such mishaps in future,? said CPT chairman Chanda.

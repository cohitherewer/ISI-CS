 Up above the world: An electrician at work 

on a street light 

 Apropos Amit Datta?s photograph entitled ?Light at 

a height?, April 25, was the young electrician, precariously perched atop a traffic 

light, aware that he was playing with his life? 

 The daredevil?s youth could have made him oblivious to the immense dangers of the work. Or why else would he not wear even a safety belt? Does his job pay him enough to take such risks? Doesn?t the department concerned with maintaining the lights have portable ladders? 

 The brave man can earn a hundred times more by performing such stunts in Hollywood. Looking at the photograph carefully, I found that only the left leg of the youth was helping him hang on to the post. A slight dizziness due to the heat, an electric shock (he was working on a live line) or a sudden attack of cramps could have spelt his doom for he surely would not have survived a fall from that height. 

 The department that maintains the light would have compensated his family with around a lakh rupees and the chapter would have been closed. 

 The youth had certainly made a grave mistake by taking a risk like that, but his supervisor had committed a graver offence. It was unpardonable on his part to let the youth work like that. 

 I believe the electrician was forced to repair the lights in a hurry as it was in a VVIP zone (Esplanade East side of the Raj Bhavan gates). 

 No VVIP is more important than a man?s life. Allowing the youth to work like that was a criminal offence. The authorities must look into the matter and punish the people responsible so that such acts are not repeated.

The article ?HS, crisper and current?, April 25, highlights the dismal situation that HS students have to face, but does not accurately analyse the plight of ISC and ICSE students. It is not true that ISC students in Calcutta cannot compete at the national level because their syllabus is attuned to JEE only. The ISC syllabus covers most topics dealt with in the CBSE syllabus. The HS syllabus is definitely not on a par with the ISC syllabus in this respect. It is unfortunate that even then, marks are docked off ISC students during admission to colleges in the state.

It is disheartening that students from the state who 

secure very high marks in Madhyamik fare miserably in the all-India pre-medical 

exams. The HS syllabus needs to be revamped to provide a fighting chance to these 

students. 

B.N. Bose,

It is a matter of shame that only two out of 160 students 

who scored 93 per cent in Madhyamik 2003 cleared the preliminary stage of a national-level 

competitive examination. The unsuccessful students will naturally lose their self-confidence, 

all because of the regressive syllabus formulated by the HS council.

Apropos the article ?Children as champs?, April 25, it was very heartening to note that students of The Heritage School have competed successfully in the Sidney International Open Taekwon-Do Championship and brought laurels for themselves as well as the country. Their steely resolve is reflected in the statement of little Harsh, when he says that they ?were not scared?. Mrityunjoy Roy, the coach, should be hailed for instilling such mental strength into the students. The one jarring note in the article was struck by the headmistress when she said that participation in such competitions does create a divide. Since the students are representing the school, it should sponsor them fully. And I believe it is quite capable of doing so.

Apropos the report ?Design basics for job skills?, April 23, it is commendable that the state urban development agency and Calcutta Urban Service for the Poor have come together to help train underprivileged women in fashion technology in association with National Institute of Fashion Technology. But it is doubtful whether the poor women will be able to make inroads into the world of fashion, which is dominated by the rich and influential.

Uproar over another patient?s death due to ?medical negligence? has prompted the chief medical officer of health (CMOH) of Howrah to start checking the credentials of the accused doctors (Patient death sets off state probe, April 26). But it is not clear how the credentials would help the CMOH decide whether the doctors were negligent or not. By now, the common people of the state must be tired of hearing promises of ?investigation? by the health department heads following such deaths. The reports of the investigations rarely see the light of the day.

Apropos the report ?Judge steps in to clean up temple?, April 23, it is good news that an Alipore district and sessions court judge has passed an order to stamp out irregularities in the running of the Kalighat temple. Thousands of devotees visit the temple every month, so everything must be done to ensure that it functions smoothly. The sacrifice of goats on the temple premises hurts the sentiments of many visitors. I request the temple authority to stop the barbaric practice. 

Prahlad Agarwala,

It is indeed shameful that Ileena Dasgupta murdered her own sister to claim her property (Couple held for murder, April 21). People seem to be becoming more self-centred, materialistic and cruel every day. 

Mahelaka Begum,

Christopher Road. 

It is really sad that man committed suicide due to torture by his son and daughter-in-law (Tortured father takes life, April 29). A law to protect the aged from their progenies is urgently needed. 

Purnima Vasudeva,

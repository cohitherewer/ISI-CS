 He got the best lines as Alfred Pennyworth, transforming the once dependable but hopelessly boring butler into a funny guy in Batman Begins. Not only did he ?never? give up on Master Bruce Wayne, he saved him when he was inches away from death and came up with the clever plan to remodel the Bat Cave.

 But then, Michael Caine is known for making the most of whatever lines he gets. Even when he is nominated for a Razzie for starring in Jaws: The Revenge, he comes up with winners like this: ?I have never seen it (the film), but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.?

 Fortune has not always favoured Sir Maurice Joseph Micklewhite. Struggle through the early years of poverty (his father was a fish-market porter and his mother a char-lady), bit parts, army service and odd jobs may have made the Briton likely to take roles to pay the bills. But even in miserable flops, Caine has been noticed, and largely loved.

 It was only after the success of the 1964 film Zulu, by which time Caine had been trying to make an industry breakthrough for eight years, followed by The Ipcress File and Alfie, did the man with the Cockney accent and twinkle in his eye finally arrive.

 For him, success was a victory for the lower classes. He was now an icon for the masses, proof that their dreams, too, could come true. That they, too, could ?get the girl?.

 Now that age has finally caught up with him at 72, in the past few years, the unlikely hero seems to have settled into the role of the father figure. He has played dad to Nicole Kidman in the upcoming Bewitched, to Nicholas Cage in The Weatherman and even to Mike Myers aka Austin Powers in Goldmember. In Miss Congeniality he was, once again, mentor to Sandra Bullock.

 His career spans almost 50 years, being knighted in 2000 winning two Oscars for Best Supporting Actor for Hannah and her Sisters and more recently in The Cider House Rules.

 This is only after his leading man potential was dismissed by one director who felt he looked gay on screen. The turning point was on stage as Peter O?Toole?s understudy in The Long and the Short and the Tall. He has since been seen in delightful romps like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and in TV miniseries? like Jack the Ripper, in below par comedy such as Blame it on Rio and alongside Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King, and in favourites like Educating Rita. He has dabbled in production, backing projects like The Fourth Protocol, Pulp and Get Carter.

 Life, too, has settled into a happier pattern. A failed marriage, battling the bottle, shifting to the States to escape taxes and then moving base back to Britain, Caine has had his share of ups and downs. But for the past 32 years, Shakira, his wife of Indian origin and a former Miss Guyana, who Caine fell in love with at first sighting in a coffee advert on TV, has been by his side.

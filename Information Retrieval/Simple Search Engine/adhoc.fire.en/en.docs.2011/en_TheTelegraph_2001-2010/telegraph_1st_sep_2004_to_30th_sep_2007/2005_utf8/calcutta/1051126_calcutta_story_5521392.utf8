 Futuristic photography

 Photographic images represent the perspective of their creator instead of being merely a mute document of reality. Writing with Light, the ongoing exhibition of photographs by Mexican lensman Pedro Meyer, thus presents viewers with a diversity of ideas, holding their attention through a set of dynamic, visual dialogues. Rather than coming up with particular answers, the works on show raise many questions, which the observer might wish to respond to. A truly ?digital renaissance man?, Meyer has experimented with modern digital photography tools with great success. His digitally-mastered images seek to question the media itself, as much as it explores the medium, and what it can deliver in terms of aesthetic experience. To this end, he investigates the notion of portraits in the current series, attributing to them an entirely new dimension and direction.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by Pedro Meyer

 When: Till November 27, 4 pm - 8 pm

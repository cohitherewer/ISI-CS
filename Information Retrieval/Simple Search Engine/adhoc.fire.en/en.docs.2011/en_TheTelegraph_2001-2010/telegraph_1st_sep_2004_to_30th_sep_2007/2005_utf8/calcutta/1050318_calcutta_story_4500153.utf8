 Clear clutter for energy flow 

 Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, homes breathe like human 

beings and should be kept clutter-free. Any kind of heavy storage in the north-east 

of the house should be cleared to make room for a library or study

Q: We are a small family and live in a spacious house. All the rooms are well furnished, but because they are unoccupied they are kept under lock and key. The entire junk of the house, mostly ancestral, is stored in the north-west and north-east rooms. Is it in accordance with Feng Shui rules?

 Name withheld

The Solution: Homes are like human bodies that 

also breathe like human beings. To help this process, rooms that are not used 

regularly should be also aired and cleaned every morning. North-east is associated 

with god?s blessings, so storing junk here is not advised. This obstructs the 

flow of blessings into the house. This part is also connected with education and 

mind. Any kind of heavy storage here puts direct pressure on the mind. You should 

clear this room and convert it into a study, library or a temple. North-west is 

connected with mentors and helpful people. Keep things that you would actually 

require and get rid of the rest.

Q: We will be moving into a huge 

flat, which is actually two apartments combined together. As a result there are 

two entrances from the north. One door faces the staircase rising to the door 

and the other faces the steps leading to the upper floor. We would like to know 

which door should be used.

Smridhi Khaitan

The Solution: The rising stairs leading to 

the door are very similar to the rising steps that lead to a temple. Hence they 

are considered to be auspicious. Whereas, those leading to the upper floor seem 

to be rising up, but actually they are descending from where people live on the 

upper floor. The main entrance is considered to be the mouth of the house from 

where the cosmic Chi enters and brings good luck and prosperity. If your main 

door faces the descending stairs, the Chi entering the house is unproductive. 

Facing descending stairs every time you step out of the door is like going down 

in life.

Q: We had bought an apartment a few years 

back, but finally have decided to move into it now. The flat is designed such 

that the master bedroom, on the south-west, is at a higher level than the other 

rooms. A few steps leading to it face the entrance directly. Is this arrangement 

okay or should we change the entrance door? Secondly, the north-east of the flat 

has a kitchen, which we would like to convert into a temple. Please guide.

Siddhartha Suri 

The Solution: Having the master bedroom in 

the south-west and that too at an elevated position is an excellent arrangement. 

But stairs facing the main entrance are not productive at all as they symbolically 

drain away the health and wealth of the residents. Changing the entrance door 

will be the best solution and luckily you have an option to do that. North-east 

is undoubtedly the best area for the temple, but before you make the change please 

check how people living above and below your flat are using that area. If they 

have also converted their kitchens into temples it is fine, otherwise you cannot 

have a temple sandwiched between two kitchens above and below where the fire element 

is too strong. You can make a temple in the east of the house.

 Bear baubles

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 A kids world is not limited to a few teddies and toys anymore. Pester power is at work at its peskiest best one would think, looking at the mind-boggling array of childrens special stuff on the racks.

 And the Chinese sure know how to pamper little tykes it seems, offering adorable products at reasonable prices.

 Beni Bear is one such Chinese brand, producing objects of desire like mini dustbin with cute teddy motifs and an in-built thermometer to read room temperature. 

 If this seems like a ploy to inculcate cleaner habits among children, there is some incentive to sit at the study table too. Sturdy but colourful table lamps made of a kind of resin with figurines of a kid sleeping peacefully on a cot and teddies fawning over it or a lamp with a photo frame are a few options in this range.

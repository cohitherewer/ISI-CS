 State forest officials on Thursday busted an inter-state racket trading in skin and organs of wild animals with the help of Mathurapur police. Three persons were arrested.

 ?We recovered leopard and deer skins in the swoop. The animals were killed either in north Bengal or in northern India,? said Atanu Kumar Raha, director of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve.

 Abdul Reza Laskar was arrested in Gunjirpur, under Mathurapur police station, when he walked into a trap laid for him by the government officers and the cops.

 The forest department officers had earlier received specific information that the poaching-smuggling racket was active in the Sunderbans for quite some time. The officers then contacted the gang, through a source, posing as buyers. Soon, a meeting with the gang was arranged.

 An eight-member team, including beat officers, forest officers and two local cops, was sent to the meeting place.

 While two team members walked up to Laskar and his accomplice, the rest waited at a distance. Laskar was arrested as soon as he produced the animal skins. His accomplice, however, managed to flee. 

 The leopard and chital skins, six-ft and five-ft long, respectively, were seized. A few tests on them confirmed that they were real. There were bullet marks on them that indicated that the animals were shot by the poachers, an officer said.

 Later, two more gang members were arrested in Dhakuria. 

 ?After interrogating Laskar, we have got leads about the other gang members. More arrests are likely,? director Raha said. Officers said the poachers and smugglers were using West Bengal as a transit point.

 ?Leopards and chitals are found in the forests of North India, including parts of north Bengal, but not in the Sunderbans. Thus, it can be concluded that they were first poached and then transported into West Bengal,? said a forest department official.

 ?Rare species are poached in the fauna-rich forests, ranging from the Gir in Gujarat to the Sunderbans here. The sprawling trade in animal skin has managed to spread its network to smuggle the skins and organs out of the country. West Bengal is a preferred transit point because of its porous border with Bangladesh,? the officer signed off.

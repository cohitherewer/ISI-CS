 Bullet ends love triangle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Information technology student Suman Basu, 23, was shot dead in the fall-out of a triangular love affair, according to the police after a preliminary investigation. 

 Suman?s friend Biswajit has been detained for questioning. His other friends, including girl friend Sagarika, will also be questioned, a senior police officer said.

 ?We have found some major leads in this case and hope to crack it soon,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 Suman, a third-year student at B.P. Poddar Engineering College, in Kaikhali, was a resident of Bamunmura, in Barasat, North 24-Parganas. 

 A relationship developed between Suman and Sagarika, a law student. ?They used to spend a lot of time together and went out on regular outings,? said a neighbour of Suman.

 Recently, Suman befriended local youth Biswajit, a graduate in hotel management and thereby, Biswajit was introduced to Sagarika. The trio became close friends. 

 In the course of investigation, the police came to know that on Monday evening, Suman, Sagarika and Biswajit went to a restaurant in Barasat. Police suspect the murder was planned there elaborately. They are now looking for a cell phone which a police officer termed the ?clincher?. 

 He, however, didn?t divulge details of the cell phone. ?We think the cell phone is a major lead in this case. Once we get it, we hope we will be able to solve the case fast,? he added.

 Suman?s body was recovered from Gobinda Barrack area, in the Barasat police station area, on Monday night. He had been shot dead. 

 His family is building a new house at Gobinda Barrack. The police are trying to find out under what circumstances and why Suman went to Gobinda Barrack.

 Additional superintendent of police (north), Dilip Banerjee said: ?Sagarika and Biswajit were with the murdered student minutes before he was shot dead.? 

 On Monday night and throughout Tuesday, some friends of Suman were questioned by the police. 

 ?We have interrogated a host of people in connection with this case. But it is too early to make any arrest,? said additional police superintendent Banerjee.

 Suman?s father Swapan is the North 24-Parganas secretary of a brick kiln-owners? body. He lodged a complaint with Barasat police after the discovery of his son?s body. 

 Suman?s death has left his neighbours stunned. One of them said he was ?a brilliant student and a nice boy. He never kept bad company. We can?t believe he has been murdered. This came as a terrible blow for us?.

 Twin tides of emotion

 Like tidal waves breaking on the shores of human consciousness, Dui Taranga, two short, one-act plays, open in our hearts a flood of dormant emotions and sensibilities. Concerned with issues as different from each other as the ebb and flow of the rising and falling tides, both acts, nevertheless, bring to focus the essential loneliness of mankind and the need to abate the sense of desolation and isolation that exists in us. The first play is the story of a solitary woman who recounts memories of her past with a stranger on a park bench. It deals with problems that arise from an inability to communicate or share feelings with near and dear ones. The woman?s futile search for a slice of sunshine in her life highlights the pathos of her condition, trapped in the insular web of her sorrow and unable to express the depths of her alienation. Sending ripples across the sands of passion, the second act traces a writer?s frantic search for love. Exploring the rhythms and nuances of romance with humour and sensitivity, it makes love appear elusive and shadowy. Directed by Dolly Basu, who, along with Chandranath Chatterjee, also comprises the cast of both acts.

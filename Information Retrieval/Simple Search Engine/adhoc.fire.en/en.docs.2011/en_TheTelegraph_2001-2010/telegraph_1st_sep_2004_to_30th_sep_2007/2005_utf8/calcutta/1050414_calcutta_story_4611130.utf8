 Call of creativity, with pencil in hand

 Pradip Das has a penchant for art. He loves to draw. Now, he?s all set to make a career out of it, as soon as he completes a course in animation. Pradip is hearing impaired. 

 That has so far not stopped the 17-year-old from signing up for a course on animation at The Academy of Animation Arts and Technology. From April 1, the boy born in the Dhakuria slums has become the academy?s first handicapped student. He can?t hear or speak, but Pradip is determined to cross the hurdles.

 The youngster from Tollygunge was a student of the NGO Reach?s school, where teacher Ranjini Mukherjee spotted his artistic talents. ?I have been teaching him since he was about eight years old. He passed Class VIII, but wasn?t interested in academics. So I had a talk with the other authorities here, and we decided to give him a chance, since he was an ideal candidate, barring his impairment,? adds Mukherjee, head of the academy.

 She acts his translator, as and when required. ?But the course is mainly visual and manual, with paper and pencil. So he doesn?t have that many problems. He?s much younger than the others in the group, most of whom are around 20 years old, but manages fine. He loves having his own place to work,? says Mukherjee.

 The project Pradip is working on at the moment is bouncing balls. ?Ektu shokto (a little difficult),? he signals, but not insurmountable. Practise makes perfect. The six-month course is what he?s signed up for, but it is to be completed in a year. Pradip?s success will mean one out of the 10 students in every batch will be a hearing-impaired child, promises Mukherjee.

 But the training isn?t free, because ?otherwise he won?t realise the true value?. The fee of Rs 5,000 per month was not possible for his family to afford ? his father is jobless, his mother a domestic help, his older sister is a beautician and his younger sister a tailor. So Pradip?s parents pay Rs 100 per month. ?When he starts working, he?ll pay back some of the leftover amount. That will give him a sense of purpose,? adds Mukherjee.

 The ace footballer ? he?s a member of a team that practises regularly at Vivekananda Park ? has other talents up his sleeve, too. ?He?s an excellent mime artist, having acted in school plays, which is very helpful for animation. We have regular mime workshops ? by hearing-impaired artistes ?at the academy. Pradip sometimes teaches the students mime,? smiles the proud teacher.

 Marriage Pradip wants, he admits with a shy smile, but once he?s out of the academy, a job doing what he loves is the priority. Drawing, he says through sign language, is his passion. And creativity comes naturally.

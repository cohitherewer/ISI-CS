 Birdie boost for base of business

 SUBHRO SAHA

 For a while now, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Advantage Bengal government has been striving to drive home the need to leverage the birdie to attract business to the city.

 Diamond IT Village, an infotech-golf-residential-entertainment-academic combination, set to come up close to the showpiece New Town in Rajarhat, could achieve a hole-in-one.

 IT below and tee-off above is the pitch for the property to be developed by the Diamond Group, a consortium led by A.N. Shroff, with the objective of ?attracting export units, IT firms, MNCs and NRIs to Calcutta, and generating employment to the tune of two lakh-plus?.

 To be built over five years around four hubs, it hopes to cover around 10 million sq ft of built space. Forty per cent of this will be for the IT park and the rest for the residential component, malls, cineplex, a five-star hotel, country club, educational institutions, medical utilities, art gallery and all.

 The four essential arms of the development would be an 18-hole championship golf course by an international designer, a 25-acre special economic zone for non-polluting industries, residencies in the form of villas, apartments and condominiums, commercial and entertainment facilities.

 ?While the IT park will be below ground, the golf course, the low-rise residential blocks and other elements will be camouflaged by extensive designer landscaping on a higher level above,? says Shroff.

 Diamond IT Village aims to attract a steady stream of international business tourists, particularly from countries like Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. And the fairways have been identified as the fulcrum to swing business traffic.

 Hong Kong-based Asian Professional Golf Association Services (APGA) will plan and design the 18-hole, 120-acre championship course. APGA will also assist in attracting top players, besides arranging for international coaches to visit the complex.

 ?We are seeking single-window clearance for the project and construction time from start to finish will be five years,? says Shroff. Leading global real estate consultant CB Richard Ellis has done the feasibility study and will help plan and market the project.

 International Leisure Consultants Ltd of Hong Kong, engaged in development of integrated golf and residential resorts, will also chip in.

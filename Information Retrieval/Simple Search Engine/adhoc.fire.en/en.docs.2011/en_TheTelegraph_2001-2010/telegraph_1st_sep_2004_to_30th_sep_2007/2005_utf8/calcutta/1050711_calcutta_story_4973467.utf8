 More than 500 women hit the streets of Behala on Sunday morning, to protest an alleged incident of bride-burning. The mob damaged the residence and the car of the in-laws, who were later arrested. 

 The women were protesting the death of Sagarika Das, alias Dola, 23, who sustained burns in her house on Becharam Chatterjee Street, in Behala. 

 Dola married Subir four years ago, after a long affair. Her parents were against the match, as she was an MA in history, while Subir wasn?t highly qualified and did odd jobs for a living. 

 ?Subir and his family started torturing Dola soon after the marriage. She would ask us not to complain, fearing her husband?s wrath,? recounted Dipti Karmakar, the deceased?s mother. 

 According to Dola?s father Sujit, things came to a head on the night of June 4. Around 1.30 am, neighbours saw smoke emanating from the Becharam Chatterjee Street house and heard the young woman?s screams. The family, however, assured the neighbours that nothing was wrong. 

 In the morning, Dola was taken to MR Bangur Hospital in a critical condition. ?We shifted her to SSKM Hospital, where she expired on July 7. She is survived by her two-year-old son Akashneel,? wept mother Dipti.

 ?I did not dare lodge a complaint against Subir and his family as he and his friends threatened to kill Akash if we did so,? alleged father Sujit.

 Residents of the area organised a procession of over 500 women on Sunday morning to protest the alleged murder. Trouble broke out after Subir?s friends passed comments on the agitators. The group turned violent, and pelted stones at the house, before pushing the family?s Ambassador into a pond. 

 Behala police brought the situation under control and posted a picket in front of the house. The angry protesters then demonstrated in front of the police station, demanding arrest of the culprits.

 Dola?s father later lodged an FIR, which led to the arrest of Subir, along with his mother, sister, elder brother and his wife. ?We are looking for two others named in the FIR, who are absconding,? said an officer of the police station.

 Highrises under civic scanner

 - RULE SHIFT TO AMEND LACK OF DATABANK

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation wants a civil engineering faculty member from IIT Kharagpur, Jadavpur University or Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, to scan all multi-storeyed projects. A Telegraph picture

 About 50 towers ? 10 storeys and above ? are coming up in the city, though the civic authorities do not possess any databank on multi-storeyed buildings.

 To make up for the lapse, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) building department plans to include a provision in the building rules that makes screening of plans for building 10 storeys and above mandatory. 

 A faculty member from the civil engineering department of IIT Kharagpur, Jadavpur University or Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, will scan all multi-storeyed projects.

 ?The practice will provide engineering colleges with an opportunity to increase their earnings by offering their expertise and to be involved in field-level studies,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 The civic authorities will forward the proposal to the state government for its inclusion in the building rules.

 ?It?s surprising that at least 50 highrises are coming up in the city after obtaining sanction from the civic building department, but the CMC has no record of their test reports and structural designs,? said mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De.

 What building department engineers do is just put stamp of approval on drawings submitted by private structural engineers, without any field-level inspection.

 Engineers in the building department think they are incapable of monitoring construction of a highrise as the CMC lacks a databank on soil condition, permissible limit of height in various areas depending on soil condition and the requirement of extra reinforcement at the foundation if the height of a building goes beyond the permissible limit.

 According to city architect (south) Somnath Pal, the fire services department considers any construction above 14.5 metres a ?high-risk? structure. According to the CMC?s definition, however, a building can be called a highrise if it is more than six storeys or 18 metres high.

 ?It?s time active technical screening of plans for highrises was started in the interest of public safety and security,? said director-general (building) Pranab Kumar Basu.

 A senior engineer in the building department said following the collapse of developer Pradeep Kundalia?s building about a decade ago, the CMC made it mandatory for all construction proposals to be certified by a registered structural engineer. ?This was the CMC?s strategy to avoid responsibility,? he said.

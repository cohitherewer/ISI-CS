The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State bus proposes monthly tickets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The cash-strapped Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) has mulled a ?pre-Puja gift? for passengers to earn a lump sum at the beginning of every month.

 The transport body wants to introduce monthly tickets and is awaiting the transport department?s nod.

 ?The monthly tickets will help us mop up substantial revenue in the first week of every month. A vast section of commuters will opt for them to avoid the ordeal of purchasing tickets daily on crowded buses,? CSTC managing director Ashoke Bhattacharya said on Tuesday.

 He has requested transport department officials to implement the system at the earliest. ?The monthly tickets, which will have our hologram and a photograph of the passenger, will be available from our depots across the city,? he added.

 The daily earning from a state bus now ranges between Rs 17 lakh and Rs 18 lakh. ?We want to increase it to Rs 22 lakh before the Pujas,? an official told Metro.

 To further boost revenue generation, CSTC is also planning to expand its services to Metro stations to enable commuters to avail of government buses, instead of private transport.

 A similar proposal was mooted in 1999 at a meeting between representatives of Metro Railway and CSTC, but it did not materialise. ?We have decided to take up the matter again with the Metro authorities. We want government buses to cater to Metro commuters at all stations from Belgachhia to Tollygunge,? managing director Bhattacharya said.

 The transport body has also undertaken a month-long training for its 4,000-odd conductors and drivers. 

 ?Drivers and conductors, who are mostly above 48, need motivation. Regular training will keep them fit and help them ply more carefully in a congested city like Calcutta,? he observed.

 To check revenue pilferage, the corporation has intensified vigil on ?dishonest? conductors and drivers. ?Henceforth, officials will travel on buses to keep a tab on the conductors,? Bhattacharya added.

 The CSTC has another cause for concern: the 25-odd women conductors. They have complained of stress resulting from standing in crowded buses for long hours and teasing and harassment by passengers.

 The women conductors were recruited in 1989-90, as the government then had taken a policy to provide job to the next of kin of those who had died in harness.

 Bhattacharya admitted that a group of women conductors had called on him last Friday and demanded that they be relieved of the stressful duty. ?Their grievances are genuine, but it is not possible to withdraw them now,? he argued. 

 Officials, however, denied any knowledge about the harassment the conductors reportedly face from passengers.

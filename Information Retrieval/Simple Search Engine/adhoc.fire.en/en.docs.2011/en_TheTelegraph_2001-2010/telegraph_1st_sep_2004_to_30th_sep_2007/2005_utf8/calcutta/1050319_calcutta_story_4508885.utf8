 An Odissi odyssey

 Tollygunge Club, in association with Officers Choice, Apeejay Surrendra and Open Doors, presents an evening of Odissi dance by noted classical danseuse Sharmila Biswas, who will be accompanied by 40 dancers of the Orissa Vision and Movement (OVM) Centre. Featuring excerpts from Sutra, the latest production choreographed by Biswas, the dance presentation takes the audience on a breathtaking journey that shows the evolution of Odissi as a classical dance form. Sparkling glimpses of this visually enticing piece traces Odissi?s origin in temple dance, its representation in ancient temple sculptures, the zenith of its popularity from the 12th to 16th centuries, its ban during British rule and a glorious resurrection thereafter. Integrating various dance traditions of Orissa like gotipua, danda, karma and sankeertan into the presentation, Sutra projects classical dance as an aesthetic vision of society. Also featuring excerpts from the popular dance composition, Prerna.

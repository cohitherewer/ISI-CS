 Remodel rein on realtors 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court ruled on Thursday that the promoter of an apartment building would have to obtain permission from owners of all flats in it, if he wants to expand or restructure the construction on the basis of a revised plan.

 ?The promoter of a building has no absolute right to expand or restructure the building without prior permission of the owners of the flats therein,? a single bench of the high court said.

 Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta added that civic bodies and other appropriate authorities would be responsible for verifying whether the promoter or developer of a building has obtained prior sanction of the flat-owners before considering a revised plan for subsequent construction.

 While delivering the verdict, the court also observed that flat-owners were shareholders of the land on which their apartment building has been constructed. 

 The court order will restrain realtors from restructuring apartments already sold by them. The order will also empower flat-owners to take legal steps against developers for making changes in building construction.

 Hundreds of cases relating to promoters violating agreements and restructuring apartment buildings are pending in different courts, a lawyer dealing with real estate cases said. The judgment will be a precedent in such cases, he added.

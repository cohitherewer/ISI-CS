The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tribunals to ease case clog

 SARDER AMJAD ALI, president of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association, met readers of The Telegraph at his Bar Council office to answer their queries. 

Participants included Lalit Singh Nahar, S.K. Khettry, Diptimoy Ghosh, Sourish Misra, Amitava Gupta, S. Halder, Chandrima Ghosh and Subhayu Pal

Amitava Gupta: The number of cases pending in the courts is increasing by the day. Why is it taking so long to dispose of cases?

 People are becoming more conscious about their rights. When a person is harassed or tortured and fails to get justice from the administration, he approaches the court. The number of courts is, however, not sufficient, and neither do they have enough judges to tackle all these cases. Hence, cases are piling up each day.

Chandrima Ghosh: School vacations have been cut short, but the courts still go for long holidays. Given the backlog of cases, why aren?t alternative arrangements made? 

 Arrangements to settle cases outside courts have already been launched. The court procedures have also been truncated and administrative tribunals set up to ease the burden of cases.

 For example, there are state administrative tribunals, tribunals of customs and central excise, and a gold control tribunal. If the litigants are not satisfied with the hearing in these tribunals, they can move the court.

S. Halder: While all courts follow the Constitution, why do verdicts differ from court to court?

 The verdict of a case might differ from judge to judge due to different interpretation of the legal clauses involved.

Subhayu Pal: Is our legal framework an ideal one?

 Our legal system is not ideal. It is based on some hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the administration is not doing any wrong, and neither are the police. However, we all know that the administration and police often makes mistakes. 

S. Halder: Can a person move a court after losing a case over the matter in a higher court? 

 That would be illegal. A case moves from lower court to higher court. The path is never reversed. A person who moves a court concealing the fact that he had lost a case in a higher court over the same matter can be tried and punished. He can even be charged with contempt.

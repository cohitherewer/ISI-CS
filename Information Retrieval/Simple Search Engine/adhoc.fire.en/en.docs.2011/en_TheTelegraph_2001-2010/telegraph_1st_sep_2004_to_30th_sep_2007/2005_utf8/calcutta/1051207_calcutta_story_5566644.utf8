 Yes. In India, the Harry Potter craze started from the third book in 1999-2000. Before that, the children?s books section used to grow at 10-12 per cent over the previous year. But in these past five years, the growth rate has increased to 16-17 per cent, while in all other sections the figure remains 10-12 per cent. While Harry Potter itself accounts for much of the increase in sales, other books like Enid Blyton are also moving faster off the shelves. A marked change in behavioural pattern has been children taking more interest in the buying process. Before Harry Potter, parents would come asking for children?s books. Now children not only accompany them, but they also know exactly what they want.

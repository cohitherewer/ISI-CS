The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CU readies for long chat with President

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Students, teachers and staff at Calcutta University (CU) are gearing up for a special curtain-raiser to its 150th anniversary celebrations ? a tele-conference with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 Their counterparts in Mumbai and Chennai universities, which were also set up along with CU in 1857, will also take part in the prestigious event, scheduled to be held next month.

 Calcutta University, for the first time in its history, will organise the tele-conference with President. The programme will be aired live in the three universities and the President will simultaneously address the participants from Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 In Calcutta, the participants will be seated in the university?s Centenary Hall. A mega-screen will be installed outside the auditorium to enable other students and staff to view the conference.

 Their counterparts in the other two cities will also assemble on their respective university premises.

 The three universities had recently sent a proposal to the President?s office to organise the one-hour tele-conversation as a curtain-raiser to their year-long 150th anniversary celebrations, which will kick off on January 24.

 ?We are making the necessary arrangements for the conference after getting the nod from the President?s office,? Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), told Metro.

 The vice-chancellors of the three universities had suggested tentative dates between August-end and September for the event. 

 Sources in Calcutta University said the programme will be held on the date that suits the President. 

 At present, the university officials are awaiting a confirmation from the President?s office about the date.

 Highly-sophisticated gadgets have to be installed in and outside CU?s Centenary Hall as the tele-conference will be held through satellite links. 

 The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will provide the technology and instal the necessary equipment.

 With not much time left before the D-Day, CU has issued a circular to the heads of all departments, professors and deans of faculties to start rehearsing for the talk session with the students.

 ?The President has expressed his wish to interact with as many students as possible,? an official said. As desired by President Kalam, students will be allowed to raise any issue they like. 

 ?But they must do some homework first. This is a prestigious event, especially because Mumbai and Chennai universities are also participating,? a CU official said.

 The entire programme will be recorded and preserved in the CU archive.

 Sound and fury over Netaji show

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Forward Bloc, a constituent of the ruling Left Front government, criticised the CPM on Thursday for not keeping a promise it had made more than eight years ago. 

 Former chief minister Jyoti Basu had promised Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh that the government would set up a light-and-sound show at Eden Gardens depicting the life and works of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. 

 However, no move to implement the project has been made till date.

 Subhas Chandra Bose is the founder of the Bloc.

 On Thursday, Ghosh said: ?Jyoti Basu made the promise when we were observing the birth centenary of Subhas Chandra Bose. I am sorry to say that our government is totally ignoring the issue.? 

 He said that he would take up the matter with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on January 23, when the chief minister will address a rally to mark Netaji?s 108th birth anniversary. 

 Bhattacharjee has agreed to be the chief guest at the programme.

 ?We will take the opportunity to ask the chief minister why nothing has been done to fulfil the promise,? Ghosh added.

 ?It?s a shame that nothing has been done in Bengal, while several other states have taken up a number of projects to preserve Netaji?s legacy,? Bloc parliamentarian Subrata Bose lamented.

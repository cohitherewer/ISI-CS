 Holes in the wall greeted the authorities? attempt to restrict entry into Botanical Gardens, Shibpur, by introducing an entry fee of Rs 5 from Monday.

 Even as Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee was buying a ticket ? he was the first to do so ? hordes of outsiders walked in through the gaps. 

 Sources said the wall had been broken at two points ? opposite the Bengal Engineering and Science University gate and near the Coolie Line, on Andul Road, where the quarters of the gardeners and class IV employees are located.

 While the gate was being manned to let in only the ticket-holders and keep at bay ?unscrupulous elements?, the holes in the wall made a mockery of the exercise.

 The Central Public Works Department has just repaired the wall, after the authorities announced introduction of entry tickets. 

 The authorities have come to know of the gaps and have decided to bridge them as soon as possible. ?We are keeping a close vigil on the two spots, through which unauthorised persons are trying to sneak in. We will stop this at any cost and, if necessary, we will seek police help,? said a senior garden official.

 G.S. Giri, joint director of the Botanical Survey of India and in-charge of the garden, said: ?We want to protect the garden and its rich variety of plants and trees. We also want to stop entry of unwanted elements. The entry fee has been introduced to help us achieve our goal.?

 Even as the first lot of tickets was being sold, several Group IV employees demonstrated against the authorities for not meeting their demands.

 The authorities also have another problem to grapple with: they are finding it incresingly difficult to issue the number for application forms as demanded by morning and evening walkers for entry permits. The authorities have decided to collect an annual fee of Rs 100 from each morning or evening walker. 

 On Friday, around 2,000 application forms were sold to the walkers. Each form costs Re 1. But the demand was much more than what the authorities had anticipated.

 ?We had no idea that such a huge number of people use the garden for their morning or evening stroll. All the forms have been exhausted and we have ordered for more,? said a senior official of the Botanical Survey of India.

 A few walkers, however, put up a demonstration demanding free entry.

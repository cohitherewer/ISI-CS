 Blame it on the brand

 Angry with your credit card? Take it out on the bank. Unless, of course, it starts communicating with you 

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This happened recently. A friend was preparing for the marriage of his son. An expensive piece of jewellery was bought from a premium outlet. The deal was concluded and our man presented his gold credit card to the salesperson. A while later, the man came back and asked for another card as this one was not registering. A second card, another gold card, was offered. The problem remained. A person, ostensibly from the bank, wished to speak to the cardholder on the phone. Questions about his mother?s maiden name etc, were asked and answered. 

 The approval of the transaction still did not come. The cardholder was baffled and angry. His purchase was a fraction of his credit limit. Normally, there should be no problem at all. He wrote out a cheque. That he would have to prematurely withdraw a term deposit to honour the cheque was the least of his concerns. All he wanted to do was close all his business with the bank that had issued the credit card. He did that by lunch the next day.

 Little did he realise that the bank he penalised had little to do with the problems he had. Credit cards have now become as much a part of the life of a consumer as mobile phones. Their fraudulent use has also increased concurrently. The actual credit card companies, Visa/Masters/Diners et al, guarantee the money involved in the transaction to the merchant and protect the cardholder from inappropriate use by someone else. Naturally, they have elaborate security systems in place.

 Most of the safety net relies on spotting transactions that are unusual ? either in terms of money or city or even in terms of outlet. So if you normally reside in Calcutta and buy things that seldom cost a five figure amount then not only would a jewellery purchase be scrutinised and maybe even held back, a smaller transaction in a city that you seldom visit could also come under the scanner.

 The intricacy of the security system is perfectly understandable. So is the anger of the friend who felt insulted and embarrassed by the delay in approval of his jewellery purchase. The amazing thing is the lack of communication. If only the cardholder knew the real reason for the questions that were being asked he would have happily forewarned the bank about his intending purchase. No alarms would have been raised. No embarrassment would have been caused. Don?t we all subject ourselves to uncomfortable body searches and inconvenient bag searches at the airports? 

 Even more surprising is the role of the bank. The credit-card company or its appointed agents are really the major auditors of the transactions. The bank has a less significant role to play in this. So even if they wanted, the bank could not intervene and lessen the procedural hassles for their privileged customers. All the more reason they should take on the onus of educating the cardholders. For, the consumers do not even realise whether they are holding a Visa or a Master or a Diners card. They are convinced they carry a Standard Chartered or a Bank of Baroda or a Citibank card. The branding is unambiguous. So is the apportionment of blame in their minds about card-related problems.

 It does sound strange. A consumer of a bank thinks that he is using a facility of his banker. The banker has little control of the operational end and he is exposing his brand equity to grave risk. Yet, the brand owner does very little to protect his brand. All it would take is talking to the consumer.

 If Alpine climes are beyond reach, chill out at the Swiss cottage-style food stop bearing the no-nonsense name of The International Caf?. 

 Housed on the fourth floor of Enclave in Alipore that also boasts of Red Kitchen and Lounge, the eatery has been designed with an effort to replicate the ambience of an European caf?. 

 The d?cor is cosy and inviting with a sloping ceiling lined with thick wooden beams and red brick walls. The lived-in look is heightened with uneven windowpanes, some even sporting a crack or two! 

 The food is strictly Continental but the desi touch is provided with karaoke evenings on Fridays, accompanied by Sanjeev Sinha and his band belting out Bollywood oldies.

 This is the only caf? in the city to host karaoke evenings, claims Mohit Tikmany of the caf?.

 The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner through the week except Mondays.

 Sweat style

 Olympians and Formula One champs have honed their bodies on this equipment. Even if you dont have to follow their rigour, Technogym equipment might inspire you to match some of their style.

 The state-of-the-art equipment is housed in Geo Fitness Studio, tucked in between the INOX ticket counter and Oh! Calcutta in Forum. The 5,400-sq-ft gym celebrated its first birthday last week and is here to stay.

 Unlike many other fitness chains, we were not apprehensive about the response and thus we chose the premium location of the city, says Pankaj Arora, country head, Geo Spa and Fitness. 

 The secret behind the success of the fitness chain that has outlets in Bangalore and Chennai in India, is a multi-pronged approach as opposed to only weight reduction and muscle building, stresses the country head. 

 We provide overall fitness solutions to our clients, which includes healthy eating and proper exercising. We have a battery of well-trained staff who help provide a solution to all health and fitness related queries of the clients, says Arora.

 More advanced Technogym equipment is in the offing at the hi-tech healthclub.

 Table touch

 Kitchen creativity is not limited to culinary skills alone. Much more goes into becoming the perfect host or hostess.

 An annual table laying contest was held at Grain of Salt recently, organised by the Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta, in which some innovative ideas were laid out.

 Romance oozed from one table, clearly laid out for an intimate dinner, another was arranged in anticipation of peace talks between Manmohan Singh and Parvez Musharraf! The Halloween table, however, bagged the first prize. So what if the spooks could make you lose your appetite!

 The 13 tables were presided over by judges Bharat Dhamala and Manas Borthakur of Red Hot Chilli Pepper and theatre personality Dolly Basu. The entries were very impressive but we judged based on the practical aspect of the exercise, said Manas. The quality of cutlery and table linen was also taken into consideration. 

 More bites

 As the citys growing appetite for more restaurants results in a new eatery opening up almost every week, the old ones are taking the expansion route to keep up with demand.

 Around the Corner, the cosy little coffee and confectionery shop at the corner of Theatre Road and Short Street, has undergone an image makeover, moving from coffees and bakes to a place that might be the perfect destination for a formal dinner. 

 Opening up a segment of the two-year-old restaurant that previously served as the bakery, the place has graduated from a 20-cover casual stopover to a 52-cover sit-down restaurant for serious foodies. 

 The exhaustive menu now boasts Continental and Chinese dishes. Priced at Rs 75 for starters and Rs 80 for a main-course dish, a meal for two could set one back by Rs 300. 

 The d?cor is simple for lunch when office-goers drop by, but in the evening a more classy look takes over with cream and chocolate coloured table covers and subdued lighting.

 Schools push better family sense

 - Parental involvement encouraged for overall development of the child 

 RICHA BANSAL

 DJ Sanjay Dutta was thrilled after he held a class for high-school students on music and what it takes to become a disc jockey last week at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Dutta?s son studies in Class II in the same school.

 ?This is the first time I got a peek into the school,? says an excited Dutta. ?My confidence level in the school has really gone up and I can also give suggestions now, as our feedback is always welcome,? he adds.

 Breaking away from the age-old ?us and them? barrier, a few city schools are actively encouraging parental involvement to ensure better growth of the child. They assert that learning becomes more effective when schools and parents cooperate to understand the goals and abilities of children better, and feedback is used constructively. 

 Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Loreto House, St Xavier?s School, Birla High School (for Girls) and Mahadevi Birla Girls? High School are some institutions practising this approach. Be it holding guest lectures, or organising health programmes if they are doctors, to coaching children in sports, meditation and yoga, and being active participants in school concerts, parents are as much a part of their child?s growth as the school. 

 Anjali Razdan, principal, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, says: ?Sanjay is just one of the many parents who get transformed once they are allowed to be partners in the progress of their child.? 

 The system is all the more necessary today, say psychiatrists, as children are no longer treated as a mass. Explains Dr Aniruddha Deb: ?As opposed to the earlier concept of a child being an empty vessel that had to be moulded according to a set form of ideas developed by adults, the concept today is that adults must be partners in bringing up children. And that each child is an individual. Without interaction between schools and parents, children suffer. 

 Deb adds: ?As parents are totally out of touch with the school, the child is taught very differently at home and school. This makes him confused and in most cases, he turns out to be very mediocre academically.?

 Schools and parents talk only when there is a ?problem? with the child. And then, either the school blames the parents and leaves them to address the problem or they together decide what is ?good? for the child without addressing his needs. ?A parent is not a trained person and cannot be expected to rectify the problem on his own,? elaborates Deb.

 Parental involvement in schools increases mutual accountability and puts an end to the blame game. Educationist Leslie D?Gama comments: ?It helps develop a family sense, which is slowly becoming an important factor, now that working parents have little time for the child.?

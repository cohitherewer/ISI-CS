 Books of and by women

 From Tuesday to Friday, the usual cacophony at Nandan was drowned by some energetic female voices, reading poetry or discussing literary works. The occasion was the ?first-of-its-kind women?s book fair in India?, called Soi Mela Boi Mela, on the Rabindra Sadan grounds, May 3 to 6.

 Though books were the reason behind the four-day gathering, the occasion lay more stress on providing a platform for aspiring women writers. ?We wanted to showcase books written by women, books published by women, books and journals edited by women, and books written on women. The idea was to bring women?s creativity in the focus,? said writer Nabaneeta Dev Sen, founder president of Soi.

 The five-year-old organisation of women writers of West Bengal hosted the fair in association with Paschim Banga Bangla Akademi and Publishers and Booksellers Guild. 

 With a row of seven to eight stalls put up by National Book Trust, Publishers and Booksellers Guild, Sahitya Akademi, The Little Magazine, Thema and others, the fair displayed women?s writings in India, from popular fiction to novels, short stories, articles, autobiographies and memoirs. Writings in English didn?t make their presence felt, but the stalls made up with a rich collection of Bengali works.

 The seeds of an all-women?s book fair were sown at the Calcutta Book Fair early this year when the association released the first issue of its newsletter Soi Sabood. It was decided that Soi would celebrate Pratibha Basu?s 90th birthday and Mahasveta Devi?s 80th birthday with the innovative event.

 After governor Gopal Gandhi lit the inaugural lamp on Tuesday evening, the fair took off with an all-male poetry-reading session. Among those who took the stage were writers Sunil Gangopadhyay, Dibyendu Palit, Tarapada Ray and others. Dancer Amala Shankar and Jnanpith award-winning Assamese writer Indira Goswami Raisom launched the second issue of Soi Sabood.

 The second day saw a poetry-reading session by women writers and theatre veterans at Victoria Memorial. 

 On the fair grounds, an open forum was simultaneously organised for aspiring women writers, who braved the rains to submit their unpublished short stories.

 The heavy showers played spoilsport on Day Three, disrupting a story reading session and damaging the makeshift stage. But several women, including the speakers for a discussion on theatre that was slated later in the evening, turned up nonetheless.

 A panel discussion with women publishers on the concluding evening was followed by a reading from some works of the Seventies. The best short story and best poem from the submitted works were also announced after careful screening by Soi members.

 ?Soi means signature. It also means a girl friend and patience,? explains Dev Sen. Though it all began with a handful of seven to eight members, the Soi club has swelled to 25 over the past five years. ?We wanted a space of our own, where we could sit and chat about our problems, share our thoughts, or just relax. But we don?t want more members as it will then become difficult for an intimate adda,? says Dev Sen even as she?s flooded with requests for membership from fledgling writers at the fair.

 The Soi fraternity meets twice a month for an adda, to read and discuss their works. Apart from Dev Sen, Soi includes writers Mahasveta Devi, Bani Basu, Suchitra Bhattacharya and Jaya Mitra, with Pratibha Basu being the eldest team member.

 Song on his lips

 If someone rocks these days, it has to be Kunal Ganjawala. From Bheegey honth to Kaal dhamaal, it has been all crests and no troughs for the crooner whose greatest claim to fame till some time back was the Doodh doodh advertisement jingle. 

 In Calcutta last week for his first performance in the city at the Sananda Tilottama beauty pageant, Kunal, who trained under Pandit Sudhindra Bhowmik, was all praise for the ?culturally rich audience?.

 ?It is undoubtedly the singing capital of the country and I am so happy to have sung here for the first time,? said Kunal. ?Initially, I was supposed to perform with my dance troupe but then I came to know at the very last moment that I had to do it all alone. The dancers are not just there, they become characters in my songs and my act is incomplete without them. But the people waiting to hear me ? Shobhaa De, Usha Uthup, Aparna Sen ? were so big that I had to give my best.?

 The singer, who just can?t do anything wrong these days, was particularly high on the Kaal title track. ?It was the first time I sung for Shah Rukh Khan and I enjoyed every moment of it,? said Kunal. 

 ?The other hit song in the film Tauba tauba is also doing well. There?s a lot ahead, too. More than 30-40 films having my songs are due for release. Among them I am looking forward to a Himesh Reshammiya song in an untitled Salman Khan film, the title song of Yash Raj?s Saif Ali Khan-starrer Salaam Namaste, and a couple of songs from Khalid Mohamed?s Silsiilay.?

 Apart from being popular with the audiences, Kunal is a darling of the music industry. ?I have had a lovely time working with music directors like Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, A.R. Rahman, Sandesh Shandilya and Ram Sampat, but I vibe the best with Anu Malik, having worked together for a long time, since the time I sang ad jingles. I love singing duets with Sunidhi Chauhan, Shreya Ghoshal, Mahalaxmi Iyer, Alka Yagnik and, of course, my wife Gayatri Iyer. Among other singers, I really look up to the likes of Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam and Sukhvinder Singh for inspiration. I always incorporate new ideas into my musicality. After all, music kisi ki jageer nahin hai??

 If Kunal is very upbeat about wife Gayatri making it big in the West End as the leading star of Far Pavilions, he himself isn?t too keen to go west. ?With Bollywood opening up in such a big way to Hollywood, perhaps, I can make a mark there by just singing Hindi playback.?

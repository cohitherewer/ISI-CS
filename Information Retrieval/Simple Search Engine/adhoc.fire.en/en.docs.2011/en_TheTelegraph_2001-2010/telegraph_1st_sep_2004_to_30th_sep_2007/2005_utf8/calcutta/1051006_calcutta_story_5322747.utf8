 Mosquito net blitz to ward off vectors

 Lesson from the dengue outbreak: back to basics. 

 The civic authorities are encouraging people to use mosquito nets at night to avoid getting afflicted with vector-borne diseases, like malaria and dengue. And to spread awareness on the issue, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will distribute mosquito nets among 1,000 poor people in each of the 15 boroughs. 

 The civic health department thinks the ?token gesture? will go a long way in popularising mosquito nets.

 ?Malaria, dengue or any other mosquito-borne disease spreads quickly, especially in the city proper, as people tend to sleep without the nets,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. 

 ?Calcuttans have a general dislike for using mosquito nets during summer, as they block the flow of air in the room,? pointed out chief municipal health officer Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay. 

 ?But the nets are a must in early autumn, when the malaria curve takes an upswing. Besides, around this time, the nets are quite comfortable, as the night temperature takes an abrupt dip,? he said.

 While going on a drive against malaria, the mayor asserted that the city was ?no longer under dengue?. 

 Serological tests on 2,787 blood slides on Wednesday yielded only 34 positive results, around 1.21 per cent.

 As a spin-off of the CMC?s dengue-control programme, the incidence of malaria, as percentage of the blood samples tested, has been almost half this year, compared with last year. In 2004, of the 30,000-odd blood samples tested till September, 30 per cent were found infected with malaria parasites (10 per cent were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, that causes malignant malaria). 

 This year, of the 90,000-odd samples tested, only 14.8 per cent were found to be infected. Two per cent of the infected samples had Plasmodium falciparum.

 In absolute terms, however, the scenario is just the opposite. More than 13,000 people are suffering from malaria in the city now, against 9,000 in 2004.

 ?We are not complacent and the health department has been asked to run all 63 malaria clinics, 23 civic dispensaries and health units attached to the civic headquarters and in all 15 boroughs during the Puja,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Days after the city went panicky counting dengue deaths, there was a word of reassurance from two experts of tropical diseases. 

 At an awareness programme for the councillors on Tuesday, Manish Chakraborty and Amiya Kumar Hati stressed that dengue was not a killer disease and that Calcuttans would have to live with it. ?Destruction of larvae is the only effective solution to keep the disease at bay,? they pointed out. The duo also spoke about ill-effects of fogging.

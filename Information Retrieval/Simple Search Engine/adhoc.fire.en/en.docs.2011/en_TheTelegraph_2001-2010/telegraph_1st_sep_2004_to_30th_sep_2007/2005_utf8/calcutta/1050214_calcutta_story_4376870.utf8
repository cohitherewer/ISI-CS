The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Love stories less ordinary

A bond far beyond the four-letter word. This Valentines 

Day, Metro celebrates the spirit of that special togetherness as scripted 

on celluloid over the decades

(Top) Moments from American Beauty, 

Nayak, Phir Milenge, The Silence of the Lambs and Roman 

Holiday; (above) moments from Limelight and Black 

Amitabh Bachchan amp; Rani Mukherjee in Black: The kiss. The one single 

physical expression of love, in its purest and most passionate form. And to think 

Michelle McNally is allowed only one kiss all her life makes it the ultimate moment 

of romantic reckoning.

She yearns for it ? from the man who taught her how 

to see, hear and speak just by the sense of touch. And she deserves his touch. 

She confesses (on the voiceover) of having felt about him differently for some 

time. ?You have been the only man in my life,? she says, having felt her sister 

kiss her husband on the wedding day. As for her ?teacher?, she has not only been 

the only woman in his life, but his very source of sustenance. He cannot do it, 

yet cannot turn her request down. The compromise is no cinematic liberty but the 

only possible culmination of two souls so intrinsically dependent on each other.

The Sanjay Leela Bhansali film is not about Michelle 

and her teacher?s black worlds turned white by each other. It is about the grey 

shades of their relationship, which, like most legendary liaisons, is beyond a 

label.

Amitabh bachchan amp; Raakhee in Bemisaal : Sakhi. The one word 

that redefined the boundaries of a man-woman relationship. It meant a woman friend, 

a confidante, a receptacle of confessions. It was uttered with a gentle firmness 

that characterised The Baritone at its best. In the addressal, natural yet special, 

Raakhee found a man she could depend on more than her husband gone astray, be 

jealous of this man?s supposed dalliances and yet not feel an ounce of guilt. 

The ultimate sacrifice that Amitabh makes for his sakhi ? spending his life behind 

bars to save her husband and her home ? elevates this unique relationship to one 

beyond the predictable parameters of romance.

Uttam Kumar amp; Sharmila Tagore in Nayak: Hero meets budding journalist 

on a train journey and reluctantly agrees to be interviewed by her. Satyajit Ray 

starts with this common germ of truth to script a classic about a soul, adrift 

and alone, momentarily drawn to an unlikely anchor. Moments like Sharmila taking 

off her dark-framed and forbidding glasses, seeing through an idol with clay feet 

and yet rushing to him in the dead of the night, tearing up the interview sheet? 

leave us, every time, with the feeling, what if?

Kevin Spacey amp; Mena Suvari in American Beauty: He wants attention. 

She wants a man. He fantasises about her. She seduces him. Both wake up. An anti-thesis 

to the film?s posters, the relationship between Lester Burnham (Spacey) and Angela 

Hayes (Suvari) is all thorns on the surface but as soft as the rose petals inside. 

?The gigantic loser? attains nirvana on the wings of just one question from his 

dream cheerleader: ?How are you?? ?God, it?s been a long time since anybody asked 

me that,? says Lester.

It is Lester?s loneliness and the crush on his daughter?s 

best friend, and the vulnerability of Angela, an epitome of American beauty, that 

make the Sam Mendes film. It is through Lester and Angela that the repressed needs 

of the despairing individual find an answer beyond the satiation of physical pangs.

Jodie Foster amp; Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs: It 

was a deal she couldn?t refuse. He would tell her the unknown secrets of the killer 

on the loose and she would divulge unknown secrets of her personal life. Hannibal 

Lecter and Clarice Sterling were separated by bars but their mindscapes merged 

and raised the cinematic bond by a few bars. The tension between the two could 

be cut with a knife, and the strange intimacy was electric. As Lecter and Sterling 

wormed their way into each other?s psyche, the mind games lead to a bizarre attachment 

born of self-discovery. While the twisted but gifted doctor went on to eat more 

livers with fava beans, the FBI agent could finally silence the cry of the lambs 

to the slaughter in her subconscious.

Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday: The enduring image 

of the brief, but beautiful, encounter of the princess and the journalist would 

be The Walk. In the end, Gregory Peck walks away slowly ? the steps echoing through 

a deserted palatial setting ? turning his back on the unattainable love of his 

life. The princess returns to her world after learning about life and love during 

a few hours of a magical holiday. Was there anyone who did not wish for a fairytale 

ending?

Charlie Chaplin amp; Claire Bloom in Limelight: The Tramp as an ageing 

and melancholy music hall comic who stops a young ballet dancer from suicide and 

then guides her to triumph on stage. The coming together of two despairing souls 

? each drawing sustenance from the other ? is Chaplin at his poignant best. The 

ambiguous ? and doomed ? relationship between one performer at the end of his 

time and at the other just waiting to bloom traverses laughter and tears, love 

and longing, life and death.

Abhishek Bachchan amp; Shilpa Shetty in Phir Milenge: Two fighters 

brought together by circumstances and set up to fight a common battle. One fighting 

death. The other fighting life. Revathy?s sensitive treatment of relationships 

has been the hallmark of her first two films, Mitr: My Friend and Phir 

Milenge. Here is a refreshing ? almost revolutionary ? man-woman relationship 

minus the proverbial ?pyaar? tag. While Shilpa plays the AIDS victim fired 

from work, Abhishek is the young struggling lawyer out to defend her. From the 

courtroom to the coffee shop, Revathy weaves a poignant tale of togetherness out 

of a working relationship.

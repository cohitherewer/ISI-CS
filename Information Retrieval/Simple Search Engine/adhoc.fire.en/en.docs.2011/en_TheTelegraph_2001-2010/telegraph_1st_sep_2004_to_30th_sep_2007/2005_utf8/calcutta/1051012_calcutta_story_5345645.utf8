 The artisans of Kumartuli have braved leaky roofs, waterlogged streets, dingy lanes and unhygienic living conditions for years. But things are likely to look up from next year, thanks to the state government?s makeover plans for it, which have started taking concrete shape now.

 By Durga puja 2006, work on rejuvenating Kumartuli will have started and proceeded to a certain extent, starting with infrastructure like roads, water supply, drainage and so on. 

 ?That is our endeavour, provided we find alternative land to shift some artisans temporarily while work is on in a portion,? a senior Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) officer said on Tuesday.

 The CMDA has completed the survey plan for a complete rejuvenation of Kumartuli. By November, the cost estimate will be finalised and by December, CMDA will be working on funds arrangement. 

 ?We hope that by the first quarter of 2006, actual work will start, and by Durga puja, a portion of the project will take shape. The entire project will take two to three years to complete,? the officer added.

 ?Right now, we are looking for land close to Kumartuli, which can act as a transit camp ? a semi-permanent structure where some artisans can be temporarily relocated while work in a portion of Kumartuli is on,? said P.R. Baviskar, CMDA chief executive officer. 

 All the artisans cannot be relocated at the transit camp at the same time, so they will be shifted in turns while work in a certain portion is completed. ?The entire process will begin only after discussing the project in details with the artisans and their representatives, as well as the local people?s representatives,? he added.

 The state government has prepared a blueprint for a complete makeover of Kumartuli, where 300-odd artisans earn their living.

 An estimated Rs 24 crore will be necessary for the project, of which 35 per cent will be borne by the Centre, 15 per cent by the state government, and the remaining 50 per cent has to be arranged through loans. The Centre has greenlighted a project report on the overall improvement of Kumartuli. 

 The CMDA will be the implementing authority of the project, for which the Centre will offer its assistance under the National Urban Renewal Mission.

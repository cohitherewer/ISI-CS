While some prefer three-quarters and shorts to combat the monsoon muck, a monsoon special sari collection has also been unveiled for those who stick to tradition.

 Mrignayani, the Madhya Pradesh state emporium at Dakshinapan, is celebrating Rain Fest 2005 from June 2 to 16. Offering a discount of 20 per cent on saris and bedspreads, the store also unveiled the designs of the season with a fashion show and a starry inauguration by actress Konineeca Banerjee.

 Traditional saris and jewellery were on show, including tussars in bright, festive prints in geometric as well as floral patterns. Kosa silk drapes on the other hand, were a display of sober and soothing shades. 

 The star attraction, however, were the chanderis, pitched as the preferred choice of the royal family of Gwalior. The chanderi palette was vibrant as well with colours like yellow, black, sea-green and red capturing the royal grandeur. The weave is fine, peppered with butis and other delicate motifs. The opulence is augmented by brocade borders and an abundance of gold detailing. 

 Said to have been conceived by Queen Ahilya Bai Holkar, the Maheshwari line in silks and cotton was billed to be apt for weddings and parties alike. The natural dyes and bag prints used in many of the saris have been inspired by Mughal miniatures.

 In comparison, accessories showcased were more simple, in keeping with the current trend. Strings of pearls helped bring out the timeless appeal of the ensembles, while a few gold ornaments added to the sheen. 

 This is the first time a state showroom has organised an event like this, said a spokesperson from Mrignayani. 

 To conclude, a lucky draw will be conducted by Susweta Pal Chaudhury, Sananda Tilottama 2005, on July16 at 5 pm at the south Calcutta showroom.

 Guest formula

 Despite the mushrooming of party spots in the city one still gets little choice in terms of variety of entertainment on offer.

 One of the popular routes taken by nightclubs to break the monotony of the same faces, music and drinks is to invite guest DJs and bartenders. Never mind that they end up offering the same chill-out beats and sips as the resident entertainers.

 Tantra hosted a Seagrams Fling night on Saturday, roping in guest DJ Ash Fry and bartender Dilnaz, both from Mumbai. 

 Ash Fry took over the console only to churn out safe numbers known to keep the weekend crowd happy like Nach baliye, Disco 82, Teri toh and Kajrare, apart from bhangra beats in songs like Dhol vajda and Soniye ni soniye. Dilnaz, on the other hand, did the balancing act at the bar, keeping glasses overflowing and the crowd enthralled with her prowess with fire juggling.

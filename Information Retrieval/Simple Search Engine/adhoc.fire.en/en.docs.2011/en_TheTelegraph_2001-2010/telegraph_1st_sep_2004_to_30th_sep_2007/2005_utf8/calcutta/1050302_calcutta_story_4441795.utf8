 Suicide bid over quit threat

 - Over-age inmates of child home protest ouster order

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A young inmate of Kishalay home in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, attempted suicide on Tuesday to protest an order issued by the authorities asking 24 inmates to vacate the home.

 In an order issued on February 18, the authorities of Kishalay, a home for destitute children, asked all inmates aged above 18 to vacate the premises within 10 days. 

 As a mark of protest, 24 inmates, all over 18, started a fast-unto-death at the home?s entrance on Tuesday morning. 

 Around 11.30 am, one of them, 27-year-old Mokhter Sheikh, stabbed himself in the belly with a sharp weapon. He was rushed to Barasat State General Hospital, where his condition is stated to be critical.

 ?The upper-age limit of the inmates is 18. So, all inmates over 18 have been asked to leave,? explained Manoj Pant, district magistrate, North 24-Parganas.

 Last June, the home authorities had asked 33 youths to leave. However, only eight left by January. Home superintendent A. Samajder on Sunday, served an ultimatum on the rest and threatened to call in the police to force them out.

 ?Along with four deaf-and-mute inmates, we staged a demonstration. We cannot live a normal life outside the home. So, it?s better to die here,? said Goutam Saha, who is preparing to take the B.Com Part I examination this year.

 ?We have provided them with a contingency fund of Rs 1,000 each. If they fail to leave we will have to forcibly send them away. Many are failing to get a place in the home because they are not leaving,? district magistrate Pant added.

 The appalling conditions at Kishalay came to light after Shyamal Sen, chairman of the state human rights commission, visited it about 15 days ago. Over the past year, 26 inmates, aged between eight and 14, have fled the home. 

 This prompted Sen to conduct a first-hand assessment of the situation in the home.

Crisp and white: manstyle mantra

 Kiran?s call 

Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh takes a look at the trends that promise to pep 

up male fashion in 2005

A model walks the ramp at a Prada show in 

a white suit, the colour that?s ruling men?s fashion now, and (above) a model 

sports a cellophane shirt from one of Kiran?s experimental collection 

Today?s man has it better than the Zoot suiters. He 

needn?t go for the cuffed at the ankle, 1940?s baggy-panted Zoot to stand out. 

There?s enough going on in men?s wear. And yet, it could have got better. 

If women dress for women, men dress to impress other 

men, says Joseph Abboud in his new book Threads: My Life Behind the Seams in 

the High-Stakes World of Fashion. ?Men use their wardrobes to send messages 

about who they are. Especially in the corporate world.? 

As a designer, I notice an apprehension about what 

doesn?t work for men. There is this uneasiness at the knuckles on the drawing 

board about going a little too overboard and turning too feminine, or if you step 

too far out about looking like a gigolo. 

So, does that mean men remain staid dressers? Not 

quite. Yes they do like to play it safe, but within parameters. A designer has 

to learn to be inspired. And there aren?t too many picking up the gauntlet. 

The other evening, I went to a dinner hosted by S.N. 

Jhunjhunwala, the nattiest 68-year-old this side of the wetlands. This jaunty 

gent has an innate sense of style, someone whose style perhaps has never been 

fully realised. Not just in the clothes he carries but in the flourish of his 

lifestyle. The man is no particular style icon and yet burnt orange polo necks, 

khaki corduroys, or even shades of red, this grandfather has proven that style 

is ageless. He is the only person I know who could carry off pink shorts on the 

golf course without looking foppish. Jhunjhunwala is a sure sign that there is 

a need for an inspired wardrobe for Indian men with style. Here?s the Indian version 

of Frank Norris who said: ?I never truckled, I never took off the hat to fashion 

and held it out for pennies. By God, I told them the truth.? And yet, it isn?t 

happening here. The result off the drawing board is either too busy or it?s occasion 

dressing. The men are waiting. 

Look around you, even the 13-year-old spends half 

an hour puffing out the front of his hair for that cute Tintin tuft that looks 

like he slept on his face. Today, he?s busy spiking it. And it isn?t because he 

agrees with Oscar Wilde that ?fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that 

we have to alter it every six months?, but because he, like most men I observe, 

loves looking good! 

Whether he wears his hair in gelled spikes or puffs, 

let?s not underestimate a man?s interest in fashion and in his appearance. Recent 

trends show that manicures, pedicures and facials aren?t the prerogative of vain 

men. Today regular men walk into salons as much as we women do. They know their 

fashion. They?re willing to spend on their wardrobe. 

However, men?s wear needs some out-of-the-box thinking, 

and more inspiration. Good design is priceless. 

2005 men?s wear trends promise fashion inspired by 

Africa, with tribal prints and faux animal-hair fringing. Plaid shorts, safari 

suit inspired shirts, leather zip-front jackets, fitted denim jackets almost a 

size too small. 

White reigns, despite Jitendra?s legacy. Crisp white 

shirts and interestingly played-off ties in lavender, narrow belts to hold up 

their cotton slacks, again preferably white. The mood, a little peppy at times 

with short-sleeved shirts and square cut, zip-front jackets, has serious off duty 

appeal. A creamy, summery palette of light-weight suits in grey, pale blue and 

khaki feels chic. 

Men also need plenty of colour. It?s not the time 

to be shy ? salmon shirts with yellow ties no longer denote colour over confidence 

and are now the prerogative of the seriously dapper gent. Was that a Hawaiian 

shirt I spotted, too? 

I believe a man is looking for the kind of designer 

who understands that he wants to look like himself ? only better. And yet there?s 

a rejection of the boring sameness found in designer-label goods. It?s crucial 

to the clear expression of our individuality, unless you want to look like a fashion 

victim, you need to bring something of yourself to what you wear. Or else you?re 

going to end up looking just like someone else. 

Men are searching. They?re out there, pince nez to 

their eyes, for some interesting stuff. And they?ve been searching at least since 

December 8, 1906, when Mark Twain wore a white flannel suit to the Capitol because, 

he told reporters, dark colours depressed him. At 71, he could afford to speak 

on the Copyright Bill and dress reforms with equal aplomb: ?I am decidedly for 

pleasing colour combinations in dress... a group of men in evening clothes looks 

like a flock of crows, and is just about as inspiring.? 

Since then, prints, colours, textures and weaves have 

entered the man?s war-drobe. If women are looking with consternation here, Twain 

would point out, ?Of course, I have ideas of dress reform.? He said: ?For one 

thing, why not adopt some of the women?s styles? Goodness knows, they adopt enough 

of ours!? 

Today?s man knows, just as he did, that ?clothes make 

the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society?.

 Revamped denim rage

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 After almost nine years at 57 Park Street, Levis has discovered a brand new look. The international casual wear labels second store in India has been revamped to keep the youngsters hooked. 

 The 1,000-sq-ft shop has had a happy run in town, ever since it opened in 1996.

 Everybody was under the impression that Calcuttans do not know much about denim. But when we opened the store, we were amazed by the queries people had, explains Atul Agarwal, owner of the standalone Levis store.

 In demand were the latest cuts and designs from a cosmopolitan crowd. The Park Street location also gave us a lot of visibility, feels Agarwal. Now, from new flooring to revolving racks, walls to what matter most (the merchandise), it has all changed.

 We see more and more youngsters coming in now to purchase clothes. So, to keep in sync with the vibrant and lively clientele, we decided to add more colour and variety, explains the owner.

 While the mall onslaught has affected sales, the high street store has the advantage of being the best stocked, he stresses.

 This season, women are sticking to the Low Rise Hip Hugger Flair and Slim Jeans made popular by the lean and mean Bipasha Basu, promising the slim look in 7.8 seconds.

 The boys, on the other hand, are grabbing just about anything that comes their way. The prices range from Rs 1,199 to Rs 3,500.

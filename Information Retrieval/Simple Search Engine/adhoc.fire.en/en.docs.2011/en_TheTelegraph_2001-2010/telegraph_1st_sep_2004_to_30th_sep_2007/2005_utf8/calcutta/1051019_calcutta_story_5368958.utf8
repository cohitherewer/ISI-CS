 Insider hint in heist

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Gold ornaments and Rs 45,000 were stolen from a businessman?s apartment on APC Road, near Bangiya Sahitya Parishat, on Monday. The businessman, Ramchandra Jaiswal, was at Howrah station to receive his wife, who was coming from Mumbai.

 On a complaint with Burtola thana, police and forensic experts visited the apartment late on Monday. An investigating officer said an insider could be involved in the theft. ?We have received a complaint and are probing the case,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police (north).

 Jaiswal left for Howrah station around 10 am to receive his wife, who was scheduled to arrive on the Gitanjali Express in the afternoon. But the train was late and the couple returned home around 6 pm.

 To their horror, they found the padlock of their main door broken. The doors of their two bedrooms, too, were ajar. On further inspection, they found the safe-lock broken and gold ornaments, including two sets of earrings and necklaces, and Rs 45,000 in cash missing.

 ?We have come across evidence of the involvement of a gang in the heist, though we have not identified it. An insider, too, could have been involved,? said an officer of Burtola police station. 

 ?The criminals were informed that Jaiswal would not be at home on Monday morning. They did not take any heavy articles, like the TV set or microwave oven, to avoid the suspicion of neighbours.?

 The criminals knew where the money and the jewellery were kept. ?The information might have been passed on to them by an insider,? the officer added.

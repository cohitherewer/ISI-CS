 Womens night out or a rain dance rave, a backless bash or a hookah dragging session, Bollywood tracks act as a perfect catalyst at any party. A small dance floor is manageable, a bad DJ is pardonable but going without the regular dose of Woh lamhe and Bin tere sanam is just not done.

 Amidst all this Mumbai mastery, there are some English tracks which strike a perfect chord with the party people even if they do not understand a single sentence.

 The city DJs give Goodlife

 floor ablaze these nights?

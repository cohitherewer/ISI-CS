The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City condos get bigger showcase

 - Developer dozen set to hawk high-end stocks at Madison Square Gardens convention of NRI Bengalis

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Long Beach Convention Center, California, 2003. Baltimore Convention Center, Maryland, 2004. Madison Square Gardens, New York City, 2005. Calcutta realty?s distant display dock in the US is getting bigger by the year.

 The North American Bengali Conference (NABC), or Banga Sammelan, organised by the Cultural Association of Bengal, now doubles as a pet platform for the city?s lifestyle condominiums. NABC, a convention of American residents of Bengali origin, celebrates its silver jubilee edition this year at the Madison Square Gardens between July 1 and 3, with at least 12 developers from Calcutta setting up stalls to hawk high-end real estate stocks.

 ?For NRI Bengalis, Calcutta is a big market which no one can ignore any more. At the Sammelan, you can interact with at least 5,000 families who subsequently act as your brand ambassadors,? says Piyush Bhagat, who along with Raj Modi, were the sole city representatives at the Silicon Valley NABC in 1999, with Space Town apartments.

 Participation has swelled at the Sammelan, as Calcutta now has ?enough lifestyle products to exhibit, which can match the aspiration levels of NRIs?, feels Rahul Todi, managing director, Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd. Todi will showcase his group?s new venture, Greenwood Sonata, in Rajarhat.

 The audience, too, has grown over the years. ?New York having a dense non-resident Bengali milieu, we expect around 12,000 people to participate, and there?s huge interest over the modern housing formats in Calcutta,? says Siladitya Ganguly, overseas coordinator for NABC.

 Subesh Ray, who has been going to the Banga Sammelan for the past three years, feels ?it serves as a major interactive platform?. Besides spot conversion, a high percentage of inquiries also gets converted through follow-ups, adds Ray, representing Mani Group.

 The growing interest in Calcutta properties among US-based Bengalis also has a lot to do with changing perception of the city, feels M.J. Robertson, another repeat visitor, who will showcase the Vedic Village farmhouses at the convention?s ?carnival atmosphere? this summer.

 Post 9/11, there has been a steady trickle of Bengali professionals ?many of them doctors ? returning to their hometown, feel some developers, hoping to cash in. ?Also, a large number of Bengali NRIs want to spend their retired life in Calcutta. Many look at property here as a wise investment option,? observes Todi. While bungalow projects and townhouses as second homes are gaining currency among NRIs, premium residential estates in south Calcutta are also much sought after, says Pawan Agarwal of N.K. Realtors.

 The queens of our hearts

 Who rsquo;s the best Bengali actress on the Indian screen? Rani reigns, of course. The overwhelming SMS poll result marks Day II of our festive film special. Up next: film of the year...

 RAni Mukherjee 

 1 With a whopping 83.7 per cent votes, Bollywood?s Babli has proved that she is, indeed, the queen of Calcutta?s hearts. From a supporting role under Indrani Halder?s shadow in Tollywood potboiler Biyer Phool to the country?s heroine number one, Rani has sure come a long way. From swaying with Aamir to Aati kya khandala to jiving with Shah Rukh to Tauba tumhare yeh ishaare, aamader Rani has been there and done it all. Year 2005 has been extra special for Rani having touched the right chord with her convincing take on Hellen Keller in Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Black and then following it up with a complete contrast in Shaad Ali?s Bunty Aur Babli.

 UPDATE: Shooting for Ravi Chopra?s Babul with Salman and Karan Johar?s Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna with Shah Rukh and Abhishek.

 Konkana Sen sharma

 2 Mrs Iyer has snatched the second spot from the Bangali sex sirens in Bollywood, polling 6.9 per cent votes. And she sure does a fine balancing act. If Mr and Mrs Iyer fetched Konkona the National Awards pat, Page 3 brought her box-office points. And she has more magic up her sleeve ? watch out for the schizophrenic act in mother Aparna Sen?s soon-to-be-released 15, Park Avenue and the role as Prosenjit?s wife in Rituparno Ghosh?s Dosar.

 UPDATE: Shooting for Naseeruddin Shah?s directorial debut Yun Hota To Kya Hota.

 Sushmita sen

 3 Sush (who Bips refers to as ?Bengal?s tigress?), has managed to bag the third spot with 4.9 per cent votes. This year has been mixed for the Main Hoon Na ma?m with Main Aisa Hi Hoon sinking without a trace but Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya a box-office winner.

 UPDATE: Shooting for Karma, Confessions and Holi opposite Randeep Hooda and slated to do The Great Emperor with Richard Gere.

 Bipasha basu 

 4 Bollywood?s hottest seductress has garnered just 1.7 per cent of the votes. Having redefined celluloid sensuality with Jism, the girl from Mandeville Gardens is back in form with her latest sizzler act in Boney Kapoor?s No Entry.

 UPDATE: Ready for release are Prakash Jha?s Apaharan and Neeraj Vora?s Phir Hera Pheri. To shoot for Dhoom 2, and films with John Mathan and Raj Kanwar.

 Rituparna Sengupta 

 5 Just when the queen bee of Tollywood found her crown slipping, she?s booked a berth in Bollywood with Main Meri Patni Aur Woh. So, the fifth place belongs to Rituparna with just about 1 per cent of the SMS votes. And though Bengali potboilers have been her forte, she?s also enacted sensitive roles for Rituparno Ghosh and Aparna Sen.

 UPDATE: Shooting for Hindi film Uns, co-starring Sudhangshu Pandey, Sanjay Kapoor and Juhi Babbar.

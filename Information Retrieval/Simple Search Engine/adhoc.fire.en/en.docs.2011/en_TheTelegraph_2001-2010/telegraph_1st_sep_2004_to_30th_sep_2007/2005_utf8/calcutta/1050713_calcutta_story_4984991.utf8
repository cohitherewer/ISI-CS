 Filmi Funda 

 The Godfather (1972)

 Director Francis Ford Coppola

 Cast Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan

 Plot Adapted from the Mario Puzo classic, the film explores the Italian mafia moves in America through the Corleone family.

 To make Don Corleone look 

 like a ?bulldog?, Brando wore a special appliance made by 

 a dentist inside his mouth. It is still on display in the 

 American Museum of the Moving Image in New York.

 Warren Beatty, Burt Reynolds, 

 Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Ryan O?Neal, Martin Sheen 

 and Robert Redford were considered before Pacino was picked 

 for Michael.

 Author Puzo and director 

 Coppola never used the word ?mafia? in the screenplay.

 The name of the traditional 

 Sicilian hat worn by some of the extras in the film is ?coppola?.

 The famous score by Nino 

 Rota is a re-working of his music in Fortunella. 

 So he couldn?t get an Oscar nod.

 Sarkar (2005)

 Director Ram Gopal Varma

 Cast Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Kay Kay

 Plot A tribute to The Godfather, Varma places his plot bang in the middle of the Indian political set-up.

 The Godfather has 

 already been tried on the Indian screen in Feroze Khan?s 

 Dharmatma.

 In Agneepath, Amitabh 

 had tried the husky Brando voice of Godfather.

 Varma was supposed to work 

 with Amitabh for the first time in a film called Ek, 

 which got shelved.

 Unlike Coppola, Varma has 

 no plans to make a sequel or a prequel to Sarkar.

 Varma has watched The 

 Godfather only four times but read the Puzo book quite 

 a few times.

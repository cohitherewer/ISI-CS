 Vignettes of women

 Sohini Sengupta Halder and Pijush Gangopadhyay in Babli

 If you think a certain TV ad or Hindi movie pioneered the current craze for Bubbly/Babli, think again. A young Bengali dramatist beat them to it. (Not that Pepsi or Shaad Ali hears what Bengal thinks today.)

 A good deal of thought goes into Bratya Basu?s plays, and his new one is no exception, even though he has not staged it himself but given it to another group, Drishyapat. Titled Babli, after the lead role, it features a student of business management who leads a regular life ? more or less happy family, steady boyfriend ? that is disrupted by a stranger?s arrival. This stranger is brought into the home by a relative, who wants him to have a temporary safe haven from the authorities because both of them work for a radical political unit. Babli falls for the quiet conviction of this man.

 Nothing ?happens?, except that she becomes aware of a whole new approach to life. The security and complacency of her existence and future plans, the attitudes of her middle-class parents and materialistic fianc?, all come under scrutiny. She realises how hollow they are. Then, as suddenly as he appeared, the stranger leaves for his next assignment.

 Babli?s life returns to normal, but she has changed. Does she compromise, or does she break away? Not a particularly original plot, perhaps, and developed somewhat skimpily, yet Basu handles it more subtly than he normally does. Babli clearly symbolises non-committed youth, and Sohini Sengupta Halder gives her a convincing portrayal. The others in the cast (Pijush Gangopadhyay, Biplab Bandopadhyay, Shyamal Sarkar and Enakshi Sen) contribute individually to the impact, but Phalguni Chattopadhyay stands out, imparting a well-rounded characterisation to the father who wants to enjoy life as it comes and not get involved in sociopolitical matters. 

 When I first saw the production, all the men smoked like state buses indiscriminately, regardless of ideology, which sent off all the wrong smoke signals, but director Anirban Bhattacharya has clamped down on pollution emissions subsequently. 

 Women in torment also occupied the central focus in the quartet of Feminine Monologues in three languages, produced by Spandan this week. Anushua Mazumdar acts in The Last Flame, adapted in English but into a Bengali household by Indrashish Laharry from A.K. Ramanujan?s retelling of a Kannada folktale in which a wife died from not expressing her bottled-up anger about her husband. 

 She puts her singing and dancing talents to brief but good use in this vignette. There followed Sudipa Basu?s rather inchoate treatment in Bengali of a petty crook on the rehab track and the problems she faces in mainstreaming ? written and performed disjointedly, especially towards the end. 

 Then Renu Roy reprised her role in Nag Bodas?s The Divorce, translated into English and premiered several months ago, directed by Lee-Alison Sibley. But finally, Dolly Basu won the emotional honours for Jaamal Abroo?s Mang, depicting in Hindi the trauma of a Sindhi mother whose daughter is the victim of a brutal honour killing. 

 Despite the seriousness of the common theme, the brevity of the episodes does not allow the actresses full scope, something they must themselves feel about this kind of venture.

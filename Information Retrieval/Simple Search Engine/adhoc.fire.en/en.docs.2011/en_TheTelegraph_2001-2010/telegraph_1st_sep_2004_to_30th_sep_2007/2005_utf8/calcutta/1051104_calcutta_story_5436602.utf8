Small books, big booty

 Counting crores: Brajesh Dubey

Brajesh Dubey didn?t find any reason to call on the KBC number. Come on, there are crores of people calling up every day and one really didn?t stand any chance of making it to the biggest game show on television. But his wife insisted and good that he listened to her. Dubey became the pahela crorepati of the dwitiya edition of Kaun Banega Crorepati.

 Dubey?s racing through the 14 of the 15 questions will be on display this Saturday on STAR Plus but what won?t be shown is how the man from Madhya Pradesh had gone over the whole process time and time again sitting in his home in Gunah. ?Once I was selected to appear for the show, I got two months and I decided to try out Fastest Finger First at home to improve my timing,? Dubey told Metro.

 So by the time Dubey played Fastest Finger First at Film City with the nine other participants, he had already gone through a dummy routine 200 times. And didn?t he read GK books to brush up on his funda? ?Going by the level and pattern of questions asked on KBC, my wife and I figured out that it was more useful to read the chhota books than the big ones,? reveals Dubey. ?So I tried to run through the subjects I was weak in, and went through school books to improve myself in that topic.?

 The whole experience of bagging the one crore jackpot wasn?t that mechanical, though. ?Ummeed se sach much dugna mil gaya,? Dubey smiles. ?Not only my family, every person who?s ever known me is very happy with my winning the money.?

 So what next for the insurance surveyor? ?I will continue with my job and look to use the money I have won for some business opportunity or invest it somewhere,? Dubey says. 

 He does need to plan again ? this time, how to use the money.

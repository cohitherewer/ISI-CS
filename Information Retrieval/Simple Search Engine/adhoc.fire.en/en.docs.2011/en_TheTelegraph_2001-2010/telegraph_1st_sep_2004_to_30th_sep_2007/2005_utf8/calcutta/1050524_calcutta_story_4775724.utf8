 The colour of dreams

 Woven with the stuff that dreams are made of, the paintings of Subrata Chowdhury are born purely of his own imagination. Conjuring up fantastic creatures from the realm of myths, fairy tales and legends, he picturizes a state of being in which humans and animals easily cohabit and communicate. The Surreal, the ongoing exhibition of his works, finds the artist using his poetic imagination to create dream-like creatures that come to life only in our sub-conscious minds. Done in acrylic on canvas, the artist visualizes haunting images of birds, fishes, butterflies and deer; the upper half of their bodies resembling feminine human forms. Using soft green, blue, indigo and, occasionally, red, he paints his private dreamscape as an expression of his inner self. In quoting from myths depicted on the walls of temples and pyramids, Chowdhury creates a lyrical mood, which is emphasized by a skilful orchestration of velvety shades. A dream-like atmosphere is also effectively created by blending softer tones with darker hues, blurring the edges of reality and making it merge with fantasy.

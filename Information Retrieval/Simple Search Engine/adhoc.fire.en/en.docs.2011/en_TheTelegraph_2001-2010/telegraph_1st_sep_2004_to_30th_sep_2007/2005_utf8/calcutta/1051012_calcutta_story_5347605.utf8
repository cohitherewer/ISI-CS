The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Movies of the year

What was the best Hindi film of 2005? The answer is 

all Black. And the man of the moment? Amitabh Bachchan, of course. The man who 

turned 63 on Tuesday, stars in three of the Top 5. This brings the curtains down 

on our festival film special. Thank you for all those SMS votes... Shubho Bijoya!

BLACK 

Topping the list with a whopping 54.9 per cent vote 

count, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film is truly Calcutta?s favourite film of the 

year. After colourful musicals like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas, 

the songless Black was Bhansali?s interpretation of the struggling life 

of Helen Keller. Embellished with brilliant performances from Rani Mukherjee and 

Amitabh Bachchan, and great cameos from Shernaz Patel, Dhritiman Chatterjee and 

nine-year-old Ayesha Kapur, Black also rode high on Ravi Chandran?s cinematography 

and production designer Omung Kumar?s opulent set pieces.

Parineeta 

Pradeep Sarkar?s celluloid adaptation of the Sarat 

Chandra Chattopadhyay classic is way behind at second spot with 10.2 per cent 

votes. That almost the entire film was shot in Calcutta must have helped the Vidhu 

Vinod Chopra production nudge ahead of the rest of the Mumbai mob. Great music 

(Shantanu Moitra) and crisp lenswork (N. Nataraja Subramanian) enhanced flawless 

performances from Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan. Sanjay Dutt and Raima Sen also 

do more than their bit to shore up this smiles-and-tears saga. 

PAGE 3 

An insider?s look at the party culture of Mumbai, 

this Madhur Bhandarkar film comes close on the heels of Parineeta with 

9.3 per cent votes. With a fluid handheld camera, Bhandarkar delves deep into 

the multiple layers of upper-class machinations. Natural performances from lifestyle 

reporter Konkona Sen Sharma, Atul Kulkarni and Boman Irani make this colourful 

enterprise quite engaging. Melodious singles from Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle 

enrich the background score of Page 3.

BUNTY AUR BABLI 

The concept of an on-the-road con film may have been 

alien to the desi culture but all that changed when Abhishek and Rani hit 

the road in this rollercoaster Shaad Ali musical. With 5.4 per cent votes, B 

?n? B is at number four. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy?s chartbusting score and Aveek 

Mukhopadhyay?s colourful frames did help the movie race through the first 

few weeks, but Bunty Aur Babli?s place in Bollywood history is best booked 

by Kajra re, with Ash-Amitabh-Abhishek. 

SARKAR 

Ram Gopal Varma?s re-telling of The Godfather didn?t 

quite change Indian film history like the way Francis Ford Coppola?s original 

did, but it sure did make an impression. At number five, with 4.3 per cent votes, 

Sarkar stands tall for the simple reason that reel becomes real when the 

Big B hands over the baton to the Chhota B.

Almost there 

No Entry and Iqbal almost made it to 

the Top 5 and maybe an SMS here and a vote there could have scripted a totally 

different story. But kudos to both Anees Bazmee and Nagesh Kukunoor for making 

us laugh and aspire the way they did.

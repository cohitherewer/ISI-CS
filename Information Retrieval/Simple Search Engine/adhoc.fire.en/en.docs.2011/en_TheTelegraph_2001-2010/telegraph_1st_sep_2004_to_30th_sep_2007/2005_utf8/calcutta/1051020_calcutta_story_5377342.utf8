The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Screen On amp; Off

 The king: Elvis Presley?s Heartbreak 

Hotel is on the list

 From one Khan to another, it?s truly a mad ad world out there. To take the six Aamirs head on, Shah Rukh?s got a duplicate in his new commercial for Sona Chandi chyawanprash.

 As the new brand ambassador for Emami, King Khan appears in a double role in the ad film, which promises ?to break the myth of the sage synonymous with chyawanprash? and link it with the superstar.

 After Sourav Ganguly and Sunny Deol, Shah Rukh?s the third celebrity to hail the health food. And in true Sona Chandi tradition, he is seen in the traditional attire of Kalarippayat, the old Indian martial art form, in the commercial.

 ?The two Shah Rukhs are used in the commercial to represent mind and body, both of which are essential in today?s times and something that our product claims to benefit,? says Aditya V. Agarwal, one of the directors of Emami, who unveiled the first commercial of the Rs 10 crore-campaign in Calcutta on Wednesday.

 Reminiscent of the Hero Puch advertisement where two Shah Rukhs ? one good and the other evil ? were pitted against each other, the new 30-second ad from Sona Chandi has been shot by ace ad film-maker Prahlad Kakkar, which features the two SRKs in the body versus mind battle, with one wearing red and the other black.

 ?It?s more of a stop-gap ad since we got all of one day and decided to knock this one off,? Kakkar tells Metro. ?It?s basically brain versus brawn and Shah Rukh really looks different in this one with all those Chinese clothes. The two Shah Rukhs come out of each other and then finally merge into one.?

 So you have one Shah Rukh saying: ?Star banne ke liye body chahiye,? while the other Shah Rukh replies, ?Naa boss, dimaag chahiye.? 

 The repartee continues, with one SRK mouthing: ?Taliyaan action pe bajti hain,? to which the other SRK says: ?Emotion se insaan hansta hai, rota hai, kuch kuch hota hai.? The verbal volley reaches a crescendo with the tagline of the product: ?Surakshit tan, tez dimaag.?

 The king: Elvis Presley?s Heartbreak 

Hotel is on the list

 Blowin In the Wind: no. Rock Around the Clock: no. Heartbreak Hotel: yes. I Shot the Sheriff: yes. Any list of ?songs that changed the world? is bound to be controversial, as much for the entries as the omissions. Music lovers may well ask just how Shania Twain?s Any Man of Mine had a profound socio-political impact on the civilised world while John Lennon?s Imagine didn?t. Or how Dylan failed to find favour where The Ramones succeeded.

 But what such a list does manage to do, is to get a debate going.

 Songs That Changed the World, scheduled to air on Discovery Travel amp; Living this Sunday onwards, however, has no such plans. ?We are not claiming this is the list. It?s only a look at 12 songs, chosen by a panel of experts, which set trends in music, fashion, dance and broke conventions,? said Rajiv Bakshi, manager, corporate communications of Discovery Communications India.

 In half-hour episodes continuing till December, the series will tell the tales behind classics like The Beatles? I Want to Hold Your Hand, The Bee Gees? Stayin? Alive, Nirvana?s Smells Like Teen Spirit and even lesser-know ones like Walk This Way by Run DMC amp; Aerosmith.

 Glimpses from the series screened on Wednesday in Calcutta showed musicians, rock historians, fans and contemporaries talking about how these songs changed their lives, and the world at large.

 ?Bob (Marley) once said when he saw what was going on around him, he felt like picking up a gun. But he picked up the guitar instead,? recalled a relative of the reggae king. ?The church was scared when it saw youngsters flocking to Elvis Presley?s concerts,? offered a music historian. ?The Beatles have changed my life,? screamed a fan in black-and-white footage from the Sixties.

 The series is a departure of sorts for the lifestyle channel. ?We do plan to make more music-related programmes, but with elements of lifestyle in them,? said Bakshi.

 The channel would also be airing content produced in India, next year.

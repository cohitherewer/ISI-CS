The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wards added at hospitals

 - Boost to gastroenterological, neonatal healthcare

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government is gearing up to meet the twin challenges of neonatal deaths and a rise in the number of gastroenterology patients in Calcutta. In the offing are new departments and a revamp of facilities at state-run hospitals. 

 A super-speciality ward is being set up at SSKM Hospital to provide better care to newborns. It will boast the latest equipment, including intensive care units, temperature-controlled rooms and specialised monitoring systems. The ward will also act as a training centre for doctors of the eastern region. 

 The decision to start the ward follows the recent crib deaths at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. A number of teaching posts in paediatrics have been sanctioned and new buildings are being constructed at SSKM and Medical College and Hospital (MCH) in a bid to churn out more specialists.

 ?We are in a revamp mode and neonatal care and gastroenterology are our priorities. We are creating posts and developing the infrastructure. The improvement will be apparent in a few months,? said Jayshree Mitra, state director of medical education.

 Three teaching posts each in paediatrics and gastroenterology have been sanctioned at SSKM and extension of the gynaecology building is underway. Special provisions will be made for the sprawling intensive care unit of the ward.

 The department will have lecture rooms, where theoretical and practical classes will be held for the benefit of doctors from district and sub-divisional hospitals.

 ?Newborns need critical care since they are at a vulnerable stage. Apart from providing a clean and controlled environment, there will be specialised doctors at hand round-the-clock. We will also provide training to doctors from the districts and neighbouring states,? said a doctor at SSKM.

 SSKM will also boast a new gastroenterology surgery department shortly. Construction of a four-storeyed building that will house the ward has started. Three posts have been sanctioned for the department.

 At MCH, four posts have been sanctioned for the gastroenterology surgery department, to be started soon.

 ?We only had one gastroenterology medicine department and patients needing surgeries had to be referred elsewhere. This was done at a risk to the lives of the critical patients. The new surgical department will enable us to offer all-round treatment,? said a senior professor of the department at MCH.

 He added: ?The site for the new department is being finalised. A list of equipment has already been submitted to the state government.?

 The department is likely to acquire the latest gadgets in the fields of endoscopy, fibre optic endoscopy and computer monitoring. Initially, it will be of a 20-bed capacity.

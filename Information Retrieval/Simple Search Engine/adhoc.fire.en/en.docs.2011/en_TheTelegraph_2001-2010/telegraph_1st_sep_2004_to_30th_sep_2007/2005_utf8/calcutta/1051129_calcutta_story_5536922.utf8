 Red hot: Preity Zinta

 One Bollywood lady who will never bow down to pressure or power is perky Preity Zinta. She was the only lady who stood up during the huge fiasco surrounding the alleged underworld links of the Chori Chori Chupke Chupke producers. And now she is adding fuel to the age-old fire of whether a public personality has the right to a private life. 

 Back in India after three months of shooting for Sirish Kunder?s Jaaneman and Karan Johar?s Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna in New York, she filed a criminal case of defamation against a Mumbai daily a couple of days back for publishing the contents of the controversial Salman Khan-Aishwarya Rai conversation where she is mentioned in far from lady-like terms.

 Preity?s logic is very simple: ?Besides being a film star, even I am somebody?s daughter, somebody?s sister, living in this society. You can?t overrule all that and say that a film star is a public property. I have always been honest and have a lot of self respect and that?s why I am fighting to clear my name.?

Child?s play: Makdee and Iqbal star Shweta Pandit, 

producer Sangita Ahir and actress Amrita Rao have a blast at the Esselworld promotion 

for the forthcoming Mahesh Manjrekar movie Vaah! Life Ho To Aisi

 One of the few fantasy films coming out from the Bollywood stable, Vaah! Life Ho To Aisi, is truly hatke. Coming from the maker of Vaastav and Viruddh, Mahesh Manjrekar, the movie stars Sanjay Dutt, Shahid Kapur and Amrita Rao. Dutt plays Yamraaj, the god of death, who comes down to earth and has a lot of fun.

 Last weekend saw an exciting promotional event of the movie at Mumbai?s Esselworld where Amrita along with the kid stars had a ball at the theme park. The event kick-started with the mini-marathon, where Amrita led the brat pack. A cultural event followed where the kids sang and danced to their hearts? delight. The day ended with the prize distribution where the winners were heard saying: ?Life ho to aisi...?

Kid craze: Crush Gear

 Kids can now feast on international properties like Crush Gear, Captain Tsubasa and Me amp; My Brother. Sahara One has tied up with Spacetoon Media Group, West Asia?s largest kids? entertainment brand for animation and live action content. 

 From the middle of December, Sahara One will telecast an hour of hugely popular animation and live action series branded as Spacetoon Hour. 

 According to Shantonu Aditya, CEO, Sahara One: ?We truly believe their portfolio has a host of programming gems.? Added Rajiv Sangari, CEO-India of Spacetoon International: ?This deal creates a unique offering for the Indian kids.? 

 Spacetoon?s kids content will further strengthen the kids programming offering on our channel, says Purnendu Bose, COO of Sahara One. 

 After Mumbai, Delhi and Lucknow, it?s time for the Calcutta auditions of Indian Idol 2 to be telecast. Tuesday, 8.30 pm onwards, get ready to check out the kind of talent who turned up to try their luck in front of the three judges at Lakeland Country Club. For a change, there was great chemistry between Anu Malik, Farah Khan and Sonu Nigam, with the in-sync choices taking over from the heated debates.

 Apart from the lucky few who made it, catch the ones who really tickled the funny bone. One of them was so very bad, the three judges attacked the aspirant with cardboard daggers and at the end of it all had one big hearty laugh.

 As Anu puts it: ?Calcutta has music in the air and that comes out through the contestants.? So, catch who all are in the running this time for a shot at the title. Whether it?s a struggling priest from Asansol or a vivacious girl from the India-Bangladesh border, it?s tune time.

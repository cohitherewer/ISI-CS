 STAR to switch off beam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Star turns on the dance floor, favourite saas-bahu soaps or the last few episodes of Big B?s game show before he fell ill. If you are one of the few lakh cable television viewers in Calcutta serviced by Indian Cable Net, prepare to give these and more STAR programmes a miss, next week.

 The national entertainment major ? locked in a dues battle with the city multi-system operator ? is planning to switch off signals on December 12, depriving viewers from Salt Lake to Garia and Ballygunge to Alipore a glimpse of Nach Baliye, KBC 2 or Kyunki Saas? 

 STAR had issued a public notice last month on the matter but negotiations are yet to yield results. ?The outstanding amount is Rs 2.2 crore and if there?s no other option, we?ll have to switch off,? said a STAR India official. Indian Cable Net had offered to pay Rs 1 crore upfront and then sit on the talks table. ?We can?t allow this arm twisting tactic that is turning into a trend in this industry,? he added.

 Indian Cable Net is planning to move Telecom Disputes Settlement amp; Appellate Tribunal on the matter.

 A spokesperson said: ?The dues include charges for STAR?s second bouquet of channels and a Trai mandated seven per cent rate hike which cable operators are unable to effect among subscribers.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Plays of perception

 As part of an ongoing theatre festival commemorating Munshi Premchands 125th birth anniversary, the penultimate days programme features Dansagar (picture above), directed by Neelkantha Sengupta and produced by Theatre Commune. Portraying a gloomy, desolate and grotesque view of life, it brings to focus the harsh, callous and barbaric side of human nature. Based on Premchand?s short-story Kafan, the play depicts that under abject, inhuman living conditions, our natural feelings of love, understanding and sympathy dwindle and degenerate to reveal the darker side of our selves. Also to be performed this evening is Barda, produced by Nandikar. The stage adaptation of Premchand?s Bade Bhai Saheb, the play offers a nostalgic glimpse into the lofty ideals and philosophies of the past. With gentle, indulgent humour, it also provides a critique of conventional school education. Direction: Goutam Halder.

 Event: Plays in Bengali, Dansagar, produced by Theatre Commune (at 5.30 pm) amp; Barda, produced by Nandikar (at 7 pm)

 Where: Bharatiyam, IB 201 Salt Lake

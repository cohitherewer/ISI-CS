 MP3 changed the way we listen 

 to and share music. Its ability to compress an audio file 

 and yet retain the quality helped easy distribution of any 

 song over the Internet and established MP3 as one of the 

 most popular file formats.

 Easy transportability led to easier 

 sharing of music files and also raised concerns of music 

 piracy through peer-to-peer networks like Napster and Kazaa.

 Now, MPEG-4 plans to take things 

 a few steps further. 

 MPEG-4

 It is the latest compression standard 

 that builds on the proven success of digital television, 

 interactive graphics applications and interactive multimedia 

 (like the World Wide Web). 

 According to MPEG Industry Forum, 

 the non-profit organisation which promotes emerging MPEG 

 standards, MPEG-4 brings these areas together to develop 

 a standard that enables the production of content with greater 

 reusability and flexibility than is possible today with 

 individual technologies.

 MPEG-4 also scales to transport 

 media at any data rate ? from delivery over dial-up modems 

 to high-bandwidth networks ? and across devices, from satellite 

 television to wireless gadgets.

 Extension

 The normal extension for MPEG-4 

 media is ?.mp4?. The difference between MP3 and MP4, however, 

 is that while MP3 (or MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3) is exclusively 

 used for compressing audio, MP4 supports audio, video, pictures 

 and more. 

 The recommended extension for 

 MPEG-4 audio files, however, is ?.m4a?. For distinction, 

 MP4 files may or may not contain MPEG-4 audio, but an M4A 

 file will always contain MPEG-4 audio. MP4 can be used for 

 MPEG-4 video files, combined video and audio files, or just 

 MPEG-4 audio.

 History

 MPEG-4 was defined by the Moving 

 Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the working group within the 

 International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) that 

 came up with a family of standards used for coding audio-visual 

 information (like movies, video, music) in a digital compressed 

 format. 

 The body specified the standards 

 MPEG-1 and MPEG-2. While MPEG-1 contributed to the development 

 of the CD-ROM industry, MPEG-2 helped the DVD development 

 cause. 

 MPEG-4 was also the result of 

 an international effort involving hundreds of researchers 

 and engineers. The MPEG committee designed MPEG-4 to be 

 a single standard covering the entire digital media workflow 

 ? from capture, authoring, and editing to encoding, distribution, 

 playback, and archiving.

 MPEG-4 was finalised in 1998 and 

 acquired a formal International Standard Status in 2000. 

 Some work, on extensions in specific domains, is still in 

 progress. 

 MPEG-4 and Apple

 Apple played a key role in the 

 development of MPEG-4. Apple?s QuickTime file format was 

 adopted as the basis for the MPEG-4 file format, but later 

 underwent many changes to support all the functionality 

 of MPEG-4. 

 Apple also popularised the ?.m4a? 

 extension by using the file extension in its iTunes software 

 and iPod music players to distinguish between MPEG-4 video 

 and audio files.

 To ensure that the MPEG-4 media 

 stream created using one company?s product runs on another 

 vendor?s player, Apple, together with Cisco, IBM, Kasenna, 

 Philips and Sun Microsystems, formed the Internet Streaming 

 Media Alliance (ISMA). The ISMA defines the profiles that 

 companies implement to ensure interoperability.

 Now, the big question is whether 

 MP4 will actually be able to deliver on the promises and 

 become as popular a file format as MP3.

 English tips for tech trek

 - University pact with British Council for language skills

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Concerned over reports that engineering graduates are performing poorly in job interviews, the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with British Council regarding introduction of a training course for students to improve their communication skills in English.

 The training programme, Business English Communication, has been designed by Cambridge University. The trainers will be provided by British Council, said WBUT vice-chancellor Ashoke Ranjan Thakur after signing the MoU.

 ?There is widespread concern that our students are being found wanting in English communication, not only at job interviews but also while in service. This, despite the fact that most of them are good in academics. The training programme will be of great help to the students,? the vice-chancellor said.

 Business houses, especially information technology firms, had recently approached the WBUT, requesting it to take steps to improve students? communication skills in English.

 The university officials said the companies had even approached chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and expressed concern over the failure of engineering graduates to communicate properly in English. 

 The issue was later discussed at various levels. Finally, acting on a directive by the chief minister, the authorities of WBUT, with which more than 40 private engineering colleges are affiliated, decided to sign the MoU with British Council.

 A large number of students who have passed out from the engineering colleges in the past few years have studied English from Class V. The Left Front government had reintroduced teaching of English from Class I only in 2004. 

 According to Thakur, 70 students from 10 engineering colleges will initially participate in the training programme. Other colleges will be asked later to send students for training.

 The course will be offered in three phases and the fees will be decided on shortly. In the first phase, the students will have to attend a total of 30 hours of lectures.

 The course will be offered on the WBUT campus in Salt Lake. If necessary, arrangements will be made to hold the training in the districts, too, to enable students there to join the course.

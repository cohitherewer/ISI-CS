 Calcuttas favourite tearoom Flurys is celebrating Raksha Bandhan in style. Labelled Rakhi Special Delights, the Park Street address has cooked up a range of scrumptious sweets like Mishti Doi and Raspberry Torte, Rich Chocolate Cake with Assorted Sandesh and Fresh Peach Gateau with Assorted Sandesh. 

 Its a blend that keeps in mind Bengali tastes as well as Swiss confectionery delights, says a spokesperson.

 A separate section has been devoted to gifts galore. Here one can expect the Cookie and Chocolate Tray with Rakhi, Truffle Chocolate Box with Rakhi and Cute Cuddly Toys. The sweets are priced between Rs 150 and Rs 350. 

 Desert digs

 The rocky spine of the Aravalli range divides Rajasthan into two halves of a startling dichotomy. On one side a barren desert and on the other, lush green forests. It is this diversity that is reflected in Rajasthali, a Rajasthani food festival at Sonargaon at Taj Bengal. 

 The festival, being held at the Indian speciality eatery between August 18 and 28, showcases culinary delights the desert state has to offer.

 The fare, offered for both lunch and dinner, presents the cuisine from the Marwar, Mewar, Hadoti and Dhaundhar districts of Rajasthan. 

 The experience starts off with the hot desert drink of Raabri, followed by the main courses. 

 For non-vegetarians, the dishes to watch out for are Maas ke Sule (picatta of lamb treated with marinade of kacchri, cloves, red chillis and yoghurt, before being smoked and grilled) and Laal Maas (reputed to be Rajasthans favourite lamb delicacy).

 Murgh Soyeta (spring chicken cooked with desert spices with a hint of fresh coriander) and Ajwani Macchhi ke Tikkey (fillet of river sole matured in a rich marinade of dill, fennel, ginger and honey, scented with mustard oil and gilded in the tandoor) are the other non-veg dishes recommended.

 The vegetarians can choose from a host of desert delicacies, the high points of which are the Ker Sanger (sour berries and long-stemmed sanger soaked overnight and dressed with asafoetida tempered spices and dried mango strips) and Dhaniya Mongodi (lentil dumplings stir fried in a kadhai with tomatoes and fresh coriander).

 On a roll

 Traditionally, the heart of the city has been the favourite haunt of the trademark roll (kathi kebabs wrapped in a paratha).

 But south Calcutta now has a new takeway roll address ? Rap Roll outside Priya cinema. The rolls in this part of the city are not as good as you get in central Calcutta, says Daniel Ghaznavi, owner of Rap Roll.

 There is a wide range of rolls and other kebabs available here. The prices have been kept competitive keeping the cinema-goer in mind, he adds. The counter also sells Paneer Tikka, Fish Amritsari and Tandoori Chicken. The cost of the fun munch is between Rs 10 and Rs 60.

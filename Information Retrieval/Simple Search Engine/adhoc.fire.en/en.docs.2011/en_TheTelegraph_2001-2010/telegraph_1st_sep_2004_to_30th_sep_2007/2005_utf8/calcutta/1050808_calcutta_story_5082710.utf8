 Eastern belief meets western beat

 SUBHRO SAHA

 A brooding Finnish organ on the laptop, a few keys on the harmonium or the sandpaper tenor of crunching leaves under moving feet. These are but some of the elements Stephen Rush beads together to string a cornucopia of sounds for his comrade Robert Spalding Newcomb to take off from.

 I create a context of notes for Robert to play with and he then weaves his improvised solos around those, Stephen explained to Goodlife on Saturday.

 The American duo, presented by the public affairs office, US consulate-general, Calcutta, in collaboration with Calcutta School of Music Jazz Listeners Forum, mesmerised the audience at the Lincoln Room, American Center, in the evening with a wide range of experimental repertoire.

 They call it techno ambient music influenced by India, and the influence is both subtle and strong in both buddies who have always shared musical philosophies and political beliefs, and have been initiated in India and its music under different circumstances.

 When Stephen was 16, he felt frustrated with the constrictions of a fundamentally Christian family. The search for other paradigms led him to the Bhagavad Gita, from which he now uses elements to teach his students about listening to their inner/outer muse. He also got hooked to Carnatic music since his first exposure to the form in Yale as a student (it brought tears to my eyes), and has been studying it since 1992.

 For Robert, who has been playing the guitar for more than 30 years, India arrived on the strings of the sitar in a state of near-trance following the death of his mother Wanda. I was in the process of cremating her remains when I thought I heard her say ? are you Hindu? which triggered a kind of digression, recalled Robert, director of information technology, University of Michigan School of Music.

 Sitar lessons from Rajan Sachdeva in Detroit followed and Robert still learns by the ear as he performs his improvised solos on stage. And improvisation is very much the essence of their music, often kicked off by the prankster that lurks in Stephen, who remembers memorising basic asanas after watching the TV show Lilias, Yoga and You.

 Yes, I would often try to throw Robert off track with my intro, try to distract him, in the vein of Carnatic exchanges, smiled Stephen. Only for Robert to retort: I know he would set off to do that and typically, I must soar over it, while also dipping into the kick-off bars rhythmically. The trick is to not get sucked into the web and keep an escape route open.

 The exchanges on Saturday evening were replete with many such magical moments. Among the standout numbers was Padam, a slow and beautiful Carnatic piece composed by Stephen and played by Robert on sitar, about intimacy with the divine. Air Dance, a guitar piece, was flagged off with a traditional north Indian beat and ended effortlessly with a techno texture.

 Its this ability to straddle different elements with elan that I found fascinating when I invited them to come to India to make and teach music, said Nita Kumar, director of Nirman, a Varanasi-based NGO working for education and the arts. The duo camped in Varanasi for a week prior to the Calcutta trip, holding workshops on western influences in Indian music.

 Nirman, which has also facilitated the passage of nine students from the University of Michigan to Varanasi, is sending students from India to the US. We hope to carry this exchange initiative to students of other cities, including Calcutta, stressed Nita.

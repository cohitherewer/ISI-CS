For those with a thing for flashy novelties, there are stained glass candle-holders embellished with colourful butterflies.

 While these can sit pretty on tabletops in nooks and corners of your home, the ornate candle stands can enhance the festive flavour by lighting up your space during the Pujas and for Diwali.

 These make for great gift options, too, especially for the forthcoming festival of lights. 

 With the festival fever on, these imported candle stands from China are very popular with the young brigade, though they also catch the attention of elderly people as suitable gift options, offers a spokesperson for Giggles, which houses a wide selection of these candle stands.

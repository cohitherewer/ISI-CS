The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tagorean heritage

 Tagore songs have a timeless appeal upon the Bengali consciousness. A remarkable gesture by Rabindrasangeet exponent Mohan Singh (picture, far left), this evenings programme is his way of personally introducing his son, Vikram Singh (picture, left), to a discerning Calcutta audience. Comprising a selection of Tagore songs including popular favourites, tappa numbers and brahmasangeet, the concert promises to be a rare feast for Rabindrasangeet lovers. Fittingly called Parampara, the introductory piece, Anandadhara bahichhe bhuvane, will be rendered by the young scion. Featuring songs from the Prem and Puja sections of Tagore?s musical oeuvre, there will be both solo and duet (Kotha hotey baje prembedona re) numbers performed by father and son. Solo renditions by Mohan Singh will include E ki karuna, karunamoy, Aami hethay thaki shudhu, Aamar paran loye ki khela, Aamar paran jaha chai, Tumi rabey nirabey, Na chaahiley jaare paowa jai and Asim kalosagorey. Among Vikram Singh?s solo numbers are Kar milan chao birohee, Aami bohu basonay pranpone chai, Tomay notun korey pabo boley, Majhe majhe tabo dekha pai, Bhalobeshe sakhi nibhritey jataney, Biraha madhur holo aji, Aamar mallikaboney and Tobu mone rekho. Hosted by Bhavna.

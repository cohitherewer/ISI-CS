The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through 2005 without...

 Being good to yourself

When they wish you Happy New Year, take it to heart. Start off with a little light 

pampering and cap off with taking that casual hobby more seriously. You can only 

make others happy when there?s joy in your heart, so don?t sell those dreams so 

cheap, no more.

Trying to make a difference

Contribute generously to a tsunami fund for starters. Then, look around more carefully 

to see where you may be useful or less destructive. Saying no to plastic, refraining 

from littering the road, using car pool more often, donating that pile of old 

clothes in your suitcase, teaching your domestic help how to read and write? there 

are endless possibilities of making this year a little better for those around 

you.

 Backpacking around the world

Repenting for having put your Thailand trip on the backburner for too long? Well, 

better hurry now and check out as much of this beautiful planet this year as you 

can. If you dig hitch-hiking and backpacking, nothing like it, or watch Discovery 

Travel amp; Living for some cool tips.

Trading the old for the new

A brand New Year is always a good excuse to finally chuck that old pair of denims 

or that nag of a boyfriend. Bury the past if it hasn?t been too pleasant and start 

afresh this Jan. If that sounds too radical just give your house a fresh coat 

of paint or at least get yourself a facial to do justice to the turn of yet another 

year.

Contacting the aliens

So that they can see what?s coming and warn you when earthlings are too confused 

to fathom what?s happening to their own planet. Before you dismiss it as the stuff 

of science fiction, try meditation, telepathy, voodoo or black magic. If nothing 

else, you can be the next Spielberg (not Rakesh Roshan) or Asimov!

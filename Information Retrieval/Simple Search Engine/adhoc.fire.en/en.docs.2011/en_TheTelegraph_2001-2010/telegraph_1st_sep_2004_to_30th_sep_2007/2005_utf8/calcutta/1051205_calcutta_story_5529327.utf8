The comeback of Sourav: The Player went nowhere thanks to the cloud cover, but Souravs: The Food Pavilion is going places thanks to its kitchen capers.

 After catering to the US Air Force squad for two weeks at the Kalaikunda airbase, Sourav Gangulys signature food stop on Park Street is now busy feeding some of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees poster boys in Sector V.

 Souravs: The Food Pavilion made its first foray into the information technology (IT) hub of Salt Lake last week with a food court at Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS).

 Covers 300, ambience swank, menu multi-cuisine ? the first food court by Souravs would be 24X7, with something cooking round-the-clock.

 The former Team India skipper would have inaugurated the food court himself had he not got his comeback call that took him to Chennai, says Team Souravs, happy that its talisman is in the dressing rather than the dining room.

 This Souravs-CTS tie-up would provide the tech companys employees a free run of the food court. 

 Outsiders would not be allowed into the food court for security reasons. And with the work force we have, we would not require outsiders to fill up the place. The food has to be healthy and hygienic. After having served the US Army, we are sure we would get quality for money from Souravs, reveals a spokesperson for Cognizant.

 The all-round menu (nothing to do with Souravs new-found all-rounder status) would comprise north Indian, south Indian, Bengali, Chinese and Continental. The wide variety in cuisine kind keeps in mind the varied taste of the tech force.

 Besides the standard menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Chinese, Continental and Bengali combo meals are being served up. High tea and midnight snacks are also on the platter.

 The training session with the officers from the US health department before the Kalaikunda exercise has come in handy as Souravs pads up for its Sector V debut. 

 From storage of provisions to washing vegetables and meat, we would be adhering to all the safety standards. The brief from Cognizant is to provide healthy and hygienic food. After Kalaikunda, we know how to serve clean, healthy and hygienic food. With IT a growing market, catering here ensures volumes. We would be getting into other ventures like this also, stresses Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO, Souravs.

 Where volume is the mantra, the price tag is less than princely. So, the meal prices at the food court would range between Rs 25 and Rs 70. We have been involved with the operation of restaurants, but the food-court is a new model for us... Sourav will soon pay a visit to the food court, signs off Mazumdar.

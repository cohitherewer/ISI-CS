 It's Your Birthday So...

 You are not easily swayed by flattery and know the difference between fantasy and fact. You dislike being taken advantage of; so, you?re wary of making friends. Though you?re a good money manager, you?re better at human interaction. You dont respect anyone who can?t keep his commitments. A role as a teacher would suit you, though you are also the entrepreneurial type. ? Kusum Bhandari

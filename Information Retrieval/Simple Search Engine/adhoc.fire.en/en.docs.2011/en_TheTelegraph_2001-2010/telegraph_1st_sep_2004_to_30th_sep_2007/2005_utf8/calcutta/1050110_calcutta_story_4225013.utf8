IPSITA DEB

A sprawling floor full of exquisite artefacts, luxurious 

divans, mirrors in different shapes and sizes and arty figurines in various forms 

? all this and much more make Home amp; Us, a home d?cor studio on Gurusaday 

Road, really special. 

What was started by Meera Bansal nine years ago as 

a means to keep herself busy ?after coming to terms with the tragic loss of a 

loved one?, is today among the city?s premier interiors and lifestyle boutiques. 

?In the initial days of Home amp; Us it was almost 

like a tourist spot,? she recalls. ?I still remember that the Oberoi tourist buses 

used to stop here so that visitors could carry interesting Indian curios back 

home.?

Since then, cricketers, filmstars and NRIs have been 

regulars at the store that also draws a limited but loyal local clientele. 

Display

The store is mapped out in such a way that each and 

every article finds prominence in the display. ?I want people to walk into the 

store and visualise these items in the confines of their homes. For instance, 

I?ve kept the chairs on either side of the table, with matching upholstery and 

enhanced lighting so that the guest can get an idea about the whole effect,? says 

Bansal. Even figurines have been artistically placed on top of chest of drawers 

instead of usual racks. 

Furniture

Designer furniture is the forte of the store and hence 

one can find tables, chairs, chests and consoles in a variety of styles (pictures 

by Rashbehari Das). 

l the furniture, whether simple or intricately carved, 

are made of pure wood in different shades of brown. The upholstery is chosen by 

Bansal in keeping with the colour of the wood. While the single chairs are priced 

between Rs 4,000 and Rs 7,500, the centre tables start from Rs 6,800 and can go 

up to Rs 1 lakh. 

While there are some pieces ready to be picked up, 

one can get them custom-made by choosing the designs from catalogues. ?I also 

make furniture according to specific requirements of a certain home,? says Bansal, 

an interior designer by profession.

Accessories

The wooden lamps and mirrors that the store offers 

would add value to any drawing room. As would a range of hand-made figurines of 

Rajasthani villagers created from chemical compounds by artistes. These are priced 

upwards of Rs 3,000. 

The studio also plays host to paintings by artists 

like Shekhar Kaul, Sameer Sarkar, Gaurango Beshai and Debashish Das.

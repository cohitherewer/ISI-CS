 To the rescue of the survivors

 Close to 21 artists, all from Calcutta save one, had gathered at Olpadvala Memorial Trust Hall on Friday morning waiting for George N. Sibley, US consul-general in Calcutta, to arrive. 

 The Calcutta Zoroastrian Community?s Religious and Charity Fund had organised a two-day art camp, conducted by Gallery Katayun, for the benefit of tsunami survivors. 

 The artists were provided with art material. By lunchtime, Aditya Basak had nearly completed a rather large work on paper of a boy awake under the stars after having witnessed the fury of nature. 

 Sajal Sarkar, originally from Calcutta but now settled in Vadodara, too, had completed a large head drawn with charcoal, a compelling work.

 Mrinal Mondal used a pencil to produce fine landscapes. The outlines of huge trees and other greenery had already appeared on the sheet of paper, like forms seen through a fog.

 Chandra Bhattacharya was flecking the figure of a man in a loincloth with fine brush strokes. 

 Balaka, daughter of Bikash Bhattacharjee, had taken up painting a few years ago. Now, she is a full-time artist trying to work independently. Large green leaves dappled with yellow were gradually appearing on her canvas as she worked on it with her brush.

 Characters from Shakespearean plays were what Kishore Chatterjee had planned to paint. Bottom is what he produced ? a man with the head of a donkey ? in the idiosyncratic style that has become the hallmark of this self-taught artist.

 Sanatan Dinda, who has made a name for himself by painting Mother Teresa, did a dark, rather sinister-looking, figure. The organiser, Katayun Saklat, better known for her stained glass, had decided to take up the paintbrush, too. Soon, there was a head in flaming colours.

 Partha Shaw had applied paint on both canvases and sat in contemplation before them.

 For sheer speed, there is no match for Subrata Gangopadhyay. The artist sat in front of a bare canvas, dabbed some dark brown on to it, and within about 15 minutes, it had transformed into the head of a beautiful woman.

 Paritosh Sen had already sent two canvases. One depicted a woman taking a shower. The other a woman before a mirror about to wear a bindi. 

 Shuvaprasanna did a sketch of a flower which he intended to finish at home. His wife Shipra Bhattacharya promised to paint on a small canvas.

 An auction of the works was not held. Instead, a sponsor, who wished to remain anonymous, has promised to pay all the expenses and a minimum of Rs 2 lakh for the tsunami fund. 

 In exchange, he will get all the paintings produced.

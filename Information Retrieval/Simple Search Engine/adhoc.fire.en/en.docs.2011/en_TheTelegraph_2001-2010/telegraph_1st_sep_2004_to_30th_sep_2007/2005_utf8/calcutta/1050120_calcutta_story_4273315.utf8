 Ball recovery turns fatal

 - Gully cricketer slips down manhole, dies trapped in mud

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the ball he had driven slipped into a manhole, Surojit Bhattacharya climbed resolutely in, only to be swallowed by the dark street pit. After a two-hour search, the 20-year-old?s mud-caked body was fished out.

 Surojit died on Wednesday morning after being trapped in the slush inside an 18-ft drainage pit at Sukantanagar, in Salt Lake. He had climbed down a manhole on the EM Bypass-Nicco Park connector.

 Bhattacharya and seven others were playing cricket on the road linking the Bypass connector with Vidyaniketan School since 10.30 am.

 ?I bowled at Surojit, who gently hit the ball back. I couldn?t catch the ball and it slid through a narrow gap in the concrete slab that was covering the square manhole. Surojit removed the slab and spotted the ball floating down in the pit,? said Kaushik Mandal, a friend.

 ?Surojit planned to pick up the ball with his feet. He removed his jacket and shoes, and lowered himself into the three-ft-by-three-ft manhole, holding on to the edges. I asked him to hold my hand, but he refused,? Kaushik recalled.

 Suddenly, Surojit slipped and fell into the manhole. He couldn?t even raise a scream before the darkness swallowed him. ?I saw his hands rising out of the mud once and groping for a grip, but within seconds, they disappeared,? said Kaushik.

 Surojit?s cricket companions then alerted the fire brigade. But it was two hours before firemen and local residents could recover his body.

 ?We had to first pump out the water. Municipal labourers then climbed down and traced the body. It appears that he died after being stuck in the mud and not because of any poisonous gas,? said an officer of Bidhannagar (South) police station.

 ?After bringing him out of the manhole, officials of Bidhannagar Municipality rushed him to Suraksha Hospital, where he was declared dead,? said Chayan Mukherjee, inspector-general of police (law and order).

 Municipal workers had been cleaning the drainage line for the past two days. ?We are verifying whether there was a lapse on the part of the contractor in charge of the clean-up,? added Mukherjee.

 Shiben Dey, headmaster of Vidyaniketan School, said: ?There are four other manholes bordering our compound. I have alerted all students and asked them not to go near the manholes.?

Ramesh Bar, councillor of ward no. 22, said: ?We plan 

to erect a permanent fencing around the manhole.?

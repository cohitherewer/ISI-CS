Life

 Brighter than the sun

 Goodlife caught up with 24-year-old Gauri Bajoria, who is packing her bags for an overseas trip to showcase her latest collection.

 Foreign flag: Her first stop is London, where along with a bevy of Indian designers she has been chosen to take part in an exhibition-cum-show in Kensington Town Hall, organised by the Ladies Wing of the Indian Merchants Chamber.

 Gauri plans to grab the market in a fashion hub of the world. I want to analyse the market needs and trends there and start supplying, she says.

 Look lustre: The collection is highly wearable with psychedelic nuances. Psychedelic bands, contrasting colours and textured fabrics form the basis of her latest line.

 Colour code: The palette is bright ? orange, red, turquoise and bright yellow are some of the dominant colours. 

 Fabric feel: Cotton and sheer fabrics like crepe and chiffon are the seasonal offerings. The simplicity of the sheer fabrics comes out in creations that are not typically sexy but very sensuous. Not much is revealed and a lot is left to the imagination, smiles Gauri. 

 Ethnic edge: The line is very western, but imbibes Indian elements. While the silhouettes are western, the embellishments are very ethnic. Theres a lot of texturing, feathers, ribbons, sequins and block printing in gold.

 Skirt style: The emphasis is on skirts ? the lively Mexican-style, flowy Can Can and the long and layered Victorian look. Straight, long and A-line are some of the popular cuts used. 

 Hand painting on skirts and jackets with machine and hand embroidery over it is Gauris latest style. Besides, the use of geometric shapes and sizes ? circles and straight lines, both vertical and horizontal ? are visible in many of her ensembles.

 Future file: Her next stop after London is Singapore on June 10, where she will showcase at a solo exhibition.

 Bulgarian bulldozer: Stanislav Ianevski plays Viktor Krum in Harry Potter

 He had never read a page of Harry Potter when he was cast as Viktor Krum in the fourth celluloid instalment of the JK Rowling creation. But 20-year-old Bulgarian-born Stanislav Ianevski is now as much a part of the Potter world as anybody else.

 ?Well, I hadn?t read the books or seen the films but as soon as I got the part, I read the books, up to the fourth one, and I saw the films,? says Ianevski, who joins as the Durmstrang Institute?s competitor for the Triwizard Tournament Cup against Hogwarts and the Beauxbatons.

 Interestingly, Ianevski was discovered quite by chance for the role of Krum while at his British boarding school. ?I was late for my afternoon registration and was obviously a bit nervous and rushing through to sign in,? he recalls. 

 ?But the casting director heard me talking and turned around, saw me, and developed an interest. I was kept the longest and asked to go to two workshops afterwards, which I didn?t go to for various reasons. But then I did get a call back, and later I met (director) Mike (Newell), and it turned out that I got it.?

 An expert in many a sport including tennis, football, rugby, athletics and swimming, Ianevski has a sporty role in the much-awaited movie that releases on Friday. ?Krum is the world?s best Quidditch player, so he?s obviously well-based in the magic world of Harry Potter,? he says. ?People describe him as being very physical, although I think he has got two sides ? very concentrated, knowing what he?s doing and also, he?s got a big heart and he?s got feelings for Hermione. So, I think he?s a great character.?

 And being the athletic kind, Ianevski got to do many of his own stunts in the film. ?I personally enjoyed doing some with the water,? he smiles. ?I had a dive and I enjoyed that most because it took a lot of courage and a lot of time, and a huge amount of effort.?

 Playing such an important role in such an important film has meant a big change in Ianevski. ?I?ve gained a lot of experience and a lot of confidence, especially being in front of a group of people, even a crowd,? he reveals. ?I couldn?t do that before. I was quite a nervous guy. But I?ve also found out what I want to do in the future, which is I?m hoping to continue acting.?

 The stardom, too, is sinking in slowly. ?I don?t think you can actually be prepared for what?s really going to happen after the show comes out ? because the fan base is worldwide. It?s absolutely huge, so I guess we just have to face it and do our best.?

 And is he happy playing Viktor Krum? ?(Given a choice) I?ll probably try out Voldemort,? smiles Ianevski. ?We?ve only just seen what he?s actually like in a human way, and I would love to try and see what it feels like to be the dark lord.?

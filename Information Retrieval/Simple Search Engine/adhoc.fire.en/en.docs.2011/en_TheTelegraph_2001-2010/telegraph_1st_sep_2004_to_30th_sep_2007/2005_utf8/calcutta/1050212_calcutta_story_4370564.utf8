The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Our top actresses are so hypocritical: Neha

(From top) Neha Dhupia, with Sonu Sood in 

Sheesha, and in the famous Julie pose 

 Her bare-back posture in Julie has almost become an Andy Warhol. And alongside other things, NEHA DHUPIA gave Bollywood one of the first hits of 2004. Now, the actress is back with her new sizzler on celluloid, Sheesha. 

 The actress talks to Pratim D. Gupta about how she has become a brand name in the industry.

 Is Sheesha trying to repeat the success 

of Julie?

 Sheesha is a completely different film from Julie. Whenever there?s Neha Dhupia in the cast, there is a preconceived notion that the film falls under a certain category or genre of films. 

 It?s taken for granted that the film has to have a lot more exposure than the rest of the films.

 Sheesha is a thriller. It is a violent romance and shows how things go awry in a particular relationship involving me, of course.

 But the bold promos have something else to say?

 I don?t think that the promos show anything like that. There are no kisses in the trailers. They do not show anything. There are, of course, some elements of passion. But don?t all films today have such elements? 

 At the end of the day, it is the story which counts. The story has to work for the film.

 So, what is your role in Sheesha?

 I play a fashion designer named Sia who has this romantic relationship with this character played by Sonu Sood. There is a rubberband kind of emotional upheavals in the film and the plot takes a lot of twists and turns which you do not expect as you watch the film. Since it?s a thriller, I can?t reveal much more at this stage.

 How was it like working with the team of Guddu 

Dhanoa, who has dished out many a Bollywood potboiler in the past?

 Oh! It?s been great working with all three of the producers ? Gudduji, Sunil Saini and Deepak Sharma. We have already finished shooting for another film, Siskiyan, and are starting yet another film together called Punjabi Bahu. So now, it?s almost a family. I have a great working relationship with them. To be honest, I am not that difficult a person to work with (laughs).

 And what about Sonu Sood, who dazzled in his cameo 

in Yuva?

 He is very good. He has this different kind of energy which he brings to the sets and he always tries to give his best shot. He is also very co-operative as a co-actor. 

 l Both of you are models-turned-actors. So models can act?

 Of course, they can. It was always a myth. Most top actors today were originally models. And most non-model actors are now getting into modelling. So, what are we talking about here?

 Do you think the success of Julie played 

a role in other top-notch actresses exposing on screen?

 Definitely. Julie?s success had a bearing. But what I dislike most in the industry is the hypocrisy of the top actresses. They all have these superiority and inferiority complexes. They love spitting on other actresses. 

 We had one top actress saying she would never kiss on screen, and only last Friday (February 4) her new release has her in a kissing sequence. Then, another big actress had said that she would never pose backless like Neha Dhupia in Julie. And now, her new film, which releases in March, has her backless on the posters. So what were they talking about?

 Which are your forthcoming releases after Sheesha?

 I have Siskiyan ready. Then I have just finished shooting for Ektaa Kapoor?s new film Kya Kool Hai Hum. I am also slated to do a film with Harry Baweja. We are still at the scripting stage. Then there?s Punjabi Bahu with the Sheesha production team. 

 Not all of these are the so called sexy films. Just one of those four films is a touch bold. For an actress like me who believes in doing only one project at a time, giving five films a year to my audiences is a lot. 

 And I am going to surprise a lot of people with my role in Siskiyan which is a psychological thriller and I play a very offbeat character. No one has seen me in such an avatar before. 

 You came to Calcutta for the launch of BED recently. 

What were your first impressions on the new nightclub in town?

 I arrived real, real late that night and could only spend a couple of hours there. But I loved what I saw of the place. The most important thing is that BED has a lot of outdoor space for parties and events. 

 That works for a person like me who wants to spend time outdoors as opposed to being bogged down inside. We also had a great time partying there.

 What else keeps bringing you back to Calcutta 

so often?

 I completely freak out on the city?s food. While there is an amazing variety on offer, for weight conscious people like me, something like the Steamed Bekti is quite awesome. 

 I have plans to come to Calcutta again some time at the end of this month and am really looking forward to it.

 Sanatan Dinda

 Artist and Puja theme-maker

What is happening today in the name of theme is mere 

innovative craft, which is too limited to be recognised as art. Going to a Bihar 

village and copying Madhubani or studying a temple and replicationg it does not 

lead to any work of art. Picasso had drawn the handlebar of a cycle and a cycle 

seat on it to give it the shape of a bull?s head. That is innovative art where 

the thought is original. We cannot move away from the fundamentals of religious 

prescription while making an idol. But at the same time no form can stay constant 

over the years. An artist will constantly seek his own form through fresh meditation. 

So the form of the Devi has to move out of the confines of Kumartuli styles.

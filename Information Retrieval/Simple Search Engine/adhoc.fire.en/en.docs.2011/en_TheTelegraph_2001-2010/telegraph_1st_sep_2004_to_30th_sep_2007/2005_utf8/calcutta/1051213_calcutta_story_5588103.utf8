 Friday night?s World Cup draw for Germany 2006 has set champions Brazil and challengers England on a semi-final collision course. And with seven months to go, the soccer-crazy Calcuttan is already beginning to wear his allegiance.

 A Rooney or Ronaldo, Beckham or Ronaldinho keeps popping up on the streets with increasing regularity these days, as youngsters slip into the shirts and shoes of their on-field icons, just to look cool. With World Cup fever setting in, soccer merchandise, already hot commodity on the city?s retail racks, is set to go full-court press.

 ?Tracking international football is now considered hip by Calcutta?s youth and idolising the stars through apparel replicas is very much in fashion,? says Kamal Jain, who runs the Adidas, Nike and Reebok stores at City Centre, and the Nike flagship store and another Adidas outlet on Shakespeare Sarani.

 While match-balls, shin guards, rainwear, ?coach jackets? and soccer ?off-court? shoes (sans studs) are moving well too, it?s the replica club and country shirts (average price tag Rs 1,500-2,700), which have become a ?lifestyle statement? in town, registering a growth of 50 per cent, year-on-year.

 If Beckham and Raul are the most sought-after individual shirts (both sponsored by Adidas), the Brazil national team jersey (by Nike) remains the perennial favourite, confirms Jain.

 ?It?s a craze that has really grown in the past 18 months, as big brands are gauging the real market potential here,? observes Madhusudan Binani, another franchisee of Adidas, running the Forum outlet.

 The two majors, endorsing most of the European biggies between them ? Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Ajax Amsterdam and AC Milan are with Adidas even as Chelsea joins the fray next year, while Manchester United and Arsenal are with Nike ? are also warming up to the retail race.

 quot;Now football is considered sexy in this part of the world too, and we are bullish on India, quot; Andreas Giller, country head of Adidas had gushed during the launch of the federation shirts of the nations it will sponsor in Germany 2006.

 Sriram Darbha, brand manager, Adidas India Marketing Ltd, mirrors the buoyancy. quot;Calcutta is obviously a big market and thats precisely why we chose this city to unveil World Cup jerseys of France, Germany, Spain, Argentina, Japan and Trinidad and Tobago, quot; Darbha told Metro from Delhi.

 Nike, which already has top draws like Rooney and Ronaldo of Man-U and Henry and Pires of Arsenal, has invested heavily on World and European Footballer of the Year Ronaldinho of Brazil and Barcelona. quot;Ronaldinho shirts and boots are hugely in demand these days, as are the Brazil alternative cool colours, tracks, shorts and bags, quot; said Jain.

 Its the 15-22 age group that is lapping up the soccer stuff, and both Adidas and Nike have made schools and colleges their attacking third apart from malls and high streets, promoting the game and its merchandise and kicking up a wave of excitement among GeNext.

 quot;Off-field soccer apparel is getting big too. So even round-neck tees embossed with their favourite stars names, which can be worn with jeans, and combination boots are moving well. Earlier, students from the citys elite schools would favour only cricket and its stars. Now, soccer is extremely stylish too and they know all the names, quot; smiled Binani.

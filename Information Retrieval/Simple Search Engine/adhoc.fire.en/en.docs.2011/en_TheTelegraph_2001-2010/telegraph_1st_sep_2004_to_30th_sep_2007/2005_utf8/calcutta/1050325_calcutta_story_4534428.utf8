 HC raps panel for Victoria report

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday described as ?incomplete, incorrect, inadequate and inconclusive? the report of a three-member expert committee on whether an underground toilet and a pump house could be constructed in a park off Victoria Memorial.

 During the hearing, counsel for Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) submitted a report prepared by G.S. Giri, joint director of Botanical Survey of India.

 The detailed report offers suggestions on the types of trees that should be grown in the green buffer belt around the Memorial compound, as had been sought by the court.

 A division bench of the court, comprising Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguli and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutt, directed the three experts to appear before it on March 31 and submit individual and separate reports on the matter.

 The experts are the CMC director-general (civil), executive engineer (city) of the state public works department and the executive engineer of the Central public works department.

 Expressing its displeasure with the report submitted by the team on Friday, the court observed that the experts did not cooperate with the court and instructed them to explain their attitude.

 According to Subhas Dutta, environmentalist and petitioner in the case, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, the Centre?s apex body on environmental issues, had conducted a survey in 1991 on environmental degradation and protection of Victoria Memorial.

 The 350-page report, submitted in April 1992, contained both short-term and long-term recommendations on how to save the heritage structure from damage by air pollutants.

 The idea of creating a ?green belt? buffer zone around Victoria Memorial was put forward in the report.

 Dutta maintained that the trees planted in the park constructed by the CMC near the heritage structure were seasonal in nature and shed their leaves in winter, negating the purpose of the green belt. He moved the high court on the basis of the NEERI report.

 The court later instructed the CMC to coordinate with G.S. Giri on the matter.

 A toilet and a pump house were also being built within the CMC garden. Both Dutta and the Victoria Memorial authorities raised objections against the constructions, as they were blocking the view of the heritage monument.

 The court had then appointed the three-member committee to prepare a report on whether the toilet and the pump house could be constructed underground or not.

 The report was submitted last week. 

 The three members of the committee will have to be appear before the high court bench on March 31 at 3 pm with individual reports and explanations as to why they spent very little effort on the matter.

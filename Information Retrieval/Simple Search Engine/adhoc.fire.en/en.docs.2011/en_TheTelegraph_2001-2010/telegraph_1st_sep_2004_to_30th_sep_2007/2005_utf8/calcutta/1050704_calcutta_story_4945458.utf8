 Remembering a lost friend

 The city glitterati gathered at Princeton Club on Prince Anwar Shah Road on 

Friday for a sombre gathering. The occasion was a condolence meeting organised 

by friends in memory of make-up artiste Prabir Kumar De, who was killed on June 

15, 2005, in a freak train accident. Among those spotted in the crowd were actors 

Jeet, June, Swastika Mukherjee and Locket Chatterjee, fashion designers Sharbari 

Datta, Snehashish, Chhuti, Agnimitra, Mona and Pali and models Sayantani, Sanchita 

and Devdutta. Those close to De spoke about times spent with the glamour industry 

veteran. A musical tribute by singers Pota and Aditi Gupta was also on the agenda.

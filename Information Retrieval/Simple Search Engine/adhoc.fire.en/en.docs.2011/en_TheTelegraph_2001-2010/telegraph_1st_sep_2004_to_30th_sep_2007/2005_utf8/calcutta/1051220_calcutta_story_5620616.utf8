The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New campus 2010 

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 St Xavier?s College Calcutta plans to mark its 150th year in style ? unveiling a sprawling new-age campus off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in 2010.

 The second campus, a fair distance from the Park Street landmark founded in 1860, is being touted as a global centre of excellence for higher learning (an artist?s impression above).

 Spread over 17 bighas, the second campus will, for starters, play host to postgraduate programmes in management, media studies, bio-sciences and information technology (IT).

 ?One of the main reasons for having another campus is to increase the number of postgraduate courses, and get into research and consultancy as well. It is a proven fact that all great centres of learning have extremely dedicated R amp;D facilities, and they undertake prestigious consultancy projects as well,? said Father P.C. Matthew, principal, St Xavier?s College Calcutta.

 The Xaviers second campus will have all requisite infrastructure for it to be on a par with the best, he added.

 From broadband and LAN services to wi-fi hotspots, it is going to be a techno campus with state-of-the-art laboratories and digitised libraries.

 ?A good faculty, library and laboratories are lifelines for the success and well-being of any educational institution. We have to provide facilities that can vie with the best of international campuses,? points out Mathew.

 The campus will also have separate 250-room hostels for male and female students, indoor sports complex, tennis courts, swimming pool and a clubhouse for the college alumni.

 With an estimated expenditure of Rs 60 crore, raising funds is now a priority on the Park Street campus, with the St Xavier?s College Alumni playing a key role in activating a global network to mobilise resources.

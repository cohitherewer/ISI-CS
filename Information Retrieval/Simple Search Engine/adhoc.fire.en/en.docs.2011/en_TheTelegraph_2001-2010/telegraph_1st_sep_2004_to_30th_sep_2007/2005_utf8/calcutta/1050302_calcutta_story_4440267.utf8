The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Jon Bon Jovi Do not take up too much responsibility; 

it may become difficult to deal with later. At work, you could be ruthlessly efficient; 

in personal matters, you are giving and caring. Try to keep options open when 

making decisions. When in a good mood, you can spread cheer. You live every minute 

to the fullest. ? Kusum Bhandari

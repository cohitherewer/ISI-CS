 Silent rebellion

 Silence is often said to be a powerful and effective vehicle of social reform. An attempt to protest and put an end to the continued violation of womens rights across all sections of society and in different spheres of life, Pratibadi Nari, a one-of-a-kind mime presentation performed by rural women, is an attestation of this fact. Being held in co-operation with the ministry of culture, government of India, the show goes far beyond simply highlighting the suffering, dishonour and indignity that women have to endure in their daily lives. Rather, it is an expression of women?s sense of outrage and their efforts to break their silence and revolt against violence, torture and harassment. Comprising several short pieces depicting various forms of transgression, the mute charades represent a silent but strong, united rebellion by women. The programme also draws attention to an ironical truth: all women are victims of abuse, irrespective of their social, educational and economic backgrounds. Research and direction: Dr Subhra Sanyal.

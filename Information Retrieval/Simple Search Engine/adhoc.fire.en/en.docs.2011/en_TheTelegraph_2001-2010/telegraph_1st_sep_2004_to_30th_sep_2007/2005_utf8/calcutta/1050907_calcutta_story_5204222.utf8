The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Packages head for Salt Lake to skip rush

 - DURGA PUJA DARSHAN

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcuttans this year can look forward to guided tours of pujas on the outskirts and in traditional households, and can also view the immersion in the Hooghly from a launch.

 The initiative by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation is nothing new, except that prominent pujas in the heart of the city ? such as Mohammad Ali Park, College Street, Bosepukur, Maddox Square and Barisha ? will be given a miss this time.

 ?People prefer not to visit these pandals because of the heavy rush of revellers,? said corporation managing director Souren Bhattacharya. ?Visitors have to walk a long way and stand in a queue for at least two hours to reach the pandal.? 

 As an alternative, the corporation is focussing on the pujas in Salt Lake and Lake Town, apart from the family pujas that are being held for decades, or even centuries. 

 A series of packages have been planned and those availing of them will be taken to the venues in a luxury bus ? not air-conditioned, as passengers may like to keep the windows open to have a glimpse of the lighting ? on all Puja days. 

 The Salt Lake-Lake Town package will cost Rs 250 per head and will include a candlelight dinner at a restaurant in Sector V.

 ?A number of good pujas are held in Salt Lake and Lake Town. The lighting, pandals, idols and other arrangements at some of the pujas in Labony and in AG, FD, HB and GC blocks are praiseworthy. Many of them received awards. And as a bonus, the pujas don?t witness the maddening rush, like that of the Calcutta pandals,? managing director Bhattacharya said.

 The corporation is also in talks with some of the organisers to ensure that the visitors get an opportunity to see sandhyarati, dhakir naach and dhunuchi naach.

 The bus will leave from the Tourism Centre, in BBD Bag, at 5 pm and return around 11 pm.

 Another package ? which, too, will cost Rs 250 per head ? will take visitors to some of the old family pujas, like those of Sabarna Roy Choudhurys, Chhatubabu-Latubabu, Rani Rashmoni and the Dattas of Hathkhola.

 ?Apart from viewing the idols and the rituals, the visitors will also get bhog,? said a corporation official. The five-hour tour will start at 8.30 am.

 A third package, to cost Rs 350 per head, will enable visitors to witness Durga puja in the Hooghly. Two big launches will be tied and the puja ? complete with yagna, arati, bhog ? will be held on the upper deck. Those availing of the package will also enjoy a tour down the river. 

 The launches will set sail from Prinsep Ghat and move to Dakshineswar and Belur Math.

 The corporation is also organising a trip for witnessing immersions in the Hooghly from a launch. There will be two trips, in the morning and evening, on Dashami and the charge is Rs 170 per head for each trip.

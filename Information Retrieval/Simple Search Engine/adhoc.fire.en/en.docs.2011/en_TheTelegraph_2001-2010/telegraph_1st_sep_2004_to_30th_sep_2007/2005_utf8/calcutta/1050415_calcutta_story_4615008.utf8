 Rhythm and emotions

 Based on the principle of dance-theatre, Versedance represents a mode of creative expression that brings together literature, music, dance and painting to give birth to an abstract, independent genre of the performing arts. This evenings presentation of Versedance by Nuances reflects an innovative and aesthetically conceived attempt to liberate poetry and drama from the constraints of the text. Exploring through dance the theme of love and temporality in the sonnets of Shakespeare, it also celebrates the vibrant energy of Pablo Nerudas poem, Everyday you play. Subtly choreographed expressions help discover the essence of human solitude, a nostalgic longing for love and sad recollections of the past, in the verses and songs of Meena Kumari. The final piece, Outsider (performed by Prarthana Purkayastha; picture above), based on Euripides Medea, converts real-life movements into stylized dance sequences to reveal Medeas changing moods. Concept and direction: Jhuma Basak.

 Head start: A Mohun Bagan-East Bengal derby on the Maidan 

 The directive of Calcutta University (CU) to its affiliated colleges to increase their seat strength to cope with the rush for admission in various courses is most welcome (Seat-hike decree in first division rush, June 10). 

 It is reassuring that the approval for increased number of seats would be subject to the colleges having the required infrastructure. An increase in the number of seats should not come at the cost of quality education. 

 It would be a shame if all the students seeking admission to colleges to pursue higher education cannot be accommodated. Given that the percentage of success in the Higher Secondary examinations is increasing every year, arrangements should be made to accommodate more students in colleges. 

 Denial of seats to successful students would be a blow to the spread of higher education. These days, most employers prefer candidates with college and university degrees. So students willing to attend college and university must get an opportunity to do so. 

 Those students who fail to make the cut will become frustrated and may even get involved in antisocial activities later. Such youngsters may not hesitate even to take their own lives. 

 The infrastructure of the institutes of higher education needs to be revamped at the earliest to prevent waste of talent. 

 The state government, the colleges and the universities need to monitor the expansion of capacities carefully to maintain high standards. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Wanted, a few more heroes on the field?, June 9, there are many promising players in villages and small towns who are languishing due to lack of facilities there. Social security, proper training and food can work wonders for them. Among the multitudes, there is definitely a handful, talented enough to propel Indian football to the world stage. Industrial houses should lend a hand in the endeavour to find heroes on Indian football fields. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 It?s wonderful that companies are coming forward to sponsor Indian football clubs. Pony International is the latest addition to the list. If the trend continues, the club authorities would have more money to spend on the footballers. Naturally, youngsters would then be attracted to soccer and clubs will no longer have to depend on foreigners to win trophies. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 The headline of the article ?Rapist weds teen mother of his child?, June 8, was inappropriate. Social worker Rumki Chakraborty herself said that Tumpa ?came to me after being dumped by her lover, who refused to marry her even on hearing she was expecting?. Where does the question of rape arise? 

 Raffhat Mir,

 Mcleod Street. 

 Organising the marriage of a rapist and his victim was a commendable act on part of the NGOs. The organisations should continue to play such a positive role in the development of society. 

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park. 

 It is shocking that a businessman from Calcutta hired a contract killer to eliminate a tea-stall owner (Contract to kill plus trade hub realty bounty, June 9). The tycoon should be punished in an exemplary manner. I urge conscientious citizens of Calcutta to shun products manufactured by his company. 

 Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore. 

 Apropos the report ?English holds key to success rate?, June 9, it is heartening that students? performance in English in the HS examinations has improved remarkably over the past three years. I think the students had not done well earlier partly because their teachers are themselves victims of the faulty education policy in the state. Thankfully, English is no longer taught from Class V in schools. The practice has put students at a disadvantage while appearing for all-India entrance examinations. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos the report ?CPM seal for baton?, June 14, it is interesting that Anil Biswas did not approve of the agitation by fasting Jadavpur University students. It is another matter that he and his fellow comrades resorted to disruptive and violent student politics in the 1960s and 1970s to grab power. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge. 

 Being the former registrar of a government engineering college, I am sure that the impasse could have been avoided if the administrators handled the situation rationally. In the early Sixties, Pandit Nehru had shifted Triguna Sen from Jadavpur University to Benaras Hindu University, where student agitation had brought academic activities to a halt. Sen?s healing presence brought back normalcy to the campus in a matter of days. But now, Anil Biswas and his ilk want us to believe that ?there was no police excess?, when television visuals belie their claim. 

 Jatindra Nath Mitra, 

 Kalyani. 

 The convention against promoter raj in Rajarhat is nothing but a way to divert people?s attention from the misdeeds of the CPM-led Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipal board and the party cadre. Besides, it is the habit of the CPM to realise its mistakes after the damage has been done. Remedial measures, if taken, turn out to be a eyewash. 

 Madhabi D. Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report ?Rs 80,000 compensation for vision loss?, June 13, surgeon M.M. Patra has claimed that the injury to his patient?s eye was neither due to his ?ignorance? nor was it ?intentional?. If Patra is to be believed, then a reckless driver who runs over a pedestrian should also be pronounced innocent. 

 Kunal Saha,

 Ohio, USA.

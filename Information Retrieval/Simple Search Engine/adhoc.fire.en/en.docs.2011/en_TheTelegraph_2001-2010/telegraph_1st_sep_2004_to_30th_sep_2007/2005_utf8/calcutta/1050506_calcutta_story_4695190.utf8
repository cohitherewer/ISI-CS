 Post 9/11, British theatre directors are turning to pages from the past to portray the present. Leading the line-up is the Royal Shakespeare Company

 A performance of Measure for Measure at the Riverside Theatre

 Something extraordinary has been happening in British theatre since 9/11; it seems to have discovered a new sense of purpose. Its imaginative horizons have discernibly broadened as it has struggled to take in the enormity of that day. And what?s particularly striking is that theatre directors, rather than waiting for playwrights to lead the way, are boldly reclaiming texts from the past to talk about the present.

 The last few years have seen several noticeable instances: Nicholas Hytner?s gloss on Henry V, Katie Mitchell?s account of Iphigenia, Simon McBurney?s take on Measure for Measure were, to differing degrees, read as responses to the war in Iraq. 

 David Farr?s recently seen ? and greatly admired ? adaptation of The Odyssey at the Bristol Old Vic presented the wandering hero as a hapless asylum seeker. ?In the mid to late 1990s,? says Farr, ?the global situation seemed less volatile and a lot of the stories in our theatre became quite small. They were about private relationships or the problems of being young? What has happened since September 11 and the rise of Bush is that suddenly audiences and artistes have gravitated towards much bigger stories in order to make sense of the world.?

 William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson 

 Without 9/11, it?s doubtful whether the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) would have marked the 400th anniversary year of the Gunpowder Plot with quite such a dedicated season of lesser known ?Jacobethan? (Elizabethan meets Jacobean) plays in Stratford-upon-Avon this March. Since the attacks, however, and the revelation that Parliament was a favoured al Qaida target, it?s become easier to remember what was at stake when a group of Catholic conspirators wheeled 36 barrels of explosives beneath the Palace of Westminster and prepared to blast the recently installed James I to oblivion. 

 And the more you learn about the plays that RSC associate director Gregory Doran had chosen for the Gunpowder season, the more apparent it becomes that, far from being of fascination only to scholars, they?re capable of speaking, in an incendiary way, to our own age.

 Thomas More (1591), written primarily by Anthony Munday but with revisions by Shakespeare among others, features a riotous demonstration by Londoners against immigrants. A New Way to Please You (1618) by Middleton, Rowley and Massinger imagines a youth-obsessed society governed by a new stricture requiring all men over 80 and women over 60 to be put to death; in doing so, it shows how laws presented as being in the national interest can destroy individuals.

 Philip Massinger?s Believe What You Will (1631) tells of a Middle Eastern leader ? Antiochus of Carthage ? who, emerging from hiding to be with his people, is pursued by a Roman empire whose emissary warns the state that harbours him that it faces certain destruction. 

 Doran, who?s directing Ben Jonson?s notoriously dense, difficult tragedy Sejanus: His Fall (1603) ? set in the corruption-stewed court of Roman emperor Tiberius ? finds the parallels between then and now intriguing. 

 ?What happens around that potentially catastrophic event of the gunpowder plot is a sense of disintegration. That?s why these plays resonate today. The Jacobean period is the age in which things turned sour and that feeling of dislocation began to be expressed in the writing, through black comedy, through a very bleak, nihilistic view of the world and a need to elude censorship by reaching for metaphor.? 

 The RSC directors talk in similar terms about these forgotten ?classics? feeling like new plays. Robert Delamere, directing Thomas More, even argues that, for all the potentially ruinous risks of censorship that writers faced at the time, there was an outspokenness at work that today?s playwrights lack. ?In the 1990s, the tendency was for people to write plays across one social stratum only. Here you get all the classes, including the people, who are given a dignified voice, even if it may not be a voice you like.? 

 Should we be concerned that hand-me-down texts seem more relevant and up-to-the-minute than some of the plays being written now? Gregory Doran believes we can learn from the Jacobeans? anger and indignation: ?It?s useful to look at what they did, because once you get past the Restoration that anger disappears and theatre becomes a far cosier place.? 

 ?I think it?s exciting that we?ve returned to the idea of looking again at stories that already exist ? after all, it?s exactly what Shakespeare did. It?s not a passing fad, it?s a serious engagement with the past,? says David Farr.

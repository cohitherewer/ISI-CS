The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Barely two years since multiplex 

 culture hit Calcutta, life has changed. For the better, 

 say overjoyed yuppies, for the worse, insist those clinging 

 to the citys historic halls. 

 As business sense rules over nostalgia, 

 new-age comforts beat out old-world charm. Sangita Sultania 

 G. Roy straddles the two worlds ? one booming, the other 

 dying an assisted death ? of standalone theatres and multiplex 

 cinema.

 Time warp

 If you happened to witness the lightsaber duel in the Revenge of the Sith ensconced in the musty confines of New Empire, with scurrying rodents as company and a distant whiff of urine invading the protesting nostrils, there would have been no escaping the time warp.

 And the extra-terrestrial traffic in the skies of a galaxy (or two), far, far away couldnt seem more alien if you have just been lovingly nudged on both sides by a swerving taxi and a smoke-stack that resembles a bus. 

 On the other hand, you were probably grateful for the plush auditorium at INOX as Khedekar scrounged around as Bose in the dirty by-lanes of Peshawar.

 But the well-padded path is not without potholes of its own: here too an unpleasant odour may have put a perspective on reality. Contraptions that spit out cloying room freshener are unhappily placed overhead, and if you have lucked out with location, reconcile yourself to leaving smelling like a dying rose.

 Show navigation

 Some lost spaces are replaced, in spirit if not in form. If you used to plan your weekend schedule hopping around noon, matinee and evening shows in the New Market halls, a different film every hour at four auditoriums under one roof makes the leisurely life even easier.

 Price peeve

 Free will is an illusion, we have rapidly found out. Specially when it comes to choosing to hold on to hard-earned cash.

 Even the most enthusiastic convert of the cineplex craze will crib about wallet woes. With the few remaining standalone theatres choosing to play it safe with the Bollywood bonanza, there is little choice but to head for a pricey destination.

 As we start to take the cool new environs for granted, yesteryears hardships acquire nostalgic, often romantic overtones. Dirty loos? Watery cola? Cheap patties? Leering looks? 

 l forgotten with the ever-dimming memory of once regal interiors that could be had for under Rs 50. The simple math makes money talk for many.

 And being frisked on entry after emptying your pockets is simply adding insult to injury.

 Munch mores

 Before you put your monthly budget on the backburner, factor in the munch mix, which could quickly put you in the red. 

 True, the fancy snacks are a welcome relief after years of stale fare which the permanent residents of the grand old halls (the cat-sized rodents, of course) probably had a lick at when no one was looking.

 But when your wallet gets thinner ? and your waistline thicker ? plain popcorn seems as scrumptious as the caramel variety.

 The curtains go up at one of your 

 old haunts, and a dim image flickers on screen as the sound 

 fades out, earning the hoots of fellow viewers. The seat 

 you are sitting in creaks its way a few inches closer to 

 death, you know its not long before the lights go 

 out here, forever.

 Pause a while, shed a tear or 

 two?Then look ahead to next weekend, when you will break 

 the bank to watch Batman Begins in seats more comfy 

 than the sofa at home, whether you like it or not. Chances 

 are, like it you will.

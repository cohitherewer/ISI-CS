 Traditional materials and techniques, rooted in the climate and landscape of Japan, have been used by skilled artisans to create objects of daily utility, as also art works, richly imbued with the creativity of craft artists. The mutual influence of artisans and artists has, furthermore, contributed to the depth and high quality of Japanese crafts. Hosted by the Consulate-General of Japan, Calcutta, in cooperation with the Indo-Japan Welfare and Cultural Association, Handcrafted Form: Traditions and Techniques, the ongoing exhibition of Japanese handicrafts and art works, showcases these two groups of craft items as a testimony to the multiplicity and richness of Japanese crafts. On display are wood and bamboo crafts, glassware, metalwork, writing implements, and so on, hand-made with traditional materials, using traditional techniques. Representative objects, designated as ?Traditional Craft Objects? under the Japanese government?s Traditional Manufactured Goods Law, form the core of the exhibition, supplemented by works of craft artists.

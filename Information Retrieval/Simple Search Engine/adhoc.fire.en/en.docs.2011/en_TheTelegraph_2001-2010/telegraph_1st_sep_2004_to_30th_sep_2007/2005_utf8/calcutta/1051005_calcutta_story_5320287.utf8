 A cry for custody

 - One cherished, one abandoned: Babies in distress

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 In an abandoned newborn, a couple found its daughter who had died of cancer last year. 

 The couple wanted to adopt the child and was granted temporary custody. A year-and-a-half later, prodded by police to approach court for permanent custody, the couple is afraid it may lose its daughter for the second time.

 Income-tax lawyer Aloke Chatterjee and wife Malati came to the high court on Tuesday with 18-month-old Ayashi, as the foster parents have named her, to seek permanent custody.

 ?My clients cannot live even a day without Ayashi. Their plea will be heard on Wednesday,? said Subroto Mookherjee, Chatterjees? counsel.

 In May 2004, members of Baidyabati Sporting Club found a newborn in a vat. The youths handed the baby over to police. But they soon learnt about the fate of the Chatterjees, residents of the same locality, who had lost their only daughter three months earlier after spending more than Rs 3 lakh on her treatment at a Mumbai cancer hospital.

 ?The club members approached us to adopt the child. We moved the court of the Serampore sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) and pleaded that we could afford to bring up the child,? said Alok.

 The SDJM asked police to make an inquiry about the petitioners. After a favourable report from the cops, the magistrate in May last year had allowed the couple temporary custody of the child. 

 ?Since then, she has been with us,? Alok pointed out.

 The Chatterjees, however, felt jittery after a recent note from police asked them to seek permanent custody of the child from court. They approached the district judge, who asked them to move the Juvenile Justice Board.

 ?The board will first issue an order that the child be kept in a home till the petition is disposed of. But the Chatterjees cannot live without Ayashi even for a day. So, they approached the high court,? said counsel Mookherjee.

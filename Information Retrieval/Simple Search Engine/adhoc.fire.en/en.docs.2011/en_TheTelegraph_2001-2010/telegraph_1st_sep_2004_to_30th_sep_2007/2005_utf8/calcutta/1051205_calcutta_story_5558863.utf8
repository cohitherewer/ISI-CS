The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hotel hunt for student

 A STAFF REPORTER

 MISSING: Nilanjan Sarkar

 The family of missing management student Nilanjan Sarkar, 23, who disappeared mysteriously from his Salt Lake home on Friday afternoon, searched various hotels in the city on Sunday but failed to trace him.

 His family and friends are perplexed, for there was no apparent reason for his disappearance. Nilanjan, who hails from Durgapur, is a second-year student of a management institute in Salt Lake. 

 His father, Kalyan Sarkar, who arrived in Calcutta from Durgapur in search of his son, along with Nilanjan?s room and classmate Anirbun Dutta, on Sunday, searched various hotels in the Howrah station area but only in vain.

 ?Police told us to do so. We have inquired with almost all the hotels in the Howrah station area throughout the day,? said Sarkar, a retired bank employee.

 ?Most of the hotels told us that they don?t allow anyone to check in without valid identity papers. Besides, if my son had willingly disappeared, he wouldn?t reveal his true identity,? said the tired and devastated man.

 Police, too, appeared clueless about the disappearance. ?The boy used to take small loans from his friends. Maybe, he tried to repay them and asked for money from his relatives. Unable to face denial, he left in dejection,? said a senior police officer of Salt Lake.

 Meenakshi, the student?s elder sister, said her brother had asked for Rs 5,000 from her on Wednesday but she refused him. ?I didn?t have that much cash at that time. He used to ask for money from me frequently,? Meenakshi said over the telephone from Durgapur. 

 Anirbun, a childhood friend of Nilanjan?s, said the missing man may have tried to sell off his mobile phone for cash.

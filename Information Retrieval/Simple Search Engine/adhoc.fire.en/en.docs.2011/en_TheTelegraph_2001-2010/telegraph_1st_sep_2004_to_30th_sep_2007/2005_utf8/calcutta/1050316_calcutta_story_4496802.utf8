 Fair focus on health

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry is organising the second Health and Well-Being Show at Oberoi Grand from Friday in an effort to promote awareness among the masses.

 ?We are emphasising on wellbeing during the Health and Well-Being Show 2005 because health has an association with diseases. We want to help people take quick decisions in an emergency. The show will provide a platform for exchange of views between policy-makers, service providers and consumers,? said Aniruddha Lahiri, president of the chamber.

 Encouraged by the success of its first show, the chamber has invited major players in the health sector from other parts of the country to this year?s show.

 ?Only state hospitals participated in the show last year. This time, we have invited medical institutions and doctors from all over the country,? said health show sub-committee chairman Amit Ghosh on Tuesday.

 ?Bengal was a destination for people of other states in matters of healthcare. Our idea is to help the state reclaim lost glory,? he added.

 A number of health camps, including an eye camp, cardiac camp, cancer camp and a diabetes camp, will be organised during the three-day fair.

 Seminars on patent rights, privatisation of medical education, health insurance and other topics, and discussions on health issues will also be held during the fair.

 Ghosh said a super-speciality hospital, with 10 per cent of the beds reserved for the poor, will soon be set up in the city.

 He added that construction would begin as soon as land is allotted for the hospital.

 Toy story gets a robotic boost

 Star Wars beloved and brilliant robot R2D2 may be out of reach of existing technology, but an R2 (of sorts), is now available in Calcutta.

 Robosapien Robot can jive to foot-tapping numbers, whistle at passing girls and burp after a filling meal. He could also be of some use, picking up a hanky or pushing around small boxes.

 Well, he might not save the world, but its a start.

 The one-and-half-ft-tall creation of stainless steel and rubber has been designed by Mark Tilden, who is considered to be the father of bio-morphic robotics and used to work with leading agencies including NASA.

 This little fellow is not meant to be put to work, however. It is a toy aimed at children aged between eight and 14 years, which can perform 84 different functions in four modes, including retrieving a ball, dancing and pushing a toy box from room to room.

 Such simple pleasures come at a price. Robosapien Robot would set you back by Rs 5,995 and is available at Crossword on Elgin Road.

 The USP, apparently, is its easy handling. Unlike other robotic toys, which can require elaborate feedback systems and numerous control buttons, Robosapien can be controlled completely with the help of a remote control, making him (or her) child-friendly.

 The problem with other technology-driven toys or robots in the market is that the control operations are complex. There are a lot of buttons which end up confusing the kids instead of entertaining them, says Sidharth Pansari, director, Pansari Group, franchisee of Crossword in Calcutta. 

 The gadget is geared up with an artificial neural system and built on principals of the nervous system for motion detection, obstacle avoidance, pattern recognition, speech printing and fluid biomechanics.

 It is fitted with sensors all over the body with an infrared receiver on its head where the remote ? with 67 easy command functions ? has to be directed in order to make it execute an action. The sonic sensor is on its chest, and enables the toy to respond to sounds after it is programmed.

 The hi-tech companion comes in two colour combinations ? white and black and metallic and black.

 The Robosapien was one of the most popular toys abroad in the year 2004. It won top ratings from the Canadian Toy Testing Council, the Toy of Tomorrow award in the UK, the Hong Kong Award for Industry in 2004 and the toy of the year award from Australia Toy and Hobby Retailer, informs Pansari.

 Robosapien has been attracting attention at other Crossword outlets across the country. In Calcutta too, hopes Pansari, the robot will charm kids in a growing toy market.

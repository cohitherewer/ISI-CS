Feast of fan films 

What?s common between A New Dope, Lord of the Hula 

Hoops: Fellowship of the Hoola Hoop and Matrix Unloaded? They are fanfilms 

made of Hollywood blockbusters like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and The 

Matrix.

Fan films are tributes, spoofs and alternate versions 

of popular movies and television serials made by the fans, usually short and low-budget 

movies. Over the past few years, thanks largely to the Internet, fan films have 

been made on almost all popular movies, some of them even winning awards.

Check out www.fanfilms.net which has over 450 

short films, ranging from Pulp Fiction to Run Lola Run, Mission Impossible 

to Jaws. Some of the more popular categories here are Star Wars 

(131 films), Doctor Who (92), Star Trek (37), Batman (30) 

and Halloween (19). 

The comics-to-screen titles are particularly favoured, 

with everything from X-Men to Superman, Spiderman to Batman 

(picture above) featured.

 Bollywood beauties might be adding 

 oomph to quite a few international dos of late, but it was 

 the Tolly brigade that rocked the dance floor at Dublin 

 on Friday night. While the duo of Twinkle and Rinke Khanna 

 chose to give the dance floor a miss, it was the Bengali 

 babes ? Rachana Banerjee, Koneenica Banerjee and Pallavi 

 Chatterjee ? who put on their dancing shoes and grooved 

 well past midnight at the ITC Sonar Bangla disc.

 The party, hosted by Movado, celebrated 

 the launch of the Swiss watch majors latest collection 

 in the city. Brand ambassador Twinkle made a brief appearance 

 with sister Rinke in tow. The duo posed for the shutterbugs 

 for a few moments before retiring for the night. It 

 has been a tiring day at work. Need to hit the sack, 

 smiled Twinkle, before slipping out of the nightclub. 

 The Tollywood trio, with actors 

 Abhishek Chatterjee and Kaushik for company, kept the floor 

 rocking, dancing to the beats of DJ Harishs Dhol 

 vajda, Woh lamhe and Turn me on.

 Thai treat

 Cloud 9, the resto-bar at Astor, 

 was the venue for a bash with a difference on Friday night. 

 The regular revelry on the dance floor was done away with, 

 in favour of a sober cocktail party announcing the launch 

 of a Thai food promotion by the hotel.

 The festival, which will be on 

 till June 24, was inaugurated by Thai consul general Wanna 

 Pergmark. The guests munched on Thai delicacies and sipped 

 on cocktails, even as light Thai music played in the background.

 Thai food has really come 

 a long way and is now quite popular in Calcutta. Not only 

 is the cuisine very palatable, Thai food is very healthy 

 as well, said Pergmark.

 The festive fare has been dished 

 out by chef Yong Yos, who has been flown down from Hotel 

 Shangrila in Bangkok. The sumptuous spread includes delicacies 

 like Thung Thong, Satay kai, Pla Laad Prik, Kai Phad Krapraw 

 and Haed Phad Krapraw. The buffet is priced at Rs 500 per 

 couple and the a la carte price pinch is around Rs 700 per 

 couple.

 Bday bonanza

 Its carnival time at City 

 Centre with every other store at the shopping destination 

 hosting a bash to celebrate its first birthday.

 The last in the series of birthday 

 parties was held by INOX, which wrapped up the week-long 

 celebration in real style. With movie buffs, loyalists and 

 a large band of city musicians on the guest list, the party 

 was a befitting end to the revelry.

 Those who had expected to see 

 the pretty pair of Vidya Balan and Raima Sen, who graced 

 the venue for a press briefing of their film Parineeta, 

 went back disappointed as both the ladies gave the party 

 a miss. 

 But the absence of the glamour 

 quotient nothwithstanding, there were enough trappings for 

 the crowd to party hard.

 The ground floor lobby of the 

 multiplex was converted into the party zone with the snack 

 and cold drink counters doubling up as the bar. Music by 

 DJ Dipee added flavour to fun as INOX City Centre turned 

 a year old.

 Summer show

 With the monsoons still a no-show, 

 the fashion scene in the city is still stuck on summer. 

 Sparkz, the sports leisure centre 

 in Alipore, for instance, hosted a multi-label fashion show 

 for summer 2005 on Saturday evening. 

 The collections showcased were 

 no different from the run-of-the-mill stuff one gets to 

 see at every other show, but it was the ramp that added 

 an extra edge to the affair. The bowling alley at the sports 

 centre doubled up as the ramp for city catwalkers to parade 

 on.

 A host of budding designers showcased 

 their summer lines and their enthusiasm made up for some 

 serious design flaws. 

 The clothes were sashayed on 

 the ramp by models Shrestha, Jessica, Ishika, Tina and Kim 

 among others.

 We provide multiple entertainment 

 options under one roof. Since we havent done too much 

 with fashion in the past, we decided to host this show, 

 revealed a spokesperson for the club.

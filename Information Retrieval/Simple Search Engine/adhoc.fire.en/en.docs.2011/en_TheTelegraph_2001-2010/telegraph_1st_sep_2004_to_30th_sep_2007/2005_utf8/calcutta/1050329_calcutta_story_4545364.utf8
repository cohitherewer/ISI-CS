 Meet call on Eden

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A senior army officer on Monday invited officials of the state forest department for a meeting at Fort William on Tuesday to resolve the impasse over the Eden Gardens.

 The park has been lying closed since last Tuesday. 

 The forest department issued a closure notice following objections by the army over collection of an entry fee from visitors, including morning walkers.

 The Rs-2 entry fee was introduced by the forest department in November. It had decided to utilise the money collected for the development of the gardens.

 Senior army officers visited the Eden Gardens on March 21 and asked the officials not to collect an entry fee from the visitors. The army also pulled down a cafeteria constructed by the department inside the gardens.

 Forest minister Jogesh Burman was upset about the closure of the garden.

 A senior official said on Monday that the government was waiting for the outcome of Tuesday?s meeting and would take up the issue with the Central government if it remained inconclusive.

 Minister Burman said: ?Let me see what happens on Tuesday. The government will decide on the next step after the meeting.?

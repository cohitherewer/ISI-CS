 About 750 employees of Indian Oil spent a nervous Monday afternoon after an unidentified man told a senior manager over the telephone that three bombs were ticking away in the nine-storeyed Dhakuria office. 

 The call came around 1.20 pm. The caller further said the building should be evacuated within 10 minutes.

 Chief safety and environment protection officer Sankha Dutta, who took the call, immediately sounded a warning on all the floors through an internal address system. The staff was asked to immediately vacate the building. 

 ?We had to get out of the office fast, since the caller had claimed the bombs would be detonated with the help of a remote-control device within the next 10 minutes. He said he had specific information and urged me not to question the authenticity of his claim,? recollected Dutta.

 While those on the first few floors scrambled down the staircase, others took the lifts. All the exits were opened and the two emergency lifts were also operated. The security personnel were asked to ensure that no one sneaked in from outside. The entrances and the basement garage were sealed.

 One of the senior officers informed Lake police station. The Lalbazar Control Room was also notified. Four officers of the Bomb Disposal Squad of Calcutta Police arrived first, followed by another team with sniffer dogs.

 Each floor was scanned for explosives, but in vain. About three hours later, around 4.40 pm, the bomb disposal squad finally declared there were no bombs inside. 

 This is the third time in the past few years that a false bomb alarm has hampered the day?s work at the Indian Oil office in Dhakuria. It houses the marketing divisions of the eastern India division of the company. The Assam Oil Division and the Refinery Division also operate out of the building.

 The employees went home within half-an-hour of the premises being declared explosive-free. Several rued the waste of time. 

 ?While we are still not sure who made the call, it appears that he was aware of the designations of our officers. Why else would he want to speak to the chief safety officer? The direct number of the officer in charge of security would not be readily available to an outsider,? stated Subrato Ghosh, deputy general manager (finance) of Indian Oil. 

 While most senior officers of the company have caller line identification devices installed, Dutta?s phone did not have the gadget.

 Police suspect the caller knew this and deliberately called him up to avoid detection within the next few hours.

 Black Velvet grass from Bermuda to dress up the greens, ride-on fairway mowers from Toro in Minnesota, better tees and bunkers, and a smoother flow pattern. 

 Not to mention a ?world-class country club? with health spa, luxury rooms, fine dining and the city?s largest swimming pool.

 Having celebrated its 175th anniversary last year in style, Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), the oldest outside the British Isles, now has a focussed goal ? to be the country?s ?best golf facility? by 2008.

 While the 7,000-yard Royal course, with its classic British layout, is one of the best-designed in the continent, efforts are on to raise the degree of difficulty for superior players by strategically creating hazards and slightly altering configurations.

 ?We don?t have land to increase the length of the course. So, we have undertaken a programme to re-lay it with the objective of making it more challenging for the national-level pro and also easier for the club golfer. We want to catch the big guys,? says immediate past captain Ashit Luthra.

 Golf course architect Ranjit Nanda, who has worked with golf great Arnold Palmer on the DLF Golf amp; Country Club course in Gurgaon, is piloting the re-laying at the Royal, and plans to use Black Velvet 1 and 3-type grass, used in the best tropical courses around the world. 

 The species are now being grown experimentally on campus.?The quality of maintenance must match the quality of grass and equipment, and we are working towards that,? says Nanda.

 ?With better-trained staff and an improved drainage system, RCGC will be on a par with the best in the business,? he adds.

 The club is also importing latest equipment from the US, including green polishers and fairway and green dressers.

 To complement the spruced-up course, the management is planning to create a composite country club and leisure resort facility, complete with a state-of-the-art gym, spa, beauty salon, tennis courts, yoga and massage centre and well-appointed guestrooms.

 Poised to come up over a two-acre plot next to the popular Tenth Shamiana, the complex is being designed by Bhubaneswar-based architect Rajen Saklani, the man behind the Mayfair chain of hotels.

 ?Everything will be benchmarked against international standards of excellence and we want the resurgent Royal to showcase a resurgent Bengal,? says CEO M.M. Singh.

 Royal, meanwhile, has introduced an annual corporate membership for Rs 25,000, reveals golf convener Satbinder Singh.

 ?According to the 2001 census, more than 6.4 million girls in India are married before the age of 18 and nearly half of all married women aged 15 to 19 already have one child,? asserted Sayan Ghosh, programme officer of CINI-ARC, (the Child in Need Institute Adolescent Resource Centre). But the fact that hundreds of young volunteers were working in remote villages all over India to beat this trend certainly seems encouraging.

 Some 114 peer educators (aged 14 to 21) gathered at Sarat Sadan, Howrah (November 18-20), to express their views on the need to prevent early marriage and early pregnancy through skits, hand-shadow play, cartoons, mime and puppet shows. On November 20, they also presented an action plan advocating sensitisation of parents, teachers and policymakers and the introduction of life skill education for student awareness.

 The CINI-ARC regional convention was held in coordination with MAMTA Institute of Mother and Child, New Delhi and NGO SRIJAN (Sexual Reproductive Rights Initiative for Joint Action Network). It was a meeting of peer educators, government and non-government officials from West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand. 

 Sports icon Bhaichung Bhutia and cricketer Rohan Gavaskar were present to encourage the young workers, as was former footballer and coach P.K. Banerjee.

 Ghosh is optimistic about the results of the CINI project. ?It has been found that even if child marriages are not always stoppable, more people are willing to postpone parenthood. Surveys last year found the average age for girls married in West Bengal was 16-15.9 years. This year it is 18.8 years. The rise in the demand for condoms and the fall in reported cases of sexually-transmitted diseases are positive signs.? 

 Another regional convention was held on similar lines in Gujarat. ?We will compile all the proposals and perhaps arrange a national convention where the workers could face the decision makers and stakeholders from the national level,? said Ghosh.

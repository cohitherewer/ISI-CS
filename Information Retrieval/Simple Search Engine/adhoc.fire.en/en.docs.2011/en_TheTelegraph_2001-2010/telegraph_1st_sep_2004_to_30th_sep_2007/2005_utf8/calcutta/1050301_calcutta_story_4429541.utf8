The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clout of colleges under university scanner

 - Syndicate 

in huddle over dismissal rerun of nominee

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 At a time when the government is considering granting more autonomy to colleges, Calcutta University ? stung by the ?highhanded attitude? of some of its affiliated colleges ? has been examining the limits of power enjoyed by the governing bodies of the undergraduate institutions.

 The university?s legal department is not only reviewing the powers of the affiliated colleges, but also finalising the course of action if any college goes beyond its brief. 

 Based on the observations of the legal department, the Syndicate will discuss the matter again on Tuesday.

 The move follows objections by a section of senior teachers and members of the Syndicate against the decision of the governing body of Jogamaya Devi College to dismiss the university?s representative on the panel. The Syndicate members have dubbed the dismissal ?illegal?. 

 The college, according to them, does not have the authority to sack the university?s representative in this way. 

 ?Our law officer is examining the powers of the governing bodies of the 160-odd colleges. Appropriate action will be taken if we find Jogamaya Devi College has violated the rules,? said Suranjan Das, Calcutta University pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs). 

 The representative, Chandranath Roy (a senior teacher), was dismissed reportedly because he had not attended the meetings of the governing body for a long time.

 The governing bodies of all colleges have a representative of the university. ?How can a college dismiss a member who has been nominated by the university?? asked a senior teacher.

 ?This is not the first time that the governing body of a college has acted in this way. We have to deal with the matter firmly,? said Shyamapada Pal, a Syndicate member.

 Recently, the governing body of Vidyasagar College for Women had dismissed university representative Harit Bhattacharya for a similar reason. 

 ?The incident was raised at the Syndicate meeting and the head of the institution was castigated,? Pal said.

 The recurrence of the incident at Jogamaya Devi College has prompted the university to take a tough stand on the issue, officials said. 

 ?The college authorities informed us about the decision after issuing the dismissal letter to Chandranath Roy. They should have sought the university?s opinion before issuing the letter,? Syndicate member Pal told Metro. 

 According to him, an investigation has revealed that the university?s statutes are not clear on whether the governing body of a college can dismiss the university-nominated representative. 

 But, officials said, records show that colleges had been punished whenever they had executed an order bypassing the university.

 When contacted, members of the governing body of Jogamaya Devi College refused comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Console charisma

 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Whether its DJs, bouncers 

 or club managers, the fairer sex is slowly gaining a foothold 

 in the Calcutta party scene. Starting today, Goodlife 

 takes a look at women who run the show at nightclubs.

 Who: DJ Pre-Anjuna. The 

 only resident woman DJ in Calcuttas night-club circuit.

 Where: You can find this 

 pretty young, rocking thing spinning music at B.E.D, the 

 new multi-entertainment stop on Ballygunge Circular Road.

 How: A student of classical 

 music, Priyanjana (thats her real name) got hooked 

 to the idea of the DJ biz after she sneaked out of home 

 to catch a competition among city DJs.

 I was so excited to see 

 people react to DJs positively, I wanted to be one of them, 

 she recalls. Soon, she was learning to use the equipment. 

 A stint with DJ Lloyd at his DJ training school landed her 

 a traineeship in Tantra two years ago. I have learnt 

 from everyone, including colleagues and seniors, she 

 admits.

 Music mantra: Music 

 is my religion and I am the priest, the party people are 

 the disciples, thats the way I see my profession, 

 says the 20-year-old, who is also studying commerce in Bhawanipur 

 Education Society. She plays it all ? hip-hop to techno 

 to commercial ? and enjoys every genre.

 Toughest task: For 

 any DJ, the biggest challenge is to play the music the crowd 

 wants to hear. However, for a woman on the job, there is 

 more to handle, reveals Pre-anjuna. Unwanted advances 

 from guys on the floor who want to get to know her ? and 

 then some ? are common.

 There is feminine jealousy to 

 handle as well, when some women get peeved if their dates 

 are a little too appreciative about the babe at the console. 

 They just try to act rude with me, but I take it in 

 my stride, she shrugs.

 Next track: This obviously 

 is just the beginning and the future includes making much 

 more music and hopefully, cutting an album, too. But all 

 in good time.

This women?s wear store may have opened only six months 

ago, but it?s already making a style statement. Earth Indiawear now has a new 

range of clothes just for today?s working woman.

 The entrepreneur duo of Vineeta and Manav Gupta, which runs the store at 1B Elgin Road, has been in the business of accessories for over three years. 

 The Guptas have diversified with elan. The result is a range of vibrant cotton ethnic uppers and chiffon dupattas. 

 In a range of earth colours ? from fiery red to bright yellow and olive green ? the kurtas and kurtis of the newly-launched workwear range, Work it Out, have been embellished with contrasting patches near the neckline, collar and cuff. This lends a smart and non-fussy character to the garment and makes it distinct from the sequinned look on the one hand and the vegetable dye-printed style on the other. The garments are priced between Rs 350 and Rs 550. 

Colour coded 

 Using the simple techniques of hand painting and patchwork, self-taught designer Joyita Mukherjee is doing well in her Dover Place neighbourhood. Her cosy boutique Gharoya, housed in her home, stocks a host of ethnic Indian clothes, from sari to salwar kurta. A free-flowing brush, patchwork and glasswork from Gujarat and Rajasthan are all that?s required to do up a typical creation. 

 ?I like to work with all kinds of fabrics, from silks and georgette to cotton and crepe,? says the lady who recently showcased her clothes at a fashion show in Prince of Cal. 

 Flower fusion

 If tantric symbols, floral and geometric patterns excite you, then designer Shampa Mukherjee has something just right in her latest collection, Moksha. 

 Comprising elegant saris and salwar suits in a variety of fabrics, colours and styles, the collection aims to ?break away from the border-pallu rigidity and have fun with various arrangements?. 

 Experimenting with colours and patterns is Shampa?s forte. This range has a profusion of batik and hand painting. The designer has also tried ?fusion techniques?, using batik with tie-and-dye, kantha and sequinned work.

 Blending colours of the sun, sand, mist, oceanic blues, autumnal rusts and wintry whites, Shampa designs mostly on crepes, silks, tussars, mulmuls, kotas and handlooms. 

 Terracotta pendants using the same colours and designs as the garments help complete the look. 

 Catch the collection at studio Artisana (Chowringhee Terrace) on Saturday.

 Khadi weaves 

 Khadi Walk, an exhibition honouring the traditional handloom skills of weavers, will end at Weavers Studio on Saturday. It showcased Mahatma Gandhi?s experimental use of khadi, the ?sacred cloth?.

 Khadi as a material has several benefits ? comfortable, porous, cool and absorbent ? and is best suited for the Indian summer. 

 Apart from the exhibition, the studio is also screening films and giving audio-visual presentations on textiles, helpful for students of fashion design. Among those exhibiting their handlooms is Jagadda Rajappa, who has been providing the women weavers of Srikakulum, Andhra Pradesh, with a commercial outlet. 

 The yarn is handspun, supplying a means of additional income for women spinners of the region. 

 Two types of creations in this collection are Jamdani (a specialised skill using pit looms where muga silk from Assam is used for the border) and the Dastkar, natural-dyed handwoven khadi yarns. 

 Creative Bee, a design studio from Andhra Pradesh, is also displaying its creations. The range of items here includes handlooms, tussars and blended fabrics. The saris, dupattas, bed linen and even furnishing fabrics ? all in cotton and cotton blended ? are worth a look. Kamayani Jalan?s contemporary collection of khadi outfits are colourful and carefully textured. The kotpad (Orissa tribal woven khadi) saris and dupattas have been crafted from organic cotton fabrics, in different styles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lax defence earns a rap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rajnis Patel: The case drags on...

 The Alipore court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Manjit Singh on Thursday came down heavily on the defence lawyers in the Rajnis Patel case for delaying the process by filing petitions for adjournment.

 Chastising the defence for making a mockery of the judicial institution, SDJM Singh ordered it to maintain the discipline of the court, before adjourning the hearing till next Friday.

 Defence counsel Amitabha Ganguly was supposed to cross-examine Munni Devi, Rajnis? mother, on Friday. 

 However, he was out of station, and as such, a petition was filed for adjournment of the hearing at about 12.30 pm.

 When Ganguly failed to show up, public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh prayed that the witness be discharged. He argued that Munni Devi was being harassed by the defence advocate and was being compelled to appear before the court day after day. 

 The court then told the defence that it should have filed the petition at 10.30 am and not wasted the court?s time, since it knew that Ganguly was not in town. 

 Magistrate Singh further pointed out that five or six other cases had been adjourned in order to accommodate this one, so the defence should stop stalling the procedure.

 Orthopaedic surgeon Dilip Majumdar, responsible for 17-year-old Rajnis? treatment at SSKM Hospital and a prime accused in the case, was also absent from court. His advocate, Dipit Basu, said Majumdar had filed a petition in this regard. Basu prayed that the cross-examination of Majumdar be deferred.

 ?The court also directed the advocate representing Souvik Bardhan, one of the five accused, to take up the cross-examination of the witness on the next scheduled date,? public prosecutor Ghosh told Metro later. 

 Munni Devi?s cross-examination had started on January 11, with hearings subsequently slated on four consecutive days. Usually, once the prosecution witnesses are discharged, they need not be present in court for every hearing.

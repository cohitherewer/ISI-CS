The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Copier sans the risk of leak

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Speed, economy, quality and above all confidentiality. That?s the promise from the makers of ?the smartest digital duplicator ever?, launched in the city on Wednesday.

 The Riso RZ series of digital duplicators ? according to the claims of manufacturer Riso and Indian distributor Kores ? can play a role in eliminating examination paper leaks and preserving sensitive government information.

 ?The advantage of these machines is that they allow educational institutes, companies and even government offices to do print jobs in-house, and thereby have complete control over their confidential content,? explained Sanjeev Madan, country head, Riso.

 Since the devices are computer attachable, they can even be linked over the Internet and print jobs can be done simultaneously at different spots across the country.

 ?Compared to conventional photocopy machines, digital duplicators offer much more,? claimed Abheejoy Bakshi of Kores India. ?They can work with paper ranging from 46 to 210 g per square metre (gsm), while photocopiers have a range of 80-100 gsm. The cost of printing each page can be as low as six paisa.?

 There is innovation in the ink, too. The Riso series uses a proprietary ink developed by the company, in a cartridge that has a radio frequency tag on it. 

 The tag enables the cartridge to sense the conditions of the duplicator and work in tandem to provide the best results.

 The eight models in the RZ series are priced between Rs 1.4 and Rs 7 lakh, with a national sales target of over 200 units in the first year.

 ?Riso has a world-wide market share of 64 per cent in digital duplicators,? said Madan. Though the segment is small in India, the annual growth is high at 35 per cent.

 Riso is based in Japan with a presence in India since 1997.

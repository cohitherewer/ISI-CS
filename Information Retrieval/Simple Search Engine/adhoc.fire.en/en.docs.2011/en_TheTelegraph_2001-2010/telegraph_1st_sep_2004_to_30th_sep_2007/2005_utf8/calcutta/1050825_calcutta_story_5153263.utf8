 Figures spur dengue fear

 - Drive to target construction sites as toll shoots to nine

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 

 Calcutta appears to be headed for an outbreak of dengue, civic officers warned on Wednesday night, quoting the latest findings of serological tests carried out by experts over the past two days.

 ?Going by signs, the outbreak is going to be on a scale larger than the one witnessed in 1990,? said the officers. ?Already, nine people have died. The death toll in dengue 15 years ago was 12.? 

 Alarmed at the findings of tests carried out by experts from the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) at Masjidbari, in Tollygunge, the civic authorities held an emergency meeting late on Wednesday and decided to launch an anti-dengue drive in different parts of the city from Thursday. 

 ?NICED told us that almost all the 47 blood samples collected from Tollygunge tested positive. The situation was equally bad in neighbourhoods like Sealdah, Bagbazar, Shyambazar, Tiljala, Topsia and Kasba,? the officers said.

 Late on Wednesday, municipal commissioner Debashis Som reviewed the situation at a meeting with senior officers at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters. 

 There were indications that the drive would not be entrusted with the civic health department alone, because of its tardy response to early warnings of the outbreak. 

 ?From eight o?clock tomorrow, teams of civic medical staff, led by administrative service officers, will fan out across the city to carry out the drive. Construction sites will be our main targets. Work will be stopped at any site where measures against mosquito breeding have not been taken,? an official said.

 These measures follow the government?s review of the situation in the afternoon, when health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra admitted ? after playing down the toll for the past few days ? that nine, and not four, as claimed earlier, people had died and nearly 80-odd were down with the virus. 

 Mishra said of the nine, at least three persons had died of haemorrhagic dengue, while dengue fever claimed the lives of the rest.

 It was decided that NICED officers, the CMC and the health department will coordinate every action to be taken to control the outbreak.

 The School of Tropical Medicine has alerted the civic health department about the long lifespan of the dengue-causing mosquito. According to experts, a malaria-causing mosquito lives up to 20 days, whereas an Ades mosquito, that spreads dengue, can live up to 116 days. An Ades mosquito has even been recorded to have survived for 225 days.

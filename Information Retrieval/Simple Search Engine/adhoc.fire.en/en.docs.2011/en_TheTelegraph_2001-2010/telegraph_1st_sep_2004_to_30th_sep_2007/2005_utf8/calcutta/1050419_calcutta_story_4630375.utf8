 Glass gauge for guzzlers

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 If your buddies have a tendency to get carried away during cocktail parties, give them a measure-to-measure account of their behaviour. 

 And all in good faith, because you don?t have to do it in so many words. Trust a Peg Measure glass to get the message across.

 The light grey frosted tubular glasses carry mock peg markings along with fun doodles. Teetotallers at zero peg are considered to be rabbits. When the ladder goes up to read one, it?s considered ladylike behaviour. 

 You are still a gentleman if you stick to two. But at three pegs you become a pig. Worse still, at four you are a jackass braying ?Hic Haw?!

 What

Peg measure glass with fun markings

 Where

Giggles on Park Street

 How much

Rs 35 each

The grey and pink caricatures of creatures at various 

levels of intoxication is marked by a ladder and point system embossed on the 

glass. The fun cartoons and the understated, elegant colour combination lend it 

a funky, deglamourised look, apt for an informal bash. 

 The glasses by themselves are quite small though, holding only about half a peg. If you want to improvise upon the idea, get bigger plain frosted glasses, some glass paints, and get cracking. Just an idea, but the do-it-yourself spirit can help you personalise each glass to match the mood of the moment.

 Need tips to turn your ordinary self into a head turner? Or perhaps youd prefer a glimpse into the world of fashion and the history behind some of the biggest labels.

 Tune into Discovery Travel amp; Living for all this and more. The niche lifestyle channel unveiled new shows from its popular series What Not To Wear, Full Frontal Fashion and Behind The Label.

 What Not To Wear, which airs every Saturday at 9 pm, is a makeover programme hosted by fashion experts Trinny Woodall and Susanna Constantine.

 The programme tries to show that everyone, irrespective of their look, shape, height or age, can be made to look stylish, said Rajiv Bakshi, manager (corporate communications), Discovery Networks India.

 Each episode features a fashion victim whose movements are secretly taped for a few days. The fashion gurus then embark on a makeover mission, with some clever tweaks to his or her wardrobe for the desired change.

 Full Frontal Fashion covers various style topics ? from good-looking weddings to fashion secrets and easy beauty tips. Its also about whats in and whats out in fashion, who is wearing what and more, offered Bakshi. The series, hosted by model Rebecca Budig, airs Fridays at 11 pm.

 Behind The Label is all about the genesis of the A-list fashion labels. Its a behind-the-scenes look at what makes these labels special, the controversies surrounding them and the hard work that goes into making them what they are, explained Bakshi. The likes of Giorgio Armani, Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera will be featured every Friday at 11.30 pm.

 When we launched the channel in October 2004, we received a lot of questions on the need for such a niche channel, Bakshi said. There is a huge lifestyle shift going on in India, the travelling patterns of people are changing and they want to watch more lifestyle programmes.

 The channel claims to reach 22 million homes across the country and garner better viewership in certain categories than channels like Zee Caf? and STAR World. We are also planning to air more programmes on India by the end of this year, Bakshi added.

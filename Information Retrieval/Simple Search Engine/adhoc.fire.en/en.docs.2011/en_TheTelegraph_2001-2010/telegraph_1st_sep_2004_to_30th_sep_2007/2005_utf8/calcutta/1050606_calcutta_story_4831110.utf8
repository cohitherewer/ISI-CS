The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Planners in soul-search parleys

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Highrises, multiplexes, shopping malls, mega marts, sprawling parking lots, food courts, department stores? indicators of Calcutta becoming a better place to live in? 

 Or does it mean that the city is stressed out and that the focus of development should shift to the areas surrounding it?

 About 400 planners, engineers, valuers and architects associated with the state and Central governments will meet on Monday to discuss some crucial issues on urban planning and the role all the agencies concerned can play in the improvement of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.

 ?Urban planning and development should address emerging issues. Though an idea has been created that Calcutta is now a better place to live in, one has to look deeper and examine whether this change has been only superficial,? said an engineer working with the state government?s urban development department on Sunday. 

 The discussion is being organised by the Forum of Scientists, Engineers and Technologists, along with other bodies comprising planners and engineers. 

 At Monday?s seminar, where ?moving on from here? will be a key issue, some of the important areas to be debated are:

 The existence of gaps between plans prepared by different authorities and their actual implementation. 

 The far-from-satisfactory state of infrastructural facilities, when compared to other cities. 

 The changes taking place are of a cosmetic nature and cannot have any long-term beneficial effect. 

 Most infrastructure in the city is now under tremendous pressure.

 Absence of long-term effective and comprehensive planning and a large number of ad-hoc decisions outside the purview of any planning document have worsened the situation.

 Planners feel the need for development organisations to ensure that policies and strategies make a visible difference.

 ?Well-defined, small, medium and metropolitan cities? must also be developed to ease the pressure on Calcutta. 

 State urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and member of the state planning board Amiya Bagchi are scheduled to attend Monday?s seminar.

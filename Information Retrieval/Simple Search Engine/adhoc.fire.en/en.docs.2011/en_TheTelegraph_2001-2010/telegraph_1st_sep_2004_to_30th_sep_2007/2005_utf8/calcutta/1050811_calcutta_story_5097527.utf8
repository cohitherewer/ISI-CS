The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On a march to battle HIV

 - year-long walk across 300 stops in 13 states

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The local administration in Howrah is all set to welcome heroes of a rare kind on August 25. A team of AIDS campaigners will enter Howrah that day, after travelling on foot across several states for seven months.

 The 30 core workers, along with another 25, including a medical team, started out on the year-long walk on World AIDS Day in December 2004 from New Delhi. 

 Their mission: to generate awareness about HIV in 300 cities, towns and villages in 13 states, before returning to the starting point on December 1, 2005.

 Organised by Project Concern International (PCI), a US-based charitable organisation, the AIDS Walk For Life 2004-2005 (AWFL) was earlier described as ?a heroic and historic effort? by George Deikun, mission director, USAID.

 The walkers are following the Golden Quadrilateral, the 6,000-km transportation artery cutting across the country. The team is covering an average 20 km a day, spending the nights either in public buildings or camping in tents under tough conditions, said an official of PCI (India).

 ?The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 4 crore. We are being financially supported by various Indian and multinational corporations,? said Madhu Mishra, resource development officer, AWFL, PCI (India).

 The AIDS campaigners are scheduled to enter Howrah on August 25 through Deulti. ?Senior government officials will be present there to extend the administration?s full support to the mission. They will come to Howrah town on August 28. We are planning a gala felicitation at Sarat Sadan to welcome the group,? said Sankar Saha, chief medical officer health (CMOH), Howrah.

 The next stop will be Calcutta. In West Bengal, the team is planning to cover 404 km in five districts in 25 days. The walkers will organise AIDS awareness events, like street dramas and video shows, along the route and at the daily halt points.

 The mobile health van which is accompanying the walkers will provide general medical care, treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases and referrals for HIV testing.

 ?We are planning to tag an HIV/AIDS campaign van along with the walkers. We will also extensively use television and radio to spread awareness about the disease,? the CMOH signed off.

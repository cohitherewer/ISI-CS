 As children, whenever the special goodies went around, we had to be democratic and share and share alike, irrespective of age, weight, size or shape, which in our gang did not vary that greately anyway. 

 A bar of chocolate would be halved, then quartered, or whatever ? our first lessons in fractions ? but everyone got an equal portion. Even for food that was not easily divisible we managed without getting into figure.

 But sometimes, there was one tormentor, who ate very slowly, and was only one-third of the way through his or her share when the rest of us were done and ready for more, and looking on hungrily. A rare treat was an ice-cream cone. There used to be an ice-cream vending van that rolled through our neighbourhood every now and then, with no predictable schedule, but usually late afternoon and as soon as we heard the familiar tune it chimed, we would drop everything and rush out of doors to grab this coveted item, which came in only two flavours ? vanilla and strawberry. Cone eating was a perfect activity for a tormentor, who would nurse the scoop with great forbearance only to enjoy the thrill of being the centre of attention when the rest of us were through.

 Talking of ice-cream, here is an interesting Calcutta story. A young lady, Natasha Aggarwal, very much a Calcuttan, completed school in the city and went on to England for further studies. During holidays on the Continent she visited Italy several times, discovered the wonders of Italian ice-cream (gelato), went back to Italy for training in the making of gelato and then came back to set up shop in New Alipore. 

 Gelato, which literally translated means ice-cream is synonymous with Italian life and culture and every locality has its own gelaterias. In fact, ice-cream is said to have been invented in Italy ? in Tuscany ? as early as 1565. Every gelateria has its own recipes and methods. The gelato is homemade in small batches and this necessitates a greater level of craftsmanship and skill. 

 Natasha learnt this art in Bergamo, under the guidance of chef Danielle Ghisalberti, and has brought back with her many of his trademark recipes.

 Mama Mia! is the name of the gelateria located at 19/S, Block A, New Alipore, and there is absolutely no question in my mind that visiting this neat and friendly parlour is a special experience, quite different, and better, than the ice-creams we have been used to. The texture is smoother, creamier and because the infusion of air is much less, the flavours are more intense. The gelato is made fresh everyday and only natural ingredients are used ? there is not a drop of synthetic essence involved.

 On a given day there will be 18 options and about six of these will be fruit gelatos, involving no milk or cream; in other words they are water-ices, or sorbets. They are smooth and 70 per cent is real fruit, the natural pulp being imported for this purpose. If locally sourced, seasonal fluctuations in availability and quality would affect the product. 

 avours include green apple, pineapple, Sicily lemon, honey dew melon, watermelon, wine grape, passion fruit and ginger lemon. Eating these, you taste the real fruit as palpably as if you were holding it in your hand. The Sicily lemon, for example, is sour enough to send shivers down the spine. Commonly known as khatta ice cream, it is a popular flavour. 

 Then there are the cream gelatos, most of which involve flavours that are non-fruit, though fruit and cream combinations like figs and cream, forest berries and cream and strawberry cream do exist and are delicious. 

 Other tempting options are Irish Coffee, Tiramisu (ice-cream to remind you of that celebrated Italian dessert), Muddy Fudge (with Belgian dark chocolate), Vanilla (no essence but real vanilla beans), Pistachio, Twilight (reminds you of After Eight chocolate), Ferrero Rocher and Chocolate Cinnamon (a touch of Indian spice).

 Sundaes and dessert combinations do exist but the emphasis is on single-flavour gelatos. 

 The Sizzling Brownies, however, must be mentioned, for its sheer dramatic value. A brownie, topped by a scoop of vanilla, is doused with hot chocolate sauce over a hot griddle so it sizzles and smarts with minor explosions as it is served at your table.

 Prices at Mama Mia! are friendly ? Rs 30 to Rs 100 (for sundaes and other specials). Their products are 96 per cent to 100 per cent fat-free and completely vegetarian. You can take home one litre or half litre packs in thermocole boxes and this opens up a world of possibilities, because once at home, you can add your own ingredients ?chopped fruits, dollops of jam, honey, golden syrup ? the sky is the limit.

 A fantasy of mine has been to blend Bengali sweets with a neutral ice-cream like vanilla. Imagine warm, fresh gulab jamuns in vanilla icecream, or freshly made jeeleepies broken into pieces and put into icecream or rosomalai in a mild chocolate ice-cream...

 In about a fortnight, Mama Mia! will have a branch at Ballygunge Circular Road, right next to Caf? Coffee Day.

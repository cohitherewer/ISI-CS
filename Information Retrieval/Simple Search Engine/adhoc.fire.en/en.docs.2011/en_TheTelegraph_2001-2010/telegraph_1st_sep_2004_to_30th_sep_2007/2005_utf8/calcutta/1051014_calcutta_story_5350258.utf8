The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech hub spruce-up with twin hotels

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 To make Salt Lake?s Sector V more attractive to the IT companies, the state government will build two hotels and two bus terminuses with shopping facilities at the tech hub. The state government will invite expressions of interest for the projects next week.

 ?The two small hotels will allow business travellers to stay in Sector V and hold meetings there. They are now forced to stay elsewhere in the city, and hence, waste a lot of time commuting,? said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), on Thursday.

 A lot of Sector V visitors take a morning flight to the city, hold meetings during the day and take the evening flight out. Several others do not stay more than a day or two.

 ?All that these people are looking for are basic facilities, not five-star comfort. But they are compelled to stay at the star addresses for want of choice,? said another CMDA official. 

 He added: ?The room-count of the new hotels won?t be large. There might be just five to 10 rooms for a night?s stay. The focus will be on changing rooms, rest rooms, conference halls, rooms for meeting and entertaining clients, and facilities for outstation calls and Internet. The concept is being worked out with an eye on comfort.? 

 Plots for both hotels, around 15 cottahs each, have been earmarked. An acre each has also been allocated for the bus terminuses. One of them will be located near Nicco Park and Nalban, the other, beyond the Wipro office.

 ?There is a need for bus terminuses and taxi stands in Sector V. People should be able call up taxis and ask to be picked up from a particular spot. There must also be shopping facilities. These, along with other public utility services like toilets, will help improve the image of Sector V,? said a senior official of CMDA.

 The agency is implementing four projects that will be maintained by private parties on lease. The expressions of interest for the projects will be invited next week. 

 ?We will select the companies with the best and the most innovative concept, and attractive financial terms,? Baviskar said.

 There are also plans to improve roads, water supply and sewerage in Sector V and make it more beautiful. ?The hotels and terminuses are the first priority. The other projects will be taken up after that,? the official said.

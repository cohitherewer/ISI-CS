 Salaam, Mr Bachchan

 Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan in the Rakhi special episode of KBC 2

 After lots of rona-dhona and some pyaar-vyaar, they did get together at the end of Kal Ho Naa Ho. And now they would be romancing non-stop on the beaches of Melbourne, even as they greet each other with Salaam Namaste. But not before Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta answer some of cool B?s questions in the Rakhi special episode of KBC Dwitiya, Friday, at 9 pm.

 In fact, Preity will become the first ever hot seat occupant to appear on both editions of KBC. And this time, too, she will donate the money she will win to charity. ?It?s a children?s hospital in Mumbai,? says Preity. ?Pichhli baar jab main aayee thee, I had given it to a charity in Punjab, but is baar jo disaster hua, flooding and all, I thought Mumbai mein paise doongi.?

 Saif will be giving his prize money to the Red Cross. ?I am specially donating it to the section which has promised to look after flood relief,? he says.

 And guess whom Saif and Preity call up when they are stuck on a particular question and have to phone a friend? The 27-year-old director of Salaam Namaste, Siddharth Raj Anand. ?But I won?t tell you whether I am able to help the two out or not,? laughs Siddharth. 

 We will know that soon.

Life

Meet the rockers

Pratim D. Gupta catches up with 

Navtej Singh Rehal of Bombay Rockers as the Indo-Danish duo gears up to perform 

in the city tonight

 BOMBAY BEATS: Thomas Sardorf and Navtej Singh 

Rehal

Teri toh? Teri tah?

They have rocked so many of your parties sitting in 

Denmark. And now, Navtej Singh Rehal and Thomas Sardorf are in town to Rock 

tha party at Golden Parks Fusion on Saturday night, live.

Joe Satriani may be guitar god for a discerning few, 

but the beat of Bombay Rockers is what gets every party animal going.

Whats more, its a Calcutta-based event 

management company called Mirage that has got the international duo touring India.

Landing in Delhi on Thursday night, Navtej spoke to 

Goodlife over phone during a late Friday morning breakfast.

Coming together

Thomas and Janus Barnewitz were two halves of the 

Scandinavian producer team WCA. Indian singer Navtej, better known as Naf, got 

jamming with the two and what resulted became known as Bombay Rockers.

While Naf became the Indian vocalist, Thomas started 

singing the English lyrics with Janus remaining in the background.

In Denmark, the mention of the word Bombay 

connects everyone with India, says Naf. 

Now, Indianness is what sets our music apart 

from the rest. So the name Bombay Rockers was kept to make the Danish understand 

the Indian roots of our music, he adds.

It was Punjabi MCs Mundiyan tu bachke rahi 

that inspired Bombay Rockers to come up with its first single 

Ari ari, which got extended national airplay on Danish radio and was a 

rage with the DJs there.

After Ari ari, we didnt want to 

do the same UK bhangra stuff, recalls Naf. It was then that 

we formulated our own kind of sound which is a mix of rock, pop, R amp;B and dance 

music. Its now called pop everywhere, though.

Going places

From Las Vegas to Copenhagen, Bombay Rockers was soon 

jamming everywhere. Its concert at the Images of Asia festival branded the duo 

as the next big thing in Indian music outside India. 

And before the Danish radios could get over its first 

official single Sexy Mama, the Bombay Rockers debut album Introducing? 

was released in more than 32 countries around the world.

The fun thing was that none of the people in 

the foreign countries including Europe could actually understand the Hindi lyrics 

in our songs, laughs Naf. They would just love the music and pick 

up the words slowly. But then again it was the Indian words in our songs which 

made them stand out in the hip-hop and R amp;B heap that is being dished out.

It was, finally, the single Rock tha party which 

got everyone grooving to Bombay Rockers.

It was the simplicity of the lyrics ? Teri 

toh, teri tah ? which made the song so catchy and put it on everyones 

lips, feels the Indian half of the duo. And we started rocking every 

party everywhere.

Here and now

This is, in fact, Bombay Rockers first commercial 

tour in India.

Its gotta be really good ? we will finally 

get to sing in front of people who completely understand our language, shouts 

an animated Naf. 

We have never been so excited before a live 

performance, he admits.

Bombay Rockers is also very keen about the city jig 

at the restobar of the Ho Chi Minh Sarani hotel. We are aware that we have 

been a big hit at the discos in Calcutta and it should be great to get a first-hand 

feel of the proceedings, he feels.

And what about the next album, now that the sound 

of Bombay Rockers has rocked us and them? 

We arent sure at the moment, admits 

Naf. But its definitely going to be something pop, he signs 

off. 

For now, its just time to Rock tha party?

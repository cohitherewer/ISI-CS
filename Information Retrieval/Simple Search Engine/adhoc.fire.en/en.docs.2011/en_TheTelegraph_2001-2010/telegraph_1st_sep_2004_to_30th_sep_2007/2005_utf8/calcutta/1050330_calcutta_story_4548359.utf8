 Upkeep flaw in fume test flop

 - 35 per 

cent Cars with pollution papers fail to meet new standards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over 35 per cent of the private cars that obtained pollution-under-control (PUC) certificates under the old system are failing to clear the emission test by the new multi-gas analyser machines.

According to automobile experts and testers, lack 

of maintenance and timely repair is responsible for the failures. The experts 

prescribed a 15-point guideline to car-owners, which will help them clear the 

pollution test.

 According to the new rules, emission of all vehicles has to be measured by computerised multi-gas analyser machines. Though the norms came into effect from October, the auto emission testing centres (AETCs) failed to meet the deadline due to non-availability of machines. Since January, the machines have been operational in around 100 centres.

 The old machines were capable of measuring the emission level of only one gas, while the new gadgets can measure the emission levels of carbon monoxide and oxygen, besides engine temperature and the revolution per minute of the wheels.

 Emission Testing Centre Owners? Association secretary Asim Banerjee said there is almost no scope for manipulating the new testing machines. ?A large number of old cars, which obtained PUC certificates two months ago, are failing to clear the test now. We urge the car-owners to get the necessary maintenance and repair work done by technicians before visiting the AETCs,?? Banerjee added.

 According to automobile expert S.M. Ghosh, any properly maintained car, no matter how old, can clear the emission test.

 Auto emission expert Sudip Mukherjee ? who conducts tests at Surya Filling Station in Bagbazar, where the first multi-gas analyser machine in the city was installed ? said that around 35 per cent of old cars failed to clear the test.

 ?Many of the cars which failed to clear the test, got minor repair and maintenance work done at nearby garages and passed the test. We feel the main reason behind the failure to clear the emission test is poor maintenance of the vehicles. We have seen a 30-year old vehicle clear the test,?? Mukherjee added.

 Paban Pal, emission tester at Lake Auto Service, has had a similar experience. ?Almost all the old taxis which used to get PUC certificates with ease some months ago are failing to clear the test now,?? he said.

 Soumen Mondal of Salt Lake Service station said that at least 50 per cent of cars that were denied PUC certificates got the clearance in the next attempt after minor adjustment of the engines.

 ?We will not provide PUC certificates unless the vehicle has been tested by the new machines. We have made the emission norms stricter to ensure reduction in air pollution,?? said public vehicles department director H. Mohan.

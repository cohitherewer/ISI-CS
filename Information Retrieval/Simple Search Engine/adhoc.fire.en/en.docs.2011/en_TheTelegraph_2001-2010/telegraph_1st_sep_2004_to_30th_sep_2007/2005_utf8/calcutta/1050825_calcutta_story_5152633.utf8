 A 28-year-old housewife allegedly tried to kill her two sons by stabbing them and forcing them to drink phenyle, before attempting suicide herself around 11 pm on Tuesday. It was said to be the fallout of a domestic quarrel. 

 The housewife, Nanda Ukey, was arrested but later released on bail. Her sons, aged four and three, are fighting for life in a nursing home.

 The incident took place at Tarama apartment, on Bosepara Road, near James Long Sarani. ?The woman?s husband, Vinod Ukey, returned home as usual around 11 pm. He knocked on the door of his second-floor flat and found it locked from inside,? said Sukumar Mondal, building caretaker.

 Vinod, an employee of a five-star hotel, went down, got hold of a ladder kept inside the compound, and climbed it to reach the window of his apartment. He saw his sons Suraj and Ritwik lying in a bloody mess. His wife lay on the floor. He alerted his neighbours, who broke into the apartment. 

 ?When we broke open the door of the flat, we found Nanda lying on the floor. She appeared deranged, with her clothes in disarray. She was banging her head against the wall, calling her husband names and muttering something about his ?second marriage?,? said a neighbour. ?She even said Vinod had appropriated her property, turning her into a pauper. ?

 It was hard to control her, but her neighbours somehow calmed her down. 

 Vinod, with the help of his neighbours, removed the children from the bed.

 ?Since they were bleeding profusely from wounds in their chest, we had to take immediate care of them. When we tore open their clothes, we found that the stab wounds were quite deep. We tried to staunch the wounds with cotton wool. Thereafter, we took both of them to a local nursing home,? said Sraboni Chowdhury, the lone woman in the crowd. She gave them first-aid.

 According to Prithwish Nandy, officer-in-charge of Thakurpukur police station, Vinod stated in his complaint against his wife that they had quarrelled over her demand to visit her father?s house in Nagpur.

 ?It seemed, initially, that the woman is mentally unstable. We arrested her under Section 324 of the IPC (voluntarily causing harm using sharp weapons),? said S.N. Gupta, police superintendent of South 24-Parganas.

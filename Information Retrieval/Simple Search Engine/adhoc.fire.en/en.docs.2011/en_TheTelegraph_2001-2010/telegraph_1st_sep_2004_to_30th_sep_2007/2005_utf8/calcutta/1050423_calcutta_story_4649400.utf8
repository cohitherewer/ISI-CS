 Course to serve hotel 

guests better

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Serving wine, choosing cutlery and comfortably using restaurant jargon, in English and French... 

 All that and more is what the Institute of Hospitality Studies (IHS) is promising industry hopefuls.

 Housekeeping staff, bar managers and even waiters will be trained at the institute starting July, at the 6 Russell Street centre being set up by the management of Sourav?s ? The Food Pavilion, the restaurant backed by the Indian cricket captain.

 ?Leading hotel management institutes are producing managers by the dozen. But little attention is being paid to service and housekeeping, which is the nerve centre of a hotel,? explains Kanishka Mazumdar, director of the institute and CEO of Sourav?s.

 To plug the gap, two one-and-a-half-year courses ? a post-graduate diploma in professional executive housekeeping and a diploma in food and beverage service ? will start at IHS, costing Rs 50,000.

 The post-graduate course will teach a range of housekeeping responsibilities. 

 Six months? practical training will take in use of equipment, maintenance, room inspection and follow up.

 ?The housekeeping staff interacts with the guests more than the general manager. So they must have maximum product knowledge,? explains Mazumdar.

 The diploma in food and beverage service will cover, for starters, buffet layout, restaurant control, menu planning and staff organisation. 

 Hands-on sessions will be taken on service of beverages and spirits, cigars and cigarettes. 

 The institute will also start two six-month courses at half the price on professional housekeeping and waiting and food and beverage service. Practical lessons will take up service of meals, spring-cleaning and other routine jobs.

 The industrial training will be conducted at hotels including Taj Bengal, Oberoi Grand and Hyatt Regency. 

 The faculty will include industry professionals. Sourav Ganguly may also make an appearance to conduct a session on leadership and motivation.

 A library, audio-visual equipment, computers with broadband connections and indoor sports and gym facilities complete the package.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School jubilee with girl college 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Girls? High School is opening Wesley College on August 1, the day the school completes 150 years.

 Named after the founder, the college is built on the premises of the school and promises to be an exclusive institute, providing education for girls in niche fields, where Calcutta lacks the cutting edge. 

 ?We will be running both degree courses as well as a number of vocational courses here,? said Montoo Rakhit, principal, Calcutta Girl?s High School. ?While in the degree courses, we will be offering law (Ll.B) and commerce, in the vocational courses, there will be several interesting options, like hospital administration, mass communication, computer applications, call centre training, nursing and hotel management,? she added.

 While the vocational courses are still on the anvil, the degree courses are almost finalised. Apart from law and commerce, the college may also offer a Bachelor?s degree in arts. ?Currently, there are few good commerce colleges for girls in the city. The choice for studying law is equally limited. Our college will provide quality education in these areas,? said Rakhit.

 This year, the college plans to start off with only an evening course in computer applications from September. 

 ?The building is not yet ready. By next year, we hope to start all the degree courses, as well as the hospital administration and the hotel management courses,? said Rakhit. 

 The rest of the courses will begin over the next two years. While the degree courses will be held during the day, the vocational courses will be run in the evening and will vary from a period of six months to two years.

 While the cost of constructing the three-storeyed college building is still not clear, the money involved in developing the different courses will vary according to the course. The cost of education will be on the higher side, as seats will be limited owing to lack of space. 

 ?But we will provide quality education. For instance, in mass communication, we are working towards signing an MoU with Jamia Milia Islamia university,? said Rakhit.

Going nuts over Watts

 Naomi Watts with King King co-star 

Adrien Brody and director Peter Jackson 

Right before she left to begin an arduous, six-month 

shoot in New Zealand for Peter Jackson?s high-profile remake of King Kong, 

Naomi Watts bought her first house. Her friends thought she was crazy. Why make 

a monthly mortgage payment on a pricey Westside property when you?re going to 

be gone for half a year? ?I just need somewhere to dream about,? Watts says. ?I?m 

sick of not having a nest.? 

The Australia-born actress moved to Hollywood nearly 

15 years ago and struggled for years through failed auditions, bad movies (Children 

of the Corn IV) and mediocre TV projects before her breakthrough role in David 

Lynch?s 2001 bizarre masterpiece Mulholland Dr. 

So who?s to begrudge her a home to call her own? ?She?s 

like a good wine,? says her 21 Grams director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. 

?You put her in the cellar for a few years, then bring her out and she?s even 

better, more complex, than before.? 

That complexity has been on display through films 

that have ranged from crowd-pleasing horror (The Ring) to existential comedy 

(I (Heart) Huckabees) to excruciating tragedy (21 Grams, for which 

Watts earned her first Oscar nomination). 

This year, Watts can be seen in as many as four movies, 

The Ring Two, Stay (she plays a suicidal student), Ellie Parker 

(here, she?s a Hollywood go-getter) and, of course, King Kong. ?She?s very 

persuasive in just about anything she tries,? says Hideo Nakata, her director 

in The Ring Two. ?She is not your typical horror actress, but she is perfect 

for the genre because she possesses an intensity that is quite remarkable.? 

But Watts does not like the label of ?a franchise 

actress?. ?I certainly don?t think of myself that way. Hopefully, there?s no way 

to describe my career. Hopefully, it can remain diverse,? says the petite actress. 

Perhaps diversity is what got Watts to do her first 

comedy, I (Heart) Huckabees. ?I was very nervous. I had spent years auditioning, 

and a lot of those auditions were sitcoms and people told me over and over again 

that I was not funny. I just kind of needed the assurance of my director that 

I was going to be ok. I do remember calling (director) David (O. Russell) up and 

saying, ?I don?t know if I?m the right person for this. I?m not funny. I really 

should tell you that now.? And he said, ?What are you talking about? You?ll be 

fine.? And that?s all I needed ? reassurance.?

And if Watts does choose to do another comedy, her 

co-star has to be Sean Penn. ?He?s really funny. It?s his nature. It?s one of 

the leading things about him. He?s obviously very serious and moral and outspoken, 

but he is also a total prankster and a goofy guy, the opposite of what you think 

from what he puts forward. He?s got kids. He?s a kid himself.? 

Coming back to The Ring sequel, The Ring 

Two, Watts encountered a lot of ?freaky things? on the sets like pipes bursting 

and a swarm of bees appearing. ?Some strange things happened. There are two ways 

of looking at it. It could be a series of weird coincidences or you could read 

something into it. I certainly thought, ?This is a little bit freaky.? But overall, 

I tend to be more pragmatic.? 

Watts does admit that she is superstitious. ?A little 

bit. I don?t walk under ladders. (But) I get very superstitious with the way I 

work. Little things happen. Sometimes gifts are given to you. Nothing too literal. 

Something can happen in the middle of a scene and you go with it. You try to be 

as open as possible, almost willing things like that to happen to keep you surprised 

and off-balance.? 

But when it comes to films like King Kong, 

anxiety takes over from superstition. ?I didn?t know what to expect going in. 

I was very nervous about acting with Kong. A good portion of the film is close 

contact between myself and Kong. But I?ve got Andy Serkis (who performed the computer-generated 

Gollum through the marvels of motion-capture in the last two Lord of the Rings 

movies) and what Andy brings to the party is like a whole other art form. I mean, 

he?s a gorilla! He is a gorilla!?

And she can?t get over the scenes with the ?monkey?. 

?I?m looking into his eyes. Mind you, he?s wearing a suit, a motion-capture suit. 

It?s not hairy. His research is what transforms him. Andy went to Rwanda to study 

gorillas for two weeks. He worked in the London Zoo for two months and fed the 

gorillas. He completely understands the behaviour and is dedicated to getting 

it right. Other than the size, when I look into his eyes, I?m getting monkey. 

There?s a lot of monkey. (Laughs) It?s not just a guy in a monkey suit,? 

Watts signs off.

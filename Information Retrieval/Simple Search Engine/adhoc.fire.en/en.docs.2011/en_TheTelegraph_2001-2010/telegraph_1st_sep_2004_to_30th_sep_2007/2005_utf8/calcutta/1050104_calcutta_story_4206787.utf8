 The world?s gaze of course is at the tsunami-ravaged, as the bruised nations still count their dead and try to pick up the pieces from the disaster deck. But, in the midst of this all-pervading numbness, there?s a little cheer ahead for animal-lovers and pet owners in and around Calcutta.

 As part of the Animal Welfare Fortnight (January 14-28), city-based NGO Compassionate Crusaders Trust (CCT) has announced the launch of a couple of new welfare services ? one for pets, and one for those who love their pets enough to give them a dignified farewell.

 The ?Pet Aid? service will enable people to transport sick pets comfortably to and from the CCT clinic or Ashari, the animal hospital-shelter of sister organisation People for Animals (PFA) off the EM Bypass. There will be an expert handler to help lift the pet onto the ambulance and administer life-saving medication on board, if needed.

 ?Each year, we try to add either a new service, or a new thrust to the movement,? says Debasis Chakrabarti, CCT founder and PFA managing trustee. The ?one-of-its-kind-in-town? critical-care ambulance, originally donated by the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and previously used as a mobile clinic, will be equipped to handle all exigencies, like bleeding wounds, broken limbs and emergency delivery.

 The ambulance will have air-cushioned seats, like beanbags, in which the injured or sick animal can curl up comfortably and not feel the impact of a bumpy ride. ?Our para-vet on board will be trained to address any emergency and the same ambulance can be used to ferry the animal back home after a surgical procedure to prevent post-operative trauma,? adds Chakrabarti.

 The other introduction, the ?Bon Adieu? van, will bring comfort to those who find it difficult to organise transport to take their pets to their final resting place. The hearse will be available to take pets to Karuna Kunj, the shelter for homeless animals off Thakurpukur, which also has a burial ground.

 ?We will pick up the owners (maximum two persons) along with the pet and drive them back in the hearse. They can give the animal a dignified burial and return with the comfort of knowing that the best possible farewell was given to the faithful companion who provided a lifetime of love and loyalty,? says Purnima Toolsidass, CCT founder-trustee.

 The fees collected from the hearse service for pets will be used to augment conditions at Karuna Kunj, which now houses over 100 cats, 45 dogs, blind monkey Raju and injured birds. ?With the number of homeless animals increasing by the day, we are also encouraging adoption with the promise of all logistics support,? says Chakrabarti.

 Facts for fast crime bust

 A STAFF REPORTER

 To ensure swifter and scientific probes, the criminal investigation department (CID) of West Bengal police is logging on to Facts, fingerprint analysis and criminal tracking system, developed by software major CMC. 

 Adoption of Facts, used by detective departments across 12 Indian states, will make collection of fingerprints, their analysis and tracking easier and faster. 

 To begin with, the system based on intranet will help in matching fingerprints ? collected from the scene of crime ? online with the 35,000-strong sample stored in the central database.

 The product promises to bring an end to tedious paperwork involved in fingerprint matching and shortlisting and identification of criminals. 

 CMC has also developed a mobile fingerprint unit, comprising a laptop, a mini scanner and a digital camera. 

 ?The mobile fingerprint unit will rush to the place of crime and collect data from the spot. The data will be collected on a laptop and later added to the CID database. We plan to increase the database of fingerprints from 35,000 to 2 lakh,? said R.K. Mahanty, additional director general of police (CID), during the launch of Facts. 

 According to a CMC official, the product was developed ? by customising a set of new features on Facts ? keeping in mind the police department?s need to cut down on probe time. 

 ?We have developed the product in less than three months and now it is operational,? said a CMC official. 

 With CID deciding on embracing technology in its investigation process, the company is in talks with senior officers about induction of other hi-tech tools like eCops and automatic vehicle tracking system (AVTS) in the state police?s armoury.

 ?Oh God, this is Utopia?

 He is known for his love for anything and everything sweet. So it wasn?t surprising that he wasn?t letting go of his chocolate cookies as he relaxed on the couch in the VIP lounge at JW Marriott, Mumbai, on Wednesday night. Sweet were also the words that flowed out in that famous baritone?

 Ek Ajnabee has been specially written with you in mind. Are you changing the trend in Bollywood where stars were relegated to side roles after 40?

 That?s for people like you to say or write about. It?s very exciting to learn that there are movies and scripts being written around you at the age of 64. Then you find that the people that are wanting to work with you are very efficient directors and talented people. And then you discover that they have a fantastic story or a role for you. My God, this is like Utopia?

 You must be having other criteria for selecting a film?

 As you said, at 64, you do not get many such opportunities to play the central character. I am really thankful that there are people who are ready to take that challenge, take that risk of casting a 64-year-old as the main character. Also the fact that Ek Ajnabee was going to be shot from start-to-finish. (Director) Apoorva Lakhia is a very dear friend, he?s like family, very close to Abhishek. Abhishek did his very first directorial venture, Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost. 

 But that bombed at the box-office?

 I had seen him work in Boom. He was the first assistant director to Kaizad (Gustad). He was very organised, brought in new principles and new ideas to production and film-making. I liked his work. He is modern, very aggressive, very impatient to prove himself. The film also gave me an opportunity to work with somebody of my son?s age.

 lIs it different to work with someone so young? 

 It?s very exciting for an actor, especially for us who have been working since the late 60s, when having a call sheet was unheard of. Today, everything is planned, down to very precise things like what time you should be on the sets, what time you should do the make-up, what exactly the shots are going to be, camera angles, dialogues, everything. It just makes life so much easier. To be part of such a professional and organised unit was very exciting.

 Tell us something about your role in Ek Ajnabee?

 I am an ex-army commando who is leading a retired life. His friend is Arjun Rampal who was his colleague in the army and is now stationed in Bangkok. He has invited Surya Veer Singh ? my name in the film ? to Bangkok. He wants him to take up a job, which is to act as a bodyguard to an affluent family which has a little daughter. A lot of people do not know that kidnapping is a much larger business than even drugs today and is very rampant in that area. 

 Apoorva wanted to recreate your action image of the 70s and 80s. How comfortable are you doing action at this age?

 At 64, you can?t move the same way that you did when you were in your 20s and 30s. If I am able to manage, I do action. A lot of stuff is done on wires now. That?s ok. But if it?s running and actual physical activities, I have some restraints on that because of my physicality.

 What about your new look for the film?

 I can?t talk about my own look. If it?s appealing to you and it?s appealing to people, all I can say is thank you?

 Bachchan in ek Ajnabee 

Acting with children is said to be the toughest. After Ayesha in Black, most of your scenes in Ek Ajnabee are with Baby Rucha?

 Children are very normal and they are very gifted. They are casual and they don?t come from any training, which is so wonderful. That is also very frightening but they can surprise you. You have to be on your guard. Most of the times, we are making all the mistakes, they are always right. It?s also great fun? they are so natural. 

 You have had the most amazing year? 

 I have been fortunate. I have had a few successful films, a few memorable films. Films that I feel very proud of. Something like Black, which is by far the most challenging film I have done. Then there?s Sarkar, Waqt? Some of them are not so memorable. There?s good, there?s bad, there?s success, there?s failure? I am happy with how the year has turned out.

 You have another big challenge in playing Gabbar Singh...

 I haven?t yet sat with Ram Gopal Varma for the creatives. I just met him on Tuesday and we have decided to do Sarkar 2. I did have a lot of apprehension about Sarkar since there have been so many adaptations of Godfather but now I am confident that he can do anything.

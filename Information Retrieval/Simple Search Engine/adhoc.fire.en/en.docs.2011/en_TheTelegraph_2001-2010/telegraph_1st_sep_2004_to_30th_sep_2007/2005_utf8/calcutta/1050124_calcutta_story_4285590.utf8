 Art has an inherent quality to touch peoples hearts and soothe troubled minds. In times of adversity, it also has the power to draw people together, enabling them to offer a helping hand to those more unfortunate than themselves. Hosted by names-AN.art, in association with Asian Hotels and Delhi Public School, Rajarhat, Ode to Bengal, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by artists from Bengal, represents a genuine exposition of this ability. Being held in aid of tsunami survivors, the show features works from names-AN.art?s collection, in addition to paintings in several media by eminent artists including Paritosh Sen, Prakash Karmakar, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Shuvaprasanna, Ashoke Mullick (painting above), Sanatan Dinda and Rabin Mondal, among others.

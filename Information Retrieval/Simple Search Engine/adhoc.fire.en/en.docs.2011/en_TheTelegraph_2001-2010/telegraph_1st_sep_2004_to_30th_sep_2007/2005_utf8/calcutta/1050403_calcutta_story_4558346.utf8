 Game for glory on the challenging greens

 Not enchanting railway stations 

 or exciting thoroughbreds. These are names assigned to well-tended 

 holes at the par 70, 6,349-yard (5,576 yards for the ladies) 

 Tollygunge Club golf course. What was once an indigo plantation 

 of the East India Company, was converted into a nine-hole 

 golf course in 1896 and six years later, the full 18 holes 

 came into play.

 ?We may not be the oldest course 

 in the country, but certainly one of the most challenging 

 ones in Asia. And the course design ensures that some species 

 of tree or the other would flower throughout the year, so 

 that there?s never a colourless month at The Tolly,? says 

 A.K. ?Bablu? Chowdhuri, managing member (golf), Tollygunge 

 Club.

 Chowdhuri, who knows all the other 

 interesting anomalies of the Tolly course ?- beginning with 

 double greens for the first and seventh holes ? better than 

 most, is proud of the golf ball?s ?perfect lie? on the extensively 

 re-grassed greens. A lot of work has gone into sub-surface 

 drainage to make the course playable round the year, and 

 the successful rollout of the VRS has streamlined maintenance 

 operations.

 With the course perimeter now 

 walled, there?s no trespassing, says Chowdhuri, and under 

 the tutelage of golf consultant Ranjit Nanda, more than 

 half the greens have been redone. ?We have also propagated 

 a special species of grass, which takes the early monsoon 

 showers well, and vigorously pursued planting of trees,? 

 he adds.

 The extensive upgrade, along with 

 the commissioning of the floodlit driving range, hasn?t 

 taken anything away from the distinctive character of the 

 course, though. The par four, 321 yard, 15th hole is still 

 called Hydrophobia because of the monster water hazard that 

 gobbles up golf balls.

 Again, teeing off on a humid summer 

 morning, one has to still get past the large water tank 

 built by Prince Mohammad and now covered with water lilies, 

 to approach the green on the other side.

 While its fairways are steeped 

 in lore, the club is keen to look ahead and invest in youth 

 to keep the sport glowing on the greens. ?We already have 

 our junior programme up and running, with 60-odd trainees 

 in the age group of five to 18. Now, the focus is on a full-fledged 

 academy for which we need corporate sponsors. Till such 

 time, we are progressing on our own,? Chowdhuri says.

 Even as flagship tournaments like 

 the ITC Cup and the BOC Seniors are boasting progressively 

 bigger fields every year, the club is growing into a favourite 

 haunt for golf tourists from around the world.

 ?A lot of foreign visitors walk 

 in for a round or two and enjoy the quiet and the greenery 

 of the campus,? says the managing member. UK-based Lucifer 

 Golfing Society, a band of travelling golfers, recently 

 sent representatives to the club on a recce ahead of a full-fledged 

 tour next February.

 The Tolly, which has always been 

 a favourite haunt for consular diplomats in the city, has 

 also established itself as an effective platform to showcase 

 the investment potential of the state, thanks to the tremendous 

 success of the Consular Corps golf tournament.

 ?Golf was also a clinching factor 

 in Tolly featuring among the world?s Top 20 country clubs 

 in a BBC survey,? feels Chowdhuri.

 The man whose master brushstrokes had beautified many a bride on her special day, readied many an actress for the limelight and transformed many a plain Jane into glamour queen, is no more among us. Renowned make-up artiste Prabir De breathed his last on June 15, as an unfortunate railway accident snatched away his life.

 Friends of De have organised a condolence meeting on July 1 at the Princeton Club on Prince Anwar Shah Road. The meet between 6.30 and 8.30 in the evening seeks to remember and pay homage to the man who contributed immensely to the glamour industry of Calcutta. An integral part of the modelling world in the city since its birth in the early 90s, Des death has left a void in the sphere.

 Pizza pitch

 Pizza Hut has introduced a fresh bite in its range. Freshizza, a new crust that is neither too thick, nor too thin, is on a rampant promotion trail with Malaika Arora Khan as the peppy face of the new pizza. 

 Freshizza uses freshly prepared dough, much like what we use for chapatis at home. Freshness of a product is of prime importance to me, I like to give my family fresh food every day, gushes Malaika.

 The dough for Freshizza is claimed to be prepared daily to ensure a softer base. The crust is extremely soft and uses a distinct tomato-flavoured sauce, mozzarella and orange cheddar cheese. 

 Freshness of food is of prime importance to the Indian consumer. Freshizza aims to achieve the perfect balance between freshness and taste. India is the first market to be launching this crust but were sure that it will quickly make its mark beyond Indian shores as well, says Sandeep Kohli, managing director of Yum! Restaurants International India, which owns the brand worldwide. 

 Freshizza is available as a medium size and family size option with a choice of nine vegetarian and non- vegetarian topping combinations. 

 Starting at Rs 95, the pizzas are a must-try for those who like it just right ? not too thin, nor too thick.

 Magic yards

 Suravi Shree, the ethnic ensemble store opposite Ram Mandir in north Calcutta is a must-see sari destination for shoppers. This traditional store houses creations with a hint of innovation and refuses to be swamped by an overdose of sequins and stones.

 After depending on a loyal, older client base, the store that has just celebrated its 25th anniversary is now trying to woo a newer, younger customer group.

 We have made numerous changes in our designs in keeping with the taste of a younger client group that prefers chic and popular styles, but have held on to our authenticity and heritage as well, explained designer Manju Ganeriwal.

 The creations are mostly meant for traditional social occasions and flaunt Rajasthani motifs.

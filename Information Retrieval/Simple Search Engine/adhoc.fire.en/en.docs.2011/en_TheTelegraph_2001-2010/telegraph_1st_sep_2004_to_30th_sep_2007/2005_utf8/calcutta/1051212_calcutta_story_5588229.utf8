 Two faces of divinity

 - Kalighat violent, Belur serene for interpreter of myths

 From histories of gods to godly abodes. Saturday morning took scholar Roberto Calasso to the Kalighat temple. Here was ?an extreme case of Hindu devotion?. In less than 24 hours, another spiritual centre beckoned, and the contrast couldn?t be starker. 

 ?Belur Math is beautiful, and you have the feeling of something coming to you from the old times,? says the deeply moved scholar. ?The chat with the maharaj and the serenity of Vivekananda?s room at the Math seemed thousands of miles away from the violent devotion of Kalighat.?

 But Calasso ? the author of Ka, a book on Indian myths ? is also the first to point out that Calcutta, like India, is all about numbers. This gives the city a dimension he thinks is impossible to find in European cities such as his own, Milan. 

 What has struck the 64-year-old writer most about the hitherto-unexplored Indian city is what he calls ?the strange mixture of architectural elements?. 

 ?I am not too much in favour of ?restoration?, but someone who thinks that old structures need to be preserved in a tolerable condition. And it is high time some people in Calcutta got together and did something about pulling down old buildings,? urges the scholar, with a passion that is hard to find among Calcuttans.

 The best-selling author who doesn?t lay much store by awards, however, is a keen art-lover. At CIMA Gallery on Saturday, he got a chance to sample some contemporary Indian art. He ended up buying three works by tribal artists ? ?one from Bihar and two from Bengal, and all three great talents?. 

 Since India is going to feature in a big way in his next work, it is not surprising Calasso is trying to squeeze in as much of the city as he can during this trip, which, ?alas, must end on Wednesday afternoon?. 

 ?I will certainly visit the Indian Museum and Dakshineswar temple,? says the interpreter of myths, who also loves the hustle and bustle around New Market. 

 Every bit that he has taken in ? ?and it is only a little bit? ? will have a bearing on what he has to tell Calcutta at GD Birla Sabhagar at 7 pm on Monday. Then, it will be back to Milan, to researching for his new book. But Calcutta will not have seen the last of him. For, among all the Indian cities he has visited, Calasso has found he is most comfortable here.

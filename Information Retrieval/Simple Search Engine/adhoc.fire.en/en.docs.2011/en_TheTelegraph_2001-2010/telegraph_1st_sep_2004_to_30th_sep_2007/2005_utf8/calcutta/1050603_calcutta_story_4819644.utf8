 Slap kills wife?s brother

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An altercation between two brothers-in-law resulted in one slapping the other. And that was enough for the victim to fall unconscious. By the time doctors examined him, the 35-year-old was dead.

 The incident took place in Tiljala Lane, in the Karaya police station area, late on Wednesday. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Anuj Sharma said a missing gold ring had triggered the altercation between Sheikh Daulat Ali and victim Sheikh Asgar Ali.

 Asgar?s family members rushed him to SSKM Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. As news of the incident spread, police went to the Tiljala Lane address and arrested Daulat.

 ?Daulat, owner of a small cap-making unit, came to visit his in-laws a few days ago. One of his gold rings had been missing for the past three days,? said deputy commissioner Sharma.

 Late on Wednesday, when Asgar returned home, Daulat saw a gold ring on his finger. ?He accused Asgar of stealing it,? Sharma recounted.

 Asgar denied the charge and told Daulat he had bought it a week ago. ?Daulat lost his cool and slapped Asgar, who fell unconscious,? said an officer of Karaya police station.

 Daulat has been booked under Section 304 IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). ?It?s clear that he had no intention of murdering Asgar,? the officer added.

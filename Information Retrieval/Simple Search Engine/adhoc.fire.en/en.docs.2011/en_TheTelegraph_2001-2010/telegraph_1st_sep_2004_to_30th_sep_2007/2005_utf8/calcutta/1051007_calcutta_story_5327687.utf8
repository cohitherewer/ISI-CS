 An owl nestled on the rooftop or a swarm of squirrels scurrying for cover may make a lovely frame, but only if one has an eye for it. Green Globe, a nature photography competition in its second year this autumn, is inviting young nature-lovers with a flair for the frozen frame to send in photographs of rare wildlife moments.

 Organised by Aranyak ? a nature-lovers? association that promotes wildlife awareness ? with support from Patton, the competition invites entries from amateurs between 15 and 20 years (group A) and those between 21 and 25 years (group B).

 ?Indian bio-diversity is so rich but we are scarcely aware of it. We mostly get to see African and European wildlife on channels like National Geographic. Our idea is to encourage young people in nature photography, so that their attachment with greenery grows as well,? says Suchetana Bhattacharjee, core member of Aranyak and nature-loving daughter of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 ?Nature photography need not be an expensive hobby for the youth because school and college students can?t afford to travel to sanctuaries and forests to click pictures. Our neighbourhood is good enough if one is a keen observer,? feels Suchetana, who admits being not too savvy with the camera herself.

 December 23 is the last date for submission of entries for Green Globe; the forms will be received at Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake and at the Patton office on Camac Street.

 The prize-winning frames will be exhibited at the annual wildlife film festival to be hosted by Aranyak early next year. The panel of judges comprises officials from the forest department and established wildlife photographers.

 Aranyak is also trying to expand the 2006 edition of the film festival. The attempt will be to screen more Bengali language films on wildlife, alongside a greater participation of films and film-makers working on Indian wildlife.

 ?A retrospective on renowned wildlife photographer Nick Gordon is also on the cards,? adds Suchetana, who has finished her graduation in political science and is now ?trying to give Aranyak a shape?.

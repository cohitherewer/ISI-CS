 Therapy hot seat amp; canvas for a cause

High-fliers 

with little time to visit the neighbourhood parlour or spa can chill in this hot 

seat. Osim International, a Singapore-based lifestyle product manufacturer, launched 

a massage chair in Calcutta on Tuesday.

 Voted invention of the year by Time magazine, Osim?s iSymphonic massage chair acts as your personal masseur and more, identifying the acupressure points in the body via an infrared sensor, and massaging the right spots. The ?intelligent? chair, priced at Rs 2.69 lakh, aids in relieving fatigue, improving blood circulation and easing muscle strain and stiffness.

Available at select outlets like Giani?s furniture 

studio on AJC Bose Road, the chair comes with four massage rollers on a swivel 

base, allowing kneading in normal and inverse directions.

 In the knead massage section, one can choose from the ?human touch? massage or the ?double knead? massage. The rhythmic pressure function in this system mimics the finger pressure of a real masseur. 

 The ?tapping massage? on the other hand helps soothe sore and stiff parts of the body. 

 The rollers in the chair can be programmed to target specific trouble spots or soothe the entire back area. There is also a function that combines dual roles like the tapping and kneading massage, for instance.

 The iSymphonic has other attractive features like an LCD screen, fully automatic reclining system, adjustable angles, extendible foot rest, auto timer, total remote-control and anti-bacterial leather upholstery covers. 

 To cut out the boredom factor, the chair comes with an in-built music system that generates beats in tandem with the vibrations you receive.

 ?The chair is a great investment for companies committed to providing recreation and stress alleviation schemes for their employees,? feels Shaily Grover, managing director, Osim India.

 The $ 287.4-million global giant has been maintaining a 20 to 30 per cent growth rate for the past five years in Singapore and hopes to make a sizeable impact in India.

 Osim International opened an exclusive outlet in Delhi in September last year and is eyeing a similar store in Calcutta ?as soon as possible?. 

 Charity art

 City artists are painting a picture of hope for tsunami survivors. An art camp and auction in aid of the victims, organised by the Lions Clubs International District 322B1, witnessed an enthusiastic response from the artist fraternity. 

 The two-day camp was inaugurated at the Calcutta Swimming Club by Lee Alison Sibley on Tuesday. The wife of the US consul-general in Calcutta painted a canvas on the spot with the help of artist Dhiraj Chowdhury.

 The themes ranged from Krishna, Mother and Child, Christ, the City of Hope, to portraits and glass paintings in oils, charcoal and acrylic.

 The paintings are finding ready buyers and bids are coming in from outside the country as well for the auction to be held on Wednesday. This will feature artists like Suvaprasanna, Shyamal Dutta Ray, Wasim Kapoor, Jogen Chowdhury, Kartick Pyne, Suhas Roy, Amitava Banerjee, Chandra Bhattacharya, Lalu Shaw, Prakash Karmakar, Partho Shaw, Arindam Chatterjee, Aditya Basak, Subrata Gangopadhyay, Jayshree Burman, Dipali Bhattacharya, Sanatan and Subhomita Dinda, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and Samir Aich.

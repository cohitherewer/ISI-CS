 Norms trip test centres 

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Many private agencies engaged in testing air and water pollution in the city lack the necessary infrastructure and technical knowhow prescribed by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board for carrying out the tests.

 This was revealed during a surprise visit conducted jointly by the Central and state pollution control boards at the laboratories of these agencies. 

 On the basis of the report filed by the joint inspection team, the state board has derecognised five agencies and directed them to equip themselves in keeping with the board guidelines.

 At the same time, the state board has turned down requests from three private agencies seeking recognition to carry out chemical examination of air and water samples. 

 ?The state pollution control board has the right to inspect any laboratory at any point of time without notice and if it is found that the laboratory is not equipped with proper facilities to analyse water and air samples, recognition may be withdrawn or suspended till the laboratory concerned upgrades its system,? asserted Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the board.

 ?The decision to derecognise the units was taken on the basis of a report submitted by a joint team of experts that had conducted surprise checks on the laboratories run by these agencies,? he added.

 The state pollution control board had recognised 15 private agencies for testing air and water samples in the state in 2003 under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Of the 15 agencies, 11 are located in Calcutta. 

 While engaging these agencies, the board had categorically told them that it was provisionally recognising them for a year and would renew their recognition on the basis of their performance. 

 ?We had also told them that if any of them failed to achieve satisfactory performance regarding testing of air and water samples, their recognition would be withdrawn,? senior law officer Mukherjee stressed.

 A scientist attached to the state pollution control board said the joint team had carried out a surprise visit in all the 11 agencies in Calcutta, to check whether they were following the state board?s norms on conducting tests.

 ?Most laboratories are following our guidelines, but some are violating them,? the scientist added.

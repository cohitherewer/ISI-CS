 Gabbar garb or Devdas despair

 FROM RAJESH KHANNAS BELL-BOTTOMS TO HRITHIK ROSHANS KAHO NAA... LOOK, THE OPTIONS ARE ENDLESS WHEN YOU WANT TO DRESS UP FOR A BOLLYWOOD THEME BASH. SHRADHA AGARWAL LISTS SOME OF THE MUCH-APED MAN STYLES

 Time it: A week in hand

 The look: Amjad Khan in Sholay

 Copy code: We say a week in hand purely for reasons hirsute! That unkempt look is definitely going to take a weeks work to acquire. Unkempt hair and that harsh beard? it must all be in place for the Gabbar Singh get-up. The clothes in this look are simple and a dash of the right accessories, all studded, will make the difference. 

 Designer Abhishek Dutta suggests a loose shirt left untidy and a pair of khaki trousers. Though all of this seems to be simple to ape, perfection lies in the finer details. The trousers should be box-pleated with lots of pockets. Look out for interesting enzyme washes and lots of stitching details, he says. Team these anti-fit trousers with an equally rough-and-tumble shirt. As for accessories ? think metal, think studs. Go for a thick belt and chunky bracelets, he adds.

 And finally, get hold of a willing Sambha and speak on?. Kitne aadmi thhe? Time it: Four days to go

 The look: Aamir Khan in Mangal Pandey: The Rising

 Copy code: Aamir Khan in this film has two distinct looks, but the famous moustache was the great binding factor. Long, curly hair and that wavy moustache, both had a standing of their own. But coming back to style basics, one can copy his looks with some prior shopping and planning. 

 With more and more guys turning towards fitness, the dhoti and white vest is one look that can be carried off by many, says mens wear designer Neha Sharaff. According to her, the military look is also topical to sport today. Mangal Pandeys army uniform is, in fact, a very trendy statement in itself. A smart red jacket teamed with a broad belt is all you need. Dont forget to wear those beads, all for that rustic charm. Time it: Two days to go

 The look: Shah Rukh Khan in Devdas 

 Copy code: A two-day stubble and a dukhi look on your face ? this is just the beginning of the Devdas demeanour. The easy-to-copy look is quite a cakewalk for the quintessential Bangali babu.

 Designer Snehasish Bhattacharya recommends a simple white dhoti and kurta, preferably addi. A great way to add more character to this look is to include sabutdana work on the edging of the kurta. Also, the period look will be complete with wrinkled sleeves. Pleat the dhoti perfectly and slip on Vidyasagar slippers to complete the picture. And yes, dont forget to carry that bottle! Slur on? 

 Time it: Last minute

 The look: Dev Anand in Hare Rama Hare Krishna 

 Copy code: The Dev Anand look is more about attitude and less to do with styling. Even if you get hold of regular clothes and shoes, carrying the head in that angle and speaking with that move shake is quite a feat.

 The basic look revolves around guru kurtas with closed Chinese collars and bell-bottom, flat-front trousers, says mens wear designer Medhavni Khaitan. A printed scarf tied around your neck is a must. The shirt should have large collars and big, inverted French cuffs. 

 Time it: Just after youve got a hot bod to show off

 The look: Salman Khan in each of his films

 Copy code: This look is perhaps the easiest to ape provided, of course, all those million hours spent in the gym arent added up. Shirtless Salmans, if you please, come in many varieties and styles.

 Choose from the oh jaane jaana statement that involves an extra tight pair of denims or the Mujhse Shaadi Karogi look that has him in cycling shorts.

 Accessories for the Salman look vary widely too. You can pick from pink belts, multi-coloured beach towels, cool sunglasses and funky watches. Style your mane and your beard too. The finishing touch ? that accent from nowhere is a must!

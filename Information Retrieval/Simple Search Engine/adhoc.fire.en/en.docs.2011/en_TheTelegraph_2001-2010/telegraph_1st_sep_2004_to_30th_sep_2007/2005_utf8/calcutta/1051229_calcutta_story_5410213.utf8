 Parking space to swell

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The civic authorities are could allow parking on both sides of certain arteries and setting up of parking lots on roads that don?t have one.

 ?I believe finding parking space is a major headache in Calcutta,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said on Wednesday. ?Taking advantage of the shortage of space and lack of police vigil, illegal parking lots are being set up across the city.?

 The authorities earn around Rs 4 crore by leasing out 52 parking lots. An equal amount is earned by those who man the illegal parking zones, mostly criminals enjoying the patronage of police and politicians. ?Regrettably, part of the parking business is run by rowdies,? Bhattacharya added. 

 Usually, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) earmarks one side of a road for parking. The other side is supposed to remain free for smooth flow of traffic. But a section of policemen, in connivance with local criminals, allow parking on both sides.

 ?Police are insisting that we allow parking on both sides to break the cop-criminal nexus. Also, the city needs more parking space,? said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, mayoral council member in charge of parking.

 The authorities are also worried over reports that attendants at authorised parking lots force users to pay more than the stipulated charge.

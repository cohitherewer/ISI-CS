 Cops take murder trail to Kalyani

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A team of officers from Taltala police station left for Kalyani on Wednesday in search of four persons who had recently worked at the residence of Dipti D?Cruz and are believed to behind the widow?s murder on Sunday. 

 Police obtained the lead while interrogating Arambagh-based carpenter Sheikh Saifuddin, who was detained on Monday night.

 ?We want to question all those who had worked at the Patra Lane residence over the past few months. This is not a simple act of murder for immediate gains,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 Sleuths interrogating Saifuddin, who has been associated with the D?Cruz family for years, said he is a hard nut to crack. According to them, the carpenter has revealed that Dipti had bought a bakery in Taltala through him for her son Saroj.

 ?Ever since the deal was struck, the lady suffered from a sense of fear. She had even asked her son?s friends not to disclose where Saroj was studying medicine,? said an investigating officer. 

 On Wednesday evening, the D?Cruz family held a small prayer ceremony at the Taltala house.

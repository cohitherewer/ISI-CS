 Mobiles snatched

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four youths snatched cell phones from five students of Jadavpur University on Thursday evening in a crowded spot in front of Deshapriya Park. The four fled before the students realised what had happened.

 Although the students registered a complaint with Tollygunge police station immediately afterwards, no arrest has been made.

 The theft occurred after the five students ? three of them from Midnapore ? came out of a cinema off Deshapriya Park. 

 All five had taken admission this year and four of them were carrying cell phones, said Rajesh Subarno, deputy commissioner (special) of the detective department.

 An officer of Tollygunge police station said the four conmen, in their late 20s, stopped the students on the road and charged them with making blank calls to a young woman late at night.

 All the five students were taken aback, and though they refused to accept blame, they did not challenge the conmen boldly enough. 

 The four youths then told them that they wanted to check their mobile phone call lists and phone book to verify whether the students had called the woman or whether her number was saved in their phones.

 To prove that they did not have anything to do with the blank calls, all four students handed over their cell phones to the conmen, police said. The four youths then spent a few minutes searching the phones? call memory lists. 

 Suddenly, two of them told the students to leave the spot immediately, as a number of people were looking for them, and if caught they would be handed over to the police.

 The students became nervous, and the four conmen fled.

 Control of console

 - Training 

trio for DJ wannabes

 Mixing music and counting moolah. Pursuing passions and building careers.

 GenY is looking at disc jockeying as one of the most ?hot and happening? career options these days. Proof of the rising demand for the profession and the growing need for formal training lies in the mushrooming of three deejay (DJ) schools in less than a month.

 ?For the past two or three years, I was getting numerous requests to coach wannabe DJs. I did train some in my personal capacity. But when the number of requests grew, I decided to open up a school,? says DJ Lloyd, who has opened Lloyd?s DJ Workshop, on Camac Street. 

 ?People have become more broad-minded about this profession. If you have a passion for music, this is the best way to express it and it is financially rewarding, too,? he adds.

 Keeping the demand for alternative careers in mind, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society has also spun out classes on disc jockeying.

 ?We had a workshop on disc jockeying a couple of months ago, that drew a tremendous response. Students who are not very good in academics can always fall back on disc jockeying as a career. So, we decided to introduce it on a permanent basis,? said Bhavna Hemani, executive secretary of the college.

 The college has got hold of high-grade equipment and a DJ box has been built in the auditorium for trainees to practise. ?Only knowing music does not make a good disc jockey. The various technicalities have to be understood. This is where a formally-trained DJ scores over a rookie,? says DJ Harish, of Dublin fame, who would be part of the teaching faculty at Bhawanipur College.

 The course is open to students of the college, but only 25 aspirants have been shortlisted to ensure equal and maximum attention for all.

 DJ Akash was flooded with applications once he opened ARD Training, in Park Circus. ?I handpicked 25 students who I thought would be able to do justice to the profession. Though you don?t have to be an Einstein to be a DJ, there is some basic criteria that one has to meet,? says he.

 According to most industry insiders, one has to be passionate about music and should have the ability to gauge the crowd and its mood. ?No matter how well you play, if you misjudge the people on the dance floor, all efforts will end in disaster,? warns Lloyd.

 While Bhawanipur College and ARD Training will take students through the basics of sound equalising and mixing of turntables and judging the crowd, DJ Lloyd promises to teach them how to mix and compose original music.

 Control of the console comes at a cost. Though for the students of Bhawanipur College the course is free (they only have to give a security deposit of Rs 5,000 ,which will be returned after the completion of the course), ARD Training charges Rs 15,000 and Lloyd?s DJ Workshop demands Rs 25,000.

 ?But if you are able to do even three shows after the training, the total amount of investment will be recovered,? explains DJ Lloyd.

 No wonder students are not afraid of investing time and money. ?The night life is booming and so is the night club business. Some sweat now will result in sweet success later,? smiles first-year student Sweta Bothra, a DJ-to-be.

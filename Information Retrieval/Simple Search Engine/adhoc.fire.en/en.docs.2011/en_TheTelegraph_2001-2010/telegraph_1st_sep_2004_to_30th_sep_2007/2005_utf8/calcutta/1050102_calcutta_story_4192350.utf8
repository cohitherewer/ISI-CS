The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wishlist 2005

 Rue that important meeting you 

 missed because you were stuck in a roadblock? Remember that 

 long weekend when you were dying to get away from the din 

 but ended up in front of the TV at home? Still raging over 

 the days spent in vain at a government office waiting, pleading, 

 begging for the babu to do his day?s work?

 If wishes were horses, Calcutta 

 would have a smooth ride. But with optimism being the buzzword 

 of the first weekend of 2005, Metro on Sunday takes 

 a look at a few things we citizens crave and conjure, desire 

 and deserve this New Year?

 No bandh, no roadblocks

 When Calcutta starts going to 

 work on a bandh day, it?s time to take the hint. The city 

 spoke in 2004, loud and crystal clear, with bandhs that 

 just didn?t succeed in keeping shutters down at work or 

 footfalls low at play.

 If Bengal means business, the best way to show it is by saying no to coercive forces that compel the Calcuttan to stay off work.

 As for traffic-stopper rallies, court and media pressure notwithstanding, hitting the streets to clog the streets remains the most convenient form of political protest.

 So, all we want is for Buddha (the poet) and Mamata (the painter) to bury their political differences for a brief moment and sign an MoU to end roadblock and bandh raj. If they don?t want to be seen together at either Writers? Buildings or the Trinamul office, may we suggest the historic ? and harried ? KC Das as venue for the bittersweet meeting (minus the michhil), with rasogollas keeping them company.

 Impossible it may be, but let?s 

 get greedy with our first wish for 2005: for the sake of 

 the people, can the politicians please unite to promise: 

 ?Bandh, cholchhe na, cholbe na?.

 A little concern for clean 

 air

 Leaving your cigarette-smoke filled party for a bit of fresh air? You?ll have to head out of the city.

 With the rise in levels of vehicular pollution being proportionate to government apathy, this is a city of burning eyes, coughing throats and choking lungs.

 We wheezing, asthmatic mummies are desperately seeking an inhaler, but there is not one in sight.

 Yet, all that is needed is a little honest effort. If other cities are doing it, what stops the Bengal government from cleaning up its act and the air we breathe? Sloth (cholchhe, cholbe) at one level, selfishness (transport lobbies, vote bank etc etc) at another.

 Without ripping pages out of Ripley?s, let?s put down our basic environmental demands:

 Put in place 100 tailpipe emission testing centres with 

 proper machine and manpower

 Introduce tamper-proof auto-emission hologram on windscreen

 Ensure LPG switchover for all autorickshaws

 Roll out attractive exchange offer for old commercial vehicles

 Don?t take the Calcutta commuter for a ride

 Work culture makes a debut

 A wag at the College Street coffee-house had once famously commented that a Calcuttan?s upward mobility can only be measured by how much he can move up in the queue ? for roti, kapda, makaan and all else. The fact that Calcuttans seem to live in ?line? ? waiting for everything from basic utilities to fancy facilities ? has more to do with a faulty service supply chain than anything else. The curious part is that the work culture (or rather its lack) is not just restricted to slowcoach babudom. Corporate pockets, too, have fallen prey to the Calcutta chromosome.

 So, from Writers? Buildings to 

 new-age business corridors, from electricity supply to driving 

 licence? all we demand is more work than words, more files 

 being finished with than cups of tea being gulped down, 

 and just a little bit of conscientiousness from the workforce, 

 public and private. Time for a dream debut?

 Plug potholes, plan traffic

 Ouch! The most-used monosyllable for Calcuttans on the move in 2004. We said it every time the vehicle hit a pothole ? and that was anything between every second and every 300 seconds, depending on location. Some escaped with a teeth chatter or a bone jar; several others went down with bad back or pain in the neck.

 What we ask of those who pave (or maybe don?t) our pathways this year is, stop bickering about whose pothole it is, anyway. It?s not for the commuter to be told whether it?s the responsibility of the CMC or the CTC, ABC or XYZ to make the roads of this modern metro motorable.

 Also, flyovers are fine, but can 

 we have a few city planners sitting in on the projects, 

 please? With the approach and exit of each flyover turning 

 into jam junctions, the need for a minimum amount of foresight 

 couldn?t be more glaring.

 A weekend getaway that rocks

 Santiniketan is house full, Sunderbans is a washout, Digha is dead. So where does the weary Calcuttan drive down to for a bit break?

 Our coast may not have the magic of Goa, but it doesn?t have to be the unimaginative blob of nothingness it is now. Since we don?t want to tamper with the delicate ecosystem of our mangrove forests, we would like to point our tourism department to boring old Digha.

 Gambling may sound like an evil 

 word to most, but nothing will draw the tourists like a 

 casino. And like Goa, they can keep it strictly above board, 

 restricting the roulette and slot machines to a liner on 

 the water, so as not to sully our soil. Also wanted: proper 

 hospitality addresses, proper food stops, non-stop music? 

 Essentially, a cool place to go to.

 City as a music stage

 That brings us to the need for music, here there and everywhere. If music on the streets be the flavour of the new year, play on.

 Consider this: there?s still only 

 one pub in the city where bands perform on a regular basis, 

 and barring the odd-Bangla band concert from time to time 

 at Nazrul Mancha or Science City, there?s hardly enough 

 music going around. Big and small acts ? from Rolling Stones 

 to Elton John to Bryan Adams ? giving Calcutta the miss 

 has become the rule but while we wait for those distant 

 stars, why not create some stars of our own, by giving them 

 regular platforms to rock?

 Midnight munch amp; movies

 With Calcutta?s night owls making themselves heard and seen at discs and lounges around town in ?04, it is a wonder that most of the city shuts down well before Cinderella hour. Big boys, a certain Mr Imran Khan had pronounced (on his T-shirt) decades ago, play at night. And for a city in growing-up mode, we can surely urge private enterprise to have a heart for the hungry (and broke) stuck in the twilight zone between midnight and morn. Also, with super-screens sprouting, how about a midnight movie to beat a hard day?s night?

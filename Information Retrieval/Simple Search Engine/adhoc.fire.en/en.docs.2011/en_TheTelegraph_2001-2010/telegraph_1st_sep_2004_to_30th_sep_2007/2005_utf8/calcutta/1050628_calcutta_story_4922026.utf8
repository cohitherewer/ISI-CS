 Ally bullies CPM to concede post

 The CPM on Monday buckled under pressure from the RSP and offered it the post of deputy mayor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and a berth in the mayoral council.

 Left Front sources said RSP?s Kalyan Mukherjee, elected from a ward in north Calcutta, would be deputy mayor. In the last board, the post was held by Meena Devi Purohit of the BJP.

 The RSP demanded the post on the strength of its six councillors, the highest in the Left Front after the CPM, which has won 58 seats. The CPM was reluctant to concede the demand, but had to finally give in at the Left Front meeting.

 In a related development, the Front rejected mayor-designate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya?s plea to reduce the size of the mayoral council. ?The council will have 10 members, seven of whom will be from the CPM. Of the other partners ? RSP, CPI and Forward Bloc ? will have one representative each,? Front chairman Biman Bose announced.

 He, however, refused to divulge the names of the proposed members, saying the Front would finalise them on July 1.

 The CPM rejected the pleas by smaller partners, like the Marxist Forward Bloc, Biplabi Bangla Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal, for a berth in the council. The three parties have won a seat each.

 The seven CPM members in the council will share among themselves the key departments of law, survey of land, records, sewerage, solid waste management, Entally workshop, roads and buildings, water supply, slum development, building and licence, market, education and information, and parks and gardens.

 The mayor will be in charge of the general administration and finance and accounts departments.

 Subodh De, Forward Bloc councillor from north Calcutta, is likely to be in charge of health. The CPI will get the sewerage and drainage department, while the RSP candidate will look after the training centres, water supply to ships, environment, street lighting and electricity.

 Apart from the mayor?s post, the CPM will get the posts of chairman and chief whip of the Left Front municipal party.

 CPM insiders said the councillors shortlisted for entry into the mayoral council are Amal Mitra (Jadavpur), Tuhin Bera and Snehansu Roy (east Calcutta), Iqbal Gazi (Garden Reach), Nirmal Mukherjee (Behala), Kanai Ganguly or Goutam Das (north Calcutta) and Ruma Saha (central Calcutta), Archana Bhattacharjee (Jadavpur) and Rupa Bagchi (north Calcutta).

 Nirmal Mukherjee, sources said, is likely to be chairman.

 The law and the survey departments, which the CPM has kept for itself, used to be looked after by deputy mayor Mani Sanyal (CPI) in the last Left Front board, headed by mayor Prasanta Chatterjee. Of the other portfolios the party will control, market and lighting were looked after by the RSP. 

 UDA stand: The United Democratic Alliance, formed by the Congress and Subrata Mukherjee?s Unnayan Congress Mancha, decided on Monday to back the Trinamul Congress if it fields a candidate for the mayoral post. The alliance was formed after Mukherjee broke away from the Trinamul and floated the Mancha. 

 ?We shall back the Trinamul?s nominee despite our differences with the party,? said Pradesh Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya. 

 Mayoral election: The election to the mayor?s post will be held on July 5, state government officials said on Monday. Candidates willing to contest will have to file their papers on July 4. The councillors will be administered the oath of office the same day.

 Seize the moment for fun fest

 Action on the stage at Carpe Diem, IIM Calcuttas 

annual fest, on Saturday. The three-day fest had competitive events, performances 

by fusion band Indian Ocean and a special staging of Mahesh Dattanis Dance 

Like a Man, starring Lillete Dubey, Suchitra Pillai and Joy Sengupta. Picture

There are fests and there are fests, but when it comes 

to ingenuity and creativity, IIM Calcutta wins hands down, as was evident at Carpe 

Diem, the annual cultural extravaganza of the institute, where 15 colleges interacted 

in the true spirit of fellowship from January 14 to 16. 

 A result of the brainstorming by the dramatics society, choreography society and JBS Baro C, the music club of the institute, Carpe Diem, literally translating to ?seize the moment?, was all about letting inhibitions go and giving wings to the inner spirit. 

 The one-of-its-kind festival kickstarted with speeches by the chief guest from IBM, director of the institute Shekhar Chaudhary and faculty adviser for the fest Prof Leena Chatterjee.

 The speeches were followed by a play in English staged by the dramatic cell, Inherit the Wind, written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. 

 The following day saw the colleges battle it out at the preliminary rounds of the group dance competition, basketball, Alaap (Hindi solo singing) and Aria (English solo singing). The most eagerly awaited event of the day was Mish Mash, which saw contestants flaunting their smooth moves to continuously changing music with unknown partners. Bhawanipur College bagged the top honours in the event.

 The rock band competition, in which amateur rock bands from all over the city participated, saw Superfuzz singing their way into the hearts of the audience. Later, a fantastic dance performance by Beat Busters kept the spirits soaring for the next day?s jamboree. 

 On the final day, some wonderful dramatic talents were on view at the street theatre competition. IIT Kharagpur emerged champion in the event. Bhawanipur College proved their superiority once again in the solo and group dance competitions. Antakshari, Dumb Charades and acoustic music competition Arpeggio were also held during the day.

 The performance of Dance Like a Man was one of the highlights of the final day. A host of screen and stage stars, including Lillete Dubey, Joy Sengupta, Vijay Crishna and Suchitra Pillai, acted in the play, which enthralled the audience with its rich mix of humour, drama and insight.

 But it was the guest performances in the evening that everyone was waiting for. The first musical notes were struck by Orient Express, which took the stage at the institute parking lot amidst raucous cheering. They were followed by Indian Ocean, which regaled the audience for over an hour.

 The fun and frenzy spilled over to a night-long party, where local DJs matched the pulse of the hugely energetic crowd.

 The ?creative, cultural celebration of youth? was one of its kind in many ways, as Aparna Shahi, head of the choreography society put it: ?Carpe Diem is perhaps the only fest where the talent clubs converge to host a truly cosmopolitan celebration, with participation and enjoyment scoring way ahead of competition and rivalry.?

 Here?s hoping Carpe Diem only becomes bigger and better in years to come.

 In harmony

 The pressure of academics more often than not takes away valuable time from a child which he could otherwise have utilised to pursue a passion. Thus, tomorrow?s singing sensation turns out to be a banker, limiting his skills to the bathroom or the odd house party. 

 ?There is little that one can do about this,? feels Mallika Sen, whose seven-year-old son goes to a leading school in the city and is unable to squeeze in more than an hour for violin lessons once a week.

 And yet, Mallika considers herself lucky to have actually been able to discover at the right time her son Satyaki?s interest in music. Most parents either never figure out their children?s inclination towards music or their flair for other extracurricular activities or prefer to ignore it in the face of academic pressure. 

 Others insist on the child going for a tabla lesson or a dance class simply because all the kids in the neighbourhood are doing the same. ?Taking my daughter to her Bharatanatyam class was a nightmare for both her and me. It was much later that I realised she had no interest in dance and wanted to play professional cricket instead,? says Gauri Chowdhury whose daughter later went on to represent her school in state-level competitions in basketball and cricket. 

 Perhaps a cure is at hand for these mix-ups in terms of inclination (or the lack of it) towards music. A first-of-its-kind school is trying to gauge the sense of rhythm and melody in children between the ages of three and seven years. 

 ?These kind of classes are very common abroad. But in our country parents still don?t take children too seriously, especially in their knack for music,? says the man behind the effort Rajiv Basu, director of Tarang, a school of contemporary dance in New Alipore. 

 The first semester of the course begins January 15, ?The course structure has been divided into various segments like performing activities and playing games in a particular rhythm, trying out some instrument and things like that,? explains Rajiv, who has roped in singer Usha Uthup to design the course content. 

 ?After six months, we will give the child a report card by which parents will know if at all they should send the child for music classes. Also, if yes, then what would be the best option for the child,? adds Rajiv. 

 The report card, according to Joyita Basu, a member of the school management, is not to breed competition among them. ?We just want to assure the parents that their children are not wasting their time at the course,? she says.

 Lecture on learning

 On Friday, January 14, the Kamala Lectureship was revived after a hiatus of almost 24 years, at the auditorium of Centre for Social Sciences and Humanities, Calcutta University, Alipore campus. 

 Karan Singh, Member of Parliament, delivered a lecture on the holistic philosophy of ?Four Pillars of Learning?. He stressed on learning to know through Gyanayoga, learning to do through Karmayoga, learning to live together through the practice of moral values and learning to be, to realise one?s full potential through continuous development of one?s personality. 

 This approach to life and education was developed by Singh and his co-research scholars during their stint with the UNESCO International Commission for Education in the 21st Century. 

 Singh referred to the teachings of Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore. The Nobel laureate, in fact, had delivered the Kamala lecture in 1930, as pointed out by Prof Asis Kumar Banerjee, vice-chancellor of Calcutta University. Among the other dignitaries present on the occasion were Chittatosh Mookerjee and Pratap Chandra Chunder.

Telling tales

It was a memorable day for the winners of the TTIS 

Annual Short Story Competition 2004-2005, as they assembled in Crossword recently. 

Having won this prestigious story writing contest, the 12 students ? Anwesha, 

Sohini, Goldy, Sourojit, Snehashis, Abhirup, Bondita, Nilanjana, Somrita, Manali, 

Trisha and Aniket ? from various schools, had come to the bookstore to read out 

their prize-winning stories and receive their prizes. 

 The event began with the prize-giving ceremony, with the winners being handed over huge gift packets comprising books from Crossword and souvenirs from TTIS, including coffee mugs and certificates.

 The winners then read out their fascinating stories. While Goldy interviewed Osama bin Laden in her story, Anwesha managed to scare a bunch of ghosts. Sourojit, on the other hand, met Ruskin Bond, while Sohini managed to take Casper back home. 

 Manali met some of her favourite literary characters and Bondita turned into a chameleon. Every story was worth the applause it received from the audience, gathered to hear the stories. The event ended with tea, soft drinks and cookies, arranged by Crossword at its Coffee Pai outlet.

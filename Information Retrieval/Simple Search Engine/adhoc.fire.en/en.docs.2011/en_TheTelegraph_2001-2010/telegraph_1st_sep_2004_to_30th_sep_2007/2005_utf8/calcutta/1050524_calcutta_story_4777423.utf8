 Extortion, investment in dance bars and matching steps with bar girls was a routine affair for him. But luck ran out on Gopal Tiwari when he was netted by detective department sleuths in Hyderabad on Sunday.

 ?Tiwari was produced before the chief metropolitan magistrate today and remanded in police custody till June 3,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department, on Monday.

 According to police, Tiwari has been running his extortion racket for the past four years from Hyderabad, where he lives with his wife and two children. A hunt for the 32-year-old ? wanted for seven murder attempts and extortion ? began after he and his accomplices fired at Pramod Kumar Sharma, a 21-year-old, in Burrabazar on March 30, 2005.

 A team, comprising deputy commissioner (special), detective department Damayanti Sen and anti-rowdy squad officers, was set up. 

 ?Through his city associates, we learnt that two days after the Burrabazar incident, Tiwari had left for Hyderabad. The associates also told us that he frequented sleaze bars in Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad,? said Singh. Teams from Lalbazar visited the bars and found out that Tiwari invested lakhs in them and owned a bar in Hyderabad. 

 A group of four sleuths, led by inspector Sadhan Sinha, left for Hyderabad on May 15. They located two rented flats and a hotel where Tiwari would put up. The fourth hideout was traced on Sunday afternoon and the detectives swooped on the apartment around 3 pm. ?He was resting on a couch and we arrested him immediately,? an official said.

 Tiwari?s preliminary interrogation has also revealed him having close links with cricket bookies in Hyderabad and Mumbai.

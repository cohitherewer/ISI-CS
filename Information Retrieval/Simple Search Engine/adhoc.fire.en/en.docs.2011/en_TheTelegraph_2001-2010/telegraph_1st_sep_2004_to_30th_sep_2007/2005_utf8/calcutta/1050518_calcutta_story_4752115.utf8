The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scrap order opens path of protest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s move to phase out vehicles manufactured prior to 1990 from the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) has sent tremors through the transport lobby.

 Over 6,700 autorickshaws, 9,500 taxis, 1,100 minibuses, 7,400 buses and close to 50,000 trucks, minitrucks and goods vehicles plying in the CMA fall in the pre-1990 age group.

 The reaction was the sharpest from truck and bus operators, as they cannot switch to LPG ? an option available to taxis and auto-rickshaws ? and prove their roadworthiness.

 Sadhan Das, general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Owners? Syndicate, said his union would move court against the government move. 

 ?In a country like ours, it is not possible to buy new buses priced at around Rs 12 lakh,? he argued.

 Das had been party to an earlier case in the high court last year, when transporters had slammed the brakes on the government bid to scrap vehicles dating back to 1975.

 Satyajit Majumdar, general secretary of Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators? Association, met transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury at Writers? Buildings on Tuesday and urged him not to go ahead with the phase-out. If talks failed, a legal move was an option, warned Majumdar.

 Madan Mitra of Progressive Taximen?s Union, termed the government?s decision ?useless? and said it would never be able to implement it. ?Trouble is inevitable and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty will witness a strike unprecedented in his political career,? warned Mitra.

 The six taxi unions in CMA will assess the situation on Wednesday in a meeting of the Joint Action Committee. Convener Subhash Kaushik said: ?If the only reason for the phase-out is pollution, then the government should allow us three years? time. Alternatively, it should allow us to buy old engines from Mullickbazar and not insist on new engines.?

 Kaushik went on to outline protest plans: ?We shall stall all work and revenue collection at the PVD. We will hold protests at their gates.?

 The All India Motor Transport Congress Coordination Committee has decided to discuss before disrupt. K.K. Bansal, vice-chairman of the committee?s east zone, said half of the 3,000 trucks entering Calcutta every day would fall into the pre-1990 bracket. So, the committee would first petition the ministry and only then call for a strike.

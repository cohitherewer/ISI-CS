 Denim diktat

 Slim-fit is in, boot-leg is out; turn-ups are trendy, metallic add-ons are chic. Riddhima Seal finds out what rsquo;s hot on the jeans front

 (From top) Turn-up and slim-fit jeans are a current rage; the Red Loop denim line from Levis 

 Skirts, parallels, kurtis, churidars? your wardrobe witnesses certain changes every passing season, keeping with the latest fashion forecast. Alterations you make to your closet for the perfect style statement may be endless, but over the years ? even decades, for some ? the one thing that has held its place of pride is that pair of denims.

 Whatever the season, whatever the occasion, this piece of garment continues to find favour with people of all age groups and profiles.

 Ask designer Malini Ramani. What I like most about denims is its versatility. Be it a baggy fit for relaxing at home or the low-rise, stretch-fit ones to be worn with short tops to a party, there is simply no end to how you can add to your sex appeal with just a simple pair of denims.

 GoodLife checks out whats hot in terms of cuts and colours on the denim front this season.

 Colour call

 The latest colour offerings like bottle greens and flaming reds are flying off the racks, but blue remains the eternal favourite.

 Says Steve Castledine, vice president, Levis Brand, Asia Pacific Division: Denims and the colour blue seem to be associated with each other naturally. So while the more adventurous ones are going for slightly different shades, majority of people over the world still prefer shades of blue ? light or dark.

 Enzyme-washed dual tones are very very hot, as opposed to the monochromes. And if elegance is what you are looking for, nothing beats a pair of denims in its original blue teamed with a white upper.

 Lee, which launched its premium X-Line collection for winter, is, however, bringing a lot of colour and warmth for the youth this season. You generally associate winter with a lot of colour, fun and of course parties. Hence our collection is youthful and funky, something that party animals and college-goers would love, says Chakor Jain, business head, Lee India.

 Fabric facts

 Though stretch still rules the fabric list, the focus is more and more on comfort. Says Janani Subramaniam, business head, Wrangler: The idea is to ensure complete free movement. It is extremely important for people on the move. Bi-weft fabrics, multi-count broken twills, sandwich denims are some of our latest offerings.

 The Red Loop Fall Winter Collection by Levis is a take on authentic vintage denims, the finish in this collection ranging from mildly worn to distressed, darned and completely busted.

 Explains Castledine: The collection is characterised by a unique sandwiched red loop and an imported silk-linen patch vis-?-vis the characteristic Levis leather patch. Other features include pure copper rivets, aged Levis buttons and a double needle-out seam. With Red Loop we have also moved away from the five core pocket styles to contemporary stylised denims that would make for perfect party wear. 

 The fabric is completely in line with international trends, ranging from linen blend denims to snub denims and exclusive stretch denims. 

 Lees trendy collection, on the other hand, is a dynamic mix of fabrics ? either green selvedge or with green thread over lock at the side seam.

 Straight cut

 early, its time to move out of the flared variety. Slim-fit is totally in. Pair them with sexy tops, pile on a jacket and youre all set to rock for the evening. Says Subramaniam: Straight leg seems to be in internationally for the youth segment ? especially the low-waist, straight-leg body. This is especially great for the turn-up look on jeans. For girls, the look is tight and slim on the body with a mild boot for a long-legged look.

 Malini, too, is all for the slim look. Nothing helps you show off your newly-toned body better than a pair of slim fits. Wear them with high heels and see the difference. They even make short legs appear much longer, says the designer.

 Slim-fits are selling like hot cakes the world over. Everyone wants to own a pair of this sexy-looking garment designed to show off your curves. And they definitely help you look far slimmer, says Castledine.

 Final flourish

 Say fond farewell to the plain-looking pair. Bling is clearly in with studs, enamelled rivets, crystals, sequins, and exposed zips to add metallic sheen to your denim, feels Subramaniam. Printing, badges, contrast inner waistbands, hand-embroidery can also give your pair the extra glam factor.

 This does not mean that there are no takers for the lived-in look. This faded look continues to be hot and are just about perfect for holidays. Finishes and wash treatments have been designed to accentuate the effect. And with a plain pullover, it gives you the just-out-of-bed ruffled look that is oh-so-cool, says Castledine.

 Pinch marks on the waistband and leg pockets of your denims, raisin-treated crumpling, localised tinting also make for great style statements in the faded look variety, feels Jain of Lee.

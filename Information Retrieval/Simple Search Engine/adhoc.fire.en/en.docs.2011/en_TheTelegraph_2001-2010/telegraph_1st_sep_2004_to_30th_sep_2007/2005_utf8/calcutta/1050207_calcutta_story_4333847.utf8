The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The food stalls at the Calcutta Book Fair this year are charging exorbitant 

prices for junk food that is easily available elsewhere at a much lower price. 

The stall-owners seem to be taking advantage of the fact that visitors do not 

have any option but to buy from them within the fair premises. Also, there is 

a severe dearth of toilets. Many visitors are relieving themselves in a nearby 

pond, adding to the unhygienic surroundings. The organisers should look into the 

matter. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake. 

 LIC frequently makes various claims through advertisements and yet doesn?t 

seem to succeed in providing relatively small services without a hitch. Of late, 

due to some technical problem, almost every branch is not accepting premium from 

customers who had initially registered with another branch. So, we have to trudge 

all the way to the original branch just to pay the premium due. Shouldn?t the 

top bosses of LIC pay a little more attention to this part of the service before 

making grand plans?

 Arunava Choudhury, Keyatala Road. 

 Most banks in the city chain together the collapsible gate at the entrance 

of their offices, keeping space barely enough for a person of average build to 

pass through. While I agree that it is done for security reasons, it might not 

be very helpful in case of an emergency. Should a fire break out, the customers 

and also the employees will find it very difficult to vacate the premises. Alternative 

security arrangements should be made to avoid this risk. 

 Chameli Pal, Batanagar.

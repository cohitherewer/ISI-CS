 Calcutta has improved a lot? Every time I come, I see new buildings, roads, flyovers and malls? But the lives of these children remain the same. They are as talented as my friends in Washington DC, but spend the day doing menial chores.

 Fourteen-year-old Turjo Chakraborty was shocked at the realisation on his annual visit to the city from the United States. 

 And as a consequence, Pritam, Kanchan, Ranu and their likes, who live on pavements and in slums of Bagbazar, have found a mastermoshai who spends one-and-a-half hours every day initiating them into the world of letters.

 The ?students? are provided with free books by Turjo?s parents, who have decided to sponsor the education of one of them.

 Every morning, a group of children between 10 and 16 years gathers in a makeshift room on a footpath off Khirod Bidyabinod Avenue, where the 10th grader from Flint Hill School, Washington DC, takes classes from 8 am to 9.30 am.

 Turjo?s brush with Calcutta is restricted to the few weeks of the vacation he spends here with parents Pulok and Sweta. He was five when he left his Baranagar residence for the US, where his engineer father works as a strategic consultant in IT to the government. The family lives on Rock Ridge Road, Herndon, Virginia.

 This year?s vacation turned out to be different for Pulok and Sweta, when Turjo expressed a desire to ?do something? for children who have none to care about their childhood.

 ?Every time I passed through the area, I saw children of my age playing around or doing menial chores. I wanted to do something for them, but did not know where to begin. I told my father, who contacted a social worker and a school was arranged,? said Turjo, unexpectedly fluent in Bengali.

 ?Attendance was thin initially, but picked up in a few days. This is my country and they are my friends. I am only helping them in whatever way I can,? he added.

 Turjo is also trying to convince his friends in the US to join in his effort. ?These children are as talented, if not more, as my friends. A lot of time and money are wasted on meaningless things. We should rather try to do something meaningful,? he pointed out.

 D. Ashis, the social worker who helped Turjo set up the school, said: ?We need more youngsters like him. The parents of Turjo?s students were sceptical of the school, but had to change their mind seeing his commitment.?

 Ranu Mondol, one of the students, admitted that she had been reluctant to join the school. But now she is enjoying the experience. ?I am learning English, Bengali and mathematics? The morning session suits me as I have a lot of work to do all day,? she said. 

 ?Impressed? by his son?s initiative, Turjo?s father said: ?We have decided to sponsor the education of one of the students, Pritam Roy, who is very meritorious.?

 The invisible king

 Mere physical beauty is no match for the beauty and strength of human character. This is the theme of the Blind Opera production, Raja, directed by Subhashis Gangopadhyay. Written by Rabindranath Tagore, the play is staged as a series of fast-paced, dramatic incidents, with a rapid unfolding of the plot. It begins on a note of exciting anticipation with the king (whom nobody, not even the queen, has ever seen), asking the queen to identify him amongst the crowd of revellers on the evening of the festival of Holi. However, the queen, a worshipper of beauty, is misled by an imposter dressed in finery. She is impressed by his looks and sends him flowers. Meanwhile, the king of Kanchi has the palace garden set on fire, with a motive of abducting the queen. In the ensuing confusion, when the real king goes to rescue the queen, she identifies and catches a glimpse of him, only to be repulsed by his hideous features. She returns to her father?s home, and he arranges a swayamvar for her many royal suitors. But before the ceremony, all of them are defeated in a battle by the king, who then leaves for an unknown destination. On learning this, the queen realises her folly and repents, and finally goes out in search of her husband.

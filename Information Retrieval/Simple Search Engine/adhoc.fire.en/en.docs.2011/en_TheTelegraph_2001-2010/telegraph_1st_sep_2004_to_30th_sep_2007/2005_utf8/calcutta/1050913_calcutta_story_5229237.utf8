The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clicks don?t count for books

 - Lack of awareness makes city buyer a laggard in virtual marketplace

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 He may be a bookworm who sets aside a large share of his monthly expenditure for reading matter, but when it comes to buying books online, the Calcuttan?s clicks just don?t count.

 Research agency KSA Technopak?s recent Consumer Outlook Survey had found Calcuttans spending the highest on books and music. A study by Internet and Mobile Association of India has now presented quite a different picture of the city book-buyer in the virtual marketplace.

 Calcutta lags behind Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai, accounting for a mere four per cent of online book sales. 

 The city?s performance is only marginally better in music and movies, ranking third and fourth, respectively. The sole saving grace when it comes to the written word: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sales nudged the city up to number three.

 ?Lack of awareness is one of the key reasons. Online retailers are not communicating enough to offline buyers,? observes Preeti Desai, president of the association. ?And transactions in Calcutta through debit and credit cards are lower than some other metros, anyway.?

 Agrees Gautam Jatia of Landmark: ?There?s little publicity for online booksellers here. As for card transactions, our stores in Chennai and Bangalore do much better.?

 Online bookseller Fabmall.com holds a slightly different view. ?Though we get orders every day from Calcutta, our top cities are Bangalore, Mumbai and Chennai simply because we have been able to penetrate better in these cities,? says K. Vaitheeswaran, chief operating officer of Fabmall, which claims to stock 20 million titles.

 Chennai-based Fabmall has plans of increasing its Calcutta presence in the next ?two to three months?, after putting together ?a decent collection of Bengali books and authors?. The regional shelf moves fast, affirms Sidharth Pansari of Crossword, and so the online gap must be plugged with more Bengali books on offer. 

 Cost-effective tools, such as email marketing, search marketing and direct debit tie-ups with banks, can help the numbers grow in Calcutta, suggests Desai.

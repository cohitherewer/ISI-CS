The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Mayor? mulls relief on property tax

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Outgoing mayor Subrata Mukherjee had announced during his tenure a moratorium on property tax to encourage growth in the IT sector. His successor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, focussing on self-employment and income generation, plans to delink small-scale commercial ventures from the tax.

 ?If an educated unemployed youth runs a coaching centre at his home and puts up a signboard or a widow runs a tailoring unit on her premises, the property tax on the building will not be increased,? the mayor-designate said in an interview with Metro.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation, however, will continue collecting licence fees for running the establishment.

 According to Bhattacharya, unemployment has been rising sharply in the post-globalisation era because of rampant closure of commercial ventures and an increased level of mechanisation in the production process in the emerging sectors.

 ?We must think of new avenues of earning for the middle class. I know of many people who are reluctant to allow their sons or daughters to start a business fearing a steep hike in property tax,? he added.

 At present, if a house-owner lets out his residence, or a part of it, the income generated through rent is considered part of the annual valuation of the building. 

 This results in a hike in the annual valuation and subsequently, property tax (60 per cent of the income generated from a building is paid as property tax). 

 ?How can income from a landed property be the basis of the civic property tax, especially when there is a separate income tax authority,? Bhattacharya wondered. 

 The system, he said, has given rise to inspector raj, as it provides ample opportunity for dishonest civic inspectors to extort bribe from house-owners. 

 Next on Bhattacharya?s list of priorities are slums.

 He thinks buildings in slum areas are unfit for human habitation. Most of the buildings are dilapidated and over-crowded, and lack ventilation and sanitation facilities.

 The general condition prevailing in slums is detrimental to the health and well-being of the residents, he added.

 Starry insights

 The world of performing arts is often perceived as one of glamour and gloss, where hopes are given wings and dreams fulfilled. It is a world of success and stardom, of fame and fortune. But, hidden beneath the surface lies a secret world of fears, misgivings and uncertainties, whose inhabitants are far removed from the smug, self-assured and self-confident stars that we love to admire, envy and even emulate. Produced by Scene Stealers of Delhi, Identities offers the audience an entry into the private spaces of four talented, aspiring young artistes; an opportunity to look behind their masks and see them as they really are. As the quartet takes them on a roller-coaster ride of their personal trials and triumphs, the audience gets a peep into their intimate thoughts, deepest desires and darkest secrets. Catapulting from dizzying heights of ecstasy to rock-bottom depths of failure, they struggle to define their own identities amidst a mad scramble for glory and success. Full of high tension and excitement, the play has all the ingredients for some absorbing entertainment. Direction: Vivek Mansukhani. Presented by Spandan and Sanskriti Sagar (today) and by HSBC (tomorrow).

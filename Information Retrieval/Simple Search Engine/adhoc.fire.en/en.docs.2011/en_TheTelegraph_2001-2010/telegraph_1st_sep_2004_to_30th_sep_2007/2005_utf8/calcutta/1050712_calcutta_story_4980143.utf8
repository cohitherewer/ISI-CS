The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ready for Reddy II?

 It?s time for a sibling splash on the silver screen with the Reddys getting into the act after the Shettys. If Shilpa and Shamita weren?t hot enough, get ready to welcome Sameera Reddy?s sister, Sushama, on the Bollywood billboard. Vivek Agnihotri?s directorial debut Chocolate will mark the maiden outing for Sushama, who?s been busy modelling for quite some time now.

 ?I call it the natural process of evolving,? Sushama tells Metro. ?From modelling I went on to do veejaying and now, here I am acting. It was no real agenda that I had to get into Bollywood. It?s about being at the right place at the right time.?

 Chocolate, however, wasn?t the first film that came Sushama?s way. ?There have been many other offers but not interesting enough. Chocolate should be a great entry into films. Now, I will only do projects that match it or better it. I am in no tearing hurry.?

 Like its storyline, Chocolate?s characters are being kept under wraps. ?All I can say is that I love the role,? says Sushama. ?I am not an add-on in the scheme of things. The script is the king, with each of us essaying a particular character. By the time you begin understanding the story, you realise how everyone is important to the plot.?

 Mainstream Bollywood multistarrers like Chocolate might not be her final destination. ?I was told that I don?t fit into art cinema. But these days there are so many types of movies being made that you can?t really say what is for whom. I have to figure out where I fit in and how.?

 Comparison with sister Sameera is not fair, feels Sushama. ?She is in a different league altogether. As for me, I am more interested in doing parts that can exploit whatever I have to offer.?

 In fact, the Reddy sisters (there?s model Meghna too) hardly talk movies at home. ?We prefer not to interfere in each other?s work too much,? reveals Sushama. ?We do not get much time at all and when we do, we go out shopping or eat out. But Sameera does give me pointers from time to time about movies.?

 While modelling offers are still there, movies are now the priority for Sushama. ?I don?t want to give mixed signals to the film industry by doing modelling or television. I would rather do just movies and a couple of selective brands.?

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 On Wednesday, while hundreds of squatters at the Dhakuria Lakes were resisting eviction, Ajoy Haldar had another battle to face ? appearing for his Madhyamik Geography paper. 

 Ask him how he will fare, and he?ll say curtly: ?You can imagine how well I will fare.? 

 His sombre look gives away the uncertainty that looms over the fate of the squatters.

 ?Even a day before the examination, we were not sure whether we would be here or not. On the day of examination, we were fighting for staying on. There are 10 of us from this area who are taking the Madhyamik this year. God alone will decide our fate,? avers Ajoy.

 Most of the squatters are waiting to see what happens after March 7, the last day of the Madhyamik. 

 As of now, the whole area has plunged into an eerie silence. The settlers are keeping a cautious watch on any stranger found moving around in the area.

 Even 72 hours after the announcement by the government of aborting the eviction drive, the residents are running from pillar to post to get an assurance that a suitable alternative arrangement will be made before they are evicted.

 Forty two-year-old Niranjan Hazra, who has lived in the area all his life, says of their leader Baburam Pramanik: ?How will you get him here now? He is busy making arrangements for an alternative dwelling for all of us.?

 However, some other squatters are quite determined not to budge till all their demands are fulfilled. 

 ?We will not allow ourselves to be used as pawns by any political party. We will see to it that our demands are fulfilled,? asserted Aloke Sardar, pointing to a placard which read ?uchhed hole agun jolbe, jaan debo kintu anyay uchhed mene nebo na (if we are evicted the entire place will go up in flames. We will die but will not tolerate unjust eviction)?.

 ?Various government agencies have now adopted a unique technique of passing the buck. But we will continue to stay here until an acceptable alternative arrangement is made. We will not spare anybody who attempts to evict us forcefully or plays tricks on us. All of us here are united on our stand,? Sardar added.

 Sibani Haldar, a widow, is at a loss over her daughter?s wedding, scheduled for this month-end. 

 ?We have fixed Champa?s marriage after a long hunt for a suitable match. If we are evicted before that, I don?t know what will happen to my daughter,? she sobbed.

 The eviction drive was called off within three hours on Wednesday after the squatters threatened violence. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had on Wednesday blamed the railways for the shanty-dwellers? plight, saying it had done nothing despite reminders. The government is to submit a report to the high court explaining why the drive was aborted.

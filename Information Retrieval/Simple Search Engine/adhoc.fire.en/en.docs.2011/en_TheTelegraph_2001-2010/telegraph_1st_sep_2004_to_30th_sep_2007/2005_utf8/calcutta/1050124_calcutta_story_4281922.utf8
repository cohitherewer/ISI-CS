The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

 Turning to Page 3

Even if Konkona Sen Sharma was playing the perfect P3P at Shisha the night Madhur 

Bhandarkars Page 3 released in theatres, the film has already generated 

a lot of positive word-of-mouth publicity. Catch the Chandni Bar-maker?s 

fluid camera intrude effortlessly into the nights of the rich and famous and examine 

the inherent frailty of life in the fast lane. With a brilliant supporting cast 

comprising everyone from Boman Irani to Atul Kulkarni, and Tara Sharma and Sandhya 

Mridul for eye-candy, Page 3 is a must-see.

 Taking a nap at work

Present them a long list of the advantages of catching a wink at work if the bosses 

have been gloating over the Supreme Court support for the dismissal of Uttam Manohar 

Nakate by Pune-based Bharat Forge. All for an afternoon siesta at work, post-lunch. 

It?s another matter though that the verdict took more than 20 years to come. Seize 

the moment while the debate on power naps is still hot. Arguments for: instant 

refresher, great fun. Arguments against: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...

Making the most of Republic Day

Mid-week crisis will have to wait till the next week. Whether or not lining up 

Red Road to cheer the Republic Day parade is up your street, making the most of 

the Wednesday holiday is something you can?t miss. Ideally, the red letter day 

calls for a family outing, but if you?d rather avoid surging crowds, plan a house 

party. 

Catching Brad?s eye

The guy who slayed a thousand hearts as Achilles in Troy has just come 

out clean from his four-and-a-half-year marriage to Jennifer Aniston. Female fans 

now have a golden opportunity. The competition is tough though, with tomb raider 

Angelina Jolie getting hot and heavy with the Hollywood hunk. The Internet is 

the best maze to get lost in for the smitten. Scour its obscure nooks for that 

elusive email address or join a Brad Pitt fan forum for cold comfort. Dedicate 

a site to the superstar if you?re really desperate. Who knows, one day the hunk 

just might take note.

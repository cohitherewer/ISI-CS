 Theatre of the masses

 Folk theatre in India has a distinct character of its own. Based on mythological or rural themes, it carries a strong social message with an undeniable national significance. To generate awareness on the importance of folk theatre and to popularise, encourage and support the folk theatre movement in India, Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, along with other zonal cultural centres, hosts the ongoing National Folk Theatre Festival with participating troupes from all over the country. Comprising a selection of seven plays, this evening?s performance features Restaphen, a Manipuri folk play in shumang leela (courtyard theatre) style. Besides being the most favoured form of folk entertainment in Manipur, shumang leela is also a powerful medium of mass education, discussing serious issues like communal harmony, insurgency and drug abuse. A socio-political comment on global terrorism and its devastating impact on the lives of ordinary people, Restaphen tells the tragic tale of its eponymous protagonist ? a boy who loses his parents during USA?s anti-terrorism war in Afghanistan, post 9/11. Direction: Birjit Nagangomba.

 Event: Play in Manipuri, Restaphen, produced by Peace Maker (Manipur)

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake

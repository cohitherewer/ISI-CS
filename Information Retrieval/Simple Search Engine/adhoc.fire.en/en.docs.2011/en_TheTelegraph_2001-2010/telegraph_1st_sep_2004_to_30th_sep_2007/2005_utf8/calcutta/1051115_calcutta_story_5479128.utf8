The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Naughty rise after nice fall

 His debut may have failed at the box-office, but director ARJUN SABLOK hopes to strike gold with his second film Neal ?N? Nikki, learns Pratim D. Gupta 

 Uday Chopra and Tanishaa in Neal ?N? Nikki

 Where did you disappear after your debut Na Tum Jaano Na Hum?

 I directed the special music video for Dhoom with Tata Young and the three heroes. I also made a lot of advertisement films.

 Was this break from cinema deliberate?

 Yes, it was a very conscious break. I wanted to be in an environment that inspired me to create something new. I also wanted to grow as a director before trying something new and now, I feel I did take the right decision of staying away.

 What, according to you, went wrong with Na Tum Jaano Na Hum?

 The timing of the release was not right. I am not one to believe that the film wasn?t modern. I feel it was ahead of its times. But at that time a lot of Esha Deol and Hrithik Roshan films had come back-to-back and that surely didn?t help. Na Tum Jaano Na Hum is one of the more popular films on television. It must have completed a silver jubilee on TV.

 So are you getting ?naughty? with Neal ?N? Nikki because your ?nice? first film didn?t work?

 (Laughs) Yes, Neal ?N? Nikki doesn?t mince 

 words. It is about this young guy from the Canadian vineyards, Neal, who?s getting married in 21 days. So rather than have a bachelor?s party, he wants to have a bachelor?s vacation and sleep with 21 women in the remaining 21 days. He meets Nikki, a city girl from Vancouver, who helps him achieve that.

 Does Neal ?N? Nikki explore the living together concept even more after Salaam Namaste?

 Neal and Nikki are not living together in the movie. They are totally different characters and there?s hardly anything common between the two. In fact, Nikki is very fond of old Hindi movies while only French men turn her on. Neal on the other hand needs maximum fun in minimum time. The film is, of course, anything but the conventional hero-heroine stories of Indian cinema. One of the pick-up lines in the movie is: ?I played strip poker with you in my mind and you lost.? 

 Were you forced to take Uday Chopra as the lead since it?s a Yash Chopra production?

 The best thing about directing a Yash Chopra film is that you have access to any star cast. You don?t make a proposal, you just ask for a cast. Uday and Tanishaa I have known for a long time and I knew the great comic timing they both have. For the audition, I didn?t give them any line, I just gave them a situation and put them in a room. And believe me, the two have a great physical chemistry. It?s like if I leave that room, they will be on each other. There was no obligation to take Uday. I was never given a cast list.

 Did Aditya Chopra have a creative say as your producer?

 Adi is the biggest help for any director because he looks at the bigger picture. he takes the vision outside. And after sharing the greatest of ideas, he will leave you alone to create. He is that safety net who will help you with the difficult choices and decisions.

 You also have a very funky soundtrack?

 Yes, the music by Salim-Sulaiman has a nice mix of techno and melody, Hindi and English. I think, it?s also for the first time that a Hindi film has an out-and-out original English song, a duet love ballad between Neal and Nikki.

 Director Arjun Sablok

Yash Chopra films are famous for their special appearances. Who is it this time?

 Somebody may pop up from somewhere. In a Yash Chopra film, anything?s possible.

 You played one of Shah Rukh?s friends in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Do you have a role in your own film?

 No, I don?t make an appearance but you will hear my voice in the movie.

 Of the directors from the Chopra camp, you are tipped to carry on Yashji?s legacy of total romance?

 That?s very good to hear. I not only worship and respect Yashji, I start my day by touching his feet. Romance, I guess, will never go out of my system. From a girl in Lucknow in my first film to a girl in Vancouver in my second one, the love in them has remained the same. I just love emotions.

 Have you shown your creation to your mentor?

 I haven?t yet shown the film to Yashji. I am a bit sceptical since this one?s a naughty film. But then, you can share a naughty joke with your parents. So, I want to spring a surprise on him.

Justice for JU 

 Victim: a male student

 Age: around 20 

 Injury: a broken elbow and concussion

 Offense: a bystander 

 This is one of the stories making the rounds of the campus. Another tale of a fellow student?s plight. I have been a student of Jadavpur University for some time. I remember in my first year there were rumours about trouble between the authorities and some disgruntled students. But being from a different department, I was far from the epicentre and assumed the matter was resolved.

 Fast forward a year-and-a-half and suddenly I hear a handful of boys have been charged for the old incident. Then ensued this tussle between the two opposing parties. There was turmoil, protests and rallies, and there emerged a unique feeling of brotherhood among the students. Some thought not taking the exams would make their voices heard. Protests and strikes, banners and speeches followed. 

 Initially it was an on-campus matter where there were mixed opinions. Some thought the accused should apologise, others wished the punishment would be withdrawn. Negotiations and discussions followed, several suspensions and resignations were demanded. All through, life for us went on with the usual drill of lectures and tutorials. Out of the blue I hear of a friend who will be unable to take the exams even if they are eventually rescheduled because he has a broken elbow.

 Generally, peace prevails in JU. But things took a violent turn this time. How could a peaceful hunger strike be terminated by violent police activity? I hear claims that it was the only recourse, otherwise the hungerstrike would have killed the students. I wonder if death by a baton blow is more acceptable. 

 Initially, I, too, was undecided about who was in the wrong, but with this grave error in judgment on the part of the authorities, my side was chosen. I just hope this nightmare ends soon.

 Fight for nature 

 I was shocked when I found out that the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) has found oil reserves in the Sunderbans. To any environmentalist?s horror, it is looking for more oil in the area. This will lead to widespread destruction of the forest, and the Sunderbans as we know it will disappear. The forest cover of a country should be at least one-third the land area. India is toiling with only 16.7 per cent. If the ONGC plan is implemented, the count will dip to nine per cent. Even we students are aware of the environmental danger. How can the ONGC chief do something so dreadful?

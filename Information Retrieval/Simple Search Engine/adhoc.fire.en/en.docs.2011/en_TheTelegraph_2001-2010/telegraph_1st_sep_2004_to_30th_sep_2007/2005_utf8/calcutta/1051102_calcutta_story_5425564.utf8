The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Vehicle theft takes the fast track

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police are concerned over the recent spurt in vehicle theft across the city. 

 Records at the Lalbazar headquarters reveal that at least 15 two-wheelers and three four-wheelers were stolen from busy streets in the past couple of weeks.

 In the past 24 hours, a Maruti van was stolen from the Lake area and a two-wheeler, with Rs 2 lakh in the side-box, from Burrabazar.

 Police were alerted about two weeks ago, after four two-wheelers were stolen from a particular area in south Calcutta within 36 hours. ?Desperate attempts were made to nail the thieves, but not one could be held,? said an officer.

 The Maruti (WB02N 6994) was stolen in front of the CIT housing estate between 7.45 pm and 8.30 pm on Monday, said a Lake police station officer.

 As for the theft of the two-wheeler with cash, officers of the detective department?s motor theft section expressed surprise that the crime had been committed on the busy Mirbhar Ghat Street, near the Panchmukhi Hanumanji Temple, in the evening rush hour.

 ?According to the statement provided by vehicle-owner Rajesh Agarwal, the theft took place between 7 pm and 8 pm. Agarwal entered the market on business. When he returned, he found his two-wheeler gone,? said an officer of Burrabazar police station.

 ?Most of the thefts in the past two weeks took place between 6 pm and 10 pm,? said an officer of the motor-theft section. ?This is a new trend. Earlier, more than 90 per cent of the thefts were reported either late at night or in the early hours? The criminals now active are new in the trade. We need some more time to collect information about them.?

 Police have decided to inspect the border areas of North 24-Parganas, through which most stolen vehicles are smuggled to Bangladesh. 

 ?A gang from Bihar is also active in the city. We have recovered some cars stolen by the gang, but the criminals managed to give us the slip. We are in touch with our counterparts in Bihar and are sharing information with them. Some breakthroughs are expected shortly,? was the assurance held out by Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (I), detective department.

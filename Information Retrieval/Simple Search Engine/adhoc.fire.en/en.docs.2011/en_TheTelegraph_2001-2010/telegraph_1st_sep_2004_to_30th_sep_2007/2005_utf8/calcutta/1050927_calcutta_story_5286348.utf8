Musician and foodie NONDON BAGCHI steps into Tangerine to make his peace with multicuisine

 For those of us who have aspirations of being reasonably good cooks within our own domestic set-ups, without ever wanting to go professional, start a restaurant and feed large numbers of people without keeping them waiting too long, it must be a source of relief mixed with a tinge of envy to know that the two realities ? household cooking and a restaurant kitchen ? are as different as chalk and cheese.

 Relief, because on the home front we can do our own thing without being under pressure; the items are just a few, as are the number of people (usually) and even when entertaining, one can plan ahead, take ones time and generally be creative without getting into a tizzy, whereas peak-hour in a restaurant kitchen can become as hectic as a Formula One pit stop.

 A touch of envy, because which of us would not want a well-appointed kitchen with every facility, every single ingredient prepared and kept within arms reach, gas ranges that provide twice or even more fire power than domestic LPG, ovens for grilling, roasting or baking, and technology that keeps the kitchen quite spick and span.

 When Sujit Sinha, chef in charge of the Oriental menu at Tangerine, 2/1, Outram Street, invited me into the kitchen to have a look around, I was up for it without a second thought. 

 Tangerine is easily one of the best eateries that the 21st century has brought us. They do Continental, Indian and Oriental. Although the term multi-cuisine is one that I have viewed with some reservations, the place goes a long way in removing them.

 I followed chef into his domain. Neatly arranged all around was everything he might need. A palate with all the basic ingredients and seasonings ? garlic, ginger, spring onions, sesame oil, soya sauces (dark and light), two kinds of vinegar, a cornflour mixture and various kinds of seasoning. 

 On another side, marinated items such as prawns, fish and chicken all ready for the wok, which was a serious two to three kg affair with a firm wooden handle, sitting over a blazing fire.

 In 10 minutes flat, chef produced four dishes with the skill and panache of an artist. Instead of a paintbrush, he had a ladle in his hand.

 First there was Sliced Chicken Hunan Style. Chicken slices that had been kept marinated in a mix of cornflour, egg and seasonings were stir-fried in really hot oil with ginger, garlic, spring onions and coloured peppers. Stock was added, a little cornflour, seasoning and cooking wine. Garnished with chilli flakes, the dish was done.

 Next up was Prawns in Tausi Sauce which is basically a chilli black bean sauce. 

 The wok had been cleaned in a trice and now the black beans, ginger, garlic, green chillies and spring onions were stir-fried for a few seconds before dark soya sauce, wine, cornflour and sesame oil and seasonings were added to complete the sauce. Then, the prawns, which had earlier been marinated in the same way as the chicken and then lightly fried, were added.

 iced Fish in Chilli Mustard and Ginger Onion Noodles were the other items prepared by this quick stir-fried method where the hotness of the oil and a sense of time and judgment are of prime importance and come from experience.

 So this was our meal, which was prepared with a Thai soup, Pataya Gaeng with Prawns, and the starter, Thai Dry Chilli Chicken, which I did not watch being prepared.

 But the combination of stock, coconut milk, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves and chopped green chillies makes Thai soups a personal favourite.

 On another occasion, we visited Tangerine to savour the Continental fare. 

 This is chef Subhas Basus baby and like his counterpart in the Oriental kitchen, he has the finest credentials. In fact, their pedigree shows in the menu selections and International is probably a better epithet than Continental.

 We started up with Bacon and Potato Soup which is not on the menu but is a chefs special. Bacon and potatoes are cooked together and then pureed. Chicken stock and seasonings are added, the soup is garnished with small pieces of bacon crisp fried, and with garlic bread makes for a delicious beginning.

 Grilled Prawns, a starter, came next. The prawns are marinated just for a few minutes in lemon juice, garlic paste, paprika, salt and pepper and then the flavours are sealed in by frying them for a short while in hot oil. They are then oven grilled before being served with an orange and cilantro sauce. 

 We also had Pork Spare Ribs and though these are done Oriental style, being marinated in honey, soya sauce, chilli paste, oil and five-spice powder, they adapt well to any meal as a starter.

 The main course was Grilled Beckti which they do very well. Again, the fish is marinated for a few minutes only (salt, pepper, lemon juice, white wine) and the flavours are sealed in by frying the fillets in hot oil briefly. 

 The fish is then oven grilled and served with a sauce made with balsamic vinegar (reduced over heat) olive oil, dark mustard and basil. 

 Tomato confit, made with blanched cubed tomatoes, olive oil, crushed coriander seeds, soft coriander stems and seasonings, is also served with the fish.

 For dessert, there was Bulls Eye (hot Swiss pastry with vanilla ice cream) and Apple Aspex Tart, with lemon caramel sauce, which has the blessings of my friend Shaun Kenworthy, specialised pastry chef.

 When I first visited Tangerine, it had just opened-about four years ago. 

 The food was good but the presentation was a bit rough and ready. 

 With time this has improved and behind the scenes they are more streamlined and organised, with good utilisation of space, separate areas for the different cuisines and all the vegetarian items (they have a tempting selection). 

 Next on their ideas list is to take up Nonya cuisine, which is a marriage of Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai and Singapore styles. Sea Food Items of Nonya cuisine will feature on the Puja buffet.

 Gym jam: fitness facts of filmi figures

(From top) Koel, Raima, Tota, Jeet and Rachana 

 Do you drop into the gym or work out at home to stay in shape? ?Ah yes, sometimes!? Ha, Ha, are you serious?? Not really, no time?,? ? they guffawed, giggled and groaned. A hectic shoot schedule may weigh them down, but most stars of our tinsel town, behind all that hee-haw, are serious about how they shape up. To find out what keeps them going through the grind, Reshmi Sengupta takes a closer look at their fitness routines.

 Prosenjit: Wonder what keeps this man at Number One? Catch him during lunch hour to find out.

 ?Though shooting leaves me with little time, I believe in staying fit. A proper diet and physical exercises have helped me carry on for 20 years and more in this industry,? says he.

 Fitness funda: Works out in the gym at home. Freehand exercises are a must, too. 

 Diet watch: Is a very light eater. Sticks to low calorie, minimalist meals. Lunch means a plateful of cut fruits only!

 Jeet: The macho man has set up a full-fledged gym at home, ?after wasting a lot of money on the gyms in town?. Now, he is working out five to six days a week. He aims to slow down to ?four or five days? a week.

 Fitness funda: Abdomen exercises and light weight lifting. 

 Diet watch: A low calorie, high protein menu. Breakfast is a combination of sprouts and fruit juice. An oil-free platter for lunch and dinner.

 Jisshu: There?s no time to work out but he sure has plans to join a gym. ?I intend to flaunt a toned body this year. But I love junk food and eat everything,? he admits. We will wait and watch for those biceps. But let?s not forget this actor with chocolate boy looks was once a cricketer with real promise.

 Fitness funda: Some freehand exercises, though not on a regular basis. It?s the dance and fight sequences that keep him going.

 Diet watch: When it comes to good grub, it?s no holds barred for Jisshu. But he does make it a point to have his meals on time.

 Tota Roy Chowdhury: The black belt in Tae Kwon Do boasts the most chiselled figure in Tollywood and almost all the right answers for any fitness query. ?I feel stars of yesteryears were more health conscious than us. Uttam Kumar used to walk around the Maidan. I follow a fitness regimen for strength, flexibility and stamina,? he attests.

 Fitness funda: Works out six days a week for 45 minutes to an hour ? three days of lifting weights followed by three days on the treadmill. Plus, cycling, skipping and stretching. 

 Diet watch: Is a firm believer in the inverted pyramid of heavy breakfast, moderate lunch and light dinner. Avoids junk food. 

 Koel Mullick: After all that prancing around her heroes, the bubbly 22-year-old isn?t left with much time. A strict watch on her diet is the only way out. ?If I am invited to dinner, I make it a point to skip the next meal or eat less in the afternoon. It?s very important to stay fit as it makes you feel nice mentally. And also because the clothes I am wearing should look good on me,? smiles she. 

 Fitness funda: Some freehand exercise when time permits. Otherwise, meditation before going to bed at night keeps her fresh. 

 Diet watch: A spoon of rice with some curry for lunch at home. While shooting, it?s soup, tok doi and fruits. The evening snack is muri. Dinner is a light meal of two chapatis, a vegetable curry and two pieces of fish or chicken.

 Raima Sen: A gruelling shoot schedule in Kalimpong for Sandip Ray?s Nishijapon has kept Moon Moon Sen?s elder daughter on her toes. ?It?s freezing cold out here and I and Ritu (Rituparna Sengupta) are happily tucking into steamed momos,? she chirps.

 Fitness funda: On the treadmill for 20 to 30 minutes, five days a week, when at home.

 Diet watch: Rice for both lunch and dinner. This foodie has a fetish for chocolates, phuchkas and aloo chat.

 Rituparna Sengupta

 ?I am a very lazy person and have a tendency to put on weight,? confesses the Queen B of Tollywood. 

 Fitness funda: Gym is irregular. She banks on freehand exercises and dance rehearsals to stay in shape.

 Diet watch: Lunch generally means salads, with dinner being the only proper meal. Avoids rice and roti. Drinks lots of water and fruit juice.

 Rachana Banerjee

 The woman with the maximum roles under her belt is not much into working out either. ?With constant shoot schedules and shows, I don?t get the time to drop into a gym at all. And I am too lazy to exercise at home,? admits she.

 Fitness funda: A brisk walk in her Gariahat apartment complex.

 Diet watch: Eats less and spaces out her meals.

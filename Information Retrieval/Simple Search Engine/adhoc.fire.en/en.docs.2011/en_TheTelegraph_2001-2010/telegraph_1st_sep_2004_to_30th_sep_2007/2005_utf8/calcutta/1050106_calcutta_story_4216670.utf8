Next time you want to impress them with your culinary 

skills, try a cosmopolitan bill of fare. At least that?s what celebrated cookbook 

writer Tarla Dalal demonstrated during a cooking workshop at The Park banquets 

on Wednesday afternoon. Thai, Mexican, Italian and tandoori ? all the cuisines 

featured in the full-course menu ? Tarla cooked up step by step, painstakingly 

over three hours. 

Organised by Inner Wheel Club of Central Calcutta, 

the event was in aid of charity. The proceeds of the meet, generated by Rs 650 

registration charges per guest, would be donated to fund the building of a primary 

school at Barasat.

This apart, the club is also donating Rs 50,000 towards 

tsunami aid and it urged everybody present to observe a minute?s silence at the 

start of the programme.

An attentive bunch then sat through the proceedings, 

jotting down every detail uttered by the food expert of whom it was once said: 

?If you want to get your daughter married, send her to Tarla Dalal?s cooking classes.? 

The foodie has penned over 50 books so far and is 

considered to have sold the maximum number of books in any field among Indian 

authors.

?Cooking is a science,? she stressed, emphasising 

the use of easy-to-prepare recipes with ingredients that are locally available. 

?I am working on a quick and easy recipe book for working women,? promised Tarla.

The audience was taken through the paces of everything 

starting from a welcome drink to the dessert. What started off with Apple Tea 

culminated in Brownie Sizzler, packing in a range of items like Tandoori Aloo, 

Sizzling Asparagus and Babycorn, Mexican Burnt Corn Salad, Rosti Pizza and Thai 

Red Curry in between.

Low calorie content and extensive use of modern gadgets 

like microwaves highlighted Tarla?s style, most of which can be rustled up in 

a jiffy. 

Next on the cards: demos of recipes high on iron and 

calcium content, special dietary advice on pregnancy and diabetes? ?anything that 

can be better service to the society than the usual cakes and puddings?, signed 

off Tarla.

Light bite

 Chinese and Tibetan cuisine address The Grub Club 

is celebrating its seventh anniversary. This time, the 54-seater restaurant is 

not only dishing out its usual delicacies with a bit of improvisation, it is even 

introducing new items like Konji Crispy Lamb, lamb in a varied choice of sauces 

and Satay Chicken. For the veggies, delightful dishes like Hot Honey Paneer and 

Vegetable Momos are part of the menu. 

?We constantly seek to make improvisations and create 

additions to our menu. We also enjoy sticking to our label of being a value-for-money 

kind of place where good food is affordable to most,? says restaurateur Papia 

Das.

What?s more, the restaurant has opened up a confectionery 

unit where orders for all kinds of cakes and pastries are accepted.

As part of its winter special, The Grub Club is serving 

coffee with some mouth-watering sandwiches. Wantons in soups and sauces are another 

winter speciality.

For those waiting to grab a bite of this grub, there 

are special discounts up to 10 percent till January 15. While a South Calcuttan 

can hop over to 131/2 Southern Avenue, north Calcuttans can stick to 41 Chittaranjan 

Avenue.

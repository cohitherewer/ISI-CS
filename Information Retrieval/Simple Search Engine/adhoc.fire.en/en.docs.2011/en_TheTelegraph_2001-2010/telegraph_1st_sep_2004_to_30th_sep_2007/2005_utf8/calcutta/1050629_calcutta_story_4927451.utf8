The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

 lsquo;I don rsquo;t care about the banner rsquo;

 Widely acclaimed as the hottest debutante in tinsel town, AYESHA TAKIA is on a roll. Home Delivery rsquo;s Jenny tells Pratim D. Gupta about working with Sujoy Ghosh and Naseer lsquo;uncle rsquo;, and why she would like to do a Bengali film

 First the Sabsey Favourite Kaun Award for Best Debutante and then the IIFA Award for the same. You are on a roll?

 (Laughs) It always feels very, very good to get an award. I want to, hopefully, win all the awards forever. It doesn?t register in the first moment. I really freaked out like ?Oh! I actually won this?. Most of the awards are based on viewership voting, totally on popularity and not on any particular film. So it feels great to know that the people you actually do films for liked the work you are doing.

 Would you have liked a bigger film than Taarzan for your debut?

 As I always say, I am what I am because of the choices that I made and the decisions that I took. If I would have changed anything, then maybe I would have been better or worse, but not this. And I am happy with the way I am and wouldn?t like to change that.

 How did you bag Home Delivery?

 I met Sujoy (Ghosh) when he came to me with the script to talk to me and narrate it to me. He thought I was fit for the role of Jenny. Even before I met him, I had heard from everyone that it was a great script and Sujoy was an extremely talented man. Before doing the film, I did ask a few close friends in the industry and they were all very excited about the project. After working with him I can say myself that Sujoy is an extremely capable director. He makes very realistic films. The dialogues are not dialogues ? they are like the way we are speaking.

 So you liked Jhankaar Beats...

 I have not seen Jhankaar Beats. I have heard a lot about it. I must see it. Sujoy will kill me if he finds out that I haven?t seen the film. Please don?t tell him. But Home Delivery is great ? it?s about one day in the lives of these people. It has lots of lovely cameos and great actors.

 What do you play in the film?

 I play Jenny, a Catholic girl who lives in with her boyfriend. They have been seeing each other for two-three years. She also loves her family and is very moralistic. She believes in values but doesn?t believe in any religion. The story is about the relationship between her and her boyfriend and how they learn so many things because of this one incident.

 What?s after Home Delivery?

 I am starting Naseer uncle?s film after this, which should start next month. It?s a crossover kind of a film about four different stories and how they come together at the end. It?s based on the 9/11 incident and has got some lovely actors like Irrfan and Konkona Sen Sharma. Naseer uncle has been speaking to me for almost a year now, that we should do this film together. I felt very honoured that an actor of his calibre and a person so respected would ask me to do his film.

 You are also doing Shaadi No. 1?

 Yes. I haven?t finished shooting for that. It?s, of course, a David Dhawan multi-starrer. I am paired opposite Fardeen (Khan). It should release in November.

 No insecurities in sharing space with others in a multistarrer?

 The first film of mine that released had a car more important than any other character in the film. Then after Taarzan, the second film that I did, Dil Maange More, had three girls and a guy who was very upcoming. And the third film (Socha Na Tha) had me and a new boy. So, I have never really thought about what anybody else is doing in a film or how many people are there in the film. I just think about what I am doing and if I think I can make an impact or do a good job, then that?s the film I want to do. I always select films where I know I can wake up in the morning, go on the sets and have a good time. It should be an experience that I can look back at and be thankful for. I don?t sign a film on the basis of a banner.

 A Telugu song of yours is all over the airwaves?

 Yes, it?s a film called Super with Nagarjuna. Sandeep Chowtha has done the music. I think every actor would like to actually do a non-Hindi film, may be a French or a Marathi film or a Bengali film. I want to be part of such diverse cinema. It just extends my audience. It just makes more and more people able to see me as an actor. Now after doing the Telugu film, two crore more people know that this is Ayesha, even if it?s vaguely.

 Now that you are entering the big league, are you under some pressure to deliver?

 No co-star or actor should make you feel pressured. If you are working with bigger, better and more talented people, you should just feel like you need to give your best, more and more. When you are getting to work with people like Boman Irani and Naseeruddin Shah, it makes you feel great to think that you?re capable of being in the same film and in the same frame as they are. I must do my best.

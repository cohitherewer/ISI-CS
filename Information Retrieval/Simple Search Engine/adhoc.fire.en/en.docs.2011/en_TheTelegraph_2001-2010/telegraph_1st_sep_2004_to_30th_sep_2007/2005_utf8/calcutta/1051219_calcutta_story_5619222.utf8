The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 King Kong

Director Peter Jackson?s remake of the 1933 movie 

about a film crew stumbling upon an island filled with savage tribals and pre-historic 

animals. The 25-ft-tall giant ape, King Kong, takes a liking to the movie?s heroine 

Anne Darrow (Naomi Watts) and saves her from the rest of the wild beasts. As the 

film?s director Carl Denham (Jack Black) gets desperate to return home with never-seen-before 

footage, the scriptwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) wants to rescue his lady 

love Anne. After a grand fight, King Kong is sedated and taken to New York as 

The Eighth Wonder of the World. But it is the beauty which finally kills the beast.

The sheer size of the canvas, the lavish opulence of the production, the undaunted 

enormity of the vision easily make this one of the greatest films ever made. Jackson?s 

childhood dream project joins ranks with such trendsetters in the history of cinema 

as Cleopatra, Titanic, Jurassic Park and Terminator. 

It?s not just about the giant ape as Black?s Carl says in the film: ?Monsters 

only come in B-grade movies?. In parts, it is about the never-say-die spirit of 

human endurance, in parts it is an impeccably crafted love story between Anne 

and Jack and, of course, it is also about the human awakening of a beast.

Perfectly cast, the main three actors come up with career-best performances. Black 

is the pick of the lot as the ravenous film-maker who will go to any lengths to 

salvage his sagging fortunes. Looking exquisitely beautiful, Watts steers clear 

of being the screechy damsel in distress and, considering she has just a white 

screen to react to, she does a superb job. After Pianist and Signs, 

Brody shines as the tragic knight in shining armour. Watch out for the brilliantly 

written sequence in the ship corridor where the two interact for the first time.

The computer graphics, which punctuate the natural performances, are of the very 

highest order. To actually make the audiences empathise with a beast created on 

the desktop is the ultimate merging of art and technology. 

There are too many dinosaurs and too many sequences devoted to them, sometimes 

giving an impression that you are watching Jurassic Park IV. And the biggest 

letdown is that the title character only arrives at the interval point after one-and-a-half 

hours of screen time, truly testing your patience.

First weekend watch: 70% at INOX (Forum) 

and 60% at INOX (City Centre)

Last word: Sure to sweep the Oscars 

next March, don?t miss this once-in-a-lifetime adventure that?s certain to get 

you back for more...

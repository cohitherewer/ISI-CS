 Cadre turns broom brigade

 - CPM cleans up mega rally site but book fair litter still stands

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The flotsam and jetsam of the Calcutta Book Fair still lies on a section of the Maidan. 

But surprisingly, on Sunday, loads of garbage that 

had accumulated on the Maidan after the mammoth CPM rally on Saturday, were cleared 

by scores of party functionaries . 

 The rally site, that was strewn with newspapers, leftovers, plastic packets, paper and earthen cups on Saturday, appeared cleaner the next day. Of course, the clean-up was not thorough, and plastic cups, bamboo poles and flags were still around. 

 At the end of Saturday?s meeting, Left Front chairman Biman Bose had promised that the ground would be cleared within the next 24 hours. True to his word, this part of the Maidan appears cleaner than it ever does after party meetings are over.

 ?Ours is an organised and disciplined party. My comrades today kept their word by cleaning the Brigade Parade Ground. The army must be happy now,? Jyoti Basu said at the CPM party office on Sunday morning. 

 CPM sources said more than 70 party members from the Calcutta district committee were deployed on Sunday morning to clean the refuse.

 The adjacent book fair venue lay covered with electricity and bamboo poles, and a huge amount of litter was scattered all around. 

 A temporary construction made of tin, which houses a transformer installed to provide a power connection to the fair, is yet to be dismantled. Clearly, the final clean-up act is still a long way off.

 On a nearby patch of green, workers were busy setting up stalls for the handicrafts fair opening later this week. More structures will come up, and more litter will be cast all over in the coming days.

 Sunday was also the day when environment activist Subhas Dutta went to visit the Maidan to get a first-hand account of the situation.

 ?The condition is very disappointing?but there seems to be hope, as we found CPM activists cleaning up the place. If the largest political party of the state can start such an endeavour, surely there is hope for a better tomorrow for the Maidan,? Dutta said.

 However, he was not particularly happy with the book fair venue: ?This fair has been unfair on the Maidan?. 

 Dutta took a group of 20 members of his Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity, who helped the volunteers clean up. He took photographs of the Maidan and will submit them, along with a report, to Calcutta High Court on Thursday, when the Maidan case is to come up for hearing.

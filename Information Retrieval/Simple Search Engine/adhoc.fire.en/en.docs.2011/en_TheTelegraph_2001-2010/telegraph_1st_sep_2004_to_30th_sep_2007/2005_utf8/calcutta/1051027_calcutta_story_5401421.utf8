The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mythical romance

 Experimentation in the dramatic arts has, perhaps, never been so creatively executed as in Nandikars stage presentation of Abanindranath Tagores mythical narrative, Bappaditya. Fusing elements of music, poetry, dance and the distinctive narrative style of the original, the performance marks the zenith of this theatre-groups journey in exploring and discovering new dramatic modes. A tale of adventure and heroism, the play ultimately celebrates the triumph of eternal love. It tells the story of its eponymous hero, who, ignorant of his royal lineage, grows up as a shepherd boy and subsequently becomes king through his exploits on the battlefield. Later, when he learns of the sins he has unknowingly committed, he vows to atone for them. Finally, he relinquishes worldly fame and glory to unite with the one he loves. Performed by Sohini Halder (Sengupta). Drama, music and direction: Goutam Halder.

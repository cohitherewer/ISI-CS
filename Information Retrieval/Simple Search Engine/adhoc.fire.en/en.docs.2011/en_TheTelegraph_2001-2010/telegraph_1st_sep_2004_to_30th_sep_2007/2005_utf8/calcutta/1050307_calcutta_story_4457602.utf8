 Frames of reality

 Realism in modern art gets a fresh lease of life in Puja Newar?s paintings that are pure expressions of the stark, natural face of reality. Devoid of surrealism or any form of obscure imagery, they possess the power to appeal to the heart of the common man. The ongoing exhibition of her paintings, comprising a selection from her repertoire of oil, acrylic, pen and ink and charcoal works, is inspired by the simplicity and innocence of rustic life. An amazing control of powerful brushstrokes and an exceptional eye for detail characterise all her paintings, portraying the raw, uninhibited beauty of her subjects caught in their natural moods and expressions. Her sensitive depiction of themes like life, labour, survival and nature reflect Newar?s empathy with the common man?s struggle for survival.

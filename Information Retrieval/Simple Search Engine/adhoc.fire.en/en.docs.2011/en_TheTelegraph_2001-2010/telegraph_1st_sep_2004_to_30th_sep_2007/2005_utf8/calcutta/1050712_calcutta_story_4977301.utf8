The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green police pass buck

 - Man, machine amp; mandate lack cited for fume figure fudge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The ground reality: Emission test centres continue to give clean chits to polluting vehicles.

 The grumble: Man and machine power constraints for one; lack of mandate for the other.

 Three days after the fudged fume figures expos? by Metro, both the public vehicles department (PVD) and the pollution control board (PCB) have come up with their own set of excuses to duck the line of fire.

 The PVD has admitted that it is not equipped to monitor the modus operandi of the pollution under control (PUC) centres across the state. ?There is no point in monitoring if one doesn?t have the technical wherewithal to crosscheck the data provided by the PUC centres. Going to a centre and verifying the equipment is of no use,? H. Mohan, director, PVD, told Metro on Monday. 

 To address the problem, the PVD has started working on a ?comprehensive monitoring plan? for the 115 PUC centres in the state. ?Finalising the plan will take some time. But we are commissioning an inquiry into the functioning of the city?s PUC centres shortly,? stressed Mohan.

 The transport department is trying to acquire testing machines ? at present the PVD and the regional transport authorities do not have the computerised system to check auto emission levels ? to run a reality check on the PUC centres.

 But equipment alone will not solve the problem, pointed out a source in the transport department. 

 ?Monitoring is impossible in the existing system. There are only seven technical persons in the PVD to monitor over 10 lakh vehicles in the city at 70 PUCs,? he stated.

 If the PVD is hamstrung by lack of man and machine, the state pollution control board blames its inability on the want of a mandate.

 ?According to a government notification, our responsibility ends with the technical vetting of the auto emission instruments at the time of granting new licence or renewal,? said PCB chairman Sudip Banerjee, distancing the board from daily monitoring of the centres playing foul.

 But the pollution watchdog in Bengal cannot shirk its responsibility, said S.M. Ghosh, petitioner in the auto emission case that was disposed of by the high court last Friday. 

 ?The Air Act of 1981 has empowered the state boards to initiate actions against polluting vehicles,? he asserts.

 According to environment activist Subhas Dutta, the state pollution control boards in 12 metros are playing a pro-active role in imposing the Supreme Court guidelines.

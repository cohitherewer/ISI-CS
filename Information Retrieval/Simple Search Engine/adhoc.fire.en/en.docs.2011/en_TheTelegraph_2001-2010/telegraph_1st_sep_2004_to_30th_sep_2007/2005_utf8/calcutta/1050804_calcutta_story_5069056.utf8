The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Social canvas

 City of Arc; Barindam Bose

 Following similar artistic styles and techniques, the paintings of Arindam Bose and Barindam Bose are based on themes of modern society and culture. The ongoing exhibition of their works, Avant Garde, appears, on first impression, to be a celebration of the bohemian way of life. The artists? purpose becomes clear only on close observation. Images of men, women, city-life and cityscapes abound in the collection, illustrating current social trends and mores. Subtly drawing attention to societys moral and cultural decadence, the artists present several grave and sombre human studies depicting vice, corruption and the erosion of values. This can be perceived in the imposition of coarse, irregular shapes and the use of odd colour tones, disturbing the mood of the compositions. Portraying all that is non-conformist, unorthodox and eccentric in human behaviour, the paintings emphasise, by contrast, the importance of obeying tradition and social conventions.

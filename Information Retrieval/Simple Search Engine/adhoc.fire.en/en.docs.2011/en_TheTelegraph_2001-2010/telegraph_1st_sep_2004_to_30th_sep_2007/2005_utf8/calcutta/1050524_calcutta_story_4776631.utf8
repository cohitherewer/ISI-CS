 The summer sun is scorching, so not always is it possible to hang out with friends and chill out with family outdoors during vacation time. After dark is the only time fit to venture out. But during the day, there are plenty of activities all around town, geared towards holiday fun. Here?s a round-up of some of the events...

 Art and magic

 British Council and Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre are presenting Magic Pencil, an exhibition of illustrations selected by the celebrated children?s author and illustrator Quentin Blake. On May 19, the exhibition opened with an adda at 6 pm with speakers Sukanta Chaudhuri, Abhijit Gupta (both professors of JU?s English department), Chandana Datta (director of Shishu Sahitya Samsad) and Pinaki De (illustrator).

 Sukantada talked about how words don?t describe objects, only the concept of objects, which creates greater need for illustrations, especially in children?s literature where creatures like Kumropotash, Ramgorurer Chhana, the mock-turtle and the bread-and-butter fly had been conjured. Chandana Datta spoke of more practical issues, particularly about the history and current situation in the field of publishing of children?s literature, especially in Bengali, in Calcutta and the problems concerning the relevant illustrations, including that of copyright problems. 

 Tintinda (Abhijit Gupta) gave us a brief condensed history of illustration in world children?s literature and presented the facts about how children?s literature previously (in the 19th century) preached morals to kids (a thing incorporated into Vidyasagar?s Bornoporichoy) but also told us how the situation improved with the entry of the stories of two bratty boys which later provided the concept for Sukumar Ray?s Baapre ki beyadop chhele. 

 He even mentioned how children?s literature illustrations could be disturbing, an example being the Jabberwocky in Through the Looking Glass. Bringing up the rear, Pinakida showed us a brilliant exclusive collection of children?s literature illustrations, which showcased the beginnings of and the situation now. 

 Pictures were included from the nominations of the Bologna Festival. They also had samples, which proved that the highly talented Japanese were coming out of their traditional forms while the Occident sought refuge in those styles to wallow in exoticism. We also realised the poor condition of India in the scene. 

 The whole thing was wrapped up well within two hours. There was no time for an open discussion session. But the speakers did speak to the attendees individually while refreshments comprising desi French fries, aloo pakora, desi p?t? and yummy vanilla-chocolate marble cake were served with cha.

 Creative kids

 The nine-day Summer Fun programme at Landmark started on May 17 with the making of papier mache bowls. On the 18th, kids took to making bluff puppet socks. The next day saw them make cr?pe paper flowers and paint the papier mache bowls that they had made on Day One. The children were under the supervision of special educator Lata Bhatia, who designs educational toys. 

 The fourth day started with icing sugar crafts, where students used gelatin, icing sugar, butter, water and food colour to prepare craftwork. On Day Five was toy making, where children used toy making boards, beads, designs and Tibtoy patterning to make plastic toys.

 The next few days, till the end of the camp on May 27, will comprise creating cartoon character wall hangings, colour plasticine dinosaurs, collage painting with marble paper and paper mask making. Final year MA student of JU Srijit Bhattacharya, a self-taught artist, will supervise the youngsters. 

 Seven-year-old Vinayak Kamal Ghosh, a young participant, said: ?I was not feeling well in the morning. Ma asked me to stay home and rest. But I wouldn?t listen. I wanted to come here and finally she agreed.? 

 Conceptualised and designed by Arundhuti Gupta, Summer Fun was for kids from six to 12. To wrap up, the children are provided refreshments.

 Puppet patterns

 A lively workshop was held recently at Kidz Konclave, on Keyatala Road, on puppetry, by the well-known puppeteer Suresh Dutta, a recipient of Sangeet Natak Academy. Also present were Mamata Shankar and her musician son Ratul Shankar. 

 The history of puppetry in India dates back to around the 5th century BC. Early puppet shows in India mostly dealt with histories of great kings, princes and heroes as also political satire and religious themes. Indian puppetry also conveys useful messages from Panchatantra and other mythological and historical epics. 

 The workshop aimed at examining the rich heritage of Indian puppetry. Children not only enjoy puppetry, but it was also an attempt to revive the dying art form and make the kids aware of this primitive form of communication. Dutta of Kolkata Puppet Theatre put up a puppet show.

 As Indira Sengupta of Kidz Konclave explained: ?Children relate to puppets from their earliest years because they are used to making inanimate characters come to life, and this creative potential in them is just waiting to be used to help communities grow and change.?

 Puppetry has flourished in India. Different types of puppets are used. The differences exist in name, form, structure and manipulation techniques. The major types of puppetry in India are rod, string, shadow and glove puppetry, by the tribes from Malabar in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Puppetry is very popular in Assam, West Bengal and Orissa. Puppets are made either with leather and the movements controlled by a stick, or with wood or cloth and controlled by strings. String puppetry is also popular in Rajasthan. 

 The art has had to suffer from lack of patronage and faces extinction. It is paradoxical that while it is during the last three decades or so that the puppet traditions all over the country have been discovered, national and regional festivals organised and books published with the central and the state academies supporting their revival, it is also during this period that the tradition has declined and many of them are on the point of extinction. Old puppeteers are dying and youngsters are choosing lucrative professions.

 Eco-friendly

 Suryodaya summer camp concluded at Hiland Park on May 21. Children of the area (EM Bypass) came together to learn about the ecosystem, bio-degradable waste, trees and wild animals, compost making, collage making and more. 

 The six-day workshop started off with the importance of trees and the various uses of the different parts of a plant. Germination was another aspect. 

 Day Two began with pug-mark tracking of animals and a look at the decreasing tiger population. There were workshops on afforestation and a poster-making competition. How to dispose of garbage ? wet and dry, biodegradable and non-biodegradable ? making vermicompost and painting were other aspects of the camp.

 At the end, each child donated an item of clothing, a packet of biscuits and a toy which will be given to underprivileged children after the conclusion of the second phase of the camp, from June 1 to 8, which will be an elaboration of the ideas introduced in the first phase. There will also be outdoor trips to places like the energy park.

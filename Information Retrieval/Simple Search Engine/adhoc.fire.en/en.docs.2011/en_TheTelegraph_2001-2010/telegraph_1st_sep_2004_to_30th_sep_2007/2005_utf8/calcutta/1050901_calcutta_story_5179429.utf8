 Disadvantage, Sania

 Chic glasses, nose ring and danglers are in place, but the tennis star 

 is yet to get her style act together, feel designers

 If her moves on the tennis court have inspired a whole generation in India (what with kids queuing up at academies with dreams of becoming the next big thing with a racquet in hand), her thick, black-rimmed glasses have brought the Seventies look back in eye fashion and her nose ring and danglers are often more talked about than her groundstrokes.

 Eighteen-year-old Sania Mirza is not only the first Indian woman to win a match at the US Open, shes also the reigning non-filmi female youth icon of the country.

 But is the 42nd-ranked girl from Hyderabad doing it right? We arent talking of her forehand (which is truly impressive) or her on-court mobility (which is truly unimpressive), but about Sania getting her style act together.

 No way, seems the popular verdict from city fashion designers.

 Sania desperately needs a wardrobe makeover, pronounces designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who feels that the rising tennis star is frivolous and filmi when it comes to fashion. 

 I must say Sania is not very erudite about fashion. She is representing a whole sub-continent as a sports icon and hence she should carry herself in a more elegant and sophisticated way. Right now, I think, she looks too frivolous for people to take her very seriously and that could be a problem for the brands shes endorsing, says Pepsi.

 Kiran Uttam Ghosh, however, feels Sania has a style of her own that is yet to find its feet. From her chic glasses to her nose ring, a sense of style comes through, but it needs to be properly executed, says Kiran.

 Sanias off-court wardrobe, feels Sabyasachi, should comprise classic, simple and clean cuts in dark hues like coffee brown, dark red and burgundy, instead of the loud and heavily-embellished salwar suits that shes mostly seen in. 

 On court she should wear more of neutrals and definitely do away with so much of make-up and jewellery, he adds.

 Another city designer, Priti Jhawar, agrees that her off-court filmi look is what Sania needs to shed. She should highlight her femininity since shes got a feminine structure, but that doesnt mean she has to look filmi. She has to balance her feminine charm and her image of strength and power. And yes, she has to add an element of glamour to her wardrobe, which is terribly missing.

 Polka dots, striped shirts and pastel hues are what Priti recommends for off-court appearances. Collared tees and pleated skirts in vibrant shades should bring out her energetic nature on court, she adds.

 eated skirts should score over other garments when it comes to dressing on court, feels Sayon Mitra, too. She can add colour to her appearance with colourful bandanas and wristbands, maybe.

 Sayon also recommends a more sporty and classic wardrobe for the teenager, with well-structured garments like skirts, trousers and sports jackets.

 But for a sportswoman, comfort should be the key to the wardrobe. Very young, fresh, spirited, hip and very relaxed are the words that come to my mind when I think about Sania. So, comfort should be the crucial factor, observes Kiran.

 The designer also takes into account Sanias fetish for salwar suits when recommending a dress code. Since she is often seen in traditional gear, I would suggest she goes for kurtas with Patiala salwars instead of the regular salwar suits that she wears, though thats not something I usually recommend for somebody her size.

 A mix and match of prints and textures, instead of loud embellishments, should bring in the element of elegance, while her young appeal can be retained through fun detailing. 

 Alternatively, I would give her a long straight skirt with a wrap top that would make her look smart and classy, adds Kiran. 

 For accessorisation, a jhola bag slung across her body would go with the free-spirited, bindaas look.

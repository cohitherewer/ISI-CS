 Let?s rock, everybody, let?s rock, Everybody in the whole cell block, Was dancin? to the jailhouse rock.

 Elvis Presley might have swung to these lines of Jailhouse rock, but for the inmates of Alipore and Presidency jails, it will be Jailhouse folk on July 28 and 29, as Bangla band Bhoomi ushers in Baranday roddur beyond the high prison walls, as part of its sixth anniversary celebrations. 

 Says lead singer Surajit Chatterjee: ?Every year, on our birthday, we have performed to collect funds for veteran musicians like Utpala Sen, Gopal Das and Brojen Biswas. This year, we wanted to reach out to the prisoners, who do not get the opportunity to listen to music at all.?

 With the helping hand of friend Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy inspector-general of the IPS cell, Bhoomi got the nod from social welfare and jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury. ?I thought it was a very noble cause,? says Mukherjee. ?A Bhoomi concert is a big occasion for all of us and for the prisoners locked up inside their cells, it will be an experience of a lifetime.?

 Minister Chowdhury looked at the show as another step for converting the prisons into ?correctional homes? and sanctioned as many as three Bhoomi performances at Alipore, Presidency and Dum Dum jails. The Dum Dum jail show didn?t work out due to the ongoing renovation work. 

 ?It?s also a big honour to get to perform in such historical places like the Alipore and Presidency jails,? says Bhoomi?s drummer-singer-lyricist Soumitra Ray. ?No band has ever performed inside these prisons. The show should help the inmates get closer to the mainstream.?

 Circulars have been sent to the two prisons and preparations are already on to make the cells reverberate to the familiar strains of Tomar dekha nai re? Says Joydeb Chakraborty, inspector-general of police (prisons): ?Although there are around 2,000 prisoners in both the jails, we will only allow around 150 to 200 of them to watch the performance, due to security reasons.?

 That?s not all. Before the Bhoomi act in Alipore, Nupur Chakraborty, wife of the inspector-general (prisons), and the South 24-Parganas district magistrate, Vivek Kumar, will start the musical celebrations.

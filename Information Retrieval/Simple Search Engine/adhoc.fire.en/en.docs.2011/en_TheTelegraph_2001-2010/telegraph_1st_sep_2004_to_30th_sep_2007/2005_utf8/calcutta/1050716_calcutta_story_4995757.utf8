The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Age no bar for transport lobby

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The high court may have disposed of the petition on auto emission, but Calcutta?s road row is set to rage on.

 The government, for once, seems determined to slam the brakes on pre-1990 commercial vehicles, while the transporters remain defiant.

 In a recent letter to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, the transporters have ruled out replacement of pre-1990 vehicles. 

 ?If we are able to comply with the emission norms prescribed by the high court, the government cannot tell us to phase out,? they have stated. 

 While disposing of the petition filed by S.M. Ghosh, the court had ruled that all vehicles should adhere to the tail-pipe emission norms set by the Centre.

 Government officials, however, argued that though the petition had been disposed of, the earlier orders of the court were binding.

 ?The verdict on curbing automobile emission stands. At the same time, the ban on pre-1990 vehicles is also valid. A government can always pass an order more stringent than the high court?s. The intention of both sides is the same ? curbing pollution in Calcutta,? a senior official said. 

 Last month, Chakraborty had held separate meetings with the operators of autorickshaws, taxis, buses and trucks and sought their views on the government?s stand. 

 The minister had hinted at a revision of the cut-off year if the transporters? lobby could suggest one. 

 The transporters, however, wrote back to the minister: ?There is no question of revising the cut-off year ? we will not adhere to any such date.?

 In the death row are 9,587 of the 33,000 taxis, 60,000 of the 97,000 trucks, 7,464 of the 16,000 buses and 1,164 of the 2,800 minibuses. According to the government order, taxis, buses and trucks have to be scrapped by December 31, while autorickshaws will have to either switch to LPG or get shipped out by August 31.

 ?With the business at its current level, it is not possible to replace so many vehicles. We have not sought any extension as we don?t accept the ban at all. If the government tries to force us to comply with the order, we will move the high court,? threatened Sadhan Das, general secretary, Joint Council of Bus Operators? Syndicates. 

 ?We do not function according to the whims of the transporters. As far as I am concerned, this order stands,? was transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury?s reply.

 They, for a change, were not showcasing clothes or trying on make-up or pushing the latest goodies in town. Familiar modelling faces from the city ? Ria, Tina, Shrestha, Tanushree, Bidita, Sheena, Jessica, Devdutta, Amrita and Priyanka ? participated in an interactive workshop with Kaya Skin Clinic on Loudon Street, lapping up the essentials of a skincare regimen.

 The session was presided over by Kaya dermatologist and member of Kaya Skin advisory Dr Nilardi Das, who discussed topics like anti-ageing and skin problems caused by erratic work schedules, heavy make-up and exposure to harsh light. Processes for safe and hygienic hair removal were also stressed. The dermatologist shed light on the Kaya permanent hair reduction (laser epilation) treatment using the Nd:Yag laser which is US FDA approved.

 Winter fare

 La Cucina, the speciality Italian restaurant at Hyatt Regency, is all set to welcome winter in style by introducing a completely new menu that takes you beyond customary Italian cuisine.

 Changing the menu is our way of welcoming the winter in style, says chef Cananzi.

 For appetisers, you can opt for the vegetarian antipasti ? Pere Arrostite Con Gorgonzola Balsamico (a combination of strong cheese like gorgonzola with a delicate fruit like pear and finished with extra-old Balsamic vinegar), while seafood lovers can go for Calamari Alla Griglia Con Acciuge-e-Olio Aromatico (grilled calamari, anchovie and aromatic oil together).

 Pasta lovers have a wide selection ranging from Risotti Agli Scampi-e-Erba Cipollina Brasta (risotto with fresh scampi, braised spring onion) to Gnochhi Di Patate-e-Zafferano Con Verdurine Verdi (saffron potato gnochhi with green vegetables) to pick from. 

 In the main course, there is the option to be pampered with dishes like Lasagna Al Pesto Con Olive Taggiasche (lasagne with basil pesto, cheese, kalamata olive), Petto Di Pollo Servitor Con Cime Di rapa-e-Cipolline Alla Agrodolce (oven-roasted chicken breast served with sauteed mustard leaves).For seafood lovers there is Grigiliata Misti Di Pesce Con Pomodori-e-Peperoni Al Forno All Olio-e-Limone (grilled prawn, snapper, squid, mussel with tomato, roast bell pepper, lemon olive oil) in original sea flavour like Rimini in Italy.

 To end your meal on a sweet note, there is the Light Trale Cake with Expresso Sauce, Amaretto and Ricotta Pie to dig into. The dishes are all priced between Rs 220 and Rs 975 plus.

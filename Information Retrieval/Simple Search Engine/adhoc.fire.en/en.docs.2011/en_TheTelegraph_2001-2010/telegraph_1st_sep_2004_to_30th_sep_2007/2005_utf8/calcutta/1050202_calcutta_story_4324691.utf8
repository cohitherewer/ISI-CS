 Court teeth for online bite

 - Bench go-ahead for stalled state crackdown on errant lottery operators

 OUR BUREAU

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government scored a victory of sorts on Tuesday, with Calcutta High Court backing its current drive against errant retail operators of online lotteries in Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal.

 A division bench of Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi allowed the government to continue its drive against dealers, retailers and owners of outlets of online lotteries running their businesses in the state without conforming to provisions of Lottery Regulations Act, 1998.

 ?The judgment has gone in the state government?s favour,? said finance minister Asim Dasgupta. ?This means nothing can come in the way of our investigating cases where rules are flouted in running the online lottery business, and taking action against them. We will now make the drive more widespread.?

 Online lotteries operating in the state have been conducting draws every day, and some times every hour. According to the Lottery Regulations Act, 1998, the draws can only be conducted weekly, with a monthly bumper draw. Also, retailers and dealers are supposed to pay the government a portion of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The Bengal government has received nothing. Another rule flout was the tickets not bearing holograms of the state or states involved with the lotteries.

 Setting aside the interim order of a trial court, the division bench on Tuesday gave the government the go-ahead to seize articles and documents related to online lotteries, from dealers and retailers. The judges observed that the state has the authority to interfere into a Central Act ?when there arises the question of maintaining law and order?.

 Minister Dasgupta, meanwhile, has appealed to the people to submit ?written complaints? to the finance department if they came across any illegal lottery, ?including satta?. The government had asked the city and state police authorities to crack down on all kinds of illegal lotteries, Dasgupta stressed.

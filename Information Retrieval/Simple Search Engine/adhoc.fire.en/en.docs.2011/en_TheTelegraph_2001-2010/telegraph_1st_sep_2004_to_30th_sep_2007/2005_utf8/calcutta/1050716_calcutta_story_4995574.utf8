 Cradle for GenNext leaders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bengal has always been known for its political activism and that?s what has brought Pune-based Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) to the city, scouting for students for its diploma course in government. 

 The one-year, post-graduation programme is designed for the next generation of aspiring young MPs, MLAs, bureaucrats and heads of NGOs. 

 From Left to Right and moderates to hardliners, the new initiative ? billed as the first of its kind in Asia and modelled along the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the US ? has drawn appreciation from the entire political spectrum. 

 ?The aim is to bring in professionalism in political management. We have requested all the political parties to sponsor their future leaders for the programme. We think Left parties will like a concept like this and send students,? said former chief election commissioner T.N. Seshan, who is chairman and dean of MIT School of Government. 

 According to Seshan, who conceived the idea, the primary objective of the institute will be to churn out knowledgeable leaders with empathy for the people. 

 To be launched on August 20 with a batch of 60 students, the programme will be split in three trimesters and the course fee will be Rs 2.75 lakh. 

 With GenNext being the focus, the institute is roping in young leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora, Navin Jindal, Sachin Pilot and Akhilesh Yadav. 

 ?We will bring the political leaders to the campus as guest faculty and take our students to the US and the UK to expose them to a different political environment,? said Seshan, confident of giving the country a set of capable leaders in the next decade.

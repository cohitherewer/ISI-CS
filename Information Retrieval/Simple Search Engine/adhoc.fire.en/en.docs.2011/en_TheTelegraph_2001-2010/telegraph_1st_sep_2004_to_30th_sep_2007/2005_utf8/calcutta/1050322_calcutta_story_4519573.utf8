 Changing face of society

 The two great wars of the previous century have caused tremendous impact in world economy, politics, society and culture. The Bengali ethos, too, has not been free from their influence, as is evident in the gradual transition of Bengal?s art and literature. Directed and performed by Bijoylakshmi Barman, Ekti Samajchitra, a kaleidoscopic montage of poems, story-excerpts and plays from the 1930s to the present day, attempts to highlight social changes through variations in poetry and drama. Beginning with a verse collage, including poems of Tagore and other well-known poets of succeeding generations like Premendra Mitra, Subhas Mukhopadhyay and Joy Goswami, the first part of the programme also features an amalgamation of audio-plays (sruti natak) by Syed Mustafa Siraj, Dwijendralal Roy and Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay, all clearly outlining the subtle yet unmistakable shifts in the theme and mood of Bengali literary output over the ages. The second half comprises an interesting collage of plays from the past and present.

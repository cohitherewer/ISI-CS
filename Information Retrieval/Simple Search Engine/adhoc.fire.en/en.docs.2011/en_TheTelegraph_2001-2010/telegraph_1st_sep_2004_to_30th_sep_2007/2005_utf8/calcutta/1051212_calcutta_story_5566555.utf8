 Flights of fantasy

A bridge between two levels of your home, 

the staircase should act as the storyboard for both the floors. Shradha Agarwal 

tells you how

 The staircase isnt just about connecting two floors of your home anymore. With the duplex syndrome fast catching up in the city, the visual impact of the flight of stairs is pretty much on a par with its functional quotient. Call it a transition or a bridge between two levels, a flight of stairs just cannot be ignored.

 The minute you start climbing the stairs, you can view the space below and above at the same time, with multiple perspectives. Compared to the rest of the house, the staircase provides an added dimension from an interesting panoramic angle. Hence arises the need to do up your staircase well, to project the right image of your home, emphasises architect and interior designer Vivek Rathore. 

 While the approachability factor of a staircase needs to be high with an inviting look, wandering eyes on those 15 or 20 steps should get a brief story of the house at the very first glance.

 GoodLife talks to interior decor experts to find out the aspects you need to look into while doing up the steps to a story.

 A tale to tell

 The trailing wall ? the common wall between your home and the staircase ? is one that has its own tale to tell. You can work out a theme for the stairs through pictures on this wall.

 A collage of your ancestral portraits, your kids achievements or a holiday album display helps create a photo essay on the wall, advises Vivek. The right combination of artefacts and personal details here can work wonders.

 The main composition of the staircase is an important detail to look into. A typical example would be a smartly-tiled ground floor that leads up to a cosy wooden first floor ? connected by a staircase, of course.

 The question that arises now is what elements should the staircase contain? You must make sure that the continuity of the two themes is maintained, says interior consultant Meenakshi Dutta.

 Stone, toughened glass, wood or steel ? whatever you choose, make sure it looks like a part of the two floors together, opting for either a neutral design or something that combines the elements of both. 

 Each staircase has a tale to tell; you must make sure that it isnt abrupt. 

 Space out

 Creating an illusion of space is pretty simple, and all you need to do to your narrow staircase is paint it a single shade of any light colour, says Meenakshi. 

 That apart, stairs always come with a bonus space underneath most often used as easy hides for empty crates, old magazines and shoes. But in the process of finding an easy closet under the stairs, you should not neglect the aesthetics. 

 The storage space should be well-panelled and well-covered, preferably something that carries itself below the entire flight of stairs.

 Make this storage space look like a part of the design, rather than something sticking out like an odd patch, adds Meenakshi.

 Decor details

 Photographs, paintings and prints seem the most natural choice for decorating the trailing wall. While your original M.F. Hussain or Jamini Roy isnt best displayed on your staircase, bright and happy prints do well for this zone.

 Family pictures look just as nice. Place the frames horizontally and vertically, something that isnt too linear or predictable. 

 A melange of mirrors, too, can look eclectic on the wall. They could be concave, convex or decorative, says Meenakshi. Go funky or play it down to also provide an increased sense of space.

 The railing, too, can be made effective. Other than iron or traditional mild steel rod, a sleek, stainless steel railing looks best in a minimalist home, advises Meenakshi.

 The staircase well ? the mid-level landing ? is the focal point of the entire flight path. Though one could place an intricate sculpture or some greens, Vivek suggests dynamic characters for this zone. It could be a water jet or a funky light that casts various patterns on the wall.

 Meenakshi recommends placement of artificially treated bamboo. Its perfect for an area that doesnt get too much light.

 The balustrade ? or supporting pillars of the staircase ? can be made to look exotic too. Place plants or small sculptures between the balustrade, says Vivek. Go for tinted, pigmented polish for the handles, he adds.

 Finally, with children around, palm marks on the trailing wall are inevitable. And the best way to deal with this is to go for textured walls. Other than a cover up, a textured span also looks like a real treat, forming an integral part of the decor.

 If texturing exceeds the budget, you can also use regular paint mixed with some lambi, a substance to thicken the paint.

 Light lustre

 The trailing wall, riser, tread, handle or ceiling ? all you need to do is pick your point. Placing tube lights at most strategic points sure is a simple option, but the result, too, is just as shoddy. Lighting the staircase right is a big plus to set the mood of the entire house.

 Vivek suggests reflective, passive light to illuminate the stairs, stressing hard on avoiding harsh lights. You can make a light cove below the nosing of the tread. This will reflect light on the riser, looking both mysterious and at the same time functional, he explains. 

 You can also light the entire path of the handle. Ceiling lights and halogens are other options. You can choose coloured tints as per the requirement, too.

 Since a staircase gives you the double advantage of height, Meenakshi suggests fun and adventurous use of light.

 Drop a beautiful hanging light that ends 10 feet above the landing area. This ensures getting the entire height covered and looks effective.

 Another option is to try mounting lights at random points on the wall.

 Depending on the kind of decor that enhances your trailing wall, you can keep the mood going by focussing on some and baring the others.

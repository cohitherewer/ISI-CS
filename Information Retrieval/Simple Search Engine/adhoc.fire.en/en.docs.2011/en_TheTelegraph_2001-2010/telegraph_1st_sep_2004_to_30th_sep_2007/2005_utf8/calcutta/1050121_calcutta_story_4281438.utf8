Rhymes of India 

A riot of colours. And a kaleidoscope of rhymes. Karadi 

Rhymes Book 2 is out, bringing Indian tradition and peppy music together again 

for children. Simple and evocative, the rhymes are steeped in local flavour ? 

linguistically, geographically and in terms of the religions they speak of. Thus 

when the Karadi Express starts chugging along, the opening rhyme chants ?Chai, 

Chai! Coffee, Coffee?, the typical call of vendors at an Indian rail station. 

Again a rhyme on Prayer Houses has little Madhavi before a Gopuram in Allepey 

while its next stanza talks of Benjamin?s town Panjim and its old church, carrying 

on with Shamser?s mosque in Ajmer and Jaswinder?s gurudwara in Chandigarh. 

 The rhymes, available both in cassettes and on CD, 

is in two volumes, each containing 10 rhymes. It is accompanied by a beautifully 

illustrated book containing the lines. Usha Uthup is the singer, lending her characteristic 

boisterousness to liven up the lines. The second side of the album has been sung 

by a chorus of children.

The project of Karadi Rhymes was born on a hot afternoon 

in Chennai when children were heard singing in chorus: Rain rain go away/ Come 

again another day/ Little Johnny wants to play... (The editors also explain how 

?black sheep?, or ?eyes so blue? of the well known English rhymes are out of context 

in our country). This created a desire among a group of people to put their heads 

together to produce rhymes that are for Indian children and not the legacy of 

colonial rulers. The rhymes slowly unfurled to the music which began to dance 

to the words they were set to. 

The first volume of Karadi Rhymes was released six 

months ago, and has been well received by both schools and the children themselves.

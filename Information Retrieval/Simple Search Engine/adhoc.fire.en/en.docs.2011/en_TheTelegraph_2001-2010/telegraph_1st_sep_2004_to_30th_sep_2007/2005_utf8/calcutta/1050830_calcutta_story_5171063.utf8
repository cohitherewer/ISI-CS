 Dolls Theatre came into being through the efforts 

of some young and energetic artistes from different mediums. It started in 1990 

with puppetry. These young artistes had experience in various aspects of the art 

form, and the content of their productions are rooted in the relationship between 

man and nature. 

 The group has worked through TV and films, attended workshops, performed all over India and abroad and earned appreciation at the International Puppet Festival in Tehran. Taming of the Wild ? A Performance in Modern Puppetry, was held on August 23 at Salt Lake School, in association with SPICMACAY.

 The first episode was Movement in Wilderness, portraying the life of a pair of golden fishes destroyed by an angler when he captures the male fish. But when the fisherman tries to capture the female fish, she, with the help of her friends, attacks and destroyed the angler?s fishing net. With background scores of Indian and western instrumental music as well as dramatic sound effects, the theatre?s director and script designer Sudip Gupta broke new ground to create a poetic and colourful visual language through rod puppetry. 

 The second episode was The World Within, where Gupta used his humour, innovative methods and an eye for the visual aspect. The most elaborate and impressive scene had two larger-than-life storks. A woodcutter tries to cut a small shrub with a variety of tools and machines, from knife and axe and more, but nature saves the shrub. The small plant acquires supernatural powers and with its friends (birds, insects) scares away the woodcutter.

 The third episode was Call of the Wild. The show was a revelation for all present. The theme revolved around flora and fauna. The idea that director Gupta conveyed was ?how man disturbs his surroundings by destroying the environment?. Here, a bird couple learns to play tabla, a feather plays the guitar and a spider learns to dance with them. An egg hatches and that signifies a new era. 

 The fourth episode was A Wild Tale, where the director depicted two kingfisher birds making love on a sea-shore, dancing, eating from the sea... A bird-catcher catches the male bird, and the female kingfisher tears away the net with all her strength. Again, Gupta signifies a new era through an image of a pearl rising from its shell. 

 After the show, Sudip Gupta showed us how they perform the puppet show. It was a wonderful experience.

 ?Dilli door nahin!? Nazarius radiates with joy as he narrates his experience of participating in Project Concern International/India?s (PCI/India) AIDS Walk for Life as a core walker. Nazarius, 23, originally from Jharkhand, has been settled in New Delhi for the past few years and works with an NGO as a peer educator. He says: ?Delhi is not far ? not because we are nearing home, but because we have come such a long way from Delhi with the message to fight the battle against HIV/AIDS.? 

 On August 22, the fourth day of the walk in West Bengal, the team entered Kharagpur, West Midnapore, as evening fell. The Kharagpur branch of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, an NGO working with sex workers, organised a short welcome programme at Kaushalya, the entry point of the town. Various government and non-government organisations working on HIV/AIDS welcomed the walkers. A number of street-based activities were held en route, with people greeting the walkers enthusiastically. 

 Later in the evening, another programme was organised in the municipality building to welcome the walkers. The programme was attended by Dr B. Mahapatra, deputy chief medical officer of health, West Midnapore; Dr Balaram Biswas, assistant chief medical officer of health, West Midnapore; Rabisankar Pandey, chairman, Kharagpur municipality; and Gayatri Bhowmik, vice-chairman, Kharagpur municipality. Hirananda Misra, team leader and coordinator of the walkers? team, and Dr Ramachandran Rao, medical officer with the walkers? team, were also present. 

 The night shelter for the walkers was the Kharagpur municipality office building. The walkers resumed the next day, with a large number of people joining them in their mission to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS across the country. 

 The walkers? team is being accompanied by a mobile clinic that provides general medical care as well as treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS-related counselling and testing referrals. 

 The walk initiative has been organised by PCI/India, with support from National AIDS Control Organisation and the AIDS control societies in the state through which the walkers pass. Other agencies partnering PCI/India nationally include CARE India, Indian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, Population Services International, Save the Children, TCI Foundation, UNAIDS India and USAID.

 Graduates of the 2005 batch from the Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM) celebrated Independence Day in a unique way. Five alumni of the institute ? Ahana Mitra, Farhat Rahaman, Hemant Dujari, Mitranjan Bhaduri and myself (Pinaki Sengupta) ? brought out an electronic magazine on ?e-INDIA: The Road Ahead!? on August 15. The e-magazine was released online by Prof Y.S. Rajan, veteran academician and co-author of the book India 2020: Vision for the New Millennium with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. 

 The project was supported by India Vision Club. Prof Rajan also had a chat session with people participating from Coimbatore, Chennai, Calcutta, Delhi, etc, and from the US, after releasing the e-magazine. 

 The magazine as well as the chat script can be viewed online through http://www. indiavision2020.org/chat_ysrajan.htm. The young engineers of IEM proved how technological knowhow and domain expertise can be synergised with patriotism to bring out something positive, using readily available resources on the Internet. 

 IEM director Satyajit Chakrabarti was the patron, while Prof T. Datta was the chief editor. ISRO senior scientist and a former project associate of President Kalam, Samiran Das, was the guest editor. Besides several articles on possible rural empowerment of India through IT-enabled services, the e-magazine also featured an exclusive interview of astronaut Thomas Reiter of space shuttle STS-1 of the European Space Agency by the guest editor.

War of words

 ?Propaganda, not substance, sells today? was the motion put before the house during the inter-year debate organised by the Debating Society of Loreto College on August 18. Three teams represented the three years, and there were three mixed teams, too.

 A variety of issues were brought up by both sides, some being common to every speaker?s argument. Advertising was the focus of the debate, followed by politics. Amitabh Bachchan, too, seemed to be the main representative of ?propaganda?, though the opposition vehemently argued that products sold solely due to his ?substance?. As one speaker put it: ?Man buys nothing. Everything is sold to him, whether it be products, governments or even information and thoughts.? 

 Bush?s re-election was cited as the best example of propaganda winning over substance. However, the opposition believed that it was because Americans were assured of Bush?s substantiality that he got re-elected. Closer home, the India Shining campaign was repeatedly brought up, making one wonder whether it didn?t succeed because propaganda or substance failed. 

 To highlight the point ?substantiality is a matter of perspective and propaganda seeks to alter that perspective?, the success of the K-serials over the more substantial quiz shows was brought up. But it was consistently argued that nothing would sell without substance and that man was intelligent enough to discard something lacking adequate substance. 

 Both teams presented strong arguments. Each speaker was cross-questioned by the moderator and society president, Kamya Jaiswal, and the participants. The audience, too, contributed to the debate. 

 Before the winners were announced, an audience poll was taken. The majority voted against the motion. Indira Dutta and Shaon Roychowdhury of the third year were jointly declared best speaker for the motion and Syandika Dutta of the second year was adjudged best speaker against the motion. The best team award was won by the mixed team, comprising Indira Dutta and Syandika Dutta.

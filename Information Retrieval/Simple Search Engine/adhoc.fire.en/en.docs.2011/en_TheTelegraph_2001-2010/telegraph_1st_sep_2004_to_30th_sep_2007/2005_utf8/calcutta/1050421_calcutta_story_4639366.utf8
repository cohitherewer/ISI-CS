 The students of Jadavpur University?s engineering and technology faculty boycotted classes for the third day in a row on Wednesday, even as a legal twist was added to the controversy over the executive council?s recommendation to expel five students.

 One of the five, Samrat Roychoudhury, a final-year student of civil engineering, filed a writ petition in the high court challenging the showcause issued on April 13.

 ?A scuffle broke out on September 16, 2003, over demands for special supplementary examinations. A commission was later set up to probe the matter. My client?s name figured in the panel?s report,? said Kaushik Chanda, Samrat?s lawyer.

 ?He was present on campus on September 16 but was not involved in the agitation. The witnesses, whose statements were recorded by the commission, had heard Samrat?s name mentioned in the ruckus and thought my client was present,? he added.

 The four other students, meanwhile, met registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay and handed over their replies to the showcause notice. Bandyopadhyay later said he would need time to go through the letters, each of which comprises more than 30 pages.

 A delegation of the faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) met vice-chancellor Ashoknath Basu and submitted a memorandum, demanding that the recommendation on the expulsion be withdrawn. The members also demanded that a meeting of the council be called by April 27 to resolve the issue.

 The students reiterated that they would boycott the upcoming semester examinations to protest the vindictive attitude of the authorities.

 While Bandyopadhyay and Basu could not be contacted, dean of the engineering faculty Manoj Mitra said: ?I can comment on the matter only after going through the students? replies to the showcause notice.? 

 Throughout the day, Fetsu leaders ran a signature campaign to draw support for their cause. ?The September 2003 agitation was absolutely justified and successful. This has been borne out by the fact that the semester examination system will change from the next academic session,? asserted Fetsu general secretary Amit Chakraborty. 

 ?As the authorities had accepted the spirit of our demands, their attempt to pinpoint five students from a 250-strong crowd can only be described as vindictive,? he added.

 During the September 2003 agitation, the students had asked for special supplementary examinations after each semester, declaration of the results within 30 days of an examination and a continuous evaluation system.

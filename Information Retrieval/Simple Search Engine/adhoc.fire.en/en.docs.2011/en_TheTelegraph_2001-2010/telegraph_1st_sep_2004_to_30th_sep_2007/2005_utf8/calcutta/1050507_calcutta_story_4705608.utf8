The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Break in Rajnis hearing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The defence lawyers in the Rajnis Patel death case took turns on Friday in cross-examining Aswini Kumar Samanta, secretary of SSKM Hospital and acting secretary of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research, for the second day at the Alipore court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate Manjit Singh. 

 Rajnis?s mother Munni Devi sat through the proceedings, wearing a pensive look.

 During the hour-long grilling by defence lawyers Asish Khan, Dipit Basu and Chandi Bagchi, Samanta identified the signatures of doctors D. Banerjee and Michael Hira, who had signed the attendance register each time Rajnis was operated upon.

 Samanta affirmed in court that investigating officer (IO) Supriyo Pal had seized the attendance register on July 4, 2003. He had signed the seizure list before the IO returned the register to him. Samanta then identified the seizure list and reaffirmed that the IO had recorded his statement and prepared the seizure list.

 Public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh submitted a petition to recall the witness. The court allowed the petition, considering that he wanted to clarify points that were crucial to the case.

 The court was then adjourned for the day and the next hearing fixed on June 13, post-summer vacation.

 Munni Devi, the dead cricketer?s mother, told Metro that Rajnis?s father Manoj could not attend the hearing on Friday as he was at his native home. Manoj had fallen ill and was not in a position to return immediately, she said. 

 She herself had arrived in Calcutta only on Thursday.

 After the hearing, Munni Devi went up to the public prosecutor to inquire about the pace of the proceedings. ?How long will the case drag on? We are tired of awaiting a verdict? we have waited for a long time now,? she said.

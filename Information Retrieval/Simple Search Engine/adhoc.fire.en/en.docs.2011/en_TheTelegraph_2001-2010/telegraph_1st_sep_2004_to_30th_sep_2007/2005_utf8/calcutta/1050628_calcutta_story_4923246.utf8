 Thirsty man kills teen

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A scuffle over a glass of water between a drunk man and an 18-year-old tea-stall worker resulted in the youngster?s death in Burrabazar on Sunday night.

 Police have arrested the culprit and booked him on charges of culpable homicide, not amounting to murder.

 It was around 11.30 pm on Sunday when 22-year-old Mithun Ghosh approached Pramod Kumar Yadav at the tea stall in Raja Katra and asked for a glass of water to drink. ?He was drunk and thirsty. All the shops and roadside eateries in the area were closed by then,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 ?Yadav did not pay heed to Ghosh. When Ghosh persisted, Yadav refused him outright,? said an officer of Burrabazar police station. Ghosh, a resident of a neighbouring locality on MG Road, was infuriated by the blunt refusal. An altercation broke out between the two, resulting in a scuffle.

 ?Suddenly, Ghosh pounced on Yadav and punched him on the head. The blow was enough for Yadav to slump to the ground. He lost consciousness,? the officer elaborated.

 On hearing the commotion, people from nearby shops and pavements rushed to the spot, to find Yadav lying unconscious in front of the tea stall. They caught Ghosh and alerted the local police station. Some of the local people then took Yadav to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. ?He died because of internal haemorrhage. Had he been brought here immediately after the incident, he could have been saved,? said a doctor.

 During preliminary interrogation, Ghosh confessed that he had hit Yadav after he refused to give him water to drink. ?But I had no intention of killing him. I had never thought that I would kill someone. The punch hit his head accidentally. I attacked him when I was trying to defend myself,? he said.

 Taking Ghosh?s intentions into account, an officer said: ?This is why we have not booked him on murder charges. It was a crime he did not intend to commit.?

 A similar incident had taken place in the Karaya area earlier this month. ?During a visit to his in-laws? house, Sheikh Daulat Ali found his gold ring missing. Next day, he saw his brother-in-law, Sheikh Asgar Ali, wearing an identical ring. He accused Asgar of stealing it but Asgar denied the charge. Daulat lost his temper and slapped Asgar, who lost consciousness and then died.?

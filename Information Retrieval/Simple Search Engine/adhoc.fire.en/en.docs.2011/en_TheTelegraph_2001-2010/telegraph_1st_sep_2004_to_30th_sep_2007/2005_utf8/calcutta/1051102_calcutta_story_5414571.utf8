You feel it in your fingers, you feel it in your toes? 

Yes, love could be all around you, but so is winter! That dip in temperature and 

that cool breeze teasing your tresses.

 Sadly, winter is not all about a hot cuppa and a warm romance. Lets cut to thirsty skin, cracked heels and extra pounds under those extra layers. Like all things changing, this new season also demands some extra attention and care, especially at its onset. 

 Here are simple lifestyle shifts, the GoodLife guide to welcome these wonderful winter months (or maybe weeks):

 Skin care

 The winter months dont call for too much exfoliation but keeping the body constantly hydrated is very essential, says Rutu Tawde, manager at the day spa Solace. She recommends an almond-based cream for parched skin and a light day lotion for an oily type.

 Indeed, hydration is the byword to fight all the unwanted flakiness that winter brings along. One must also incorporate a weekly massage ritual to increase flexibility and improve blood circulation.

 Unlike summer time, when comprehensive facials are a must, a good clean-up is all that your winter routine demands, adds Rutu. 

 Your hands and feet need special winter care and in most cases, pampering them a little before time saves a lot of trouble ? and often embarrassment.

 An instant pick-me-up is a warm-water footbath to which few drops of an essential oil are added. Use a pumice stone to scrub away the dead cells on your heels and then lather on a creamy moisturiser.

 This goes a long way to prevent and heal cracked heels. A weekly manicure should also ensure smooth hands through the season.

 Regular hair spas and deep conditioning is a must during this time too. A good conditioner seals the hair shaft while protecting it. Keep the hair clean to ensure the perfect bounce and swing in your step, says hair and beauty expert June Tomkyns.

 Diet dos

 Endless plates of cookies with endless cups of warm cappuccino, chai and hot chocolate? not to forget the red wine and cheese. Theres something about the winters that makes one want to eat. And eat. Going by Ayurveda, maybe its the kaph constituent of the cold season, but anyway its a bad idea to get too carried away. 

 Simple add-ons with breakfast, lunch and dinner go a long way in ensuring great winter health, says diet diva Shikha Sharma. 

 The harsh cold also tends to aggravate asthma and diabetes, hence we should avoid food that contains excess ghee, oil, butter and cream. All these have a high kaph element, adds Shikha.

 Carrot, beetroot and amla juice in the morning acts as a good detox agent. Apart from being great for the skin, with all the vitamins and enzymes in place, it also works wonders for the system. 

 Winter is also a great time to enjoy a healthy, low-carbohydrate dinner. Prepare a hot soup with lots of herbs and complete your meal with grilled vegetables, chicken or fish, advises Shikha.

 Theres nothing quite like some well-barbecued meat or vegetables on a cool windy night.

 One can also introduce a leafy, crunchy salad with lunch to complete the health-food act, perfect to fight the winter sluggishness.

 Workout

 Winter also means lots of outdoor parties that include garam-garam fries and steaming hot chocolate desserts. But does that give us a reason to spend the next day tucked in bed with comfort food? 

 The answer is pretty much the opposite, says fitness expert Preetom Mukherjee Roy. Balance out the garden parties with a gym session. Its easy to hide the flab in multi-layers but I would ask people to use the beautiful winter months to attain the perfect swimsuit shape, he advises.

 Limber up with your sports gear and hit the badminton court, go horse-back riding or strike a tennis forehand or two.

 Walking is such a treat during these months that one doesnt mind those few extra steps to reach a destination.

 But if the gym is more your thing, here are some pointers. Preetom advises additional layers of clothing in the gym and shedding them one after another once the body begins to warm up.

 Technically, there might not be any change in our bodys metabolic rate but since we tend to sweat less, its important to do a daily session of cardio, says Preetom.

 Winter months spell more energy, and with the feel-good factor on a high, maybe the time is right to build up that perfect physique and improve stamina.

 Fashion facts

 Calcutta winter demands layered clothing, so stocking them up is quite essential. Its not cold enough to wear a thick woollen sweater but a cotton knit alone isnt adequate. Carrying a light jacket is a good option and a pretty stole looks fetching, too.

 so, the colour story of our wardrobe changes, so quit the stark white and pastels and choose from deeper hues. Turquoise changes to navy in colder months and beige graduates to camel and then dark brown, offers designer Agnimitra Paul.

 Though black is almost the all-time winter uniform, traditional winter colours like charcoal, navy and maroon also look stylish.

 Accessorise your ensemble with faux fur trimmings, leather and go for closed shoes. Another advantage with winter is that nothing looks too much, so go all out with chunky earrings, neckpieces, shimmery clingy tops and caps, adds Agnimitra. 

 Just chill

 One can also add oomph with the help of some cool tricks. Try swapping your dark glasses for lighter ones and face the soothing winter sun. Try a nice shade of pink or powder blue for the eye gear.

 Balance this look with a deep mouth ? maybe you could ditch the nude lippers and dare to go red.

 One should also give up fruity and light perfumes for a stronger, more exotic variety during the winters. It stays longer, leaving a deeper, sexier effect.

 And while we are at sexy, whats more alluring than wind-swept, wild hair? Especially at a time when there is no sweat or heat compelling us to tie it back. So, curled, wavy or straight, hair looks best when left open when the chill factors on a high.

 The ideal length to wear your hair in winters is either just above the shoulders or way below it, says June Tomkyns. But hair tucked inside collars and jackets looks very unkempt.

 She suggests a smart, one-length haircut but prescribes some layers if your hair isnt at its best. 

 Colouring your hair in cooler shades is a big no-no for this season and one should opt for warmer, richer tones in cinnamon or golden brown.

 Many of us tend to regard sunscreen as a summer essential, but considering the increased number of hours we like to spend outdoors when the Celsius slides, its actually more of a winter tool. One must pick up the habit to re-apply it every two hours. 

 Finally, skim through your handbag and youll realise how non-winter-friendly it is. So throw in some chapstick, a hand cream and a soft stole. Then, face the freeze?in style.

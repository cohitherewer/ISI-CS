 The season of colours, carnivals and parties is all set to kick off. And before the celebratory mood of winter peaks and you have a host of parties and social dos to attend, its important that you master the makeover tricks of the weeks ahead.

 Says Lakme make-up expert Clint Fernandes: Winter is easily the season to go high on make-up and put all your imaginative skills to best use.

 Keeping the vibrant mood of the season in mind, Lakme has come up with a new look for winter titled Mosaic. The new fashion statement, which is all about unimaginable colours coming together to form a kaleidoscope of colours, transforming the mundane into the magical, was showcased last month at the star-studded Lakme Grand Finale Winter 2005 show in Mumbai.

 The look was transcreated on clothes through the expressions of designers Malini Ramani and Suneet Verma.

 The Mosaic collection that I have created is a fantastic mix of vibrant festive colours and rich jewel tones. It keeps in mind the Indian woman and the festivities during the winter months, says Clint.

 On the ramp, Malinis interpretation of Mosaic showcased the mystical side of the concept. She took the audience through a magical adventure of colours, moods, textures and beads, fused together to interpret the statement.

 Suneets interpretation, on the other hand, brought in natural and earthy patterns and motifs.

 I worked with the jewel part of Mosaic. Hence colours like deep maroon, deep emerald green and dark navy were found aplenty in my collection. These hues are very much in fashion this season and works wonders for the Indian skin tone, says Suneet.

 GoodLife, in consultation with experts, finds out whats hot on the make-up front in the winter months.

 Tan trend

 Theres no saying goodbye to that tan, even if the summer months are way past us. For make-up expert Ambika Pillai, winter is the season when nice is out and naughty is in.

 You can go really overboard with the tanned look this season to perfectly complement those earth-coloured outfits, which seem to be so much in vogue this season, says Ambika.

 For the day look, you can use a cream-based foundation or a translucent powder with light blusher over it. For the evening, go for a glossy foundation, add to it a bit of bronze shimmer and youll be all set to rock. Also apply a little blusher to bring out your cheekbones, suggests Ambika.

 The Lakme Mosaic range boasts a bronze shimmer and silver flesh shimmer that are part of the eye-shadow range but can double as facial bronzers and cheek highlighters. These are good picks if youre planning to don the tanned look.

 Eye appeal

 Eye make-up continues to be big this season and the forecast here is lots of colour.

 For evening dos, add drama to your eyes with three different glamorous Mosaic eye looks. These are a fusion of eye colour, dramatics and irreverent strokes. These stunning designs and appliques, when topped with the bronze or silver flesh shimmer, will see you start a revolution, says Clint. 

 The woman on the move can use the dual definition eye sticks, with colour on one end and kohl on the other, which simplifies eye make-up.

 For the day look, Ambika suggests a mild version where you can line your eyes with black, brown or blue kohl and apply light-coloured eye-shadow. The real experimentation should be for the evenings. Curl your lashes and apply heavy mascara on them. Use a dark eye-shadow and smoke out the kohl. Apply a little bit of shimmer on your eyelids, just above the eyeballs so that your eyes look nice when you move them, explains Ambika.

 City-based make-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar, too, is all for heavy eye make-up. With the sultriness and humid weather behind us and the party season knocking at the door, this is the time to experiment, says Aniruddha.

 He recommends eye-shadow in a combination of rich and warm colours like black, fuschia and raisin.

 When you are going for heavy shadow, keep the kohl toned down. But if you want the smoky look, which again is quite hot now, then go ahead with your eyeliner and kajal and mellow down the shadow. However, a touch of shimmer is a must, adds Aniruddha.

 Red rage

 Red is back and with a bang. After seasons of pinks, peaches and nudes, the vintage scarlet lip look is here to complement your party wardrobe.

 Winter sees lots of black in our wardrobes and red lips go very well with any black outfit, says Ambika. 

 Warm hues of burgundy, ruby and gold find place in the new range of lip colours from Lakme, based on Mosaic. 

 Suneets warm tones of burgundy, ruby and gold are reflected in the dual-colour lip halves, a first-of-its-kind concept in India. They are also the hottest pick of the season, says Clint.

 He adds: Malinis palette being in cooler shades of lilac, blue and aqua, flesh-toned shimmers and mauves were my choice. This is apt for the day look. However, the colours from both palettes are such that they can be mixed and matched each time to render a new look.

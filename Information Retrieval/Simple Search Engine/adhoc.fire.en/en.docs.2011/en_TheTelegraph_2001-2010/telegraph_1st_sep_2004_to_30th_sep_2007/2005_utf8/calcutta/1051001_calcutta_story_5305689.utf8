 Promoters kill activist

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A CPM youth wing activist was killed by a group of real estate developers following a dispute over land on Friday.

 Sona Sardar, 39, was stabbed on Thursday evening at Bansdroni, in the Regent Park police station area, and he died in a private hospital on Friday. Four men have been arrested.

 Sona?s grandfather, Keshab Naskar, owned a house on a five-cottah plot at Bansdroni Madhyapara. Naskar, who had died several years ago, had rented out the house. A group of promoters was eyeing the plot and wanted to forcibly evict the tenant.

 On Thursday, the promoters and their musclemen came to the house and threatened the occupant of the house with dire consequences if he did not vacate the building. When the tenant refused, the goons started beating him up.

 Neighbours tried to resist but bricks were thrown at them. On hearing about the incident, Sona, a member of Democratic Youth Federation of India, the youth wing of CPM, along with other leaders, rushed to the spot and asked the promoters to leave the premises immediately.

 A scuffle ensued and Gopal Naskar, one of the promoters, stabbed Sona with a knife. The assailants then fled. Sona was taken to MR Bangur Hospital, where his condition deteriorated at night. He was shifted to a private hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries on Friday.

 - What?s been happening this week

 Thank you, teachers

 nThe students of first year English (honours) of Mrinalini Dutta Mahavidyapith, Birati, teamed up to gift their teachers an evening of fun on the campus on Teacher?s Day. The teachers were delighted to see the girls turn up in saris and the boys in panjabis. First, mementoes and bouquets were given out to the professors. Rabindrasangeet recitals and an exceptional performance of Chitrangada was up next. Tagore?s Tumirabe nirabe?. drew the most applause from the teachers. The programme concluded in a light mood with a session of jokes. The best part of the event ? the delicious munchies arranged for us by our professors. Thanks for everything, dear teachers.

 nThe student council of Calcutta Boys School decided to celebrate Teacher?s Day this year with great fanfare. Each student contributed a small amount beforehand, and a cake and gifts for the teachers were bought with it. Our three senior-most teachers cut the cake. The school band put up brilliant performances, while Class XI students staged a Bengali play by Rabindranath Tagore.

 nThe students of Maharaja Manindra Chandra College celebrated Teacher?s Day in a special way last Monday. They took the stage to talk about their teachers, the relationships they share with them and some cherished memories of the classroom. Then, the students presented a dance programme and a couple of melodious Rabindrasangeet recitals. The college band was a hit with its rocking performance at the end of the show. The teachers enjoyed every bit of it.

 Confess plea by comrade in kidnap

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Days after scheming and finally abducting Roma Jhawar from Salt Lake, one of the partners-in-crime seems all set to make a confession. 

 On Wednesday, Dilip Baidya, the man who provided Gunjan Ghosh and his accomplices a safe house in Sodepur, expressed his desire to speak his mind before the court through the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), in charge of the probe. 

 Around 11 am, when Baidya was produced in the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Alok Chaudhury, the CID made an appeal claiming that Baidya was willing to make a confession under Section 164 of the CrPC. 

 The words made everyone sit up. The SDJM accepted the appeal and referred Baidya to judicial magistrate Bipasha Mondal. A resident of Natagarh, Baidya was then escorted into the room of the judicial magistrate, where he spoke at length, behind closed doors. 

 Subsequently, Baidya was offered 48 hours to make up his mind. He will be produced in court again on Friday to make his confession. He will be kept in an isolated cell inside Alipore Central jail to give him the opportunity to make up his mind. 

 Hours after the kidnap, Gunjan and his accomplices had driven Roma Jhawar in a red Maruti van to Dilip?s Sodepur house to buy time as the bargain for ransom continued. The 20-year-old Roma watched Sholay and played Ludo. They left Baidya?s house in the evening. 

 ?By that time, Roma?s abduction was already in the news and even if Baidya did not realise it, he should have informed the police the next morning. But he preferred to keep mum,? said a CID sleuth. 

 Baidya was arrested soon after Gunjan was rounded up, for being ?a party to crime? and conspiring with the abductors.

 While CID top brass denied comment, insiders claimed Baidya?s decision will help the CID strengthen its case in the court of law. Soon after the proceedings, the CID sent Gunjan?s Maruti van for a forensic test.

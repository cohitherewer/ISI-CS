 Singing to Swiss climes

Abhijeet Sawant, 24, is already busy recording 

his first album and is looking for a ?free week? to fly off to Switzerland with 

his family. He spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about life before and after the 

Indian Idol title

 Abhijeet Sawant greets a young admirer during 

a road show 

 What were your first reactions when you were declared Indian Idol?

 I didn?t feel anything. I was rather shocked for the first two minutes after Mini (Mathur) announced my name as the winner. Then I just hugged Amit (Sana), the runner-up.

 What did Amit tell you after you won?

 He told me to take care of myself and to take care of my voice.

 Did you feel bad for him that he couldn?t make it?

 No, I didn?t feel bad for Amit. He may not have become the Indian Idol but he, too, has got a great platform. He is getting a whole lot of opportunities. He will also become a big name in the world of music in the next couple of years.

 Did you ever seriously believe you could go on to win the title?

 I never thought things would happen this way. My whole idea of participating in the contest was to get some amount of recognition for my singing abilities.

 What has Indian Idol taught you from the day of the audition to the day of victory?

 This whole journey has been a very big experience for me. What I learnt from the competition is very simple ? if you put in the same perseverance for everything you do, big or small, you will surely succeed at the end of it all.

 What does the prize money of Rs 1 crore mean to you?

 One crore rupees is a huge thing for my family. My dad?s income is less than two lakh rupees per annum. So you can very well realise how big the money is for us.

 Going back to the contest, which were your happiest moments?

 There were two of them. Once when we all sang together for the tsunami victims and again, when we sang the AIDS song on the final episode.

 I felt that through music we could do something not just for ourselves but for our country.

 What was the experience of meeting Richard Gere?

 I didn?t know how to talk to him. He is such a big Hollywood star. So I was a bit sceptical as to how he will react to us. But he turned out to be very friendly. He was so happy to learn how AIDS conscious we all were. I promised him to do my bit for spreading the AIDS awareness programme that the Richard Gere Foundation aims to start. I also went and met many AIDS-affected kids at a HIV Care Home in Delhi.

 So where do you go from here?

 I want to sing playback and also make a foray into Indipop music. But it is playback where I really want to make a mark, because singing playback involves more feelings.

 I want to work with the likes of Anu Malik, A.R. Rahman and Ismail Durbar. I would love to sing for Shah Rukh Khan.

 What was your family?s reaction to your win?

 I haven?t yet been able to meet my parents after I won. Immediately after the win, I have started to record my new album. I could only speak to them on the phone and my mother just told me: ?You have made all of us so proud!?

 How is the album coming on?

 I have already recorded four of the seven songs in the album. The music has been composed by Biddu and the lyrics have been written by Sameer. The album has a nice mix of romantic and peppy numbers. 

 And when do you get to go on the Swiss holiday?

 As soon as I get a week off. Then I will be off to Switzerland with my family.

What?s on your mind this week

?And 

you feel alright, when you hear the music ring? claimed the Sultans of Swing ? 

Mark Knopfler and his band mates from Dire Straits. Unfortunately, the music never 

rings for ardent classic rock fanatics of Calcutta.

 Our Gods never come down to the city or have to face problems while doing so. This has been the trend, and it hurts me immensely to say so.

 World-class musicians visit the country regularly these days, but do not perform outside Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. I don?t grudge these cities their good fortune, but I want my share of the pie, too.

 The trend started in the late 1990s with Scorpions and continued with Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Bryan Adams and Sir Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones.

 The later two, however, had lit the candle of our hopes, but it was blown out in the wind. And I guess our poor luck will continue with Mark Knopfler, too, giving the city a miss. 

 There must be a thousand reasons why the rockers or the organisers do not think of Calcutta. But there also exist reasons why they should ? we boast of three stadiums, and have no dearth of companies to sponsor the performances.

 And if the crowds are a consideration, I don?t think any other city boasts of more rock fans.

 So can it be that the dhoti-clad men in power and their infamous practices are keeping the musicians out? I, sure, hope not.

 The only respite came in the form of John McLaughlin, jazz guru, who recently lit up a rain-soaked evening in the city, and the likes of the late Shawn Lane, Jonas Hellborg, Steve Topping and Gary Husband. 

 To conclude my lamentation, I would like to say, it is high time the winds of change blow over the city. Believe me, there can be nothing better than a rock concert on the banks of the Hooghly.

 Present perfect

We think so much about our past, the mistakes we made, 

and are so anxious about the doubtful future, but we hardly spend a moment on 

the present ? the lovely now.

 Every day comes with a new promise, but hardly anybody thinks of it. Most of us see a day as an obstacle to be overcome.

 If only we could relax and just love life. We work so hard to achieve our goals, but in the end it is not success that we cherish but the lives of the people we have touched.

 We have become materialistic, but we do not think of what use is money when it can?t buy love, life and happiness. You may find me far too idealistic, but I can?t stop loving life and I am happy because of that.

Painter, 

My Friend

And then, 

On a night of dogs 

and forlorn winds 

and washing of dishes 

I might just die? 

Painter, my friend 

Grant me a canvas then 

Yes, a small one will do 

Not one that touched the forest shrine 

and paint a few hyacinths 

Purple 

Like that evening 

I spilled upon the cobblestone 

(Don?t go by Realism) 

and there must be an insect too 

as the lizard devours

and a maimed finger 

beside a round clock 

With no hands 

but remember, a ring of wax on the finger 

Have a mango tree in summer 

and the gardener walking away 

and see if you can fit in more 

Like a moon in a cave?

 The government on Wednesday asked private contractor Senbo to complete by June 30 all pending work beneath and by the sides of the Park Street and Gariahat flyovers, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).

 In the course of a surprise check, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury made it clear to Senbo chief Kajal Sengupta that the firm would be penalised if it failed to complete work within the set date.

 Sengupta made no promise, but said he hoped to complete the work within the deadline. 

 Though construction of the Gariahat and Park Street flyovers were ready and opened to the public on April 14, 2002, and February 19, 2005, respectively, work on cleaning the stretch beneath them and their adjacent areas was not over.

 According to JBIC norms, the contractor who builds the flyover will have to take up the work to improve the roads beneath the flyovers and its adjacent areas. This work is part and parcel of the whole contract, officers said. 

 According to the vice-chairman of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), the implementing agency for four JBIC-funded flyovers, the Park Street flyover package includes improvement of JL Nehru Road (under the flyover) and at-grade development of the roads on either side of it.

 Improvement of JL Nehru Road from the end of the flyover to the Dorina crossing and erection of guard rails and construction of the divider, too, are inclusive.

 The Gariahat flyover package includes improvement of the underspace of the bridge, construction of special sewerage manholes to connect relocated sewerage lines and at-grade development of the Gariahat crossing.

 ?The norms were the same for the AJC Bose road and Lockgate road flyovers but L amp;T, contractors of those two flyovers, had already completed the work at the time of construction of the flyover. The work was pending only at Gariahat and Park Street,?? Banerjee said.

 Witnessing the tardy progress of work, the transport secretary visited the two venues early on Wednesday, and called up the HRBC engineers and Senbo officers. ?I want all the work completed within June 30, and will not listen to any excuse. It is up to you how you will complete the work. If you face any administrative problems, we must solve it,?? Chowdhury told the Senbo chief.

 According to HRBC officers, the contractors were lackadaisical about completing related work as the construction of the flyovers was over. ?If I don?t prod them, work will not be completed in even a year,?? Chowdhury said.

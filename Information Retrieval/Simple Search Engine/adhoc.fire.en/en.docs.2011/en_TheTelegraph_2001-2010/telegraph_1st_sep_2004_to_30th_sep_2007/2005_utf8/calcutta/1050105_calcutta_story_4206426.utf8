 Osho appeal for the feet

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Sermons for the soul and sole succour for the world 

weary. While the hippie in you may find peace in an Osho ashram, the 20th Century 

guru has spawned a trend for the funky fashionista as well.

A week of non-stop partying in those killer stilettoes 

calls for chic comfort in a pair of Osho chappals (picture by Rashbehari 

Das). Made of bamboo or cane, base fitted with a rubber sole, colour straps and 

cool embellishments like beads, cowries, seashells and even glitter, these are 

as high on comfort as they are on eye candy.

 The Osho World at Forum is a one-stop shop for all things Osho ? books, cassettes, CDs, VCDs, meditative music, robes and clothes for meditation and a number of other products including the Osho chappals, quite a rage with the young and the trendy. 

 ?Our chappals sell out as soon as new stocks arrive. People are now placing orders in advance,? says Rajita Agarwal, store manager. While women opt for flat chappals, ?Allaudin? slippers, as they are called, with square toes curving upwards are the favoured option for men.

The style is being replicated and enhanced in other 

stores across malls and designer boutiques as well. Other makers, in fact, experiment 

more with styles and embellishments while retaining the comfort factor of a bamboo 

or cane base. Apart from looking and feeling good, the slippers, made of natural 

fibres are perfect for those who avoid leather products.

 However, it is advisable to only sport them while the sun shines. Water can easily wreck bamboo and cane, so splashing around in them during the monsoons is a bad idea. Osho chappals make for excellent beachwear though, as its light weight makes it very easy to walk on the sand.

 It is difficult to clean Osho chappals once dirt settles into its porous fabric, so keep wiping them with a moist cloth from time to time to get the maximum life out of them.

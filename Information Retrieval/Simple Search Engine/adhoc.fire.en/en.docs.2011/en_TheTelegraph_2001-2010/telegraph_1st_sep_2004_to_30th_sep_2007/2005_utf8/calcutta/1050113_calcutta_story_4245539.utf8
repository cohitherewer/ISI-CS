 Neglect hint in hospital suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Twenty-four hours after the suicide of 21-year-old Ramesh Kumar in a Howrah hospital while in judicial custody, an NGO on Wednesday charged the hospital and jail employees with negligence. 

 In petitions addressed to the Howrah district judge, district magistrate (Howrah) and the chairman of the state human rights commission, the NGO alleged that negligence and lack of proper care on the part of the district administration had resulted in Kumar?s death.

 Sujit Chatterjee, a lawyer of the Howrah court, who is also associated with the organisation, said: ?This is not the first time such a custodial death has occurred on government premises. Accused Sampad Mukherjee was killed in Presidency jail. The authorities had then tried to hide the cause of the death.?

 ?We have asked for punitive action against those responsible for Kumar?s death,? he added.

 The organisation has alleged that Railway Protection Force (RPF) officials, who had arrested Kumar on January 8, had snatched money from him, which is why he had to go to jail. 

 A member of the organisation pointed out that this was not the first time that RPF had rounded up people from the station premises under a common section of the Railways Act. 

 ?It is a practice of the police to demand money from poor people, who are generally arrested in these types of cases. Those who do not pay the bribe are booked on charges of committing nuisance on the station premises,? said another organisation member.

 After his arrest, Kumar, a resident of Balia district in Uttar Pradesh, was sent to Howrah Correctional Home for a few days. He attempted suicide inside the jail toilet by consuming a bottle of phenyl, but was saved after the jail authorities took him to Howrah District Hospital for treatment. 

 Kumar, however, succeeded on Tuesday morning in his second attempt to commit suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of the hospital toilet with a bandage. 

 Chatterjee said that RPF officials took Kumar to court, where he was fined Rs 175. He failed to pay the fine, as the RPF men had snatched his belongings, the lawyer added.

 ?Five others had been arrested with Kumar, but they were released after they paid their fine. It is not possible that the officials snatched only Kumar?s belongings,? a senior RPF official said.

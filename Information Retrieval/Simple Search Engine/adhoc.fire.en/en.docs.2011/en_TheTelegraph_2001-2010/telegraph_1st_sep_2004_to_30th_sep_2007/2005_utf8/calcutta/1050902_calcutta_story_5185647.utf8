The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 16-hour snag halt for flight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Mumbai-bound Air-India flight was stranded at Calcutta airport for around 16 hours on Thursday, following a snag in the aircraft?s public address system.

 The snag was fixed only after spares were flown in from Mumbai.

 Airbus 310, scheduled to leave at 2.30 am, finally took off around 6.30 pm. Half the 130 passengers, who were to catch connecting flights, were flown out by an Indian Airlines plane in the morning.

 Just before take-off, the pilot discovered that the public address system on the flight was not functioning.

 An airline official said: ?We do not keep spares at every station, as that will increase the cost to a great extent.?

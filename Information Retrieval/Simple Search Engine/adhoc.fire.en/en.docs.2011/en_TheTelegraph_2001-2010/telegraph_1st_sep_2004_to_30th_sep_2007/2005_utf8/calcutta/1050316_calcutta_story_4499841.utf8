The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Back to the real thing

 The American Idol judges, Randy Jackson, Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul

 Now that the hoopla about Indian Idol is over and the winner Abhijeet Sawant is set to fly to the Swiss Alps, fans of good music ? whatever the genre ? are turning their attention back to the original Idol, of the American variety.

 At its peak, Indian Idol got 30 million viewers to vote. That is still some way behind its US counterpart ? which borrowed its concept from the UK original Pop Idol ? with 48 million viewers casting their vote in the season three finale. After crowning Fantasia American Idol number three, the Fox show is back in its fourth season.

And it is clear now, more than ever, what makes this 

show tick. Some fantastic singing aside, two men behind the mike week in, week 

out, manage to keep a smile on viewers? faces: Ryan Seacrest and Simon Cowell.

 Simon, better known as Judge Dread or Mr Nasty, is one of the three judges that comment on the performance of the contestants. Except Simon doesn?t just comment ? by the time he is through with them, the simpering subjects are often reduced to tears.

 Once more, a Briton is cast in the role of the sarcastic, hard-hearted villain, and this music industry veteran fits the role down to the rudest comment. Simon is caustic, to say the least, drawing many a boo from the audience and constant jibes from co-judges Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson.

 But he is rarely wrong, and secretly, everyone loves him. Smart contestants do well to pay close attention to his biting advice. Simon, for his part, has toned it down a trifle this season ? or at least he does his best to deliver his verdict with the most fake smile you have ever seen. Without him, the show would lose the precious humour that saves it from being just another talent hunt.

And then, there is the man Simon loves to make fun 

of most ? the host of the show, Ryan Seacrest. Even the two hosts Sony found were 

not enough to fill the void of a chatterbox like him on stage.

 If American Idol?s slick production (despite being broadcast live in the US) is something every show can learn from, this man who oozes metrosexual is the one to credit most. He ensures the judges? repartee flows, keeps the contestants comfortable (even taking some of the sting out of Simon?s critique), and has even managed to coin a signature sign off for himself (?Seacrest? Out?). And he looks bloody good all the while.

 Both, of course, have successful careers apart from the show. Simon, who started out as a mailroom hand in the music company RCA, has worked his way up to become a BMG Records executive, selling over 25 million albums. He discovered bands like Westlife and 5ive (though he also failed to snap up Spice Girls and Take That).

 Ryan, 29, who made it to People magazine?s 50 Most Beautiful list in 2003, is the host of American Top 40, filling in the shoes of stalwart Casey Kasem.

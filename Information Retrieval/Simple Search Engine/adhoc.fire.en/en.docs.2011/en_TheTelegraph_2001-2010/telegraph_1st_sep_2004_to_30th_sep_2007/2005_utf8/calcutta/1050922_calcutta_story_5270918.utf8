 Natassha: Bindaas babe

 A pretty young thing essaying the role of a perky tomboy is not new in Bollywood. Kajol played it to perfection in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and to some extent in Dushman. Now, it?s Natassha?s turn to do the same in Koi Aap Sa. The Balaji film explores relationships between friends on a campus and also stars Aftab Shivdasani and Deepannita Sharma.

 Last seen parading on the beaches in Krishna Cottage and dancing to Bindaas alongside Sohail Khan, Natassha will be playing a typical tomboy. While she has got the big-screen breaks from time to time ? she debuted in Kuch To Hai ? Natassha has continued to play Anjali in the small-screen soap Kkavyanjali. 

 Those who have seen her tomboy act in Koi Aap Sa call Natassha a ?revelation?. As for the actress, she took the role as a challenge. ?I am quite excited about the movie,? she says. ?It was fun and challenging. It?s a film where I got the opportunity to explore various layers in the character. In a nutshell, the film can be summed up as ?friends may not be lovers, but lovers have to be friends?.?

 But why should cine-goers watch it? Because ?it?s an honest film made from the heart which I believe the youth would relate to?, adds Natassha. 

 Only time will tell whether we can identify with the film and its theme: ?He is not my boyfriend. He is not my husband. He is the father of my child.?

 Usha Uthup with the Fame Gurukul contestants: Share fare

 As things get hotter at Fame Gurukul with everyone trying to outdo the other in the final plunge to glory, there?s Usha Uthup with her 35 years of experience ready to sort matters out. Usha has been with the finalists trying to make them understand the pressures of being at the top.

 ?They are such lovely kids bubbling with confidence,? she told Metro after spending two days with the remaining Gurukul finalists. ?I am just sharing my personal experiences with them so that they can handle the rising pressure better. Success always brings along with it a lot of other things which are not that good. And so the most important ingredients of life remain honesty, humility and just hanging out there.?

 Having never learnt a single note of music herself, Usha is delighted with the opportunities reality shows have brought to talented aspirants. ?I was telling them how blessed they are. They should just keep enjoying and not think about who?s watching them. I remember how I used to think of every member of the audience when I took the stage. But one shouldn?t let that affect you and stop you from giving your best,? the veteran vocalist said.

 Usha will be joining the contestants in singing her evergreen number Jeete hain shaan se... Fame Gurukul comes on Sony every Monday to Thursday at 8.30 pm and on Fridays at 8 pm. 

 The first multiplex in Calcutta turns two on September 25. To celebrate in style, INOX Forum has lined up a whole lot of activities for the big bash, starting September 23. The focus of the second birthday festivities is the patron. 

 Customers coming in to watch a movie at INOX Forum can participate in contests and win prizes like lunch or dinner vouchers from The Park and Princeton Club, gift vouchers from Shoppers? Stop, gift hampers from Yes! stationery and, of course, ample free tickets to watch their favourite movies at the INOX screens. 

 Coca Cola will organise a Hot Seats and Cold Seats promo, where a pre-determined number of seats in each show during this period will get either a hot or cold beverage free. Some lucky patrons stand to win bumper prizes, including TVs, washing machines and refrigerators during the three special days. An INOX contest will also be held all through the weekend on Red FM. 

 The multiplex will be dressed up and decorated in style. The revelry will conclude in a cake-cutting ceremony on the evening of September 25. But that?s not the end. Actress Rituparna Sengupta will visit INOX on October 5 to promote her movie Main, Meri Biwi Aur Woh, co-starring Rajpal Yadav and Kay Kay Menon. 

 ?It?s been two amazing years and the patron has always been at the core of everything we do. Through our anniversary celebrations, INOX will strive to thank them for making the multiplex a roaring success,? says Vikas Syal, general manager, INOX Forum.

 Saif Ali Khan: Shekhar shine

 Having enthralled audiences across the world on the big screen, the Vidhu Vinod Chopra production of a Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay classic, Parineeta, has been released on DVDs by Excel Home Videos.

 What makes the DVD edition of the Pradeep Sarkar directorial debut special is his commentary with the movie. Earlier, only Western films used to have director?s commentaries but Parineeta has set the record straight with Sarkar describing every moment of the making ? why he shot it, how he shot it, and everything in between.

 While the first of the double-DVD set has the movie with subtitles in as many as 15 languages, the second consists of great behind-the-camera action like ?Making of the film?, ?Making of the song Kasto mazaa?, ?Use of light and shade in the film? and an exclusive Saif Ali Khan interview.

 At the launch of the DVD earlier this month, Saif, riding high on the success of Salaam Namaste, said: ?The brilliant features and packaging pertinently reflect the flavour of the film.?

 Arrested for fatal brawl 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 27-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday for the murder of a flower-seller inside Tollygunge?s Southern Market. The 25-year-old victim?s body was found on Monday afternoon.

 Bhisma, as he is known in the locality, had picked a fight with Badal, the flower-seller, during a late afternoon drinking session in the market after it had shut for the day.

 ?Following interrogation, it emerged that Bhisma, one of the three youths detained for the fatality, had murdered Badal. He was subsequently arrested,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner- I (detective department).

 A resident of Tollygunge, Bhisma was a frequent visitor to the market and sometimes sold vegetables and fish there. During the drinking session, he had accused Badal of having more to drink than himself, police said.

 ?When Badal protested, Bhisma hit him on the nose, as the other two watched. The victim tried to retaliate but was pulled to the ground by the two. Bhisma ran out, only to return with a blade used for dressing fish. He slashed Badal on the neck with it,? said an investigating officer. 

 The three then wrapped the body in jute bags and left the place, he added.

 Antonio Banderas at the premiere of Shrek 2

The caped crusader is back ? no, not Batman but Zorro. The Legend of Zorro hit theatres around the city on Friday, and now there?s more of Antonio Banderas on the small screen. Shrek 2, which premieres on STAR Movies on Tuesday, finds the Spanish star lending his voice to the valiant Puss-in-boots, a character based on? what else, but Zorro!

 Are you surprised to hear people say you steal the show? 

 Really? Do you think so? When I saw the movie, the character that made me laugh the most was the donkey. 

 Did they come to you to do a Zorro-type character? 

 No, because at the beginning, when I first got on this, they said the guy was thought to be French, kind of a D?artagnan, from Three Musketeers, but obviously, once I jumped in there with my accent, he became Zorro. I didn?t know that the movie is so related to the actors. I thought it was going to be more a process, like just repeat this line until the line got totally perfect. I probably did it because it?s so technology based that I thought it was going to be almost like being in a tube without any kind of creativity, but it was not like that at all.

 What was the experience of working in an animated film? 

 What surprised me the most is that we were working in solitude and didn?t have other actors working with us. Even when I sung La vida loca, I sung my part totally independently of Eddie, so it is nice just to see it all together. Not only is the animation fabulous, but just the interaction among all the actors, sometimes even stepping on the lines of each other is something we didn?t do when we were recording it. How they edit it, was masterful! 

 What was the hardest scene?

 The hairball scene, because of the gag-and-gag... but it wasn?t particularly difficult. The film-makers thought I did it good with my accent and my (gag) sounds. It wasn?t much of an effort. 

 How does one prepare to play a cat?

 I didn?t do anything special, really. I just went there trying to be as open and as fresh as I could. Actually I was afraid, because at the time I started recording the character I was on Broadway, singing every night, and there are a couple of problems with that ? especially the day I had to cough up the hairball. I spent 45 minutes trying to do that, and then I got to the theatre ? I was working with 16 wonderful ladies ? and they said to me, ?You had a rough night, eh?? I said, ?No, it was the cat!? But there was no special research of looking at cats all day long or anything like that. I tried to do some research with my cat but the only thing that they said back to me was ?meow?. Oliver, my cat, the only way that I can get him to move is by opening my refrigerator. Then he?s there in a second. But if you call a cat, he may not come. Which doesn?t happen with dogs. They?re different types of animals. Cats are very sexy I think, in the way they move. 

 Did your character change in the process? 

 No. The process that they explained to me at the beginning was exactly what we did. They said to me, ?We are going to take material from you. We are going to put it together and animate it. And then we?re going to come back. That?s going to happen seven, eight times.? After we did it the first time, apparently they were very happy with the results and they made the character grow in different directions, adding some things here and there. So the character started getting more sessions.

 You must have a lot of credibility with your children now, right? 

 People ask me if I did this movie for my kids. No. It?s a nice thing to do, it?s lovely to go with your kids to watch a movie which you are a part of, and they enjoy it. I suppose my daughter Stella will remember 20 years from now that she went to the opening of Shrek 2 in Los Angeles with puppy, and that?s nice. But I did it because I was actually in love with the first one and so I had a fantastic reference point. The magic word was Shrek. I actually have it at home and my daughter probably saw it one or two times, but I saw it 10 times. When we did the second part, I understood why the first one shines so much. It?s so fresh.

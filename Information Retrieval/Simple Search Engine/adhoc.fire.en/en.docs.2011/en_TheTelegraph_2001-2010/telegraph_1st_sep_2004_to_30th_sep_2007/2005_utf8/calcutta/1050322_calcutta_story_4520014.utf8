Fun, friends for saviours in saris

 They had no idea what was in store for them. And these girls from Dublin, Ireland, are surprised, shocked, awed and inspired by what they see, hear and experience in Calcutta. It has left them more determined than ever before to do their bit to make it a better place. 

 At the NGO Hope Foundation?s fundraising dinner on Sunday, the 25 students of Alexander College and Mount Mercy decked up in saris chattered 19 to the dozen, reliving every moment in the city since their arrival on Thursday. 

 The trip is a reward for collecting the most amount of money back home for Hope Foundation, by selling chocolates.

 In town for a week working with Hope Foundation, they have been to slums, railway stations and schools for underprivileged children. They?ve been bowled over by the love and affection and saddened by the poverty. 

 ?The children are just so loving,? smiles Lucy Lannigan O?Keefee. ?It was overwhelming. They?re so happy to see us. And they?re so intelligent and smart. Their English is so good.?

 The youngsters? trip to the Tollygunge slums was upsetting, but a learning experience. Next, it is a visit to the kids of sex workers in Kalighat. ?They have so little, but are not unhappy. That?s Calcutta in a way. It?s depressing yet happy, because the people are nice,? says Posy Bullman.

 The girls have even organised fashion shows and rugby matches in Dublin to raise money for the six-year-old NGO. But the trip to Calcutta has prompted them to focus on one particular project. ?We want to concentrate on a school we saw near a railway station, where they literally have nothing,? adds Freya Bielenberg.

 The students in Ireland have been collecting about 80,000 euros a year for the past three years for Hope Foundation, says overseas director Jenny Brown. 

 ?We are partly funded by the Irish government and the Irish people. We are going to start the school project in England. Besides, we have been working with children in tsunami-affected villages in Tamil Nadu,? she adds.

 So far, the trip has been ?overwhelming? and surreal?. A memorable moment was putting nail polish on little girls at one of the slums. 

 A scary experience is riding in a cab. For Jack Lidholm, the only young man in the group, doing ambulance service at Sealdah station was an eye-opener. 

 ?These children have nothing. They just sleep on the platform,? Jack says.

 The group returns home on Wednesday, with renewed vigour and purpose.

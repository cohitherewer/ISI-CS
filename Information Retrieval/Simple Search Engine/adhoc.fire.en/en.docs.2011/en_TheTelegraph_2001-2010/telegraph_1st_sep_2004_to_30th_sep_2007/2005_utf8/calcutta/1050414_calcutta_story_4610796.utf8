The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Runaway nut patient was a boy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The patient with a peanut lodged in the bronchus had been registered as a girl. Four days after the child disappeared with her mother from SSKM Hospital, ENT department officials traced her. 

 But the girl turned out to be a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, and on Monday, a nut was removed from his right bronchus. 

 Sabuj Biswas, alias Munni, was erroneously registered as a girl by the hospital, but on Monday, ENT surgeon Arunavo Sengupta quickly rectified it after the boy was traced to Krishnagar and family members were persuaded to bring him back to the hospital. 

 ?The staff had made a mistake, but that has been rectified. Since the family had already spent a lot and could not afford treatment, the hospital superintendent decided to waive the bills,? Sengupta said.

 Sabuj underwent a bronchoscopy and Sengupta detected a big nut in the right main bronchus and took it out. ?All these months, the nut was causing trouble, but the pathetic part is the problem faced by the child in other hospitals,? said Sengupta.

 Investigations conducted by the hospital showed that Sabuj was undergoing treatment at the cardio thoracic unit of NRS Medical College and Hospital and was admitted there not once, but twice. There, he underwent numerous tests and a painful air drain for suspected pneumothorax (entrapment of air in and around the lungs)

 After failing to detect what Sabuj was suffering from, hospital doctors released him after prescribing vitamin B complex tablets and a normal diet. 

 While discharging Sabuj for the first time this year, the NRS doctors diagnosed the boy?s case as right-side pneumothorax. ?The CT scan of the thorax showed a contra-lateral shift of the media stinum (part of the thorax had moved a bit)? was the finding during the second discharge. 

 The chest department of NRS Hospital finally advised the boy?s parents to go to SSKM Hospital for a bronchoscopy, and sign in at the paediatric department in case of an emergency.

 The boy went to SSKM on April 8, and was referred to the ENT department, where surgeon Arunavo Sengupta admitted him. But his mother disappeared with him at night.

 ?After we convinced them that the boy?s life was in danger, they agreed to come, but said that they had no more money left. So, we decided to provide free treatment to the boy,? said hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi.

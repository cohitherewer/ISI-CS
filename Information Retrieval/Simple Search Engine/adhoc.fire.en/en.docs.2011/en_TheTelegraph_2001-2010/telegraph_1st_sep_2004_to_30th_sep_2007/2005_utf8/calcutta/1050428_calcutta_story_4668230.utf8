The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A dramatic fantasy

 Over the last decade, Nandikar has experimented with fusing elements of music, poetry, dance and other performing arts in its productions. The stage adaptation of Abanindranath Tagores prose-fantasy, Bappaditya, is a continuation of its journey in exploring new dramatic modes. A tale of adventure and heroism which ultimately celebrates the triumph of eternal love, the production carries forward Abanindranath?s distinctive narrative style to deliver a performance that rests as much on its action as on the dramatisation of dialogue. Unfolding the story of its eponymous hero, who, being ignorant of his royal lineage, grew up as a shepherd boy and subsequently became king through his exploits on the battlefield, vowed to avenge being wronged and atone for his sins. Finally relinquishing life and glory to reunite with the one he loved, the play serves as an interesting study of the variable moods of the human mind. Performance by Sohini Halder (Sengupta). Drama, music and direction: Goutam Halder.

 The power of black

 A forthright, almost earthy simplicity distinguishes the works of Beena Pradhan, one of Bengals most enlightened new-generation artists. The ongoing exhibition of her recent paintings bears testimony to her astonishing ability to achieve beauty in simplicity through a choice of themes that are humble and na?ve, at the same time invested with deep profundity. Her artistic oeuvre is aptly represented in the present collection, comprising a series on women, in addition to some paintings based on urban life. Visualising dark-skinned women as an embodiment of female power, her paintings portray ebony-hued, dusky village belles in various moods and poses. Instead of depicting women languishing in a male-dominated world, Pradhan?s art characterises them as proud, bold, sensuous and attractive individuals, flanked by shadowy, faceless males. An accent on lighted ambiences, against which her dark, female figures are positioned, further underscores the energy and dynamism that her characters radiate. Done in acrylic on canvas, her technically perfect works reflect a spontaneity of feeling and expression that raise them to a philosophical plane.

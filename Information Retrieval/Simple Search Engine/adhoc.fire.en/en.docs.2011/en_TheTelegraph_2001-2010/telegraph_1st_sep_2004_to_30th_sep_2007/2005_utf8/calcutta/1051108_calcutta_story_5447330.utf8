 Fresh moves appear to be underway to have the court-ordered eviction of about 18,000 squatters from the railway tracks between Dhakuria and Ballygunge railway stations deferred for some time. 

 In one such move, the organisation of squatters along Rabindra Sarobar, Tollygunge-Ballygunge Railway Colony Sangram Committee, filed a fresh petition in the high court on Monday, praying for an order asking the state and the railways to postpone the proposed eviction drive by at least a year.

 Baburam Pramanik, general secretary of the committee, urged the court to modify its order and grant a year?s time, as ?both the state and Union governments have almost agreed to provide alternative land for rehabilitation of the squatters?. He felt a year?s time might solve the rehabilitation problem.

 A copy of the appeal has been sent to the Eastern Railway authorities, too. Later in the evening, Uttam Majumdar, the lawyer representing the railways, said the appeal is expected to be heard on November 11.

 On Monday evening, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said he has spoken to Trinamul Congress MLA Sougata Roy on the issue. ?I had a talk with Sougata on the issue (proposed eviction). What we have to do in this regard, we must do jointly,? the chief minister told mediapersons.

 The squatters? petition and the chief minister?s comment on the issue, according to the legal experts, are very significant at this point. ?It seems that the state government, considering next year?s Assembly poll, also intends to postpone the eviction programme. Today?s petition is part of the plan. When the matter will come up for hearing, the state government might also pray for time to consider the rehabilitation issue,? they said.

 But even as her party MLA tried to negotiate with the chief minister to defer the eviction, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee appears to be keen on exploiting this issue to boost her sagging image, following her failed movement on October 20 against the Salim Group. She is preparing to kick off a month-long stir on Tuesday to protest the eviction.

 With less than a month to go for Lakme India Fashion Week, designers all over the country are busy getting their creative acts together. While all 61 style stalwarts from various parts of the country are set to dazzle the Capital between April 20 and 26, it?s the grand finale that really promises to spice things up.

 ?A hint of spice and a breath of ice? ? defines the look that designers Varun Bahl and Monisha Jaising will unveil at the grand finale, interpreting the summer statement of cosmetic major Lakme. Called Peppermint, the summer range of cosmetics was launched in the city on Tuesday. 

 Said Anil Chopra, vice president, Lakme Lever: ?In summer, everyone wants to feel fresh and cool and that?s what Peppermint is all about. Internationally, pastels are hot in summer make-up, but for Indian skin tones, a hint of spice is essential. At the same time, one associates summer with ice and hence our line of cosmetics also have a silvery, frosty shimmer. We thought the word Peppermint would describe the look best.?

 Varun and Monisha ? the designer duo who will be interpreting the look on the ramp have worked with two different aspects of it. Monisha, known for her bold and sexy outfits, takes care of the pepper or spicy side, while Varun, who is known for his experiments with texture, brings out the cool minty feel.

 ?I have always specialised in textures and surface ornamentation and that?s what I will use to bring out the frosty, icy feel of Lakme?s summer statement. The colour palette focuses on pastels, with emphasis on minty colours. There isn?t much shine and sparkle, the textures will be frosty yet matte. The clothes will complement the cosmetics,? Varun told Goodlife over phone from Delhi.

 Monisha, who is taking part in the grand finale for the second time, has chosen to work with lots of pink, coral, sand, gold and silver. ?While the colour palette has been given to us by Lakme in synergy with their cosmetics colours, the interpretation depends totally on us. My collection is very Western and very feminine. The dresses are cut at the knee to emphasise sensuality, the silhouettes are lean with volume added wherever needed to create movement. It?s a very spicy look, combining luxury with the hippie lifestyle,? she explains.

 The range of cosmetics includes new shades of lipstick, nail varnish, kohl and lip-gloss. The Kohl Sparklers or coloured kajal, the first of its kind from Lakme, come in three hues ? green, brown and white, while the lip-glosses come in four fruity flavours.

Also adding to the brand?s offering this season are 

a host of salon services that have been launched in 70 Lakme salons across the 

country. ?A special range of aroma products developed on the Peppermint theme 

will be used for the salon services like facial, manicure and pedicure,? said 

Chopra, revealing his plans to set up salons in Calcutta in 2006. 

 Right now the brand has four Centre for Excellence in the country ? in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore ? from where it monitors 70 franchisee outlets in the north, south and west. ?Next year we plan to set up a Lakme Centre of Excellence in Calcutta, with various other franchisee salons in the east. Till now we have 70 salons all over the rest of India and by end-2005 that number will go up to 100,? he added.

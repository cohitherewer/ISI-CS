 Chinese chomp

ZEESHAN JAWED

Chilling out with chilli chicken and merry-making 

with Manchurian fish ? after the Mughlai menu, its time for some Chinese 

culinary delights. A favourite of Calcutta foodies, the cuisine goes down well 

in all seasons and at every occasion. 

 But during Durga puja, the demand for Chinese food increases manifold. Some speciality restaurants lay out lavish buffets to add to the festive flavour, while others spice up the menu.

 We witness unprecedented footfall during the five Puja days. New dishes in the buffet and a relaxed environment are all they want, says Rajesh Dubey, director, food production, Mainland China.

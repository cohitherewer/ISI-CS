 Jewel Co, a boutique housed in HHI, is showcasing its festive collection till October 30. The Diwali and Dhanteras line at the 15-year-old store presents a riot of colours.

 Be it the fresh green of emerald or the passionate red of ruby or the sublime yellow of sapphire, you can see these lovely stones carved into shoulder-hugging chandelier earrings in white gold.

 Precious coloured stones as well as diamonds are set in a range of neckpieces with matching earrings.

 The highlights of the collection are the antique-looking sets. Also on offer are broad bracelets.

 The designs, created by Shweta Lodha and Nikunj Lodha, are essentially contemporary and good for party wear. You can pick up the pieces for anything above Rs 10,000.

 Our jewellery is very chic and modern. We are catering to the changing needs of contemporary Calcutta women who want to dress in smart westerns and accessorise them with real jewellery, says owner Pratap Lodha, a graduate from Gemological Institute of USA.

The Asian Development Bank has okayed a Rs 175-crore drainage and sewerage scheme for Garia and Behala. Around a million residents of the 16 wards, under boroughs XI and XIII in the two areas, will benefit from the project.

 Announcing the bank?s decision, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said: ?Work will start soon on laying underground sewer networks and dredging the drainage channels.?

 It is the first time that the international funding agency has allotted money, from its Rs 1,518-crore loan package for Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, for a sewerage and drainage scheme. Earlier, the bank had sanctioned $400,000 for a pilot project on sewerage in six wards.

 The loan package, signed in 1996, was of Rs 1,245 crore. But subsequent degradation in the worth of the rupee against dollar has raised the amount to Rs 1,518 crore.

 Mayor Mukherjee, however, decried the conditions imposed on the civic body by the funding agency. ?If I were the mayor in 1996, I would have rejected the offer,? he said. According to him, the civic body, despite being enjoined by the agreement to repay the loan with interest, will not have any say in appointment of contractors or modifying the schemes.

 Of the Rs 1,518 crore, Rs 730 crore will be spent on laying underground drainage and sewer networks in the 41 wards of the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur and in six wards of north Calcutta, stretching from South Sinthee to Tallah. 

 In Garia, an underground trunk sewer will be laid in the area south of Tolly?s Nullah and stretching to Garia station and Garia bus stand, covering wards 101, 102 and 110-114.

 Besides laying the trunk sewer, the scheme includes dredging and restoration of the Keorapukur and Renia outflow channels and setting up of lifting pumping stations.

 In Behala, wards 115 to123, east of Diamond Harbour Road, are included in the scheme. The Charial canal will be restored and linked to the Kalagachhi outflow channel. 

 Before sewerage is discharged into the Charial, it will be treated in a plant to be set up in Behala.

 Subhas sheds a tear for north

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The north versus south schism took centre stage in the state Assembly on Monday.

 When it comes to development, south Calcutta looks pampered and the north looks neglected, observed minister Subhas Chakraborty, voicing what residents have so long grumbled or gloated about, depending on which side of the great divide they were.

 ?I am not drawing any line of difference between north and south Calcutta, but the south appears to be much better developed than the north,? said the transport minister. 

 ?For example, you will not find any bus terminus in north Calcutta; buses use the roadside as terminals. But in the southern parts, we have proper terminuses at Garia and Jadavpur,? he added.

 Now, the north could begin to get a bit of its due. The transport department has initiated dialogue with town and country planners, as also the railway authorities, to obtain land for construction of bus terminuses in the north.

 ?The department is considering a proposal to introduce Light Rail Transit (LRT) between Sodepur in the north and Joka in the south,? added Chakraborty.

 The Assembly was also informed of plans to lay a road between Shyambazar and Gariahat with financial assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.

 The attempt at a balancing act is also reflected in the CPM?s choice of mayor and deputy mayor ? Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya from south Calcutta and Kalyan Mukherjee from north Calcutta.

 But a lot needs to be done to correct the developmental imbalance between north and south. Here are just some reasons why residents of north Calcutta can have cause for complaint: 

 Six new pumping stations 

 have recently been commissioned in south Calcutta; the north 

 gets only one

 Almost all roads in south 

 Calcutta are mastic asphalt; in the north, only Raja Dinendra 

 Street and a part of Cossipore Road can match

 Most pavements in south 

 Calcutta have been reconstructed with the modern paver block; 

 the technology is yet to travel north

 About 70 per cent of the 

 CMC?s slum development have been utilised the south

 The drainage system in 

 south Calcutta was boosted by a Rs 30-crore outlay from 

 the CMC; nil for the north.

 The recently concluded business plan contest ? i2i, Ideas to Implementation ? at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta once again proved that campuses across the country are brimming with ideas. 

 More than 140 teams, from premier institutes like the IIMs and the Indian institutes of technology (IITs), took part in the annual meet, organised by the Entrepreneurship Cell at the country?s premier B-school. A wide range of business ideas, from weather derivative systems to risk management, was thrown up during the event, billed as the country?s biggest B-plan contest. 

 On Sunday, the teams behind the top eight ideas got a chance to present their business plans before a distinguished panel of judges. Prashant Raj and Shubham Jain from IIT Kharagpur, representing SAV Networks, bagged the first prize for its product SAVedU. Shantesh Hegde won the second prize, while a team from IIM Calcutta ? comprising Kapil Iyer, Prem Prasad Reddy and Sachin Kulkarni ? finished third.

 ?Besides the cash prizes, the teams also got venture funding from IndiaCo,? said an IIM Calcutta spokesperson. 

 Kalyan Mandal (professor, IIM Calcutta) and Joydip Chakladar (entrepreneur and CEO of All India Live) adjudged the final rounds, where the teams made presentations. The judges quizzed the teams on various aspects of the plan. 

 SAVedU sailed through the grilling session and emerged victorious. According to the SAV Networks team, SAVedU will empower one to visualise, plan and design networks in a way that has never been thought of and will give one the insight into real-life network scenarios. 

 The promise that the tool will be an invaluable one for students, scientists, engineers and researchers went down well with the judges and also IndiaCo, which has pledged the team seed money, sponsorship and other infrastructural support. 

 After the presentations, Shekhar Choudhury, director, IIM Calcutta, addressed the participants and talked about the institute?s commitment to promote entrepreneurship among the student community. Mandal and Chakladar also spoke on various aspects of entrepreneurship.

 Red flags, placards and slogan-shouting staff greeted visitors at Alipore zoo on Wednesday afternoon, as the Alipore Chiriakhana Mazdoor Karmachari Union staged demonstrations and took out rallies to protest the alleged sexual harassment of a female member by a top official.

 The members of the union, affiliated to CITU, submitted a deputation with the authorities, calling for an inquiry into the matter. The protesters also demanded that the ?victim?, who had resigned recently, be reinstated. They threatened to paralyse the zoo if their demands were not met.

 The commotion started late in the afternoon, when around 100 members of the union gathered in front of the secretary?s room near the main gate of the zoo and started shouting slogans. They then rallied around on the premises, much to the discomfort of visitors.

 ?No complaint has been lodged against the accused by the woman concerned. However, we will look into the matter, as a deputation has been submitted to us,? said T.K. Sengupta, the zoo management?s honorary secretary. The management later held a meeting to discuss the issue.

 ?I have been working here for nearly 30 years but have never encountered such a situation. I cannot imagine the reason behind the baseless allegations levelled against me. The so-called victim has not even lodged an official complaint against me. She resigned at her will,? said the official accused of the harassment.

 ?Such a complaint is not the first received by us. Nearly two years ago, another female staff member resigned for similar reasons. This time, we have decided not to let the accused go scot-free,? said Satyabrata Ghosh, working president of the union.

 He added that the matter would be taken up with the state forest minister and the state women?s commission.

 Visitors, however, were irked that the protests had spoiled their day out. ?I came here with my children to have a nice time. Instead, we had to witness the agitation. It was not what I had expected at the zoo during rush season,? said Samar Nath of Dum Dum.

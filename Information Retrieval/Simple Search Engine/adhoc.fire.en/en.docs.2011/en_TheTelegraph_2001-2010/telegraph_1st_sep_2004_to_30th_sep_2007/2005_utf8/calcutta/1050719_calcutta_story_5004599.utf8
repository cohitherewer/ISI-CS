 Cuisine is like the languages 

 we speak. Countries, or in a place like India, states, have 

 been neighbours for centuries but you just cross a border 

 and the language and the food change. Sometimes dramatically; 

 sometimes not quite so much. 

 But where the languages are starkly 

 different, so is the cuisine, like for example crossing 

 over from France to Germany. And where the languages are 

 similar, the food is also not so radically different, as 

 in the case of, say, Bengal and Assam. It is not a hard 

 and fast theorem, but the analogy is startling. 

 So if you step into a place like 

 Jongs, near the Indian Museum at the corner of Chowringhee 

 and Sudder Street, where they do Chinese, Japanese and Thai 

 food, it would be fair to expect that in an upmarket restaurant 

 such as this, there would be three separate kitchens cooking 

 up whatever is on offer. And indeed there are. Because even 

 in the Far East and Southeast Asia, countries may have close 

 proximity but their cuisines have distinct individual parameters.

 Jongs is on the same premises 

 as Zaranj; both places are under the same management as 

 Amber on Waterloo Street which is a landmark in this city 

 and has set a benchmark for good food for decades. Zaranj, 

 which serves north Indian and North-West Frontier cuisine, 

 was Governor Viren Shahs choice when he hosted a lunch 

 for Bill Clinton.

 Jongs is the only place 

 in the chain doing Oriental cuisine but it is the creation 

 of persons with pedigree in the restaurant business and 

 there is a passion for creating a fine dining experience 

 that is quite evident, with a lot of attention being given 

 to detail and presentation. 

 It is an interesting menu, not 

 too large and unwieldy considering that the cuisine of three 

 countries is on offer. However, with the number of Chinese 

 and Thai outlets in the city being what it is, it was the 

 Japanese menu ? small and compact ? that attracted me. It 

 was not like eating a regular meal; more like a tasting 

 session ? small amounts of many different items, from a 

 starter to Japanese style kebabs to a sampling of main courses. 

 Beginning with Tempura Prawns 

 with Teriyaki Sauce set the tone perfectly. I have had this 

 item before and relished it but never has the tempura batter 

 coating been so delicate, crisp and light. The teriyaki 

 sauce ? soya sauce, mirin (cooking sake), sugar and grated 

 ginger flakes ? is an ideal dip for these prawns. 

 The menu lists eight items with 

 Japanese Yakitori, which is basically bamboo skewered fish 

 and meats cooked over a charcoal grill and sometimes the 

 charcoal has wood shavings in it to give these items a smoky 

 flavour.

 The Yakitori Prawns involve marinated 

 prawns in a combination of mirin, soya sauce, oyster sauce, 

 honey, sugar, grated ginger, salt and pepper for a couple 

 of hours before skewering and grilling them. These are served 

 with a sakura sauce dip which is made with mayonnaise, mirin, 

 ginger and lemon juice, soya sauce and seasonings. 

 Sukiyaki Chicken is another grilled 

 item. Here, diced chicken pieces and red and yellow bell 

 peppers are marinated in soya sauce, mirin, ginger and lemon 

 juice, sesame oil, honey, Japanese Wasaba paste and seasonings 

 before being arranged on skewers like shashlik kebabs and 

 grilled over a slow charcoal fire.

 There was also Grilled Fish with 

 Tarragon and Garlic and all these items could be had with 

 the various sauces as dips. 

 Apart from the dips already mentioned, 

 there were several others which really added variety and 

 character to the experience, each with its own subtle nuances 

 such as the Hibachi Sauce, made with roasted garlic and 

 star anise in honey, soya sauce, lemon juice, oyster sauce 

 and chilli paste.

 A main-course item that we sampled 

 was Chicken Teppanyaki which is chicken and mushrooms cooked 

 in butter, red wine and chicken stock. Had with steamed 

 rice strewn with kaffir lime leaves, this is a delicious 

 and delicate dish.

 The surprise up their sleeves 

 at Jongs is that they have introduced a few Burmese 

 items ? the celebrated Khow Swey (panthey khao swey 

 to give its full and correct name), which they do with chicken, 

 curried with coconut milk and stock, served on noodles with 

 an array of garnishes and accompaniments which give the 

 dish its different hues and character and can be made according 

 to the diners choice. They do it well.

 They also do a delicious soup 

 with chicken, green pumpkin and chicken stock called Bodhi 

 Cheta Soup, and a Tofu Salad with fried tofu, shredded lettuce, 

 coriander, green chillies, red chilli oil, browned onions 

 and chilli garlic sauce.

 With the new Park Street flyover 

 having come up, Jongs has now become much easier to 

 access, especially for those from the south. You leave the 

 traffic snarls below you as you cruise across, take the 

 U-turn in front of the Peerless Hotel and get there in a 

 jiffy.

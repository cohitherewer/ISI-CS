 A permanent exhibition centre, complete with a multimedia corner, on the plant and animal life of the Sunderbans will soon be opened in the city.

 The Biosphere Resource Information Centre (BRIC) is coming up at Aranya Bhavan, the headquarters of the state forest department, in Salt Lake, at a cost of around Rs 30 lakh. It is being set up by the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) and Botanical Survey of India, with financial support from the United Nations Development Programme.

 The Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management is providing a helping hand in setting up the project.

 The centre will be unique in its display of the entire variety of plant and animal life of the world?s largest delta, said Atanu Raha, director of the biosphere reserve and chief conservator of forests (south).

 The government of Andhra Pradesh has set up a similar centre in Visakhapatnam, but it focuses only on aquatic animals.

 Raha told Metro that 3,000 sq ft on the ground floor of Aranya Bhavan have been reserved for the exhibition centre. ?Two-thirds of the project is complete and the rest will be ready in a few months. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will open the centre.?

 Entry to the only exhibition centre on the Sunderbans will not be free. 

 ?We will charge a moderate rate from students and scholars and a comparatively higher rate from other categories of visitors. We will also help scholars in their researches,? Raha added. 

 Botanical Society of India deputy director H.S. Debnath, who?s providing technical support to the project, stressed that the centre would help even a ?layman understand the Sunderbans without visiting the delta?.

 Visitors will also be shown a video film on the mangrove forests, along with their plant and animal life and human settlements. ?The 20-minute film will enable the viewers to have a first-hand idea about the delta,? Raha said.

 In the multimedia section, 20 visitors will be allowed at a time to glean information about the biodiversity of the Sunderbans from computers.

 Students resolve to skip exams

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The boycott of classes has now been extended to the boycott of examinations.

 After a marathon round of general body meetings held since Monday, Jadavpur University?s faculty of engineering and technology students? union (Fetsu) declared on Tuesday that it would ?unanimously boycott the semester examinations? to protest the executive council?s recommendation to expel five senior students.

 Acting vice-chancellor Manoj Mitra said: ?I have no information about any such semester examination boycott. All I know is that the deadline for the five accused students to submit their replies expires on Wednesday evening.?

 Fetsu vice-chairman Somnath Ghosh countered: ?The five students have already drafted their replies to the showcause notice and will hand over the letters to the acting vice-chancellor on Wednesday, before the deadline.?

 Ghosh went on to express ?fears? that the university authorities would ?sit on these letters, especially since it is apparent to us that they have resolved to ultimately expel all five?. So, said Ghosh, the decision to boycott the semester examinations.

 Fetsu wants the university authorities to schedule a meeting of the executive council on April 27, where they should decide not to expel or punish the five students, accused of being involved in a round of campus violence.

 ?When we had requested them earlier, we had been told that the council meets at regular intervals, and that it was not obliged to schedule a meeting whenever the students wanted,? alleged Ghosh.

 Fetsu has decided to embark on a signature campaign on Wednesday, involving the entire university. It will then hand over a memorandum to acting vice-chancellor Mitra, along with the replies to the showcause notice.

 The implications of the exam boycott are not lost on the students. ?Several of the final-year students have already landed placements in reputed companies. Many others have plans to pursue higher studies. We are worried that their futures could be jeopardised,? said Ghosh.

 ?But on Tuesday evening, we held a general body meeting and the final-year students agreed to stand by our decision,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Behind the bar

 Md Nadeem Siddique - Asst Floor Manager, Prince of 

Cal Lounge and Bar, Sourav?s

With less than a week to go for the festival of love, 

Valentine?s Day fever is already gripping the city. Stores around town have filled 

up their racks with goodies for presents and restaurants have drawn up special 

menus for the V-Day dinner.

While you might have already finished hunting out 

that special gift for the special someone, it?s time you paid attention to the 

candlelight dinner you?re hosting at home on the big night. 

The exotic menu you are planning will pamper your 

taste buds for sure. But it has to be accompanied by the right kind of spirits 

to get you into the mood instantly. 

While wines and Champagne are the usual favourites 

for Valentine?s Day dinners, you can choose to be different and surprise your 

date with some innovative cocktails. 

Whip them up yourself and impress your partner by 

flaunting your expertise behind the bar.

Strawberry-based cocktails would be perfectly in sync 

with the mood of the occasion.

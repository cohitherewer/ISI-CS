 Marriage: made in heaven, executed by design

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Marriages may or may not be made in heaven, but they?re certainly becoming a very earthly, organised industry. With the ceremonies and their budgets burgeoning, the wedding planner is fast emerging as the single-window stop for nuptial arrangements, relieving relatives of the hassle of designing and distributing cards, receiving and seeing off guests, shamiana design and menu planning.

 ?Even if people have enough resources, putting together the variety of events is a headache. That?s when wedding planners are approached to handle the logistics,? explains Vinod Bhandari of Wedding Xtra Ordinaire. Bhandari?s firm, which welcomed the guests and executed part of the d?cor for the Mittal reception in Calcutta last year, handles around half-a-dozen weddings a year.

 And it?s lucrative, to say the least. Private wedding planners command anything between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the budget, and those hiring the professionals would typically spend between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 5 crore. ?Marriages have always been carefully-planned events. Before, they were put together by the elders of the family. Now, by professionals,? says Sudha Dalmiya, who started out as ?wedding designer? 10 years ago, with teams in Calcutta and Mumbai.

 Selecting a venue, deciding on the spread, finding electricians and finalising the floral arrangements are the most basic needs of every ceremony. But some look for more bang for their buck: forget the horse and have the groom come in on a chopper; enlist elephants as part of the reception committee; bring in some real action by constructing a mock film set at the venue. Most, however, stick to the traditional: Punjabi, Rajasthani or, at the most, imperial themes.

 On the big day, guests are promised a smooth passage, with a control room complete with help desk, inquiry and reception set up at the venue. The staff is connected to the banquet through walkie-talkies. Meeting the last-minute demands of the clients is the most challenging part of the affair. ?When someone is spending so much, he expects it all. We have to be prepared for unpredictable requests,? says Bhandari.

 Work starts well in advance. Managers prefer a lead-time of 45 days to book hotel rooms and tickets for outstation guests. Wedding Xtra Ordinaire gets cracking with a team of around 18 to 20 people. Some five-star hotels also keep a wedding specialist on their rolls. ?A wedding planner is a one-point contact for all marriage-related queries and activities,? explains Srijan Vadhera, conventions service manager, Hyatt Regency. ?Marriages, spread over so many days and with so many activities, acquire the proportions of a full-fledged event. High-profile events call for competent staff who can handle the pressure efficiently,? he adds. 

 The hotel representative, whose services usually come free, takes down the clients? wish list, and becomes the bridge between family and hotel. Other relevant departments of the hotel are also briefed about specific needs.

 ?You can be assured of perfection, professionalism and lots of variety when you hire a wedding planner,? says L.K. Kankaria, who hired just such a service for his daughter?s marriage late last year. ?I wanted to enjoy my daughter?s marriage but at the same time, I did not want to compromise on quality.?

 The answer: wedding planners.

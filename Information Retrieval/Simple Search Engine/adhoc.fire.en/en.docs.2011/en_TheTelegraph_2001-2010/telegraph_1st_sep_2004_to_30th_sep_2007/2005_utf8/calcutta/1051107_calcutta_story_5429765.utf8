 Building sanction boost for coffers 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A special revenue collection drive and unlocking the freeze on sanctioning building plans from the second week of August helped the Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya-led Left Front civic board to register a 29.18 per cent growth in revenue from its own sources during the period April-September over 2004-2005.

 Revenue earning of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was experiencing a slump from April to July and the upswing was achieved by offsetting the shortfall in earning over these four months.

 ?It is the success of the entire civic team, which worked hard to harness resources in the interest of the institution,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Civic revenue officers confirmed that the overall revenue earnings of the CMC had plummeted for five months (April-August 2005) owing to the low rate of sanction of building plans .

 Records reveal that against 105 building construction proposals sanctioned in March, and 131 building plans sanctioned in April-May 2005, the total number of sanctions in June-July and up to the second week of August was only 40. 

 Over 350 building plans have been cleared since the second week of August at the head office and in the 15 borough offices.

 According to engineers in the building department, the new CMC board had to be extra-cautious in scrutinising a building proposal as the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) had raised questions over a number of projects sanctioned by the CMC during the tenure of Trinamul Congress-BJP board. Hence, fewer buildings were sanctioned.

 ?The CMDA has submitted a list of buildings where the Land Used and Development Control Planning (LUDCP) Act has been flouted,? said mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De.

 The engineers alleged that to reverse the downswing in revenue-earning, the former Trinamul-BJP board even directed the director-general (building) to accept sanction fees without verifying records.

 Accordingly, former director-general (building) Ashok Roychaudhury issued circular No. 2 in the building department on April 13, allowing the department to accept the deposit of building plan sanction fees without verifying clearances, like fire brigade, CMDA, urban land ceiling, soil test report and structural feasibility report. 

 A builder submits the necessary clearances at the time of taking up construction work.

 ?It was wrong to have passed such a circular without ascertaining its impact on city coffers,? said mayoral council member De.

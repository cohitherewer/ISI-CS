The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Agency bid to stay afloat

 - CMDA to lease out stack yards amp; expressway for project funds

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The organisation may be in the red, but it?s trying hard to keep its projects in the pink of health.

 As part of the plans to maximise resources, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will use its stack yards, lying unutilised for several years, to support infrastructure projects.

 It is also drawing up plans to rope in a private partner in the construction of the last phase of the Kalyani-Dum Dum Expressway. The partner will be allowed to collect toll tax.

 ?We will identify plots in our stack yards and lease them out to private partners in various projects, who will set up commercial ventures for recovering the project cost,? CMDA chief operating officer P.R. Baviskar told Metro. 

 The agency has seven big and several small stack yards. During the days of licence raj, the yards were used for stocking cement and steel. ?Prices have become comparable since the abolition of licence raj and the yards are no longer in use,? Baviskar said. 

 Among the major infrastructure projects the CMDA has taken up are two flyovers (from Parama Island to Park Circus and from EM Bypass to the Ultadanga crossing), widening of the EM Bypass and construction of the last phase of the Kalyani-Dum Dum Expressway. The projects will be implemented through public-private partnership.

 According to officials, the funds required for the projects will come partly from the mega-city project.

 ?Our resources are not enough to meet the rest of the cost. So, the private partners will be offered plots, which will be used commercially for recovering the project cost,? Baviskar explained. 

 The CMDA employees? union has welcomed the move. ?We have long been demanding commercial exploitation of unused land,? said P.B. Nag, general secretary of the Development Employees Joint Action Committee.

 Work on the final six-km stretch of the Kalyani-Dum Dum Expressway will be taken up within six months of signing the contract with a private partner, Baviskar said.

 Officials estimate around Rs 2 crore will be collected as toll tax every year. 

 The transport department has conducted a survey of the traffic flow in the area and pegged the annual rise in the volume of traffic on the expressway at seven per cent.

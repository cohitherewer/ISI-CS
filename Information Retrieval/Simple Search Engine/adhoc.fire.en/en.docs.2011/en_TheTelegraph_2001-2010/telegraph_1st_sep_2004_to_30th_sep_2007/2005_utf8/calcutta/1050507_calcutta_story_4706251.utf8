The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In full control in cockpit

 - Woman pilot never lost her cool in face of disaster

 ?None of us had realised that there was something wrong in the cockpit, we just thought we were going through a patch of bad weather. It was only after we had landed, when the captain called me in, did I notice the two sun-shaped cracks on both the windscreens of the aircraft.?

 Airhostess Anuradha Dutta-Roy, cabin-in-charge of Flight IC 273 that made an emergency landing at the city airport within an hour of taking off on Thursday evening, recounted her experience in conversation with Metro.

 ?We had completed a return flight to Dhaka and were back in the same aeroplane with the same crew at 12.40 pm. The next scheduled flight was to Mumbai, at 6.30 pm, and we took in the passengers as usual. The gate was closed at 6.30 pm and the pilot, Captain Manjeet Lamba Hirani, said she was ready. The aircraft slowly taxied onto the runway. Until then, it was just a little windy. It began to rain when we started making the take-off run, and it was raining quite hard by the time we were airborne,? Dutta-Roy recollected.

 Five minutes after taking off from Calcutta, the airbus IC 273 ran into rough weather. ?For full 15 minutes, the weather was very turbulent, with a lot of lightning and thunder. Then it got a little better, but the captain announced that we were returning to Calcutta due to a technical snag,? Dutta-Roy said.

 ?While landing, the captain had to make two or three passes over the airport, and we could feel the undercarriage of the airbus being lowered and retracted as many times. All the while, the passengers kept casting curious glances at us, but did not panic as we were all very calm and composed. In fact, we did not know what had actually gone wrong yet. 

 ?The landing was smooth, and we helped the passengers out. Many wanted to know why they had to change planes, and I showed them the two cracked windshields. They were stupefied and wanted to meet the captain to thank her for bringing them safely to the ground without losing her nerve,? she said.

 Dutta-Roy admitted that the reason for keeping calm was that no one but the pilot and co-pilot knew about the cracked windscreens.

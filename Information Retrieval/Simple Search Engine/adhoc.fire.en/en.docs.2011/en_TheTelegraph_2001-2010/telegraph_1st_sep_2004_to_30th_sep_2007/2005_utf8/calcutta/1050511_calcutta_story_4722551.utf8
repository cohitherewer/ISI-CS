The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of men and money machines 

 - Survey 

tracks deposit doubts among atm users 

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 The fear lies with machines, not with men. Banks, striving to reduce costs and raise efficiency, are promoting transactions through automatic teller machines (ATM) by deploying security guards at the 24-hour off-site counters. But a recent survey about customer behaviour and ATMs raises safety concerns about the machines rather than security concerns about the outlets. 

 Over 60 per cent of respondents in Calcutta, quizzed during a survey by ACNielsen ORG-Marg for ATM makers NCR Corporation, said they avoid depositing cheque or cash at ATM counters due to doubts about safety of the deposit, delay in clearance and lack of transaction proofs.

 And so, around 82 per cent of respondents, who otherwise use ATMs for withdrawals, prefer, in most cases, a bank?s branch over ATMs for deposits. The percentage is over 89 per cent for all metros and some major cities.

 ?Studies and market feedback indicate that customers often hesitate to use ATMs for deposits due to the absence of adequate proof of deposit. This is in line with global trends,? said Deepak Chandnani, managing director of NCR Corporation in India. 

 While customers think twice before making deposits at the machines, the ATM (and India has over 17,000 of them, against China?s 70,000) is fast being accepted as a medium of communication between banks and customers.

 Though the time-tested mailers-and-leaflets route is still the best mode of communication for 31 per cent in Calcutta, the survey reveals that around 30 per cent respondents prefer interacting with the banks through ATMs to know about new products and services. 

 Only 11 per cent ATM users here would want to say ?hello? to tele-callers. Marketing cold-calls were found to be the least popular in Calcutta, among the 12 cities surveyed. ?This is an indication that people are in the process of getting accustomed to ATMs. With the increase in penetration, more and more people will start realising the benefits,? said Chandnani. The market for ATMs in India has been growing at a compounded rate of over 30 per cent.

 Tyre timepiece

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 If you live and breathe Formula One and all things auto, this ones for you.

 Sturdy tyre clocks can be the perfect accessory for a garage grind or can add a permanent rugged touch to a bachelor pad.

 The chunky table and wall clocks rimmed with real tyres or with fake plastic look-alikes pack in a host of little details designed to make a car lover long to wear his affection on his grease-stained sleeve.

 From three inches to a foot in diameter, inside the chunky tyre frame sits a dial in the style of a car speedometer. They come in flamboyant shades of red and black and also the classic steel grey.

In some models, a picture of a car on the dial adds to the look. Tools like spanner and screwdriver form the clock hands. While the smaller table clocks sit on swing stands, the bigger wall clocks help lend a no-nonsense look. 

 In the same mood, also check out the baseball clocks that come fitted with dummy hands and sneaker-clad feet. A door can block out the face of the clock if you are running late!

 The brown, green and white clocks sing a delightful alarm tune followed by a good-morning wish. Though you may not share such cheer, its time to rub those bleary eyes and make a dash to meet that deadline.

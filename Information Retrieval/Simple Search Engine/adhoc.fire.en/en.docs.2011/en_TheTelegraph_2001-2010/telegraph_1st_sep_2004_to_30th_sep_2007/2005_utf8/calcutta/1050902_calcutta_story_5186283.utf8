 Toll up as anti-Aedes drive begins

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Desperate efforts by civic and state health officers notwithstanding, dengue took another life on Wednesday night, raising the toll to 12. 

 A 26-year-old resident of Karimpur, in Nadia, who was admitted on August 29, succumbed to acute haemorrhage and kidney failure at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. 

 This was the day on which the Calcutta Municipal Corporation launched Operation Dengue, a move aimed at spreading awareness and controlling the growth of the Aedes mosquito carrying the disease across the city. 

 While the much-hyped programme was being launched at the civic headquarters, a high-level meeting was being held in Salt Lake to check the outbreak of the disease that left 17 people ill. 

 State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya met health secretary Kalyan Bagchi, along with Salt Lake municipality chairman Biswajiban Majumdar.

 Patients continued to arrive at hospitals, prompting doctors to issue blanket orders for those with dengue-like symptoms to switch on to supportive treatment without even waiting for a confirmation of the blood tests. 

 The highest turnout was at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, where eight patients turned up with dengue-like symptoms, and another eight were found sero-positive.

 ?Since patients are coming both from the city as well as far-flung areas, it is difficult to pinpoint the worst-affected zones in the city,? said hospital superintendent Sukumar Das. 

 Fourteen persons in Howrah are suffering from dengue, the health department said on Thursday. Chief medical officer (health) S. Saha said no one has died of the disease in the district. 

 At RG Kar Medical College, children in the age group of eight to 14 years turned up with dengue-like symptoms. These patients, according to hospital superintendent Pradeep Mitra, were from Beleghata, Sahitya Parishat Street and Baranagar. Details of the cases have been sent to the health top brass at Swasthya Bhavan, prompting director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee to convene an emergency meeting on dengue later in the day. 

 Here, figures from other hospitals, including NRS Medical College and Calcutta Medical College, were discussed in detail. Hospital superintendents were asked to monitor patients at the outdoor wards. 

 At ID Hospital in Beleghata, doctors from the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases collected random samples and noted that some patients had turned up with symptoms that were not typically dengue-like.

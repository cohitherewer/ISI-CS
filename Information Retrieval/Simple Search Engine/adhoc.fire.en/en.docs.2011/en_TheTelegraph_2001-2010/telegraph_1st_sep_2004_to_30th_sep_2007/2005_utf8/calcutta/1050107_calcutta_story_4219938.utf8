 Painting soulful melodies

 The creative arts have a remarkable ability to intermingle and fuse harmoniously, giving birth to an original, innovative form of artistic expression. Hosted by The Art of Living, this evenings concert, which witnesses the marriage of music with the visual arts, also fosters a deeper understanding of the values that unite us all as members of a global community. What is perhaps most fitting about this unique artistic endeavour is that it is being staged to help generate funds in aid of tsunami victims. Featuring Dutch pianist Mireille Heijltjes and Indian painter Tinku Das, the performance promises to offer an outstanding audio-visual experience. Heijltjes will play several pieces, specially selected from her repertoire of concertos, as a mark of respect for those who died as also for those who survived the catastrophe. While she plays, Das? artistic vision interprets her music through the language and rhetoric of the colours of his canvas, investing the performance with a meaning that can best be described as soul stirring.

 Event: Piano recital accompanied by on-stage painting

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

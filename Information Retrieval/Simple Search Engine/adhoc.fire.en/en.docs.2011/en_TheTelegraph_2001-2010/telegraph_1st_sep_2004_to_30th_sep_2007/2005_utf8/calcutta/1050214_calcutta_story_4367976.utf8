 The forms for BA (Part II) external candidates were sold from Calcutta University?s 

sales counter. However, this year, the forms were to be deposited at either Chittaranjan 

College or Gurudas College. First of all, just two colleges were not sufficient 

for catering to so many candidates. Thanks to the rush, students had to wait in 

a queue for five to six hours. Those who could afford it took the help of the 

political students? unions to expedite the process for a fee. Who is responsible 

if a candidate is unable to submit the form?

 On January 31, I was travelling from Calcutta to Chennai on an Air Deccan flight 

(no. DN618). When I checked out at the Chennai airport, I found my camera missing 

from my luggage. I lodged complaints with the airline?s office, both at Calcutta 

and Chennai, and followed up many times but all in vain.

 All eight owners of the apartments in our building were jointly assessed under 

a unique assessee number till March 31, 1987. Then, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation 

started treating us as eight separate assessees and we have been complying with 

the demand notices ever since. Surprisingly, the Corporation still sends us demand 

notices against the old assessee number, despite several reminders and representations. 

How can the same property be taxed by two different divisions of the civic body 

simultaneously? The authorities should clarify this double taxation and inform 

us of the rules.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fantasy tale, feelings true

 Paheli who? Paheli what? Paheli why? Amidst all the incredulity and even outrage over the Indian nomination for the Oscars, lists the reasons why it was her favourite film of the year

 Moments from Paheli

 The folk fusion

 Paheli is a rare Bollywood film that has successfully adapted a folk tale into the commercial format. There?s a love story, the routine song-and-dance and a happy ending, too. The affirmative end ? the only departure from Rajasthani writer Vijaydan Detha?s short story, Duvidha, where the ghost lover is silenced forever ? was a box-office need. And Amol Palekar didn?t disappoint ? either the galleries who wouldn?t have taken too kindly to a parting between Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee, or the discerning ones who found a reason in the reunion.

 The other option before Palekar was to make a morbid arty film with a few parallel film actors, long pensive pauses and a stifling feel. Thankfully he didn?t. But he also didn?t let the trappings of the commercial formula derail the telling of the story ? of the dilemma of a woman in love.

 Paheli is an interesting study in how far the Bollywood parameters can be pushed to accommodate the fantasy world of men and ghosts. 

 Producer Shah Rukh, too, deserves a pat for ensuring that his ?first foray into serious film? remained well within Bollywood bounds.

 The pen and the people

 Sandhya Gokhale?s script is a pillar of strength for the film. Palekar?s wife and he have been true to the essence of the powerful literary piece; they have fleshed out the skeletal story with dialogues, as if almost reading Detha?s mind. Here?s an original Indian work ? Detha had based his story on a Rajasthani folktale ? where a young wife needs to choose between her nonchalant trader husband and a romantic ghost lover.

 And who says it?s not contemporary or universal? Haven?t we ? and the Oscar panel that sat on judgment ? known this woman who chooses love over law, or gives in to passion over custom? When he says his film might be a voice for women?s empowerment, Shah Rukh isn?t too far off the mark.

 Also, a lot of thought has gone into the characters. It would have been easy to make the husband a villain and save all sympathy for the ghost. But Palekar scores when he shows the unromantic merchant pining for his wife and the ghost lover embarrassed by his deceit.

The look and the feel

 Palekar has explored to the hilt the promise of north Indian exotica embedded in the story. The sandy expanse, palatial mansions and colourful costumes. The sensuousness underlying the arid tropical land is played up when Shah Rukh and Rani meet in the dimly-lit rooms, or on the rooftop as MM Kreem?s lilting track bursts forth. The camel race, an addition to display the ghost?s magic powers, adds to the fantasy feel and the riot of colours makes Paheli an absolute visual treat.

 The star parade

 Would Paheli have been the same without the ghagroo-clad Rani Mukherjee and the turbaned (and moustachioed) Shah Rukh? Not quite. They were as necessary to draw audiences to the theatres as they were to drive home the poignant point of the tale. And for once, Shah Rukh lets the script dominate his star persona. So, despite the double roles, there?s as much of Rani and Rajasthan as King Khan. Rani?s muffled cries are heart-rending; her zest for life is infectious. Juhi Chawla was mesmerising in a one-bit role of a suffering wife. And Amitabh Bachchan as the wise man was fleeting but memorable.

 The languid lens

 No sharp cuts or a camera going crazy. Just a languid look at love and longing, a simmering sensuousness that almost caresses you... Ravi K. Chandran lets his viewfinder amble along the corridors of the mansion to peep into Rani?s chamber or to trail the wedding guests on the sands from afar or to create a brooding atmosphere when the ghost disguised as a bird twitters around his lady love.

 The Academy Award for Best Foreign Film may still be a far cry for Paheli ? for it sure does have its flaws ? but it?s at least given those of us who still like our films to be more India than Illinois, more true than take-off, a stage to stand up and be counted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bribe and prejudice

 The man in uniform meant to make your passage through the maze of traffic smooth, wants it. The officer in the income-tax department entrusted with the task of releasing your refunds, asks for it. The government official in charge of a routine mutation of property, demands it. The unassuming hospital staff member standing between your ailing family member and a bed, claims it?

 An outstretched palm demanding to be greased and furtive fingers clutching on to cash.

 From traffic cop to tax official, corporation employee to hospital attendant ? everyone seems to be asking for a bribe, everywhere. After all, India did rank a shameful 90 in Transparency International?s corruption perception index last year.

 With transparency and fair practices emerging as key words in the political, corporate and social lexicon, Metro on Sunday commissioned a survey to comprehend how true the claims of corruption were.

 The exercise, conducted by Mode, was aimed at tracing the incidence of the most common form of corruption in Calcutta ? the demand for and the payment of bribe ? and the citizens? approach to this in-your-face phenomenon.

 In true Calcutta tradition, a voice was raised against ?evil?, as an overwhelming 95 per cent of respondents said bribe ? both pitch and pay ? is bad and must be stopped.

 Ninety per cent of those quizzed ? in a sample size of 207, of whom 57 were from organisations bearing the bribe stigma ? pronounced both donor and recipient guilty.

 And when asked whether they would ever accept a bribe, around 70 per cent said ?no way?.

 But then if that leads you to believe that Calcuttans put their grease money where their mouth is, wait till you get to the rest of the survey.

Protest on paper 

 ?Like everything else, there?s a giver and a taker in this case. If we strictly don?t pay bribes, then people will stop asking for them as well,? says quizmaster Derek O?Brien.

 That is the bigger picture, which A. K. Banerjee of Transparency International?s state chapter also has an eye on. ?Bribe is just a part of the bigger problem. Corruption does not mean bribe alone, as it has various manifestations,? feels Banerjee.

 Harassment at the hands of government officials in various departments, misutilisation of funds released for social development projects, denial by agencies to allow citizens their basic rights ? all add up in the corruption count.

 No-cash corruption is something that celebrities often encounter. Their social standing ? or screen persona ? ensures that they are spared the ?pay or else? talk, but ?the system? does demand its pound of famous flesh.

 ?I often find myself compelled to attend a programme or perform in a show or sing somewhere,? admits Rupa Ganguly. ?Sometimes, important papers get stuck in some government offices and then one has to show up personally. These, I think, are different forms of bribery and I feel very irritated,? adds the actress.

 Also off the beaten path, the Mode survey reveals how the private sector is tarred by the same corruption brush as the public sector. 

 Over 70 per cent of respondents said bribe culture was rampant in both the public and private sectors.

 Singer Usha Uthup tries to explain the phenomenon: ?The pay scales in our country are so poor that people have a difficulty running their families. So??

 But here again, the Calcutta respondent sits tall on his moral high horse ? only 10 per cent of those surveyed stated that poor salaries and high survival costs were the reasons behind a bribe demand; 90 per cent blamed it all on good ol? greed.

Pay in deed

 Now that we?ve heard what Calcuttans have to say about bribery, let?s see what they do about bribery.

 Again, in true Calcutta tradition, the bark ? or in this case the boo ? has far more teeth than the bite.

 According to the findings, 64 per cent of respondents have encountered situations where they were asked to pay a bribe.

 And 83 per cent of them gave in to such a demand.

 From avoiding unnecessary hassles to speeding up the process, justifications to pay up rather than protest abound.

 ?The general perception is that corruption is all-pervasive. So, people might take a strong moral stand on it, but when it comes to implementing it in real life they fail,? says Banerjee of Transparency International.

 This fact is borne out by figures. Only 26 per cent of the respondents remember having raised a voice against any such demand. The majority preferred to keep mum and slip in the cash.

Reasons for greasing a palm range from ?everyone takes 

bribes?, ?informing higher authorities doesn?t help? and ?I don?t have time??

 But there are a few who walk the anti-bribe talk. ?I have been asked several times for bribes. But my policy is, just don?t pay. Even when people come for parking fees I ask for their ID card and if they don?t have one I take them to the police station and lodge an FIR,? says Derek, who admits that being a known face helps at times.

 Some, like Usha Uthup, have got by unscathed. ?I have never been asked to pay a bribe for anything? But I have seen people paying bribes to the traffic police plenty of times.?

 Rogue cops on the roads is clearly the most visible form of bribe-taking in the city. 

 When asked where the demand for bribe was the highest, around 98 per cent of respondents gave pride of place to police on the prowl.

 This was followed by the motor vehicles department (96), Calcutta Municipal Corporation (94), police stations (91) and hospitals (86).

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and public vehicles department director H.R. Mohan claim efforts to clean up Lalbazar, the civic headquarters and Beltala are on.

 Haven?t we heard that before?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 There are no formal announcements over the public address system at the Bidhannagar Road railway station, in Sealdah?s main section, about the trains passing through the stop. Over the years, the number of suburban and express trains halting at the station has increased manifold. It is high time that the railway provide this facility to the passengers. The announcements will help passengers ascertain which train is coming on which platform. They will also deter people from crossing the tracks on foot minutes before a train enters or leaves the station. 

 Subhasish Majumdar,

 Sonarpur. 

 I have a BSNL CellOne connection. For the two days that I recently spent at a cousin?s in Kalikapur, my phone had almost no network coverage. The service provider must improve service to customers on the city?s fringes. 

 Tuhin Purkayastha, Parnashree Pally. 

 In College Street market, some shop-owners have put up polythene sheets to save their wares from rain. After every shower, rainwater accumulated on these sheets provides an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes. Water also collects under a tap in a passage in the market as rubber goods block its flow into the drain. Needless to say, the civic staff have neglected their duty of maintaining hygiene in the Corporation market despite the recent dengue outbreak.

 Name and address not given.

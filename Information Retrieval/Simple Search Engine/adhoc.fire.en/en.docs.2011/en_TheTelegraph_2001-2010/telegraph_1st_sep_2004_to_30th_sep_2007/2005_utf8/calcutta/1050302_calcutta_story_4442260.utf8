 Wagon door kills porter

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A swinging door of a stationary wagon led to the freak death of a porter on Tuesday.

 Ram Chandra Mahato, 38, was unloading goods from the wagon in a Food Corporation of India godown off Jhinjhira bridge, in Taratala, when the door slammed into him.

 ?Mahato had a load on his head and was in a hurry to put it down. He missed seeing the door swinging in,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (port). ?The iron door slammed into his head.?

 Alarmed at the injury, his colleagues suspended unloading. A doctor was called in, on whose advice Mahato was shifted to hospital. But he did not respond to treatment and succumbed to his injury.

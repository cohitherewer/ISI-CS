 Hidden eyes on the bridge

 - STRING OF MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD 62-YEAR-OLD CALCUTTA ICON

 Howrah bridge: Surveillance scurry. A Telegraph picture

 Be careful the next time you step on to Howrah bridge ? several pairs of hidden eyes will be watching you.

 Months after a barge rammed into the bridge?s underbelly, a string of measures are being taken to safeguard of the 62-year-old structure, including installation of closed-circuit television cameras.

 ?The cameras will be installed on both the over and under decks of the bridge. Bidding will open soon,? said A.K. Mehra, chief engineer of Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), custodian of the bridge. ?The cameras will help us track down vehicles, both on water and road.?

 Officials said around Rs 20 lakh would be spent on setting up the surveillance system. 

 Every year, at least five incidents of vehicles hitting the structure are reported to the authorities. Four incidents have already been reported this year, apart from the biggest one in the bridge?s history on June 24 ? the mast of a barge getting stuck in the trolley tracks of the structure.

 ?Thanks to mishaps caused by rash driving, the railings on both sides get damaged frequently,? said an official. Recently, a CSTC bus rammed into a column, damaging the aluminium sheet covering the base.

 Once the cameras are installed, errant drivers will not be able to escape unnoticed, asserted an official. ?They will be penalised.? Similarly, vessels passing under the bridge, too, will be monitored.

 The CPT authorities will also make prominent markings on the bridge, indicating the channel vessels must coast through. ?The part of the river where the depth of water is maximum will be reserved for vessels,? Mehra pointed out. 

 In the June 24 mishap, two of the six longitudinal girders, each 700 m long, were damaged. A few of the 40 cross-girders were also broken and a newly-built trolley guide was damaged.

 Rites, a CPT consultant since the 80s, surveyed the bridge after the accident. A team conducted ultrasonography and magnetic particle tests to find out whether the ?integrity? of the girders was intact. The Rites team will submit a ?detailed restoration scheme? to CPT next week.

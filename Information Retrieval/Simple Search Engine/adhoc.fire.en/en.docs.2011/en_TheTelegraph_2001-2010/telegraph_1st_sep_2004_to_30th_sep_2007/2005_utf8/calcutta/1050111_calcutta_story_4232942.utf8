The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Upgrade for road links to export zones

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Better connectivity is the key to better business. 

 Spurred by the maxim, the state government has set upon improving road links to the special economic zones (SEZs) in and around Calcutta.

 A proposal for boosting SEZ connectivity has been prepared and sent to the Centre by the state commerce and industry department. 

 ?We have asked the Centre for funds for the betterment of road links to the SEZs,? commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen told Metro on Monday.

 A key reason why the Bengal government hasn?t been able to impress foreign investors, as well as those from other states, is the bad roads, said a senior official at Writers? Buildings.

 ?The government, unfortunately, did not realise that poor connectivity hampered trade. But the mindset has changed and we are now focussing on better connectivity,? he explained. 

 The commerce and industry department?s proposal has asked the Centre for around Rs 200 crore. It covers the existing SEZs, as well as the ones proposed.

 The issue, along with a number of other proposals, may come up at the forthcoming meeting between Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Calcutta. 

 The plan for road links is being drawn up keeping in mind the need for the SEZs? connectivity with the port and the airport. ?The idea is to allow uninterrupted movement of export-related cargo,? the official said.

 ?Diamond Harbour Road, for example, is the main link to Kulpi. But the road passes through several congested pockets, like Amtala and Joka. The SEZs? link to the port and the airport should bypass the congestion of the city and its suburbs,? he added. 

 Among the roads to be improved under the project is the one that runs from Calcutta to Basanti. The road is crucial, as it links the city to the Calcutta Leather Complex, in Bantala. 

 Though the roads in Salt Lake are in better shape, ?a lot needs to be done for their upkeep and upgrade?.

 The commitments the government has to make to those setting up units in the SEZs include:

Adequate supply of electricity and water in the zones

Complete exemption of electricity duty 

Single-point clearance for those conducting business from the zones. 

 The SEZs are also entitled to a host of other incentives. Those already operating are Manikanchan (gem and jewellery park in Salt Lake) and the ones in Falta, Kulpi and Bantala. 

 IT giant Wipro, too, is setting up an SEZ in Salt Lake.

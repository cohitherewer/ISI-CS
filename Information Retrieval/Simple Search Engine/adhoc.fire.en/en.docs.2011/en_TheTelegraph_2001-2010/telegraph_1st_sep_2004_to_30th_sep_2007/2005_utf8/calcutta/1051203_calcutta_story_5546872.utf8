 Lights out, flights in disarray

 Six flights could not land at the city airport on Sunday night and had to be diverted to other locations. Fog, or smog, was just one reason. The other: several of the approach lights on the primary runway, part of the multi-crore Category II facility of Instrumental Landing System, are not functioning.

 Officials said approach lights on a 420-metre stretch on flank 01 Right of the primary runway are not working.

 ?The lights on flank 19 Left are in perfect condition, but those on the 420-metre stretch of the other flank are not,? a senior official of the Airports Authority of India said on Tuesday.

 The authorities have issued a ?notice to the airman?, stating that the lights are not operative. ?They will be repaired in December,? airport director V.K. Monga told Metro on Thursday.

 Sources said the lights have not been functioning since August. ?The cables were damaged during some work on the runway and are yet to be repaired. Some of the bulbs, too, are missing,? said an official. ?The lights were supposed to be repaired by November, but work had to be deferred.?

 On a normal day, flights can land without the help of runway approach lights, but not so in fog.

 Last Sunday night, at least some of the flights could have landed had the lights been on. The fog was not uniform on the entire runway. 

 The Runway Visual Range (RVR) on 19 Left was 350 metres, against the minimum 550 metres required for landing. On 01 Right, the lowest RVR was 900 metres. 

 The fog was thinner on this flank, yet flights could not land, as the lights were off. The flights hovered over the airport for several minutes, before being diverted to other locations.

 It had taken the authorities a little more than a year to instal the Category (CAT) II lights on the primary runway spending crores. However, a vital component of the system is missing. 

 At present, only two Vaisala Transmission Meters (VTMs) are in operation at the two ends of the primary runway. The two poles ? one sending signals and the other reflecting it ? give digital readings of visibility. The CAT II system calls for installation of another VTM, midway through the runway. 

 Although a site has been identified for the installation, the gadget is yet to be procured. Sources said it would be imported from Finland. 

 Once the entire CAT II is in place, flights can land even if visibility is down to 350 metres. Till then, disruption will continue every winter, said an official of the Met department posted at the airport.

Drives and driversQ amp;A

Thanks for writing in with your computer worries. Keep 

the emails coming! 

TECH TALK

Arindam Das: My PC has 2.8 GHz Pentium IV processor, 

Intel D865GBF motherboard, 40 GB HDD and 256 MB DDR RAM. While partitioning the 

hard disk, the Disk Manager shows two hard disk drives with the model number of 

the installed drive and another non-existent 8.41 GB drive.

After partitioning and formatting the original drive 

in FAT32, a non-DOS partition is being created. I?m unable to instal Windows 98 

even after partitioning and formatting using FDISK. 

TechTalk: Your HDD is not properly installed 

and is configured with wrong partition information. You didn?t mention the version 

of Disk Manager or the HDD brand and whether it is parallel or serial ATA. Download 

the latest version of installation software like Disk Wizard for Seagate or Disk 

Manager special edition for Samsung from the HDD manufacturer?s website.

After preparing the disk installation floppy(s), check 

the jumper and cable. In case of older parallel ATA drive, use the 80-wire data 

cable singularly for the HDD and check whether the jumper is set as master drive. 

Don?t attach other IDE drives like CD/DVD ROM to the same cable.

Switch on your PC and enter BIOS by pressing ?Del?. 

Go to Advanced Menu Drive Configuration. Check whether the HDD is configured with 

accurate model no. (PATA Primary Master or secondary Master) and no other drive 

is configured as slave. Select your Hard Drive and check or adjust to set the 

Drive type in ?Auto? mode. Set Floppy Drive as the First Boot Device. Press F10 

to save and exit BIOS.

Reboot PC with the first floppy of the Disk Installation 

software and follow the on-screen instruction. Select New Drive Installation even 

if the disk installation software displays a Hard Disk already installed and configured. 

This is important to rectify the earlier partitioning and formatting errors.

You should consult the user?s guide (also available 

on the hard disk manufacturer?s website) before using the installation software.

Soham Dev Maiti: Where can I get the driver 

for Conexant HSF V92 56K PCI Modem for Red Hat Linux 7.3 and how do I configure 

it?

TechTalk: Conexant HSF V92 56K PCI Modem can 

be made to work under most current Linux distributions, with 2.4 or 2.6 kernels. 

Drivers are available at http://www.linuxant.com. Instal the rpm by issuing 

the ?rpm -i hsfmodem-{version}.{arch}.rpm? command. Detailed instructions on how 

to configure are available on the website. 

Pijush Banerjee: I have problems saving to 

a floppy disk. Sometimes, when I try to open documents saved on a floppy, ?illegal 

function? message appears.

I am also unable to erase my document from the PC 

since it is in ?read only view?.

My PC screen often turns pink and starts blinking.

TechTalk: Ensure that the floppy disc is not 

write-protected by adjusting the notch on the lower left corner of the floppy.

To delete content, try the DOS mode. Type ?a:? and 

then ?DEL *.*? or format the floppy by typing ?Format a:?. Remember, floppy disks 

are prone to damage and faulty disks often generate read/write errors.

To change the ?read only? attribute, right click on 

the file and go to Properties. Uncheck the ?read only? box.

Your monitor is faulty and needs to be serviced.

Rikdeb Mukherjee: I have Pentium IV processor 

with 256 MB RAM, Windows 98 and XP. My CDROM drive is unable to read CDs.

Also, soon after booting, my PC boots shows ?Low Virtual 

Memory?. I tried to increase the virtual memory manually, but it didn?t help.

TechTalk: There seems to be trouble with the 

drivers for IDE hard disks or CDROM drive. In Device Manager, remove the IDE ATA/ATAPI 

controllers and reboot for Plug and Play to start over and configure them again.

The page file might also have become corrupt. In the 

Virtual Memory settings, set ?No page file?, exit System Properties, shut down 

the computer and reboot. Delete the file PAGEFILE.SYS (on each drive), set up 

page file again and reboot.

If the problem persists and if your computer has an 

Intel chipset, uninstal Intel?s Application Accelerator and get an updated version.

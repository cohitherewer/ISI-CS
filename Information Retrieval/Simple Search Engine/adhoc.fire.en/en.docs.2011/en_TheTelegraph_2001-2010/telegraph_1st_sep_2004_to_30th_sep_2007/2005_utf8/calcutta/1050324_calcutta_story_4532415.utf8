The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bittersweet tale of brother and brotherhood

Cause combines with craft as a former Jadavpur University 

student focuses on a family torn asunder by the spectre of AIDS. Will the audience 

take to another small but significant film like Nikhil takes to the choppy waters, 

wonders Sudeshna Banerjee

Brother Nikhil, with Juhi Chawla in the same film, and film-maker Onir directing

I care for my brother Nikhil. The message, loud and 

clear, comes from star actors, directors and icons of the sports fraternity. Abhishek 

Bachchan and Saif Ali Khan, Karan Johar and Mandira Bedi, Rahul Dravid and Sania 

Mirza, Indian Idol Abhijeet Sawant and Mahesh Bhupathi ? they are all appearing 

on television voicing their concern for Nikhil Kapoor. 

Who is Nikhil Kapoor? An ace swimmer from Goa, he 

is afflicted with AIDS and his fate will be decided this Friday. Not in an operation 

theatre but in the theatres. 

My Brother Nikhil, city boy Onirban?s directorial 

debut, tells the story of Nikhil, played by Sanjay Suri. ?The film is set in a 

period when there was so much misconception in India about AIDS that it was possible 

to segregate a person forcefully if he was found to be HIV-positive. In course 

of my research I read about a swimmer who was arrested in 1989 for being an AIDS 

patient and even after being released, he had to take permission to leave the 

house. The movement to change the law started in Goa, which is where the film 

is set,? says Onir, the name he is now known by.

The former student of comparative literature in Jadavpur 

University, though, insists that My Brother Nikhil is not an AIDS film. 

?The story revolves around how relationships get redefined when such a disease 

strikes.? Nikhil starts out as a jovial, happy-go-lucky swimmer ? a state champion 

in fact ? loved and liked by all. His family comprises his father Navin (Victor 

Banerjee) who brings him up as a sportsperson, his mother Lilette Dubey and sister 

Juhi Chawla. But when he is detected with AIDS and visited by the cops, the family 

disintegrates and only his sister and a friend stand by him. The story is narrated 

by the sister.

?Karan Johar had come for a screening of the rough 

cut. He said he had cried for half-an-hour, he was so moved,? Onir said, adding 

that the star director-producer had commented that he had every right to be proud 

of such a debut. ?That really gave me confidence,? the 35-year-old smiles.

It was Karan who spoke to Aditya Chopra about the 

film. ?Adi too was impressed.? Yashraj Pictures then picked up the film for marketing 

and distribution. ?Aditya felt that it is important we start supporting good, 

meaningful cinema,? explains Tarun Tripathi, head of marketing, Yashraj Films. 

Support for My Brother Nikhil has come from 

diverse quarters. ?Even before Yashraj came into the picture we were looking for 

champions for the cause. I spoke to Abhishek and Saif. Mandira (her husband Raj 

Kaushal is one of the producers) was only too happy to help,? recalls Sanjay Suri. 

Among the sports stars, Bhupathi saw the film first. 

Not only did he agree to help with the publicity, he roped in Sania Mirza as well. 

?The shooting with Bhupathi was done in Hyderabad while we had to travel to Bangalore 

to get Sania.?

If Mandira is among the cheerleaders, can cricket 

be far away? ?A contact with Rahul Dravid was made through the Bill Gates Foundation, 

which is working big time with AIDS. The India-Pakistan series was about to begin 

and a tight security net had been thrown over the Indian team?s hotel in Chandigarh. 

Our crew was stopped at the hotel gate. I SMSed Rahul for help, and he himself 

made sure that they could get in and the shooting could happen smoothly,? Onir 

says, full of gratitude for Indian cricket?s Mr Dependable. 

The publicity has been on in full swing. With just 

a couple of days to go for D-Day, Suri, both lead actor and producer for the film, 

feels he has been ?fighting so long in the frontline and is about to gain the 

summit?. ?People ask me if I am feeling nervous. The truth is my hands are so 

full and the mind so keyed up to ensure the perfect release that I do not have 

the time to think beyond the immediate moment,? he says, stifling a tired yawn.

If this is the fatigued producer speaking, the character 

too demanded a lot from the actor, especially losing hair and weight (some 6-7 

kg) and gaining both back for the pre and post-AIDS look. ?We did not shoot at 

a linear stretch.?

Suri is thankful to his cast for being ?so supportive?. 

Speaking of the other Bengali connection in the film, Victor Banerjee, he points 

out that he was perfect for the role ?being such a good actor and not completely 

overexposed?. ?You have seen just a bit of him in Bhoot.?

Victor himself is eagerly awaiting the release. ?My 

Brother Nikhil is the muted expression of a very sensitive director, and I 

would love to see it succeed in the hearts and minds of those who go to see it.? 

The success of Black and Page 3 has 

been reassuring. ?It seems people are ready for new-age Indian cinema,? is what 

both Onir and Suri say. 

New age My Brother Nikhil is, with just one 

song. As the swimmer takes to the high seas, whether the fickle movie-going public 

takes the plunge into meaningful cinema again, is what we have to watch out for.

A cut and colour job to counteract the dull, lifeless 

look brought on by the monsoon is just what the hairdresser ordered. At least 

that is Tressbays prognosis for this pressing image issue set to last the 

next couple of months.

 The Alipore salon celebrated its first anniversary by showcasing trendy hair styles and cuts from LOreal Professionnel range, Majirel.

 Models Konkona, Sheena, and Saurav sashayed styles, cuts and colours suitable for the season.

 One suggested look is layers for the crown, with natural locks blending to create extra volume. Cool khaki-coloured diagonal sections, which sweep across the forehead, while the rest of the hair is tinted light blonde and iridescent mahogany. Mousse and wet-look gel is needed for styling.

 For straight hair, short flicks on one side of the forehead and styling with straighteners is a perfect party hairdo. The horizontal cut with layers in front looks healthy and chic. Dark blonde and iridescent mahogany peppered with magenta red slices underneath add to the silkiness.

 Cool Iceberg on the crown teamed with mahogany copper is suggested as the suave and cool option for humid climates, which would go well with either a spiked or natural do.

 Bath basics

 If you want to turn your staid bathroom into a haven of luxury, soak in the spa splendour at Cera Bath Studio.

 The City Centre store launched by Cera Sanitary Ltd on Saturday, stocks everything you might need to dress up the most personal room of your house.

 A wide range of exclusive wash closets, basins, shower panels, shower cubicles, bathtubs, shower temples and whirlpools can be found here.

 The store shall provide consumers, architects and interior designers an insight into the latest styles in the country. The live bathrooms are for the customers to gauge the look and function in their own homes, explains Atul Sanghvi of Cera Sanitaryware.

 A shower temple includes shower tray, hot and cold mixer with divertor, shower jet, rain shower and head shower, massager, steam-generator and radio.

 There are also shower cubicles made of acrylic and glass, sensor faucets, one-piece wash closets and wall-hung commodes. Accessories like soap trays, paper holders, basins, sinks and bidets available here complete the loo look.

 The Cera products come in a wide range of colours, like blue, soft pink, cherry, soft green, almond brown and white.

 Bday bash

 Red Kitchen and Lounge celebrated its first birthday on Sunday afternoon, but the fun continues at the Alipore address every Sunday starting next week, with an unlimited Bubble Brunch.

 Chinese and Mongolian specialities aside, the spread includes Continental items along with a variety of wines and a cheese platter, explains Ashim Mewar, co-owner of the restaurant and lounge. The price for the buffet is still undecided.

 We have received a tremendous response from the people of Calcutta. The success of Red Kitchen and Lounge reiterates the love the people of Calcutta have for good food and partying out, he adds.

 Pool party

 With the rains come the rain dances. While some turn out to be damp squibs, others are as wet wild as can be.

 Like the one at Calcutta Swimming Club on Saturday night. By the time it was 9 pm, the makeshift dance floor over the swimming pool was jam-packed. 

 DJ Akash belted out some memorable oldies as well as some energy-pumping remixes to keep everybody on the floor. The rain song repertoire included Aaj rapat jaaye and Rang barse.

 Red carpet raves 

Smita Roy Chowdhury zeroes in on 

some of the hottest trends in jewellery and accessories that are turning heads 

and flooring flashbulbs at the ongoing 58th Cannes Film Festival

 The bigger the better is clearly the mantra when 

it comes to neckpieces flaunted by the beauty brigade at Cannes. While at last 

years festival one got to see an overdose of danglers adorning the ears, 

this time, the fashionistas seem to be giving big earrings the miss in favour 

of chunky neckwear.

Last year at Cannes, the women were seen sporting 

huge shoulder ticklers. In fact, the whole of last year saw a spate of danglers 

everywhere. And suddenly the celeb brigade has gone off danglers and is busy flaunting 

almost-bare ears with very minimal earrings. The focus this year is totally on 

neck pieces, says jewellery designer Raj Mahtani.

Ropes of metallic chains and beads of various kinds 

? be it the tribal wooden, bone and plastic or the more classy tourmaline, Russian 

emerald, citrine and amethyst ? are wrapped round and round the neck, contrasted 

with single-hued gowns or tops. The look is vintage and bohemian, and classy as 

well.

Long necklaces are stealing the show internationally, 

but the style is totally avant-garde. The look is chunky and bold, yet very chic. 

The pieces are huge but non-structured, portraying the bohemian feel. Semi-precious 

stones in fresh summer colours as well as diamonds are hot. But even in diamonds, 

the sleek look is totally out, adds Mahtani.

Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh agrees: Big neckpieces, 

whether of precious stones, uncut diamonds or regular beads, add colour and a 

focal point of interest and individuality to a persons look.

 Be it the tiny tote adorning the palm or the sexy sandal adding style to the 

step, the bejewelled look is a favourite with actresses at the film festival. 

While the ornamental effect is in vogue in clothes, too, with jewel-studded cuffs 

and necklines aplenty, the look dominates the accessory section almost completely.

 The clutch bag is the clear winner, as slings are seen few and far between. 

The look is ornamental with stones, beads and sequins embellishing the leather, 

satin, silk and metal surfaces. 

 Clutch bags are the classic style at all such evening dos and never go 

out of fashion. You would spot actresses carrying them at all international awards 

functions or film festivals. It goes very well with evening gowns. Somehow, clutch 

bags havent caught on in India so much, but I personally feel they would 

go very well with saris, too, says accessory designer Megha Modi.

 As for the bejewelled look, Modi adds: In accessories, the ornamental 

look is very in right now. Sequins, stones and beads add glamour to the pieces.

 The rich and opulent feel extends to the footwear as well, where stilettos 

seem to be stealing the show. 

 Two-toned, three-toned or multi-toned shoes add some colour to the feet, but 

steely silver, gold, platinum, black and white are most commonly sighted.

 High heels, pointed or round toes, stones, metal and shell embellishments 

are the key words in feet fashion right now. While stilettos are definitely the 

first choice when paired with gowns and formal skirts, the ballerina shoes are 

also doing quite well, says Modi.

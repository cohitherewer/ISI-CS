 Brother sets house on fire

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After a fight over a tap in their house, a man tried to kill his brother, but ended up taking the lives of their 55-year-old mother and one-and-a-half-year-old niece, in Belghoria, early on Monday.

 Police said Gopal Das, 34, locked the house from outside around 12.30 am, sprinkled kerosene on the walls and set the building on fire. Mother Kamala, brother Anil Das, 29, his wife Laxmi and their son and daughter Riya were sleeping inside. 

 Anil was the first to wake up, only to find the house engulfed by fire. He woke up the others and started screaming for help. With his wife and children in tow, Anil tried to break open the main door.

 Alerted by the cries, the neighbours had assembled near the house. They managed to break down the front door and help the residents out. By that time, all of them had suffered severe burns. 

 While a section of the local residents tried to douse the flames with water, the others rushed the injured to NRS Medical College.

 Around three hours later, Anil?s mother Kamala succumbed to her burns. Riya died soon after. Late on Monday evening, the doctors said Anil, Laxmi and their son were critical. 

 The police are searching for Gopal, who is absconding.

 ?This is a ghastly murder and we will take suitable action against the culprit. He will be arrested soon,? asserted Parveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Tiffs between the brothers and their wives were common. Neighbours often had to intervene in their disputes. ?Gopal was unemployed and would pick a quarrel at the drop of a hat. His wife had left him a few months ago,? said Prasun Bannerjee, sub-divisional police officer of Belghoria.

 On Sunday, the two had fought over the positioning of a water tap. While Anil wanted the tap installed in the common passageway near his room, Gopal insisted that it should be set up closer to his room. Mother Kamala separated the brothers after a few blows were exchanged.

 According to police, a fuming Gopal went to the market and got a few bottles of kerosene. After the family went to bed at night, he slipped out of the house, locked the main gate and emptied the kerosene containers on the walls.

 ?He was determined to have his revenge,? remarked superintendent of police Kumar.

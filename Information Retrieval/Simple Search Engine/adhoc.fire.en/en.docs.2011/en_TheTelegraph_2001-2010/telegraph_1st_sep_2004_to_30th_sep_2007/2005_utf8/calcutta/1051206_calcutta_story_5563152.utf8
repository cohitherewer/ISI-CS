 It has been more than two days since 11-year-old Rahul Khan and management student Nilanjan Sarkar disappeared, but police are yet to make a headway in either case. Their ?extensive search? has failed to provide even leads.

 Rahul was last seen around 9.30 am on Friday in front of his residence in Tangra. Police are still clueless about the disappearance.

 ?We do not think this is a case of kidnapping, since the Khan family has not received a ransom call. At the same time, there is not enough reason to suspect that Rahul left home on his own. The entire episode is a mystery,? said an officer of Tangra police station.

 The residents of Mathurbabu Lane, where the boy lived with his parents, are anxiously awaiting his return. Hasan Iqbal?s recent murder has put everyone on the edge.

 The mutilated body of the 13-year-old boy, from the same locality, was discovered three days after his disappearance from a septic tank, a few metres from his residence. 

 Vineet Goyel, deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division, stated: ?Our efforts are on to trace the boy. Let?s hope for the best.?

 Nilanjan Sarkar?s disappearance is also mired in mystery, even with the boys relatives and friends helping out the cops. 

 ?We have sought from the cellular operator the details of the calls he made from his mobile phone. May be we can find some clues from his call records,? said Anirbun Dutta, Nilanjan?s friend. The two shared a rented room in Salt Lake?s AD block. 

 Nilanjan?s parents have applied to the cellular operator for records of the calls made and received on his mobile phone. Before disappearing on Saturday afternoon, Nilanjan had told Anirbun that he had lost his mobile phone. 

 After coming across a letter from his roommate stating he was going away forever, Anirbun searched for the cell phone charger, but failed to find it. ?It seems he has taken the mobile phone with him. We are therefore trying to track the calls he had made in the past few days,? added Anirbun.

 Nilanjan, who studies in a management institute in Salt Lake, returned from class on Saturday afternoon and told Anirbun that he was going out to make a call to his sister. He never returned. 

 Nilanjan?s father Kalyan Sarkar, a retired bank employee, has returned to his Durgapur residence after a futile search for his son in hotels near the Howrah station. 

 ?My father is completely devastated,? said Meenakshi, Nilanjan?s sister.

 ?If the police cannot do anything then we will approach the Criminal Investigation Department,? she added.

 Police maintain it would be difficult to trace Nilanjan since he has disappeared on his own.

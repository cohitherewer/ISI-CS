 Musical showers

 Be it the slow and ponderous movements or the oscillating komal gandhar of Malhar, the majestic strains of miyan ki malhar or the rapturous tunes of megh malhar, musical notes based on the glorious classical tradition of Malhars can instantly evoke an atmosphere of gathering dark clouds and impending rain. Meant to be listened to late at night during the rest of the year, Malhars can be sung and heard at any time of the day during the rainy season. In celebration of the melodious season of Malhars, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture presents An Evening of Malhars, a concert that promises to offer true connoisseurs of Indian classical music an unforgettable experience. Featuring renowned, erudite musicians Maskoor Ali Khan (vocal) and Buddhadev Dasgupta (sarod), who possess a rich collection of compositions in almost all the variants of Malhars. They will be accompanied by Samar Saha (tabla) and Gourab Chatterjee (harmonium).

 Event: An Evening of Malhars, a programme on Indian classical music

 When: Today at 6 pm

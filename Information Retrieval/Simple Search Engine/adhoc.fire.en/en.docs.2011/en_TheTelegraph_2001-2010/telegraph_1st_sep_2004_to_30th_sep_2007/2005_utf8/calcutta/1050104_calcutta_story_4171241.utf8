 The year 2004 belonged to the Bengali designer, it seems.

 After Sabyasachi showed in Milan, Delhi-based Nandita Basu?s couture walked the Paris ramp in November.

 Now, the 32-year-old designer has found a platform in Calcutta. CIMA Design unveiled a ready-to-wear collection created exclusively for the Forum lifestyle store.

 The collection includes very wearable trousers, kurtas, kurtis and jackets, with more styles on the way. Nandita uses mainly natural fabrics embellished with a light hand and attention to finishing.

 Indian craftsmanship has been given a contemporary twist, seen in fine beadwork accents on georgette kurtis and delicate applique on cotton kurtas. Patchwork brocade pants and silk trousers in shades of blue, violet, maroon and black are sure to appeal to the young eye. An Oriental touch comes by way of waist-length jacquard jackets. Prices range from around Rs 1,500 to Rs 10,500.?The collection concentrates on minimal designs and basic silhouettes,? explained the designer over phone from Delhi. In India, she has a mix of some Indian and some western wear, though the line she showcased in Paris was ?mostly western wear with an Indian feel?.

 Her style is largely contemporary. ?The work is not typically Indian. It could be from anywhere, really,? she added.

 The graduate of NIFT, Delhi and Central St Martin?s School of Art, London, has an eponymous boutique in Delhi, and also retails in Hong Kong, New York, London and Kuwait. In Calcutta, she will sell exclusively at CIMA.

 The Paris ramp put the spotlight on ?ethical fashion?, where Nandita was the only Indian designer on show. ?Fair trade practices and creating markets for traditional crafts by using them in contemporary ways was its focus.? A tie-up in Paris, hopes the stylist, could be the start of a presence on European racks.

Also joining the CIMA ranks is Abhishek Dutta with 

a line of men?s wear.

 Leave car park, build up

 - Vertical expansion okayed if buildings free ground space

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to free up more space on the ground, the city civic authorities have decided to relax rules of vertical extension of buildings.

 Any residential or commercial building with at least a 50-ft-wide road in front can now be built to a height of 50 ft without any legal hassle.

 Following changes in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Building Rules (Amendment), 1999, builders are allowed relaxation in height if they leave more open space on the ground floor on plots with at least 50-ft roads (including pavements) in front. This was not allowed earlier.

 ?I hope the new residential and commercial buildings leave more parking space for cars. Hopefully, visitors will no longer be forced to park their cars outside. That will help us solve many problems,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 According to the mayor, parking of cars is proving to be major headache for motorists in Calcutta. The problem has become so serious that building a few parkomats and creation of parking zones will not help solve it, he said. 

 Every day, between 10 am and 7 pm, more than 150,000 cars are out on the city roads. About 50,000 of them need to be parked at a given point of time. The total parking capacity in the city at any point of time is only 24,000. 

 After the amendment of building rules, commercial and residential complexes can earn money by letting out parking space.

 The new building rules have, however, imposed restrictions on height for buildings adjoining roads narrower than 50 ft. Only three-storeyed structures will be allowed to come up along such roads.

 Civic deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh said that earlier, G+3 (four-storeyed) buildings were allowed to be constructed along roads wider than 12 ft.Under the amended building rules, only a three-storeyed structure can be sanctioned on such plots. 

 The amended rules have made it mandatory for buildings to have at least six ft of open space in front. The earlier minimum limit was four ft.

 Engineers in the CMC building department feel that the restriction on the heights of buildings on narrow roads will adversely affect the interests of plot-owners in Behala and Jadavpur.

 Most of the roads in the areas are not more than 12 ft wide, they pointed out.

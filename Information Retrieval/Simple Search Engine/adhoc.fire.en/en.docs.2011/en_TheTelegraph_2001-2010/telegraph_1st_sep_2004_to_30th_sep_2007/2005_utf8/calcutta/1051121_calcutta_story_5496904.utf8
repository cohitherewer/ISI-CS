 Moral predicament

 Relationships form the core of our existence. Yet they are prone to the greatest vulnerability and can traumatise our entire life if not nurtured with the greatest care. Saanjhbela deals with the fragility and complexity of human relationships and the problems that arise when the different relationships we share with different sets of people clash with one another. It offers a realistic portrait of two lives wasted away, and another two on the verge of being destroyed, due to improper handling of relationships. The play unfolds the story of Shrimoyee (Swatilekha Sengupta), a middle-aged single mother of two teenagers. Hers is a life of loneliness as she lives all by herself in a remote town, where her son and daughter come to visit her during their holidays. However, her apparently placid, uneventful life is thrown into deep turmoil by the sudden arrival of Alokesh (Meghnad Bhattacharya), a man with whom she had a secret, amorous liaison in the days of her youth. Trying to reconnect a tie that had once been severed, she faces serious emotional and moral dilemma. Her personal crisis even affects her relationship with her children and they all suffer from extreme mental agony, distress and fear. Story: Bimal Kar. Stage adaptation: Indrasis Lahiri. Direction: Meghnad Bhattacharya.

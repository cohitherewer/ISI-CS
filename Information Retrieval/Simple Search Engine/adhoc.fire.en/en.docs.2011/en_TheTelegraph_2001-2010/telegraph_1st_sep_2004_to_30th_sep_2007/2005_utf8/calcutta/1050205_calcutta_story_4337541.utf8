 Zoo rapped for plastic ban flout

 JAYANTA BASU

 After an inspection revealed that the two-year-old plastic ban was not being adhered to in the Alipore Zoological Gardens, the West Bengal Pollution Control board (WBPCB) recently slapped an order on the authorities to take corrective measures immediately.

 The move came after NGO PUBLIC lodged a complaint with the board, alleging that the authorities had not been enforcing the ban and disposing of garbage. 

 The board carried out an inspection, and subsequently, passed an order in January-end, after senior board officials held a meeting with the zoo director and representatives of the NGO.

 ?Proper vigil should be maintained at the zoo gate so that no visitor can enter with plastic carry-bags,? says the WBPCB order, issued by senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee. The order directed the zoo to take the following steps:

Clear all burnt garbage and ban further burning of any waste material within the 

premises 

Segregate plastic garbage and send it for recycling

Display banners for sensitising visitors about the ban on plastic bags.

 ?We have already taken steps to comply with the PCB directives?, confirmed zoo director Subir Choudhury. 

 He clarified that while ?burnt garbage has already been cleared?, at least eight guards have been specially deployed to look out for visitors carrying plastic bags.

 The zoo has asked the stall-owners in its compound not to use or distribute plastic carry-bags and containers, and has also initiated talks with Indian Plastic Federation on recycling of the waste.

 ?We are trying our best, but you have to keep in mind that of our two million visitors every year, 50 per cent come in December and January,? said a senior zoo official.

 ?It?s a fact that they have started to act? they have already put up a big banner at zoo?s entry point? agreed a PCB expert.

 In May 2003, the WBPCB banned plastic carry-bags in 10 tourist spots in the city and suburbs, including Victoria Memorial Hall, the zoo, Botanical Gardens and Rabindra Sarobar. 

 Subsequently, the ban was extended to 13 other spots, including Science City, Nicco Park, Indian Museum and Swabhumi.

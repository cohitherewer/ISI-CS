The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Live today, pay tomorrow

 A personal loan ad is comforting for those uncomfortable about borrowing. But how many are, in these EMI times?

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 There is this new Yeh dosti hum nahin todenge ad from HSBC. Of the two friends, one is casual and confident. The other is tense and troubled. The ad opens with the second friend trying to say something to the first, who is browsing a book in a store. A lady passes them in audible proximity. He stops in mid-sentence, not wanting her to hear what he was about to say to his friend. He seems embarrassed.

 The first friend helps him ? do you need some money? The second friend looks visibly relieved and promptly starts to explain ? you see my little sister? Again, the other friend interrupts ? yes, yes, the little one is now a grown-up. Her marriage has been fixed so you need the money; that is what you want to say. Right? The friend looks grateful and is about to continue further. For the third time, the Good Samaritan completes the sentence ? ok, ok, no problem, pay me back when you can. Now come, let us enjoy a cup of tea together. The ad then moves on to talk about My Personal Loan from HSBC and says that it is like borrowing from a friend.

 Marketing of a loan may appear to be a baffling concept to many. Before the era of home loans and mutual funds, generations have grown up thinking of the bank as a place where you deposit money because it is safer than keeping it at home. The fact that they are getting paid for keeping the money had never troubled their reasoning. The interest paid was an entry in the passbook that often got overlooked. On the other hand, borrowing was always a bad word.

 There is this friend of mine, a little crazy for today?s time I might add, who did not move into his new home till he had paid back his loan. His sentiment was simple ? he did not wish to enter the house till he could ensure that it was truly his own. For many like my friend, this ad from HSBC could be comforting.

 It is another matter that there may not be many like my friend. Indeed, there is a basic issue that may quarrel with the foundation of the HSBC ad ? it tries to promise an embarrassment-free transaction for the borrower. The assumption is that most consumers are still somewhat clueless about banking. Thus it would seldom occur to us even in 2005 that banks need to earn from the money that you and I deposit. So they need to lend it to someone at a higher interest rate. That is the business of banking. There is thus no favour involved in a loan, it is a pure commercial transaction. Even then the plea in the ad from HSBC is ? we will save you the embarrassment of borrowing.

 Moreover, modern times many say is the era of EMI. The prices of almost all durables are evaluated not in terms of the total price payable but in terms of the dent the EMI would make on the monthly budget. The Indian consumer today has opted to live today and pay later. Every year, crores worth of homes and cars, refrigerators and washing machines get owned by people who cannot afford it. There is no discomfort, let alone embarrassment.

 The moot point is whether there will be any in the case of taking a loan for personal purposes like daughter?s education or sister?s marriage. It is more than likely that the response from today?s consumer will possibly be ? what is the EMI? Is the bank banking on the consumer of yesterday?

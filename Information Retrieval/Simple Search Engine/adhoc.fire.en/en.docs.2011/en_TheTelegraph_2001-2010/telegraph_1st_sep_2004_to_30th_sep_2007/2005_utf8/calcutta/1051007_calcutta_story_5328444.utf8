The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Excellence tag norm eased 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The prospects of one or more colleges from the city being awarded the University Grants Commission (UGC)?s centre-of-excellence status is brighter again.

 Among the colleges from Bengal competing for the honour are St Xavier?s, Loreto, Scottish Church, Lady Brabourne, Belur Vidya Mandir and Serampore Girls? College (affiliated to Calcutta University).

 UGC acting chairman V.N. Rajesekharan Pillai said on Thursday that the panel was considering relaxing the conditions for the tag with regard to colleges from the state. 

 Pillai was on a visit to the city.

 A reason for the commission?s standing committee failing to select institutions for the tag at its last month?s meeting was that a section of members had opposed some of the conditions, as they were ?not in conformity? with the West Bengal government?s policy on higher education.

 ?Our centre-of-excellence scheme is aimed at bettering colleges,? Pillai said. 

 ?We want to ensure that every deserving college benefits from the scheme and we are ready to offer necessary relaxation to colleges that deserve the honour,? he added.

 One of the contentious conditions laid down by the UGC was that a college must run a good number of self-financed courses. 

 None of the colleges from the state can boast an impressive record on this, as the Left Front government had been opposed to such courses till even two years ago. 

 Self-financed courses were introduced by institutions here much later than their counterparts in other states.

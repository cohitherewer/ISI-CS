 Vinod Burman was murdered after he refused to transfer the ownership of his Tollygunge property to his relatives, two of whom wanted a share of the house, police said on Thursday.

 Burman?s murder and subsequent burial was carried out over a period of four hours. ?The needle of suspicion points to his two brothers,? police said. Vinod was the eldest of three brothers, one of whom lived with him in his Tollygunge house. This brother is handicapped.

 ?Going by confessions of a few persons, it appears that Burman was murdered by someone close to him after a property dispute,? said N. Ramesh Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south). 

 The 57-year-old man?s decomposed body was recovered from a pit beside his house, on Ishwar Ganguly Street, in the Kalighat police station area, on Wednesday evening. 

 According to police, more than one of his acquaintances hit Burman on the head and gagged him, before his body was buried in a narrow passageway beside the window. 

 The victim?s neighbours said they had heard the sound of digging in the passageway on Sunday afternoon. 

 Police have detained both his son Rajesh and a local small-time businessman who was interested in buying the house. Police have found incongruities in the statements of the two detainees, and have interrogated various other family members, including the victim?s daughter-in-law.

 Burman?s relatives had asked their acquaintances to come and persuade him to sell off portions of the house. 

 When he refused to do so, he was first beaten up. He was gagged possibly with a handkerchief. Then, someone hit him on the head with rods. The pit was dug and the body was dumped in it.

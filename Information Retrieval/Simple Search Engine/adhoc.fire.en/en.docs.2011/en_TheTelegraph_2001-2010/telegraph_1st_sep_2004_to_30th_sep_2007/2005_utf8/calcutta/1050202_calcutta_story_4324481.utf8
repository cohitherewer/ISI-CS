 The Eurasia winners of the Commonwealth Writers? Prize 2004-2005 were announced on Monday evening. Small Island by Briton Andrea Levy was named winner in the best book category, while The Sari Shop by Rupa Bajwa won in the best first book segment.

 Both will now move on to the final round in March, to be held at Malta, where the winning titles from the three other regions ? Africa, Caribbean and Canada, South East Asia and South Pacific ? will also compete.

 Last year, both regional winners ? Mark Haddon?s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time and Caryl Philips? A Distant Shore ? went on to bag the global distinction as well.

 With this, Calcutta University professor Sanjukta Dasgupta?s two-year tenure as chairperson of the Eurasia award committee has come to an end. She, along with Angela Smith of Stirling University Scotland and Nihal Fernando, University of Peredeniya, Sri Lanka, chose the winners out of over 100 entries from India, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Cyprus, Maldives, Malta and Maldives.

 The awardees were announced at a ceremony held at the Bengal Club by British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall, following a discussion on the relevance of Commonwealth literature in the current scenario. The panel, moderated by Victor Banerjee, included the two visiting judges as well as The Little Magazine editor Antara Dev Sen and Bill Ashcroft from the University of New South Wales, Australia.

 ?Translations are like wives. They are either beautiful or faithful, but never both,? was a joke about translated literary works that Antara Dev Sen challenged, exploring the scope of including regional language works under the Commonwealth literature umbrella.

 Angela Smith observed that the Commonwealth category has made books ?inclusive in class terms in a way that novels may not have been before?, while Bill Ashcroft stressed that English has allowed writers to take control of language to reach the largest possible audience.

 Advocateaccuses peers of assault

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 An advocate of Calcutta High Court on Saturday complained before the chairman of West Bengal Bar Council that a group of lawyers of the Alipore Judges court had threatened her to discontinue a case against one of their colleagues.

 Anamika Das alleged that on May 2, she was prevented from appearing for a case before the third civil judge of Alipore, Shantanu Das, by a group of lawyers. She said the lawyers assaulted her and drove her away from the court premises.

 The state Bar Council is generally treated as forum for the general public to voice complaints against lawyers.

 ?The group of lawyers used filthy language and threatened me with dire consequences if I proceeded with a contempt case against Shankar Sen, also an advocate at the Alipore court,? said Das.

 She is representing one of the owners of a land spread over seven mouzas near Kalipur, close to Ruby General Hospital, off EM Bypass. ?The court had appointed Sen as a receiver to look after the land. But he had started selling the land on his own,? Das added.

 The property is owned by the family. Following a dispute among the family members, the court had appointed Sen as the receiver. 

 When he had started selling the land, Das?s client approached the high court. Justice Prabir Kumar Samanta, on the basis of a plea, passed an order restraining Sen from dealing with the property.

 ?But he continued to sell the land, so we moved a contempt plea. On the basis of the petition, Justice Samanta issued a show-cause notice against the advocate,? Das said.

 Sen could not be reached for comments. According to Das, the group of lawyers who attacked her on the Alipore court premises for attending the hearing of the original case demanded that she withdraw the contempt case against Sen at the high court.

 She has already lodged an FIR at the Alipore police station against the lawyers.

 ?I have also written to the presidents of the Bar associations of both Alipore Judges Court and Calcutta High Court,? she signed off.

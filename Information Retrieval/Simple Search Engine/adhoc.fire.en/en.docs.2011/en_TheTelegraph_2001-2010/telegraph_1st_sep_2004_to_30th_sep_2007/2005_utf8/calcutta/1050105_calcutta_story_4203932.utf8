Antique order for energy flow

Feng Shui Matters

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, clocks symbolise movement 

in life and so you must ensure that all the clocks in the house are working, otherwise 

it is a sure sign of life coming to a standstill. Also, if you have lots of old 

furniture and antiques in the house, you should rearrange them from time to time 

so that the energy flow doesnt stagnate

Q: We have been living in our ancestral 

house for years now. We have a lot of old furniture. Life seems to have come to 

a standstill in the past few years. I wonder if these are the cause of our stagnating 

life. I want to get rid of them but my husband does not as they have sentimental 

value. Kindly suggest remedial measures to improve our lives.

Anita Agarwal

The Solution: You don?t have to get rid of 

your old furniture. Rearranging them in all the rooms will cause the energy to 

start moving around in your favour. Move nine things for nine consecutive days 

that have been kept in the same place for a long time to put an end to the stagnation. 

You could start with the heavy pieces of furniture and antiques and move on to 

lighter things like paintings, artefacts and clocks. Clocks are symbolic of movement 

in life, so you must ensure all the clocks in your house are working otherwise 

it is a sure sign of life coming to a standstill.

Q: My husband and I live in Calcutta 

and my in-laws stay in another city. We expect them to visit us in the near future. 

My relation with my mother-in-law has not been perfect. I have tried my best to 

please her during past visits, but somehow it has never worked. Kindly suggest 

some Feng Shui tips to help win her over.

Name withheld

The Solution: This is a very common problem 

faced by most daughters-in-law in India. According to Feng Shui, the eastern sector 

is good for strengthening family relations. I suggest you give them the room in 

the eastern part of your house and place their photographs at a focal point in 

it to make them feel important as soon as they enter. Energise the eastern wall 

of your lobby or any area where you all sit together to have tea or watch television 

with a nice family collage. Keep three bamboo shoots beside it on a blue or a 

green mat. This will help relations with your in-laws grow and prosper.

Q: My son is about to complete his 

computer engineering in the US this year. The campus placements are going on and 

nearly 80 per cent of his class has already got jobs. However, my son is still 

waiting and everybody in our family is worried. Please give us a few tips so he 

can get a good placement.

Arti Gupta

The Solution: Without your date of birth a 

specific assessment is not possible, but Feng Shui offers a very simple and effective 

solution to your problem. Tell your son to place a table (round if possible) on 

the northern side of the room and to spread a blue tablecloth over it. Fill a 

blue bowl with fresh water and dip seven metal coins in it and change the water 

everyday. He should place a confident photograph of himself in a metallic frame 

on the table. Keep an image of a deity on the table and write a note of affirmation 

saying he has got good placement and put it underneath the image. A pendulum or 

a revolving clock will further act as a powerful medium that will help him realise 

his dreams. In case it is not possible for him to do all this in the US, you can 

do it in his bedroom in India. 

Q: My date of birth is June 13, 1959. 

I have been going through a bad phase both in my personal and professional life. 

Currently I am going through severe financial crisis. Please suggest some remedies 

and also suggest favourable colours for my room, curtains and the auspicious directions 

that I should be facing. Is there any way to neutralise the bad effect time is 

having on my finances?

R.K.C

The Solution: According to your pillars of 

destiny, your material resources were under attack in the year 2004 but the situation 

is sure to improve in the new year. A very positive change in your life will take 

place in the year 2006 when you will be able to express yourself and your hidden 

potential, skill and talent will come into limelight. 

 In the meantime, surround yourself with earthy, metallic and water colours. Facing north-east would be extremely beneficial for you. A very powerful way to counterbalance the negative effect time is having on your finances is placing the salt and water cure in the south-east side of your living room. Take a plain transparent clear glass, place six copper and one silver coin in it and fill half of it with fresh salt. Fill the glass with water and cover it with a cling film and make a few holes in it with a pen. Change the arrangement after three months. Soon you will see that the salt has absorbed the negativity connected with your finances and you are out of your crisis.

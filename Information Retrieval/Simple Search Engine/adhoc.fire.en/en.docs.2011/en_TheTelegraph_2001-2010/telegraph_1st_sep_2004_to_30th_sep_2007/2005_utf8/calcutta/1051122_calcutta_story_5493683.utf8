 Front puts councillors on red alert

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta district Left Front committee has issued a whip directing all its councillors to attend the monthly meeting of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on November 24, which will discuss the eviction of squatters at Gobindapur rail colony. 

 The Front leadership fears that the opposition Trinamul Congress may disrupt the meeting.

 The councillors met on Monday morning at Promode Dasgupta Bhavan, on AJC Bose Road, the CPM?s Calcutta district committee office, where Front leaders briefed them.

 ?The settlers are on railway land. Calcutta High Court has ordered their eviction. The government has no role to play in this,? Raghunath Kushari, CPM Calcutta district committee secretary and convener of the district Left Front, told the councillors. 

 ?The Trinamul members might try to disrupt the meeting and each of you will have to be present and thwart any such move,? he added.

 Trinamul leader of the Opposition in the CMC Javed Khan said the ruling CPM?s motives were suspect.

 ?The CPM has no respect for the judiciary. That is clear from Left Front chairman Biman Bose?s remarks on Justice Amitava Lala, who had issued an order banning rallies in Calcutta by blocking roads on a working day. Now, the same party is touting a high court order to evict some poor people from their homes,? Khan added.

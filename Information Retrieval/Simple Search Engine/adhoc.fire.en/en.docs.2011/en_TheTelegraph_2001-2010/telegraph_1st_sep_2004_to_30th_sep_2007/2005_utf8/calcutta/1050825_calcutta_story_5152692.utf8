 Chain recovered in vain

 - Woman refuses to lodge DIARY against thief

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sergeant Purnendu Chatterjee took time off manning traffic to chase a thief, who was fleeing with a gold chain. The man was caught, but the woman the ornament was snatched from refused to lodge a police complaint even after repeated pleas by officers.

 The incident at the Maniktala crossing on Wednesday afternoon is being described by officers as an ?irresponsible act? by an educated Calcuttan, which will only help violators remain beyond the arm of the law, howsoever long it be. Turning a deaf ear to police pleas, the woman, Rakhi Dasgupta, went away after being handed over her chain.

 The culprit, identified as Mohammad Shahadat, was, however, arrested in connection with another case pending for the past few months. ?Going through his antecedents, we found he had been involved in another snatching case. He is a resident of Canal East Road,? said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police (north).

 Wednesday?s incident took place around 1.15 pm. Rakhi, a resident of Sahitya Parishat Street, was travelling in a private bus on route 234. Shahadat was in the same bus, standing close to her. 

 ?As the bus reached the Maniktala crossing, Shahadat snatched Rakhi?s chain and jumped off the vehicle,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 Rakhi immediately raised an alarm and got off the bus. Her shouts drew the attention of traffic sergeant Chatterjee, who was on duty at the intersection. The cop spotted Shahadat, in his 30s, sprinting away.

 Chatterjee promptly got off his motorcycle and chased the man. He got hold of Shahadat after running for around five minutes, Sharma added.

 ?Rakhi identified Shahadat. After a search on him, we also recovered the chain,? said an officer of Amherst Street police station. ?We then brought them to the thana.?

 The officers were surprised when Rakhi flatly refused to lodge a complaint against Shahadat.

 ?She claimed to be in a hurry, as she was going to fetch her child from school. Besides, she did not want to face post-complaint procedures, like appearing before a magistrate and identifying the culprit,? the officer said.

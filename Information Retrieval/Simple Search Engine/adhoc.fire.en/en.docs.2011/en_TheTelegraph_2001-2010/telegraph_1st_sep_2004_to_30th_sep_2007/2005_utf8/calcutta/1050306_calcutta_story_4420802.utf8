The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Music mixers moving in

ZEESHAN JAWED

The city party scene is rocking, man, and the proof 

lies in the console call.

Several disc jockeys (DJs) have shifted base to Calcutta in the last couple of years from other cities that are often known as the last word in nightlife (read: Mumbai, Delhi and Pune).

 The shift can be attributed to several reasons ranging from job satisfaction to cash count. ?There is a scope to do so much more here. People in Calcutta have not been exposed to many things in music. So anything new a disc jockey does, people on the dance floor appreciate it. This admiration satisfies the creative instinct of a DJ,? says DJ Lloyd who is currently turning the tables in BED. ?In Mumbai, people have more or less experienced everything. So they are quite nonchalant about your experiments.? 

 Moreover, adds Lloyd, the pay packet in Calcutta is a fixed one and does not fluctuate wildly like it does in Mumbai. He played in Fire and Ice before shifting base to Calcutta and joining Anticlock and then Tantra. 

 DJ Pradeep of Cloud 9 came to Calcutta a decade ago. He went back to Mumbai after a couple of years, but a better offer and the rocky party scene in Mumbai have brought him right back to Calcutta.

 ?In Mumbai, there?s a nightclub practically in every locality and people only want to dance to Hindi tracks. You play anything else and they turn their backs,? rues Pradeep. 

 DJ Sumedh, like DJ Pradeep, went back to Mumbai before returning to Calcutta. According to him, it is the lack of business for nightclubs that results in mediocre pay for DJs in Mumbai. ?The nightclubs there shut by 11 pm. By then, the party does not even peak and so many clubs incur huge losses,? says Sumedh. Calcutta parties late, and parties hard.

 so, the proximity of Calcutta to Singapore and Hong Kong helps city DJs lay their hands on the latest music before most others have.

 And then there is the Calcutta cushion that allows new DJs on the block to survive and thrive. ?The price of a DJ in Mumbai is determined by how famous he is. An Aqeel or a Suketu draws a mind-boggling sum but if you are not as famous, you are paid poorly,? says DJ Harish of Dublin.

 ?Moreover, Calcutta has retained its international flavour unlike Mumbai where nightclubs look straight out of Chandni Bar,? smiles Harish.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 THE BIG BITE

 Why more numbers and wider varieties rule 

 the restaurant scene

 Large is lucrative, and restaurateurs 

 around town are in a mad rush to sink their teeth into as 

 big a piece of the pie as possible. Following the recipe 

 of gargantuan oldies Amber and Bar-B-Q, Mainland China had 

 pioneered the big-format revolution south of Park Street 

 with 140 covers on Gurusaday Road. Now, every new place 

 that fires its chullah, is planning big.

 ?The moment you think on a wider 

 canvas, the investments are high. So you must have the confidence 

 to offer quality food and service consistently,? points 

 out Anjan Chatterjee, director, Speciality Restaurants Pvt 

 Ltd, which owns the Mainland China and Oh Calcutta! brands.

 And it?s not just about number 

 of covers but also nature of cuisine. With restauranting 

 no longer meaning just laid-back lunches, the spectrum is 

 automatically widened ? steaks and souffl?s and single malts 

 take up more square feet.

 ?The Calcutta cognoscenti now 

 looks for multiple entertainment solutions ? dining, lounging, 

 pubbing ? under a single roof. The focus thus is on multifarious 

 F amp;B outlets that have all the hospitality features,? 

 says Arvind Bhatnagar, head of operations, Grain of Salt.

 The Calcutta diner today is well 

 travelled and knowledgeable, seeking service and ambience 

 that match international - or at least national standards. 

 ?I?ve seen at Kurry Klub that it?s tough to get good clients 

 into a small place. People want five-star comfort and ambience 

 at lower prices, and it?s also important who sits at the 

 next table. The classy atmosphere can only be created if 

 you have the space,? observes Pradip Rozario, chef-owner 

 of the 95-seater KK?s Fusion.

 Catching the headwind, Cinnamon 

 Restaurant amp; Lounge, the latest entrant on Park Street 

 with a Mediterranean menu, has announced its arrival with 

 a bang, offering 132 covers in the restaurant and 70 more 

 at the forthcoming lounge.

 The fast-food caravan that?s rolled 

 into town is also buoyed by the big bite. If Pizza Hut at 

 22 Camac Street opened with a whopping 156 covers in June 

 2002, KFC, from the same stable, has come in with an expansive 

 75-seater restaurant to City Centre, generating similar 

 euphoria.

 ?Calcutta today has a significant 

 population of young Indians who have an aspirational lifestyle 

 and are on the lookout for variety. We get footfalls of 

 about 2,000 a day, going up over the weekends, which vindicates 

 our choice of scale,? says Sharanita Keswani, director marketing, 

 KFC, Yum! Restaurants International.

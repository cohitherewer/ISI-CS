 Dismay at lame dengue drive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has expressed dismay over the civic authorities? attempt to fight dengue with just one entomologist and suggested that an assistant entomologist be deployed in each ward.

 ?Intense fogging in the dengue-hit areas is not enough. Round-the-year surveillance, with help from voluntary organisations and self-help groups, is far more effective in combating the mosquito menace,? said R.M. Bhatt, who is leading the three-member ICMR team in the city.

 The dengue toll in the state has risen to 19, with the death of a 32-year-old woman in Sinthee on Tuesday. Papri Roy Choudhury, suffering from high fever for the past few days, had developed haemorrhagic symptoms, with blood oozing from the nose and mouth. The number of people affected by the disease has reached a staggering 2,026. 

 The ICMR team, which will submit a ?detailed report? to the health ministry, met municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Tuesday and discussed the reasons for the outbreak. At the meeting, Bhatt laid stress on regular cleaning of localities to prevent outbreak of dengue and malaria.

 Stung by the ICMR criticism, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said: ?We are planning to set up a mosquito-surveillance team under an assistant entomologist in each of the 15 boroughs.?

 Virologists have warned that dengue may spread further, as the recent spate of rain has produced more breeding grounds of the dengue-causing Aedes mosquito. 

 ?The severity of the disease has increased. There has been a 50 per cent rise in the number of patients coming to us daily,? a virologist at School of Tropical Medicine said.

 Sources said 111 suspected dengue cases were reported on Tuesday from various parts of the city. Six cases were reported from North 24-Parganas, four each from Howrah and South 24-Parganas, and one case from Salt Lake.

 Health services director Prabhakar Chatterjee said: ?We hope to contain the outbreak shortly.?

 Mughal mood melange

 Designer Komal Soods Diwali collection is a riot of colours and textures. It comprises stunning saris, churidar kurtas, tunics, tops, skirts, kurtas and jackets.

 There is a very strong Mughal feel to my entire collection. The motives, the embellishments and the hues remind us of the great bygone era, says Komal.

 The ancient appeal is adapted to modern sensibilities, fitted perfectly to suit contemporary silhouettes and styles. The colour story revolves around red and orange and the embellishments used are a striking combination of kundan, zardosi and aari work.

 My designs work best for an independent woman who is always ready to experiment, smiles the young designer who retails from Kyra on Free School Street and Hotel Hindusthan International, apart from many other stores nationally.

 Kurta couture

 Saharsh, a mens wear boutique at 105, Park Street, recently launched a line of occasion-wear kurtas for Diwali.

 And with this, the store dealing in shirts, suit lengths and fabrics from big labels like Raymonds, Digjam and Reid amp; Taylor has ventured into ethnic wear for the first time.

 Our latest entrant is designer kurtas for men. The look is very festive yet elegant, says Vijay Agarwal of Saharsh.

 The heavily-embroidered and embellished kurtas and sets come in sober whites, off-whites and beiges as well as vibrant hues. The range is priced at Rs 2,500-plus.

 The store also houses a mix-and-match collection where customers are offered personal style consultancy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Ten reasons to throng theatres this year

- Bengal, bachchan, bonding and more... 

Screen On amp; Off

(From top) Amitabh Bachchan in Viruddh; 

Aamir Khan as Mangal Pandey; moments from Black, Bunty Aur Babli 

and Shabd, Antonia Bernath in Kisna; shooting for Parineeta; 

a glimpse of Bose: The Forgotten Hero 

If Bollywood 2004 was about bikes, bodies and boundaries, 

expect 2005 to be the year of Bengal, Bachchan and bonding in tinsel town. As 

Metro lists the 10 most awaited films if this Year of the Rooster, there 

is more than a slice of the state in most projects, the father-son duo of Amitabh 

and Abhishek is all over the releases and human bonding ? between an aged couple, 

between a student and a teacher, between God and a disciple ? holds the key. Here?s 

a ringside view of what?s hot in Bollywood 2005?

1. Film: Black 

Director: Sanjay Leela Bhansali

Cast: Rani Mukherjee, Amitabh Bachchan, Nandana Dev Sen

Why: After lavish magnum opuses like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and 

Devdas, Bhansali returns to his Khamoshi days with this student-teacher 

tale inspired by the life of Helen Keller. Dark in imagery but bright in imagination, 

Black is a songless wonder that probably boasts of career-best performances 

from Rani and Amitabh. Ravi Chandran?s camerawork, Bela Sehgal?s scissorhands 

and Monty?s background music are the other high points of this venture.

Voice: ?No Indian film has ever been shot like Black. Everything 

clicked from day one of the shooting? --- Ravi Chandran, cinematographer

2. Film: Mangal 

Pandey/The Rising

Director: Ketan Mehta Cast: Aamir Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Amisha Patel, Tobey 

Stephens

Why: He hasn?t ever been able to get the mainstream mix right but there 

are so many things working in favour of this film that Ketan Mehta might just 

get lucky. Mammoth in budget (Aamir?s reportedly taken Rs 7 crore), the bilingual 

is targeted at a global audience as Mehta takes audiences back to the tumultuous 

days of 1857. A. R. Rahman?s music promises to be a delight. But the USP is definitely 

Aamir, who returns to the big screen after three years, a moustache that could 

well emerge as the style statememt of ?05.

Voice: ?I am really looking forward to The Rising. The music should 

go down well with everyone? ? A.R. Rahman, music director 

3. Film: Kisna 

Director: Subhash Ghai 

Cast: Vivek Oberoi, Hrishita Bhatt, Isha Sarvani, Antonia Bernath

Why: After the immensely forgettable Yaadein (he still thinks it 

was ahead of its times), the ?M? man returns with a grand period piece. Set in 

1947 and linking the age-old concepts of dharma and karma, Ghai 

banks on Vivek Oberoi this time to turn on the magic. The female quotient is trebled 

with two new faces in Isha and Antonia. If that still isn?t good enough to beat 

the box-office, Sushmita Sen in a qawwali item number should do the trick. 

Rahman?s theme song and the return of Ismail Devdas Darbar are the musical 

highs.

Voice: ?It?s been an absolute privilege working with Subhash Ghai. I have 

really learnt a lot? ? Vivek Oberoi, actor

4. Film: Shabd 

Director: Leena Bajaj 

Cast: Sanjay Dutt, Aishwarya Rai, Zayed Khan Why: One Sholon si 

song is good enough to push this film into the must-watch list. Ash in a flowing 

(and flimsy) black sari cavorting around Sanjubaba, looking serious in 

glasses; is it hot or is it hot! And with pre-release hype over how the Raincoat 

queen seduces Zayed in the film, Shabd is having quite a say in the 

trade market. Stunning images (Aseem Bajaj) and rocking music (Vishal-Shekhar), 

make this a flick to pick.

Voice: ?You have to see Sanjay Dutt in the film. He just rocks? ? Vishal 

Dadlani, music director

5. Film: Parineeta

Director: Pradeep Sarkar 

Cast: Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Vidya Balan, Raima Sen

Why: Calcutta has never been captured on celluloid quite like this. Sarkar?s 

vision, aided by Natarajan?s crisp camerawork, has made the Ganga ghats and the 

Howrah bridges look stunning. With Chhote Nawab on the toy train, swaying to Shantanu 

Moitra?s lilting music (inspired by Rabindrasangeet), and Raima Sen opposite a 

very Bangali Sanjay Dutt, Calcutta couldn?t get closer to mainstream Bollywood. 

Parineeta, set in a different time period, should do more justice to Sarat 

Chandra Chattopadhyay?s creation than Devdas could do.

Voice: ?The sheer passion of the whole team makes you give your best? ? 

Saif Ali Khan, actor 

6. Film: Bose: The 

Forgotten Hero 

Director: Shyam Benegal 

Cast: Sachin Khedekar, Rajit Kapoor, Jishu Sengupta

Why: The last time Netaji was captured on celluloid was in a special effects 

format, that too for a few seconds, in Kamal Haasan?s Hindustani. But this 

time he will be on the big screen for all of four hours (with some interesting 

confrontations with Adolf Hitler, if you please). Benegal?s dream project, where 

he takes the legendary freedom fighter out of the pages of history books, also 

has some great music by A. R. Rahman. And there is the added local touch in the 

form of Jishu, who plays young Netaji.

Voice: ?It has been an experience of a lifetime working with Mr Benegal? 

? Jishu Sengupta, actor

7. Film: Sarkar 

Director: Ram Gopal Varma 

Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Katrina Kaif, Tanishaa

Why: Forget the nightmare named Naach, Ramu is back to what he deals 

best with, and that is the underworld. This time, he has Francis Ford Coppola 

and Mario Puzo for inspiration. The Godfather-remake also fulfils Ramu?s 

all-time dream of working with the senior Bachchan and he even has the son doing 

an Al Pacino. There?s visual relief in the form of Katrina. This is one film Ramu 

would surely love to add to his ever-lengthening filmography.

Voice: ?It?s amazing to see them (Ram Gopal Varma and Amitabh Bachchan) 

work together? ? Tanishaa, actress

8. Film: Bunty Aur Babli 

Director: Shaad Ali 

Cast: Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, Amitabh Bachchan

Why: If Saathiya was any indication, poet-film-maker Muzaffar Ali?s 

son is in for a long innings in Bollywood. His second film is a road film with 

two lovers on the run and a cop on ther trail. While Abhishek and Rani will return 

together on the big screen after Yuva and Hum Tum, the two Bachchans 

will not play father and son. The music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and lyrics 

by Javed Akhtar should be another draw.

Voice: ?Abhishek has been a great friend and I can?t imagine a film without 

Rani. She is the best actress in the country? ? Shaad Ali, director

9. Film: Viruddh/Versus 

Director: Mahesh Manjrekar 

Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Sharmila Tagore, John Abraham

Why: The return of the Amitabh-Sharmila pair after 22 years (they last 

came together in Desh Premee) should see some reworking of the old magic. 

A return-to-roots kind of a film for Manjrekar, the film is about an old couple 

estranged from their NRI son and how they struggle to stay alive. With AB Corp 

returning to business and Bachchan playing ?an ordinary man?, this should be the 

Saraansh for the superstar.

Voice: ?He (Amitabh) spoils you. An actor of his calibre asking you what 

to do in a scene... I am honoured? ? Mahesh Manjrekar, director

10. Film: Kaal 

Director: Soham Shah 

Cast: Ajay Devgan, Vivek Oberoi, John Abraham, Lara Dutta, Esha Deol

Why: A thriller set in the forests, from the house of Karan Johar. Sounds 

implausible? Well, that?s what makes Kaal a must-check-out. While the storyline 

is a strict hush-hush, the film, shot on a start-to-finish schedule, boasts fierce 

tiger-fights. And with the talented trio of Ajay, Vivek and John at the helm, 

debutant Soham should be able to produce a Dhoom in 2005.

Voice: ?The script is so tight and gripping, it is bound to be one spine-chiller? 

? John Abraham, actor

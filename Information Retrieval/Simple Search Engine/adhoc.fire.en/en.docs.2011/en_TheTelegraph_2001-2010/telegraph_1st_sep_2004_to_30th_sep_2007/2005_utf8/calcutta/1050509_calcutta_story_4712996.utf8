 The curtains came down on the annual sports carnival hosted by the Saturday Club this weekend as the formal prize distribution ceremony got underway at the central hall of this posh club at 7.30 pm. 

 In its 30th year, the Sunfeast Saturday Club Inter Sports Carnival 2005, in association with The Telegraph, was as huge a hit as it has been for the past three decades. 

 Amid much cheering as a 600-strong audience waited to hear the final results, Bengal Rowing Club emerged the Carnival Champions 2005, while DI, Tollygunge Club and Saturday Club emerged runners-up. Rahul Suri of the host club took home the trophy for Best Sportsperson of the Carnival. 

 In the non-sports category, the first prize for the best opening night variety programme went to Tollygunge Club, while Saturday Club and Calcutta Swimming Club bagged first and second runners-up trophies respectively. Club presidents wife Vandana Burman handed over the prizes to the winners. 

 ?When the sports carnival started three decades ago, only two or three clubs participated. This year as many as nine clubs took part,? says club president Vijay Burman. 

 Possibly the biggest inter-club sports carnival in the country, the 10-day event held between April 28 and May 7 saw a turnout of at least 2,000 people every day that included participants and club members as part of the audience. 

 ?The annual event provides an opportunity for people from various clubs to get together, have fun and take home shiny trophies,? says joint convenor of the sports committee Dhirendra Singh. 

 And fun and camaraderie it was with youngsters making the club their home for most of the 10 days of the carnival. Bingeing on the delicious Indian and Chinese fare from the club kitchen, making new friends and spending more time with old ones besides participating in every second event and cheering their respective clubs is how theyve lived life during the carnival.

 The older lot also held their ground, indulging in some serious sports and equally serious cheering. 

 However, its the Saturday Club dance held during the carnival that is the biggest draw every year and this year was no different. Dressed in their party best, moms, dads, children and even grandparents landed up to enjoy a night to remember. Be it dancing to a live band or DJ music, the feet never stopped moving through the night. 

 ?No one wants to miss the dance night, passes are at a premium and members of other clubs and the party people of the city vie to be part of the celebrations,? shares Burman. 

 Through the 30 years of celebrations, much has changed but a core group has remained constant. ?We have dedicated the event to the staff of Saturday Club, some of whom have seen all 30 carnivals,? signs off Burman.

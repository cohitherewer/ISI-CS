 Green fuel plea gathers dust

 JAYANTA BASU

 The state government is clamouring for auto-LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), but at the same time it is dragging its feet in taking a stand on an application by a firm for setting up dispensing stations for the green fuel.

 Eastern Gases Ltd, a public limited company, had applied in April 2004 for land to set up 12 dispensing stations.

 ?We met transport officials and even the minister early last year and expressed our desire to set up LPG dispensing stations in the city. We sought land on lease, rent or a profit-sharing basis,? said Eastern Gases director S.K. Bansali.

 ?After the minister expressed interest in the project, we were shown land owned by state transport agencies. We chose plots for 12 stations and submitted a formal proposal. But nothing happened since then,? Bansali added.

 The firm had also proposed to set up another 21 stations in the districts.

 H. Mohan, a joint secretary in the transport department, admitted having received the application, but said the firm lost interest midway. Contacts have been re-established and a fresh proposal was submitted a few days back, which the government is ?positively considering?, he added.

 Eastern Gases has a tie-up with Indian Oil Petronas Pvt Limited, a Haldia-based company set up by Indian Oil and Petronas, of Malaysia. 

 ?Eastern Gases is our marketing agent and we have no problems supplying auto-LPG to them,? said Mrinal Roy, chief executive officer of Indian Oil Petronas. 

 The company, he added, ?can supply around 15,000 metric tonnes of the fuel per month? to Eastern Gases. This was conveyed to the expert committee set up by the transport department a year ago.

 Presently, seven LPG dispensing stations are functioning in the city, against a minimum of 75 as specified by the transport committee. Even the stations that are operative are often hit by erratic supply.

 ?When all major cities are switching to LPG, why should Calcutta be left behind?? asked environment activist Subhas Dutta. ?Taking into consideration the pollution level in the city and that CNG is still a distant possibility, we have no option but to fall back on LPG,? he asserted.

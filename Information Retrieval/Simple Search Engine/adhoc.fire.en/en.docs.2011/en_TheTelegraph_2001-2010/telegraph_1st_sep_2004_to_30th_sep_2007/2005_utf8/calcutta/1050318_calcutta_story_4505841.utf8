 Status quo in civic budget

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With an eye on the June polls to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), mayor Subrata Mukherjee placed on Thursday a deficit budget for 2005-2006, sparing the Calcuttan as well as business establishments in the city any new civic tax burden or enhancement of charges for services rendered.

 Mukherjee tabled a Rs 894.21-crore budget with a deficit of Rs 85.17 crore for 2005-2006, without taking into account the extra revenue of Rs 150 crore the CMC has recently earned from the second waiver of the outstanding property tax interest scheme, courtesy the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government.

 ?We haven?t slapped any new tax or charge either on house-owners or on commercial establishments. Neither have we enhanced existing charges,? said Mukherjee.

 As things stand, if he spends Rs 85.17 crore out of Rs 150 crore to bridge the deficit, the budget for 2005-06, like the two previous ones, will show a surplus of Rs 64.83 crore.

 Additional chief of municipal finance and accounts Debotosh Dasgupta said the mayor had broken all previous records in terms of earning revenue, and it is the first time the civic budget expenditure will cross the Rs 1,000-crore mark in 2005-2006.

 Leader of the Opposition Nirmal Mukherjee wondered how revenue earned in February was not reflected in a budget in March. 

 ?Since no specific additional expenditure plan has been drawn up against the additional revenue earning of Rs 150 crore, it was not mentioned as income in the budget proposals,? said a civic officer.

 Court hopes alive on dead bridge

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 In 2002, the high court, while disposing of a petition by Rajarhat residents, had expressed the hope that the state government would construct a bridge over Kestopur canal after receiving funds.

 Three years later, on Wednesday, when the same petitioners moved the high court alleging that nothing had been done yet about constructing a bridge, the court, on the basis of the government?s assurances, disposed of the petition with an observation similar to the one it had made in 2002.

 ?Let us hope that the government will meet the popular need by constructing a bridge on Kestopur canal, when funds will permit it to undertake the project.? This is what the high court had said in 2002. The court repeated the words, while disposing of the petition on Wednesday.

 Three years ago, members of the Baroaritola Purbapara Nagarik Unnayan Samity had moved the high court after the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) cancelled the tender floated by the agency to construct a steel bridge on the canal.

 ?The CMDA is making an unnecessary delay in starting the construction of the bridge. The proposed bridge will connect Kestopur with AG and AK blocks of Salt Lake,? the petitioners? association said. 

 The CMDA had undertaken the project in 1999, and a large number of people of the area were waiting for years for the proposed bridge.

 The high court had asked the CMDA and the state government to submit their views with regard to the petition. 

 The government lawyer then assured the court that the CMDA would start construction of the bridge as soon as funds would be available. 

 The court had disposed of the petition in the hope that the government would start the construction after getting the wherewithal.

 On Wednesday, when the Samity moved court again, alleging that nothing had been done yet, the state government lawyers told the court that a larger project had been undertaken to develop Kestopur canal and its surroundings.

 ?The canal will be used for navigation. The techno-economic study report of British Waterways has dealt with the aspect of developing the canal,? additional government pleader Debasish Kargupta told the court. 

 Kargupta added that the canal would be developed for passenger and freight transport and tourism. 

 ?Construction of the bridge on the canal will be part of the programme,? he said, adding that the project would be started when funds would be available.

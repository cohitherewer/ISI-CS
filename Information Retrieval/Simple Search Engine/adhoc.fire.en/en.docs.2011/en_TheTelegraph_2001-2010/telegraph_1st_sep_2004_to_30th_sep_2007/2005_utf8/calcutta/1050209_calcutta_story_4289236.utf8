The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shops in the way of wider link road

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A road extension project in Baguiati has run into rough weather, with a section of local traders resolving to oppose the demolition of around 200 shops, in the absence of a rehabilitation package for the owners.

 Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality chairman Tapas Chatterjee, however, has ruled out any rehabilitation for the ?encroachers?.

 Speaking to Metro over the weekend, he asserted that the civic body would go ahead with the project, being financed by the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco). 

 ?Once widened, the VIP Road-Jessore Road link will not only help ease vehicular movement but facilitate introduction of more bus routes,? Das added.

 The project has been pending for more than two decades, ever since the PWD had completed a survey on widening the VIP Road-Jessore Road links. Lack of funds and encroachment stood in the way of its implementation.

 The local traders are up in arms against the PWD and civic officials for the ?arbitrary manner of determining the criteria for widening the link roads?.

 The shop-owners who are opposing the project are occupying private plots in Gobinda Seth bazaar, 25 metres from VIP Road. Those who own shops on a PWD plot (New Market) on the other side of the link road have been spared.

 ?According to the PWD map, the width of the road is 12.5 metres and the road space, 7.5 metres. A 1.5-metre-wide footpath and a two-metre-wide working space have been reserved for pedestrians and development agencies, respectively,? pointed out Bijay Bhadra, secretary of the Old Market committee.

 ?While there is a clear demarcation of the road space, the civic authorities have remained content with a move to demolish shops on private land,? he claimed. 

 He alleged that New Market had been left untouched as it had recently donated a sewage disposal van to the municipality. Secretary of the New Market committee Adhir Das refused comment. 

 Civic chairman Chatterjee, however, conceded that there might have been some deviations in the measurements to determine the road width. ?We had identified an old shop as the point of demarcation on the southern flank,? he said. ?I don?t know if this is the perfect way to determine the width, but in such cases, one has to make some compromises.?

 PWD executive engineer (roads) Shankar Chakrabarty denied any deviation. ?We are following the orders of the civic body and have nothing to do with the demarcation,? he asserted.

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Your 

instincts never let you down. You are honest and noble in your dealings. Heads 

turn when you enter a crowded room. You have a child-like innocence that appeals 

to others. At work, you cannot brook delay. You can inspire your co-workers. You 

are good at handling both the monetary and creative aspects of a job. ? Kusum 

Bhandari

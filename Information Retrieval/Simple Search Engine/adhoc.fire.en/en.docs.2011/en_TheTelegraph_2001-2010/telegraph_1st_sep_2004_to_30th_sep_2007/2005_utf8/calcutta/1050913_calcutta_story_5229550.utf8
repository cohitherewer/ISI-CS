The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Job hunt off campus 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For the first time in its history, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, on Monday organised placement interviews for students outside its premises, as the stalemate continued on campus.

 The interviews were conducted at the Institution of Engineers (India), on Gokhale Road, Calcutta.

 ?Sixty students from the departments of information technology, electronics and telecommunication and computer science and computer applications appeared for the interviews for jobs in a Bangalore-based company,? said M.K. Sanyal, head of the human resources management department of the university.

 The university authorities had ordered nearly 1,000 boarders to vacate the hostels, cancelled undergraduate classes and campus interviews following a clash among students on the night of September 8. 

 The authorities had been forced to summon the police.

 N.R. Banerjea, vice-chancellor of the university, said: ?Not holding campus interviews will deprive some of our students of good jobs. We do not want that.?

 On Monday, A.K. Ghosh, professor-in-charge of students? affairs of the university, held a series of talks with student representatives to resolve the campus stand-off. ?We want to bring back normalcy at the earliest,? stated Ghosh.

 A Mughal tragedy

 History is full of momentous episodes that serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic reality of life. Yaadon Ke Bujhe Huye Savere, the latest production of Little Thespian, undertakes a journey into the past, uncovering truths that reveal the eternal, insurmountable divide that exists between human desire and its fulfilment. The Hindi adaptation of Ismail Choonara?s A River Across the Unseen Divide, it deals with the last days of the Mughal emperor, Shahjahan. Imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb, Shahjahan spends his days gazing restlessly at the Taj Mahal, the majestic monument he had built to commemorate his love. But, instead of soothing his tortured soul, memories from his past haunt him; ironically making him aware of his present wretchedness as compared to his former glory. His pathos is further heightened when, listening to the murmuring of River Yamuna, he fails to realise that it is the obstacle between his prison and the destination of his desire. Direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala.

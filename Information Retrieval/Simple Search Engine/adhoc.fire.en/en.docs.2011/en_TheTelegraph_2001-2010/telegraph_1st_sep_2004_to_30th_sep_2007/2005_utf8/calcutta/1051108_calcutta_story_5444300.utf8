 Candle cradle that cares

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 The beauty of simple candles can multiply a million times if they are placed in the right holders. This theory is re-established with just one glance around the gift section of Osho World in Forum.

 On display is a variety of unique candle-stands and holders in happy colours and stunning forms. The basic wooden and glass elements come into play here, as they mix and match, experimenting with various textures and styles.

 Collections from Osho World are always based on a theme, usually defined by dedication to a spiritual mystic. This offering, an array of lighting arrangements, is an ode to the warmth of a flame ? the flame of hope and knowledge, said a spokesperson from Osho World.

 The wooden collection includes some elementary structures like logs that hold round candles and thin wooden planks that hold glass bowls, which in turn hold the candles. Other wooden pieces are circular plates and theres a plethora available in many other geometric patterns.

 The glass collection employs a technique using coloured paper fusing on glass. The result, quite like etched glass, is magical. These holders are available in various shapes and sizes. What catches the eye is the exquisite colour story that these pieces seem to tell.

One can pick up any of the colours, depending on the rooms theme. Choose from the reds and yellows, greens, shades of blue or the pink and purple combos. 

 These holders come in flat, bowl-like shapes and smart squares, but the showstopper is a large lantern-like piece. Based on a sturdy stand, this ones a real steal. Any of these glass bowls can be filled with water and used as a pretty base to float candles. One can also use them as simple candle stands. 

 Diya holders in wood, copper and Sterling silver are on display here. One can also check out the stone holders. Finished with natural roughness, these stone pieces are perfectly crafted for your drawing room.

 The candle holders create a certain aura in the house. They exude marvellous, positive energy and the colour palette is also very soothing. Hence, they are perfect as a gift to yourselves as well as to your loved ones, says Swami Om Satyam from Osho World Galleria.

 Mrs Calcutta makes the poorest model. Beauties from Bengal may be rocking the Bollywood screen and the hot-bod brigade from the state may be storming the national ramp, but the married Calcutta woman is a misfit on the ramp.

 A rather sorry face ? and figure ? of the Bengal beauty presented itself at the state selections of the Bombay Dyeing Gladrags Mrs India 2006 on Wednesday.

 Thirty short-listed candidates from around 600 applicants turned up for the auditions at Tantra. But much to the disappointment of contest director Maureen Wadia, only ?a couple of girls were okay?.

 The model-maker dubbed the Calcutta participants the ?poorest? in India. ?I have conducted the auditions in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi, but I am really appalled at the quality of the girls in Calcutta. Most were not up to the mark; they didn?t even deserve a second of my time,? said Maureen.

 And what ails Mrs Calcutta? ?Even if there were a few pretty faces, most of the women were terribly overweight and out of shape. It?s clear that they do not take care of their figures at all. And even though I am not looking at making models from Mrs India contestants, the winners have to participate in international beauty pageants where they even have to flaunt swimsuits. So, along with vivacity and confidence, it?s also necessary to boast a great body.?

 While the quality of talent in Maharashtra and Punjab bowled her over, the lady credited with star-spotting John Abraham, Dino Morea, Koena Mitra and Lara Dutta, was also quite impressed with the scene down South.

 Maureen, however, is still hopeful of one or two Bengal girls making it to the final round in Mumbai this December.

 And she even attempted to find a reason for the flop show. ?I feel most married women in this state are too shy to get into a beauty pageant. They might also be facing resistance from family,? she said, lamenting the low turnout in Bengal ? just 600 applicants from the national pool of 40,000.

 Maureen Wadia?s words of woe were echoed by various vital cogs in the Calcutta fashion wheel.

 ?Why just speak about married women? There?s a total lack of good models in Calcutta. Whenever I need to get a shoot done, I have to turn to models from Delhi or Mumbai. I never find anybody in Calcutta. The few good models who were there have moved out,? said designer Anamika Khanna.

 The designer does feel that married women in Calcutta are becoming more conscious about their figures, but they are no match for their counterparts in Delhi or Mumbai. ?Calcutta women still need a lot of time to be on a par with their counterparts in Delhi or Mumbai in terms of appearance consciousness.?

 Model Shonal Rawat, who earned her spurs on the city stage before moving to Mumbai, agrees. ?Right now in Calcutta, any girl with a pretty face calls herself a model. There?s no emphasis on figure and grooming at all. None of them works hard enough to maintain a good body, which is essential for a model.?

 Shonal picked Sanjukta as ?the only good model? to have surfaced from the city in the past year.

 (Maureen, of course, turned the clock further back to pick Koena Mitra as the ?last good model? she had discovered from Calcutta before ?the slump?).

 Shonal blamed the absence of married women from the modelling scene in Calcutta on the social structure here. ?Some of the best models of our country are married women, right from Aditi Govitrikar to Lakshmi Rana. But in Calcutta, I feel, a married woman doesn?t have enough support from family and society to make a career on the ramp. Apart from Pinky, I?ve never come across a successful model in Calcutta who?s married.?

 Hi-tech gate twins at Memorial

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A computerised entry system is to be installed at Victoria Memorial Hall. The installation will coincide with the introduction of the entry fee to the complex. The Memorial authorities have finalised a deal with Webel Communication System in this regard.

 Announcing this before a division bench of Calcutta High Court, Jayanta Mitra, counsel for the Memorial authorities, said the trustee board would meet on July 25 to sanction the deal.

 ?After that, an entry fee will be introduced at the Memorial. The public works department has been asked to construct the special gates ? one in the north and the other in the south,? the lawyer added.

 When the court asked Mitra why his client had not yet carried out the Supreme Court order on the introduction of an entry fee, the lawyer replied that the authorities were trying to obtain the help of a nationalised bank for the purpose.

 ?But the bank, on July 15, expressed its inability to help the Memorial in the matter. Webel was then approached. It has agreed to lend assistance in the matter,? the lawyer elaborated.

 Introduction of an entry fee to the Memorial has been pending for long. As per the recommendations of an expert committee, a division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutt, had asked the Memorial to introduce a fee for entering the compound.

 The expert committee?s recommendation was an attempt to check the number of visitors to the monument to save it from pollution. The order of the high court in favour of introducing a Rs-4 entry fee was upheld by the Supreme Court.

 Environmental activist Subhas Dutta had filed a petition informing the high court that Memorial authorities had not introduced the entry fee even after the Supreme Court directive. Advocate Mitra announced that the authorities? plans during the hearing of that petition on Tuesday.

 The division bench expressed deep concern on learning that rainwater was still leaking from the roof of the Memorial. Dutta had informed the court about the leak. Mitra said the authorities were trying their best to set right the problem. 

 ?This problem should be discussed in the trustee board?s meeting on July 25. This is a serious issue. The leaks should be repaired immediately,? the judges said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Digital leap for the Devi

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From the mandap to the mobile phone ? the goddess will be making a digital leap this Puja, thanks to Hey Ya!.

 Pandal-hopping will be a little different this year, as a simple SMS will allow Calcuttans to download their favourite idol?s image as mobile phone wallpaper.

 The first step is for Durga puja organisers across the city and the suburbs to register with Hey Ya!, the short code service launched in June 2005, by ABP Pvt Ltd in association with Yahoo!.

 ?Each pandal that registers will be given a unique code to be advertised at the venue, with instructions on how to download the images,? said a Hey Ya! spokesperson about the event, titled Mobiley Pujo.

 On Panchami, the organisers can email images of their idols to Mobiley Pujo, which will be available for download Sashthi onwards.

 ?The idea is to turn the spotlight back on the idol, which is really the core of the Pujas. Mobiley Pujo is also a step in that direction where we transport the on-ground Puja into the digital age,? the Hey Ya! spokesperson explained.

 Organisers stand to win prizes through Mobiley Pujo. The pandal registering the highest number of image downloads would receive a TV and Home Theatre system from Hyundai Electronics. There would be one winner from Calcutta and another from the suburbs.

 ?I found the proposal very attractive and this concept will definitely attract a lot of attention,? felt Kashi Nath Pal, secretary of Bidhan Nivas Housing.

 ?Moreover, those who have moved out of Calcutta will still be able to download the image of the idols and share the festive feeling,? added the puja organiser.

 Besides offering wallpapers, ring-tones, logos and other value-added services like celebrity birthdays, Hey Ya! has also conducted an SMS auction service.

 You share your birthday with...

 Anupam Kher 

You aim for perfection in all you do. Once you make a decision, you stick by it. You have a positive outlook and feel that everyone is essentially honest and well-meaning.

You are truthful, caring and intense in your love for others. ? Kusum Bhandari

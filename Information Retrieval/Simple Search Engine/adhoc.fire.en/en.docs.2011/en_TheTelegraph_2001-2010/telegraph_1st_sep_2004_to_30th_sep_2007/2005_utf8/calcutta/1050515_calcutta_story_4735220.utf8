The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beat blues of boredom

 Elections and opinion polls are opportunities to get away from the insipid daily diet

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 My encounters with him are always on the street. Most days we smile at each other and walk by. The other day, pretty unusually, he stopped, smiled and whispered: ?Ki bujhchhen (What do you make of it)?? I had no idea what ?it? was. His next question explained it: ?Subrata parbe (Can Subrata do it?)?? I first thought this was a neighbourhood concern, hence the question to me. He clarified immediately: ?Kichhu beriyechhe? (Has any result come out?)?

 There are some professionals who are always in the public eye. Film stars, politicians, journalists are all subjected to constant public scrutiny. Most others are thankfully spared. On a chance meeting with a lawyer you barely know, you do not usually talk to him about the cases he is handling. As a person who makes his living from his intimacy with consumers, public intrusion into my work arena is pretty rare. Election time temporarily removes this sun shade and exposes even people like me to public curiosity. Thanks to opinion polls.

 In this heady time of public attention, there are two kinds of experiences that a pollster has to contend with. The first is public curiosity. Can they know the results before they hit the headlines? More uncomfortable is the other debate. Why did it go wrong last time? How come some were right and some wrong? Was the sampling or the sample size adequate?

 The arguments for and against eventually lead to a pertinent question. Why do we do opinion polls if we cannot get it right every time? The opinion polls are, for the record, not a self-sponsored publicity blitz by polling companies. They are paid for by the media and the supposedly dodgy results are carried prominently. Indeed, many hours of primetime on television and precious space on the front page are devoted to discussions on the likely outcome of an election based on opinion poll results.

 Why do media pay for something that is so patently inconsistent? The simple truth is that people enjoy the results of opinion polls, irrespective of whether they eventually come true or not. And there is a very good reason for it. Elections we all know is serious business. Yet, to many of us it is more a game show like Indian Idol. It usually has star contestants like the Sonia Gandhis and Atal Bihari Vajpayees or Mamata Banerjees and Subrata Mukherjees. It is a multi-episode game show. Election Day is merely the climax of a long series. We the people consume this game show and follow it right through its progress, much like any other game show that has serialised tension building.

 During this game when we are gulping newspapers in the morning and remaining glued to the TV news in the evening, the poll results provide us with regular status reports. The ultimate convergence of the prediction and the result is of little consequence to us. What matters is the enjoyment of the moment. It is more than likely that many enjoy the exercise because they can contemplate ? what if these results were true? They love it and that is why press and TV spend money to get these polls done.

 To return to my friendly neighbourhood acquaintance, for him the game show has started. True, he is one of the very early birds. It possibly depends on how desperate you are with your boredom, how intensely starved you are of in-house entertainment. Elections and opinion polls are opportunities to get away from the insipid daily diet. 

 The new thriller ? ?Subrata ki parbe?? ? will most probably be a super-duper hit. Irrespective of opinion poll predictions. Or of actual election results.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hush-up haze in mishap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Model Sharan Mishra: Mystery burns

 She began the month walking the Bridal Asia 2005 ramp in Delhi. She ended the month battling severe burns in a south Calcutta nursing home.

 The three-year-old modelling career of Sharan Mishra has been cruelly cut short by a fire that engulfed her upper body under mysterious circumstances at her home near Malancha cinema.

 Sharan, 23, who grew up in Calcutta before shifting base to Delhi last year, had come to her husband for a holiday. 

 ?On October 21, at 1.40 pm, Sharan was brought here in a critical state. She had suffered 60 per cent burns and the entire upper portion was charred. We have kept her in the intensive care unit,? S. Bishnu, resident medical officer of Revival Nursing Home, told Metro on Monday. ?According to our records, the mishap occurred while she was cooking on October 19, around 3 pm.?

 That is where the discrepancies begin. Sharan?s husband Umang Tiwary told Metro that the accident occurred at night. 

 ?After dinner, I was in the bedroom and Sharan was in the kitchen. Suddenly, I heard her scream? Her clothes had caught fire and her upper body was in flames.?

 Umang who, like Sharan, was born in Uttar Pradesh and brought up in Calcutta, is a third-year student at Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. He told Metro the two had been ?married for five years?, and admitted they had ?a small tiff? before the incident.

 Sharan was first rushed to MR Bangur Hospital and later shifted to Revival.

 Sharan?s mother Vidyapati Mishra said: ?Suddenly, in the middle of the night, we received a call from Umang?s parents? We really don?t know what happened and how it happened.?

 Officers at Regent Park police station could not recall ?any such case?, but at Gariahat thana, sub-inspector R. Sanyal said he had taken Sharan?s statement. 

 ?She has been burnt badly till her thighs. She said she was in the kitchen when her clothes caught fire.?

 Sharan won the Metropolitan Top Model India Hunt in 2003, which took her to Paris. In Milan Fashion Week 2004, she showcased Sabyasachi Mukherjee?s designs, and has been a regular at India Fashion Week for three years.

 Word of the ?accident? filtered into the fashion fraternity from Sunday, drawing murmurs of a ?hush-up?.

 Sharan had recently expressed a desire to end her modelling career and settle down, said Umang. 

 The end to her career has come, swiftly and tragically.

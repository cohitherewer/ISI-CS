 Regular school ray of hope for disabled 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A ray of hope glimmers on the horizon for disabled children.

 An action plan is being prepared to implement human resources development minister Arjun Singh?s ?path-breaking decision? of including disabled children into mainstream schools, including those run by the government.

 Mithu Alur, of Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) and convener of All India Regional Alliance for Inclusion (AIRA), is in Calcutta for a ?consultation programme? on the issue. She met minister of state for Sunderbans affairs Kanti Ganguly, who is also general secretary of Paschim Banga Rajya Pratibandhi Sammilani, on Wednesday.

 The consultation programme, being supported by the human resources development ministry, will be inaugurated by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi on Friday at Mani Kanchan Conference Centre, in Salt Lake.

 ?All children, regardless of their disability, should be allowed admission to mainstream schools. If the ministry has its way, no disabled child will be denied admission,? Alur said on Thursday.

 Apart from minister Ganguly, participants at Friday?s session will include a joint secretary from the human resources development ministry, Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy chairperson Uma Ahmed, Philip O? Keefe (from World Bank), disability activists, parents of disabled children and heads of 15 city schools. 

 The ministry?s newly-released document, titled Inclusive Education for Children and Youth with Disabilities, will be discussed by the participants.

 ?Unless an action plan is formulated in time, the Centre?s decision will remain just a statement. The hurdles in the way to induct disabled children into mainstream schools needs to be identified. Our deliberations will provide inputs to the ministry for preparing the action plan,? Alur elaborated.

 According to minister Ganguly, statistics on the disabled population in the state are not reliable. ?While the last census puts the number of disabled at 2.73 per cent of the total population, the actual figure is around eight. Our aim is to provide regular schooling to all disabled children, in both rural and urban areas,? said Ganguly.

 ?The Union government?s decision on taking responsibility of disabled children is a landmark decision. So far, it has largely been the responsibility of NGOs,? said an official of the cerebral palsy institute.

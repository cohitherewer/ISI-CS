 New-fare formula ends strike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Operators of private and minibuses called off their two-day strike halfway through Wednesday. They had taken their vehicles off the road on Tuesday.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty met operators at Writers? Buildings and urged them to call off the strike, in view of passenger plight. 

 He promised to look into their problems but made it clear he could do nothing about either withdrawing cess on fuel or reduction of sales tax.

 Chakraborty said revised fares are likely to be announced on Thursday after the Left Front meeting.

 ?We have withdrawn the strike as the transport minister assured us that our demands would be looked into,?? said president of Bengal Bus Syndicate Swarnakamal Saha.

 He said the transport minister had agreed to frame a new formula on commission for drivers and conductors. ?Now, commission is paid on the total sale of tickets but we want it to exclude the cost of diesel,?? Saha explained.

 President of Joint Council of Bus Syndicate Sadhan Das warned of another indefinite strike if the transport department did not take any effective steps to meet the demands.

 Though the bus strike ended in the afternoon, services were thin and are likely to normalise from Thursday. Taxi operators called off their strike on Wednesday morning, after observing it for a day.

 Dry spell at blood banks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The summer heat and the civic polls on June 19 have resulted in a scarcity in the city?s blood banks. With stocks at most state and private blood banks reduced to half, the authorities are considering steps to boost blood supply. 

 According to officials of the Central Blood Bank (CBB) in Maniktala, the situation is serious, but not alarming. The blood bank has a stock of 1,500 units, compared with 3,000 units the rest of the year. 

 ?We are keeping an eye on the supply of blood. If things worsen, we will write to various organisations, urging them to organise more blood donation camps,? a CBB official said on Thursday.

 He added that several blood donation camps had been cancelled in the recent past because of lack of donors. ?Even if the camps are held, the collection goes down to 50 units from the usual 150,? he stated. 

 In January, the CBB received 10,700 units from 180 blood donation camps. In May, the figure was down to 7,400 from 140 camps. The crisis has worsened with the approach of the civic elections.

 The CBB officials said there is a misconception that donating blood in summer is harmful. ?We are starting an awareness campaign to motivate donors and to get rid of the misconception,? an official said.

 The blood bank authorities are also asking relatives of patients who need blood transfusion to bring donors with them. 

 ?The severe shortage of blood is due to the civic elections and summer,? declared D. Ashish, director, Medical Blood Bank. 

 According to him, the number of blood donation camps has gone down by 70 per cent over the past month.

 He added that most blood banks in the city are not equipped to deal with the problem. 

 ?Many blood banks do not have round-the-clock collection facilities, as the laboratories close by the evening,? he explained.

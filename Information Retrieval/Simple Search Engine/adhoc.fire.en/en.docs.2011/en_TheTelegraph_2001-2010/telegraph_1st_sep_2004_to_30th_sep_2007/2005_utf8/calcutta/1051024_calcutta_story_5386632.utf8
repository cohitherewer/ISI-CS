The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Matching steps with remix rhythm

 Model Nicolette Bird takes a break from her hectic schedule in Mumbai and relaxes in hometown Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Pabitra Das 

 She didnt sign films because graduating from college was a priority. She refuses all Christmas assignments that come her way because she has to be home with family and then party all night at DI. She also co-owns a horse with 10 others, but isnt allowed to ride it. 

 Confusions, contradictions and more. Thats model Nicolette Bird. But for all her chirpiness, she sure has a sensible head on those toned shoulders.

 Now, with graduation out of my way, I would love to take a joyride to Bollywood but not until I am absolutely ready for it. There are so many things to work on. Urdu lessons, my diction and, of course, the oh-so-essential acting lessons.

 And if youre wondering where the oh-so-very-essential dance lessons figure, then dont bother, coz Nicolette is already quite a champ when it comes to making those moves.

 They earned her the spotlight in the music video Saiyyan dil mein aana re and theres been no looking back since. Nisha followed soon and then came Ankhiyan milake.

 I have had such a blast during all these videos but Rajneesh Duggal was the hottest highlight in Ankhiyan! she laughs.

 Three remix videos in two years, and good choices at that. So whats Nicolettes lucky selection line? The artiste is most important and I should like the song as well. Second, one should see how well they benefit from the video, in terms of stage shows, visibility and performances. And, of course, I am very particular about my look. No sleazy, sexy videos for me.

 The model has now moved from item girl to candy floss, with her next video all sugar, no spice. Its going to be shot in Bangkok and since its a guy song, I wont have to lip sync. All I need to do is smile sweetly and job done!

 Nicolette is on a high and why not, with campaigns such as ICICI, an AIDS awareness spot, TVS Scooty, Fast Track and Zee Sports Federation Cup on the run.

 And the highlight? When I signed the one-year contract with Elle 18, I knew I had arrived. They took care of everything from my styling to my presence. What else could I ask for?

 On second thoughts, she says that she would love to ask for more time with her family here in the city. Touching down in the airport and reading Bangla ads is a bliss... My sister Edwina is like my little Barbie doll and I love dressing her up. She is growing up and misses me too. And as for dad? Well, when he misses me, he just steps out to catch a glimpse of my Zee Sports hoarding. Thankfully, its right beside home, says the girl from Park Circus.

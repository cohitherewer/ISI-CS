 Pillion rider crushed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A woman riding pillion on her husband?s two-wheeler was killed on Sunday afternoon when a private bus hit it from behind at Labony Island, in Salt Lake.

 Gita Pal, 50, a resident of HB Block, under Bidhannagar (South) police station, and her husband Basudeb, 55, were returning from the doctor?s chamber in Lake Town. 

 Around 12.15 pm, when the two-wheeler was crossing Labony Island, a private bus (WB-R3585) on route 32/A hit the vehicle. 

 ?The bus crushed the woman under its rear wheels. She was pronounced dead when she and her husband were taken to a private hospital. The husband was admitted to the hospital,? said a senior police officer. 

 The bus was impounded and the driver arrested.

 Basudeb Pal suffered a fracture in the pelvic bone near the pubic joint and though he is in his senses, he is not out of danger yet. 

 This was the third accident on the same spot within the past few months. In the earlier two mishaps, six persons were injured, including local Trinamul Congress councillor Asesh Mukherjee, police sources said. 

 Mukherjee alleged that no traffic policeman is posted at the island. ?There is no traffic light, either. This is largely responsible for the repeated accidents occurring there,? the councillor said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rail station risk for airport safety shield

 A boundary wall of Calcutta airport: Security sieve

 The airport authorities see a potential risk in the Circular Railway terminus coming up in Shibtala, barely a few hundred yards from their premises.

 Once commissioned in March, more than 5,000 passengers from across the city and its fringe areas will frequent the neighbourhood of the high-security zone. And security experts fear the area will turn into a ?free zone for burglars, snatchers and even terrorists?. 

 ?We presume that with so many people using the station, the crime rate will go up in the vicinity of the airport,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. ?We are chalking out a plan to counter all eventualities.?

 Last week, Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials had held a string of meetings with the top brass of police and the district administration, and also spoke to chief secretary Ashok Gupta.

 Police and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) have been assigned the task of maintaining security in and outside the airport.

 ?Our biggest worry is the number of roads leading to the airport. We have decided to plug a large number of entry and exit points,? said an official. With fewer roads leading to the airport, it?ll be easier for the securitymen to scan those entering the premises. 

 ?Few air passengers will avail of the Circular Railway, but several people can try to enter the zone after disembarking at the new station. We have to be extra-cautious and can?t take any chance,? said airport director Rajendra Pal.

 At one of the recent meetings, a senior official said: ?This is an international airport and we are always concerned about the security of the airfield, as well as its adjoining areas. To ensure safety of the passengers, we must ensure that not only is the airport out of bounds for rowdies and criminals, but the neighbourhood, too, is free of such elements.?

 The workload on the local police will also increase manifold, once the terminal station is thrown open to the public. 

 ?At present, we handle cases that are handed over to us by the CISF, such as forged passports or passengers caught with undeclared goods,? said D. Dutta, an officer at airport police station.

 According to officers, it will be tough on the police, as any trouble in the area will be considered a breach in the airport security shield. 

 ?It?s not just the terror threat we are concerned about,? said a police officer.

 ?Going by experience, the vicinity will be a happy hunting ground for snatchers, swindlers, pickpockets and other assorted criminals. Passengers coming to or leaving the airport will be soft targets,? he added.

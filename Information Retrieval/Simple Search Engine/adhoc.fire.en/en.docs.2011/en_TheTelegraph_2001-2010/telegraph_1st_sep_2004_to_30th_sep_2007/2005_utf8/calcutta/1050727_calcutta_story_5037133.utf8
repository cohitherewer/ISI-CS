 A few make-up tricks up your sleeve and you could steal the thunder at the next rain dance or breeze through a cocktail party without your kohl-lined eyes looking unnaturally smudged or be the cynosure of eyes at a private do without mascara dripping down your face.

 To combat the sultriness and unpredictability of the weather, one should keep a few basic points in mind that are quite easy to execute, says ace make-up artiste Aniruddha Chakladar. 

 He recommends the matte look for the season, ruling out anything with the slightest gloss.

 So, be it the eye-shadow, lipstick, blush-on or even the base, the matte effect is the way to be.

 As for the colours, shades symbolic of the season are always a good bet. However, its best not to overemphasise the dreariness of rainy days. Bright tones of blues, greens and aquamarines will be in sync with the monsoon mood.

 Chakladar draws up a list of dos and donts for the monsoons. 

 Base basics

 The lesser the better is the idea here with a non-water-based foundation and a dash of compact. A concealer can be used to hide blemishes and dark circles.

 Loose powder should be allowed only to blot the shine off your nose, as sparingly as possible. Powder on naked skin often ends up giving a chalky look. Shimmer powder is a good idea for giving your skin the much-needed glow in dreary days.

 Eye essentials

 Stash away the liquid liners this season and switch over to pencils instead.

 Good quality soft pencils not only add definition and shape to the eyes, they stay unaltered even after getting wet in the rain, says Chakladar. 

 Using black kohl to line your upper lid and shades of grey, brown or bronze on the lower lid can brighten up your eyes. 

 Cream-based eye-shadow is a good idea as it lends a glossy effect without running in the rain. Shades of brown, pink and beige are the hot hues this season. 

 As for mascara, you just cant get through these weeks without owning a water-proof one. While this will add the desired volume to the lashes, water-proof mascara is often difficult to remove. Hence, a good quality eye make-up remover is essential.

 Lip lustre

 Its time to lock up the dark midnight hues and opt for fresh pastels for the lips. The lip-liner is back this season and in a big way.

 The lip-liner plays an important role and not only in outlining the lips. You should ideally apply a coat of the lip-liner beneath the lipstick, advises Chakladar.

 While shopping for lipsticks, look for ones that claim to be long-lasting, colour-stay or transfer-resistant. Liquid lip colours are a strict no-no. 

 Blush-on bests

 Cream blush-ons can melt off the face and so its best to stick to powder formulas. Think sheer and pastels. 

 The golden rule while choosing a blush-on is to pick the shade that your cheeks turn when you have spent a few hours in the sun. These vary between pretty rose and bronze, depending on your skin tone, reveals the make-up artiste.

 Blend the blush-on outwards and make sure to apply it lightly. 

 Pack up

 Finally, before stepping out of the house, fill your bag with some essentials that could come in handy in case you have to do some damage control after being caught in a shower.

 The list should comprise lots of facial tissues, a wide-toothed comb to untangle wet hair, cleaning buds to wipe running eye make-up and vaseline.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Model moves

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 You can take a Bengali out of 

 Bengal, but not Bengal out of a Bengali. Indrani Dasgupta 

 was born and brought up in Muscat and is now based in Delhi. 

 But there is no keeping her away from her daily dose of 

 machh and mishti.

 I have stayed away from 

 Calcutta all my life. I come to this city only twice a year 

 to meet up with my folks. But I have a passion for all things 

 Bengali. I am a typical Bengali at heart, who lives to eat 

 and not vice versa, smiled the gorgeous gal on her 

 visit to the city on Saturday.

 She was in Calcutta to be part of the Hot and Haute Nite at Virgose, the restobar at Hotel Hindusthan International. But this lovely lady doesnt believe in sweating it out in the gym even after a binge in a sweetshop. People watch their weight, but I wait and watch. When I think my waistline is increasing, I omit food I should not consume.

 Indrani was in college when designer Ashish Soni approached her in a Delhi marketplace. After the initial inhibitions, she decided to give modelling a try. I was really na?ve about the industry without any background and know-how. But the adulation was tremendous. That is when I decided to stay in modelling, she recounted.

 The girl who completed her masters in economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University has been the brand ambassador of Lakme for the past four years. Bajaj and Allen Solly are her other major projects.

 But the ramp is where she rules. Walking the ramp gives me an instant kick. My height also works in my favour, said she.

 Acting is the last thing on her mind. Indrani is busy enjoying her honeymoon period in modelling. It is very obvious that every model will take to acting after she is through with modelling. But I would not like to do movies without a solid role. Making a guest appearance for two or three songs is not my idea of acting. But an item number is a possibility, because it helps create a niche in the movie amidst other stars.

 The ramp may be her second home, but shes not blind to some home truths. There are so many models but very few personalities, as most models lack a professional attitude towards work. Many treat modelling as a stepping stone and not as a full-fledged profession, she rued.

Trendy nooks for tots

Bunk beds, tree-houses, cartoons 

pamper little ones with their own fantasy land, says Himika Chaudhuri

A bed or a car? A bunk-bed or a tree-house? Designer 

digs can make any toddler?s dream come true, complete with Mickey Mouse on the 

walls and Spiderman on the bathroom tiles.

If you want to feed your child?s active imagination, 

create an environment nourishing and exciting enough to do the trick. Gone are 

the days when a kid?s room would find a hand-me-down old single cot and an heirloom 

reading table. 

Innovation in kid?s d?cor is leaving functionality 

behind in favour of fun and fantasy.

?Children today have a mind of their own, so they 

actually insist on being a part of the entire planning process,? says interior 

designer Manjari Sahay.

So, dressing up your child?s room with inputs from 

your little darling may turn out to be not just an exciting proposition, but an 

interactive one, too.

The basics 

?Bunk beds have always done well with children because 

it gives them a sense of adventure,? feels Sahay. But even though a bunk bed may 

be fun, it could turn into a nightmare if proper care isn?t taken while building 

and placing it.

?For one, the ladder leading to the top bunk should 

not be very steep to minimise the chance of injury,? adds interior designer Dipta 

Dasgupta. Putting bean bags or foam mattresses below the ladder of a bunk bed 

can act as a buffer in case the child takes a tumble.

Also, since the ceiling in most apartments is low, 

the bed has to be placed at a safe distance from the fan. 

The study table, display cabinets and computer tables 

are becoming very important for the kids of today. ?Children as young as three 

years ask for a computer nowadays,? smiles Sahay. While white wood furniture succeeds 

in bringing a light and young look to the room, to add that extra colour, brightly 

painted wooden planks might also be used.

While safety is key, durability may be expendable. 

?The furniture in a kid?s room need not be very heavy since the bed and study 

table usually have to be changed after a year or two and the furniture is not 

supposed to be for keeps,? feels Dasgupta. 

However temporary, care must be taken to ensure that 

the pieces don?t have sharp edges. ?Children will run around the room most of 

the time and must not be hit by sharp edges,? adds Sahay. 

Lights

?The lighting in a kid?s room has to be soothing,? 

stresses Sahay. Harsh and excessively bright lights are harmful for the eyes of 

a child and are best avoided. ?What I usually do while decking up a youngster?s 

room is put a focus light over the study table that would not hurt the eyes,? 

she explains. Reading lamps near the bed and nightlights are other fixtures that 

can brighten things up. 

Upholstery

Cotton is best for children. ?It might be difficult 

to maintain, and therefore a mixed fabric, which can be washed and cleaned more 

readily, is a good option,? observes Dasgupta. 

The colour scheme of the curtains, bed covers and 

cushions have to be in sync with the shade of the walls and the furniture. ?The 

common-sense technique is to go for light coloured upholstery if the walls are 

dark, but in a child?s room, one has to incorporate a colourful and fun element 

as well,? says Sahay. 

Funky prints with cartoons characters can be used 

till the age of six years (seen in the pictures above of the Mohanka residence 

in Ballygunge). For older children, bright colours like golden yellow, Barbie 

pinks and electric blues in smart designs like checks and stripes are ideal.

Walls

Choosing the colour of the walls is vital and must 

be done with the help of the room?s tiny inhabitants. ?Unless the child likes 

the basic colour of the walls, one can?t expect him or her to like staying in 

the room,? points out Dasgupta. 

Choosing a soothing colour is recommended since this 

makes it easier to coordinate the rest of the shade card. ?The walls should ideally 

be in light hues so that the room looks spacious, especially if it?s a small one,? 

adds Sahay. 

Painting favourite cartoon or fairy tale characters 

on the walls is a sure hit with most children.

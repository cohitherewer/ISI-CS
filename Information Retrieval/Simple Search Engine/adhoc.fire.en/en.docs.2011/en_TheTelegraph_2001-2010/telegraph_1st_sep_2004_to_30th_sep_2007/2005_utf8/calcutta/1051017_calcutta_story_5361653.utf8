The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green has lost its sheen

 FAIYAZ AHMED KHAN, mayoral council member (parks and gardens, and information and cultural affairs) met readers of The Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included Dipu Das, Sourish Misra, G. Laha, Jayanta Guha, Ejaz Ahmed, Tapan Adhikari, Shankar Ghosh, Sahiduddin Khan, Sandip Dasgupta, Mehboob Kader, A.K. Sinha and Sandip Banerjee

Dipu Das: Parks in the Kasba and Tiljala areas are in bad shape. For example, Salil Chaudhury Smriti Udayan, Manish Mitra Park and Picnic Park are nothing more than fenced enclosures. There are neither sitting arrangements for the elderly nor any kids? corners. A lot of people believe that your department only looks after parks that are well-maintained.

 I will soon visit parks in the Kasba and Tiljala areas. I have already inspected over 70 parks in the city and found that 90 per cent of them are in bad shape. Most are sanctuaries for alcoholics, gamblers and drug addicts.

 I want active participation of private companies, clubs, NGOs and civic councillors for the facelift of these parks. Please submit schemes for the development of the parks you mentioned.

Sourish Misra and Jayanta Guha: You are talking about beautification of parks and ways to make them more green. But at the same time, you are allowing pujas to be held in the parks.

 It is a fact that a beautified park resembles a burning ground after pujas. So, we have decided not to allow new pujas and functions to be held in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) parks.

 We have a plan to introduce two rules regarding holding of pujas in civic parks. The first rule will make it mandatory for the puja organisers to make a caution money deposit with the CMC. The sum will be used to undo any damage done to the park. The other rule will prevent the organisers from minting money by allowing people to set up stalls.

G.Laha: A temple has come up in Naren Sen Square on Sitaram Ghost Street. What are you doing?

 The so-called religious people find government and civic plots the fittest to construct temples and mosques. Have you ever seen anyone donate land to set up a place of worship for the common people?

Jayanta Guha: Manufacturers of reputed brands of soft drinks produce hazardous waste that should not be dumped in the Dhapa grounds. Where do industries dump their waste in the city?

 I will try to find our more about this from the conservancy department and pollution control board.

Sandip Banerjee: There used to be a public toilet in front of New BK Market on Shakespeare Sarani. Why can?t you construct a pay-and-use toilet there?

 It is a good suggestion.

Sahiduddin Khan: Indecent behaviour by young men and women in parks have made them no-go zones for families. Can?t you do something about this?

 There is a law against obscenity in public places. Police, too, keep an eye on such behaviour. But one must keep in mind that the definition of obscenity changes with time.

Sandip Dasgupta: You are the mayoral council member in charge of information and cultural affairs of the CMC. I want to know the fate of the proposed Chhabi Biswas Mancha on civic land, near Naktala post office, in the mayor?s ward. About a decade back, when Buddhadeb Bose was the CPM councillor of the area, a local club had raised funds for the Mancha by holding a charity show. The work was started, but no progress was subsequently made.

 I will request you to provide me documents relating to the Mancha. I must first determine whether the project was a civic one or that of the local club. Even if the club had taken the initiative, it must have obtained permission from the civic body. I will take up the matter once you make a formal request.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Whirlwind tour of the winners

 The final countdown to the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2005 began on Mahasaptami morning. A team of five judges visited the six pandals shortlisted from among 130 participants...

 The buzz around the True Spirit Puja grew louder this time ? in its third year ? with no less than 130 committees signing up. The list was whittled down to six after two days of extensive judging journey.

 On Mahasaptami, a panel of five judges ? artist Shuvaprasanna, quiz master Derek O?Brien, actress Pallavi Chatterjee, Concern for Calcutta president T.K. Gooptu and CESC executive director Santanu Bhattacharya ? set out to pick the puja that best fused festive feel with compassionate camaraderie.

 After a hurried breakfast at Bengal Club, the five set out for a whirlwind tour across town, the humidity hardly hampering the mood or the marks. Reshmi Sengupta accompanied the evaluation team.

 Stop I (Nandana Yuba Sangha, Behala): The fleet of cars wound its way into a narrow lane in Behala and halted at the pandal decorated with mats. The organisers had brought in around 1,900 craftsmen for the task.

 ?What will you do with the mats after the Pujas?? asked Derek. ?We will distribute them among the needy,? replied one of the organisers. ?But these are highly combustible materials, what precautions have you taken?? asked Shuvaprasanna, who was then shown all the fire-safety measures. Pallavi checked out the live demonstration of mat-making.

 Stop II (Behala Club): The quaint structure with a rusty texture bowled over all judges. The mandap was made of terracotta slabs; the entrance and the path decorated with Worli artwork, a tribal craft form of Maharashtra. ?The craft has been used even on the bamboo pillars that support the pandal. The ambience is also just right,? observed Shuvaprasanna.

 Among the various measures, the puja committee had worked out electrical arrangements in three separate phases and a mini-pond. ?There is also enough space for a big crowd to walk in,? added Pallavi, as the numbers swelled to watch the actress try her hand at the dhak.

 Stop III (Behala Agradut Club): ?It?s back to roots everywhere,? remarked Derek, as he walked into the third puja done up with terracotta. Pandal-hoppers waiting at the gate also rushed in to rub shoulders with the judges.

 The newness at Agradut Club was the array of diya and dhunuchi that ran through the entire curve of the pandal. Small decorative lights in the earthen vessels had replaced the wicks. ?The use of dhunuchi is very innovative,? observed Pallavi. The judges cautioned the organisers against some loose wires dangling at the back of the pandal.

Stop IV (41 Pally, Haridevpur): Red earth dominated this pandal tucked away in the tail-end of Tollygunge. Figurines carved out on terracotta panels adorned the walls of the pandal, while the goddess and her entourage showed off tribal features. ?What do you plan to do with the terracotta slabs?? inquired Shuvaprasanna. The artwork would be preserved, said one of the organisers. This pandal too had adequate arrangements for the physically challenged. 

 ?It?s also good that all these pandals have proper electrical arrangements,? observed Bhattacharya of CESC.

 Stop V (Ajeya Sanghati, Haridevpur): A blue fa?ade welcomed pandal-hoppers to this puja designed as a spaceship, with the idols stationed against a blue backdrop. ?The space inside the pandal is barely adequate for a crowd and it?s a bit suffocating too,? said Pallavi.

Stop VI (Maniktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty): The last stop at the far end of town had won the True Spirit trophy last year. This time, the spotlight was on jute work by artisans from Midnapore. 

 On the safety front, there was even an ambulance. ?The pandal is beautiful and so is the idol. But there is little synergy between the two,? observed Shuvaprasanna. 

 ?There were new ideas but the true spirit was also evident everywhere,? signed off Gooptu of Concern for Calcutta. 

 At the end of it all, the judges returned to Bengal Club to add up scores and announce the awards.

 Ado over shop theft

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two jewellery shops were looted at Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city, late on Monday. The booty was about Rs 40 lakh in cash and jewellery. Till late on Tuesday, police failed to make any breakthrough. 

 The dacoities have created a flutter among local businessmen and they have set police 48 hours to recover the stolen items and arrest the criminals. Otherwise, they have threatened to agitate in front of Baruipur police station. 

 The dacoits cut open the shutters to enter the shops. They broke open the iron safe and fled with the jewellery and cash. The shops are located in a marketplace and police are supposed to be on patrol duty. 

 Local Trinamul Congress MLA Arup Bhadra said the recurrence of such incidents proved that law and order of the area has deteriorated. 

 Additional superintendent of police A.K.Prasad said a hunt was underway and arrests were imminent.

 Drool over dhaba delights

 A dhaba is not a hot hangout if you are looking for the cool environs of a coffee shop. Not everybody has the stomach for chicken on the oven, sarson da saag, makke di roti, kulhars of lassi and folding cots far from genteel surroundings.

 But the dhabas we know (and frequent), these days (or rather nights) are dhabas with a difference. They do retain their rundown (and often filthy) look inside, but outside they have managed to create a world of Honda Citys and Hero Hondas, a devoted clientele that demands its dinner ? or chai/coffee ? on wheels.

 Cosy couples out for their last cuppa, families out for a budget meal, friends out for a spin, party people out for the final fling before bedtime?. There?s something for everyone at the unlikeliest of hip hangouts.

 Goodlife stops at one of the oldest and most crowded dhabas in the city to find out what makes it tick, with old and young, humble and happening.

 Flashback

This pre-Independence dhaba was established 

in the late 1930s. ?The place belonged to my maternal grandfather. He gave it 

to my father when he was on his deathbed,? recounts Lakhvinder Singh. ?We have 

just continued to keep up the quality and share a very good rapport with our customers.?

 Tea time

You can take your first sip as early as 3 in the morning. 

?Though it is not the rush hour, we have some regulars who finish their work and 

head home after having their tea here. After all, there are so many people who 

work late into the night,? says Manish Singh, representing the fourth generation 

of the family manning the dhaba. 

 The peak time is from 6.30 am to 8.30 am. Closure time is either midnight or 1 am, depending on crowds.

Popular pick

Tea, of course. For many, the day just refuses to 

begin without a refreshing sip of the special chai sold here. ?From the 

start, tea has been the main draw,? says Manish, Lakhvinder?s nephew. The magic 

potion is prepared with tea leaves in a cloth pouch, boiled in steaming water. 

Once the liquor is extracted, the tea leaves are discarded. After adding milk 

to the liquor, the blend is poured into a utensil and then transferred to a larger 

vessel with hot water. At no point is the beverage directly exposed to the flames. 

?This helps retain the actual flavour of the tea and is hygienic too,? explains 

Manish. 

 Price tag: Rs 4, Rs 7 and Rs 14. 

 Tea turnover: Thousand-plus kulhars a day.

 Food fare

If tea rules the mornings, some lip-smacking food 

fare goes down well in the evenings. ?The place might be synonymous with good 

tea, but we also have some delicious vegetarian fare, added to the menu for just 

over a decade,? says Manish.

 Chinese Samosa, Tomato Vada, Paneer Cutlet, Paneer Pakoda, Gobi Pakoda, Gulab Jamun and Imriti are the hot favourites as starters.

 Price tag: Rs 2 to Rs 10.

 The gravy train consists of Dal Tarka, Dal Makhani, Palak Cream, Kaju Paneer, Vegetable Begum Bahar, Kashmiri and Gujarati Alu Dum, Alu Do Pyaza, Paneer Do Pyaza, Vegetable Do Pyaza, Vegetable Korma, Navratan Korma?

 Price tag: Rs 15 to Rs 60.

 The roti range reads Makke Di Roti, Butter Tandoori Roti, Lachhedar Paratha, Garlic Naan, Masala Naan, Missi Roti and Masala Kulcha.

 Price tag: Rs 3 to Rs 35.

 Secret of success

Balwant Singh?s Eating House just keeps growing in 

popularity, purely through word-of-mouth publicity. But why? ?The main ingredient 

for success is the tremendous loyalty of the customers and the fame this dhaba 

enjoys because of them. The reputation was not built overnight. There are 

people who have been coming here for decades now,? says Manish.

 Star trek

From KL Saigal to Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar to Kareena 

Kapoor, the celebrity line stopping over at this Harish Mukherjee Road-Elgin Road 

address for chai has been long and lustrous. ?Then there?s Daler Mehndi 

who comes here with his entire troupe every time he is in town,? smiles Manish.

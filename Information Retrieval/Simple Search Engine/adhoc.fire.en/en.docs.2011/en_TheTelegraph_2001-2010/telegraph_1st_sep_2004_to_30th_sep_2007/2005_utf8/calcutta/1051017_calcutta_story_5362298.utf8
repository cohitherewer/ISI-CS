The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

The name?s Bond...

...James Bond. The line has remained the same from 1962. 

The man mouthing it has changed, for better or for worse. Metro lists the 

super six whove slipped into the worlds most famous tuxedo

DYE ANOTHER DAY: The six-ft, 37-year-old Englishman 

is not only the shortest Bond but DANIEL CRAIG is also slated to be the first 

Goldielocks 007. His CV is kind of shaken and stirred, best known as Paul Newman?s 

sinister screen-son in Sam Mendes?s Road To Perdition. Apart from earning 

the new responsibility of thwarting a dangerous Russian spy from winning a no-limit 

Texas Holdem game of poker worth millions in the 21st Bond film Casino Royale, 

Craig will be seen in Steven Spielberg?s Munich, Nicole Kidman?s Invasion 

of the Body Snatchers remake The Visiting, and Gwyneth Paltrow?s Truman 

Capote drama Have You Heard?

BOND WITH THE BEST: Debates still rage 

whether SEAN CONNERY (left) or PIERCE BROSNAN (below) best fitted the shoes of 

007. Connery, who started it all with Dr. No in 1962, very much defined 

the screen avatar of the Ian Fleming creation and continued to nurture and refine 

it till Never Say Never Again in 1983. Brosnan, on the other hand, upped 

Bond?s commercial success with his four films ? Golden Eye, Tomorrow 

Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day ? raking 

in $ 1.5 billion of the total $ 4 billion booty that Bond movies have fetched 

in their four decades at the box-office. 

MOORE?S LAST SIGH: You can love him or hate him but 

you can?t ignore the man who brought a comic quirkiness to the secret agent. ROGER 

MOORE (right) hung on to the Bond bandwagon for 12 years and seven films, finally 

appearing in A View To A Kill as a 57-year-old veteran.

STOP-GAP: The 007 tux got a little tight 

for these two gentlemen who found it tough to repeat the success of Connery and 

Moore. The youngest Bond at 30, GEORGE LAZENBY (left) had just one outing in the 

1969 film On Her Majesty?s Secret Service. TIMOTHY DALTON (below) was rumoured 

to be the next James Bond as far back as the late 1960s, but could only order 

his martini at 44 in the 1987 film The Living Daylights. The tallest Bond 

boy (at six-ft-two-inches) also appeared in Licence To Kill in 1989.

 Cant beat Bappi beat

 Rings on all 10 fingers, half-a-dozen gold chains round his neck and a pile of bangles on his wrists? No prizes for guessing who trundled into town on Saturday.

 Chalte chalte, De de pyar de, I am a disco dancer? Bappi Lahiris contribution to film music in the 70s and 80s cannot be ignored. The first one to create the Disco din and use the techno sound, he ruled the music charts then.

 In the 1990s he went into oblivion with romance becoming the rage in films. But the man behind hits like Kaliyon ka chaman and Kaanta laga is hopeful that his genre of music would make a comeback ? soon.

 The hit songs of today are forgotten within a couple of months. But the music I created 30 years back is being remixed over and over again and then presented to people. The reason being there is still demand for those beats and grooves, says Bappida, in Calcutta for the Channel [V] Karaoke night on Saturday. 

 Of late, his work on celluloid has been nothing to write home about. He has composed for two sleaze sagas, Bold and Classic: Dance of Love. Whats that? Please dont ask us.

 He is pinning his hopes on the soon-to-be-released Dev Anand-directed Mr Prime Minister. I have tried to compose the songs keeping the youngsters in mind. I have also composed a peppy number for Remix on STAR One.

 But why is the Bappida look more talked about than the music? The makeover happened alongside music. I quite admire Michael Jackson and we started our musical career during the same era. Over the years I think he has influenced me, admits Bappi.

 I like jewellery and try to wear all that can be worn.

 Now, only the mangalsutra is missing.

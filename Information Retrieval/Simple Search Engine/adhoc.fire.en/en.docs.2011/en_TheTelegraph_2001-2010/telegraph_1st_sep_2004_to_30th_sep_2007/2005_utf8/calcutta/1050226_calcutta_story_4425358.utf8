The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beam block talks fail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The cable conflict on the network of multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable moved a step closer to switch-off on Friday as talks between STAR, Sony, Indian Cable Net and SitiCable failed to find a solution.

 Matters reached the Capital as SitiCable filed a petition with the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal, seeking a stay on a possible switch-off. No decision was reached and the next hearing is scheduled for Monday.

 ?SitiCable filed a case and tried to get a decision, but the court refused a stay order since the matter concerns pilferage of unauthorised signal,? said a spokesperson for Indian Cable Net, which doubles as the distributor for the STAR and Sony bouquet of channels in town.

 STAR and Sony have threatened to block beam on Calcutta Communications, a unit of SitiCable, on ?charges of piracy?.

 According to sources, officials of the broadcasters and MSOs were locked in a six-hour meeting but failed to settle the issues. They are to meet again on Saturday morning.

 During discussions on Friday, STAR and Sony pressed charges against Calcutta Communications, accusing it of misreporting connection numbers and not declaring a section of operators under it. 

 SitiCable countered that some of the operators the broadcasters claimed were unaccounted for, were in fact, sub-operators working under other cable operators.

 Various operators? forums are also trying to defuse the situation, which is likely to result in a cable blackout affecting around 2.5 lakh city homes.

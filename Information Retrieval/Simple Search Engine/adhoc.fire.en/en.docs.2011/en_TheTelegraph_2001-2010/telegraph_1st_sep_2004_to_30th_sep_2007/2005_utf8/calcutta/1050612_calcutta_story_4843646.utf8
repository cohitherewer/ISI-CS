 Fill up your shopping bag at quaint 

 little shops in Karigaar Haat, take a break to catch a puppet 

 show, soak up the Rajasthani village ambience aided by chillas, 

 chaats and chutney, catch a movie on the biggest 

 screen in town? And still have loads left to do.

 Swabhumi, the Heritage Plaza, 

 which turned four on February 17 this year, is not your 

 typical mall. Swabhumi is different from other malls 

 both in concept and design. It was conceptualised with a 

 view of providing a heritage spot on the list of every Calcuttan. 

 It is particularly charming to the tourist who gets a glimpse 

 of the culture of the country under one roof, says 

 a spokesperson for the destination off the Bypass.

 Here, tribal artefacts make up 

 for the absence of designer labels and desi khana scores 

 over international cuisine. Goodlife takes you on 

 a heritage high?

 Address: 89C Narkeldanga 

 Main Road.

 Time: Noon to 8 pm.

 Footfall: The winter months 

 see a footfall of anything between 4,500 and 5,500 everyday. 

 The numbers shrink to 2,000 or 3,000 per day in the summer 

 months. 

 Work smith: Trek through 

 Karigaar Haat, a make-believe hamlet in the heart of the 

 Heritage Plaza, where artisans display their wares. While 

 Md Salim from Uttar Pradesh is busy turning a block of wood 

 into a beer bottle stand or a bookshelf, two pavement-dwellers 

 selling jute chappals attract feminine feet in large 

 numbers.

 If you want to furnish your house 

 with ethnic goodies, stop by Sensitive Creations. From clocks 

 to wall hangings, masks to chimes, here, everything is terracotta, 

 created at a small workshop in Thakurnagar, North 24-Parganas. 

 The knickknacks come as cheap as Rs 30 and can go up to 

 Rs 3,000. 

 Dame domain: If you are 

 looking for payals and pendants, Meena Bazaar 

 is for you. Whether shopping for your best friends 

 wedding or just hoarding some junk jewellery, you can do 

 so in a budget ranging from Rs 5 to Rs 500. 

 Urban Court: If you require 

 a breather after running through the shops at Karigaar Haat 

 or escorting your girlfriend through Meena Bazaar, let your 

 hair down at the Urban Courtyard. This place is always crowded 

 with people. Lay your hands on paintings, modern ensembles 

 and well-crafted jewellery. 

 Cha, adda, etc: 

 Though the Heritage Plaza does not boast swank eateries 

 and varied cuisine, a bite or a cup of tea or coffee can 

 be had in plenty. If time is not an issue, sit down for 

 adda at Adda, the teashop or Cha Ghar, a stall tucked 

 away in a cosy corner. Adda serves a variety of teas ranging 

 from masala to fruity flavours. The Cha Ghar sells 

 the usual variety in kullhars, and a range of flavoured 

 popcorn.

 Aangan, the speciality restaurant 

 serves Rajasthani food in enchanting environs. True to the 

 name, the restaurant has an aangan, or a courtyard, 

 with a mandir and a chaat counter. If you 

 want to have a full meal, there is an enclosed, air-conditioned 

 area where typical Rajasthani food in served. The mall itself 

 started with four food courts namely Dakshini, Uttara, Paschima 

 and Purba. At present only Paschima and Dakshini are operational, 

 serving the southern and western cuisine. 

 Movie magic: After traversing 

 the mall, hop next door to the cool environs of 89 Cinemas 

 to catch the latest flick. Our place is easily accessible 

 and safe, the seating arrangement is comfortable and the 

 pricing of tickets and food and beverage is competitive. 

 We also boast the biggest screen in the city, says 

 Prashant Shrivastav, general manager of the multiplex.

 Moviegoers can look forward to 

 a lot of add-ons in the near future. A pool table and a 

 small basketball court for the kids are on the cards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fewer seats, yet no dearth 

 - HS high-performers leave in bulk for greener pastures

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 There is good news for those who have passed their Higher Secondary (HS) in 2005 with second-division marks and are uncertain about getting berths in city colleges.

 Larger numbers of high-performers in HS have reportedly gone to other states to pursue undergraduate courses this year, making it easier for the comparatively low-performers to manage a seat in the city?s top and middle-ranking colleges, according to Calcutta University, that reviewed the ongoing admission procedures in its 110-odd affiliated colleges in Calcutta proper.

 There was an indication that the demand for seats in most affiliated colleges of Calcutta University will be higher this year, as the number of examinees who passed HS with a first division has risen by about 10,000, against last year?s figures.

 ?We have monitored the admissions in most colleges during the past week. Since there has been a considerable rise in the number of first divisions in HS, we expected the demand for seats in honours courses to be higher this time. Surprisingly, the seats crisis is not very acute in any college,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of Calcutta University.

 A quick investigation by the university revealed that larger numbers of students ? among those who passed in the first division ? have been accommodated in private engineering colleges, and a bulk of them has gone to other states to pursue courses in emerging areas, such as biotechnology, molecular biology and biochemistry, not available in most Calcutta colleges.

 ?There was bound to be a dearth of seats if we had to accommodate a bulk of the 10,000 more students who have scored first division marks to the BA, B.Sc and B.Com honours courses,? said a senior university officer monitoring the colleges admissions.

 According to him, the university feared an acute shortage of seats more because of the recent decision of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) which, as a part of its nationwide drive to maintain a proper student-teacher ratio in private and government engineering colleges, slashed nearly 1,400 seats in Bengal this year. 

 Thereafter, the total number of seats in engineering courses has dropped to nearly 11,600 this year from 13,000 last year.

Treasure trove 

 Traditionally, St Xavier?s College, Calcutta, housed the oldest library in the heart of the city, unknown to most Calcuttans. Situated above the main chapel, it has some of the most valuable collection of books, periodicals, paintings, antiques and curios, which Archbishop Paul Goethal bequeathed to St Xavier?s College when he was the archbishop of Calcutta way back in 1886-1901. The library has a collection of approximately 18,800 book-plates, periodicals, journals and manuscripts.

 The collection of rare books is classified into 61 categories. The sections range from Ancient Travels, Modern Indian History, Biographies, Folklore, Flora, Fauna, Meteorology, Classical Language and Literature, Archaeology, Architecture, Epigraphy, Education, Religion, Philosophy, Missions of India and Abroad, Law, Medicine, Anthropology and even books on other countries.

The Goethal?s Library?s rare documents include Indian travelogues in the 16th and 17th Centuries, the Bengal Mission before and after 1800, documents, photos and archival material on St Xavier?s School and College, writings of Brahmabandhav Upadhyay, Animananda and others. 

 The Goethal?s Indian Library is truly a treasure trove of Indological knowledge. It is open from 9 am to 4 pm on weekdays. For more details, log on to www.goethals.org, or email goethalsvsnl.com.

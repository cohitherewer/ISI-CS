 Kin exempt from hearings

 - Defence team ends grilling of Rajnis Patel?s ailing mother

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES

 The court of the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) on Tuesday exempted Manoj and Munni Patel, parents of Rajnis Patel, from appearing for subsequent hearings in the case concerning their son?s death. 

 The defence finished cross-examining Munni Devi on the day. The court also observed that the five accused doctors had already been identified and need not be present.

 The Patels charged the doctors with negligence following Rajnis? death at SSKM Hospital in 2003 after multiple surgeries failed to set right a broken shinbone. 

 Appearing before the court for the 32nd hearing of the case, an ailing Munni Devi was tearful but solemn as she negated the defence submissions.

 Advocate Asish Kumar Khan, representing accused doctor Souvik Bardhan, continued his cross-examination. 

 He was stopped by Dipit Basu, representing accused doctor Dilip K. Majumdar, who wanted to challenge two allegations levelled by the witness that had been overlooked by his colleague, Amitabha Ganguly, on Monday.

 Khan objected, saying that Basu could not interrupt him while he was cross-examining witnesses, prompting public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh to protest, too. 

 The court directed counsel Basu to file a petition.

 For the rest of the 30-minute hearing, Khan concentrated on why the Patels had delayed their statement to the police. He insinuated that between June 3, 2003, when the first information report was registered with Bhowanipore police station, and June 20, 2003, when the police first recorded the Patels? statements, they had been tutored to include the names of the four accused doctors apart from Majumdar. 

 Munni Devi steadfastly stuck to her version.

 Before the hearing was adjourned for the day, Khan requested the court to defer the remaining hearings, instead of scheduling them on subsequent dates.

 ?Let?s carry on till Friday, then we will decide,? SDJM Manjit Singh said.

 ?We are not required to appear in court any more, but there is nothing else to do, so we?ll come to witness the course of justice,? Manoj Patel said after the hearing.

 ?I have been ill over the past few days, but the thought of missing a hearing did not cross my mind even once,? Munni Devi said.

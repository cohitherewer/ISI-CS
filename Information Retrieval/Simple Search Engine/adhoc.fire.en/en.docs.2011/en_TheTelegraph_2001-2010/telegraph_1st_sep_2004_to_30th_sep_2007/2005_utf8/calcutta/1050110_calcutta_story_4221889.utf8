The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without?

Forgetting about New Year resolutions

 Still holding on to that noble resolve? It?s 

more than a week since that rockin? New Year?s Eve, and nobody?s expecting you 

to live on the memories for one full year. You can be sure even your partner who 

gleaned that goody two-shoe promise out of you is dying to kick off those heels! 

Get the best of both worlds by arriving at a compromise of doing it in moderation 

instead. In fact, the middle path is the only road that runs the longest.

Getting flexi gear for the fickle weather

 The off-on winter game looks here to stay for 

the rest of its fleeting duration in the city, piling on your problem of deciding 

upon a suitable dress code every morning. How about taking the sun by its rays 

and getting yourself some custom-made gear instead? A peel-off jacket is an idea 

we can?t get rid of. A thick padding on a light jacket that can be strapped on 

and off depending on the mercury?s temper is one way. Now how you get it done 

is your problem, of course!

Going Black

 Oops, not yet, but the promos are definitely 

worth a dekho. A stunning montage of images, where every frame breathes 

and touches you, the film?s teaser has been the buzzword of tinsel town ever since 

it was beamed on the small screen. Whether it is Amitabh Bachchan?s piercing gaze 

or Rani Mukherjee?s innocent smile or the sheer depth of director Sanjay Leela 

Bhansali?s canvas, Black demands total viewing ? from the 30-second trailer 

to the full-length movie coming early-Feb.

Packing for a picnic

 Just the weather to feel the wind in your hair 

and sunshine on your shoulders? More so after being cooped up in the smoky dens 

through the last few nights of the year that was. A day in the greens is also 

the best antidote to the mother of all hangovers the die-hards are still likely 

to nurse. 

Finding a date...

 ...before the wedding season is through. Well 

yes, it?s on till mid-March, but then it takes time for caterpillars in the stomach 

to take wings into the butterfly effect. There aren?t any singles? bars around 

so all the losers can do is log on to dating and matrimonial sites to pick the 

best bet from the matrimony menu. Yeah, you can?t get hooked if they don?t drop 

a line, but at least you can get rid of that sinking feeling in anticipation, 

when your best buddy bites the dust this season.

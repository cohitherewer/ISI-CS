 Seafood enthusiasts can finally sink their teeth into a food festival dedicated in its honour at the Palm Court of Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI), on till February 13.

 ?Seafood has many advantages over other cuisines. Fresh seafood is an excellent source of proteins, minerals and vitamins. It is also low in fat, cholesterol and sodium. That is the reason we decided to hold a seafood festival before winter comes to an end,? says executive chef Utpal Mondal.

 In the savoury soup segment, the mouth-watering Tom Yam Gung (Prawn Soup) and Fisherman Trotter (Mixed Sea Food Broth) must be tried. Both are priced at Rs 145. Starters include delicacies like Fried Calamari with Cajun Spices and Dips and Malwani Fried Prawns. These are priced a tad steeper, between Rs 295 and Rs 445. 

 Coming to the main courses, the chef recommends the Roasted Salmon Steaks on Chilli Chive Potatoes with Caper Butter Sauce, the Black Ink Risotto with Baby Octopus and the must-try Scampi and Oyster Preened on Vegetables. These are all priced at Rs 375.

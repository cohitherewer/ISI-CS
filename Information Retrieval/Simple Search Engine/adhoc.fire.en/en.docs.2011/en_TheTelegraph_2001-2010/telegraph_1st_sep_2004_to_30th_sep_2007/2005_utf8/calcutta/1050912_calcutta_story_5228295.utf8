 On the super trail

 He is Supervision, with X-ray sight and fire breath. She is Supersonic, with a high-pitched voice to blast enemies. 

 Calcutta knows them as Tracy Chen of Class VII, La Martiniere for Girls, and Harshvardhan Agarwal of Class VI, Laxmipat Singhania Academy. The two are among the six kids chosen from among 65,000 entries received nationwide for Cartoon Network?s Powerpuff Generation Hunt. 

 ?The six kids will be the first live anchors on the channel who will host new episodes of The Powerpuff Girls, starting on September 14 at 6 pm,? said Abha Talwar, channel spokesperson, who flew down to Calcutta to introduce the city?s two ?superheroes?.

 In the contest, the children had to write about the one superpower they would like to have and how they would use it to improve the world. ?I hate to see poor people. So at the snap of the fingers, I want to give them food. I also hate criminals. So at a double snap, I want to fly wherever I want to fight them,? said Harsh. Doesn?t his hero Alpha Man resemble Goopi Gyne and Bagha Byne? Harsh has not watched the Satyajit Ray movie, but he remembers a play along similar lines. A cop?s profession does not inspire him. ?They always reach after the crime.? Tracy wants to fight for world peace.

 If Alpha Man?s power comes from a piece of meteor he picked up, Tracy?s Powergirl draws her power from a pink potion produced by her mother. ?I love Blossom among the Powerpuff girls. She wears pink,? the bubbly girl chirped.

 Her ?supermom? Wendy was at hand to speak of her daughter. ?She is a happy child with a finger in every pie ? from cultural shows during Saraswati puja to Christmas skits.? Harsh stays busy as well, with a voice much in demand in school. ?He is a great anchor and does riyaz every day,? mentioned mother Anju. 

 The two are good in studies, too. ?I have seen friends cry after doing badly. So I am scared of bad results,? reasons Harsh, who had come straight from the exam hall. Tracy?s exams start on September 26 and she is not nervous. After all, during the shooting in Mumbai, they have already donned the ?super? costumes ? emblazoned with a V (Supervision) and an S (Supersonic).

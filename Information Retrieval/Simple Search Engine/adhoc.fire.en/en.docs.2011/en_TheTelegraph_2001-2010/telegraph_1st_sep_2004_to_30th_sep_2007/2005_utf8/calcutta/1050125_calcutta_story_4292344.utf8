 Puppet trick to profess passion

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 If you are cute guy without much of a sense of humour, 

it?s about time you spruced up your act (or borrowed a gag), for Valentine?s Day 

is not so far away. If you don?t have a date as yet (and it could have something 

to do with your stoneface, mister) try approaching a woman with a hand puppet 

doing the talking ? and laughing ? for you. If you can walk the puppet?s talk, 

just watch her smile and (maybe) swoon.

It?s up to you to take it forward from there, but 

first break the ice with the joker hand puppets available in most Archies outlets 

around town (picture by Rashbehari Das). The one to two-ft figures come in four 

bright colours of green, orange, yellow and purple. The body is made of cloth 

while the face is made of ceramic. Rosy cheeks, bulbous nose, top hat and patchwork 

attire make them utterly loveable.

 A small wooden stick helps to jiggle it up and down depending on whether you want a giggle or a guffaw!

 If the joker option is not good enough for you, go ahead and make your own puppet to impress them double with your craft skills. Once you get the hang of it, you can create any figure under the sun, but a bunny or a chicken puppet is good to start off with.

For a bunny you?ll need two white felt sheets and scraps of pink and black. Arm yourself with glue, scissors and straight pins. 

 Draw a body pattern of a bunny, place two sheets of white felt for body, one on top of the other and place a pattern piece on top. Pin the pattern to sheets of felt using straight pins. Pins must go through both sheets and all pieces must be fairly flat once pinned. Cut along pattern edge to form body pieces. In addition, cut out the following pieces: two black half-inch circles for pupils, four white one-inch circles for cheeks and eyes, one white 0.75 x 0.5-inch rectangle for teeth (also cut a small slit for teeth gap), one pink half-inch oval for nose, two pink 1.75 x 0.60-inch ovals for inside of ears, two pink 0.75-inch circles and six pink 0.25-inch circles for paws. 

 Run the glue along the edge of one entire bunny body piece, except the bottom edge. Place the second bunny body piece on top and press gently to stick on. Glue all other pieces on to the bunny body and let dry.

 For the other puppet, you need two sheets of yellow felt and scraps of white, orange and black. Draw a chicken pattern, which includes the body, beak and feet. Place two sheets of yellow felt one on top of the other and place the pattern piece on top. Pin the pattern to the felt sheets and cut along pattern edge to form body pieces. Follow the same procedure for the feet and beak on one layer of orange felt. In addition, cut out two black 0.50-inch felt rounds for pupils and two one-inch white felt circles for eyes. 

 Use the same procedure as in the bunny puppet to stick together all the pieces and let dry. 

 The patterns also make colourful decoration around the house, especially in the children?s bedroom (if your puppet trick clicks, that is).

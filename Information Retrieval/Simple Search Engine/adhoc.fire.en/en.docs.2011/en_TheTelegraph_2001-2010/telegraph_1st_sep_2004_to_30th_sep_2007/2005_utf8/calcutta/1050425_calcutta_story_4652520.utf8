 Key exam posts at college

 - Controller amp; deputy to oversee postgraduate courses

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 After being granted the status of a centre of excellence by the University Grants Commission last year, Presidency College will soon take on the responsibility of controlling postgraduate courses offered in state-run colleges.

 The state government is planning to create the posts of controller and deputy controller of examinations at Presidency College. As of now, no other undergraduate college in the state has a post of controller of examinations.

 Sources said the officials holding the two posts will oversee examination procedure in the postgraduate level conducted by five state-run colleges under Calcutta University where postgraduate courses are offered. 

 The five colleges are Presidency, Maulana Azad, Lady Brabourne, Goenka and Bidhannagar College. Presidency alone runs postgraduate courses in nine subjects, the highest among all other affiliates of Calcutta University.

 All the five colleges have been granted autonomous powers, which authorise them to frame their own syllabi for the postgraduate courses as well. The degree is awarded jointly by the respective college and Calcutta University.

 Government officials say the move to create the two posts at Presidency is aimed at enabling the institution, and the other state-run colleges, to efficiently handle the increased load of administrative work, particularly that of holding postgraduate examinations.

 The necessity to create the posts was first felt by teachers of the colleges. ?More undergraduate colleges will have to introduce postgraduate courses in the coming years,? said Subrata Lahiri, a senior teacher of Presidency and leader of West Bengal Government College Teachers? Association.

 ?Though the colleges offering postgraduate courses enjoy the powers to determine their own syllabi and examination system, we need to ensure that a uniform examination pattern is maintained. The appointment of the controller of examinations will help us ensure this,? Lahiri explained.

 Presently, the post of controller of examinations exists only for universities and education bodies like the state college service commission, where holding of centralised examinations is a major activity. 

 ?Before we give the final clearance to the proposal, we will have to discuss the matter at various levels in the government,? said S. Sarkar, director of public instruction.

 Laurels for child auteurs 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Eleven-year-olds Saiful Mondal and Ashikul Islam are set to win their maiden national awards after two international prizes for best documentary film ? in Athens last year and in Naples a few weeks ago.

 The Union human resources ministry announced on Sunday that Ashikul and Saiful have been chosen by the selection committee for national child awards for ?exceptional achievements? in the field of film direction and cinematography, respectively. 

 Their names had been recommended for the awards by the state government. 

 ?We have received a written communication from the joint secretary of the human resources department. It is a great honour for the two children, who, till a few years back, did not even have a shelter,? said Swapan Mukherjee, secretary of the Centre for Communication and Development. 

 The centre runs the home Muktoneer, where the two reside with 40 other children.

 Apart from a cash reward of Rs 5,000, the two children will receive a silver medal, a citation and a certificate, in all probability from the President of India. 

 ?The dates have not yet been fixed, but it seems that the programme will either be on August 15 or November 14. We are ecstatic at the development,? Mukherjee added.

 In 2004, Saiful and his friends from Muktoneer had won hearts with Ami. 

 They repeated their success in 2005 with their second venture Aamra. 

 Both films won awards at the prestigious Kids for Kids International Film Festival. 

 While Ami was all about life as seen by children, Aamra deals with wildlife preservation.

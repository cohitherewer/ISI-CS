 Ambitious plans to change and modernise the cityscape, shopping malls and multiplexes, roaring real estate and a completely new-look culinary scenario are signs of the times. And often the spirit and energy behind these projects are those of young and dynamic entrepreneurs who have had to hear unencouraging and pessimistic words even from well-wishers before going ahead nonetheless. Also a sign of the times.

 Such is the case with a sprawling, well-designed, nine-outlet food court occupying 9,000 sq ft of space at a multiplex called The Metropolis at Hiland Park on the Eastern Bypass, a few km south of the Ruby Hospital roundabout. The two young men most actively involved in running this business are in their early thirties. They have called the food court Yo Foodies; the logo is a lively one with a big tongue as part of it, reminiscent of the logo for Rolling Stones Records. The young man who oversees the kitchens is also in his thirties, an engineer by qualification, who, like his business partners, took a chance and followed his passion for culinary creations. Their motto is fun food family and just five months down the line it is clear that they are making a go of it.

 Of the nine outlets, as many as six produce the food live, in front of the customers, inviting their inputs as regards toppings, fillings, sauces, seasonings and other ingredients. Hygiene and presentation are priorities and they are ready to innovate.

 For example, a delicious dish I had was from their pasta counter ? Fusilli in Arabiatta Sauce, which is a tomato-based sauce quite simply made. Chopped onions and garlic are sauteed in olive oil; tomato puree is added, then vinegar, lime juice, seasonings and herbs such as oregano and basil. The pasta was served in this sauce with pieces of chicken salami in it. 

 However, you can choose shrimps or chicken sausages instead and vegetarians can choose between corn, olives, mushrooms or jalapeno chillies, or a combination of these.

 There is also Penne Pasta in Cheese Sauce which was served to us with chicken salami and red and yellow bell peppers. This cheese sauce is also easy to make. Refined flour is browned in an equal volume of butter; milk is added, stirring all the time and when the required consistency is reached, grated cheese is stirred in and the sauce is allowed to stand, off the heat. 

 Herbs used are oregano and parsley and here also there is a choice of ingredients the customer can mix and match. The balance between the pasta and the sauce in both dishes was right. They were neither too dry nor drowned in sauce and the flavours were robust and full.

 Pastas and pizzas are served from the same outlet, as are some time-tested continental classics such as Fish/Veg Florentine, Chicken Tetrazini, Mutton Crumb Chops and Fish Chips.

 Mr Jiffy is the name of their fast-food outlet for sandwiches, burgers etc, and two most interesting items for me were Chicken Tikka Rumali Wrap and Mutton Sheekh Rumali Wrap. Healthy doses of kebab moistened with chutney and mayonnaise are neatly wrapped in freshly-made rumali roti ? a novel idea which is probably a first in the city. They are not like rolls, because the stuffing is enclosed on all sides and they are cuboid in shape, not cylindrical. And while moist enough they dont drool gravy like those awful Bombay Frankies. At this counter also, the cooking is live ? as it is in the counters for chaats, south Indian food, beverages (Quenchies) and desserts.

 Full-meal platters are available at the north Indian and Oriental outlets and while I have not indulged in them, there are two highly recommendable starters from the Oriental kitchen ? Crispy Chicken in Plum Sauce and Chicken Lollipops. The first is boneless chicken marinated for an hour in a mix of egg, cornflour and seasoning, double-fried for crispiness and then coated with a combination of plum sauce, chilli paste, garlic paste and seasoning before being served. 

 Chicken Lollipops are small drumsticks with the flesh scraped and shaped into rounds at one end of the bone combined with various ingredients and deep fried. These are also coated in a paste made by stir frying chilli paste, chopped garlic, spring onions, coriander leaves and seasoning.

 Perhaps their most interesting outlet is the Festival Counter, where every month a different festival is held. 

 They have already had, among others, an Iranian and Goan festival which I am sorry to have missed, and this month it is Curries of India featuring temptations such as Rajasthani Lal Mans, Oriya Kukkuda Jhol and Dakshini Eva Curry from Kerala, which is made with prawns and is delicious.

 Special mention must be made of their Quenchies outlet where up to 40 varieties of mocktails, shakes, teas and coffees, juices and so on are served. They have as consultant my old friend Irfan Ahmed, celebrity bar expert and one of the best in the country. He has put his stamp on items such as Hawaiian Colada (a blue mocktail), Mango Milkshake and iced teas and cold coffees, and has worked with the staff so that standards are consistent.

 The prices at Yo Foodies are unbelievably moderate and if you have overindulged in retail therapy somewhere else in the mall, it is a good place to quench your thirst and look after your appetite.

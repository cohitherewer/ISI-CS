 I have attended numerous functions at St Paul?s Cathedral in the past, but 

my experience at the La Martiniere for Boys concert on February 25 was shocking. 

Though the programme was of a short duration, there was much disturbance throughout 

the event as many in the audience kept walking in and out. They didn?t seem to 

have the basic sense that others can?t enjoy the concert if they keep talking 

and making noise by dragging the chair. The commotion also disturbed the concentration 

of the boys and affected their performance. The audience?s behaviour was completely 

against the decorum of a church.

 It is disappointing that reputed schools in the city do not have provisions 

for basic medical treatment for their students. On March 2, my nephew, a student 

of Class IV, fell down and sustained a head injury immediately after appearing 

for a paper of his annual examinations. Instead of administering first-aid, his 

classteacher advised him to apply medicine on the wound after returning home, 

which is an hour?s journey from the school. The government should make it compulsory 

for all educational institutions to keep first-aid boxes and train its staff in 

its use.

 Recently, I came upon a guardian outside Holy Child Institution on one of the 

examination days, helping a policeman clear the traffic bottleneck. Even the policeman 

was touched by the humane gesture. More such considerate people are needed in 

our society.

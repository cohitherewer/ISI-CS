 Petal power for perfect Chi flow

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui does not recommend artificial flowers that once had life and were later dried and dyed as decoratives. These are taken as dead flowers that emit negative and stagnant energy. However, decorative flowers made of silk, glass or any material other than plastic can be used in home decor. An assortment of flowers of different colours when placed in the house ensures perfect balance of Chi

Q: I read about the importance of fresh flowers in Feng Shui and tried to decorate my home with some. But its not a feasible idea since fresh flowers are expensive and not durable. I was thinking of using artificial flowers instead. Do they have the same effect as fresh flowers? If so, what are the corresponding colours of the five elements of nature that one should keep in mind?

 THE SOLUTION: Fresh flowers are definitely the best as these invite positive Chi into our homes and create an aroma of their own in the surroundings. Feng Shui does not recommend artificial flowers that had life once and were later dried and dyed in different colours. 

 These are taken as dead flowers that emit negative and stagnant energy. However, decorative flowers made of silk, glass or any material other than plastic can be used in home d?cor. 

 Fire element relates to red, maroon, pink, purple, violet, mauve and peach colours. Cool blue colours represent the water element. Glowing rich metallic-coloured flowers are connected with the metal element.

 Flowers in tones of earthy hues like rust, cream, yellow and off-white are excellent for stabilising the earth energy of the south-west corner. Flowers of all colours of nature are connected with the wood element. Assorted-coloured flowers when arranged ensure a perfect balance of Chi.

 Marriage mess

 Q: My daughter who is in her 30s is mentally very disturbed because she hasnt found a life partner of her choice as yet. She is adamant about a love marriage and turns a deaf ear to any alliance that we suggest. We have well-connected relatives and friends, but nobody comes forward with prospective matches because they know how strong-willed she is. I am worried that if she continues behaving like this she could miss the bus. Please help.

 THE SOLUTION: Activate the north-west area of your house and your daughters bedroom by placing six-rod wind chimes. These should be hollow to force the stagnant energy to flow freely in this helpful sector. This will also call forth the energy of mentors. The north-west Chi thus activated will help your daughter to be more reasonable and listen to your suggestions.

 If she does not like the idea of hanging a wind chime in her bedroom then you can place the music system in this corner to activate heavenly blessings that shower from this area. 

 Ensure that you have soft lights here as strong ones representing the fire element could destroy the metal element of this corner. 

 Do not place water in any form here as this could exhaust metal. Instead, nourish the metal energy with crystals.

 Window worry

 Q: We enter our new house from the west, facing east. Theres a large window on the eastern side that overlooks our garden. We gathered from your articles that energy flows out in this kind of arrangements. So, should we keep the window closed always? Also, our house is L-shaped and the south-west corner is missing. Please suggest remedies for these problems.

 Kritika Kapoor

 THE SOLUTION: When your entrance faces an outlet in a straight line, the Chi cannot accumulate and this results in missed opportunities in life. But at the same time, having a large window towards the east is a boon for your family. Do not try to conserve the energy by keeping windows closed or drawing curtains. 

 Instead, hang a well-cut round crystal from the window, which will disperse fast-moving Chi and also scatter the suns rays converting them into a beautiful rainbow. You can also put up a low-height beautiful screen between the main door and the window, if space permits.

 Missing the south-west corner of a house generally affects the stability of its residents. To remedy this situation, plant a big tree at the missing corner to symbolically square up the building structure.

 This point can be further strengthened, energised and beautified with a rockery and a floodlight.

 Finance fiasco

 Q: We lived happily in a bungalow with my in-laws and brother-in-law for years. But after my in-laws died, my brother-in-law somehow managed to turn us out of the house. Presently we are living in a small flat and I run the family with the earnings from a designing and tailoring business that I have started. I always carry the little money I make with me in a bag. What can we do to better our financial situation?

 Name withheld

 THE SOLUTION: Dont carry your moneybag wherever you go. Instead, let the money stabilise and grow in the south-east corner of the house, which is related with wealth. 

 Create abundance here by placing your moneybag in a south-east cupboard along with a mountain of gold.

 You can wrap each metal coin with a gold paper and place one on top of the other till a mountain is formed. 

 Do not forget to double its effect by reflecting it in a mirror. These can be installed on the inside of the door panels.

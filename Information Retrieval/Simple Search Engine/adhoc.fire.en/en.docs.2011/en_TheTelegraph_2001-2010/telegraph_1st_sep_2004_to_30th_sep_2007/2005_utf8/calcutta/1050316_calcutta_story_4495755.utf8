 Aquanaut chases England dream

 - Selected to swim the channel, hamstrung for funds

 A STAFF REPORTER

MAKING WAVES: Manik Chandra Mondal, practising 

in the Hooghly and at Mahishadal Swimming Club 

 He is barely 5 ft 2 inches tall, and the first thing that strikes one about the slightly-built 25-year-old from Bahardav village, in East Midnapore, is his humble and hesitant approach.

 But his jaw is set and his eyes twinkle as he talks about his mission in life. ?I want to cross the English Channel. I am one among the 20 short-listed swimmers from across the world who have got permission this year,? says Manik Chandra Mondal, a known name in national long-distance swimming.

 For Mondal, who grew up in an orphanage in Majherhat after losing his father at five, swimming started early in the ashram ponds, under guidance of teacher Manik Pal.

 As Mondal created waves in the ashram ponds, his talent was recognised and he started taking part in competitions. In 1994, in his first attempt at competitive swimming, he plunged into the All Bengal River Swimming Championship. The 14-year-old boy completed the 10-km stretch in Shilabati river in less than an hour and 25 minutes.

 ?I was not among the winners, but I got a special prize. It was a major recognition and helped me take up swimming seriously,? recounts Mondal, whose solo English Channel attempt is scheduled for August 11 to 18.

 Brilliant performances in the All India 41 km River Swimming Championship in 2003 and the Haldia Nad Utsav in 2004 followed, and Mondal started dreaming about doing Bengal proud the way Mihir Sen, Bula Chowdhury and Masudur Rahman did by crossing the English Channel.

 To make his dream come true, Mondal was training under the guidance of Sports Authority of India (SAI) coach Tapan Kr Panigrahi in Pune for the past few months. 

 As D-Day draws close, he has shifted base and is now practising around eight hours a day, swimming against the tide in the Hooghly during the day and at Mahishadal Swimming Club in the evening.

 ?I was selected by the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation in 2004 as well. But I did not go to England as the organisers informed me about poor weather conditions and I had to cancel my trip,? says Mondal.

 Though he is worried about the high waves of the English Channel and bad weather, his biggest concern is generating resources and finally making it to England.

 ?This is an expensive proposition and I will need around Rs 6 lakh,? says Mondal.

 Though he has the support of the Swimming Federation of India and the Bengal Amateur Swimming Association and part sponsorship from the JA Group of Companies, there is still a shortfall.

 ?I only hope that the gap is bridged and I get an opportunity to put in my best,? signs off Mondal, as he prepares for another round of against-the-tide swimming in the Hooghly.

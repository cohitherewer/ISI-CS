 Gandhi to Jinnah

 For most Jassi (of Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin) fans, Vinay Jain is an irritant. Always throwing a spanner in Jassi?s plans, his scheming mind is much more than just a bother. The Sony TV saga has brought him nationwide fame, but the suave 30-something is determined to stick to his grooming ground ? the Mumbai stage.

 ?I was drawn to the role because it had a definite character. And playing Aryan has been very gratifying,? admits Jain, before adding: ?But television makes you complacent. Stage is where the real growth of an actor occurs. I plan my TV commitments in such a way that I can do at least two plays a year.? 

 Last week, Jain breezed through town to stage Raell Padamsee?s cocktail theatre, Two to Tango, at The Park. 

 ?Theatre inculcates discipline and helps you create a method in the madness,? explains Jain, who had his first brush with dramatics while still in college in Mumbai. 

 Soon after, he worked as an assistant director with Aziz Mirza in Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman. ?That helped me get a hang of the significant aspects of film production, right from conceptualising to scripting, editing and recording. And the experience has certainly stood me in good stead when I faced the camera.?

 Even while grappling with the camera, the lead role in a stage production called The Legend of Ram came his way. Before long, Jain found himself joining stage veteran Feroz Khan?s team. 

 Of the string of projects he has worked in, Jain mentions Khan?s Salesman Ramlal (an adaptation of Arthur Miller?s Death of a Salesman) co-starring Satish Kaushik, and Raell Padamsee?s Games People Play, co-starring Soni Razdan, as significant.

 Though it?s the stage and small screen that keep him busy, Jain has just finished shooting for Tilak, an Indo-British co-production, where he plays a young Jinnah. ?Here, Jinnah is a dynamic lawyer fighting for Bal Gangadhar Tilak. You get to see him in completely different shades,? adds Jain, on the brink of bagging a role in Feroz Khan?s debut celluloid venture Mahatma vs Gandhi. In the popular stage production, Jain had essayed three small but totally contrasting roles.

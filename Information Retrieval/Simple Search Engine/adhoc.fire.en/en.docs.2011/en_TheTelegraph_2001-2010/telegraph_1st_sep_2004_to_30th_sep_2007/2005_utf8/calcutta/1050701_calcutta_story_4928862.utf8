 Winners, but not in power

 - Women councillor count up, but few in mayoral council

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Women councillors have increased their presence in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) quite appreciably over the past 10 years, but their representation in the mayoral council remains minuscule. 

 From five in 1985, the number of women representatives has risen to 63 in 2005 ? 44.68 per cent of the total 141 councillors. Had they come together breaking party ranks, they would have been just eight short of the required majority to form the civic board.

 Yet, there were only two women in the mayoral council of the last Trinamul Congress-BJP board, including deputy mayor Meena Devi Purohit. In the earlier three Left boards, women?s representation in the council had been just one.

 Trinamul?s Javed Ahmed Khan, Opposition leader-designate in the civic body, agreed that women councillors were under-represented in the decision-making process. According to him, at least three women should be inducted into the mayoral council.

 The jump in the number of women councillors has been a post-1995 phenomenon. The state election commission that year had announced that 33 per cent (47) of the 141 seats would be reserved for women candidates, said CMC secretary Sajal Bhowmik.

 But the results of the past three elections show that women have been gaining in strength much beyond what the authorities have granted them. The number of victorious candidates in the 1995 and 2000 polls had been 50 and 56, respectively. In this election, 16 women have won outside the reserved quota.

 Some women councillors, both from the Left and non-Left parties, are sure they are competent enough to become mayor. 

 ?A councillor who can discharge her responsibilities independently as mayoral council member can easily become mayor,? said Mala Roy, who had been a member in Subrata Mukherjee?s council.

 She pointed out that a recent UGC-aided survey on women councillors had revealed that they were more ?efficient and sensitive? than their male counterparts. ?That is why more and more women are winning and the day may not be far when the authorities will be forced to consider a quota for men,? said Roy.

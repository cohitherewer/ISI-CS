 Demolition squad for unauthorised garage

 A garage encroaches on Bagbazar Street. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopahaya 

 Salil Chatterjee: An NGO has built a garage for its ambulance by encroaching a pavement, carriageway and a CMC gully pit on Bagbazar Street.

 I will not allow this. I have already received a mass petition signed by over 800 local residents demanding action against the encroachment. If the construction is not demolished by the central demolition squad of the CMC, such garages will mushroom all over the city. We had offered the NGO garage facilities in the CMC?s ambulance centre, but it did not accept our proposal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

It?s the history of a moving picture

 VULNERABILITY AND A BRAVE FACE: The video being screened at the Portrait gallery of Victoria Memorial Hall. Picture by Pabitra Das

 High above the Portrait gallery of Victoria Memorial Hall is a screen on which is projected continuously a frieze of heads of callow soldiers staring unblinkingly ? or so it seems at first glance ? at the camera.

 The heads are in sets of two ? black, as in natives of South India, and white, as in Scotsmen. But to the casual visitor ? and anyone who has lived long enough in Calcutta should be aware that Victoria Memorial is like a pilgrim centre for upcountry visitors ? all this information on the ethnicity of the men who were shot on 35 mm film would not be available.

 The ebony-ivory divide apart, they could be two sides of the same coin. Exposed as they are to the camera?s gaze during a parade ground inspection, it is easy to detect traces of vulnerability in their enlarged irises or in a sudden twitch. But they put a brave face to it.

 The effect, as its creator himself described it later, is ?like watching a waterfall ? everchanging yet always the same.?

 Perhaps visitors would also wonder why the exhibition, presented by British Council, is called History Painting, when every man jack knows that it is video. Particularly when actual paintings of Indian soldiers in the British army are being displayed in the Central hall.

 For replies to the many questions that are bound to crowd the viewer?s mind, one had to consult the British Council press release as well as the artist himself ? Roderick Buchanan, based in Glasgow, who was here for the opening on Monday.

 Buchanan rose to prominence in the 1990s and has to his credit one-man shows in London, New York and Paris. British Council commissioned History Painting for the 11th Indian Triennale in Delhi, held early this year. Although it seems that Buchanan shot the soldiers on the same location, but those from the Madras Regiment were filmed in Tamil Nadu and their ?doppelgangers? in the Scottish Infantry Division in North Yorkshire. 

 The predecessors of the same men had fought alongside each other at the battle of Assaye.

 Buchanan?s broad accent could have struck shock and awe in many, as he recited Burns at the opening. The next day, he happily announced that he had never taken up a sketch pad and that he found it impossible to decode a painting. 

 The video camera is his paintbrush. ?Video is a great tool for quick ideas. It is seductive material. Everybody knows how to decode TV,? says the artist, who catches his sitters when their guard is down.

 With the same disarming frankness, Buchanan admits that he was shocked that a large city like Calcutta does not have a contemporary art space, where works such as his can be shown. Victoria Memorial was a conscious choice because when exhibited in a hall crowded with marble statutes of the men who made the Empire, his work would acquire a different dimension altogether.

 While thrilled by the British Council invitation, Buchanan found it a daunting task, as most biennales are attached to cities, whereas this had to relate to an entire nation. He plumped for the army, the only ?truly national system around.?

 He discovered that the story of India is largely forgotten by the people in the UK. But he was surprised that the Indian Army was happy to collaborate. He stresses that it is important to keep the dialogue opened by his work going. It was also important to expose the ?multiple histories? of Britain, and voices such as his to be heard, as they were never heard before.

 Somewhat like the soldiers he filmed ? still recruited from the least advantaged parts of society. Buchanan should be delighted that most of his viewers in Calcutta should be from the same set. The exhibition is on till November 23.

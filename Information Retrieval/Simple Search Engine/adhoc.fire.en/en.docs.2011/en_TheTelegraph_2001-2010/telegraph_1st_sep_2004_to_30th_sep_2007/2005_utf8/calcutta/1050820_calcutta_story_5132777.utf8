The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 War of words over raided IT firm

 - Second case unearthed after allegation of fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Malyaban Gupta has been crying foul over how Buddhadeb Gupta and Sanjay Saha of Future Technology Foundation Inc (FTF) had taken Rs 1,50,000 from him with the promise of a job in the US, and then slammed the doors on him.

 Based on his FIR alleging a job scam, the Biddhanagar (north) police station conducted a raid on the company premises on August 17 (as reported in Metro on August 18).

 But the Future Technology Foundation team has a different story to tell, backed by a court order, a copy of which is with Metro.

 Biswanath Maity, currently in the accounts department of Future Technology Foundation, says: ?In 2004, the company opened its Bangalore office. Malyaban, who was with the Calcutta office, was put in charge of the Bangalore office. No money was ever taken from him, nor was he offered a job in the US. It is our belief that he was involved in misappropriation of funds in the Bangalore office.?

 Malyaban counters this. ?I was never given an appointment letter. In fact, the money receipt which was given to me on account of the Rs. 1, 50,000, clearly states that the amount was for processing the H1-B visa.?

 According to Subrata Nayak, advocate for the company, Gupta set up the Calcutta operations in 2003, at P-87, Lake Road, appointed Ayan Chatterjee as CEO, and granted him power of attorney.

 In November 2004, Gupta had come to Calcutta, as he had been receiving reports of financial irregularities and mismanagement of the company accounts.

 ?Once Gupta returned to the US, Chatterjee changed the name of the company from Future Technology Foundation to Futuresoft Management Pvt Ltd. When Gupta returned to Calcutta on January 6, he was denied entry into the office,? says Nayak.

 Gupta then terminated Chatterjee?s employment, revoked the power of attorney, and lodged an FIR with the Lake police station. Both civil and criminal cases were filed against Chatterjee, adds the advocate.

 ?Based on Gupta?s FIR, the police conducted a probe and the court ordered status quo to be maintained? Chatterjee and Bose filed appeals against the order of the lower court in the high court.

 ?Their appeals were dismissed with costs and the high court also directed the registrar-general to lodge a complaint with the police, to investigate and draw up a criminal case against Chatterjee and Bose for allegedly forging documents,? says Nayak.

 Chatterjee, for whom Malyaban is said to be working in Futuresoft Management on a contractual basis, claimed the two cases were ?completely separate?.

 On Friday, the former CEO of Future Technology Foundation, said: ?The case of Malyaban and the court cases they (Gupta and his advocate) are referring to are separate things. All documents pertaining to how the sum of Rs 1,50,000 was paid by Malyaban are with the Behala police station.?

 It was on the basis of the Behala police station complaint that Bidhannagar police raided Future Technology Foundation?s Salt Lake office.

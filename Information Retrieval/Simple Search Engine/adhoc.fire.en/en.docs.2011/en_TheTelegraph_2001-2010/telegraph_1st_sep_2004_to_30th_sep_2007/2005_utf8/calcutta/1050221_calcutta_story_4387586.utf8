 Billboard threat to green-zone trees

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A drive down VIP Road might soon cease to be a treat for sore eyes if the authorities fail to stop the indiscriminate felling of trees along the stretch.

 Armed with a clearance from the Public Works Department (PWD), advertisers are either felling the trees or trimming them severely to make the billboards prominent.

 The problem is further compounded by illegal settlers along the road, also known as Nazrul Islam Sarani, who are chopping down the trees for fuel.

 Nearly 2,000 trees line a three-km stretch of VIP Road, from Ultadanga bridge to Kestopur. But now, many pockets on the road, including parts of Dum Dum Park, Golaghata and Bangur Avenue, have already worn a barren look.

 PWD minister Amar Choudhury said on Sunday that an advertising agency that had been given the lease last year to put up billboards in the area had been warned not to cut or trim trees. 

 ?Some of our labourers might have cut down a few trees for firewood. But we never cut down any tree for obstructing the billboards,? said Shantanu Ghatak, the supervisor of the field camp of the advertising agency. 

 A visit to the area, however, revealed that 50 trees had been felled and several others severely trimmed.

 ?Recently, we arrested two persons for trimming trees without a licence from the forest department. We are yet to track down the group that is engaged in regular cutting down of the trees,? said Babul Dutta, officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station. 

 An officer of Baguiati police station said that they have arrested one person after receiving complaints of tree-felling. 

 A.K. Chakrabarty, divisional forest officer of Barasat, admitted that they do not have the infrastructure to track down the offenders.

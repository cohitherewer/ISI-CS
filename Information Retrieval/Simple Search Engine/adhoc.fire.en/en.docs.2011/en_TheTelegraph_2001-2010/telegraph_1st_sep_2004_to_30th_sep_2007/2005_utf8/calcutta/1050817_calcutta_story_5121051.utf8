 Woman?s body on the Bypass

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A woman in her mid-twenties was found dead in the marshes, yards from the Science City roundabout, on Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, on Monday afternoon. She was not identified till Tuesday evening.

 Police said strangulation marks were found on the neck. 

 Preliminary investigations suggest that the woman had been murdered elsewhere, some time between Friday and Saturday, and the body was dumped in the marshes. She was probably throttled with her own dupatta.

 South 24-Parganas police superintendent S.N. Gupta said: ?We are waiting for the detailed post-mortem report. But, going by preliminary indications, rape cannot be said to be the motive.?

 An officer of Tiljala police station, who is working on the case, said certain marks on the body suggested that the woman had tried to resist her killers. 

 ?It appears that one of them had held her back and another wound her dupatta round her neck and strangulated her,? the officer said.

 Police stations across the state have been alerted for the woman?s identity.

 The body was spotted by some Tangra residents, who saw from a distance a bluish object in the water, amid a mesh of thick grass. 

 Coming closer, they realised it was the bloated body of a woman clad in a blue salwar-kameez, ripped in places. The left wrist had an expensive watch on it.

 The group rushed to police officers on duty near the approach to Bridge No. 4, in Park Circus. The officers were busy checking vehicles ? the Independence Day alert was on ? when they were told of the body. 

 After a brief discussion, the Tangra residents were asked to report the matter to Paroma Investigation Centre, off Science City.

 The officers at the investigation centre called up Tiljala police station and also the South 24-Parganas police control room in Alipore. Within minutes, a team of officers arrived at the spot. 

 The details were noted down and a photograph of the body was taken. It was then retrieved from the water and taken to MR Bangur Hospital.

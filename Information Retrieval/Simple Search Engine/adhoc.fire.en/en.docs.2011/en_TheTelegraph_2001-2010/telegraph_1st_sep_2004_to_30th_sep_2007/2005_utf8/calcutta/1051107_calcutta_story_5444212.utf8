 Maiden name update at office

 Tathagata Bose: The validity period of a passport is 10 years. If a woman gets married within the validity period and takes up the surname of her husband, will she have to inform the passport office?

 She can get her surname changed at the passport office. For that, she will have to submit a photocopy of her husband?s passport, if he has one, and an attested copy of their marriage registration certificate or an affidavit along with their photograph.

 Trendy timepieces for tots

 BABAY'S DAY OUT

 They swear by video games, they are passionate about Potter, and the tech-savvy tots today love indulging in trendy timepieces too. Be it for regular use, sports or parties, there is no stopping these little ones when it comes to picking up watches that match their style and age.

 What they watch out for is a smart blend of utility and fashion. GoodLife browses through the latest kids watches adorning little wrists and the racks of lifestyle stores.

 Little likes

 Watches catering to children under 10 years should have features like distinct numerical, as these are the years when the kid is learning his or her first lessons, explains Gautam Shroff from Archies at City Centre.

 The collection for toddlers at Nik Nish and Archies has the digits inscribed in solid colours. The watches look pretty with bands in bright splashes that are further decorated with flowers, butterflies and heart motifs.

 At Nik Nish, instead of the plain seconds hand, butterflies and flowers indicate the micro-minutes. Watches with a dial that resembles a corporate bag jostle for attention too. 

 When parents come to buy watches for their children they look for bright colour combinations as well as cartoon characters that a child can relate to, says Shahbaz Zaman of Nik Nish. 

 From motifs of Mickey Mouse to Cinderella to Pooh, at Prime Watch World it is the Disney Watch range imported from the US that catches your attention. They come in metal as well as fibre casing.

 Regular rage

 Books, schools and tuitions? It is definitely not a world that goes best with the young brigade. Some splashy trendy watches could bring colour to this mundane routine, of which tracking time is an integral part.

 Archies and Nik Nish are home to a variety of regular wears. Dials in the shape of broad squares, rectangles and ovals with bright bands look functional yet funky. The strap-on variety at Archies with logos of Spiderman look sporty and cool. 

 The Timex digital range is popular with boys of all age groups. They have additional features like night light, stopwatch and timer.

 Party picks

 Watches are definitely a fashion statement for children today, like any other accessory, says Shroff from Archies. The collection here includes circular dials with big beads in sober combinations of white and pink or white and green. 

 Then you have shell bands with ornate dials and ones with bands that resemble broad wristlets with open ends. For that funky look, boys can opt for ones with broad leather bands embellished with chains and buttons.

 At Nik Nish, the bangle watches with dials decorated with flowers are worth a look. Also on offer are ones with metallic finish and tiny attachments of a smiling sun and butterflies.

 Since these watches are not very expensive, youngsters pick up quite a few pieces to match their wardrobe, adds Zaman. Another must-check for party picks is the Fast Track Masala collection from Titan.

 Gifts galore

 If you are racking your brains for a perfect gift option for your little one, the Flik Flak collection from Swatch at Prime Watch World might be just what you are looking for. 

 For the little tykes it is an adventure package with a bag that includes a watch, torch, notebook and a pencil. For the little angels it is a pretty pink bag along with a watch. At Archies you can opt for metallic ones with the dial embellished with logos of popular football teams like Chelsea and Manchester United.

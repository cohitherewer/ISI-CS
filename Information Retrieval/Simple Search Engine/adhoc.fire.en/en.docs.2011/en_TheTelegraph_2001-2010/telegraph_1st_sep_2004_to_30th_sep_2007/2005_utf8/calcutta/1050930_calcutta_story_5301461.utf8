The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Biz as usual in rival hub

 B.R. SRIKANTH IN BANGALORE

 If it was bandh as usual in Calcutta, it was business as usual in Bangalore.

 As private-sector companies in Salt Lake struggled to register respectable attendance figures during the 24-hour trade union strike on Thursday, for the 1,500-odd IT and ITES-BPO companies in Bangalore, it was just another day at work.

 The tale of two cities, though, had a chapter of similarities ? most public-sector and central units reported a complete shutdown in both.

 But that parallel ended at the gateway to the IT sector. Infosys Technologies Ltd ? which is eyeing Calcutta as a possible destination ? and Wipro Ltd ? which has already set up base in Salt Lake Electronics Complex ? said all their units here functioned without a hitch.

 Employees arrived either by company transport or on their own. In Calcutta, by contrast, a number of Wipro employees were stopped and harassed en route to work in the morning. Some were even dropped off in police jeeps later in the day.

 At the Electronics City and International Tech Park, two core regions of IT and ITES-BPO activity in Bangalore, and in other parts of the city, there were no complaints from tech firms.

 The Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) was quick to tout this as a strength ? and, by extension, highlight this as a weakness for competitor Calcutta.

 ?For this industry, we cannot have any disruptions. We do not have the problem of strikes in Bangalore,? stressed Anand Koppar, president of the BCIC.

 M.K. Shankarlinge Gowda, secretary, information technology and biotechnology, also played the us versus them card: ?Unlike other states, nobody has complained that their programmers encountered problems.?

 While no one was quite willing to be drawn into the Calcutta vs Bangalore debate reopened by the Infosys chief mentor?s Wednesday visit, Koppar of BCIC agreed that Bengal should learn from the mistakes committed by the Karnataka government. ?We are going through growth pangs because we did not plan the infrastructure, keeping in mind the expansion of this city. It?s good if other cities can plan for the future.?

 Contrary to the principal?s claim, police have found that ?five or six students? of Presidency College, along with some outsiders, were involved in preventing higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty from entering the campus on July 22.

 Chakraborty, who was scheduled to attend an NGO-organised programme, had to return disheartened after the students, protesting an incident of molestation in the college, blocked his entry and climbed atop his car. 

 Embarrassed by the ?shocking? incident, principal Amitava Chatterjee had claimed that none of his students was involved in it. ?The entire episode was the handiwork of outsiders,? he had claimed.

 But after a week-long probe, ?we have come to know that five or six students of the college, along with some outsiders, were involved in blocking the minister?s entry. Those involved are all members of the Democratic Students? Organisation, an SUCI affiliate,? said Dulal Chakraborty, assistant commissioner (central).

 Chakraborty said he had submitted a report to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. ?We have photographs that prove the involvement of some students of the college. But we cannot proceed further because of the lukewarm response of the authorities,? he maintained.

 The police version has also been backed by a section of students. ?We are certain about some of our friends? involvement in blocking the minister?s entry,? a student said on condition of anonymity. 

 Unfazed, principal Chatterjee asserted: ?Let police do their job. I still believe my students were not involved in the shameful incident.?

 Case closed: The molestation case has been closed because of, what police say, lack of cooperation from the victim and the college authorities. 

 ?Four or five outsiders have been detained. But they have to be set free as neither the victim nor the college is cooperating with us. Who will identify the culprit if the complainant herself does not come forward?? asked an officer.

 An outsider, often seen hanging around the college with friends, had sneaked into the building on July 20, accosted a student, passed lewd comments and made obscene gestures at her. 

 Cops guarding the four entry points of the college have demanded removal of staff quarters from the campus. ?Outsiders take shelter in the quarters and the authorities have done nothing to stop this,? said assistant commissioner Chakraborty. 

 The authorities, however, have begun the process of introducing identity cards for students and staff, as part of the move to tighten security.

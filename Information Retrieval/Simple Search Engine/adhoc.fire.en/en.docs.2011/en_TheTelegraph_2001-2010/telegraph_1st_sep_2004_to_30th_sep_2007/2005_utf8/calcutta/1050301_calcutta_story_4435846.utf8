 Just go with the flow

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Bring home a little bit of the outdoors with an indoor fountain. The soft trickle of water along with some soothing music can transform your house into a chillout zone you?d love to come back to after a hard day?s grind. While the relatively elaborate ones that fringe large halls are designer efforts, you can pick up a compact water treatment off the racks anytime. 

 Usually imported from China and Italy, the indoor fountains start at about one foot and go up to five feet in height. Driven by the submerged motor pump, the trickle of the water is fringed by fibre glass and polyurethane figurines.

 The motifs are natural for the most part with a lot of emphasis on greenery, mostly peppered with a human figure or two.

 Those with a Feng Shui fixation have more interesting shapes like the dragon, laughing Buddha and even horses to choose from. These articles are a little on the expensive side, encrusted with semi-precious stones, again of Feng Shui flock. Colours are as bright as they get and the placement is strictly according to the birth chart of the breadwinner of the house!

Non-Feng Shui believers need not lose out on the eye candy either. Colourful submerged halogen bulbs and water patterns ranging from the usual sprinklers to the foamy and foggy effects in most fountains help you to create a delightful corner at home. 

 The catch, however, is the maintenance. The motor needs to be kept thoroughly clean and water needs to be drained out in case you are not running the fountain, as stagnant water can encourage the breeding of mosquitoes.

 Interior designer Manjari Sahay advises sprinkling a little detergent powder in the water, which creates a fabulous foam effect, apart from helping to clean the machinery thoroughly. It is also advisable to change the water every alternate day.

 The outer decorations can, of course, be just wiped clean.

 Echoes of the inner voice

 Bhumica?s Natya Utsav 2005 features three socially relevant, one-act plays. Ekti Na Natak, being staged today, serves as a testament of mans helplessness to check the tide of unhappy occurrences in a flawed and imperfect social environment. Structurally taut within the dramatic format of a play within a play, it shows how the protagonists desire to consciously turn a blind eye to the problems and complexities of life, resulting in tragic consequences that none can prevent. Of the two plays being performed tomorrow, Nihata Shatabdi (picture above) deals with an unreal situation in which creator and creation communicate. A critique of artists? insensitivity towards the subject of their creative efforts, it also lashes out at the gross commercialisation of art and its resultant detachment from social responsibilities. The other play, Baazi, is sympathetic to the so-called criminals in our society. In trying to understand the real reasons for their lives having gone astray, the play helps us discover that they are but necessary outgrowths of our corrupt social system.

 In tune with ragas

 A name to reckon with in the field of Hindustani classical music, Sandipan Samajpatis rise to eminence can be attributed to his single-minded devotion, evident in two decades of unrelenting taleem (practice) under the guidance of vocal maestro Manas Chakraborty. Coupled with a keen perception of music and an innate desire for perfection, Samajpati is today one of the leading vocal artistes of his generation. Above all, his tuneful and mellifluous voice gives his music a rare depth and dimension that instantly captures the hearts of listeners. Having regaled audiences at various prestigious music conferences in India and abroad, his solo presentation in his home town comprises traditional evening ragas, that promises to enchant and elevate listeners to a plane of quiet, restrained ecstasy. To be accompanied by Samar Saha (tabla) and Hiranmay Mitra (harmonium). Presented by Ritwik (South).

 An attestation of genius

 The thin, imperceptible line separating genius from eccentricity has been a matter of much concern among modern behavioural scientists. Chetanas production, Nirnoy, attempts to trace the path of this line of super-consciousness and, in the process, helps figure out causes for irrational behaviour, particularly in talented individuals. The Bengali adaptation of David Auburn?s Proof, the play opens on the eve of the 25th birthday of Catherine, who has devoted her life to looking after her eccentric father, who was also a celebrated mathematical genius. Denied a normal childhood, Catherine experiences volatile emotions after her father?s death. Her life becomes more complicated with the arrival of her estranged sister, Claire, and Hal, a former student of her father. In fact, in the long weekend that follows, Catherine needs to do much more than respond to the romantic attentions of Hal. The discovery of a mysterious notebook from her drawer leads her to seek an answer to the most difficult question of all: How much of her father?s madness and how much of his genius did she inherit? Direction: Arun Mukhopadhyay.

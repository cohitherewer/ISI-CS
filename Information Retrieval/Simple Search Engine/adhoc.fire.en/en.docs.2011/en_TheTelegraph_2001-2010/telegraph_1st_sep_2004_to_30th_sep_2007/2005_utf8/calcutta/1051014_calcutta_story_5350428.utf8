 - Son?s quest after father dies of alleged medical neglect

 Aziz Mubarki: Negligence cry

 It has been two years since his father died, a victim of alleged medical negligence, but Aziz Mubarki has not stopped knocking on the doors of justice.

 With quiet resilience, the 32-year-old has shot off over 1,000 letters and faxes since then to various people in authority, including the Prime Minister and President of India, the chief minister, police, the state medical council as well as the Medical Council of India, among others, evoking a lukewarm response from everyone, save the Bengal governor. 

 After 15 to 20 missives, the governor has finally decided to grant him an audience next month.

 ?Not just government officers, I have met two police commissioners and three deputy commissioners of the detective department, apart from going to the consumer court for endless hearings in the past few years,? said Mubarki.

 On December 2002, Ahmed Mubarki, 65, was first taken to a doctor with complaints of suspected gangrene in his big toe. He was admitted to a nursing home and subsequently referred to surgeon S.K. Nawaz for treatment. The doctor prescribed ?anti-gas gangrene human anti-sera? to stop necrosis and decay of body tissues, but the medicine was never found and Mubarki senior died from infection.

 ?I still remember December 26 that year (2002), when we ran from pillar to post to get one ampoule of the human anti-sera but could not find it anywhere. The doctor had prescribed an injection, which is not available in the market,? recalled son Aziz. The next day, about 16 days after admission, Ahmed Mubarki?s right leg was amputated, but the infection had already spread and he died within a month. 

 S.K. Nawaz, who carried out the surgery, denied medical negligence. ?I will not say anything. A police investigation and consumer court case is underway, let Mubarki do whatever he wishes,? said Nawaz.

 Mubarki, after mourning his father?s death for some time, started a vigorous campaign seeking justice.

 He first lodged a complaint with the medical council and then followed it up with a similar complaint to the police, despite facing immense pressure from various quarters to withdraw it. 

 ?The pressure was enormous both politically and otherwise, and some people even threatened to kill me and I was forced to shut down my retail music store at Pemantle Street thereafter,? said Mubarki.

 So far, Mubarki has shot off nearly 250 letters to the chief minister, about 100 to the prime minister, over 250 to the Medical Council of India and the state medical council, apart from various government departments, without much success. 

 ?After nearly 100 letters, I got a call from the Prime Minister?s Office in Delhi this April and I went to meet them, but with a Chinese delegation in town, I was told that the meeting could not take place,? recalled Mubarki.

 Unfazed at the Delhi failure, Mubarki met senior officers at the Indian Medical Association and the health department, apart from sending a letter or two to Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and constant reminders to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, President of India, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and the medical council.

 Last week, there was some good news for him. The grievance cell of the IMA called him for a meeting. 

 ?They heard my case patiently and told me that they would look into the case seriously,? Mubarki said. 

 Then, two days ago, Mubarki received a message from the governor who wanted to meet him. 

 ?I am meeting him next month and have already made all preparations regarding my case study and I am sure that he will understand my pain,? stressed Mubarki. 

 D.K. Ghosh, registrar with the state medical council, added that investigations into the case were still underway.

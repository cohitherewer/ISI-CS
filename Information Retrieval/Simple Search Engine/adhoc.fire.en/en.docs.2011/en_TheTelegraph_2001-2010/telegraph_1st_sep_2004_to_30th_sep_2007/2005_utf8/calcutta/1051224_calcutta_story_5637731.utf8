 A chain of novel stores coming up in Calcutta and its fringes promises to cobble together a host of communications and retail services ?for the first time?. To be launched by the Happy Group, each Happy Webstore will retail products like telecom items, computers and peripherals, banking products, real estate consultancy, courier services and online share trading.

 ?We will also provide a fully-equipped business centre with fax, Internet, scanner, Net telephony at every Happy Webstore, besides all travel-related assistance and membership to the Happy Club, the country?s first virtual club,? says Sushil Poddar, chairman of the Happy Group of Companies.

 The group plans to set up 200 to 220 such outlets in and around the city over the next 12 months. Each store will be around 300 sq ft in size and a franchisee can make a net profit of Rs 50,000 a month after meeting all expenses, against an investment of around Rs 3 lakh, Poddar assures.

 ?The concept is to sell multiple products having multiple utilities at multiple locations under one roof,? explains Rajiv Poddar, managing director of the group, which has entered into an alliance with ICICI-Winfra for supply of franchisees.

 To facilitate this unique convergence of the entire spectrum of the sunrise segment, Happy Group has tied up with BSNL, HCL, Wipro, DTDC, ICICI Bank and other service providers. The company will also network with Thomas Cook, Cox amp; Kings and STAR Cruises for offering their whole range of travel-related services at the Webstores.

 ?We are one of the biggest franchisees of BSNL and we would like to use this platform to reach out to a wider segment with the entire range of BSNL products, from basic phone to broadband,? the chairman stresses. Collaboration with an insurance firm is also lined up to offer life insurance products and services.

 The business centres at the outlets will also serve as plug-and-use retail offices for business travellers to Calcutta. ?You need not always carry your laptop around or scout frantically for an Internet parlour or a colour scanning set-up to meet an exacting deadline,? says a group spokesman.

 A large array of real estate products in the city and its suburbs will also be showcased at an in-store kiosk, with home finance guidance. ?This is a foolproof concept and extremely lucrative to the franchisees. In one year, they get to recover their full investment and hit the profit path. Besides, the risks are minimal, since most products on the racks are resaleable,? the group chairman says.

 Space jam in child wards

 - DENGUE FEAR DRIVES PARENTS TO HOSPITALS

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Beds are out of the question. And the floors, all full.

 Call it dengue or the fear of it, the paediatric departments of most state-run city hospitals were at a loss on Monday, as parents turned up in hordes and refused to leave without getting their children admitted. 

 At places like Medical College and Hospital, all beds in the paediatric ward are being shared by more than one patient and their mothers. At other hospitals, a space on the floor seemed all too fine.

 Down with fever, children threw up on their parents, while doctors struggled to answer anxious queries from mothers ? ?amar bachcha benchey jabey to (will my child survive)??

 Superintendent of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital Pradip Mitra said: ?There is hardly any space to accommodate patients. And we can?t take the risk of referring them to other hospitals, as they may die on the way.?

 Mitra was not exaggerating. On the seventh storey of the main building, in the hospital?s paediatric ward, the floor was almost entirely occupied by children lying on plastic sheets. Parents were moving around frantically, asking the staff whether blood test reports from the School of Tropical Medicine had arrived.

 Junior doctors said close to 180 patients had been admitted to the ward, which has only 70 beds.

 ?Amid the chaos, we are also attending to neo-natals, who have been put up in the emergency unit,? said a senior teacher of the department.

 At Medical College and Hospital, the paediatric department was chock-a-block with patients from Colootola, Sovabazar, Bagbazar and other areas. 

 ?This is nothing new. The paediatric wards of all medical colleges always remain occupied beyond capacity. Now, 45-50 patients are turning up daily with dengue-like symptoms,? said deputy superintendent Amarendra Nath Biswas.

 The only exception seemed to be Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. Doctors there claimed the number of patients turning up with dengue-like symptoms had come down. ?Today, we had just six suspected cases,? said superintendent Sukumar Das. The hospital is not troubled with a space crunch, as it does not have a paediatric ward.

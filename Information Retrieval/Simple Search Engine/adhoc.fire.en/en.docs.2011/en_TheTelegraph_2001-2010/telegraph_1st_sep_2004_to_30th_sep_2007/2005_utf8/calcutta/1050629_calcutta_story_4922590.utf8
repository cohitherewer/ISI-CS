 Dollops of passion and culinary wealth from France are adding to the aroma at Atrium, the 24-hour coffee shop at The Park, thanks to executive chef Yvonnick Jegat Deniau.

 Keeping in mind the varied tastes of the citys food lovers, the choice is wide. A major attraction is the entr?e section, with delicious items like the vegetarian Antipasti Selection with grilled vegetables, tomato, bocconcini, marinated mushroom and tomato Bruschetta and the Greek Salad with olive oil and oregano dressing. Non-vegetarians can opt for the Grilled Prawns with asparagus, Tenderloin Carpaccio marinated with lime, olive oil and parmesan and Chicken Liver Mousse and Smoked Duck on Crispy French Baguette with sour strawberry sauce. Prices start at Rs 205.

 For those preferring a hot soup to warm up the system can pick from a variety of tasty and innovative soups like the Atrium Gazpacho with olive, onion and cherry tomato brochette, Shrimp Cappuccino scented with saffron or the Mutton Broth Yakhani flavoured with cilantro.

 While the snack selection has been left more or less the same, the main courses have been completely revamped with a host of veggies, poultry, red meat and seafood items spiced up with interesting sauces and a simple, yet elegant presentation. Tandoor and Indian curry lovers can opt for the Makhmali Fish Tikka, Crispy-coated Khadak Sheek Kebab, Prawns and Potatoes simmered in coconut and tomato gravy with lachha spinach and vegetable tehri, Mirch Baigan ki Salan, Chennar Dalna with pumpkin fritters, to name a few.

 Those with a taste for improvised Italian cuisine, the pizza, pasta and risotto selection provides an ample selection. Pizzas come with vegetarian topping options like jalapeno, asparagus, capers, olives, spicy paneer, okra masala and gorgonzola, and non-vegetarian ones like ham, chicken, chicken tikka, tuna, anchovies, crab, proscuitto, prawns and pepperoni.

 The pasta and risotto platter is also mix-and-match. After deciding on the base ?penne, fusilli, farfalle, spaghetti, linguini or whole-wheat pasta ? one can opt for a delicious range of ingredients like porcini mushrooms, asparagus, wilted spinach, garlic cream, zucchini, cherry tomatoes or roasted aubergines. Non-vegetarian sauces include Seafood Arrabiatta, Lamb Bolognaise or Traditional Carbonara.

 Coming to the Continental main course, everything is new. Peppered Rack of Lamb with Cocoa Sauce on wild forest mushroom and garlic mash, Pork Chops with Pommerie Mustard Sauce and crushed potato in olive oil, Grilled Lobster with Mushroom and Herb Butter on potatoes and sweet pepper boulangerre or Pan-fried Prawns with Tomato and Balsamic Coulis with saffron rice and green vegetable medley are some of the non-veg options.

 The green selection offers Tofu, Asparagus and Fresh Mushroom in Oriental Barbecue Sauce with bean shoot salad and ginger lemon grass fried rice and Vegetable Makhni Lasagne with basil oil and tomato.

 Finally stopping at the sweet selection, there is a delicious range of desserts like the Warm Fudge Brownie with prune ripple ice cream, Tiramisu with coffee, mascarpone and brandy, Bittersweet Chocolate Cups filled with mango parfait and Baked Cheesecake with chocolate and hazelnut base and topped with mixed berry compote. The chefs personal favourite is the Baklava rolls, served with honey and lemon ice cream. 

 While the main courses start at Rs 255, the sweet pinch is marked at Rs 145.

 Golden glow

 Ancient amber is the latest inspiration at The Gold Factory. The Gariahat store launched a range of amber lockets and earrings on Friday. Amber is fossilised resin from now extinct trees, commonly used in jewellery.

 We have used Russian amber because of its clarity, explains Brinda Ganguly Sirkar, designer of the jewellery line.

 The abstract shapes of the pendants with gold threads tied arbitrarily make for attractive everyday as well as party wear. They can be worn on gold chains or black velvet, depending on the occasion. The appeal of the earrings lie in intricate gold work combined with a translucent honey hue.

 Catering to women of all ages, the lockets and earrings go well with both traditional and western wear, smiles Brinda. The lockets range from Rs 3,000 to Rs 7,000, while the earrings start from Rs 3,000 and go up to Rs 5,500.

 Fine finish

 Buying a Chippendale original for your study might be your out-of-reach furniture fantasy, but restored antiques and antique-look furniture are very much within your grasp.

 Sleep in a bed like the Maharaja of Budwan once did, or work at a desk that belonged to a royal in England. Minnoli, a relatively new addition to the citys furniture scene, deals in restored old furniture, but more importantly, in making new pieces which resemble famous designs from the past.

 These are not antiques, but are period pieces inspired by the designs of a certain time or country, explains owner Sharad Narula.

 The store, inside Karnani Estate at the Shakespeare Sarani-AJC Bose Road crossing, uses mainly teak and mahogany. We give a 10-year guarantee on the pieces which can be sold back to us at the same price if the client wants, adds Sharad.

 European, Chinese and French influences as well as Bengali styles mark the designs on display. A lot of the furniture we make here are from the time of the British Raj, when influences were mixed, he says.

 The best thing about the creations is the finishing. Other than furniture, statues, mementoes, lights and crockery, all either restored or replicated, can also be found.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Misuse taint on torture law

 SARDER AMJAD ALI, president of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association, met readers of The Telegraph at his office on Friday to answer their queries. 

Participants included Lalit Singh Nahar, S.K. Khettry, Diptimoy Ghosh, Sourish Misra, Amitava Gupta, S. Halder, Chandrima Ghosh and Subhayu Pal

Diptimoy Ghosh: There is plenty of scope for the misuse of Section 498A, which enables a woman to bring charges of mental and physical torture against her in-laws. Many feel that the law is proving to be counterproductive. Do you think the law should be changed?

 The law was put in place at a time when incidents of torture on housewives by their in-laws had become a regular affair. Repeated appeals didn?t have much of an effect. So it was felt that legislation was needed to safeguard the rights of the women who were being tortured by their in-laws.

 I agree that the law has been and is still being rampantly misused. Things have come to such a state that it seems that the husband or in-laws are almost at the mercy of a bride.

 I feel that there should be a law to counter the misuse of Section 498A so that families are not unnecessarily harassed. If that is not possible, the existing law should be modified so that a system of checks and balances is in place. 

Diptimoy Ghosh: Section 498A does, indeed, seem to need modification, but if you look at some of the incidents of torture in the rural pockets, then it seems the law still serves as a shield for the oppressed.

 It is true that housewives in rural areas are subjected to more torture and harassment than their counterparts in the city. In the interiors, Section 498A remains a potent tool for the survival of tortured women, who have no support otherwise.

 The situation is very different in the urban areas. A section of educated women are using the law to dominate, and even threaten, their in-laws. Sometimes, women seeking divorce file a case under this section before starting the process to annul the marriage. I strongly believe it?s high time to make some modifications to Section 498A.

Amitava Gupta: Sometimes we come across cases where advocates have misled clients deliberately to earn more money.

 As a professional advocate, I would not accede to the fact that lawyers mislead their clients. It may so happen that he may make some procedural mistakes in filing petitions.

 For instance, an advocate should have filed a particular case in one court but may have filed it somewhere else. By the time the mistake is corrected, the client may have suffered a great deal. Except in cases like this, I don?t think any advocate would harm his or her career by misleading a client.

Subhayu Pal: Is the judiciary free from corruption? 

 There is corruption in all spheres of life and it would be impractical to think that the judiciary is free from it. The judiciary is the last resort of the common people, but, unfortunately, even the judges are not totally free from corruption. There are a number of instances where judges have been asked to resign after being found guilty on graft charges. 

Lalit Singh Nahar: Why is it that police do not give us a copy of the post-mortem report? My relative had an unnatural death. When the cops handed over the body for the last rites, they didn?t provide the post-mortem report. Isn?t this suppression of facts? 

 A post-mortem report is prepared by a doctor to help police learn more about a death. While probing a case, police have the right to suppress information before presenting evidence in court. Even the court can carry out investigation concurrently with the cops.

 It could be that in your case, the report was meant to be submitted before the court and that is why police didn?t provide you with a copy of it.

 Tvastr, the anchor store of Swabhumi ? The Heritage Plaza, is hosting two exhibitions simultaneously for the pre-Puja shopping season.

 The first one offers an entire range of cotton and silk saris, dupattas and stoles sourced directly from craftsmen in different parts of the country. 

 This includes south cotton, south silk, tussar, khadi, kalamkari, Bhagalpuri, tribal saris, chanderi and much more. 

 The second exhibition titled The Great Indian Bazaar is a showcase of handloom and handicraft products. The creations are displayed directly by the artisans at the craft gallery in Swabhumi.

 All the products have been sourced from artisans of various states. The proceeds from the sales will go directly to the craftsmen. This is the biggest exhibition that Swabhumi organises once every year, says Tazeen Choudhary, spokesperson for the heritage plaza off the EM Bypass. 

 Both the exhibitions will be on till October 7, two days before Mahasashthi.

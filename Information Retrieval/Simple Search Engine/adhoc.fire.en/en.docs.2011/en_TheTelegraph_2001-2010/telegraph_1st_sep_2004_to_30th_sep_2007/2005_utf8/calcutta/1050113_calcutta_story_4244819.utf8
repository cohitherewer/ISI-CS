The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

BY DEREK O?BRIEN

Is it the short winter or the shopping malls? Whatever 

be the reason, the Bhutanese woollen sellers are missing from the city. Even 10 

years ago, pavements were full of ?Bhutiya sweaterwallahs?. The coarse 

yet warm woollens of myriad colours no longer hang from pavement railings. Calcutta 

winter surely misses their broken Hindi, warm approach and above all, rock-bottom 

prices.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Filmi Funda

Pyaasa

Director Guru Dutt

Cast Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman and Mala Sinha

Plot Vijay (Dutt) is an unsuccessful poet who 

is torn between streetwalker Gulabo (Waheeda) and his ex-lover from college Meena 

(Sinha). What follows is an emotional turmoil between the poet, his private world 

and the world at large.

 The role of Vijay was first offered to Dilip Kumar, 

who rejected it as he found the character too similar to Devdas, which he played 

in the Bimal Roy classic in 1955.

 As for the two actresses playing Meena and Gulabo, 

Nargis and Madhubala were initially shortlisted but with the two undecided on 

which role to go for, Dutt went for relative newcomers in Mala Sinha and Waheeda 

Rehman.

 Pyaasa marked the last collaborative effort 

of the hit musical team of composer SD Burman and poet-lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi.

 SD Burman used one of son Rahul?s compositions Sar 

jo tera chakraaye that went on to become a huge hit, picturised on Johnny 

Walker.

 Veteran Bengali comedian Tulsi Chakraborty played 

a brilliant cameo of a rich babu. In the same year he played the protagonist in 

Satyajit Ray?s Parash Pathar.

 The man behind Pyaasa?s stunning images, Dutt?s 

regular cinematographer VK Murthy, was a violinist and a freedom fighter before 

he entered the world of films.

Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003)

Director Quentin Tarantino

Cast Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah, Lucy Liu, Sonny 

Chiba

Plot The Bride (Thurman) is attacked on the 

day of her wedding by her former boss, the master assassin Bill. When she wakes 

up after being in a coma for four years, she goes on a roaring rampage of revenge 

to kill all those involved in the wedding-day massacre.

 When The Bride stands over the remains of the Crazy 

88 killer squad, of the several masked men lying around, one of them is Tarantino 

himself.

 The masks that O-Ren Ishi?s (Liu) team wear are a 

tribute to the Green Hornet series, starring Bruce Lee, whereas the yellow 

track suit worn by Thurman in the same scene (and below) is a replica of the suit 

worn by Lee in Game of Death.

 The original story for Kill Bill was conceptualised 

by Tarantino and Thurman and so the credits will tell you: ?Based on a story by 

Q amp; U?.

 Tarantino wanted to make Kill Bill one six-hour-long 

film but at the instance of Miramax honchos Bob and Harvey Weinstein, he chopped 

the film into two parts. Contrary to popular misconception, Kill Bill Vol. 

2 is not a sequel to Kill Bill Vol. 1, but the second half.

 The Japanese version of the film is longer and there 

is no black-and-white respite for the audience as blood flows red and raw. 

 That The Bride?s real name is never mentioned is 

a tribute to the spaghetti Westerns where Clint Eastwood?s character was called 

Man With No Name.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Glitch bogs down cell service

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) has failed to fulfil its promise of providing 100,000 new Excel connections in October. Excel is the pre-paid mobile service of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited.

 Only 5,000 Excel connections could be provided in October, admitted CalTel officials on Thursday. 

 ?We are experiencing some technical problems due to the changeover in the network system. We will take care of the problem very soon,? Samar Kumar Chakravarty, chief general manager, CalTel, told Metro. ?We will clear the waiting list of subscribers in phases,? he added.

 While announcing the 100,000 goal on October 1, officials of the telecom service provider had said that the ?six-year delay in launching CellOne will be compensated in six months?. 

 Seven hundred towers are also due to come up in and around the city. 

 CalTel aims to expand the Excel customer base in Calcutta by 600,000 before March 31 ? a target unlikely to be met, given the tardy rate of progress.

 Excel was launched on May 12, 2004, with an Ericsson switching system. Till August 2005, CalTel had provided, on an average, 25,000 new connections per month. The technical glitches surfaced as the expansion of the network was undertaken to accommodate 600,000 additional connections.

 ?There are some problems in the integration of the two switching systems, that are affecting the services,? explained an official.

 According to sources, the integration problem is leading to frequent disruption of services. Profiles of subscribers are also getting deleted from the network, preventing them from making or receiving calls. 

 CalTel sources said there are a little more than 200 base transmission stations in its service area. The number is insufficient and as a result, network congestion is common, opined telecom experts.

 There are plans to set up 900 base transmission stations in Calcutta and its suburbs to solve the problem.

 The officials claimed that BSNL?s network would extend to the Metro Railway stations by December.

 DataOne broadband services offered by CalTel has also run into rough weather. 

 ?There are a number of complaints from customers regarding DataOne. Delays are common in getting connections,? alleged T.S. Srinivasan, secretary of Telephone Services Society. 

 The most common peeve against the service is that complaints registered at the 24-hour helpline are not looked into. Frequent disruption and drop in connection speed are the other irritants. ?There are some problems that will be sorted out soon,? assured CalTel officers.

 DataOne services were launched countrywide on January 14 this year, with bandwidths ranging from 256 kilobits per second to eight megabits per second.

 Civic top boss held guilty of contempt

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday found municipal commissioner Debashis Som guilty of contempt of court. 

 Som has been asked to attend court on Monday to receive his punishment.

 The municipal commissioner was found to have violated the court order asking him to withdraw the suspension of deputy chief engineer of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Dipankar Sinha and allow him to join his duties.

 ?The prosecution has proved that the municipal commissioner did not bother to carry out the order of the court,? Justice Girish Chandra Gupta observed in his order.

 The civic authorities are planning to move a higher bench against the order of Justice Gupta.

 ?We are waiting for mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s instructions,? a CMC lawyer said during the day.

 ?We will move a division bench against the order. It is untrue that the municipal commissioner did not allow Sinha to rejoin work after the court order. Sinha himself refused to join duty,? asserted chief law officer of the CMC Shaktibrata Ghosh late in the evening:

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said: ?This is purely an administrative issue. I do not want to interfere in it.? 

 In mid 2004, municipal commissioner Som had suspended Sinha for a year on charges of misconduct. 

 The engineer had moved court challenging the legality of the suspension letter issued by the commissioner.

 Appearing for Sinha, advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya had argued that Som did not follow the norms while suspending his client.

 ?The commissioner did not issue a chargesheet against Sinha before issuing the suspension letter. Moreover, Som made false allegations against the deputy chief engineer. Sinha had refused to accept some proposals of the civic body,? the lawyer claimed.

 Shakti Nath Mukherjee, the lawyer representing Som, had told the court that Sinha had failed to perform his duty.

 Fashion shows have made a comeback at Souravs: The Food Pavilion, this time in the middle of the week.

 Wednesdays are corporate nights. Besides good food and good music, watching a good fashion show is a nice way to relax in the evening for busy executives, says Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO, Souravs.

 This Wednesday saw models strut the dance floor in creations by designers Soma Chatterjee and Indrani Biswas. Traditional ethnic ensembles are Biswass forte, in crepe and georgette embellished with kantha and zardosi.

 Chatterjee, on the other hand, fused Indian and western styles, using net, crochet and jute.

 Hogging hilsa

 With the city finally getting a few showers, the monsoon mood has set in. And with it comes an appetite for hilsa.

 Oh! Calcutta, the Bengali speciality restaurant at Forum, has every Bengalis favourite fish on its menu in abundance till July 10. The Ilisher Mela has kicked off, with chef Joymala Banerjee cooking up a wide range of delicacies.

 Even the Indian options are likely to be novelties for most. Like Hilsa Tikka (boneless hilsa marinated with white sesame and black pepper, baked in a tandoor), Koromcha Lebu Pata Diye Ilish (stewed hilsa with turmeric, green chillies, sour berry and ghondoraj lime leaves) and Ilish Tramfradu (hilsa simmered with chopped onion, chillies, coconut milk and a dash of lime juice).

 Options with a British influence are also present, like the Phiringi Ilish (served boneless with cheese, parsley and white wine sauce), Ilish Anarash Curry (hilsa simmered with chopped pineapple, green chillies and traditional spices) and the Sizzling Hilsa (presented on a sizzler bed with caramelised onion and brandy).

 The preparations have been created in such a way that they appeal to everyone, and not just Bengalis, said chef Rajesh Dubey, director of food production, Speciality Restaurants, which owns the Oh! Calcutta brand.

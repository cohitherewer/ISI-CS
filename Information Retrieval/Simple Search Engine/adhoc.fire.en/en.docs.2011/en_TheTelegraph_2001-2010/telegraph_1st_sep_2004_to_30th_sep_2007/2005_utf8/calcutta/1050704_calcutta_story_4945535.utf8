The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spread of fakes under check

 R.K. ADHIKARY, formerly deputy commissioner (enforcement) and now special superintendent (intelligence), met readers of The Telegraph in his office on Wednesday to answer their queries. Participants included Sourish Misra, G. Laha, Basudeb Chowdhury, Ranajit Basu, Binay Mukherjee, Joyeeta Chatterjee and Sandip Banerjee

Binay Mukherjee: What is the function of your department? Is it the only department of its kind?

 Enforcement is one of the oldest branches of the city police. It was formed during the British era to enforce food control orders in accordance with laws of food and civil supplies. The department is now responsible for checking the spread of copyright-based counterfeit products in the market.

 There have been many changes in the functioning of the enforcement branch. Earlier, we had to work exclusively with food control orders, under the legal framework of the food supplies department. Several food control laws have been repelled, and we now enforce the Copyright Act, which empowers us to deal with fake books, CDs, building material and all other products protected by copyright or trademark.

 Though the focus has shifted, the nature of the job has become more rigorous as we now have to deal with cognisable offences. Our jurisdiction does not extend beyond the city limits, but we have a state wing headed by an inspector-general, assisted by several deputy inspectors-general and superintendents.

Sandip Banerjee: Is prevention of food adulteration part of your duties?

 The number of food items under our vigilance has been reduced, but we still look after products like baby food and kerosene oil distributed through the public distribution system. We also look into cases related to LPG cylinders used as domestic fuel.

Ranajit Basu: It seems that the entire retail market is flooded with counterfeits? 

 The situation is not as scary as you are suggesting. For example, the number of sellers of fake VCDs has reduced in the city, but might have increased in the fringe areas. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that if buying of fake VCDs stops, selling, too, will come to an end. To save a few rupees, people buy counterfeit products and thus help the growth of the grey market.

 There are nearly 400,000 shops selling counterfeits across the city. We regularly conduct raids and confiscate goods. Over the last six months, we have seized 135 inkjet cartridges, worth over Rs 2 lakh. In another raid, we seized 212 fake cameras, worth nearly the same amount. We have seized duplicate ceiling fans, motor belts and many other items. Last year, we had raided 45 places and seized CDs worth Rs 2.5 lakh and arrested 72 persons.

Ranajit Basu: What is the maximum punishment for someone found guilty of the most serious kind of food adulteration?

 In cases related to violation of essential food commodities Acts, one can be sentenced to a maximum of seven years of imprisonment. In copyright violation cases, the maximum term is three years.

 Earlier, cases could not be tried in enforcement courts where the judicial officer was lower in rank than additional district judge. Cases can now be tried in normal sessions courts. So there is a problem of trials taking a longer time and cases piling up.

G. Laha: Why don?t you distribute the seized goods among the poor?

 The items we seize become the property of the court. Usually, after a court order, we destroy the fake goods in the presence of a judicial officer.

 Among the seized goods, there are several items of utility, like books and pens, that can be used. Since a considerable volume of the seized goods is wasted in our office, we prayed to allow their distribution among the needy. Recently, we got a nod from the court and will soon distribute pencils and exercise books among poor children. That will not only benefit the children but help us clear our premises.

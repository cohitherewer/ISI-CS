The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beam block averted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A tribunal ruling has just saved the day for hapless television viewers caught in cable crossfire.

 Broadcaster STAR India was to switch off its channels on the network of multi-system operator (MSO) Indian Cable Net on Monday, affecting several lakh viewers in the city, over dues.

 The Telecom Disputes Settlement amp; Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), which was hearing a petition filed by Indian Cable Net, passed an interim order on Monday to avert the beam block.

 The tribunal asked the MSO to pay Rs 50 lakh to STAR in the next seven days and another Rs 50 lakh by the month-end. The next date of hearing has been set for January 4, 2006.

 Indian Cable Net informed TDSAT on Monday that it was unwilling to continue running STAR?s second package ? one of the contentious issues in the payment dispute ? with channels like STAR One and Hungama. The tribunal asked the MSO to return STAR?s decoder boxes.

 On STAR?s claim of an outstanding amount from the 7 per cent subscription hike mandated by Trai, TDSAT maintained that the issue was not part of the existing contract and asked the two parties to enter into a fresh contract from January 1, 2006.

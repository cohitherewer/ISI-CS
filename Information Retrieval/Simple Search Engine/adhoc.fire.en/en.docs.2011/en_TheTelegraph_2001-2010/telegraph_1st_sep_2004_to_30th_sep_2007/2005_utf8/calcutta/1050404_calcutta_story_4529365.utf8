Light up in subtle style

Lifestyle zone

ZEESHAN JAWED

Some places become popular not for the look they wear 

but by the virtue of what they sell. Mahal Lamp Shades at 227/2 Acharya Jagadish 

Chandra Bose Road may not be as chic as the new home stores in town, but for almost 

20 years, it has been the destination for quality lamps and shades. 

The shop, established in 1986, at any given point 

of time stocks more than 1,000 varieties of lamps in all shapes and sizes. 

?A couple of decades ago lights were hardly experimented 

with, considered to be a basic, essential element,? says Kishore Belani, owner 

of the store. ?But of late, people have realised the importance of lighting in 

their homes and offices. If the lighting is done properly, it can give a whole 

new dimension to your house. It also reflects the taste and the character of the 

owner,? he adds.

DECOR DICTATS 

The lighting accessories are broadly divided into 

modern and traditional. The decor and furniture of your home determines the lighting 

accessories that could be used. Go traditional if you have heavy, carved furniture. 

But if your home is filled with wrought iron, glass and steel pieces, then the 

modern lighting style would complement the mood.

CRYSTAL CLASS

Big chandeliers made of crystal add grandeur to a 

house and give an impression of royalty. But in the matchbox residences of today, 

there is hardly any space for such large, imposing installations. ?But people 

still prefer chandeliers. So for those who have small apartments, we have small 

chandeliers,? smiles Belani.

The smaller versions of the bigger varieties are available 

in crystal and glass. Besides, there are quite a few in floral, geometric and 

abstract designs, too. The chandeliers are also available in brass and wrought 

iron. The prices start from Rs 2,000 and run into lakhs.

LAMP LUSTRE

The lamp list runs long. Lamps are no longer restricted 

to table-top reading lights. Mahal is full of lamps for all parts of the home 

? from floor to fa?ade, garden to ceiling. Wall-mounted lights come in small, 

medium and big sizes. These can be matched with the chandeliers. The prices start 

at Rs 185. For table lamps, simple glass is pass?. Switch your attention to glass 

mosaic lamps. 

Study lamps and those with fabric shades are also 

available, priced Rs 250 onwards. Go in for floor lamps if you do not want the 

direct glare of the light to hurt your eyes. These are positioned on the floor, 

reflecting light off the ceiling, giving the room a softer glow.

Spotlights are also becoming popular with a growing 

number of people investing in art. Your latest purchases can be flaunted to full 

effect with spotlight shining down on it. The prices for these start at Rs 250 

onwards.

GLOBAL GLAM

Though Mahal has been around for 20 years, the Belanis 

have been in the business for the past 50 years. ?We also manufacture most of 

our products,? explains Belani. They also import exotic lamps and lampshades from 

Italy, China and Taiwan.

?This gives a good blend of national and international 

flavours and the buyers have more to choose from,? adds the proprietor.

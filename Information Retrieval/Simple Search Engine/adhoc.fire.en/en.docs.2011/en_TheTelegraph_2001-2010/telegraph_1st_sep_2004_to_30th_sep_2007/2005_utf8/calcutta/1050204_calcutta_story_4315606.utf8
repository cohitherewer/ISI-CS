 When Neha Singh got a call from Malaysian Airways, asking her to join as cabin crew, the would-be air hostess from Calcutta was thrilled. Her dream of working for a foreign airline seemed to have suddenly become a reality.

 With the government opening up the skies and foreign airlines invading the Indian market, the demand for Indian cabin crew, especially air hostesses, has taken off.

 Many foreign airlines have made it mandatory to have Indian air hostesses or stewards well-acquainted with Indian as well as global passengers. 

 In the process, they have made training of air hostesses and stewards, both by airlines and training institutes, one of the toughest jobs in the market.

 Some of the airlines that are asking for Indian women as cabin crew are Malaysian Airways, Cathay Pacific, UAE-based Etihad Airways, Yemen Airways, Singapore Airlines and Royal Jordanian. Several girls from the city and outside have already been recruited by these airlines.

 The girls have been offered pay-packets ? to the tune of Rs 18 lakh ? that were a distant dream for them till the other day. 

 As a result of the sudden spurt in demand for air hostesses from Calcutta and other parts of the country, institutes like Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training are gearing up to teach the Indian women the delicate art of hospitality on the air. ?We are the only training institute in the world to obtain an Airbus A-300 for in-flight training of air hostesses and stewards,? claimed Rakesh Agarwal, managing director of Frankfinn.

 ?We will also provide them in-flight training at high altitudes to ensure that they get to know the nuances of treating passengers in the best possible way, even under difficult circumstances,? added Agarwal.

 Indian Airlines is also making air hostess training a priority to bridge the gap between the cabin crew of foreign airlines and those operating in India.

 ?Indian girls have the ability to be counted among the very best,? said an Indian Airlines spokesman.

 Kill accused couple?s lawyer held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Pritha Nag murder case took a dramatic turn on Tuesday with the arrest of her sister Ileena Dasgupta?s lawyer by Criminal Investigation Department (CID) sleuths.

 Anish Biswas, the advocate, was arrested early on Tuesday from his CR Avenue residence and produced in the Bidhannagar sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s (SDJM) court, where he was remanded in police custody.

 ?Biswas has been arrested for trying to suppress facts in connection with the case. It seems that he was well aware of the murder,? said Durga Prasad Tarenia, inspector-general of police (CID).

 On April 19, 40-year-old Nag was found dead inside the flat of her brother-in-law Prabir Dasgupta, a senior official of the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), in Salt Lake.

 Prabir and wife Ileena were arrested on charges of murder.

 ?Although Biswas?s lawyer prayed for bail, we raised objections, since this is a case of brutal murder. There is a need for detailed questioning and several documents are to be recovered,? said Anjan Chowdhury, public prosecutor of the Salt Lake SDJM court.

 The magistrate granted the CID officials? prayer and set May 7 as the next date for appearance.

 Sleuths suspect that advocate Biswas knew about the husband-wife duo?s diabolical plan but had chosen to keep quiet. ?Investigations revealed that Biswas had helped the Dasguptas prepare forged documents,? said a senior CID official.

 On the day of the murder, Ileena went to 17F/1B, Dover Terrace, the sisters? ancestral home, and left with some jewellery and important documents in a few bags. ?There is evidence that Biswas was with her at that time,? added the CID official.

 ?After the murder, the Dasguptas called the advocate and asked him to arrange for a doctor to get Pritha?s death certificate. But he failed to do so and told the couple to get a doctor from Salt Lake,? revealed the official.

 Biswas allegedly prepared a false affidavit, in which Pritha had made certain ?confessional statements? regarding her involvement in the ?burglary? at the Dover Terrace address.

 CID sources said Prabir had forcibly got the affidavit signed by Pritha and submitted it to the Bidhannagar SDJM court on March 30.

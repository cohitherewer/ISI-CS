 LYFESTYLE ZONE 

 IPSITA DEB

 The 20-year-old internationally-acclaimed lifestyle label Tommy Hilfiger came to town earlier this year, becoming the first global fashion major to arrive in Calcutta. 

 And in less than six months, the store off Elgin Road is already making its presence felt as a fashion destination.

 Tommy Hilfiger is not just another apparel store, its a whole new way of life that we have gifted Calcutta, said Darshan Mehta, president of Arvind Murjani Brands Pvt Ltd, the company responsible for bringing Tommy to India. 

 The $1.9 billion global apparel firm is already wowing the Calcutta market with its veritable range of stylish western formals and casuals, sportswear, fragrances, cosmetics, fashion accessories and home linen.

 Inside out

 The 3,000-sq-ft store with its glass fa?ade and interesting array of mannequins looks impressive from the outside, with spacious interiors, teakwood flooring, leather upholstery and plush carpets adding to the effect. Cosy leather sofas complete the look. Books written by Hilfiger are displayed on the racks for the casual browser. Framed pictures that inspired him, along with a few guitars, adorn the walls.

 Garment stop

 Peppy sportswear in a variety of colours and chic styles is the mainstay of Tommy Hilfiger. Classic with a trendy twist is the style mantra.

 Women can choose from a wide range, be it the re-shaped classic polo-necks, paisley-printed tops, sporty capris with contrasting belts, striped tees or colourful shirts. 

 For men, cotton blazers, smart woven shirts and comfortable T-shirts are on offer. For those on a denim hunt, the options are truly impressive.

 Extra Edge

 Golfwear, swimwear, watches, sunglasses and bags ? the list of accessories is extensive, as is the variety.

 Trendy shades for men and women in classic ebony and chestnut hues, as well as more sporty reds, are good buys. Also at hand are womens bags in an array of colours, sizes and styles. In the footwear section, formal covered shoes, sandals and sneakers abound.

 Scent story

 Tommy and Tommy Girl are the designers signature fragrances, which have found favour with fashionistas globally. Apart from these, Freedom for both men and women is a new offering. An entire line of colour cosmetics can also be found on the racks.

 Home linen

 A new addition to the stock is a vibrant line of bed and bath accessories. Co-ordinated sets of bed and bath linen ? bathing robes and towels matched with bedsheets and pillow covers ? offer colourful options.

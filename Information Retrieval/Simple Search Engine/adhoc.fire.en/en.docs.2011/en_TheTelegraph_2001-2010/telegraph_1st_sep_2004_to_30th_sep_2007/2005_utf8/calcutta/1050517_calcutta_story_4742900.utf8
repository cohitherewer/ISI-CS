 Twenty eight shapely legs, a Russian babe and the soaring mercury... The heat was on at the DI May Queen Ball 2005 on Saturday night.

 The 48-year-old competition saw 14 girls vying for the prestigious crown which was once worn by the likes of Nafisa Ali. The DI May Queen Ball is different from most pageants. We work on the girls and groom them so if they participate in other beauty contests, they have an edge over other contestants, says a spokesperson of the club.

 For the first time, the ramp was constructed over the swimming pool. The contestants, all over 16 years, were groomed by Cynosure, an event management company, for six days prior to the decider.

 The walk to the prestigious title would see them go through three hours of wait and four gruelling rounds. 

 First, the contestants introducing themselves to the audience and the panel of judges, which included former cricketer Arun Lal, noted chef Shaun Kenworthy, model Jessica Gomes, beautician Bridget Jones and quiz wiz Derek Brien.

 Once the ice was broken and inhibitions shed, the talent round followed. Each girl was given 30 seconds to display her special skill. While some relied on their grey cells, others showed off some seriously raunchy moves to even more raunchy tracks.

 The decisive third round separated the real talent. Each participant was then faced with a question posed by the anchor. Soon, seven out of the 14 finalists were packing their bags. The question-and-answer round by the judges whittled the count down to three, but there was a tie for the crown. 

 If you were given a chance what would you call your city? Calcutta or Kolkata? was the tie-breaking query from Derek Brien. Calcutta would remain a city of joy irrespective of what it is called, was the smart reply from Pratibha Grewal, who walked away with the title and a return ticket to London.

 Ranu Jain was the first runner-up, with Aphra Williamson in third place. After the 14 girls stepped down, it was time for Russian dancer Jenny to hog the limelight.

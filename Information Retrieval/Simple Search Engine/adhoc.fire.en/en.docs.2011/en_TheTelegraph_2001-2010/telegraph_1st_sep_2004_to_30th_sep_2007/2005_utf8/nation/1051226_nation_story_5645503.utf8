 Aid comes first for faith groups

 Banda Aceh, Indonesia, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Buddhists run a camp for tsunami survivors in Islamic Aceh. A Mennonite family teaches English at a camp in Thailand. Christians put up homes in Sri Lanka and Jains build schools in Indias Nicobar islands.

 Drawn by a disaster of biblical proportions, religious groups flocked to the tsunami zone to give succour to the survivors and tried to provide answers to those who wondered about Gods role in the sudden, extraordinary event.

 The unprecedented tsunami, spawned by the strongest earthquake in four decades last December 26, did not discriminate: Muslims were swept away in Indonesia, Hindus carried off in India, Buddhists deluged in Thailand. Catholics and Jews visiting Indian Ocean resorts from Europe and America were also killed.

 Faith-based charities were among the first to come and are among the last to leave, performing the corporal works of mercy: feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless, healing the sick, burying the dead.

 Church-based and religion-based groups have more dedicated workers, said Sufi Pore, who heads the Indian Jain Organisations tsunami projects in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and who is himself a Sufi Muslim. We need people who will come six, nine months with dedicated zeal.

 Most faith-based groups try to keep their religious affiliation in the background. 

 US tele-evangelist Jerry Falwell was one notable exception, stirring controversy in January when he appealed for money and volunteers to go to tsunami-struck areas to distribute food, medical supplies and thousands of Gospel tracts in the language of the people, according to his website www.falwell.com.

 Its about compassion, not conversion, for most faith-based aid groups. 

 Thats important in places like the province of Aceh, where Islamic law is practised and religion is a highly sensitive issue. Students staged protests several months ago over rumours that a Christian group had distributed pills stamped with Mother Marys image.

 Taiwans Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation, which has been supplying tent camps in Aceh with food, water and other supplies, has plans to rebuild villages, including homes, mosques and schools, at an estimated cost of $27 million.

 As we all live on the same planet and breathe the same air, we are family, Tzu Chi founder Chen Yen said on its website www.tsuchi.org.When disaster strikes one region, everyone, everywhere ought to help.

 One evangelical group says it is getting its message across in a more subtle way. The walls of these homes continue to speak long after weve gone, said Service International director Trey Perry of the small, cement-block homes the St Louis-based group built in Hikkedua, Sri Lanka.

 Everyday, theyre going to wake up and know a group of Christians built a house. Thats pretty heavy evangelism. Its like St Francis of Assisi said: Everywhere you go, preach the gospel. And if you must, use words.

 Standing on a beach at Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, one pastor voiced what some evangelical Christians were saying about the catastrophe that killed more than 231,000 and displaced around 1.8 million people. It was a sign that these are the last days. You must prepare yourself to meet Jesus Christ. Repent for your sins.

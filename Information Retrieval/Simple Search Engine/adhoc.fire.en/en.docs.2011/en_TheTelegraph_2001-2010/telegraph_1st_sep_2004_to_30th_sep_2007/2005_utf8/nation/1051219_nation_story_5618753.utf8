 LS debate not just on Sourav 

 New Delhi, Dec. 18 (PTI): Ruling out any special discussion on former cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today said he had accepted a submission for a discussion on the future of Indian sport.

 It (the submission) was moved by an honourable member and the subject is good where parliamentarians will discuss on the future of Indian sports, Chatterjee told reporters. The submission for discussion has been accepted, he added.

 Chatterjees remarks came against the backdrop of a debate whether Parliament should take up issues such as cricket team selection.

 A motion was moved by Samajwadi Party MP Mohan Singh on Friday for a discussion on politicisation of Indian sport.

 Chatterjee said the discussion would not be exclusively on Sourav.

 Asked whether there would be a separate discussion on Souravs omission, the Speaker replied in the negative.

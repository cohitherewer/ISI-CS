 Marriage in mid-air

 Mumbai, Feb. 6 (PTI): This marriage got very close to being made in heaven.

 A couple tied the knot 2,000 ft in the air between two mountain ranges in Lonavala in Pune district today.

 A set of steel wires were tied point-to-point between two ranges of the Sahyadri mountains at Duchess Point. Hanging from the wires, Ashirwad Ayre and Bharati Patil, both 28, took the vows as a pandit chanted mantras.

 Dhumketu Trekking Club, of which the couple are members, had made the arrangements. 

 Ayre, an agent of the Road Transport Office, and Patil, an accounts executive from Shapur in neighbouring Thane district had met in April during a trek to Lingana.

 About 500 people, including local residents and tourists, witnessed the 30-minute wedding from Duke?s Nose and showered flower petals on the newlyweds.

 A team of Dhumketu trekkers had earlier scaled the peak to anchor the ropes and clear the viewing area.

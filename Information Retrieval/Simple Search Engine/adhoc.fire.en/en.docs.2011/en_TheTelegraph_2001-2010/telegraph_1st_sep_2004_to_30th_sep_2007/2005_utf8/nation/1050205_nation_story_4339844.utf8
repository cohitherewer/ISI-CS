 E-solutions for blocks 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 4: The Orissa panchayati raj department has decided to build an integrated IT infrastructure connecting all 314 blocks and 30 District Rural Development Agencies by Oracle Database and Oracle Application Server.

 Announcing this at a news conference this afternoon, panchayati raj minister Damodar Rout and Oracle managing director Shekhar Dasgupta said the IT infrastructure would help the panchayati raj department achieve better utilisation of funds, greater financial transparency and accountability and better management of social welfare schemes.

 The department is building this integrated infrastructure with the help of end-user Panchayat Accounting and Monitoring Software (Financial Accounting) and Payroll applications with the help of Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar and Orissa Computer Application Centre of the IT directorate of the Government of Orissa respectively.

 This is the first phase of a project with a vision to cover all the 6,234 gram panchayats in the state. 

 ?We are bringing all our global and Indian experience to help the department of panchayati raj in Orissa build the three-tier, web-based IT infrastructure with the objective of increasing citizens? return on taxes,? said Dasgupta.

 Panchayati raj secretary Swapneswar Baya said the e-governance project in the department is being taken up following a Supreme Court directive asking the states to place all wage employment projects detailing expenditure on websites. The court had also directed for installing a search facility for knowing the status of the expenditure.

 Baya said the department has already built two softwares ? Peoplesoft and Priasift ? that can monitor the flow of funds in various projects being executed. The department receives about Rs 900 crore annually to execute food-for-work programme.

 Dasgupta said Oracle has already helped in the implementation of over 2,000 e-governance projects. We are already involved in IT projects of over 50 government entities in the country, he added.

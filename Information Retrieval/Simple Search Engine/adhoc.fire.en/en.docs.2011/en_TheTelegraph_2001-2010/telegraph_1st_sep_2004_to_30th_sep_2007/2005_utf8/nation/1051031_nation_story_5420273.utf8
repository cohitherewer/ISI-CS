The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Gesture good, task still uphill

 Oct. 30 (Reuters): The UN welcomed India and Pakistans agreement to open the border to earthquake survivors and relief supplies but said getting aid to millions remained a logistical nightmare.

 The UN, which says the worlds slow financial response to the disaster is threatening lives, warned that huge difficulties remained.

 It (the agreement) will certainly not do any harm, but it will certainly not solve the logistical nightmare we are facing, said UN emergency coordinator Jan Vandemoortele.

 It is absolutely positive, but it will not turn mountains into plains. We are still planning to get a major airlift going throughout the winter.

 Natasha Hryckow, UN logistics coordinator in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan Kashmir, said the agreement should make a huge difference when it came to getting aid to people cut off near the border, such as in the Neelum river valley.

 If we had the potential to open it from the other side, we start getting road access to areas we can only fly helicopters to at the moment, she said. Thats obviously going to make a huge impact on how much we can shift in and how many people we can keep in those areas.

 Some Kashmiri families will undoubtedly benefit from the agreement, but large movements of people are unlikely given the massive damage to roads and the complex bureaucratic process involved in getting permission from both governments to cross.

 Amanullah Khan, head of the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, said only a few people would benefit, while the agreement could help make the contested border permanent. The benefit will be much less than the political costs.

 Not enough: Pope

 Saying not enough had been done, Pope Benedict renewed calls for the international community to swiftly and generously respond to the quake.

 There have been numerous kinds of solidarity, but the need appears much greater than the help offered so far. I renew, therefore, my appeal to the international community, the Pope told the faithful gathered in St. Peters Square.

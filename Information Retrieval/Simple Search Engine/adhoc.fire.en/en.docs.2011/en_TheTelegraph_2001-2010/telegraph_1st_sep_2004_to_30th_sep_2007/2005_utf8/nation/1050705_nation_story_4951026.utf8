 Science pact with stress on products

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, July 4: A hybrid electric vehicle running on solar power and batteries may be developed under a new Indo-Israel science and technology agreement kickstarted with a $2-million fund focused on products.

 India and Israel have contributed $1 million each to the fund that would be made available to entrepreneurs from both countries for research collaborations aimed at pushing technologies into the marketplace.

 The ministry of science and technology will seek government approval to raise the amount of the corpus to $25 million. The funds will be available only to entrepreneurs who agree to work on a product, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said.

 We want products in the market, not just agreements on paper, Sibal said.

 The Bangalore-based company that produces Reva electric cars may collaborate with an Israeli entrepreneur to develop a hybrid solar-electric car that uses solar panels to increase the distance available per battery charge, officials said.

 In the case of a solar-electric hybrid, the partner companies would need to find ways to place solar panels on the roof of an electric car or a bus.

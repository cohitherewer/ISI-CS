 BJP lands poster punch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: The BJP has complained to the Election Commission about the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s alleged use of posters depicting a victim of the post-Godhra riots during the Bihar election campaign and demanded the party be immediately de-recognised. 

 A BJP delegation, led by vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, called on the full commission today. It brought to the members? notice that proceedings had been initiated against Laloo Prasad Yadav when the election process began and the poll panel had declared that it was the last warning. The RJD president had been cautioned against politicising the findings of the Banerjee Committee report, which had probed the Godhra train carnage. 

 Despite that, the BJP told the commission, posters on Godhra and the subsequent violence were on display in Bhagalpur and other Muslim-dominated areas. ?This is yet another blatant and deliberate violation of the code of conduct and poses, as it were, a challenge to the authority of a constitutional body such as the EC. We urge the commission to take a serious view of this repeated breach of the code of conduct and take punitive action under the Elections Symbols Order against the RJD and its president,? the party?s memorandum stated.

 The poll panel assured the delegation that it would look into their complaint.

 Naqvi and the others also spoke of the burning down of a helicopter carrying former BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu to Gaya by suspected Left extremists. ?It is the responsibility of the EC to ensure the security of the central leaders campaigning in the state,? Naqvi told reporters after the meeting. 

 The BJP leader demanded that more central forces be despatched to Bihar and their deployment be directly supervised by the Election Commission because the ?objectivity and non-partisan attitude of the official machinery is a matter of serious doubt?.

 The party also asked the poll panel to engage ?total outsiders? to conduct the Assembly polls. They can monitor and curb Laloo Prasad, who allegedly gives directions to the administration and police, the leaders said, adding that special observers should be appointed with proven experience in handling law and order in ?sensitive? constituencies. 

 The BJP team also demanded a bar on issuing arms licences during the polls and said the commission should ferret out unlicensed arms and arrest ?anti-social elements? under the Goonda Act.

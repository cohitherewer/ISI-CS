The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Question hour, screen-savvy 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Somnath: Telly- smart

New Delhi, April 18: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee is trying to ensure that only issues of national importance are raised in Parliament, at least in zero hour that is telecast live.

 The second phase of the budget session of Parliament will begin tomorrow when the House reconvenes after a three-week recess. The session will conclude on May 13.

 Chatterjee will discuss his proposal to focus on matters of national importance ? instead of the trivial issues often raised ? with leaders of political parties, said sources in the Lok Sabha secretariat.

 If issues of national importance are raised, especially any developments taking place after the adjournment of the House for the day and before it meets the next day, these would also get wider media coverage, the sources said.

 The National Democratic Alliance tonight threatened to stall Parliament to press for the withdrawal of the second affidavit filed before the Supreme Court against former defence minister George Fernandes on weapons purchases.

 ?We will demand withdrawal of the fraudulent affidavit,? BJP spokesman V.K. Malhotra said after a two-hour NDA meeting at former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s residence attended by Fernandes, BJP president L.K. Advani and representatives of the Shiv Sena and the Biju Janata Dal among others.

 Malhotra said the NDA would also demand the Phukan Commission report on the Tehelka expose and the CVC report on defence deals be tabled in the House.

 The BJP leader said the matter would be raised forcefully. ?We will raise it at the beginning of question hour. If the Speaker allows, the House will function. Otherwise, there may be disruptions.?

 The Opposition is seeking the immediate tabling of the Nanavati Commission?s report on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

 The Opposition is also determined to move amendments to the finance bill seeking increased tax rebate for women, senior citizens and government employees, apart from demanding the immediate withdrawal of the tax on cash withdrawals.

 The focus, when the House takes up demands by ministries for grants, is likely to be on human resource development, with the BJP taking strong exception to the ?de-saffronisation? that is taking place.

 The Mayavati-led Bahujan Samaj Party is likely to highlight law and order in Uttar Pradesh. The party has been demanding the dismissal of the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in the wake of the recent murder of its MLA, Raju Pal, in Allahabad.

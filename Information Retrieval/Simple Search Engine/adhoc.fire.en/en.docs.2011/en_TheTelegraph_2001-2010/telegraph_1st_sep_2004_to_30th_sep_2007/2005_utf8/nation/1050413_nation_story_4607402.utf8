 Power pangs take Bihar to Centre door 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 12: Bihar is groping in the dark, literally.

 With the state reeling from an electricity crisis ? caused by inadequate power supply from Kahalgaon in Bihar and temporary shutdown of the Barauni and Talcher units (the latter in Orissa) ? the administration has approached the Centre for alternative arrangements. 

 The Talcher and Kahalgaon plants belong to the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) while the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB) runs the Barauni unit.

 BSEB chairperson and chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyan has asked the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) to release 100 MW of additional electricity to the state on an emergency basis. 

 ?We are negotiating with the PTC for some relief. We hope it will come soon,? Subramanyan said.

 While the power requirement is around 1,500 MW, the state has to make do with only 640 MW. The Patna Electric Supply Undertaking alone is short of about 100 MW.

 The administration, in its bid to overcome the crisis, has appealed to the public through an advertisement not to waste electricity.

 On an average, the state is experiencing six to seven hours of powercuts everyday. To make matters worse, water supply has been adversely affected in several places. 

 While it is unable to make successful alternative arrangements on its own, the state is planning to purchase power at a higher rate. 

 According to sources, the state had been counting on the Talcher unit of NTPC from where it purchased power at a rate lower than those offered by some of the other units. But the plant is closed on account of maintenance, adding to the state?s woes. Besides, a technical snag has forced the closure of the Barauni plant as well.

 Most parts of the capital have faced severe power problems for the past few days. The powercuts will continue for a few more days, sources said.

 Former chief minister Rabri Devi has appealed to Governor Buta Singh to take immediate steps to help the state tide over the electricity crisis. Former power minister Shyam Rajak has accused the administration of failing to manage the situation. 

 BSEB sources, on the other hand, blame the previous regime for the problems. ?The policies of the government are responsible for the power crisis today,? an engineer said.

 Rahul sows kisan card

 Rahul Gandhi being welcomed by villagers after inaugurating a kisan mela in Amethi on Thursday. The first-time MP, who is on a two-day tour of his constituency, said he would keep championing the cause of Uttar Pradesh farmers in Parliament.

 ?I have raised an issue in Parliament recently. I can assure you I will keep doing this to help farmers of the state get a fair deal,? he told the villagers during a 40-minute interaction.

 The March 21 speech in Parliament prodded mill owners to begin repaying dues to sugarcane farmers though the Samajwadi Party-led state government had claimed no dues were pending.

 Rahul also inaugurated an agro-product fair and a power project. The Congress leader stopped at a stall run by the Rajiv Gandhi Mahila Vikash Paryojna, which was started by sister Priyanka in 1999 to help local women earn a living by selling cottage industry products. The project has helped 12,000 Amethi families earn about Rs 1,000 a month.

 Rahul was given pickle to taste and was impressed by the range of products that included candles. (PTI picture)

 PMO nips Modi claim

 New Delhi, March 26: Narendra Modi?s second attempt to embroil Manmohan Singh in the controversy over foreign trips has not gone down well with the Prime Minister?s Office (PMO).

 Aware of the efforts of the Gujarat chief minister and the BJP to use for political ends Singh?s statement in Parliament against the US for denying Modi a visa, the PMO moved fast to nip a rerun in the bud.

 Modi claimed on Thursday night that he had called off his UK trip on the ?advice? of the Prime Minister following a phone call from Singh. The following morning, the PMO denied that Singh had called Modi.

 The chief minister?s office gave the impression that he was informed by the Prime Minister that there were intelligence reports from central agencies of a ?threat? to his life from radical Islamic groups which have a strong presence in the UK.

 The official version from Gandhinagar was that if Modi still wished to go ahead, the Prime Minister advised the Gujarat police chief to set up a control room and coordinate with the British high commission and the Indian security establishment.

 According to the Prime Minister?s media adviser, Sanjaya Baru, Singh did not phone Modi. He also denied that the Centre had any information on any kind of terrorist threat to Modi. 

 Baru said it was home minister Shivraj Patil who called Modi to tell him that as the Gujarat chief minister was going on a private visit, the UK government was not in a position to provide him with any kind of security. 

 Patil informed Modi that there were apprehensions of a law and order problem and, therefore, it was advisable for him to reconsider his decision to visit London.

 Making it clear that the decision to call off the trip was Modi?s, Baru said that thereafter, the chief minister rang up the Prime Minister to inform him that the trip had been called off. 

 Modi stuck to his guns and insisted that Singh had advised him to postpone the trip. A spokesperson for the chief minister described as ?highly unfortunate the denial of the facts? by the PMO

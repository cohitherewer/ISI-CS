 Mumbai, Sept 16: A schedule of one-day internationals and Tests played between March 1 and October 19 this year, a chart with 157 code names and aliases, code numbers, phone numbers and debit and credit card details. These were among the clues to an international betting racket found by the police as they arrested millionaire bar dancer Tarannum Khan and two bookies in an overnight swoop.

 Twenty-five-year-old Tarannum was picked up from her posh Versova bungalow at 5.30 am today, a fortnight after income-tax authorities raided her and seized Rs 22 lakh in cash. Bookies Milind Dheeraj Nandu alias DJ, 35, and Pradeep Kuvarji Parmar, 40, had been arrested around midnight. The trio were remanded in police custody till September 26.

 The police told the court they had seized several incriminating documents that were proof of widespread betting, as well as accessories like three Nokia mobile handsets without SIM cards, a 21-inch Optonica TV set, a Samtron monitor and three voice recorders. 

 Though these were found at Parmars home in Andheri, they belonged to DJ.

 Declaring DJs servant Bhavesh Upadhyay an absconder, the police said they were yet to recover a laptop that contained collated information about the betting ring.

 The police said they needed to ascertain the identities behind the 157 code names and aliases and probe their role. They said Khan and DJ had travelled abroad several times and they would be questioned about possible links with cricketers, international betting syndicates or terrorist organisations.

 The police also recovered a list of clients who had placed bets on the fourth Ashes Test in Nottingham at the mobile number 98209-57777. They seized a document dated August 28 that listed the bets DJ diverted to other bookies, along with the code names, numbers and expenditure charts.

 The police told the court that Tarannum had used her mobile number, 98200-97742, to place bets with DJ and that she had admitted to betting on the Ashes Tests.

 Defence counsels Satish Maneshinde, who appeared for Parmar and DJ, and Prakash Shetty, who appeared for Tarannum, argued that all the offences are bailable and none requires police custody for the accused. The court, however, rejected the bail applications.

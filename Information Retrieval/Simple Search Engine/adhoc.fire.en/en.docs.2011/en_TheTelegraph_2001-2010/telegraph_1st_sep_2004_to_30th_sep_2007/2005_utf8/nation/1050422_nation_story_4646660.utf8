 Hospital to pay for negligence

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer court has 

 found a private hospital in Uttaranchal guilty of medical 

 negligence and ordered it to pay Rs 1 lakh to the complainant. 

 The Mehta Charitable Hospital in Haldwani had failed to detect a kidney stone in Shanta Devi?s body for over a period of four years. The court directed that the compensation be paid with a 9 per cent interest. 

 The president of the National Consumer Disputes 

 Redressal Commission, Justice M.B. Shah, and member P.D. 

 Shenoy, upholding the Uttaranchal state commission?s order, 

 ruled: ?The complainant would not have suffered much if 

 the stone (in her kidney) was detected in time or if the 

 hospital had referred her to another hospital having a radiologist 

 in 1992 itself.? 

 ?During these four years from 1992 to 1996, it is very clear that the ever-growing kidney stone was causing physical and mental agony to the complainant and required treatment.?

 On May 14, 1991, a hospital doctor gave Devi painkillers and advised bedrest after she complained of stomach pain. In March 1992, another doctor failed to diagnose the problem. An ultrasound carried out in February 1996 revealed the presence of a large stone in the right kidney.

 The hospital argued that Devi said she had pain in the lateral portion of the stomach because of which the diagnosis could not be made. 

 Protests after rape amp; murder

 Jammu (PTI): The alleged rape and subsequent

 When he returned he found Seema missing and immediately lodged a report with the Chenani police station as he suspected nomads to have whisked her away.

 Seema?s naked body was found floating in the Tawi river by residents who informed the police, the sources said. Her body bore multiple stab wounds and the autopsy report confirmed the rape, the sources added.

 People from nearby villages placed Seema?s body on Dhar road at Salathia crossing and staged a demonstration demanding early arrest of the culprits.

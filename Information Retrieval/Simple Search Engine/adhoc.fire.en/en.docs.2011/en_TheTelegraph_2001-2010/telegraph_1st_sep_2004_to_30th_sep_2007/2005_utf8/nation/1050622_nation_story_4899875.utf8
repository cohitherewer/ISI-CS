 Silent cry for justice in exam murder

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 21: As the clock hands jerked to 11, hundreds of thousands of boys and girls in schools and colleges across Andhra Pradesh bowed their heads, their lips sealed in silent prayer.

 For the next two minutes, the only sound was the steady whirr of the ceiling fan and the horn of passing vehicles outside.

 The two minutes silence was to both remember Srilakshmi and to protest the delay in punishing the man who killed her with a kitchen knife for not reciprocating his feelings.

 The 23-year-old computer science student of Sharada College in Vijayawada was knifed by her classmate Manohar Prasad, a local Romeo, as she sat to write the final examination of the MCA course on June 21 last year. The time of the murder was 11.10 am, said T. Shakuntala, president of the state Mahila Samakhya, which co-ordinated todays protest across classrooms.

 Srilakshmi bled to death in the classroom as the authorities, scared of the scandal, refused to let her classmates take her to a doctor and locked the gates till police arrived.

 After the murder, which sparked a furore across the state, Prasad fled to Chennai. On June 29, he surrendered to Tamil Nadu police. His family and friends had refused to give him shelter.

 When Prasad was brought to Vijayawada from Chennai two days later, furious mobs staged demonstrations and blocked the police convoy at several places along the 400-km route. 

 The convoy left Chennai at 7 in the evening, hoping to avoid the crowds. But people waited through the night and hurled eggs, stones and slippers when the convoy entered the city close to dawn. At some places, people even attacked the convoy, forcing the police to form decoys to save Prasad from the crowds wrath.

 Such is the anger that even the bar association of Vijayawada has forbidden local lawyers from representing him. The case has been dragging for the past year and picked up pace only last week after a Dalit advocate, David Ratnakar, agreed to defend Prasad, who is also a Dalit.

 The state Mahila Samakhya has called for observing June 21 as anti eve-teasing and ragging day. It is in the fitness of things as Srilakshmi became a victim of unbridled eve-teasing, said woman activist Kalpana Kannabiran.

 Wiser after the Srilakshmi incident, Vijayawada police have made it mandatory for every college to have a complaints cell for women to hear cases of harassment. Each educational institution has been advised to directly inform the police commissioners office if they fail to get a response from local police stations.

 As another academic year began despite the scorching summer heat, the state government asked all colleges to be vigilant against ragging and sexual harassment. We will book cases against the colleges and the management if there are any serious instances, said city police commissioner Dinesh Reddy.

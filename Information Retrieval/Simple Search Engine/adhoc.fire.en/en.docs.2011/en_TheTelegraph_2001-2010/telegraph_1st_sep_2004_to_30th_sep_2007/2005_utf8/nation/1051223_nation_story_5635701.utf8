 Bush delay spoils Delhis plans

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: The 

 US President has put off his India trip by a month, upsetting 

 Delhis plans to appoint a new foreign minister as 

 soon as possible and reduce the Prime Ministers workload.

 The Centre had planned to shuffle the Cabinet immediately after George Bushs visit got over. Till then, Manmohan Singh would continue to hold additional charge of foreign affairs.

 But a government source today said Bush would arrive towards the end, rather than at the beginning, of February. It could be delayed even till the beginning of March.

 The Prime Minister has too much on his plate, a minister said. The coming year will see many high-profile foreign dignitaries visiting India. After President Bush, its the Saudi Premier, then the Irish Prime Minister. We must find a permanent solution for the foreign office.

 Also, after P.M. Sayeeds death, the Cabinet needs a Muslim face. Sources said recent events had improved Salman Khursheeds chances to become foreign minister. But there is doubt over which state would elect him to the Rajya Sabha.

 The Centre would have liked to see Bush arrive on schedule, and then get to work sorting out these problems.

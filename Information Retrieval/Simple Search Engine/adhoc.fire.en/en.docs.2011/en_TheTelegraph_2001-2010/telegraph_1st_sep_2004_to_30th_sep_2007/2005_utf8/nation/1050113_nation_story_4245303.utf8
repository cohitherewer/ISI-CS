 Maoists in unity bid

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Jan. 12: In a development of seemingly far-reaching consequences, the Communist Party of India (Maoist), has declared a ?unilateral ceasefire? with rival Naxalite outfit CPI (ML). 

 The decision can hold out hope for the Magadh and Bhojpur regions of Bihar, which have witnessed a bloody turf war between the two outfits in the past few years.

 A news release issued late last evening by the general secretary of the CPI (Maoist), Ganpati, said the outfit has taken the decision in a bid to put an end to casualties suffered by the two ?class allies? and concentrate on the larger objective of the Naxalite movement.

 However, the statement also makes it clear that the Maoists have not reconciled to the existence of the CPI (ML) in its current form. They have vowed to ?unmask CPI (ML) leaders?, adding that revisionists in that party were helping the class enemies and landlords by ?engineering disunity? among the radical Left forces. Since the turf war has suited the designs of landowners and ?exploiters?, the Maoists have decided in favour of a ceasefire, the release said.

 The Maoists have also come down heavily on the protagonists of ?soft? Marxism-Leninism, who have joined the mainstream and opted for electoral politics. The CPI-ML, it may be recalled, disbanded its armed squads a few years ago and decided to contest Assembly and Parliamentary elections.

 The statement, while maintaining that the leadership of the CPI (ML) is unlikely to give up its ?derailed? path, adds that the Maoists will establish direct contact with the people to ?expose revisionists and counter-revolutionaries? instead of engaging in a violent battle.

 The news release also reiterated the Maoists? opposition to the electoral process and said only an armed struggle could retain what it called the ?legacy of Naxalbari? and achieve its objectives. 

 The statement identified Masaurhi, Arwal, Jehanabad and a few other places as the main of areas of conflict between the two outfits.

 Atal sees dangers ahead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 20: Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today said parts of the joint statement signed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President George W. Bush on nuclear technology were fraught with dangers. 

 Vajpayee (in picture) insinuated that Indias sovereignty has been compromised. 

 The NDA chairman questioned Indias offer to identify and separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities and programmes and said this had long-term national security implications.

 Military programmes were a small fraction of Indias nuclear facilities, Vajpayee said, adding that segregating the civilian from the military would be very difficult, if not impossible, involve prohibitive costs and deny the country flexibility in determining the size of its nuclear deterrent.

 Although the BJP believed in minimum credible deterrent, its size must be determined periodically on the basis of our own threat perception, he said. This is a judgement which cannot be surrendered to anyone else.

 India had jumped the gun by accepting a crucial provision of a future fissile material cut-off treaty even before such an international pact had been enforced by other nuclear-weapons states, he said.

 The BJP leader also questioned Indias offer to sign and adhere to an additional protocol on civilian nuclear facilities. Such an additional protocol will, by its very nature, be more intrusive since it will allow international inspectors free access to our nuclear facilities anywhere, anytime.

 Vajpayee signed off, saying: The Bush administration may have recognised India as a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology, but it is far from recognising India as a legitimate and responsible nuclear-weapons state.

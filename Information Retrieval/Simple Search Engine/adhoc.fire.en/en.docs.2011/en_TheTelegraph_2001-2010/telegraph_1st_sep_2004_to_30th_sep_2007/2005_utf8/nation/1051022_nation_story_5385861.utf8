 US vow to deliver on nuke deal

 New Delhi, Oct. 21 (PTI): The US today said it is committed to implementing the nuclear deal with India and hoped modalities for resumption of supplies to Indian reactors will be in place before President George W. Bushs visit next year. 

 US under secretary of state Nicholas Burns, who held day-long talks with foreign secretary Shyam Saran, said: We are not adding any conditions.... We Americans will meet the obligations we have undertaken. He hoped India would, too.

 At a joint news conference, they said both sides were committed to implementing the July 18 understanding reached in Washington between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Bush but added it was a very complex and complicated issue.

 The talks will continue tomorrow.

 On fears that the US Congress will not consent to resuming nuclear supplies to Indian reactors, Saran said there is significant support for it on Capitol Hill and he did not see opposition by a few becoming an impediment. 

 The US legislation should be in place early next year, he said, and hoped an agreement would be ready by March, in time for Bushs visit.

 Saran said India had certain responsibilities to carry out and we have delivered on some of them. 

 We are already conforming to and becoming partner in global non-proliferation regime, the foreign secretary said.

 Honour for forgotten hero 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 30: Like most honours, this one too came late. 

 Decades after Raghu Nayak overpowered Mahatma Gandhi?s killer Nathuram Godse, automobile giant Daimler Chrysler today paid its humble tribute to the man.

 Bernd Adler, country representative of the country, unveiled a fibreglass bust of Nayak along with a statue of the Mahatma at Jaguleipada village in Rajkanika block of Kendrapara district.

 The bust, built by students of the Bhubaneswar-based Sudarshan Art and Craft College, has a marble base and the famous charkha, which symbolised the Gandhian concept of swadeshi.

 Nayak, a gardener at Birla House, had caught Godse after the assassin had fired lethal shots at the Mahatma on January 30, 1948. 

 ?The Germans have a lot of respect for the Mahatma and are in awe of his non-violent ways. You will find books on him in all their bookstores,? said D.K. Rout, a bank officer of Puri, who took the lead in installing the bust with his German friend and journalist Hilmar Koenig.

 But till today, Nayak was an unsung hero except in his own village, Jaguleipada, where local people tried to keep his memory alive. The only encomium had come from then President of India, who awarded him Rs 500 and a certificate of honour. 

 After the death of Gandhi, Nayak returned to Orissa in 1955 and lived with his wife on a paltry pension of Rs 50 per month. He died at the age of 72 in 1983. 

 Daimler Chrysler came to know about Nayak after an Indian newspaper published an article on the gardener. Soon after, Koenig got in touch with Adler. 

 ?We visited Jaguleipada and finalised the project after receiving the nod from the local people as well as the district administration. We thought it was a fitting tribute to the son of the soil,? Rout said. The Gandhi-Raghu Smriti Committee also helped in installing the bust.

 ?He was the person who served goat?s milk to the Mahatma everyday and served him religiously. His own country did not give him any recognition but the world recognised his heroic deed,? said Mandodari, Nayak?s widow.

 Despite the honour, life is not likely to change for Mandodari and her daughter, who live in a thatched house. The widow gets a pension of Rs 25 every month.

 Nayak?s son is a driver with Orissa police and is posted at Jeypore.

 New Delhi, March 2: The BJP sought the immediate intervention of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to ?redress? what it said was a ?brazen assault on democracy? by Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi. 

 An NDA delegation told Kalam they were ready to parade the 41 MLAs (36 of the BJP-Janata Dal (United) and five Independents) the same way N.T. Rama Rao had lined up his flock of 164 in Rashtrapati Bhavan when his government was unseated by Indira Gandhi in 1984. Rama Rao?s triumphant return within a month had heralded the rise of regional parties and exposed the role of Raj Bhavans in political shenanigans.

 The BJP hoped the President would act according to the precedent set by his predecessor, K.R. Narayanan, who reinstated a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh in 1999 which was dismissed by the governor despite proving its majority on the floor of the House.

 ?We have sworn allegiance to the Constitution but it is the President who takes the oath of protecting and defending the Constitution,? said BJP chief L.K. Advani, who was part of the delegation led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 According to Rashtrapati Bhavan sources, the President is examining the memorandum submitted by the NDA. Home minister Shivraj Patil met Kalam shortly thereafter and briefed him.

 The NDA also forced the adjournment of both Houses of Parliament to protest the ?delaying tactics? of Razi and declared that it would stall their normal functioning till its government was installed in Jharkhand. BJP leaders admitted in private that they smelt ?mischief? the moment the services of Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi were marshalled in Ranchi. 

 Even so, the BJP?s strategists reckoned that they could not be outflanked by the ?other side? because the NDA was numerically ahead of the Congress-JMM alliance and had emerged as the nucleus for a ?stable? alliance.

 Its ?sharp-shooters? from Delhi, including M. Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh and Ananth Kumar, were constantly monitoring the developments.

 When Razi invited Shibu Soren to form a government, the BJP was caught by surprise. A flummoxed Advani told reporters the action was ?unprecedented? and he feared that it might be replicated in Bihar where Laloo Prasad Yadav has coaxed a letter of support from a reluctant Congress.

 ?The governor has the discretion to judge who has the majority. On the basis of the election results, he should have exercised no option other than inviting the leader of the BJP-Dal (U) combine,? he said.

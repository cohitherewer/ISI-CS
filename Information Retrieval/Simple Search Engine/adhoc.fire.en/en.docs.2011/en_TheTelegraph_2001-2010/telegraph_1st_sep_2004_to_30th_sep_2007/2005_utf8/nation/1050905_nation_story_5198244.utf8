 Singh puts seal on ship canal dredging

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 4: Work on the Suez of the East will not stop.

 The Sethusamudram project to dredge a navigable channel between the countrys east and west coasts got another boost from the man who inaugurated it ? Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The project will alter transport systems in the region, Singh said to underline its continuity at a book-release function yesterday. The assertion came a day after Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa urged the Centre to immediately stop the project as it would affect marine life and threaten the business of fishermen.

 Those in favour of the project say once the 167-km channel is ready, freighters sailing between Indias west and east coasts will no longer have to detour around Sri Lanka, saving up to 30 hours of sailing time.

 Earlier, Singh inaugurated the Rs 47-crore National Institute of Siddha in suburban Tambaram here, the first research centre of its kind in the country to scientifically validate this ancient Tamil system of medicine. Jayalalithaa, who was scheduled to attend the inauguration, stayed away for health reasons.

 DMK chief M. Karunanidhi today criticised Jayalalithaa for not participating. But he said it would have been surprising had she turned up because ignoring senior leaders and behaving arrogantly has been her wont.

 Natwar adds steam to Kofi reform cry

 New Delhi, April 27: India today added voice to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan?s concern that the process of consensus-building on the proposed expansion and restructuring of the world body should not ?become a vehicle for inaction?.

 Along with Germany, Brazil and Japan, India is a contender for a permanent seat in the Security Council.

 Annan, who arrived here yesterday, held meetings with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani.

 But the secretary-general?s detailed talks were with the foreign minister K. Natwar Singh. The two spoke for over 90 minutes and continued talks over lunch hosted by Natwar.

 The free-wheeling discussion allowed them to exchange notes on Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, South Asia and a host of other issues. But the focus was on the restructuring of the UN.

 Both agreed there was a groundswell of support among the majority of UN members for restructuring the world body to reflect the present-day reality and to be more effective in meeting new challenges. 

 Natwar agreed with Annan?s view that to arrive at a consensus on reforms and restructuring, members should be aware that it does not become an excuse for some to delay the process. Both felt concrete steps in this direction should start by September when the General Assembly meets in New York.

 The Group of Four ? that of India, Japan, Germany and Brazil ? has agreed to pool in resources and support.

 Although India is confident of getting the support of a large number of member nations, including most of the five permanent, Delhi realises the difficulties in reaching a consensus. 

 It has been trying to convince like-minded countries that the better option would be to get the majority of the countries to support the proposal for reforms in the UN, including in the Security Council.

 Delhi is also aware that a permanent seat may come without veto power, though its official line is that there is no question of accepting any discrimination between the old and new permanent members.

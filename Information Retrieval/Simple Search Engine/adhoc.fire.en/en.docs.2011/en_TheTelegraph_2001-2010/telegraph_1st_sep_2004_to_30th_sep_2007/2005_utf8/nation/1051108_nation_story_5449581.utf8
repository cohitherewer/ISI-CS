 Phase of intensive exchanges takes off

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Nov. 7: Indian and US air forces today began a series of fighter aircraft drills with the F-16 Fighting Falcon as the centrepiece despite protests from the Left. 

 This edition of the Cope India series of exercises marks the beginning of the most intensive phase of Indian and American military exchanges that involve joint training, manoeuvres and sales of high-technology equipment and expensive war machinery.

 In a statement in Delhi today, the US embassy said the Kalaikunda exercise is the second bilateral dissimilar air combat tactics field training exercise. 

 The exercise will provide valuable training for aircrew and maintenance personnel, and enhance military-to-military relationships between the US and Indian air forces. By conducting fighter operations together, the USAF and IAF are promoting cooperation and regional stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

 The exercise that began in Kalaikunda today has three immediate objectives: 

 To familiarise the IAF with the F-16 Fighting Falcon ? an aircraft that it is considering for purchases in bulk

 Familiarisation with the E-3 Sentry Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft for beyond visual range experience

 Learn from mutual experience for future joint operations

 Familiarising the F-16 is a priority for the US because an Indian Air Force order of 126 aircraft ? that is currently being processed ? worth more than $5 billion can prove a windfall for any military aviation company. The F-16 is competing with at least five other types of aircraft and Washingtons campaign with the aircraft is the shrillest.

 A team from Lockheed Martin and the US ambassador in India are expected to be in Calcutta and Kalaikunda during the exercise. The IAF is keen on exercising with the E-3 Sentry because that is a capability its fighter aircraft squadrons are not equipped with.

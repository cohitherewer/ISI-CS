 Bengal hit, Left rings in phone truce 

 OUR BUREAU 

 March 23: The work-to-rule agitation by BSNL executives was withdrawn today after the Left played a key role in calling a truce.

 Officials said the strike came to an end with the intervention of Union minister for communication Dayanidhi Maran, but it was Left leaders who were instrumental in convincing the unions to relent.

 Maran and the union leaders were joined at the bargaining table by CPM?s leader in the Upper House, Nilotpal Basu. The agitation?s bite had been felt most in the CPM?s bastion -- Bengal -- and this is being seen as the primary reason that prompted the Left to start the ball rolling in controlling the strike. 

 The problem was so acute in Bengal that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had sought Maran?s intervention. The protest by nearly 50,000 BSNL executives, including 4,000 in Bengal, had caused widespread disruption in the basic telecom services and some mobile networks.

 ?We have told them their demands would be heard and asked them to call off their strike in the larger interest of the public,? Maran said in New Delhi. 

 Basu said: ?We are happy with the development. We now want the minister to look into the genuine grievances of the workers.? The executives had sought among other things better promotional avenues.

 A.K. Sinha, the chairman and managing director of BSNL said a committee of four senior officers has been formed to look into the issues. The panel, after discussions with the executives, will submit a report in three weeks.

 The chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones, S.P. Chakravarty, said: ?Both landline and mobile services will be restored to normal by the end of the day. However, some problems could persist due to congestion till tomorrow.?

 Relief offer

 CalTel has also decided to give full rebate to incomplete calls from CellOne postpaid phones below a 15-second duration.

 ?Calls below the 15-second duration made during the disruption period will not be charged. Also the grace period for CellOne users has been extended from March 15 to 31,? said Chakravarty. BSNL cash counters will be open this Sunday.

 Cyber city sexes up for its night out

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Open to change? 

 Hyderabad, June 29: When other cities wake up for their night out, Hyderabad sleeps.

 Maybe, not any more. 

 If all goes well, Hyderabadis, so long used to calling it a day by 10.30, could soon awake to the pleasures of a midnight swig.

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has set up a committee to visit all the metros in the country and recommend steps to make Hyderabad a favoured destination for software professionals and domestic and international tourists.

 The Andhra Pradesh governments move has been prompted by frequent complaints from infotech professionals and tour operators, who say they are losing out on vital business because the city hits the bed a tad too soon.

 While major towns and metros in the country wake up to a life of dancing, entertaining and shopping, Hyderabad goes to sleep at 10.30, said Ruksana Ali Khan, a tour operator.

 Only a few bars and pubs in star hotels are allowed to stay open till midnight while the rest of the 250 bars and restaurants in the capital have to down shutters by 10.30. Police harass and abuse the customers if anyone is found in bars after that, complained Sanjay Chinmani, owner of a city bar.

 Software professionals say they are losing clients. It is particularly difficult for the software industry where we have to work according to the time zone of our clients. Skilled workers choose Bangalore and Mumbai which have initiated measures to promote a longer night life, said Anil Kumar Jampala of the Hyderabad software exporters association.

 The rigid timings forced three major conventions of the IT and manufacturing sector to be shifted out of Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. 

 Last week, a delegation of CEOs of multinational IT companies and tour operators led by state tourism minister J. Geeta Reddy met the chief minister. They pleaded that bars, shops, restaurants, liquor shops, bakeries, gyms and video parlours be kept open till 2 am for the benefit of tourists and IT professionals who work late night shifts.

 Union tourism minister Renuka Chowdhary also supports the demand. She has urged the state government to open up night bazaars and conduct cultural activities that begin at 10 pm. Hyderabad receives six flights, four trains and 110 buses after midnight, she pointed out. Why not provide them some facilities?

 Now the Congress-led government is all set to relax the rules. It also has plans to permit a bar and restaurant for every 25,000 people and liquor shops proportionately.

 Told of the possibility, Imranullah Khan, an IT exporter who runs a call centre, almost drooled in anticipation. What a delightful proposal, he said. Despite being a Hyderabadi, for nearly five months I havent tasted biryani. Either I am too late or too early.

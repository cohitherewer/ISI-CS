 Sikh tourists handcuffed at Times Square

 AMIT ROY 

 London, July 26: It is a wonder some nervous American did not call police to say there was a suspicious looking alien in a funny blue turban wandering the grounds of the White House and even seen accosting President George W. Bush. 

 In one respect, Manmohan Singhs visit to Washington appears to have done no good at all ? some Americans still cannot tell Sikhs from bin Laden look-alikes.

 The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was yesterday forced to apologise to a group of five British Sikhs who were hauled off a sightseeing bus, forced to kneel on the pavement and handcuffed. 

 Their initial pleas that they were Sikhs failed to impress the police who have been jumpy since the attacks in London on July 7 and 21. 

 The five holidaymakers from Birmingham have not returned home to the UK yet but their plight has been the main front page story in the New York Daily News under the headline: Five tourists are detained during Sundays scare in Times Square. 

 In Britain, there has been a report of a minor attack on a gurdwara but it has to be said for the British that they have a high regard for the Sikhs, not least because they fought alongside them in two World Wars. 

 The Sikhs are the only group which doesnt have to wear crash helmets when they ride motorbikes in Britain. 

 Todays Daily News reported that Mayor Bloomberg apologised yesterday to a group of British tourists who were handcuffed and forced to kneel on a Broadway sidewalk after cops swarmed a sightseeing bus. 

 The paper said: The mayor urged New Yorkers to call authorities if they see something suspicious, but added they should use common sense and avoid profiling people like the group of South Asian-looking visitors, who were Sikhs from Britain. 

 Its a shame, and I certainly apologise on behalf of the City of New York. We love tourists and we want them to keep coming here and feel that they can go around and enjoy the city, Bloomberg said. 

 The five British tourists left the Big Apple yesterday, feeling pretty small. They are continuing their US trip, and one said the incident didnt spoil their time in the city.

 These things happen, dont they? said the man, who gave his name as Jas, 39. We have no hard feelings. It certainly made our trip different, but didnt ruin it at all.

 The men were shaken when they were taken off the bus by heavily-armed policemen after a Gray Line worker called the police to report that the tourists seemed suspicious. The mens hands were bound behind their backs and they were forced to kneel on Broadway between 50th and 51st Streets. 

 Other terrified tourists had to walk off the double-decker bus with their hands up while their bags were searched. 

 Jas said he planned to return to New York in December to celebrate his 40th birthday. Im definitely coming back, he said.

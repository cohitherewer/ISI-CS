 Churchill poser on smoking ban

 New Delhi (PTI): Can there be a film 

 on Winston Churchill without his signature cigar?

 The question came from a high court bench to additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra during Tuesdays arguments on producer-director Mahesh Bhatts plea against the Centres ban on on-screen smoking from October 2.

 quot;Smoking is not banned in life. How can 

 you ban it in cinema? it asked. It was only 

 possible in Utopia. When Malhotra said smoking on 

 screen affects those of impressionable age, the court shot 

 back: Why dont you ban it altogether?

 The bench said artistic expressions required things to be shown in the natural course of action. You cant make a film on a college hostel without showing smoking. 

 The court has asked the ministries of health and information and broadcasting to file their replies to notices on Bhatts plea by September 30. It has made clear it would like to decide the issue before October 2.

 Congman booked for gaffe

 New Delhi: Requested to release a partymans 

 book on Sonia Gandhi, Rajasthan Congress chief B.D. Kalla 

 had eagerly grabbed at the chance to earn some brownie points, 

 reports our special correspondent. 

 Its what Sonia Gandhi and Indian Politics contains that is making the ground shake under his feet.

 Author Manchand Khanela, a vice-president with the state units think-tank, rubbishes Sonia and finds BJP leader Sushma Swaraj a far better leader. Sonia is mocked as maharani and son Rahul as rajkumar. He detects only self-interest behind Sonias renunciation of the Prime Ministers post in May 2004.

 The AICC general secretary in-charge of the state, Mukul Wasnik, is believed to be looking for Kalla.

 False case cry

 New Delhi (PTI): A woman has told a court 

 that police wrongly registered a case of sexual assault 

 against her then boyfriend, now her husband.

 In an affidavit, the woman said she had gone to the police station to file a complaint that her boyfriend had refused to marry her but the police had registered a case of kidnapping and rape. She also said the police had shown her as a minor, though she was 19.

 Blame on Saroj

 Mumbai (PTI): Producer B. Chopra has filed a case against choreographer Saroj Khan for not completing the choreography for his latest film, though she was paid in advance. Khan was to choreograph three songs for the film Chand ke Paar Chalo at the rate of Rs 1.70 lakh per song.

 Ayodhya probe 

 Ayodhya (PTI): The duration of the magisterial 

 inquiry into the July 5 terror attack on the Ram Janmabhoomi 

 complex has been extended by a week. The statements of three 

 policemen have been recorded. The extension was ordered 

 to record deposition of some more police personnel.

 The India-Pakistan ceasefire along the Line of Control has completed 21 months without any exchange of fire between the Indian and Pakistani troops or any other violations.

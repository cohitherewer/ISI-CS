 Navy team to bring alive US military sales

 A P-3C Orion: India bound?

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: A US offer to transfer P-3C Orion long-range maritime surveillance aircraft to the Indian Navy is expected to reboot American military hardware sales to India shortly. 

 Despite a dramatic increase in military-to-military ties, the only major military hardware procured from the US in the last four years are the first of 12 AN/TPQ 37 Firefinder weapon locating radars to the Indian Army.

 The P-3C Orions being negotiated have been phased out by the US military and kept in reserve. The Indian Navy has projected the need for the long-range aircraft to fill the gap in its maritime spying ability caused by the loss of two IL-38 Soviet-origin aircraft to a mid-air collision in 2003. 

 The navy first evinced interest in the P-3C Orion aircraft in the late 1990s but the talks did not get off the ground because of sanctions after the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests.

 A US Navy team is likely to make a formal offer to the Indian Navy which has enquired about the possibility of leasing two P-3C Orions with an option of acquiring eight more. 

 The Pakistan navy is also in talks with the US to acquire P-3C Orions.

 The demand for P-3C Orions is being justified by the Indian Navy as a requirement borne out of its enhanced policing role in the Indian Ocean region. The navy operated with the P-3C Orions during the Malabar series of exercises with its US counterpart. 

 The aircraft have long endurance and will give the navy the ability to operate and observe far beyond its territorial waters.

 The navy is in talks for 10 retrofitted P-3C Orions manufactured by Lockheed Martin, which also makes the F-16 fighter aircraft in contention for an Indian Air Force order.

 US embassy officials said the first of four Firefinder radars were already in operation with the Indian Army. Three more have been completed by Raytheon Corporation and will be delivered soon. 

 Like the Firefinders, the P-3C Orions are also likely to be through a government-to-government deal under the Pentagons Foreign Military Sales programme.

 The Indian Navy is also in talks to procure a deep sea rescue vehicle for its ageing fleet of submarines, a mine hunter ship and a landing ship tank.

 In March, Jeffrey Kohler, the Pentagon official in charge of military sales, will return to India for briefings on missile defence and multirole combat aircraft.

 On Indias request, the US is also likely to arrange for a special briefing on the joint strike fighter later in March.

 A multinational Pacific Military Medical Conference would also be arranged in New Delhi in March and would be coordinated with the Indian defence ministry and the US Pacific Command.

 The officials said the India-US High Technology Cooperation Group was working on licences for US defence exports to India.

 Troops on AIDS radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The public accounts committee of Parliament has recommended that recruits in the army and paramilitary forces as well as troops separated from families should be considered groups with a high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.

 As of now, the National AIDS Control Organisation includes only truck drivers, sex workers and intravenous drug users as high-risk groups in its AIDS control programme.

 The committee today submitted in the Lok Sabha its report on the National AIDS Control Programme with some scathing observations on the way the scheme is being run. Chairman Vijay Kumar Malhotra said one of the most important areas to be addressed is to broaden the definition of high-risk behaviour.

 New high-risk groups should include recruits to the army and paramilitary services and troops living in foreign countries, Malhotra said.

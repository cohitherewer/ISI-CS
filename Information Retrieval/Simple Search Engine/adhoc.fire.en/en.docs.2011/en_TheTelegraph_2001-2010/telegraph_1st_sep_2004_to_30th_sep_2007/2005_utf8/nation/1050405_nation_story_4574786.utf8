 US wings in Indian sky

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, April 4: Two major US airlines ? Northwest and American Airlines ? are slated to fly into India soon.

 This could lead to a dogfight in the skies, with Air-India and European carriers which fly Indian passengers to the US after giving them a break in an European city such as Amsterdam, Frankfurt or London, being forced to slash prices to cope with competition. The private Indian airline, Jet Airways, is also set to join the war this winter.

 Prices could be cut by as much as 20 per cent on this vital route, claim tour operators and aviation analysts. These airlines fly from cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Minneapolis. 

 ?If any of them offers direct flights, then the fun will really begin. Because those who are offering flights via European cities will have to drop prices to compete with these far more convenient direct flights,? said Debasish Chatterjee of CTI Travels.

 The US transport department has given the two airlines permission to negotiate with Indian authorities on flight schedules and slots under a limited open sky policy, which the two countries will be formalising soon. 

 The two airlines are entitled to fly any number of flights to any major Indian gateway city, subject to allotment of flight and landing slots.

 A pact is likely to be inked in Delhi by the middle of this month between US transportation secretary Norman Mineta and civil aviation minister Praful Patel. Top airline representatives from these two airlines as well as other airlines such as Delta Airline and US Air are expected to be part of Mineta?s team.

 While Northwest Airlines has flown to India earlier and is now seeking to renew the connection that it had snapped after a downturn in the market, American Airlines will be a newcomer to the Indian market.

 Sources said both airlines have sought permission from Delhi and the US department of homeland security. ?There are no problems with giving them the permission to fly,? said a civil aviation ministry official.

 But, officials said, flights would possibly start from the winter schedule. Northwest Airlines is likely to launch a daily Minneapolis-Bangalore service via Amsterdam from end-October. This will be a flight where passengers will not have to disembark from the aircraft but rather fly on to their destinations after a stop.

 Northwest also has a code-sharing arrangement with KLM to service Delhi and Mumbai from the US.

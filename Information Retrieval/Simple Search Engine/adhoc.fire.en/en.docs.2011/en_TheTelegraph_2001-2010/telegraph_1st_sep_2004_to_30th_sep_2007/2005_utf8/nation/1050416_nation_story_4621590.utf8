 Rein on rebels

 New Delhi, April 15: The Centre today agreed to create a group of chief ministers of Naxalite-infested states to work out a unified strategy, acknowledging that a piecemeal approach will not work, reports our special correspondent.

 The group, to be headed by Union home minister Shivraj Patil, is expected to be a precursor to a unified command mechanism for operations.

 Consensus on a comprehensive approach on Naxalites emerged here at the annual conference of chief ministers on internal security.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his inaugural speech sent out a clear message about the United Progressive Alliance government?s resolve to deal with insurgency and extremism.

 The Centre made it clear that no one was permitted to resort to violence to achieve social, political or economic changes. ?This should be made amply clear in our policy announcements,? he said.

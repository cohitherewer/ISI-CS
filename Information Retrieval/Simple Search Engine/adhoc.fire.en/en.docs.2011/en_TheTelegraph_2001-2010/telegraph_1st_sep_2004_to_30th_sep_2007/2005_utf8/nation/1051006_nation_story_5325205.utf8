 Safer drug to fight malaria 

 G.S. MUDUR 

 New Delhi, Oct.5: An international research initiative to combat the worlds most neglected diseases has developed two new formulations to tackle malaria and has asked Indian scientists to help find a new drug against sleeping sickness.

 Through an international research consortium, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) has developed two new formulations that will make the treatment of malaria easier and potentially safer, a top DNDi official has said.

 The two formulations that are expected to enter the market next year will reduce the treatment dose for malaria from the existing 24 tablets to just six, Dr Bernard Pecoul, executive director of DNDi, told The Telegraph.

 The new formulations are intended for treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that can cause life- threatening cerebral malaria and has increasingly shown resistance to the conventional anti-malaria drug: chloroquine.

 Pecoul said technology for the two formulations, which combine a compound called artesunate with other anti-malarial drugs, will be transferred to industry partners in different countries for local manufacture.

 A DNDi team has also asked the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow, to screen its library of chemical compounds to find a new and safe drug against sleeping sickness, a fatal illness spread by the bite of the tsetse fly in Africa.

 The existing drug against sleeping sickness is highly toxic. It can kill one in 20 people who receive it. But we have no choice today, because without this drug, sleeping sickness is nearly 100 per cent fatal, Pecoul said.

 Public health specialists estimate that some 300,000 people are infected with sleeping sickness in Africa and about 500,000 new cases of kala azar occur each year in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Brazil and Sudan.

 The DNDi, funded by Medicins Sans Frontieres, is an effort to develop drugs against diseases that have remained neglected for decades: kala azar, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease as well as malaria, all of them caused by parasites. 

 The Indian Council of Medical Research is among five public-funded organisations that have supported the DNDi through research projects.

 Rane at Cong tea table

 Mumbai, July 10: If a lunch of fish curry had sealed their truce, a cup of tea may have forged a bond between Maharashtras Congressman chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and Shiv Sena rebel Narayan Rane.

 Providing the first hints of which party he might join, Rane walked into the Sahyadri state guesthouse today for the traditional chief ministers tea party on the eve of the monsoon session of the Assembly.

 The leader of Opposition had boycotted the annual party the last three times. The Sena and the BJP today stayed away for the fourth consecutive year.

 Ranes move comes a day before an expected showdown between him and the Sena in the Assembly.

 Rane, a former chief minister, had spearheaded the Sena-BJPs unsuccessful attempt to topple the Deshmukh government in July 2003. But during the budget session in March this year, the two of them surprised everyone by sharing a meal of spicy fish curry in Ranes chamber at Vidhan Bhavan.

 I am in touch with Vilasrao, Rane had told reporters on Friday.

 Both the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party have been wooing the Sena dissident, but he has refused to reveal his strategy.

 Rane had announced at a news conference that on July 11, the first day of the monsoon session, he would resign as the leader of Opposition. He had claimed that 26 of the Senas 63 MLAs would express support for him on that day.

 But on Friday, only nine Sena MLAs showed up for a meeting at his home while two others faxed their support. A day earlier, party chief Uddhav Thackeray had paraded 51 legislators before Speaker Balasaheb Kupekar.

 Rane is now expected to petition the Speaker to disqualify 25 of these MLAs for not attending Fridays meeting, which had been convened by party chief whip Vinayak Nimhan (at Ranes behest).

 The list of the 25 names leading Uddhav supporters, including the newly-elected leader of the Sena legislature party, Ramdas Kadam, Saamna publisher Subhash Desai and Gajanan Kirtikar.

 The list leaves out those Rane considers his potential supporters among the 51 paraded by Uddhav. Its a signal to these legislators that they would not be disqualified if they support Rane tomorrow.

 Uddhav today visited Hotel Le Meridien where the 51 MLAs have been put up by the party, and indicated that if the threat of disqualification is carried out, the Sena is ready with a battery of lawyers to take the battle to court.

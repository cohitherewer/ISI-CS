 Prayer amp; tears in hunt for kin 

 Lohar Gali (Pakistan), Oct. 9 (Reuters): Agonisingly close to Muzaffarabad, a landslide caused by Saturdays earthquake blocks the way for anxious Kashmiris trying to reach relatives in the main city of the region worst hit by the catastrophe.

 There are no solid estimates of the number of people killed in Pakistani Kashmir, though politicians reckoned thousands had perished.

 Hoping to find his nephew Zeeshan alive, Fazal Mahmood drove down from Mansehra in neighbouring North West Frontier Province.

 We are worried about Zeeshan. It is as if we are already mourning at home, his mother cant stop crying and we can only pray that he is safe, the 40-year-old bank officer said on the roadside at Lohar Gali, a village 4 km outside Muzaffarabad.

 Just after midnight, some two dozen vehicles had pulled up at Lohar Gali, their passengers waiting for daybreak before making the last part of their journey on foot.

 Muzaffarabad is visible in the distance, but it is impossible to tell the scale of damage.

 Pakistan Kashmir has probably been hit hardest by the strongest quake to hit the subcontinent for a century.

 Its hilly terrain and a lot of damage has taken place in the capital, Muzaffarabad, and neighbouring towns, Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said. Indications are that almost 50 per cent of the homes have been destroyed.

 Private Geo Television reported that some of Muzaffarabads main buildings, including the court house, an old secretariat of the local government, a military hospital and army offices, had been destroyed.

 Injured people had poured into the citys one remaining major hospital, but many were lying in the courtyard waiting for attention from medical staff struggling to cope.

 The account given by Ishaq Gillani, a 38-year-old revenue officer who had made it out of Muzaffarabad, was hardly comforting for the searchers stuck at Lohar Gali. I was shaving when the quake struck and it felt like my house was floating. People were screaming and running for their lives. Buildings and houses were razed to the ground. It was terrible.

 Search for 5 on bus

 Relatives of five Hindus and Sikhs who travelled to Muzaffarabad by bus on October 6 are seeking information from the external affairs ministry about their well-being since communication links with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir have snapped, PTI adds from Jammu. They were the first non-Muslims to travel by the bus since it started in April.

 Nation at a Glance

 Mayavati bonds with Brahmins

 Lucknow: First, Jinnah turned secular. 

 Now Brahmins have ceased to be Manuvadis.

 In this season of ideological somersaults, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati, who once wanted Brahmins beaten up with shoes, now sees the community as friends. 

 She doesnt find herself in L.K. Advanis shoes, of course, for the change in heart. Her party was solidly behind her as the former chief minister addressed a mega rally of Brahmins at the Ambedkar Maidan here, asking them to hitch their wagon to hers, reports our special correspondent.

 n the process, she disowned the aggressive slogans her party had coined in the late eighties and early nineties, such as: Tilak, tarju aur talwar, isko maro juta char (Brahmins, Rajputs and Kayasths deserve to be beaten with shoes). 

 My party never launched those slogans, Mayavati told the rally. So who did? The BSP chief smelt a Manuvadi hand behind the confusion. The Manuvadi parties had attributed those slogans to the Bahujan Samaj Party to malign its image. 

 he then unveiled her new slogan: Brahman ka eh mela hai, ab ham log akela nehi hai (Heres an assembly of Brahmins, we are no longer alone).

 Thousands of Brahmins ? their foreheads marked with sandalwood and kumkum tilaks ? streamed into the Ambedkar Park from across the state, braving the blazing summer heat.

 Board wins Amarnath battle

 Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister 

 Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has finally relented on the duration 

 of the yearly pilgrimage to the cave shrine of Amarnath, 

 reports our correspondent.

 According to the agreement reached between the Amarnath shrine board, headed by the governor, Lieutenant General (Retired) S.K. Sinha, and the state administration, the pilgrimage will start on June 21 from the shorter route of Baltal in Srinagar district.

 The shrine board had earlier announced a two-month yatra but the state government was insisting on a duration of one month citing difficulty in providing security to the pilgrims for such a long period. 

 Paris prize for Mystic India

 produced by the Baps Swaminarayan Sanstha, has won the audience

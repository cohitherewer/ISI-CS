 Nation at a Glance

 Techies set free in Malaysia 

 New Delhi (PTI): Two employees of software 

 giant HCL Technologies, who were detained in Kuala Lumpur 

 on Saturday, have been released after intervention by Indian 

 embassy officials.

 The employees were suspected to be illegal workers.

 ?Our two employees (Girish Gupta and Sandeep Arora), who were detained on Saturday afternoon have been released, and they have joined work,? Saurav Adhikari, the corporate vice-president (strategy), said.

 While Gupta was released in 24 hours, Arora was in detention for 48 hours.

 The duo was having a stroll after lunch when members of Rela, a voluntary force that helps authorities crack down on illegal workers, caught them.

 ?After Indian officials intervened and valid work permits and documents were produced both were allowed to go,? Adhikari said.

 Arora has a long-term employment visa while Gupta had a business visa.

 ?The release of Arora might have taken longer as on a weekend it must have taken time for the authorities to verify his long-term visa,? he said. 

 US entry bar for Mumbai don 

 New Delhi (PTI): The US has put notorious 

 drug dealer Iqbal Mamen alias Iqbal Mirchi on the list of 

 specially designated narcotics traffickers.

 The list released by the US treasury department named Mamen, also known as Iqbal Merchant, as a person whose entry into the country has been blocked. The list has all the four dates of birth he uses in his various passports. His passport numbers issued from India and the UAE also feature on it.

 Apparently the move has come in the wake of the drug peddler?s attempts to enter the US.

 India had secured a red-corner notice against Mamen, a Mumbai resident, in 1994 after police unearthed an illegal factory in Pune where 1,600 kg of methaqualone, used in the manufacture of mandrax tablets, and 110 kg of mandrax powder were seized.

 Zahira bunks bakery trial 

 Mumbai (PTI): Zahira Sheikh, the 

 prime witness in the Best Bakery case, did not turn up before 

 the special court on Monday as the summons issued to her 

 had not been served yet, the prosecution said. 

 The special judge had issued summons to Zahira, her mother and brother after a prosecution plea for re-examining them in the light of fresh evidence. The public prosecutor wanted to examine Zahira based on the contents of a video CD that contradicted what they had said before the court on oath.

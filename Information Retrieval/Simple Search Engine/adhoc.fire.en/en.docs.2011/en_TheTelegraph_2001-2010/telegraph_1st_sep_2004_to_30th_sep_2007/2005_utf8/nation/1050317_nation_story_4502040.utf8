 Raid yields passbooks, stamp

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, March 16: Sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today raided the residence of former Latehar divisional forest officer Bijay Kumar Sinha in Bihar?s Samastipur and seized a stamp of the DFO?s office and five bank passbooks.

 On March 14, CID sleuths had raided Sinha?s house in the capital?s Ashoknagar colony in search of an important file and other documents.

 Sinha is accused of misappropriating over Rs 1 crore. The case was lodged in 1998 and the CID took over in 2001. Similar raids have also been conducted on his residences in Jamshedpur and Patna.

 Sinha allegedly committed several irregularities while he was working with the forest state trading corporation between 1990 and 1993. 

 One of the charges against Sinha is the purchase of forest equipment worth Rs 24 lakh from a fake company. The DFO sanctioned the payments even though the equipment was not supplied. Besides, it was found that the company did not exist.

 The CID officials said they are hunting for more documents to prove the charges against Sinha. ?He has got other charges against him as well. Investigations are on in full swing and we plan to tighten the noose soon,? a sleuth said.

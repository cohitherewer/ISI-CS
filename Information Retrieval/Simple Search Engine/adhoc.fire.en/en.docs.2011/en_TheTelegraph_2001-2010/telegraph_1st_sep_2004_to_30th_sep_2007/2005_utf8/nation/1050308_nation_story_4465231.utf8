The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Run Bihar run, says Laloo

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, March 7: ?Bhaago re, Rashtrapti shashan lagoo ho gaya (Run, President?s rule has been imposed)!? Laloo Prasad Yadav said in his first utterance on reaching Patna today.

 The man on the street was not running but fearing curfew and police excesses despite welcoming the Centre?s decision today to impose President?s rule.

 ?Ab to yahan curfew lagega. Road par nikalna mushkil ho jayega (Now curfew will be imposed. It will be difficult to come out on the road),? said a rickshawpuller at the chaotic Dakbungalow Chowk here.

 Whatever the ?true? picture, strong support for central rule was evident in the slogans painted in bold deep red on the walls along the main Fraser Road up to Gandhi Maidan.

 Signed by a ?desh premi (patriot)?, the slogans warned Ram Vilas Paswan not to ?sabotage the inevitable? by supporting any party to form a government.

 Government or no, Laloo Prasad, despite the evident disappointment, played to the waiting media at the airport.

 ?Hum to satta ka bhog kar ke baithe hain. Hum to abhi bhi satta mein hain (Here I am after enjoying the fruits of power. I am still in power),? he said, indicating his clout at the Centre. ?I am feeling relaxed. Ask those who wanted to be in power, how they feel.?

 People who last remember central rule in Bihar from 1999 know how leaders should feel now. ?I read the chief secretary has asked them (former ministers) to return all files of their departments. For once, they should join the ranks of commoners like us,? said Utkarsh, a college student.

 People are also happy with the withdrawal of former ministers? phone, vehicle and housing facilities.

 Deepak Sharma, a shopkeeper, however, is more concerned about his two-wheeler. ?I think policemen will become very powerful and there will be no check on their excesses. I have decided to carry my two-wheeler?s documents all the time and not move out without a helmet.?

 For Laloo Prasad, who said he has been declared ?achhoot (untouchable)?, it was ?a good opportunity (that) has been lost?. ?Our dreams about developing Bihar has been shattered.?

 A bank officer, who requested anonymity, did not agree. ?Men in khadi have slipped into a habit of misusing their position. I hope central rule will end the visible excesses of such people.?

 But the RJD chief was emphatic. ?You cannot write off Laloo Yadav,? he said.

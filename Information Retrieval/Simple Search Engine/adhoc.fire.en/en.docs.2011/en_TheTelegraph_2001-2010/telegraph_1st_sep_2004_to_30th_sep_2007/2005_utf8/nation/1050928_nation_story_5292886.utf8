 CPM routs 

Congress with exile help

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 27: Friends in Delhi, foes in state.

 The irony of this tie-up between the CPM and the Congress has come to the fore in the just-concluded civic polls in Kerala where the Marxists teamed up with K. Karunakaran to trounce the former Congressmans party.

 The CPM-led Left Democratic Front made a clean sweep of the five corporation councils and all but one of the 14 district councils, though the winning streak lost a bit of steam in the municipalities and three-tier local councils. The results were still coming in.

 The Congress is likely to end up with 30 per cent of the seats. The BJP made a few gains.

 The Democratic Indira Congress (Karunakaran), the CPMs partner in the new-found anti-Congress combination, had to be content with a few seats. But Karunakaran, a former chief minister, patted himself on the back for decimating the Congress ? his party for the past six decades.

 The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), however, retained the Muslim-dominated Malappuram district and improved its performance in the Christian-dominated areas south of Ernakulam compared with how it had fared in the last Lok Sabha polls.

 Former All India Congress Committee secretary Ramesh Chennithala, who was brought in as state party president recently, claimed that the UDF had been able to stem the slide and the Congress had emerged as a more cohesive party after Karunakarans exit.

 The result was no different when the Congress-led front lost all but one of the 20 seats in the previous Lok Sabha polls when Karunakaran was very much with the Congress. But the outcome of the civic polls is sure to drive a wedge between the Congress and the CPM.

 A strong section in the Congress, led by former chief minister and working committee member A.K. Antony, feels the party should be more assertive in its ties with the CPM, which, these leaders say, still swears by anti-Congressism.

 The CPM and Karunakarans outfit now plan to extend their mutually beneficial arrangement to the Assembly elections, which are barely seven months away.

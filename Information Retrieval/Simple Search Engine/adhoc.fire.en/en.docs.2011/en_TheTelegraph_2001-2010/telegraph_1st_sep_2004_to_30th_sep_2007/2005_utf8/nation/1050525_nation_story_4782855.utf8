The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Stage set for medical clash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: The National Board of Examinations, an autonomous body that functions under the health ministry, is on a collision course with the Medical Council of India.

 The NBE, which gives postgraduate diplomas in 41 specialities and offers courses in postdoctoral fellowships in specialised fields, now wants to give postgraduate degrees as well. 

 The MCI, a body of professional doctors that sets the standards of medical education in the country, is likely to oppose the move.

 If the NBE has its way, it would mean an entry into the exclusive terrain of the medical council, which decides the syllabus, recognises medical schools and hospitals that have the facilities and teachers to conduct and confer both graduate and postgraduate degrees.

 The NBE was originally conceptualised to help practising doctors get postgraduate degrees. The objective was to help those who were simply medical graduates hone their talent and become postgraduates and specialists.

 The board also recognises certain hospitals where students can gather work experience. At the end of their tenure, after a written examination and practical case studies, the board confers a diploma, which is recognised all over the country.

 The NBE is now headed by Dr Rajshekaran, a leading urologist and a relative of health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, whose department is at loggerheads with the medical council and wants to bring in amendments to the MCI act to give the government more say.

 The medical council, however, has the support of the Left parties, which are opposed to government interference in an autonomous body. 

 Whatever the faults of the MCI need to be corrected, but we are against destroying institutions, we want the MCI to remain autonomous?, said CPI leader A.B. Bardhan.

 A leading doctor, attached to a medical school in the capital, said the medical council would naturally oppose the NBE move because the standards set by the board are not as high as that of the MCI. It is like getting a graduate degree from a leading college like St Stephens or Lady Shri Ram and the same graduate degree from the Indira Gandhi National Open University, which helps students who work and want to continue their education much on the same lines as the NBE does for graduate doctors.

 Sanjiv Malik, the national president-elect of the Indian Medical Association, said while the NBE helps graduate doctors do further studies, its terms are less stringent than that of the MCI. Today, when there is so much controversy about private medical colleges, allowing degrees to be given by the NBE, which also recognises hospitals where diploma can be earned, will lead to more confusion and less stringent norms, Malik said.

 As professionals, we want regulations to be as stringent as possible.

 Sarabjit 

 Islamabad, Sept. 12 (PTI): Pakistan today ruled out swapping Sarabjit Singh with Pakistani prisoners housed in Indian jails, saying they were not spies.

 Pakistan has sentenced Sarabjit to death for alleged spying.

 We do not have any spies in India and all the 587 prisoners released today by both the countries at the Wagah border were civilians and not security prisoners, foreign office spokesman Naeem Khan said, replying to a question whether Pakistan would swap Sarabjit with any its spies imprisoned in India.

 Pakistan today released 435 prisoners while India set free 152 Pakistani prisoners at the Wagah border.

 - Heat on order mandating govt nod to try officials

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Centre?s controversial ?single directive? mandating its prior permission to criminally prosecute high-ranking public servants will go before a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court.

 The bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, D.M. Dharmadhikari and Tarun Chatterjee today referred the matter to the larger Constitution bench as it involved ?constitutional issues?.

 The ?single directive? ordinance was brought by finance minister P. Chidambaram in his earlier stint at the Centre (the 1996-98 United Front regime) following a Rs 3,000-crore Indian Bank scam involving non-performing assets.

 Several Congress politicians and Chidambaram?s family business group, the M.A. Chidambaram group, were allegedly involved in the case brought before the Supreme Court by Janata Party chief Subramanian Swamy.

 By then, the United Front government had fallen. But the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance regime retained the ?single directive? clause as Section 6-A in the Central Vigilance Commission Act.

 Section 6-A provides for the government?s mandatory prior permission to an investigating agency to criminally prosecute a bureaucrat of joint secretary rank and above and, in cases of bank frauds, a branch manager and above.

 Following a challenge to this provision by Swamy and the People?s Union for Civil Liberties, the three-judge bench today said that ?the validity of Section 6-A has been questioned on the touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution?. The article mandates ?equality before law and equal application of law? to all classes of the citizenry.

 The Supreme Court had struck down the ?single directive? in the Vineet Narain case, popularly known as the Jain hawala case, to enable ?honest officers to fearlessly enforce the criminal law and detect corruption uninfluenced by extraneous political, bureaucratic or other influences?.

 The court pointed out today that the very provision was sought to be brought into the statute through Section 6-A.

 ?The result of the impugned legislation is that the very group of persons, namely high-ranking bureaucrats, whose misdeeds and illegalities may have to be inquired into would decide whether the CBI should even start an inquiry or investigation against them or not,? the bench said.

 It added that ?the very nexus of the criminal-bureaucrat-politician, which is subverting the whole polity, would be involved in granting or refusing prior approval before an inquiry or investigation can take place?.

 ?Infractions of the law,? the judges said, ?need to be investigated, investigations have to be conducted quickly and effectively without any interference.?

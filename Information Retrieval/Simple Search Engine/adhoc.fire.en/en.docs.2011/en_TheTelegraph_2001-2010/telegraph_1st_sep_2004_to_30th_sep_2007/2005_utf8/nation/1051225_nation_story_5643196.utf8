 Singh, Sonia skip Rao memorial

 New Delhi: The area had been sanitised because the Prime Minister was sure to come. After all, it was the first death anniversary of the man who gave him his first big break in politics, reports our special correspondent.

 December 23 came and went, but Manmohan Singh did not come. Neither did Congress president Sonia Gandhi and most of the party top guns.

 Sources said Singhs arrival at 9 Motilal Nehru Marg, the official residence of former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, was certain. We dont know what transpired but, finally, our Prime Minister chose not to come and so did the other top Congress leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, said a party worker.

 The only bigwig from the Congress was Union home minister Shivraj Patil. 

 The same day, however, the Prime Minister marked his presence at Kisan Ghat, the memorial of another former Prime Minister, Charan Singh.

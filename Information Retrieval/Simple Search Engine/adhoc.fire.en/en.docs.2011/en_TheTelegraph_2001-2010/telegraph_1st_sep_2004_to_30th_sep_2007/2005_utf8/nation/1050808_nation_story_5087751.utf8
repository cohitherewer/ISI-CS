 Push to war hotline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: India and Pakistan are all set to establish a dedicated hotline between their directors general of military operations, a day after agreeing to revive the one between the foreign secretaries.

 The hotlines are part of the confidence-building measures (CBMs) that the two South Asian neighbours are discussing to raise the level of trust between them.

 Yesterday, at the end of the two-day expert-level talks on nuclear CBMs, the two sides had agreed to revive the hotline between the foreign secretaries that was operational till 1995. The main aim is to avoid an accidental nuclear war. 

 There are indications that the joint statement likely to be issued tomorrow will announce the setting up of the dedicated hotline between the DGMOs, with the aim of reducing the danger and ensuring that the neighbours minimise the chance of even a conventional war.

 A hotline exists between the DGMOs but is used only once a week and often with little result. With the dedicated hotline, either DGMO can speak to his counterpart anytime.

 India is keen that similar arrangements be put in place between senior officials of the air forces and navies of the two countries. Delhi has even proposed that hotlines be set up between the corps commanders of the army. 

 However, Islamabad has been mulling over such suggestions for several months.

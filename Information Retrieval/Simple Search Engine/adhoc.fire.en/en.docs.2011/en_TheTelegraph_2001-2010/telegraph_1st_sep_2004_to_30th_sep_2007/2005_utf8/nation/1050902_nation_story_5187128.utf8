 Bengal eyes China business

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: The CPM leadership is all set to give Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee its stamp of approval for his drive to reform Bengals economy at the politburo meeting beginning in Delhi tomorrow.

 Bhattacharjee and CPM general secretary Prakash Karat had an informal chat this evening at AK Gopalan Bhavan over the recent deals struck by the chief minister in Singapore and Indonesia. 

 It is normal. I am a member of the party. He (Prakash Karat) is my general secretary, Bhattacharjee said about the discussion.

 The politburo meeting, at which Bhattacharjee will explain the details of the business deals, will be followed by a two-day central committee meeting.

 A senior politburo member said the leadership fully backs Bhattacharjee, adding that the politburo is not seeking any explanation from the chief minister. 

 The leadership is convinced that Bhattacharjee has not gone against the economic guidelines laid down at the party congress held two months ago in Delhi.

 After his meeting and dinner with the Prime Minister last night, Bhattacharjee met officials in the Chinese embassy this afternoon and asked them to send a business delegation to Bengal.

 Talks about an exchange of business delegations have been going on for a long time. A Chinese delegation will come to Bengal first. Then we will go, said Bhattacharjee. We have identified the possible areas for investment.

 The chief ministers industrialisation drive so far seems to have proceeded without any major hitch.

 A politburo member today said: When Vietnam and China can go with America and the CPM can go with the Congress, what prevents us from having a business deal with Salim?

 Acknowledging that the Left Front partners have questioned the deal with Indonesias Salim Group, the chief minister said: The issue will be sorted out.

 The CPM leadership has, however, clarified that it is not jettisoning its opposition to the Centres reforms agenda. 

 The Centres stand on economic reforms, they maintain, is distinct from Bhattacharjees.

 In a statement issued today, the CPM politburo said it is disturbed by the decision of the central government to go ahead with the bidding process to facilitate the privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports.

 CPM leaders underlined that Bhattacharjees call for privatisation is distinct from the Centres wooing of FDI for airports. 

 The chief minister, they said, is talking about privatisation of new projects.

 The CPM said: There is inadequacy of modernisation programme under private ownership and uncertainty over the future of employees of the Airports Authority of India.

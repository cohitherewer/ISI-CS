 RSS roving eye on Advani

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, July 18: A day after he secured an apparent respite from the RSS, the Sangh bosses decided to keep a beady eye on L.K. Advani and his party to assess whether they adhered to the road map drawn out in a meeting yesterday. 

 The meeting was held between Advani, Jaswant Singh, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Sanjay Joshi of the BJP and Mohanrao Bhagwat and Suresh Soni of the parent organisation.

 Sources said the Sangh map had placed some milestones at which the conduct and commitment of the BJP president and his colleagues would be measured. It was clarified that these milestones were not just ideological (that is, Hindutva-centred) but related to more basic issues impinging on individual morality and probity ? issues that apparently bothered the RSS for the six years the NDA was in power. 

 After putting Advani and his party on notice from today, the RSS will re-assemble in Nagpur on August 19 to see how they were doing, form an assessment and depending on that, formulate its next response.

 Sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan, who was to have been in the US for a month, has curtailed his trip. Sources said he would only attend his nieces wedding and return without addressing swayamsevaks in the US, Canada and the UK, as he was earlier slated to.

 Sources said the RSSs direct engagement with the BJP was prompted by a breakdown of the mutual trust that existed between the parent and its progeny allegedly by Advani and the coterie around him. 

 A further breach of the trust would not be tolerated by the Sangh, it was stressed.

 Asked what the Sanghs minimum expectation was, sources said Advani would have to step down as the BJP chief. We are not here to give time frames but events can certainly decide the timing, they said. They added the Sangh was unconcerned with him remaining as the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. The indication was Advani could step down immediately after the monsoon session that ends on August 26 and make way for a new president who would preside over the national executive meeting. This meeting, which was to start from July 21 in Chennai, has been put off until September 16.

 As the RSS and the BJP decided to suspend hostilities, the apparent truce continued to take its toll on the partys normal functioning. 

 The first casualty was the postponement of the national executive because of the preparations for the coming monsoon session of Parliament (from July 24), according to the deputy leader of the BJP in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra.

 Malhotra also said Advani would continue as the BJP chief and leader of Opposition during the session.

 Doctor verdict on hold

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: The Supreme Court has reserved judgment on whether doctors could be criminally convicted in medical negligence cases, besides having to pay compensation as part of civil liability.

 Earlier, two division benches had differed on the question, which was then referred to a larger bench.

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari had said doctors could not be criminally convicted in medical negligence cases unless their negligence was proven to be ?gross? and the degree of negligence should be ?reckless?.

 However, a bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and C.K. Thakker disagreed and referred the matter to a larger bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyan.

 On Wednesday, the three-judge bench reserved judgment after hearings were over and also admitted for hearing an intervention petition by Kunal Saha, a US-based medical practitioner and the president of People for Better Treatment. 

 ?Allowing PBT?s intervention petition is a major development and we have shown from US jurisprudence how doctors in this part of the world are convicted for criminal liability in medical negligence cases,? Saha said over phone from the US.

 ?Although Justice Dharmadhikari?s judgment agreed that doctors have to pay monetary compensation for negligence, it has made criminal liability of doctors almost impossible,? he said.

 Saha had initiated a landmark case against medical negligence after his wife, also a US-based doctor, died in May 1998 at Mumbai?s Breach Candy Hospital after a few days of treatment at the Advanced Medical Research Institute in Calcutta.

 The apex court had on January 5 issued notices to Calcutta doctors Sukumar Mukherjee, Baidyanath Haldar and Abani Roy Choudhury and the state of Bengal in the case. The doctors had been convicted by a trial court, but had been acquitted by Calcutta High Court in March 2004.

 The intervention petition contended that the decision that for doctors and surgeons to be criminally liable, ?the standard of medical negligence required to be proved should be so high as to be considered gross negligence or reckless? is a wrong medical jurisprudence principle.

 The counsel for the petitioner, Avik Datta, argued that criminal conviction of doctors in the US is part and parcel of medical jurisprudence and there are several instances of doctors going to jail for negligence. He cited several cases of criminal prosecution of doctors in the US involving ?potassium chloride, a drug that is regularly used in an intravenous drip to treat potassium deficiencies that often result from treatment for common diseases? like high blood pressure. 

 Datta also cited cases from the UK, South Africa and other countries to contend that doctors were being criminally convicted if found guilty of medical negligence.

 The judgment is likely to be delivered within two weeks.

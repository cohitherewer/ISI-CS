 Reality call on mafia links

 Lucknow, July 21 (PTI): 

 Links between the underworld and Bollywood is a stark reality 

 and should be dealt with like any other problem, says TV 

 talk show host Shekhar Suman.

 We should stop denying the existence of the problem and instead, look for methods to find a lasting solution to it, he told reporters. But the media has gone overboard on the Salman-Aishwarya tape controversy, he said.

 He said politicians and corporate personalities allegedly had links with the underworld but Bollywood attracted the maximum wrath due to its glamour quotient.

 Admitting that the casting couch existed in Bollywood, he said in a highly-competitive entertainment world, it is not an unnatural phenomenon.

 On his spoofs on politicians from bihar, the actor said it simply went to show the immense popularity they enjoy. I always tell people who complain that... Since they are worth it, they become a part of my comedy.

 Shekhar, who is making a return to the silver screen with moonlight opposite perizaad zorabian and two other films, said although tv made him a household name, his love for films was still alive. He plans to do a bhojpuri film soon to cater to the demand for it, he added. Pti snd pan vt 07211838 del

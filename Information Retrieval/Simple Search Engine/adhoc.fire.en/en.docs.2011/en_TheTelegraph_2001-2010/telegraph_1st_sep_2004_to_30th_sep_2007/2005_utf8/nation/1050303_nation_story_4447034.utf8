 Patna, March 2: The letter from Ranchi, signed and stamped with the Congress seal, made all the difference as late-evening politicking here veered round to the strong possibility of a Jharkhand repeat in Bihar.

 With the Congress high command clearly preferring Laloo Prasad Yadav over Ram Vilas Paswan and a UPA government being installed in Jharkhand, the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s spirits soared as chances of its return to power brightened today.

 Laloo Prasad said his party, led by outgoing chief minister Rabri Devi, would ?very soon? stake claim to form a government before governor Buta Singh.

 ?The only way we will sit in the Opposition is if the Lok Janshakti Party joins hands with the NDA,? he said.

 Paswan, who returned to Patna in the evening, however, was determined to foil the RJD?s bid for power. Drawing a distinction between the UPA at the Centre and the state, he said: ?We have resolved to remain in the UPA at the Centre but have decided to vote against the RJD if it is invited to form the government.?

 The Congress, which gave a letter of support on behalf of its 10 newly elected MLAs to the RJD, favoured Laloo Prasad in the face of its state unit?s strong reservations and despite Paswan?s LJP being the party?s ?more trusted? ally during the Assembly polls.

 An upset Paswan said the RJD chief had ?blackmailed? the Congress into supporting him. ?Laloo Prasad traded his party?s support in Jharkhand with the Congress. But we will not let an RJD-led regime come to office in Bihar. The numbers are not with the RJD.?

 But Laloo Prasad said ?the UPA there (Jharkhand) had a clear majority?. ? A secular government will be formed in Bihar as well. Remember, we are the single largest party.?

 Paswan said the Congress?s letter of support, signed by its Bihar and Jharkhand in-charge Harikesh Bahadur, would only take the RJD?s numbers to 85. ?We are talking about the majority mark of 122. We are ready to back any government that does not have the presence of the RJD and the BJP,? he said.

 His stand was reaffirmed at a meeting today of the new LJP legislators. Samajwadi Party state chief Dadan Yadav turned up at the meeting, saying: ?I have come with a message from my national president Mulayam Singh Yadav to keep off the RJD at all cost.?

 Laloo Prasad said he had already received letters of support from the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Nationalist Congress Party. ?We expect the support from the CPI and the CPM to come soon.?

 Bail for Pataudi, threat calls for judge

 Chandigarh/Jhajjar, June 20: The Tiger is free, but it is not freedom yet.

 Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi today walked out of police custody after a Jhajjar court granted him bail in the black buck killing case.

 The reprieve, however, did not come before some discomfort, and a threat to the man who released him after two nights in a dingy lock-up.

 Chief judicial magistrate Sudhir Jiwan, who granted bail to the former cricket captain on a bond of Rs 50,000 and a surety of a similar amount, said his wife received calls warning that her husband would come to harm if Pataudi got bail.

 I was hearing the case when I got a call on my mobile from my wife Kavita. I did not take the call then. After I heard the case and gave the order for bail, I called my wife back. It was then she told me that she had received two calls on the house phone between 11.30 am and 12 noon.

 A man on the other side threatened her saying that it would be bad for her husband if Pataudi got bail. When she asked who it was, the man said it was none of her business, he told The Telegraph.

 Jhajjar superintendent of police Hanif Qureshi said a full-scale investigation has been launched. It is a serious matter. We will not spare anyone who is responsible for the calls, he added.

 Earlier in the morning, Pataudi complained of breathlessness and chest pain. Around 9.30, he was taken to hospital where an ECG was done and his blood pressure taken. 

 Police officials said his blood pressure was on the high while the ECG was normal.

 It was a small room?. The power situation is bad here and we dont have a generator, so there were frequent breakdowns, Qureshi said.

 Pataudi was later taken to the court where the judge granted him bail. If presumption of guilt is held against him at this stage, it would tantamount to crucifying the accused (Pataudi), hanging him first and trying afterwards, Jiwan said, rejecting the prosecutions argument that Pataudi could tamper with evidence and try to influence witnesses.

 The former captain, Indian crickets first glamour boy, is learnt to have given the police a signed statement on his role in the shooting of the black buck, an endangered animal protected under wildlife law. 

 We cannot divulge the contents of the statement. It will affect the statements of the six others who are yet to surrender. We will tally his statement with those of the others, Qureshi said.

 Pataudi is free. But he has not been freed. The matter is not over yet, he added.

 The room in which Pataudi was kept will be given a coat of paint and the furniture replaced. Who knows, Pataudi may have to be here again for a longer period, a police officer wondered.

 Sources said Pataudi denied any role in the killing. He has also claimed he was not present in any of the cars when the carcasses (of the black buck and two rabbits) were freed, said a police officer connected with the probe.

 The police have got the registration certificate of the car in which the carcasses were found.

 Animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan said he would approach Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking cancellation of the bail. We would like to first seek legal advice why Pataudis bail in the high court was rejected and the lower court granted it, he said, but denied any role in the threat calls.

 Somebody must have played a prank. We dont indulge in such low tactics. But we will not allow the police to go soft on the case, he added.

 Tightrope walk on college quota

 Arjun: Minority poser

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: It has the backing of all political parties and is ready for the cabinets nod. But a question mark hangs over whether the government will keep out private unaided minority institutions from the scope of the constitutional amendment bill it is planning to table in Parliaments ongoing winter session.

 The decision on a quota in minority institutions will depend on the cabinet, said an official of the human resource development ministry. It is a very sensitive issue.

 Indications are the government will not include minority institutions in the bill it is bringing to undo a Supreme Court ruling that exempted unaided private educational institutions from reserving seats for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students.

 Officials said they have held wide-ranging consultations with different groups. But the feeling among minority institutions is that if they are brought within the scope of the bill it would undermine their constitutional right to further educational facilities for minority students.

 Their argument is that there is no reservation for minorities in general colleges and so minority institutions should not be expected to set aside seats for SC\ST students. The ministry is, therefore, walking on thin ice on this issue and HRD minister Arjun Singh, it is believed, is not keen on bringing minority institutions within the ambit of the bill.

 At present, private engineering colleges have two categories of quotas ? management and government. Well-heeled students get admission through management quotas. They pay much more than students who enter through government quota. Management quota students do not have to appear for an entrance test. Government quota students on the other hand pay minimum tuition fees but have to sit for a test and get admission on merit.

 The Centre is anticipating legal wrangles once the bill is tabled. There will be public interest litigation. Somebody or the other will go to court, said an official. It will take time before there is an evolved opinion in the matter.

 After the apex courts ruling, the Lok Sabha had debated the matter. All parties cutting across political affiliations supported the governments decision to bring the bill, though there were voices of scepticism about engaging in a confrontation with the court. 

 But all the speakers in the debate said Parliament should exercise the exclusive right it has to legislate on a matter it thinks fit.

 The HRD ministry has also drafted a Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fixation of Fees) Bill to exercise greater control over these institutions. The move followed pressure from state governments.

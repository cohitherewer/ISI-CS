 Iran date amid N-fears

 - Natwar visit lined up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh will leave for Iran on an official visit early next month amid rising global concern about Tehrans nuclear programme under the new hardline regime.

 Natwars visit will also be the first high-level trip from Delhi to the country since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh raised questions on whether international financial backers would underwrite the proposed Indo-Iranian gas pipeline.

 The Prime Ministers comment in Washington had fuelled speculation over Indias seriousness about the project.

 Natwars main interaction during his scheduled September 2-4 visit will be with his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki. But he would also call on new President Ahmadinejad and senior cabinet members.

 After the Congress-led alliance came to power in Delhi in May last year, Kemal Kharazzi, who was Irans foreign minister then, had come to India to establish contacts with the new government. Natwars reciprocal visit to Tehran is being seen as a similar exercise.

 Indian officials said the two foreign ministers will discuss the entire gamut of bilateral relations. But Natwars trip will also be at a time when the leadership in Iran has decided to go ahead with its nuclear programme, ignoring the growing concern of the outside world. 

 Iran claims its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, but the US and many others believe Tehran is trying to make nuclear bombs.

 India has adopted a somewhat ambiguous position. Delhi maintains that Tehran, which has signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty that prohibits pursuing a weapons programme, should honour its international obligation.

 At the same time it argues that under the pact, Iran should be given access to technology that allows it to pursue a peaceful nuclear programme. The problem, however, is the gap between a peaceful programme and one for weapons is not wide enough.

 India and Iran have come closer in the past decade. When they joined forces with Russia to prop up the Northern Alliance ? the only pocket of resistance against the Taliban in Afghanistan ? it further strengthened their bond. Over the years, the two sides have also tried to widen the areas of cooperation through reciprocal visits, including those at the highest political level.

 Iran is also one of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to India. The proposed pipeline, which would pass through Pakistan, is to ensure uninterrupted supply of gas from Teheran to Delhi. The arrangement has the potential to work out to the benefit of both sides.

 But the new leadership in Iran, perceived by most as hardline, has raised fresh concerns in the US and other countries what Teheran might do under Ahmednizads presidency.

 India, which has good relations with both the US and Iran, can perhaps play a role in bridging the gap in the perceptions the two sides have about each other. As Natwar will be in Teheran within days of his visit to Afghanistan, the two sides could also discuss the situation in Kabul.

 Iraq and the likely picture to emerge from there if and when the US troops withdraw could also figure in the talks between Natwar and the Iranian leadership.

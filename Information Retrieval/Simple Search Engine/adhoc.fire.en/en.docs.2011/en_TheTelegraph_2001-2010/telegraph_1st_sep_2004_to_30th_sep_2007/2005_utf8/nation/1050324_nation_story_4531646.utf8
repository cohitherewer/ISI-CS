 Kiln workers rescued

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 23: Kendrapara police yesterday rescued 16 workers, including seven women, from a brick kiln in the Patkura area of the district.

 The police action ended a sordid tale of alleged torture and sexual abuse of the tribal women at the kiln. 

 After receiving a tip-off, a police team raided the brick kiln at Haladiagada in Patkura and rescued the workers. The women were later sent for medical examination to the district headquarters hospital. 

 The police forwarded five persons, including the kiln owner, to court on charges of physical torture and sexual abuse of the workers. They lodged two separate cases under Sections 448, 323, 294, 506, 354 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the Prevention of Atrocity Act against kiln owner Ashwini Choudhury and manager Haladhar Sahoo.

 The tribal women hailed from Sundargarh and Bhadrak districts.

 Kendrapara superintendent of police Dayal Gangwar said the investigation so far has pointed towards the physical torture of the men who worked at the kiln and sexual abuse of the women. A couple of young women from Bonai in Sundargarh alleged that they were raped more than once at the brick kiln.

 About 135 villagers from Bhadrak and Sundargarh worked in the kiln and all of them had not been paid wages since the commencement of work in mid-December. Trouble started when the workers claimed their dues in view of their journey back home to celebrate Holi. 

 More than 50 women from Bonai worked in the kiln and all of them fled between March 10 and March 15. They left for alleged non-payment of dues and physical abuse.

 The police are also looking into the suspected connivance of district labour officials with the brick kiln management, besides their role in suppressing the developments at the kiln. The officials could be booked for abetting crime if the investigation throws up adequate evidence against them.

 The district administration has served a showcause notice on the labour welfare department, asking it to explain its inaction over the alleged violations of norms in the different brick kilns of Kendrapara.

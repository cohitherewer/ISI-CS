 Parents? beeline for Baby 81

 Colombo, Jan. 17: He doesn?t even have a name, but is famous already.

 Spared by the killer waves, Baby 81 ? as he is called ? hit the headlines when distraught parents queued up at Base Hospital in Kalmunai, north Sri Lanka, to claim him as their own. Around nine sets of parents turned up saying he was their lost son. Some even threatened to harm themselves if they were not allowed to take the baby home.

 The infant?s unwitting tryst with fame began after an old man brought him in. He was covered in mud and bruised, but alive and kicking ? a miracle in the middle of bodies that kept piling up at the hospital.

 As no one knew his name, the number 81 stuck. It is the number of the admission ticket the day he was brought in. 

 ?We had to take care of him outside for about six or seven days because there was no space in the wards with the number of dead being brought in. Once things started normalising, we brought him back inside,? said K. Muhunthan, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist. ?We don?t know how old he is, but clinically we can determine the baby is about three or four months old.?

 The rush of parents started soon. ?They started coming and looking at him and saying he was their lost child. We can?t be sure, so we couldn?t give him away. They might believe he is theirs, or they might be lying. Only one couple has lodged a police complaint,? the doctor added.

 ?He is very popular and the nurses love taking care of him. He has his own room and we never leave him alone, for his safety. He?s doing well, apart from little things, like an occasional fever,? the doctor said.

 An official of the department for probation and child care confirmed that one couple had gone to the police which prompted a hearing in court. ?But we were not called for the hearing and the baby is still with us. Just because one couple is serious about getting the child doesn?t mean they are the real parents. If the court calls us, then we will suggest DNA tests,? Muhunthan said.

 What if his parents are not alive?

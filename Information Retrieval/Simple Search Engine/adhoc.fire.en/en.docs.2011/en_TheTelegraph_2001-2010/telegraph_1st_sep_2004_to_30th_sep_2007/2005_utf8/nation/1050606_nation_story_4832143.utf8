 Lunching on red soil

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 5: For the 38-odd Koya families of Munginapalli hamlet in Adilabad district, red soil is the staple diet, not rice or jawa (a porridge).

 The change in diet came about after the former Chandrababu Naidu government, interested in protecting forestland, set up the Vanasamrakshana Samiti with the help of World Bank grants. The samiti was tasked to protect forests, stop tribals from cultivating in the woodlands and also discourage poachers.

 As a result, the Koyas, who inhabit Andhras northernmost district and are part of the 73 lakh tribal population in the state, were robbed of their livelihood of farming. 

 Most now survive on red soil as the last resort. The Koyas eat the soil dry, boiled, dried in the sun or even fried on hot plates. 

 The Scheduled Tribe community lives in Dandakaranya and central parts of Chhattisgarh and has been denied permission to take up agricultural work in the forests.

 Ever since the forest department has denied us permission to undertake farming in the forestland, we have no alternative but to live out of menial labour, begging or with red soil as alternative food, said Alam Shankaramma, a 38-year-old Koya tribal woman.

 Though the red soil is fertile for the cultivation of tobacco, betel leaves and banana, besides medicinal plants, the forest department has forcibly put an end to such activities of tribals, says local revenue official Veeranna.

 When rice or jawa were available, the red soil was a side dish. Sometimes it was mixed with vegetables or even meat. Now, with none of these at hand, the soil is all they have. 

 Veniganti Seethaiah, a tribal farmer, said they eat the soil with roots or bread, too. 

 Such is the poverty in Munginapalli, 560 km from Hyderabad, that pregnant women of other communities also eat red soil. The women believe that consuming red soil during pregnancy gives them fair-skinned babies, says Boyina Shankatayya, a doctor working in the tribal area.

 Experts at the National Institution of Nutrition admit that soil does have some minerals and protein, but one cannot survive by just eating red soil. 

 You need to eat some carbohydrates along with red soil, said Dr. Veena Shatrugna, a nutritionist at the institute.

 Dr. Nageswar Reddy, a gastroenterologist at the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology in Hyderabad, said: Soil-eating does not harm the body. But it also does not give any energy. It is just like eating junk food with which you get a feeling of satiating your hunger temporarily.

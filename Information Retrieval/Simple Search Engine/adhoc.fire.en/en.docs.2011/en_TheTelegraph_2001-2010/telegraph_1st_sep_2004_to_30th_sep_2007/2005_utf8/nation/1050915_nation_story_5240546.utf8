 CM grounds mosquito fighter flight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 14: When Rahul Gandhi visited Japanese encephalitis-hit Gorakhpur a week ago, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was feting Bill Clinton at a cocktail party in Lucknow.

 Now, when the Amethi MP has provided a helicopter and a fogging machine to fight the epidemic that has killed 700 children, the state government is refusing to let them be used. The reason: it doesnt want the Congress to play politics with encephalitis.

 The chopper, which would have sprayed chemicals from the fogging machine to kill the Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquito that spreads the disease, has stood parked on the Rae Bareli airstrip for the past four days.

 The Amethi MP is paying over Rs 50,000 per day for its use but the machine remains idle, said an angry state Congress chief, Salman Khursheed. I believe the state government doesnt want to use effective means to end mosquito breeding and prevent encephalitis deaths.

 The state government argues the spray from the fogging machine could be harmful to crops and animals. We want to know who will be accountable if the fogging of chemicals plays havoc with paddy and animals, said Aloke Sinha, principal secretary, state home department.

 The chief minister and his colleagues ? under fire for failing to tackle the crisis ? are more concerned that the Congress might gain politically from Rahuls gesture. Both Rahul and Sonia Gandhi have visited the epidemic-hit region, pushing the ruling Samajwadi Party on the defensive.

 The fogging machine is a stunt. It cannot put an end to brain fever. Instead, it will intensify the political fever in the state, said Azam Khan, parliamentary affairs minister.

 Mulayam told party workers that Sonia was playing politics. Instead of asking her government to send financial help, she sent Rahul to Gorakhpur. What is this if not politics?

 Rahul had promised the aerial spray during his visit to Gorakhpur on September 7. A team of central doctors accompanying him had praised the fogging machine. They told the MP how these machines had proved their worth during a similar epidemic in New Jersey in 1961. Voluntary health workers in Gorakhpur who assist central health projects had identified 239 villages as a test case for aerial fogging.

 When Rahul broached the idea with the state government, health officials had asked what a fogging machine is supposed to do. 

 On September 10, Rahul got the helicopter, which can fly at low altitudes, and the fogging machine ready on the Rae Bareli airstrip. It is still waiting to get off the ground.

 State government doctors are tight-lipped about the controversy.

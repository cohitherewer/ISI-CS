 Tibet torture: Stand on ice

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, June 19: Much closer home than Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, a prison could be serving the same purpose.

 Three Tibetan women activists, who now live in Dharamsala, last night described how the Chinese tortured them in a Lhasa prison.

 They were tried for demonstrating for Tibets freedom and against the suppression of religious rights, and sentenced to five-year terms in Drapchi prison. Nyima Drolkar, Nyima and Dhamchoe Dolma, all in their late 20s, told their stories one after the other.

 Born in a farmers family, Drolkar joined a nunnery when she was 15, flouting the Chinese-stipulated lower age limit of 18. She and other under-age girls were found out and expelled.

 Drolkar went to Lhasa in search of work but could not get one as she was seen as a troublemaker. She joined a demonstration against suppression of religious rights, was arrested, tried and sent to jail.

 On May 1, 1998, after she had served four years, she encountered the worst. The prison hoisted the Chinese flag and ordered the women ? there were about 60 ? to recite the Chinese anthem. We refused, said Dolma, another of the nuns, who was put in the prison in 1996. 

 We were made to kneel. One policeman hit me on the mouth with a metal object. Some of my teeth fell out. Then he grabbed me by my hair and banged my face on the floor. When I came to, I was told the other six nuns who were with me had died.

 Drolkar was put in solitary confinement for 11 months. 

 The other Nyima, charged with a similar crime, said, We were beaten up with belts. They stubbed cigarettes on our bodies and threw boiling water on our chests. One day, they made us stand on ice from 8 am to 1 pm. Some of the flesh from our feet got stuck in the ice when we were allowed to go.

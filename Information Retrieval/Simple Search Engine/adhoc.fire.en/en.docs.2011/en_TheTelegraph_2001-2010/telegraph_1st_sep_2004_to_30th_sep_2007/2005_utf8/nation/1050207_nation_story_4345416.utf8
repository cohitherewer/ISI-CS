 Modi faithful see luck in shoes

 Patna, Feb. 6: Ashok Gehlot?s shoes may make Sushil Kumar Modi the next Bihar chief minister, if the BJP national vice-president?s supporters are to be believed. 

 On Makar Sankranti, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav offered rice and curd to a few sadhus at chief minister Rabri Devi?s residence so that his wife becomes CM again. It has something to do with ?shubh shagun?, he believed.

 Laloo Prasad had also visited a tantrik in Rajasthan last year for favourable results in the Lok Sabha polls. 

 On February 27, the day results will be declared, politicians and their ?subjects? will have a fair idea of what determines Bihar?s fate ? belief in the supernatural, caste-based equations or the sheer common sense of voters. 

 While most pollsters have predicted a hung House, supporters of Modi are confident that the NDA will be able to form the government and the top contenders for the CM?s chair are the BJP leader and Nitish Kumar. 

 On a chilly January 19 morning, Modi got down at Delhi Cantonment railway station in the wee hours. He was returning to Delhi from a trip to Ajmer Dargh and boarded Ahmedabad Mail at Jaipur. The former Rajasthan chief minister was also in the same AC first-class coach. 

 Modi got down at the station mistakenly wearing Gehlot?s shoes, while the senior Congress leader had gone to the bathroom in Modi?s footwear. The Congress leader was to get off at Delhi station.

 Modi confirmed the incident but laughed off the ?shubh shagun? talk. The BJP leader said he had gone to Ajmer to meet his son who is studying there. ?I also visited Ajmer Dargh, a sacred place. I boarded the train at Jaipur at 4.45 am and when I got down at Delhi Cantonment, I found that I was wearing Gehlot?s shoes, but it was too late as the train had started to move,? Modi told The Telegraph. 

 The senior BJP leader, however, said shoe or no shoe, he is not after the chief minister?s post. ?The chief minister?s post is of no concern to me. My only aim is to see that Laloo Prasad goes out.?

 But a Modi supporter, Avinash Sah of Makhdumpur village, does not think so. Narrating the incident to this reporter, he said Gehlot?s shoes have brought luck to Modi and he will be the next chief minister of Bihar. Devaki Nandan Singh, another Modi fan in Gaya town, echoed similar views. 

 RJD sources said grappling with corruption cases and hoping to do well in the Lok Sabha elections, Laloo Prasad last year visited a remote village in Abhor, near Jodhpur, to participate in a nightlong tantrik ceremony.

 Five priests and half-a-dozen munis participated in the ritual which started at 8.30 in the evening and went on till 4.30 am. The visit was kept a closely guarded secret. Even RJD leaders, barring a particular Laloo Prasad confidant, were not told about the puja. 

 Laloo Prasad?s fortune skyrocketed afterwards, though it is debatable who should get the credit ? the tantriks or Ram Vilas Paswan. The Lok Sabha alliance paid off very well for the RJD fetching 23 seats in Bihar and two in Jharkhand. 

 Modi recently suggested that Nitish Kumar is the ?natural leader? of the NDA in Patna. He also lauded Kumar for his ?commitment? to development and said he was superb as railway minister?.

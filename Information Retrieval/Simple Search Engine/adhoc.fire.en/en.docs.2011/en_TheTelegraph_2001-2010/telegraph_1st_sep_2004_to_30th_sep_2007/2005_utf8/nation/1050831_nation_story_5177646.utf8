 Minister in rural road rage

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh is ready to browbeat chief ministers and senior officials of 15 states into building roads in villages.

 But the Rashtriya Janata Dal minister has spared the bureaucrats of President-ruled Bihar, though he admits his home state is the worst case.

 In Bihar, ruled by Singhs own party almost continuously for 15 years, the idea that rural areas can have roads was not even considered before central rule was imposed a few months ago. The Rs 900 crore allocated to the state under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna lay mostly untouched till recently.

 The total allocation for Bihar was Rs 900 crore. But the money could not be used effectively. I will give you an example. In 2001-2002, an installment of Rs 360 crore was released to Bihar. Of this, only Rs 250 crore could be used, Singh said.

 But things have changed, he said. Now we have deployed central agencies like the CPWD (Central Public Works Department), NHPC (National Hydro-electric Power Corporation) and NBCC (National Building and Construction Corporation). Rural roads will improve in Bihar in record time.

 Singh denies he has been softer on his home state compared with the others ? including Jharkhand, which was part of Bihar till five years ago ? that have not spent money on roads. He says the situation in Bihar was so bad that it had to be treated as a special case.

 As for the 15 other defaulting states, the minister called their rural development secretaries to his office today for a tongue-lashing. We want these people to use the money. But they make excuses all the time, he said.

 But I am not going to spare them. I have made a note of all their explanations and called them again on October 18. I want them to use the money, not waste it. Our villages need roads; they have to make efforts to construct them.

 Singh shot off angry letters to the chief ministers of Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Punjab, Sikkim, Tripura and Uttaranchal a fortnight ago.

 The letter to Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda, sent on August 8, said: Jharkhand has been identified as one of the ten core states which require maximum resources to achieve the connectivity goal of Bharat Nirman. But the slow pace of implementation of the Gram Sadak Yojna in Jharkhand has become a serious concern for us.

 In course of the review of the programme, I noticed that Jharkhand is still in the process of completing the road works approved for the year(s) 2000-2004. Proposals for the next phases that should have been approved by now, have not been submitted as yet. I would request you to personally review the programme and ensure that the state accelerates the pace of implementation.

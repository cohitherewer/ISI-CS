 Fernandes: Plan foiled

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Centre has decided to shelve the Nalanda ordnance factory project.

 The Nalanda project was the 40th ordnance factory to have come up. Technology tie-ups with South African company Denel to manufacture propellants for heavy artillery systems were worked out during the tenure of former defence minister George Fernandes.

 Nalanda used to be the constituency of Fernandes.

 Minister of state for defence B.K. Handique has informed the Lok Sabha that an expenditure of Rs 306.04 crore has been incurred on the construction of the ordnance factory at Rajgir (in Nalanda district) till date. The construction of the factory has been kept in abeyance.

 The Centre had sanctioned Rs 941.13 crore for the project but cost overruns of 57 per cent have been estimated. Handique said an expert committee has been asked to review the project.

 The Nalanda project was to be executed between 1999-2000 and 2005-2006 but work has been at a standstill.

 The government was in talks with Denel and a German equipment manufacturer for technology to make bi-modular charges for the armys 155-mm Bofors artillery systems.

 This year, however, Denel was practically blacklisted. It has been debarred for participating in the field trials of artillery gun systems. Allegations that it used middlemen to sell anti-materiel guns to India have been referred to the CBI for investigation.

 Earlier this month, the standing committee on defence, in its seventh report to the Lok Sabha, said no new ordnance factories should come up and in case of requirement, the existing capacity and facilities should be enhanced.

 The committee also recommended that a task force should be asked to go into the issue of restructuring and/or merging existing defence ordnance factories.

 Noting that the 40th ordnance factory is to be built in Nalanda, the committee said: It is essential the ordnance factories which are producing same kind of products should be merged/integrated into one in order to synergise their resources and R amp;D and ensure optimal use of available manpower and infrastructure.

 Andhra student rapes for ?fun?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 3: A 14-year-old raped his six-year-old neighbour as friends stood guard waiting for their turn, sending shockwaves through the city.

 K. Anish took his neighbour to an isolated house in the Banjara Hills colony. The girl, who used to play with the Class X student often and also called him brother, went along unsuspectingly. Anish then raped the child as two friends kept watch.

 The shocked girl informed her parents, who first took her to a doctor and then filed a complaint at the Banjara Hills police station.

 Anish confessed immediately on being questioned. ?I just wanted to have fun,? he told the police.

 The two boys who stood guard told the police that they were waiting for their turn. ?But for the disturbance on the road and the attention that some people were paying us, I would have played a similar game with her,? Shekhar, 13, said when confronted by the police.

 Psychologists and senior police officials who investigated the case said the boys had ?performed the act? on Friday more as a game or to imitate what they saw on TV.

 ?The boys visualised the entire exercise as a sort of punishment for the girl who might have cheated them in some games. Very little did they realise the impact of rape,? said V. Mallikarjun Rao, a psychiatrist.

 The victim?s mother, Suguna, a teacher, is worried. The boys? parents dismissed her statement, when she first brought the incident to their notice. ?Our boys will never do anything like that,? they said.

 However, tension has been smouldering in the city since the boys confessed. The police are waiting for a report from doctors of the government hospital so that they can file a case of rape and abetment of the act against all the three boys.

 ?We may arrest the boys soon and let them out of custody on the personal surety of the parents that they will be produced whenever needed,? said a senior police official of Banjara Hills police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 There is room for improvement

 Reacting to the documentary, the Missionaries of Charity said physical restraints are used only when absolutely necessary for the safety of the child and for educational purposes for limited periods of time. 

 We value constructive criticism and admit that there is always room for improvement, a statement issued in Calcutta said. 

 It is only those who work day in and day out with these 59 very special children who really know both the demands to total self-forgetfulness as well as the joy at the littlest response and improvement in these children.

 Our homes continue to be simple, providing immediate and effective service to the poorest of the poor?, the statement added. We are committed to continual efforts at improving the quality of care we give them.

 Smut replay on MMS 

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Feb. 10: Chandigarh police are zeroing in on the source of a pornographic clip that has been doing the rounds on mobile phones and emails since the last couple of months.

 The 22-second clip, titled ?Hema?, shows a girl in a sexual act with a middle-aged man. Recently, a similar MMS scandal in Delhi had sent shock waves across the country.

 Police sources said the clip, believed to be part of a professionally shot film, could have been downloaded from a pornographic site on the Internet.

 ?We are looking at various angles, including the possibility of local residents being involved in the making of the film and distribution of the clip,? said a senior officer involved with the investigation. He, however, expressed dismay that despite receiving the clip, no one had come forward to report the matter. ?That is a crime, too,? he added.

 The police have registered a case under Section 67 of the IT Act and Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code after a local daily reported the matter.

 The name of a city socialite is doing the rounds for having figured in the clip, though the police deny this. ?It is a job of a professional cameraman. The woman looks towards the camera a number of times, indicating that she is aware that the act is being recorded,? the officer said.

 While the police remained tight-lipped on the involvement of a local girl with ?friends in high places?, senior superintendent of police Gaurav Yadav said investigations were on to determine the identity of those featuring in the clip. ?We are trying to ascertain the source of the clip. Once we do that, our job will be nearly complete. We will not tolerate such nuisance.?

 Cellphone service operators have been sounded to provide information on those receiving, sending and forwarding the clip. DSP (central) Subhash Sagar, who has been entrusted with the investigation, said it was imperative to determine which service provider was used to send the clip the first time.

 The police are also looking into links of people involved with flesh trade here. The police have busted a number of call girl rackets here with links in Delhi in the last few years.

 ?The sex trade continues to flourish as the city is a transit point for tourists making a beeline to the Himachal hills. While girls from various parts of the country meet their clients here, the deal is struck elsewhere,? a police officer said.

 He said several pornographic movies are being filmed in the city and surrounding areas of Punjab and Haryana.

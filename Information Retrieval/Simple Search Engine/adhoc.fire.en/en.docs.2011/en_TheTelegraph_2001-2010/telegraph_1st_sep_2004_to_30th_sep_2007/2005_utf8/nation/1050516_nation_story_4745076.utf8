 Marandi spurns peace move

 OUR BUREAU

 May 15: Babulal Marandi today spurned offers of reconciliation held out by the BJPs newly-appointed Jharkhand chief, Yadunath Pandey, even as party president L.K. Advani invited the angry leader for talks in New Delhi.

 Pandey rushed to Dumka, where Marandi is camping, to attempt a reconciliation, a day after the former chief minister threatened to go to any extent to protest against the undemocratic manner in which the state chief was picked. 

 During his nearly hour-long meeting with Marandi at the circuit house in Dumka this morning, Pandey desperately tried to win over the senior leader by requesting him to forget the past and extend a helping hand to him in running the organisation smoothly. 

 Marandi, said an aide, turned down the request. 

 I do not have any personal grudge against you. My resentment is against the manner in which decisions are taken bypassing the popular sentiments of party workers. I cannot allow the party to become a pocket organisation of some leaders, the aide quoted Marandi as having told Pandey. 

 The new state chief, who succeeded Ragubar Das last week, described the talks as fruitful. We know each other closely for over two decades. Both of us worked for the Sangh parivar. I promised him he would play a decisive role in running the organisation, Pandey said, but clamped up when asked what response he got. 

 Marandis aide claimed Pandeys overtures failed to cut much ice. Babulal clearly told him it is not possible for him to reconcile to the fact that party decisions are taken by a handful of leaders for their own vested interests, he said. 

 The former chief minister has said he would resign his Koderma Lok Sabha seat and also quit as vice-president of the party if the high command did not reconsider the decision to appoint Pandey. He has given the leadership until Tuesday to set things right. 

 Not willing to let the issue snowball in a state where the party is clinging on to power, the BJP high command swung into action. 

 Advani spoke to chief minister Arjun Munda last night and expressed anguish at the manner in which some party leaders were rushing to the media to give statements that were tarnishing the image of the party. He is understood to have invited Marandi for talks in Delhi and iron out differences. 

 BJP vice president and Jharkhand in-charge Rajnath Singh called up Marandi and urged him not to take any decision in haste. Rajnath, who is expected to reach Ranchi after May 17, has been blamed by Marandis supporters for adding fuel to the fire. 

 Senior BJP leader Karia Munda came out in Marandis support and demanded action against Rajnath. The BJP, he said, would be digging its own grave if it antagonised Marandi.

 Karia argued that veterans who nurtured the party with their sweat and blood have been isolated. We have nothing against Yadunath Pandey, but the way he has been made the state president is highly objectionable.

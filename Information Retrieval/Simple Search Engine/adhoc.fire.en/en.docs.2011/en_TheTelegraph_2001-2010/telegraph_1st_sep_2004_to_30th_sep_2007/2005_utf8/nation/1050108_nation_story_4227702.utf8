 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 7: Patna High Court today ordered that every returning officer be accompanied by a police officer and an executive magistrate so that criminals, against whom non-bailable arrest warrants and/or property attachment orders are pending, could be arrested when they come to file nomination papers.

 On Wednesday, the court had asked the state police to submit a list of criminals, who were at large in the state. Following the order, Bihar director-general of police (DGP) Narayan Mishra today told the court that there are around 20,000 absconders ? 5,000 more than what was earlier revealed ? and the police were in the process of preparing a comprehensive list.

 During the last hearing, inspector general (headquarters) Neelmani had represented the DGP and revealed that there were more than 15,000 absconders in the state.

 Today, the DGP pleaded that the preparation of the list is a cumbersome process and would require more time. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai then directed the DGP to prepare districtwise lists, which should reach the respective returning officers before the nomination process begins on January 10.

 The court also ruled that if any absconding criminal turned up to file his/her nomination, the returning officer concerned should get the person arrested with the help of the magistrate and the police officer.

 The two officers will remain with the returning officer till the end of the nomination process, the bench said.

 ?Criminalisation of politics should be stopped at any cost,? the court said while directing the DGP to arrest all criminals before the Assembly elections next month. ?Article 342 provides for free and fair elections. Today, we are committed to make it fearless also,? the bench observed.

 The bench reminded the police chief that though a directive to this effect was issued a month ago, the police have so far failed to execute it.

 Chief electoral officer K.C. Saha told the court that the poll panel too was committed to making the elections ?free, fair and fearless?. ?Unfortunately, the state police have failed to arrest absconding criminals,? he said.

 Even as the Indian Medical Association?s PIL was being heard in the courtroom, another drama was unfolding outside as hundreds of university students demonstrated against the government?s new policy, which has made it compulsory for candidates to secure 60 per cent marks for the bank probation officers? examination.

 A couple of students even tried to immolate themselves but prompt police action foiled their attempt.

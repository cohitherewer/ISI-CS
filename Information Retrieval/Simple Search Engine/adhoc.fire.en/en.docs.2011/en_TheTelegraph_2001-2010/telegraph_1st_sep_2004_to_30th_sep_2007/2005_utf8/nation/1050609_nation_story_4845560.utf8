 Bihar effect on friend amp; foe

 June 8: Bihar elections have prompted an ally and an adversary of L.K. Advani to say in public what his party would not.

 As the BJP continued to walk a tightrope on Advanis comments on Mohammed Ali Jinnah, NDA convener George Fernandes said the former had merely stated a historical fact.

 Fernandess party, the Janata Dal (United), is a key player in the poll-bound Bihar. The Dal (U) said today that the party could not remain a silent spectator to the developments ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections.

 Fernandes has convened a meeting of its MPs, central office-bearers and senior leaders in Delhi tomorrow to review the situation.

 However, Fernandes added that the events unfolding in the BJP would not have any bearing on the NDA.

 Another Bihar contender and an ally of the Congress, Ram Vilas Paswan, too, defended the BJP leader. 

 Paswan asked Advani to ignore the criticism of the VHP and remain firm on his stand.

 Extending his partys support to Advani, Paswan said in Patna: Advani must be firm on his stand and work for secularism. The Lok Janshakti Party extends full support to Advani on his remarks on Jinnah as they are based on historical facts. 

 Paswan has been trying to emerge as the spokesperson of the minorities in Bihar. 

 Asked to comment on the reaction of Laloo Prasad Yadav who termed Advanis resignation a drama, Paswan said: I dont know if it is drama or it is a natural comment made by Advani. If people like Advani remain firm on his view, Laloo Prasad will be nowhere. 

 Fernandes, Atal Bihari Vajpayees favourite troubleshooter when the NDA was in power, said it was unfortunate that the Sangh parivar had made a hue and cry over Advanis remarks on Jinnah.

 If any one who should be annoyed by Laljis remark, it should be the Congress, he said in Guwahati. Quoting veteran politicians and historians, Fernandes said it was Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress who were responsible for the countrys division.

 It was the Congresss betrayal which had forced Jinnah to demand a separate nation on the basis of religion.

 It was in 1935 that the Congress and Jinnahs party entered into an agreement to jointly contest in the ensuing elections and to form a government together. But after the elections, Nehru backtracked from the earlier promise, Fernandes said.

 This development, he added, had pushed Jinnah out of secular politics. Fernandes also called for a national debate on the issue.

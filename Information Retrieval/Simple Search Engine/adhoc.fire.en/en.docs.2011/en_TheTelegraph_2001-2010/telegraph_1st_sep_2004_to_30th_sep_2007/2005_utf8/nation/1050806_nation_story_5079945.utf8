 Bush and Beijing gang up against G4

 K.P. NAYAR

 New York, Aug. 5: George W. Bushs handpicked new ambassador to the UN yesterday roped in China to work together with him in opposing Security Council reform.

 The agreement will potentially deal a death blow to Indias efforts to win a permanent seat on the Security Council.

 The pact between John Bolton and Chinas ambassador to the world body, Wang Guangya, came close on the heels of an emergency African summit in Addis Ababa, which refused to water down the continents demand for two permanent seats with veto power in a reformed Security Council.

 India, which sent a delegation to Addis Ababa headed by South Blocks secretary dealing with Africa, had hoped to persuade the summit to compromise on that demand and jointly table a General Assembly resolution with the Group of Four (G4) states seeking Security Council reform.

 Other G4 countries ? Germany, Japan and Brazil ? had also joined forces with India in this effort at the African Union (AU) summit even as Nigerias president Olusegun Obasanjo, the AU president, warned the continents leaders. We need to negotiate with other groups, unless our objective is to prevent any decision. If that happens, let us be under no illusion: Africa stands to lose more than any other region.

 But Obasanjos warning fell on deaf ears at the summit, and speaking for the majority in the AU, Sudans foreign minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, said: We are not ready to accept a distorted resolution which will divide the Security Council into three categories: one permanent group with veto power, another permanent group without veto power and (a) third group with rotating representation. This is totally unacceptable.

 Meanwhile, Wang met Bolton a day after the latter presented his credentials to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and then told reporters: We agreed to work together to make sure that our interests are maintained.... At this stage, our objective will be to oppose the G4, to make sure they do not have sufficient votes to take the risk to divide the house.

 The US has been without a permanent representative to the UN all through the second Bush term because the Senate refused to confirm Bolton, a neo-conservative who has been accused of everything from undiplomatic behaviour and doctoring US intelligence to high-handedness and misleading the Congress.

 But the White House this week bypassed the Senate and used a rare constitutional provision which authorises the president to temporarily nominate an ambassador.

 Delhi on Africa

 India has said it will continue to negotiate with the African Union in spite of it rejecting the G4 proposal. It is a matter of regret that the extraordinary African Union summit held in Addis Ababa was unable to endorse an AU/G4? agreement in London on July 25, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said in Delhi. Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh has spoken to G4 counterparts following yesterdays development.

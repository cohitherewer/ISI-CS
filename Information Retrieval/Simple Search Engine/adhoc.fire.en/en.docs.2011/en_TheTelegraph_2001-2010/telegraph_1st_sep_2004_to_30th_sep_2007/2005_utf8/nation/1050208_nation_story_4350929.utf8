 Online store faces flak over gods on innerwear

 Washington, Feb. 7 (PTI): An American online store, selling women?s undergarments featuring images of Hindu Gods and religious icons, has sparked anger among members of the community who have demanded their immediate withdrawal from the website.

 In an ad for women?s thongs, caf?-press.com ? the online store ? has on display 100 per cent cotton ?Hindu God Shiva Classic Thong? depicting the face of the deity and priced at $12.99. Another, called ?God Shiva Classic Thong?, costing $15, states: ?Namaste it loud. You?re Hindu and you?re proud.? The ?Om Classic Thong?, priced at $8.99, explains: ?Om is a sacred Hindu symbol that represents the absolute.?

 American Hindus Against Defamation ? the largest Hindu anti-defamation group in North America, comprising several religious organisations ? has raised voice for withdrawal of the product range from the website. 

 ?We have recently come across two sets of products ? thongs and boxer shorts with the images of Hindu deities and symbols imprinted on them...Ahad finds the depiction of universally revered Hindu deities and symbols on the undergarments extremely offensive,? the group said in a statement. 

 Last week, caf?-press.com had offended the Sikh community by displaying a range of thongs with the khanda emblem representing the four pillars of the Sikh faith. Organisations under the World Sikh Council ? America Region (WSC-AR) had objected to the display of the thongs and had asked the portal to withdraw the offensive garments.

 The protests bore fruit? caf?-press.com withdrew the product line from its website.

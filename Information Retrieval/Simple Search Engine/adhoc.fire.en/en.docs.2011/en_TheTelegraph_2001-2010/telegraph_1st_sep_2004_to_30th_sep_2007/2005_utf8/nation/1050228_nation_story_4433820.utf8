 Pak bouncer on Dalai role

 Dalai: On a sticky pitch

 Feb. 27: Three days before the googlies grip and rip on the ground, a snorter outside the cricket arena jarred the tour of the Pakistani team. 

 The Pakistan Cricket Board has expressed misgivings about the Dalai Lama inaugurating the three-day tour-opener at Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile. 

 The Pakistan team squares off against the Board President?s XI at the Himachal Pradesh town from March 3 to 5. 

 ?The PCB chairman, Shaharyar Khan, spoke to the Indian board officials on Saturday insisting that Pakistan should not be put in an embarrassing position as it enjoyed very good relations with China,? a PCB source was quoted by a Pakistani daily. 

 ?BCCI conveyed to Shaharyar that it was not their decision to invite the Dalai Lama to inaugurate the match and that this was done by the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association,? the source said. 

 When contacted, HPCA president Anurag Thakur tried to clear the air. ?No formal inauguration has been planned. Moreover, the invitation to the Dalai Lama makes no mention of him being introduced to the Pakistani team,? he said. 

 Thakur explained that as this would be Himachal?s biggest match so far, they wanted to honour the Dalai Lama. 

 Earlier, the tour was caught on a sticky wicket at Ahmedabad, with the Pakistanis refusing to play a Test there. The tangle was sorted by assigning the Test to Calcutta and scheduling a one-dayer in Gujarat. 

 The daily also reported that Khan asked the BCCI to be very selective while confirming future engagements of the Pakistan team on the tour. 

 Kashmir soccer

 Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is planning a friendly soccer match with a team from Jammu and Kashmir to further boost relations after the proposed bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, agencies reported. 

 ?Sport plays an important role in bringing people closer. Because the road is being opened, I have asked the government (Islamabad) here to allow soccer matches,? said PoK sports minister Deewan Ali Chughtai. 

 In Jammu and Kashmir, a top official said: ?Why not? With permission from the government of India, we would like to promote cultural and sport ties.?

 Chughtai said he also hoped to arrange cross-border cricket matches in the region.

 Tunnel rescue 

 RIPUNJOY DAS

 Gerukamukh (Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border), Aug. 8: Trapped in a tunnel that was blocked by a landslide last night, 14 workers engaged in the Lower Subansiri Hydroelectric project were brought to safety this evening after a marathon rescue operation spanning 19 hours. 

 Over 1,000 rescue workers, including security personnel, and 20 excavators worked through the night and the entire day to remove 35,000 cubic metres of mud from the blocked entrance to the tunnel. The 14 workers, muddied but in good spirits, hollered in joy as the rescue workers shovelled away the last chunk of earth, signalling the end of the operation around 6.30 pm. They had been trapped inside the tunnel since 11.30 pm yesterday.

 All 14 workers had been engaged by Larsen and Toubro. One of the rescued workers, electrician Srinath Singh, said: We were all huddled together. All were silent except for one or two questions. We were mostly wondering what would be our fate.

 Pradip Kumar Nath, hailing from Tezpur, echoed him. We were totally cut off, unable to even hear what was going on outside. It was only around 12 pm today that we could faintly hear the sound of machines at work just outside the tunnel.

 Chief medical officer of the project, H. Sonowal, said all the rescued workers were in fine shape. They were given first-aid.

 Sonowal said all of them would remain under observation tonight as they may have suffered some trauma. 

 Most of the workers are from Sonitpur district, while two are from Nepal and one from Arunachal Pradesh.

 J. Henry Robertson, executive director of the Subansiri Basin of the National Hydro Electric Corporation (NHPC), said work on the 2,000-MW project would continue as usual. The accident will not hamper work. It was a natural calamity over which we have no control. We are just happy that nobody was harmed.

 The workers had entered the tunnel around 7 pm for a routine eight-hour night shift. Around 11.25 pm, they heard a rumble and the ground beneath their feet shook. The workers knew instantly that they were trapped.

 The hills, part of the Sivalik range, are known to be unstable. The area has been experiencing continuous rain since August 2, which has loosened the earth.

 Hurriyat offer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, July 6: The Hurriyat Conference has invited Kashmiri Pandit leaders to Srinagar to discuss their return to the Valley.

 A delegation of Kashmiri Pandits will meet the Hurriyats general council, chaired by Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, on July 19, said Syed Salim Geelani, the in-charge of the public contact programme of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat. He has been nominated the interlocutor for the talks. Over 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits had migrated from Kashmir to Jammu and other parts of the country as militancy peaked in the Valley 15 years ago. 

 The meeting will mark the beginning of interaction between the Hurriyat and Kashmiri migrants and would send a joint message to both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu communities that they have to unite again, Geelani said. 

 Admitting that there might be shortcomings in this first but crucial step, he said, we are hopeful of its long-term success.

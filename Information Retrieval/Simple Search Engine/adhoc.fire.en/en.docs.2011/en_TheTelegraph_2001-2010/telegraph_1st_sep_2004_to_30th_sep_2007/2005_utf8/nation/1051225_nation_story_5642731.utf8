 Singh takes stock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, Dec. 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today chaired a meeting of senior officials to take stock of the countrys response to the tsunami, two days before the first anniversary of the disaster. 

 The Prime Minister is likely to visit the Andaman and Nicobar islands ? where the waves had lashed the hardest, wiping out land and lives ? to assess relief and rehabilitation work.

 However, official sources said no date has been fixed and the trip may not take place this year.

 According to a presentation made at the meeting, the relief initiative in the tsunami-battered states and Union territories is the largest ever undertaken through the Prime Ministers National Relief Fund. It involves an expenditure of Rs 99 crore over 10 years. 

 The fund covers a range of schemes for survivors, including ex-gratia, scholarships to children, psycho-social support mechanisms, universal health insurance and aid to fishermen and those who had taken bank loans.

 The child assistance scheme created fixed deposits of Rs 51,000 for each child. Once the child turns 18, the amount, along with the interest, would be given to him or her for further education or self-employment.

 The psycho-social support mechanism includes rehabilitation and vocational training centres for the physically challenged victims and special career counselling centres in Kerala.

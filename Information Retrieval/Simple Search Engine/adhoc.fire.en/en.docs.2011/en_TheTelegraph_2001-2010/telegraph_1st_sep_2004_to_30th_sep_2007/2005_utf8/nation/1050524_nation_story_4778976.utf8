 The Buta build-up, brick by brick

 ASHISH SINHA

 Buta Singh

 Patna, May 23: Politician, social worker, agriculturist and journalist ? governor Buta Singh wears many a hat on the Bihar governments website. But the Congress veterans undeclared skills were at play when he pre-empted what was to unfold in the state.

 The governor spent a good part of last week levelling charges of horse-trading, basing his allegations on intelligence reports and information from political sources. He went to the extent of blaming the National Democratic Alliance for trying to wean away legislators with money.

 An NDA leader said the Delhi trip of the Lok Janshakti Party legislators and the mounting pressure on Ram Vilas Paswan to support a non-Rashtriya Janata Dal government did not remain hidden from Singh.

 It was all too obvious. After the LJP legislators met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Paswans attitude towards the RJD softened. The MLAs were surprised because their president had been rubbishing the BJP and RJD equally. It was at this point that the pressure to support the Janata Dal (United) came on Paswan, said the NDA leader, who had been in touch with two Lok Janshakti MLAs.

 Singh was continuously testing the waters. On Thursday, despite a protest by Paswan, former chief secretary Arun Pathak was appointed the governors adviser. Before that the district magistrates of Siwan and Gopalganj were transferred. On Saturday, Patna inspector-general of police Abhayanand was transferred... the LJP leader said.

 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said the presumptions based on which the allegations were made by Singh were suspect. In this sense, Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi was better because before inviting Shibu Soren to form a government he met the five Independent MLAs. Singh looked determined to dissolve the Assembly on the orders of the Congress and under pressure from Laloo Prasad.

 The governor gave the impression that he had full information of the goings-on. 

 The Intelligence Bureau office, which is usually closed on Sundays, was open yesterday.

 The timing to beef-up paramilitary presence in Patna was also crucial. A Rapid Action Force officer said his unit got orders on telephone from the Central Reserve Police Force director-generals control room at 12.30 pm yesterday. The written orders came in the next hour. We were on the road by 2.30 pm, he said.

 The chain of events hints that the Centre could have anticipated dissolving the Assembly latest by noon yesterday. 

 But that is strange because Lok Janshakti MP Suraj Bhan boarded a flight to Delhi with his MLAs around the same time and Paswan addressed the media much later denying a split in the party. It seems he was not taken into confidence about the Centres move.

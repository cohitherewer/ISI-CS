 Hint of Bush meet 

 PRANAY SHARMA

 Singh, Bush: Talks 

 ahead? 

 New Delhi, May 5: Manmohan Singh and George W. Bush could meet in Moscow next week on the sidelines of the 60th Victory Day celebrations. 

 The Indian Prime Minister and the US President will be in the Russian capital along with 60 world leaders to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. 

 Singh will leave for Moscow on May 8. The celebrations are scheduled for the next day. On May 10, the Prime Minister and his team will return.

 But it is not clear as to when exactly Singh and Bush will meet. The US Presidents visit is part of his tour of the region and he will be there for a very short period ? probably less than 24 hours. 

 Indian officials are not willing to commit on a possible meeting. ?Even if it does (take place), it will not be a substantial meeting,? a South Block source said. But that does not mean the Indian side is not trying for one ? irrespective of the duration of the meet.

 Indian officials pointed out that even if Singh and Bush do not meet in Moscow, the two would be meeting at length in two months when the Prime Minister goes to Washington. ?If the two can meet in Moscow, it is fine. But even if they dont, nobody is going to lose their sleep over it,? an official in South Block said.

 A number of world leaders, including Chinese President Hu Jintao and French President Jacques Chirac, will be in Moscow. Prime Minister Tony Blair will not attend the meet due to his preoccupation with elections in Britain.

 Sources said Singh is likely to have a substantial bilateral meeting with Russian President and host Vladimir Putin. 

 The two may exchange notes on a number of developments that have taken place in their respective regions.

 Foul cry over shield to doctors

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: A public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court today challenged the formation of the West Bengal Medical Board and the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments recent executive order to the police chief not to arrest a delinquent doctor in a medical negligence case.

 The petition, by the Calcutta-based organisation People for Better Treatment, sought a directive to the state government to rescind or withdraw the order issued by the principal secretary.

 In its order, the state government had directed the police commissioner not to arrest any doctor involved in a case of medical negligence, including one that has resulted in a patients death, without the consent of the specially-constituted medical board. It has been left to the boards expert committee to verify and judge whether a doctor is really guilty of medical negligence.

 The petition contended that any special directions not to arrest a particular class of citizens under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code clearly violates the Constitution that says no individual could be discriminated, segregated, separated and distinguished in the eyes of the law based on their professional status (and) position.

 The executive order, it added, was capricious, arbitrary and mala fide. Avik Datta, counsel for the petitioner, said the Constitution provides for equality before law and equal application of law under Article 14 and the Bengal governments order violates this basic fundamental chapter.

 There can be no argument that the Constitution of India provides unwavering equality and equal protection before law for all citizens of the country, he argued.

 The petition has been filed through the activist organisations president, Kunal Saha, a US-based doctor from Calcutta, who had initiated a case of negligence after his wife died in 1998 at Mumbais Breach Candy Hospital after a few days of treatment at the Advanced Medicare and Research Institute in Calcutta.

 The petition, which has named as respondents the chief minister, the state government, the principal, home and health secretaries and the police commissioner, said any directive by a chief minister to amend or modify a section of the penal code for a specific group is blatantly illegal.

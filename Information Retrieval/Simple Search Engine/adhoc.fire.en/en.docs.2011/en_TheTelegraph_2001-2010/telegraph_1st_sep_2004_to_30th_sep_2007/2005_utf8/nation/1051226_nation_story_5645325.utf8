 Mellow Christmas in mourning town

 The spectre of last years tsunami hung like a shroud as Velankanni woke up to a mellow Christmas morning. 

 The Shrine of Our Lady of Health, which draws hordes of pilgrims from across the country during the festive season, was forlorn with less than one-fifth of the usual number trooping in.

 The waves came on to the shore, gently, but Velankanni, 10 km south of Nagapattinam, could not woo back its annual visitors. 

 More than 1,000 people had died here, most of them from Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, when the gigantic waves lashed the Tamil Nadu coast on the morning after last Christmas. The unofficial toll could be much higher as thousands were reported missing and are still untraced.

 Yes, there has been a fall in the number of visitors to the church at this time of the year when compared to previous years, said Father P. Xavier, the rector of the 17th century shrine, which was elevated to the status of a minor basilica by the Vatican in 1962. 

 A special prayer for tsunami victims will be held in the basilica tomorrow.

 Buxar, Jan. 31: Campaign frenzy peaked on the penultimate day here with Sonia Gandhi, Lal Krishna Advani and Laloo Prasad Yadav addressing different meetings within a radius of 2 km and in a span of less than two hours.

 Sporting a grey saree, the Congress president admitted that the overall situation in Bihar was not good and said the party would build ?pressure? on the next ?secular? government in the state.

 ?We are aware of the kidnappings and killings in Bihar. The Congress realises its responsibility in Bihar. The state government should act strongly and that is why we want to build pressure on it,? she said.

 Sonia said Bihar had ?unique problems? of illiteracy, underdevelopment, poverty and law and order. ?Outward migration of labour and educated youths also needs to be addressed. The Congress will fight for all sections,? she told a crowd which had assembled despite a continuous drizzle.

 Advani lambasted the Congress chief for being ?aware? of the law and order situation in Haryana and turning ?blind? in Bihar.

 ?The 14-year vanvaas of Bihar is over. The state needs a change and its people should act now to throw out the opportunistic RJD and Congress,? the BJP president said. ?I ask Sonia Gandhi if Bihar is an exception for her and the Congress. Her party has been part of a government that has ruined Bihar.?

 While Sonia did not refer to the RJD, Laloo Prasad reciprocated by not naming the Congress. The RJD chief, however, talked at length about the interim report on the Godhra train fire.

 ?People who killed unborn children have no right to rule Bihar. This state has always showed the right way to the nation. Our victory in the parliamentary elections is a proof of that,? Laloo said.

 ?Sankaracharya has shown the true face of Hindutva. Uma Bharti has proved the BJP?s double standards,? he added.

 The RJD president was campaigning along with Sitaram Yechury for CPM candidate Allyosha Prakash. The BJP?s Sukhada Pandey is trying to retain the Buxar seat, while the Congress has fielded Aniruddh Pandey.

 On her next stop at Arrah, Sonia continued her indirect attack on the RJD government. ?Communal harmony, women?s empowerment and rural development are our priorities. We are not in the habit of forgetting our poll promises. The electricity, water and road situation in Bihar needs improvement.?

 The Congress chief said that her party?s ?alliance? was necessary for the development of Bihar. 

 Sonia said the Congress joined the RJD government not for ministerial berths, but to improve Bihar. 

 Laloo Prasad, on the other hand, stressed on his 20-year ?agreement? with the people to rule Bihar. ?If you reject me after 20 years, I will act in films,? the RJD leader said.

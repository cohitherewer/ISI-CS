 Double troops for twin borders 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Guwahati, March 27: Delhi has decided to double the deployment of forces along the country?s porous boundaries with Bhutan and Nepal to prevent cross-border movement of militants, mainly those of Northeast groups.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil today said the cabinet had recently approved an additional 20 battalions of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), which took over the responsibility of guarding the India-Nepal border in June 2001 and the boundary with Bhutan in March last year. 

 The change had been effected on the recommendation of the group of ministers on national security.

 The home minister, who was the chief guest at the border force?s 42nd Raising Day parade, said the number of security personnel deployed there would be doubled in three years. 

 Officials of the Seema Bal concede that they have had to stretch the forces too thinly along the two borders, at times positioning border outposts at a distance of anywhere between 6 to 15 km apart, against the recommended 3.5 km.

 The government moved a battalion of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police to the India-Bhutan border to keep a watch on the movements of Nepal Maoists trying to infiltrate Bhutan. 

 Intelligence agencies have reported that some militant groups are trying to re-establish camps in Bhutan. Some of these groups are even trying to establish links with the Maoists of Nepal.

 SSB director-general Himanshu Kumar said the force would have 41 companies after the implementation of the expansion plans approved by the cabinet. 

 Guwahati will be its new frontier headquarters. One of the sector headquarters will be the Lower Assam district of Bongaigaon. The location of the other has not been finalised, Kumar said.

 Pune test for dengue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Blood samples of dengue patients from Calcutta have arrived at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune where the dengue virus will be subject to molecular analysis to decipher its lineage. 

 Dengue viruses display subtle genetic variations and are classified into four types. The NIV studies will aim at identifying the type of the virus responsible for the current outbreak in Bengal, NIV director Akhilesh Mishra said.

 Information about types of dengue viruses circulating in India will be important for any policies about future vaccines against dengue, Mishra said. 

 A commercial vaccine to protect people from dengue does not exist today, but researchers in the US and Thailand have developed an experimental vaccine.

 Scientists said an effective vaccine against dengue would have to protect people from all four types of the virus. Immunisation against one type of the virus does not protect people from the others.

 In fact, a person whos been vaccinated against type 1 dengue virus who gets infected with type 2 would be at risk of getting severe disease, said Mishra.

 Scientists have called it antibody enhancement phenomenon, thats peculiar to the dengue virus. Antibodies exclusively against one type allow another type to cause severe disease in the immunised person. This makes vaccine design very tricky, Mishra said.

 The US-Thailand effort involved mixing the four types to create a cocktail of dengue viruses to serve as a vaccine, said Umesh Chaturvedi, a senior microbiologist, formerly with the King George Medical College in Lucknow.

 Mishra said the NIV routinely analyses dengue viruses during outbreaks that occur anywhere in India. Studies indicate that all four types of dengue are circulating in India and type 2 once appeared to be most common.

 He said typing of the dengue viruses in India will also help scientists track its origins. By analysing the viruses at the genetic level, virologists might be able to tell whether they have migrated into India or are indigenous viruses that have just resurfaced.

 A team of scientists at the NIV has initiated research on a dengue vaccine but, Mishra said, an indigenous experimental vaccine is still many years away.

 The greatest hurdle to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this disease and to developing a vaccine is the absence of any animal model for dengue haemmorhagic fever, said Chaturvedi, who had spent the 1990s trying to study dengue in mice.

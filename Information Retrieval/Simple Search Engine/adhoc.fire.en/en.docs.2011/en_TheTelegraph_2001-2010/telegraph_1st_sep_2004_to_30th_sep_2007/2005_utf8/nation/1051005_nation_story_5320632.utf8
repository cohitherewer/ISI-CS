 Sonia push for slum bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia: Pro-poor

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Sonia Gandhi wants the government to bring a national slum bill which would end forced eviction of slum dwellers and provide low-cost housing for the poor.

 Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh today led a delegation of Left leaders, including Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan, to 10 Janpath to talk to the Congress chief about the spate of evictions going on in metropolitan cities.

 They asked Sonia to bring a legislation that would immediately stop the evictions and ensure poor families living in slums were accommodated in low-cost houses.

 Sonia agreed (that) the government should bring a national slum policy, Bardhan said, adding if need be, the Centre could pass an executive order to speed up the process. A legislation will have to wait till Parliaments winter session begins on November 23. 

 The provisions of the slum bill can only be worked out after consultation with experts. But the delegation has placed before Sonia some salient features they believe should be included.

 Apart from the call to stop forced evictions, the delegation said there should be periodic census in slums and the urban poor issued identity cards.

 The leaders said though slums had come up on government land, dwellers could not be thrown out without any alternative housing arrangements. 

 The bill should confer ownership rights to both spouses. The government should provide loans for construction of houses on easy terms.

 The bill should ensure rehabilitation of the poor and they should not be resettled in far-off places, which would disrupt their work and life. 

 Slums should not be relocated at a place more than 2 km from the original site. While communities are being relocated, they should not be scattered. They should have their social ties intact to facilitate the process of rehabilitation, a leader said.

 The sprouting of slums on government land is not peculiar to any one city. It runs through Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad. Recently, Mumbai witnessed a spate of demolition drives, which turned into a major political issue.

 The delegation said migration to cities and towns was inevitable. Currently, 30 per cent of Indias population live in towns. Fifty-two per cent of the urban population have little sanitation facilities and 35 per cent live in slums.

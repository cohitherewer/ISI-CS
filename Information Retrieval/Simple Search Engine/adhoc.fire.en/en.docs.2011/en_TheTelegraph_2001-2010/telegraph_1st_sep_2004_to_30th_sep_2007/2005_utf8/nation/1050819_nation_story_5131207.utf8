 Dead soldier admits murder

 Dehra dun (PTI): A soldier who faked his death at the Indian Military Academy here two years ago has allegedly confessed to murdering a washerman and disguising the body as his own. 

 Sepoy Suraj Singh Negi, arrested recently, said he wanted to get away from his family and live with his girlfriend.

 We have interrogated Negi, a police source said. He has confessed to having murdered Kalua, a dhobi, to show that he was dead.

 Negi disappeared from the IMA premises on December 10, 2003. An army patrol noticed a fire in the barracks that night and found a charred body. It was identified as that of Negi.

 Negi was arrested in Bhatinda in July this year on the charge of spying. He had been asking for directions to defence installations in the cantonment town and enquiring about the families of Kargil martyrs, arousing suspicion.

 Bail refused to blast accused

 New Delhi: Coimbatore serial blast accused Abdul Nazar Madani yet again failed to get relief as the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected his bail plea in the seven-year-old case, reports our legal correspondent.

 The Peoples Democratic Party leader, in custody since the 1998 blasts that killed 59 people, had sought bail on the ground that he needed urgent treatment at an ayurvedic centre in Kerala for several ailments.

 His counsel said Madani was suffering from systematic hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cervical spondylosis and lumber disc prolapse.

 Taking into account a report by medical experts, the court said the accused had repeatedly refused to be examined by ayurvedic doctors and declined to take medicines.

 Student beaten

Neelam Sharma beat him with a stick on Tuesday for not doing his assignment. Himanshus father says he was told his son had fainted. He (Himanshu) said the teacher had asked him not to tell his parents anything. The teacher was not available for comment. 

 Bird-hit flight

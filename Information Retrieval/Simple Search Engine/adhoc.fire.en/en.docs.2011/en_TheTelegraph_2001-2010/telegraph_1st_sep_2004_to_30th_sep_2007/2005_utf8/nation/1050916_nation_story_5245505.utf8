 Pullout as good as surrender, says army

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: Pakistans demand for a pullout by Indian troops from Baramulla and Kupwara districts will be tantamount to surrendering a gateway to the Kashmir Valley and two routes to Srinagar, Indian Army sources said today.

 In New York yesterday, Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf linked progress on bilateral talks with India to a troop pullout from certain areas in Kashmir. Subsequently, Pakistans ambassador to the US, Jahangir Karamat, identified these areas as Baramulla and Kupwara.

 The Indian Army has been instructed by the Prime Minister to constantly review troop levels in Kashmir since a limited withdrawal was ordered by Manmohan Singh in November last year. 

 But there has been no thinning of army presence in Baramulla and Kupwara, two adjacent districts in the north and northwest of the Valley because of the topography of the region and the strategic importance.

 Last September, in a slew of military confidence-building measures proposed to Pakistan by India in a background paper, New Delhi suggested that division commanders of the two armies have a hotline connection in a number of places across the Line of Control and specifically in Baramulla and Kupwara.

 Army headquarters can consider reducing troop presence in these districts only in the event of a ceasefire in counter-insurgency operations. The ceasefire with Pakistan along the Line of Control holds.

 Baramulla and Kupwara are frontline districts north of the Pir Panjal range. Baramulla is policed by the armys 19 Infantry Division that also shares responsibility for Kupwara along with the Gurez-based 28 Mountain Division. The alignment of the fence built by the army runs parallel to almost the entire LoC in these two districts. 

 An army officer who has commanded divisions and brigades in the region explained that the Indian Army holds dominating positions on the Shamshabari ridgeline north of Kupwara and above the Uri Bowl west of Baramulla. Approached from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the Indian positions begin just before the Shamshabari Ridge along the Bugina river and Tangdhar Bowl.

 If we were to withdraw from these positions, we would only be sitting in the plains of Srinagar, he said.

 The Indian Armys deployments in the adjacent districts of Baramulla and Kupwara are backed up by the Rashtriya Rifles. Both these districts are also favoured by militants seeking to infiltrate into the Valley. 

 Baramulla is also home to Sopore town, the stronghold of Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who commands support there with his stand in favour of merging Kashmir with Pakistan.

 The heavy army presence in the two districts has also resulted in harassment of civilians. In July this year, the army apologised profusely after three teenagers were killed in Kupwara. The teenagers were mistaken for militants moving in the night. 

 Baramulla town ? the second biggest urban centre in the Valley ? is also on the route from Muzaffarabad in PoK to Srinagar. Another route from Kupwara to Srinagar bypasses the town. 

 There are an estimated 11 infantry battalions deployed by the army along the LoC. These are backed up by four divisions of the Rashtriya Rifles, which is manned by the army but technically reports to the Union home ministry.

 Debt hint in UAE familys killing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dubai, Sept. 25: Police are investigating a case in which an Indian civil engineer has killed his wife and four children before committing suicide in his Sharjah apartment. 

 The motive behind the killings and suicide by 38-year-old Mohammad Raziuddin from Andhra Pradesh is not clear.

 Initial reports suggest that Raziuddin slit the throats of his wife Afshan, 30, and four children ? Abdul Hamid, 12, Bushra, 11, Umaima, 6, and Sania, 8 months ? and then used the same weapon to end his life in his flat in Sharjahs industrial area on Friday.

 Social workers say a steep rise in rent and living expenses have put Indian families here in dire straits, with many trapped in so much debt that they have little hope of ever leaving this country after clearing their dues. However, it is not known whether this was Raziuddins case too. He worked in a consultancy firm here. 

 A relative said Raziuddin had rung up his father on Thursday to inform him that things were not going right and that he and his family were returning home on Friday. 

 But when his son did not come back, Raziuddins father called his Sharjah home from Hyderabad. When no one took the calls for 24 hours, he alerted the relative in Dubai.

 On reaching Raziuddins house, the relative found the door locked and asked the building watchman to break in. The watchman, however, called police who found the bodies inside. 

 An official statement is yet to be released.

 A neighbour described the family as quiet and religious and regular worshippers at the nearby mosque.

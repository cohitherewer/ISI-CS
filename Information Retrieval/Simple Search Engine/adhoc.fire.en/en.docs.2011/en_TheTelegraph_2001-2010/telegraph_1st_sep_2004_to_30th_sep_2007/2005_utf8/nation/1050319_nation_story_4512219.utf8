 Student killed in school blast

 Srinagar: A powerful blast killed a Class-X 

 student and injured six in a school in Baramulla district 

 on Friday, reports our correspondent.

 Suspected militants tossed a handgrenade into the compound of the government high school in Nadihal village, Kashmir inspector-general of police Javaid Mukhdoomi said. 

 ?One Class-X student, identified as Asif Ahmed Lone, died on the spot, while six were injured in the explosion,? Mukhdoomi said.

 No one has claimed responsibility for the blast at the north Kashmir school, 50 km from here.

 Police sources said the actual target of the militants could have been the Rashtriya Rifles camp adjacent to the school.

 Doctors at the Bandipore subdistrict hospital, where the injured students were taken, referred five to Srinagar for treatment.

 HC rejects Vinod house plea

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on 

 Friday refused to give more time to BJP MP Vinod Khanna 

 to vacate the ministerial bungalow allotted to him by the 

 National Democratic Alliance government.

 Justice Gita Mittal advised him to request the directorate of estate or the minister who has been allotted the 4, Circular Road bungalow to let him stay for a few more days.

 The actor, who on March 1 given an undertaking to the court to vacate the bungalow by March 15, had sought 30 more days on the ground that the furnishing of his new bungalow at AB-8, Purana Quila Road, was ?grossly incomplete?.

 His plea was opposed by the Centre?s counsel, Kailash Gambhir, who said Khanna?s new residence is habitable.

 Khanna, an MP from Gurdaspur in Punjab, was first served a notice on September 6, 2004, about the cancellation of allotment of the Circular Road residence. The last eviction notice was served in February.

 Pak ties trade to politics

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, July 24: Pakistan has linked the grant of most-favoured nation (MFN) status to India with the resolution of all political disputes.

 Any progress in trade and the grant of MFN status to India will remain linked with the resolution of political disputes, commerce minister Humayun Akhtar told a news conference in Islamabad.

 On South Asian Free Trade Area, he said it would become operational with effect from January 2006, as agreed.

 Indo-Pak trade has gradually picked up during the last fiscal to about $400 million, but lack of trust persists even after a series of confidence-building measures. 

 An example of the deep gulf is Delhis reluctance to allow export of eatables through the land route of Wagah to food-short Pakistan.

 India had asked Pakistan to submit a written request to permit trade through cargo trucks at Wagah. A formal proposal on cross-border movement of truckers was made, but Delhi has yet to grant permission, officials in the commerce ministry said.

 India is demanding transit facility for trade with Pakistan and Central Asia as well as MFN status from Pakistan.

 Pakistan allowed food imports from India after rampant inflation led to a surge in prices of items of daily use.

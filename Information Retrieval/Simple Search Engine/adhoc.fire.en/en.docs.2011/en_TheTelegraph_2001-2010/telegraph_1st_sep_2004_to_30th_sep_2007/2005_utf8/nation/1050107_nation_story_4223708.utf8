 Court convicts student rapists 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: A Delhi court has convicted two men who led the gangrape of a Maulana Azad Medical College student at a monument on the busy Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg here two years ago.

 Additional sessions judge Chander Shekhar held Rahul and Amit guilty of the offence and fixed January 17 to hear arguments on the quantum of punishment to be awarded.

 In November 2002, the fourth-year student was accosted outside her college, taken at knifepoint to Khooni Darwaza, a stone?s throw away, and raped. 

 Her cries for help were drowned in the morning rush-hour drone of thousands of vehicles.

 The monument, situated opposite the college main gate, is hardly a kilometre from the police headquarters and Delhi?s Fleet Street. 

 The incident had raised the hackles of parliamentarians and citizens alike, and brought into focus the insecurity of women in Delhi, especially in and around college campuses.

 Then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani had called for a consensus among lawmakers for death penalty to rapists. There has been none; woman activists have instead sought higher conviction rates.

 Indian police register a rape case every hour but nearly 75 per cent of men tried for the crime go scot-free. The Indian Penal Code stipulates rigorous imprisonment for 10 years? minimum, and a maximum of a life term.

 Two minors, aged 13 and 14, who had joined Rahul and Amit, had pleaded guilty before the Juvenile Justice Board and were sent to an observation home in September 2003. They will stay there till they are adults.

 Rahul and Amit had sought similar treatment as they contended that they, too, were minors and produced school records to back the claim.

 Delhi police, however, filed a chargesheet against the duo in January 2003 after ossification tests declared them to be ?major?.

 According to the police, Rahul was then 20 and had committed two burglaries, and Amit 19. After the rape, they had robbed the victim of her purse containing Rs 100 and a mobile phone.

 Rahul was arrested within a week on the leads provided by the girl, who said that one of the rapists bore a tattoo ?Rahul? on his forearm.

 The conviction comes as a shot in the arm for Delhi police, which has been at the receiving end for its failure to prevent crime.

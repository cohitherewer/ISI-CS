 Joshi blows syllabus bugle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 5: Battlelines have been drawn over the national school curriculum framework that the Central Advisory Board of Education is expected to approve on Tuesday.

 Former Union human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi has threatened an agitation at the meeting of the board to protest the framing of a curriculum that hurts the religious sentiments of the people.

 The BJP leader accused successor Arjun Singh, whom the common minimum programme of the ruling coalition at the Centre mandates to detoxify the education system, of being a tool in a communist-sponsored vendetta.

 Joshi charged the ministry, at a news conference on Friday, with breaking all norms of decency in its campaign to denigrate the former director of the National Council for Education, Research and Training, J.S. Rajput. A report by IAS officer S. Satyam that was recently made public by the ministry has listed 201 charges against Rajput.

 Five years ago, the Left and the Congress had criticised Joshi and Rajput after they put together new textbooks in place of ones written by Left-wing historians like Romila Thapar, Satish Chandra and Arjun Dev. 

 A section of academicians had sought a stay on the textbooks on the ground that they were biased. However, the court had rejected their plea.

 Rajput has been in the line of fire since Singh took charge. The ministry even recommended to Unesco that it suspend an award conferred on Rajput for his achievements as NCERT director.

 It is obvious that Arjun Singh is acting as a tool in a communist vendetta, Joshi said at the news conference. He described Rajput as an able administrator and a visionary educationist and lashed out at Singh for doing away with the school curriculum prepared under him.

 Joshi has already mobilised the education ministers of the five BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to ensure that the education advisory board is not allowed to approve the new curriculum without protest. The BJP is also trying to rope in the education minister of Orissa, which is ruled by the partys ally, the Biju Janata Dal. 

 Rajasthan education minister Ghanshyam Tewari, who was one of the most vocal voices of opposition last year, is expected to play the same role this year and is likely to be supported by Anandibehn Patel of Gujarat.

 On taking charge, Singh had said a new school curriculum is due as the last one was prepared in 2000. NCERT has to, according to rules, review and update the curriculum every five years.

 For the BJP, it is important to be perceived to be playing the role of an active Opposition though it is not in a position to stall the adoption of the new curriculum as Singh has majority support.

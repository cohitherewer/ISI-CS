 Human bomb in Andhra

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Oct. 13: A suicide bomber carrying a backpack triggered a blast at the special task force (STF) complex here late last night that killed a sentry, police said today.

 The attackers limbs and severed head were found near the STF office, the police added. A second bomber escaped.

 Two men with backpacks had arrived at the building, next door to the headquarters of the anti-Naxalite battalion, Greyhounds. While one stopped to speak to a sentry near the gate, the second went a little further. While the second person triggered the explosive, the first ? who realised they were in the wrong building ? fled the scene, police sources said.

 A policeman was injured in the blast and is now in Nizams Hospital.

 The stranger who walked into the STF office on Wednesday evening with a backpack was a human bomb belonging to a yet-unidentified Islamic terrorist group, said Hyderabad police commissioner A.K. Mohanty.

 The attack occurred within 100 metres of the official residence of chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy. 

 Mohanty said the investigators found a suicide note with the unidentified attacker. Causing panic and communal tension during Ramazan and Dussehra appeared to be the motive, he added.

 Shame of a subedar father 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dehradun, Aug. 1: For former army subedar Shankar Singh Negi, the first shock was learning about the death of his rifleman son. The second was the news that he was alive.

 Suraj Singh Negi, 32, was declared dead at Dehraduns IMA in December, 2003, after a charred body was found in his barracks.

 He was arrested in Bathinda on July 7 after enquiring about defence installations.

 Police believe he killed a deranged washerman, Kalua, dressed the body up in his clothes, badge, belt and boots, placed it in his barracks and set fire to it.

 I dont know why fate is being so cruel, Shankar Singh sobbed at his small house in Willowala village, Bharuwala, about 40 km from Dehradun. I wish I had died the day we were told Suraj was dead.

 He added softly after a pause: We were just beginning to get over his death?. 

 He has, however, been to Bathinda to meet his son.

 After faking his death, Suraj, a father of three, had fled Dehradun with his mistress, Evelyn Yadav alias Renu.

 His wife Sangeeta and Shankar Singh knew about the affair, a police officer said. 

 They tried to stop them but failed. Shankar Singh even ensured that Suraj was denied city leave (to meet Renu) while on duty at the IMA.

 The family had received the service benefits following Surajs death. They will have to return the money.

 Please go away, Sangeeta said. I have nothing to say.

 She shouted at her father-in-law: Inko kahen chale jaayen, hamein apne haal mein chhod de, bachhon ka to khyal karen (Tell him to go away and leave us alone. At least, think of the children).

 Please go, Shankar Singh begged. He had said all he could. Excerpts:

 Q: How did you react when you learnt Suraj was alive?

 A: With disbelief. The news was not only shocking but shameful, too. I must have done something (bad) in my earlier birth to deserve this.

 Q: What did you go through when you were told your son was dead?

 A: Vishwaas nahin hua (I could not believe it). We went there and saw the burnt barracks. I identified Suraj by his boots and toes.

 Q: You identified your son without seeking details?

 A: Arre bhai, karte kya? Sab keh rahe the Suraj mar gaya. Pehle kaha ke suicide kiya. Jab maine kaha ke woh aisa nahin kar sakta hai to pata chala ke wahan short-circuit ho gaya tha (What else could I have done? Everybody said Suraj is dead. First they said it was suicide. When I insisted that he wasnt the sort to kill himself, they claimed there had been a short-circuit).

 Q: When you met Suraj in Bathinda jail, what did he say to you?

 A: He did not admit to killing anyone. He told me he had fled after hearing people shout, Suraj mar gaya (Suraj is dead)! The police have told me he wanted to leave the army.

 Q) What do you think will happen to Suraj now?

 A) If he has killed someone he will suffer. He should be punished. We are suffering for him. I cannot say any more. 

 Was he spying for some foreign country? I dont know. We are ruined?.

 Return to sweet sixteen

 Srinagar, April 7: Drums and tears rolled as the 30 passengers from Muzaffarabad set foot in Srinagar tonight, reports our correspondent.

 When the buses stopped at the main entrance to the Centaur Lake View Hotel, the state police band played a welcome tune. One after the other, the visitors alighted into the waiting arms of weeping relatives.

 ?I have no words to express my joy. I just don?t believe that finally after so many years, I have come back to my roots,? said Zamrooda Sharief, 70, who crossed the peace bridge on a wheelchair. Zamrooda repeatedly hugged her nephew Zaffar Qureshi, an advocate based in Srinagar. ?I was just 16 when I went to Muzaffarabad after my marriage,? she said. 

 As soon as they arrived, the guests were offered Kashmiri kehwa (tea) and later treated to a cultural programme. Their stay has been arranged by the state government at the International Conference Centre on the banks of Dal Lake.

 As a token of gratitude, the government sent flowers in a fleet of boats to the Hazratbal shrine.

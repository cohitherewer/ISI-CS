 Information bill gets LS nod

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today urged the bureaucracy to look at the right to information bill in a positive light as it aimed at eliminating corruption at all levels of governance.

 I would only like to see that everyone, particularly our civil servants, should see the bill in a positive spirit, not as a draconian law for paralysing government, but as an instrument for improving government-citizen interface, he said before the Lok Sabha adopted the bill by voice vote.

 As many as 150 amendments were accommodated in the draft bill that was introduced in the last session of Parliament and then examined by a parliamentary standing committee. 

 The bill is expected to be carried through in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow. 

 Singhs appeal to civil servants came in the backdrop of reservations that the right to seek information from the government should not be an enforceable one.

 The bill provides for accessing information in a simple, easy and time-bound manner and envisages stringent penalties for failing to provide information or affecting information flow in any way.

 Emphasising that the bill imposed an obligation on agencies to disclose information suo motu, the Prime Minister said erring officials would be subjected to departmental proceedings. However, a penalty clause in the draft bill that envisaged imprisonment was omitted by an amendment.

 The bill entitles citizens to seek information from the Union and state governments, panchayati raj institutions, local bodies and recipients of government grants. Singh said the access to information would be extensive with minimum exemptions.

 Even the exemptions could be questioned on the basis of a public benefit test, he said. Such a test would check whether the benefit of releasing information outweighs the harm caused by disclosure.

 Singh said exemptions could be made in cases where releasing information would entail a breach of privilege of Parliament or legislature. Security and intelligence agencies were exempt unless the information sought involved corruption allegations or human rights violations, he said.

 To enforce the right, the bill envisages setting up an independent appeal mechanism at the central and state levels, headed by information commissioners. This would give teeth to the right, making the right a potent instrument for good, effective and transparent governance, the Prime Minister said.

 He hoped the legislation would help convert huge budgetary outlays into outcomes for the benefit of the aam aadmi.

 Singh also expressed gratitude to the Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council which took the initiative to draft the legislation as promised in the common minimum programme.

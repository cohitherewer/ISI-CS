 Arjun keeps law cards close to chest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Centre will consider passing a law to get around the Supreme Court verdict allowing unaided private colleges to scrap seat reservations, the human resource development minister assured Parliament today.

 Lok Sabha members had cut across party lines to demand legislation to neutralise the apex court judgement, which said the Centre and states cannot enforce reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students in institutions that receive no government aid.

 But a cautious Arjun Singh would not reveal any details about the new legislation.

 Responding to a calling attention notice over the issue, Singh advised the members not to react in anger or haste. He agreed with them that the judgment had affected the reservation scheme.

 But it is important that we try and understand the implications of the judgment and evolve a national approach to this important issue, the minister said. This approach must address national, social and constitutional imperatives in a holistic manner.

 The minister said he would convene a meeting of state higher and technical education ministers in New Delhi on August 27 to discuss the matter and work out a consensus. He accepted Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumars suggestion to call an all-party meeting, too.

 But Singh rejected a members proposal that the Centre immediately issue an ordinance to undo the effects of the court order.

 As the honourable court has said, the judgment does not come into force until the next academic year, the minister said. So we have time to deliberate and decide. Well before the commencement of the next academic year, we will come to a clear position so as to strengthen the principles of social justice.

 The brief discussion witnessed an intervention from the Deputy Speaker. Charanjit Singh Atwal made a strong plea to the minister to protect reservation in education because that alone can make job reservations purposeful.

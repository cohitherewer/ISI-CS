 Too few MPs hold up House

 New Delhi, May 6: Waste of time and public money. Disruption of the parliamentary system. 

 These were some of the charges the Congress had hurled at the Opposition for stalling the Houses in March and boycotting them in April-May.

 But the NDA members arent the only ones avoiding Parliament House or causing adjournments.

 Four days after Sonia Gandhi hauled up her partys Rajya Sabha members and cracked the whip against absenteeism in the House, asking them to attend at least one of the two sessions every day, the Lok Sabha was adjourned twice today for lack of quorum (a minimum number of MPs).

 Sonias sermon had followed the ?embarrassment? of the Lok Sabha being adjourned for poor attendance on April 29 ? during the NDA boycott ? while the finance bill was being taken up. The discussion had to be delayed by half an hour. The Rajya Sabha benches, too, were going almost empty around the same time.

 After Sonias summons on May 2, the Upper House witnessed near full benches for a couple of days. It was being speculated that the Lok Sabha MPs were in for a similar lecture next.

 They did enough to ensure one today. When the House met at 2.15 pm after the lunch-break, the Congress could count only 27 members. None of its younger leaders, who had rued the lack of opportunity to learn from debates when the NDA stalled the House in March, were present except for Sandeep Dikshit, son of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

 There were only eight from the CPM, three each from the CPI and the DMK, two from the Samajwadi Party and one each from the Telugu Desam Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, making 45 in all when the quorum required 10 per cent of the total strength of the House to be present. 

 The chair adjourned the House for 30 minutes and reassembled at 2.45 after some members hanging around the central hall and the lobby rushed in on hearing the quorum bell. 

 Minister of state for health S. Jagadesan made a statement and finance minister P. Chidambaram spoke on the money laundering (amendment) bill.

 Around 3 pm, Sachin Pilot walked in, followed a while later by Jitin Prasada. 

 But more ? or less ? was in store. After the bill was passed, the House took up private members business at 3.30 pm. By the time a resolution on the agrarian sector was being debated, the strength had fallen again with some MPs having walked out.

 Rashtriya Janata Dal member Ram Kripal Yadav and Samajwadi Partys Shailendra Kumar raised the issue of quorum at 4.15 pm and the House was adjourned till 4.45. By 4.50, some members were ushered in and the proceedings resumed.

 Now, the RJD and Samajwadi Party members walked out. Some women MPs alleged they had raised the quorum issue to get the House adjourned, for they did not want a discussion on the 33 per cent quota for women in state and central legislatures.

 When the BJP disrupted Parliament for three consecutive days in March, the Congress had unleashed its babalog. Amid extensive media coverage, Rahul Gandhi had led a dharna by its younger MPs by the side of the Gandhi statue in front of Parliament House.

 Bengal job freeze melts 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: With elections round the corner, the Bengal government has announced a thaw in a five-year freeze on recruitment.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the government was planning to make fresh recruitment in the districts, especially at the block level.

 There was a freeze on employee recruitment earlier, but now we will start recruiting on a priority basis. I cant promise a slew of jobs, but well be hiring people to strengthen block offices as well as for vacant posts in schools and colleges, the chief minister said at Writers Buildings.

 He, however, did not mention the number of vacant posts that would be filled.

 Senior government officials were completely in the dark about the chief ministers promise.

 There has been no circular. Neither has this been discussed in any meeting in recent times, said an official of the personnel and administrative reforms department. At least 80,000 posts at various levels are estimated to be lying vacant in the state now.

 Recruitment was first frozen in Bengal during Jyoti Basus regime in 1991 when most states were facing an economic crisis. The economy circular detailing the curtailments was renewed in 2000, 2002 and 2003.

 The order, however, applies only to non-Public Service Commission (PSC) posts ? jobs in the districts where recruitment is made through the employment exchange.

 As far as we know, the economy circular has not been lifted and it continues to remain in force. At the moment, recruitment is only made on a priority basis. That too, only after the approval of the cabinet committee on appointments, which is chaired by the chief minister himself. The government is yet to start hiring even in the cases where employees have died in harness, said the official.

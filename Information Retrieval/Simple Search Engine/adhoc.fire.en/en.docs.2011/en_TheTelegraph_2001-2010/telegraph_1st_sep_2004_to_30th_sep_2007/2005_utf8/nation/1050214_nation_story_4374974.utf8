 Jammu, Feb. 13: Bhushan Kumar, director of music giant T-Series, today tied the knot with actor Divya Khosla at the Ram temple close to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine near Katra here this evening.

 The actor, who made her debut in Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Sathiyo in 2004, would no longer appear in films, said family sources. The two were engaged on December 13 last year. 

 The choice of the unconventional venue for a glamour wedding is not surprising given the fact that Bhushan?s father Gulshan Kumar, the T-Series founder murdered in Mumbai, was a regular at the renowned hill shrine and minted money selling cassettes of devotional songs dedicated to Mata Vaishno Devi. 

 Pandit Laxman Das Shastri, specially flown in from Delhi, solemnised the marriage conducted according to Vedic rituals between 5 and 8 pm amid 30 close relatives and friends of the family. 

 Katra town, usually a base camp for pilgrims, is abuzz as all the amenities for the occasion are being sourced from there. 

 Dozens of ponies have been plying the track to the Ram temple with flowers and food. 

 Sources said invitees were served a typical preeti bhoj.

 The wedding was the first in the temple and the lagan mandap put up for the occasion could become permanent, said sources in Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board. 

 ?We have had plans for a kalyan mandap on the lines of other temples such as Tirupathi. But due to space constraints around the holy caves, we have not been able to progress further,? a source said.

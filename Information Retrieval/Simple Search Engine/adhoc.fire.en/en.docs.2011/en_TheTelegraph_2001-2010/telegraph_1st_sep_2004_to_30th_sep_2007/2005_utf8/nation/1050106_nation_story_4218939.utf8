 New Delhi, Jan. 5: Parliament?s budget session is likely to start on February 25 with the presidential address to a joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, followed by the presentation of the railway and general budgets on February 26 and 28.

 The tentative schedule was drawn up at a meeting of the cabinet committee on parliamentary affairs attended by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister Shivraj Patil, finance minister P. Chidambaram, and steel, chemicals and fertilisers minister Ram Vilas Paswan.

 The session will begin two days after the Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana Assembly elections conclude, enabling the Centre to make announcements without inviting Election Commission strictures for violation of the model code.

 The dates will be finalised at a meeting of the Union cabinet, ministry sources said.

 Threat of two hot frontiers recedes

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, April 11: India?s strategic vision of military conflict is set for a dramatic correction with the signing of a pact with China today that will institutionalise confidence-building measures along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

 The implementation of confidence-building measures (CBMs) between the militaries of India and China ? as agreed upon in the protocol signed today ? will mean that India?s threat perception in the borders to the east and the north will be lowered considerably.

 The protocol ? on ?modalities for implementation of confidence-building measures in the military field?? will pave the way for India to focus on a conflict scenario on a single front only. 

 India?s military and strategic planners have always been bedevilled by the nightmare scenario of conflict erupting on two fronts ? with Pakistan and China ? simultaneously.

 Since India and China signed the agreement on peace and tranquillity and initiated confidence-building measures in 1996, the actual measures on the ground have been tentative.

 Even during Operation Parakram ? the full-scale mobilisation of the Indian military in 2002 ? army headquarters was looking over its shoulder to ensure that the deployment of troops along the border with Pakistan did not leave a yawning gap on the Chinese frontier.

 But the agreement signed today binds New Delhi and Beijing to sustained peacemaking measures along their disputed frontiers. It is a graduation from the 1996 agreement, army sources said.

 ?The 1996 agreement provided the institutional framework. Today?s agreement will ensure that the decision is followed through and the CBMs are actually implemented,? army sources said.

 Under the protocol signed today, each side will inform the other well in advance before holding a major military exercise (involving more than 15,000 troops) and will ensure that the manoeuvres will be directed away from positions held in frontline deployments. 

 The 1996 agreement had laid down that each side will inform the other within five days of completing an exercise. 

 The protocol signed today lays down that each side will inform the other at least 15 days in advance of the type of manoeuvres, level and duration. 

 The 1996 pact had not limited the time in which one country could ask the other for clarifications. The latest protocol binds the two sides to the time limit of 15 days.

 The protocol also restricts the movement of combat aircraft within 10 km of the Line of Actual Control but sorties closer to the LAC may be flown with prior information. 

 The protocol says in the event of intrusion by aircraft, the two sides will hold a flag meeting within 48 hours to clarify the position. Investigation into such an event has to be completed in a month and the result will have to be communicated through a flag meeting.

 New Delhi and Beijing have also agreed that if troops come face to face because of disputes along the LAC, they will refrain from using force, return to base and inform headquarters. No side will put up landmarks on the spot of such a dispute.

 The protocol says two new points along the border will be opened for meetings between the troops in addition to three existing spots.

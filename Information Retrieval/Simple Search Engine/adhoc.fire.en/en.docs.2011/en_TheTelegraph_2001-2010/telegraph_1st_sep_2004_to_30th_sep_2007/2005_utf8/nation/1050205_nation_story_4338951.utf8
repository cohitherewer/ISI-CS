 Court call after loudspeaker use

 K.C. PHILIP AND PTI

 Patna, Feb. 4: Taking serious exception to the use of loudspeakers in a mosque adjacent to it, Patna High Court today ordered the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police to ensure that these equipment did not interrupt court proceedings.

 Justice R.S. Garg, who was annoyed over the alleged use of a loudspeaker when he was in the middle of a hearing this afternoon, summoned district magistrate Sudhir Kumar and senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan and pulled them up for having failed to ensure the compliance of its earlier directive in this regard.

 He also directed the two senior district officials, apart from members of the managing committee of the mosque, its muazzin and the officer-in-charge of Kothwali police station, to appear before the court on February 28.

 Tension ran high on Bailey Road opposite Kothwali police station and the high court after hundreds of people assembled there to protest the alleged arrest of a muazzin, who delivers the azaan at the mosque.

 According to police, they had brought Muhammad Alimuddin Saheb to the Kothwali station after the high court had objected to the alleged use of loudspeakers at the mosque during azaan. The court had taken suo motu notice of the ?offence? and asked the police to take action, they claimed.

 As rumour spread that Saheb had been ?arrested?, a mob gathered in front of the police station and blocked traffic on all four sides a little after noon. A commotion ensued, which led to tension in the area. 

 Later in the evening, the police allowed Saheb to leave after he signed a bond. They also prepared a prosecution report for alleged violation of the court?s order. 

 Justice Garg, who later said he did not ask the police to arrest anyone, has written to the Supreme Court seeking his transfer.

 A person attached to the mosque said, ?No one can interfere with our religious practices, which we have been following for ages. Even the court has no business in the religious affairs,? said the Imam of Kothwali mosque, Salaam Mustafa.

 Mosque authorities, however, claimed that they removed the loudspeakers after the order was issued three months ago. ?Ever since, we have been using a sound box put up on the floor on Fridays due to the gathering of a large number of people for prayers. We had the Friday prayers today also and I don?t understand how it disturbed the court,? said a person at the mosque.

 Advocate Muhammad Ali Farukh, who tried to explain the situation, said: ?The call for prayer five times a day cannot be stopped. But we have taken care of the court order by using sound boxes instead of loudspeakers, which serves our purpose too.? 

 In the evening, some people rushed to the mosque and gave the call for prayer using loudspeakers.

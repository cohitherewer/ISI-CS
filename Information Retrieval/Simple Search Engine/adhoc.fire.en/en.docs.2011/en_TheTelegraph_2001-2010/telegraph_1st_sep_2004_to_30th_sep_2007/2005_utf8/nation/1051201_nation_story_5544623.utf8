 IIT student found dead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 30: A second-year mechanical engineering student of IIT Kanpur was found dead on campus this morning, an hour after he called his family in Nagpur.

 Authorities said S. Chandrakant Dharskar, 20, died after falling from the terrace of the hostel adjacent to the faculty building, near which his body was found at 7.30 am. The post-mortem report is awaited.

 IIT-K director S.G. Dhande, who returned from Delhi today, said: It is a sad and unfortunate incident. We dont know what led to the fall and his death. He was a bright student.

 As students and teachers speculated if it was an accident, a suicide or a murder, a mechanical engineering student said: This is exam time and he might have done badly in a paper. This might have caused depression.

 But Ravi Shankar, an IIT-K spokesman, said: We dont know if he was depressed. A scan of his cellphone revealed that apart from calling his family in the morning, Dharskar had called some friends late last night, he added.

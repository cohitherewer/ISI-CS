 Tsunami atlas

 Kharagpur, July 19: The Indian Institute of Technology here today launched its Centre of Excellence for Oceans, Rivers, Atmosphere and Land (Coral) Sciences that is developing a tsunami warning system for coastal cities around the Indian Ocean, reports our correspondent.

 The development of a travel time atlas for the tsunami warning system is now in progress, said S.K. Dubey, the IIT Kharagpur director.

 Coral, he added, aims at bringing several new research areas related to natural hazards under one umbrella. 

 Over the past two days, scientists of the IIT and experts like Avijit Gangopadhyay of the University of Massachusetts, Ramesh Natarajan of IBM and tsunami expert from Canada Tad Murty were engaged in shaping up Coral.

 Explaining the importance of the travel time atlas, Murty said in case of a tsunami, Coral would be able to issue warnings about when the waves will strike where. During the tsunami in December, it took several hours to reach places like Chennai and Somalia. If we know where the tsunami was generated, we can refer to the travel time atlas and calculate the time it will take to strike other places in about 250 coastal areas across 40 countries around the Indian Ocean. On getting the warning, the local administration can plan its steps and evacuation. 

 Dubey said a major focus of Corals activity will be mitigation of post-hazard effects.

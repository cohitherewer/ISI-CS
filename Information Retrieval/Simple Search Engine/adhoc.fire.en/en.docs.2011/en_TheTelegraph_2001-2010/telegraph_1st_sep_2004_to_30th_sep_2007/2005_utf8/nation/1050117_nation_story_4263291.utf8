 Gridco in rate hike bid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: Grid Corporation Of Orissa (Gridco) has proposed a hike in bulk supply tariff (BST) by almost 60 per cent.

 If approved by the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC), the tariff would increase from Rs 1.30 per unit to Rs 1.70 per unit. OERC will take up the matter tomorrow.

 Gridco sources said the hike would cover past liabilities to the tune of Rs 3,500 crore. The corporation has securitised Rs 1,100 crore worth of dues payable to the National Thermal Power Corporation and is in the process of swapping high-cost loans with low-cost ones.

 The corporation has submitted before OERC that its annual revenue requirement for power purchase will be Rs 1,900 crore while the transmission and establishment cost, including salary, will be Rs 360 crore.

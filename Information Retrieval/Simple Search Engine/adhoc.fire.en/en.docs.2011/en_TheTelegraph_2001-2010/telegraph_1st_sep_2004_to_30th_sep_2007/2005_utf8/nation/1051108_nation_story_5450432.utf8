 No portfolio? Never mind

 RASHEED KIDWAI 

 Nov. 7: When P. Chidambaram walked into human resource development minister Arjun Singhs office at 5.45 pm to attend a group of ministers meeting on sports, he was surprised to see Natwar Singh. 

 The finance minister smiled broadly looking directly at Natwar who had already been reduced to the status of minister without portfolio. 

 By 5 pm, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had told him he was being stripped of the external affairs ministry, but Natwar acted as if it was business as usual. 

 The diplomat appeared to have forgotten that he was part of the cabinet sub-committee on sports by virtue of his previous job as external affairs minister. 

 Sources said they were surprised by Natwars decision to stay on in the government. 

 When Natwar was told he had to leave external affairs, a section of the Congress was convinced he would rather quit than accept the embarrassing position of a minister without portfolio.

 While Natwars proximity to 10 Janpath is known, sources said Congress president Sonia Gandhi left the decision to stay on or quit the cabinet entirely to him. Sonia was with Natwar to the extent of clearing the partys name and protecting him from the charge of corruption in the Iraqi oil-for-food programme. 

 Chidambaram played a key role in working out the formula of minister without portfolio between an adamant Natwar and an assertive Prime Minister who had kept Sonia briefed at every stage.

 Congress leaders were also surprised at Natwars bid to involve the Left parties in what was essentially a party matter. His frequent interactions with the media, aggressive sound bites and, finally, bad-mouthing the US proved costly.

 Basu sounds Sangh alert

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: Jyoti Basu has emphasised that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has infiltrated the state apparatus, leaving a pernicious legacy, and has called upon the Congress to introspect seriously and live up to the expectations of the people.

 The Marxist veteran said the CPM recognises the Congress as a secular party and that its role has relevance in determining the secular character of the state. This concern, he said, led the CPM to support the United Progressive Alliance government.

 However, the Congress has to fulfil the peoples mandate, the former chief minister of Bengal asserted, adding that the CPM had extended support to the government at the Centre to meet the needs of the situation.

 Basu said his party would not give up its basic agenda. We shall always defend the interest of the people, especially those who are deprived most. We make our assessments independently and decide the course of action, he wrote in the latest issue of Peoples Democracy on its 40th anniversary last week.

 We want the Congress to introspect with due seriousness. Can it continue with the same economic politics of indiscriminate liberalisation and privatisation? Will there then be any difference between its policies and those of the BJP?

 The CPM leader did not directly refer to the Congress-Left spat over the proposed offloading of 10 per cent of Bhel shares but said the public sector enterprises in strategic and key sectors need to be strengthened.

 The veteran leader said the CPM is not yet in a position to implement alternative policies all over the country. That requires a qualitative increase in the strength of the party, its Left and democratic allies, he said.

 Liberalisation has benefited only 10 per cent of the people and development should be founded on concern for the masses who have not received the benefits of growth, Basu said. Foreign direct investment should be based on national priorities and the principle of mutual interest, he said.

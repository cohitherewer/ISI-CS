 Mani spins gold-rush dream with flourish

 K.P. NAYAR

 Aiyar: Shining drive

 Calgary, Feb. 5: India is shining in Calgary with petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar predicting here yesterday that his current global effort in oil diplomacy will turn into the ?gold rush? of the 21st century.

 ?India is now California 1848,? Aiyar told nearly 100 decision-makers in the energy sector in this city, which sits on all of Canada?s bitumen and synthetic crude oil output, 81 per cent of this country?s natural gas production and 66 per cent of its conventional oil production.

 India is shining here because Aiyar?s drive, close on the heels of a visit to New Delhi by Canada?s new Prime Minister Paul Martin, has brought to this country an image of India that people here are unfamiliar with.

 This new image will draw tens of Canadian oil executives to a hotel facility here from Monday.

 At this facility, electronic work stations have been set up for these executives to access on-line data about investing in India?s hydrocarbon sector, in which 82 per cent of potential deep-water energy sources are yet to be explored.

 Canadian and US companies have been hobnobbing with India?s energy sector. But in the past, they have been put off by the dour-faced babus of the petroleum ministry in New Delhi who have, for instance, carried to investment promotion meetings tons of hard data, often photocopied in poor quality government stationery, at a time when even countries like Vietnam and Equatorial Guinea are offering their information online.

 To attract fresh investment, Aiyar has done away with some of the Soviet-style practices of the petroleum ministry, which were picked up at a time when India?s state-run oil sector had close ties with Moscow.

 Aiyar told investors here ? and earlier this week in Houston ? that the insistence on a bank guarantee for companies participating for exploration bids in India have been relaxed.

 Had it not been an issue of self-esteem, he told investors here, ?I would simply go down on my knees and say, ?please, please come to India?.?

 What has impressed the oil majors in north America is also the minister?s repeated assurances of transparency. 

 His ministry and its state-run appendages have been notorious in the past for corruption in almost every deal, from the allotment of petrol pumps and gas agencies to drilling contracts and oil imports.

 Yesterday, Aiyar, with typical flourish, told investors here that contracts under the ministry?s new exploration licensing policy will be signed on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti, as a tribute to the Father of the Nation, for whom commitment to truth was a fundamental article of faith.

 In Houston, one potential investor insisted on seeing 140 production-sharing contracts that the ministry had signed with foreign companies, and S.C. Tripathi, the petroleum secretary, broke precedent and agreed to show them all.

 Also for the first time in the history of contracting by the Indian government, Aiyar has announced that weightages for all bid evaluation criteria, including those for sub-criteria, under the New Exploration Licensing Policy are being made public to ensure transparency.

 A firm time table on bidding right upto a deadline for signing contracts is new for many foreign investors who have attempted dealing with Indian government agencies.

 Aiyar added a sweetener to that by cutting the time table by a further two months on the eve of his global roadshow for the current, fifth round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP).

 Air force politics disclaimer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: A multi-billion-dollar acquisition of 126 multi-role combat aircraft for the Indian Air Force will be based on military requirements and will not be made under political compulsion, Air Chief Marshal Shashi P. Tyagi said here today.

 Five companies are in contention for the IAFs order, estimated at over Rs 15,000 crore.

 But though the acquisition is still a long way off ? with the requests for proposals to be sent only by December this year ? a high-profile campaign has been mounted by the US for the F-16 (produced by Lockheed Martin) and the F/A-18 Superhornet (Boeing) with the Pentagon holding a succession of briefings on the aircraft for Indian officials.

 Indias decision also to place orders for civilian aircraft with Airbus (France) and the Scorpene submarines (also France) has raised the possibility that New Delhi will now want to appear even-handed in big-ticket purchases and spread orders between the US, France and Russia.

 But Tyagi said the procedure to acquire the aircraft will be transparent. 

 Apart from Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the other aircraft in contention are the Grippen (Saab of Sweden), MiG 29m/M2 (Russia) and the Mirage 2000-V (Dassault Aviation, France).

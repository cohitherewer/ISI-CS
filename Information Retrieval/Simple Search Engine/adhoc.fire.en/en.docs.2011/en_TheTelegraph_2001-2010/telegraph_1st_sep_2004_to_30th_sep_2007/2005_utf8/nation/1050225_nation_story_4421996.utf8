 Abuse, and get axed

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Supreme Court has held that an employee could be dismissed from service by the management for using ?filthy? language against superiors.

 A bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, Tarun Chatterjee and P.K. Balasubramanyan ? in a judgment delivered on Tuesday ? said the dismissal of a Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd employee was not disproportionate to the ?misconduct?.

 The bench quashed the order of reinstatement of the employee passed by the labour court and the high court. The lower courts had held that the dismissal was disproportionate to the misconduct ? use of abusive language by the employee against his supervisor ? and ordered punishments like a reduction in increment and backwages.

 The same day, a Supreme Court bench of Justices Hegde and S.B. Sinha had ruled that workers who beat up their bosses can be sacked, thus upholding the dismissal of two workmen of the Dhanbad-based BCCL for assaulting senior officers in 1983.

 The workmen?s gratuity could also be ?forfeited in its entirety?, said the judges who had earlier upheld the dismissal of a workman caught sleeping during office hours.

 In the case involving use of abusive language against a superior, N.B. Narawade, a fitter with Mahindra and Mahindra, was dismissed after an inquiry found him guilty. 

 The labour court and the high court held that the workman had used abusive language against his supervisor but dismissal was ?harsh, improper? and ?disproportionate?.

 The company filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, which held: ?Use of abusive language against a superior officer in the presence of his subordinates cannot be termed to be an indiscipline calling for lesser punishment.?

 Justice Hegde, writing the judgment for the bench, said: ?We, too, are of the opinion that the language used by the workman is such that it cannot be tolerated by any civilised society.? 

 The judges said industrial tribunals could interfere with the quantum of punishment awarded by managements but their ?discretion? to reduce punishment was ?certainly not unlimited? under the Industrial Disputes Act.

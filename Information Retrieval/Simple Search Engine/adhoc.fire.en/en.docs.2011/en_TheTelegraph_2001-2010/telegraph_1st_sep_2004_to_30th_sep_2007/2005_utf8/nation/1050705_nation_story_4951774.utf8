 Court summons Kohlis UK wife 

 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi court has issued 

 summons to the UK-settled wife of Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, 

 the prime accused in the rape and murder of British teenager 

 Hannah Foster, a month after she retracted her statements 

 implicating him.

 Accepting Kohlis plea that she was a crucial defence witness, the court issued summons to Shailender Kaur, who on June 4, told the court that she had made certain statements in 2004 implicating Kohli owing to coercion and atmosphere of fear created by British police.

 In an affidavit, she had accused the police of keeping her in an atmosphere of absolute fright and fear and said deposition was not authored by her. I was simply asked to affix my signature even without knowing its contents, she added.

 Kaur also denied her statement which gave the impression that Kohli was nervous after he returned home on the night of March 14, 2003 (the day of the murder) or was upset or even worried.

 Heat on defaulter firms

 New Delhi: Bank unions owing allegiance 

 to the Left on Monday demanded a law to bring to book defaulting 

 companies whose debts are often written off, reports our 

 special correspondent.

 Alleging that the corporate sector owes various banks around Rs 60,000 crore, the unions demanded that wilful default be made a criminal offence. 

 Secretary of the Delhi State Bank Employees Federation D.D. Rastogi alleged that Canara Bank had written off Rs 7 crore of ABCL, headed by Amitabh Bachchan. Big B did not become poor, the bank did, he said.

 Central trade unions meeting here on July 9 to discuss economic and industrial policies of the United Progressive Alliance government and Bhel disinvestment will also focus on bank defaulters and the governments indifference to the crime.

 The CPI-led All India Bank Employees Association 

 has released a list of defaulters across the country. According 

 to the employees federation: In Delhi alone, 

 the corporate sector owes a sum of Rs 13,500 crore.

 The federations general secretary, Ramanand, said the unions have been demanding more teeth to the Securitisation Act, 2002 by incorporating provisions that would make wilful default a criminal offence and allow banks to confiscate personal assets of defaulters and their relatives.

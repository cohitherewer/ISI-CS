The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Singh pads up for cricket diplomacy

 New Delhi/ Islamabad, March 10: If Bollywood binds, cricket connects.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today spoke of the twin bridges as he told Parliament of his decision to invite Pervez Musharraf for the cricket series between India and Pakistan.

 ?I must say that nothing brings the people of our subcontinent together than our love for cricket and Bollywood cinema,? he said.

 ?I am very happy to inform... that I have decided to invite President Musharraf to come to India and watch the cricket match between our two teams.?

 The invitation followed Musharraf?s comment last week to a Pakistani newspaper that he would like to see one of the India-Pakistan matches, if invited.

 ?I love watching any sport. I would love watching cricket. [But] I don?t believe in going without an invitation anywhere. If there is an invitation, one would certainly like to consider,? he had said.

 In Islamabad, the foreign ministry said India has formally invited Pervez Musharraf to one of the matches. ?The Indian government has formally conveyed the invitation through diplomatic channels,? spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani told The Telegraph.

 The announcement came hours after Singh told Parliament he had decided to invite Musharraf.

 Jilani did not disclose when the invitation was extended. He said it was conveyed through the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad. ?We are presently looking into the President?s schedule and the dates convenient for him to travel to India,? he added.

 Singh hoped Musharraf and his family would enjoy their stay in the country. While Musharraf?s mother, son and daughter are already reported to be in the country ? though incognito for security reasons ? it was not clear when the President would come and which of the matches he would like to see.

 In a lighter vein, he said cricket was so dear to the people of the two countries that he had to compete with cricketers for the nation?s attention. 

 ?I am equally conscious of the fact that today even as I speak in this august House, I am competing for the nation?s attention with young men like (Virender) Sehwag and (Asim) Kamal. Perhaps, that is how it should be,? Singh said as some members reminded him that while he spoke all eyes were on Sachin Tendulkar.

 The little master fell six runs short of what would have been a record 35th Test century.

 The Prime Minister, who was replying to the debate on the motion of thanks to the President?s address to the joint sitting of Parliament last month, said people from across the border should feel free to visit India whenever they wanted to. ?India is proud to be an open society and an open economy,? he said.

 ?Relations between nations are after all nothing more than relations between their peoples. I am sure time will work to heal our wounds and create an environment of shared prosperity and peace in the subcontinent in which we can all live and work for the greater good of our subcontinent.?

 Singh recalled last year?s revival series when cricket fans from India ? among them Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi ? had crossed over to watch the matches. Those who went returned with tales of warm hospitality, he said. Now, ?I am delighted to say that our people have returned the hospitality to thousands of visitors from Pakistan? who are watching the Mohali Test.

 In a dig at the Opposition, which had disrupted proceedings in both Houses last week, Singh said: ?How nice it would be if we conducted our affairs in this House with the same spirit of sportsmanship that our young cricketers exhibited on the playing field of the subcontinent.?

 Bargain clause to speed up trials

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: The provision of plea bargaining that is prevalent in several western countries is now part of Indian criminal law. 

 The Rajya Sabha today cleared the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2003, that makes significant changes in the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

 The plea bargaining provision has been introduced to speed up trials. It allows the prosecutor and the accused a pre-trial negotiation to settle the case. The rules say the court would examine the accused in-camera to determine if he has willingly opted for plea bargaining. The complainant would not be present at this time.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil told the upper House Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had suggested that if plea bargaining is not allowed by the judge, the applications and affidavits filed by the accused should not be allowed to be used against him.

 The legislation, which brought in other new clauses, met with opposition from many legal eagles in the House over one provision. This clause says a witness can be punished if his testimony to convict a person is proved wrong. 

 According to the amendment, if a person is sentenced to life imprisonment on the basis of a false statement, the witness, too, will get the same punishment.

 Patil said the Centre has accepted the recommendation of the standing committee to include the punitive clause but Rajya Sabha MP Ram Jethmalani argued that if a person is convicted, then how could he be termed innocent. 

 In reply, Patil said there have been instances when the judgments of trial courts convicting a person were altered by higher courts.

 Another change is regarding confessional statements made before a police officer. The bill makes it mandatory for the police to provide a copy of the statement free of cost to the person who made it.

 The statement will contain the date, time and place of recording of the confession and will be forwarded to the magistrate to take cognisance of the offence. It also gives statutory cover to a statement given before a magistrate.

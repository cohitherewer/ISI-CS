 Arms arrest

 Mumbai, May 30: The owner of a clearing house in Andheri was today arrested by the crime branch in connection with the arms haul at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust last week, reports our special correspondent.

 Madhu Kutty owns Sai Logistics, which had played a role in importing a consignment of all-purpose grease that contained the hidden cache of arms meant for the Chhota Rajan gang. Hidden inside one of the 27 barrels of grease, the cache contained 34 revolvers, three pistols, and 128 rounds of ammunition sent from Bangkok aboard the shipping vessel Mimitsa.

 Police had arrested Mukund Patel, who worked as a supervisor with Sai Logistics. The investigations showed that the consignment was sent by the Malaysia-based Rajans close aide Bharat Nepali.

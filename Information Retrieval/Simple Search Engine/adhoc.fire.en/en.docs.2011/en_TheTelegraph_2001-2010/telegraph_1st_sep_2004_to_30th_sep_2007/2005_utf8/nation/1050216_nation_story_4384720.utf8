 Patna, Feb. 15: The land of guns passed the election test with no casualties, although 14 people received minor injuries in group clashes at some places.

 Eighty-two seats went to polls in the second round of elections in Bihar today. Six persons were killed and 20 injured in the first round for 64 seats ? a good number of them in the Naxalite-affected regions ? on February 3. Polling for 93 seats is slated for February 23, three for February 18 and one for February 26.

 The Election Commission had expressed serious concern over violence and irregularities that marked the first phase of polling. It had to order a repoll in several booths. Today?s ?by and large peaceful? polling has boosted the confidence of election officials and the state administration alike. A preliminary average of 45 to 50 per cent of polling was reported today. 

 Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanian said 24 incidents of group clashes were reported from different parts of the state. In Munger town, CRPF jawans had to resort to firing to quell a stone-pelting mob. A few crude bombs were also exploded in the district but polling was not disrupted for long.

 ?Two CRPF jawans were injured in the Munger incident. Apart from this, in two booths of Begusarai, people prevented polling to protest against the conduct of the officer concerned. Three persons were arrested and substantive cases lodged against them for carrying illegal arms in Supaul. The number of preventive arrests was 63,? the chief secretary said.

 Subramanian said there were reports of electronic voting machines not functioning in some booths and added that the exact number of such polling stations would be available later. 

 Home secretary Girish Shankar said effective and largescale deployment of paramilitary and state police forces played a key role in ensuring peaceful elections.

 Electors in at least one booth of Darbhanga boycotted polling while complaints of voters? names missing from the lists also came in. There were unconfirmed reports of some administrative and police officials misusing their position in favour of a particular political party.

 Although most constituencies that went to polls today did not have a record of extremist violence, many seats were marked by the presence of history-sheeters, notorious figures and their wives.

 The stakes were high for the ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal in the second phase as many of its strongholds ? Darbhanga, Madhubani, Saharsa, Madhepura and Kishnaganj ? went to polls today.

 The districts that will go to polls on February 23 are West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan, Saran, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Sheohar, Sitamarhi (all in north Bihar), Nalanda and Patna (both in central Bihar).

 Detox drive takes in Gandhi 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 17: The Centre has withdrawn the revised edition of the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, released by the Vajpayee government in 2002, citing errors and politically motivated editing.

 The original Collected Works, published in 1994, will now be the official version, information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy said today. That version was compiled by a board with former Prime Minister Moraji Desai as its chairman.

 In October 1999, the National Democratic Alliance government had brought out a revised and abridged version of the 100-volume series and released a CD containing more than 5,000 pages from the Works in chronological order. But both the CD and the shortened Works were shot through with errors.

 Apart from certain deletions and omissions which were politically motivated, there were numerous errors, Reddy said. The revised version was shoddily produced and we received a large number of complaints from Gandhian scholars.

 The minister cited an example of the poor editing that peppers the version published by the Vajpayee government: Maulana Abul Kalam Azad has been treated as if he were two persons, referred to in one instance as the Maulana and in a second as Azad. 

 Certain references to Veer Savarkar were deleted and Indira Gandhis preface to one of the volumes was left out.

 Complaints poured in from home and abroad. The Gandhi Peace Foundation, Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, Prasthan Ashram, Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust, Servants of Peoples Society and several other organisations were aghast at the mistakes. Dr Thomas Webber of LA Trobe University, Australia, and Gene Sharp of the Albert Einstein Institution in the US also wrote to the government. 

 The information and broadcasting ministry formed a committee, headed by Narayan Desai, to look into the matter. The committee held meetings in Delhi and Ahmedabad and heard out a large number of Gandhian scholars.

 After receiving the committees report, the government decided to revert to the original Works as the official version. The CD will also be revised and will contain the entire matter from the original edition without any change, Reddy said.

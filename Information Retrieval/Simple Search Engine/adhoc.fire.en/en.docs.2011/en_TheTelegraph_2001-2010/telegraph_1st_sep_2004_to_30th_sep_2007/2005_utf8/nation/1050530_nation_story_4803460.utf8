 was leaked.

 The STF, acting on a tip-off, reached the examination centre in Aliganj area an hour after the exam began on Sunday and arrested Yogesh Mishra, a BSNL employee, and Sandeep Gupta, husband of another employee. 

 They were carrying copies of a question paper of the accounts division, called Section C ? General Rules and Financial Procedure and the answers, assistant superintendent of police, STF, Vijay Bhushan said.

 Hint of Chandrika visit

 Colombo (PTI): Sri Lankan President Chandrika 

 Kumaratunga is set to undertake a visit to India next week 

 ahead of entering into a controversial deal with the Tamil 

 Tigers on sharing tsunami aid. The visit had been put off 

 twice, although it was never officially announced.

 Kumaratunga is due to travel to New Delhi for talks with Indian leaders on Thursday, a newspaper here said. 

 The President also renewed a pledge to share foreign aid for Sri Lanka, where tsunamis struck late last year, with the Tamil rebels, a day after former US President Bill Clinton mounted pressure on Sri Lankan politicians to support Kumaratungas controversial move. Clinton was visiting Sri Lanka as the UNs special envoy for tsunami relief work.

 Kumaratunga is facing opposition to any deal with the Tamil Tigers from her coalition partner, the Marxist JVP, which has threatened to quit. 

 Kumaratunga was very committed to establishing the proposed joint administrative machinery, her office said in a statement after talks with Clinton on Saturday. The President said this was not a part of the peace process, but that she believed it would help move the stalled peace process forward.

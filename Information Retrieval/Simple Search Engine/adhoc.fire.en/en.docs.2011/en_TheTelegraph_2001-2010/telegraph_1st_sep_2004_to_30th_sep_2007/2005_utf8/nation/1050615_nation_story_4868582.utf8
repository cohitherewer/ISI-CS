 China flight on radar

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 Kunming (China)/Calcutta, June 14: Kunming is keen on starting direct flights to Bengal to boost Sino-Indian trade, local officials in the capital of Chinas Yunnan province said today.

 We have initiated talks with Bengal to start a direct flight to Kunming. We hope we can start the flight at an early date which is conducive for further strengthening of our bilateral ties, the vice-secretary-general of the Yunnan provincial government, Cui Zhitao, told a group of visiting journalists from South Asia.

 Cui also said Kunming has been recently connected by air with Dhaka.

 In Calcutta, Bengals commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said: We are keen on direct air connectivity with many places in the East?. Obviously we want direct links with China and it could be Beijing-Kunming-Calcutta?. We have placed our request before the central government for such direct links.

 Last year, a delegation from Yunnan was in the city, and the issue of direct connectivity was discussed as one of the steps required for closer links between China and Bengal. 

 Last week, a delegation from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) was in Kunming. Rajiv Kaul, a former CII president who led the 15-member team, said the issue of direct flight was discussed.

 Land-locked Yunnan is geographically close to Bengal and Indias Northeast and relations between the province and Indian entrepreneurs are starting to bloom, said Li Jiming, the deputy director-general of the department of commerce.

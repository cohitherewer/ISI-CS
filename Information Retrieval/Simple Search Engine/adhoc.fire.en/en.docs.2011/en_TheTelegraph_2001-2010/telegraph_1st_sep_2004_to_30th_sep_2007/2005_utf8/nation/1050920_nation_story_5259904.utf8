 Cong hits out at spy report

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Congress today accused the western media of carrying on with its Cold War days tendency of maligning Third World leaders even as the BJP demanded a probe into the revelations by former KGB agent Vasili Mitrokhin.

 The Congress termed The Times report last week regarding alleged KGB funding for the party and the CPI in the 1970s baseless, slanderous and absurd.

 Such reports, the Congress said, are nothing new. In the late seventies, similar allegations were made against important national leaders, said a six-paragraph statement issued today.

 The statement did not elaborate or name anyone when it spoke of similar allegations, but the veiled reference is believed to be to Morarji Desai, the late Prime Minister who was alleged to be a CIA agent.

 Party spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan side-stepped the BJPs demand for a probe into the allegations against party leaders, including Indira Gandhi, in the book The Mitrokhin Archive-II, which is yet to be published in India. We are waiting to read the book. Only then the BJP will get all the answers, she said.

 BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley demanded a probe by a judicial commission into the revelations by Mitrokhin, who co-authored the book with Cambridge professor Christopher Andrew. He said the CBI should assist in the probe. Jaitley said it was a matter of grave and serious concern for the country.

 The Congress is forever caught in a web of controversies and allegations involving national security. The country cannot afford to ignore information about high-ranking political leaders acting as agents of a foreign country and peddling security secrets in return for party funding, Jaitley said.

 As the principal constituent of the UPA government, the Congress owes an explanation to the people. They cannot gloss over their responsibilities by simply rubbishing serious allegations. But, given the Congresss track record of whitewashing damaging investigations such as the Bofors case, I doubt if the matter will ever be impartially investigated, he said.

 However, the Congress has found it amusing that Indira Gandhi is accused of receiving funds from both the CIA and KGB ? two secret agencies that competed with one another in intelligence operations during the Cold War.

 It also dismissed the allegation that Indira Gandhi might have signed the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship under KGB influence.

 The treaty is the outcome of the policies for socio-economic justice pursued by the government at that time. It is totally incorrect to say that these policies had anything to do with the KGB. In fact, The Times article, which attacks the whole gamut of Indo-Soviet friendship, is absurd, it said.

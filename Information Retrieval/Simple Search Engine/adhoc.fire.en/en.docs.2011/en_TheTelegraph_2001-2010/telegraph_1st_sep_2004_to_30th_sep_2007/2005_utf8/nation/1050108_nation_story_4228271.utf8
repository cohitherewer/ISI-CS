 Volunteers keep aid going

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA 

 Port Blair, Jan. 7: At Rabindra Bangla Vidyalaya, Ravi Shankar?s face smiles benevolently down at all who pass. A bust of Rabindranath Tagore stands with face covered, awaiting inauguration. But the poet will have to wait. When the tsunami crashed onto the coastline, formalities were replaced by bare necessities as students gave way to refugees from all across the archipelago. 

 The Art of Living guru?s image here is evidence of Port Blair?s small band of devotees busily providing food at this government camp. 

 There are few local NGOs at work here without spiritual affiliation, possibly because poverty and its related ills are missing from the capital city. The church, temples and other religious organisations have come forward to chip in. 

 Teachers have also become integral to the effort. At the Rabindra Bangla Vidyalaya camp, there is a man by the name of Bablu Jha. He is a lab assistant at the government school and, like all the staff of the sprawling campus in the middle of town, teaching duties have been displaced by relief work. Bablu was assigned the task of looking after food distribution. But with a shortage of hands on deck, he put his cooking skills to the test. For the first four days or so, he almost single-handedly cooked meals for 1,200 people from all across the islands. 

 Now there are fewer mouths to feed and the man from Jharkhand has found tiny helpers as well ? orphans from the Ramakrishna Mission in Port Blair who had to evacuate their home when the water started gushing in. ?These kids always like to be helpful. They know that when you do good, it always comes back to you,? smiles Bablu. 

 Just before lunch time, he was busy frying around 20 kg of brinjal. ?Now, mainly Bengalis are left here, so the food is made to their tastes.? Rice, dal, begun bhaja and papad is on the menu. ?And for our Tamil brothers, there is some khatta pani (rasam),? he adds. 

 While such impromptu gestures have ensured that the aid machinery runs relatively smoothly, NGOs are apprehensive about relief reaching those in need. Tonnes of material come in from the mainland everyday, some of which is not needed. ?Some organisations are sending material like rice and water. We have those things in plenty,? said Samir Acharya, head of the Society for Andaman and Nicobar Ecology, or SANE, one of the few local NGOs. 

 A visit to the camps showed that there were no water purification tablets. ?We bought and distributed them. When the local relief authorities found out, we were told they had thousands of them tucked in a warehouse somewhere,? he said.

 At the same time, unofficial reports indicate that aid has not reached a number of remote areas in the islands. 

 On Day 13, time is surely running out.

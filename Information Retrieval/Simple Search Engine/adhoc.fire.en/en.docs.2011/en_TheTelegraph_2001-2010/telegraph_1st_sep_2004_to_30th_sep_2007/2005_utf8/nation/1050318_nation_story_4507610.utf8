 Products safe, says Johnson 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 17: Johnson and Johnson India today said its baby care products meet stringent global quality standards set by its mother company, Johnson and Johnson Worldwide, and would respond to the showcause notice sent by the Food and Drug Administration within the stipulated 15 days.

 The Indian subsidiary of the American multinational issued a statement a day after it was disclosed that the Maharashtra FDA had asked the company to remove the word ?baby? from nine of its products. The FDA felt that the company was selling normal cosmetics as specially meant for babies without proper clearances.

 The statement from the company said: ?More than 200 safety tests and extensive product trials were conducted in India and many more across the world on babies and adults to ensure that the baby product formulations are mild, gentle and safe. These products have been used by mothers on millions of babies in more than 175 countries for over 100 years.?

 The statement said the products made in India are manufactured and sold under licence and approval from the FDA.

 On the use of mineral oil, the company clarified that ?Johnson?s Baby Oil uses a pure grade of mineral oil. This oil meets Johnson and Johnson?s worldwide specifications and has been clinically proven to be mild, gentle, and safe for use on a baby?s sensitive skin.?

 The company denied that it had flouted any regulatory guideline in India.

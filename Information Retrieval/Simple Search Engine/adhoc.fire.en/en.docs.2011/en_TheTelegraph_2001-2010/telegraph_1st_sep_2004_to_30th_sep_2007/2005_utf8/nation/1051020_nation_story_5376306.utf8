 Probe cry into missing seamen

 Indians mysteriously disappearing on the high seas emerging

 demanded an investigation by the CBI or Interpol.

Where do we go if someone has gone missing in the middle of an ocean? asked Zaheer Zaidi, whose 23-year-old son had disappeared from a ship sailing from Karachi to Mombasa in Kenya.

 hile the shipping company claimed it was a case of suicide, Zaidi said: I am sure he was murdered because he had stumbled on some drug-trafficking racket.

 At a news conference here, Zaidi and some relatives of the missing seamen said that the government has done nothing in the matter.

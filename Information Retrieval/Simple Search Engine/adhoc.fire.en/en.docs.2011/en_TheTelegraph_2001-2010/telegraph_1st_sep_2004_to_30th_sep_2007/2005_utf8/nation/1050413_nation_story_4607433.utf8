 Manmohan: Rural check 

 New Delhi, April 12: Manmohan Singh today launched his government?s ambitious rural health mission with the admission that past governments had not paid enough attention to the sector.

 ?The goal of the mission is to improve the availability of and access to quality healthcare by people, especially for those residing in rural areas, the poor, women and children,? says the preamble to the mission?s document released today.

 ?The Indian health system,? the Prime Minister said at Vigyan Bhavan, ?is perhaps guilty of many sins of omission and commission?.

 ?There is no denying the fact that we have not paid adequate attention to this dimension of development for too long,? he added.

 So the health mission ?aims to undertake architectural correction of the health system to enable it to effectively handle increased allocations as promised under the national common minimum programme and promote policies that strengthen public health management and service delivery?, the document says.

 The mission is part of the government?s commitment to the social sector and its desire to raise public spending on health from 0.9 per cent of the GDP to 2 or 3 per cent.

 Singh said the flaw had been a focused attention on certain diseases at the cost of comprehensive healthcare and a public health perspective. The country, he added, had created a delivery mode that fragmented resources and dissipated energy.

 ?Most importantly, we have paid inadequate attention to public health issues and the possibilities of social and preventive medicine.? India, the Singh said, had to act quickly to bridge the gaps in income, education and health.

 At the heart of the mission are barefoot women doctors, Accredited Social Health Activists fittingly called ASHA, who will be recruited by the panchayat and be accountable to it. 

 Trained in basic healthcare, ASHA will act as the interface between the public health system and the community.

 She will dispense allopathic and Indian medicines for ailments like diarrhoea, dysentery, common cold and fever from her drug kit, which will be replenished by health authorities in her state.

 She will assist in childbirth and advise young mothers about the care of infants and ensure that babies in her jurisdiction are vaccinated. 

 ASHA will refer serious cases to a government hospital or private dispensary, whichever is nearest and adequately equipped.

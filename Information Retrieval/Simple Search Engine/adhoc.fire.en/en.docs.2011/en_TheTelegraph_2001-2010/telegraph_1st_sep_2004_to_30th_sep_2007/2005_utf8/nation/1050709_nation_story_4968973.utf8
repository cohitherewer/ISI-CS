 Jawans fight back infiltrators

 Jammu: The army lost four men while beating back an infiltration attempt on Friday at Mendhar in Poonch, about 200 km north of Jammu, reports our correspondent.

 Four of the infiltrators, too, were killed in the six-hour gunbattle at Bhimbhar Gali sector, while the rest are presumed to have fled back across the Line of Control.

 The army said this was the most serious attempt at infiltration by Pakistan-based terrorists this year. This is yet another evidence of the continuing infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir from across the LoC, a source said.

 An army spokesperson at Nagrota, headquarters of the 16 Corps, said searches were continuing in the thickly forested area. The identity of the terrorists was being ascertained.

 British-era chest unearthed

 Chennai (PTI): A cellar believed to have been used by the Madras Bank, formed by the British government for storing cash and gold, has been unearthed at the fort St George here.

 The 10?8-feet chamber, constructed 200 years ago and lying below the museum at the fort was found three days ago when an Archaeological Survey of India team was undertaking regular conservation work.

 During the conservation work to study the seepage of water from beneath the surface in the rooms located on the southern side of the first floor, a small underground cellar was accidentally noticed. 

 It was later on closed using the Madras-type roof pattern to lay the floor. For further strength, iron flats were provided beneath the wooden floor, said superintending engineer T. Satyamurthy.

 The chest would be an added attraction to the museum in the fort which already possesses priceless documents like the marriage registration certificate of Robbert Clive, the governor of the then Madras presidency. 

 Cops get back Beant killer

 Chandigarh: Eighteen months after fleeing the high-security Burail jail by digging a tunnel, the prime accused in the assassination of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh was remanded in police custody on Friday, reports our correspondent.

 Tihar arrest

 Woman rescued

 Chennai (PTI): An Indian woman who was working as a domestic servant in Kuwait and later subjected to sexual harassment by her employer, has been brought back home to Aruppukottai village in Tamil Nadu. Subbulakshmi, wife of a tea-stall owner, had gone to Kuwait in December 2004. 

 Trekkers missing

 Shimla (PTI): The National Academy of Audit and Accounts on Friday sounded the Himachal Pradesh authorities after its director-general and seven probationers went missing from a trekking expedition to Lahaul Valley four days ago. They had left Shimla on July 2.

 Fire deaths

 Artificial lake

 Chamba (PTI): A land-slide has blocked the Ravi river in the Bharmour area of Himachal Pradesh, forming an artificial lake and triggering fears of flash floods. People living along the river banks have been alerted and asked to move to safer places.

 India has presented several musical instruments and books on a wide range of subjects to Dhaka University in a friendly gesture. India has also assured future help to the university.

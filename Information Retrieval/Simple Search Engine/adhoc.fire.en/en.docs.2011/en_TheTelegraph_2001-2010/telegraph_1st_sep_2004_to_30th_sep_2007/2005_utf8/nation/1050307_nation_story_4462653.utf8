 Pitch fever hits rail block

 Chandigarh, March 6 (PTI): Two special trains between Attari and Chandigarh for cricket fans from Pakistan were cancelled today after the Pakistani side could not ply link trains from Lahore because of ?technical reasons?.

 The two trains were to leave Attari at 2.15 pm and 4.30 pm and reach here at 8 pm and 10.15 pm. 

 Northern Railway had made special arrangements, including setting up of welcome counters and sprucing up the two railway stations, to welcome the neighbours.

 Official sources, however, said there were not too many people interested in the train journey via Ambala.

 The Pakistan Cricket Board also returned about 4,500 of the 7,500 tickets for the match that the Punjab Cricket Association had sent. Only about 3,000 tickets were sold in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore for the Mohali test, starting on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Between lines

 Beyond printing dry announcements released by the palace, a cursory glance of the Nepali press seems to say little about the situation. But a closer look reveals some substance hidden between the lines.

 A small graphic in a weekly shows the front pages of a number of foreign newspapers. Among the headlines are ?Trouble on the roof of the world? and King sacks govt: Nepal cut off?. 

 The editorial is about trees being felled, clearly a metaphor for a muzzled press. The piece waxes poetic about how trees allow people to breathe freely, and how their roots hold the soil together.

 ?Can we ask the concerned authority to promptly correct the move and bring back greenery?? it concludes.

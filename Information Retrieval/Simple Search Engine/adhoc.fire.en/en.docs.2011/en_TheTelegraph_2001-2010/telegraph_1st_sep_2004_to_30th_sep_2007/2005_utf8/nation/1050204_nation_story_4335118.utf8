 Guns-down JJ in muscle show

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 General Singh

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: ?I am not a soft general, I am a ruthless soldier,? General J.J. Singh scoffs and points his right forefinger at a medal on his chest. ?See this, it was given for being wounded in action. I am only the second Indian army chief to wear this.? 

 But India?s 22nd army chief and the first Sikh at the top is set to unleash velvet reforms in combat operations and at the same time restructure army headquarters. 

 The medal the general points to is called the Purple Heart in the US army. The first Indian army chief who earned it was Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. The medal is important to General JJ now because the army chief, whose first instruction to his troops is to be courteous and polite and hold their guns down, wants to demonstrate that he has been through the bloodiest of battles. 

 In 1991, General JJ, then brigadier, led a series of raids against militants along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir in a drive he had codenamed Operation Mousetrap. ?I think very carefully of the names for the operations I plan,? he says in an interview. ?We neutralised 300 terrorists,? he adds. 

 During one of the raids, JJ, as he is called, was shot through the waist while commanding the 79 brigade in Baramulla. His troops feared he might not pull through. In hospital he was sewn up (?12 stitches in the pelvic region?, his aide says). A fortnight later, he decided he would not take sick leave and went back to the brigade ?so that the militants? morale was broken?. 

 Therefore, General JJ says, when he talks of softening operations by making them more targeted, it must be understood that he brings his own combat experience to bear on his personal decisions. 

 The army chief has set out four guidelines for troops in counter-insurgency operations:

 No one should be killed 

 on suspicion 

 Children and the elderly 

 should be spared 

 Troops should be wary of 

 venturing into populated localities at night; it would be 

 wiser to lay a cordon and attack at first light, preferably 

 with police 

 The strength of a battalion 

 commander will be measured in terms of surrenders (as against 

 ?kills? or ?captures?). A surrender would not be based on 

 a claim but on recovery of weapons 

 ?I am telling troops not to scale down operations but to make body language and conduct people-friendly. As soldiers we remain ruthless,? he says. 

 Away from the immediacy of combat operations, JJ said army headquarters would create a new southwestern command, likely to be headquartered in Jaipur. It will be carved out mostly from the large western command in about three months. The command will have vulnerable areas on the western border, like Chicken Neck, Shakargarh Bulge and areas east of Amritsar in its area.

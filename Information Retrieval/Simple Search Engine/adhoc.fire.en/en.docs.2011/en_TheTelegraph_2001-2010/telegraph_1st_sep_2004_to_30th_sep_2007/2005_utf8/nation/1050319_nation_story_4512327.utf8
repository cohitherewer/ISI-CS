 Woman killed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 18: A 65-year-old woman was killed when she came in contact with a snapped livewire while being chased by policemen near Patna Junction today.

 Maharagya Devi, a vendor and mother of CPI(ML) area committee member Bhasho Sahni, was one of the 150-odd vendors police targeted as part of an anti-encroachment drive. Maharagya used to sell vegetables near the station at Mithapur. 

 Bachchu Singh, a Government Railway Police officer at Patna station, said some Railway Protection Force personnel had gone to the spot to clear the encroachments when the old woman was killed after coming in touch with a livewire.

 The local vendors, who gave vent to their anger by demonstrating against police ?excesses?, said the men in khaki visited the market today to collect their daily ?commission? of free vegetables and money. ?The policemen first beat up some of us and then asked us to vacate the market. The scared woman started running to escape from the baton but stepped on a wire and died,? said Ram Pravesh, a vegetable-seller.

 The vendors also alleged that Ghanshyam Mani, an RPF inspector, regularly extorts money from them. 

 CPI(ML) state secretary K.D. Yadav condemned the incident and pointed an accusing finger at the police.

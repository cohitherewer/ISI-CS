 Tagore fan proves boon for Sourav

 Sachs: Going easy

 Calcutta, July 31: The Prince of Calcutta has his stars to thank Justice Albie Sachs was arbiter of his fate.

 Justice Sachs is known for practising soft vengeance even on those who tried to kill him and his orders carry the stamp of his convictions. He twice turned down the orders of Nelson Mandela when he was the popular President of South Africa; he and his fellow judges found a presidential decree affecting the powers of provinces unconstitutional.

 Thanks to him, the ICC has pared the six-ODI ban on Sourav Ganguly ? slapped after the Ahmedabad ODI against Pakistan for a slow over rate ? by a third.

 One of the main architects of South Africas new Constitution, Justice Sachs explained what he meant by soft vengeance during a visit to Calcutta in December 2000 as a guest of the Asia Pacific Advisory Forum on Judicial Education on Equality.

 Even the perpetrators of the old regime and its staunchest supporters have inalienable rights, most of which they have assiduously denied their opponents when they were in power. This also applies to those who tried to blow up my car and kill me.

 The car bomb in 1988 left him with a missing right arm and a dead left eye. His missing arm is almost a symbol of the suffering of the South African people during the anti-apartheid movement and is the most expressive part of his body.

 The 70-year-old judge with a soothing voice and soft demeanour ? he was born on January 30, 1935 in Johannesburg ? is one of the few white heroes of the South African saga. He is also known to be an admirer of Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray.

 From a privileged schoolboy of Jewish parents in Cape Town to a mildly rebellious university student in the late fifties to a civil rights lawyer and activist to political dissident, prisoner and exile, Justice Sachs came to be branded as one of the most wanted and hated race traitor by the apartheid security force. 

 Dressed unlike judges in tailored suits and black gowns (Its so boring) ? he wore flamboyant shirts in hues of orange and red ? Justice Sachs spoke without bitterness about his 168 days of solitary confinement in the early 60s.

 I nearly gave in on several occasions. If they (authorities) had got their timing right, maybe I wouldnt be sitting here now, maybe I would have collapsed, maybe I would have cooperated with them. 

 The security forces had mistaken his gentle manner for weakness. But the experience left him determined these s?? are not going to bully me what to do. He did not know why he held out, only that he acted like boxers, who dont know why they carry on, but they do.

 Man kills son, youth ?shot? dead

 PRAMOD KUMAR PATNAIK

 Sambalpur, March 27: In an alleged act of revenge on his wife, a 35-year-old man killed his three-month-old son in Deogarh district last night.

 In another incident, a tribal youth died under mysterious circumstances near Badibahal under Jamankira police station, about 70 km from the district headquarters of Sambalpur, last evening.

 Sanatan Pradhan, a resident of Adaka under Reamal police station, has been absconding after the murder of his child, conceived by his second wife. 

 Reamal police had arrested Sanatan a number of times over charges of torture by his first wife. According to sources, he put pressure on his second wife to have an abortion when he came to know that she was pregnant. The woman did not give in to Sanatan?s demand and delivered a child three months ago.

 An angry Sanatan then decided to take revenge, and, as the first step, killed the boy last night and fled, sources alleged. 

 Police today sent the child?s body for post mortem. However, they were not sure if Sanatan had poisoned the child to death or throttled him.

 In the other incident, 16-year-old Philip Soren was shot dead by unknown persons around 8.30 pm yesterday, said Sambalpur superintendent of police S.K. Nath. 

 According to the SP, a group of seven youths from Deogarh was on its way to Badibahal church in Sambalpur when a bullet hit Soren, leaving him critically injured. The youths could not spot anyone due to the dense forest cover.

 Soren was rushed to the nearby mission hospital from where he was referred to VSS Medical College. The youth died on the way, Nath said.

 ?The preliminary investigation suggests that hunters, who mistook Soren for a wild animal, were responsible for the death. We found sugar, matchboxes and rice near the spot where he was hit,? he added.

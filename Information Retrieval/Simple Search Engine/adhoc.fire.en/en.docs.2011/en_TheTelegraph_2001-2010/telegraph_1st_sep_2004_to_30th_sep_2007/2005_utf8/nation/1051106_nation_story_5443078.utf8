 Two women catch terror of Siwan 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Patna, Nov. 5: The man seen as the face of Indian politics criminal links was today arrested from his MPs bungalow by a police team led by two women and whisked away without being allowed a change of clothes.

 After dodging the countrys police for months, fugitive Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad Shahabuddin was surprised by a joint team of Bihar and Delhi police that had been tipped off about his arrival here yesterday.

 The arrest is likely to have deep political impact in Bihar in the middle of a crucial poll where Shahabuddins party is an ally of the Congress, which has got him arrested.

 The RJD, which has always held up the terror of Siwan as the tallest leader of Muslims in Bihar, today described him as innocent in a bid to draw the sympathy of its key minority vote bank.

 Delhi police deputy commissioner Anita Roy and sub-inspector Gauri from Siwan led the MP out of the main gate of 5 Bishambhar Dass Marg around 1.15 pm. They took him to Parliament Street police station, where one of his aides brought a set of formal clothes, allowing him to change into them.

 The Lok Sabha Speaker has been formally informed about the arrest of the MP, who has over half-a-dozen non-bailable warrants and 30 criminal cases against him. He is accused of kidnapping and killing CPI (ML) activists Munna Lal Chaudhary (1998) and Chhottelal Gupta (1999), and former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University students union Chandrashekar (1998) in Siwan.

 Bihar police had issued a nationwide alert for his arrest in August after being accused of going soft on the RJD leader.

 Roy said Bihar police have been given custody of Shahabuddin and would be taking him back. The MP didnt resist much. He is reported to be in fine health after his medical examination.

 Shahabuddin is likely to be lodged at Siwan jail, a place from where he once ran his empire.

 The arrest could change the RJDs fortunes in the third and fourth round of the staggered elections, set for November 13 and 19, which will see a large number of Muslim-dominated constituencies go to the polls.

 A whopping 24 such constituencies ? mainly from Siwan, Gopalganj and Chhapra, that is, from a region home to both Shahabuddin and Laloo Prasad Yadav ? vote on November 19. The RJD had not done well in these districts during the February polls.

 Shahabuddin, who has never lost an election, was last month externed from Siwan till December 20 by district magistrate S.K. Mal to prevent him from breaching the peace during the elections. His name was deleted from the voters list on the ground that he had been absent from his place of residence for more than six months.

 Among the warrants against him, one relates to a gunbattle on March 17, 2001, between the police and the MPs supporters at his house in Pratappur. 

 Eight of his men were killed and an AK-47, ammunition and hand-grenades seized from the house, but Shahabuddin got away.

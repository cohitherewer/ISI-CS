 ?Inner voice? spurs flight

 OUR CORRESPONDENTI

 Darjeeling, March 13: Krishna Humagaih could have opted for a luxurious life, but fled Nepal to uphold his values and bring to light the suffering his fellow countrymen.

 ?Had I agreed to write for the king, I would have been given a lot of facilities, but it would have stifled me,? said Humagaih, the vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (East).

 It all started on February 18, when Humagaih had gone to get a release of an anti-monarchy meeting held by the five political parties ? Nepali Congress, Nepal Communist Party (UML), Nepal Sadbhawana Party (Anadni Devi), Nepal Mazdoor Kisan Party and Jan Morcha Nepal at Sansichrar ? in Jhapa district.

 ?I was about to reach the house of Deepak Tamang, district president of Nepal Trade Union, when army personnel surrounded me. An acquaintance in the Nepal police set me free. I knew I had to leave the country,? said Humagaih, who had been ?released? by the state-owned Nepal Radio, much earlier.

 ?I only had Rs 200 with me. I disguised myself and entered India through the Mechi-border,? he added.

 Since then, Humagiah has been able to send only a couple of hand-written notes to his wife and children.

 Humagaih reached Siliguri on February 21.

 ?Back home, journalists are tortured if they don?t bow to the king?s whims. So I send all articles written about Nepal in the Indian media back home,? he said.

 The journalist, who believes a movement is the only solution to the ?dictatorial reign?, is garnering support across Darjeeling and Sikkim.

 ?I have to mobilise support for our cause and ensure that democracy is restored in Nepal,? he said.

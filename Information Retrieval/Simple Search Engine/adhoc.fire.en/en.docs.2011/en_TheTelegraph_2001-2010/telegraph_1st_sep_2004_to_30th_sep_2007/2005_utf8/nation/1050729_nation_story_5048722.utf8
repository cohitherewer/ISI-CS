 Given out, Irfan father stands his ground

 Mehmood Pathan: Book blues

 Ahmedabad, July 28: He has been declared out, but Mehmood Khan Pathan wont leave the crease in a hurry.

 Irfan Pathans father says its not cricket ? he claims he has been sacked as caretaker of Vadodaras Jumma Masjid by officials jealous of his sons success.

 He has now filed a caveat in a local court against his dismissal and the managements order that he vacate the one-room tenement on the premises where his sons grew up.

 The mosques managing committee has, however, appointed a new muezzin (caretaker who also announces the time of namaz) ? Mehmoods own cousin, Majid Khan.

 Pathan was sacked after a copy of the Quran ? which the mosque management claims to be the biggest in the world and 265 years old ? was found to have been damaged by seeping rainwater.

 Its the muezzins job to protect and look after the holy book, which is kept in the room above his tenement. Mehmood was in England with sons Irfan and Yusuf ? who were playing county cricket ? when the Quran got damaged.

 The Pathans no longer live in the tenement, anyway. They moved to an upmarket flat about a year ago, but some of their belongings are still in their old home.

 Pathan alleges that the Quran is just an excuse: he is being victimised by those who cannot stomach his enhanced social status.

 The trust that runs the mosque counters with a bouncer: it wishes Irfan well but Mehmood, who had always been arrogant, had become insufferably so after Irfan made good.

 Managing committee chairman Hanif Daymakumar alleges that Mehmood had gone off to England leaving the tenement locked. Since the muezzin had not handed over the keys, the trustees could not move the Quran to a safe place when rainwater began seeping in.

 But Pathan claims he had handed the keys to one of Irfans friends, who had passed it on to Daymakumar.

 The mosque job was worth only Rs 1,200 a month to the Test cricketers father ? peanuts to him nowadays ? but he doesnt want to lose it. The room, too, evokes strong emotions.

 My father worked here for 50 years and I have swept the premises as a boy. I am emotionally attached to this place, Mehmood said. He had offered the management Rs 1 lakh for repairs ? if it retained him as muezzin ? but the committee turned him down.

 Daymakumar sees the offer as another sign of Mehmoods arrogance. While we are happy for Irfan and proud of him, Pathan (Senior) was always arrogant. Things only worsened after his sons success, he said. The chairman said the trust had sacked Mehmood once 10 years ago but had then taken pity on the man and relented. I believe that was a mistake, Daymakumar said.

 The 80-year-old chairman, who has been heading the mosque since 1967, said that when he asked Mehmood to vacate the room, he threw the keys at an official. Later, he allegedly said he would not vacate the room as long as he lived.

 Daymakumar said the committee needs the room because experts have advised that the Quran be brought downstairs. 

 Every day, visitors throng the mosque to see the worlds largest Quran, a mosque official said. The breadth of a single page is about three feet and a half. And 700 pages of the book are written in golden ink, a source said.

 It has been at the mosque since 1912, when the Gaekwad family, which earlier possessed it, handed it over to the mosque.

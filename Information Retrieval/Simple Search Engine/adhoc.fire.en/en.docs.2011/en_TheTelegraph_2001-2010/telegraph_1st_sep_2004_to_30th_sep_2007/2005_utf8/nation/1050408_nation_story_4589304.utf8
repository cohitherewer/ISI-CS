 Singh sees an open door and a long road

 Srinagar, April 7: The caravan of peace rolled out on its historic first journey this morning under a cloudy sky and the shadow of threats from militants.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service was only the first step on a long bumpy road to peace that India and Pakistan had taken.

 ?A door has opened,? said Singh, who waved a blue flag to launch the bus that took passengers ?home? through a 170-km journey to Muzaffarabad.

 ?Pakistan and especially President General Pervez Musharraf have helped us open this door. This is the beginning of a new phase,? he said. They are scheduled to meet when Musharraf visits Delhi to watch the last India-Pakistan one-dayer on April 17.

 But he cautioned that ?a lot of hurdles remain in covering the road ahead? and suggested that outstanding issues could be resolved in a spirit of friendship if the neighbours dealt with these as they did with the bus service.

 One hurdle that Delhi often finds coming in the way is violence by militants, trained and aided by elements in Pakistan?s intelligence agency.

 Singh probably had this in mind when he advised ?friends in Pakistan? that ?everyone only loses? with terrorism and asked them to join hands to face this challenge.

 ?Violence is not going to solve any problem,? he said.

 Militants, however, tried. Four terror groups had threatened passengers on the Srinagar leg of the inaugural journey with death.

 Last evening, a two-member suicide squad stormed the Tourist Reception Centre in the heart of Srinagar. The centre was gutted and six persons had to be hospitalised.

 Today, two hours before the peace bus rolled from Srinagar, BSF personnel detected explosives, connected to a remote-control device, 27 km from here, near Pattan.

 But one went undetected in a closed shop in the main Pattan Bazar. It exploded 15 minutes after the bus had passed, injuring four, including a policeman. ?It was planted to make an impact, not hurt the passengers,? a police officer said.

 Over the past week, security forces have seized nearly 50 kg of RDX along the 120 km from Srinagar to Kaman Bridge over a week.

 ?India,? Singh said, ?is willing to hold Pakistan?s hand so that both of us can together create a peaceful atmosphere for our people. In this, we can and will definitely make the people of Jammu and Kashmir a partner,? he added.

 Mehbooba Mufti, chief of the ruling PDP, said she believed the bus service would help create a borderless Kashmir. ?The wall (that divided the Kashmirs) has begun to crack.?

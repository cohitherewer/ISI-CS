 SC glare on cell towers

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Mobile service providers allegedly erecting towers illegally on important monuments and residential and commercial buildings came under the Supreme Court scanner today.

 A bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, C.K. Thakker and S.H. Kapadia told public interest litigant Karma Jyot Seva Trust of Gujarat to send a reminder to the authorities concerned and listed the matter for further hearing after eight weeks.

 Counsel for the petitioner Mukul Rohtagi and Sushil Tekriwal contended that, besides erecting towers on monuments, mobile service providers also illegally build towers on the rooftops of commercial and residential complexes violating building norms.

 Tekriwal said reminders would be sent to the Centre, the department of telecom, the Union human resource development ministrys culture department, the Archaeological Survey of India and all mobile service providers. Further debate would depend on their replies in the Supreme Court.

 The PIL contended that mobile towers affect the health of humans and animals and infringe on the environment by sending electronic waves. Towers illegally erected in residential areas affect the health of children and the aged, it said.

 The trust cited a survey on neurological and other effects of mobile towers and stated that the cellular equipment, base station, antenna and mast adversely affect the health of citizens. Mobile phone masts continuously emit radio frequency radiation which have very serious health hazard implications, it said.

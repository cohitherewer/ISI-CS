 Moral mass litigants strike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 4: Tamil 

 film star Kushboo, at the centre of a controversy for appearing 

 to condone pre-marital sex, was till this evening facing 

 23 cases in courts across the state for denigrating 

 womanhood.

 Kushboo had apologised last week after a howl of protests erupted over her reported comments in the Tamil edition of a national weekly. She had been quoted as saying there was nothing wrong with pre-marital sex so long as women took protection against disease and pregnancy, but later said her remarks had been distorted.

 Case after case was filed in district courts despite the apology, taking the number to 23 within a week, in a throwback to the time when the previous DMK regime had slammed 48 cases on ADMK chief Jayalalithaa and her erstwhile ministers on corruption charges.

 Considering Tamil Nadu has 30 districts, Kushboo is close to averaging one case per district. It is in the northern districts, where the OBC Vanniyar-dominated PMK and the Dalit Panthers of India (DPI) have a sizeable presence, that most have been filed.

 While denigrating womanhood is the common refrain, the complaints have been filed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including defamation and posing a threat to public peace.

 Several courts have already summoned Kushboo to appear on various dates this month, starting today. 

 She will have to run from one court to another across the state in response to the summons unless she approaches the high court to consolidate all the complaints at one place.

 PMK and DPI leaders S. Ramadoss and Thol. Thirumavalavan today stepped up their campaign against her and demanded an unconditional public apology.

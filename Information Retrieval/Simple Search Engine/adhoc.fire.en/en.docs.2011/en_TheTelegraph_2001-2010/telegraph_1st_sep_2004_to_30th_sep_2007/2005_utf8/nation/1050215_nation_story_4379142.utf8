 Workmen lose 240-day shield

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Services of workmen need not be regularised even after 240 days of continuous work in a year, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 ?It is now well known that completion of 240 days of continuous service in a year may not by itself be a ground for directing regularisation,? a division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha said in the judgment delivered on February 8.

 The settled position was that 240 days of continuous service in a year ?may be a ground? for regularisation.

 The judges further ruled that a workman ?shall not be ordinarily ordered to be reinstated? if he is not absorbed in a job after completing training under a government scheme. ?When a workman is appointed in terms of a scheme on daily wages, he does not derive any legal right to be regularised in his service.?

 The case related to an Uttar Pradesh government scheme for training cane-growers.

 Eleven of 45 trainees under the scheme were found to be fit and absorbed in regular service in 1986. Bhola Singh and 33 others did not qualify but continued as trainees/apprentices.

 They sought to be regularised when their services were terminated on the conclusion of the government-sponsored scheme in November 1987.

 The labour court ruled against the 34, but the high court directed their reinstatement and held that there was ?unfair labour practice? against the workmen.

 On an appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the high court verdict. It pointed out that the high court did not take notice of the fact that the workmen did not qualify for absorption.

 The apex court said the workmen continued as trainees and ?it was only when the scheme came to an end, the services of all trainees had been terminated?.

 Letter row erupts on mediators

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, May 11: The failure of the Maoist talks has ended the short honeymoon between the Andhra Pradesh police and civil rights activists who had mediated the dialogue.

 P. Varavara Rao, Gaddar and G. Kalyan Rao today alleged intimidation and slander after the police claimed to have seized from a Maoist courier a letter purportedly by Varavara Rao, and secured a magistrates warrant to search the poet-activists flat.

 In the letter, addressed to former CPI (Maoist) secretary Ramakrishna, Varavara apparently accuses Gaddar and Kalyan Rao of abusing their authority as spokesmen for the Maoists and their proximity with the government for personal gain.

 The three activists held a news conference tonight, denying Varavara had written any such letter and accusing the police of trying to defame them.

 The letter accuses Kalyan Rao of abuse of opportunity and unethical practices, saying he had used his status to raise money for his sons movie, Guerrilla. He was also allegedly engaged in the real estate business in Hyderabad in partnership with some land sharks loyal to the BJP.

 The Guntur police claim to have seized the letter some 10 days ago. Saying it was evidence of Varavaras close links with the CPI (Maoists), the police secured the search warrant from a judicial magistrate in Gurajala, Guntur.

 The Guntur superintendent of police, Jitender, said a police team had left for Hyderabad with the warrant. The Guntur police had earlier planned to raid Varavara and others for alleged involvement in the March 12 Maoist attack on the Chilakaluripeta police station. Seven people, including a police inspector, three constables and a 60-year-old woman, were killed in the raid.

 Varavara has had trouble with the police before. As editor of Srujana, a Telugu magazine, he had been kept behind bars for several years. He was also made party to the Ramnagar and Secunderabad conspiracy cases, though both were later withdrawn.

 Police say that sleuths will examine the hard disk of Varavaras computer, which he may have used to receive and send emails to the Maoists .

 The police campaign against rights activists has gathered steam since the Naxalites stepped up attacks on policemen. Six members of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee were rounded up after the recent landmine attack on Maheshchandra Ladha, Prakasham SP.

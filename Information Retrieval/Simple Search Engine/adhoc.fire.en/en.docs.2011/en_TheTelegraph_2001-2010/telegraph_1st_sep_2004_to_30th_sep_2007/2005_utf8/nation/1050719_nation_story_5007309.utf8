 Seer chargesheet

 Chennai, July 18: Jayendra Saraswati was today handed the chargesheet in the Radhakrishnan assault case, just a day after he blessed the formal launch of a Kanchi Mutt devotees forum here last night, reports our special correspondent. 

 The 23rd metropolitan magistrate, Uma Maheswari, gave out copies of the 600-page chargesheet to the Kanchi seer and 11 accused in the case of alleged assault on former mutt aide Radhakrishnan, a chartered accountant, his wife and their maid in September 2002. 

 The accused include former Kanchi Mutt manager S. Sundaresa Iyer, Raghu, the brother of mutt junior pontiff Vijayendra Saraswati, and Appu, the alleged kingpin of the contract killers. 

 Yesterday, several speakers at the launch of the Kanchi Kamakoti Bakthargal Peravai (devotees forum) lambasted the Tamil Nadu governments latest act of humiliation towards the seer. The acharya was not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of a temple in Rameshwaram last week.

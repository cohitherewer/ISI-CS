 MLAs take Bihar fight to SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: The row over the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly was resurrected today as a sizeable number of MLAs of the dissolved House filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court affirming their support to the Nitish Kumar-led NDA and claiming that they were within striking distance of forming a government.

 The petitioners said Governor Buta Singh ignored their claim and recommended the dissolution in violation of the courts earlier ruling that the single largest party or group or pre- or post-poll alliance should be given the first chance to form the government. 

 It is ex-facie clear that the manner and the indecent haste with which the dissolution of the legislative Assembly was effected was to prevent display of the majority by Nitish Kumar in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the four main petitioners, Rameshwar Prasad Chaurasia (BJP), Kishore Kumar Munna (Independent), Rampravesh Rai (JD-U) and Anil Kumar (breakaway LJP), said in an affidavit signed by 114 MLAs. 

 They claimed that they were almost close to the majority mark of 122 in a House of 243, and within striking distance of forming the government. 

 The case came up before a bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and Justice P.K. Balasubramaniyam, which said the matter was not urgent and will be listed (for hearing) in normal course.

 The petitioners referred to the S.R. Bommai judgment laying down that: a) the single largest party or combination (pre- or post-poll) should be invited to form the government and that b) the strength should be tested only on the floor of the House. Raj Bhavan or Rashtrapati Bhavan is not the place for a show of strength. The petitioners said Singh, acting in collusion with the Centre, did not respect the ruling.

 Refuting the charges of horse trading which Singh cited to recommend dissolution of the House, they said the governors conclusion was based on surmises and conjectures, adding that political considerations were behind the flimsy allegations.

 There was no specific complaint or information of horse trading received by the governor and all that was reflected in the report was that attempts would perhaps be made at horse trading....

 The Centre had said apprehensions of this nature were continuously expressed by the governor and if the House was not dissolved, it would have put democracy at peril.

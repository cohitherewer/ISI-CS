 Dance bar shadow falls on live bands

 A bar dancer in Mumbai: Cloud looms in Bangalore

 Bangalore, Aug. 12: All dressed up and nowhere to go.

 At least 1,000 artistes and workers have landed in the lurch following a shutdown of the citys joints that host live bands ? the equivalent of Mumbais dance bars ? with more than 150 joints closing down.

 The bars had failed to meet the stiff regulations set by the Karnataka government for renewal of licence, which include proper parking space, an approved plan and a certification of safety for the building and fire safety norms. 

 Bangalores live-band performers, without a livelihood for around two months, have decided to raise their voice against bar-owners who have not renewed their licences. On September 1, they will launch a hungerstrike in the city to draw the state governments attention to their plight.

 The regulations, which had the approval of half-a-dozen government agencies, were enforced soon after the Maharashtra ban on dance bars in June to check the migration of dancers and bar-owners from Mumbai.

 The government must force the owners to submit all documents for renewal of licences and reopen the bars. Otherwise, let the government sanction loans of Rs 2-5 lakh for self-employment for all artistes, said Sangeetha (her stage name).

 Along with Nisha (stage name), Bhupesh Kumar, Sethu Bhai and nearly a thousand members of the Karnataka Live Band Artistes and Workers Union, Sangeetha handed over a memorandum to chief minister Dharam Singh today.

 According to Sangeetha and Nisha, Bangalores live band industry has more than 7,000 performers and workers and all have been rendered jobless.

 The situation is bad. Two artistes have committed suicide as our livelihood has been hit. I have been singing (at one joint) for 15 years to support my children, a younger sister and a mentally disabled brother. I dont dress in revealing clothes and am not shy to face the camera (electronic media). How can my children continue in school if I dont sing? asked Sangeetha.

 Kumar said the closure of dance bars in Mumbai had triggered a rush of dancers and workers to Bangalore, which made Singhs government crack the whip. A host of people also landed from the Northeast and Uttar Pradesh.

 Police commissioner Ajai Kumar Singh, who drew up the new regulations, refused to comment on the row. These are dens of illegal activities and places frequented by rowdies. I have asked for approvals from different agencies and will limit the timings to 11.30 pm, he said.

 Phuchkawallas, bhelpuri sellers, udipi kiosks and dhabas across the country will soon have the government looking over their shoulders when they dish out their delicacies.

 The Centre has commissioned a study on street food and imported and domestic food products in the country.

 Rachel George, dean of G.B. Pant Agriculture and Technology, Pant Nagar, Uttaranchal, will be the national coordinator for the survey. Sixteen home-science colleges will be identified for carrying out the surveys in their respective areas.

 The decision is part of the health ministry?s bid to ensure standard food safety norms across the country and match these to international parameters.

 ?We realise these are the first steps in the right direction and it will take some time before we can bring Indian safety standards in line with international food safety norms,? said a senior health ministry official.

 ?We have no data bank. These surveys will at least give us some basic figures with which we can begin preliminary work,? the official added.

 The government hopes the survey will also help teach street vendors more hygienic methods of preparing food and familiarise those in the business with the necessity of serving clean meals and snacks.

 With the World Trade Organisation agreement coming into force, the government realises that Indian produce will not make the grade internationally unless stringent food safety regulations are maintained.

 Last month, red chilli powder exports from India to the UK were found unsafe for consumption by British food inspectors. This was a setback for Indian packed products in Britain.

 The government does not want such incidents to affect the country?s spiralling food processing industry. The health authorities want food production units to adopt hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP), which will ensure food safety standards followed in developed nations.

 India?s food industry has had an impressive growth rate in recent years. 

 Food processing is now 6.3 per cent of the GDP, 13 per cent of exports and provides 18 per cent industrial employment. The government expects 10 per cent annual growth in this sector.

 The health authorities realise that both the Centre and the states have a number of rules and regulations but there is an urgent need to upgrade the skills of food safety inspectors and others involved in quality control.

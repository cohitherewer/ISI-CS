 Air force looks beyond, plans fleet overhaul

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: The Indian Air Force has proposed to upgrade nearly its entire fighter and transport aircraft fleet and is working to expand its area of operations beyond Indian airspace, the vice-chief of air staff, Air Marshal Ajit Bhavnani, said here today.

 The programme to upgrade that air headquarters has taken up is in addition to its multi-billion-dollar order to buy 126 multi-role combat aircraft for which five major military aircraft makers are competing. 

 The IAF has a sanctioned fighter fleet of 39.5 squadrons (between 16 and 20 aircraft in each squadron) but was operating at about four squadrons below that level. In the current fiscal, the air force has a budget allocation of Rs 12,791 crore.

 The vice-chief was speaking at the end of the IAF commanders conference, a bi-annual feature. 

 Bhavnani said the IAF was re-visiting its doctrine ? the theoretical document that frames the IAFs operational capability ? and was carrying out a study to include expeditionary activity.

 In military terms, expeditionary activity means the ability of a fighting force to operate beyond own shores. The Indian forces have experience of expeditionary activity as part of the colonial military before 1947 and then on as part of UN peacekeeping operations. 

 In recent times, the two occasions that the Indian military operated on foreign shores as a fighting force were a mixed bag ? they were successful in the Maldives but met with disaster in Sri Lanka.

 The programme to upgrade the IAFs fleet was being dovetailed into this exercise and it includes not only modernisation of its squadrons but also addition. The vice-chief did not want to say how much the upgrading would cost. 

 We have a vision of the air force in (the year) 2015. We know what would be our structure and we are looking at upgradations as well as acquisitions, the air marshal said. 

 A flipside of the programme, he said, would be a trimming down of personnel strength. Again he would not put figures but did point out that modern aircraft with the IAF like the Su 30 Mki could do the job of five ageing MiG 21s.

 The current exercise in the IAF to study expeditionary capability, he said, was meant for assistance and disaster management purposes in friendly countries. This is quite removed from the western ? currently American ? definition of expeditionary military activity that defines the capability to invade a country thousands of kilometres away. 

 The air marshal said the IAFs ambit of overseas operations under the UN was already increasing with the deployments to Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

 The IAFs ambition of developing expeditionary capability is also borne out of intensified military exchanges with foreign air forces over the last two years. Bhavnani said IAF contingents for bilateral and multilateral air combat exercises had turned out an outstanding performance.

 The air marshal said expeditionary ability the IAF envisaged would demand expanding and upgrading its flying, chiefly airlift, capability. The air force was looking at acquiring six air-to-air refuellers (IL78s) and other medium-category transport aircraft like Hercules C-130s from the US.

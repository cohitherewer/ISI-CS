 Mishap in middle of sleep penalty

 Chennai: Run five times around the school ? that was the punishment handed down by a teacher to a student in a remote Tamil Nadu village for having slipped into a blissful siesta after lunch, reports our special correspondent.

 But now the unsparing teacher is facing the heat, as the boy, knocked down by a speeding van while in the fifth round of the punishment, lies seriously injured with a fractured knee and his anguished parents have taken up the matter with the district education authorities.

 Eight-year-old Vetrivel, studying in Class IV, had dozed off in the classroom after the mid-day meal in the Panchayat Union Primary School at Reddiyarpatti, said sources in Madurai.

 Vetrivel?s furious teacher woke him up and asked him to do five laps around the school as punishment.

 The boy started running on the main road around the school building. The school does not have a compound wall, which in itself can invite action by the authorities.

 Into his last lap, Vetrivel was knocked down by a van passing by, fracturing his left knee and badly bruising his right leg.

 Even before Vetrivel?s father Pandaram, a farmer, could be reached, the teacher and the van driver decided to back up their remorse with some remedial action.

 The duo took the boy to a private hospital nearby, where doctors performed a minor surgery to set right the fracture and also treated the injured right leg. By then, Pandaram and his family members came to know of the incident.

 However, the hospital served a hefty bill of Rs 21,500, which sources said, Vetrivel?s family could ill afford to cough up. The schoolteacher and the van driver decided to pay Rs 6,000 each towards the medical expenses, sources said. The rest of the amount was raised by Pandaram by pledging his wife?s jewellery.

 The incident would not have seen the light of day had the boy?s father not preferred to broach the issue ? several days after the incident ? to a local human rights organisation. Apparently, Pandaram could not continue his son?s treatment in the private hospital and verbally complained to the organisation that the schoolteacher and the van driver, who were responsible for his son?s pitiable condition, had not lived up to their commitments in meeting the medical expenses.

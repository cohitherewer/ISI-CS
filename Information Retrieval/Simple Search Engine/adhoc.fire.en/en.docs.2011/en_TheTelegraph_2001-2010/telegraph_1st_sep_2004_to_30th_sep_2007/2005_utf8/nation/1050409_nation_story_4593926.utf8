 Natwar on US mission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: Foreign minister Natwar Singh is leading a high-level team to Washington next week on what appears to be a mission to probe the US offer to supply military hardware and access to nuclear and space technology.

 Singh?s three-day trip, beginning Tuesday, follows an invitation from US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice when she was in Delhi last month. President George W. Bush has invited the Prime Minister to visit the US as well, sometime between June and July.

 Apart from foreign secretary Shyam Saran and other ministry officials, deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia will be part of Singh?s delegation. 

 However, all eyes will be on R.B. Grover, director of the strategic planning group of the department of atomic energy, and V. Sundaramaiah, scientific secretary of the Indian Space Research Organisation.

 Right after announcing its decision to give F-16s to Pakistan last month, the US had offered India freer access to its civilian nuclear and space technology in addition to a host of military hardware.

 While in Washington, the foreign minister will take the opportunity to ascertain how serious the Bush administration is about the offers. India is especially keen on getting access to US space technology, which has been denied to Delhi since the mid-1970s.

 With an upswing in Indo-American ties, the time is ripe to put in place a framework that will allow the two countries to build military and economic bridges.

 A US delegation is expected to visit India next week to hold discussions on these issues, particularly Washington?s proposal to set up a joint working group on cooperation in space and energy.

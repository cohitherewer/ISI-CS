The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Best feet forward at lunch table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Standing together?

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: Lal Krishna Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee put on a show of camaraderie today when the outgoing BJP president invited the party top brass to lunch.

 All the six general secretaries ? Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Sanjay Joshi, Om Prakash Mathur and Ananth Kumar ? and senior leaders Jaswant Singh, Bal Apte, V.K. Malhotra and Sushma Swaraj also attended the lunch meeting at Advanis home.

 Sushma later took questions on the meeting. Asked if the party, particularly Vajpayee, supported Advanis stand on resisting interference from the RSS, she said: I am not qualified to comment on what each individual in the party feels about the presidents concluding remarks.

 At Sundays concluding session of the partys national executive in Chennai, Advani had announced his decision to step down as president in December and asked the Sangh not to meddle in the partys day-to-day functioning.

 The RSS spokesperson has addressed this issue at length. If there is going to be a discussion on Advanijis remarks, there will be an appropriate time and forum for that. I am not eligible for commenting on such issues, Sushma said.

 She denied that the lunch was a farewell party. Advaniji is here till December. What is the meaning of such terms? He will be with us.

 The BJP leader bristled at suggestions that the party was relieved to see Advani go. What do you mean by such suggestions? No one could attempt to prevent Advaniji from leaving because he made this announcement in a public meeting. All of us were shell-shocked, Sushma said.

 Advani announced his decision to step down after months of pressure from the Sangh and immediately after a public spat with Vajpayee ? among the few who had backed him in his battle with the Sangh ? over M.L. Khuranas expulsion.

 To a suggestion that if Advanis decision to quit had come as a surprise, the reaction to stop him should have been more forceful, Sushma said: We were numb, shocked. Advaniji had thought everything out and he made the announcement in his concluding remarks. There is no convention about a debate on the concluding remarks of the party president.

 She said todays meeting was called to discuss three issues ? the revelations by former KGB agent Vasili Mitrokhin about money allegedly paid to the Congress and the CPI in the seventies, the sensex and the Naxalite menace.

 It was decided that Vajpayee, Advani and Jaswant would write to the President demanding a detailed probe by a Supreme Court judge into the Mitrokhin allegations, she said.

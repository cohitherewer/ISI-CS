 Chhapra storm in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Parliament today was witness to stormy scenes as usual, but this time the noise did not come from the Opposition benches but from the Rashtriya Janata Dal, a partner in the ruling United Progressive Alliance.

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee came up against a defiant RJD brigade, which wanted to raise the latest revelations on the Chhapra repoll during zero hour.

 IAS officer L.V. Saptharishi had written to the Centre, alleging that election commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy had pushed through the BJPs demand for countermanding the Lok Sabha election in Chhapra.

 Chatterjee turned them down, as did Rajya Sabha chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.

 Waving a paper ? supposedly a copy of Saptharishis letter to Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj ? the RJD MPs took up the matter as soon as the House met this morning. When the Speaker said question hour could not be disrupted, the MPs raised the issue soon after it was over.

 Chatterjee, however, did not allow the matter to be discussed even then. He said the charges concern a constitutional authority and cannot be raised during zero hour. It can only be discussed, if at all, under a substantive motion, he said. 

 The Speaker added that he would ?consider? it after the RJD served a proper notice identifying the motion under which it wanted a discussion.

 The RJD members, prodded by railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav in the front row, ignored him and continued their protests.

 Under directions from the RJD chief, his party members insisted on a discussion then and there. ?This is a matter of national importance,? a leader said.

 Chatterjee refused to budge and finally adjourned the House 10 minutes before the scheduled time. ?I condemn this behaviour,? he said.

 The Speaker also read out from the rule book, which bars discussion of constitutional authorities without substantive motions. He told the MPs that he was aware of the importance of the matter, but rules cannot be bent at will.

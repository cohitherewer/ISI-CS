 Money slur adds to grief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kumbakonam, July 10: The parents want justice; all they are getting are snide remarks from jealous neighbours.

 They accuse us of having made a tidy sum over the dead bodies of our children, fumed Anandhi, whose son Muruganandham, a class IV student, died in the blaze. 

 Her village, Natham, 7 km from here, lost 13 children.

 The families of each of the 94 dead received at least Rs 2 lakh from the state and central governments besides cash from political parties. 

 But the tardiness in the prosecution of the school authorities weighs heavy on the parents mind.

 Who wants all this money? Anandhi sobs as she looks at her sons photograph at their home. 

 We are dying every day since our little boy was gone. Our lives have been turned upside down; we have no mental peace at all.

 Fridays are the worst, said Amudha, who lost her third son, Sridhar, to the flames.

 The families are struggling to overcome their loss in their own way. 

 Anandhi has adopted a three-month-old boy while Chitra of Palakarai, who lost her daughter, is looking to start life again with a new baby. 

 She has gone in for in-vitro fertilisation.

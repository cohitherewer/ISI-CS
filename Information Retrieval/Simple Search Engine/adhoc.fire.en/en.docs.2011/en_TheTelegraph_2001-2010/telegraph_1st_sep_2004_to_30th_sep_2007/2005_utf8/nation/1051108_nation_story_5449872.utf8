 Heroin hidden in Sumo window

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 7: Mumbai police today made one of the biggest narcotics seizures in recent years when their anti-terrorist squad (ATS) netted 16 kg of heroin worth Rs 16 crore in the international market.

 Joint commissioner K.P. Raghuvanshi, who heads the squad, said: We had information about a drugs consignment coming from Rajasthan. Our team intercepted a Tata Sumo at Matunga and recovered the heroin. It was concealed in cavities created below the windows of the vehicle.

 Three persons ? identified as Feroze Adam Khan, Samsher Khan Pathan and Devilal Dangi ? were held under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The trio hails from Rajasthan. 

 This is the biggest seizure by Mumbai police in recent times and a first by the ATS. We are still investigating where the heroin was headed and who are behind it, Raghuvanshi said.

 In the early nineties, Mumbai used to be a transit point for trafficking heroin to European countries via the Golden Triangle. The police had then set up an anti-narcotics cell to bring the drug mafia to book. 

 The cell made some seizures, but was wound up. It was not revived as the government felt that the anti-narcotics cells of other enforcement agencies like the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Narcotics Control Bureau were sufficient to deal with the trafficking menace.

 Todays seizure comes a week after the DRIs anti-narcotics cell seized 50 kg of hashish worth Rs 1.5 crore in the international market from a truck driver identified as Narendra Singh. The DRI sleuths intercepted the truck he was driving at Chakala in Andheri. The hashish was kept in two gunny bags concealed in the drivers compartment.

 Investigations revealed that Singh, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, was carrying the consignment from Kulu- Manali. He had loaded a stock of industrial pipes at Chandigarh, which he delivered to a factory in Vapi in Gujarat before entering Mumbai. 

 An agent was supposed to collect the gunny bags at a spot in Andheri. But before the agent arrived, the DRI team intercepted the truck.

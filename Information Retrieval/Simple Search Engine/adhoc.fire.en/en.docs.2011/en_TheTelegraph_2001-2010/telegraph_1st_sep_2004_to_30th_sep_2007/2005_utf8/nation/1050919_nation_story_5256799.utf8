 BJP rings migration alarm

 Chennai, Sept. 18: Bangladesh has effortlessly expanded its border by 15 to 20 km inside India, the BJP said today, painting a worrying picture of illegal immigration, reports our special correspondent.

 There are now about 2 crore Bangladeshi infiltrators in India, a four-page resolution on internal security adopted on the last day of the BJP national executive said.

 The demographic profile of some of the countrys border districts ? especially in Assam, Bengal and Tripura ? has been changing so fast that there is a strong possibility of the local population being reduced to a minority, party general secretary Pramod Mahajan told a news conference.

 As a solution, the BJP wants a lighted fencing along the entire Indo-Bangladeshi border and the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act scrapped, as directed by the Supreme Court.

 The resolution mentioned terrorism and Naxalism as two other major challenges to Indias security.

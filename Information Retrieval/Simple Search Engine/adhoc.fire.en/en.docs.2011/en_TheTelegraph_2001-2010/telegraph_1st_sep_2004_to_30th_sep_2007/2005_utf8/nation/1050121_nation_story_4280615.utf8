 Poll panel issues last warning 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 20: The Election Commission today issued a mend-your-ways-or-suffer ultimatum to the Rashtriya Janata Dal led by Laloo Prasad Yadav ? without naming either ? over the alleged misuse of the U.C. Banerjee committee?s interim report on the Godhra train burning.

 ?We will take very serious action if our patience is tested too much. We may not now give an opportunity to those violating the model code of conduct to explain their position,? warned chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy.

 Krishnamurthy?s reference to an opportunity to ?explain? comes in the backdrop of the RJD chief giving an apologetic ?undertaking? to the poll panel after charges of violation of the model code were made against him for distributing cash among villagers at a rally. 

 The RJD was charged with misusing state machinery in the wake of a rally on December 23.

 ?I cannot give a clear-cut answer to that (whether the poll panel would order an investigation into the charge of the report already being misused by the RJD president) because we have to examine all aspects of the matter,? said the chief election commissioner.

 ?But I can assure you that anyone found wanting in this regard will not be spared,? said Krishnamurthy, who was flanked by election commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswami.

 However, Laloo Prasad claimed that he had not waved a copy of the Banerjee committee report and had only used the ?press release? issued when it was made public. ?People have a right to know the truth and I have done just that. The Election Commission can consider the matter,? the RJD chief said after releasing the party?s poll manifesto, which did not have any reference to the report despite RJD leaders assuring that there would be.

 The election commissioner used the opportunity to say that the panel had made ?alternative arrangements? for conducting the elections in case the government employees? strike was not called off, ?but state officials have assured me that they are hopeful of the strike being called off?.

 ?We have doubled the number of paramilitary personnel compared to the parliamentary elections. But at our meetings here, more deployment was pressed for. We will take up the matter with the Union home ministry,? Krishnamurthy said.

 He stressed that a person who has been provided security by the state should not be seen in an area where he is not a voter during the elections. The poll panel chief also said that if paramilitary personnel were unable to reach a booth on time, polling would not be held there. 

 ?We will not hesitate to order a repoll from wherever we receive the slightest report of irregularities,? Krishnamurthy said. 

 Left backs RJD

 The CPM has put its weight behind Laloo Prasad in his row with the Election Commission over the U.C. Banerjee report.

 ?The Election Commission should not remove politics from election. What is wrong with using a published report? It is in the public domain. It helps the cause of secularism,? senior politburo member Prakash Karat said at a press conference today.

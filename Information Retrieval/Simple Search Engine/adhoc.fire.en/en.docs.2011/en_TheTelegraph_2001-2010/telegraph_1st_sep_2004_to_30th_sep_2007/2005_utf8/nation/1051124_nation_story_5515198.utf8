 Meat cloud on army

 New Delhi, Nov. 23 (PTI): Close on the heels of liquor and petroleum purchase scams, the army has been rocked by another scandal with allegations of massive irregularities in the purchase of meat for the frontier region of Ladakh, including Siachen.

 The allegations surfaced after two senior generals, the Commandant of the Army Service Corps Centre and the director-general, supply and transport, accused each other for the scam running into crores of rupees.

 The defence ministry has asked army chief General J.J. Singh to order a probe into the charges.

 The generals allegedly signed the contracts when they were posted at Northern Command headquarters in Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir in 2003.

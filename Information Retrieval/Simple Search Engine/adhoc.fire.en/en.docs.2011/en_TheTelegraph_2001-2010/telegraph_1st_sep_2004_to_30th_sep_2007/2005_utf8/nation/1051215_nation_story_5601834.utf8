The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Minor rape count shoots up

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Madhya Pradesh, where women have had their hands chopped off for reporting rape or protesting against child marriage, is the most unsafe place in India even for minor girls. Delhi, dubbed the nations rape capital, isnt far behind.

 Figures on rapes of minors compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau show Mizoram as the safest state in India and Bengal among the safer ones.

 Rapes of under-18s have shot up in most states over the past three years, rising from 2,532 in 2002 to 3,541 in 2004.

 Madhya Pradesh comes out worst, having registered 710 in 2004 ? up from 517 in 2002. Maharashtra is second with 634 in 2004, an increase of 29 per cent in two years, and Uttar Pradesh is third with 394 ? though this amounts to a fall of 5 per cent since 2002. Mizoram has recorded none.

 Among the more populous states, Bengal comes 19th with 19 rapes of minors in 2004 against 16 two years earlier. Bihar has surprised with only three such cases last year as well as in 2002, giving it the rank of 24, better even than the northeastern state of Manipur where four under-18s were raped in 2004.

 A bureau official, however, was sceptical about Bihars showing. He put the exceptionally low figure down to Bihar polices well-known reluctance to register FIRs.

 Among the less-populated Union territories, Delhi has the worst record of 186 rapes of minors in 2004 with Chandigarh coming a distant second at 13. Lakshadweep recorded zero from 2002 through 2004, tying for the safest tag with Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

 But bureau officials said the figures would have been much higher had the families of raped minors all reported the crimes and the various state polices recorded them.

 Mangal home keeps out film

 Ballia (Uttar Pradesh), Aug. 14 (PTI): The Rising faces a ban in Uttar Pradesh for alleged distortions.

 The (state) government will consider a ban on the film if distorted historical facts are not taken out, co-operatives minister Shardanand Anchal said today.

 The film could not be released in its protagonist Mangal Pandeys home district, Ballia.

 Eminent local citizens and students are protesting against the film for distortion of historical facts and no reference to his (Pandeys) native village, Nagwa.

 The ruling Samajwadi Party plans to raise the matter in the Rajya Sabha.

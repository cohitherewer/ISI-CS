 Check in, but in cuffs

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Feb. 6: Criminals in Punjab will now be able to enjoy a luxurious stay in jail.

 With the state police unable to rein in crime and jails being overcrowded, the government has decided to construct modern jails, where prisoners can avail facilities never provided earlier in the country?s prisons. The government will also upgrade and modernise the existing ones.

 Punjab has seven central jails in Patiala, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Jalandhar and Ludhiana in addition to five district and 11 sub-jails, which can accommodate 9,484 prisoners. But the occupancy rate is as high as 150 per cent in most of them.

 According to the jails chief parliamentary secretary, Malkiat Singh Birmi, prisons in the state would be equipped with separate cells having beds, attached toilets, TV sets, fans and round-the-clock water supply ? a rarity in any part of the state. While air-conditioning in some cells is not being ruled out, hot air blowers could be installed to fight the harsh winter.

 The decision to provide five-star treatment to criminals while undergoing sentences or trials comes after Birmi and jails adviser A.P. Bhatnagar visited Australia and Malaysia recently to study the functioning and administration of jails there. The one-point agenda of the visit, ordered by chief minister Amarinder Singh, was to replicate the conditions existing in the foreign jails.

 The Opposition Shiromani Akali Dal has derided the move. Party secretary Daljeet Singh Cheema said: ?After jailing so many of our leaders, including those who had been ministers, on false charges and treating them like animals in jail, Amarinder Singh and his Congress colleagues are fearing the same treatment when we ride back to power in the next polls and are trying to ensure that they remain comfortable when their time comes to cool their heels in jail. 

 ?That is why they want to build the new jails before the 2007 polls.?

 Birmi and Bhatnagar not only studied jail conditions during their trip but also roped in a Malaysian construction firm, IJI, to do the job.

 In the first phase, two modern high-security triple-storied jails would be constructed in Nabha and Kapurthala. The state government would provide land and funds for the purpose and the prisons would be ready to house inmates before the next Assembly polls. Each jail will have the capacity to accommodate 5,000 inmates. Those lodged in Patiala and Jalandhar jails would be the first to enjoy the facilities.

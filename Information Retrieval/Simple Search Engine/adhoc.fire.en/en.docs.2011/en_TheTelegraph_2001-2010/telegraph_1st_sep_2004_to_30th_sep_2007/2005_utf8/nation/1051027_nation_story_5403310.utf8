 Sonia advises austerity, Sheila mulls pay hike

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Sonia proposes, Sheila disposes ? or is it dispenses?

 Sonia Gandhis directive to Congress ministers and state units to cut down on costs could fly out of the window when Sheila Dikshits cabinet meets tomorrow to decide a long-awaited salary hike for Delhi ministers and MLAs.

 Delhi government sources said a discussion on the hike is on the agenda. The proposal is to make the salaries equivalent to that of what ministers and MLAs get in Goa, said a source.

 Officials chose Goa as the model after taking into account its size and comparing salary structures of several states. 

 If the proposal is implemented, as the Delhi chief minister had assured MLAs during a recent Assembly session, it would make a huge difference to the legislators pay packet. (See chart)

 For instance, their monthly salary would then be somewhere near Rs 5,000, nearly 70 per cent more than the Rs 3,000 they get now. For ministers, who get Rs 4,000 a month as salary, the amount would be more than double. A minister in Goa gets Rs 10,000.

 The increase is set to be more under other heads, like conveyance advance (which is treated as loan). In Delhi, ministers and MLAs get Rs 100,000, while in Goa, they get Rs 400,000. 

 The sources, however, said a decision on the hike could be deferred as Delhi finance minister A.K. Walia is out of the country and austerity is the buzz in the Congress.

 In her directive, Sonia had said party-ruled states and ministers should enforce a detailed austerity code. Among the measures was state-owned aircraft should be used sparingly and economy-class air travel for ministers.

 The code talks about enforcing a financial ceiling for official telephone bills, restricting number of official telephones and discontinuing STD and ISD facilities on official telephones at residences of ministers and officers. Minister can now make unlimited calls. 

 It also advises against the practice of giving those who head corporations, boards or commissions the rank of a minister.

 Although the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee has set up an ethics committee, austerity is still to make an appearance at the secretariat. The only difference the code has made in the government is that the ministers have stopped using red beacons on their cars, say BJP MLAs in the capital.

 The Congress presidents advisory not only restricts the use of a red beacon or siren to vehicles of the governor and the chief minister, it says the number of official vehicles with ministers should be limited to one and its use should be within the area of jurisdiction.

 According to Congress leaders, Sonias austerity drive followed criticism of Uttaranchal chief minister N.D. Tiwaris move to lavish political patronage on his supporters by appointing them to key posts in boards, commissions and corporations of the revenue-starved state government.

 Referring to Tiwari, the Sonias advisory said she was concerned to find that violations of the austerity code have again started occurring in some of the states where our party has formed the government.

 I am writing to urge you to reiterate this code among all your colleagues and among government and party functionaries in the state and ensure that it is strictly followed, it said.

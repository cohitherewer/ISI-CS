 Valley feast of weddings

 Srinagar, July 10: The Valleys wedding season is here and with no curbs on the wazwan or guests, marriage hall owners are burping in delight.

 The state governments iron fist had lost its punch when Jammu and Kashmir High Court stayed the intentions of the department of consumer affairs and public distribution to put restrictions on serving the traditional Kashmiri feast at weddings.

 Marriage hall owners in Jammu had moved the high court after minister Taj Mohi-ud-Din issued a guest-control order ? that came into effect in November ? to regulate the wazwan. The high court interim stay came in December.

 The order, which sparked a debate in political, social and media circles, pegged the number of guests at 200, inclusive of baratis and relatives, and the amount of mutton cooked for the feast at 100 kg.

 The onus of following the order was not only on the bride and grooms families, but also on the wazas (chefs). 

 The guest-control order, which has a long history of failure, seemed to be working at last, mainly because the wazas refused to oblige inducements to violate it.

 Kashmiris, especially the middle-class, were happy, too. The curb on guests and food control came as huge financial relief for them. Before the order, the rich and the neo-rich had been setting new standards in lavishness at the wedding feasts in terms of guests and the quantity of mutton, which at times exceeded 10 quintals on a single day.

 The high court stay did not pinch Kashmiris much initially as June-September is the peak marriage season in the Valley.

 But now, there is no stopping the extravagance ? the plates are full and guest lists sometimes cross 1,000.

 The Kashmiris capacity to consume a colossal amount of calories ? which comes in a 34-course meal ? has often baffled outsiders. 

 Kashmiris are the biggest carnivores on earth, Somnath Chatterjee, a resident of Calcutta, had written to a local daily last week.

 Mohi-ud-Din, however, has not lost hope. I am confident the state high court decision will be in our favour. If it is not, we will approach the apex court to seek justice for the ultimate good of the people.

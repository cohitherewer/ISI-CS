 Smelling blood, BJP strikes 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The BJP has demanded the immediate dismissal of Natwar Singh from the cabinet, criminal proceedings against him and the others named in the UN report and an investigation into the alleged payoffs.

 Saying that the issue impinged on national self-respect and honour, the BJP threatened to take the battle against Natwar Singh from Parliament to the streets.

 BJP president L.K. Advani has convened a meeting of party general secretaries tomorrow to chalk out a strategy to launch this battle, vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

 The BJP took its case to the Prime Minister, too, with Arun Jaitley writing a letter to Manmohan Singh, saying the credibility of India in the international community has taken a nosedive.

 Accusing the Prime Minister of backing Natwar Singhs continuance in the cabinet, Jaitley criticised Manmohan Singh for trying to defend the minister by observing that the UN report contained insufficient evidence to warrant any adverse conclusion.

 By rubbishing the report to score a narrow political point, you are mocking an important initiative to make the UN more accountable.

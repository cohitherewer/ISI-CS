 Patience runs thin in RJD battle of nerves

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Feb. 9: The Rashtriya Janata Dal?s patience finally ran out today or so it seems.

 Till a few days ago, Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav kept praising AICC president Sonia Gandhi as a great leader but his party spokesman today went hammer and tongs against the Congress, though he did not refer to its chief.

 It has happened for the first time in years after Laloo Prasad joined hands with the Congress.

 Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party has entered into an alliance with the Congress and it is not contesting any of the 80 seats where the party is in the race. The RJD, on the other hand, has only left the 12 seats that Congress won last time and it, along with the Left parties and the Nationalist Congress Party, is locked in a fight with the party in many constituencies. Paswan, significantly, is campaigning for the Congress candidates as well.

 ?The Congress is inexperienced in coalition politics and in running a coalition government. It is crossing the limits set by the common minimum programme. The Left has opposed this on several occasions. We are no different for the Left parties,? RJD spokesman Shivanand Tiwary said.

 Although Tiwary refrained from attacking the Congress? role in the Bihar election, the mere fact that its policies have been targeted has come as a surprise. Party sources said no RJD spokesperson speaks on significant matters without an authority from Laloo Prasad.

 ?We hope the Congress retains the 12 seats it won during the last Assembly election,? Tiwary said sarcastically.

 Media reports and analyses have been strongly indicating that the LJP-Congress alliance is weakening the RJD?s core support base in the state. ?This seems to have made the RJD panicky,? a Congress functionary said. ?A strong and re-emergent Congress, with the LJP, is not good for the health of Laloo Prasad in Bihar,? he added.

 The attack comes a day after Paswan suggested that a Muslim leader from the Congress should be considered for the post of chief minister. The LJP leader has been attacking the RJD, particularly its president, during all his election meetings and has sternly ruled out any pact with the ruling party.

 Tiwary also attacked the NDA, especially Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar, saying his ?stars are not right for his becoming chief minister?. But in Darbhanga, BJP veteran Atal Bihari Vajpayee heaped praise on Nitish Kumar. The NDA has presented Nitish Kumar as its chief ministerial candidate.

 Vajpayee also targeted the RJD and its president. ?Not satisfied with chara (fodder scam), they also gobbled up the charwaha vidyalayas,? he said without naming Laloo Prasad.

 Chennai, Aug. 7: At Keralas Guruvayoor temple, a gateway of gold will lead to the pillars of piety.

 Two weeks from now, the Krishna temple will sport a dazzling new vaasakaal (doorway) and four pillars, all made of gold, in the passage leading to the sanctum sanctorum. 

 The Rs 40-lakh gift comes from a devotee of Indian origin residing in Bahrain.

 Nearly 5 kg of 24-carat gold has been delicately hammered and pressed into shape by Chennais NAC Jewellers, who put their own staff as well as craftsmen from Hyderabad and Kumbakonam on the job.

 The 10-foot-tall doorway has an image of Lakshmi and one of Guruvayoorappa (the presiding deity) embossed on each side. 

 The four pillars, each six feet tall, have also been engraved with various religious figures and motifs.

 These will be sent to the temple and installed there on August 18, N. Anjaneyulu Chetty, a partner of NAC Jewellers, said.

 The job has taken about four months. The jewellers sent their service staff and a group of six artisans from Kumbakonam to the temple, where they took the measurements and drew the designs.

 The framework of the doorway and the pillars have been made in pure copper, Chetty said. This first stage took about a month as the artisans could work on the temple premises only for short periods every day.

 The copper pillars and the doorway were brought to Chennai. Gold leaves and foils were extracted from bars of the metal and seven layers of foils delicately plastered on the copper plates using mercury. Six expert craftsmen were brought from Hyderabad for the job.

 The thin foils are extricated from the gold bars by placing each gram of gold between sheets of camel leather and beating it continuously with one hand and turning the leather with the other hand, Chetty explained.

 A fresh group of 15 artisans from Kumbakonam lent the final touches and did the polishing. 

 The entire set is now ready to be shipped back to Guruvayoor, Chetty said.

 The last high-profile gift from Tamil Nadu to the temple was a less delicate one. Chief minister Jayalalithaa had donated an elephant after returning to power in May 2001.

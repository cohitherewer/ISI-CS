 Bengal foxed on Jindal ore

 ANUPAM SHESHANK

 Ranchi/New Delhi, Aug. 25: A 40-minute meeting at the Prime Ministers Office in New Delhi today ended in an anti-climax when Jharkhand government officials claimed that since Jindal Steel had not even applied for a mining lease in the state, there was no question of the state government turning it down.

 The meeting had been convened at the behest of the Bengal government, which complained that the neighbouring state was opposing use of its iron ore for a steel plant that the Jindals wanted to set up in Kharagpur in Bengal.

 The meeting was attended by Bengal chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and Jharkhand mines secretary Arun Kumar Singh, besides the principal secretary to the Prime Minister, the SAIL chairman and Union steel and mines secretary among others.

 Speaking on phone from New Delhi, Arun Singh told The Telegraph that Bengal was lobbying for a mining lease in Jharkhand for the Jindals. But, he added, Bengal was caught on the wrong foot when told that there was no application from the Jindals that was pending before the Jharkhand government.

 Singh, however, conceded that informally the Jindals had communicated to the Jharkhand government their requirement of 400 million tonnes of iron ore in the next 30 years. But they were advised to apply for the lease first, which they are yet to do.

 A spokesperson for Jindal Steel, speaking from London, claimed that the Jharkhand government was not ready to entertain any application unless the steel plant is located within the state. He tacitly admitted that the group is yet to submit an application for the lease. 

 Singh claimed to have told the meeting that the Jharkhand government had already signed 37 MoUs in the steel sector and it would accord first priority to them in granting mining lease.

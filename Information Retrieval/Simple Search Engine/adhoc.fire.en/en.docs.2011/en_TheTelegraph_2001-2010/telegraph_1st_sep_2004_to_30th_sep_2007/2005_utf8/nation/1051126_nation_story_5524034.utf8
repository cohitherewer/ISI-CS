 NFDC in cash mess, thanks to ad firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: The National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) is in a financial mess, thanks to some top advertising companies in the country.

 The advertisers owe the government-backed film promotion agency more than Rs 2,200 lakh.

 The matter came up in a question asked in the Lok Sabha today. The government, in a written reply, admitted that the NFDC was facing a financial crunch. 

 The corporation had marketed commercial time on slots allotted by Doordarshan to various advertising agencies, but many of them did not pay up, it said.

 The corporation also suffered when Doordarshan discontinued the practice of marketing commercial time after September 2003 and the dues could not be recovered. 

 The move came after the national television channel noted several problems in the scheme resulting in the loss of money.

 Doordarshan has now started marketing commercial time on its own.

 Documents submitted in Parliament show 16 agencies on the list of defaulters ? the highest amount due being Rs 700 lakh and the lowest Rs 13.66 lakh. Collectively, the advertisers owe the NFDC Rs 2,200.71 lakh as on October 10 this year.

 The government said steps have been taken to recover the money ? a cell has been set up and legal notices sent. Besides, wherever required, clarifications about the payments have been made. 

 A special audit went through the details of the outstanding dues and how they can be got back.

 The NFDC was formed to promote the production of films in the country. It funded upcoming filmmakers keen on meaningful cinema. But of late, its financial health has been telling on its functioning.

 Pak light on Netaji riddle

 Islamabad, Feb. 3 (PTI): Retired Pakistani Brigadier Habib-ur-Rehman, who was a member of Subhas Chandra Bose?s Indian National Army, claimed to have seen Netaji engulfed in flames and burnt alive after their plane crashed over China.

 The latest theory on the disputed death of Netaji in 1945 has surfaced in a book by Pakistan cricket board chief Shaharyar Khan, Cricket: A Bridge of Peace, where he recalls the ?extraordinary eyewitness account? of Rehman.

 Khan, a former Pakistan foreign secretary, wrote the former Pakistan army brigadier?s account after reading a report in a newspaper in Calcutta. The report quoted the Subhas Chandra Bose Society as saying that it believed that Bose was alive and asked for information on him.

 Khan said he met Rehman when the brigadier headed a four-member delegation that visited the Chinese border town of Kashgar in Muslim-majority Sinkiang province in 1967. During the meeting, Rehman ?provided the eyewitness account of Netaji?s death?.

 ?Brigadier Habib Rehman told us that he had been a leading member of the Indian National Army and had been court-martialled on his return to India. On serving out his sentence, he had joined the Pakistan Army?

 ?Brigadier Habib recounted that in 1945, Bose had selected him as one of his aides and he was, therefore, required to accompany his leader on his journeys,? the former foreign secretary wrote.

 Rehman claimed that he had accompanied Netaji on the fateful air journey from Saigon to Tokyo in 1945. ?They had boarded the aircraft at Saigon and after a refuelling stop, the plane was flying over northern Taiwan when one of the engines began to sputter.

 ?The plane rapidly lost height but the pilot managed to bring it down on a clearing where it crashed into heavy undergrowth. The occupants were severely injured, some dying instantly, others escaping with injuries. Habib himself had been thrown clear as the plane plunged into a thicket because he was sitting near the tail of the aircraft,? Khan recalled.

 ?Though bruised and groggy, Habib found he could still move and ran immediately towards the burning aircraft to see if he could rescue his leader and others who may have survived. When he reached, he saw the charred body of Bose lying beside the aircraft?.? 

 Netaji had died because ?his suit had caught fire and burnt his body beyond recognition?, Khan quoted Rehman as saying. 

 Khan wrote that he, along with other members of the team, was ?privy to an extraordinary eyewitness account of a truly historic occurrence that is still shrouded in mystery. I repeat only what I heard on that night in Kashgar?.

 No crash: Taiwan

 The Taiwan government has informed the one-man Netaji Commission during its visit there that there was no air crash at Taihoku on August 18, 1945, which is believed to have killed Bose. 

 Justice M.K. Mukherjee said in Calcutta that Taiwan has told the panel that no plane crashed at Taihoku between August 14 and September 20 and promised to provide documentary proof within 15 days.

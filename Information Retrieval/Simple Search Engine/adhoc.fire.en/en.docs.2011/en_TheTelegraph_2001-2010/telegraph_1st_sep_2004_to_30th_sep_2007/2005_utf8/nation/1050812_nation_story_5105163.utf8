 The Nandankanan zoo today lived up to its reputation of being an unsafe place for animals when two stray dogs sneaked into an enclosure and mauled its two rare chousinghas, or four-horned antelopes, to death.

 Zoo officials said the dogs sneaked into the lone enclosure of the four-horned antelopes this morning through the huge gaps in the enclosure and jumped over the moat before attacking the shy, wary antelopes.

 The antelopes, listed in the IUCN Red Book as vulnerable species, are known to dash swiftly for cover at the first sign of danger. However, the rare animals probably could not do so as they did not have an escape route.

 With these deaths, the zoo now has lost these rare animals ? a tragedy that could have been prevented had the breaches in the enclosure been repaired.

 Zoo officials found the mauled bodies of the antelopes during routine rounds. Eager to cover up the deaths, the officials immediately shifted the carcasses to the veterinary hospital inside the zoo and barred the entry of all journalists to the hospital. 

 Zoo director S.K. Sinha said the exact cause of death would be known after the post-mortem. We will let you know about the cause of death after the post-mortem is over, said Sinha. 

 Asked how dogs could enter the secured antelope enclosure, Sinha remained mum. Other zoo officials also could not offer any explanation as to how the dogs jumped across the five-feet wide moat.

 Established 45 years ago, Nandankanan, famous for its tigers, is considered one of the countrys premier zoos. But it has suffered from decades of cover-ups, mismanagement and apathy and has earlier been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. 

 The zoo had shot to infamy in July 2000, when 12 adult Royal Bengal tigers, seven of them of the rare white species, died of disease. 

 In 1999, a tiger escaped from its enclosure and mauled a couple of tourists and the zoo priest.

 The same year, an inebriated tourist was severely injured while trying to enter a tiger enclosures.

 Wildlife activists allege that the zoo is run on tight budgets, resulting in food-shortages for animals.

 Nearly 50 acres of the zoos area has been illegally encroached. Moreover, boundary walls are missing in some stretches, allowing poachers to have a field day.

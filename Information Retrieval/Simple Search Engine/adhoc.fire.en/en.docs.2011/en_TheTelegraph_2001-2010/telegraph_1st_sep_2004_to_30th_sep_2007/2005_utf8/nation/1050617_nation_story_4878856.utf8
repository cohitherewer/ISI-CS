 Traffic-stopper YSR gets rap

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 16: A march led by the chief minister and central Congress leaders has drawn the high courts censure for choking city traffic and making thousands of schoolchildren and office-goers suffer.

 Yesterdays Congress-sponsored Gandhi Sandesh Shanti Yatra had featured Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, his cabinet colleagues, All India Congress Committee emissaries Margaret Alva, Oscar Fernandes and Mukul Wasnik as well as state party chief K. Keshav Rao.

 Schoolbuses were stopped and ambulances made to wait as police created space for the VIP marchers who covered an 8-km stretch in the heart of the city between 10 am and noon.

 Today, the acting chief justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court, Bilal Nazki, summoned additional police commissioner (traffic) A.K. Khan to court and asked him why the march had been allowed on a working day.

 Besides, why was the procession not given a different route if it was a must and even if it belonged to a ruling party? the judge wanted to know.

 The officer explained that the police had given permission for a 90-minute march from 8 am. But the procession got delayed and started only around 10 am.

 One reason for the delay was the chief ministers preoccupations, Congress sources said. A second reason was the delayed arrival of the AICC leaders flight from Delhi.

 The police officer told the court that since the chief minister and the state Congress president were on the Maoist guerrillas hit list, security had to be extremely strict while they spent two hours on the streets.

 Special police teams were placed over each highrise and a wall of almost 100 men, in plain clothes and in uniform, was created around the VVIPs, he said.

 This is the second time that the Congress government has been rapped by the high court over party leaders programmes obstructing traffic in Hyderabad.

 In December last year, legislator P. Janardhan Reddy had staged a dharna before the power utility building for over four hours, throwing traffic into chaos for the entire day.

 The court had then asked the administration to allow marches and rallies only in specified areas away from the heart of the city.

 It has become a habit for the Congress to hold the citizens to ransom, said TDP spokesperson K. Srihari. On May 14, when the ruling party held its anniversary celebrations, almost 50,000 vehicles brought lakhs of people into the city without the authorities permission.

 Yesterdays march started at Public Garden, passed through the busy commercial districts of Abids, Siddiambar Bazar, Begum Bazar and Afzal Gunj and ended at Charminar. It was the last leg of a campaign flagged off on April 22 by the late Sunil Dutt, then Union sports minister.

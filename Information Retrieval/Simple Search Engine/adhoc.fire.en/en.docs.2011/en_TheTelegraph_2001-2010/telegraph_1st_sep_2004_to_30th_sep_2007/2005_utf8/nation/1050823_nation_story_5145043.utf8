 Two firsts in Bihar poll case

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The Supreme Court today fixed September 6 for hearing a batch of two petitions seeking to restrain the Election Commission from issuing notification for polls in Bihar and for summoning governor Buta Singh.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti, and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyan said a five-judge Constitution bench will hear the case for revival of the Assembly and the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of its dissolution later on September 29.

 Two precedents might be set. First, the poll panel would be restrained from announcing and notifying elections in a state and second, a governor would be summoned through notices to answer the legal mala fides in the dissolution of the Assembly.

 Six NDA legislators, including a breakaway Lok Janshakti Party member of the dissolved Assembly, have challenged the dissolution and an Independent MLA, Purnima Yadav, and advocate Viplava Sharma sought summoning of the governor and a stay on the poll panel from notifying polls through two petitions. 

 Former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee argued for the LJP legislator that his petitions also sought notices to the governor as the legal mala fides resulting in the unconstitutional action of dissolution of the Assembly was certainly a question perfectly within the ambit of a court of law to examine.

 But Lahoti said: We are of the opinion that there is a constitutional bar in issuing notices to a governor.? His actions are liable for examination and could be struck down if inconsistent with the constitutional provisions but... summoning him... we feel there is a bar.? However, if you could make out a case, we will see whether this court can issue him notices. 

 The Centre, led by additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanyan and attorney-general Milon Banerjee, contended that no case was made out by MLAs of the dissolved Assembly and the petitioners.

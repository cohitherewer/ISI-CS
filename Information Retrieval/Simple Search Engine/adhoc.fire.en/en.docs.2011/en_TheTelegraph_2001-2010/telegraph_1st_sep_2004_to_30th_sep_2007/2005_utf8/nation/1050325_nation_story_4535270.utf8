 Gun in House

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, March 24: The Jammu and Kashmir government conceded today that a minister attended the Assembly with a pistol because of ?security threats? and promised that no one would be allowed to do so in future.

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed rose to the defence of junior power minister Javed Mustafa Mir, whose father and a brother were killed by militants. Mir was facing security threats because of these incidents, Mufti said.

 However, National Conference leader Iftikar Hussain Ansari, who had survived two assassination attempts, demanded to know if all the MLAs should carry weapons in the House as ?all of us are under threat?. Mufti replied no one would be allowed to bring in any weapon.

 The issue was highlighted by a newspaper. 

 Although the newspaper did not refer to anybody in particular, Mufti himself named Mir while defending the minister, who had recently shot himself in his right foot.

 Speaker Tara Chand also took a strong note of the reports and concerns of the members and ruled that no member would be permitted to come with any weapon to the House.

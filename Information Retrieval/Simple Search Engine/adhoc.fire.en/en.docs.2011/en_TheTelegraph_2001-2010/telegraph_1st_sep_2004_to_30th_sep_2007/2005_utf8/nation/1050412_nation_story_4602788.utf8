 Suspension stick for IISc police

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, April 11: An embarrassed Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh today hinted on suspending some police officials for the lapse in security at the Indian Institute of Science campus during the visit of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.

 Yesterday, when the Chinese Premier was in discussion with top scientists of the institute on its premises, a Tibetan refugee, Tenzing Tsundue, climbed a tower of the building and raised slogans against China and Wen for 20 minutes. The Premier was on the ground floor at the time. 

 Tenzing hurled pamphlets, waved a Tibetan flag and unfurled a ?Free Tibet? banner from the balcony of the tower. He was later arrested for trespass and violation of prohibitory orders. 

 Official sources said the chief minister hauled up the top brass of the city police at a meeting this morning.

 The suspension orders will come soon on the report of K.R. Srinivasan, DGP, Corps of Detectives. Srinivasan has been instructed to complete the probe in three days.

 CBI probe call into mill deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 22: Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam wants a CBI probe into the sale of one of the National Textile Corporation plots that Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshis son and Raj Thackeray have bought. 

 The sale has already run into trouble with Bombay High Court terming the deal, along with the sale of four other mill plots, illegal. 

 Nirupams demand comes a few days after the ruling, which has put a question mark on the fate of the deals that had netted an estimated Rs 2,020 crore for the cash-strapped National Textile Corporation. 

 Raj, Shiv Sena patriarch Bal Thackerays nephew, and Unmesh, Joshis son, bought the five-acre plot of Kohinoor Mill No. 3 for a staggering Rs 421 crore. 

 My demand is that the government should hand over the investigation to the CBI to find out which companies pumped in the money into the Kohinoor deal. The Income-Tax department is already probing at least two firms that funded the deal ? the IL amp;FS and Madhukon in Hyderabad. The whole exercise should be handed over to the CBI to get to the bottom of this, Nirupam, who switched from the Sena to the Congress, said. 

 He would formally demand a probe in a letter to finance minister P. Chidambaram, the Congress leader added.

 Reacting sharply to Nirupams words, Joshi denied that black money had been funnelled in for the sale. He threatened to file a defamation case against Nirupam. The funds for this transaction have been raised from nationalised banks and private investors, he said, adding that textile minister Shankersinh Vaghela had given the sale a clean chit.

 Yesterday, Thackeray put his weight behind the deal and said he had extracted a promise from Raj that no non-Maharashtrian would be sold a flat in the housing project on the plot.

 Tickle taste buds for truce

New Delhi, July 17: Somnath Chatterjee is banking on MPs stomachs to find a way to their hearts.

 The Lok Sabha Speaker has lined up several lunches and dinners for the Opposition and ruling party leaders as well as those supporting the United Progressive Alliance from outside. The motive: a smooth monsoon session, beginning July 25.

 Since he took charge as Speaker, 

 Chatterjee has been holding such meetings to sort out contentious 

 issues.

 The first lunch will be hosted for BJP leaders on July 20. The invitees include former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, BJP leader L.K. Advani and deputy leader in the House V.K. Malhotra, sources said.

 Two days later, it will be the turn of UPA leaders ? excluding Congress MPs ? such as Laloo Prasad Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan, Sharad Pawar and members of the DMK, PMK, Telengana Rashtra Samiti and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.

 The same day, Chatterjee will meet the non-BJP NDA leaders over dinner. George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar will join leaders of the Shiv Sena, Akali Dal and the Biju Janata Dal. Advani will also be present at this meeting.

 On July 23, parties supporting the UPA from outside such as the CPM, CPI, RSP, Forward Bloc, BSP and the Samajwadi Party will be at the Speakers table for lunch.

 For dinner that night, Chatterjee has sought the company of Congress leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. The final lunch is on July 24, when Chatterjee has convened his customary all-party meeting on the eve of the session.

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Junichi Kodama, a Japanese correspondent in the capital, sported a baffled smile. ?How have so many ordinary Pakistanis been allowed into Hyderabad House by the Indian foreign minister?? he kept asking while shaking his head in disbelief. 

 K. Natwar Singh was too busy to answer. He was getting mobbed by 300-odd Pakistanis who wanted to shake his hand and get pictures with him.

 ?One more photo Sir, the shutter of my camera got stuck last time,? some one pleaded. Resplendent in his fur cap, Natwar Singh obliged everyone. Some from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir raised slogans, ?India-Pakistan dosti zindabad (Long live India-Pakistan friendship)!?

 Singh had decided to host a reception for the delegates to the seventh convention of the Pakistan-India People?s Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD) at Hyderabad House ? a venue normally reserved for visiting heads of state. 

 This was no elite gathering. There were people from Chitral bordering onto Afghanistan, from Khairpur, Sukkur, Jacobabad, Peshawar and various small towns and cities. They were farmers, NGO workers, students, teachers, journalists, human rights activists and ordinary housewives. And for them, Natwar Singh was the star of the show.

 They deserved a special treat after deliberating ways of strengthening the friendship between the two countries for two days. Natwar Singh had organised it for them at the best venue in the capital.

 ?Sir, we have only got a one week?s visa for Delhi. Can you please extend our visas and allow us to go to Agra, Jaipur and Ajmer?? The external affairs minister nodded. 

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran and Arun Singh, joint secretary looking after Pakistan, smiled and the wheels of bureaucracy started whirring into action. Lists with passport details were handed over to them by Tapan Bose, secretary-general of PIPFPD. Both Arun Singh and Bose were being mobbed by visa seekers and were directing people to each other.

 ?Can you help me go to Allahabad and offer prayers at my grandfather?s mazar (grave)? Both I and my father in Karachi would be ever grateful to you,? Owaisuddin Ahmed, a Karachi-resident and activist of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, told Arun Singh. ?Can I go to Bhopal to visit my relatives?? Nafees Ghaznavi, director of Amnesty International, Pakistan, asked. The answer was in the affirmative for everyone.

 ?I am so pleased to see you. How is your father Dr Mohammad Sarwar?? Zia-ul-Haq, a octogenarian journalist from Allahabad, asked Beena Sarwar, senior editor of The News in Pakistan. Zia-ul-Haq and Dr Mohammad Sarwar had been together in the All India Students? Federation in Allahabad before Partition. 

 ?Arrey bhai, chai do jaldi se (Brother, give me a cup of tea quickly) Farida Khannum is coughing,? a woman urged one of the waiters. ?Arre kya khila diya jo gale mein atak gaya (What have you fed her that she is choking)?? someone asked guffawing. 

 ?Take care of her throat as Faridaji has to come back to Delhi in a month?s time,? someone else said loudly. The Pakistani singer had enthralled everyone at Mavalankar Hall last night and got a standing ovation after she sang ?Aaz jaane ki zid na karo. Yoon hi pehlu mein baithe raho (Don?t insist on leaving today; keep sitting by my side).?

 ?Sir, can you please say a few words to all of us?? a Pakistani woman from Punjab asked. ?Where is the need to say anything? You people are saying everything,? Natwar Singh answered disarmingly.

 ?How is all this possible?? asked Kodama, still smiling in disbelief. No one answered him.

 Delhi in VIP witness chase

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Centre is taking decisive action, three years after Nitish Katara was murdered in February 2002, to ensure that the London-based prime witness in the case and Rajya Sabha MP D.P. Yadav?s daughter, Bharti, deposes before a Delhi court.

 Nitish, the son of a joint secretary in the Union shipping ministry, had gone missing from a ceremony to celebrate the wedding of a classmate that he and Bharti had attended.

 Nitish and Bharti had been classmates at the Institute of Management Technology in Ghaziabad in 1998-2000.

 Nitish?s charred body was later recovered from Dadri in Uttar Pradesh.

 Police and the Kataras have claimed that the two were good friends and were even planning to marry.

 Soon after the murder, Bharti had left for London for studies. She has consistently expressed inability to give evidence in the case despite repeated summons and warrants from the trial court for more than a year. Her brother Vikas and cousin Vishal are the main accused in the case.

 In January, Bharti informed the prosecution that she was unwilling to give evidence.

 Now, Union home secretary Dhirendra Singh has requested foreign secretary Shyam Saran to step in and ensure that the Indian high commission in the UK makes all efforts to serve the warrants on Bharti.

 ?The case has attracted considerable amount of attention of the general public,? the home secretary wrote in his December 23, 2004, letter.

 ?There are influential personalities involved. However, it is our duty to ensure that justice is done. The victim?s family rightfully believes that we have not done enough. We need to bring these facts to the notice of the high commission of India in London, so that it can take up the matter with the United Kingdom authorities in an appropriate manner,? Singh told Saran.

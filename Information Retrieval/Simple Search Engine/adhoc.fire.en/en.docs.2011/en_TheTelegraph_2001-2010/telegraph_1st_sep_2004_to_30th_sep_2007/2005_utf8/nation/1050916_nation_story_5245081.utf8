 Babri blow to Advani

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The CBI now wants to try L.K. Advani and seven other saffron leaders in the same court and under the same chargesheet with ordinary kar sevaks in the Babri demolition case.

 The bureau, which sought this directive from the Supreme Court today, said that, contrary to widespread belief, the charge of criminal conspiracy against the eight had never been dropped.

 Currently, Advani, Uma Bharti, M.M. Joshi, Vinay Katiyar (all BJP), Acharya Giriraj Kishore, Vishnu Hari Dalmiya, Ashok Singhal and Sadhvi Ritambhara are being tried in a Rae Bareli court while proceedings against the other accused are on at a Lucknow court.

 The Rae Bareli court was set up in late 2002 by the then pro-BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, headed by Mayavati. Political opponents suspected that a separate trial ? under a separate chargesheet ? meant the leaders might get off lightly.

 The CBI had then supported the decision. Its plea today for a joint trial under a consolidated chargesheet is an about-turn that reflects the changed political situation. The hearing is on September 19.

 The bureaus plea comes in response to a petition filed by Mohammad Aslam alias Bhure seeking a review of the apex courts November 2002 order upholding separate trials. The Supreme Court had issued notices to the CBI and the eight high-profile accused on this petition in September 2003.

 The Supreme Court had also issued notices to them on another petition, by advocate M. Shukla, challenging the alleged dropping of the criminal conspiracy charge against the eight. Bhure, too, filed a similar application in the supplementary chargesheet.

 Days after these notices were issued, the Rae Bareli court acquitted Advani on September 19, 2003, citing contradictory witness accounts of his role. It ordered charges to be framed against the seven other accused. Advanis acquittal was, however, squashed by Allahabad High Court on July 6 this year.

 The CBI responded to the two-year-old notices today, denying that the charge of criminal conspiracy had been dropped. It said the Rae Bareli court was seized of the matter. It also said that since the cases in the Lucknow and Rae Bareli courts arise from the same incident, they should be tried together at Lucknow.

 The cases against the leaders and the ordinary kar sevaks had taken different paths right at the outset ? beginning with two FIRs.

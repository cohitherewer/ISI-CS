 Canal caught in poster war

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Madurai, July 3: Doomed to fail, screamed one.

 Extravagant, said another, one of the hundreds pasted by local ADMK workers slamming yesterdays inauguration of the Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The architect, hailed a third, with a picture of MDMK leader Vaiko.

 A poster war, not just between arch political rivals but allies as well, marked the run-up to the opening of the project, which will dredge a direct route between Indias east and west coasts, so that ships do not have to take a detour around Sri Lanka.

 The ruling ADMKs posters questioned the need for such a big show to kickstart a project doomed to fail.

 Tamil Nadu has not received Cauvery waters and Madurai no industrial investment worth the name; is such a big show necessary for kick-starting this canal project? a poster questioned.

 Another set put up by the ruling party asked the DMK to quit the Congress-led coalition at the Centre.

 On the other side of the political divide, state Congress chief G.K. Vasan has come out with posters greeting the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi, the chairperson of the central coalition, for inaugurating the over Rs 2,000-crore project. 

 But the DMK has been left wondering why the MDMK, an ally, was trying to take credit for the work by hailing party leader Vaiko as the architect of the project to deepen the Palk Strait.

 Posters put up by the DMK have glorified party chief M. Karunanidhi as the personification of Sethusamudram itself.

 What has added to the DMKs discomfiture is, in some of the posters, Vaiko has also been projected as the future hope of the Tamils and as the heartbeat of Tamil Nadu.

 At many places, bamboo frames displaying a smiling Vaikos full-size picture have been tied to poles from which DMK flags flutter in the breeze.

 If this has baffled the DMK, the party is also embarrassed that one of its MPs, Bhavani Rajendran, who represents Ramanathapuram, has gone to the media for being denied an official invite to the inaugural function.

 The people of Ramanathapuram have been cheated, she said. A major part of the dredging work will be along the Ramanathapuram coast.

 The invitation printed by the Sethusamudram Corporation Limited, formed to implement the project along with the Tuticorin Port Trust, does not even mention her though the name of P. Mohan, the CPM MP from Madurai, finds a place in the invite.

 Accused denied bail in Nitish Katara case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: A Delhi court today rejected the bail of Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav in the Nitish Katara murder case.

 Vikas and Vishal are the son and the nephew of D.P. Yadav, former Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh.

 Nitish, the son of a senior IAS officer and classmate of D.P. Yadav?s daughter Bharti, was allegedly abducted and murdered on the intervening night of February 16 and 17, 2002, in Ghaziabad, where he had gone to attend a marriage of a classmate. His half-burnt body was later found in Khurja in Uttar Pradesh.

 Vikas, who was out on bail in the Jessica Lal murder case, and his cousin Vishal were arrested in Dabra in connection with the murder. Vikas had contested Assembly elections but was defeated.

 Additional sessions judge D.S. Paweriya rejected the bail, observing that there was evidence against the accused. This is significant as the two had sought bail after turnarounds by some witnesses and the court?s recent move to drop Bharti as key witness. 

 Bharti?s testimony was significant, for, according to police, her alleged relationship with Nitish was the reason behind the murder.

 The police had named her the key witness and made all possible efforts to call her back from the UK, where she is studying, to appear before the court. She was dropped as witness on March 30 following the UK?s refusal to execute a non-bailable warrant against her.

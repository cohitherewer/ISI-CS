 Widow plea

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 4: A widow who survived a 13-year labour ban on her farm and an attempt on her life has petitioned the government and Opposition to help her secure a licensed revolver.

 Vineeta R. Kottayi, who arrived here from her home district of Kozhikode, armed with the memorandum and accompanied by volunteers of the NGO, Janapaksham, staged a sit-in at the secretariat.

 A model of a gun was kept in front. Placards requested contributions from people to help her buy the firearm as the custodians of law had failed to ensure her safety. 

 Vineeta was in hospital following an alleged murder bid on her by pro-CPM Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilaly Union workers on May 20.

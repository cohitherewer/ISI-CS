 Uma bites Bihar bait 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 19: After rejecting her demand to remove chief minister Babulal Gaur in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership has now got Uma Bharti to agree to campaign in Bihar.

 The former chief minister has been handed a sop: the party would consider her demand for a change of guard in Madhya Pradesh after the Bihar Assembly polls are over.

 The compromise formula was worked out by party veteran Kailash Joshi in consultation with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Jaswant Singh and Uma. Holding out the hope of Gaurs possible removal in mid-November, the party got Uma to promise not to trigger a crisis in Madhya Pradesh and return to campaigning in Bihar.

 The central leadership, however, rejected Umas key demand that they set a date for Gaurs ouster.

 In New Delhi, party general secretary and spokesman Arun Jaitley made it clear that no guarantee has been given about Gaurs removal even after the Bihar elections.

 All they (the Uma camp) were told is that any issue that had to be raised will be so in the BJPs internal forums and they will not be raised when we are in poll mode, Jaitley told reporters.

 The Uma camp has abandoned a plan to get dissident ministers and MLAs to tender mass resignation and lay siege to the BJP office and state secretariat in Bhopal.

 Sources said Uma was personally against giving Gaur even a temporary reprieve, but yielded when she realised that most of her supporters were wary of defying the central leadership. 

 In the morning, about 30 MLAs and two state ministers met at Umas residence. Within minutes, she could sense that her supporters preferred a peaceful settlement to a confrontation. 

 The Uma camp attributes this shift in mood to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs informal advice to the MLAs not to defy the party leadership. Most of the 173 BJP MLAs in the state have a Sangh background.

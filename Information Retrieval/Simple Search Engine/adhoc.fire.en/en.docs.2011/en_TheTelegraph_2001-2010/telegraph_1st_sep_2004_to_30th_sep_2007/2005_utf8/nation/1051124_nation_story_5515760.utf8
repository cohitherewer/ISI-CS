New Delhi, Nov. 23: With Sushil Modi being picked to be legislature party leader and deputy chief minister of Bihar, the struggle in the BJP to keep disgruntled aspirants in check has just begun.

 Shahnawaz Hussain, who was also in the running, has reportedly been promised a Rajya Sabha seat as consolation but there are others deeply wounded by Modis election.

 Hussain, the lone BJP leader who campaigned alongside Janata Dal (United) allies Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav, was desperately hoping to clinch the deputy chief ministers post.

 The party general secretary in charge of Bihar, Arun Jaitley, had recently said in Patna that Hussain was among the alliances most popular campaigners. He and Sharad Yadav form our M/Y (Muslim/Yadav) team, he said.

 But Jaitley was known to favour Modi over the rest and has installed him in the post coveted by almost all top leaders in the Bihar unit. We knew it was always going to be Modi because he was favoured by Jaitleyji, said one.

 Former health minister C.P. Thakur, who has a base among Bhumihars and campaigned hard, was another aspirant whose potential to cause trouble for the local unit cannot be ignored. The BJP gave his son Vivek a ticket from Barhampur but he lost. The father-son duo is said to be blaming people within the state unit for the defeat.

 Wounded by his sons defeat, Thakur, who claims credit for consolidating upper-caste ? particularly Bhumihar ? votes, is also upset over reports of Hussain being offered a Rajya Sabha seat. He sounded disheartened when contacted. Modiji has our support. We are loyal workers of the party. We will always work for the party, Thakur said almost tearfully.

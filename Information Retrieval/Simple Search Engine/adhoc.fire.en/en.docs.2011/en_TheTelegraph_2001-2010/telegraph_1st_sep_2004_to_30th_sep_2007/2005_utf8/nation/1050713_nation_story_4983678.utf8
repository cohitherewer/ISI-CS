 George support

 New Delhi, July 12: NDA convener George Fernandes rose to defend L.K. Advani against the RSS by advising the Sangh to steer clear of politics and stick to socio-cultural activities, reports our special correspondent.

 In a statement issued today, Fernandes said recent developments in the BJP and the RSS had caused deep concern and unease among the NDA allies. 

 Accusing the RSS of abrogating to itself a political role, he said: In ordinary circumstances, I would not have commented on the RSS. However, in the extraordinary situation that seems to have developed in the main Opposition party and driven primarily by my concerns for the NDA, I urge the RSS to confine itself to its socio-cultural activities.

 I strongly object to the RSS abrogating to itself a political role. This clear separation of roles is necessary to promote healthy democratic traditions in India.

 The Sangh did not take kindly to Fernandess suggestion. Its spokesperson Ram Madhav said: It is advisable for people to refrain from interfering in the Sanghs internal matters and that of its ideological fraternity.

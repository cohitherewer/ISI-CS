New Delhi, April 20: Come Monday, Lok Sabha members will not be allowed to raise trivial issues or take up topics out of turn during zero hour. To ensure the quality of debate, members will be allowed to raise only 10 items during zero hour between 11 am and 12 noon.

 A decision to this effect was taken at an all-party meeting convened by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today.

 Concerned over the casual approach of some parliamentarians and their preoccupation with ?frivolous? issues, Chatterjee said leaders of political parties should ask their members to stick to matters of national and international importance during zero hour.

 He said that since there was not much time, it was necessary to regulate zero hour so that only relevant issues are raised.

 Sources said the Speaker himself can use his discretionary powers to decide which of the issues are important enough to be raised. Any member wanting to ask a question during zero hour has to give a notice to the Lok Sabha secretariat by 9.30 am. 

 The Lok Sabha Speaker also took the government to task for not responding to issues and questions raised by members under rule 377. 

 Ministers must reply to the queries within a month, with a copy to the Lok Sabha secretariat, Chatterjee said.

 Among those who attended the all-party meeting were minister for parliamentary affairs Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress, K. Yerran Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, Devendra Prasad Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Ramjilal Suman of the Samajwadi Party and Anant Geete of the Shiv Sena.

 Rahul queue gets longer

 Rahul: Second power centre?

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: At 10 Janpath, perhaps, he is still too much his mamas son. So, as Rahul Gandhi begins to step out of his mothers shadow, 12 Tughlak Lane is gradually gathering the look of a second power centre.

 About five months ago, Rahul had conducted a quiet house-warming at the bungalow, though he hasnt moved out of 10 Janpath. The new bungalow happens to be his official residence-cum-office as the Amethi MP.

 With the exception of partymen from Amethi, the new address had seemed to matter little to most Congressmen.

 All that has changed after the Prime Minister surprised everyone by taking Rahul along to Afghanistan last weekend. The rank and file and the partys regional satraps seem convinced that the Rahul era may come earlier than they had reckoned.

 Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh today became the first party chief minister to meet Rahul at 12 Tughlak Lane. To all appearances, his objective was to invite Rahul to his son Ajays wedding reception in Bangalore on Sunday. Singh, however, had already met both Sonia and Rahul at 10 Janpath and invited them.

 The chief minister, who had sought an appointment with Rahul yesterday, delayed his return to Bangalore to be able to meet him.

 Sources said Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, too, had sought a meeting with Rahul recently, but could not be accommodated.

 The lengthening queue before 12 Tughlak Lane features several Congress ministers from the states, looking to invite him to official programmes.

 Then there are those desperate to be seen as close to Rahul or a Rahul confidant. A Rajya Sabha MP was recently seen trying to impress his colleagues by showing them Rahuls SMS messages to him.

 Many All India Congress Committee managers are trying to arrange an election for the party working committee at next months plenary. The reason is that it will enable Rahul to become an elected member of the partys highest executive body.

 Mumbai Congress chief Gurudas Kamat, however, says all working committee members should be nominated by Sonia and Rahul should be one of them. He should also be a general secretary.

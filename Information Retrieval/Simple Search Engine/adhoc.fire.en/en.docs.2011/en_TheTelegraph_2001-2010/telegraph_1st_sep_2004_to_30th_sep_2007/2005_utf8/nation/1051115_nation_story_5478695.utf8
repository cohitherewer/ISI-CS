 Srinagar, Nov. 14: Two schools had just closed in Srinagars city centre, with children pouring on to the streets crowded with shoppers, vendors and commuters, when the grenade went off and gunfire began crackling.

 Kashmirs latest militant strike came at high-security Lal Chowk this afternoon, leaving two civilians and two paramilitary troopers dead and 14, including a Japanese photojournalist, wounded. None of the students of Tyndale Biscoe Boys High School and Mallinson Girls High School, however, were injured.

 Police said the militants threw a grenade at a bullet-proof mobile bunker of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and began firing from their automatic weapons before disappearing into two local hotels around 4.15 pm. Troops had ringed the hotel tonight, waiting for daybreak to mount an operation.

 Drivers left their cars in the middle of the road to run for cover, creating a traffic tangle through which anxious parents threaded their way to the two schools to collect their children.

 A man who introduced himself as Abu Osama, spokesman for the Al-Mansoorain militant group, called a local news agency to claim responsibility. He said four members of the groups suicide squad had carried out the attack. 

 We have surrounded the Punjab and Peak View hotels in Lal Chowk from inside which the holed-up militants are now firing at the surrounding troops, a CRPF official said. 

 Police sources said six civilians, believed to be hotel staff, are trapped inside Peak View.

 Our first priority is to safely rescue the trapped civilians. We have further strengthened the cordon around Lal Chowk area, a CRPF spokesman said.

 Reinforcements have been sent to the spot and people evacuated from the shops, hotels and offices.

 A tight cordon has been thrown around the two hotels and we have installed floodlights. The operation will be resumed with the first light tomorrow morning, a senior CRPF officer said.

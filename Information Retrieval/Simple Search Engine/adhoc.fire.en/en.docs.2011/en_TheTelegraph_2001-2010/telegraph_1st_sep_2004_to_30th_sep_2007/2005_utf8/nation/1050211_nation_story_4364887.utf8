 Pak Test pitch attacked

 - Damage buzz after vandals storm Mohali ground

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Bindra: Praise for staff

 Mohali, Feb. 10: Shouting slogans in favour of the Shiv Sena, vandals invaded the sprawling Punjab Cricket Association stadium this evening and tried to damage the pitch using iron rods and spades.

 The Pakistan cricket team will play a Test here, beginning March 4.

 Stadium sources said the vandals managed to scale at least five gates before entering the square and beginning to dig.

 Six of them were arrested after the watch and ward staff alerted police who rushed mobile patrol vans to the stadium, but at least four fled.

 The Chandigarh chief of the Shiv Sena, Varinder Bajaj, denied the party?s involvement in the attack. ?The Shiv Sena is a disciplined party. They cannot be our men as we always follow directions from Bal Thackeray. This time there have been no directives to destroy or damage the Mohali or any other pitch on which the Pakistan team would be playing,? he said.

 Association chief I.S. Bindra claimed that no damage was done to the pitch. ?A lot could have happened had it not been for the alert staff in the stadium,? he added, but declined the media access to the ground.

 Journalists who sought access to the pitch were crudely told that since the venue was to host a Test match soon, no one other than stadium officials could be allowed in.

 ?It is also raining. We cannot allow anyone inside. Walking on wet ground can destroy the carpet and the square,? explained Brig (retd) G.S. Sandhu, the CEO of the association.

 The lights at the stadium were also switched off. Curator Daljeet Singh, who declined to speak, paced up and down the office area on the first floor with a pensive look.

 Association staff who were approached for witness accounts were shooed away by senior officials. One was even threatened with losing his job.

 The little information that could be gathered revealed that the vandals had caused some damage to the pitch. ?About five to seven persons wearing white clothes and saffron bandanas rushed into the playing area and began digging. But the police came immediately,? a witness said.

 While six of the activists were overpowered by the stadium security staff, at least four escaped. Those arrested were being interrogated by Mohali police who have registered cases of trespassing and vandalism. 

 The stadium has been handed to the police for security. A cordon of over 100 policemen has been thrown around the venue. Vehicles plying nearby are also being checked.

 Police sources said those arrested did not belong to Punjab. 

 Pak refuses to budge

 Chances of Pakistan playing in Ahmedabad diminished further today with the foreign ministry saying its security concerns over the venue still remained, PTI reports from Islamabad.

 ?Our security concern on Ahmedabad remains and there is no change in our perception,? foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said. His comments came close on the heels of cricket board chairman Shaharyar Khan?s talks with foreign ministry officials to discuss the tour.

 New Delhi, May 30: The BJP today made a swift move in poll-bound Bihar by appointing Sushil Kumar Modi the state party president.

 Modi, the MP from Bhagalpur, was a national vice-president in the BJP. His elevation comes just days after the appointment of Uma Bharti as deputy in-charge for the elections in Bihar. BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley will be the in-charge. 

 To effect a good caste mix, BJP president L.K. Advani also appointed former Union minister C.P. Thakur chairman of the states election campaign committee. While Modi and Bharti belong to backward castes, Thakur is an upper-caste Bhumihar. 

 Modi said his aim was to get a two-third majority for the NDA. My focus will be on having better co-ordination with the Janata Dal (United) and other allies and see that if anything was lacking during the last Assembly polls, it is corrected this time, he said.

 The UPA, particularly the RJD, Lok Janshakti Party and the Congress, will have to suffer for the injustice it has done to the state by dissolving the Assembly when the NDA government was being formed.

 Modi, who has been leading a sustained campaign against Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, said the dissolution of the Assembly will be one of the main campaign planks of the NDA. Our prime objective is to finally get Bihar rid of the direct and proxy rule of RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav.

 If the BJP has made a quick move, Laloo Prasad is not sitting quiet either. 

 The RJD chief asked the two-member Election Commission team that visited Bihar not to rush into elections. Let them hold the polls whenever they (the Election Commission) want. We are ready, Laloo Prasad said though he hastened to add that he did not favour elections in July. 

 We dont know about the flood situation in the state after rainy season, he said, adding, in the same breath, that we have fought several elections in rainy seasons.

 The two-member team returned to Delhi last night from Bihar after assessing the states poll preparedness. 

 Laloo Prasad said his party had told the poll panel that photo identity cards should be issued to those who are yet to get them and the voters lists revised. The RJD chief also requested the commission to create revenue villages to facilitate weaker sections to vote as they have been allegedly deprived by the affluent rich from exercising their franchise freely.

 Another suggestion that Laloo Prasad made related to electronic voting machines and the voting process. The railway minister said a voter takes at least three minutes to vote and 1,500 voters a booth meant denial of voting rights to a large number of people in the last hours. 

 These corrective measures should be completed before finalising the dates for the polls, Laloo Prasad said.

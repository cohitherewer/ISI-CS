 Dhaka pipeline talks

 FARID HOSSAIN

 Dhaka, May 24: A Dhaka-based company has started negotiations to put together an international consortium to finance a $974-million pipeline to supply natural gas from Myanmar to India through Bangladesh, a top official said today.

 We have started negotiations with public and private investors to set up an international consortium to build, own and operate the proposed pipeline. But I cant give you details, said K.B. Ahmed, managing director of Mohona Holdings Ltd, which initiated the tri-nation project in 1997.

 The proposed consortium will build, own and operate the 897-km pipeline ? 289 km will be through Bangladesh ? Ahmed told a news conference. The energy ministers of India, Bangladesh and Myanmar discussed the proposed pipeline and decided in principle that it will be built, owned and operated by an international consortium, he said. 

 Without giving details of the talks, he said the three countries are soon expected sign a memorandum of understanding on the consortium.

 Proposed to be based in a neutral country in the Far East, the consortium will buy gas from Myanmar to sell it to India. The two countries want Bangladesh to host a part of the pipeline, Ahmed said. Dhaka has agreed in principle but has set some conditions.

 Two routes are being discussed. One is through Arakan-Mizoram-Tripura and Bangladesh before crossing the Jamuna river into Bongaon in Bengal. The second enters Bangladesh at Teknaf and runs through Feni and Brahmmanbari before crossing the Jamuna into Bengal.

 Bangladesh can get foreign investment of $300-$600 million to construct the pipeline and then earn an annual revenue of $100 million for wheeling charges, depending on the volume of gas to be supplied, Ahmed said. It might receive another $24 million a year for pipeline services. 

 Ahmed said his company first convinced Myanmar and India to strike the deal and then persuaded Bangladesh to get involved in the talks.

 Bangladesh, however, wants to get more out of the deal. It would like India to sell the electricity it produces in Bhutan and allow a land corridor for trading with Nepal, sources said. India wants such conditions to be kept outside the pipeline project.

 Navy sails catch winds of diplomacy

 New Delhi, July 17: The Indian Navy will deploy its aircraft carrier overseas for a first series of exercises in Southeast Asia this month and will follow it up with joint exercises on Indias eastern and western seaboards with the US, French and Russian navies.

 The navy is emerging as New Delhis service of choice to implement policies of military diplomacy. An intensification of exercises with the navies of the West off Indias coasts and with those of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia in pursuance of a look-east policy is placing the Indian Navy at the centre of an emerging military diplomatic grid in the Indian Ocean region.

 The exercises come in the wake of the navys rapid deployment to the tsunami-hit countries earlier this year.

 Sources in naval headquarters here said INS Viraat, the navys flagship carrier, INS Rajput and INS Ranjit, two guided missile destroyers, INS Shakti, a replenishment tanker and INS Khukri, an indigenously built missile corvette, will be deployed to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia between July 19 and August 1.

 The carrier group for Southeast Asia will be commanded by Rear Admiral Sanjeev Bhasin, the flag officer commanding the Eastern fleet. The carrier with about 1,600 personnel will be commanded by Captain S.P.S. Cheema and it will carry onboard Sea Harrier fighter aircraft, Seaking helicopters, the indigenously built advanced light helicopter, and Chetak helicopters.

 After the Indian Ocean region deployments, the carrier will engage in the Malabar series and Varuna series of exercises with the US and French navies off the west coast and the Russian Navy off the east coast. The sources said the US and French navies are expected to deploy a compatible force, including carriers and nuclear submarines for the exercises.

 The exercises were being graduated to a higher level. The manoeuvres with the US Navy will involve US P3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft that the Indian Navy is considering for procurement, the navys own Dornier and TU-143 aircraft. For the first time, the India-US exercise will also involve the flying of naval combat aircraft (Sea Harrier from India) and possibly the F/A-18 Superhornet by the US Navy.

 France is likely to use its nuclear-powered carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, for the exercises and vessels from the Indian Ocean base at Djibouti. 

 But before the drill with the French in November, the Indian Navy and the Russian Navy will conduct wargames in the Bay of Bengal that will involve Indias Talwar-class stealth frigates and a Russian Akula class nuclear submarine.

 New Delhi, July 29: The Prime Minister today allayed fears of a sellout to the US, telling Parliament that India will keep its side of the bargain only if the Americans keep theirs.

 Manmohan Singhs statement in both Houses of Parliament sought to counter the criticism from the Left and the Opposition and reassure his own party.

 If the BJP felt the US was far from recognising India as a legitimate and responsible nuclear weapons state despite the agreement signed in Washington, the Left was worried by what it saw as a pro-US shift in Indias foreign policy. The CPM and CPI also wondered if India was jettisoning its nuclear disarmament policy.

 Our commitment to work for universal disarmament, so passionately espoused by Rajiv Gandhi, in the long run will remain our core concern, Singh said.

 He packaged this assurance with a reference to the freedom struggle in an attempt to blunt criticism that his Oxford speech had romanticised colonial rule. 

 All of us? recognise that inspired by our freedom struggle, we have inherited a proud and patriotic tradition.? Our belief gives us conviction to assert today that our nation stands on the threshold of an even better future, Singh declared.

 The joint Indo-US statement, he argued, recognised India as a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology. The pact was based on the principle of non-discrimination, allowing India the same benefits as other nuclear powers, including the US, and imposing the same responsibilities and obligations.

 Our commitments would be conditional upon, and reciprocal to, the US fulfilling its side of this understanding, Singh stressed.

 Nor will India brook any discrimination while voluntarily placing its civilian facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, he said. Delhi will ensure that all restrictions on it are lifted and no attempt is made to curb its autonomy of decision-making.

 The joint statement imposes no limits on the countrys strategic nuclear weapons programme; Indias control over it would continue to be unrestricted, complete and autonomous.

 A discussion on the statement will take place in both Houses on August 3.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cry to crack serial kidnaps

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Feb. 5: Kidnapped and released ? the list is growing longer. 

 Ravikant, a schoolboy abducted a fortnight ago from Biharsharif, returned home today ? the fourth such case in a crucial week of Assembly elections. 

 However, the clamour over the kidnappings and the timely release of the victims ? three children were ?rescued? on Wednesday, a day before the first round of Assembly polls ? continued in political circles. 

 The DAV schoolboy said he was saved by some villagers as his kidnappers were shifting base to escape police.

 But Arun Jaitley wants a clearer picture on the abductions. The BJP election in-charge of the state today demanded that a judicial commission be set up to probe the kidnappings.

 ?After each abduction, we get the same story. The police say their pressure led to the release, the victims say they escaped. Not one real culprit is arrested. The mystery continues. We want a judicial commission, headed by a sitting high court judge, to probe the role of the police and politicians who allegedly patronise the gangs,? Jaitley told a news conference.

 Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, too, wants a probe, but by the CBI.

 Jaitley, however, pooh-poohed both the LJP and the Congress for their ?ambiguous? role and ?double standards? in the elections and the ?strategy to help Laloo indirectly?.

 ?They are out to create confusion among the electorate by opposing the RJD, only to increase their bargaining power against it by playing a vote katwa and creating a hung Assembly,? he said.

 Jaitley said the BJP was the only viable alternative in this scenario. ?It only strengthens our stand? People are not confused, they will vote us to power with a decisive verdict.?

 He said: ?The UPA is already a cracking mirror and the Congress is hardly a player in Bihar. It only makes meaningless speculations to confuse people.? 

 Jaitley, though, is only one of Laloo Prasad Yadav?s problems. The Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Madhepura, Pappu Yadav, who resigned from the party?s parliamentary board two days ago, threatened to resign from the party and abdicate the seat today. He lashed out at his party chief, saying: ?Laloo is under the grip of a family caucus and has lost his senses, and ended up giving tickets to criminals and dalals.? 

 ?My people are with me. I don?t need a ticket from any party to win from here. I?m going to support anyone who wants to contest from here against Laloo,? said Pappu, upset by the denial of tickets to his men in Madhepura, Purnea and Saharsa.

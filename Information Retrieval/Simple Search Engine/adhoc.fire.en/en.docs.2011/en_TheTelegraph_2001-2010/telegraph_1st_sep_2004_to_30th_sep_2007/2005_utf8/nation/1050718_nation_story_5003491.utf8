 Poles meet on migrants

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, July 17: The very issue that kept them apart for 26 years has brought together the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and organisations representing the minorities. 

 In a meeting variously described as historic, decisive and the coming together of the north and south poles, the AASU and a coordination committee of 12 organisations of the minorities discussed the problem of illegal migration to Assam and agreed to work together to find a feasible solution.

 AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya and Hafiz Rashid Choudhury, the general secretary of the Assam unit of the All India Milli Council, told the media that circumstances necessitated their attempt at a rapprochement. But both leaders cautioned people against expecting this first meeting between the two sides in over a quarter of a century to end the impasse.

 The meeting, which began yesterday and continued until this afternoon, surprised most because the Supreme Courts verdict on the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act ? the bone of contention ? had raised fears of a major confrontation.

 The AASU had hailed the courts decision to bury the legislation, while a cluster of minority organisations led by the All Assam Muslim Students Union called a statewide bandh in protest.

 There have always been apprehensions among the minorities about the AASU. But this is an effort by us to remove the misunderstanding and build mutual trust, Choudhury said. 

 The two sides agreed to jointly organise a series of goodwill rallies to allay the fears of the minorities, who had regarded the IM(DT) Act as their only armour against harassment, and evolve a consensus on tackling illegal migration. The rallies will begin in August.

 They also agreed to meet frequently. We may not be able to close the gap completely at this juncture, but we will continue our efforts, Bhattacharyya said. 

 Leaders of the AASU and the minority organisations agreed that migrants who entered the state after March 25, 1971, should be deported, irrespective of their religion, and nobody should provide shelter to anybody without valid citizenship documents. 

 We will tell our people not to encourage any infiltration and that they should report the presence of foreigners to the appropriate authorities, Choudhury said. 

 To prevent fresh influx of illegal migrants, the two sides appealed to the government to complete installation of barbed-wire fencing along the Indo-Bangladesh border within a year.

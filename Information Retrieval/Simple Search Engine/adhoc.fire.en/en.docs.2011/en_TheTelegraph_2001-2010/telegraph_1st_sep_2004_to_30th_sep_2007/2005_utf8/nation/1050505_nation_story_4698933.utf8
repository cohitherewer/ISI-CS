 Deshmukh power 

plea 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 4: Vilasrao Deshmukh has knocked on the Centre?s door to bail his state out of the power crisis.

 The Maharashtra chief minister met Union energy secretary R. Shahi last evening. The Centre has assured Deshmukh that 500 mw of additional power would be made available to ease the load-shedding problem in the state. 

 The chief minister also plans to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow.

 ?The power crisis is not a sudden development. It is a result of the fact that in the last 10 years Maharashtra has added only 400 mw of power if you exclude the Dabhol power project. We had informed the government in September 2004 about the likely shortages,? a highly-placed Maharashtra State Electricity Board official said.

 But the previous Democratic Front government, led by Sushil Kumar Shinde, had ignored the warning and announced free power for farmers ahead of the Assembly elections to win them over.

 When Deshmukh came to power after Shinde, one of the first decisions his cabinet took was to announce plans to go for single-phasing of power. ?But a consumer group challenged the single-phasing programme before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission and it was disallowed,? the official said. 

 However, in March, Deshmukh had rejected the proposal to continue free power supply to the farmers.

 Airport staff threaten strike 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: Strike plans chalked out by airport staff in protest against privatisation of the Delhi and Mumbai airports could see airlines grounded on September 29.

 About 20,000 employees of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) all over the country will participate in the strike at 124 airports, their representatives said. The Left parties are supporting the strike call.

 The engineering, communications, maintenance and ground handling departments are launching the protest under the banner of the Airports Authority Employees Joint Forum.

 However, air traffic control towers would continue to function so that planes flying over India are not affected. 

 The forum today served the strike notice to the AAI management, accusing the government of deviating from its common minimum programme by privatising profit-making state-run companies like the AAI.

 The government wants about 74 per cent equity in the Delhi and Mumbai airports to be sold to private entrepreneurs, including up to 10 per cent to airlines and 49 per cent to foreign stakeholders. Six bidders have submitted applications for the Mumbai airport while five have sent in bids for Delhi.

 Forum members, who staged a protest at the civil aviation ministry headquarters here, demanded that the modernisation and restructuring of the two airports, which together handle 63 per cent of the countrys total air traffic, should be given to AAI. 

 Alternatively, they said, the government could consider awarding the city-side developments to private bidders and leave the air-side functions to the AAI. A blueprint chalked out by AAI puts runways, parking bays, ATCs and security in air-side, leaving malls, passenger entry and baggage handling for city-side.

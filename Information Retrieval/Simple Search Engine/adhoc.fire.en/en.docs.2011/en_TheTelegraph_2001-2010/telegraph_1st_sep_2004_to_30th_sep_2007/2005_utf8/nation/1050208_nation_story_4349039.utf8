 NDA?s man for top job

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Feb. 7: Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi started it, Arun Jaitley gave it an official stamp and then Uma Bharti, travelling in Bihar, fully endorsed the idea. By now, Nitish Kumar has expressed his gratitude over the BJP?s assertion that he will be chief minister if the NDA comes to power in the state.

 BJP sources, however, said the idea had been cooking for quite some time. ?Initially, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee or Lal Krishna Advani were expected to announce Nitish?s name from a public platform during their campaign in Bihar. But that could not happen and Modi himself was made to do the honours,? a BJP source said.

 Modi, arguably the BJP?s tallest leader in the state, has been seen as the party?s ?rightful claimant? to the top job. Nitish had to face embarrassment when he became chief minister for a week in 2000 and resigned before the test of strength because he failed to cobble it up despite feverish efforts.

 When the elections were announced, neither the BJP nor the Janata Dal (United) went public with the names of their chief ministerial candidates. Both parties said it was a ?post-election matter?, which would be decided once they came close to forming the next government.

 At that time, Nitish?s ?offer? to Ram Vilas Paswan to be the chief minister had cut no ice with the Lok Janshakti Party chief, who remained firm on his stance of having no truck with the JD(U) as long as it continued with the ?communal? BJP.

 Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav had also cracked jokes about the ?confusion? in the NDA and the LJP, asserting that there was ?no vacancy? for a chief minister in Bihar so long as Rabri Devi was there.

 Though the JD(U) ? which is contesting 138 seats as compared to the BJP?s 105 (now 103 because two nominations were rejected) ? did not make an official comment on the matter, leaders on both sides have been happy with the announcement.

 ?Nitish, a trained engineer, is seen as a development-oriented leader with a clean record. The former railway minister also has a record of being in the government. Why should anyone object to his name?? asked a JD(U) leader.

 ?We are anyway junior partner to the JD(U) in Bihar. That party has more seats than we do in the Assembly. We hold Nitish in high esteem. Besides, he comes from a leading backward caste of Bihar,? said a BJP leader.

 In announcing Nitish?s name, the NDA has also tried to push its development plank further ?so that people have a clear option of what they are voting for?. ?The good work done by Nitish as a Union minister is known to all. If, at all, people are interested in development, they would find it easy to relate to the JD(U) leader,? he added.

 Incidentally, no contender for the chief minister?s post, except Rabri Devi, is fighting the elections.

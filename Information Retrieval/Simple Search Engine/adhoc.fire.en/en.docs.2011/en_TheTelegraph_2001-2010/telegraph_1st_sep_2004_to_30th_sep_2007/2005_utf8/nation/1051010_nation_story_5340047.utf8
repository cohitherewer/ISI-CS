 Raje sacks to please Sangh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Facing a revolt from senior cabinet colleagues, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje has sought to cosy up to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh by sacking a former favourite who is disliked by the Sangh.

 Chandra Raj Singhvi ? who recently wrote an offensive letter to Sangh chief K.S. Sudarshan ? has been summarily dismissed from the 20-point programme implementation committee through a four-line letter.

 Raje hopes the sacking will please the Sangh enough for it to largely ignore her critics.

 Raje is facing rebellion from education minister Ghanshyam Tiwari and industries minister Narpat Singh Rajvi. Rajvi, son-in-law of Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, is an important figure in state politics. Tiwari is a Sangh favourite and is seen as a contender for Rajes chair.

 Both ministers have openly challenged Rajes much-publicised move to open a knowledge corridor by acquiring 20,000 bighas of prime agricultural land in Tiwaris constituency, Sanganer.

 In this tussle for power, Raje has deemed it fit to sacrifice Singhvi, whom she had given a cabinet ministers rank not so long ago even at the risk of angering the Sangh.

 Singhvi is a former Congressman who joined the BJP on the eve of the Assembly elections in Rajasthan.

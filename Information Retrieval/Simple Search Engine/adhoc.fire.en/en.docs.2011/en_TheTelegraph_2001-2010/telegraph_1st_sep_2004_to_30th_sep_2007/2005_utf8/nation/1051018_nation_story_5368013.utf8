 Code heat on CRPF officers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 Patna, Oct. 17: The Election Commission has transferred two senior Central Reserve Police Force officers from their election postings in Bihar for flouting the model code of conduct.

 The two ? A.K. Chibber, CRPF inspector-general, Bihar sector, and Alok Raj, a deputy inspector-general ? had visited the residence of Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav late last night.

 Chibber belongs to the CRPF officers cadre and Raj is a Bihar cadre IPS officer on deputation in the central force. He was posted in Patna.

 Commission observer K.J. Rao said today that they (the officers) have been shifted because they held a secret and unexpected meeting at a persons house last night.

 While Chibber has been replaced by Suhas Goswami, the IG of Calcutta, the DIG of Sindhri, G.S.L. Saxena, will replace Raj.

 A CRPF source termed the action of the two officers very extraordinary.

 Some CRPF personnel are deployed for the personal security of Laloo Prasad since he is railway minister. IGs and DIGs can visit any place where CRPF men are deployed but last nights visit, barely two days before polling, was totally out of the blue, he said.

 A simple check will clarify the motive ? whether they made an entry in the register kept by the CRPF personnel at Laloo Prasads residence and whether the register has earlier entries of such inspections by either of them or both. If this is not so, their visit to the politicians house becomes highly suspect, the CRPF source said.

 Laloo Prasad said the decision to shift the two officers was wrong. 

 The two officials were sent to me by the DG of CRPF after I sought security and if they have been transferred for this, it is wrong, the RJD chief said.

 Order on medical coupe in trains 

 Jaipur (PTI): Rajasthan High Court has 

 directed the Centre and the railway board to provide a coupe 

 with trained personnel to ensure medical facilities in all 

 long-distance trains and ensure compliance of its order 

 within 60 days.

 A bench of Justices Shiv Kumar Sharma and Karni Singh Rathore ordered that a team of a medical officer, male nurse and attendant travels in all such trains. 

 The bench was disposing of a public interest petition for suitable medical facilities at railway stations and platforms and the establishment of stalls and shops selling life-saving drugs.

 The court asked the Centre and the board to ensure that each zonal railway reserves a coupe of four berths, equipped with oxygen cylinders, life-saving drugs and injections, and displaying the Red Cross symbol.

 It also directed that the medical team be relieved by another team after covering ?a distance of 500 km, or, as directed by the railway board?.

 The court also directed Doordarshan and All India Radio to create awareness about these facilities.

 SC notice on vanishing tigers

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 sought the Centre?s response on a plea demanding a CBI inquiry 

 into the large-scale disappearance of tigers from Project 

 Tiger reserves across the country.

 A bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, Arijit Pasayat and S.H. Kapadia has sought a reply as to why the agency should not be directed to take up a probe in these reserves, which face problems similar to the Sariska tiger reserve where the big cat has vanished.

 The bench was acting on a petition sent by wildlife expert Ashok Kumar through post to the apex court.

 Kumar, who has been a member of the steering committee of Project Tiger for two terms, has sought an inquiry into the diminishing population of the animals in all tiger reserves and sanctuaries such as Rajasthan?s Ranthambore, Keola Devi and Sawai Madhopur and Panna and Bandhavgarh in Madhya Pradesh. 

 A CBI investigation has also been sought into the affairs of national parks and sanctuaries at Dudwa and Kanha in Madhya Pradesh, Palamu, Jharkhand, and Nagarjun Sagar-Srisalam in Andhra Pradesh.

 UP judiciary clean-up drive

 Lucknow (PTI): Allahabad High Court has 

 compulsorily retired as many as 28 judges of sub-ordinate 

 courts. 

 A committee of five judges of the high court found them guilty of doubtful integrity, alcoholism, moral turpitude and professional incompetence, according to sources. The committee had scanned the service records of over 500 judges of the lower courts. Its report has been submitted to the Uttar Pradesh government. 

 Minor raped

 playing. He took her to a room and raped her. 

 Varsity mishap

 Srinagar (PTI): The controller of examinations 

 of Kashmir University allegedly fell to his death from the 

 third floor of a building on the campus at Hazratbal, sources 

 said. Abrar Hussain Khan was inspecting the building under 

 construction, when he walked over fragile fibreglass that 

 broke down, they said. He died on the spot.

 Tantrik held

 Bhopal (PTI): A tantrik who allegedly 

 forced several girls into illicit relationships has been 

 arrested. The accused used to lure the girls under the garb 

 of teaching them astrology. Police carried out a raid at 

 his rented house and seized three swords, skins of leopard, 

 tiger and deer and pornographic CDs and literature. The 

 tantrik was caught while watching the CDs.

 Hoax bomb 

 Ghaziabad (PTI): A hoax bomb threat delayed 

 the Patna-bound Magadh Express from Delhi for three hours 

 here on Tuesday. The police control room received a call 

 that several bombs had been planted in the train and informed 

 the government railway police. The passengers were asked 

 to alight and a search of all the compartments by bomb disposal 

 and dog squads yielded no bombs.

 Sewagram Ashram, Mahatma Gandhi?s home in 1936, in Maharashtra?s Wardha district is set for a facelift as a tourist-cum-pilgrim centre. The first phase of the project has begun.

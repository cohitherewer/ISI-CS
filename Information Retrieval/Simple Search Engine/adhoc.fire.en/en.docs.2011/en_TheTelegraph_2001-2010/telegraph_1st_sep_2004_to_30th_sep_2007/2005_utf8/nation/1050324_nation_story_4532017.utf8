 Love link in star suicide attempt

 Hyderabad, March 23: Leading Telugu actress Arti Agarwal gulped toilet cleaner last night allegedly after an argument with her father over reports linking her with co-star Tarun.

 The 24-year-old, born and raised in New Jersey, was discharged from Apollo Hospital today and is facing an attempt-to-suicide case, police said.

 Arti, who moved to Hyderabad after her first Hindi film Pagalpan ? opposite Rikku Nath?s son Karan ? bombed, is the third actress to attempt suicide in the past few months. 

 Gajala and Ankita, in the same age group, recently tried to end their lives after failed love affairs. Both survived.

 In an interview with a local TV channel this afternoon, Arti said from her Jubilee Hills apartment: ?I was depressed about gossip of an affair between me and my co-star (Tarun). I had an argument with my father last night which drove me to this act.? For the past couple of months, film magazines and even the mainstream media have been talking about a relationship between the two.

 Her next film ? Soggadu, co-starring Tarun ? is due for release on Friday. Arti and Tarun had starred in the first college romance in Telugu cinema, Nuvvu Leka Nenu Lelu, that set the trend for films targeted at teenagers. 

 The actress made it to the top, getting roles opposite reigning heroes Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Venkatesh and NTR?s sons and grandson. 

 In about five years, she acted in 25-30 films. But over the past year, she had put on weight and was losing out in the rat race as new stars, including Reema Sen, arrived on the scene. 

 Tarun denied any relationship with Arti. ?I am a jovial person. I am friendly with all my co-stars, whether it is Shreeya, Arti or Trisha. We are good friends. I am happy I am working again and again with most of them,? he said.

 The actor blamed Arti?s suicide attempt on the media. ?Touch wood, she is safe. But if something had gone wrong, I am sure no one would spare the media whose gossip ultimately led to this,? he said.

 Industry sources whisper that the suicide attempt might be a publicity gimmick, but her family and Arti herself have denied this vehemently 

 ?I and my family are fed up of this gossip mill,? says Shashank Agarwal, her father. 

 Agarwal, who used to run a business in New Jersey, is now based in Hyderabad and acts as his daughter?s manager.

 Patna, March 29: The Janata Dal (United) today began debating the possibility of forming a government in Bihar but senior leader Nitish Kumar ruled out the chances of breaking its ties with the BJP.

 Kumar described the JD(U)?s relationship with the BJP as an ?old bond? and said a ?flexibility of approach? was a prerequisite for installing a popular government in the state, which is undergoing a spell of central rule.

 A formal resolution on the JD(U)?s political stand is expected on Thursday when the party?s ?Chintan Shivir (introspection camp)? at Rajgir concludes. Also participating in the camp are senior leaders like George Fernandes, Sharad Yadav and Jagannath Mishra.

 Kumar?s statement is significant in the light of Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan?s stance that the JD(U) should dump the BJP and then play a part in the formation of a non-Rashtriya Janata Dal government. ?Central rule is only a temporary relief from the RJD?s 15-year misrule. It is not a permanent solution to the problems of the people of the state. A democratic government needs to be installed. For this, all anti-RJD forces should be flexible and come together. We are ready to play a positive role in the formation of a government,? Kumar said.

 During a pre-election brainstorming session at Pawapuri, a section of JD(U) leaders, the most prominent being former chief minister Mishra, had favoured snapping ties with the BJP. Subsequently, however, the party had decided to contest the elections as part of the NDA.

 JD(U) sources admitted that although a section of the party still favoured distancing from the BJP, the overwhelming opinion was in favour of continuing as a part of the NDA. ?We have performed well as a coalition and won 92 seats. It will, therefore, be politically incorrect, even damaging, to break our ties with the BJP,? a party leader said.

 The JD(U) is also exploring the possibility of chalking out a ?common minimum programme?, which would provide the guidelines for a non-RJD government.

 Kumar has amply hinted at sharing power with the LJP with the BJP providing support to the arrangement from outside. But the LJP president has not favoured this line, as he wants to maintain distance from the BJP. 

 Kumar said his party is trying to cobble up a ?broad-based alliance? since no party or group is capable of forming a government on its own. ?Talks are progressing in the right direction for ending President?s rule in the state,? he said without going into the details. 

 ?All possibilities are being explored,? Kumar said and firmly denied the speculation that his party could consider entering into any kind of agreement with the RJD.

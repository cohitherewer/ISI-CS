 Nitish slams Laloo claims

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Oct. 2: Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar today attacked Laloo Prasad Yadav, his successor as railway minister, and said the RJD presidents claims of a turnaround in the public utilitys performance were misleading.

 I would not like to comment on the certificate given to Laloo Prasad by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has sung praises even for the British rulers. But I can say that the claims being made by the railway minister only tell a selective story, Kumar told a news conference.

 Kumar said the railways was never in loss in the past six years and Laloo Prasad is only quoting the 2000 figures and comparing them with the latest statistics.

 The net revenue receipts (profit) of the railways went up from Rs 1,071 crore in 2000-01 to Rs 2,038 crore in 2001-02. It rose to Rs 3,840 crore the next year and Rs 4,478 crore in 2003-04. In 2004-05, it was Rs 5,274 crore. Where does he (Laloo Prasad) see the losses? The operating ratio has also seen a steady decline from 98.3 in 2000-01 to 91 in 2004-05, the former railway minister said.

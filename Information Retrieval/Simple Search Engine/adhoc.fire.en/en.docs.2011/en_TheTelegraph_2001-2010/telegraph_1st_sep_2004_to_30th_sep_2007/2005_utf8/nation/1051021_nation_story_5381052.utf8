 Cricket clash on right to vote

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: Within a day of announcing a consensus choice of observer for the BCCI election, the rival camps clashed in court today over who is eligible to vote.

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India insisted only regular members should be allowed, but the others ? chiefly Netaji Cricket Club, Chennai ? contended that associate members, too, should be permitted.

 The Supreme Court told them to come back on October 25 to clear the issue and, if possible, reach an out-of-court settlement like the one on election observer. 

 Yesterday, all parties to the case ? BCCI, Netaji club and the Rajasthan and Bihar cricket associations ? had agreed on former chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy as observer.

 The parties informed the bench today that Krishnamurthy had given his consent. 

 Senior counsel K.K. Venugopal, appearing for the BCCI, said there was broad agreement among the parties on various issues. 

 Only a full member of the board was entitled to vote in the yet-to-be-scheduled election, he added.

 Senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for the Netaji club, said there were differences on three-four issues but these could be narrowed down through talks. 

 He said there was agreement over the observer being given the power to decide on disqualification, but there were differences on whether only a full member could vote. Salve suggested that the decision should be left to the observer.

 In the absence of consensus, the Supreme Court granted the parties time till October 25 and adjourned the hearing.

 The bench is hearing special leave petitions challenging the September 23 order of Calcutta High Court overturning the appointment of two additional observers for the poll. 

 The petitioners also want BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendras decision to adjourn the AGM till November 30 to be set aside and have sought a directive from the court to the board to convene the meeting at the earliest and elect the new office- bearers.

 The AGM was adjourned amid much acrimony between the Jagmohan Dalmiya and Sharad Pawar camps, after the Union minister joined the race for BCCI president.

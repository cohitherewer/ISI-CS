 Sonia in UP power pitch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 29: Sonia Gandhi will inaugurate a power plant, part of a mega rural electricity project, in Uttar Pradesh tomorrow in an apparent attempt to gain the upper hand in her party?s battle for power with the ruling Samajwadi Party.

 The Rs 25.58-crore plant will be based in Rae Bareli, the Congress chief?s parliamentary constituency, which, the party says, has been deprived of electricity.

 Sonia?s inauguration of the construction work is believed to be ?sweet revenge? for the Mulayam Singh Yadav government?s ?discriminatory? policy of power supply to rural areas. The Congress chief, who will be in Rae Bareli for two days from tomorrow, will also open a health fair, party sources said here today. 

 Tomorrow?s inauguration is aimed to win the hearts of electricity-starved villagers as the centrally funded project is expected to cover all rural districts where the power situation is grim.

 The Rae Bareli plant alone is expected to supply power to 200 local villages, which on an average get electricity for one hour a day. Many other villages in Sonia?s constituency have electricity poles but without a power connection.

 Her voters have been demanding electricity ever since her election. Sonia sent repeated pleas to the state government, seeking an equitable power distribution system so that Rae Bareli could get its share. Her appeals went unheeded.

 The Congress accused the state government of supplying power to Samajwadi citadels like Etawah (Mulayam Singh?s home district) and Mainpuri (his nephew?s seat) depriving Congress territories.

 Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh blamed the Congress-led Centre for not supplying adequate power through the National Thermal Power Corporation

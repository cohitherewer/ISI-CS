 Court glare on campus elections

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Campus elections, the power-politics launch pad often held responsible for divisive and disruptive tendencies in institutions of learning, have come under the scanner of the Supreme Court.

 Expressing deep concern over the money and muscle power at play in elections to student bodies, the apex court today suggested formation of a committee to regulate the polls and fix qualifications for candidates.

 The (student) leaders from day one unleash unrest on the campuses?. Money spent is equivalent to the one spent for a parliamentary constituency, the court said. 

 It suggested that the proposed committee may be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. The panel can have two eminent academics, one representative of the University Grants Commission (UGC), and a former election commissioner to draft guidelines.

 The government has been asked to respond to the suggestion within 10 days. 

 The courts comments came in response to an appeal by the University of Kerala against a high court order that gave colleges the option of following either the prevailing presidential form (direct elections) or an alternative indirect route.

 The alternative ? in which each class will elect a leader who will be part of an electoral college that will pick the office-bearers of the students union ? was welcomed by several private colleges.

 Many private colleges felt that class-wise elections will give merit a chance and good students might enter the fray. Some academics and parents have suggested that toppers from every class should form the electoral college.

 The top court made it clear that it is treating the subject as a national issue. 

 Vice-chancellors are being locked up by these student leaders...curb this menace, a division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and G.P. Mathur told additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian, who appeared for the Union government.

 The bench said it was particularly perturbed with the practice of student leaders getting themselves admitted repeatedly in a college in different courses so that they can keep contesting elections.

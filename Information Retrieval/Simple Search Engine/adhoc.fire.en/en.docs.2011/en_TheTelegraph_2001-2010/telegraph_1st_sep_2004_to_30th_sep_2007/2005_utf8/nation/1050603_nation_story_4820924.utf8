 Calcutta, June 2: Flyovers do not figure in Mamata Banerjees plans for the citys development. Hawkers and illegal settlers do.

 The Trinamul Congress chief, who released her partys manifesto for the June 19 civic elections, said: Wide, gleaming flyovers do not mean development. As far as I am concerned, genuine development means improving the condition of the poor.

 If given a second term in office, the Trinamul-BJP combine would stop the drive against unauthorised hawkers on city roads and illegal settlers along railway tracks or canals or slums, she said. 

 We are against any drive that does not talk about making alternative arrangements for them, the 12-page manifesto announced.

 The dismissal of flyovers is seen as a snub to mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who is Mamatas enemy no. 2 after he broke away from her party. Mukherjee has promised to construct a pair of flyovers in Calcutta if re-elected.

 The Trinamul chief received backhanded support from the CPM, her enemy no. 1. We think flyovers are needed in a modern city, but they are the governments business and not the civic bodys, said state CPM secretary Anil Biswas.

 Mamata lashed out at Mukherjee, without naming him, describing him as a conspirator who stabbed in the back just before the approaching civic elections.

 The manifesto did not mention Mukherjees work but said the party under our leader stopped an individual when it was felt his act would adversely affect the common man.

 It cited several water, health, slum development and drainage and sewerage projects that the previous CPM-run board, not her party, had begun. 

 Mamata pegged her appeal for ballots on Trinamuls sterling performance in running the outgoing Calcutta Municipal Corporation with the BJP. She also issued a 29-point statement of intent regarding the future.

 Mamata said a second term would see Trinamul concentrate on slum development, the drive against malaria, new parks and market complexes, tax rationalisation, employment for one lakh youths, primary schools, modern crematoriums, housing and hospitals for common people, more bus stands and old-age homes.

 The manifesto lashed out at the Congress, calling it he CPMs A team ? in the past, she has referred to it as the CPMs B team. 

 Quizmaster Derek Brien joined the party today and was present for the manifesto release at Mamatas residence. Brien has been asked to assist MLA Partha Chatterjee who edits Jago Bangla, the party organ. I consider her one of the most sincere and honest politicians, he said.

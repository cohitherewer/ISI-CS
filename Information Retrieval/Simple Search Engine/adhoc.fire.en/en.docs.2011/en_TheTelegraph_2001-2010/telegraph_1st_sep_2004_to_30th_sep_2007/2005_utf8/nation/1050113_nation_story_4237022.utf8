 Foreign ?hand? in bullet haul

 R. KRISHNA DAS 

 Raipur, Jan. 10: Chhattisgarh police have claimed that Communist Party of India (Maoist) activists use bullets made in Great Britain and Pakistan in their fight against the state machinery.

 The revelation followed the recovery of empty cartridges from Indrapuri, where security personnel had an encounter with a group of Maoists on Saturday morning.

 ?The state police have recovered more than 200 cartridges manufactured in Pakistan and Great Britain from the spot in Indrapuri in Balrampur police district, where security personnel had an encounter with the Maoists on Saturday,? Chhattisgarh home minister Brijmohan Agrawal told The Telegraph. 

 Inspector-general of police (Sarguja range) Ram Niwas said there were marks of the defence establishments of Pakistan and Britain on the empty cartridges. A huge cache of arms and ammunition was transported from Pakistan during the war in Afghanistan. The possibility of a part of it entering India cannot be ruled out, the senior police official said.

 Rail minister in balancing act 

 New Delhi: Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has given into the demands from Kerala and decided not to extend the Kerala Express to Chandigarh, reports our special correspondent. 

 The train runs between Thiruvananthapuram and Delhi.

 He also announced a new train between Kanpur and Mumbai.

 Laloo Prasad also tried to appease the members from Punjab and Haryana and announced that the Kerala Sampark Kranti Express, which is scheduled to start its operations this month, would be extended to Chandigarh.

 The minister received approval from the Lok Sabha for the supplementary demands for grants of more than Rs 2,750 crore amid a boycott by the National Democratic Alliance. 

 Later, the House passed the vote-on-account for two months and also cleared the relevant appropriation bills.

 While the NDA members staged a walkout, Trinamul leader Mamta Banerjee was seen sitting for about 30 minutes while Laloo Prasad replied to the points raised by the members.

 Responding to the debate on the rail budget, Laloo Prasad said there would be no compromise on safety and security aspects and special measures ? both human resources and technical ? are being put in place.

 The judgment came on a petition by the Narmada Bachao Andolan, which had suggested that the height of the dam could be raised in phases after completing rehabilitation for the affected families.

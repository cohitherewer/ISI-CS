 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Mumbai today began easing into normal gear with buses and rains running and schools promising to reopen tomorrow.

 Cheered by the first spell of bright sunlight in almost a week, most Mumbaikars returned to work, though low areas remained under water and occasional showers lashed the suburbs.

 Frankly, I am relieved, said A.K. Jhandwal who, as chief fire officer, commands Mumbais 2,050 firefighters and is its principal crisis manager.

 The rainfall dropped sharply since last night. The weather bureaus Colaba observatory recorded no rain since reporting 86.8 mm at 8.30 am. The Santa Cruz observatory, which counted 149.5 mm till 8.30 am, registered only 2.4 mm between then and 5.30 pm.

 The citys lifelines ? the three suburban railway networks, the Best bus service and the airport ? gradually whirred into life.

 Today, the entire fleet of 3,247 was back on the streets, Best public relations officer Chandrakant Tamboli said.

 With their schedules gone haywire for the past two days, domestic airlines did cancel some flights, but aviation authorities said the airport would be back functioning to capacity by tomorrow.

 Schools and colleges in suburban Mumbai are set to reopen. We felt that our students who stay in low-lying areas, like Kalina and Andheri, are now ready to return to school. So, we shall reopen tomorrow, said D.P.N. Prasad, the principal of Bombay Scottish High School at Mahim.

 Schools at Kalina, Kurla and Sakinaka, the areas that are closest to the flooded Mithi river, continue to be closed because of lack of power, proper drinking water and repeated flooding.

 Disease remains a threat as many corpses and animal carcasses are yet to be cleared in the city, where 1,200 buffalos and 15,000 sheep and goats died in the floods.

 Pune, however, was flooded after up to 130,000 cusecs was released from the Khadakvasla, Mulshi and Pawana dams. 

 We have evacuated 5,500 families from Pimpri and Pune city and about 1,000 families from the rural areas, said deputy collector Suhas Divase.

 Ten districts continue to be ravaged by floods. Chief secretary R.M. Premkumar estimated the state had lost more than Rs 1,500 crore in last weeks floods, other than losses suffered by individuals.

 Anger tinged with tension

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: Shaking off the numbness that had gripped them last night, faculty and students at IIT Delhi today assembled to remember a gentle and helpful friend and speak out against his cowardly killers.

 But anger was tinged with apprehension on the campus a day after Dr M.C. Puri, professor emeritus for mathematics, was gunned down in Bangalore in what appears to have been a terrorist strike on a scientific seminar.

 We may be shocked, even stunned, but more than anything else we are full of questions for those who carried out this dastardly act. What did they gain by shooting at Sir? said Rajat, who had been studying under Puri for the past two years. They cant scare us.

 But several teachers betrayed the chilling realisation, brought home to them suddenly, that they, too, could become targets of terrorist attacks. Dr Puri was a role model for younger professors like me. I will now feel scared to attend such conferences, said maths professor Dr Suresh Chandra.

 The entire faculty, along with almost a hundred students and officials, gathered at noon to remember Puri at the institutes convocation hall today.

 Dr D.P. Kothari, deputy director (administration), said he had known Puri for nearly two decades and had shared a close friendship with him.

 We both were specialists in operations research and had attended a number of conferences together. We had kept in close touch even after his retirement, he said. 

 This would have come as a shock not only to IITians but to the entire teaching community and scientific community.

 The students were very angry and upset.

 We just know that Sir was targeted because he was easy to kill. Those who did this are absolute cowards, said Sanyog, a final-year student, as he gazed at his former teachers photograph.

 Colleagues spoke warmly of the dead professor. 

 He was a very gentle man and very helpful. I joined the IIT maths department only a couple of years ago. It was my first teaching experience. He helped me a lot, said Dr S. Dharamraja.

 An acquaintance said: Puri saab could not have had any personal enemies. All this is beyond belief.

 Laloo admits election error

 ASHISH SINHA

 Laloo Prasad: Unworthy?

 Patna, April 15: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav today admitted that wrong selection of candidates was a major factor for his party?s poor performance in the Assembly polls.

 Henceforth, he said, tickets would be provided only on the recommendation of the district unit concerned.

 ?Applications will no longer be invited from candidates. Everyone wants to be an MP or an MLA these days. No one has the patience to work for the party. A lot of betrayers were responsible for our poor show in the elections. We have identified them and they will be dealt with,? Laloo Prasad said at an RJD review meeting for the Patna division.

 Chaos reigned at the meeting where speaker after speaker blamed ?growing indiscipline and infighting?, along with highhandedness of senior leaders, for throwing the party out of power. At least two of them were heckled for speaking their mind and blaming higher-ups for the ?debacle?.

 Two others, invited to speak by Laloo Prasad himself, went on to favour President?s rule so that the betrayers learnt the lesson of their lives for taking the party for a ride.

 A representative from Buxar said: ?Some people have adopted a divide-and-rule policy. They are not even ready to sit on one platform. I tried to bring them to one place but a (former) minister boycotted the meeting.?

 Taken aback by the attack, which even led to an applause, senior party leaders, including MLA Shyam Rajak, tried to stop him from speaking.

 The representative was pushed around and when allowed to speak again, he said: ?When we try to speak out, mouths are sealed. We should be ready to listen to criticism.?

 Another worker from Mokamah said some prominent leaders were responsible for the party?s defeat in the region. ?Workers on the ground were ignored while those with connections were favoured,? he said just as Laloo Prasad took his seat.

 ?We also know such people, they will not be spared. Some people in our party betrayed us. But this is not the place for such talk. You give your views in writing,? Laloo Prasad said.

 ?I am going to meet the Prime Minister. Day after tomorrow I will watch a cricket match. Aap kya dekhiyega, yeh naa bataiye (Tell me, what will you see)? How many leaders will the party have: one or one lakh?? a visibly upset Laloo Prasad asked.

 ?Ab rone se kya faida (What is the point in crying now)? People have rejected all parties. They considered every party to be unworthy. Among the unworthy ones, they considered the RJD a little worthy and so we got the maximum number of seats,? the RJD chief said.

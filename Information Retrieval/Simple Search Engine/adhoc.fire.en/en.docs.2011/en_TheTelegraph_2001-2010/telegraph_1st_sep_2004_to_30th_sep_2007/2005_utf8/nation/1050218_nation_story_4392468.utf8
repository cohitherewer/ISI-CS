 No central rule: Cong

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 17: Minister of state for home S.P. Jaiswal today ruled out President?s rule in Bihar and said the Congress will play a key role in the formation of a coalition government of ?like-minded secular groups? in the state.

 Yesterday, Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan said he preferred President?s rule in Bihar to joining hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the BJP in the event of a hung Assembly.

 ?In any case, a secular government will be formed once again in the state. The Congress party will play a key role in it,? said former Congress MP Wasim Ahmad at a news conference.

 However, the Congress did not rule out the possibility of the LJP aligning with Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party in their bid to keep the NDA away from power.

 On the Janata Dal (United), Ahmad said, ?How can you think that the Congress will ever have an alliance with the JD(U)? It is part and parcel of the NDA.?

 Echoing Jaiswal, senior party leader Ram Naresh Yadav said, ?The Congress will play a crucial role in the formation of a secular government and fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bihar.?

 The party veterans argued that the new government, including the RJD, will solve the deteriorating law and order problem in the state. ?The changed scenario will automatically lead us to check crime, improve law and order and concentrate on development,? Ahmad said.

 Union minister Arjun Singh and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh will campaign in Patna and other parts of Bihar tomorrow.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to canvass for state legislature party leader Vijay Shankar Dubey at Raghunathpur in Siwan on Saturday.

 Strain in French ties over plane

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Saran

 New Delhi, May 6: Business competition over a large Air-India order for airplanes has blown into a diplomatic row with India today expressing displeasure at remarks made by the French ambassador yesterday, questioning the process of awarding the contract.

 The American Boeing won the order for 50 aircraft valued at $6.9 billion, beating France-based Airbus Industrie.

 At a meeting this afternoon, foreign secretary Shyam Saran told French ambassador Dominique Girard that his comment about ?some factor other than commercial? having played a role in deciding the contract was ?not in keeping with diplomatic propriety?.

 ?We are surprised and disappointed. Airbus definitely has an advantage over Boeing? It is clear that some factors other than commercial have played a role,? Girard had said.

 He expressed the hope that India would consider ?comprehensive factors? while deciding on the purchase of 126 fighter planes, for which the French Mirage is competing. The US recently threw its hat into the ring by offering the F-16.

 The trouble over the Air-India order is symbolic of US-France rivalry over Delhis ambitious civil aviation and defence purchase plans. 

 The Americans are lobbying the Indian leadership to sell their F-16s and F-18s, pitting themselves against the French bid to sell the Mirage 2000. India has been reluctant to buy defence material from the US, which has a record of stopping supplies through sanctions.

 Girard stressed the point, saying that unlike the US, France never reneges on its contracts and goes through with delivery irrespective of the political situation.

 India worded the statement it issued on the meeting between Saran and Girard carefully so as not to step into a diplomatic minefield. It made sure that Girards visit to the foreign office was not termed a ?summons?, the word that is used when India wants to register a strong protest.

 Instead, it described Girards visit as ?calling on the foreign secretary?.

 Saran ?drew his attention to the press reports and told him that if these reports were correct, the French ambassadors remarks were not in keeping with diplomatic propriety?, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said. 

 The French ambassador said he had merely expressed ?disappointment?, adding that his remarks had not been ?correctly quoted?.

 Despite the cautious tone of the ministrys statement, the developments suggest signs of strain between the two countries.

 France earned a special place in Indian foreign policy with its support after the 1998 nuclear tests. When the US and many other Western countries were trying to isolate India, France played the role of a trusted ally by ensuring at many multilateral forums that resolutions against Delhi were mild and did not go as far as to declare sanctions.

 In the past six years, especially from the time serious engagement began between India and the US, Delhi has been more active in building stronger ties with the worlds sole superpower than in nurturing relations with Paris.

 Indian officials also point out that it is not as if Airbus is not getting Indian orders, having just beaten Boeing in bagging an Indian Airlines contract.

 ?It has been a fair game so far. To imply that there were other considerations to give the contract to Boeing was an undiplomatic comment by the French ambassador,? an official said.

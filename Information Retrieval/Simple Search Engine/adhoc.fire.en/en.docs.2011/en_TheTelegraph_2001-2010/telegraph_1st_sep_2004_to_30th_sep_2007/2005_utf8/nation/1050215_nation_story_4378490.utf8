 Praise from Lanka

 Colombo, Feb. 14 (PTI): India today received praise for its post-tsunami relief operations in southern Sri Lanka, once a hotbed of Sinhalese militants who opposed Indian peace-keeping forces on the island. 

 In a letter to the Indian military, Galle?s chief district collector praised its contribution in building bridges, clearing debris and treating the injured after the tsunami. 

 One of the main bridges along the main road to the south of the island was repaired by Indian military units.

 ?The dedication and commitment to task shown by this Indian team deserves commendation and the people of the south of Sri Lanka will remember their great contribution,? G. Hewawitharana said.

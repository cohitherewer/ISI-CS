 Bhatt Shoaib mission flops

 Shoaib: Just cricket

 Islamabad, May 24 (PTI): A personal effort by Mahesh Bhatt notwithstanding, speedster Shoaib Akhtar has turned down an offer from the filmmaker to play the lead role in his forthcoming film Gangster.

 Bhatt, who is in Pakistan to promote his new film Nazar, met Shoaibs media and marketing manager yesterday in Karachi to try and convince the bowler to take up the offer.

 However, the manager conveyed the bowlers intention to continue to concentrate on his cricket and thanked Bhatt for his offer.

 Bhatt was in Karachi on Monday and met Shoaibs agent who has been brought in to market and project a positive image of the cricketer publicly, local daily The News quoted a source close to the player as saying.

 He (Shoaibs manager) thanked Bhatt for considering Shoaib for the film but made it clear to him that the paceman would not be taking up an acting career and that he wanted to concentrate full time on cricket.

 He also told Bhatt that Shoaib was very keen to make a comeback to the Pakistan team and realised the only way he could do this was to concentrate 100 per cent on cricket and go and perform for Worcestershire.

 Despite the bowler making it clear that he was not interested in taking up acting, Bhatt had said he would personally try to convince the Rawalpindi Express to take up the offer. 

 The source said Shoaib, who was overlooked for the ongoing West Indies tour by the selectors as they believe he still needs to regain 100 per cent match fitness to play at the international level, is very keen to make a comeback in the home series against England later this year. 

 Another factor that had jolted Shoaib was his mothers illness, the source added.

 He now just wants to put everything behind him and concentrate on performing and winning back his place in the national team, the source said.

 Bhatt had offered the role to Shoaib after he was unable to get dates from Bollywood stars Sanjay Dutt and John Abraham.

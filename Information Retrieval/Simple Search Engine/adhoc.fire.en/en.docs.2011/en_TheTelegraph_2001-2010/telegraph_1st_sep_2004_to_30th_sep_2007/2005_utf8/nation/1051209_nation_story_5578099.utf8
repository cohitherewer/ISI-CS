 Shot at tumour cell suicide therapy

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Calcutta scientists have sought government permission to offer patients with brain tumours an experimental therapy that selectively pushes tumour cells to self-destruct and leaves normal cells unscathed. 

 After five years of experiments on rats, Swapna Chaudhuri and her colleagues at the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Calcutta want to begin studies on patients with gliomas, a devastating type of malignant brain tumours.

 The researchers have shown that a protein known as T-11 target structure (T11TS) stimulates the bodys natural immune system into launching an attack on gliomas.

 The studies on rats have been encouraging. We think this is ready for human trials, said Chaudhuri, who received an oration award for her findings at the annual conference of the Physiological Society of India in Gulbarga (Karnataka) last week.

 Drug regulatory authorities in Delhi and the Indian Council of Medical Research are now expected to decide if the experimental data that she has generated is enough to launch human clinical trials.

 The studies on rats have shown that when the T11TS protein is injected into the peritoneum ? the abdominal cavity ? specific immune cells are activated and initiate a sequence of immunological events within the brain that culminate in the glioma cells selectively going into a self-destruct mode to commit cellular suicide ? a process called apoptosis. These events do not harm normal brain cells.

 In rats, the benefit of this therapy is clearly visible, Chaudhuri told The Telegraph. The researchers induced gliomas in rats using a cancer-causing chemical called ethyl-nitrosourea. Untreated rats with gliomas lived for about 190 days. But T11TS significantly prolonged their lives.

 The researchers had published the study in several international journals, including Anti-cancer Research and Cancer Biology and Therapy, earlier this year before applying for permission for clinical trial. 

 The toxicological studies weve conducted on animals have also shown that T11TS has no adverse effects, Chaudhuri said. Experiments have shown that the T11TS protein isolated from the red blood cells of sheep does not have any direct effect on glioma cells. The cell-killing action is through the immune system. One of the natural functions of the immune system is to nip cancers in the bud by destroying the very first tumorous cells long before they proliferate.

 But gliomas secrete immuno-suppressive factors that inactivate immune cells and prevent them from engaging in these normal functions, Chaudhuri said. The T11TS protein has the ability to reactivate the disarmed system.

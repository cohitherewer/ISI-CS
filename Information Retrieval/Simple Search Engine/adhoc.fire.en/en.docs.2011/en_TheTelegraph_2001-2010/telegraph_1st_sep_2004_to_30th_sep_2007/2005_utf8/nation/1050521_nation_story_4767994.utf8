 Natwar balm for king baiters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 20: Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh today allayed the fears of Nepalese pro-democracy leaders by telling them China and Pakistan have both assured India they would not lift their arms embargo on Nepal.

 Delhi, which recently resumed defence ties with the kingdom, maintains that it has not supplied arms but only some military trucks, jeeps and night vision goggles that were in the pipeline.

 Singhs meeting with the leaders of the seven-party alliance in Nepal comes at a time when Delhi has been under fire for allegedly giving in to the kings demands. The foreign minister clearly meant to reassure his guests that India does not accord preference to Gyanendra over the pro-democracy groups.

 Dont worry, no arms have gone to Nepal so far, Singh assured the Nepalese delegation. We dont have any policy to appease the king.

 The ministers statement has debunked the position of certain lobbies in South Block, especially in the defence ministry, that are keen to resume arms supply to the Royal Nepal Army. These groups argue that if India does not give weapons to Kathmandu, China and Pakistan will.

 The Maoist bogey, too, has been raised as an argument in favour of arming Nepal. But Singh told the Nepalese leaders his ministry does not see any immediate threat of a rebel takeover of their country.

 The meeting also discussed the differences among the Maoist leadership and the guerrillas attitude towards India and the king.

 The minister made it clear that Delhi felt encouraged by the major Nepalese political parties decision to join hands against Gyanendra. We feel encouraged by the joint statement issued by the seven political parties, Singh told his guests. Please remain united in your fight for democracy.

 Delhi believes that for all his talk of a roadmap for an early return of democracy, the king will not give up power on his own.

 A sceptical foreign minister told the Nepalese leaders that according to his ministrys assessment, the king will continue to hold on to his executive powers unless he faces strong pressure to relinquish them.

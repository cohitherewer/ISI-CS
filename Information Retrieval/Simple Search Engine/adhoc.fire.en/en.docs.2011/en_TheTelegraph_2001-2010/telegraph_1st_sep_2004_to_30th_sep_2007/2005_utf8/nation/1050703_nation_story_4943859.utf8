 Imrana seduced me, says accused

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Muzaffarnagar, July 2: Ali Mohammad, the man accused of raping daughter-in-law Imrana, now claims she seduced him to get him to write a piece of land in her name. The prosecution believes he is lying.

 In the presence of his counsel Amit Tyagi, the 65-year-old said Imrana had lured him into a sexual relationship. 

 Look at me, I am too old to force myself on anyone, the five-foot-four, frail man alleged as he was being led to court here yesterday. Imrana wanted me to write in her name a 230-square-metre plot adjacent to my house. I was not willing to do that. So I was trapped and given a bad name.

 Its a figment of his imagination, said investigating officer Surendra Singh Yadav. Its an afterthought. He kept silent for two weeks and is now making false allegations.

 Let the medical report on Imrana come, prosecution lawyer P.N. Tripathi said. It will nail Alis lie.

 After the alleged rape at the familys home in Charthwal, the local panchayat asked Imrana to leave husband Noor Ilahi, ruling she had now become a sort of mother to him. When the Deoband seminary passed a similar edict on June 27, Imrana moved in with her parents at Kukra.

 The panchayat, which annulled Imranas marriage under Shariat law, recommended Ali be punished according to the IPC. Islamic law, the panchayat said, requires Ali to be stoned to death.

 During his first two weeks at Muzaffarnagar district jail ? where he is an object of scorn to his three younger cell mates ? Ali had kept quiet. It was on June 30, when his remand was extended by another 14 days, that Tyagi told the court: Imrana was not raped. She had consensual sex with my client.

 We, however, have found out that Imrana used to have difficulties running the household with her five children because her rickshaw-puller husband did not earn enough, the investigating officer said. Ali used to offer her money and finally, began making sexual advances.

 Villagers at Charthwal said an elder brother of Noor had left the house with his family after Ali tried to force his wife, too, to sleep with him.

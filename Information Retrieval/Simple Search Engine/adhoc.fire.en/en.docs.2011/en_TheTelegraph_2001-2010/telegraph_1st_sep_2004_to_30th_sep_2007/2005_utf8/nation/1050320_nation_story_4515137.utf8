 Mobile bug bites Indians

 New York, March 19 (PTI): India, along with the US, China and Britain, is among the top 20 countries where the latest models of mobile phones are most coveted, a new worldwide survey has found.

 When consumers around the globe were asked what technology they most frequently upgraded, 63 per cent cited mobile phones, according to the survey by Gmipoll.

 The proportion of consumers who are swapping older for the newest models is the highest in the fastest growing and potentially largest markets for mobile phone services, including Asia and South America.

 Almost 75 per cent of consumers surveyed in India and China and 67 per cent in South America said they upgraded their cellphones more frequently than any other gadget. This compares to 47 per cent of American and 38 per cent of French consumers.

 The findings, the survey said, highlight how new technology products are transforming markets worldwide and adding to a growing environmental problem of the waste generated by old technology being discarded for the new models.

 By 2005, it estimates that 100 million cellphones will be thrown out annually in Europe alone. In the US, nearly 130 million cellphones ? totalling about 65,000 tonnes of waste ? will be thrown away every year, according to a recent study by Inform Inc, an independent research organisation.

 Disposed cellphones are growing faster than the volume of waste overall, said recycling experts. Toxins associated with this type of waste include heavy metals and poisons like arsenic, lead and mercury.

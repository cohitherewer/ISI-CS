 Advani exit not on agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 7: Lal Krishna Advani will remain at the BJPs helm at least till the sunset of December 30.

 General secretary Pramod Mahajan today told reporters his party chief would not put in his papers at the three-day national convention scheduled here from December 28.

 Briefing the media ahead of the convention, he said Advanis resignation was not on the official agenda of the meet and is certain not to come up before the sunset of December 30. The BJP stalwart, he added, might quit later within a reasonable time frame.

 Advani, who kicked off a row after he praised Pakistans founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah, is scheduled to quit by the end of the year.

 Mahajan refused to say if the party would have a new president on New Years Day. This convention is to celebrate 25 years of the BJP. Therefore, there is no question of anybodys resignation or coronation, he said at Rang Sharda auditorium where the party held its first national convention under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1980.

 Advanis resignation is expected to dominate the three-day convention and the two-day ? December 26 and 27 ? national executive that precedes it. 

 Over 3,500 party workers and the entire national leadership are expected to attend the five-day programme in Mumbai.

 Buta dossiers to go public

 Buta Singh

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: For the first time in the countrys history, the Centre today offered to make public two secret and privileged reports to the President sent by Bihar governor, Buta Singh, on the basis of which the Bihar Assembly was dissolved on May 23. 

 The Supreme Court had earlier sought all reports and documents related to the dissolution, which has been challenged by a batch of petitions. 

 The court was informed today that the two reports will be submitted along with the Centres reply so that they become public. 

 Fighting a tricky legal battle on the dissolution case, and hard put to establish that the dissolution was bona fide, the UPA government hopes to turn the table by making the reports public. 

 The governors reports, sent on April 27 and May 21, are believed to contain details of inducements offered by the NDA to the newly elected MLAs owing allegiance to Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party. The Bihar governor is even believed to have obtained affidavits by some of these people before making allegations of horse-trading and defending the dissolution.

 Petitioners challenging the dissolution had accused the governor of being partisan and of not applying his mind. 

 Pointing out that the central cabinet met around midnight on May 22 and recommended dissolution to the President, who was away in Moscow at the time. President Kalam had signed on the dotted lines and faxed his assent in the wee hours of May 23. The petitions prayed for revival of the Assembly and declaring the dissolution as void. 

 The petitions had also claimed that a polarisation of forces was taking place and NDA leader Nitish Kumar was on the verge of staking his claim and parading the MLAs before the governor, when the House was dissolved. 

 The governor in turn had defended his decision and pointed out to a group of Bihar MLAs being held hostage in Jharkhand by the NDA government ruling the state.

 In earlier hearings, the apex court had asked the Centre to show cause why the governor should not be summoned to explain his stand on the legal mala fides and explain the governors failure to perform the constitutional duty of first swearing in the elected legislators and then assess the strength of various claimants to form the government.

 The apex court has repeatedly observed that the governor recommended dissolution of a non-existing Assembly as no member was administered oath. 

 The Assembly did not even exist.... How come you dissolved a non-existing Assembly? the chief justice said during an earlier hearing. 

 Not swearing in the members would thus figure in tomorrows arguments when the Centre gives its replies to why the governor should not be summoned to explain his action.

 On the question of issuing notices to the governor and summoning him, former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, who appeared for four NDA legislators, argued that the constitutional functionary was the best person to answer allegations levelled against him. 

 Attorney General Milon Banerjee and additional solicitor general Gopal Subramanian opposed the argument, arguing that the Constitution prohibits courts from inquiring into the acts of governors. 

 The arguments remained inconclusive and so the hearing would resume tomorrow.

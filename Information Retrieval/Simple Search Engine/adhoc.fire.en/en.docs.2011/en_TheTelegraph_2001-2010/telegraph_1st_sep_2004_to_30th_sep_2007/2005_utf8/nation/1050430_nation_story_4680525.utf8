 Parveen kin pops up with ?will?

 Ahmedabad: A cousin of Parveen Babi has 

 claimed before a Junagadh district court that the actor?s 

 will gives him the ?administrative powers over all her properties, 

 including the house in Junagadh and a flat in Juhu area 

 of Mumbai?, reports our correspondent.

 ?I have given a copy of the will to the court. The will instructs me to form a trust under her name and that all moveable and immovable properties, bank accounts, jewellery and contents of her bank locker at Junagadh should be managed by the trust and that too, for the needy, including those within the family,? Murad Khan said. Parveen Babi had executed this will on July 26, 2002, he added.

 The court is likely to hear the case next month.

 Parveen Babi was found dead at her Juhu residence on January 22. Eight of her relatives in Junagadh have claimed rights over her property and filed affidavits before the court. 

 Cops off black money probe

 New Delhi: The government has introduced 

 an amendment to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to 

 keep policemen away from investigations into offences under 

 the law passed two years ago, reports our special correspondent.

 The act was enacted in January 2003 but has not been implemented, for one because the government could not decide who should enforce the law. Officials from the income-tax department, the directorate of revenue intelligence and the enforcement directorate had sought powers to enforce it. 

 The enforcement directorate, that had lost much of its work after Parliament toned down the foreign exchange management law, has finally been entrusted with this responsibility.

 The amendment moved by finance minister P. Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha on Friday is aimed at ensuring that the enforcement directorate does not have to fight it out with the local police over jurisdiction when the law is finally implemented.

 PM nod to new airport

 Chennai: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 

 has given his ?approval? to building a new international 

 airport in Chennai, says our special correspondent.

 Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel wrote to Jayalalithaa informing her about Singh?s decision, according to a statement from the chief minister?s office. Jayalalithaa has promised additional land for the project. 

 UK-based consultants Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick had recommended the establishment of a world-class international airport in Chennai, in the wake of a proposal by the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation.

 Dawood aide held

 Ahmedabad: Gujarat police have arrested 

 Izra-ul-Huq, a key aide of Dawood Ibrahim and one of the 

 main accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts case. Huq, who was 

 absconding, was picked up from a hotel in Mumbai on Friday. 

 Huq, once a Congress leader close to then chief minister 

 Chiman Patel, was expelled from the party after his association 

 with Dawood and his role in transporting RDX to Mumbai came 

 to light. 

 PoK petition

 New Delhi: Giving a legal twist to the 

 India-Pakistan bonhomie, the Panthers? Party has moved the 

 Supreme Court seeking to restrain the Jammu and Kashmir 

 government from acceding to any request from PoK visitors 

 laying claim over the property they had left behind. Almost 

 all such properties, known as ?evacuee property?, has been 

 allotted to residents of the state.

 Rights ruling

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday 

 upheld the appointment of former CBI director P.C. Sharma 

 as member of the National Human Rights Commission. The ruling 

 came after the apex bench dismissed a petition filed by 

 the People?s Union for Civil Liberties, saying a police 

 officer should not be on the panel as police were the country?s 

 ?biggest human rights violators?. It said ?public perception 

 of human rights records of police cannot be generalised 

 into an institutional bias?.

 The number of pilgrims to the Vaishno Devi temple is increasing steadily, making it the biggest mountainous cave shrine in the country. Over 61 lakh pilgrims now visit it every year.

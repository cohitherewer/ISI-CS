 - Harassment 

 list includes Kareena, Deepti and Poonam

 Mumbai, Oct. 19: A man who allegedly bombarded Bollywood beauties with obscene phone calls and text messages has been arrested after a three-week hunt across two states following a complaint from actor Kareena Kapoor.

 Mohammed Meraj Rehman of Hyderabad finally fell to the same snare that he had used to harass and swindle over a dozen budding and established actors: temptation over the mobile phone.

 Using actor Smriti Mishra, one of Rehmans victims, as a decoy, Bandra police lured the 25-year-old to a rendezvous in Mumbai and grabbed him with his briefcase. 

 Other than Kapoor and Mishra, Bollywood veterans Deepti Naval and Poonam Dhillon have reported harassment. At least 12 aspiring actors have alleged that Rehman contacted them with the promise of a role in Mani Ratnams new film and asked them over to Hyderabad.

 Kapoor wrote to deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Gupta three weeks ago, complaining she had been receiving 25 to 30 calls a day on her mobile, along with obscene text messages, Gupta said. She had suffered the harassment for nearly three weeks.

 The first clue came from Oshiwara police who, six months ago, had received a complaint from budding actor Smita Gondkar, a Zee talent hunt contestant. She had said a certain Rahul Oberoi had asked her over to Hyderabad to act in a Mani Ratnam film. Rahul had told her to bring her passport along for a possible foreign trip, and later cheated her out of Rs 10,000 promising to get her a visa.

 Gupta sent a team to a Hyderabad address, where the sleuths learnt the callers real name was Rehman. He had five cheating cases against him and had been out on bail. 

 The police failed to trace the man but learnt from his cellphone records that he had called several women in Mumbai with the offer of film roles. The police contacted the victims and persuaded them to cooperate. Mishra agreed to be a decoy.

 He had invited me to Hyderabad. He had also asked me to find a bride for him, explaining that his grandparents, who live in the US, want him to get married and inherit Rs 150 crore worth of property, said Mishra, who has acted in Shyam Benegals Sardari Begum, Sudhir Mishras Is Raat Ki Subah Nahi and Ruchi Narains Kal ? Yesterday, Tomorrow.

 After Kal ? Yesterday, Tomorrow was released, he called me again and objected to a scene where I embrace co-actor Shiny Ahuja. He threatened to place a bomb in the theatre if I didnt stop doing such sequences. That was when I felt this was serious.

 She, however, didnt lodge a complaint till the police traced her number from Rehmans phone records and got in touch with her.

 Rehman took Rs 10,000 from Gondkar. We are investigating how much money he took from the others, some of whom even travelled to Ooty with him, Gupta said.

 The Hunter: Rehman

Rehman also swindled several artistes by showing them a forged agreement purportedly signed by Deepti Naval Productions and Heaven Heart, the police said. He had promised the victims roles in a film produced by Kamal Ahmed Khan and directed by Sandhya Rahul.

 At Bandra police station, Rehman told reporters he had never threatened anyone. He claimed to be an aspiring film writer. I did this because I wanted these actresses to help me approach producers. I called Deepti Naval because she is close to director Prakash Jha and could help me sell him my script.

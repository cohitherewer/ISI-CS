 Ban call after rebel carnage 

 OUR BUREAU

 Hyderabad / New Delhi, Aug. 16: Maoists gunned own Congress legislator C. Narsi Reddy and eight others at a function on Independence Day, forcing the state to consider reviving the ban on the rebels.

 A state cabinet meeting this evening asked chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy to take the final decision on the ban, which was lifted a year ago to set the stage for a peace dialogue. 

 The talks, which began in October 2004, collapsed when the rebels walked out in January.

 The Reddy government has already sounded the Centre on bringing the ban back. The response has been affirmative, a source in Delhi said.

 Following the massacre, the Centre, too, has decided to harden its stand and plans to relentlessly pursue the Naxalites, a senior home ministry official said.

 There will be little room for any talks with them, he said. We will be going after them now.

 Yesterday, the assailants sprayed AK-47 bullets on a crowd of 100 at a road-laying ceremony at Narayanpet, about 140 km southwest of Hyderabad. The attack killed the MLA, his son Venkateswar Reddy, local municipal commissioner D.V. Rammohan, Congress workers Monappa Gowd, Ravinder Gowd and Lokeswar Reddy and three others. Seventeen people were wounded.

 All India Congress Committee general secretary Digvijay Singh attended the emotionally charged funeral today where party workers attacked police vehicles.

 Ironically, state Congress president K. Keshav Rao aimed a salvo at the YSR government, criticising alleged fake encounters staged by the police in the past one year.

 The police said the Maoist action was retaliation for the killing of CPI(ML) Janashakti leader Riaz Ali Khan in June. They claimed to have arrested four of the five attackers.

 Civil rights activist and folk singer Gaddar blamed the police for the killings.

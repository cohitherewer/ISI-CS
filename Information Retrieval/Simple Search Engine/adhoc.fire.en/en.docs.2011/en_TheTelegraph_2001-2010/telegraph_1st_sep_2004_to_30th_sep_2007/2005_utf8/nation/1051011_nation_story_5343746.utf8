 RSS blows own trumpet

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: The war within the parivar, involving the RSS, the BJP and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, reflected in the annual vijayadashmi address by sarsanghachalak K.S. Sudarshan in Nagpur on Saturday.

 Meant to spell out the RSSs perspective on global and national issues for its cadre, Sudarshans speech ended as an apologia of the RSS. 

 He traced its history through the lives and times of the various sarsanghachalaks, sang paeans to them and even claimed credit for achievements generally attributed to the BJP ? in particular, the Ram rath yatra which was synonymous with the personality and politics of L.K. Advani. The subtext was nobody could and should deny the RSS its status and authority as the head of the parivar and that individuals were secondary to the organisation.

 Sudarshans message was received in the quarter it was aimed at, well before he purveyed it. 

 The BJP headquarters on the capitals Ashoka Road is shorn of pictures of the greats who ruled for decades ? Advani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and new entrant M. Venkaiah Naidu. Their portraits, which camouflaged the office structure, have been replaced with sparse posters bearing the mug of Jan Sangh founder Deen Dayal Upadhayay and the lotus symbol. 

 Upadhayay is held up by the Sangh as a perfect embodiment of commitment to ideology and organisation without allowing the personality cult to overshadow these attributes. 

 Speaking of the third chief, Balasaheb Deoras, and how the RSS percolated down to the districts, Sudarshan singled out the Ramjanmabhoomi liberation as a milestone in the RSSs history. 

 From 1983 to 1984, the Sangh launched ekaatmata yatras all over the country which revolved around the symbols of Bharatmata, Gangamata and Gaumata and created a national consciousness. In the first quarter of 1985, the Ram rath yatra became the medium of arousing an unprecedented awareness for the liberation of the Ramjanmabhoomi among people. Several people sacrificed their lives for this movement that brought about a decisive change in national politics.

 Even the Kargil victory found mention in the context of the achievements of the fourth sarsanghachalak, Rajendra Singh (Rajju Bhaiyya).

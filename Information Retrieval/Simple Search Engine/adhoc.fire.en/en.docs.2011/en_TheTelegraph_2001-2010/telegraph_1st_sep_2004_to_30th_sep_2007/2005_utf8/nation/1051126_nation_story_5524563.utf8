 Rangarajan on RS radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: C. Rangarajan, the former RBI governor and current chairman of the economic advisory council to the Prime Minister, is likely to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha, Congress sources said.

 Rangarajans possible appointment is being seen as a prelude to his induction into the Union cabinet as part of a sweeping shuffle that has been on Manmohan Singhs mind for quite some time. The revamp is expected to be carried out after the winter session of Parliament, the sources said.

 Rangarajan has a cross-party appeal and has served under the NDA government as the chairman of the finance commission, the RBI governor and the governor of Andhra Pradesh when N. Chandrababu Naidu was chief minister. The former RBI chief was reportedly considered for the finance ministers job, too.

 As the head of the economic advisory council, Rangarajan holds the rank of a cabinet minister.

 Singh is believed to have a perfect equation with the present finance minister, P. Chidambaram. However, if the changes touch the finance ministry also, Chidambaram could be considered for the home ministers job. He was a minister of state for internal security under Rajiv Gandhi.

 The incumbent home minister, Shivraj Patil, could be shifted to defence and Pranab Mukherjee could get external affairs. 

 Four nominated members in the Rajya Sabha are due to retire shortly: Lata Mangeshkar, Fali S. Nariman, Cho Ramaswamy and Nanaji Deshmukh. All four were brought in during the NDAs rule.

 Among the other names reportedly being considered for nomination to the Rajya Sabha are those of Kapila Vatsayan and a Delhi-based media baroness, whose family has close ties with the Congress for long.

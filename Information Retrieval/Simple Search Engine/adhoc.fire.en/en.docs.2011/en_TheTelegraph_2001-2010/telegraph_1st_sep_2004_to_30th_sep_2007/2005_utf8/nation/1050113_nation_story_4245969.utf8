 HC bars poll gun show 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Jan. 12: Patna High Court today instructed the Bihar home commissioner and director-general of police to ensure that candidates and their supporters did not carry weapons during the election campaign and the nomination process.

 ?Any show of strength during the nomination or campaign process should not be allowed. It does not induce an atmosphere conducive to free, fair and fearless elections,? a division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai observed. 

 The court also directed the state authorities to brief the officials concerned on today?s directive and ruled that any such offence in a police station will make the officer-in-charge culpable and subject to action. ?If any person is found carrying a licensed weapon, it should be seized and the licence cancelled,? it further ruled. 

 M.P. Gupta, who has taken up the case of behalf of the Indian Medical Association, said both the court and the state have to act tough to make the elections ?free, fair and fearless?. 

 ?Politics here is generally controlled by muscle power and an election is a battle of bullets, not ballots,? he said. The next hearing of will take place after a week. 

 In another development, the government has started the process of installing mobile phone jammers at Beur Central Jail here.

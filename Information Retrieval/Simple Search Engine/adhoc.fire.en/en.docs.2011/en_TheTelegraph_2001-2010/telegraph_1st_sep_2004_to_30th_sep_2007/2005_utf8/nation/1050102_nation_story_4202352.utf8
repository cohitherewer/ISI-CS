 Officers opt for island duty 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: The Centre will fly out over a dozen bureaucrats and police officers to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands over the next two days to strengthen the administration in the ravaged Union territory. 

 Most of them, including IAS officers A. Majumdar and Ashwani Kumar, have volunteered to assist in executing the relief operations. ?All of them have served in the islands earlier and know the place well,? said home secretary Dhirendra Singh. 

 The list includes three officers just back from a stint on the islands and four others who have been posted in the Andamans but have not been relieved. An additional secretary in the home ministry said they were being flown out as ?they have a deeper knowledge of the area and the population?. 

 The toll in the tsunami tragedy in India has gone up to 8,955 and the number of those missing to 3,872, mostly in the Andamans, according to official figures released here today. 

 Though relief and rehabilitation work in the Andamans is progressing at a ?vigorous pace?, the problem of communication between the islands and the mainland would ease with teams carrying satellite phones leaving for faraway destinations as Katchal, Kamrota, Teressa, Champin and Hut Bay Islands, said A.K. Rastogi, secretary, disaster management. 

 ?The aboriginal Jarawa tribals based in the middle and south Andamans are safe in their habitat,? he said. Their population, which was 240 in the 2001 census, had increased to 266, he added. 

 But there was no official report so far about the Shompens, who had been spotted during aerial surveys in recent days. They had a recorded population of 398 in 2001.

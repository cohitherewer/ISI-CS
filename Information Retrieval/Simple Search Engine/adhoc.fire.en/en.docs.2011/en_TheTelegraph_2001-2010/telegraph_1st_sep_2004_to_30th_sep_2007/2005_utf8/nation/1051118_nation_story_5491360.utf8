 Special status on cards for Darjeeling 

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The Centre is set to give Sixth Schedule status to the Darjeeling Hills in a bid to find a permanent solution to the vexed issue of Gorkhaland. 

 Sources said the West Bengal government, which had reservations, has finally agreed to the demand made by Subash Ghisingh, the caretaker chairman of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC). 

 A memorandum of settlement is likely to be signed at a tripartite meeting between Union home minister Shivraj Patil, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Ghisingh on November 29.

 The Centre has also agreed to include some parts of Siliguri sub-division in the area that would come under the Sixth Schedule. The existing district of Darjeeling will have to be reorganised.

 These were the two main demands put forward by Ghisingh. Both have been accepted after a lot of resistance from the West Bengal government that was ready to provide constitutional guarantee to the council under Article 371, said a source. 

 Union home secretary V.K. Duggal did not spell out the provisions of the settlement, but he acknowledged that the Centre is seriously considering giving Sixth Schedule status to the areas falling under the DGHCs jurisdiction.

 Under the Constitution, Sixth Schedule status can be given only to Northeastern states. A two-thirds majority in Parliament will be needed to amend the Constitution and bring areas in Bengal under its purview. Also, the government is considering Scheduled Tribe status to some Gorkhas because Sixth Schedule can be invoked only in those areas with a majority tribal population. The Darjeeling Hills has a tribal population of 32 per cent. 

 Sources said the bureaucracy was against giving in to Ghisinghs demand but ultimately the political writ prevailed. A section of the bureaucracy believes that bringing the Hills under the Sixth Schedule would give rise to similar demands not only from areas like Cooch Behar, Bankura and Purulia in West Bengal, where there is a substantial tribal population, but also from several tribal-rich areas in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Orissa. 

 Patil, the sources said, was told about the possible fallout but he still wants to go ahead.

 Though the final picture of the upcoming autonomous area falling and the powers given to it is yet to emerge, sources said it would be more or less similar to the arrangement reached with the Bodoland autonomous council in Assam. 

 Provisions under the Sixth Schedule give the autonomous council several rights relating to economic activities, education, promoting linguistic aspirations of the tribe and ethnic identity of the tribal population of the area. It also gives certain legislative powers to the autonomous council.

 The status also empowers the council to set up an executive of at least 12 members and state cabinet minister status to the chairman and deputy chairman of the executive council. The executive council will have the powers to transfer and appoint officers. 

 The district magistrate and superintendent of police, however, will not be under the control of the executive council.

 Armed four in Bangla net 

 FARID HOSSAIN

 Dhaka, July 16: Police in Bangladesh today questioned four Indians who were arrested for allegedly trying to sneak into the country with arms and ammunition.

 We have handed the four men to police who are interrogating them, said Lt Col Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy of Bangladesh Rifles, when asked if men are suspected to be insurgents.

 We will know details about the men after the questioning by police, he said.

 The four men, believed to be from Meghalayas Khasi tribe, were arrested by BDR guards yesterday when they were allegedly trying to enter Bangladesh through the Atgram border in Sylhet. 

 Three grenades, three firearms, including an AK-47 assault rifle, two 9 mm pistols, three magazines and 328 bullets of 9 mm pistols, four magazines and 316 bullets of the AK-47 rifle and some Indian and Bangladeshi currency were seized from them, a BDR release said. 

 The grenades are of Chinese make, which are not available in Bangladesh.

 The men have been identified as Robin, 28, Mortar, 26, Obar, 29, and Meel, 24. 

 In May, six suspected insurgents were killed in a shootout with Bangladesh security forces. 

 A month later, a joint team of army and police raided a hideout and arrested nine persons from Manipur suspected to be linked with an insurgent group.

 Bangladesh has consistently denied allegations that it allows Northeast insurgents to use its territory in their fight against Indian forces.

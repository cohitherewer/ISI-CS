 Shah Bano spectre in Imrana storm

 OUR BUREAU 

 Lucknow/New Delhi, June 29: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today backed the controversial fatwa annulling the marriage of Imrana, who was raped by her father-in-law.

 The Samajwadi Party chiefs stand, which set the stage for the tragedy to be politicised, bore echoes of the way the Rajiv Gandhi government had kowtowed to Muslim clerics in the Shah Bano case two decades ago.

 The decision of the Muslim religious leaders (of the Darul Uloom of Deoband) in the Imrana case must have been taken after a lot of thought, Mulayam Singh told reporters in Lucknow. The religious leaders are all very learned and they understand the Muslim community and its sentiments.

 The chief ministers remarks came after the state womens commission wrote to him, asking him to step in and grant the 28-year-old mother of five permission to stay with her husband.

 Imrana was raped at her home in Muzaffarnagar early this month, following which she was asked to quit her village by local Muslim leaders. 

 The local panchayat issued a fatwa saying her relations with her husband were automatically terminated, for she had become a sort of mother to him.

 Imrana and her husband Noor Ilahi defied the fatwa till the powerful Deoband theologians yesterday passed theirs. Now she finds herself virtually on the streets.

 The Congress, still haunted by the Shah Bano case of the mid-eighties ? when it used its overwhelming majority in Parliament to pass a bill that overturned a Supreme Court judgment and denied alimony to divorced Muslim women ? has played it safe. The party has said the matter is best left to the judiciary.

 We believe the process of the countrys law should not clash with any personal law of any community. If it did, the law of the country will prevail, state Congress chief Salman Khursheed said.

 The BJP today sought to draw mileage from the discomfiture of the Congress, accusing it of playing vote-bank politics. The party has again raised the demand for a common civil code.

 The CPM, the Congresss ally at the Centre, has demanded a crackdown on the panchayats that are playing with the lives of the rural poor. Its general secretary, Prakash Karat, condemned the fatwas against Imrana as a serious violation of human rights and the law.

 If the personal law of any community infringes on the rights of women, the law of the land should take centre stage and impart justice, Karat said.

 The National Commission for Women will start a camp in Muzaffarnagar tomorrow.

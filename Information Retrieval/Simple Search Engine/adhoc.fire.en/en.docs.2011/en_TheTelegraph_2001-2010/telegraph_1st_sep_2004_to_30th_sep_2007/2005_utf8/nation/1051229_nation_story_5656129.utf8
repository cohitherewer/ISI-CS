 Award winner bats for village kids

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: One of Indias leading mathematicians plans to donate close to a quarter million dollars to help bright village children get into the countrys top scientific institutions.

 His motivation: his own disadvantaged background. His inspiration: a former Test cricketer.

 Dr M.S. Narsimhan, who lived as a boy in a village 50 km from Chennai, will receive a cash award of $200,000 ? one of the biggest in science ? having jointly won the King Faisal International Prize for 2006.

 The honorary fellow at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, is sharing the prize with Simon Kirwan Donaldson, a Fields Medal winner from the UK, for their path-breaking work in linking mathematics and physics.

 The 73-year-olds mind, however, is less on the prize and more on how he can use it to attract young minds from villages towards science and mathematics.

 I was born in a small village. I had to travel by bullock cart for two hours every day to go to school. I want to use my prize money to take science to the villages so that more youngsters are attracted towards the field, he said.

 His own village, however, is not his only target. My concern is with the future of India, and science in this country. In whichever part of India the project works out, we would begin there, he said.

 Narsimhan has already begun looking for a network of NGOs working in the field of education among villagers, which would take this project to the next step. These voluntary organisations will then identify the brightest students in the villages they work in. We will then focus on providing these children all the facilities that children in the cities take for granted.

 The mathematician says he got his idea after learning about the way former India player Brijesh Patel scouted for talent across rural Karnataka. 

 Narsimhan, who at the invitation of Nobel laureate Abdus Salam had set up the mathematics department at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, feels that few youngsters in India want to take up science.

 The middle classes are moving away from science to professions they consider more lucrative, he said.

 Narsimhan, who will also receive a certificate ? done in Arabic calligraphy ? summarising his work and a commemorative 24-carat, 200-gm gold medal, said he only wanted to keep the certificate. The medal and the cash award would fund the project.

 This prize is recognition not only of my achievements but of the strides made by Indians in the world of science. It belongs to the country, he said.

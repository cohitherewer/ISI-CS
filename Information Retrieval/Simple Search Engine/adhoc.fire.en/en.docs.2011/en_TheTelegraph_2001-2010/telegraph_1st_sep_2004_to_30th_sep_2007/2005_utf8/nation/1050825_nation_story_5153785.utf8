 Priyas Dhaka date put off

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: Water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshis proposed trip to Dhaka this month end stands postponed after days of flip-flops by the government here. 

 The minister was to be in the Bangladesh capital for the joint river commission meeting scheduled for August 30 and 31. 

 But the visit has been called off citing extension of the Parliament session. New Delhi has told Dhaka that it will work out the new dates for the meeting shortly.

 The real reason for calling off the visit appears to be the recent countrywide bomb blasts in Bangladesh. Sources said till the dust settles down it is better to keep such visits on hold.

 Last weeks blasts in 63 of 64 districts in Bangladesh by a suspected Islamic fundamentalist outfit have raised serious concerns in India. 

 Delhi is worried about the fallout of such a well co-ordinated operation not only within Bangladesh but also about its likely effect on the Indian side as the two countries share more than 4,000 km of porous border.

 Delhis greater worry is how seriously the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led government in Dhaka will tackle the crisis. On several occasions India warned the Khaleda Zia government about the unfettered rise of fundamentalist organisations in that country. But steps taken by the government have not impressed Delhi.

 Despite its concerns, the Indian policy now seems not to criticise the Khaleda Zia government too sharply in public. The European Union and the US have also adopted a similar approach as they have publicly offered solidarity with the BNP coalition in Dhaka at this juncture.

 The fact that Delhi has decided not to aggravate the situation in Bangladesh became clear from its measured response to the accusations hurled by the Bangladeshi industries minister recently. 

 When the minister, a senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami which is a partner in the BNP-led government, accused India of being involved in the blasts, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna retaliated, saying: The Government of India strongly rejects the allegations contained in these statements and expresses its deep concern that a senior minister of the Bangladesh government should have made such unfounded and irresponsible statements. 

 Statements of this kind undermine efforts to promote the friendly and good neighbourly relations between Bangladesh and India, he added.

 Despite this stand, India may not miss an opportunity of signalling to Bangladesh that its government needs to pursue a sustained policy to counter fundamentalist forces. 

 Indian officials take solace from the fact that the Bangladeshi media appears to have launched a sustained campaign against the lack of action by the government to counter the Islamic forces.

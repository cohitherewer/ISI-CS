 Bloodspill in Allahabad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 25: Gunshots shattered the surface calm of an Allahabad locality and terror took its place as armed men today shot dead a BSP legislator and two others returning home after a coffee break.

 First-time MLA Raju Pal and his wife, accompanied by four BSP workers, had gone for coffee in the afternoon to a joint in the Civil Lines area. As their Bolero turned into Nehru Park, six waiting gunmen sprayed a volley of bullets at their vehicle, catching them totally unawares.

 Pal, the legislator from Allahabad (West), and two of his colleagues were fatally wounded and died on their way to hospital. Pal?s wife and two others are in S.R.N. Hospital in critical condition.

 The daylight murder, coming on the heels of the killing of two villagers by a dacoit in Farukkabad, spread panic in Dhoomanganj police station area. Shops downed shutters and vehicles went off the roads, fearing violence would erupt in the area known to have communally sensitive pockets. Police began patrolling the streets to calm the people. 

 Political rivals too began to trade fire, with the BSP alleging the Samajwadi Party had killed Pal to settle political scores. In an October bypoll, Pal had defeated a Samajwadi Party candidate who is the brother of a don-turned-MP Atiq Ahmed, also from the same party.

 Pal?s relatives told the police he had been receiving death threats from Ahmed of late. Local sources confirmed the enmity between the BSP leaders and Ahmed, who has been the legislator from Allahabad (West) for three terms.

 ?Atiq and his men were clearly trying to wrest control over the (Allahabad West) seat,? BSP legislature party chief S.P. Maurya said.

 The Congress gunned for the Mulayam Singh government, saying it had lost control over law and order. Those supposed to be running the government were busy enjoying themselves at a festival in the chief minister?s village while people were getting killed, it alleged. 

 Uttar Pradesh unit chief Salman Khursheed warned the party would take to the streets ?if law and order did not improve by February?.

 State home secretary Pradip Bhatnagar said ?personal vendetta? appeared to be behind the murder of the MLA, who had a criminal record. ?We have begun a probe and the motive will be clear only after investigations are over. At present, we are busy trying to get life back to normal,? he said.

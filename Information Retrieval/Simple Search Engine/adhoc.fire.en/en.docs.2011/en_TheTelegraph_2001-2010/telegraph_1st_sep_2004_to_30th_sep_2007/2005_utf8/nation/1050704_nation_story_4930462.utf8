 Its safer than Indore, says tourist in Srinagar

 Switzerland of the East

 Srinagar, July 3 (Reuters): Rajni Patil waited 16 years to see what poets have described as paradise on earth.

 It is a dream come true, gushed the 45-year-old housewife from Madhya Pradesh, standing on the banks of Srinagars Dal Lake. After a long wait I am finally in Kashmir.

 Militancy kept tourists away from Kashmir for years, but the thaw in India-Pakistan relations is bringing them back.

 Behind Patil and her husband, on a lake ringed by snow-capped mountains, tourists glide by on shikaras. Hundreds of hand-carved pinewood houseboats dot the water.

 People in India and abroad have a wrong notion about this piece of heaven that it is not safe. I feel it is safer than Indore, said Patil, referring to her home city.

 About 1,86,670 tourists, mostly from other parts of northern India, visited Kashmir in the first five months of this year, compared with 98,613 in the same period last year, tourism officials said.

 Kashmir was once a top Asian tourism destination, popular among honeymooners, skiers, trekkers and anglers, and attracting about a million tourists a year until 1989.

 We hope God has pitied us and good days are ahead. If the peace process continues, Kashmir will be flooded (with tourists), said Ali Mohammad, a houseboat owner in his office near the rubble of Kashmirs main tourist reception centre.

 My houseboat is booked for the next three months.

 The tourism centre was stormed by militants on April 6, a day before the historic bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad was scheduled to begin.

 I hope improving relations between India and Pakistan will boost tourism in Kashmir, said Ghulam Hassan Mir, Kashmirs tourism minister.

 As tourism slowly revives, authorities have moved more than 800 soldiers out of seven hotels that became security camps near Dal Lake during the militancy. Many more hotels remain occupied by soldiers and other security agencies.

 Intelligence officials say militants, angered by the peace process, may resort to more violence. Recently, 14 people were killed and at least 100 wounded when a car bomb exploded near a school in a town in south Kashmir.

 Most western countries still caution citizens against travelling to Kashmir, sometimes called the Switzerland of the East for its ice-capped mountain peaks. Five western tourists disappeared in Kashmir in 1995 while on a trek and are presumed dead.

 Since then, authorities refuse to lift a ban on trekking in the region. But anglers have begun hunting for trout in the snow-fed streams.

 I decided several times to visit Kashmir but violence always scared me. Things are far better here than we have heard, said Sanjeev Mahjan, a 55-year-old doctor.

 Mehbooba Mufti, the chief of Kashmirs ruling Peoples Democratic Party, is cautiously optimistic that peace will hold and the tourists will return.

 Our progress up to this point has also been fraught with numerous odds ... What looked impossible yesterday is beginning to look as near-certainty today, she said from her heavily-guarded house. 

 The thaw has just set in.

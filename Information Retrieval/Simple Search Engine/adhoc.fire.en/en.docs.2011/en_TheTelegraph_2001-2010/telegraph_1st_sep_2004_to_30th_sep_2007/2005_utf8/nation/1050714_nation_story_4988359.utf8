 Lucknow, July 13: The Sunni Wakf boards ruling that Taj Mahal is the communitys property has pitted the Centre against the Uttar Pradesh government ? especially minister Azam Khan, the aggressive face of the states Muslim leadership.

 The Union human resource development ministry is learnt to have okayed the Archaeological Survey of Indias decision to appeal against the Wakf board order in Allahabad High Court. 

 Khan, who has been trying to get the Taj declared Sunni property for two decades, is likely to be in the thick of the next round of the legal battle, too.

 The state minister for parliamentary affairs had been the first to officially support petitioner Mohammed Irfan Bedar, who had approached Allahabad High Court in November 2004 with an appeal to list the Taj as Wakf property.

 The high court had sent the petition back to the Wakf board which, though an autonomous body, is packed with members loyal to Khan.

 Board chairman Hafiz Usman did not hide this today. In reply to a reporters question, he acknowledged: I am an Azam Khan man.

 The battle for the Taj has its roots in a perceived snub by the Centre to the state during the celebration of the monuments 350 years. 

 Put off by the state governments effort to take complete control of the event, the Centre decided not to send any minister or senior official to the programme at Agra last November. Instead, the Centre held a parallel function where it released a postage stamp on the Taj.

 Khan was also upset when the ASI turned down the Agra Development Authoritys (ADAs) demand for an increased share of revenue after night viewing of the Taj kicked off. The ADA comes under Khan, who is also the urban development minister.

 In the mid-eighties, Khan had moved a petition before the Wakf board seeking permission to act as a caretaker for the Taj on the ground that it was legally Sunni property.

 Till now, the state Congress had chosen to ignore Khans campaign, with its president, Salman Khursheed, laughing it off as a wild goose chase. 

 After todays decision, spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh said: It (the board order) is a clear sign of arm-twisting. The party plans to hit the streets on the issue.

 Khan knows that the high court or the Supreme Court might quash the boards order, but the battle will help him gain the respect of the hardline clerics in Agra and his constituency, Rampur.

 He must be peeved that some of his colleagues are not supporting him. Tourism minister Khokub Hamid, for instance, dubbed the board order the wrong way to go about a heritage.

 But as long as chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav stays silent and continues to give him a free hand on minority affairs, Khan knows theres nothing to worry.

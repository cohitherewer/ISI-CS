 Kalam for police reform 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Oct. 15: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has set out a new agenda for the police force, which, he said, has failed to protect the common man.

 Our police force needs to be friendly, corruption-free and responsible, the President said today at the National Police Academy here. The police should take care of people and remain robust ? mentally and physically, he added.

 The force has failed to check kidnaps, extortion and atrocities on women and poor and lower caste people, Kalam said, referring to scores of e-mails and petitions he has received on how the police system has been deteriorating.

 The Presidents suggestion to improve efficiency and transparency included augmenting the force to achieve the police-people ratio of at least 1:500, continuous skill upgradation to make personnel people-friendly, improving service conditions and adopting modern technologies.

 The accountability should always flow from the top to the level of police constable to meet the high expectations of the people, he said.

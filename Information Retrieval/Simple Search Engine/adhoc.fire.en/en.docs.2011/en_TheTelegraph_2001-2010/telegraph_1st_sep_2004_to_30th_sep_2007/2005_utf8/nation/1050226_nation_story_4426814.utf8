 Rail budget boycott

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 V.K. Malhotra

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: The NDA has decided to boycott the presentation of the railway budget in the Lok Sabha tomorrow by Laloo Prasad Yadav to step up its offensive against the presence of ?tainted? ministers in the government.

 The boycott decision was taken at a meeting of coalition leaders chaired by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ?As soon as he (Laloo Prasad) rises to present the budget, the NDA members will walk out,? said V.K. Malhotra, the BJP?s chief whip in the Lok Sabha and its parliamentary party spokesperson.

 However, Malhotra clarified that there would be no attempt to disrupt proceedings and the NDA would participate in the discussions on the railway budget that would follow.

 The BJP leader said the boycott was in keeping with the NDA stand that the ?tainted? ministers in the Manmohan Singh cabinet ? all incidentally from the Rashtriya Janata Dal ? must be dropped.

 At the ?very least?, Malhotra said, the NDA wanted a ?threadbare? discussion on the issue in Parliament so that the Congress?s position is ?made clear?. ?There is nothing exceptional about our demand because even the Supreme Court has directed the Centre to allow Parliament to take a view on the subject,? he said.

 The BJP leader said if the railway minister tabled the U.C. Banerjee interim report on the Godhra carnage in the Lok Sabha, the NDA would ask for a discussion on this and the findings of the Nanavati Commission, which also probed the tragedy but came up with substantively different data.

 The NDA had boycotted the last railway budget presentation by Laloo Prasad, as well as questions related to his ministry. They only sat through a statement he made on a rail accident in Punjab on the plea that they had ?insisted? on it.

 The NDA will also move an adjournment motion on March 1 to protest the ?undemocratic? dismissal of the BJP government in Goa by governor S.C. Jamir. Malhotra maintained that all the BJP?s allies, including the Telugu Desam Party, supported it on this.

 The BJP has already served a notice in the Lok Sabha Speaker?s office for a discussion on the ?tainted? ministers under rule 184, which entails a division of votes. Among the other subjects on which the NDA has sought a discussion are tsunami, the arrest of the Kanchi acharyas, the Indo-Pak peace dialogue and atrocities against women, Dalits and tribals.

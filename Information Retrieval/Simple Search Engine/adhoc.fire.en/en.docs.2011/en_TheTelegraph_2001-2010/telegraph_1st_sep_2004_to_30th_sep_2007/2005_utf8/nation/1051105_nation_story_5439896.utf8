The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 ?turns to Sonia 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: Natwar Singh may survive his hour of crisis as Sonia Gandhi, erring on the side of extreme caution, is believed to be opposed to his exit from the government over the Volcker report allegations. 

 The Congress chiefs defence of a beleaguered Natwar is widely believed to have prevailed in the midst of an emerging view of asking the external affairs minister to quit as his name figures as a non-contracting beneficiary of the UN oil-for-food programme in Saddam Husseins Iraq. 

 Natwar is understood to have taken up his case with Sonia during the past three days, complaining that he was not getting the expected backing from the party at a time when the opposition BJP was stepping up its demand for his exit. He also approached Left leaders to win their backing. 

 His anger at his party, particularly some senior colleagues, is not just over the seeming failure to defend him while repeatedly rejecting outright the Congress party being named also as a non-contracting beneficiary in the report. 

 On three occasions over the last five days, the party has officially reacted ? first through a statement by media department chairperson Ambika Soni, then spokesman Anand Sharma and yesterday a written statement. 

 On all three instances, the defence was confined to the party and did not include Natwar. Individuals are competent to defend themselves was the refrain each time. 

 While Natwar is known to suspect a conspiracy to get rid of him, using the Volcker report, there is a powerful section which believes he has put the Congress in an embarrassing position. This group is certain the party had no role in the oil-for-food programme. 

 There are enough hints in the conviction that, if indeed the allegations are true, someone from the Congress might have received the benefits, using the partys name. 

 Support from Sonia and the Left may mean Natwar will retain his position and get the chance he wants ? to give his version through a suo motu statement in Parliament.

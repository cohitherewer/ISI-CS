The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Museum in House, with help from city 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: A world-class hi-tech museum with effective communication techniques will come up on the Parliament premises with assistance from the Indian Museum in Calcutta.

 Two experts ? Saroj Ghose, former president of the International Council of Museums in Unesco, Paris, and a retired director-general of the National Council of Science Museums in India, and S.S. Biswas, a member of the Calcutta museum ? have been roped in for the project. 

 The Rs 3.5-crore museum and archives ? a brainchild of Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee ? would be housed in Parliament?s library building. 

 Ghose made a presentation to the Speaker on January 27 and a final presentation will be made on March 31. The museum will be operational from August 15, 2006, Parliament sources said. 

 It will have animatronics (animation through gizmos) while viewers can have a feel of virtual reality. For instance, if they are watching Dandi March, they, too, will feel they are walking with Mahatma Gandhi.

 Among interesting subjects the museum will have in store will be democratic heritage, legislation in British India, the freedom movement, national leaders, transfer of power, the Constitution of India, parliamentary procedure (meant specially for first-time MPs and journalists), election process, the Parliament building and patriotic songs in all languages.

 Spread over 1,150 square metres, the hi-tech museum will also have rooms for screening short films and facilities for audio-visual presentations.

 Chatterjee said the museum would be of immense use to people, students, parliamentarians and journalists. ?They (visitors) should come out with respect for the institution,? he said. 

 Inadequate utilisation of the massive library complex, built at a cost of Rs 200 crore, spurred the Speaker think of setting up the museum. 

 The building, conceived by an earlier Congress regime and completed when the National Democratic Alliance was in power, has a number of auditoriums. The library and the research sections have already been shifted to the building.

 Former Speaker Rabi Ray had inaugurated a museum on December 29, 1989, but after 1992, it was not in use any more.

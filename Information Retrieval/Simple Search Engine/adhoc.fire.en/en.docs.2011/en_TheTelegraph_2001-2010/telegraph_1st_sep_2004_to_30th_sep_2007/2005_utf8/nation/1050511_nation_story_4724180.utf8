 Steve plots cricket city in Mumbai

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, May 10: Steve Tugga Waugh is in Mumbai. Not to compete with fellow Aussies Greg Chappell and Tom Moody for the job of Team India coach. But to start a cricket township, complete with a cricket academy and a residential complex.

 Waugh led a six-member trade delegation 

 to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh this afternoon with 

 a proposal for the cricket city and an entertainment park 

 in Mumbai. 

 He was accompanied by officials of a private bank which he endorses as a brand ambassador, and officials from the Australian Trade Commission.

 The delegation told Deshmukh they wanted the cricket township either in the heart of Mumbai or in suburban Navi Mumbai.

 The team and state government officials discussed possible sites, such as a vacant 600-acre plot belonging to a textile mill.

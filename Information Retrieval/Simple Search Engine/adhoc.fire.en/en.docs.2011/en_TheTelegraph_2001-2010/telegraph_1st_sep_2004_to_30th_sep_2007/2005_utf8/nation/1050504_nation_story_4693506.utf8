 Air force officer skips hearing

 Bangalore: An indisposed Flying Officer 

 Anjali Gupta did not show up at the general court martial 

 on Tuesday, prompting an adjournment of the sitting to Wednesday, 

 reports our special correspondent.

 On Wednesday, the officer will be sent for a medical examination and an expert opinion on her fitness to attend the court martial. She fell ill and retched a couple of times in the court hall on Monday.

 Her fitness was the focus of brief arguments between the prosecution and the defending officer when the general court martial waited on Tuesday morning for Gupta to turn up for the hearing.

 The prosecution, represented by Wing Commander R.D. Dubey, charged that the flying officer was feigning illness to delay the trial. ?She is trying to look gloomy, she?s trying to gain the sympathy of the court,? Dubey told the court.

 The defending officer, Wing Commander Vijay 

 Bhupesh, said: ?Whether she is acting or not will be revealed 

 in the medical report.?

 The presiding officer, Group Captain V. Ganesh, asked the prosecution to hand over the medical report to the court on Wednesday.

 Gadget boon for disabled

 Hyderabad (PTI): Four army engineers 

 have made a motorised wheelchair for physically-challenged 

 people as part of their project work, which was adjudged 

 the best in both the mechanical and electronics streams 

 in an engineering course.

 Manish Gulia, Rahul Kumar Gupta, Harsh V. Srivastava and Manoj K. Jamwal ? all majors ? completed the project in six months. The wheelchair costs Rs 1.20 lakh whereas a similar gadget will cost about Rs 5 lakh in the market as no Indian company manufactures automated wheelchairs, defence sources said.

 The four engineers have just completed the 77th degree engineering course at the Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering, Secunderabad.

 The project was supervised by Lt Col Atul Apte, who said the MWC Mark II ?was capable of negotiating small steps?.

 ?It is a four-wheel drive with a controller keyboard that enables forward and reverse motion, speed variation, effective steering by joystick and even a horn on board,? Apte said.

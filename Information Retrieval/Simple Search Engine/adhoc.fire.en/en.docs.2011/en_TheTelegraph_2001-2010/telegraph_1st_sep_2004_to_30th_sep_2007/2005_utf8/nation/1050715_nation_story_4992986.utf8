 Rent does not add to lease life: SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 14: Acceptance of rent after the expiry of lease period does not mean the lease has automatically got renewed, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 On the expiry of the period of lease, mere acceptance of rent for the subsequent months when a tenant continues to occupy the premises cannot be said to be a conduct signifying assent to the continuance of the lease, a bench of Justices D.M. Dharmadhikari and B.N. Srikrishna said.

 The ruling came on an appeal filed by Shanti Prasad Devi, who runs a petrol pump. The pump owner had ignored her legal notice for continuation of the lease when it expired. But Shanti stayed put on the premises and her landlord continued to accept rent.

 Shanti moved court, saying acceptance of rent after the expiry of the lease period amounted to giving consent to continuance of the lease.

 The apex court dismissed her petition and gave her a grace period of two months to vacate the premises. It also directed her to file an undertaking to hand over its possession within the specified period. 

 The apex court said the two-month period was a reasonable one for Shanti to find suitable alternative premises. She was also told to pay rent arrears, if any, for the total period of occupation of the property beyond the lease period.

 The pump owner had neither agreed to renew the lease nor implied that he would do so, Justice Dharmadhikari, writing the judgment for the bench, said. 

 According to the original contract, a renewal has to follow a specific procedure on mutually agreed terms, he added.

 This mode of renewal constitutes a valid condition under Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act, the judge said.

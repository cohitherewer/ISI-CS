 Family doctor course in pipeline 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: A family medicine course to start from June has been announced in keeping with the Centre?s efforts to improve the healthcare system, especially for the urban and rural poor.

 ?As a country, we need basic doctors to follow up on the Rural Health Mission announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,? A. Rajasekaran, the president of the National Board of Examinations, said while making the announcement on Saturday.

 He was referring to the mission announced last month that aims to extend basic health services to villages through a trained cadre of health workers.

 ?Family physicians form the backbone of any health delivery system and we need plenty of such doctors if we are to ensure that healthcare improves,? Rajasekaran added.

 The new postgraduate course will last three years. Part-time courses will also be on offer for working doctors, who will have to train for 20 hours a week.

 Young doctors will thus get a chance to understand the importance of practising holistic medicine.

 Rajasekaran said the current undergraduate curriculum and the internship period were inadequate to turn out well-rounded doctors. Nearly all medical graduates went on to specialise, he added. 

 The family medicine course would help those who want to have overall knowledge of all major branches, the board chief said.

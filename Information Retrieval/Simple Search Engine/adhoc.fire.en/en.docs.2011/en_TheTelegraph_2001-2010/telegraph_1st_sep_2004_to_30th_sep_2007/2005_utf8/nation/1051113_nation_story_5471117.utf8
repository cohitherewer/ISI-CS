 Hyderabad, Nov. 12: Monica Bedi was remanded in judicial custody till November 25 after a CBI designated court in Hyderabad rejected the bureaus plea for police custody this afternoon.

 Turned out in white shirt and blue jeans, with a blue scarf hiding her face, Monica was taken to appear before designated judge C.V. Subramanyam from the CBI complex in Sultan Bazar where she spent the night in a guest room.

 Dal and rice were served for dinner, an official said, adding that the actor-turned-gangsters moll watched the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Don on TV before going to bed. One local channel has been showing Bachchan hits but it is not known if the 1977 film in which he plays an underworld don was beamed last night.

 She cooperated with the CBI, answering some questions last night as well as this morning after breakfast, the official added. It was not an interrogation but a general chat and she was very comfortable in answering most of our posers, he said.

 However, the companion of Bombay blasts accused Abu Salem, who has been brought to the city in connection with a fake passport case, refused to be formally interrogated till her lawyers arrived. She was allowed to make one or two calls to her advocates and Salem during the two hours she spent at the CBI complex after breakfast, sources said.

 Before being taken to court, Monica asked for time to pray and said her prayers in a corner of the room. 

 Monica Bedi is an associate of Abu Salem and should not bear the brunt of his crimes, said .A. Siddiqui, her advocate who had flown in from Mumbai to defend her.

 She has been moved to Chanchalguda womens jail for the remand. In judicial custody, a suspect is the jailers responsibility and this ensures that the threat of torture is less than in police custody when the interrogation can be held at any place of the investigators choice. Monicas bail plea is expected to be moved on Monday.

 She has been accused of giving a false name, Sana Malik Kamal, and address to secure a passport in 2001.

 Siddiqui travelled with her to the jail and spent a few minutes with her, advising her not to speak to anyone without a tape recorder or witnesses. Six bags of her clothes were brought to the jail, sources said. At the CBI complex, she had refused the toothbrush and toiletries offered to her because she was carrying her own.

 Local TV channels reeled out clippings from her little-known films and journalists kept vigil at the CBI complex and the designated court since morning.

 A police commando on duty at the CBI office fractured his left leg as cameramen jostled to capture the shot when Monica was being taken to the special court.

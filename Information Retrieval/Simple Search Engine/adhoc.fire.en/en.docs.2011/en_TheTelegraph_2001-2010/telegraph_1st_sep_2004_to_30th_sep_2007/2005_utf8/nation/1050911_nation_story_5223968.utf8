The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 $4 billion and thank you for France

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: A $2-billion deal with Airbus in the bag and with another $2 billion in his pocket to buy Scorpene submarines, a confident Manmohan Singh leaves for Paris tomorrow to tell the French how much India values their friendship.

 Airbus, a European consortium, has been engaged in a battle with its US rival, Boeing, for a major share of Indias commercial air fleet contracts. France not only has major stakes in Airbus but has also been keen to sell Scorpene submarines to India for some years now.

 The Prime Minister will also assure the French government that its companies will get a fair share of the Indian nuclear civilian energy pie, and that there is scope for the two countries to strengthen trade and economic ties.

 Singhs visit to France ? as a stopover on his way to New York for the UN General Assembly ? is as political as it is driven by economic logic.

 Many eyebrows have been raised in India over the growing Indo-US ties. The nuclear deal signed by Singh and Bush in July has fuelled fears among some ruling alliance partners that Delhi might now lose its sovereignty.

 The French, too, have been apprehensive that Washington might soon push out all others from the growing Indian market.

 By turning a scheduled technical halt in Paris into a full-fledged official visit, the Prime Minister has signalled that Delhi, despite its keenness to strengthen ties with the US, is not prepared to dump other allies.

 Singhs will be the first visit to France by an Indian Prime Minister in seven years; but the two sides have continued to engage with each other in many fields and at various levels.

 On September 12, when Singh meets the French leadership ? including President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin ? he will be able to tell them how much he appreciates Frances move to deepen strategic ties with India.

 The Prime Minister will also address CEOs of leading French companies to ensure more investment into India.

 France has been a close partner of India, foreign secretary Shyam Saran said. France has been more amenable to Indias needs than many others.

 France was the only country in the West not to castigate India after the May 1998 nuclear tests. Rather, the French leadership helped block several sanctions on India.

 The Prime Minister and his aides will take this opportunity of re-affirming Indias close ties with France. They will also grab the chance to discuss the Indo-US nuclear deal and its implications.

 France, like the US and UK, is a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. It may not have imposed sanctions on India but it needs to use its influence on the others in the group to ensure that Indias access to civilian nuclear and dual-use technologies is not blocked.

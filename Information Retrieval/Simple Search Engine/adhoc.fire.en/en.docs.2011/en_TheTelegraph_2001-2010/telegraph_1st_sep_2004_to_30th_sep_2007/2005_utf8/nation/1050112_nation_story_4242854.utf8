 Cong, Laloo in seat talks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Keeping up the pressure on Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav for a fair seat deal in Bihar, the Congress brought in state party unit chief Ram Jatan Sinha to join Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh at the negotiating table tonight.

 Having already pitched for a share of 75 of the 243 Assembly seats, the Congress negotiators circumvented the railway minister?s bid to hold a meeting with party chief Sonia Gandhi late this evening ahead of his scheduled talks with Singh. 

 Sources in the Congress said Laloo Prasad was told that the meeting was not possible as Sonia had just returned to her residence after a two-day visit to Rae Bareli. 

 The sources did not expect tonight?s meeting to yield a conclusive agreement though Laloo Prasad expressed optimism before going for the talks.

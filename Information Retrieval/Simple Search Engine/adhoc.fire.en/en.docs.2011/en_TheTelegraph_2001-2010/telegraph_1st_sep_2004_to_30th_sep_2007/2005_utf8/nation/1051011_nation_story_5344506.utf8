 Muzaffarabad, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Sikander Hayat Khan says he is the prime minister of a graveyard, surveying his ruined capital from a tent where he has slept since the weekend quake destroyed towns and villages across Pakistan Kashmir.

 Critics say the prime minister 

 of Pakistan Kashmir is little more than Islamabads 

 puppet, but that does not lessen Khans sense of responsibility 

 for his people in the aftermath of the catastrophe.

 Its the biggest natural disaster. It has totally paralysed Kashmir, he said in the tent on the lawn of his official residence in the small city of Muzaffarabad.

 For the first two days we have been either digging ground to recover bodies or digging to bury them. Kashmir has turned into a graveyard.

 Survivors throughout the Himalayan region are living in fear of aftershocks and Khans aides persuaded him to abandon the residence in case it collapses around him.

 Burying the dead and relocating the homeless are top priorities for Khan, although his own administration has been rendered totally helpless by the destruction of infrastructure, communications and transport links.

 Like others, he expects the death toll to go well beyond 20,000 in Kashmir alone, without counting the dead from the neighbouring North West Frontier Province.

 Ahead lies the risk of more deaths from disease and exposure for the nearly 1.5 million Kashmiris affected by the quake on Pakistans side.

 Khan welcomed Indias offer of help as a positive sign for the peace process with Pakistan. However, despair over the tragedy his people faced could not erase ingrained distrust of Indias motives.

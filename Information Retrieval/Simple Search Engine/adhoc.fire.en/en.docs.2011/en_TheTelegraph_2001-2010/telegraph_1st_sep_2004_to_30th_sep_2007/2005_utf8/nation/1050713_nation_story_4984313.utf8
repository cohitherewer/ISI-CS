 15 more minutes for CBSE examinees

 New Delhi, July 12 (PTI): 

 Students appearing for board examinations next year will 

 have 15 minutes extra to read the question paper before 

 getting down to write answers as this time will not be deducted 

 from the total duration of the exam. 

 Moreover, question papers would be set in such a way that they can be answered in two-and-a-half hours, though students would have three hours to answer them. 

 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) also plans to introduce the system of internal assessment in mathematics, sciences and social sciences from next year. 

 These measures, aimed at making exams stress-free, were contained in a presentation made by CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly at a meeting of the parliamentary consultative committee attached to the human resource development ministry today. 

 Ganguly said initiatives would be taken to introduce internal assessment in mathematics, sciences and social sciences based on project work and assignment.

 This, Ganguly said, would give adequate thrust to continuous learning in classrooms and assessment of students performance on a holistic base covering a wide range of learning skills rather than one examination at the secondary level.

 Chairing the meeting, HRD minister Arjun Singh said the CBSE will take measures from the next board examinations to make them stress-free, adding that the issue should not be limited to a one-off debate but should be an ongoing discussion.

 He said there was a need to evolve a collective common sense while dealing with a sensitive subject like education, which concerns not just students but the entire nation.

 New Delhi, July 5: Strongly condemning the militant attack at Ayodhya, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tonight said the bid was aimed at destabilising the countrys society and polity.

 The government was determined to deal firmly with all such acts of terrorism and there will be no compromise on this count, he said. 

 In a statement tonight after chairing a meeting of the cabinet committee on political affairs, the Prime Minister said: The government views the incident as a serious one and all states have been alerted to take adequate precaution for protecting monuments, security installations and religious places.

 Singh, who cancelled his scheduled tour of Gujarat this afternoon where he was to survey flood-hit areas, appealed to all citizens to be calm and requested political leaders to help in maintaining peace and communal harmony. 

 Maintaining that the entire country was shocked by the dastardly attack, Singh said: We will never compromise with terrorism. There should be no doubt in anybodys mind.

 The government was determined to deal firmly with all such acts of terrorism that were a threat to security and the polity, he said.

 Singh complimented the security forces for foiling the militants design. It is fortunate the attack was foiled and the assailants killed in the shootout, he said. It is also fortunate that no damage occurred to the physical structures at the site of the incident, the Prime Minister added.

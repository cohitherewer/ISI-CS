 Shops destroyed in blaze

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: A fire, which broke out last night, destroyed a part of the Unit-1 market, the popular vegetable market in the Orissa capital. 

 There were no casualties reported. A short-circuit is believed to have caused the fire. Twenty-seven shops were totally gutted while three others were partially burnt. The loss of property is estimated at over Rs 1 crore. Several small shopkeepers lost everything they had.

 Bhubaneswar superintendent of police Amitabh Thakur said the fire destroyed a number of shops. Around 11.45 pm, long after the market had closed and the shopkeepers left for their homes, local residents spotted flames leaping out of the shop of one Narayan Nayak, located near the cycle-stand close to the main entrance. 

 The fire then spread rapidly to other shops. The city fire station was informed immediately and five fire-tenders and more than 50 fire-fighters rushed to the spot. Hundreds of people wandered in shock in the smoke-filled air among scorched papayas and burnt currency notes. The fire-tenders doused the flames this morning.

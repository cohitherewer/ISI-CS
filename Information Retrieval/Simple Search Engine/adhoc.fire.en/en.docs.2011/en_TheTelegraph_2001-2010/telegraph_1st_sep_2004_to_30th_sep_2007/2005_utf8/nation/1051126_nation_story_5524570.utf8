 66 drown in TN bus mishaps 

 Chennai: At least 66 people died in two bus mishaps in the swirling flood waters of south Tamil Nadu on Friday, reports our special correspondent.

 A state government bus from Tiruchirappalli to the pilgrim centre of Rameswaram skidded off a bridge near Janaveli, 40 km from Ramanathapuram, around 1.30 pm. 

 Pushed by the gushing waters, police sources said, the brakes failed and the bus turned turtle, killing 26 passengers. It was carrying nearly 70 people. Fifteen passengers have been admitted to Ramanathapuram district hospital.

 The police saved 25 people by using local boats. 

 In Thanjavur district, an overcrowded private bus from Pattukottai to Aranthangi overturned while crossing a flooded culvert at Maharajahasamudram. Police sources said 40 bodies have been recovered till 9 pm. 

 With the entire district flooded, the state government has withdrawn most of its transport service, which was one of the reasons for overcrowding in private buses.

 Black Cats leave Bihar

 New Delhi: Face smeared with egg, the 

 Centre has decided to recall the elite Black Cat commandos 

 from Bihar, soon after sending them to battle Naxalites.

 The Union home ministry had despatched two National Security Guard squadrons (280 commandos) to track down the Maoists who had stormed the Jehanabad jail. But the state polices failure to provide local intelligence turned the plan into a dud, sources said.

 One of the NSG squadrons came back on Friday and the other will return on Saturday.

 The Centre has now sent a strong advisory to Bihar chief secretary G.S. Kang, asking him to revamp the police and bring in fresh blood. New chief minister Nitish Kumar, too, has told the police to pull up their socks.

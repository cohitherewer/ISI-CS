 Tibet makes the most of limited freedom

 Lhasa, June 12: At 76, Luosang has seen it all ? Tibet old and new. In fact, he hasnt just seen it; he has played his part in the dramatic makeover of the mystical land of the romantic imagination.

 He sits in a first-floor room of his traditional Tibetan-style house in Lhasa, his back to the wall adorning several images of the Buddha and Buddhist paintings.

 In the street below there are endless streams of pilgrims making the rounds of the Jokhang, the holiest of the Buddhist shrines in all of Tibet, whose origin dates back to the seventh century. Only a small distance away looms the massive structure of the Potala Palace rising to the top of a hill.

 Luosangs story, like modern Tibets, begins in 1959, when the 14th Dalai Lama left the Potala on his great escape to India, making Tibet an international cause.

 Luosang began working for the Lhasa residents committee in 1959 as a volunteer. It was a hard life maintaining a family of four children. 

 He is retired now and lives with the family of his youngest son, a carpenter by trade. His other son and two daughters live elsewhere. The eldest daughter has also retired from her government job, while the two other children ? a son and a daughter ? also have regular jobs.

 Luosang is happy with the freedoms that Tibetans now enjoy ? freedoms to choose their professions and live their own lives. It was hard to imagine such freedoms in the old days when most Tibetans lived as serfs and life was what the serf-owners, who were also the monastic leaders, made of it for the people.

 But what about religious and political freedoms? He does not talk of the post-1951 communist takeover of Tibet or the Cultural Revolution clampdown on religion. The governments policy gives the people the freedom to either believe or disbelieve in religion. 

 A government official sitting next to Luosang adds: The scene at the Jokhang says it all. Religious freedom is there for all to see.

 Luosang would like the Dalai Lama to come back ? but only as a religious leader. The government and the people will welcome him only if he gives up his separatist campaign.

 As for political reform, its reflected in the peoples freedom to elect ? or be elected as ? members of the Peoples Congress (the state- and national-level parliaments). 

 Partyspeak, official propaganda or a reality check on todays Tibet? The answer depends on what picture of Tibet one carries in ones mind. There is little doubt that Luosang has been a communist party cadre. Obviously, he has had little sympathy for the Tibet campaigners who see the old world as a Shangri-La that the Reds rose from hell to destroy. 

 No doubt Luosangs story skips some crucial facts, particularly the present-day restrictions. It says nothing of the communist partys ? and the governments ? control of religion through the so-called democratic management committees of the monasteries, the governments religious affairs bureau, the political education campaigns of the monks and sundry other ways.

 But then such restrictions are not unique to Tibet. The official policy that acts tough on anti-national and separatist activity is as valid elsewhere in China. 

 What is undeniable, though, is the march of the development engine. It has now gained momentum since the government initiated the western development programme in 2003 to accelerate the economic growth of backward areas like Tibet. 

 Even if one goes only by an overview of Lhasas leap into modernity ? with its wide roads, high-rise official and residential blocks and other facilities ? there is no denying that the common Tibetan now lives a better economic life. 

 To say that the development projects benefit only the Chinese settlers in Tibet seems simply untrue. To say also that the development is confined only to big towns of Tibet would also be untrue. The evidence lies in big highways and roads that cross high mountains and broad rivers that had remained un-crossed for centuries.

 And, the development drive is all set to get a new impetus this September when Lhasa celebrates the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

 Hyderabad, Aug. 21: Manmohan Singh harped on the same theme today as he did on his first visit to Andhra Pradesh as Prime Minister in the wake of mass suicides by farmers.

 Singhs agenda for his July 2004 visit was water, housing and education. Today, the Prime Minister stressed the need to end mass poverty and bring in social justice.

 He also launched the second phase of the Andhra governments ambitious land distribution programme in Medak and announced a financial package to help boost agricultural production.

 The Prime Minister hailed Marxism as an effective tool to end poverty and boost social justice, in an apparent attempt to appease the Left, which is on a warpath with the United Progressive Alliance government in Delhi.

 Insights of Marxism for rapid capitalisation and equitable distribution of benefits to all should guide any development policy or design, Singh told a seminar here on press and nation this morning, organised by the Telugu Marxist newspaper Praja Shakti.

 Marxism focused on sustained and rapid accumulation of capital essential for ending mass poverty. It also addressed the issue of social justice to ensure that fruits of growth are shared equitably, he said.

 Although I do not regard myself as a liberal in terms of social philosophy, I do recognise that Marxism attaches great importance to tackling problems of mass poverty and commitment to social justice.

 Singh pointed out how caste and sub-caste considerations had come to dominate the countrys political discourse. It is the Left parties that taught us to rise above these considerations and strengthen the foundations of democracy.

 India cannot remain a cohesive nation if it departs from secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution.

 The Prime Minister said the government will soon introduce courts at the lowest level to ensure speedier dispensation of justice to the poor. These courts will be close to the cause of action, cost effective and their procedures will be simple.

 The government is firm on bringing down the pendency of cases in courts and reducing the time taken to decide cases, he said.

 Singh also lauded the role of the media. It is a good time to be in your profession at the historical juncture of creating a modern, progressive, inclusive and dynamic society, he said.

 Singh said Delhi is committed to reforms in the government, police and judiciary. Our government is committed to such reforms. Our police and security forces are doing a valiant job in preserving law and order, he said.

 Visa fire on US quartet 

 Mumbai, June 13 (PTI): Four US nationals, who were assaulted on Saturday night on the suspicion that they were Christian missionaries involved in conversion, will be deported for violating visa rules, police said today.

 Their visit to Malad (a western suburb) to address a congregation did not appear to be as simple as meets the eye, a police official said.

 Philip Allan, Clover Edward, Richard Jenal and an unidentified person were questioned by special branch sleuths today before the police decided to deport them by the next available flight.

 The move came after Malad police submitted a report to the special branch.

 A special branch official said Allan has a multiple-entry visa and is a frequent visitor to India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. He is not a business traveller and therefore his frequent visits to India and adjoining countries raise suspicion in the backdrop of the Malad incident, the official added.

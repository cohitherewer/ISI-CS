The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Court nod to BCCI bids

 New Delhi, Oct. 4 (PTI): Delhi High Court today allowed the Indian cricket board to open technical bids for grant of telecast and broadcast rights in the country for the next four years after Zee Telefilms said it had no objections.

 The court, however, asked the board not to disclose the outcome till October 19, when the matter will come up for further hearing.

 Senior counsel Soli J. Sorabjee and A.M. Singhvi requested the bench on behalf of the BCCI to allow opening of the technical bids as the India-Sri Lanka series was scheduled to begin on October 25 and there was not much time left.

 Rajiv Nayar, who appeared for Zee, agreed to the suggestion but said the outcome should not be made public. Instead, the court should be informed, Nayar said.

 Zee had sought quashing of the boards invitation to tenders alleging that the eligibility conditions were framed to oust Indian bidders. 

 The BCCI framed the criteria for bidding in such a manner that would exclude the petitioner and/or other Indian television channels and favour ESPN STAR Sports, Zee said.

 Kerala call to fasten student chastity belt 

 JOHN MARY

 When in Kerala, better watch out

 Thiruvananthapuram, March 13: The moral police are out to teach decency to Kerala?s students.

 Educational institutions will, from the next academic year, be under the strict vigil of ethics committees, tasked to prevent the misuse of cellphones by school and college students and obscene shows in campus functions.

 The scare set off by a Delhi schoolboy?s camera-phone misadventure and similar incidents in Kerala where students have tried to invade the privacy of classmates have led to the formation of the three-tier committees. Several states had banned cellphone use in schools after the Delhi incident.

 Cellphone-wielding students in Kerala may have reservations about the ethics committees but no one has spoken out yet. Students? union representatives ? campuses in Kerala are highly politicised ? were unanimous on the restrictions on students.

 Earlier this week, education minister E.T. Mohammed Basheer told the Assembly that all students? unions had favoured restrictions on the use of mobile phones on campus.

 Basheer heads the state-level monitoring committee, which was constituted on March 1.

 The district collector will head the district-level committee while the principals or headmasters will monitor at the college or school level. The committees would implement guidelines on the dos and don?ts to be laid down by the education department.

 Various offences by and against students recently have prompted the government to enforce the guidelines.

 A few months ago, police arrested an engineering college student from the central district of Thrissur who tried to blackmail girls using fabricated nude pictures. They picked up the 19-year-old from a telephone booth in Kochi and seized a disk containing the morphed pictures. The youth had rung up the girls? parents and threatened to post the pictures on the Internet if they refused to pay up.

 In Pathanamthitta district, the police have arrested a 45-year-old former pastor and his son for allegedly blackmailing the chief of the Indian Pentecostal Church with nude pictures of his daughter and other family members.

 A popular TV show last week shocked viewers when a man, whose face was masked, disclosed his contract with a sex racketeer to take pictures of college girls using a camera phone. The man said he hung around colleges to click the pictures.

 Education secretary Sajan Peter said the government has already amended the Schools? Youth Festival manual by removing the option for film dances, often imitations of spicy movie numbers, some of which may be unsuitable for campus performances.

 The responsibility for ensuring ethical standards would also fall on parents and teachers, who would be required to keep close tabs on events organised at college festivals and youth meets.

 The parents and teachers would be involved in the selection of the events to ensure that there is no scope of breaching decency limits in school and college functions.

 Parents are expected to play a crucial role in ensuring that their wards comply with the guidelines.

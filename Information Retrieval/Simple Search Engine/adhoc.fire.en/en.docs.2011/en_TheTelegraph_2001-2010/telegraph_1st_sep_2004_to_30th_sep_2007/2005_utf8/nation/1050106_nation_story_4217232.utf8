 Arjun rules for foreign schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The human resource development ministry has outlined a series of guidelines for foreign educational institutions that want to set up branches in India.

 The proposals will be discussed at the education ministers? conference in Bangalore next week.

 ?The guidelines should be such that they attract and not inhibit foreign direct investment in higher education,? says the ministry. ?At the same time, they should not put to risk either the interest of the student community or the country in general.?

 HRD minister Arjun Singh is rooting for FDI in higher education even though the Left has rejected it.

 Singh believes a proper system of checks and balances will take care of the Left?s apprehensions about foreign education providers (FEPs) making an official entry into India. Some of them are already operating in the country unofficially.

 ?The Government of India will reserve the right to close down any educational institution if it is found violating the guidelines or is guilty of working against the national interest,? says the ministry.

 The guidelines cover several issues ranging from the credibility of the FEPs to the quality of their programmes.

 The ministry insists that ?at least 80 per cent of the surplus generated by the institution shall be invested back for the development of the educational institution? while not more than 20 per cent of the surplus will be allowed to go out of the country.

 One of the most common objections raised by the Left is that foreign education providers siphon off profits from India and give nothing back to the country.

 The FEPs will have to ensure that ?at least 51 per cent of management and faculty members are qualified Indians in the field of education residing in India?.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has held out the same kind of assurances to the Left to convince them about the need to increase FDI in telecom and insurance sectors. But the Left has not relented.

 The HRD minister is also trying to convince the Left that FEPs are not going to be allowed to dilute the ?national? character of education.

 ?The government should try and provide a level playing field for both domestic and foreign education providers with regard to fee structure,? says the ministry.

 Singh says the education sector in India will face new challenges once the new regime governed by the General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) comes into place.

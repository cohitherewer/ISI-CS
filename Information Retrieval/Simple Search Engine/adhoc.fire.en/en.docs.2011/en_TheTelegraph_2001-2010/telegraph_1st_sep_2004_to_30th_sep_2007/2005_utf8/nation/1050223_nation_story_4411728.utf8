 Women?s bill hits new wall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The UPA government?s attempt to revive the women?s reservation bill in the budget session has suffered yet another setback with the BJP and the Left parties expressing reservations over a formula tabled by Shivraj Patil.

 The home minister had proposed an increase in the number of Lok Sabha seats from the present 544 to provide reservation to women in the House. 

 According to this plan, the number of lower House members could be raised to 725. The Lok Sabha, which cannot accommodate more than 544, would then have to be shifted to the Central Hall and the Rajya Sabha to the Lok Sabha. The Central Hall could function from the library hall. 

 The Left parties believe that the move would bring the overall reservation to lower than 33 per cent, which the original bill stipulates. But CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said: ?We are not taking any position.? 

 However, Brinda Karat of the All India Democratic Women?s Association stuck to the original demand. ?The commitment in the common minimum programme is for reservation of one-third seats for women. This should be tested on the floor of the House,? Karat said.

 The BJP, on the other hand, feels Patil?s proposal would involve a ?tedious and prolonged? process of delimitation and would ?unduly? delay the bill, already pending for several years now.

 After a high-level meeting attended by BJP president L.K. Advani and senior leaders, including Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan and Sushma Swaraj, the party rejected the proposal as ?impractical?.

 The BJP wants the original bill to be passed in Parliament, party spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said, but added that if there is consensus on any formula, the BJP would accept it.

 Swaraj said the BJP would write to the Prime Minister requesting him to convene an all-party meeting to evolve a consensus.

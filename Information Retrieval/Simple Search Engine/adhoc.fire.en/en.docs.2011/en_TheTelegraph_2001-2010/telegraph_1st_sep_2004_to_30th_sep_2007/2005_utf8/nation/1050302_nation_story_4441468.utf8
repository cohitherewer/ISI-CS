 Valley link 

 Srinagar, March 1: Kashmir?s only surface link to the rest of the country was partially reopened to traffic today after snowstorms and avalanches blocked it for nearly a month, reports our special correspondent.

 About 200 stranded vehicles found passage to the Valley as one-way traffic was restored on the over 300-km Jammu-Srinagar National Highway. They were carrying essential supplies such as vegetables, mutton, poultry, petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene.

 ?The highway was reopened by the Border Roads Organisation, and 200 trucks carrying essential supplies entered the Valley late this afternoon,? Taj Mohi-ud-Din, the Jammu and Kashmir food and civil supplies minister, told a news conference here. ?Three hundred trucks carrying more supplies will reach Srinagar by tomorrow.?

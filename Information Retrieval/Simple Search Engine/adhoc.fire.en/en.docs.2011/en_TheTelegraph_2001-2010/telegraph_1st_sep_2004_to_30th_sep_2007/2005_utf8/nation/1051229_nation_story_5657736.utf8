 Local boy runs past Salman in RS race

 Khursheed: Pipped to post

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Congress has picked local boy Jai Prakash Aggarwal over running favourite Salman Khursheed as its nominee to the Rajya Sabha seat vacated by the death of P.M. Sayeed.

 Till last week, Khursheeds nomination had seemed almost certain. Sources had said his nomination would be a prelude to his induction into the Union cabinet and that he would quit as Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president.

 But powerful sections in the Congress pushed for Aggarwal, saying his nomination would blunt the discontent against Sheila Dikshits regime in Delhi on a host of civic issues, the most recent being the demolition of illegal constructions.

 The demolition drive, carried out by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on court orders, has enraged traders. They have been questioning why the illegal constructions were not stalled in the first place and alleging that traders who refused to bribe MCD officials were targeted.

 Sections in the Congress said the nomination of Aggarwal, who belongs to the Vaish (traders) community, could help check allegations that the party was anti-trader.

 Another point in Aggarwals favour was that he was of vintage Congress stock (his father was a worker). Although he lost the parliamentary elections from Chandni Chowk in 1999 by 1,700 votes, he had given up the seat in 2004 for Kapil Sibal. Sources said he had then been promised a Rajya Sabha berth.

 Some Muslims in the Congress were, however, upset that not a single minority candidate was nominated to the three seats that had fallen vacant. Karan Singh and Janardhan Dwivedi, an AICC general secretary, were re-nominated.

 The argument that Khursheed was not from Delhi did not cut much ice as neither Singh nor Dwivedi are from the capital.

 At the end of the day, all three have spent the better part of their political lives in the capital, though Singh hails from Jammu and Kashmir and Dwivedi from Uttar Pradesh, the sources said.

 Muslim organisations, notably the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamiat-e-Islamia, and sections of the Urdu press reportedly took adverse note of the nominations.

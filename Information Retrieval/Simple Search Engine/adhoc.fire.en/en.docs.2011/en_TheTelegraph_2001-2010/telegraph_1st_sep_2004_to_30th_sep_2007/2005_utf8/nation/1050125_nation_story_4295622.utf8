The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Big Two in TV face-off

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Jan. 24: The late winter chill had turned the imposing fa?ade of the Bihar Assembly into a haze last night and the heavy woolens were proving equally inadequate for the rulers and the ruled, being referred to as ?janta? by the compere.

 The cameras rolled twice before the show actually began, with Laloo Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar pitted against each other, after a long time, on Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri, a live show on STAR News.

 An organiser conceded it was tough to get the ?janta?, mainly due to the bad weather and the ?unearthly hour?. ?We tried getting people through random phone calls but were not sure of the response. The attendance is lower than our expectations and the majority here will back the RJD,? he said.

 A man in the audience said he had received a phone call to attend the show. ?I am here with questions because Laloo Prasad and Nitish rarely face each other. But I am not sure if they will let me ask the questions,? he said.

 The man?s fears came true as just one person from the audience was allowed to make a query. ?Why do you give tickets to criminals at all?? he asked. This led to a blame game in which Laloo Prasad blamed Nitish for supporting the likes of Suraj Bhan and Anant Singh before he shifted his attack to Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan.

 ?But what about Pappu Yadav? He is after all in the RJD now,? whispered a young man in the audience. ?I am too scared to raise a direct question. You never know what will happen to you. It is sad that Laloo Prasad is talking about democracy which is missing at least from this place,? he told this reporter.

 The lusty cheers for Laloo Prasad?s smart rustic talk could be heard mainly from the front two rows. RJD minister and the party?s state president, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, was sitting there with a large number of supporters.

 There was a problem in the right corner of the audience ?gallery?. Nitish supporter and Janata Dal (United) functionary Anil Pathak entered into an argument with those who were backing Laloo Prasad. ?They were passing unwanted comments which came from the first two rows. I reacted on time and then they were silent because Laloo Prasad was trying to defend the indefensible,? Pathak said.

 But a young man who came from Patliputra Colony after he saw the live telecast said, ?If more people support Laloo Prasad, obviously the audience will reflect that. For me, he is the ultimate provider of social justice in Bihar. The elite may not like him but no one can ignore him.?

 ?We have come to listen to both of them after we saw a newspaper advertisement. But the show has been hijacked by RJD supporters, who are trying to show their faces to Laloo Prasad. This is not fair because the viewers want to make a choice. I think Nitish Kumar is talking on a more concrete basis while the RJD chief is beating around the bush,? said an audience member.

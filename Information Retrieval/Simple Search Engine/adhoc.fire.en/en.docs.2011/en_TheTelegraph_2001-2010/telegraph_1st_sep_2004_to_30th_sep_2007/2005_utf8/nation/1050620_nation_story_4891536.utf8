 Pensive Pataudi eats papaya 

 GAJINDER SINGH

Chandigarh, June 19: Daal, roti and 

papaya for dinner; tea, bread, soup and some more daal for breakfast. People 

for Animals would approve.

 A pensive Nawab of Pataudi, in police custody on the charge of killing a black buck, has been eating only vegetarian food in the lock-up. Whatever he wanted was provided to him, an officer said. He would not eat anything non-vegetarian. He just said mujhe pasand nahin (I am not fond of it).

 The former Indian cricket captain today began his second innings in the makeshift lock-up at Jhajjar police station after a magistrates court, which had given him 24 hours remand yesterday, extended it by another day. The hearing on his regular bail plea comes up tomorrow.

 The prisoner would be served the same menu tonight and tomorrow morning, the officer said.

 Did the nawab sleep well behind barred doors in the unfamiliar, uncomfortable surroundings?

 Kaptan Singh, the investigating officer, was dismissive. Jaise raat katthi hai sab ki thane mein, Pataudi saab ki raat vaise hi kati (Pataudi spent the night in the same way as anyone else who finds himself in a police lock-up would), he said. But he quickly added: Shaant swabhav ke hain, shaant hi the (He is a quiet person and remained quiet).

 Pataudi, too, did not say anything to the chief judicial magistrate about being mistreated by the police.

 But another officer said the 65-year-old aristocrat spent the night mostly pacing up and down the room. He was in a pensive mood, perspiring at times, often smiling. He took some medicines and even joked with the guards. He slept little, but he slept soundly.

 The prisoner had asked for and got a few magazines. No calls, however, were received at the police station from family or friends.

 Police were trying to get a new set of clothes for Pataudi, who continued to wear the green kurta and white pyjamas in which he had surrendered yesterday.

 Pataudi has been maintaining a stoic silence, reveal inquiries by The Telegraph. 

 Till late this evening, he had held firm in the face of intensive grilling, insisting that he had not fired a single shot at the black buck.

 One of the accused, Madan Singh, has apparently told the police that Pataudi shot the buck. He said after the black buck and hares were killed, halal was done.

 The prosecution said today that the registration certificate of the Gypsy in which the carcasses were found is yet to be recovered.

 Sources said Pataudi could be taken to his Delhi residence any time to get the certificate.

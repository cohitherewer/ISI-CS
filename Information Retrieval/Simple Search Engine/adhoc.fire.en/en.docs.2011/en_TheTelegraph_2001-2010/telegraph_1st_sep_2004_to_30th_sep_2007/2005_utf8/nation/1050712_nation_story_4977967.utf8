 Sena in slanging match

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 11: The stage was set for a showdown on the streets. Instead, it was a contest of lungpower in the House.

 The result was the monsoon sessions first day ended without any business being transacted.

 Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Balasaheb Kupekar wrapped up proceedings after supporters of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and expelled leader Narayan Rane tried to outscream each other and members of the ruling Congress-NCP joined in the chaos.

 The days drama began with Rane filing the promised petition with the Speaker seeking disqualification of 23 Sena MLAs who did not attend the meeting of legislators he had called on July 8.

 Ten of the Senas 63 legislators attended the meeting, while two others had faxed their support.

 Yesterday, Rane had said he would demand the disqualification of 25 MLAs but later excluded two from the list of Uddhav supporters. Two MLAs telephoned me this morning and gave me valid reasons for their absence and, therefore, I excluded their names from the list, Rane said.

 When the House convened, Rane demanded that the Speaker give his ruling on his petition. Sena MLA Subhash Desai, who represents the Uddhav camp, also urged the Speaker to give his verdict legitimising the group of 51 MLAs paraded before Kupekar on July 7.

 Pandemonium broke out after Kupekar said he would give his ruling after studying the legal aspects of the petition. The Congress-NCP members cheered Rane and shouted slogans to obstruct Desai when he spoke. The din forced the Speaker to adjourn the House for 15 minutes initially and later for 30 minutes.

 When the noisy scenes continued, BJP leader Gopinath Munde suggested that Kupekar adjourn the House. Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil of the NCP backed the suggestion saying it was too noisy to conduct proceedings. Taken aback by the rare unanimity between the Opposition and the ruling benches, Kupekar wrapped up proceedings.

 Speaking to reporters later, leader of the Sena legislature party Ramdas Kadam said: This has never happened in legislative history that the ruling parties have disrupted the proceedings. When the Speaker was about to speak after repeated requests by us to give his ruling, the Congress-NCP members created noisy scenes to stop him from speaking.

 Kadam said all Opposition MLAs, including those from the Sena and the BJP, will meet the Speaker tomorrow and submit a petition demanding that Rane be removed as leader of the Opposition.

 All Opposition MLAs will tell the Speaker that Rane is alone and he has no support. So he should be removed, Kadam said.

 Earlier, the Sena leadership directed all 210 branches in Mumbai to send party workers to the Vidhan Bhavan in case of a showdown. Busloads of Rane supporters had also trooped into the city since last night.

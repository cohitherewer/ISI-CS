 Dress diktat

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 16: Whimpers of protest notwithstanding, students in most of the 23 autonomous colleges in Orissa today turned up in uniforms, reports our correspondent. 

 The state higher education department had issued a diktat asking students in these colleges to wear uniforms after August 15. Higher education minister Samir Dey had said a dress code would bring a sense of discipline in them. 

 In the state capitals Ramadevi Womens College, almost all plus-two students turned up in white and blue kameez and white salwar while the degree students wore white-green kameez and green salwar. 

 But BJB College extended the deadline to August 31 as the colours prescribed for its uniform were not available.

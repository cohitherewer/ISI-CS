 Srinagar, April 18: The guns of the militants that baptised the Pakistan peace bus by fire today blazed at General Pervez Musharraf for ?kneeling before India? and ?selling Kashmir in exchange of trade and tourism?.

 ?The person who is referred to as the hero of the Kargil war has kneeled before India. There is no precedent to such a meek surrender in the history of Pakistan,? a statement faxed to the local media by the four militant outfits said.

 The group ? the Save Kashmir Movement, Al-Nasreen, Al-Arifeen and Farzandan-e-Milat ? had targeted the Tourist Reception Centre the day before the April 7 launch of the historic Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus.

 Lashing out at the Pakistan President for allegedly trading Kashmir for monetary gain, it vowed to carry on with its ?jihad? even in the face of his hands-down surrender.

 ?We will continue our jihad and will never deviate from it. We will take the ongoing struggle to its logical conclusion,? the group said, also targeting Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin for backing the bus.

 Another outfit, Jamiat-ul Mujahideen, gunned for the general in a separate statement. ?Musharraf did not display the straightforwardness that was evident during the Agra summit.

 ?As President of Pakistan, he should have worked towards granting the right of self-determination to the people of Kashmir, but he has failed to live up to expectations.?

 But the people of Kashmir were all praises for the general who not only completed his unfinished Ajmer agenda but also managed to bury the ghost of the failed 2001 Agra summit. ?Tomorrow belongs to us and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Musharraf have the historic responsibility to deliver it to us,? said Syed Zubair, a 21-year-old student.

 Fifty-one-year-old Abdul Majeed, whose uncle migrated to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 1947, said he was thankful there was finally some good news. ?After waiting for many long years, there is some good news for us. India and Pakistan have decided to find peace through Kashmir.?

 Mohammad Hanief, a college teacher, added: ?It is wonderful that the two countries haven?t decided to keep Kashmir under the carpet. India has taken a bold step by accepting that there is a dispute and Pakistan has agreed that solutions would emanate from sustained and structured discussions.

 ?We hope the same spirit prevails to resolve Kashmir to the satisfaction of the Kashmiri people whose destiny is sealed in the conflict.?

 The feel-good spirit trickled down to the fruit-growers also who were ecstatic that trucks would be allowed to ply down the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road.

 ?We welcome it. It will now be easy for us to transport fruit to central Asia, west Asia and even Europe through this all-weather road. It would be just a day?s journey to the nearest sea port of Karachi,? said Gulam Rasool Bhat, the president of fruit growers? association.

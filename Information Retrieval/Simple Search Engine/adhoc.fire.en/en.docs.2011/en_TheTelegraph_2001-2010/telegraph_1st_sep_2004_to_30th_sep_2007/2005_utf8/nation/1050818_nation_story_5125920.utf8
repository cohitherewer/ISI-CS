 SC rejects Zahira plea

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of Zahira Sheikh, the prime witness in the Best Bakery case who turned hostile, for another week to file her reply and said the court committee would submit its report on August 24, reports our legal correspondent. 

 The committee, headed by registrar-general B.M. Gupta, is probing the allegations and counter-allegations of Zahira and social activist Teesta Seetalvad. Zahira had accused Teesta of making money using the Gujarat riots, and the bakery case in particular. In response, Teesta alleged that Zahira has been bought over.

 The court fixed August 29 for arguments on the report.

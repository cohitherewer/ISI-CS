 Monica or Sana or Fauzia or... 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA IN HYDERABAD AND RASHEED KIDWAI IN BHOPAL

 Nov. 11: Monica Bedi returned this evening to Hyderabad, the city where she got a new identity ? Sana Malik Kamal ? in August 2001.

 The same year, she had obtained another passport under the name Fauzia Usman from Bhopal, where she will be taken next by Mumbai police who have secured a two-day transit remand. But it was the Hyderabad passport that gangster Abu Salems companion ? it is not known if they are married ? was using when she was arrested in Portugal in 2002.

 Monica and Salem had each obtained a passport giving fake names and addresses in Kurnool town ? one of the three places in Andhra Pradesh, along with Hyderabad and Nizamabad, where the gangster had taken shelter after splitting with Dawood Ibrahim in 1998. Salem took the name Ramil Kamal Malik.

 This wasnt the first forged passport for Monica. She had acquired one only months earlier, in June 2001, from Bhopal where the police are waiting to get their hands on the gangster couple. 

 Bhopals DIG Anuradha Shankar said she will approach the CBI. Salem and Bedi have been named as accused in as many as four criminal cases in different police stations of Bhopal. We are requesting the CBI to hand them over to us so that they can be tried in Bhopal for the criminal cases lodged against them here, Shankar said.

 City superintendent of police Anant Kumar Singh added: We heard that Bedi is being taken from Mumbai to Hyderabad first, before being brought here.

 Monica is expected to be taken to Bhopal tomorrow, after she appears in a Hyderabad court. She has to be produced in a court there by November 14 in the passport forgery case.

 Bhopal police had named Salem and Monica accused in November 2001 at the citys Koh-e-fiza police station for acquiring a fake passport.

 Salem is also named conspirator in three shootouts in Bhopal in January, May and June 2002. Two were killed in the incidents.

 Police officials familiar with the case said they had reports that Salem shifted base to Portugal at the behest of Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). There, both he and Monica married Portuguese citizens to get residency permits. Large amounts of money were believed to have been paid for the sham marriages.

 The two were arrested in Portugal in 2002 on the charge of travelling on fake documents and have already faced trial in that country.

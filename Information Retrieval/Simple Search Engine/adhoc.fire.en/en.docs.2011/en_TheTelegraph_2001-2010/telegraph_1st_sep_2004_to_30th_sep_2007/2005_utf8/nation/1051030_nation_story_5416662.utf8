 BJP rebels spring apolitical Sangh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: Delhi BJP rebels Madan Lal Khurana and Kirti Azad today made their unhappiness with the central leaders apparent by floating an apolitical organisation.

 The Poorvanchal Kranti Sangh aims to bring migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar under one banner. While Khurana, a Punjabi, is identified with the BJPs vote base of the post-Partition settlers from Pakistan, Azad, the son of former Bihar chief minister Bhagwat Jha Azad, will be the Poorvanchali poster boy. 

 The organisation will seek to address the socio-economic and cultural problems of people hailing from the eastern parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, UP and West Bengal, Khurana, a former Delhi chief minister, told reporters this morning. 

 The news conference was held at the residence of Rajya Sabha MP Shatrughan Sinha, who is from Bihar, but the actor was missing ? Khurana said Sinha was out of the capital on an assignment. Another high-profile BJP dissident, Yashwant Sinha, did not show up either. 

 We are not against anyone forming a non-political organisation. Although they (Khurana and Azad) are talking about the Poorvanchalis, it will be better for them to join the battle in Bihar and dislodge Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said.

 BJP sources said the front was doomed to be a non-starter because Khuranas appeal was limited to Punjabis. 

 Khurana, who fell foul of BJP chief L.K. Advani when he demanded his resignation last month, avoided answering questions on the real intention of his organisation.

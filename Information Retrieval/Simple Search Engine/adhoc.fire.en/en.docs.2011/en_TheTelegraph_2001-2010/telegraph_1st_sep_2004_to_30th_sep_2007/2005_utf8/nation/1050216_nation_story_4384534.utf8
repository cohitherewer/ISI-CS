 Shanghai dream runs into slum wall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: Vilasrao Deshmukh is discovering that Mumbai cannot be transformed into Shanghai in one step.

 Even as more than four lakh Mumbaikars take to the roads, crowd into pavements or crawl back to their broken homes only to be evicted again after the demolition of 84,000 slum hutments over the past two months, the chief minister faces not only the anger of the evicted, grouping together across the city. 

 Deshmukh is also facing the music from his own party ? he has been summoned by Sonia Gandhi to explain the drive that has displaced more people in Mumbai than the tsunami did in the country. About 55 per cent of Mumbaikars live in slums. Deshmukh will meet the Congress president tomorrow.

 The chief minister, who began with no opposition from any party to the drive that is a step towards the government?s grand plan of turning Mumbai into Shanghai, drew sharp criticism from Sonia?s emissary in Mumbai Margaret Alva, in charge of party affairs in Maharashtra.

 Speaking at a function at the Indian Merchants? Chamber yesterday, Alva lashed out at the way people were being driven out of their homes.

 She said forced evictions will have to be stopped and the rich must also contribute to Mumbai?s development. She snubbed the Mumbai-to-Shanghai plan, saying that ?situations in India cannot be compared to those in China?.

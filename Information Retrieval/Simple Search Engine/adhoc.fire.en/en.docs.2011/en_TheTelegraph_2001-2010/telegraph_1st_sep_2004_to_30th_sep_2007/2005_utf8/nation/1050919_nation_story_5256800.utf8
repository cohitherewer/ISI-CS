 Modi turn not far off, chuckle rebels

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Modi: Days numbered?

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 18: The countdown to Narendra Modis ouster has begun in the Gujarat dissident camp with BJP chief L.K. Advani announcing that he will resign in December.

 The Gujarat chief minister has three months to put his house in order, which a Modi loyalist feels is a pretty long time in politics for mending fences with rivals and to make the situation favourable. If he does, he can survive, the leader said. But rebel leaders dismiss this optimism as wishful thinking. 

 One visibly upbeat Modi detractor said without Advani at the helm of affairs, the chief minister would not be able to save his chair even for a day. He would have to go as more leaders desert the Advani camp. 

 Dissidence has plagued the Gujarat BJP for some time with party leaders unhappy with Modis autocratic style of functioning and his failure to control the riots in Gujarat in 2002. With over 50 MLAs and around a dozen MPs, the rebel line-up includes former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, Suresh Mehta, former Union minister Kashiram Rana, Vallabh Kathiria and A.K. Patel. 

 Reacting to Advanis announcement, VHP general secretary and Modis bete noir Praveen Togadia said: I need not say anything now because Advani has cleared the air. There is no confusion anymore. Asked if Modi will be in trouble now, he said: Everybody can read between the lines. Everybody knows what will be the effect.

 Modi had stood solidly behind Advani when the RSS and VHP attacked the BJP chief for his controversial remarks on Mohammad Ali Jinnah. This earned Modi the displeasure of leaders like Togadia. 

 Under attack from rebels for some time, Modi, too, has had the support of Advani, who was actually returning a favour. 

 The BJP president refused to meet dissident leaders on a recent visit. This compounded Advanis problems as he then became the rebel leaders first target. 

 We have achieved our first objective, one dissident leader said today. Now, Modi is our second target?. Without Advanis support he is highly vulnerable and cannot behave the way he used to.

 He also said that Modi will not be able to get along with any other president, whoever replaces Advani, and especially if Murli Manohar Joshi succeeds him. Die-hard Modi loyalists also admit this. 

 Rebel MLA Ramilaben recently created a stir by writing to Advani, saying her life could be in danger. She expressed fear that she might be killed like Haren Pandya, who was also a Modi detractor. 

 BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas, however, believes that external pressure on Modi will cease with Advani leaving the chair as the VHP and RSS will not attack the chief minister any more. State VHP general secretary Dilip Trivedi concurred. Our main target was Advani who has not resigned yet, he said.

 The only hope for Modi, said one of his supporters, is that not many second-rung BJP leaders in Delhi want him there. It is in their interest that Modi should continue as Gujarat chief minister. Moreover, they would not like to disturb a state which is perceived to be well governed and doing well under Modis leadership, a fact rebel legislators deny.

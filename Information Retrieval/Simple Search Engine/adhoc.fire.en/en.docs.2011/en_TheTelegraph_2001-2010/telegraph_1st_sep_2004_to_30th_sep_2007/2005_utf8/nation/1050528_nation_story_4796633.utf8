 Tsunami lesson for Bill

Nagapattinam, May 27: As the 51-year-old fisherman finished narrating his tale before the overseas visitor, there was a sudden lull in the collectorate building.

 A tearful K. Parameshwaran had just described how he had lost his three children and seven relatives to the tsunami, which had struck on his birthday. 

 The American leaned forward and said in a voice thick with emotion: I can never forget your story in my life.

 With such words did Bill Clinton today strike a chord in Nagapattinam as he made a whistle-stop tour of the town, meeting tsunami victims at the collectorate as well as relief camps.

 He heard in rapt attention how Parameshwaran and his wife had turned their home into an orphanage, taking care of 60 children affected by last Decembers Black Sunday. To the ex-President, this meant the couple had found a way to honour their own (dead) children.

 Two child survivors also moved Clinton by their tales. M. Vadivel of Akkarapet, orphaned by the killer waves, has found shelter with a British woman. K. Nirmala of Nambiar Nagar, 15, has had the grit to sit for her Class X exams despite losing everything to the disaster and is waiting for the results. Clintons advice to them: Never give up on your education.

 I was impressed by the resilience of the people in difficult situations, the former President, in a red T-shirt and grey trousers, later told the media after a visit to the makeshift relief camp in the Industrial Training Institute. This whole thing has been very moving.

 Like when children at the balwadi (primary school) sang a couple of nursery rhymes for him, including one in English. After they finished chanting Johnny, Johnny, Yes Papa, Clinton told them, I want to come again. Will you sing for me (then)?

 But amid the emotion and the pep talk, what apparently struck Clinton, in his new role of UN special envoy, most was the idleness prevailing at the camps. At the biggest camp, of about 620 temporary shelters, the former President learnt most of the fishermen are yet to go back to sea because they cannot afford boats. 

 To Clinton, this deprivation of livelihood was the worst aspect of the tragedy and he promised to try and do something about it. I will see how I can help in increasing the economic benefits, he said.

 The key to boosting incomes and letting the victims take charge of their lives again, he felt, was to diversify the economy of Nagapattinam. 

 Clinton, who watched a display of various products made by tsunami-affected women, was particularly impressed by the candles, the terracotta and recycled paper products. He promised to find a wider market for these products in various parts of the world to push some sources of cash for the women.

 Time was running out and he left with a special word of thanks for the people in the camps who allowed me in and made me feel so welcome.

 Thank you for the good work you are doing, he told trainee counsellors at the psycho-social support and counselling centre being run jointly by the World Health Organisation, United Nations Development Programme and the state social welfare department.

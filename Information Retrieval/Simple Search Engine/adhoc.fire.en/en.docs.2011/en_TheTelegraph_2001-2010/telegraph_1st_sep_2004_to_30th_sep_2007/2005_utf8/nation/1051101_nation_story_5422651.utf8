 Left loads Iran vote gun

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: The Left parties today mounted pressure on the government, demanding that the Iran debate in Parliament should be put to vote.

 We are going to seek a meeting with the Prime Minister to tell him that the government must abstain from voting with the US at the next round of the IAEA meeting on November 24, CPI leader A.B. Bardhan said.

 We want to raise the Iran issue in Parliament. It cannot be left to the Prime Minister and home minister to decide, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has said.

 As the Left parties, the Samajwadi Party and the Janata Dal (Secular) together have more than 100 MPs, Left leaders feel the government might end up in a minority in case the Iran debate is put to vote. The BJP has already opposed the governments decision to vote with the US against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting in Vienna last month.

 We can ask for a discussion under any parliamentary form that entails voting, said a Left leader. If the Speaker allows a discussion under Section 184, it means the motion will have to be put to vote.

 The winter session of Parliament begins on November 21, three days before the second round of the IAEA meeting begins. The Left wants to make use of the three days to get Parliament to pass a resolution that would prevent the Centre from voting with the US.

 This was the tactic the Opposition had used when the NDA government was mulling sending Indian troops to Iraq. It had to abandon the move after Parliament passed a resolution against it.

 So far, Left parties have resisted any move that could lead to voting against the government. But they believe they will have to stretch their limits of opposition on Iran, although they will stop short of taking any decision that could jeopardise the governments survival.

 There is also an opinion within the Left parties that they could consider issue-based support to the government in case it refuses to take an independent stand at the next IAEA meeting.

 We can do what we did at the time of the Narasimha Rao government ? that is, extend issue-based support from outside. The Narasimha Rao government, too, was a minority government, said a Left leader.

 So far, the Left parties have organised public seminars and meetings on Iran but they realise the protests have not exerted much pressure on the government. They now want to press the issue in Parliament so that the government comes under the scanner on the floor.

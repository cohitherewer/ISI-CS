The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 June date for rural power

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 10: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik has directed the energy department to complete electrification of the targeted 4,646 villages by June this year.

 The instruction was given at a high-level meeting on the progress of rural electrification in the state.

 Of the targeted villages, 1,316 have already been electrified, energy minister Surya Narayan Patro told The Telegraph. Besides, electric poles have been installed in 1,104 villages, which would be completely electrified by March-end. Electrification work in the rest would be over by June, he added.

 Representatives of the distribution companies pointed out that they were not able to pay running bills to the sub-contractors engaged by them. 

 It was decided at the meeting that Rs 2 crore will be provided to Southco and Rs 1 crore each to Wesco, Nesco and Cesco for payment of running bills to the sub-contractors for rural electrification work under the minimum needs programme (MNP).

 As the Centre has discontinued the MNP, rural electrification work will now be taken up under the accelerated power development and reforms programme by taking a block as the unit. 

 The work will be undertaken by the National Hydel Power Corporation, Power Grid Corporation and National Thermal Power Corporation.

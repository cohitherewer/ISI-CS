 Godhra, now on CDs 

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Feb. 11: The flames of Godhra refuse to die down. 

 The Justice Banerjee Committee report, ?inflammatory? posters and now CDs on the Godhra episode have ensured a prolonged battle between ?communal? and ?secular? forces in Bihar.

 The context: growing fears in the Rashtriya Janata Dal that Muslim voters are beginning to look the other way.

 CDs and posters depicting the post-Godhra riots could be found at several places in rural north Bihar, where elections will be held on February 15. 

 Away from the capital, CDs of a film and posters, prepared by the RJD, have reportedly refreshed the memories of ?horrid? pictures in the Muslim-dominated areas of Purnea and Kishanganj. Posters had earlier surfaced in Bhagalpur.

 The film contains pictures of the riots and a commentary on them presenting several NDA leaders, including ?saffron socialist? George Fernandes, Sharad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan ? referred to as ?those sitting in the lap of the BJP to enjoy power and stab people who elected them on their backs? ? in a predictably negative light.

 What follows are, of course, praises for Laloo Prasad Yadav. 

 Reacting to the RJD propaganda, NDA leaders have planned to give Laloo Prasad a ?fitting reply?. ?It is a clear violation of the model code of conduct. We will ask the Election Commission to take action at once. It should probe into the misuse of the Godhra issue,? BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said. 

 He wanted the poll panel to ?punish? the district officials of those places where the CDs and posters have been circulated.

 Claiming that it will not affect the outcome of the elections, Modi said, ?Laloo Prasad has already won once by raising the issue. Muslims are not going to support him this time.?

 The entire Opposition, including Lok Janshakti Party chief Paswan, held that the RJD chief is ?desperate? as Muslims have started to ?discard? him. ?He has no other issue to talk about. He?s just trying to fool the people by ignoring the real issues,? state BJP spokesperson Kiran Ghai said. 

 Laloo Prasad, who did not find the CD objectionable, argued: ?I had informed the Election Commission about it. Who says it is a violation of the model code ??

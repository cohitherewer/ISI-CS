 Left, unions at odds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: Left parties and their trade unions are split on the pension bill the government wants to pass in the winter session of Parliament. 

 Citu has refused to budge from its opposition to the bill, prompting the Left parties to declare in public that a decision has been left to the unions.

 We stand by our stand and cannot accept the PFRDA bill, Citu president M.K. Pandhe said.

 If passed, the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority Bill will help the Centre and state governments, including the Left-ruled Bengal, to reduce their burden as employees will have to make a contribution under the new system. The bill also permits a part of the pension funds to be invested in the stock markets.

 Left to themselves, some Left leaders ? aware of the poor state of finances in many states ? are not averse to accepting the bill after some more modifications are made. The bill has already been amended after it was sent to a parliamentary committee.

 The new scheme has already been introduced through a government notification. It is functioning in several states, a senior Left leader pointed out. But the bill has to be passed to give the scheme legal sanctity.

 Left labour leaders say they cannot accept a bill which legitimises investing pension money in the stock market, allows private firms to handle the money and converts the scheme from welfare to the contributory mode. 

 The UPA government is going to exert pressure on the Left to pass the bill in the winter session. Left leaders are then expected to work on the trade unions to find a middle path that could lead to the passage of the bill as well as help the unions save face.

 The CPM is primarily guided by the Bengal governments concerns on the issue. The passage and implementation of the pension bill will benefit the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. 

 At the UPA-Left coordination committee meeting last month, finance minister P. Chidambaram told the Left leadership that the advocates of the pension bill include Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

 We understand why Bhattacharjee wants the bill passed. He has financial compulsions of governance to deal with, said a Left leader.

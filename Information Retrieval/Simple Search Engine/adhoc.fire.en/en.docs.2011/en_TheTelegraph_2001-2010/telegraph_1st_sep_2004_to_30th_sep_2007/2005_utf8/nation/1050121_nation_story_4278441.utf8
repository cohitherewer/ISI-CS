 Patna, Jan. 20: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav today said his party will develop Bihar if voted back to power.

 The RJD also promised a ?decisive battle? against corruption, a transparent government and improvement in the law and order situation.

 In office since 1990, the RJD ? in its election manifesto released today ? said the state could not develop because of the raw deal given to it by the NDA government, especially after the creation of Jharkhand in 2000.

 ?The presence of our own government in Delhi today has opened the doors for Bihar?s development. History has given us a big chance, a golden opportunity. The time to undo the injustices of the past has come,? the RJD president quoted from the manifesto.

 ?The dreams that we have shown to Dalits, backwards, minorities and the poor, the aspirations that we have aroused in them to have a share in power while living with dignity, the appropriate time to fulfil them has now come, when we have our government at the Centre and in the state,? he added. 

 The 24-page document is a populist bundle of promises aimed at luring voters, particularly Muslims, backward classes and women. Laloo Prasad announced a slew of sops for Muslims, which includes providing financial powers to the Urdu directorate, compulsory Urdu teaching in all middle schools, opening of Urdu high schools for girls, providing facilities on a par with the Scheduled Castes to backwards among the minorities, appointment of an Urdu-knowing official at every police station and upgrading facilities at Haj Bhavan in Patna.

 The RJD government will enlist 1 lakh young men and women to constitute a ?Vikas Sena?, which will ensure the participation of common people in development projects. Members of this Sena will be provided the necessary training and facilities.

 ?We will make a recommendation to the Union government for making Patna University a central university. Education till the postgraduation level will be made free for women. Writers, journalists and artistes will be felicitated and provided necessary compensation and pension. An authentic history of the JP movement will be chronicled,? the manifesto said.

 The party promised the constitution of an ?independent department of employment? whose main work will be to identify job vacancies from the block to the secretariat level, advertise them and recruit people. It will also provide employment loans.

 The manifesto vowed to provide seeds, fertilisers, diesel, pesticides, tube-wells, crop insurance and soft loans for buying tractors and farm accessories to farmers. It also promised to solve the problem of floods in north Bihar.

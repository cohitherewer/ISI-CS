 Sadhvi loses power steam

 Bhopal, Nov. 2: Uma Bhartis return to Bhopal on Diwali evening lacked the fireworks of her last visit, signalling that her bid for the reins of the state was fizzling out.

 Sources close to chief minister Babulal Gaur suggested the sadhvi was having second thoughts on staking claim to his chair. They offered two reasons: dwindling support for her among the MLAs and the central BJP leaderships reluctance to oblige her.

 They said Uma is now angling for the post of party national general secretary.

 Uma arrived here after taking a dip in the river Mandakini in Chitrakoot yesterday. Unlike a fortnight ago, there was no show of strength by party legislators at her Professors Colony residence.

 Uma avoided political statements and said she was leaving for Ayodhya to celebrate Bhai Dooj with Ram Lalla. During Bhai Dooj, which follows Diwali, sisters put an auspicious tilak or vermilion mark on their brothers forehead to protect them from evil forces.

 Uma, a former chief minister, will leave Bhopal at a time when Madhya Pradesh is gearing up to celebrate 50 years of its formation. Tomorrow, Gaur plans to felicitate all former chief ministers of the state and has invited all of them, including Congress leaders Arjun Singh, Shyama Charan Shukla, Motilal Vora and Digvijay Singh. Arjun is expected to attend but Digvijay has made it clear he would not.

 In Bhopal, Gaur made light of the demand for a change of guard, asserting there was no political instability in the state and that none should pay heed to rumours. He looked and sounded confident after his recent meeting with senior BJP leaders in New Delhi.

 Last month, the Uma camp had publicly demanded that a meeting of the state BJP legislature party be called to replace Gaur. The matter was put on the back burner with the national leadership asking the rebels to shelve the demand keeping in mind the Bihar polls.

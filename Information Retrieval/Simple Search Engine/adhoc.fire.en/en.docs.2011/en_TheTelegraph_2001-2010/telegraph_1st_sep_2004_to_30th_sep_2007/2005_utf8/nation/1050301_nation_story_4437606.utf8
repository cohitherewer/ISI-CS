 Mines thrust in Orissa growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 28: The Orissa government would soon formulate a dedicated policy for exploitation of its mineral resources.

 Inaugurating the budget session of the Assembly today, Governor Rameshwar Thakur said the government is committed to provide necessary support for the establishment of mineral-based industries. ?The government lays emphasis on the grant of mining leases to industries in order to generate employment and increase the rate of industrialisation in the state,? the governor said. 

 At present, the government grants a mining lease after 50 per cent of the proposed investment is made. In order to develop infrastructure in mining areas, it has come up with the Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio-economic Development Act to garner dedicated resources, he added.

 Reiterating the government?s desire to make Orissa a favoured industrial destination, Thakur said, ?Orissa is fast emerging as a steel hub with over 27 mega projects likely to come up with an approximate investment of more than Rs 50,000 crore. Work on most of these projects has started. In the next four years, Orissa?s steel production will grow to 30 million tonnes per annum, creating direct and indirect employment opportunities for 50,000 people.?

 The government has signed MoUs for two mega and 23 medium steel and other mineral-based projects with a total production capacity of 24.91 million tonnes and involving a total investment of Rs 44,067 crore. 

 Besides, it will also sign MoUs for 15 medium industrial projects with a total installed capacity of 12.95 million tonnes and costing Rs 25,413 crore.

 Lauding the government for its efforts to improve the fiscal health of the state?s economy, Thakur said the revenue deficit had decreased from Rs 2574.19 crore in 1999-2000 to Rs 1420.92 crore in 2003-2004.

 The governor further said the Centre needs to play a bigger role if the state is to restructure its debt stock. ?The debt burden is unsustainable and there is a need to bring it to a sustainable level by reducing the annual borrowing,? he added.

 State finance minister Prafulla Ghadei will present the budget on Friday.

 The Congress is planning to corner the government in the current session on the deteriorating law and order situation and its ?failure? to check Naxalite activities. 

 The party is also likely to raise the alleged violation of forest laws by the government and Vedanta Alumina Limited and irregularities in the implementation of the Indira Awaas Yojana in some super-cyclone-affected districts of the state.

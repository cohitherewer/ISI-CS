 Centre mulls IIT level for colleges 

 New Delhi (PTI): The Centre is considering 

 constitution of an expert group to assess the suitability 

 of upgrading seven institutions to the level of the IITs, 

 the Lok Sabha was informed on Tuesday.

 The minister of state for human resource development, M.A.A. Fatmi, said the S.K. Joshi committee had shortlisted seven institutions with the best potential among engineering and technical colleges for the upgrade.

 The shortlisted institutions are the Institute of Technology of Benaras Hindu University, University College of Engineering and University College of Technology of Osmania University, Bengal Engineering College, Jadavpur University?s engineering and technology departments, Aligarh Muslim University?s Zakir Hussain College of Engineering and Technology, Andhra University College of Engineering and Cochin University of Science and Technology.

 Fatmi, however, said the committee had noted that the institutions fell below the level of the IITs and it would not be correct to upgrade these colleges straight away.

 Uttaranchal scandal ?plot?

 Dehradun (PTI): Assembly proceedings 

 in the Congress-ruled Uttaranchal were adjourned for the 

 second consecutive day on Tuesday as Harak Singh Rawat, 

 who had to resign as revenue minister in the wake of a sex 

 scandal, and some other members demanded a probe into the 

 ?conspiracy? and a discussion on it.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Indira Hridayesh rejected his party colleagues? demands for the discussion, saying the matter was sub judice. 

 ?We cannot discuss this issue in the House as Rawat has filed a defamation case in a court in Dehra Dun in this regard,? Hridayesh said.

 When the House resumed, an agitated Rawat, who was exonerated in the sex scandal, called for suspension of question hour and an immediate discussion. He demanded that a committee be set up to probe the ?conspiracy? that forced him to resign on June 18, 2003.

 Several other Congress members lent support to Rawat?s demand for discussion. To embarrass the treasury benches further, Opposition members belonging to the BJP and the the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal supported the call.

 George caught in Sonia row

 Sonia

New Delhi, March 10: The Rashtriya Janata Dal has pounced on George Fernandes?s alleged remarks against Sonia Gandhi to settle scores with him and demonstrate its ?allegiance? to the Congress chief.

 In a TV interview, the NDA convener had reportedly said that after the UPA came to power, Sonia has created an ?Emergency-like? situation and would meet the ?same fate? as her mother-in-law Indira Gandhi.

 Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for a while today after RJD members brandished newspaper clippings and a CD containing the ?offending? comment.

 RJD?s Ram Kirpal Yadav demanded the NDA leader?s arrest and said by ?fate?, he had meant Sonia?s ?life would end the same way as Indira Gandhi?s?. 

 Fernandes today explained that he had referred to Sonia?s ?dictatorial attitude? and said ?her fate would be the same as that of Indira Gandhi after Emergency was revoked and elections were held in which the Congress had to bite the dust?.

 Congress sources brushed aside Fernandes?s ?clarification?, saying it has come only after they cried foul. Spokesperson Anand Sharma said the tirade is ?part of a diabolical plan? because the UPA has expedited the probe in the Tehelka tapes?. The CBI has instituted cases against Jaya Jaitly and he has lost his mind?.

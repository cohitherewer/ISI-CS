 AIIMS gets a rap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences has come under fire from Parliament?s public accounts committee for giving little importance to research.

 ?The committee has been constrained to point out that AIIMS, established as a teaching hospital for developing excellence in medical education and research, has grown into a large hospital without adequate emphasis on teaching or research,? the report said. 

 The condemnation came because the panel felt the country?s premier medical school has forgotten its charter, which emphasises quality teaching and serious studies. Barely one to two per cent of its budget is allocated for research, according to the report, which was presented in the Lok Sabha.

 The panel said research has been adversely affected also due to laxity shown by institute authorities to monitor projects. Several projects have not been reviewed even after recommendations from the committee as far back as the fifth Lok Sabha.

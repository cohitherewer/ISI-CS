 London, Nov. 8: The Football Association, the games ruling body in Britain, seems determined to attract more players of Indian and Pakistani origin into the sport at the highest levels.

 At a conference in Leicester yesterday, held to discuss the future of Asians in football, Simon Johnson, the FAs director of corporate affairs, said: We are absolutely committed to making progress in this area. We at the FA have got a role to rid the game of discrimination at all levels. Football has got to be as reflective of society as possible, from the players and referees to the administrators.

 The FA is investing ?1.2 million in grassroots football to provide a team of development officers whose job will be partly to target the ethnic minorities.

 In 1996, a report, ironically titled Asians cant play football, examined Asian alienation from football. A follow-up report published last month, called Asians can play football, was the main topic of discussion at the conference in Leicester.

 Britains minister for sport Richard Caborn also addressed the conference and stressed: We need a game that has a governance that is truly representative of modern Britain and I hope we can get that in place. That will be the quantum leap, when footballs institutions are reflective of the wider community.

 At the moment, there is a near absence of role models with only four Asian players in top flight football ? Zesh Rehman (Fulham), Harpal Singh (Stockport County), Michael Chopra (Newcastle United) and Adnan Ahmed (Huddersfield Town).

 There had been hopes that Rehman, who is of Pakistani origin, would pull on an England shirt but the 22-year-old has become so tired of waiting that he intends turning up for Pakistan against Bangladesh on November 11.

 Although this will render him ineligible to play for England, UK-born Rehman told the weekly Eastern Eye newspaper in London that he was tired of waiting. I have to be realistic ? if Im going to get an international career of my own, Ill have to play for my own country (Pakistan).

 Harpal, 25, who now plays for Stockport County, was once part of the Leeds United youth set-up. He won high praise from George Graham, the former Leeds manager, who told a local newspaper: Liverpool may have Michael Owen, but we have Harpal Singh.

 Harpal, who comes from Pudsey in Leeds, revealed: I started playing football as soon as I could walk. Ive always known its going to be different with me being Asian but Im proud to be Asian and dont see that as a problem. I want to be the first Asian player to make it.

 At Huddersfield Town, midfielder Adnan, 20, has been given a two-year contract by his boss, Peter Jackson, who remarked: I gave him his first start against Luton and he was excellent, and he deserves this extension. 

 Adnan, whose parents came from Pakistan, said: Our fans have been unbelievable towards me, theyve taken to me and they really are a great bunch of fans. But at away games, some of them are going to be ignorant people. Hopefully, Ive got to set an example where I dont react to it (racist abuse), and hopefully people will respect that.

 Michael Chopra, the son of an Indian father and an English mother, made history in July 1999, when he played for England Under-16s against Argentina at Wembley. He was then 15, scored the winning goal in Englands 2-1 victory and was named Man of the Match.

 The Newcastle United striker declared: I want to win the World Cup for England and I want to win the Championship for Newcastle.

 Barely 20 years ago, the handful of black players in Britain at the top had to tolerate an almost unbelievable degree of racism. Today, even though racism has not completely disappeared, a quarter of the players in the premier league are either black or mixed race. They have become glamorous, high-earning celebrities.

 One man who has campaigned to increase Asian representation in football is Jaswinder Bains, author of the book Corner Flags and Corner Shops and also the two reports on Asians in football.

 Bains, chairman of the National Asians in Football Forum, told a conference: We, the Asian football community, are not satisfied with the progress made. The Football Association promised to take ownership of the agenda and implement many recommendations in the (first) report. The stark reality is that, 10 years on, we have four players of Asian origin playing professional football and an almost negligible representation in academies and centres of excellence.

 Bains has appealed to Rehman not to turn out for Pakistan, not yet anyway. We have a lot of hope resting on your future, Zesh. Can you just give it a couple of years and see how it goes? If things do not work out, you can play for Pakistan with our blessing, he said.

 Red Fort attack militant nailed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: A Lashkar-e-Toiba militant and six others were convicted in the Red Fort attack case today, nearly five years after terrorists stormed the 17th century monument.

 On December 22, 2000, Lashkar militants sneaked into the fort and killed two jawans and a civilian.

 At the Karkardooma courts today, additional sessions judge .P. Saini held Mohammad Arif alias Ashfaq, a Pakistani, and his key Indian conspirators ? Nazir Ahmed Qasid and his son Farooq Ahmad Qasid ? guilty of waging war against the state. The charge could attract death sentence. The punishment will be pronounced on October 29.

 Ashfaq was also found guilty of murder, criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, illegal possession of arms and of illegally entering and staying in India. Nazir and Farooq were also convicted of criminal conspiracy.

 Ashfaqs Indian wife Rehmana Yousuf Farooqui, who was the lone woman accused, was acquitted of the charges of conspiracy and waging war against the state but found guilty under IPC sections of 216 (for harbouring an offender) and 218 (for trying to save a person from punishment).

 Three others ? Babar Mohsin Baghwala, Sadaqat Ali and Matloob Alam ? were convicted for complicity in the attack. Sadaqat had provided shelter to Ashfaq in south Delhis Okhla area, where they ran an Internet caf? for a month before the attack. They were also in touch with the other accused in Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan. 

 At Baghwalas Srinagar house, Ashfaq, Nazir and Farooq plotted the attack. Matloob Alam, a ration shop owner was found guilty for helping Ashfaq procure a fake ration card using forged documents.

 The court, however, acquitted Rajeev Kumar Malhotra, Devender Singh, Moolchand Sharma and Shahanshah Alam as the prosecution could not prove that they had provided Ashfaq a driving licence.

 Ashfaq and Rehmana were arrested four days after the attack following an encounter in south Delhi.

 The special cell filed a chalan against Ashfaq and 21 accused on January 7, 2003. Eight were declared proclaimed offenders, while three suspected Lashkar militants ? Abu Shyamal, Abu Sufian and Abu Bilal ?were killed in encounters. On December 4, 2002, the court framed charges against the 11 accused.

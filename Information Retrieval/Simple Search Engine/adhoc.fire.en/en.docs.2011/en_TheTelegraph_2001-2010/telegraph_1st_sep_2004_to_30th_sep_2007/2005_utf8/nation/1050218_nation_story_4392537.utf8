 Ransom call for wife amp; dowry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Most kidnappers abduct for money alone but at least one has done so to get back his wife as well.

 Manoj Patel, who has a chemicals business in Gujarat, allegedly kidnapped his father-in-law, Baldev Raj Sethi, on Monday and issued a list of demands.

 These included Rs 10 lakh in cash, his wife Archana?s passport, her jewellery and the withdrawal of dowry case and divorce cases filed against him.

 He is said to have asked for Archana to meet him with the booty in Ahmedabad.

 ?Basically, he wants all the FIRs cancelled. We are not sure about his exact motive but he said that Archana should come alone to Ahmedabad with the money and jewellery,? her brother Praveen said.

 Sethi, a Delhi University professor of physics, was whisked off by three persons in a Honda City car when he went for a walk around 7 am near his New Mahavir Nagar house in west Delhi, police said.

 Two hours later, his family received calls from a person who, they alleged, was the husband of Sethi?s youngest daughter Archana.

 Patel, the son of a retired deputy superintendent of Gujarat police, and Archana had married for love but it turned sour within a year and a half.

 Archana walked out on him apparently in protest against his dowry demand and recently filed for divorce. She also filed a case of dowry harassment against her husband.

 Sources said police teams have been sent to Gujarat to locate him. Patel?s father in Ahmedabad is reported to have told police that he does not have anything to do with his son.

 The last call Patel made to the Sethi house, police sources said, was from Ahmedabad, where his parents live.

 The Sethis, they said, talked to the professor on phone after he went missing when he told them that Patel had kidnapped him.

 Delhi police are monitoring the calls being made to the Sethi house and have procured the records of Patel?s mobile phone.

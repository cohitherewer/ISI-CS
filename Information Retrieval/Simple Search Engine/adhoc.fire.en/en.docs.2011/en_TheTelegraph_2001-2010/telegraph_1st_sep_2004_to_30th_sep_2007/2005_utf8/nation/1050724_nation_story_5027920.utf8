 French happy, but wary

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, July 23: France is happy the US is finally ready to accept India as a responsible nuclear state ? a line it claims the French leadership has been advocating for seven years. But it is not sure if the growing Indo-US ties will be at its expense and reduce France to being a marginal player in the subcontinent.

 It clearly vindicates our position. We have been advocating that Indias position vis-?-vis the Nuclear Suppliers Group must be clarified. It is something that is well-known to the Indian government, a senior French official said.

 The reference was to the agreement Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed with President George W. Bush on civilian nuclear energy in Washington earlier this week.

 The official response from Paris has been guarded. France takes positive note of the important agreement between the US and India on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

 This development is in line with the effort initiated by President Chirac several years ago, in particular in the G8, to allow major emerging industrial countries, whose needs for clean energy are considerable, access to civilian nuclear energy, it said.

 The official spokesperson of the French foreign ministry said in Paris on Wednesday anything done in this regard must be compatible with the non-proliferation regime.

 France is pleased in this regard that the agreement between the US and India comprises an announcement by India of initial steps to move closer to nuclear non-proliferation norms, he added.

 As far as France is concerned, Indias commitment to maintain a moratorium on nuclear tests and open its civilian nuclear facilities to IAEA inspection are steps in the right direction. But the segregation of civilian and military nuclear facilities will be difficult and time-consuming and, French officials feel, will take some years to be implemented.

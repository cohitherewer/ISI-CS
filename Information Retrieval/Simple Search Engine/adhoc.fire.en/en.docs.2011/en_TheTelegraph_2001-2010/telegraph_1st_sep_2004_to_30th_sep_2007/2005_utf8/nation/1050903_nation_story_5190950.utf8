 Job plan put on fast track

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: Plans to implement the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, are on the fast track even before it has been notified. 

 Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh today said his ministry is already framing guidelines about how one person from each rural household in 200 districts will be given employment guarantee for 100 days in the next one year.

 The minister asked intellectuals, social scientists, economists, MPs, activists and NGOs to come forward with suggestions on how the act can be implemented effectively. The whole world is watching us. We have to make this work, he said. 

 We are in the process of making a rulebook for successful implementation. But fruitful suggestions are welcome from all quarters. We are ready to incorporate any idea that facilitates implementation of this important programme.

 Work will start almost immediately after the government announces the launch of the programme. Initially, 150 districts that have been identified by the Planning Commission on the basis of their SC/ST population, wage status and productivity will be covered under the act. 

 The Planning Commission has already started identifying 50 additional districts. So, in the first one year we will cover 200 districts, Singh said.

 The act is expected to cover 600 districts in five years. It marks a paradigm shift in development strategies for the poor.

 It is a legal guarantee to the rural poor. The Centre has already pledged 90 per cent of the funds required to implement the act. The remaining 10 per cent will come from the states coffers. The logic, Singh said, is that employment generation in the act has been fused with sustainable infrastructure development. 

 The rural poor would be employed for activities such as water conservation, drought proofing, building irrigation canals, renovation of traditional water bodies and land development. The state will get benefits of this programme, so why should they not be a part of the process? They are the beneficiaries, said the minister.

 The programme is expected to be launched as soon as the act is notified. We are ready with a plan. The implementation will follow as soon as the government takes a decision to announce a launch date, Singh said.

 Slaughter in the name of tradition

 GAUTAM SARKAR

 Chandan (Banka), April 28: Blood flows freely in the forests of Chandan block, on the foothills of the Dahua hills, in Banka district.

 More than 300 tribals have gone on a killing spree as part of the ?Shikar Mela?, a weeklong hunting festival, which began on April 22.

 Inspired by ?Bishu Shikar?, celebrated by the Pahariya tribes of Santhal Pargana in Jharkhand, the local tribals have organised a similar festival in the forests of Banka. 

 Besides the local tribals, communities like Gulgulias and Banjaras, too, take part in the festival. They not only kill animals but also destroy trees in a bid to ?improve visibility?. A large number of participants have come from places like Purulia in West Bengal and Dumka, Godda and Deoghar in Jharkhand. 

 ?It is an old ritual of ours. We have been forced to come here due to restrictions in other places,? said Binoy Manjhi, who has come all the way from Bengal. 

 ?The Gulgulias and Banjaras, too, join us because of the food and drinks. Since they are skilled hunters, we allow them to accompany us,? a local tribal said.

 Armed with nets, bows, arrows and other traditional weapons, five groups of youths in their early twenties have ventured into the forest with hunting dogs. The women and children, who are not allowed to participate, have to wait in the makeshift tents outside the forests.

 Till April 24, nine wolves, four deer, 10 peacocks, 15 rabbits, 25 wild hens and 19 pigs had been killed. Besides, the tribals also hunt wild rats, hares and even birds.

 ?The pradhan (headman) of every group has to ensure discipline. He performs pujas and sacrifices animals before the hunters leave for the forests. He also distributes the flesh of the dead animals among the participants to avoid disputes,? said Babulal Baski. 

 Blowing horns and beating drums, the hunters entered the forests early in the morning at the end of the rituals. 

 The district administration claimed to be unaware of the festival. ?We have not received any information of a hunting festival. The tribals may have killed some animals, but it is common practice among them,? said a senior official. The district magistrate was not available for comment.

 But the police, it seemed, knew what was going on. A local hunter said the policemen posted at Chandan police station have asked the tribals to send meat every evening during the festival. 

 Forest officials in the district admitted their inability to prevent the ?unwanted guests? from going on a killing spree. ?It is not possible for us to prevent the hunters from killing animals. Besides, they seem to have the support of some local policemen,? said a senior official on condition of anonymity.

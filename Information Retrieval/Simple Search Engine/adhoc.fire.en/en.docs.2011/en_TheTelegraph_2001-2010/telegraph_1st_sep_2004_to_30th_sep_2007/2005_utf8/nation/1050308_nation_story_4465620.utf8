 Cycles and cash to keep girls at school

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, March 7: The Naveen Patnaik government in Orissa has lined up a slew of sops to prevent girls from dropping out of primary and upper primary schools.

 The incentives, to be doled out to about 14 lakh students, include free uniforms, cash rewards and cycles.

 The government has selected 142 educationally-backward blocks in the Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi region, Sundargarh, Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar districts for the scheme, which will commence in the 2005-06 academic session. 

 If the government manages to stem dropouts among girls through the scheme, it could extend the same to the remaining 172 blocks.

 The academic prospects of a large number of girls are bleak owing to widespread poverty. The families are forced to make their children, especially girls, work to earn the daily bread.

 In 2003-04, about 34 per cent of girl students dropped out of primary schools while the corresponding figure for primary schools was 57.5 per cent. The dropout rate for boys at the primary level was lower.

 Realising the urgent need to stem dropouts, the school and mass education department has decided to give two pairs of new school uniforms, cash rewards of Rs 1,000 each to students achieving 100 per cent attendance and three cycles to each of the 2,800 model cluster schools. 

 At present, about 33.34 lakh girls in the age group of 5-13 study in nearly 55,000 primary schools of the state.

 Chairing a departmental meeting today, school and mass education minister Nagendra Pradhan said the programme would bring a revolution in the primary education system. ?It will be a landmark exercise,? he said. 

 The scheme, which is being planned under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, will be implemented by the Orissa Primary Education Programme Authority.

 Director of the authority Santosh Sarangi said the government has laid emphasis on girl?s education its bid to bridge the gender gap in enrolment retention. He added that while the state is yet to calculate the exact amount needed for the scheme, it would share the funding with the Centre in the ratio of 25:75. 

 School and mass education secretary Gagan Dhal is in Delhi at present to arrange the funds. 

 Admitting that the mid-day meal programme has outlived its utility in retaining girls, Sarangi hoped that the incentive of new uniforms and cash rewards will do the trick.

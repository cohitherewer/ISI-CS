 A drink not too many for road: Court

 New Delhi, Oct. 30 (PTI): One drink cannot make a person lose control over his faculties, a Delhi consumer court said today as it directed Life Insurance Corporation to pay up the amount due to the widow of a man who died in a road accident in 2002.

 LIC had failed to prove with cogent evidence that the insured (person) was under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident which resulted in his death, the New Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum said.

 Observing that rejection of legitimate claim amounts to deficiency in service, the court directed LIC to pay the insured sum of Rs 2,60,000 to Sumitra Gupta, the nominee of the deceased, with nine per cent interest per annum from April 6, 2004 ? the day her claim was rejected.

 The court also awarded Rs 2,000 as cost of litigation to Sumitra, who had filed a complaint this year.

 Her husband Mahendra, who had taken four policies with double accident benefit from LIC with an assured sum of Rs 2,60,000, died in October 2002, when his motorcycle collided with a police vehicle.

 According to an FIR lodged by the pillion rider of the bike, the two had a drink each shortly before the accident.

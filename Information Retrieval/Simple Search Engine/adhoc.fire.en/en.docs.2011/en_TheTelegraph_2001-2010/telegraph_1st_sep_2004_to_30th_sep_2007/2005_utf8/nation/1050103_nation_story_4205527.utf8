 Assam alert on food stocks

 PROBIR PRAMANIK

 Guwahati, Jan. 2: The Assam government today instructed all district heads to stockpile essential commodities and activated its emergency wings in the wake of an earthquake warning sounded by a US agency.

 Yesterday, scientists at the Center for Earth Observing and Space Research at George Mason University in Virginia ? who have been analysing seismic data since the tsunami disaster on December 26 ?found the aftershocks moving north and warned this could trigger a major quake in Assam.

 Even though Delhi has not sent any missive regarding the quake warning, chief minister Tarun Gogoi convened an emergency high-level meeting of officials at his residence this evening to sensitise all state and central agencies to meet any eventuality.

 ?Though we are yet to receive an official intimation from the Centre, we have taken cognisance of media reports,? the chief minister told The Telegraph.

 ?Apart from sensitising our officials, we have also alerted the army?s 4 Corps in Tezpur. They have assured us all help. We cannot just wait for disaster to happen. However, there is no need to press the panic button yet,? he said.

 Chief secretary S. Kabilan said that Dispur has also issued strict orders against hoarding by unscrupulous traders in view of the warning. The stockpiling, Kabilan said, will be for the short term, ?say, a week?s stock kept by the respective district authorities?.

 The official added that all deputy commissioners have been asked to keep a close tab on the Food Corporation of India?s stock register and the stock released through the public distribution system to distributors and traders.

 The government has set up a disaster management cell, headed by the additional chief secretary, to oversee stockpiling of food and other emergency material. The cell, along with NGOs, will conduct survival drills and awareness programmes.

 Kabilan said Dispur was in touch with various international and national agencies, including the Orissa and Gujarat state disaster management authorities. ?We are not taking any chances as warnings of a quake hitting the region are coming almost every day.?

 Gogoi said: ?We plan to create awareness among the masses about the effects of such an earthquake and will conduct a weeklong awareness drive all over the state, right up to the panchayat level.?

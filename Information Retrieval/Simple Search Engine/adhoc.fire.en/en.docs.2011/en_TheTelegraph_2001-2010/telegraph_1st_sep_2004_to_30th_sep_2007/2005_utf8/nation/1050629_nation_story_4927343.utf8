 Flood recce team runs into Tibet snow wall

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Shimla, June 28: Crucial leads on how bad the floods in Himachal Pradesh might become stayed out of reach today as rain and snow prevented a Chinese technical team from reaching the Pare Chu rivers source in Tibet.

 In Himachals flood-ravaged Kinnaur, where Sonia Gandhi is likely to head from Shimla tomorrow, 45 of some 400 stranded tourists were airlifted before air turbulence stopped the air forces rescue missions.

 Large parts of Himachal are under water because of flooding by the Sutlej and its tributary Pare Chu. 

 A team from Tibets capital, Lhasa, was to travel to the Pare Chu lake to assess the situation and see why it burst its banks, causing the floods in India.

 Beijing, however, has told India that bad weather has stalled the plan, with the team now expected to leave only on Thursday.

 Besides, the remote monitoring system put in place by China has frozen because of heavy snowfall.

 We are very much concerned about the impact of the floods on Pare Chu on the Indian side, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said in Beijing. 

 We have already on several occasions given information and urged the Indian side to take necessary precautions to fight the flood, Jianchao added.

 In Kinnaur, 45 tourists including 29 foreigners were evacuated, said sub-divisional magistrate Kamal Kant Saroch. 

 There are still 70-80 foreigners trapped, added police chief Arvind Sharda.

 Sonia Gandhi will arrive on Wednesday at Rekong Peo, district headquarters of Kinnaur, to assess the situation, Sharda said. Sonia is holidaying in Shimla with daughter Priyanka Vadra.

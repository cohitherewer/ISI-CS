 Laloo bid to ?expose? BJP

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhagalpur, Jan. 20: Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav today threatened to ?expose? the ?fascist agenda? of the BJP and claimed that he had not manipulated the Godhra report.

 ?I?m not politicising the issue? I just want to let the people know what is right and what is wrong. Let them know the facts. I want to expose the BJP and other fascist forces,? he said at a rally here. 

 Laloo Prasad also lambasted Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan and said the latter has created a new record when it came to the criminalisation of politics. 

 The RJD chief had to deal with dissidents in the Bhagalpur unit of the RJD, who were against the candidature of Shambhu Dayal Kathan, chairman of the district board, from the Bhagalpur Town constituency.

 Laloo seat jitters for Congress

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Laloo Prasad Yadav is generous with cash for the Prime Minister?s relief fund but not with seats for his party in the coming Assembly polls.

 Today, accompanied by his wife, Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, the Union railway minister called on Manmohan Singh to present a cheque for Rs 10 crore, on behalf of the railways, towards relief for the tsunami-hit. Rabri Devi presented another cheque for Rs 10 crore on Bihar?s behalf, putting the Rs 2.5 crore from Mulayam Singh Yadav?s Uttar Pradesh in the shade.

 The railway has thus made a contribution of Rs 25 crore, including a Rs 15-crore cheque presented earlier.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, however, is playing hard to get regarding seats and insists that his party will contest 200 of the 243 seats in Bihar, sources said.

 He is also tying the Bihar seat-sharing with that in Jharkhand to restrict the Congress? bargaining power, demanding 25 of the new state?s 81 seats or risk the RJD sticking to 200 in Bihar. Laloo Prasad is also egging on Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren to drive a hard bargain with the Congress. The parties are allies in the UPA at the Centre.

 The Congress had hoped that the RJD chief would talk it out with human resource development minister Arjun Singh, who heads the Congress? seat-sharing panel for the states. But the railway minister left for Patna by the afternoon flight.

 Only five days are left to begin nominations for the first phase of polls on February 3.

 The Congress is seeking 100-odd seats in Bihar. Party sources said Laloo Prasad, whose RJD rules the state, may agree to spare only 30-odd seats for the Congress but wants it to contest 60 to 70 more in upper-caste regions just to split anti-Laloo votes and thus harm the rival National Democratic Alliance.

 No tangible deal, however, has been worked out so far though second-rung Congress leaders have been talking since Sunday to senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh.

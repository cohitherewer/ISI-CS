 Cong to take over in Kashmir

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has been asked to make way for a Congress chief minister in Jammu and Kashmir next month when his three-year term ends.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered the Peoples Democratic Party leader a cabinet berth at the Centre since his party is a member of the ruling coalition, sources said. But he turned down the offer, saying he did not want any deal. 

 Mufti was tourism minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government in the mid-1980s and later held the home portfolio in the V.P. Singh government.

 The Congress decision was conveyed to Mufti when he separately met Sonia and Singh yesterday. The two leaders told the chief minister their party was ready to lead the Congress-PDP coalition ministry from November in line with the power rotation arrangement agreed upon three years ago. 

 Urban development and parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is the Congress choice for chief minister.

 According to the October 2002 agreement, the PDP was to get the top post for the first three years of the Assemblys six-year term and the Congress was to take over after that.

 Mufti has gone on record many times to say he would honour the pact but his party had possibly reckoned the Congress would favour continuation of status quo. Ambiguous voices from the Congress about enforcing the power-rotation pact reinforced this line of thought.

 Azad, who heads the PDP-Congress coalition co-ordination committee, was chosen as the chief ministerial candidate by Congress MLAs in 2002. But he did not get the post when Sonia gave up the partys claim in favour of the PDP in the larger national interest.

 Azad is reluctant to leave the Union ministry but Sonia told him last week he would have to take up the responsibility in Srinagar, the sources said.

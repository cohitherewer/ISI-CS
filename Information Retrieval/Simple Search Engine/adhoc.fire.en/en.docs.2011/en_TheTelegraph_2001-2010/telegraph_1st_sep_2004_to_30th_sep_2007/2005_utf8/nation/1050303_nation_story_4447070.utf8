 ?Inner voice? comes home to roost 

 - unease in congress 

 Power rush: Sonia 

 Uncomfortable questions are being raised in the United Progressive Alliance, and even in the Congress, over Shibu Soren?s dramatic installation as Jharkhand chief minister.

 The rush to wrest power, which has come to be associated with Sonia Gandhi as she had anointed Soren the alliance leader on Tuesday, is standing out in sharp contrast with the moral sheen the Congress president acquired when she declined to become Prime Minister in May.

 Officially, the party defended the ascent of the Soren government, saying it had nothing to do with the Congress but was a decision taken by governor Syed Sibtey Razi.

 ?Soniaji?s sacrifice of the highest executive office does not mean that we will hand over state after state to the BJP. If the BJP has the right to cobble together the numbers to form the government, how can we not have the same right?? asked spokesperson Anand Sharma.

 Sharma said the governor?s action was correct and this would be confirmed when the Soren government proves its majority.

 But several senior party leaders, including Union ministers, did not think their ?inner voice? would have permitted them to take steps that cannot be ?politically or morally? defended without inviting public censure.

 ?Given the fractured mandate, can we expect the new government in Jharkhand to be stable regardless of who forms it? So, why should we be so eager to form the government? Also, can the Congress benefit in the next election with a controversial leader like Shibu Soren, who belongs to another party, as our chief minister?? asked a minister.

 Sonia had cited her inner voice when she stepped aside to allow Manmohan Singh to become Prime Minister.

 Another minister said defending the Jharkhand move would be ?very inconvenient?. ?I can?t defend it. I don?t think it can be defended without diluting our commitment to be morally and politically correct,? he said.

 Those not approving of the development said Sonia?s cause ? to strengthen the party while it is heading the ruling alliance at the Centre ? could have been better served by a better team of advisers.

 A Left leader, too, felt the move was difficult to defend. But he thought the situation had arisen not because Sonia was keen to have a UPA government in the state but ?because of some grey areas in the Constitution.? 

 ?I don?t think Sonia or Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would have directed the developments in Ranchi from Delhi. The governor, being a Congressman, would have used his discretionary powers to favour the Congress-JMM combine,? he said.

 Not everyone was as kind. A member of a UPA constituent, who said he was under instruction from ?my leader not to talk about Sonia for a month?, said Congress workers should stop talking about the ?great sacrifice of their leader?.

 ?They (Congress members) thought the image of sacrifice of their leader would bring them dividends in Bihar and Jharkhand. Believing so, they did not bother about taking the allies together. Now, she has lost Jharkhand and she could not improve the party?s tally in Bihar. Sonia?s gains are by default,? he said.

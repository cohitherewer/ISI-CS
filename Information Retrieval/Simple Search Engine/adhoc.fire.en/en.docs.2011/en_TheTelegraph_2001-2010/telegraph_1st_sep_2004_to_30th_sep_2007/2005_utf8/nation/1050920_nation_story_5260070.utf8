 Beauty specialist in sleaze CD net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: Police today arrested a naturopath specialising in beauty care treatment on charges of allegedly filming unsuspecting female patients in his clinic after seizing a CD containing pornographic video clips.

 Acting on a complaint lodged by an unidentified woman with the help of a local non-government organisation, Malad police today arrested Pradeep Parmar on charges of possessing obscene material. 

 Along with his doctor wife, Parmar runs five beauty care clinics in the city.

 The complainant had given the police a CD, which contained video clips of the doctor having sex with his patients.

 Confirming the arrest, the deputy commissioner of Zone X, Dattatray Karale, said: Yes, we have arrested Parmar based on the complaint. We are still investigating the case, and are yet to confirm the identity of the woman complainant.

 The CD was given to the police by a local NGO, Shiv Sangram, which alleged that the Gujarati doctor, who holds a diploma in natural beauty therapy, exploited female patients by first filming them nude in his clinic and then blackmailed them into having one-night stands with him at a city hotel. 

 The doctor denies the allegations, and has told the police that the sex was consensual.

 The doctor has denied that he exploited his female patients. He says the sex was always consensual. We are still at a preliminary stage of inquiry, Karale said.

 Parmar and his wife run beauty care clinics at Malad, Thane, Ghatkopar, Santa Cruz and Grant Road. The NGO has written to deputy chief minister R.R. Patil and police commissioner Anami Roy demanding a high-level probe.

 Muslim quotas in cold water again

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 7: The Congress governments attempt to provide for 5 per cent reservation in jobs and educational institutions for Muslims in Andhra Pradesh came unstuck again after the high court today quashed the legislation for lack of proper assessment.

 A five-member division bench, headed by Chief Justice Bilal Nazki, struck down the legislation passed last month, saying the survey by the backward class commission was inadequate.

 The court said the assessment appears to have been done in a haste by assessing minorities in only nine of the 23 districts of the state.

 The commission, whose report formed the basis of the quota order, had said more than 60 per cent of Muslims in the state did not have a job, while only two out of every 10 Muslims had cleared Class X.

 The same court had last year quashed the then four-month-old Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy governments order providing 5 per cent reservation for Muslims and directed the Congress regime to appoint a backward class commission to do a proper survey.

 After todays order, a jubilant BJP ridiculed what it said were attempts by the Congress to convert Muslims into a vote bank. I am happy that the court has turned down reservations based on religion, said party vice-president Bandaru Dattatreya.

 Its a victory for the backward classes and a jolt for the Congress, which was trying to appease one community to gain political mileage, said state unit chief N. Indrasena Reddy.

 The BJP was the only party to oppose reservations for Muslims when the ordinance came up in the Assembly and had walked out in protest.

 The bill was also challenged by backward classes unions, which contended that they would lose existing benefits as the 5 per cent reservation took the quota in the state beyond the 50 per cent ceiling.

 Chief minister Reddy dubbed the high court order subjective interpretation and stressed that it was not a political setback. It is not a political defeat for us. It has only further strengthened our resolve to take up more welfare activities for minorities in the state.

 Advocate-general V. Mohan Reddy said the government would file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court in a week. The court has not found any mala fide intentions with our purpose of legislation. It is only a technical snag, which will be set right in earnest soon, he said.

 The judgment came in the wake of a batch of petitions filed by student bodies and backward class associations, which questioned the validity of the governments move to categorise Muslims as a separate group among the backward classes.

 The bench, however, stayed for four weeks the operation of the verdict in case of students of professional institutions as the academic session had already started.

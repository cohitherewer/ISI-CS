 Jaya case merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 27: A special court has allowed Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaas plea for a joint trial of two cases against her.

 Justice A.S. Pachhapure ordered the merger of records of the case related to ownership of a London hotel with those of the unaccounted wealth charge, which is the main case. Jayalalithaa has been accused of accumulating Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate to her income.

 I am of the opinion that it would be just, proper and in the interest of justice to merge the records of the second case in the records of the main case and proceed in accordance with the law, the judge ruled.

 He said the prosecution had erred on two counts. First, it had violated an undertaking that letter rogatory would not be misused during investigation. Second, the evidence of ownership of the hotel in London was recorded while the main case was being probed. 

 The chargesheet in the second case has to be dealt as a further report in the main case, the judge said. 

 Special prosecutor B.V. Acharya refused to say whether the order would be challenged at the next hearing on June 29.

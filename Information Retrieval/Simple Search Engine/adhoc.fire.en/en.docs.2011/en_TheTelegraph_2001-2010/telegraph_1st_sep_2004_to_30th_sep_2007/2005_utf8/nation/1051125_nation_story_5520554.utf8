 Abu in police hands, scared

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Salem

 Mumbai, Nov. 24: Abu Salems worst fears have come true. Today, a court remanded him in police custody till December 2.

 Salem has reportedly indicated to CBI officers interrogating him, as well as to his lawyers, that he fears torture in Mumbai police custody.

 The Tada court of judge Pradeep Bavkar rejected Salems appeals for home food and permission to meet his brother and sent him to Bhojwada police station lock-up in Wadala.

 Bavkar had earlier issued a production warrant against Salem following an application by special public prosecutor Rohini Salian as anti-terrorist squad (ATS) officials wanted to probe the 1995 murder of builder Pradeep Jain.

 Today around 4.45 pm, Salem was produced at Bavkars court on the premises of the city civil and sessions court in south Mumbai.

 The court has granted him permission to meet his lawyer for 15 minutes between 8.00 am and 8.30 am in the lock-up.

 Salems lawyer Ashok Sarogi said the don was very tense after the court order on his police remand. Salem was worried when I spoke to him for a short while after the order was read out. He said he was afraid that the ATS may use third degree with him to make him confess quickly because they want to wrap up the investigations fast.

 Yesterday, Salem lived it up in judicial custody which allowed him home-cooked food, clothing, proper bedding and medicines at the Arthur Road jail. He also met his old friends from D-company at the jail, who are believed to have been particularly nice to him. 

 His food was ordered from the gourmet Mughlai joint Delhi Darbar and he ate gosht biryani for dinner.

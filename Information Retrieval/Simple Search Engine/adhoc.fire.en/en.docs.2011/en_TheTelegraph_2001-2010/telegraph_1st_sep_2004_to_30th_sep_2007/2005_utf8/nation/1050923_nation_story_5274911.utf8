 Congress in Srinagar spot

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Mufti Mohammad Sayeed: Will he stay?

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: With just over five weeks to go before it is the Congresss turn to head the Jammu and Kashmir government, the party has yet to decide whether it wants to rule at all.

 The high command now plans to hold a meeting of state leaders to discuss the power-sharing arrangement with the Peoples Democratic Party.

 According to the October 2002 agreement, the allies had decided to take turns to run the government, with the PDP getting the first shot. Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds tenure as chief minister ends on November 2, after which the Congresss three-year term will begin.

 General secretary Ambika Soni said the meeting, to be attended by legislators, all elected representatives at district and block levels and other state leaders, would be held in Jammu. Sonia Gandhi is likely to preside over it.

 Ahead of the November 2 date for transfer of power, Sonia might also address public meetings in the state to gauge the public mood.

 State Congress leaders are eagerly awaiting the partys turn to head the coalition government and have been mounting pressure on the high command to take an early decision on leadership. Leading the government would offer a huge opportunity to strengthen the party organisation, particularly in the Kashmir valley, they argue.

 However, the party high command is not sure whether the existing coalition arrangement under Mufti should be disturbed. 

 Sonia has not revealed her mind so far. Viewing the matter from a national perspective, she is believed to be reluctant to ask Mufti to step down. Three years ago, she had given up the Congresss claim to the chief ministers post although it had won more seats than the PDP.

 PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has announced that the party will honour the power-sharing agreement. But she believes the Congress will ask her father to continue as chief minister, sources said.

 The planned meeting in Jammu may see the high command trying to convince the state party leaders to allow status quo to continue beyond November 2. As of now, however, Soni said: The Congress is committed to the terms of the three-year-old power-sharing agreement.

 The leadership issue is also a problem. Three years ago, Ghulam Nabi Azad was keen to become chief minister. Now urban development minister in the UPA government at the Centre, he appears to be unwilling to move to the state. The high command is not sure it has an alternative leader of stature to take over the responsibility, though there are at least four who are keen on the job, including former Union minister Saifuddin Soz and Mohammad Shafi Qureshi.

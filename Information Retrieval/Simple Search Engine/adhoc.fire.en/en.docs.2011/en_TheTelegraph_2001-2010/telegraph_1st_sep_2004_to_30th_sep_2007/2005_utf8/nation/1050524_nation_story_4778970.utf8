The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Proof of purchase key to case

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, May 23: Supreme Court lawyers were divided today on whether the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly, on the basis of governor Buta Singhs report asserting horse-trading of MLAs, is constitutionally tenable.

 Under Article 356 of the Constitution, an Assembly can be dissolved if the governor reports that the constitutional machinery has broken down and the state cannot any more continue as per the Constitution. 

 Three senior counsel who spoke to The Telegraph all agreed that horse-trading does amount to a subversion of the Constitution, but two of them were sceptical whether Singh has the evidence to back up his claim.

 Dissolving the Assembly is untenable on the basis of notional horse-trading, said the apex court-designated senior counsel and former Supreme Court Bar Association president M.N. Krishnamani.

 Unless the governor has proof ? like a videograph or photograph of an MLA or a group of legislators receiving a bribe or bargaining for switching sides ? the case could become a complicated one if anyone challenged the dissolution (in court).

 If an Assembly is dissolved over horse-trading, no party can form a government. Presidents rule would be imposed in every state on the basis of a governors report about notional horse-trading. It would lead to an anomalous situation and complicate the scheme of the Constitution. 

 Former Union law minister and senior counsel Shanti Bhushan, however, said: Purchasing MLAs is a way of subverting democracy, which amounts to a breakdown of the constitutional machinery. The Centre is right in dissolving the Bihar Assembly on the basis of the governors report on horse-trading.

 Krishnamani accepted the subversion of democracy part but not Bhushans conclusion.

 Who will prove that an MLA or a group of MLAs had bargained for money? he asked. Besides, a split in a political party is constitutionally allowed. Dissenting members of a party can part ways with the leadership and form a separate party. 

 In the case of Bihar, the LJP was breaking up ? or rather, had split already. The governor, to suit the needs of certain powers, has given such a report.

 He cited how both sides had engaged in horse-trading in Goa and the Assembly was dissolved only when the ruling side failed to muster enough support. There was no report on horse-trading. 

 This way, ministries cannot be formed in any state, especially in the era of coalitions. 

 Another constitutional lawyer, B. Devasekhar, said the Supreme Court had laid down in its judgment in the Bommai case that the dissolution of an Assembly must be ratified in Parliament and the governors report must contain a certain element of proof. 

 It is not up to the subjective satisfaction of a governor that he should recommend dissolution of the House, but an objective analysis of the situation. The dissolution is vulnerable to challenge, Devasekhar said.

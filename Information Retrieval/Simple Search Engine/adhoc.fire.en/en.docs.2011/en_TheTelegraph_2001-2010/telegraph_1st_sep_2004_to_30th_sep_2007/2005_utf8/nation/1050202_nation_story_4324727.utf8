 GRP twist in puff tale

 - ?Youth himself a smoker?

 OUR BUREAU 

 Bokaro/Bhubaneswar, Feb. 1: The Government Railway Police in Bokaro today had a different tale to tell about 24-year-old Samaresh Panda, who was allegedly pushed out of a running train on January 26.

 Contrary to what the youth had alleged, the FIR lodged with the GRP on January 27 suggested that he was not shoved off the running New Delhi-Puri Purushottam Express by three youths who were smoking inside the general compartment. Panda, who was himself smoking near the toilet, lost balance at a sharp curve 300 m from Bokaro railway station and fell from the train, it said.

 After his fall, Panda became unconscious and was later spotted by local tempo drivers in a critical condition. After they gave him an oil massage and informed railway authorities about the incident, stationmaster M.R. Patnaik and GRP sub-inspector R. Ranjan admitted Panda in Bokaro General Hospital on the morning of January 27.

 Talking to The Telegraph at the station, Ranjan said they found Panda?s address from a paper in his pocket and immediately contacted his family at Khurda Road in Orissa. 

 The local tempo and taxi drivers collected Rs 41,000 for Panda?s treatment, the sources said. Owner of the taxi stand, Sudhir Chowdhary, became the guarantor as the hospital authorities wanted someone to sign a few documents.

 ?No complaint was lodged with the GRP at that time. Later, Panda told us that he had an accidental fall. We contacted the family members of Panda and got his reservation confirmed for January 27 by Purushottam Express. He should have lodged a complaint if he faced any problem,? a GRP officer said.

 Reacting to the Bokaro GRP?s contention, Panda said he was asked to sign three blank papers at the police station. ?I was hardly in a condition to file a written complaint when I went there. The policemen there assured me that they will write the complaint and file a formal FIR. The auto-drivers who saved me have witnessed it,? he added.

 On the GRP?s contention that he was a smoker, Panda said, ?In my house nobody takes tea, forget tobacco products. I have never touched a cigarette in my life. The police are cooking up these stories to save their skin.? 

 The youth, now recuperating at home, further said: ?Neither the railway police nor the staff came to my rescue when I lay on the tracks for 12 hours. The auto-drivers were the ones who helped me.?

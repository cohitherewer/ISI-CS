New Delhi, Oct. 20: The BJPs attempt to make capital out of the Govinda tapes has run into rough weather within the party with heartland politics coming into play.

 Led by former minister Ram Naik, who lost to the actor in the Lok Sabha elections, BJPs Maharashtra representatives demanded Govindas resignation as Congress MP.

 The controversy broke last night when a television channel aired a clip showing Govinda with Dawood Ibrahim.

 Naik today released a photograph of Govinda posing with Dawood at the wedding of the gangsters erstwhile aide Chhota Rajan in Dubai. The former minister said the Congress leadership should ask the actor to leave the party.

 Govinda said the video was a political and filmi conspiracy to stop his comeback in the film industry. The footage belongs to 1988-89. Around 20 or 25 Bollywood artistes were taken to Dubai to perform at parties. The videos of these people were also recorded, but only footage showing me was shown to malign my image, the actor said in Mumbai.

 Govinda alleged that it is a Samajwadi Party conspiracy against me. Amar Singh wants to stop my comeback into the film industry. He is probably worried that I and Rahul Gandhi would campaign in UP. The outburst against Amar Singh, BJPs main adversary in Uttar Pradesh, seems to have won the actor an unlikely ally.

 Rising to the actors defence, former BJP MP and an accused in the Babri demolition, Vinay Katiyar, said: Nobody has the right to tarnish anyones image without getting complete information.

 Katiyar, who spoke to The Telegraph from Uttar Pradesh, added: I do not know Govinda personally but the footage appeared to have been taken before the 1993 blasts after which another don, Chhota Rajan, who is shown in it, parted ways with Dawood. In that case, there is nothing objectionable about it.

 There may also be photos of many political leaders with the don taken at that time but it does not mean they all had links with him. People in politics, social work and arts earn their reputation after putting in years of hard work. Nobody has the right to tarnish it without getting full information.

 Asked why his line contradicted that of the BJP, he said: Vinay Katiyar speaks the truth and only the truth.

 Party sources said his response was linked to heartland politics. Katiyar wants to score a political point over Mulayam Singh Yadav and his aides, a BJP leader said.

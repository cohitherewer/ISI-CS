 Suicide bomber

 Srinagar, Oct. 13 (PTI): In the first incident of its kind since the eruption of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, a woman was blown to pieces when the improvised explosive device she was carrying went off in Pulwama district today.

 The IED exploded in the compound of the house of one Ghulam Mohammad Bhat at Awantipora on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway around 11.30 am, killing the burqa-clad woman instantly, a police spokesman said.

 The main target of the attack seemed to be the national highway which is crowded with relief convoys heading towards quake-hit areas, official sources said.

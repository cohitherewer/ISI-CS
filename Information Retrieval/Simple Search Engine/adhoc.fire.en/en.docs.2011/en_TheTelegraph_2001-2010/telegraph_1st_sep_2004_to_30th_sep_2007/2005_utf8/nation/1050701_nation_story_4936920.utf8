 Samaj fire on Sangh

 Agnivesh: Raising a storm

 New Delhi, June 30: The Arya Samaj, a reformist Hindu sect, is on a collision course with the RSS.

 Swami Agnivesh, a social activist and president of the World Council of Arya Samaj, today alleged that 60 RSS activists yesterday stormed a Samaj camp on Minto Road, near Connaught Place, and beat up assistant secretary Mahendra Shastri and two other members.

 As they were fleeing, the trio called police on a cellphone. But the police, acting on an RSS complaint, arrested Shastri and his two colleagues instead and locked them up in Tihar Jail, Agnivesh claimed.

 Delhi police officers, however, said the dispute was between two groups of Arya Samaj activists. They fell out after the elections. The place is an Arya Samaj temple and a case is going on in the high court. We treated it as a simple dispute between two groups.

 Agnivesh believes the Sangh is jittery about his taking over the reins of the Samaj and accused it of vilifying him. It went to the extent of spreading the canard that the late Pope John Paul II connived with Mrs Sonia Gandhi to put me as the head of the World Council of Arya Samaj. I do not understand their logic, he said. 

 Agnivesh was elected president of the Samaj last September, replacing Dev Rattan Arya, an RSS sympathiser. He has also thrice been elected chairperson of the UN Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery.

 Forces of RSS, inimical to me, have been opposing all my activities and trying to block my ascendance in the Arya Samaj, Agnivesh said.

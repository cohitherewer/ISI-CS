 SC not to extend Netaji panel term

 New Delhi: The tenure of the Justice 

 M.K. Mukherjee Commission, probing the ?disappearance? of 

 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose allegedly after an air crash, 

 might end by May 13 as the Supreme Court has refused to 

 direct the Centre to extend its tenure beyond that date, 

 reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices D.M. Dharmadhikari and G.P. Mathur dismissed a public interest litigation seeking an extension of the tenure.

 Anuj Dhar had petitioned that the Centres decision on not to extend the commissions tenure would impede the efforts to unravel the mystery of Netajis ?disappearance? after the ?alleged air crash?.

 According to official records, Netaji was killed in an air crash on August 18, 1945, in Taiwan. But the commission, after visiting the country, found no official record of any crash in the months of August and September 1945, the petitioners counsel Vijay Hansaria told the court.

 He argued that Taiwans records added a further twist to Netajis disappearance and if the commission was wound up ?abruptly?, the mystery would never be unravelled.

 The bench said the commission, appointed on April 14, 1999, was given a six-month extension last November. 

 Notice on seer case transfer

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has issued 

 a showcause notice to the Tamil Nadu government asking it 

 to reply why the murder case against Kanchi seer Jayendra 

 Saraswati not be transferred outside the state for trial, 

 reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices D.M. Dharmadhikari and G.P. Mathur heared the seers counsel Fali Nariman, who contended that a ?free and fair? trial was not possible in Tamil Nadu as chief minister Jayalalithaa ?has been evincing personal interest? in the case and police were carrying out her orders.

 Notices were also issued to the police, investigating officer Prem Kumar and approver Ravi Subramanian. The matter will be heard in July.

 Nariman contended that the police were preparing a ?mala fide case? against the seer as was evident from the ?statements made by the chief minister, who also holds the home portfolio?.

 The counsel said ?there is a situation prevailing wherein the defence counsel are threatened? and, therefore, the case should be transferred outside Tamil Nadu.

 The Supreme Court has directed the Tamil Nadu government to pay nearly 10,000 sacked workers their wages for two months in addition to the months salary already given to them.

 Coke water rights dispute

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has 

 issued notices to soft drink manufacturer Coca-Cola on a 

 petition by a Kerala village panchayat challenging a Kerala 

 High Court order allowing the companys Plachimada-based 

 bottling unit to draw five lakh litres of ground water per 

 day at Perumatty village in Palakkadu district.

 The Perumatty panchayat contended that it had a right to refuse drawing of such a large quantity of water keeping in view the interests of agriculture and domestic consumers.

 Kapil summons

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court 

 has asked Kapil Dev to appear before it on Monday after 

 he sought de-sealing of his property in south Delhi. The 

 former cricketers counsel contended that he was using 

 his B-41, Greater Kailash Part-I premises as a residence-cum-personal 

 office and not for commercial purposes.

 Teacher posts

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has 

 upheld the constitutional validity of a Uttar Pradesh government 

 decision in 2001 to reserve 50 per cent of primary teachers 

 posts for women. Some unsuccessful candidates had challenged 

 in Allahabad High Court the decision, saying it was not 

 warranted, being over and above the reservation in favour 

 of backward classes.

 Indians elected

 Houston (PTI): R.A. Mashelkar, the 

 director-general of the Council for Scientific and Industrial 

 Research, and economist Avinash Dixit have been elected 

 foreign associates of the Washington-based National Academy

 were among 18 foreign associates inducted for their original 

 research.

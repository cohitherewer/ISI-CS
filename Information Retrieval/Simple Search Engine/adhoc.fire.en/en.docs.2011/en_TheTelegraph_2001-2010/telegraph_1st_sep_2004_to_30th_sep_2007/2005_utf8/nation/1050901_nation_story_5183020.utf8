 Daughters of Faith in liquor war

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Aug. 31: Four autorickshaws come to a halt at the posh Boulevard Road, a high-security area here, late in the evening. Around 15 veiled women get out of the vehicles and hurry towards the Heewan Hotel on the banks of the Dal Lake. 

 Suddenly, they snatch liquor bottles from the counter of the liquor shop inside the hotel and smash them to pieces on the road. They also break the shops windowpanes and damage furniture. The operation is over in less than 15 minutes. The group runs to the autorickshaws that speed away.

 That was another moral policing operation on Tuesday evening by the womens separatist group, Dukhtaran-e-Milat (Daughters of Faith), which has lately begun cracking down on sex workers and is extending its diktat to the liquor shops here.

 The group, headed by Aasiya Andrabi, featured in newspaper headlines when its activists forced beauty parlours to close down and destroyed posters depicting women in what they thought was in bad taste.

 The group also issued a diktat for local women to wear burqas, but it was largely flouted as women in the urbanised areas of Kashmir prefer to go about unveiled.

 In the last two days, the group raided places in the city where it claim flesh trade is on. They also raided cyber cafes and restaurants where boys and girls mix freely. Police, however, say the raids are a criminal offence. It is the job of the police to carry out raids, said a police officer.

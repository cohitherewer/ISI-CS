 Power puzzle

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: Uncertainty about whether the Congress would ask ruling coalition partner Peoples Democratic Party to hand over the reins of Jammu and Kashmir, as agreed three years ago, is set to end tomorrow.

 Sonia Gandhi has invited chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed to Delhi on Sunday to discuss the matter.

 The allies had agreed to split the six-year term with Sayeed getting the first three-year stint, which expires on November 2. But the Congress high command has so far been reluctant to reveal whether it wants to hold its ally to the promise.

 Sonia presumably wants Sayeed to continue ? but is wary of demoralising state unit activists who want a power transfer. As the scheduled date for the handover approached, the Congress hid behind the October 8 earthquake, saying relief efforts and not power was topmost on its mind.

 Sayeed has let the Congress know he wants it to make its position clear. He is not interested in a temporary extension, but wouldnt mind staying on for the full six years.

 The Congress call to Sayeed came amid indications that he might resign to force the party to take a stand, a situation it wants to avert.

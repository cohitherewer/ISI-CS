 Scramble for encephalitis vaccine, 5 years late

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: The health ministry, now scrambling to find vaccines to protect children from Japanese encephalitis in Indias high-risk districts, had rejected several offers of JE vaccines in the past, scientists and government documents have revealed.

 Independent proposals to evaluate an Indian vaccine production technology and import JE vaccines failed to make headway because the government lacked the right machinery to pick or evaluate candidate vaccines, immunisation experts have said.

 An outbreak of JE in Uttar Pradesh this year has killed more than 1,400 children since August and left hundreds with disabilities. Health officials last week signalled their intention to import a single-dose Chinese vaccine to immunise children in 14 high-risk districts in Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal from 2006.

 But government documents show the vaccine that the health ministry wants to import had been rejected by Indian drug regulators two years ago. Two drug companies had sought permission to conduct clinical trials of the Chinese JE vaccine in India.

 Drug regulators had told them that due to technicalities, it is not advisable to conduct clinical trials of the vaccine in India at the time. Sources said the trials were turned down because of lack of safety data on the vaccine then.

 The health ministry had also rejected a JE vaccine technology offered by virologist Sudanshu Vrati at the National Institute of Immunology (NII) in New Delhi five years ago, the sources said.

 Concerned about the spread of JE in India and the deaths of hundreds of children each year, the biotechnology department had in 1996 funded Vratis proposal to develop a technology that could have been exploited to produce an inexpensive candidate vaccine.

 At a meeting five years ago, biotechnology officials had asked the health ministry to evaluate the technology as a source of a candidate vaccine. It would have had to pass trials for safety and efficacy. But nothing emerged from the meeting, a source said.

 An Indian health official said the World Health Organisation has now evaluated the Chinese vaccine. Both WHO and PATH, a US-based non-profit organisation, have assured the Centre it is safe and effective, the official said.

 China has used the vaccine for 18 years and virtually eliminated JE. Its also used in South Korea, the official said.

 But scientists, health experts and industry sources said the Centres decisions reflect Indias traditional unwillingness to take vaccine decisions on its own.

 A government centre in Kasauli has the capacity to make 500,000 JE vaccines each year, far below Indias needs. But production technology at Kasauli is cumbersome and costly as it uses mice brains.

 Earlier this year, a Japanese vaccine maker switched from using mice brains to a technology similar to that of Vratis. Had the NII technology been pursued, we might have had an alternative vaccine much earlier. I think we missed an opportunity, Dr T. Jacob John, former head of virology at the Christian Medical College in Vellore and a member of the governments advisory panel on immunisation, said.

 Industry sources said a thorough evaluation of the Chinese vaccine two years ago could have speeded up its entry into India. 

 The outbreak this year in Uttar Pradesh has been the longest and most severe in decades.

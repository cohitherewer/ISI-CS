 Green alert rings in Lanka on Suez of east

 Colombo, May 30 (Reuters): A shipping canal that India plans to dig off its southern coast could have disastrous consequences for the marine and coastal ecosystems of neighbouring Sri Lanka, environmentalists warned today.

 Dredging in the shallow depths between Indias southern tip and northern Sri Lanka could upset delicate ecosystems in the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve and Palk Bay and spell doom for fishermen from both countries, activists told a seminar held by the Green Movement of Sri Lanka.

 No one in their right mind would dig a canal between India and Sri Lanka... The environmental impact in Sri Lanka has not even been studied, T. Mohan, an Indian environmental lawyer, said on the sidelines of the seminar. 

 We are talking about changes to the ecology ... sedimentation and risks to human lives if cyclones and tsunamis are to occur, he said.

 This month, the Indian cabinet approved a $550-million channel project to make it easier for ships to travel between the east and west coasts of the country. Only small fishing boats can pass through the Palk Strait at present.

 Under the Sethusamudram ship channel project, a channel will be dredged in the shallow portion of the sea off the southern tip of India so that vessels up to 30,000 tonnes, including Indian Navy patrol vessels, will not have to circumnavigate Sri Lanka.

 The Sri Lankan minister for ports and aviation, Mangala Samaraweera, said this month the government was concerned about the Sethusamudram project. The minister, however, did not elaborate.

 The project is unlikely to be popular in Sri Lanka for another reason besides environment concerns. Colombo will lose considerable shipping business because of it.

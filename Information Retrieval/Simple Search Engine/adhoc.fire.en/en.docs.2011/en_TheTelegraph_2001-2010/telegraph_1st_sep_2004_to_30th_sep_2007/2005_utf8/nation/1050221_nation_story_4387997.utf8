 Poll path to democracy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 20: The man of justice is set to turn a new leaf in his fight for democracy.

 Advocate Vasant Choudhary?s passion for the rule of law made him take on Bihar strongmen Mohammad Shahabuddin and Laloo Prasad Yadav. Now, he has decided to enter the poll fray as a candidate from the Patna West constituency.

 Choudhary is one of the four candidates fielded by Lok Morcha, the political outfit launched by him recently, to defeat the ?corrupt, casteist, criminal and communal forces? of Bihar.

 Actor Kunika Sadanand was here earlier this week to campaign for Choudhary. ?I am here to support you in your struggle for a crime and corruption-free polity. Prepare yourself to throw out the present corrupt regime, which thrives on criminals,? she told a crowd at Chitkora market.

 ?Kunika is not a glamorous filmstar like Hema Malini. She is a human rights activist and a comrade who is supporting us in our struggle,? says Choudhary.

 The other Lok Morcha candidates are Vidya Devi from Raghopur, chief minister Rabri Devi?s constituency, Sudhakar Das from Bodh Gaya and Vijay Kumar from Bihpur.

 Choudhary, a former CPI(ML) activist, took on Shahabuddin in 1997 when he argued in favour of a petition against the sultan of Siwan. Shahabuddin, facing over 30 criminal cases then, was arrested for the first time that year. Before that, he had argued for a petition by Sushil Kumar Modi against then chief minister Laloo Prasad in the fodder scam.

 During the last Lok Sabha elections, the lawyer initiated a movement called Jan Chowkidar to reflect upon and articulate ?an alternative value-based political ideology by concerned citizens?. The experiment led to the formation of the Lok Morcha.

 According to the party guidelines, ?Lok Morcha is a forum for honest and sincere citizens to participate in politics and usher in a truly secular society, which is free from fear and crime?.

 ?We may not win...but we want to launch a new movement that will usher in a democratic society,? says Arun Das, campaign in-charge.

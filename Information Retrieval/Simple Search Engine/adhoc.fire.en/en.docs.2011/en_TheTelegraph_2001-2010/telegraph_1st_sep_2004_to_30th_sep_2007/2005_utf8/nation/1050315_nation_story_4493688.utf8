 Panther sights on Cat terrain

 Black Cat commandos: Days numbered?

 New Delhi, March 14: Move over Black Cats, make space for the Panthers.

 The Central Industrial Security Force will tomorrow showcase its VIP security commandos before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and ask the government to begin deploying them on VIP security duty. Singh will be the chief guest at the CISF Raising Day parade tomorrow.

 The CISF intends to call the commandos Panthers but a decision is yet to be taken. An official said a counter-proposal to name them Black Panthers had held up the decision.

 Nearly 100 commandos of the CISF have been inducted to provide proximate protection to nine persons, including Goa governor S.C. Jamir, but the CISF is waiting for the nod from North Block to enter the VIP security business in a big way.

 The CISF already has about 500 trained commandos waiting for orders to take over security of VIPs and a proposal to recruit another 2,100 is before home minister Shivraj Patil. 

 A nod from the minister would clear the CISF?s plan to take over security of nearly 200 ?protected persons?, many of them expected to be members of Parliament and chief ministers.

 Sources said the home ministry did not have any objection to the CISF taking over VIP security duty but concede that there were some reservations in North Block due to two incidents involving CISF personnel ? in Mumbai where a constable held his colleagues hostage and in Nepal where a CISF constable went berserk and killed his colleague. ?These were individual aberrations but they do dent the organisation?s image,? a senior official said.

 Given the reservations, officials suggest the process of the Panthers replacing the Black Cats from the National Security Guard might be rather gradual. Besides the 500 trained men, officials said it would take the force nearly a year to commission the additional 2,000-plus personnel for VIP duty.

 CISF director-general K.M. Singh said the force would not need to recruit any more personnel except for VIP security duty despite an expansion in job description of the CISF. 

 The civil aviation ministry has asked the CISF to take over security at five airports in the Northeast including those at Tezpur, Jorhat and Lilabari. The initial survey to determine the deployment of security personnel has been completed, an official said.

 The CISF has already been entrusted with responsibility of managing security at 47 airports.

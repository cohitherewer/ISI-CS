The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Goa trust vote today 

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Goa governor has asked chief minister Manohar Parrikar to prove his majority in the Assembly in a move that has displeased the Congress leadership.

 Congress leaders at the AICC headquarters here said the government should have been sacked since its loss of majority was an established fact.

 The BJP-led ruling combine, they said, had lost the support of four MLAs, taking its strength in the effectively 36-member House to below the halfway mark at 17.

 Governor S.C. Jamir, however, has directed the chief minister to seek a confidence vote tomorrow instead of Thursday as Parrikar had sought.

 The Congress leaders feared Parrikar could use the opportunity to muster majority by ?unfair? means even as AICC general secretary Margaret Alva prepared to leave for Panaji.

 Under the circumstances, the governor should have avoided the trial of strength to sort out the political crisis in the state, they said.

 Asked whether the governor was not following the supreme courts order in the S R Bommai case, they said there was no single approach to address the situation.

 ?Floor test is not the only model for deciding the case. The governor has to take a comprehensive view of the political situation,? asserted party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi. 

 Anticipating a sack order from the governor, the Congress and its supporting legislators had already elected former chief minister Pratapsinh Rane as their combined legislature party leader last weekend. Party leaders felt that inaction on the part of the governor had caused state tourism minister Matanhy Saldana to reaffirm loyalty to the chief minister within two days of withdrawing his support to the government. 

 An unhappy state Congress president Luisinho Falerio led a party delegation to the governor in the state capital today to reiterate their demand for sacking the government. But a few hours after the delegations meeting, Jameer directed the chief minister to take a confidence vote in the House tomorrow. 

 However, the party leadership continued to be confident about voting out the BJP-led state government which has been in office now for more than two and half years. ?The BJP wont be able to muster more than 17 votes in the assembly and we are confident that our 18 votes will remain with us in tomorrows trial of strength,? a party functionary said. Since the speaker cannot exercise his casting vote unless there is a tie, the leader asserted that the Parrikar government would be out of office by Wednesday evening.

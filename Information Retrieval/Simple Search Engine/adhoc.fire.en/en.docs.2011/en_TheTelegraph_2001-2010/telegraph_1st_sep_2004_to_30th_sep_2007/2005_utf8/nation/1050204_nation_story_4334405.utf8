 Bhubaneswar, Feb 3: Union information technology (IT) minister Dayanidhi Maran today said governments should have the minimum capability for the national e-governance programme to take concrete shape.

 ?The national programme is too complex and ambitious in its present scope to be achieved without such an approach,? Maran said after inaugurating the three-day eighth national e-governance conference here this morning. 

 The Centre has drawn up a national e-governance action plan covering all three tiers of the government, with the objective of ?turning the power of Indian information technology inwards? and transforming the country into one of the most competitive nations globally.

 ?The most important attribute of this plan is its singular focus on citizens,? Maran said. 

 The plan envisages access by all citizens to government and private services from their own villages or towns, apart from giving access to economic opportunities, both within the country and outside, he said.

 Shedding light on the goals, Maran said, ?The first is the goal of improving governance as indicated in the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance. The second is the effort to reach the benefits of information and communication technologies (ICT)s to the entire society, particularly to the remote regions and disadvantaged sections.? 

 Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik and state minister for IT and tourism Suryo Narayan Patro were present in the conference.

 Patro said the government has formulated an ICT policy for the state and was determined to use it for better governance. ?We have tied up with Hyderabad-based National Institute of Smart Government for creating an e-government roadmap for the state,? he said. 

 The roadmap comprises a vision, strategy, blueprint, programme and ecosystem, Patro added.

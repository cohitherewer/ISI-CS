 Naga violence erupts in Manipur 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, July 9: Manipurs hill districts of Ukhrul, Tamenglong, Senapati and Chandel exploded today, reeling under widespread arson and violence by Naga residents.

 The hill districts are dominated by Nagas, who erupted in outrage after a supporter of the economic blockade, in force since June, was shot at and another assaulted by securitymen last night.

 The blockade, sponsored by the All Naga Students Association of Manipur (Ansam), is along the two national highways. The organisation wants a government holiday declared on June 18 as state integrity day withdrawn.

 Last nights incident sparked violent protests this morning. Mobs went on the rampage, setting ablaze several offices in Senapati, Chandel, Tamenglong and Ukhrul districts. 

 Securitymen of the India Reserve Battalion (IRB), attached to Senapati district police, shot at and injured a blockade supporter, identified as Stephen, and assaulted another with a rifle butt around 9.30 last night at the district headquarters. The injured persons were taken to a Kohima hospital. 

 A public meeting held at the district headquarters demanded a trial of the two IRB personnel involved in the firing in accordance with customary tribal laws. 

 The United Naga Council, the apex body of the community, called on all Naga brothers across Nagalim to come together and rescue us.

 Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh said the two securitymen were drunk and the incident was the result of an argument between the duo and the Naga activists. The government would take all care of the two injured persons, he added. 

 The two IRB personnel have been suspended and put behind bars. Ibobi Singh also said the IRB would be withdrawn from the district headquarters, as demanded by the Nagas. The Manipur Rifles would replace the force. 

 Ibobi Singh today held discussions with his ministerial colleagues as well as Naga leader and MP from the state, Rishang Keishing. He hinted that the government might review the decision to declare June 18 a holiday next year. 

 He described the situation in the four hill districts as tense and requested the central forces deployed there to be on maximum alert.

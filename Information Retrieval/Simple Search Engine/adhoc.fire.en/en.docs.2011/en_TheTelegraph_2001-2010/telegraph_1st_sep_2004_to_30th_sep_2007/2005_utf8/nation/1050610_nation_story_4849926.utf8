The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sahara boss on TV

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 9: Subrata Roy, the head of the Rs 40,000-crore Sahara Group, will appear on television tomorrow, his 58th birthday, to say he is absolutely disease-free.

 A spokesperson said Sahara officials will show video clips on the groups television channel where Roy would deny reports of political interference and accuse nasty-minded people of trying to create turmoil amongst millions of people with rumours of his ill-health.

 Roy, whose disappearance from public view for three months spawned a court case charging that his wife was holding him prisoner, will use the occasion to assure investors. He would explain that work had on occasion kept him away from sleep for 72 hours at a stretch, resulting in blood pressure surges. This, and a weight problem, had forced him to adopt a regimented lifestyle.

 My priority at present is to make myself more fit through natural means so that I am able to contribute productively with more and more youthful energies in the development of our organisation and the country for another 20-25 years.

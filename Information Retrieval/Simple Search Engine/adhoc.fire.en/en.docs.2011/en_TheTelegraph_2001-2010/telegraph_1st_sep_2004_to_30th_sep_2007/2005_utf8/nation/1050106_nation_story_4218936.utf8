 Teacher in girl ?snatch?

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Jan. 5: Nothing is bizarre in Bihar. Even university professors can turn abductors ? although not exactly for ransom.

 Patna University students today took to the streets in protest against the alleged kidnapping of an undergraduate student of physics department of a college by a professor of the department, reportedly to get her forcibly married to his son.

 Vice-chancellor Jagannath Thakur assured the students of immediate action. The girl, Madhu Priya, was missing since December 24 and her mother Shobha Mishra said she had received a call from the professor?s son that her daughter was with him.

 On December 4, during a physics class, a youth, Avishkar, son of B.N. College physics teacher Ramjivan Bhatt, asked her to come out. But Numan Shahab, who was taking the class, did not listen to Avishkar.

 Soon, the youth?s father (Bhatt) came to the classroom and requested the teacher to let the girl go with him. 

 Shahab allowed the girl, a student of B.Sc third year, to go because the request had come from a teacher of his own department. 

 The girl?s mother later alleged in an FIR that Bhatt took her daughter to his room in his college where his son was also present. 

 The professor told Madhu Priya that she should marry his son. But when she refused, she was threatened, she said. The FIR was lodged at Pirbahore police station, close to the college, but police failed to act on the complaint.

 ?Things were all right for a few days, but on December 24, my daughter, who had gone out to the market, did not return home till the evening. Around 7 pm, I received a call from Avishkar, who said Madhu Priya was with him. I lodged another FIR, this time with the Phulwari Sharif police station under which my residence falls,? Mishra said.

 On December 4 itself, Shahab had written to the college principal S.P. Sinha giving details about the incident in his classroom. 

 Attempts to contact Bhatt or his son failed, as they could not be located.

 Murder rap on acharyas

 M.R. VENKATESH

Kancheepuram, Jan. 21: Kanchi Mutt pontiff Jayendra Saraswati and his junior Vijayendra Saraswati were charged with murder and criminal conspiracy today, nearly four months after the special investigation team began probing the brutal killing of a dissenting temple manager.

 The 1,873-page chargesheet, filed in the court of first judicial magistrate G. Uthamaraj, named the acharyas as the top two accused in the case. If convicted, they can be punished with sentences ranging from jail for three years to capital punishment.

 Twenty-four people in all have been named as accused in the chargesheet, which includes 38 letters of Shankar Raman, who was murdered on the premises of the Sri Varadaraja Perumal temple here in September. Except for Jayendra Saraswati, who was granted bail, all the others are in custody.

 Chennai-based builder Ravi Subramaniam, who was being cited as the second accused in the case, has been absolved of all charges after he turned approver yesterday.

 The chargesheet, filed on a public holiday, capped a dramatic morning that saw police officials place the sealed document before the presiding deity of the Varadaraja Perumal temple. Kancheepuram superintendent of police K. Prem Kumar and the chief investigating officer of the case, Sakthivel, prayed for about half an hour before they reached the court a little after 12.30.

 ?This happened inside the temple and Varadaraja Perumal (the presiding deity) is the witness. It is now Varadaraja Perumal versus the acharya and I am only an instrument,? Prem Kumar said. 

 The other accused include Vijayendra Saraswati?s brother Raghu, N. Sundaresa Iyer, the mutt?s manager, Appu alias Krishnaswamy Reddy, the alleged kingpin of the killer gang, the six who allegedly organised ?proxy surrenders? to throw investigators off the trail and the five who played the ?fake accused?.

 The exact charges against each of the accused will be known when they are handed copies of the chargesheet. But the pontiffs have been charged under sections 302 (murder), 34 (common intention), 120-b (criminal conspiracy) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence or giving false information to shield the offender).

 Prem Kumar said Ravi ?will be the prosecution witness No. 1?. Police sources said his confessional statement led to the ?discovery? of Vijayendra Saraswati?s role in the murder. They said Ravi also revealed that the senior pontiff consulted him ?on how to end the menace posed by Shankar Raman?, and how the mutt?s money changed hands through him to the killers. 

 A. Shanmugam, the counsel for the seers, however, said Ravi?s confessions would not affect the case. 

 Asked if the case will be tried in a ?fast-track court?, Prem Kumar said it will be conducted in a ?regular court?, indicating a softening of stance on the part of the Jayalalithaa regime towards the pontiffs though it is resolutely pursuing the case.

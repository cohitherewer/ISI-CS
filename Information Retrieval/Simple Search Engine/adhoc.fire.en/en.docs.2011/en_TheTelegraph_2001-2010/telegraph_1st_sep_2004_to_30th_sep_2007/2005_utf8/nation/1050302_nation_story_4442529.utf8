 Dalai to stay off match also

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 The Dalai Lama: Rare miss

 Shimla, March 1: The Dalai Lama will not only skip the inauguration of the three-day match between Pakistan and the Indian board XI in Dharamsala on Thursday but will also not watch it from the VIP gallery.

 ?The programme of His Holiness has been cancelled due to the controversy triggered by the Pakistan Cricket Board. The Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association had reduced his programme to lighting of the lamp and to watch the match,? Sonam N. Dangpo, a spokesperson of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), said. 

 Earlier, on the request of the state cricket body, the Dalai Lama had agreed to inaugurate the match. 

 But matters came to the fore following media reports that the Pakistan board had reservations over the Tibetan leader inaugurating the tour opener against the Board President?s XI as the country enjoys good ties with China. 

 Board director Abbas Zaidi was quoted as saying in a Pakistani newspaper that the team ?will not take part in any social activity, even those involving the lama? during its stay in India.

 The development has worried the state and central governments. No function in Dharamsala ? the Dalai Lama?s capital-in-exile ? is complete without his presence. Thursday will be the first instance when he will not be present at a programme of national and international importance.

 According to CTA sources, foreign secretary Shyam Saran met the Dalai Lama yesterday. Thubten Samphel, another spokesperson, however, refused to confirm the meeting. ?I am not aware about the visit of the Indian foreign secretary,? Samphel said.

 But the Prime Minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, Samdhong Rinpoche, said Saran had called on the spiritual leader. ?The Dalai Lama had no plans of visiting Delhi in the near future; Shyam Saran took the trouble of coming here. It is just a courtesy call and there is no specific agenda,? Rinpoche said.

 The sources, however, said Saran was here on an official visit to brief the Dalai Lama. ?The visit may be about the cricket controversy besides routine affairs. It is the first ever visit of Shyam Saran since he took over as foreign secretary,? a source said.

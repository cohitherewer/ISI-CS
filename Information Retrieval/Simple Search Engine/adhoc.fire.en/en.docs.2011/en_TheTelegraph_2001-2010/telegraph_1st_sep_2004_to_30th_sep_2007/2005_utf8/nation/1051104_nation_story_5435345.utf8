 Left unity call in Delhi, 

rift in Bihar

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Patna, Nov. 3: Prakash Karats call to the Left and democratic forces to unite and pose a real alternative to the bourgeois-landlord set-up (read the Congress-led government at the Centre) has an inverse logic at the ground level.

 The CPM here sides with the set-up to defeat the CPI.

 In the Barauni Assembly segment, for instance, the CPI would have been in a comfortable position had the CPM not chosen to upset its plans.

 The seat was won by Rajendra Prasad Singh of the CPI last time. He defeated his nearest rival, Dinesh Prasad Singh of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), by a margin of 4,919 votes in the February polls.

 The CPM, allying with the Congress and the RJD, has fielded a candidate here this time. The CPI thus may find the going tough as its Left rival is bound to cut into its traditional vote base.

 Similarly, in Begusarai, the CPIs Kamli Mahato would have undoubtedly clinched the seat if the CPM had not fielded its candidate there. Mahato polled 28,182 votes last time, leaving the CPMs Rajendra Prasad Singh with only 12,888 votes. 

 The winner was the BJP, the communal force that both the parties have vowed to wipe out from Bihar. The combined Left votes had out-totalled the winners figure. The CPM is responsible for the BJPs victory here, said Babban Rai, a CPI worker.

 Bitterness between the two parties at the local level is comparable only to the Lefts pathological hatred for the BJP. 

 We would have easily won if the CPM had not decided to contest. This is a confirmed CPI seat. We are not their ideological rivals. Why should they work to ruin us? said another CPI worker.

 The Left leadership in Delhi is guarded when asked about the schism. I have nothing to add to your analysis, said CPI secretary A.B. Bardhan. The only thing is that both these are traditional CPI strongholds. 

 The CPM, though, is a bit more caustic. Voters are nobodys bonded labourers, said central committee member Nilotpal Basu. Why should we not contest seats where we stand a chance?

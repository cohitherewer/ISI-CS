The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 DD cricket share outcry

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, Oct. 22: Private TV channels are crying foul after their united campaign failed to hit home.

 On Thursday, the Union cabinet made it mandatory for sports channels and management companies to share with Doordarshan the live telecast rights of all cricket matches featuring India.

 Its an extremely negative development not only for broadcaster interest in the game but also for the development of sports, said R.C. Venkateish, managing director of ESPN Software India.

 Only two other countries, the UK and Australia, have legislation for sports. But there, too, its merely the first right of refusal within a stipulated time that is offered.

 ESPN STAR Sports has just acquired exclusive rights for the Asia Cup, featuring India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Pakistan next year, which it will now have to share.

 Parliament has to clear the proposal before a notification is issued. But that, feel the players, is only a formality.

 Why not apply the same rules in other sectors, too? asked a Ten Sports official. Its not as if the ministry is not fully aware of the repercussions.

 Ten, ESPN, Sony and Zee had met I amp;B minister Jaipal Reddy several times on the issue in the past few months.

 But Zee, whose rift with ESPN STAR Sports on BCCI cricket rights has widened, has a different view. We welcome the move and see no reason why it should harm the fortunes of sports broadcasters, said Ashish Kaul, VP, corporate brand development, Essel Group. Besides, all matches featuring India have always been shared with Doordarshan.

 The biggest gainer ? Doordarshan ? echoed this. 

 But the private channels are waiting for the notification before planning their next step. Legal recourse cannot be ruled out, said Venkateish.

 Overseas rights

 Singapore-based Nimbus Sport International has bagged overseas media rights for the 12 one-day internationals to be played between India and Sri Lanka and India and South Africa.

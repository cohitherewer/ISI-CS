 Domicile judge controversy reaches Centre 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Patna, July 11: Nobody domiciled in one state can be appointed the chief justice in the same state. That is the law and state policy.

 But since the policy is silent about the acting chief justice, the Union government appears to have taken advantage of the lacunae in allowing Justice Nagendra Rai, domiciled in Bihar, to continue as the acting chief justice since July 22 last year.

 Ironically, the same Union law ministry had blocked last year the posting of Justice B.K. Rai as the chief justice of Patna High Court on the ground that he hailed from Bihar. It would have been a breach of state policy against having the chief justice from the same state. 

 A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court today sought the Centres views on a public interest litigation challenging Justice Rais continuance. 

 The bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti, Justice C.K. Thakker and P.K. Balasubramanyan posted the next hearing for July 18 and sought the presence of the attorney-general or the solicitor-general on the day of the hearing.

 Prashant Bhushan, arguing for petitioner Basant Choudhary, argued that the Supreme Court in the S.P. Gupta vs Union of India case had clearly held that the policy of having chief justices in every high court from outside the state is constitutionally valid, good, reasonable and also in public interest.

 Petitioner Choudhary said in Patna: The law does not allow an acting chief justice to continue for more than a month. 

 Quoting his lawyer, Choudhary claimed that the apex court had asked the attorney-general of India to submit all files related to the appointment of the acting chief justice Rai and all details of the action taken by the government for the appointment of a permanent chief justice.

 The President, recalled Choudhary, who is a senior high court lawyer, had signed and cleared the appointment of B.K. Rai, the then Punjab and Haryana chief justice, to the same post in Patna high court. But the law ministry had refused to comply on the ground that the chief justice of the high court could not be from the home state.

 A former president of the Patna high court bar association, Choudhary said it is unprecedented for an acting chief justice to continue in office for a whole year. 

 The Supreme Court, he pointed out, had given directives to the government to fill up the post expeditiously. But the ministry can best explain why it sat over the recommendation for eight months, he said.

 He has been given to understand, said Choudhary, that the ministry had been pressured to sit over the recommendation by an influential central minister from Bihar. What can be the reason behind this, I cannot understand, he added.

 Sources in Patna High Court claimed that the Supreme Court collegium had recommended the name of a senior judge from Gujarat High Court for the post in Patna. No confirmation is, however, available from the union law ministry.

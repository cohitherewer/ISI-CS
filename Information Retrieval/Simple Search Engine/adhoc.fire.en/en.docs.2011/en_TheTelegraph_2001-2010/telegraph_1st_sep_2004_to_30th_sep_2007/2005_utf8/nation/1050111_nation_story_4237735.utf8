 Bardhan plays peace maker

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: A call from CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan to Sonia Gandhi on Saturday brought the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Left back to the negotiating table yesterday.

 It is still early days to hope for a clinching seat-sharing arrangement for the Bihar and Jharkhand polls. But the initial belligerence that marked the talks seems to be lessening and Bardhan is playing a key role.

 In the last Bihar Assembly elections, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav refused to accommodate the CPI in a seat-sharing adjustment and had a pact with the CPM alone. The CPI went it alone.

 The political mood is changing this time. On Friday, the Congress and the JMM announced a seat-sharing arrangement for the Jharkhand polls without taking allies RJD and the Left into confidence.

 Laloo Prasad seethed, as did the CPI. The next day, Bardhan rang up the Congress chief and complained on behalf of not just his own party but the RJD as well. Sonia told him that the negotiations have been left to senior leaders like Arjun Singh and M.L. Fotedar.

 The CPI general secretary alleged that the Congress was taking its allies for granted. Sonia assured him that she would ask Singh and Fotedar to talk to the RJD and the Left.

 Although no formula is yet in sight, yesterday?s talks have succeeded in cooling tempers. ?This is just a beginning. There will be many more rounds of talks before something is thrashed out,? said Bardhan.

 Usually, it is CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet who plays a trouble-shooter and a peace maker in such situations. But his failing health is barring him from being an active mediator this time.

 Laloo Prasad is usually partial towards the CPM though the CPI has a wider support base in Bihar and Jharkhand. But the CPI believes that its equations with the RJD are charging as not only the CPM and the CPI play crucial role in keeping the UPA government in place, Sonia is also known for seeking Bardhan?s advice at critical political junctures.

 The CPI wants to contest 20 seats and the CPM 10.

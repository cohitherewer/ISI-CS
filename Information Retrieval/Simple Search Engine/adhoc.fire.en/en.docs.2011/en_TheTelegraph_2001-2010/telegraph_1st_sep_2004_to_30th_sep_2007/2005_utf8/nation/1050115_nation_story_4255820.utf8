 Exam reform on the table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The National Council of Educational Research and Training has re-opened the discussion on examination reforms in order to lessen the pressure on students.

 The national focus group on examination reforms held its first meeting today. The experts attending the meeting believe that evaluation in the coming days is going to become tougher with new subjects like art education, environment, heritage crafts and disaster management being added to the curriculum.

 The discussion on examination reforms goes back more than a decade. Academics and education experts have been advocating a system of evaluation that would be continuous. This would mean following a grade system of evaluation that would dispense with the present system of marks.

 According to experts, a student ideally should be evaluated throughout the year so that they are not under too much pressure for a final examination. But those who advise caution about the grade system say teachers have to be ?good? in order to assess a student not on the basis of marks but on the overall performance throughout the year. This, the experts maintain, is ?easier said than done?, particularly when the standard of teachers leaves much to be desired.

 The member secretary of the national focus group, Avtar Singh, set the tenor of today?s discussion, saying the present system makes the students exam-oriented. This encourages learning by rote rather than comprehending or improving the quality of learning. 

 The NCERT said the present education system does not offer enough opportunities of learning to the students and ?yet it examines the students?.

 The Central Board of Secondary Education is also examining the issue. CBSE chairperson Ashok Ganguly has said the board is seriously considering doing away with the present system of marks. A committee is looking at the different options.

 The national focus group will deliberate tomorrow and the day after on how best exam reforms can be worked out. The NCERT said the group would discuss ground realities and existing practices reflecting strengths and weaknesses across different stages, keeping rural and urban background in mind. The group consists of NCERT faculty members, schoolteachers, educationists and academic experts.

 It will, however, be a long time before the experts are able to thrash out an exam policy that will do away with the present system of marks but at the same time do justice to both the student and the teacher.

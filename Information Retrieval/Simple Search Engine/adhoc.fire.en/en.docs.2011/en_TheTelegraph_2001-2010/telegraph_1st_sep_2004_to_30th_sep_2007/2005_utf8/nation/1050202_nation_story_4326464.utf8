 Tis Hazari attack protest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: Women activists have protested the attack on a rape victim and her mother by two accused outside the Tis Hazari courts here yesterday in an instance of security lapse by the police.

 The incident happened less than a month after Delhi police?s efforts at protecting a gangraped student of the Maulana Azad Medical College while deposing against the accused rendered her speedy justice.

 ?It was shocking. Why wasn?t some action taken immediately against the police personnel?? asked Brinda Karat of the All India Democratic Women?s Association.

 Police were escorting the accused from the court of additional sessions judge Swaran Kanta when one of them, Kaptan, socked the 22-year-old victim on the chin while co-accused Ravikant hit her mother on the head. The women had just deposed in court.

 ?The victims and the accused should have been produced in court immediately after the incident so that a fresh charge of assault could be made,? Karat said and demanded more security outside Tis Hazari.

 ?There is no existing measure to protect a victim who wants to depose,? said Jyotsna Chatterjee of Joint Women?s Programme.

 The judge summoned a senior police officer tomorrow with directions to ensure security for rape victims.

 The judge ordered an FIR to be recorded and summoned a senior police officer tomorrow with directions to ensure adequate security for rape victims.

 In Haryana, voting comes with husband

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Kaithal, Feb. 2: Turning 18 is not the passport to the polling booth for women in Haryana. A marriage certificate is.

 ?Streeyon se kehta Haryana rajniti mein na jaana (Haryana tells women not to enter politics). Only men are capable of going into politics and deciding who should represent them. The lot of women is in the house, in raising children, tending to crops and cattle and looking after the needs of their husbands. There is nothing else for them,? declares Ram Majra in Raigarh, in between long puffs from his hookah.

 Women, who form 45 per cent of the electorate, do go out to vote. But only for the candidate chosen by their husbands. 

 ?Our husbands? choice is our only choice. We can never vote against their wishes. Since we cannot read or write, we are made to memorise a symbol. Panchayat Haryana mein humko poochhe kaun (Who cares about our views)?? ask Omi Devi and her mother Shanti Devi, bathing cows in a pond at Kendela in the Jat heartland.

 From Ambala to Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Jind and Hissar, the story is the same. The women know what they want: employment for their children, quality power supply, easy availability of drinking water and ?to keep our children away from crime?. But if they have a choice of candidate or party, they cannot spell it out.

 In many villages, unmarried girls over 18 ? the age at which Indians, men and women, are eligible to vote ? are discouraged from registering their names in electoral rolls. They are told they can vote only after marriage, according to the whims and fancies of their husbands.

 It is no surprise then that Haryana hardly has any women legislators. Of the 297 women contestants since 1967, only 47 have won. Even they have mostly been relegated to either being members of their parties? shouting brigades or mute spectators. Many do not utter even a word in the Assembly during their entire tenure. Some whisper that they are asked to remain quiet by their party chiefs.

 Only during the prohibition campaign in 1995-96 did women come out in large numbers to demand complete prohibition. As many as 93 women were fielded by various parties in the Assembly election that followed, the highest number yet. 

 But only five won in a House of 90. This year, 60 are in the fray.

 While all parties pay lip service to women in a state that has a dismal sex ratio ? at 820 girls to 1000 boys, it is much lower than the national average of 927 ? the Indian National Lok Dal has given tickets to just nine women, the Congress to 10, the BJP to 8, and BSP to one. 

 ?We can deal with problems honestly and can never forget our responsibilities even in adverse circumstances. Only a woman could renounce the prime ministership of the country. It is a sad reflection on our society that we are relegated to a level worse than animals. We have no say,? laments Meena, in Jind.

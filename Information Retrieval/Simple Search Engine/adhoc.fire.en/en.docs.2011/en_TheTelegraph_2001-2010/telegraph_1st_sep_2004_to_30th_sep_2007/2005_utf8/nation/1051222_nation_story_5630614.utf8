 Four teens found guilty in MIT grad gangrape

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, Dec. 21: The four teenagers, one of them barely 14, had crept up on her as she sat on the riverbank watching the sunset.

 Then they raped her, one after the other.

 That was August 16, 2003. The young NRI graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology had arrived hours earlier from Calcutta.

 The 27-year-old American citizen today won her first battle against her teenaged violators when a Ghatshila court found them guilty of raping the young woman. Additional sessions judge A.K. Dutta will pronounce the sentence on December 24.

 We worked hard to gather all the evidences so that we could substantiate that the four teenagers were guilty, public prosecutor Dalu Mandal said.

 Legal experts expect a minimum punishment of 10 years in jail but said there have been instances when people accused of gangrape have been sentenced for life.

 Defence counsel Anirban Sarkar said he would challenge the ruling. We shall move a higher court after obtaining a copy of the verdict, he added.

 During investigations, police found the four sailed across the Subarnarekha, then walked up to the woman as she sat alone on a rock and assaulted her before fleeing. The four ? Bipin Dhiwar, Kudal Dhiwar, Sukdev Dhiwar and Vijay Dhiwar, all from a hamlet under Musaboni police station ? were arrested and pointed out during an identification parade a few days later.

 Altogether 15 witnesses, including the victim, some employees of the hotel where she stayed, the doctor at MGM Hospital where she was rushed, and the owner of the telephone booth from where she dialled her friends in Calcutta, deposed before the court.

 The victim ? a research scholar who was in Calcutta for her work on womens issues ? later wrote a first person account of her ordeal in this newspaper.

 The rape put a question mark on the security of tourists in Ghatshila, one of Jharkhands most scenic spots.

 The assault was the third incident of its kind involving a tourist here. In 2001, a non-resident Indian girl escaped a rape attempt in a hotel. Although the girl did not lodge a complaint, police sources confirmed the incident.

 In another case, a tourist from Calcutta was molested at the Burudih dam site in 2002. That incident, too, went unreported.

 Despite what she had gone through, the MIT graduate had been sympathetic towards her violators. So was a relative who accompanied her to hospital.

 They are barely teenagers. We are not vindictive towards them. It is society which is to be blamed for having nurtured such children, the relative had said.

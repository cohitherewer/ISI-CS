 Shuffle talk before US trip

 - Three principles to guide Prime Minister in team revamp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to shuffle his ministry before leaving for the US on July 16.

 Sources said three principles would guide Singh ? fill vacancies, give representation to states that have not got any and induct new talent and rectify some imbalances.

 The council of ministers has 66 members and another 14 can be taken in.

 Singh is likely to take away one portfolio each from those who hold two big ministries such as commerce and industry (Kamal Nath), petroleum and panchayati raj (Mani Shankar Aiyar) and information and broadcasting and culture (Jaipal Reddy) to make space for new entrants.

 While nine berths are available to the Congress based on its strength, sources said the party may keep four or five vacancies to accommodate leaders who will later betaken out of the All India Congress Committee.

 Three vacancies ? sports and youth affairs (caused by the death of Sunil Dutt), coal (caused by the resignation of JMM leader Shibu Soren) and chemicals and fertilisers (caused by the resignation of minister of state Rehman Khan after he was elected deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha) ? will be filled.

 While Soren is set to return to the cabinet, Suresh Kalmadi is likely to get sports and youth affairs ? as Dutt, he is from Maharashtra and is also chairman of the organising committee of the Commonwealth Games and other sports bodies.

 Among the states unrepresented in the council of ministers are Kerala, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Chhattisgarh and Punjab.

 From Kerala, Rajya Sabha MP Vayalar Ravi is the likely choice rather than former chief minister A.K. Antony. With a Christian (Oomen Chandy) in the chief ministers chair, the Congress does not want another member of the community from a state that is going to polls next year in the cabinet.

 Another poll-bound state, Tamil Nadu, could see G.K. Vasan, son of the late G.K. Moopanar, occupy the post of minister of state. 

 Congress spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma may be inducted from Himachal Pradesh. High-profile Congress general secretary Ambika Sonis name is also doing the rounds, as are those of Gandhi-Nehru family loyalists R.K. Dhawan and former petroleum minister Satish Sharma.

 The sources ruled out the entry of Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose name had come up for a time, as Madhya Pradesh is over-represented with six ministers out of only nine MPs.

 Singh may induct at least one new face from Andhra Pradesh to rectify regional imbalance, the sources added. The state that gave 37 MPs to the Congress have only five ministers.

 After Bihar, Bengal

 POORNIMA JOSHI 

 Nitish

 Patna, Oct. 28: With the Election Commission ensuring the fairest polls ever in his home state, Nitish Kumar seems no longer worried about Bihar.

 Its Bengal he is concerned about.

 The National Democratic Alliances candidate for chief minister is anxious to know how the Left Front plans to tackle the poll panel during next years Assembly elections. What creative strategy does the CPM have up its sleeve to protect its bastion from the commissions aggressive election management?

 One already hears complaints about the EC from their alliance partner (Laloo Prasad Yadav). I personally think this is the fairest election ever held anywhere in the country, the Janata Dal (United) leader said.

 There was sophisticated software to check bogus voting. Enough paramilitary forces were present to prevent booth-capturing. The RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) is feeling the heat. But the thing I am really curious to find out is what the Left has planned for the elections in Bengal.

 The Election Commission has monitored the polls with unprecedented strictness. In all, 567 companies from the paramilitary forces were deployed in addition to 40 companies of Bihar military police, about 30,000 district armed police and 9,000 home guards. Four helicopters kept watch from the sky. Face recognition software struck terror into would-be bogus voters.

 The software they are using is almost faultless, Nitish preened. All this doesnt look good for the Left. They should worry about Bengal.

 The CPM has already described the Election Commissions handling of the Bihar polls as extra-constitutional, objecting to the way its observers were meddling in the deployment of security forces. Party general secretary Prakash Karat has publicly attacked the panels methods.

 The battle could get hotter with the commission having recently written to the Bengal government enquiring about certain minority-dominated districts, such as Murshidabad, that recorded very high turnouts in earlier polls. In some instances, the poll percentage was nearly 100 per cent.

 Nitish seemed eager to rub it in. He declared he was full of admiration for the Lefts management of polls.

 The Left is very sophisticated. You cant accuse them of crude practices like booth-capturing. That can be left to their alliance partners. What they do is very intelligent handling of electoral rolls? (making) slight modifications, he said. Its all done very systematically. They are intelligent. But the EC is demonstrating extraordinary skills, too.

 Funds hole in heritage shield

 A replica of Tagores medal

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: The Centre has virtually given up the task of protecting historical monuments and artefacts by stating its inability to establish a special security group.

 In an affidavit before the Supreme Court, the government said: It is not financially feasible and practically possible to keep all these (art and historical objects) under an umbrella of security provided by the Union government.

 The affidavit was in response to the courts notice to the Centre on a public interest litigation (PIL) calling for a comprehensive proposal for protecting art and historically important objects in the country in the wake of the theft of Rabindra Nath Tagores Nobel medallion from Santiniketan in March 2004.

 The PIL, filed by a social activist, Subhas Datta, had sought a direction from the court to the Centre to set up a force specially trained in history, heritage and arts. Datta also demanded that an inventory of all art and historical objects in the country be created.

 He listed thefts from the Asiatic Society, Victoria Memorial and the Botanical Gardens in Howrah and wanted to know whether similar thefts had taken place elsewhere. Datta also drew the courts attention to the recent theft of a 15th century Buddha bust from the Calcutta Museum.

 In its reply, the Centre stated that the theft of gold coins from Asiatic Society of Calcutta is a fact. The matter was taken up by Calcutta police and ultimately the investigation was closed by the Calcutta police, the investigating agency in the case.

 The Centres affidavit also admitted the theft of Fortress of Bowri of Rajputana from the Victoria Memorial and stated that the matter was promptly reported to Calcutta police. But no follow-up action has been detailed.

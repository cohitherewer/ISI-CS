 Rajan stink in arms cache 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 21: City police today made one of their largest arms seizures in recent years, reviving memories of the huge haul of weapons and RDX confiscated after the 1993 serial blasts.

 A container from Singapore that had been lying at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) for 10 days yielded 34 imported revolvers, three pistols, a silencer and 1,280 rounds of ammunition.

 Police commissioner Anami Roy was tight-lipped on who the arms ? worth Rs 1 crore ? were meant for. The supplier, he suggested, was Malaysia-based gangster Chhota Rajan.

 The shipment had arrived from Singapore on May 11 in the name of Samudra Shipping Company, and was sent by Rajan Nikhalje alias Bharat Nepali, a key Chhota Rajan associate, the commissioner said.

 A handling agent was supposed to take charge of the consignment but it wasnt claimed, Roy told reporters.

 We shall find out who the consignment was meant for. We shall probe all angles and question all the necessary people.

 Chhota Rajan is believed to have developed links with Maoist groups and had been ferrying arms to Nepal-based outfits. Mumbai polices anti-terrorist squad recently arrested several of the underworld dons associates with caches of arms meant for Maoist groups.

 Today, following a tip-off, a crime branch unit raided a godown belonging to Trans India Ltd at JNPT on the citys outskirts and found the weapons. 

 The revolvers and pistols are Webley and Scott, Colt, and Smith amp; Wesson. They were hidden inside one of 27 barrels of all-purpose grease, Roy said.

 Nightlong raids led by encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma netted Mukund Patel, 37, a shipping supervisor. Patel, from whom a revolver was seized, was remanded in police custody till June 1 by a local metropolitan court.

 The seizure has revived concern over the lax security at JNPT, which handles the bulk of container traffic on the west coast, along with Kandla port in Gujarat, and the terror threat to the countrys financial capital.

 Asked if port trust officials will be questioned, Roy replied: Everyone connected to the case will be interrogated. JNPT, however, is per se outside Mumbai polices jurisdiction. 

 Mumbai has been a soft target for terrorists ever since 13 powerful RDX-triggered blasts ripped through the city on March 12, 1993, killing some 250 people. 

 Investigations revealed that over 3,000 kg of RDX and a huge consignment of arms had been ferried to Mumbai via Porbander in Gujarat, and Dighi and Shekhadi on the Raigad coast near the city.

 Ten years later, on 25 August, 2003 two blasts again rocked Mumbai, claiming about 50 lives.

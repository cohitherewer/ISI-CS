Mumbai/Lucknow: Page 3 director Madhur Bhandarkar was today questioned in connection with Preeti Jains alleged plot to kill him, the first time police have summoned him since the starlets arrest on September 11.

 Bhandarkar was at Agripada police station for over four hours. He is believed to have made a formal statement and submitted legal documents pertaining to the anticipatory bail he sought from Bombay High Court last year after Preeti accused him of rape.

 It was a routine inquiry to record his statement in this case, deputy commissioner Santosh Rastogi said.

 In Lucknow, two persons allegedly involved in the plot were arrested. Ramkhilavan, a rickshaw-puller from Hardoi, and an associate are suspected to have supplied the revolver which would have been used to kill Bhandarkar.

 Amit Kumar, SSP of the special task force, said Ramkhilavan had taken a contract to supply a country-made weapon for Rs 2000.

 He had then hired a dhobi, who used to visit Mumbai off and on, to carry the weapon to the contract killer. The police have not disclosed his name.

 A Mumbai police officer Rajendra Kone landed in Lucknow yesterday to look for the duo. They will be taken to Mumbai for questioning.

 YSR district set for big leap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, May 23: For years Kadapa was neglected by successive governments because of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.

 Today, the district is poised for a leap into the future ? only because of him.

 The Congress-led government under Reddy, the doctor-turned-politician who succeeded N. Chandrababu Naidu, has drawn up a master plan for Kadapa and the chief ministers native town and constituency, Pulivendula.

 The focus of the Rs 500-crore development programme is on roads, drinking water, irrigation, schools, hospitals and engineering and medical colleges.

 I may come and go out of power, but people must have basic initiatives for development, Reddy has told the core team of officials involved in planning schemes for his constituency. He has also appointed a team of officials and consultants led by an officer on special duty to speed up development.

 The decades of neglect have given way to a rush of projects.

 Over 15 special programmes, 22 departmental activities and five innovative schemes spread over three years have been designed for Pulivendula, said an official spokesperson.

 Andhra Pradesh roads and buildings minister Jakkampudi Ram Mohan Rao defended the attention being given to the district, known for its granite mines.

 Just because Rajasekhar Reddy did not swim along with other Congress leaders or oppose the TDP (Telugu Desam Party) tooth and nail, the people of the district were doomed ? without roads, water, irrigation, education and health facilities, Rao said.

 What is being done now is to balance the injustice meted out for decades, he added.

 Pulivendula town, where Reddy worked as a doctor at a missionary hospital for a few years, has been upgraded to a municipality. Its granite and barite quarries are ready for a facelift. An indoor stadium, a sports school, a guesthouse, a hockey academy and an underground drainage system are being taken up on a war footing.

 At a constituency development meeting yesterday, attended by over 100 officials from 20 departments, final touches were given to the master plan to promote growth in the district. Among those present was the chief ministers brother and Lok Sabha MP from Kadapa, Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy.

 At the meeting, the chief minister urged the officials to focus on Rayachoti, a town where drinking water is rationed. 

 During the last election campaign I was horrified to note that there were water cards issued by the local municipality. The pink cards are just like the ration cards offering the residents five vessels of water a day, he told them.

 Sixteen villages have been taken up in the constituency for all-round development under the Adarsh Gram programme. The Kadapa airport project will be revived soon. 

 Also on the anvil is the modernisation of the vegetable market and revival of the milk factory at Proddatur.

 Pulivendula will have a brand new hospital with latest equipment, a nursing school and an institute for paramedical training.

 Both Pulivendula and Kadapa richly deserve the new schemes, said rural development minister D. Srinivas. The political hostility of the past regime had stunted the growth of the district.

 Internet and information technology is also poised to make an entry. The concept of Internet villages will spread in Kadapa, said a spokesman. Services like caste certificates and income certificates will be made available online at the block level to the people, he added.

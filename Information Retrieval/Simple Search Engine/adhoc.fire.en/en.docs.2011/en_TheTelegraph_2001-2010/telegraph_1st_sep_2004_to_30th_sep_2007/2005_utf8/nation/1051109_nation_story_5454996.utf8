 CBSE fined for student trauma

 New Delhi (PTI): After a 17-year trial, a Delhi court has fined the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Rs 10,000 for negligence of duty.

 Rajneesh Chandra Narang had applied to the CBSE for re-totalling his physics marks in May 1988 for the board examinations on the condition that the board would inform him of the outcome within 10-12 days. 

 But the CBSE got back to him only after 54 days, spoiling his chance to apply for any of the professional courses. The marks showed an error of about 30 per cent.

 The CBSE did nothing to put an end to the shock, humiliation and trauma suffered by the complainant by delaying the telling of his revised marks. It cannot escape its liability to pay damages for the agony and depression caused to him, said the court.

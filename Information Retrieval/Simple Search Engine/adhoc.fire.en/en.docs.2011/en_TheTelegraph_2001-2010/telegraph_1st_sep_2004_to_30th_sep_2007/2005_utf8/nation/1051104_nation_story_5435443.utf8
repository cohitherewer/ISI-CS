 Left barks, air force bent on sky drill

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 3: Indian and US air force personnel today began inducting aircraft, equipment and crew at Kalaikunda in Bengal for two weeks of war games in the face of protests from the Left Front, which is unhappy with New Delhis military ties with Washington.

 The Left Front has announced it will assemble thousands of activists for a protest outside the Kalaikunda Air Force Station on November 7, the day the exercise begins. CPM member of Parliament Amitabha Nandi today led a demonstration at the Calcutta airport where Indian Air Force aircraft were landing to prepare for the exercise.

 Two IAF aircraft landed at the city airport in the last 24 hours. One arrived from Hyderabad last night; the other from Delhi this morning, an airport official said. He, however, dismissed reports that a US aircraft could not land because of the CPMs protests.

 The CPM cadre gathered in front of the airport around 10 am but were stopped from getting in by a large police and CISF team.

 The protests will continue tomorrow. We wont allow any US aircraft to land at Dum Dum airport, said Nandi, MP from Dum Dum.

 IAF headquarters in Delhi said there was no diversion of aircraft and that the induction was on schedule. Most of the aircraft and personnel were landing directly at Kalaikunda, where the airbase has been developed this year to host foreign crews for bilateral and multilateral aircraft drills. Calcutta airport is the secondary base for the exercise.

 Sources in the defence ministry said they do not expect the Lefts call for protests to be a threat to the exercise. There was even a fair degree of confidence that the demonstrations would be little more than a token show of protest.

 We will protest this in the strongest possible way, was all CPM Bengal unit secretary Anil Biswas would say.

 Coinciding with the exercise named Cope India 2005, Lockheed Martin, makers of the F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft that will be participating in the exercise, is working on a publicity show in Calcutta. The US ambassador to India is likely to visit the city during the exercises from November 7 to November 19.

 In a statement in Delhi, the CPM, Forward Bloc and the RSP said they welcomed the call given by the Left Front in Bengal to hold demonstrations at Kalaikunda on November 7. The parties said the demonstrations were being held in protest against the India-US defence framework agreement and steps being taken to deepen military ties between the two countries.

 The statement noted that the two were conducting a series of joint military exercises and training programmes and that India was also considering the purchase of F-16 aircraft, the kind that will be in Kalaikunda for the exercise.

 An IAF spokesperson in Delhi said air headquarters was not going to change the venue of the exercise. The drill had been planned for more than a year and details were finalised in September when IAF and US air force personnel inspected the Kalaikunda base. 

 A US embassy spokesperson said: The US air force and the US government are working closely with the Government of India and its ministry of defence on all arrangements for this exercise.

 Protests were also held at north Bengals Bagdogra airport today.

 Deportation of settlers to continue

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 3: Despite protests from the Congress and the BJP, the Naveen Patnaik government has decided to go ahead with the deportation of Bangladeshi immigrants from Kendrapara district.

 ?The list has been certified by the district collector and we do not have any doubt,? principal secretary in the Orissa home department, Santosh Kumar, told reporters here. 

 Stating that the state government had merely acted upon the instructions of the Centre, he added that there was no need for any inquiry into the matter.

 The identification process has been carried out meticulously and so, the district administration cannot be questioned for flaws in it, Kumar said, adding that the government has not received any complaint of irregularities.

 Kumar further said the government has not received any instruction either from the Centre or the National Human Rights Commission to review the decision.

 He said the deportation of settlers was a continuation of the earlier process and had nothing to do with the change in government.

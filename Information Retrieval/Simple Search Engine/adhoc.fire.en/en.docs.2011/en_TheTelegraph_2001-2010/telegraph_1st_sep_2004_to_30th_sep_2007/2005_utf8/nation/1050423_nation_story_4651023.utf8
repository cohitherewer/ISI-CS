 Couple says qubool in nikaah on Net

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, April 22: Dolled up in her sky blue bridal finery, 22-year-old Shabnam Khatoon couldn?t wait any more. Why, for God?s sake, was her groom taking so long to connect?

 Everything was in place: her relatives had landed in time; the multicoloured lights and the flowers and the wafting perfume had made a marriage hall of the cybercafe; the qazi and the two witnesses were waiting to get started with the nikaah.

 Only, the video link with her husband-to-be Abdul Kalaam, an engineer from Chennai working in Saudi Arabia, wasn?t happening.

 Out of the blue, the computer monitor flashed to life. Kalaam could be seen seated alongside Shabnam?s mother and sister Shazia, waiting as impatiently as everyone in the Shivpuri cybercafe to get on with the online wedding.

 Then Shazia leaned over to whisper something to her mother. ?Let the nikaah take place first,? the mother replied.

 A minute later, Qazi Mohammed Anwar took the floor. Headphone tightly in place, he asked: ?Should we start??

 Kalaam, who had earlier faxed a signed copy of the nikaahnama to the qazi, nodded. Then he asked that the webcam be adjusted so that his bride?s face would come on view beside his on the monitor.

 That done, the qazi on Kalaam?s side ? both sides have to have a qazi and two witnesses for the wedding to be valid ? boomed: ?Kya nikaah qubool hai?? (Are you willing to marry Kalaam?)

 ?Qubool hai,? said Shabnam, indicating she was game and wrapping up what is most likely the first online nikaah conducted in Lucknow.

 According to Shabnam?s brother Hasrat Ali, his sister decided to marry online because Kalaam did not have the time or the money to come to Lucknow for negotiations.

 Shabnam?s mother and sister apparently went to Saudi Arabia to finalise matters after both parties indicated they were okay with the wedding.

 ?As far as I know, this is the first net marriage in Lucknow,? said P.N. Mishra, the owner of the cybercafe.

 Muslim leaders said the online ceremony was not illegal. ?The nikaah is jaayaz (valid) if it is backed by two witnesses on each side,? said Maulana Khalid Rasheed, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.

 Other leaders said cross-country marriages were catching on fast. 

 ?In India, these marriages are not too frequent yet. When they do become frequent, the Muslim personal law board will have another issue to handle,? another board member added.

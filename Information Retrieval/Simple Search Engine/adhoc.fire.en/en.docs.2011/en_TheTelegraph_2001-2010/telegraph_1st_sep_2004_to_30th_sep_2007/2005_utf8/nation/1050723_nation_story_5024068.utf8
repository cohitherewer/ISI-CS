 Medics in heart-felt cry

 New Delhi, July 22: Indias epidemic of cardiovascular diseases will grow unchecked in the absence of government policies that enable people to change their food habits and lifestyle, medical researchers have said.

 Policies to influence healthy nutrition and physical activity will be important for India where most people do not have access to heart-friendly options, the experts said yesterday at a workshop on the prevention of heart disease in India.

 The annual deaths in the country from cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes, are expected to rise from about 3 million now to nearly 5 million by 2020, according to heart disease prediction models.

 We need to go beyond individual care and look at policy interventions covering agriculture, food industry and even urban design, Dr K. Srinath Reddy, the head of cardiology at AIIMS, said.

 He said about a decade ago, the Netherlands government worked with the local food industry to sharply reduce the levels of transfats ? a type of fat classified as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease ? in manufactured foods.

 Transfats are usually found in baked products, confectionery items and in popular fast-food items.

 Studies show that after the reduction of transfats in mass-manufactured food items, the Netherlands registered a drop in cardiovascular mortality among the elderly, said Reddy.

 Two years ago, the US also initiated a similar move. Britain has drawn up a plan to get food manufacturers to reduce salt content by one gram by the end of this year.

 Experts said India, too, needs to order manufacturers to cut these contents that could reduce the incidence of high blood pressure. 

 A well-designed food-labelling policy would allow consumers to know exactly what type of fat and how much fat they are consuming, said another cardiovascular expert.

 The countrys changing disease patterns suggest that over the next two decades, one out of three cardiovascular deaths will occur among people between 35 and 64 years of age, extracting a toll on families as well as national productivity.

 Some policies may also be needed to help people exercise. When I ask patients with diabetes to walk 30 minutes a day, they say they have got no place to go and do that safely, said Dr Nikhil Tandon, an endocrinologist at AIIMS. 

 We will need city- or municipal-level initiatives to expand the space available for such physical activities, he said.

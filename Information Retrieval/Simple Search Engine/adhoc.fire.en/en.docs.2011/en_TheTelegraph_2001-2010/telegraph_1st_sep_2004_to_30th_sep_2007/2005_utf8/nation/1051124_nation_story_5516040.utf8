 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Left parties want to amend and not scuttle the pension fund bill so that it can be passed before Parliaments winter session ends on December 23.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is backing the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority Bill to the hilt. The bill will make the pension fund contributory and drastically reduce the financial load of the state government.

 The CPM, which once termed the bill non-negotiable, is now willing to negotiate on amendments. But its trade union front maintains the basic concept of the bill is unacceptable.

 We do not accept the very premise on which the bill is founded. The bill is based on a private regulatory authority. This means privatisation of pension, Citu president M.K. Pandhe said.

 When a Left leader suggested the scheme could be made voluntary, Pandhe asked: How can pension be voluntary?

 A final decision will be taken when the CPM central committee meets between December 13 and 15. We will discuss the issue and take a stand, said CPM legislator Nilotpal Basu.

 The new pension scheme is mandatory for newly-recruited central government employees barring those from the armed forces. It does not apply to employees who joined before January 1, 2004.

 The scheme is also available on a purely voluntary basis to all employees in the unorganised sector. The states are entitled to join for the benefit of their employees on a voluntary basis, the bill says.

 The government circulated copies of the bill among Left leaders at the UPA-Left coordination committee meeting on Monday. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has told the government his party will respond by December 15. 

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has informed the Left that 15 states have implemented the new pension fund scheme.

 We do not have to follow them, Pandhe said, not sounding confident his party would back him.

 The CPI was, however, firm it would stand with its trade union Aituc in opposing the bill.

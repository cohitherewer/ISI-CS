 Bail for Preeti

 Preeti Jain

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: A sessions court today granted bail to Preeti Jain, but directed the aspiring actor to surrender her passport and report daily to the officer investigating the case against her.

 Jain was arrested on September 10 on the charge of plotting to kill filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar. 

 Sessions court judge Abhay Thipsay granted her bail on a personal bond of Rs 15,000 with a surety of an equal amount. 

 Jains counsel argued that as co-accused Naresh Pardeshi continued to be in judicial custody, Jain could be summoned whenever needed.

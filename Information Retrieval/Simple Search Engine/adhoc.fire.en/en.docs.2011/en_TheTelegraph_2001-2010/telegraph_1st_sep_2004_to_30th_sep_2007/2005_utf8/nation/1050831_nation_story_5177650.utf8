 Telgi: Long-distance hearing

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: When Delhi additional chief metropolitan magistrate Vinod Kumar took his seat yesterday, it was not for a conventional courtroom proceeding. 

 The hearing was by video-conference ? a big step for the judiciary outside the courtroom? and connected Kumar to Abdul Karim Telgi, the stamp paper scam mastermind lodged in Yerawada Jail in Pune, hundreds of kilometres away from the capital. The temporary courtroom was a studio of the National Informatics Centre.

 Telgi though is not the only one undergoing a trial through video-conference. Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav, who was shifted from Beur Jail in Patna to Tihar Jail on the Supreme Courts orders, is also standing trial in cases in Patna via video-conferencing facilities at Tihar. Yadav is accused of involvement in the murder of CPM MLA Ajit Sarkar.

 Yesterday, after magistrate Kumar arrived at the National Informatics Centre, he was connected to the Pune jail. Minutes later, Telgi walked into his court and bowed before the judge.

 The magistrate introduced himself and asked Telgi whether he had received a copy of the chargesheet. Telgi responded in the positive. 

 The CBI had suggested the video-conference trial after the magistrate demanded Telgis production in court.

 Telgi, who is not keeping in good health, spoke fluent English while replying to the magistrates questions. Two other accused ? Pramod Janwekar and Shekhar Janwekar ? were also produced through video-conferencing. The three were remanded in judicial custody till September 12.

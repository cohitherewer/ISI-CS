 Pak hunt for plot in Mumbai 

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, May 5: A Pakistani team led by deputy high commissioner Munawar Saeed Bhatti has been camping in the city for three days, looking for a suitable site to set up its Mumbai consulate.

 India and Pakistan had decided to reopen their consulates in Mumbai and Karachi during the visit of President Pervez Musharraf last month. Pakistan had shut its Mumbai consulate in March 1994.

 The Pakistanis arrived on Monday and since then have been scouring the suburbs. On Wednesday, Bhatti and Sayyed Mohammed Ahmed visited several plots developed by the City and Industrial Development Corporation in Navi Mumbai.

 ?We have also seen properties in Andheri, Santa Cruz, and Bandra. It is of paramount importance that it is conveniently located for people to seek visas,? Bhatti said today. He said he did not like any of the sites he had seen so far.

 Pakistan still hopes India would concede its demand to be allowed to set up its consulate at Jinnah House, the sprawling mansion at Malabar Hill, once owned by Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

 ?We asked for it way back in the 1970s. We hope the Indian government takes a favourable view,? Bhatti said, adding they would initially look at renting a property before settling down at a permanent venue.

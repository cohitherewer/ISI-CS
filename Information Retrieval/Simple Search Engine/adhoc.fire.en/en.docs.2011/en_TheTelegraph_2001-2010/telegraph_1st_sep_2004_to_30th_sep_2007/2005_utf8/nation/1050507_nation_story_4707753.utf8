 IDBI chief arrested for caste abuse

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 6: The chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), V.P. Shetty, was arrested today and later released on bail after a subordinate accused him of making casteist remarks.

 Police picked up Shetty following a directive from Bombay High Court on Thursday to take cognisance of the complaint filed by IDBI general manager Bhaskar Ramteke. 

 Shetty was released on a bail of Rs 10,000, the deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1, Nawal Bajaj, said.

 On April 30, Ramteke had lodged an FIR under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, at the Cuffe Parade police station, alleging that Shetty had hurled casteist abuse at him.

 Ramteke, who works at the banks stress assets stabilisation funds cell, said in the complaint that the incident took place on the afternoon of April 26 when he visited Shettys chamber on the 24th floor of the IDBIs office at the World Trade Centre in Cuffe Parade. 

 He said he had met Shetty to seek directions on the re-adjustment of the SC/ST backlog ahead of the formal merger between the IDBI Bank and IDBI Ltd.

 According to the complaint, Shetty told him that he knew officials from the parliamentary committees on SC/STs and the National Commission for SC/STs and alleged that they took bribes to settle reservation matters. 

 Ramteke said he had ignored the comment and tried to focus on the issue at hand when a furious Shetty hurled a volley of expletives before ordering him out of the cabin.

 Following Ramtekes complaint, Shetty filed an application before Bombay High Court demanding that the FIR be dismissed. 

 The high court, which heard the case yesterday, directed the police to quash the FIR on the ground that the alleged incident occurred inside a private room and not in a public space.

 The court, instead, asked the police to take cognisance of the complaint under the Civil Rights Protection Act, 1955.

 Shetty has categorically denied Ramtekes charge. An IDBI spokesperson said the bank did not wish to comment as the case was sub judice.

 This is the second such incident reported in the city in a month. Uddhav Kamble, a senior police officer, had accused former Maharashtra director-general of police K.K. Kashyap of making casteist remarks at a meeting.

 The matter was mutually resolved without legal action before Kashyap retired from service on April 30.

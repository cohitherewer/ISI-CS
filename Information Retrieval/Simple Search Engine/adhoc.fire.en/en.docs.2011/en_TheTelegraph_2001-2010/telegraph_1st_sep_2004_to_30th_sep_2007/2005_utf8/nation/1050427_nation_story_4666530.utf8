 Raja Bhaiyya

 Lucknow, April 26: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has initiated moves to help Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya get back the land and the lake in Pratapgarh that the Mayavati regime had taken over and converted into a bird sanctuary.

 Last week, the government initiated the process of denotifying the 424-acre land in Kunda area of the district that the administration had seized in 2003 from Raja Bhaiyya, now the state food and civil supplies minister.

 ?The revenue department has found out that the process followed in vesting the land with the government during former chief minister Mayavati?s tenure was not in accordance with law. So, the revenue department has directed us to denotify the land,? the principal secretary of the forest department, B.K. Sharma, said. 

 ?If you take away land belonging to a gram sabha, this cannot be done without a proper resolution adopted by the gram sabha,? said Sharma, according to whom the Mayavati government did not obtain this resolution. This assumes significance as some of the land was in the name of a gram sabha that was run on Raja Bhaiyya?s diktats.

 The Uttar Pradesh government is also thinking of relocating the Benti pond bird sanctuary as denotification of adjoining land would make it ?extremely unviable?.

 ?If we don?t have the land around the lake, which is now being denotified, how would the forest department develop it as a sanctuary?? asked Sharma. ?So, legal experts are being consulted to relocate it.?

 The Benti pond and the adjoining land was turned into a wildlife sanctuary through a government order dated January 30, 2003.

 The Uttar Pradesh government had released Rs 56 lakh from the Poorvanchal Nidhi and Rs 10 lakh from an MP?s fund to begin work on the sanctuary. The Pratapgarh district magistrate had notified the pond as the Ambedkar wildlife sanctuary on April 14, 2003, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar.

 The administration had begun construction of staff quarters, an approach road, 11 watchtowers and islands in the pond for birds. It had also started fencing and purchase of security equipment apart from plantation of fruit trees, a senior forest official said.

 The principal chief conservator, forests, R.L. Singh, had noted that the place boasts of 35-odd varieties of birds, including herons and weavers as well as many that migrate from China, Siberia and other countries. 

 The Uttar Pradesh government had, after the Samajwadi Party came to power in 2003, withdrawn terror charges against Raja Bhaiyya, who had joined the party in 2002.

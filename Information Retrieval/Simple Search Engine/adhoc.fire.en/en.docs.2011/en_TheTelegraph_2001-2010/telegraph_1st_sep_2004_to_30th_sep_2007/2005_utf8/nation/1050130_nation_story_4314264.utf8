 Sonia slams dynasty rule

 K. SUBRAHMANYA 

 Bhiwani (Haryana), Jan. 29: Fortified by Sonia Gandhi?s refusal to accept the Prime Minister?s chair, the Congress is no longer afraid of the dynasty card.

 Sonia today waded into the Haryana Assembly election campaign, accusing chief minister Om Prakash Chautala of promoting family rule ? a charge usually levelled against the Congress. 

 Ahead of her concluding rally later in the day at Narwana, where the party has pitted Randeep Singh Surjewala, the working president of the state Congress, against Chautala, Sonia exhorted the electorate to end the Chautala clan?s misrule.

 ?Somebody associated with this government who is no longer there (read Chautala?s father Devi Lal) had talked about lok laaj (public shame) and lok raaj (people?s rule) some years ago. You know very well that for the last five years, family rule has been promoted in the state.? 

 Sonia was seeking to clinch the perceived advantage for the Congress in the elections as Chautala and his Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) are confronted with public rejection of the alleged extra-constitutional role of his sons ? Ajay and Abhay ? in administration at all levels. 

 The Congress? frontal attack on the Chautalas in this Jat-dominated area received loud endorsement from the large morning attendance, a development being seen as a measure of Jat disenchantment with the INLD, a party which primarily banks on the support of the community. 

 The party that talked about lok laaj had treated with contempt even basic tenets of morality in public life, Sonia said. 

 Instead of promoting lok raaj, the Chautala government was indulging in nepotism and favouritism. It is a government?s duty to ensure that justice is done to people, but the INLD government has been meting out injustice and promoting lawlessness in the state, she asserted.

 Sonia did not miss the opportunity to attack the BJP though the Opposition party is not really in the reckoning to provide an alternative to the INLD government. 

 Despite its propaganda blitzkrieg that sought to mislead the people, the BJP-led NDA government was voted out last year because it had no policies, programmes or ideology except that of sticking to power, she said.

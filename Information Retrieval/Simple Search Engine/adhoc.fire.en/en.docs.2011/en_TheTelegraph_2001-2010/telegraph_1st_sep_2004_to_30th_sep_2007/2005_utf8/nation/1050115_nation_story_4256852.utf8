 Congress ticket for Pawar?s cricket rival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The Congress high command has fielded the Board of Control for Cricket in India president-elect, Ranbir Singh Mahendra, from Mundhal Khurd in Bhiwani district of Haryana for the February 3 Assembly polls.

 The Congress nomination was made early this morning, four days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for him to take over the BCCI reins from Jagmohan Dalmiya.

 Mahendra had defeated Nationalist Congress Party leader and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, by virtue of Dalmiya?s casting vote, to win a dramatic contest for the country?s top cricket administrator?s post on November 29.

 This will be Mahendra?s second attempt to enter the 90-member Assembly from the seat. Five years ago, Congress nominee Mahendra had lost to Indian National Lok Dal?s Shashi Ranjan Panwar.

 Mahendra has remained a Congress loyalist, though his father and former chief minister Bansi Lal quit the party and formed the breakaway Haryana Vikas Party a decade ago. But his return to the Congress and the merger of the HVP with it two months ago are expected to bolster Mahendra?s prospects of making it to the Assembly from this Jat-dominated constituency.

 The Congress had, during the last Lok Sabha polls, established a lead in this Assembly segment under the Bhiwani parliamentary constituency.

 Surinder Singh, Bansi Lal?s other son and heir apparent to the family?s political legacy, is also a Congress candidate from the erstwhile HVP quota. Bansi Lal has opted out of the race and has bequeathed his Tosham seat, adjacent to Mundhal Khurd, to Singh.

 State Congress chief and former chief minister Bhajan Lal may have reasons to smile as the high command has given preference to his faction in the distribution of tickets over rival factions headed by Jat leaders like Virender Singh and Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

 Govt allays meningitis scare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: With the capital in the grip of panic over the outbreak of bacterial meningitis, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss told Parliament today that the disease has not taken on epidemic proportions and the government is prepared to tackle the infection.

 ?There is no need to panic since the disease is amenable to antibiotic treatment and sufficient stocks of medicines and facilities for rapid diagnosis of the disease are available at the National Institute of Communicable Disease. A control room in the NICD has been set up to receive clinical samples round the clock,? the minister said in a statement this morning.

 He said 91 cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported from the capital and 14 people have died. The toll climbed to 15 today, Delhi government officials told a meeting convened by health secretary P.K. Hota. So far, 111 cases have been reported, they added.

 The health ministry, along with the Delhi government, is closely monitoring the situation and both are working in tandem to check the spread of the disease, Ramadoss said. 

 The symptoms of bacterial meningitis are high fever accompanied by headache, vomiting, neck pain and sometimes rashes on the skin. In extreme cases, patients get delirious and might slip into a coma. 

 All hospitals and private clinics in Delhi have been asked to notify suspected cases to the authorities. 

 Doctors said the disease is mainly being reported from the capital.

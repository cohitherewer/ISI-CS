 Dawood on UN Qaida list

 New Delhi (PTI): The Interpol has decided to issue a special international notice for persons wanted by the UN for having links with al Qaida, including Dawood Ibrahim, in a move that could build up pressure on Pakistan and don.

 Dawood is the prime accused of the 1993 Bombay serial blasts. He is believed to be based in the Pakistani port city of Karachi and a Gulf country. 

 The Interpol general assembly at a meeting in Berlin last week decided to issue the notice against those mentioned in the list, which would be circulated among the UNs 184 member countries.

 The list was issued under UN resolution 1267, which mandates all nations to freeze assets of those named and prevent entry into or transit of such people through their territories. The list mentions Dawood as an Indian citizen, born in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. 

 Uproar over Valley killing

 Srinagar (PTI): Residents of Kulgam area in Anantnag district took to the streets on Sunday morning in protest against security forces, who allegedly shot a civilian in a case of mistaken identity. 

 Tariq Ahmed, the 25-year-old carpet owner, was killed while another youth, Shabir Ahmed, was seriously injured when the Rashtriya Rifles allegedly opened fire, mistaking them as militants, at Bhan village, sources said. The army had laid an ambush in the village.

 Residents demanded action against the security personnel, saying that the soldiers had fired without any provocation and did not even try to ascertain their identity.

 The incident comes barely two months after the army killed three teenagers in Kupwara district under similar circumstances. 

 Fire acquittal

 New Delhi (PTI): Nineteen years after a fire at Siddharth International Hotel that claimed 37 lives, a Delhi court has acquitted two senior management personnel of the hotel who were charged with criminal negligence.

The accused are from engineering, management and pharmacy streams. 

 Border arrest

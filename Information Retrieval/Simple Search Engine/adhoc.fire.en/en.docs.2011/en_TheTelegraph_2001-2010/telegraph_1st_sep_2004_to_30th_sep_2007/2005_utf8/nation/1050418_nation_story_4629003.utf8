 Peeved Dadan rival at Mulayam door 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 17: Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav?s decision to hold its three-day national convention here from April 21 has brought out the bickering in the party?s state unit with a section ?removing? Dadan Pehalwan from the post of president and announcing a parallel committee.

 Leader of the rival faction, Shankar Prasad Tekriwal, has claimed that he enjoys the support of the bulk of members, including two of the four MLAs. Tekriwal is understood to have communicated the matter to Mulayam Singh, requesting him to remove Pehalwan from the president?s post.

 Appointed the state unit chief just before the elections, Pehalwan is said to enjoy the backing of Mulayam Singh and Amar Singh, both of whom campaigned for the party?s nominees in Bihar. The Tekriwal faction was annoyed over Pehalwan?s role in the distribution of tickets.

 Tekriwal, once a minister in the Rabri Devi government, joined the Samajwadi Party a few months before Pehalwan and he was appointed a member of its national executive. But after Pehalwan entered the scene, he overshadowed Tekriwal in the party. Tekriwal contested the Assembly elections but lost while Pehalwan won from the Dumraon seat in Buxar district.

 ?As a senior member of the party, he (Tekriwal) should concentrate on making the national convention a success. He should not weaken the party,? Pehalwan said. But a party leader close to Tekriwal alleged that Pehalwan was running the party in Bihar according to own whims, ignoring the wishes of the majority of workers and senior leaders.

 ?We cannot continue in the party with an erratic person like Pehalwan at the helm of affairs. So, we have requested our national president to remove him,? he added.

 Pehalwan perceives Samajwadi Party?s victory in four seats in the state as ?impressive?, considering the fact that it is a relatively new entrant in the politics of Bihar. 

 ?The fact is that we will play a crucial role in the formation of any government in Bihar. We want to strengthen the party so that our performance improves in the times to come. The holding of the national convention is a major step in that direction,? he added.

 Mulayam Singh, by deciding to hold the convention in Bihar, has given the indication that the party is serious about increasing its influence in the state. 

 Immediately after taking over as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, he had conducted the party?s national convention in Jamshedpur. But the party has not been able to perform well in Jharkhand and it could not win any seat in the Assembly elections there.

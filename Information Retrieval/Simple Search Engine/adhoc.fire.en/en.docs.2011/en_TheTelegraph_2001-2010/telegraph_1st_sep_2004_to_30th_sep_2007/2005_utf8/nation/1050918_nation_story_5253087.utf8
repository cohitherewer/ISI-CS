 KGB report dismissed as absurd

 Lalit Narayan Mishra, who figures in the KGB revelations

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: The 

 Congress and the Left have unofficially dismissed as absurd 

 reports that India was one of the countries most successfully 

 penetrated by the KGB in Indira Gandhis time.

 Neither party was willing to officially go on record although an AICC official rejected the charges as a bunch of lies.

 The allegations are very serious. But perhaps they are meant to boost the sale of the book. We have no doubt they are a bunch of lies, the official said about the extracts from a new book on KGBs global operations which appeared in a London paper today.

 A Left leader waved away the allegation that the current Russian ambassador to India, Vyacheslav Trubnikov, was a former intelligence man. I am sure when these ambassadors are appointed, the Indian government gives due focus to their background before accepting their appointments, the leader said.

 The Indian government has not reacted formally so far. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to return from New York late tonight.

 Former foreign secretary K. Raghunath, who was also Indias ambassador to Moscow, said: Anybody who makes such sweeping comments should be able to substantiate them. Prima facie, the charges made in the report look absurd.

 Raghunath said he was aware of the top-secret records smuggled out by Vasili Mitrokhin, a former archivist of the KGB, on the basis of which the book was written. But he declined further comment.

 The only person who readily swooped on the report was Janata Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav. 

 He said: If it is true, it teaches us that till our people are empowered enough to influence the political class, leaders will be guided by rich and powerful countries. It tells us our foreign policy has never been independent.

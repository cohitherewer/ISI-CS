 Dal talks invite minus ally

 OUR BUREAU

 April 1: The Janata Dal (United) today announced that it would engage all political parties and Independents in talks except the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress to explore the possibility of forming a government in Bihar.

 Senior JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar named the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), CPI, CPM, CPI(ML), Samajwadi Party, BSP, NCP and Independents with whom the party would open talks in this regard.

 The announcement is significant because some of these parties will have nothing to do with a government of which the BJP is even remotely a part. 

 The Dal(U) had won 55 seats in the Assembly elections in alliance with the BJP, which got 37 seats.

 At the party?s three-day ?introspection camp?, which concluded in Rajgir yesterday, senior JD(U) leaders had indicated that they would not dump the BJP in any effort to form a government. 

 Kumar?s statement, therefore, has come as a surprise because it is the first post-poll indication of the party engaging in any effort while keeping the BJP out.

 However, in the 243-member House, even if all members ? except those from the RJD, BJP and the Congress ? join hands, they would fall short of the majority mark by one. Kumar?s statement is, therefore, being seen as convenient political posturing wherein the possibility of the BJP providing support from outside remains open.

 ?It is not a great leap forward if the numbers are taken into account. But Kumar is trying to ensure that he is keen to try out the formula, which is being suggested by LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan for long,? a JD(U) leader said.

 In Ranchi, the LJP chief said the ball was in the JD(U)?s court to form a government in Bihar. ?The onus of forming a secular government in Bihar is on the Janata Dal (United), which should take the lead and detach itself from the BJP. The LJP will respond in kind by mustering the required numbers,? he said.

 Paswan said he was in favour of the continuation of President?s rule in Bihar ?till the mess created by the RJD regime was cleared?. ?President?s rule is always better than no rule in Bihar,? he told reporters. 

 The LJP chief predicted that Jharkhand will have midterm polls in the near future and advised members of the party unit of that state to remain on their toes. 

 He added that the composition of the Arjun Munda ministry and ?internal stress? have started taking their toll on the government.

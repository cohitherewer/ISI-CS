 Trial by candle flame for kids

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Dec. 3: About 35 class V students were forced to hold their palms over burning candles to prove their innocence after a teacher found some money missing from her handbag.

 The agni pariksha (trial by fire) at the primary school ? which left six children with minor burns and many more with mental scars ? has sparked outrage in Kayalpattinam, Tuticorin, about 650 km from here.

 The Tuticorin superintendent of police confirmed over the telephone this evening that the incident did take place on December 1. A case has been registered against the headmistress, Vasantha, following a complaint from a parent. The state education department has begun its probe.

 The teacher had left her handbag behind in the classroom as she went to the toilet to wash her hands after lunch. The bag contained her salary which she had received earlier in the day.

 After returning to the classroom, the teacher decided to count the money again and realised it was short by Rs 200. She immediately complained to the headmistress, who summoned the entire class for questioning.

 The children denied they had anything to do with the missing cash. The headmistress then sent for some candles and after lighting them, made the children hold their palms over the flame and swear they hadnt taken the money. 

 The cash was later found near the toilet.

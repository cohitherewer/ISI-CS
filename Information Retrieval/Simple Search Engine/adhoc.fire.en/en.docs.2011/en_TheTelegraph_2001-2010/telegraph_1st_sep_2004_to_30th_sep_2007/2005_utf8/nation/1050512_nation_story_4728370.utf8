 Crusader food guard shifted

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 11: The state government has transferred its Food and Drug Administration commissioner two months after he took Johnson and Johnson and Parle to task for alleged violations. 

 In March, A. Ramakrishnan had told Johnson and Johnson to drop the word baby from its advertisements. Yesterday, he was transferred along with at least five other senior IAS officers. 

 These were routine administrative transfers, a home department official said.

 Ramakrishnan had told Johnson amp; Johnson nine of its products were wrongly branded as baby products without clearance from the Drug Controller of India. The company was told these products contained liquid paraffin oil, a mineral oil that may not be suitable for babies. 

 Ramakrishnan also sent showcause notices to biscuit manufacturer Parle Products Ltd for displaying pictures of fruits on its packets even though its products do not contain these fruits.

 He sent notices to hair oil companies that advertised that their products contained coconut extracts, and herbal tea companies whose products contained herbal ingredients but not tea leaves.

 Ramakrishnan said the transfer was routine. His promotion was due. He was expecting the transfer, an FDA official said.

 Even as he was set to move out, the FDA today asked the state governments Licensing Authority (Ayurveda) to prohibit the sale of Himalaya Nourishing Baby Oil and reject the Himlaya Drug Companys claim that the baby oil was an ayurvedic medicine.

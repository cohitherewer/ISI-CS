 TVs new find: trade unions

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, July 27: Television rediscovered trade unionism on the streets of Gurgaon near the national capital this week, splashing across the country images of the woman in green taking on the policemen in khaki as Honda factory workers were brutalised.

 Just how was it that television focused so much time and attention, breaking news and telecasting the street battles between the workers and the police live? How was it that waning trade unionism has suddenly captured the national attention?

 A local television operator, Ab Tak Television, which cable-connects some 1.5 lakh television sets in Gurgaon, was the first on the spot. The business is run by two brothers, R.K. Jangra and Ashok Jangra. Ab Tak Television runs a daily local news bulletin for its subscribers in the evenings. Ashok, with no real experience in mainstream journalism, just landed up at the mini secretariat in Gurgaon where the Honda factory workers were assembled on Monday afternoon.

 Using his Sony 3 CCD camera, he took footage of the workers being surrounded, being beaten on their heads with lathis by the policemen, of the brickbatting, of the procession and of the injured in the Gurgaon and Sohna hospitals. He says he sold his footage to a television news agency that in turn distributed the images among channels.

 But producers in at least two Hindi news channels based in New Delhi said they had bought a 16-minute clip for Rs 20,000. There is reason to believe that the footage was also distributed/sold to more channels. On Monday, the first shots of the violence in Gurgaon were from the same footage on nearly all major television news channels.

 In 1999, when camera crews descended on Kargil as the Indian Army strove to eject intruders from the snowy heights, reporters got into bunkers and sent images live. It was Indian televisions first war.

 In much the same way, the battered workers of Gurgaon may have found for trade unions a language of public appeal: make protest telegenic.

 That, and the fact that Gurgaon is part of Delhis suburbia, part of the grandiosely called National Capital Region (NCR), ensured that the media were present on the spot in minutes. Cameramen who covered the violence on Tuesday reported that on both sides ? workers and policemen ? were a few who were performing for them.

 Second witness denies link

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Sept. 5: A second witness today denied any link with the case against Sarabjit Singh, on death row in Pakistan for allegedly having been involved in bomb blasts in the country in 1990.

 Yesterday, Salim Shaukat had told STAR News that he had accused Sarabjit of being involved in a bomb blast in Lahore 15 years ago at the behest of the government advocate.

 Today, another witness, Shaukat Ali, told the same channel that though his name, address and fathers name were correct in the files, he was never a bus conductor nor a bus driver as has been stated.

 I do not know how my name has cropped up in the case, he said.

 This boosted the hopes of Sarabjits family.

 Yesterday there was one person, Salim Shaukat, whose father was killed in the blast stating that he was asked to name Sarabjit as the person he had seen planting an explosive device in the cinema hall, Sarabjits sister Dalbir said.

 Today, another witness has claimed that he was in no way connected with the case though his name, address and fathers name are mentioned correctly in the files. If their statements cannot bring back Sarabjit, it will be a major travesty of justice, she said.

 The Indian government should ask the Pakistan government to ensure security for both of them. I appeal in the name of humanity to the Pakistan government to provide additional security arrangements for both so that nothing happens to them, Dalbir said.

 We have been stating that the whole case was based on lies and allegations. A serious judgment was passed simply on allegations, Dalbir said.

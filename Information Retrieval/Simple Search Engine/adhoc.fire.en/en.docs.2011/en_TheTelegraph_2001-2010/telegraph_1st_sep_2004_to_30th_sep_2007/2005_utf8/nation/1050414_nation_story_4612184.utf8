 PMO throws book at Modi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The page of the booklet that upset the PMO. 

 New Delhi, April 13: The Prime Minister?s Office has objected to the publication of a photograph of Manmohan Singh in a Gujarat government booklet. 

 A spokesperson said the state government ?did not seek the permission? of the PMO before using Singh?s photograph. ?This is a highly objectionable and incorrect practice.? 

 The booklet was part of a publicity campaign launched by Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi highlighting his government?s ?achievements?.

 The booklet, which was released during the BJP national council in the capital last week, focused exclusively on the US government?s denial of a visa to Modi and compiled the articles and statements supporting him. 

 The front page had the pictures of the Prime Minister and the chief minister with a blurb containing an excerpt from a statement made by Singh in the Rajya Sabha, condemning the US?s decision. 

 The spokesperson said: ?Attention of the PMO has been drawn to a publication of the directorate of information, Government of Gujarat, on which a photograph of the Prime Minister has been published alongside a quotation from a statement made by the Prime Minister in Parliament.?

 The PMO, the spokesperson added, will separately convey its ?disapproval? to the Gujarat government. It was pointed out that the Prime Minister?s picture cannot be printed in any official publication without permission.

 Gujarat government sources maintained that they had yet to receive a communique from the PMO and had ?learnt? of the matter only through media reports. Once an official communique was received, the sources said, a decision would be taken on whether the booklet should be withdrawn.

 Varsity heads roll in graft clean-up

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Rajeswar: Firm

 Lucknow, Aug. 8: Uttar Pradesh governor T.V. Rajeswar has struck a blow against corruption in higher education by summarily sacking a second vice-chancellor in three weeks.

 Rajeswar, who has been running a one-man crusade against illegal affiliation and fake degrees, on Saturday dismissed Ram Pal Singh, vice-chancellor of Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, with immediate effect.

 On July 17, the governor ? who is the chancellor of all the 21 state universities ? had sacked Prof. Ramesh Chandra, vice-chancellor of Bundelkhand University, Jhansi.

 An inquiry report has accused Singh of recommending affiliation of various institutions in flagrant violation of the prescribed norms. He has allegedly allowed the B.Ed course to be taught at various centres that lacked proper infrastructural facilities and let students be admitted under management quota in violation of prescribed norms for monetary gains.

 The vice-chancellor has also been accused of misusing university funds amounting to Rs 18 crore.

 Another report charged Chandra with irregularities in evaluation of the answer sheets of an engineering entrance examination (and) recruitment of his wife, sister and nephew in teaching posts.

 The governor also found the vice-chancellor guilty of conferring doctoral degrees against university norms.

 Chandra and Singh have denied the allegations and decided to move court.

 For years, state universities have been granting affiliation to degree colleges, management institutes and B.Ed colleges that lack infrastructure.

 Thousands of students have paid hefty sums to get themselves into college only to find that their teachers are not qualified to teach and that the degrees they have been awarded are worthless.

 Early this year, the governor had ordered a probe into the racket, which involves local politicians and even ministers.

 Under the scanner are Singhs and Chandras universities and five others: Veer Bahadur Singh University (Ghaziabad), Poorvanchal University (Varanasi), Mahatma Jyotiba Phoole Ruhelkhand University (Bareilly) and two agriculture universities. These institutions heads are being probed.

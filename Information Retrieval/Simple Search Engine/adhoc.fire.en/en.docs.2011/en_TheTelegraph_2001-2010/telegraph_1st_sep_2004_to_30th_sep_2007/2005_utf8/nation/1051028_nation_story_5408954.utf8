 Behind old rhetoric, CPMs new face

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Not a great leap forward as yet, but a small but significant victory. That is what Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee got for him and for Bengal at the CPM politburos debate on the question of strikes in the IT sector. Even more important, the way he forced the party to come clean and take a stand on IT could change the way the CPM looked at industries, labour and strikes in general. 

 But, first, it is necessary to see through the party rhetoric that seems to have clouded the importance of the chief ministers breakthrough. 

 The politburo stood by the IT employees right to form trade unions and to resort to collective bargaining. Interestingly, the word strike does not occur in the politburo statement on the IT question. It called for the labour laws to be applicable in this sector. 

 But this position says nothing of the debate within the politburo. Nor does it signify a victory for Citu, which thought that 19th century working conditions existed in the IT sector. As if to try and set the agenda for the politburo discussions, Citu president M.K. Pandhe even dismissed the idea of the party recognising any special status for IT. It is a money-making business, he had said. 

 One could actually argue that the politburos statement was a ploy to divert the peoples attention from the real issue. The constitution guarantees the right to form trade unions and to strike for the employees in any sector. So what was new in the statement? And, when the CPM leaders said that no strike should be forced on IT employees, they were uttering platitudes once again. The party and Citu maintain, at least theoretically, that force should not be used to enforce a strike.

 Contrast this with what the politburo statement and the subsequent media briefings by Prakash Karat had to say on Bhattacharjees stand on IT. True, the chief minister sought a ban on strikes in IT, which he did not get. But then, no communist or Left party can afford to agree on a general ban on strikes in any sector. 

 So why did Bhattacharjee ask for it, one might ask. Obviously, he was upset with Citu for forcing the September 29 strike on IT. This was, for him, a worrying development as Bengal had signalled a new approach when his government adopted the IT policy in 2002, in which the sector was given special status. 

 Given this backdrop of the debate, it should be considered an important victory for Bhattacharjee that the party had accepted the need for a detailed inquiry into the nature and services in the IT sector.

 Cut out the rhetoric and this actually translates into an acceptance of IT as a special service. It was his push for a change that compelled the politburo to prepare a document on the issue and place it at the next central committee meeting. It could well be a turning point for a comprehensive rethink in the CPM on strikes and other issues related to labour not only in IT but also in many other sectors. 

 The other major success for the Bhattacharjee line is that Citu will have to consult the state units of the party before organising strikes. In Bengal, that would mean Citu falling in line with the chief minister and state CPM secretary Anil Biswas, who has been more with the former than with Citu on union issues. 

 But the clearest signal of the politburos support for Bhattacharjee came in another way. The party now left the decisions on strikes in IT not only with the state units, but also with the employees of IT firms. 

 It simply means Citu cannot force a strike on IT employees. And, if they dont have unions, there is no question of them going on a strike. So, it may be politically correct for the politburo to say IT employees have the right to form unions and to strike. On the ground, the reality makes the sector strike-free. 

 The politburo statement and the leaderships explanations fall into place with the CPMs new politics. Old ways are changing, if not by choice, by the compulsions of the new, globalised economy, but the old rhetoric is still needed to keep the flock together. 

 It has been the same with questions relating to capital ? private and foreign ? and other issues. It is only a matter of time before the changing party face shows in IT or labour reforms. Moved by the compulsions of governance, as opposed to Citus preference for confrontations, Bhattacharjee has forced the party to face the inevitability of more changes.

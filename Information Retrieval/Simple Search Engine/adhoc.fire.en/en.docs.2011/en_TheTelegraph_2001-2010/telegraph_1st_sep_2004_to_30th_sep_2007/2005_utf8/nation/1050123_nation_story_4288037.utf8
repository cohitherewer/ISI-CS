 Alert system minus help

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: India has decided to develop a tsunami warning system of its own rather than go with the United Nations or the US.

 The system is proposed to be based at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information and Services in Hyderabad. The National Institute of Ocean Technology at IIT Chennai will also develop tsunami simulation models to study the phenomena.

 Ocean development minister Kapil Sibal today said: ?We are not joining any US- or UN-led system. India will set it up and if there are others who want to follow, we will consider it. We will not hesitate in forging alliances with other countries when it comes to information or buying technology, but we are not thinking of a joint front. We have to have our own tsunami warning system.?

 The UN has set a 2007 target for putting in place a global warning system while the US is planning to extend the cover of its system.

 Sibal was addressing a media conference today at the end of a two-day brainstorming session on tsunamis. The session was organised by the department of science and technology in association with the department of ocean development and the Indian National Science Academy.

 ?International sharing of tsunami-related information will be done to the extent necessary. We will establish networks with other countries susceptible to tsunamis, such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the east coast of Africa, Mauritius, Thailand, Madagascar and Indonesia, to enable dissemination of information and share data relevant to the onset of any tsunami in the future,? Sibal said.

 Talking about the high cost of imported technology, science academy president R. Mashelkar assured scientists that warning systems could be developed indigenously at a far lesser cost. 

 Secretary, ocean development, Harsh Gupta said the Hyderabad centre ?already has much of the equipment and the systems necessary for tsunami detection?. The proposed warning system will be installed at a cost of about Rs 125 crore, he said.

 But the investments will be futile unless the local community is educated about tsunamis, Professor V.S. Hegde, a delegate, pointed out. ?Some very simple things can save your life. We should not wait for disasters to discover that our systems are not working, that is why drills are important.?

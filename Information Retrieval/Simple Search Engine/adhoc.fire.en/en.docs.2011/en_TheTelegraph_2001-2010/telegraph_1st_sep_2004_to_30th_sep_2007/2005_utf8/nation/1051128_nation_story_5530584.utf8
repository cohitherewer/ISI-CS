 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 27: A youth from Kottayam has been languishing in the US Armys custody in Iraq since August but his family has no word yet on his fate.

 Sijo Jose, 26, was picked up by the US forces in the northern town of Mosul in Iraq on August 1. He was reportedly caught with a digital memory stick containing incriminating material.

 A certificate-holder in catering and hotel management, Sijo was working for Tariq Alghanim Company Ltd, a Kuwaiti firm that caters to the US Army in Iraq.

 Local legislator Stephen George said, according to the information given by the Indian external affairs ministry, the US forces had found that the memory stick contained snaps of prohibited areas.

 He used to ring me up every week but never told me he was in Iraq. Probably he didnt want to upset us, mother Marykutty said. She last heard from her son on July 23.

 The family learnt about the incident on August 22 from Sijos mates ? Manoj and Santhosh ? in Iraq. 

 Brother Sojan Jose, an autorickshaw driver, then petitioned the chief minister on August 24.

 But it was the tragic killing of Border Roads Organisation driver Maniappan Raman Kutty in Afghanistan that seems to have sent the government on an overdrive. 

 Wed heard nothing until recently after the slaying of Maniappan. Revenue minister K.M. Mani and the local MLA visited us today and showed us correspondence between the chief ministers office and the ministry of external affairs. Perhaps now things would move faster, Marykutty said yesterday.

 The chief ministers office said in a release that the matter was promptly taken up with the external affairs ministry, which sent a note in September to the effect that Sijo was in custody of the US forces. 

 The matter was again taken up with the Prime Ministers Office recently.

 Sijos uncle Philip Thomas said the family had received two payments of Rs 34,000 and Rs 18,000 recently from the Kuwaiti catering company. He said the family depended on the sons income. 

 Sijos sister is studying nursing in Belgaum in southern Karnataka. His father, a farmer, is anxious and hopes the US personnel would not ill- treat him. 

 The family wants the boy home at the earliest. But they are scared about his prospects on whether he would be able to take up jobs in West Asian countries in future.

 The Kuwaiti firm has nearly 100 employees, about 30 of them from Kerala, at the catering unit in Mosul. Many of them are in India on leave. They were recruited in Mumbai two years ago on a monthly salary of Rs 18,000 for working in West Asian countries, including Iraq, sources said.

 India too big for UK aid boots

 AMIT ROY

 London, March 17: The British government should take a fresh look at how it gives aid to India because although the country still has millions of poor people, it is not as poor as it once was, a group of MPs said today.

 These days, the focus of the British government?s attention, thanks to Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister) and a possible future Prime Minister, is Africa.

 As such, India ?will become a much lower priority for the Department for International Development (DFID)?, the MPs? 79-page report says.

 India receives ?200 million of bilateral British aid, which is expected to rise in the medium term to ?300 million. This is more than what any other country receives but the sum ?is marginal for the Government of India and brings DFID little influence over the Indian government?s development policies?, the MPs argue.

 One of the MPs who has lent his name to this report (?DFID?s bilateral programme of assistance to India?), which basically suggests scaling down India on the British list of priorities, is an Indian himself ? Piara Singh Khabra is a Punjabi and a Labour MP who represents the heavily Punjabi constituency of Ealing Southall.

 He is not being anti-Indian, though. The committee is an all-party affair and includes Labour, Tory and Lib Dem members.

 For some months, the chancellor has been talking about the ?challenge? posed by China and India, as he did in his budget speech yesterday.

 However, with an election not too far away, the government cannot be seen to be too nasty to India.

 The report says the DFID?s aid programme to India ?lacks strategic focus? ? which is a bureaucratic way of saying Britain either does not know where the money is going or that the UK government has no control over how the funds are spent.

 The committee says India is poor but not that poor.

 The report puts it this way: ?Although 350 million of India?s population live on less than one US dollar a day, India is developing to become a middle-income country within the next 10-15 years.?

 The problem for India is that some of its propaganda that it is becoming an emerging superpower is beginning to have effect. The MPs are, in effect, saying that if India is doing as well as it says it is doing, the money being channelled there could go to needier countries.

 The MPs cannot resist including a bit of a lecture to the Indian government. They say: ?There is a need for DFID to draw the Indian government?s attention to socially-excluded groups.?

 There is no suggestion that aid to India should be cut off, however. ?We are convinced that, at present, India qualifies easily for DFID?s assistance, on both high poverty and good governance grounds,? the report states.

 The important qualification here is the phrase ?at present?.

 All in all, the MPs do not think that the DFID is doing that great a job.

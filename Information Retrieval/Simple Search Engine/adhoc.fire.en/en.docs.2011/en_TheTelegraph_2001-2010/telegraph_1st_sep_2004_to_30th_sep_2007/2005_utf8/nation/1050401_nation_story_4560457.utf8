 Delhi glare on medical colleges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: The UPA government is planning to bring in a legislation to clean up the mess in medical education, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said today. 

 He, however, said the government was in no hurry and would have consultations with states and private and public medical college authorities before finalising the bill.

 A draft bill prepared by the health ministry was ready and would soon be sent to all state governments for their views, the minister said. 

 He did not give a definite time frame for introducing the bill in Parliament but said it would be within a year or two. 

 Rationalising medical college admissions and ensuring that those with money do not get an unfair advantage is at the heart of the reforms.

 The mushrooming of private medical colleges, the pressure of students wanting to become doctors and the increasingly large capitation fees students have to pay to enroll in private medical colleges have made the government consider enacting a comprehensive law to stop these practices. 

 Courts have intervened in several states to ensure that deserving students are not pushed out of private medical schools by the power of money of more affluent and not necessarily brighter students.

 But it is not just admissions that the government wants to set right. Ramadoss said the curriculum in medical institutes would be changed and upgraded to keep pace with the advances in medical science. 

 ?The curriculum we have today has not been changed for over 50 years and we believe it is time to take a fresh look at medical education and add new segments like family medicine and minimal access surgery into the course,? the health minister said at an interaction for better medical education organised by his ministry in the capital.

 Representatives of government and private medical colleges attended the meet. 

 ?We are not curbing anybody, we are merely trying to regulate medical schools to emphasise on quality education,? Ramadoss said.

 Fresh turn to farmer suicides

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: Contrary to popular belief, several farmers who committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh over the last few years belong to upper castes, Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has informed the Lok Sabha. 

 A survey in Medak, Anantpur and Prakasam districts by the National Institute of Agriculture Management showed that 51 per cent of the farmers who committed suicide belong to upper castes, 28 per cent to backward castes, 15 per cent to scheduled castes and 7 per cent to scheduled tribes, Pawar told the Lower House yesterday.

 The minister was replying to a discussion on demands for grants to the agriculture ministry.

 More than 4,000 farmers had committed suicide in Andhra in the last three years of the Telugu Desam Party regime and in the first year of the Congress rule.

 Pawar said he would soon convene a meeting of chief ministers to discuss measures to improve the situation of farmers across the country.

 The survey revealed that 80 per cent of the farmers who committed suicide belonged to the 21-50 age group. Fifty per cent of the victims were illiterates and 76 per cent depended on the monsoon for irrigation.

 The major causes for the suicides include debt, lack of irrigation facility and drought, asserted the minister.

 Pawar said cooperative banks had said they could not reduce interest rates on loans in the agriculture sector below 9 per cent for the next couple of years, though private banks were agreeable to the suggestion.

 He also assured the Lok Sabha that he would do away with the law prevailing in states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana under which a farmer who defaults in repayment of loan is sent to jail.

 Many industrialists default in repayment of loans but nobody is arrested or jailed, said Pawar. ?This (the arrest of farmers) is very shameful. We need to respect our farmers. I will take up the matter with the state governments concerned,? he said.

 Pawar said the Centre would soon bring the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act to help farmers get better remunerative prices for their produce in private and public mandis. ?This will help farmers as currently middlemen buy their goods at their own prices and, thus, deprive farmers of getting a good price.?

 The minister said the aquaculture bill will be brought next week while the seed bill is with a standing committee.

 Later, the House approved the demands for grants to the ministry by a voice vote.

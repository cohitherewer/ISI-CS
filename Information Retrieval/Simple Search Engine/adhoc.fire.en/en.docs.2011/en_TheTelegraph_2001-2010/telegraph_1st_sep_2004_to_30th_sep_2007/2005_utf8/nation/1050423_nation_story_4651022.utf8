 Violence greets peace rally

 Hyderabad, April 22: Maoists struck terror in Andhra Pradesh today even as the state Congress leaders launched a shanti yatra (peace march) to appease them, reports our special correspondent.

 The march, aimed at persuading the Maoists to resume peace talks, started at Ibrahimpatnam in neighbouring Ranga Reddy district. It was led by Andhra Pradesh Congress committee president K. Keshav Rao, with Union sports minister Sunil Dutt in tow.

 In the early hours today, the Maoists killed a sarpanch, Rajeswar Rao, of the Telugu Desam Party, at Buddaram village in Warangal district, 180 km north-east of the capital.

 ?Guerrillas asked Rao to come out of his house for a discussion and shot him point-blank,? said Stephen Ravindra, police superintendent of Warangal district.

 The rebels also killed a BJP leader, Mahender Gowd, of Mantala village in Ranga Reddy district.

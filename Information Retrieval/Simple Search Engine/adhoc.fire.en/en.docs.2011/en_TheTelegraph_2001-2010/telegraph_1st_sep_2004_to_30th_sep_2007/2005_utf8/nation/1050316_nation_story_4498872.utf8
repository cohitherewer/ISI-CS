 Gas on guest?s plate

 Rice gets off her flight in New Delhi

New Delhi, March 15: Possible supplies of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan and the Indo-Iranian gas pipeline are among the issues likely to be discussed tomorrow between the Indian leadership and the visiting US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.

 She arrived here this evening on her first-ever visit to South Asia. She is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and senior South Block officials tomorrow. 

 Rice will also meet leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani. Later tomorrow, she will fly to Islamabad where for the next few days she will hold talks with the Pakistani leadership.

 Rice is scheduled to go to Afghanistan from Pakistan. But indications are that she will spend only a few hours to speak to Afghan leaders before returning to Islamabad.

 On the face of it, Rice?s visit to India and the region is being seen as a ? familiarisation trip?. It also indicates the priorities that the Bush administration wants to draw up in the next five years in Asia. Both India and Pakistan are important allies of Washington and Rice?s visit re-affirms the fact.

 But there are areas where the two sides have serious differences. For India, the possible sale of F-16s to Pakistan is an important issue. Delhi has made it clear that the sale at this juncture ? when Indo-Pak peace process has been moving forward ? may create unnecessary obstacles.

 The US is not happy that the proposed gas pipeline was being seriously thought of as a viable project by India and Pakistan at a time when the US is trying to exert pressure on Tehran to give up its clandestine nuclear programme.

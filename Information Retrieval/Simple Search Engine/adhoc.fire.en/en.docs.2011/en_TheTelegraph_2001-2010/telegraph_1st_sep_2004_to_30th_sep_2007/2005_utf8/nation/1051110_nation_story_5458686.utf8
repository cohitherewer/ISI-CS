 Govts to keep daily wagers records 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: The Centre, states and Union territories must from now on maintain records of the hundreds of thousands of daily wage earners employed by government departments.

 The Supreme Court has ruled that a designated officer should sign these records and, when a daily wage earners services are no longer needed, hand him a certificate stating the number of days he has worked.

 In the case under consideration, the worker had proved he had worked for 240 days and the court said he should be paid 50 per cent back wages in keeping with a decision of the labour court. 

 The three-judge bench mentioned that daily wage earners are not regular employees, are not given letters of appointments or letters of termination, and are not given any written document which they could produce as proof of receipt of wages.

 A daily wage earner cannot claim to be a permanent employee even after 240 days of continuous work, the court said, but his monetary claims can be decided correctly if a register is maintained.

 The governments should take steps to maintain proper records of the services rendered by the daily wagers; these records should be signed by the competent designated officers and at the time of termination, the concerned designated officers should give certificates of the number of days which the labourer/daily wager has worked, the court said. 

 This system will obviate litigation and pecuniary liability for the government.

 The bench said mere affidavits by daily wage earners would not be enough to prove how long they had worked.

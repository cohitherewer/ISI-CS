 Fast-court glare on Bengal, UP

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 29: The Supreme Court today asked the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Bengal to explain the status of fast-track courts (FTC) in the states. 

 Taking a ?serious view? of the states that had discontinued with these courts, a special division bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia asked the Uttar Pradesh government to explain why the FTCs had stopped functioning in the state, flouting its order, and directed Bengal to explain their status.

 Counsel P.S. Narasimhan had earlier argued that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, ?instead of providing land and other infrastructure for the FTCs, is seeking details from the high court as to how many cases are pending in the FTCs, what is the disposal rate, etc?.

 In Uttar Pradesh, 32 FTCs have stopped functioning since March 1, 2005. The judges directed its government to state the ?circumstances? responsible for the development.

 During the last hearing, the Centre had informed the apex court about lack of funds and told it that the 12th Finance Commission, too, could not provide any help. The court had then ruled that the over 1,700 FTCs in the country should continue to function till April-end. Today, the bench said: ?We will continue to monitor FTCs.?

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati told the apex court that the cabinet committee on economic affairs, pursuant to its order, has sanctioned Rs 509 crore for the continuance of 1,562 FTCs for a period of five years from April 1. 

 The committee has also agreed to provide an additional Rs 8.6 lakh for each court for the expansion of courtrooms.

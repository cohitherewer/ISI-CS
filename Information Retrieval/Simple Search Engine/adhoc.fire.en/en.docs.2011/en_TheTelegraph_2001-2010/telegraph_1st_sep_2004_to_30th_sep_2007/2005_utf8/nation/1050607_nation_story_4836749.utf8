 Police today filed an FIR against Indian crickets first pin-up boy and seven others travelling in a two-vehicle convoy with three carcasses ? those of a young, female black buck and two rabbits. They were stopped at Jhajjar in Haryana by the police.

 A case under Section 9 (Prohibition of hunting), Section 39 (Wild animals are government property) and Section 51 (Punishment for violation) of the Wildlife Act has been filed. 

 The other accused named in the FIR are Shashi Singh, Dayal Singh, Shaheed Ahmad and Dayasuddin, who are residents of Delhi, Mohammad Ayub Khan, a resident of Gurgaon, and Madan Singh and Balwan, residents of Orangpur village in Jhajjar. 

 Pataudi continued to evade the media despite several attempts to contact him at his Delhi residence.

 The IG of Rohtak range, V.N. Rai, said the post-mortem report had confirmed it was a black buck. Asked if Pataudi could be arrested, Rai said: We have also arrested a person, Madan, in connection with the incident and his statement is being recorded. On the basis of his statement and other evidence, we will arrest others.

 Wildlife Trust of India director Ashok Kumar said senior trust veterinarians had examined the carcass, brought to Delhi on Sunday by Naresh Kadyan, People for Animals activist and master trainer with the Animal Welfare Board of Haryana. People for Animals is an NGO founded by animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi. 

 Receiving information that Jhajjar police had stopped what was alleged to be the former Indian captains hunting party near Dadanpur village, close to a bird sanctuary, Kadyan had reached the spot. He alleged that Haryana police had buried the carcass after a post-mortem and were trying to pass off the animal as a nilgai.

 The nilgai is a Schedule IV animal and killing it would invite a fine. But the black buck is a Schedule I animal and killing it is punishable with a minimum imprisonment of three years that can go up to seven years.

 Ashok Kumar said: We have ascertained it was a black buck and have taken pictures. We did not have to do a second post-mortem as the condition of the carcass was such that there was hardly anything left. All that was left was the skull and the hind legs and a little bit of skin. The throat had been slit. Halal had been done and most of the meat had been taken away. It was actually stored in a little portable fridge which is kept in the car.

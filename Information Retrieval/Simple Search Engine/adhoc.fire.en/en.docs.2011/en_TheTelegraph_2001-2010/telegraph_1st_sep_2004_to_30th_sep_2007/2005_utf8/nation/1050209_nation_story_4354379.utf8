 Patna HC strong words for cops 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna. Feb. 8: The ?Friday fracas? hogged the limelight at Patna High Court today, a day after advocates struck work to express their solidarity with Juctice R.S. Garg.

 Taking suo motu notice of ?inflammatory? media reports and police failure to prevent the ?attack on judiciary?, the court directed the government to take due action and asked Bihar director-general of police Narayan Mishra to report tomorrow.

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain took exception to the police failure to prevent troublemakers from demonstrating near the court and raising defamatory slogans against Justice Garg.

 On Friday, trouble broke out on Bailey Road after the police allegedly arrested the muazzin of a local mosque on charges of using loudspeakers. 

 The bench directed the police to identify and take proper action against the offenders. It also expressed serious concern over ?provocative? portrayal of the incident by a Hindi news channel and a local daily. 

 The court also took up the Indian Medical Association?s petition on deteriorating law and order in the state and directed the police to arrest legislators Pappu Khan of Biharsharif and Uma Shankar Singh of Maharajganj by Monday. 

 Student back home

 Police today rescued Harsh Ranjan, the 12-year-old boy who was abducted from his uncle?s house on Saturday, and arrested four persons in this connection, reports PTI.

 According to Samastipur superintendent of police Meghnath Ram, they acted on information provided by eight persons detained for interrogation and raided a house under Harpur Pusa police station and rescued the Class VII student.

 Ram said four persons were taken into custody during the raid and Harsh Ranjan was handed over to his family.

 Heavily armed dacoits had looted the house of a retired school principal, Ramanarayan Prasad Singh, on Saturday night and abducted his nephew Harsh Ranjan at gunpoint, he said, adding that a country-made revolver was recovered during the raid.

 Hurriyat bitter taste before dinner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 17: Kashmiri separatists had kept away from the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus. But as the bilateral peace bus moved into the next gear in Delhi, Pervez Musharraf promised a group of Kashmiri separatists that they would be on board this time.

 Musharraf is learnt to have assured Hurriyat Conference moderates that the Kashmiris would not get left out when India and Pakistan are close to hammering out a solution to the Kashmir problem.

 He also agreed to suggestions by the Hurriyat Conference leaders that they should be allowed to go to Pakistan and meet their counterparts in the other Kashmir.

 ?We are satisfied with the meeting and the assurances,? the acting chairman of the Hurriyat Conference, Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, said after a meeting with the Pakistani President that lasted for one and a half hours.

 Musharraf also got a taste of separatist politics in Kashmir. He had given three groups of Kashmiri separatists about half-an-hour each and expected to be in time for the dinner hosted by the Pakistan high commission. The President was there for the dinner but one hour behind schedule.

 This, after he apparently clubbed two groups ? the moderate Hurriyat and the Yasin Malik-Shabir Shah combine ? to reduce the delay.

 Musharraf?s meeting with the hardline faction?s leader, S.A.S. Geelani, did not help matters. Geelani apparently spoke for far too long, trying to convince the Pakistan President that he was taking the wrong road. There should not be any confidence-building measures (CBMs) or peace moves unless the core issue of Kashmir was resolved, he told the President, replaying what Musharraf had advocated during his Agra trip. 

 Musharraf is learnt to have initially tried to convince the hardliner that he is still on the road to resolving the Kashmir issue but did not succeed.

 Asked if he was satisfied with the meeting, Geelani retorted: ?What is there to be satisfied? We had to convey our point to him and we did that.?

 Instead of trying to unite the separatists, Geelani advised Musharraf, he should differentiate between ?pro-movement and anti-movement? people.

 Pakistan should not bank on those who are out to ?sell themselves? for petty political gains, Geelani reportedly told the President, referring to the Hurriyat moderate faction which has been supportive of the peace process. Geelani is also learnt to have turned down a suggestion for a group photograph with the other Hurriyat leaders.

 An agitated Geelani is understood to have later remarked that he felt the Kashmiri people had been betrayed by Pakistan.

 The Mirwaiz is learnt to have asked Islamabad to come up with more CBMs, including additional travel routes.

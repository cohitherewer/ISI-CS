 Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 12: India will take a positive decision on opening up retail trade to foreign investments in a few months. 

 Speaking at a meeting with business leaders at the Asean summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said: I hope we can come up with some positive outcome (on the debate over opening up retail) within the next five to six months. 

 Singh, who was responding to a question from a Malay business baron, said: There are problems in opening up to FDI (foreign direct investment) in retail. Its a matter being debated within the government. 

 Then, to the surprise of many at the meeting, he added that a positive outcome was expected. 

 The Congress-led alliance government Singh heads has been at odds with the Left parties supporting it from outside over opening up retail to foreign investment. Left leaders have said they were not opposed to bringing foreign investment into back-end operations like cold storage, but would oppose opening up retail trade as it could jeopardise the livelihood of millions of small shopkeepers.

 The Prime Ministers time frame of five to six months does, however, remind one of the statement made by Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last week that he did not tell Wal-Mart, the US retain chain, that it could not hope to enter India, but that it would take time. 

 Singhs statement here could still raise the ire of Left leaders, though he also took care to praise them. Replying to another businessmans query about relations between business and politicians, he said: In West Bengal we have a Left Front government which is creating world-class facilities to woo investment.

 Calling the government forward looking, he pointed out that Bhattacharjee had recently made a trip to the Asean region to showcase his state as an investment destination.

 He announced that with Mumbai and Delhi airport modernisation coming up, the next in line would be Calcutta and Chennai through the public-private partnership route by March next year.

 Upgradation of the Calcutta airport has been a major demand of the Left Front government, but both the CPM and the CPI have been opposing the privatisation model adopted for Delhi and Mumbai, arguing that the job could have been done by the government-run Airports Authority of India. 

 Bhattacharjee may feel a little disappointed by the Prime Ministers statement on Indias intellectual capital. In reply to a question, Singh praised the southern cities of Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai for having emerged on the infotech map of the world as the intellectual capital of the country.

 Calcutta, despite all of Bhattacharjees efforts to project the city as an aspiring centre of knowledge industries, slipped the Prime Ministers mind.

 Having been brought up on a steady diet of high-brow literature and films, Bhattacharjee could very well ask, though, if thriving centres of infotech ? whether Bangalore or Calcutta ? could be described as intellectual capitals.

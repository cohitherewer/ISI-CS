 24 appeals in SC on life term

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Supreme Court today admitted 24 fresh appeals by as many life convicts from Bengal who have sought release on the ground that they have already spent 14 years behind bars.

 The appellants are from the Behrampore Central Correctional Home and their plea joined the two PILs that have petitioned the court to fix the length of a life term at 14 years. 

 One of the petitions was by apex court advocate M.K. Balakrishnan and the other by the Society for Human Rights and Civil Liberties against the state of Haryana.

 The conflict over what a life term means has arisen because in many cases life convicts have not been released after 14 years despite a Supreme Court verdict that life term means full life term spent in prison.

 Moreover, jail manual rules in different states provide for release of life convicts after 14, 18 or 20 years.

 The issue has given rise to another debate as different benches might give different verdicts. Balakrishnan had said he would move an application so that the petitions are clubbed and heard together by one bench.

 Todays petitions were before a bench of Justices S.N. Variava and Tarun Chatterjee. 

 In their common application, the 24 appellants said they have completed 14 years of actual incarceration and are languishing in Behrampore Central Correctional Home.

 The bench posted the matter to October 19.

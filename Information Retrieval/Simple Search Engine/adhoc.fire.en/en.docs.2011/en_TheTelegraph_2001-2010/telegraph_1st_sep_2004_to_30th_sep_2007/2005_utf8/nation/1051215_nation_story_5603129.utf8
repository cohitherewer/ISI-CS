 Quota bill derailed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: An unexpected turnaround today forced the Centre to put off introduction of an amendment bill that will make it mandatory for unaided private educational institutions to reserve seats for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students.

 The BJP led the clamour in Parliament, demanding to know why unaided minority institutions had been kept outside the ambit of the bill.

 This egged on OBC legislators to join in the mayhem with demands to include OBCs within the proposed quota. Kerala MPs, too, added fuel to the BJP fire.

 Hemmed in by dissonant voices a month after all parties unanimously backed the bill in and outside the House, Arjun Singh requested Speaker Somnath Chatterjee to defer the introduction.

 The HRD minister wants a consensus on the bill, which seeks to amend the Constitution. It was drawn up to counter a Supreme Court order that struck down SC/ST quotas in private educational institutions. 

 We are hoping to introduce the bill next week, a senior HRD ministry official said.

 He said if efforts to work out a consensus failed, the government would still be able to muster the two-thirds majority required in the Lok Sabha to pass the bill.

 You count the numbers. We can still pass the bill without the BJPs support, he said.

 The HRD ministry was taken aback by the volte-face by rivals, all of who had backed the bill at an all-party meeting. Even the Left allies seemed to shift stance. 

 CPM legislator Nilotpal Basu said at a news conference the Left was behind the bill that stood for positive discrimination, but he added a rider.

 There is a need to relook at Article 30 of the Constitution (which gives the right to establish minority institutions). The context in which it was laid down has changed, he said.

 These minority institutions now have a large number of general category students.

 HRD ministry officials said the Lefts revision in stance is not significant. 

 They are under pressure from their Kerala MPs. Nearly 90 per cent of these institutions in Kerala are minority institutions, an official said.

 Reliance engineer killed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 26: A daylight shooting spree by motorcycle-borne criminals killed a Reliance engineer and a contractor today.

 Sanjeev Kumar, the engineer, and contractor Ravi Ranjan were on their way back after visiting a site in Vaishali around 2.30 pm when their Maruti came under indiscriminate gunfire in front of Rajeshwar hospital in the Kankarbag area.

 Terror-struck pedestrians and bystanders fled the scene.

 A doctor from Ranchi, Kamlesh, who was passing by was critically injured. He is admitted in a private nursing home and has undergone an emergency surgery but is still in coma.

 Police suspect the shooting is a fallout of rivalry over some contracts. 

 It seems that it (the attack) has to do with controversy over some contracts in Hajipur sometime ago. We are yet to ascertain the facts. Investigations are on, city police superintendent Rakesh Rathi said, after visiting the spot with senior officers. 

 The police, though, could not verify if AK-47 rifles were used. They said the 9mm bullets recovered from the spot suggest that such a weapon could have been used. 

 Witnesses said the indiscriminate firing went on for at least five minutes after which the assailants fled.

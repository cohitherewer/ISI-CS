 Bush waits for Singh, with tiger

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, July 16: After scouting for months for a policy gift which would personally please Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his three-day visit to Washington from Monday, the White House has settled on an issue that is close to Singhs heart: protecting the tiger. 

 One of 16 Indo-US joint initiatives to be launched during Singhs meeting with President George W. Bush on Monday is a project to protect the Bengal Tiger.

 Final details of the initiative are still under scrutiny, but American sources said they may go as far as to join the worldwide Tiger Conservation Initiative. Until now, the US has kept out of the initiative, which groups India, Bangladesh and several other countries, which are the natural habitat of tigers. Canada is the initiatives most recent member.

 The Indo-US project to protect the Bengal Tiger from threats of extinction follows Bushs insistence that he must do for Singh something that is in addition to grand policy visions, such as co-operation in space or nuclear energy: something that the Prime Minister would treasure as a gain not only for his country, but also for an issue to which he is individually committed.

 The search for such a policy gift has been going on for months. Protocol officials and policy wonks at the state department, the White House and various Bush administration agencies put their heads together and talked to their Indian counterparts. But several ideas, which were proposed did not find favour at the top of the Bush administration.

 Finally, the President took matters into his own hands. When he went to Gleneagles this month for the Group of Eight (G8) summit, he requested British Prime Minister Tony Blair to seat him next to Singh in what has come to be known as the G8 plus five part of the summit.

 This part of the annual summit now brings together the G8 leaders and leaders of five emerging economies ? India, China, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa ? as well as the heads of the International Energy Agency, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the UN. This part of the summit comprises a meeting and a dinner.

 Bush asked Blair to seat him next to Singh at the G8 plus five, according to sources here, because the President wanted to get to know the Prime Minister better before Singh arrived at the White House. The two leaders have had three meetings so far, but, sources said, it was only at Gleneagles that they got to know each other.

 Bush, who has a reputation of viewing anything to do with environment with extreme suspicion, is said to have come back from Gleneagles convinced that the US should join the Tiger Conservation Initiative.

 The joint project to be unveiled here on Monday will focus on the tiger population in the Sunderbans and Buxa in West Bengal, in addition to other parts of India where the species are threatened, according to officials giving final touches to the initiative.

 It will seek to revive co-operation between research and educational institutions in both India and the US, which are engaged in wildlife protection and the environment.

 In preparing the project, officials here are said to have pored over details of Singhs visit to the Ranthambore National Park in May, when he ventured up to five feet of Lady of the Lake, one the tigresses in the park. 

 Bush is said to have personally familiarised himself with accounts of a task force set up by Singh to protect the tiger after they allegedly disappeared from Sariska.

 In 2005 and indeed in the second term of President Bushs tenure in office, there is certainly no higher priority than expanding and broadening our relationship with India, a senior administration official, who cannot be identified because of the ground rules for his briefing, said here yesterday.

 The tiger initiative and the other 15 similar ones are meant to demonstrate that we have never had an Indo-US relationship as comprehensive and as broad-based and so important in its full dimensions for both countries. We see India as one of our key partners worldwide, the official emphasized.

 Fight over fine after mike mayhem 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 12: Yanking off the Orissa Speakers microphone may cost three Congress MLAs Rs 20,000 each.

 Speaker Maheswar Mohanty is firm about the fine while the MLAs ? Debasis Patnaik, Nimai Sarkar and Rabindra Mallick ? are equally adamant about not paying it.

 The trio had tried to climb onto the Speakers podium on Wednesday, demanding a CBI probe into alleged links between several ruling Biju Janata Dal legislators and the tender mafia.

 As todays session came to an end amid further protests and walkouts ? but without discussion of a possible revocation of the fine ? the Congress sounded a defiant note.

 MLA Lalatendu Mohapatra said that if Rs 60,000 was the penalty for damaging the Speakers microphone, the ruling party should declare the rates for assaulting the chief minister, the Speaker and the chief whip and for breaking the Assembly chairs.

 In the post-lunch session, leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik said his MLAs had protested in the legislature in keeping with democratic traditions and the chair should have protected them, not fined them.

 Nothing can be more undemocratic than this, Patnaik said. Everything was going on in a democratic manner. The Speaker refused to listen to us.

 Only the Speakers microphone was broken and nothing else was damaged. So, there is no question of the MLAs paying up.

 The Opposition today kept up the heat on the government, repeatedly storming the well and shouting slogans to press for a CBI probe into the alleged BJD-mafia nexus. Little business was conducted in the pre-lunch session. After lunch, the Opposition walked out.

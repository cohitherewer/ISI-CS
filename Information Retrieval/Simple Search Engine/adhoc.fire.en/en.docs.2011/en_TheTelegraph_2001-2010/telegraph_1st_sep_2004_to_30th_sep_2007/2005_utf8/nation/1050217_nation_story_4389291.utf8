 Valley erupts in bus cheer

 OUR BUREAU

 Srinagar/Jammu, Feb. 16: A power-deprived Valley, plunged in darkness, lit up with firecrackers today over the news of the imminent launch of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service.

 ?It is a dream come true,? said Deen Mohammad, a university student in Srinagar. ?The bus will reunite thousands of families. Something great is happening to blood-soaked Kashmir after a long time.?

 The jubilation was matched by the welcome noises the political parties made even as they tried to corner credit for the April 7 opening of the road that has been in disuse for over five decades.

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said in winter capital Jammu that it was a ?historic? step that would ?heal many wounds that time and distance had wreaked on local hearts?.

 ?It is our mission that has been realised,? he said at a hurriedly convened news conference this afternoon, indicating his ruling People?s Democratic Party?s main plank in the last Assembly polls.

 Party president Mehbooba Mufti drove home the claim. ?We fought the 2002 Assembly elections here with the chief electoral plank that the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road should be opened as a prelude to easing of tensions between India and Pakistan.?

 ?It has been our firm belief that Kashmir must serve as the bridge of friendship between the two countries. Today, that dream has been realised,? she said.

 In her rival camp, Farooq Abdullah attributed the idea to his father, late Sheikh Abdullah. ?My late father and founder of the National Conference had requested the then Pakistan President, General Ayub Khan, in 1964 that the road must be opened to allow the divided hearts to rejoin. That has finally happened.?

 The positive attitude extended to the separatist camp. The moderate faction of the All Parties? Hurriyat Conference described the scheduled opening as ?a small significant step towards a solution to the Kashmir problem?. 

 ?The step taken by the two governments will hopefully narrow down distances and promote closer relationship in terms of understanding each others? point of view on issues confronting people in the subcontinent,? Hurriyat chief spokesman Abdul Gani Bhat said in Srinagar.

 The sentiment of the common man on both sides of the border was no different. ?If the two countries have been able to agree on the road opening across the Line of Control, the day is not far off when they will agree on a permanent resolution of the Kashmir dispute,? said Ghulam Mohiuddin of Srinagar, whose sister lives in Abbotabad, Pakistan.

 ?After 15 years of separation from my dear ones, I will be able to meet them? I am just counting the days until the bus service starts and I can go home,? said Muhammad Iqbal Awan of Muzaffarabad, capital of PoK, who migrated 15 years ago.

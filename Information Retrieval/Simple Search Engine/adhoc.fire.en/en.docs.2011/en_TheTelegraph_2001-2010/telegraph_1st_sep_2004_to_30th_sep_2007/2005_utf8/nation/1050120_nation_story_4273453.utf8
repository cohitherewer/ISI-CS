 Delhi ire for Bihar chief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: Stung by the sudden disarray in its Bihar unit, the Congress central leadership is extremely cut up with state party president Ram Jatan Sinha who on Monday chose not to contest the seat allotted to him.

 The leadership made known its disapproval of Sinha?s conduct as he arrived in the capital last evening for consultations on finalising the names of party nominees for the second and third phases of polling in the state.

 ?The party discipline applies to all. Having been nominated by the leadership with his approval, Sinha has violated party discipline by not filing the nomination papers before the deadline expired yesterday,? said an AICC functionary. 

 On its first list of 17 candidates released last Friday, the party leadership nominated Sinha from the Warsaliganj constituency. Sinha, who was eyeing the Makhdumpur seat, was himself present at the meeting of central leaders where his nomination from Warsaliganj was finalised, said the functionary. 

 But the Bihar Congress chief failed to file his nomination before the deadline ended on Monday. Apparently, he developed cold feet after the Lok Janshakti Party fielded local strongman Akhilesh Singh?s wife to retain the seat which she had won last time as an Independent. 

 Senior Congress leader Arjun Singh is understood to be particularly upset since he had persuaded Sinha and others in the central leadership against entering into a tie-up with Laloo Prasad Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal and in favour of the party contesting as many seats as possible. 

 The party?s problems do not end there. While senior leader Ramashray Prasad Singh has defected to the LJP, Sarfaraz Ahmed, a former state Congress chief, has joined the RJD in Jharkhand. In Gaya, Awadesh Kumar Singh left the party to contest the elections as an Independent candidate from a seat of his choice.

 Sinha is believed to have offered to contest from a ?suitable? constituency in the second or the final phase of polling in Bihar. But the leadership appeared hardly in a mood to overlook his act of ?indiscipline?.

 PM gets a pat for save-tiger push

 Tiger: Still unsafe

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Wildlife activists who exposed the flourishing trade in tiger skin across the Tibetan plateau have welcomed the Prime Ministers move to push for the creation of a National Wildlife Crime Bureau when the cabinet meets in the third week of this month. 

 Tiger conservationist Belinda Wright of the Wildlife Protection Society of India and activists of the Environmental Investigation Agency, an international NGO, had caught on camera evidence of a huge open market of tiger and leopard skin, which are used as trimmings in traditional Tibetan garments called chuba. 

 Travelling extensively through the Tibetan plateau in August, the activists had documented the open sale of the skin of big cats in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Sichuan and Gansu provinces. Traders there categorically stated that the tiger skins were from India. 

 We are delighted the Prime Minister is taking a lead role on the international stage and look forward to seeing effective enforcement and co-operation between India, Nepal and China to stop the trade. Its critical, however, that India reminds China how a revived trade in tiger bone would spell doom for our tigers, Wright said.

 The activists are concerned that the Chinese government is reportedly considering re-opening domestic trade in tiger bone.

 The wildlife crime bureau would be tasked to investigate poaching cases and catch poachers. 

 The Prime Ministers Office said the Centre is planning to entrust three border forces ? the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Sashastra Seema Bal and the Border Security Force ? along with customs officers at the China and Nepal borders with the detection of cross-border smuggling of wildlife articles. 

 Manmohan Singh has also directed that the matter be taken up through diplomatic channels with China and Nepal. Namo Narain Meena, the Union minister of state for environment, would hold talks with Chinese authorities during his visit to the country.

 The creation of the National Wildlife Crime Bureau was mooted at a meeting of the National Wildlife Board, convened by Singh last year, after news of tigers disappearing from the Sariska wildlife sanctuary made headlines.

 But while the steps taken by the Prime Minister are commendable, it is essential that domestic enforcement is also improved, with emergency action on the ground to protect tigers, Wright said. 

 Organised criminal networks run the tiger skin and bone trade and India needs to use professional crime fighters to stop them, she added.

 Debbie Banks, a senior campaigner with the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: It is vital that the police, customs and intelligence agencies play a lead role in directing enforcement operations. In China, we need to see a massive awareness drive among consumers and targeted enforcement against smugglers and dealers.

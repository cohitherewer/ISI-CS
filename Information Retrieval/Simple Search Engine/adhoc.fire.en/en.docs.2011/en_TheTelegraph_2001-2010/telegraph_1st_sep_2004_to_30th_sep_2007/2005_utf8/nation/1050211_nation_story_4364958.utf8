The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 India on hiring high, but Calcutta lies low 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: As the economy opens up, job profiles are changing, but not the profile of the country?s eastern region. 

 A survey shows the January-March quarter will see 70,000 new jobs created, but only 3,841 of these will be in the east. Among eight large cities, Calcutta ranks at the bottom in terms of growth of job opportunities.

 The employment survey, done by Ma Foi Management Consultants, a human resource service provider, was conducted among 2,046 companies across 17 sectors in the products and services category.

 The survey also tracks the national hiring confidence index. On this scale, too, companies based in Calcutta and Bengal show the least confidence in hiring people.

 While the national average is 85 per cent, Calcutta lies at the bottom with 55.56.

 K. Pandia Rajan, managing director of Ma Foi, said the survey excluded government departments.

 Rajan explained how confidence levels as well as job profiles are changing. 

 ?If you go to Tirupur, you?ll witness buoyancy. They (the textile mill owners in Tirupur) believe that they?ll win over the competition from China and other countries. 

 ?Even as the young look at new sectors like retail, call centres, a senior Army official during his recent visit down south was ruing the lack of interest among the youth in military jobs.?

 The survey throws up a growing trend of temporary staffing. It predicts an increase of 11.47 per cent by the end of the quarter, taking the base of such employees in the total to 12.84 per cent.

 Hospitality, print and media amp; entertainment are among the largest hirers of temporary staff. Healthcare is a sector where hiring is rising but the top 10 remain the same as in the last quarter with IT and ITES in the lead.

 If the east shows little change, neither does the gender profile. Ma Foi found that women formed only about 17 per cent of the workforce.

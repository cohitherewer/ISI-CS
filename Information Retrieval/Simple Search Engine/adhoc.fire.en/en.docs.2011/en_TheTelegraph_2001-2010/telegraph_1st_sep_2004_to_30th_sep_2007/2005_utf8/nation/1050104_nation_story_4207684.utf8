 IMA back on warpath

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 3: The Bihar unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) today threatened to launch a statewide agitation if the government failed to rescue abducted surgeon U.K. Raja within 72 hours. 

 An IMA delegation met chief secretary K.A.H. Subramaniam and said the doctors would be compelled to strike work if Raja, abducted last Saturday, was not rescued within the stipulated period. 

 Sources said Subramaniam expressed hope that the doctor would be rescued but failed to give any categorical assurance. After the meeting, state IMA president Vijay Shankar Singh said, ?Our association will meet again on Thursday to decide the course of action if the abducted doctor is not rescued by then.? 

 Latest reports from north Bihar said doctors of Purnea and neighbouring Saharsa have already struck work while their counterparts in Madhepura will do the same from midnight.

 The IMA had called an indefinite strike in November following the murder of Patna-based surgeon N.K. Agrawal on Diwali. The strike had paralysed health services across the state for a week.

 Amid uncertainty over Raja?s safety, both Purnea and Madhepura police have claimed that they have identified the gang involved in the abduction. 

 ?Our special task force is working overnight to trace the doctor and arrest the culprits. But we need time to plan and execute our strategy. Have patience,? superintendent of police Sudhansu Kumar said in Purnea. 

 On the other hand, the Bihar Engineering Services Association (Besa) gave the government 48 hours to arrest the killers of Aditya Kumar Thakur and a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased. 

 Thakur, executive engineer of the state public works department, and two others were killed at a roadside hotel near Muzaffarpur on Friday. 

 ?When it comes to the question of the security of state engineers, the government is following double standards,? Besa president Awadesh Prasad Singh alleged, referring to the abduction of NHPC engineers T. Mandal and K.K. Singh last November.

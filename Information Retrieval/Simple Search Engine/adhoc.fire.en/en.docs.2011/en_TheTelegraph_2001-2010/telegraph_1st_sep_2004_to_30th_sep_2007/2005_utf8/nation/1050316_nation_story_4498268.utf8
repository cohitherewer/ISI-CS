 Shakti Kapoor apologises

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 15: Actor Shakti Kapoor today offered a public apology to people he had hurt ?unintentionally?.

 Kapoor, caught in a sting operation by television channel India TV, where he is shown to ask for sexual favours from a reporter pretending to be an aspiring actor, said that he was sorry for remarks involving film industry personalities Yash Chopra, Yash Johar, Subhas Ghai, Priety Zinta, Rani Mukherjee and Aishwarya Rai.

 The actor said that his words were doctored. He also said that he had conveyed his ?deepest apology? through SMS to Ghai, Zinta, Mukherjee and Rai.

 ?With folded hands I have apologised to the entire film industry,? he said. 

 He added that he also apologised to The Film and TV Producers? Guild of India, an industry body that imposed a ban on him.

 Kapoor said he felt that since he had campaigned for the Congress, a rival political party was behind this ?conspiracy?.

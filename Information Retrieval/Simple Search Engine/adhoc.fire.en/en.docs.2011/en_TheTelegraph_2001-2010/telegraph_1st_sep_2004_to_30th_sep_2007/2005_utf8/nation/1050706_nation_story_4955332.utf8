 Calcutta, July 5: An improved forecast model developed by a wing of the Indian Meteorological Department predicts that monsoon this year will be good and that rainfall between June and September is likely to be around 3 per cent more than normal.

 Sources said the departments official monsoon forecast, likely to be issued on Wednesday, will be close to the figure arrived at by the new model.

 The last forecast, issued on April 20, had predicted 98 per cent rainfall.

 The Neural Network model, developed by Pulak Guha Thakurta of the National Climate Centre ? the office of the additional director-general of meteorology, research ? is based on data collected between 1992 and 2004. It will soon be published in an international magazine, Weather and Forecast.

 A unique feature of the model is that it can predict monsoon for each of the 36 meteorological subdivisions of the country. Currently, only a general forecast is issued for four broad regions ? northeast India, northwest India, central India and south peninsular India.

 The model predicts a good monsoon, though certain parts will receive reduced rainfall, said A.K. Srivastava, a director of the climate centre. Rainfall till June-end was 15 per cent less than normal, but we are confident the deficit will be compensated in the next few weeks. 

 Explaining the reason for the delayed monsoon this year, a climatologist said the radiation balance in eastern Tibet attained the optimum level for attracting rain clouds only after June 12. The region was cooler than it should have been for timely arrival of the rains. 

 Long-range forecast expert D.S. Pai of the climate centre said the monsoon might have arrived late in certain parts, but it gained strength after June 22 and covered the entire country by the end of the month. 

 The states to receive less than average rainfall, according to the model, include Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra (Marathwada). Bengal and Orissa will receive standard rainfall. Monsoon is likely to be good also for the whole of the Northeast (like last year) and Uttar Pradesh (unlike last year).

 Last year, moderately meteorological drought conditions ? resulting from rainfall deficiency by 26-50 per cent ? had prevailed in Punjab, Himachal, west Rajasthan, Vidarbha and Telengana. The average rainfall across the country had been 13 per cent less than normal, as reported by the climate centre in its Annual Climate Summary.

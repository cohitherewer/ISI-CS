 UAE breather for outdoor workers

dubai (PTI): The UAE has made 

a four-hour afternoon break mandatory for those who work outdoors. 

 The rule, which applies for the next two months, has brought respite to thousands of labourers, including many Indians, working in the blistering desert heat.

 The labour and social affairs minister of the UAE, Ali bin Abdullah Al Kaabi, has directed employers not to let staff work in the sun between 12.30 pm and 4.30 pm during July and August. 

 He said working hours in the morning shift should not exceed five hours.

 The order said working hours should not exceed eight hours a day and anything above this will be considered as overtime, for which labourers will have to be paid extra. 

 Labourers who are forced to work throughout the day will now be able to lodge complaints with the labour ministry, the minister said.

 We do not accept such inhuman attitude. It is not in our religious values nor is it our social norms to ignore humanitarian aspect in our practices, a local daily quoted the minister as saying.

 Jail after 45-day luxury

new delhi (PTI): A city court 

has sentenced a man to three years imprisonment after he pleaded guilty

 Sarvanan Palaniappan had checked in at the Taj Palace hotel in south Delhi posing as an executive of a UK-based company on a business tour from Chennai last year.

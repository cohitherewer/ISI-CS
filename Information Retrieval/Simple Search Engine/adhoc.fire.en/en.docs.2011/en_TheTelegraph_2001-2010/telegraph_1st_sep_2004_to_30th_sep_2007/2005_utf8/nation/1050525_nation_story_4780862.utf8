 Court notice to RBI chief

 Jaipur, May 24 (PTI): Rajasthan High Court has issued contempt notices to Reserve Bank of India governor Y.V. Reddy and three State Bank of India officials for failing to comply with a court order.

 The notices were issued to the regional manager of SBI, Jaipur, K.N. Tripathi, and two officials for not complying with an earlier court order which directed the bank to make payment on a seven-decade-old security bond.

 In the petition, Mahendra Singh Rathore, a member of the Bikaner royal family, stated that his grandmother had deposited Rs 28,300 as security bond in the then Imperial Bank of India, which later became the State Bank of India. 

 The high court had last year ruled in favour of Rathore and had directed the bank to make the payment within two months.

 Quota cry and jab at Jaya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Dindigul (Tamil Nadu), March 13: The DMK today stepped up its anti-Brahminism and sought reservation for religious minorities while passing resolutions with an eye on the Assembly polls next year.

 Anticipating polls earlier than the scheduled early 2006, the party dubbed the Jayalalithaa government in her second avatar as a symbol of ?corruption and Brahminism?.

 A former DMK MP even called for driving away Brahmins from their traditional forte of performing pujas in temples.

 ?The Agamas-based (sacred texts) rituals in all temples in Tamil Nadu should be replaced by the Tamil mode of worship,? M. Ramanathan said, taking a dig at ?influential Brahmins?.

 The party, however, urged the friendly Congress-led Centre to immediately ?make separate reservation for the religious minorities in educational institutions and employment a reality?.

 Another of the party?s 41 resolutions passed on the last day of its two-day conference here sought a constitutional amendment to incorporate ?workers? right to strike in the Constitution itself?.

 The Jayalalithaa regime had sacked hundreds of thousands of government employees after they went on a strike. She has been trying to woo them back after her party?s drubbing in last year?s general elections.

 Presided over by K.S. Mani, a DMK veteran from Thanjavur, the conference used the party?s sweep of the Lok Sabha polls to claim that the ADMK?s ?rout? was ?inevitable? in the Assembly elections.

 Wary of seeking presidential intervention to rein in the Jayalalithaa government after the Goa and Jharkhand crisis, the DMK only called for a ?regime change? to protect democracy and the fundamental and civil rights of people.

 One of its seniormost leaders, general secretary K. Anbazhagan, called Jayalalithaa a ?political accident? in the history of the Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu.

 He questioned the ?contribution? to Tamil society of a leader who ?keeps performing yagnas every week? and said she was only strengthening ?Brahminical practices? despite her government?s action against the Kanchi seer to show no one was above the law.

 The DMK?s Vetrikondan demanded that Jayalalithaa ?be arrested in the same uncivil manner past midnight by the same police officials who arrested (M.) Karunanidhi in June 2001? once the party regains power.

 Another DMK speaker painted the chief minister as ?out-and-out anti-Tamil? because she had once declared in the Assembly she was a ?papathi (Brahmin woman)?.

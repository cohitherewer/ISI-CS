 No age relief for employees

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: The Naveen Patnaik government has refused to raise the retirement age of state employees from 58 to 60 years citing financial constraints.

 During a meeting with the leaders of Orissa Karmachari Sangram Samiti recently, the umbrella body of government employees, chief secretary Subash Pani argued that the pension burden will increase if the retirement age is raised to 60 years. Besides, it will also squeeze recruitment avenues and affect the process of rightsizing the administration.

 The Sangram Samiti leaders argued that several state governments have increased the retirement age to 60. Officers belonging to IAS, IPS and other All India Services and doctors enjoy such benefits, they said, adding that the Orissa government will save money by not having to pay retirement benefits for two years.

 However, Pani said the retirement age of government doctors is high as only experienced medical practitioners are capable of dealing with the problems of patients, especially those in the remote areas. 

 The financial burden on the government due to retirement benefits has increased manifold. 

 In Orissa, expenses towards salary, pension and debt servicing account for over 70 per cent of the total expenditure.

 The government also turned down the employees? demands for merger of 50 per cent dearness allowance with basic pay and restoration of leave travel concession and surrender leave facilities, citing financial constraints on this occasion too. 

 It also rejected the demands for payment of bonus and incentive allowance for employees serving in tribal areas and reduction in the pension eligibility age.

 Patnaik had held discussions with the leaders in June 2003 and promised to fulfil many of their demands.

 The chief secretary, while rejecting most of the demands, promised the employees? representatives that he would call a meeeting to sort out the problems of pending pension and departmental promotion. 

 Pani said he would convene a meeting with establishment officers of various departments in the state secretariat and the heads of the department offices concerned to resolve the matter.

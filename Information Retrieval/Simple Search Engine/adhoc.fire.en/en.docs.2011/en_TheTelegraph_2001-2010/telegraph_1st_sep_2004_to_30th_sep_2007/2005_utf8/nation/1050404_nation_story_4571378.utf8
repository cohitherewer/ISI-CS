 Delay pushes Vivek and aid to Pondy

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Chennai, April 3: Vivek Oberoi has gone to Pondicherry and with him has gone the housing project that he hoped to set up in Tamil Nadu.

 Compelled by a deadline set by donors for specific commitments and the Jayalalithaa regime?s delay in announcing a housing policy for the tsunami-hit, the Bollywood actor shifted his rehabilitation project to the nearby Union territory.

 Prospective donors ? corporates abroad ? ?had to close their books on March 31 and wanted specific commitments on the housing project by February-end?, Vivek said here today.

 The actor, who had jumped into tsunami relief in Cuddalore district?s Devanampattinam village soon after the December 26 disaster, had met donors? representatives during his two visits to London and another to West Asia. 

 The commitments they sought primarily had to come from the state government in terms of land acquisition and its allocation and rules for implementing housing projects.

 The housing policy came too late ? announced last week ? for Vivek to hang on to Devanampattinam.

 ?But I do not blame anybody, least the Tamil Nadu government,? the actor said. He praised state officials ?at all levels? for helping out his relief and rehabilitation initiative, Project Hope, ?in the initial phase of relief work at Devanampattinam?.

 ?But Tamil Nadu being a huge state in terms of its coastline and the damage wreaked on it, the state had to take its own time to assess everything,? Vivek said.

 The ?careful and cautious approach? took time and ?my donors, to whom I went with a begging bowl to raise funds for the tsunami-affected, could not wait too long for financial year-end considerations?, the actor added.

 ?My donors were also allocating a lot of money to other tsunami-hit countries like Sri Lanka and Indonesia.? It?s then Vivek decided to shift to Pattinacherry village near Karaikal in Pondicherry so that the donors? offer of Rs 11 crore does not go waste.

 Instead of ?losing our donors, I thought why not use that amount for a similar housing project for fishermen in nearby Pattinacherry?, he said. The Pondicherry government responded, quickly identifying and acquiring land.

 ?Without the land, you cannot convince your donors on a massive housing project,? Vivek explained. Some local politics did impede his efforts in Tamil Nadu ?but I am not here for politics or upping the ticket sales for my movies?, the actor said.

 Professional commitments, too, were waiting. ?I had taken a break from movies for three-and-a-half months, giving up some prestigious projects that came to me.?

 ?Three of my producers have waited long enough and I will have to get back to work from April 15,? he added.

 Pattinacherry fishermen will be accommodated in at least 300 houses spread over 25 acres, split into clusters that are interspersed with gardens and will have a green belt. ?We did not want ghettos,? Vivek said.

 ?It is going to be a major rehabilitation effort costing about Rs 11 crore which we want to complete by October 15.?

 Vivek expects the ?modern facilities?, including a playground, school, health centre, panchayat office, storm-water drainage and a commercial area for selling fish, to ?lift them (fishermen) up to a new level?. He, however, has not forgotten Devanampattinam. 

 Vivek, who spent last night singing and dancing with his friends in Devanampattinam on returning from Karaikal, said: ?I would love to be with them again.?

 ?Most of their other requirements we have already fulfilled,? he said.

 including 4,000 fishing nets, nearly 15 boats, five new engines and four big nets, among others,? he said.

 Vivek, who spent last night singing and dancing with his friends in Devanampattinam on returning from Karaikal, said: ?I would love to be with them again.?

 The construction of permanent houses for them, however, would have to await other helpful souls, which, Vivek said, ?is what my Project Hope aimed to inspire?.

 ?I have to get back (to acting) some day, I cannot be here forever,? the actor added.

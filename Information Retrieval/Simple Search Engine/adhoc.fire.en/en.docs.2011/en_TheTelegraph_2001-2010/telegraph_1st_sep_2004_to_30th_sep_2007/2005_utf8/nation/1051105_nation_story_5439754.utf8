 Sweet break for Nitish

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Nov. 4: Say CM and Nitish Kumar, the NDAs chief ministerial candidate, blushes. Probe how he will improve education in Bihar and he says it is too grave a matter to be discussed over Id sewain (sweets).

 The serious man of Bihar politics does not usually associate fun with matters political. But Nitish Kumar can afford the luxury when he is taking a break from the poll-time rigmarole of hopping on to and getting off what he calls an air tractor, known better as a double-engine helicopter, piloted by a Brazilian.

 No campaign for me today. I had taken one off for Durga Puja and I will take another for Chhat. But I seriously think this schedule takes a toll on your health, said the engineer-politician.

 The Id Milan was organised on the terrace of the apartment block in which Ali Anwar, the president of Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, an association of deprived Muslims, lives with his family.

 The Janata Dal (United) leader who likes his green vegetables and chapatis was happy scooping from his bowl of sewain. Nothing more for me. Sewain is enough, he told Anwar, resisting the sumptuous spread.

 Although surrounded by journalists and political workers, he found time to mingle with women and children who had been invited to the function in good numbers. Look, he is Nitish Kumar. He looks so different today, whispered a young girl, surprised by the cap the politician was wearing.

 A reporter expressed concern over the low percentage of polling in the first two rounds. What better turnout do you expect? I think an average of 45 per cent is big enough. You should not forget the migrant labour force that is out of Bihar to make a living this season. It should marginally go up ? by one or two percentage points ? in the third round because many of them would have come home for the festivals, Nitish retorted.

 Not satisfied, the reporter said something about democracy entailing a turnout nearing 100 per cent. 

 I couldnt agree with you more on the ideal situation. A better way would be to make polling parties travel from one house to another, of course with the voting machines, asking people to exercise their franchise. That would take care of your complaint. I mean it, seriously, the JD (U) leader said.

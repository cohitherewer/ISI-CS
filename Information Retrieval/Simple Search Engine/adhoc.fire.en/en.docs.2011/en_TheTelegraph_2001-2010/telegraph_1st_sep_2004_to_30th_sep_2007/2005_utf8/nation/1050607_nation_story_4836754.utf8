 CBI first step in Denel case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 6: The CBI today filed a case against unnamed people for malpractices in purchasing arms and ammunition from the South African state-owned firm, Denel.

 In April, the Centre had asked the CBI to probe if middlemen were involved in deals struck with Denel and froze all transactions with the company.

 CBI sources today said the agency has registered an FIR against unnamed people in the anti-materiel gun deal.

 This is the first case taken up by the CBI after the Centre referred to it 37 defence deals struck during the NDA regime. The Centre handed over a file to the CBI for its probe among which were documents on the purchase of anti-materiel guns during George Fernandess tenure as defence minister in 2003.

 The probe by the CBI was ordered after reports emerged from South Africa that Denel had allegedly paid commissions to a British firm, Varas Associates, to procure orders. 

 Among the other cases the CBI has been handed is the purchase of caskets to ferry war casualties during the 1999 Kargil conflict.

 The CBI had been asked to launch a preliminary investigation into the Denel deal in April. The agency had written back to the Centre that it wanted specific charges to be probed.

 The defence ministry clarified to it that the inquiry should be at two levels. On the transactions in the wake of the Kargil war, the CBI will be referred to the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Central Vigilance Commission because the investigation is a post-mortem. At the second level, the CBI will be asked to inquire into the involvement of middlemen in securing for Denel the Rs 300-crore contract for anti materiel guns.

 According to investigations in South Africa, Denel is suspected of paying commissions of 12.75 per cent to Varas, a firm registered in the Isle of Man, on all deals it secured. India had entered into a state-to-state deal for the order of anti-materiel rifles with Denel and it was agreed that no agents should be involved. 

 The deal for the anti-materiel rifles is said to have been cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Security in September 2003.

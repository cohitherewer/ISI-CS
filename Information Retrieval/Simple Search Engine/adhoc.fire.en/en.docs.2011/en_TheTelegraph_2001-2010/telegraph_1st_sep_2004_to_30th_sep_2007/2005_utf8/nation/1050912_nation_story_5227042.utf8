 Docs sing to fight disease

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Sept. 11: The music to beat malaria is here. The disc to hold diabetes at bay is selling at record stores.

 Five specialist doctors from this city yesterday announced the launch of their band, The Medix. And they are willing to perform live.

 But dont expect the long hair, bizarre attire and airy gesticulations. With Biman Saikia, Raman Abrol, Anurag Sharma, Sahul Bharti and Hemant Hardikar ? postgraduates in pathology, ENT, urology, paediatrics and cardiology ? its all about substance. 

 What they are looking to rock is complacency and ignorance: about AIDS and female foeticide, drug addiction and iron-deficiency anaemia.

 People are not interested in lectures and boring awareness campaigns, Sharma said. Songs are a good medium to reach out to them.

 So, heres to Zinda nahin chhodenge AIDS ke lakshan and Sada khao iodine namak.

 The doctors yesterday released their first disc, Prayas, containing eight songs, all written and sung by them. If Abrol, ENT surgeon and accomplished singer, was the albums producer, Bharti was the inspiration and lyricist.

 The paediatrician had tried out the idea in the remote mountain hamlets of Himachal Pradesh, where he used to treat patients free. He discovered that the villagers accepted his advice more readily when he set them to tune.

 They found the message easy to grasp and interesting. That was when I thought of replicating the experiment by composing songs that would appeal to the masses, Bharti said.

 For us, this is nothing short of a mission, declared Abrol.

 The doctors havent forgotten their patients, though, insisted Saikia, an MD in pathology. Well keep treating them.

 Theyll, however, continue to write their prescriptions the ordinary way ? in boring prose.

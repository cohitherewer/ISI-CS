 Explosives in Rajdhani way

 OUR BUREAU

 Dhanbad, June 17: Minutes before the New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express from Howrah would have crossed the Chaudhribandh railway station, 55 km from Dhanbad, a tip-off from an undisclosed source alerted railway police to explosives planted on the track near the outer signal. The alert averted a possible disaster on Thursday evening.

 The Howrah Rajdhani remained stranded at Gomoh from 8.24 pm to 2.03 am, while the Sealdah Rajdhani was detained at Dhanbad from 8.28 pm to 2.18 am. Following refusal of the Giridih district police to drive to the spot at night, two patrol engines were mobilised and rushed to the spot.

 Jharkhand Armed Police and Central Reserve Police Force jawans joined the Railway Protection Force. Around midnight, they reached the spot and found a cylinder on the track, packed with explosives weighing around 15 kg. It was connected to a 200-metre wire and four dry cells.

 The explosives were possibly placed around 8 pm since 9149 Up Dhanbad-Ahmedabad Express had crossed Chaudhribandh at 7.35 pm, while Varanasi-Asansol passenger passed safely at 8.05 pm.

 The railway control room at Dhanbad recorded the first information at 8.03 pm. The divisional security commissioner, S.R. Gandhi, claimed the alert had come from B.K. Pandey, DIG, Coalfields, who refused to divulge his source. 

 A section of railway officials said extremists possibly did not intend to damage the Rajdhani but planted the explosives and alerted the railways themselves to make their presence felt.

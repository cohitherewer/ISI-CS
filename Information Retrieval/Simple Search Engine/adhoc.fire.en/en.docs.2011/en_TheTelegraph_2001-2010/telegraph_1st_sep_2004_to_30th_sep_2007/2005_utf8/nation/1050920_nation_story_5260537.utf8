 Monday blues for Delhi schools

 New Delhi (PTI): Every Monday will now be exam time for students of Delhi government schools.

 Under a new continuous evaluation system, students of classes V to VIII will have to sit for weekly tests every Monday. The performance of students in the tests would be added to the results of the final examination.

 The new system will ensure constant academic interest in the students as well as lead to teachers also being more regular, education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said.

 He said the system would reduce stress on children. If the children are tested on a weekly basis, they will be thorough with lessons all the year round rather than study just once before the exams.

 Speaking about the introduction of online admission to government schools from this year, Lovely said of the 70,000 extra admissions, 35,000 were girls. 

 HC turns down Salman plea

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has rejected 

 actor Salman Khans plea for an in-camera trial in 

 the hit-and-run case, in which he is accused of killing 

 one and injuring four.

 Salman had initially pleaded for holding the entire trial in-camera, but later changed his plea to in-camera deposition of only the main witness, constable Ravindra Patil.

 The deposition of Patil, who was then Salmans bodyguard, is considered significant because he had accompanied the actor when his car rammed into a bakery in suburban Bandra in 2002.

 The court, however, has stayed its order for five weeks to allow Salman to file an appeal in the Supreme Court. 

 Malay status

 Kuala lumpur (PTI): Indian-origin Muslims 

 have urged the Malaysian government to accord them the status 

 of Malays, which could give them preferential treatment 

 in getting government jobs and setting up businesses.

 Indian Muslim Congress, a party representing the community, in a resolution submitted to the government, demanded the status for more than 400,000 Indian Muslims born there.

 Girl shot dead

 Chandigarh (PTI): A girl was shot dead 

 by an unidentified assailant at her house in Rajeev Nagar 

 locality of Gurgaon on Monday. Two persons came on a motorcycle 

 to her house and one of them shot her. The Kurukshetra University 

 student was believed to be alone in the house during the 

 incident, a neighbour told police.

 Trader robbed

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): Armed robbers looted 

 Rs 150,000 from a petrol pump owner on Jansath-Muzaffarnagar 

 Road here, police said on Monday. Pratish Kumar was attacked 

 while he was going to deposit the cash in a bank. 

A group of NRI software professionals has launched a website for Indian car buyers. The site, www.autoindia.com, provides details on various vehicles and links with insurance and credit firms.

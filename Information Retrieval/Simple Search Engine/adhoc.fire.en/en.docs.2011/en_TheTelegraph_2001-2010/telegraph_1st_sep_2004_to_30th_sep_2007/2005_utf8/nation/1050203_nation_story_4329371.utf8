 Patna, Feb. 2: This is one election nobody wants to bet on. 

 As 64 of the 243 seats in Bihar go to polls in the first phase tomorrow, signs of nervousness are visible in all three major camps ? the Rashtriya Janata Dal, National Democratic Alliance and the Congress-Lok Janshakti Party combine. The stakes are high for Laloo Prasad Yadav, who is trying to do a Jyoti Basu in the state.

 Even as most pollsters predict between 90 and 100 seats for the RJD as against the 122 majority mark, a desperate BJP today, though unofficially, projected senior Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar as the NDA?s candidate for the post of chief minister. 

 The development has baffled political observers because though Kumar, if projected CM, could garner non-Yadav OBC votes, the upper castes may not back him. But BJP sources said the upper castes here have been backing the BJP for the past few years and the OBC votes could considerably improve its electoral tally. 

 BJP national vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi, who himself was a chief ministerial candidate earlier, today said Nitish should occupy the hot seat in Bihar. Calling it his ?personal view?, Modi said, ?Kumar is the natural leader of the NDA.? 

 The BJP is contesting only 105 seats while 138 have been left for the JD(U). 

 The belated move by the BJP, which was jittery in the beginning of the campaigning, is considered a tactical one to woo non-Yadav OBC voters. Seeing some resentment among Muslims and rebellion among a section of Yadavs against the RJD chief, the NDA is making concerted efforts to turn the tables on Laloo Prasad.

 BJP poll managers said they would redraw their strategy, if required, depending on the voting pattern tomorrow. They are eagerly waiting to see if there is any crack in the Muslim-Yadav combine of the RJD. 

 Fearing a shift in its upper caste base to the LJP-Congress combine, the BJP has launched an attack on Ram Vilas Paswan and the Congress also. Modi today told newspersons that Paswan is enacting a drama and after the elections he will again join hands with Laloo Prasad. He also accused Congress of trying to fool voters. She is neither opposing nor supporting the RJD in her election speeches, he said. 

 Paswan has adopted a strategy of fielding Yadavs in Muslim-dominated RJD strongholds while fielding Muslims in Yadav-dominated areas to make a dent in the RJD?s M-Y combine.

 While the NDA?s confidence level has soared in the past few days, the smile was back on Laloo Prasad?s face with the recovery of two abducted students on the eve of elections. 

 The Opposition has of late used the abduction issue to target the ruling RJD in poll rallies.

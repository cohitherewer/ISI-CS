 Hope of life in debris dwindles

 Muzaffarabad, Oct. 11 (Reuters): Hope was dwindling today of finding survivors among the thousands buried under houses, offices and schools in Pakistan and the two Kashmirs, devastated by a killer earthquake three days ago.

 As the scale of the humanitarian crisis dawned on Pakistan, President Pervez Musharrafs government sought more international support for a disaster that officials in the worst-hit areas say may have claimed up to 40,000 lives.

 The US has pledged an initial $50 million for emergency aid. Several transport aircraft have been sent with relief supplies, heavy equipment and a humanitarian co-ordination team and further flights were due to arrive today.

 European nations, Japan and Arab states in the Gulf also stepped forward with similar offers of support.

 The official death toll remained at 21,000, although officials in Pakistan Kashmir and North West Frontier Province, areas that bore the brunt of Saturdays 7.6-magnitude quake, suggested it could be almost twice as high.

 Another 2,000 may have died in India and the fate of about 10,000 people living in remote villages on the border with Pakistan was unknown, Indian officials said.

 We are still looking for bodies in the debris, said A.M. Khandy, a deputy commissioner in Indian Kashmir. It is a calamity that is overwhelming our resources.

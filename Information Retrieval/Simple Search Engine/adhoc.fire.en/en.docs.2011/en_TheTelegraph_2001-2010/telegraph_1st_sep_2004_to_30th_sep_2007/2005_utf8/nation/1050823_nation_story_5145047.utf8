 Islamabad, Aug. 22: The Indian government is awaiting the response of Islamabad to a request for consular access to Manjeet Singh and other prisoners completing their terms in Pakistans jails.

 We await the response on our request that was made much long go, said an Indian diplomat in Islamabad. 

 However, Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson Naeem Khan has said he is unaware of any formal exchange between New Delhi and Islamabad on Manjeet.

 Manjeet, suspected by the Pakistan government to be a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent, was convicted by an anti-terror court. 

 The death sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court here. He was also convicted for being involved in five bombings in Pakistans Punjab province. 

 Spokesperson Khan today said: I have seen reports on the issue but am not aware if the Indian government has formally approached Pakistan or not. 

 Appealing to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistans President General Pervez Musharraf for clemency, Manjeets family, including sister Dalbir Kaur, claimed the mans actual name is Sarabjit Singh and he is innocent.

 In her appeal to Musharraf, Kaur said her brother was a victim of animosity between the two countries.

 RAW sources also denied that the man was an agent and said he is actually Sarabjit Singh of Bhikiwind village, like his family claims. 

 Naeem Khan, however, confirmed that Pakistan is only looking into a request by Delhi seeking the release of 450 other Indians in different Pakistani jails. 

 We received the request just recently, he said, adding that Pakistan also hopes India will provide consular access to its 222 nationals who are completing their terms in different Indian jails. 

 A report, issued by the foreign office early this month said there are about 611 Pakistani prisoners in India of which 389 have already been provided consular access. It said the countrys interior ministry has been able to confirm the identity of only 173 out of 389 prisoners.

 Last December, the two nations had reached an agreement for the early release of prisoners held by either side. 

 Centre to raise issue

 The Centre today said it would sound Pakistan on Sarabjit Singhs death sentence and try to secure his release, reports our special correspondent from New Delhi.

 Junior parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Pachauri said he would convey MPs strong emotional reactions to foreign minister Natwar Singh and request him to take up the matter with Pakistan.

 The assurance came after S.S. Ahluwalia of the BJP raised the matter in the Rajya Sabha. Speaking emotionally of Sarabjits family, he exhorted members to lend full support to secure his release.

 Sarabjits family has been saying that he strayed across the Line of Control under the influence of liquor in August 1990.

 This is a pure case of mistaken identity which has been proved beyond point by the distressed family of Sarabjit Singh. Recently, a film Veer-Zaara was made on this issue but it is now happening in real life.

 We, through Parliament, should demand not only Sarabjit Singhs release but also the release of 550 Indians who are languishing in Pakistani jails, Ahluwalia said.

 The motion found support from members cutting across party lines. 

 Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat demanded that information on the number of people languishing in Pakistani jails be tabled in the House.

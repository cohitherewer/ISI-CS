 Foster parents drown HIV baby

 Hyderabad: A couple threw their 10-month-old 

 adopted son into a well, suspecting the infant of being 

 HIV-positive, reports our special correspondent.

 The incident occurred at Gorripudi village, 535 km south-east of Hyderabad, in the tobacco- and rice-growing East Godavari district on Sunday.

 Subramanyam, a tobacco farmer, had adopted the boy from a local orphanage after his wife Kumari delivered their third daughter last fortnight.

 The couple tied the baby to a stone and drowned him in a village well on Sunday night, said district police superintendent Navin Chand.

 Asked what made the couple think the baby was infected with HIV, Chand said villagers comments on the sickly-looking and low-weight adopted boy had planted the thorn of suspicion.

 Police have detained the couple for questioning.

 No lawyer nuns: Bar council

 Thiruvananthapuram: Nuns and priests 

 cannot be allowed to enrol as lawyers as they are fully 

 engaged in religious work, the Bar Council of India and 

 the Kerala Bar Council have told Kerala High Court, reports

 The Bar Council of India and the state council were responding to court notices on petitions by two nuns and a priest against the Kerala Bar Enrolment Committees refusal to admit them into the legal profession.

 The matter has been a hot topic of debate in Kerala after the committee refused to accept the enrolment application filed by Sister Teena Jose, a 52-year-old nun of the Little Flower Convent at Cherthala in Alappuzha district.

 V.K. Diwan and 13 others but no one was arrested.

 Naxalite killing

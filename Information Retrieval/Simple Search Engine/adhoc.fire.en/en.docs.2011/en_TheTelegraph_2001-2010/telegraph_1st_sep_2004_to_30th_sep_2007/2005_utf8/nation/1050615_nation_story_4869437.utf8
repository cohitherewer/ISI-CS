 PM to reach out to Dhaka

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, June 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will take the initiative to restore Indias relations with Bangladesh on an even keel.

 A source close to Singh said the first step would be to invite Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to India for bilateral talks before the Saarc summit due in November.

 The source said the idea was to create a more friendly environment for the Saarc summit than what exists now.

 The decision to reach out to Bangladesh stems from two perceptions. 

 One, there has been significant improvement in Indias relations with neighbours, including Pakistan, China, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Myanmar and even Nepal over the past year.

 But with Bangladesh, the PM felt there was inadequate engagement at the top, the source said.

 Two, the Prime Minister feels that you can choose your friends but not your neighbours.

 After taking charge, Singh has had meetings with the Bhutan king; the President, Prime Minister and foreign minister of Sri Lanka; Myanmar military ruler Senior General Than Shwe; and even the Nepal king.

 Indeed with Nepal, there was a special effort to see there was stability in a complex relationship and to ensure neither side (the monarchy and the political parties) hijacked India.

 Bangladesh is the only country with which no significant engagement has been made, the source said.

 With Singh showing the green signal, the foreign ministry is expected to do the spadework for Khaleda Zias visit.

 The last time Singh met the Bangladesh Prime Minister was on the sidelines of the Bimstec meet in Bangkok in September. After that there was no engagement in any serious dialogue with Bangladesh, the source said.

 The assessment in South Block is that despite the host of problems in India-Bangladesh relations, they are not intractable. When the Saarc summit was put off in February after a political leader was killed, the decision had a personal impact on Singh because Shah A.M.S. Kibria was a close friend.

 Singh is of the view that bilateral relations should be seen in the right perspective and it is time to review the positive and negative aspects.

 South Blocks feedback is that Bangladesh has more or less ceased to be a sanctuary for North-eastern insurgent groups, including Ulfa. But the fact that the Northeast is hemmed in by Bangladesh cannot be overlooked.

 In Indias view, the other roadblocks are:

 Illegal immigration

 Arms smuggling

 Trafficking of fake Indian currency notes

 Border firing within 150 yards of the zero line at certain places

 Lack of implementation of land border agreement and coordination and joint patrolling along the border

 River-water sharing and river-linking project

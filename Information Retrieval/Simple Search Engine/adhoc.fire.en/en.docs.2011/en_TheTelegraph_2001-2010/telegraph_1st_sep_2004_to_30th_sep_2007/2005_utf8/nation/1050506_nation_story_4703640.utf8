 3 killed in Assam Rifles goofup

 imphal: The 

 Assam Rifles landed in the midst of yet another controversy 

 in Manipur on Thursday, after personnel of the paramilitary 

 force shot dead three civilians by mistake. 

 Three members of a Kuki family ? two women and a child ? were killed when soldiers of the paramilitary force opened fire at Saitu village under Kangpokpi police station in Senapati district on Thursday morning. 

 Assam Rifles claimed that the civilians were killed in a crossfire during an encounter with militants. 

 But the villagers maintained that the killing took place when they were holding a meeting related to the election of the village council, police sources said. 

 The police confirmed that immediately after the incident, the commanding officer of the Assam Rifles unit, Govinda, rushed to the village to apologise to the villagers. He admitted that his ?boys made a mistake?. The jawans are also reported to have apologised to the villagers. 

 The police said quoting villagers that personnel of the 14 Assam Rifles, based at Lairouching, went to the village in a Maruti Gypsy while the meeting was going on. The securitymen then opened fire without any provocation, apparently mistaking the villagers for militants. 

 Frightened by the gunshots, some of the villagers jumped into a shallow pond nearby to hide from the security personnel. But one of the soldiers chased the fleeing villagers to the pond. He allegedly shot two women and a child despite their pleas not to open fire. 

 Court bans polls in varsities

 Jaipur (PTI): 

 Rajasthan High Court has directed the state government to 

 ban elections to the unions of students, teachers and employees 

 in educational institutions, including universities.

 A division bench of Justices K.S. Rathore and S.K. Sharma asked the government to issue the necessary notification immediately.

 The ban was ordered following a writ petition filed by R.D. Gurjar, which said students indiscipline, teachers absence from classes and political interference from outside were all a fallout of the elections.

 Expressing concern over the declining academic standards because of politics on campus, the court said there should be no elections to the students unions. It suggested that students with maximum marks in examinations could be nominated members of student bodies and they could choose all the office-bearers.

 The judges said the elections to the teachers unions would not be held and asked the government to bring in amendments to the Rajasthan University Act, 1949.

 Bookie in net

 Mumbai, May 17: Cricket bookie Shobhan Mehta alias Shobhan Kalachowkie was today taken into custody by Mumbai police after a court rejected his anticipatory bail application.

 The police had launched a manhunt for Mehta in connection with alleged misuse of telephone lines by Ramesh Shah at Grant Road. 

 Investigations revealed that Mumbais cricket bookies used Shahs telephone lines to place bets and organise hawala transactions. Shah would rent out the telephone lines for Rs 1,000 a day. The investigations led the police to bookies Nemichand Jain and Mehta.

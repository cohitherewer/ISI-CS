 Chetan success on maiden flight

 Bangalore (PTI): Chetan, the re-engined 

 Chetak helicopter, successfully made its first flight 

 on Tuesday. State-run aircraft maker Hindustan Aeronautics 

 Ltd (HAL) also sought to upgrade nearly 200 Chetak 

 helicopters used by the armed forces and the civilian sector.

 Chetan has been fitted with a powerful Snecma TM 333 2b2 engine that powers Dhruv, the advanced light helicopter, and is an upgraded version of HAL?s workhorse Chetak, the company chairman, A.K. Baweja told reporters after the 20-minute sortie.

 Chetan was flown over Bangalore by project test pilot, wing commander P.S. Rao, and test engineer, squadron leader S. Jain, he said.

 Union defence secretary (defence production) Shekar Dutt said the helicopter offered better fuel efficiency and could be flown at higher altitude for rescue and evacuation purposes.

 HAL began the Chetan project six months ago by investing Rs 9 crore and it received impetus after the Cheetal helicopter (the re-engined Cheetah) created a world record by landing at an altitude of 25,150 feet on Saser Kangi peak, next to Siachen glacier, Baweja said.

 Chetan will be displayed at the Aero India Air Show later this month, he added.

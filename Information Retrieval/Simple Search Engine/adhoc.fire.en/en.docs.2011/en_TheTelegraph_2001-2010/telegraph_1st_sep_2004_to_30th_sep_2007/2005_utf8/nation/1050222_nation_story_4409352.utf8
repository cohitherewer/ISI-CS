 Foul play slur on officials

 Trouble on polling day is common in Gaya. (PTI)

 Gaya, Feb. 21: Almost 20 days have passed since Gaya went to polls on February 3, but there seems to be no end to complaints of largescale irregularities, including manipulation of records, in the district.

 Repolling has been held at more than 300 booths in the district and if fresh allegations of officials fudging records for the benefit of some candidates is taken at face value, more repolls will have to be conducted, feel political observers.

 One of the most common complaints pertain to discrepancies on voters? lists supplied to poll officials and political parties. At a large number of polling stations, names of voters were struck off and no explanation was given for the removals. 

 Even Gaya MP Rajesh Manjhi could not exercise his franchise as his name was removed from the voters? list in a similar fashion.

 When the matter was raised with district magistrate Chaitanya Prasad, he said the names could be found on lists put up at the auxiliary booths. But there was no one at the originalbooths to inform voters, who had no idea about the auxiliary booths, of the change.

 According to the poll panel?s guidelines, scrutiny of documents was to take place with respect to all booths, which registered more than 70 per cent. polling. But in order to hoodwink the commission, several officials reported less than 70 per cent polling, while the actual figure was much higher. Such complaints have poured in from several constituencies, including Atri, Konch, Gurua and Belaganj.

 In his written complaint to the commission, Mahesh Singh, a candidate from Konch, gave four examples to justify his contention that poll officials manipulated statistics to serve the interests of another nominee. 

 According to the complaint, 80.13 per cent polling took place at the Badgaon Primary School polling station. But, in his report, the presiding officer mentioned that the turnout was only 68.48 per cent to escape the commission?s scrutiny, Singh alleged. The complaint further said similar manipulations took place at polling stations 21, 67 and 90.

 Reacting to the allegations, DM Prasad said the commission has sought a status report in this regard. But he refused to divulge the contents of the report or the seriousness of the problem.

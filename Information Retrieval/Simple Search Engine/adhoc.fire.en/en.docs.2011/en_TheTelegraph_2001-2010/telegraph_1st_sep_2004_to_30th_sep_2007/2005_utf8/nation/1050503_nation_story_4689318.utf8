 Azad?s apricots come a cropper 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 2: Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad resorted to diplomacy of a unique kind to persuade NDA leaders to call off their boycott of Parliament. 

 He sent boxes of freshly-plucked apricots from his garden to the leaders and deputy leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, L.K. Advani, V.K. Malhotra, Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj and other NDA representatives. When they phoned to thank him for the ?surprise gift?, BJP sources said Azad politely urged them to return to the House.

 But the NDA was only partially taken in by the gesture. It decided it would not attend either House today except to be present when the finance bill is passed this evening in the Lok Sabha.

 A 90-minute meeting of the NDA, chaired by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, proposed to hold another sitting after the bill was passed and concluded that unless there was a ?perceptible? change in the UPA?s attitude towards the Opposition, the boycott will continue. But a section of the NDA MPs felt the boycott was ?counter-productive? and that questions were being asked in their constituencies as to why they were sent to Parliament in the first place. 

 NDA sources said a perception was gaining ground that the boycott serves two purposes: to ?shield? former defence minister George Fernandes from the embarrassment of answering queries on his alleged implication in some defence deals going back to the NDA regime, and to gloss over the cracks in the Sangh parivar after RSS supremo K.S. Sudarshan raised questions about the BJP?s ?ageing? leadership.

 Another NDA meeting will be held tomorrow to take a final view on the boycott. Sources admitted that a ?face-saver? was what they direly needed.

 Although the original provocation for the move was the framing of charges against railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav in a fodder scam case, the NDA found a new reason for persisting with the boycott. It blamed the government for its ?behaviour and attitude towards the Opposition?.

 A resolution adopted by the NDA said, from the start, the government has treated the Opposition as its ?enemy rather than as a necessary part of the parliamentary process?. 

 ?We had stated on April 27 that neither the norms of political conduct nor the undemocratic and petty-minded approach of this government towards the Opposition were acceptable to the NDA,? it said.

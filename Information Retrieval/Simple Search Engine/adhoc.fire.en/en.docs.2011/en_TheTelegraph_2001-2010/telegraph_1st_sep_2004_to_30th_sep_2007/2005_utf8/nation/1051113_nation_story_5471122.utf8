 Handover terms in legal tangle

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: The conditions on which Abu Salem has been extradited from Portugal have triggered a judicial conflict.

 The Indian Interpol had agreed that Salem would not be sentenced to death and if given life imprisonment, it should not be for more than 25 years. But in India, life sentence means life in jail according to a series of Supreme Court judgments. So if the dons sentence is restricted to 25 years, it would violate these judgments.

 Legal experts said the conditions could paralyse trial proceedings.

 Rajeev Dhawan, a counsel of the apex court who has prepared a research paper for the UN on death penalty in extradition cases, said India cannot resile from the condition imposed and Portugal was well within its right to impose such conditions when it extradited the don.

 Dhawan said extradition law is based on commonality of understanding between two or more sovereign nations. We have extradition law to that effect ? to respect the conditions of a sovereign nation extraditing a wanted in a criminal trial.

 But another view is that once extradited, a person has to be tried in accordance with the law of the country to which he is sent for trial.

 For example, in India, if there is death penalty for a particular type of crime, it cannot say while extraditing a person to another country where there is no capital punishment at all, that only death sentence should be imposed on the person extradited, said a senior counsel who did not want to be named. That country would proceed in accordance with its own law.

 Dhawan countered this point by citing an extradition law Parliament has enacted. According to the law, he said, if a person whose crime deserves capital punishment in India has to be sent for trial in another country which does not have death penalty, then it is not necessary to impose the condition that extradition would be done only if death penalty is imposed.

 The idea, he added, is not to be so bloodthirsty.

 Dhawan argued that the conditions for extraditing Salem should be respected because, otherwise, no country would extradite any person for trial in India and the accused, too, would cite this example to argue that India does not respect the conditions of extradition and that he or she should not be extradited.

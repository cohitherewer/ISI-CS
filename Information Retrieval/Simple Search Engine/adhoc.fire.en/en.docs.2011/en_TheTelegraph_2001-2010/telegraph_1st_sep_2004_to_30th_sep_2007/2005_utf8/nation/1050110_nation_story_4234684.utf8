 Paswan wait delays BJP list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The BJP and ally Janata Dal (United) deferred the release of their first list for the Bihar Assembly polls today, amid whispers that they were still trying to woo Ram Vilas Paswan.

 The list is expected to be out on Tuesday when the Congress and the RJD ? deadlocked over seat-sharing ? are expected to finalise their candidates. Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, too, has not released its list.

 BJP sources, however, maintained that the postponement was due to ?minor? differences with the Dal (U) over seat-sharing and could be sorted out in a day or two. Party general secretary Shivraj Singh Chauhan denied that the release was delayed as Dal (U) leader Nitish Kumar was trying to rope in the LJP.

 The party has announced its candidates for all 90 seats in Haryana, where it will fight alone, and the remaining 13 seats in Jharkhand.

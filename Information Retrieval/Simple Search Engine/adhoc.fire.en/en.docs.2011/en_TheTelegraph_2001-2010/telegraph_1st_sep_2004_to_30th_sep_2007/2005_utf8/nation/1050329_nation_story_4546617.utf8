 Fresh probe into Jenny case

 Dehra Dun, March 28 (PTI): The N.D. Tiwari government in Uttaranchal today announced a fresh inquiry into the Jenny scandal to pacify disgruntled Congress MLAs, hours after they announced that they will meet the high command to press for a decision on the leadership issue.

 ?A petition of Harak Singh Rawat is pending before the court of special judicial magistrate (on the Jenny issue). All those aspects, which are not covered by the court, will be inquired into,? state parliamentary minister Indira Hridayesh told the House. 

 Rawat, a former revenue minister, was accused of being the father of the child of Jenny, an unwed mother from Assam, but was exonerated by the CBI in the case.

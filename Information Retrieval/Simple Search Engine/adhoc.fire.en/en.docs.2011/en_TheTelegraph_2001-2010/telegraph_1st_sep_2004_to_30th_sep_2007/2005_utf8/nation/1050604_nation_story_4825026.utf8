The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Petrol protest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 3: The CPM politburo today decided to launch a nationwide movement against the Congress-led government if it increased the prices of petrol and diesel, ignoring the partys appeal against the move. 

 The politburo, which met at the partys Bengal headquarters, felt that a revision would affect the common people and should, therefore, be opposed by the CPM.

 General secretary Prakash Karat said the agitation would force the government not to implement the proposed price rise. Asked if the party would pull out if the government refused to fall in line, Karat said: The question of withdrawing support does not arise. We want this government to continue for the full five-year term by honouring the CMP (common minimum programme). 

 The partys central committee will meet for two days from tomorrow where the issue will be discussed.

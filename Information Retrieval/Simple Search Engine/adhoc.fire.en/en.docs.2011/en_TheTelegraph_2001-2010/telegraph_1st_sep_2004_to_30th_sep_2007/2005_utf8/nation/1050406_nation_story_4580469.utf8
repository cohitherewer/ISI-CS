 Left legends go on ?trial?

 New Delhi, April 5: Over the next few days, the CPM will sit in judgement over its ?living legends?.

 Harkishen Singh Surjeet is likely to remain in the party?s politburo even after quitting as general secretary. But a question mark lingers on whether the CPM will grant Jyoti Basu his request to retire from the party?s apex policy-making body.

 ?The party congress will decide how these two leaders can continue to remain associated with the party,? politburo member Sitaram Yechury told reporters a day before the CPM?s 18th congress begins here. 

 Yechury said Surjeet and Basu are ?living legends? of the party, and the CPM as well as the country can benefit from their experience. ?They are scientific communists and have been saying for a long time that they cannot discharge their duties in the way they did before because of age.?

 It is now almost certain that the 87-year-old Surjeet, who wants to step down as general secretary, will give way to the next generation of leaders at the congress. Prakash Karat is set to be the fourth general secretary of the CPM after P. Sandarayya, E.M.S. Namboodiripad and Surjeet. The question before the party congress is whether both Basu, who is 91, and Surjeet will continue to be part of the highest body of the CPM. ?The central committee of the party will take a decision,? Yechury said.

 In Bengal, state committee leaders have already started protesting Basu?s move to retire from the politburo. Similar protests had earlier forced the former chief minister to continue in office for 24 years despite his age and ill health.

 Yechury indicated that the CPM would like both leaders to continue in the politburo because it is at this forum where the CPM leadership gets to know all the ?nuances? of political developments. 

 Asked why the leaders have to remain in the politburo to contribute to the party, he said: ?You can make a contribution even outside the politburo. But you are seized of all the nuances of political developments if you are in the politburo.?

 Surjeet, who for decades has been the CPM?s public face at the Centre, still regularly attends UPA-Left coordination committee meetings despite failing health. The party would still like to have him ? even as a figurehead in the politburo along with Basu.

 The party congress will end next Monday after it elects a new politburo and a central committee. The politburo at present has 16 members and the central committee 84.

 Buddha in Bangla blast

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 23: Saying that the two Bengals are finding it difficult to understand each others Bengali, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today talked tough to express concern at infiltration from Bangladesh and warn of demographic changes.

 In some pockets, he said, Bangladeshis were outnumbering Indians. We cannot allow such infiltration. Enough is enough, Bhattacharjee added, expressing his frustration at the way Bangladesh was reacting to the problem.

 He was addressing a meeting on human rights organised by the BSF at an auditorium in the National Library complex in Calcutta. 

 The Bangladeshi official position is that there are no Bangladeshis here. How is that possible when we are sending so many to the prisons everyday? he asked.

 Also, there are the Islamic fundamentalist groups in Bangladesh recruiting jihadis, and they are sending their fundamentalist leaders to campaign in places like Kashmir? and they are carrying explosives from Bangladesh to here. On the other hand, militants from the Ulfa and KLO (the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation) are taking shelter in Bangladesh, the chief minister said.

 Bhattacharjee said that when he recently told the Bangladeshi foreign minister that the top leader of the KLO was in Dhaka, he expressed surprise. I told him how it was possible that I knew he is there. I know his phone number and address and he did not know about it. I also said that both of us might be speaking in Bengali but we cant understand each others language. 

 Bhattacharjee asked the BSF to push for more force for manning the border. Things are hotting up in the eastern part of the country along Bangladesh, he said.

 We are trying to fence our border. Till now 50 per cent of the fencing job has been completed and we need more funds and want fences all along the border, the chief minister said.

 Asking the BSF to be more humane and kind, Bhattacharjee said: Sometimes the villagers are unnecessarily harassed. That is why we are thinking of offering them ID cards. You have to cooperate with the farmers and other villagers. The BSF jawans must have a harmonious relation with the local people, otherwise you cannot survive.

 You have to earn the confidence of the local people. Language is also a problem. But BSF inspector-general R.K. Pachnanda has assured us that they would get classes in Bengali. Bengali is not a difficult language to learn, he added.

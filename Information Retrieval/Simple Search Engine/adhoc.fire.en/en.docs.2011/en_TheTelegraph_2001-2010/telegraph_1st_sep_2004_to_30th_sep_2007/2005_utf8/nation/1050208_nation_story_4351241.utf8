 Pizza bad taste for visa policy

 Sgro: Bias slur

 Calgary, Feb. 7: An Indian Sikh, at the centre of a political scandal in Canada which forced the country?s immigration minister to resign, may prompt changes in Canada?s liberal refugee policy that are considered here as long overdue.

 Harjit Singh?s allegation that immigration minister Judy Sgro agreed to let him stay in Canada in exchange for free pizzas and Indo-Canadian campaign volunteers during her election campaign last summer forced the minister to resign from Prime Minister Paul Martin?s cabinet last month.

 Singh was deported to India last week, but will continue to be in the news here because Sgro has filed a Canadian $750,000 lawsuit against him alleging libel.

 His allegation against Sgro was the last straw for those in this country who have zero tolerance for corruption in public life.

 The minister was earlier accused of unfairly sanctioning a work permit for a Romanian stripper, Alina Balaican, enabling her to stay in Canada after Balaican campaigned for Sgro?s election and made a contribution to her election fund.

 Canada?s federal ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro is currently investigating allegations that Sgro?s chief of staff, Ihor Wons, conducted immigration business in her campaign office and went to a strip club to discuss immigration issues with owners of the club.

 Nude dancing clubs routinely employ strippers who are illegal immigrants at low wages and are often willing to pay bribes for the authorities to look the other way while club owners profit from violations of immigration rules.

 Sgro has already admitted in court documents that Wons met Singh during her poll campaign and that the Indian, who owns a pizzeria on the outskirts of Toronto, provided free pizzas for her campaign.

 If allegations against Sgro are of the kind that make political arenas sizzle, the story of Singh is the stuff that lends credence to charges that Canada?s immigration and refugee processing is a scandal.

 Singh, who was principal of a private college in Punjab, and his wife, Satinder Bir Kaur, arrived in Toronto on March 5, 1988, on three-month visitor?s visas. On May 6 that year, they sought asylum in Canada.

 Singh claimed out of the blue that he had been tortured by Indian police for speaking out against the government.

 But the vagaries of Canadian laws are such that although his claim was found not credible and was rejected, he managed to stay on in this country for 17 years while his claims went through further processing because of this country?s liberal refugee rules.

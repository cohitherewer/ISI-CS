 Dawood still out of reach

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: Diplomats and investigating agencies may have reasons to crow about their success in getting gangster Abu Salem extradited. But making Indias South Asian neighbours follow Portugals example is not likely to be so smooth.

 Salem and his companion Monica Bedi were handed over last night although India and Portugal do not have an extradition treaty. South Asian officials have often cited lack of this treaty as the main reason why their hands are tied.

 The details of what finally made Portugal give up the gangster is not known yet, but the move clearly is a culmination of the painstaking efforts by Indias diplomats and officials of investigating agencies over the past few years.

 South Block officials admitted that it would be difficult to ask either Pakistan or Bangladesh to hand over the likes of Dawood Ibrahim and Anup Chetia, who are on the list of Indias most wanted. Many neighbouring countries feel that by supporting Indian terrorists, they would be able to engage meaningfully with Delhi.

 There are indications to suggest that Portugal, too, had its fair share of worries before it agreed to hand over Salem. 

 Officials in Delhi pointed out that despite Indias repeated requests, Portugal had all along resisted signing an extradition treaty. The recent terrorist attacks in Madrid and London, which brought Europe on the al Qaida radar, might have helped Lisbon in making up its mind. But there is little doubt that the Portuguese government was guided mainly by the merits and demerits of the Salem case and not by any major political consideration.

 For several years, India has been asking both Pakistan and Bangladesh to hand over Indian terrorists hiding there. But the two countries have flatly denied the rebels presence on their soil. Bangladesh has agreed to allow Indian teams to visit areas where Northeast terrorists are suspected to run their camps, but few in Delhi consider it a sincere effort.

 Even Bhutan, one of Indias closest allies, took more than a decade to act against the Bodo and Ulfa rebels, who had been camping in its jungles for years. 

 India has not been above board in this regard either. In the past, it has supported the LTTE when it was engaged in a fight with the Sri Lankan government. 

 A fundamental shift in Delhis policy on aiding terrorist groups came only after the Indian Peace Keeping Force was dragged into the battle and Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991, widely believed to be the handiwork of LTTE chief Prabhakaran.

 Till recently, India was also accused of allowing the Maoists in Nepal to cross over and find safe haven in the country, especially at a time when it was warring with the Royal Nepalese Army.

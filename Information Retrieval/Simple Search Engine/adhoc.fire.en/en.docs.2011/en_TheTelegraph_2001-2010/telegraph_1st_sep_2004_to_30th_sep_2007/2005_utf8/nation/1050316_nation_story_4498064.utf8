 Kher warrant on Surjeet

 Surjeet

 Mumbai, March 15: A magistrate?s court today issued a bailable warrant against CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet in a defamation suit filed against him by Anupam Kher.

 The actor claims that Surjeet had called him an ?RSS agent? in the party journal, People?s Democracy, saying Kher had ?saffronised? the censor board when he was its chairperson.

 The court today rejected the CPM leader?s plea for exemption from appearance personally as he was not in good health and issued the warrant as he had not appeared despite summons issued to him. Magistrate M.H. Belosay said Surjeet would have to furnish a surety of Rs 10,000 and be present in court on April 25. His plea for a stay on the order was also rejected.

 Surjeet?s lawyer Mohan Pungalia pleaded for his exemption on the ground that the veteran communist was not well and admitted to the Metro Hospital and Heart Institute in Delhi. He even produced a medical certificate of the hospital that said Surjeet was advised four weeks bed rest.

 But Kher?s lawyer Majeed Memon pressed on for the warrant, arguing that ?the medical certificate was vague as it did not mention the dates of admission and discharge of the patient?.

 He also observed that Surjeet was often seen on television and had also gone on a visit to Pakistan recently but seemed reluctant to come to court.

 In the witness box, Kher said Surjeet had not appeared for the second time while he was appearing regularly. He pleaded that in the interest of justice it was necessary for Surjeet to come and he should be compelled to appear in person. Outside, the actor said he was happy with the court?s decision to issue the warrant. He said he had faith in judiciary and hoped to get justice. 

 ?I shall continue to fight the legal battle,? Kher said.

 The actor was unceremoniously removed as chairman of the censor board on October 13 and had filed a criminal complaint in the magistrate?s court.

 ?I am an artist and do not belong to any party or ideology. Falsely linking me with any political organisation is a blot on my career,? he had said.

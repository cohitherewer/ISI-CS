 Oil pressure at bursting point

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 22: Public sector oil companies are likely to ask for another price review because of rocketing global prices of crude but political compulsions appear to outweigh economic logic. 

 With a restive Left and a belligerent BJP gearing up to take on the government in Parliaments monsoon session starting next week, the Centre does not seem to be politically in a position to accept the oil companies demand.

 The petroleum ministry headed by Mani Shankar Aiyar is supporting the companies and feels continuing losses suffered by them should lead to a price review. There is an apprehension that in these four weeks after the price rise, oil companies may have made cash losses.

 Yesterday, Aiyar met finance minister P. Chidambaram, who asked for specific numbers for the losses after the June 21 revision.

 The Rs 2.50 per litre hike in the price of petrol and Rs 2 for diesel was not enough to make up for the sharp increase in international crude prices. 

 Since crude oil accounts for as much as 90 per cent of the cost of production of petroleum products there is little that the oil companies can do to curtail costs once international prices rise. The price of the basket of crude India buys has now soared to $55.75 a barrel, which is $6 higher than the rate prevailing in June when the last revision took place. 

 This means petrol is currently under-priced by Rs 3 a litre and diesel is being sold at a loss of Rs 5.30 a litre.

 There is huge under-realisation and if these translate into cash losses, a review of fuel prices is a must, a petroleum ministry official said. 

 Oil refiners Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP are likely to report losses during the first quarter of 2005-06. Indian Oil is marginally better off. The burden on ONGC will get heavier.

 International oil prices rose even today.

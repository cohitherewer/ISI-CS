 Bachchan weaves a Russian dream

 Bachchan: Touched

Moscow, June 10 (PTI): 

 This could be the script for the next Bollywood version 

 of love-conquers-all.

 A poor, young Russian woman is desperate to travel to Mumbai to meet her Indian hero, whom she knows only from his pictures. To raise money for the trip, she starts peddling drugs ? and gets seven years in a Russian prison.

 Like a Bollywood movie, Alina Kovalyovas real-life story has a happy ending, though.

 As she suffers in jail, word reaches the man of her dreams, superstar Amitabh Bachchan, thousands of miles away. His heart melts and he invites the 30-year-old to visit him in Mumbai after her release, which is two years away.

 A 40-minute documentary, The Secrets of Bollywood, telecast last night on Russian state TV Rossia, narrated the plight of the woman from the small town of Syzran.

 Alina, why have you done so? You should have somehow contacted me and I would have arranged for your India visit to meet me, Bachchan said in a videotaped reply to his fan. After your release please try to contact me and I will arrange for your visit?.

 Amitabh, you must know you are the only man I have ever loved. I love you so much, Alina said in her message recorded in her cell.

 Cheating fury scalds teacher

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Jan. 8: A lecturer of a government junior college was severely assaulted by a group of men led by the brother of a student whom he had caught cheating in an examination.

 N. Yogi Babu, a lecturer in chemistry at a college in Rajendrangar on the outskirts of the state capital, was beaten black and blue by local municipal councillor Sridhar and his henchmen yesterday. Armed with chains and sticks, a 20-member group entered the college and began terrorising students and teachers.

 ?Where is the chemistry lecturer?? they kept asking everyone and beat up anyone who questioned their presence on the college premises. They even ransacked the lecturers? room and the library. When they finally traced the lecturer in one of the examination halls, they beat him up in the presence of other students.

 Sridhar?s brother Govind, an intermediate student, was caught cheating by the lecturer during the ongoing half-yearly examinations. Yogi Babu is said to have not only reported the matter to the authorities but had also beaten the 16-year-old with a scale in front of the other students.

 The police have arrested Sridhar and five persons. A search is on for the rest of the gang, police sources said.

 Sonia nudge clears job bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: Prodded by Sonia Gandhi, the cabinet tonight approved the National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill, apparently widening its ambit to include all rural families rather than only those living below the poverty line.

 The bill ? which will initially cover 150 most backward districts in the country ? will be tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy said. Every effort will be made to have it passed in the current session.

 Earlier, Sonia had told a workshop of the Congresss students wing, the National Students Union of India, that employment guarantee is the biggest challenge before the nation and the biggest work for the government.

 Last week, the Congress chief had ensured cabinet clearance for two bills, one giving women equal inheritance rights and the other providing them protection against domestic violence.

 The employment guarantee bill had been tabled in the winter session of 2004 but was then referred to a standing committee after the Left and the National Advisory Council, headed by Sonia, raised certain objections.

 The standing committee suggested that the minimum wage under the scheme be not less than 65 per cent of the national average, which is about Rs 65 per day.

 It also said panchayats should be the implementing agencies and the Centre should not have the power to arbitrarily withdraw the scheme without passing an Act of Parliament. These recommendations are believed to have been incorporated.

 The Left had suggested that 60 per cent of the wages be paid in cash and the remaining 40 per cent in foodgrain. The Centre should bear the burden of the cash payments and provide 75 per cent of the foodgrain, thus leaving states with only 10 per cent of the total expenditure.

 The cabinet also cleared a decision to increase the number of pilgrims covered by the Haj subsidy from 82,000 to 1 lakh from 2006. Reddy said the subsidy levels will also rise.

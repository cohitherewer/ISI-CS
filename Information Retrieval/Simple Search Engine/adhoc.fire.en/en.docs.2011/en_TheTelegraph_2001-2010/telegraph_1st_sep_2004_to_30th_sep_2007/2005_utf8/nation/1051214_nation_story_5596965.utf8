 BJP, govt spar over quota bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: The BJP wants the Centre to include unaided minority educational institutions in the constitutional amendment bill that is to be introduced in Parliament tomorrow. 

 The bill, once passed, will make it mandatory for private educational institutions to have a quota for Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribe students. The government, however, has decided to exclude minority institutions from the purview of the bill after talks with heads of such institutions. 

 The amendment bill is to counter a Supreme Court ruling exempting unaided private educational institutions from the responsibility of providing reservation for SC and ST students. 

 Minority institutions argue that they should be kept out of the quota bill as general category institutions do not have quotas for minority students. 

 But the BJP is not accepting the argument and has decided to move an amendment to the bill, which may delay its passage. 

 Soon after the Supreme Court exempted private unaided institutions from providing SC/ST quotas, human resource development minister Arjun Singh held all-party meetings. At that time, all the parties on the floor of Parliament asked the government to bring in a legislation that would restore the social balance. 

 But today, Union parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi accused the BJP of going back on its word to support the bill. He said that in an earlier meeting, BJP leaders Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj had assured their partys support to the bill.

 The ruling UPA could issue a whip for the amendment bill.

 The Left parties are backing it. They, too, do not want the bill to include minority educational institutions. 

 The government wants to pass the bill on Thursday.

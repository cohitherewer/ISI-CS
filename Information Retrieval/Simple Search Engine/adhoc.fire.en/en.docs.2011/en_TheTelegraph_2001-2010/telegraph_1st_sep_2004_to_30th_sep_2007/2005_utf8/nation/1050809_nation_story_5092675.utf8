 Colas fire caution retort

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Cola majors today pointed at faecal matter to challenge a Rajasthan High Court order directing them to print a caution label on every bottle that it contains pesticides.

 Milk sold in India has faecal matter, arsenic and organisms and materials worse than pesticides, the cola majors argued. Then should we not announce on every packet of milk that it contains faecal matter? a counsel for the cola majors asked the Supreme Court.

 Printing such a label would result in a reduction in sales, senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for Pepsi Cola, told the apex court.

 Every type of water we drink today in the country, the fruits and vegetables we consume have pesticides and materials worse than that?. Then why target only us? This has resulted in the loss of image (of India) in the international corporate world, Salve said.

 Every product manufactured in the country today using water has pesticides and pesticide residues and ordering the soft drink manufacturers alone to display pesticide content label would severely hamper their sales and is highly unfair, the senior counsel told a three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti, Justices C.K. Thakker and P.K. Balasubramanyan.

 The bench posted the hearing of the matter to August 25. 

 The judges made it clear that the matter of pesticides in cola was brought before the court and in case of similar matter being brought before it on other products, the court would certainly take it up. When it is not disputed and in fact an admitted fact that there is pesticide residue in soft drinks, then why not let the consumer know about it? they asked Salve.

 Senior counsel K.K. Venugopal, appearing for Coca-Cola, told the court that his client company would print the caution on every bottle but wanted it to hear him on points of law before deciding the issue.

 Rajasthan High Court had given two months to cola companies to comply with its order and the deadline for it ended on August 1. However, both Coca Cola and Pepsi challenged the order before the apex court and, without even getting a stay order from the Supreme Court, have not yet started printing details about the pesticide content in their products. 

 In its June 1 order, the high court had directed that the cola manufacturers could print either Soft drink does not contain pesticide residues or say Soft drink is safe. The level of pesticide residue is well within all applicable standards.

 The order had come on petitions by Santosh Mittal and Manju Surana who have also come before the Supreme Court seeking further directions that the cola companies should not only print the above declaration but also should reveal the percentage of pesticides and other lethal materials.

 Bypoll puts out Express protest fire

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, April 21: The Election Commission?s decision to go ahead and hold two Assembly byelections in Tamil Nadu on May 14 has resulted in the toning down of the protest against Kamal Hassan?s Mumbai Express.

 The Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), which as part of the Tamil Protection Committee spearheaded the agitation against the Manisha Koirala starrer, has decided to focus its energies on the byelections to the Kancheepuram and Gummudipoondi Assembly seats. 

 The DPI is contesting the two seats on its own ?to affirm our individual identity?.

 ?It (the protest against Mumbai Express) is not just against the title of one Tamil film or an English word used as part of it. Our movement is for the broader objective of the Tamil mass media, including cinema, respecting the need to have names only in Tamil to stem the deterioration in Tamil tradition and culture,? DPI leader Thirumavalavan said.

 ?It is the actor?s obduracy of sticking to his film title, despite fervent appeals by us and the PMK, which pained us most,? Thirumavalavan said.

 He went on to claim that the DPI had now created enough awareness among the people of Tamil Nadu and pointed out that three theatres in Salem have ?withdrawn? the screening of Mumbai Express.

 More pressing on the DPI?s agenda now are the two byelections, especially after the PMK led by S. Ramadoss had given up its protests against the film.

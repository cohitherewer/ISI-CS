 Mumbai, Dec. 30: The New Year, alas, is becoming increasingly difficult to cope with.

 The stress that goes into ushering in the New Year in style and surviving what precedes it has earned enough mass base to get a name: it is called the New Year Blues. It is a well-established phenomenon in the West, where it was invented when they couldnt decide when Christ was born exactly; now, with calendars this side of the world as chockful with New Year parties, Indians are badly infected, too.

 The greatest dread is being left alone. Loneliness is scary, especially when other people are partying, because that makes a loser face himself like no other time.

 In Mumbai, where so many of us are from another place and living without our families, I have to think of going to a party, says Arnab Roy, a call centre employee from Calcutta. It would be uncool, otherwise. But he will do it after work.

 Life is more complicated for the vast and ever-increasing body of young Indians participating in the market forces: the sales and marketing executives. Many of them may try to get themselves drunk silly just to get rid of six letters etched on their brain: T-A-R-G-E-T.

 The New Year also brings in the realisation that I am far behind my target, says Anu Bhagwat, a sales manager in a media firm. This quarter ends on December 31. It is another thing that I will also be reminded about the resolutions of last year that I havent kept and realise that I am exactly the same person that I am, no improvement, she laments.

 Life is more complicated for the marketing person, female. She has to manage targets while working hard on ushering in the New Year the right way. As the figures 00:00:00 light up the digital watch Saturday night and the strobes go off, she wants to fuse herself into a pulse of pure delight, screaming in the New Year with friends. For that, she has to look the role. So, she has to invest.

 I have to look sexy, wear sexy, feel sexy, says Priyanka Kwatra, a marketing manager in an event management firm. I will buy a top around Rs 2,000 and shoes going with it. If I am wearing a mini skirt, then I will have to buy a corset for it for my tummy ? Rs 400. 

 If I am with a guy, I would like him to look good as well. I will invest between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000 in his clothes, she says. Then there are party tickets. We would buy something like Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 per head, she says.

 She says it pays. The idea is to have a good time and I have it. But the homework bit?

 Its immensely stressful. Plus my weight. I skip gym at other times but since last month, I have been a good girl. 

 The results are showing. Retail clothes stores have businesses booming. On a year-on-year and same-store basis, this December we have registered a growth of 25 per cent, says Sanjeev Agarwal, president, marketing, at Pantaloons. Generally, New Year sales are considerably lower than Diwali, about 20 per cent. In Calcutta, New Year sales are 30 per cent-40 per cent lower than the Pujas, he says. But this year, we have registered more sales for New Year in Gurgaon than for Diwali. 

 The hype over New Year is assisted by the market and the media, says psychiatrist Harish Shetty. As other traditional resources end ? people dont go back to their gaon any more so much, for example ? an event like the New Year helps to fill up a deep vacuum in the collective psyche, he adds. Thats one reason why its important to live it up, he says.

 Live goddess passes the hat

 Bhopal, Sept. 19: The Dalits have a new deity ? self-proclaimed goddess Mayavati.

 And the goddess wishes the party rank and file should make generous offerings to her. When you are asked for party funds, you plead poverty but never hesitate to spend crores on superstitions about pleasing unseen gods and goddesses who cannot do any good to you, the Bahujan Samaj Party chief told the large gathering at the Lal Parade grounds today.

 I am your goddess, living and right in front of you. Ill transform your lives, the Bahujan Samaj Party chief unabashedly proclaimed.

 She warned that if the Dalits did not chip in and follow her wisdom, the bahujan samaj movement would be forced to depend on funds from manuvadis (high castes) which would defeat the objective of Dalits coming to power. Give money in offerings to me and see how we change the political scenario. The crowd heard her with rapt attention, first braving a shower, followed by scorching heat.

 The problem afflicting the bahujan samaj, Mayavati said, was that Dalits failed to respond to B.R. Ambedkars call to gather on a single political platform. A chief minister may belong to downtrodden or backward castes but if he or she represented the BJP or the Congress, such a person tended to behave like a bonded labourer in the hands of manuvadi forces and ultimately failed to do any good for the community, she said.

 The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister alleged that as a conspiracy, the present UPA government and the previous NDA regime had privatised public sector units to bring an end to job quotas and curtail employment opportunities for the weaker sections. 

 Mayavati said her party would contest the coming elections in Bihar and other states on its own. In Madhya Pradesh, the BSPs fortunes have been on the slide.

 The party won only two seats in the last Assembly polls.

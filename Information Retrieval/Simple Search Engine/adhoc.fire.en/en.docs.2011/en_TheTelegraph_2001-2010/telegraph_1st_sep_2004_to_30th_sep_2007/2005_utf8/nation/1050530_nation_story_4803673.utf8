 Early-bird BJP gathers Bihar flock 

 ASHISH SINHA

 Arun Jaitley

 Patna, May 29: United like never before in Bihar, National Democratic Alliance leaders have begun making preparations although early elections seem unlikely and each meeting of the partners hedges its bet on the bright chance of a Supreme Court intervention in the dissolution of the Assembly.

 On his first trip to Bihar after being reappointed in-charge of state elections, BJP leader Arun Jaitley today met senior Janata Dal (United) politicians Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav after the two parties held separate brainstorming sessions with their former MLAs, who never got to enter the Assembly.

 Surprisingly, senior Dal (U) leaders addressed a meeting of the BJPs former legislators and the doors were opened wide for the waiting media contingents. 

 Jaitley said the NDA will romp home if the polls are held in July and asked the Election Commission not to be guided by the state administrations plea for November elections.

 We now foresee a problem of plenty as many candidates, including Independents and the Lok Janshakti Party rebels, have to be accommodated, a senior BJP leader said.

 The opinion of legal experts like Soli J. Sorabjee and Fali S. Nariman, who questioned the dissolution of the Assembly, provided ammunition to the NDA leaders and they said they would take the issue very seriously.

 Nariman has said the President should have sent back the cabinets recommendation for reconsideration. As the largest alliance, the NDA had a responsibility for forming the government and when we tried to do that, we were prevented by wholly unconstitutional means, he added.

 Nitish Kumar said governor Buta Singh was pre-determined to stop the formation of an NDA government at any cost. The governor had begun talking about horse-trading for quite some time to prepare the background for his unconstitutional act. Why didnt he talk to the MLAs who were allegedly being bought? The Independents had pledged support to us on April 9, followed by the LJP legislators, he added.

 The Dal (U) leader said the intelligence inputs Singh based his report on were highly suspect. The intelligence report could have easily been doctored on the governors instructions. There was no independent assessment of the so-called horse-trading. Had the balance been in favour of the UPA, the governor would have facilitated the formation of a government. 

 In an indirect attack on Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav, Sharad Yadav said: This government is a hostage to the blackmailing of the RJD. A crime was committed and injustice heaped on the people of Bihar. The misuse of the governors office had been showing a declining trend but the UPA government has reversed the pattern in just one year.

 Nitish said: We are ready for snap polls but the RJD is using the state administration to defer the elections till November. The real plan is to extend the date to February next year.

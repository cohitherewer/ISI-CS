 PC talks banking at breakfast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: The United Progressive Alliance government and the Left today revived talks on the controversial banking sector reforms after a lull.

 But the 90-minute discussion over breakfast at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s residence ended on a familiar note.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram tried to convince his Left allies on the need to implement the reforms that had been set in motion by the previous National Democratic Alliance government. But the communists were not fully in agreement.

 ?Are there any other alternatives?? CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan asked. This indicates that the Left knows the government cannot roll back the banking reforms already in motion.

 These reforms were at the top of today?s agenda. The Left opposes the reforms saying they would weaken public sector banks, endanger jobs of employees and lead to a takeover by foreign banks.

 The reforms would allow foreign banks to acquire shares in public banks and permits divestment of nationalised banks. There is also a proposal to allow foreign direct investment in private banks. Notifications were issued to this effect when the NDA was in power.

 Chidambaram told the Left leaders India needed to catch up with the international banking sector. It ranks a lowly 82nd on the international banking list. ?The finance minister told us India is not even enrolled in the international bank consortium,? Bardhan said.

 When the Left leaders expressed their reservations, Chidambaram said they would be taken care of. He told them the reforms would not hurt bank employees. ?No employee will be disturbed. There will be no retrenchments,? Bardhan quoted the finance minister as saying.

 Left leaders wanted to know the modalities of foreign banks picking up shares in private banks. They were told the Reserve Bank of India would be the monitoring agency. Chidambaram also assured the Left that rural credit would increase.

 Speaking about divestment of nationalised banks, the minister said 51 per cent of shares would remain with the government whatever the dilution of shares.

Airline equality

 Left leaders who met Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi at the UPA-Left coordination committee meeting today sought a level playing field between private airlines who have been allowed to fly abroad and state-run airlines. 

 RSP leader Abani Roy said: ?We want a level playing field... lucrative routes should not go to private players while state-run airlines are left handicapped.?

 New Delhi, April 7: The army is working on additional military confidence-building measures in Jammu and Kashmir following the successful inauguration of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service today and a commanders? conference being held here has noted that infiltration from across the Line of Control is down to zero.

 These confidence-building measures will follow the reduction of troops ordered by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in October and may be timed to coincide with the visit of President Pervez Musharraf.

 The army, riding on the Prime Minister?s peace offensive, is working to throw up ideas for confidence-building measures. General Joginder Jaswant Singh, the army chief who is chairing the commanders? conference, said infiltration ?was almost not there? according to the last intelligence reports.

 Army headquarters is signalling clearly that it is dovetailing its operations to the peace process. ?We are not trying to say today that Pakistan is encouraging terrorism even as the bus service is inaugurated. This is not the time. This is a season of confidence-building measures. The army is trying to join that process,? sources emphasised.

 ?It is important to note that army engineers built the Aman Setu and the fact that the army facilitated the bus service,? a source said.

 General Singh was extremely reluctant to come out with provocative statements despite persistent questioning during a briefing here today.

 ?Infiltration has come down and reports as of last month say it was almost not there,? he said. ?The infrastructure of training (militants) remains intact,? Singh reluctantly said, on being repeatedly asked if militants are being trained in camps across the Line of Control.

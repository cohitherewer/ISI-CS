The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Delhi to climb 4 pegs down 

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 Old enough for Delhi?

 New Delhi, April 4: Hic, hic, Delhi is about to come down to the level of Calcutta but it will not stoop as low as Bangalore and Mumbai.

 If you are 18, you can vote, drive a car and watch an adult movie in Delhi. But you need to be 25 ? the age you can be an MP ? to order a drink in a bar in the national capital. 

 The bar could be lowered a few notches soon. The eligible age to be served in a bar is likely to be pulled down to 21 ? the same threshold that permits a boy to get married in the country.

 In Calcutta, the licence to swagger into a bar is available at 21, while Mumbai and Bangalore have pegged it three years lower at the universal mark of adulthood.

 The 25-year bar has survived in Delhi this long mainly because of its political culture that prefers to sweep sins ? as well as pleasures ? under the carpet and sport the khadi kurta-topi image in public.

 However, with a mall-and-pub culture striking deep roots, the Delhi government is planning to amend an excise law passed in 1978.

 The restriction in any case was being flouted with impunity in the city that has tasted the pleasures of nightlife. If the government was hoping to keep the truth bottled up, it came across several eye-openers.

 Recently, excise officials on a raid were surprised to spot schoolchildren in their uniforms frequenting bars in South Delhi and Connaught Place. 

 ?The excise department can only take disciplinary action against the licensee when it comes to serving liquor to those below 25. We can suspend or cancel his bar licence. As for the offender, we really do not have powers to take action against them,? a senior excise official said.

 Though the government has now decided in principle to lower the age, it opted for 21 as the cut-off point. It feels that 18, closer to the school-going age, would have unleashed a backlash from parents. 

 But not all are content. ?It is ridiculous that the age at which you can be served liquor is 25 in a place like Delhi. You can vote and even married at 21 but you can?t get a drink, it is absurd. These restrictions make it more difficult to teach them to do things within limits,? said Manoj Handa, whose 18-year-old son will enter college this year.

 The trade, too, is not raising a toast. ?How can you make out if a person is 18, 21 or 25? The age should actually be 18. There have been stray cases in Connaught Place where schoolchildren were spotted at these bars and they were dealt with strictly. If the parents are giving consent, who are we to say no?? asked Ramneet Trehan, a member of National Restaurants Association of India.

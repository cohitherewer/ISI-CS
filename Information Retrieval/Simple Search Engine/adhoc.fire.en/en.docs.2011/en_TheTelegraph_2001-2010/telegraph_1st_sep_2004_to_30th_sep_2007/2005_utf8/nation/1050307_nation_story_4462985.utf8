 MP govt to cast away fallen oil hero 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, March 6: After shutting down the Madhya Pradesh Road Transport Corporation, the Babulal Gaur government has decided to close another public sector company, Oil Federation, which has run up a loss of Rs 800 crore.

 Oil Federation owes over Rs 800 crore to banks and local mandi cooperative boards. Started in 1979 with an investment of Rs 125 crore, Oil Federation until the last decade was one of the most profitable public sector units in the state.

 It initially got farmers good prices for soya bean and earned huge revenue through oil production as Madhya Pradesh emerged as the country?s leading state in soya bean production. But in the last decade, because of political interference and financial irregularities, Oil Federation suffered losses.

 Out of the unit?s nearly 1,500 employees, most were shifted to other government departments. 

 Those who remained have not been paid salaries since December 2004.

 The Congress came down heavily on Gaur, accusing the chief minister of playing into the hands of private players. Congress MLA Satyadev Katare said: ?It (the closing down of the unit) has been done only to help private players in the market but we in the Congress are against any such move.?

 However, director of the PHD Chamber of Commerce Rajan Kothari disagreed, saying the government should not be involved in business. ?It is a wise decision to move out of it,? he said, while acknowledging Oil Federation?s contribution in strengthening the farming community. 

 ?The federation lost money on account of bad management, depreciation, counter-guarantees and high interest.?

 State agriculture minister Gopal Bhargava said he was merely acting on a cabinet sub-committee?s report. ?The sub-committee has recommended that there is no profit in running it. Winding it up is the best option and we might announce a VRS for the employees,? Bhargava said.

 Oil Federation?s closure comes barely a month after Gaur announced the closure of Madhya Pradesh Road Transport Corporation.

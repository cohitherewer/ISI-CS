 Six killed in house collapse

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 25: Six people were killed and five injured when a three-storeyed building collapsed last night in Khar in the western suburbs after heavy rain lashed Mumbai for the third consecutive day.

 Among the dead was an 18-year-old who remained trapped under the debris all night.

 The owner of the building, Ramesh Agarwal, 65, and four others have been admitted to a local hospital. Agarwal is believed to be in a critical condition.

 The 40-year-old Pushpanjali building crumbled around 10 pm but heavy rain and the narrow approach road hampered the rescue operation conducted by the fire brigade and police. 

 Chief fire officer A.K. Jhandwal said lack of adequate equipment required for clearing the debris also slowed down rescue efforts.

 The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is likely to order a probe into the collapse. Municipal officials said urgent repairs were needed but were not carried out.

 Pappu oath on March 21

 Pappu: MP, at last

New Delhi, March 17: The Supreme Court today 

gave permission to the Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Madhepura, Pappu Yadav, to 

take oath on March 21 as member of the Lok Sabha.

 Yadav is lodged in the high-security Tihar Jail in the Ajit Sarkar murder case.

 The division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha also directed the directorate-general of health services to depute a doctor for Yadav?s medical examination.

 The bench asked the jail authorities to take appropriate steps in case the physician suggests any treatment.

 The judges, however, rejected Yadav?s plea to visit his constituency for two days after taking oath as MP for ?overseeing? the utilisation of MPLAD funds.

 Virus vaccine on trial

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: After 16 years of research, a vaccine developed by Indian and American scientists against an infant-killer virus has passed safety tests and is ready for crucial efficacy trials.

 The vaccine is aimed at protecting infants from rotavirus infections which claim the lives of an estimated 150,000 children in India each year by causing severe diarrhoea and life-threatening dehydration.

 Nearly every child in the world is exposed to rotavirus before the age of five. While most cases are mild, children below three in developing countries are particularly at risk of developing severe infection. 

 Experts estimate that rotaviruses account for two million hospitalisations and 600,000 deaths worldwide.

 Scientists involved in the development of the Indian vaccine and clinical trials said there was no adverse event in any of the 30 infants in India who were given the vaccine at eight weeks of age.

 Tests have shown that 21 out of the 30 infants developed antibodies against the virus, a signal that the vaccine may protect them. 

 Department of biotechnology officials said the results indicate that the vaccine is safe for infants. 

 However, with efficacy trials yet to begin, it could take another three years before the vaccine is ready for release, they said.

 Safety has emerged as a crucial issue in the international race to develop a vaccine against rotavirus infections. At least three other candidate vaccines developed outside India are undergoing clinical trials.

 Six years ago, a rotavirus vaccine approved for use in the US was withdrawn after doctors noticed that it may have contributed to an elevated risk of intestinal obstruction in one out of every 12,000 vaccinated infants.

 We conducted ultrasound scans and medical exams on every infant with suspicious symptoms, but found no signs of intestinal obstruction, said Dr Nita Bhandari, the joint director at the Society for Applied Studies in New Delhi, a research organisation involved in the clinical trials of the Indian vaccine.

 I think this is a significant development, said Dr T. Jacob John, the former head of clinical virology at the Christian Medical College in Vellore. 

 The Indian vaccines are based on naturally-occurring strains of rotavirus isolated from infected infants. We expect them to have a good safety profile, John said.

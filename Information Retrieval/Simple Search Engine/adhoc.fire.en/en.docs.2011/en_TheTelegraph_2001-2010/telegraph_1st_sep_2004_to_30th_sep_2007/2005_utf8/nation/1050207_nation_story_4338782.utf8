 Coal company bid to streamline supply

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: In a bid to streamline the supply of coal to small and medium industries, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited has decided to use the services of the state-run Orissa Small Industries Corporation.

 At a recent high-level meeting, industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan announced that the government would step up its efforts to facilitate supply of coal and iron ore to the existing sponge iron units in the state. The meeting was attended by the chairman-cum-managing director of MCL, A. Sharma, besides senior government officials.

 Chairing the meeting, Harichandan said the government will approach the Union coal ministry for assistance and steps will be taken to supply coal through Osic. According to the plan, MCL will supply coal to the corporation, which, in turn, will allot the same to the individual units based on their demand. 

 The sponge iron manufacturers have been alleging that the bulk of high-grade coal produced in the country is usually diverted to power, cement, paper, aluminium and ceramic industries leaving little for them. 

 Orissa accounts for almost 50 per cent of the country?s total production of 10 million tonnes of sponge iron with an installed capacity of 4.5 million tonnes.

 Sharma pointed out that the small and medium industries in Orissa do not procure coal from MCL. Instead, they go to the black market for coal, he added. 

 Sharma underlined the need for a review of the supply process, exploration of the possibility of supplying the same to the small and medium units from Talcher mines instead of Ib Valley mines and initiation of steps to computerise the auction of coal. He also sought the government?s help in acquiring land and other facilities to operate new mines.

 The meeting also decided that the government would request the Railway Board chairman to provide more wagons for smooth supply of coal.

 During the last session of the Assembly, several MLAs had expressed concern over the scarcity of coal and problems of the small and medium industries. They had also alleged that MCL was not supplying adequate quantity of high-grade coal to these units.

 Jaya defends ?pious? police

 Chennai, Feb. 7 (PTI): Jayalalithaa today defended the practice by some police officials of placing copies of chargesheets at the feet of deities in temples before filing them in courts.

 Congress MLA S.G. Vinayagamurthy had criticised the practice a couple of days earlier.

 Today, replying to a debate on the motion of thanks to the governor for his address, the Tamil Nadu chief minister told the Assembly that everyone would seek god?s blessings before doing a good thing. ?Police are human beings and we cannot prevent them from this practice,? she said, in an obvious reference to SP K. Premkumar, who had prayed at the Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kancheepuram before filing the chargesheet in the Shankar Raman murder case.

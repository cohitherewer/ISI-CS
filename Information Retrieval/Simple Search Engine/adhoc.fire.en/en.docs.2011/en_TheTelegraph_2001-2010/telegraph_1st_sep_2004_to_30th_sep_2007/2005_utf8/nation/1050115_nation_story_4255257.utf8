 Patna/New Delhi, Jan. 14: As the Congress today toyed with the idea of fielding candidates in 22 of Bihar?s 64 constituencies going to polls in the first phase, the Rashtriya Janata Dal said it would stay away from the 12 seats that its UPA ally won in the 2000 Assembly election.

 The clarification came amid indications from the Lok Janshakti Party that it would not contest any of the seats where the Congress puts up nominees. Congress sources have said the party is keen to fight around 80 of the 243 seats, though some leaders said the figure could cross 100.

 Chaired by Sonia Gandhi, a meeting of the party?s central election committee in Delhi this evening is understood to have decided that it would contest 22 seats in the first phase of polling on February 3. The candidates have been decided, said party sources. 

 Bihar Pradesh Congress committee president Ram Jatan Sinha, who is in Delhi to finalise the list of candidates, has been authorised by the leadership to issue authority letters (B form) to candidates to facilitate the allotment of the party symbol. ?Nearly a hundred blank B forms have been issued,? said a source.

 RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav made it clear that he was willing to sacrifice 12 seats. He said the party?s other ?alliance? partners ? the CPM, CPI and Nationalist Congress Party ? would divide the remaining 231 seats among themselves in due course. The CPI, however, indicated it was interested in contesting more than four seats it did the last time.

 With the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) already in the process of announcing their candidates, the Bihar elections, in most constituencies, appear to witness a triangular contest ? among the NDA, the RJD ?alliance? and the LJP or the Congress. Smaller players like the CPI-ML, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party would also be trying their luck from a good number of seats.

 The position of the Congress is the most confounding. It can neither support nor oppose the RJD, while the LJP has clearly come out in support of the Congress.

 Congress leaders maintain they wish to appeal to their ?lost? support base among Dalits, Muslims and the upper castes in Bihar. But while the RJD would try to keep the Muslims with it, the LJP is pinning its hopes on a ?split? in the minority votes, apart from its ?traditional? appeal among Dalits.

 Psephologists have repeatedly attributed Laloo Prasad?s ?upper hand? in Bihar politics to his command over Muslim and Yadav voters. The RJD?s opponents have all admitted that ousting the party will be an uphill task unless there is a breach in its traditional Muslim-Yadav votebank.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Homage to air force martyrs

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Car Nicobar, Dec. 22: When K.K. Bandyopadhyay walks to his wrecked home near the beach on December 26, each footstep will bear the burden of a terrible memory.

 A former station commander of Indias most important forward operating airbase ? locally known as Carnic ? Bandyopadhyay had watched how 116 of his colleagues and more than 50 women and children died fighting the tsunami that tore apart the island a year ago.

 Oh yes! I will be in Carnic four days from now and will definitely take the walk to the beach where the tsunami struck. I cannot forget what I have gone through every hour, every day. The last year has been so depressing, the air force officer, now based in Calcuttas Fort William as group captain, told The Telegraph.

 Bandyopadhyay was part of a group of 700 personnel who were shifted out of the island in batches and relocated to air force bases around the country. He rues that the nation has forgotten the heroes who battled the monstrous sea to save thousands.

 Nobody cares to find out how the men who faced the tsunami are coping with life. I get calls at midnight from my colleagues from far-flung places. They all tell me they are fighting each day of their lives to get over the trauma, said Bandyopadhyay, who will perhaps make his last trip to Carnic on Monday along with 70 relatives of his colleagues who lost their lives.

 I am looking forward to meeting most of them and sharing our wounds, he said from his Calcutta home.

 The air force wants to demolish the last standing structures as senior officials feel the ravaged officers colony will only demoralise the force.

 They must demolish it and life has to go on. They are a new brand of officers who have been assigned the task of taking the work forward. I understand their sentiments, but they will probably never understand or feel what we are going through, said an officer from Delhi.

 Only a handful from the earlier batch of officers stationed in Carnic have made the journey back since the tragedy struck.

 Wing commander N. Sathe, who flew into Carnic for a rescue operation, recalled how, overcome with emotion, an officer ? Commander Krishna Kumar ? could not spend more than an hour there. He is going away to Congo on a UN mission. Perhaps, that will help him get over everything, Sathe said.

 Kumar, who was in charge of the helicopter fleet along with Squadron Leader S. Maheshwari, had circled the island for hours looking for traces of life.

 Another officer remembered how people rushed out of their houses only to be swallowed up by the gigantic waves. They ran as fast as they could, but a barbed wire prevented many from fleeing. The children and women were sitting ducks. They did not stand a chance, the officer said.

 Power fine for gadget damage

 New Delhi (PTI): The Delhi Vidyut Board 

 has been asked to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 for the 

 damage caused to the electronic equipment of a hotel due 

 to erratic power supply and voltage fluctuation after the 

 Delhi state consumer commission found the board guilty of 

 ?deficiency in service?. 

 The power board admitted voltage fluctuation, but said it was due to hooking by people residing in slum adjacent to the hotel. 

 ?Whatever may be the reasons, the registered consumers have been put to disadvantage and left high and dry merely because the electricity agencies find it difficult to check the menace of theft of electricity by the unauthorised elements,? the commission said.

 Hotel Jageer Palace in Mansarovar Garden had repeatedly complained to the board authorities about persistent power fluctuation and erratic power supply resulting in massive damage to its deep freezers, motors, refrigerators, tubes and chokes. The hotel approached the consumer commission on not receiving any response from the power board. 

 The consumer commission pulled up the board for ?not taking effective action? and displaying helplessness and said it cannot shy away from its ?liability of compensating the consumers for deficiency in service?.

 Sati tag sparks protests 

 Jaipur (PTI): The naming of a township 

 here after a sati evoked strong protests from two 

 womens organisations on Sunday. The organisations 

 alleged that it amounted to glorifying the banned practice 

 and is against the Sati Prevention Act, 1987.

 ?It is ridiculous that the BJP government has approved the scheme and its local self and civic minister Pratap Singh Singhvi will inaugurate the scheme tomorrow,? Vividha and Mahila Punarwas Samooh Samiti said following publication of newspaper advertisements on the sale of residential plots and the setting up of a private township named Shree Rani Sati Nagar.

 The proposed colony will be built near the planned film city and the Jaipur Development Authority has approved its plan.

 The two womens organisations have also written separate letters to the chief secretary, home secretary and the development authority commissioner, asking them to ensure that the name is dropped. 

 Two held for shooting blast

 Mumbai (PTI): The director and the 

 producer of a film have been arrested after four persons 

 were injured in an explosion during shooting at Dahisar. 

 An actor, an assistant, a labourer and an onlooker were injured when explosive material used in the shooting of Siyasat burst on Saturday, police said.

 Collision deaths

 Sonebhadra (PTI): Eight people, 

 including two children, were killed and five injured when 

 the jeep in which they were travelling collided with a truck 

 here on Sunday, police said. The jeep hit the coal-laden 

 truck coming from the opposite side near Parvadh village 

 in Uttar Pradesh.

 Train numbers 

 Mumbai (PTI): Central Railway has 

 decided to renumber four long-distance trains with effect

 Express ? 2151/2152, Dadar-Chennai Express ? 2163/2164, 

 and Dadar-Nagpur Sewagram Express ? 2139/2140. 

 Rebel surrenders

 Rajahmundry (PTI): A deputy commander 

 of a Maoist group surrendered to Andhra Pradesh police on 

 Saturday. The female rebel leader, Kadabala Lakshmi alias 

 Vanaja, was part of the guerrilla squad that raided Chodavaram 

 police station in 2003. 

 Rapists convicted

 Sonepat (PTI): A court has sentenced 

 four youths of Juan village to 10 years imprisonment 

 with a fine of Rs 10,000 each for gangraping a woman on

 to the Muslim community and the case was just like the Best 

 Bakery murder case.

 cashier has been booked for alleged misappropriation of 

 funds of over Rs 50 lakh. The cashier prepared fake documents 

 and submitted them as originals, police said.

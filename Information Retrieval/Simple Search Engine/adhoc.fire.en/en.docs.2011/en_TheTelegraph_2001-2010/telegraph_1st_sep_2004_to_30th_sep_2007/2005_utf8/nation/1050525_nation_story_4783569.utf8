 Sambalpur eviction begins

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sambalpur, May 24: The long-awaited anti-encroachment drive of Sambalpur Municipality began today from Ring Road.

 Not willing to take any chances, the administration kept a police platoon ready on the spot. Besides, senior officers and a magistrate were also present.

 District collector Vishal Gagan recently issued instructions to the municipality to begin the drive.

 In the first phase today, seven structures ? owned by individuals as well as institutions ? were razed following a 24-hour notice, said Kabindra Sahu, tehsildar of Sambalpur subdivision. The drive is aimed at making the roads encroachment-free and spacious, he added.

 On condition of anonymity, a woman said though it adversely affected her, she was not opposed to the drive, which was in the larger public interest. I demand similar action on all those who have encroached upon busy thoroughfares, particularly Gole Bazar and VSS Marg, she added. 

 Speaking on the issue, the tehsildar said the revenue department usually gives 30 days to encroachers for vacating government land. The person concerned, however, can get a stay order from the court and delay the procedure. 

 On the other hand, the municipality can demolish any structure on the thoroughfares after serving a 24-hour notice on the offenders. Todays eviction followed this procedure, Sahu said, adding that it is yet to be done in other parts of the town, including the posh areas.

 Asked if the eviction drive would cover other places of the town as well, executive officer (in-charge) of Sambalpur Municipality, Sachidananda Satpathy, said he was not in a position to divulge anything without consulting the chairman of the civic body.

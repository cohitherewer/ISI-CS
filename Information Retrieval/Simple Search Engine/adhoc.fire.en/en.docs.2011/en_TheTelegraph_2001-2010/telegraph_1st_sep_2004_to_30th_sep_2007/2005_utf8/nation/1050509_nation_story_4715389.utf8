 Push to bridge digital divide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 8: The Tamil Nadu government has launched an ambitious project to build a computer-based education network with a knowledge data centre in Anna University as its hub.

 The Jayalalithaa regime recently gave the go-ahead to set up the data centre, to cost Rs 21.36 crore, which would also double as a technology resource centre for students in the state.

 The move is part of efforts to bridge the digital divide in a state where the 73.47 per cent literacy rate ? according to the 2001 census ? is next only to Kerala and Maharashtra.

 The data centre will be connected to all engineering colleges affiliated to the university in the projects first phase, according to a recent order of the state information technology department.

 Once all the engineering colleges get connected, all government polytechnics, colleges, including medical institutions, and even state-run higher secondary schools will be connected to the data centre.

 Sources said the centre, besides being a storehouse of knowledge, would help foster cooperation between the academic community and those in the field of industry.

 The services to be provided by the network in the first phase include ?e-education, e-learning, e-tutoring, a digital library, messaging and communication, which means a common e-mail infrastructure for all the institutions to be linked?.

 The project is being implemented under a memoran-dum of understanding signed by the Tamil Nadu government, the US-based Sun Microsystems and Anna University. 

 For the first phase, Sun Microsystems will provide Rs 11.53 crore by way of discounts on hardware to be supplied by the company for the computer-based project.

 The state government will provide Rs 3.19 crore, the university Rs 4.64 crore and the 50 engineering colleges affiliated to the university will together invest Rs 2 crore.

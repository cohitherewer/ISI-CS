 V-Day Moscow date

 New Delhi, May 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will leave on a three-day trip to Moscow tomorrow to participate in the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Victory Day, reports our special correspondent.

 Leaders of 56 countries will attend the celebrations on May 9, marking the day when Nazi Germany fell to the Soviet Union. The event became the turning point of World War II and led to the victory of the Allied forces.

 US President George W. Bush will be among the foreign dignitaries, but it is not clear whether he will have a substantial meeting with Singh. 

 The Prime Minister will, however, have a meeting with his host and Russian President Vladimir Putin on bilateral and other issues of mutual interest.

 Singh may also have a few meetings with leaders of Central Asian countries. 

 But the timings are still being worked out by Indian officials since most of the leaders stay in Moscow will be very short. 

 The Prime Minister will return to the capital on May 10.

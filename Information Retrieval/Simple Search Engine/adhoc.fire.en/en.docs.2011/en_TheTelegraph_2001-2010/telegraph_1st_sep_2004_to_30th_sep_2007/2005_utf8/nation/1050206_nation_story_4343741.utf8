 Calcutta, Feb. 5: A committee has been formed by the Andaman and Nicobar administration to coordinate the activities of over 40 non-government organisations working in the tsunami-struck islands.

 The authorities, who have been accused by a number of aid organisations of not cooperating and even rejecting external contributions, had cited constraints in accepting aid ? both in kind and in the form of volunteers ? due to the islands? unique logistical challenges.

 ?We consider NGOs our allies and partners in our joint efforts of working for the relief and rehabilitation of tsunami victims. They have strengths in areas where we can benefit and our objective is to derive synergies and avoid duplication of work,? says Anshu Prakash, the development commissioner.

 Organisations willing to commit to the islands for a year or more are being encouraged to take action. Key areas for cooperation have been identified: the islanders will need assistance in rebuilding livelihoods, primarily agriculture and fisheries; counselling and legal assistance are required for victims; vulnerable groups, such as adolescent girls, physically challenged and senior citizens, will call for special attention.

 ?Compared to the mainland, the island administration took longer to devise a mechanism for NGOs to work,? says Aditi Kapoor, media and advocacy coordinator, Oxfam. ?But now we have a very positive response from the government.? The disaster called for ?a whole new way of working? and administration is ?still learning?, she feels.

 ?Things are improving for sure and NGOs have also started getting their act together,? says Shrirang Dhavale, programme manager, Action Aid, who sees an ?active cooperation emerging between NGOs and the government?.

 Water, hygiene and sanitation have been identified as focus areas to prevent disease on the islands. Though conditions at relief camps are better than those on the mainland, there is still room for improvement, NGOs say. 

 ?Sanitation can be improved further, if efforts are combined with public health education,? says Prakash, stressing that the prime challenge was restricting vector-borne diseases and hygiene.

 Outsourcing music

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, July 17: Long before BPOs became the buzzword, N. Ravikiran and his clients abroad have been benefiting from outsourcing.

 What he offers, however, has nothing to do with banking or insurance. The Chennai-based artiste imparts lessons in classical Carnatic music through a combination of the telephone, the Internet and audio tapes.

 I launched the concept of tele-teaching in 1996, said the singing and chitraveena (a musical instrument) teacher, who has started the International Foundation of Carnatic Music.

 During my earlier trips abroad for concerts, I had discovered that many young and talented Indian children who lived there were unable to get the right kind of direction and inspiration, because there are hardly any senior Indian classical musicians in their countries.

 One of his students, 11-year-old prodigy Aditya Kanukurthy of Austin, Texas, held his first public concert yesterday. The show, keenly watched by the big names in Carnatic music, was a crucial test for the efficacy of Ravikirans teaching methods.

 Ravikiran explained how the system works. He records the lessons and sends the audio tapes to his students abroad by courier. 

 Alternatively, he uploads the contents of the CDs on to the Internet for his students to download and practise according to his instructions.

 The tapes I sent him became the guru, Ravikiran said as he introduced Aditya to a select gathering a week ago.

 If the students have doubts, they are clarified through emails, he said. Sometimes, they take voice correction lessons over the phone so that they can get the diction right and develop the nuances of tone.

 When the shishya and the guru-at-a-distance both think the time is ripe, the pupil comes down to Chennai to demonstrate his authentic grasp of Carnatic music.

 Tele-teaching isnt easy, Ravikiran warned. It must be backed by some very hard work and dedication. Aditya, his student of two and a half years, is a fine example of all these.

 To prove the point, Aditya sang a Tamil song by poet Barathiyar at the function, where two books on Carnatic music by Ravikiran and two audio CDs were released.

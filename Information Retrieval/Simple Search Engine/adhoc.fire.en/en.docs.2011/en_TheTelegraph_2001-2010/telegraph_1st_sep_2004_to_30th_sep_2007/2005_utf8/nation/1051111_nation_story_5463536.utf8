 Industry lab for IIT

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 10: IIT Madras will soon get a brand new melting pot for new sparks.

 The Union human resource development ministry has given its approval for an industrial research and development facility for the premier technological institute, its director, Professor M.S. Ananth, said today.

 The IIT-Madras Research Park will come up close to the institutes campus in south Chennai near the information technology showpiece, Tidel Park. 

 The focus, Ananth said, will primarily be on research in information technology, telecommunications, biotechnology and manufacturing.

 The IIT Madras chief, who was addressing a news conference here with Dr Baldev Raj, the director of the Kalpakkam-based Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, said the Tamil Nadu government had allotted 6.59 acres for the park.

 An underpass or an over-bridge will connect the park to the IIT campus, he added to stress the organic link between the two.

 The park will be registered as a Section 25 company ? or non-profit company ? under the Companies Act so that profits could be ploughed back into research, Ananth said.

 The director said so far the institute-industry interaction has been based on a problem-solving approach. But the parks objective is to bring together the academic faculty, industries and young students so that they could throw up new ideas.

 Make unlike minds meet so that their synthesis produces new sparks, Ananth said, citing the example of the automobile sector, which had undergone a sea change after the Tatas indigenously designed Indica hit the market.

 In the first phase of the park, to be ready by December 2006, Ananth said 400,000 square feet of built-up area would be offered to the research and development arms of various industries. The only condition, he added, is they must interact with the faculty and students of IIT Madras.

 The IIT will not be directly investing in the park, but Ananth said former students will initially contribute Rs 10 crore for the project. 

 Part of the contribution will come from companies who rent space in the park and the rest of the expenses will be met through bank loans.

 Harry Potter style

 To kindle interest in various aspects of metallurgy, particularly iron and steel, Baldev Raj said Tata Steel has sponsored the publication of an absorbing, easy-to-comprehend book called The Ferrous Hunters for schoolchildren, written in the racy and gripping Harry Potter style.

 The book, authored by Professor H.S. Ray, a scientist from IIT Kharagpur, will be translated into several regional languages like Bengali, Marathi and Tamil.

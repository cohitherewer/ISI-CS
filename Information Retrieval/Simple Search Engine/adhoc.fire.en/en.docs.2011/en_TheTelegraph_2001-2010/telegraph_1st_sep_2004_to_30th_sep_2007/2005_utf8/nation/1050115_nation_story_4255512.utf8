 Pay wait for forgotten lot

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 14: Thursday?s Supreme Court order has come as a boon for the employees of 19 public sector undertakings, but the future continues to be bleak for those who work in the numerous sick organisations in the state.

 These employees do not know what the future holds for them as the ill-managed organisations where they work face the constant threat of closure. 

 ?Their closure is only a matter of time as the government is waiting for a pretext to do so at the earliest,? said an employee of the Backward Classes Financing Corporation. 

 Even as hundreds of PSU workers distributed sweets to welcome the Supreme Court?s decision here today, this employee sounded cautious. ?Besides the Rs 50-crore relief, the court has also asked the Bihar government to expedite the liquidation process for the employees of the state-owned units that have been closed down de facto,? he said. 

 Some advocates, who have been fighting on behalf of the Bihar Lok Upkram Morcha, were among those who celebrated with sweets. One of them, Bipin Sinha, was, however, critical of the government?s ?biased? attitude towards PSUs in the state. 

 ?Some senior corrupt government officials are responsible for the sorry state of these PSUs. Even the high court had taken notice of the corruption and wanted a CBI inquiry. Only an inquiry can reveal the truth,? he said. 

 Bihar Rajya Lok Upkram Bachao Morcha convener Ashwini Kumar, who welcomed yesterday?s ruling, was equally critical of the government. ?The closure of the 19 units has been a huge loss for the state. Besides causing more unemployment, the government has done great harm to the state by closing down three profit-making units,? he said. ?Besides, the closure of the leather and sugar corporations has also affected the prospects of the state,? Kumar added. 

 According to a report, the number of employees and their dependants who have died due to lack of proper treatment and food is a staggering 1,576. The apex court yesterday noted that five employees of the 19 corporations in question have died for want of money.

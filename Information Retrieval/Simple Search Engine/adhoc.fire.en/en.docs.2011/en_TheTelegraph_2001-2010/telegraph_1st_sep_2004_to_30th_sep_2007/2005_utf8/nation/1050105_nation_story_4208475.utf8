 Orissa police in gender gift

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: In a bid to eliminate gender discrimination, Orissa police have decided to do away with the word ?women? from designations.

 ?Women police personnel are an integral and indispensable part of the state police. They discharge the same duties and responsibilities while being exposed to similar hazards as their male counterparts, said state director-general of police Bipin Bihari Mishra.

 ?There is no separate cadre for women personnel. Therefore, it is incongruous to prefix their designations with the term ?women?,? he added. Mishra said instructions have been issued to all heads of police establishments in the state to make the necessary changes.

 Four years ago, the police brass in the state had decided that male officers would man the four women?s police stations in Orissa at night to make the personnel feel secure.

 In another development, the state police have finally got an official website of their own. The site ? www.orissapolice.nic.in ? was inaugurated by chief minister Naveen Patnaik in Bhubaneswar last Saturday. 

 The website contains information on the police administration in the state. It also features important information on missing people and photographs of unidentified bodies. 

 The site spells out general and traffic rules and advice for the public. Besides, it has a grievance cell through which people can communicate directly with top police officials. 

 ?There are a large number of absconders in the state. Initially, we have put up the names and photographs of those who are most wanted and could even be found outside the state,? said DGP Mishra. Home secretary Santosh Kumar, Mishra and principal secretary to the chief minister, Bijoy Patnaik, were also present in the inauguration ceremony.

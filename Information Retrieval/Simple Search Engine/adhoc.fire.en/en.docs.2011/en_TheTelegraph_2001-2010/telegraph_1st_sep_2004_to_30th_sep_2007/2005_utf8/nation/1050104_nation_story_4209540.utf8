 Islands out of foreign reach

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Centre is unlikely to agree to allow international aid agencies to join in the relief effort in the ?sensitive? Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 The agencies have criticised Delhi for making the islands out of bounds and ?accelerating the miseries? of the islanders due to the delay in responding to the crisis. Several aid agencies, including Oxfam, CARE and the Paris-based Medicins Sans Frontieres, have called for a change in stand to reduce the delay in reaching out to the tsunami victims.

 Even so, Delhi does not appear to have had a rethink. A Union home ministry official suggested that foreign aid agencies could instead concentrate on tsunami victims on the mainland. ?International aid agencies have not been barred from providing relief in the states, Tamil Nadu and elsewhere... They have been allowed there from the beginning. They can work there,? an official said.

 ?As for the islands, there is no plan to relax the rules for foreign agencies,? he said, pointing that the home ministry had already allowed Indian aid agencies to partner the administration there. ?I was told that four groups of (Indian) volunteers had already been provided access there,? the official said, pointing to security concerns on allowing foreigners free access to the islands.

 Foreigners are not allowed to enter most of the hundreds of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, of which only 38 are inhabited. Indians also need special permits to visit. 

 The tourism ministry had asked the home ministry to waive this condition, but no decision has been taken on this.

 French submarines run aground

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 15: India is likely to renegotiate a multi-billion-dollar deal to acquire submarines despite the navy having told the government that it is in favour of co-producing and inducting the Scorpene from France.

 Defence sources said today that the cabinet committee on security has directed the defence ministry to take a re-look at the deal that the navy and the French government have been negotiating. The navy had also agreed to a final price of the submarine about a year ago but was dissatisfied with the government for delaying a decision as it was leading to price escalation.

 In March this year, the Union government put off at the last minute a crucial meeting that was billed to clinch the estimated $1.8-billion deal to acquire French Scorpene submarines amid indications that a German manufacturer cleared of bribery charges will now bid for the programme, much to the chagrin of the navy.

 The renegotiation of the Scorpene submarine deal with the French company Armaris, which was nearly clinched under the National Democratic Alliance government and its defence minister George Fernandes, could be a victory of sorts for Pranab Mukherjee. 

 The government was initially loath to renegotiate big-ticket defence deals. However, since the courts cleared the German firm of bribery charges in the procurement of HDW submarines more than a decade back, the navys bid to acquire the Scorpene and Frances effort to push through the contract has been suspect.

 Since the price negotiation for the Scorpene was concluded, it has been estimated that cost was escalating at a penalty rate of Rs 2 crore per day. But the French were said to have told the government that they would absorb a part of the cost.

 The security committee is also understood to have instructed the defence ministry to negotiate its submarine contract in a manner that will eliminate the use of agents. It has said an integrity clause will have to be built into the contract.

 Naval headquarters is worried that its fleet ? particularly the submarine strike arm ? was de-commissioning vessels faster than it can acquire them. 

 India has been in negotiations with the French to acquire and jointly develop at Mazagaon Docks six 1,500-tonne Scorpene submarines. For a year now, the defence ministry has been saying that it was close to clinching the deal estimated at Rs 12,500 crore.

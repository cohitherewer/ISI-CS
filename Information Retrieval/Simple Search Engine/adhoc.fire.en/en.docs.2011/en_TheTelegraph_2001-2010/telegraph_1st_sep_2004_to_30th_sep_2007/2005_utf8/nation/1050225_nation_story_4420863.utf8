 Riot stink in Modi shuffle

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 24: Additional director-general R.B. Sreekumar, whose ?explosive affidavit? and subsequent deposition on the post-Godhra riots before the Nanavati Shah Commission had embarrassed the Narendra Modi government, has been superseded in the latest revamp in the police ranks.

 In a shuffle yesterday, the Gujarat government promoted three of the four additional DGPs to the rank of director-general but left out Sreekumar. 

 Among the three is K.R. Kaushik, a 1972 batch officer, who has been preferred to Sreekumar, an officer of the 1971 batch. Kaushik, who was Ahmedabad police commissioner, continues in the same post.

 Sreekumar has not yet decided whether he would move court. He says he would retire by the time the verdict comes. He is to retire in 2007.

 In what is being seen as a reward for their ?loyalties? and for ?toeing? the government line during the 2002 riots, controversial former Ahmedabad police commissioner P.C. Pande has been promoted and repatriated to the Gujarat cadre. A.K. Bhargav, who was acting director-general of police, was confirmed as state police chief.

 To supersede Sreekumar, the government dug out a complaint filed against him in 1987 when he was police superintendent of Kutch. 

 The complaint against him and 12 other officers pertained to communal riots when some Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists and Muslims were arrested. The complaint was filed by a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader. 

 After that complaint, Sreekumar has been promoted several times ? from SP to DIG, IG and additional DGP. 

 Sreekumar earned the wrath of Modi when the Election Commission called him to give his assessment of the law and order situation in the state on August 8, 2002. 

 Sreekumar said he has no regrets for what he did.

 ?I have taken the oath of Constitution to tell the truth,? he said, adding that he could not help if the ?truth? hurts. The denial of promotion, he said, has not caused the ?slightest? discomfiture. 

 ?I can happily retire as additional DGP. The promotion would have made a difference of only Rs 550.?

 Godhra panel

 The Centre has extended the tenure of the U.C. Banerjee Commission, probing the Godhra train carnage, by three months. A decision to this effect was taken by the Union cabinet when it met this morning.

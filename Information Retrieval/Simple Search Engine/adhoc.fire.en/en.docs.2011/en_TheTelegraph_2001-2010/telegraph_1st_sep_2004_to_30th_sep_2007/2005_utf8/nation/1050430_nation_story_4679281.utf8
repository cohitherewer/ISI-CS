The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pramod?s second regret 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mahajan

 New Delhi, April 29: Pramod Mahajan has described the post-Godhra violence as a ?black spot for any civilised society? and noted that when it happened, his party was in power both at the Centre and in Gujarat.

 The BJP general secretary, who wrote a piece called A smart salute to our karyakartas (workers) in the latest issue of BJP Today, the party?s in-house magazine, said: ?Gujarat riot is second regret for us. It proved a dampener to our resolve to turn India into a riot-free nation.? 

 Mahajan?s first ?regret? was that the Vajpayee regime could not speed up the construction of the Ram temple.

 The functionary?s remarks on Gujarat surprised many in the party because he was among the first to take up cudgels on chief minister Narendra Modi?s behalf when Modi was under attack from Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his principal secretary Brajesh Mishra. 

 Vajpayee and Mishra felt Modi ought to go after the Centre started getting the flak for being unresponsive to the violence against the Muslims in Gujarat.

 In the BJP national executive in Panaji in April 2002, Mahajan and the rest of the second-rung leaders, including M. Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and Ananth Kumar, brought up the subject of Modi at the start of the opening session and had a resolution moved in his favour. The rest of the national executive approved it and Vajpayee fell in line.

 Sources felt his comments at this juncture ?intensified? the already-bitter struggle among the second-rungers to get to the top after the RSS chief added his bit to the leadership debate by suggesting that Vajpayee and L.K. Advani should retire. Mahajan does not have the RSS? support, which Modi has.

 But the perception within the BJP was that a person with a sectarian image was ?ill-suited? to lead the party when it badly needed a leg-up and expansion in uncharted areas. 

 ?What we need is a person with a liberal appeal like Vajpayee?s, somebody who would be acceptable in a coalition. Modi does not have this attribute,? said a source.

 Since Gujarat became the defining point of secular versus communal politics, the BJP was veering round to the view that a condemnation of the violence of 2001, directly or tangentially, was the best way of securing a secular badge.

 However, Mahajan took care to please the RSS. ?Even now, when critics talk about the relationship between the RSS and the BJP, they forget to appreciate that the BJP came into being with RSS as its soul. The BJP is associated with the RSS right from its inception and it will remain so forever. At times relationships do pass through testing times but the BJP is proud of its association with the RSS through thick and thin,? he wrote.

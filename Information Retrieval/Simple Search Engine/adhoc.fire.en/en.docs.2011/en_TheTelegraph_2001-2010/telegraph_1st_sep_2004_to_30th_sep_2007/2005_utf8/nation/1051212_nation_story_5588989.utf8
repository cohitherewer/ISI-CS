 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Centre has decided to constitute a National Disaster Response Force ? with eight battalions of the central paramilitary forces ? to combat natural disasters like quakes and floods and man-made ones like nuclear and biological holocausts. 

 Each of the battalions, right now undergoing training in various disciplines, will be stationed at eight designated response centres ? Barasat near Calcutta, Greater Noida near New Delhi, Arrankonam near Chennai, Guwahati in Assam, Mundali in Orissa, Pune in Maharashtra, Gandhinagar in Gujarat and Chandigarh.

 Each of the central paramilitary forces ? the Central Reserve Police Force, Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police ? has designated two battalions. The number of battalions can be increased later on the recommendations of the National Disaster Management Authority and depending on the forces effectiveness.

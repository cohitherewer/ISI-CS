 Thackeray guard killed

 Mumbai, April 24: A guard 

 at Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray?s farmhouse in Raigad district 

 was killed and another seriously injured when they tried 

 to stop two persons, armed with swords, from breaking in 

 at midnight on Saturday, reports our special correspondent.

 The injured guard, Imocha Singh, was admitted to the Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital at Lodhivali. His colleague, Prem Kumar Singh, died on the spot at the farmhouse in Khalapur.

 Thackeray (in picture above) was scheduled to visit the farmhouse, primarily a weekend retreat for the family, yesterday but changed his plans, police sources said.

 Prem Kumar raised an alarm when he noticed two persons trying to enter the farmhouse and tried to stop the duo, according to Khalapur police. 

 However, the intruders hit the guard on the head, reportedly killing him on the spot, police officials said.

 Imocha Singh also tried to stop the intruders but was wounded. Shadat Yaymait, a third guard on duty, alerted people nearby and tried to catch the intruders who escaped.

 Khalapur village lies at the beginning of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. A series of dacoities has forced the administration to initiate mobile police patrolling and set up telephone kiosks every few kilometres on the expressway.

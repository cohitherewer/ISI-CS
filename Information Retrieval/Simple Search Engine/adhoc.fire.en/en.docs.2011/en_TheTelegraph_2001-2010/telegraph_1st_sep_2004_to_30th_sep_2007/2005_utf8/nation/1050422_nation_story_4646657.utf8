The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Party too big to be pushed by parent

 Sudarshan (top), 

 Atal: Sparring partners

 The bark is worse than the bite. In the tug of war between the leaders of the RSS and the BJP, the latter is now proving more assertive.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee has never been one to forgive direct attacks easily. Vajpayee?s retort to K.S. Sudarshan?s call for a new leadership was pithy. Since he held no posts, he had no idea what more was required of him.

 After firing a salvo at the senior leadership of the BJP, the parent organisation has taken a big step backward. Too much is at stake to risk a larger confrontation. In fact, even in his initial interview, the RSS supremo was careful to claim that the two organisations partake of a ?community of ideas?. Each charts its own course.

 In this, he protests too much. Most of the senior leaders of the party have either been ideologues (pracharaks) of the Sangh or have cut their political teeth in the local branch or shakha. This includes both Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani. Others like Arun Jaitley have held senior posts in the student front before being drafted into the party.

 None of them can take the word of the sarsanghchalak lightly. The word itself means supreme leader. It can also mean the one who directs the show. Yet much has changed in the quarter century of the party?s existence.

 When it is down and out, the Sangh is more, rather than less, assertive. In the 1984 general elections, the RSS, disappointed by what it saw as a weak-kneed endorsement of Hindutva, leaned towards the Congress. Nanaji Deshmukh, Vajpayee?s old bete noire, had actually called for ?cooperation and sympathy? for Rajiv Gandhi.

 Soon after, there was a course correction. Advani replaced Vajpayee and the Ram temple issue took the place of more minimalist agendas. The party and the movement won new adherents. Saffron was more than the main colour of the party flag.

 Yet, the six-year interregnum of the Vajpayee regime saw the Sangh keep in check even as it won significant government patronage. The compulsions of coalition politics prevented any major consolidation of gains for the Ram temple project. The sensibilities of allies also made it impossible for taking up issues like ?Bangladeshi influx?.

 Sudarshan also faced a piquant situation due to his own equation with the two men who have mostly dominated the BJP. When he was still a middle-level functionary, they were already in the ascendant in the old Bharatiya Jana Sangh since the late 1960s. There is no way he will be regarded in quite the same way as the late Balasaheb Deoras was.

 The BJP also underwent another metamorphosis in the years in office. Like several other Prime Ministers before him, Vajpayee turned to two other institutions that were relatively less prone to other influences. One was the bureaucracy: Brajesh Mishra had no loyalty other than to the Prime Minister. The other was his foster family. Both provided a degree of insulation from Nagpur?s Reshim Bagh.

 Sudarshan has always had more pronounced views on issues of economic policy and technology than his predecessors. His favourite economist, Bharat Jhunjunwala, was given a short shrift by two successive finance ministers. Economics trumped ideology.

 None of this indicates a major rift of ideological moorings. But it does show how the equation of party and parent are in a state of flux. The jostling for influence so well-known in other parties has always existed here. But it has never been so much out in the open. Not in a long time.

 What makes matters worse is that here is a vacuum below the top in each organisation. Most of the second line of the party at the national level consists of leaders who have not won a Lok Sabha seat in the last five years. To this list of Sushma Swaraj or Pramod Mahajan may be added others like the high-profile Arun Jaitley who has never contested a popular election.

 The two state-level leaders, Uma Bharti and Narendra Modi, lack wider acceptability even in the party echelons due to their style of functioning. Each may evoke other more intractable problems if the party is to appeal to its allies.

 Nor have any of the campaign issues of the last 11 months really gathered force. Govindacharya had hoped to make a comeback on the foreigner issue. Sonia sabotaged it by declining leadership of the government. Neither Veer Savarkar nor Uma Bharti?s arrest galvanised supporters, let alone the masses.

 The Sangh?s own problems are no less acute. There is a dearth of leadership in the second rung. Mohan Das Bhagwat, now the general secretary, has to travel to become the next sarsanghchalak. Lower down the scale, the falling attendance in the shakhas is worrisome.

 The one unifying factor in the Sangh is the absence of enthusiasm for the party. Make no mistake. It is not ideological watering down that is the real failing. It is the loss of power and the erosion of support. When in doubt and decline, the parent organisation has always in the past turned back to its taproot.

 That is what it wants to do today. It also seeks a more pliant leadership that will do its bidding. Advani has a hard enough time keeping the morale of his legislators up. He now has to contend with a steady attempt to undermine his own word. In this, if nothing else he can and will get support from his old ally, Vajpayee.

 The last word has not been said in the controversy. The RSS supremo has bitten off more than he can chew. The party, even when out of power is now too large an entity for its top leaders to be harangued in public.

 The larger issues cannot be addressed till the new line-up emerges. A new order cannot congeal as long as the old one is in place. And no one holding office is in a tearing hurry to move on. Sudarshan may have the right prognosis but he lacks the ability to enforce his will. 

 The new tug of war is far from over. The civil wars of the saffron kind have just begun to unfold.

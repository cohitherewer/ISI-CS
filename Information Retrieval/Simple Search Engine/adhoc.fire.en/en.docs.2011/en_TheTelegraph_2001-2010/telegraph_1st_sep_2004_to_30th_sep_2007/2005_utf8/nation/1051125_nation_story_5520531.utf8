 Rain havoc in Tamil Nadu

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Dindigul (Tamil Nadu), Nov. 24: The steady rain that cancelled the Chennai one-dayer against South Africa continues relentlessly, flooding towns and villages and snapping road and rail links in southern Tamil Nadu.

 A year after the ocean turned killer, water is invading homes and threatening lives again in Nagapattinam and Cuddalore, Kanyakumari and Dindigul, having already claimed 11 lives since yesterday and displaced more than a million people.

 The pounding from the sky has been triggered by a near-stationary, low-pressure area over the Gulf of Mannar that weather officials have dubbed tsunami in the air. More rain is predicted in the next 24 hours in the state and neighbouring Pondicherry.

 Its a catastrophe. The states major paddy crop is ruined this year, a farmer from Theni district said. Paddy crops on thousands of hectares are submerged.

 The flash floods ? which follow last months deluge in northern and western Tamil Nadu, including Chennai ? have been caused by the bursting of hundreds of irrigation tanks. In many villages, people are standing in the drenching rain, desperately trying to plug the breaches in the embankments.

 Chennai is better off this time, but excess water released from the nearby Chembarambakkam lake has flooded the low-lying Nesapakkam locality. The river Adayar is in spate, submerging a causeway in Alandur. 

 The battering has damaged national highways, submerged long stretches and washed away bridges and culverts, cutting Madurai off from Chennai as well as Bangalore. 

 Dindigul town was today virtually cordoned off from the rest of the world by a vast sheet of water around it. Long lines of trucks, tankers and cars are stranded or reduced to a crawl on the highways.

 Southbound railway traffic from Chennai has been badly affected with the route between Madurai and the state capital yet to be reopened after a huge boulder fell on the tracks near Dindigul last night. At many other places, the flood waters have swept stretches of tracks away.

 Officials are cautious about reopening tracks in a hurry. They said they did not want to take any chances after the recent train tragedy near Hyderabad, caused by waves of flood water from a breached tank blasting away a rail bridge.

 The Cauvery today took another heavy discharge from the Mettur reservoir, which has overflowed for the fourth time in less than two months. People living in low-lying areas are being evacuated by the district authorities.

 In Cuddalore, where the huge Veeranam lake is overflowing, over 200,000 people living in its downstream areas have been shifted to safety. Some 250 villages are marooned in the district, officials said.

 The other badly hit districts are Sivaganga, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai, Ramanathapuram and Dindigul.

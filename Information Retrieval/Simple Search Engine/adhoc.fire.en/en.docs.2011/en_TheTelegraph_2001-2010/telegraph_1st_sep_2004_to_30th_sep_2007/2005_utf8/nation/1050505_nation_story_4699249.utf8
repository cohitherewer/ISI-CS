 Fardeen: On new stage

 London, May 4 (PTI): Actor Fardeen Khan will get engaged to his London-based girlfriend Natasha here tomorrow. 

 Natasha is the daughter of former Bollywood leading lady Mumtaz and British business tycoon Mayur Madhvani.

 A family source said the date of the wedding is yet to be finalised, adding that a select group of family members and friends will be present at the engagement. 

 Among those likely to attend is Bollywood producer Boney Kapoor, who was associated with Ramgopal Varma?s film Jungle, in which Fardeen starred opposite Urmila Matondkar. 

 Fardeen will sport a handmade, classic formal three-button suit by designer Shaahid Amir for the occasion.

 The son of actor-director Firoz Khan, Fardeen started his career with his father?s Prem Aggan and has acted in films like Dev, Khushi, Fida and Pyar Tune Kya Kiya among others.

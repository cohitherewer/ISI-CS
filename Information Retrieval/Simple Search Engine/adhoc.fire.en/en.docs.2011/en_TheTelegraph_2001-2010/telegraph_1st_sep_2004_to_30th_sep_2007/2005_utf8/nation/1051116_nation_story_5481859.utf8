 Delhi on toes after repeat attack alert

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Diwali scare in Delhi is happening all over again.

 Two weeks after the October 29 blasts, intelligence agencies have intercepted a secret message that a Kashmiri militant outfit is planning to strike in the capital in the next three days.

 Senior Delhi police officers went into a huddle this evening to discuss ways to beef up security. The pre-Diwali strike had killed around 60 people.

 District police have been asked to stay on alert and sensitise people through loudspeakers and public gatherings. They have also been instructed to take the help of the CRPF and CISF for routine patrolling.

 The police are holding meetings with market and hotel associations, owners of guest houses, cinema halls, cyber cafes and PCOs, office bearers of religious places and parking contractors.

 They are not taking any chances as the suspected mastermind of the pre-Diwali blasts, Tariq Ahmed Dar, revealed during questioning that eight other targets, including the Delhi metro and crowded marketplaces, had been shortlisted for attack. Dar is allegedly a Lashkar militant.

 A manhunt is under way for the other militants involved in the blasts. Police sources said it was unlikely that they could have crossed the border as there was heavy army presence because of the LoC five-point opening.

 Besides, Delhi police teams had also been posted on the Jammu and Kashmir, Bangladesh and Nepal borders.

 According to police sources, RDX was smuggled into Delhi in a fruit truck more than a fortnight before the blasts. Security at the Azapur market, the biggest wholesale vegetable market in Delhi, is being overhauled.

 The police are planning to frisk all incoming trucks at the border, including about 150 that come in from Jammu and Kashmir daily. In all, about 15,000 trucks enter the capital from all over India.

 As there have been several instances of terror modules meeting up with associates in this market, the police have decided to take photographs and record personal details of drivers, cleaners and transport agents, specially those operating on the Kashmir route.

 They also plan to check the goods and scan the trucks for false compartments that can be used to smuggle in weapons and hawala money.

 Three persons are understood to have been detained in Srinagar by Delhi police in connection with the blasts, adds PTI. They were picked up on the basis of leads provided by Dar and have been taken to Delhi. Two have been identified as Hanief Ahmed Dar and Imtiaz Ahmed. However, police did not confirm the arrests.

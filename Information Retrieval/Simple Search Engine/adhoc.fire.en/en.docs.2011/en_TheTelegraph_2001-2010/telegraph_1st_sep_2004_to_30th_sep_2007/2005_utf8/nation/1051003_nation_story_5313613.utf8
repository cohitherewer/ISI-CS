 US plea on Dutch fugitive rejected

 New Delhi (PTI):A Delhi court has turned 

 down a request by the US to extradite a Dutch national, 

 who is allegedly an international drug trafficker associated 

 with a gang operating from Atlanta.

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravinder Dudeja declined the request to extradite Louis Hedrick Olyve Marco saying there was no substantive evidence against the Dutch national, who was arrested in May 2003 when he had come for heart treatment at a hospital here.

 There is no evidence except the statements of two other persons who are not being jointly tried with the fugitive, the court said, discharging him from the case initiated by the Indian authorities.

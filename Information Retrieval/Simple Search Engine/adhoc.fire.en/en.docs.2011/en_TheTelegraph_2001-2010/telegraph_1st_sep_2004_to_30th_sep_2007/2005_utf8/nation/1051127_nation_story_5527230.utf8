 Gohana chargesheet

 New Delhi, Nov. 26 (PTI): The CBI has filed a chargesheet in one of the three cases registered in connection with the caste violence at Gohana in Haryanas Sonepat district.

 The case, which pertains to the killing of a shopkeeper, Baljeet Singh, on August 27, was initially registered by Haryana police. It was registered afresh by the CBI following a request by the state government to probe the chain of incidents leading to large-scale violence in Gohana on August 31.

 Nine persons have been booked in connection with the murder, CBI sources said.

 According to the chargesheet, Singh had gone to a studio to get a picture required for his ration card form. However, there was a verbal altercation which led to his murder.

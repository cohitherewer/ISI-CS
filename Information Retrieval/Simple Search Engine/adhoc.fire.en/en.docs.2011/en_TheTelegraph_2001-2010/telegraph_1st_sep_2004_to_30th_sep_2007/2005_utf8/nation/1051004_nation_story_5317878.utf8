 Iran poser for Left

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: The United Progressive Alliance government has hit the Left where it hurts them most.

 They cannot swallow the governments recent decision to back a US-sponsored resolution referring Iran to the UN Security Council. At the same time, they cannot use the decisive weapon in their political armoury ? the threat to withdraw support to the Manmohan Singh government. The Lefts number one political adversary, the BJP, is waiting in the wings to return to power.

 Caught in a bind, leaders of the four Left parties today met at AK Gopalan Bhawan and fell back on the most common form of protest available to them. The Left parties will mobilise democratic opinion all over the country in defence of an independent foreign policy, said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat at the end of the meeting.

 In their effort to broadbase the campaign as much as possible, the Left will contact parties like the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress leaders who are unhappy with the governments decision, non-political organisations and individuals who share its concern.

 The Lefts main objective is to mount pressure on the Manmohan Singh government before it attends a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna in November. The Left wants the government to vote against a resolution on a final decision on referring Iran to the Security Council.

 A convention will be organised in Delhi at the end of October keeping in mind the next IAEA meeting in November, said the Left leaders. The Left parties consider Indias voting for the resolution on Iran a serious departure from an independent foreign policy, they added. The campaign will take off from the Iran issue but focus on the larger one of an independent foreign policy.

 The UPAs common minimum programme assures the government will make a clean break with the foreign policy of its predecessor.

 , the NDA government. The Left says the Prime Ministers decision to back the US resolution is a breach of the assurance. And the UPA must redeem itself by taking a different stand at the Vienna IAEA conference in November.

 But the signal sent out by the government so far does not seem to favour the Left. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has met Left leaders over breakfast at 7, Race Course Road. Singh explained the reasons behind his governments stand but the Left leaders remained unconvinced and told him that they would go ahead with their protest.

 The Left does not have too many options to express its resentment. As the decision on Iran does not have to be ratified in Parliament, the Left ? the third-largest bloc in the Lok Sabha ? cannot stall the policy on the floor of the House. They cannot hold out the final threat of pulling the rug from under the governments feet since that is what the BJP is hoping for.

 In such a situation, the Left leaders have planned to do what they have done so often in the past ? organise seminars, protests and rallies in the hope that the government will do a turnaround.

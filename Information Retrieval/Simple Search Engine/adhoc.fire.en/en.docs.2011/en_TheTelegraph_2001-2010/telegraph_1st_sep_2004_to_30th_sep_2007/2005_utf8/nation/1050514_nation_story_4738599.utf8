The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ray classic comes full circle

 AMIT ROY

 A still from Pather Panchali

 London, May 13: Sharmila Tagore, who was present at last nights screening of Pather Panchali at the Cannes Film Festival, told The Telegraph today: The audience reaction was incredible.

 She said: More than 1,000 people queued for tickets. Apart from one or two Indians, the audience was almost entirely western. Those present included Thierry Fr?maux, president of the festival, and Frank Pearson, president of the Ray Society.

 Back in 1956, the film merited only a midnight screening with many jury members absent. One who was present insisted it be shown again, paving the way for a prize.

 On its return to Cannes half a century later, Sharmila said: We all went up on stage and said a few words.

 Sharmila, who went on to star in the third of the Apu Trilogy, Apur Sansar, described her own feelings and why she thought Pather Panchali had been picked to open the season of classic films in Cannes this year.

 At a personal level, she felt it had been a great privilege and honour to have been picked by Satyajit Ray for the third film in the trilogy and now watching Pather Panchali was a very emotional experience.

 For example, seeing Apus eyes through the torn fabric or Thakurma emptying half her glass of water on a plant, said Sharmila, who now heads the censor board.

 They are the little things. When she dies, you see the plant has grown, to show life moves on. Fifty years after the film was made, it is interesting to see the reaction of the audience, she said. 

 It is an eternal film, in which Manikda (Ray) wanted to capture the struggle of ordinary people, of Apus journey. No doubt, Pather Panchali is culture-specific but it is eternal because it appeals to people all over the world.

 She said some people had asked why Pather Panchali was the only film included in the official selection at Cannes (there are many in the Cannes market). I am not sure why that is so, was her answer. But we will get there. I think it has to do with the marketing of films. We have got to market our films right.

 Sharmila and her party were on their way tonight to enjoy some of the glamour and glitz of Cannes. Ashok Amritraj (the Hollywood producer) is giving a party on a yacht, she said.

 Dilip Basu, coordinator of the Ray Society, who had earlier written about the dark side of Rays struggle to make Pather Panchali, said: Lets forget about the dark side. It was shown in a most beautiful time of 5 pm in a wonderful setting.

 He emphasised: It was a moment of great pride that Pather Panchali opened the season of Cannes Classics.

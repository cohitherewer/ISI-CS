 Gandhi on lips, PM sells reforms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today invoked Mahatma Gandhis concept of self-reliance to defend his governments pro-globalisation reform policies against attacks from his Left partners.

 Referring to Gandhis message of self-reliance and self-respect that inspired him to undertake the Dandi March against the British, the Prime Minister said that for the Father of the Nation, self-reliance meant standing on ones own feet and then dealing with the world with confidence and assurance.

 Addressing a meeting to mark the 75th anniversary of the Dandi March, the Prime Minister said in todays context, the countrys participation in the process of globalisation would enhance self-reliance.

 The idea of self-reliance does not imply pursuing a policy of autarky. It does not mean cutting ourselves away from the world, Singh said.

 We can, indeed, pursue greater self-reliance by creating inter-relationships of inter-dependence that enhance our bargaining power. Greater interaction with the world can, in fact, enhance a nations self-reliance by creating a web of mutually beneficial inter-relationships, the Prime Minister said.

 The countrys freedom fighters would have advocated the same as it would enhance Indias self-reliance and self-respect and ensure that it stood tall in the comity of nations in todays global context, Singh added.

 The Prime ministers agreement with US President George W. Bush last July on bilateral co-operation in the civilian nuclear energy sector had come under strong opposition from the Left partners on the ground that it would stunt the development of the countrys indigenous nuclear programme. 

 Singh said self-reliance in the modern world did not mean that India had to do everything itself. 

 The country cannot pursue the goal of self-reliance by cutting itself from the world, he added.

 I salute Mahatma Gandhi for the courage of his conviction and the power of his symbolism. Holding up a fist of salt from the soil of mother India, Gandhiji made British rule unpalatable. It was a historic moment in the creation of free India, the Prime Minister said.

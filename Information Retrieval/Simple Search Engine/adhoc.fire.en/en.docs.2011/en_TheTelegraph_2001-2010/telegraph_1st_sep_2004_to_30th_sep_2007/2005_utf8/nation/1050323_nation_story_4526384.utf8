The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Law board focus on shariat rights

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, March 22: The Bhopal meet of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board next month will focus on creating awareness on shariat and presenting a united face of the community.

 Board secretary Maulana Abdul Raheem Qureshi told The Telegraph that several Muslims are unaware of their rights and duties according to shariat and the society has misconceptions about its applicability in civil matters.

 ?Even the educated class tends to ignore the significance of shariat courts. It is actually in keeping with the buzzword of decentralisation and strengthening age-old institutions. Why should everyone be rushing to high court and the Supreme Court which are already overburdened and expensive?? asked Qureshi, who was on a visit to oversee the arrangements for the board?s general body meeting here.

 Qureshi said the board was trying hard to set up a national network of dar-ul-qaziat (legal apparatus to settle civil matters according to shariat). ?Let me tell you, there is no clash with the basic tenets of justice and equality. In fact, at times, they tend to be more judicious, as fear of God also influences them,? he said. 

 The maulana from Hyderabad felt that given the socio-economic indicators among Muslims in India, there was a need to make them aware of their rights and duties in civil matters, such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. 

 ?I have little hesitation in admitting that gross ignorance exists among Muslim masses. Some feel that without pronouncing triple talaq, a divorce cannot take place whereas the facts are otherwise. If one has to, the divorce has to be spread over three months and, theoretically speaking, even women have rights to divorce,? he said. 

 The Bhopal board meeting is set to be a stormy affair as it comes at a time when several Muslim sects have floated alternative personal law boards. 

 Qureshi is, however, dismissive about them, pointing out that not a single board member has switched sides. 

 The conclave will clear a model nikaahnama (marriage contract) ? a longstanding demand of liberals and women?s rights groups. The marriage contract details the circumstances under which a marriage can be annulled.

 The move has generally been hailed by all quarters, but many in the law board contend that it has sparked a sharp division. Muslim sects have ample diversity and a sort of codified marriage contract has not gone well with some leaders, they said, resulting in ?mushrooming? of separate Shia, Barelvi and women?s boards.

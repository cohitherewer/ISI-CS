 Ritual stands in Rabris way

 ASHISH SINHA

 Rabri Devi

 Patna, Dec. 21: The inauspicious month of Kharmaas, which ends on January 14 next year, has prevailed over RJD president Lalu Prasads socialist antecedents as his family has almost refused to move into the new bungalow allotted to Rabri Devi, the former chief minister.

 A few days ago, Rabri Devis successor Nitish Kumar, for whose residence officials had selected 1 Anne Marg, had said he did not believe in such semi-religious customs. But today, the chief minister gave up hope and said: They can shift when they want to. Please do not ask me about the house any more.

 Nitish has to perform official work from the state guest house, located close to 1 Anne Marg, and has to go to his flat in a residential area of the city to sleep. The chief minister definitely has difficulties due to the delay but the government does not seem ready to let Lalu Prasad kick up a storm over a non-issue.

 The notice served on Rabri Devi expired yesterday and it was expected that officials of the building construction department would hand over the keys of 10 Circular Road, the new house allotted to her, today. But reporters waiting near the house drew a blank as the officials did not turn up.

 Lalu Prasad has maintained that the new house has not been sufficiently spruced up for his family. The railway minister said they would shift the moment the house was ready. But his aide Bhola Yadav today clarified that they were unlikely to do so during Kharmaas.

 Building construction minister Monazir Hasan also did not sound keen on getting 1 Anne Marg vacated immediately. We will go by the law and expect everyone to obey the rules, he said but did not elaborate.

 Rabri Devi and her family are said to be highly religious and, therefore, they abide by customs and rituals prevalent in Bihar. She used to perform Chhat every year at the mini swimming pool that was added to the 1 Anne Marg bungalow. The family would also put up idols of Goddess Durga on the sprawling campus.

 Busy in the election campaign, the former chief minister did not fast for Chhat this time after several years. 

 A break in Chhat is not good unless you have pressing reasons. I was surprised when she (Rabri Devi) did not observe Chhat this time. See the result, the family is out of power, a homemaker said.

 Lalu Prasad, meanwhile, has put up a stable for his huge herd of cows and buffaloes in Danapur on the outskirts of the capital. These animals were kept in sheds at 1 Anne Marg and the adjoining 5 Desh Ratna Marg, which was allotted to him in his capacity as a former chief minister.

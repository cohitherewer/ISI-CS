 Lalu keeps chin up

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: An election rout cant dampen Lalu Prasads spirits: one day after being swept out of the state he has ruled for 15 years, the deposed king of Bihar was attending a wedding in Delhi this evening.

 His colleague in the Union ministry and rival in Bihar, Ram Vilas Paswan, was not faring quite as well. Reduced to a nobody from being a kingmaker in February, the steel minister was home for most of the day, going to work only after his post-lunch siesta and returning to a quiet dinner with the family.

 Lalu Prasad set off for Delhi from Patna this afternoon by the same Sahara flight that had taken winner Nitish Kumar to the Bihar capital. While Nitish was being mobbed at Patna airport, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief was packing his bags to come to Delhi.

 Unlike Lalu Prasad, who chose to spend the day of his defeat with the people who voted him out, Nitish had celebrated the biggest victory of his political career away from Bihar.

 Lalu Prasads flight landed around 6.10 pm at Delhi airport, from where he was chased to his official bungalow at Tughlaq Road by cameramen and reporters, who managed to get quick sound bites. I have nothing against Ram Vilas Paswan, he said. We accept the peoples verdict with humility.

 Lalu Prasad was accompanied on his flight by minister of state for agriculture Akhilesh Prasad Singh. When he arrived home, party colleague Devender Yadav was there to greet him. His mood was fine. He has definitely moved on, Yadav said. Soon after, Lalu Prasad left to attend a wedding.

 Paswan, who must be ruing the lost chance to rule Bihar, was not partying yet but was not doing too badly either. He was on TV before Nitish yesterday. 

 If I had received the kind of setback Paswan has, I would not have been able to step out of my house for three days. But one has to admire his nonchalance. He was giving sound bites even before Nitish decided to do it, a senior Janata Dal (U) leader said.

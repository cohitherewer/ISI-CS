 Natwar talks pacts 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Singh: Mission Pakistan

 Islamabad, Feb. 15: External affairs minister K. Natwar Singh today set a broad agenda for his bilateral visit to Pakistan on his arrival here, declaring ?co-operation and cordiality between our two countries is imperative and not just a desirable objective?.

 He said India was committed to ?a tension-free, peaceful and co-operative relationship with Pakistan?. 

 In an apparent reference to the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus link and other proposals for road and rail services between the neighbours, Singh said India was looking for new transport links and enhanced trade and economic co-operation with Pakistan. 

 He singled out the proposed gas pipeline from Iran through Pakistan as a major move forward although with a caveat. ?We have also now agreed to consider a pipeline through Pakistan, subject to satisfaction of our concerns related to security and assured supplies,? he said. 

 Singh hoped that in the coming months, several new agreements would be reached. These would include a deal on pre-notification of missile tests, a pact between the coastguards and Pakistan?s Maritime Security Agency to prevent harassment of fishermen and another between the two narcotics control authorities.

 Singh?s is the first bilateral visit by any Indian foreign minister since 1989. This is also the first high-level meeting after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met President Pervez Musharraf in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. 

 The visit has the potential of becoming a historic one, if over the next two days some concrete steps are taken. 

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran said India was looking to the visit to provide ?renewed momentum? to the dialogue process. He hoped it would give the foreign ministers an opportunity to review the process and give direction.

 Singh is scheduled to meet Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri tomorrow. He said he would explore with the leaders ways of strengthening the foundations of co-operative interaction. Such interactions had the ?clearly expressed support of the people of the two countries?. 

 The minister said his government had imparted ?renewed vigour? to ties with Pakistan. While diplomatic and communication links had been restored to previous levels, the composite dialogue was moving forward and additional areas were being addressed.

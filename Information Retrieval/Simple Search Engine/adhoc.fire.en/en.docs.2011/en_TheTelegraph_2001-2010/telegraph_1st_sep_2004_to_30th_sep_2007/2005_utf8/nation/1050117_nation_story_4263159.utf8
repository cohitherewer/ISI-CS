 Sacked staffer gets breather

New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has set aside a public 

sector undertaking?s order relieving an employee of his job after nearly 25 years 

of service.

 The court castigated the National Building Construction Corporation for its ?insensitive? attitude towards chief foreman S.D. Joshi.

 ?A person who has served an employer for almost his entire work life should not be shunted out on technical grounds,? Justice Vikramajit Sen said, setting aside the corporation?s July 2004 order relieving Joshi. The judge advised the corporation to take a ?well-considered decision beneficial to the employee?.

 Joshi had joined the corporation in 1980 on deputation as foreman mechanic from the General Reserve Engineering Force for a two-year period that was extended for a year. He quit his parent organisation in October 1983 on the advice of the corporation as it wanted to absorb him, counsel Kaushal Yadav said. Joshi had approached the court in 1984 after the corporation wanted to repatriate him to the engineering force.

 The court said Joshi had a prima facie case for absorption and directed the corporation in July 1985 to let him continue till the case was decided. Joshi?s petition was dismissed in 2004 for his failure to appear before the court following which the corporation dismissed him.

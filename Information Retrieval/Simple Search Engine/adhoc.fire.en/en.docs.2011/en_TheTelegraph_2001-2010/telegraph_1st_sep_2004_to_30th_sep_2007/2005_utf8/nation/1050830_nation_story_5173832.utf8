 Fringe net cast wide but some slip out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: Employers contribution to superannuation funds, group insurance and mediclaim schemes, which are not government mandated, will be among items attracting a 30 per cent fringe benefit tax.

 Reimbursements for mobile and telephone bills, hotel expenses on clients and customers and subsidies given by companies to schools where its employees children study will also be charged the tax.

 Hours after charges of nepotism against finance minister P. Chidambaram in Parliament, the income-tax department came out with a 39-page note whose purpose is to clear confusion about what comes under the tax, FBT in short. 

 Among those that have been let off are law firms which hire people on retainers instead of paying salaries. These firms do not have to pay FBT or file FBT returns. Similarly, FBT is not payable by trusts or charities whose income is not taxable. A large number of politicians cutting across parties had sought this. 

 No FBT will be levied on leave travel allowance, though free or concessional tickets will be taxable. Childrens education allowance, transport allowance up to Rs 800 are also not covered. 

 Getting off the hook are food vouchers, medical reimbursement paid to employees and fringe benefits given to employees based outside India. 

 There will be no FBT on brokerages and commissions or on wholesale and retail margins, incentives given to dealers or even on credit card bonus points.

 Free samples are excluded, but freebies given as part of sales promotion drives are not. FBT has to be paid on them as they are part of sales promotion, which has been defined as taxable. 

 Entertainment, which is covered by FBT, has been redefined to mean spending on games, sport, exhibition or some other form of entertainment meant to give amusement to employees. Allotments of shares/debentures/warrants is considered taxable, but the clarification states that as these are difficult to calculate, they will not be included. 

 If all this seems very arbitrary, revenue officials beg to disagree. Any facility, privilege or amenity, directly or indirectly given by the employer, any free or concessional tickets for private journeys, or contribution to superannuation fund or other non-statutory benefits are taxable.

 Their argument is that the golden rule is anything which is not covered by the normal income-tax but which is a benefit should be covered by FBT.

 Analysts, however, feel the logic used to keep some expenses out while taxing others may be challengeable. 

 Entertainment, provision of hospitality to any person other than food for employees at factories and offices, conferences, sales promotions (except advertisement expenses), employee welfare (except statutory requirements), conveyance, tours and travel, use of hotel boarding and lodging facilities, repair and running of motor cars, use of clubs and health clubs, festive celebrations and guesthouses are listed as benefits that are to be taxed.

 The rate at which the tax is to be paid varies. The tax assumes that 50 per cent of expenses on guesthouses, conferences, employee welfare and company clubs are perks and should be taxed.

 For telephone expenses, it is assumed that 10 per cent of all calls made from an office is by employees for personal reasons and tax should be imposed on this portion. For fuel, the extent of personal use by employees has been assumed at 20 per cent.

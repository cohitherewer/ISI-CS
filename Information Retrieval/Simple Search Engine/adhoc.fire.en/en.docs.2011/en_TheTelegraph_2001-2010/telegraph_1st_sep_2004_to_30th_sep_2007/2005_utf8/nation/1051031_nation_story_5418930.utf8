The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Multi-culture poster girl set for Lords 

 AMIT ROY

 Verma: Breakthrough

 London, Oct. 30: Enoch Powell must be turning in his grave. To add insult to injury, as his followers will see it, an Indian woman who represented his old seat, Wolverhampton South-West, for the Conservative Party at the last general elections has been elevated to the peerage, it was reported today.

 Sandip Verma, 45, an Indian businesswoman from Leicester, who put up a creditable performance in the June general elections ? she polled 15,610 votes to Labours 18,489 ? is to go to the House of Lords when the next Honours List is published shortly, according to todays Independent on Sunday.

 The paper has been leading a campaign against people deemed to have got peerages through generous party political donations. But Sandip Verma ? or Sandy Verma as she now styles herself ? provides home help to elderly folk and does not quite fall in this category.

 The paper couples her name with two Tory donors today: The Tory party treasurer, Jonathan Marland, who has given almost ?110,000 to the party, has also been recommended for a peerage. David James, the trouble-shooter brought in to stop the Dome going into receivership and who drew up the Tory blueprint for cutting costs in Whitehall before the election, is to be made a peer. Sandip Verma, a businesswoman who fought Wolverhampton South-west for the Tories at the last election, also gets a peerage.

 There was clearly an irony about Verma representing Wolverhampton South-West for the Tories since this had once been Powells constituency.

 Powell argued not only against primary immigration from New Commonwealth countries but also against the inflow of dependants.

 In 15 or 20 years, on present trends, there will be in this country three-and-a-half million Commonwealth immigrants and their descendants, he said in a speech in 1968.

 It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre, he said.

 Had he left it at that, he might have got away with it but in his now notorious speech, he recommended repatriation and appeared to forecast race riots: As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding.? Like the Roman, I seem to see, the RiverTiber foaming with much blood.

 The next day, he was sacked from the Tory front bench by the party leader, Edward Heath.

 For the Tories to be now represented in the Lords by an Indian woman who had stood in Powells old seat is intended to send out the message that the party has changed to reflect the reality of multicultural Britain.

 Verma came to Britain from Amritsar with her parents when she was less than a year old in 1960. 

 The Guardian once said: Verma finds herself the poster girl for Britains multicultural success story, and a walking two-fingers to the more inglorious sections of her partys past.

 The Tories would like more Asian men and women in Parliament. So far, they have only Shailesh Vara, a Gujarati from Uganda, in the Commons. Verma joins the other Asian women in the Lords ? Shreela Flather (Tory), Pola Uddin (Labour), Ushar Prashar (Independent) and Kishwar Faulkner (Liberal Democrat). 

 Vermas view is: The first generation of British Asians laid the groundwork for us to be more ambitious. But I dont know if I bring anything distinctively Asian to my career, Im just me.

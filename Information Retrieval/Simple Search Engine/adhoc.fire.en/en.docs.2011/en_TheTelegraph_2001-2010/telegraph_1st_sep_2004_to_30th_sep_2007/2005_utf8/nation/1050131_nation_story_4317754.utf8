 Burnt bus show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Jan. 30: The Congress government in Andhra Pradesh paraded buses damaged in last week?s mob violence in a move similar to the earlier regime?s anti-Naxalite campaign.

 Some years ago, then chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party had paraded maimed victims of extremist violence to trigger a wave of public protest against the Maoists.

 The Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government today showcased around 38 burnt and damaged government buses on Hyderabad?s thoroughfares to sensitise people against the destruction of public property.

 The vehicles on show were among the 85 burnt and 557 damaged in the mob violence that followed the killing of Desam legislator P. Ravindra in Anantpur town last Monday.

 Transport officials and workers, holding placards that condemned violence, accompanied the vehicles on foot. ?What have I done to deserve such a burning?? said a placard on a burnt bus. Another said: ?Please don?t target me.?

 ?If I die, 70 employees will lose their jobs and nearly 2,000 will lose their daily income,? read the inscription on a bus.

 The Desam, whose workers were said to have spearheaded the violence, dismissed the government campaign.

 Desam chief Naidu said the anguish of the people was responsible for the damage to public property. ?You cannot describe it as a party action,? he said.

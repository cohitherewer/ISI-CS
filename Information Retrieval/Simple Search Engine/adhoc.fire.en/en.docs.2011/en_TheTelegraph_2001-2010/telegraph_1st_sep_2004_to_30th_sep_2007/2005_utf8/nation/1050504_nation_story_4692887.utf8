 Naidu gains in shuffle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Advani 

New Delhi, May 3: BJP president L.K. Advani reallocated work areas of party general secretaries this evening, even as his authority was constantly challenged by the RSS and a section of his party.

 Arun Jaitley, who was given joint command of Assam with Pramod Mahajan in the run-up to next year?s Assembly elections and was set to leave for the state this weekend with his colleague, has been put in charge of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry.

 Mahajan will now be the sole prabhari (in-charge) of Assam.

 Rajnath Singh has been put in charge of Bengal, while Ananth Kumar, the prot?g? of Mahajan and vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu, has been put in charge of Kerala.

 The biggest gainer in this reshuffle is Naidu, who is considered closest to Advani in the present set-up. The former party president has been put in overall charge of the three southern poll-bound states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry.

 The changes by themselves may not appear significant, given the assessment that barring Assam the BJP?s stakes are not high in the states going to polls in 2006.

 However, sources maintained that the changes reflect the realignment of equations between Advani and his team members in the wake of the controversy sparked off by RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan?s advice to the BJP leadership to make way for the younger generation.

 The RSS was reportedly unhappy with Advani for reinducting Naidu in the organisation. That the BJP president has assigned major responsibilities to him has made it clear he is in no mood to bend before the RSS leader.

 The general secretaries, including Sanjay Joshi who is in charge of the organisation, will meet in Kochi on May 25 and 26 for a ?brainstorming? session that is expected to take stock of the developments, post the Sudarshan interview.

 Naqvi apology

 BJP party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has offered an ?explanation-cum-apology? for the remarks he made about Advani in Rampur last week.

 Naqvi had then said the BJP would fight the next Lok Sabha elections under a leader from the second generation and not the BJP president or former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 Today, Naqvi ?clarified? with Advani, in a 30-minute one-to-one meeting with the BJP president in his Parliament chamber, that he did not want to create any confusion or controversy, sources said.

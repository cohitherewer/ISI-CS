 Big brother by side, Iraq woos India

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The new Iraqi regime, nudged by the US, today took its first step to woo India in helping Baghdad rebuild the country and make it ?democratic?. 

 Muayad S. Hussein, the Iraqi charge d?affaires in Delhi who has been here for some weeks, appealed to India for help to Baghdad.

 With the American ambassador to India David Mulford by his side, Hussein listed the ?opportunities? for India in the new Iraqi scenario and clarified that the Indian business community would be able to ?re-establish? its old position.

 ?Today, economy drives politics, which should be understood by one and all,? Hussein said, reading from a prepared statement in his first news conference in India. 

 ?India,? he said, ?had been very actively involved in constructing Iraqi economy during last several decades. Indians have long experience in working in that region and Iraq can benefit from their expertise in various fields ? construction, engineering, oil exploration and information technology.?

 Mulford clarified that the US had not made any request to India since June 30, 2003, when it had turned down his country?s call for troops to Iraq, but had kept Delhi informed about developments there. ?What happens now is between India and the Iraqi government,? he said.

 Mulford?s attempt to distance himself from the Iraqi offers notwithstanding, his presence beside Hussein was a clear indicator that Washington had endorsed Baghdad?s plan. 

 One reason why the US is keen to get India on board ? especially after the January 30 polls in Iraq ? is to get its support for the current move and thus rally many other countries to help democratise Iraq.

 India has welcomed the election but said it was still closely watching the evolving situation in Iraq.

 Mulford did not miss the opportunity to underline the Iraq poll?s clear message to sceptics who doubted whether polls could be held there. ?It is time to respect the accomplishment of this election and embrace its implications.?

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran has emphasised that India would not send its workers back for reconstruction work in Iraq unless Delhi is convinced of a marked improvement in the security situation there.

 Almost echoing the US, Hussein said: ?Last Sunday, the world witnessed an unprecedented election in Iraq where a large number of voters used their political franchise for the first time in more than 50 years, despite threats from the hardline elements.?

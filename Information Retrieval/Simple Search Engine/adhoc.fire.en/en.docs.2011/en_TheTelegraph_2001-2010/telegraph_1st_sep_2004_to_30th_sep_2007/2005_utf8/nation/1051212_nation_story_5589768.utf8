 $100-m aid for vaccine project 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) will offer India $100 million over the next five years to help deliver life-saving vaccines to children and improve vaccine delivery services, alliance officials announced on Friday.

 They also announced that the Indian government has picked Calcutta, Chandigarh and Vellore for a $9-million project to gauge the prevalence of meningitis and pneumonia caused by the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria, a life-threatening microbe.

 The funding for 2006-10 is more than double the $40 million that Gavi provided India in the last five years, the officials said at the end of a partners meeting of this public-private alliance trying to make vaccines accessible to the worlds children.

 Its up to India on how to use the funding, Dr Julian Lob-Levyt, Gavis executive secretary said. Since its launch five years ago, with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Gavi has supported the basic immunisation of 13 million additional children in 70 countries to protect them from diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, the medical term for whooping cough.

 Around the world over the past five years, the Gavi alliance has also supported the immunisation of over 120 million children with new-generation vaccines against hepatitis B, yellow fever, and Hib.

 Gavi funding helped India introduce auto-disable syringes into the immunisation programme earlier this year. With support from the alliance, India also added the hepatitis B vaccination into the free immunisation programme in 33 districts and 15 cities. 

 The health ministry has said the hepatitis B programme will be expanded to 11 states to cover 11 million newborns each year.

 Indian officials at the meeting said the Hib probe project in Calcutta, Chandigarh, and Vellore is intended to provide information on the prevalence of Hib disease in India and help the government determine whether it needs to support Hib vaccination.

 While Hib vaccines are currently available in India, they are expensive. Paediatricians now recommend Hib only to infants of parents who can afford to pay for the vaccines. 

 The Hib probe study is expected to provide data on prevalence to help the government decide whether there is need to include Hib to the free immunisation programme, said Nirmal Ganguly, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research.

 Hib causes meningitis and pneumonia in nearly three million children around the world and kills about 400,000, mainly children under five. 

 In developed countries, Hib has been virtually eliminated through vaccination. Health experts said it remains a serious threat in developing countries. 

 There is not enough data in India on the incidence, but we know its here, Ganguly said.

 The National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases in Calcutta will be part of the Hib study that will try to find out the prevalence of Hib disease per 100,000 population.

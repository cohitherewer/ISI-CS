 New Delhi, March 3: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s summons to Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi to explain the developments in the state is within the ?constitutional realm and jurisdiction? of the President, according to legal experts. 

 The governor?s swearing in Shibu Soren as chief minister, ignoring the claim of the single largest pre-poll alliance, the National Democratic Alliance, has given rise to an ?unprecedented? situation, the experts said.

 Justice Rajendra Sachar, former chief justice of Delhi High Court, said the President ?may even withdraw his pleasure so that the Jharkhand governor is recalled?. Under the Constitution, governors are in office ?during the pleasure? of the President and can be recalled or made to resign for constitutional impropriety. 

 Justice Sachar said the guidelines of the Supreme Court that the single largest pre-poll alliance should be invited to form the government and be allowed to prove its strength on the floor of the House have been flouted in Jharkhand.

 Echoing this, the former president of the Supreme Court bar association and senior counsel, M.N. Krishnamani, said the guidelines are binding on all authorities ? in this case, the governor ? and their violation has led to constitutional impropriety in Jharkhand. 

 The judge made it clear that the floor of the House is the correct forum to prove the strength of a coalition or a party, and not Raj Bhavan. 

 The experts said the single largest pre-poll alliance or the single largest party, whichever has the highest numbers, should be invited to form the government and be given the first opportunity to prove its strength within a ?reasonable? time.

 Both Justice Sachar and Krishnamani pointed out that the 23 days given to Soren to prove his strength is too long and ?definitely not within the reasonable time? that the guidelines mention.

 Justice Sachar also said that ?once the NDA parades the five MLAs before the President (as they had done before Razi), they would have made a point that the governor had ignored their claim?. 

 Both agreed that the President has no role to play in either inviting a group or party to form the government in any state nor does he act on his own to advise a governor. However, he can certainly seek explanation from a governor. 

 Justice Sachar pointed out that the ?bone of contention? is whether the five Independent legislators support the NDA or the United Progressive Alliance. 

 With the NDA parading the Independents and the other MLAs before the President this evening, Kalam has had an opportunity to get one side of the story before he meets Razi tomorrow.

 Aiyar push to gas pipeline

 Dhaka, Sept. 5: India is moving ahead with its plan to import natural gas from Myanmar through a pipeline via Bangladesh, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said today.

 My impression is that things are moving forward, he told reporters after a meeting with Bangladesh foreign minister M. Morshed Khan.

 Aiyar, who arrived here early in the morning on a short visit and was in a wheelchair because of an injured foot, said the three countries have appreciated the importance of the $2-billion project in strengthening economic ties.

 Bangladesh foreign secretary Hemayetuddin later said Aiyars visit was not specifically centred on the energy issue only.

 He said Aiyars talks with Bangladesh leaders covered a wide range of bilateral relations and expansion of cooperation. It was a goodwill visit and I think the purpose has been served.

 Hemayetuddin said Aiyar raised the pipeline issue during his talks with the Bangladesh foreign minister and the two discussed how it could advance the economic development of their countries.

 Once complete, the 290-km pipeline would connect Myanmars Shwe gas field in Sittwe in the western Arakan state with Calcutta.

 Indian sources said the pipeline could be ready in five years if Bangladesh agrees to take part in the project. Bangladesh has yet to formally agree, though it took part in the preliminary official-level talks held in Myanmar.

 Official sources said Dhaka has put forward some conditions for New Delhi before it formally gets involved. It wants India to provide transit facility so that it can access hydro-electricity from Nepal and Bhutan through Indian territory and a corridor for unhindered trade with the two countries. India feels trade issues should not be linked to the gas pipeline.

 Aiyar also met Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, finance minister M. Saifur Rahman and the governments energy adviser, Mahmudur Rahman.

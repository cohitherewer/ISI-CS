 Srinagar, July 19: The stage was set for an early and dignified return of Kashmiri Pundits after a delegation from the migrant community and moderate Hurriyat leaders resolved to work together to restore the Valleys eclectic composition.

 The joint statement issued at the end of the daylong meeting, the first between the separatist leaders and the minority community, also endorsed the peace process between India and Pakistan.

 Forty-four Pundit leaders travelled from winter capital Jammu to the Rajbagh headquarters of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference and found prominent leaders, including chairman Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, waiting with garlands.

 Many prominent Pundit leaders, however, stayed away, blaming the separatists for their plight.

 The joint statement said the return of the migrants with a deeper sense of security and dignity requires a favourable environment, for which the APHC, along with other sensible elements, will endeavour to discharge their duty as effectively as is possible.

 On their part, the Pundit intellectuals will also contribute towards the forward movement as handsomely as is needed, the statement added.

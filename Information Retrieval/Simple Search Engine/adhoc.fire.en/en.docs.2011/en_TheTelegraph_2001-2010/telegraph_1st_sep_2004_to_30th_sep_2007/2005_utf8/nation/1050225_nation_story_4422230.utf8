 Kudos, for job well done

 Rao: Man on the move. Picture by Deepak Kumar

 Patna, Feb. 24: The man whose fan following in Bihar has grown by leaps and bounds loves to laugh at his own jokes. 

 The affection is natural because K.J. Rao, the Election Commission?s consultant, is seen as the man who brought about a change in the image of Bihar and ensured smooth Assembly elections, which concluded yesterday. 

 The polls were not just free and fair with low incidence of violence but were even held in an atmosphere where fear was not a factor.

 But ask Rao and he would say he was just doing his job as assigned by the commission. ?I had nothing in my mind?the foundation for my actions was laid by the cases of violation of the model code of conduct,? he told The Telegraph from Delhi.

 The poll panel consultant would not say it but the fact remains that the ?foundation? for the code violation was laid by the ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal, which allegedly misused the privilege of its being the ruling party in the wake of its December 23 rally in Patna. Two days before the show, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav cancelled it, blaming it on a ?conspiracy? by his opponents.

 Rao landed in the capital and after a thorough investigation, ordered the lodging of a large number of cases against the RJD, whose leaders went in a tizzy removing billboards and hoardings. But the damage had been done by then.

 Rao gave a dressing down to then district magistrate Gautam Goswami, who quit his job only to offer his services to a leading corporate house, before substantive action could be initiated against him. Laloo Prasad was again caught off guard when he was caught on camera distributing cash among some voters.

 ?We did a lot of planning. We had an image that criminals and booth-grabbers would go out of their way to influence the elections in Bihar. The force deployment plan was intricately chalked out and properly implemented. The directive that electronic voting machines would not be distributed unless the patrolling magistrate was fully satisfied also made a difference,? the consultant said.

 The Election Commission?s contention that a high voting percentage would prima facie raise doubts about the fairness of the poll was well-timed.

 ?The threshold for a scrutiny of polling was progressively brought down from 70 per cent in the first phase to 65 per cent in the third round. One observer was deployed in each constituency and they were properly briefed on the objective. The message we wanted to send out was loud and clear,? he said.

 Rao visited almost all districts to ensure full preparedness for the elections. ?This helped us distinguish the competent district magistrates and superintendents of police from the inefficient ones. I sent my recommendations to the Election Commission, which got new officials posted in some districts,? he said.

 Rao?s enthusiasm led to the filing of a public interest litigation in Patna High Court. ?There were some hurdles but it was expected. The judge went on to praise my services,? he said.

 The consultant made full use of a helicopter to hop from one place to another on the polling day. It was another first in the turbulent election history of Bihar.

 ?I thought I should be mobile. I went to four districts in each phase and spent an average of two hours everywhere. I would say the Bihar elections have gone off very well,? he said.

 The Election Commission had stationed Rao in Jammu and Kashmir during the entire stretch of polls in that state. ?That was an excellent experience and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Kashmir story fixed the standards for me in Bihar. My motto was clear as crystal,? he said, offering a modest ?thank you? in reply to the ?congratulations? on achieving nearly the impossible in Bihar.

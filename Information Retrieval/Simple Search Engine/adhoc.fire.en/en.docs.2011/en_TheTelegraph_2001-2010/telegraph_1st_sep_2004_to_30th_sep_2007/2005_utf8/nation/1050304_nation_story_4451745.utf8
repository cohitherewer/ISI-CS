 Gujarat ?harmony? plan runs into justice hurdle

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, March 3: A ?reconciliation? formula proposed for Gujarat has run into opposition from rights activists and riot victims.

 Advocate Mukul Sinha of Jan Sangharsh Manch, who has been defending riot victims and those accused under the Prevention of Terrorism Act as well as cross-examining officials and political leaders on their role in the riots before the Nanavati Commission, came up with the ?reconciliation? proposal.

 Sinha suggests that the accused in all riot cases ? except those charged with murder and rape ? be discharged. Muslims should withdraw minor cases ? relating to arson and looting ? and the government, in turn, should withdraw anti-terror law charges. Most people charged under it belong to the minority community.

 The idea came up after talks with 40 maulvis in the city, Sinha claims, and has the support of the NGO Action Aid, which worked for communal harmony at the grassroots after the riots, and relatives of some anti-terror law accused.

 Jakia Jowher of Action Aid believes a process of ?healing and reconciliation?? will start once the Muslim community and the government respond favourably to what, at this juncture, is ?just an idea??.

 But others disagree. Social activist Hanif Lakdawala says the move for reconciliation should come from the perpetrators of violence and they should show remorse, which is now missing. ?They want Muslims to forget how they were attacked three years ago, but they themselves want to remember a 1,000-year-old incident of attack on the Somnath temple,? he says.

 But Jowher claims that those opposing the proposal haven?t understood it. The idea is to initiate a dialogue between the communities, especially in those villages in Anand and Panchmahal districts where Muslims have not returned even three years after the riots. ?We want Muslims to withdraw cases if the Hindus agree to bring them back with dignity and allow them to stay in their native villages,? she says.

 Lakdawala points out that the fact that residents of Gulbarg society in Ahmedabad, where 39 people including former MP Ehsan Jafri were killed, have served notices to the BJP and the VHP claiming damages of Rs 64 crore, shows that the victims want justice.

 Jafri?s son Tanvir agrees. ?The very idea of reconciliation without punishing the perpetrators (of violence) is absurd. If the culprits go unpunished, such incidents will never stop,? he says.

 Jamat-e-Islam leader Shakeel Ahmed, whose son was arrested under the anti-terror law, agrees. ?Reconciliation without justice has no meaning. It amounts to humiliation and we do not want to surrender before the fascist forces responsible for the genocide.?? 

 The VHP is in a spot. It had disowned about 2,000 of its lower-level activists, mostly Dalits, accused in the riots. If the reconciliation proposal is accepted, they will be freed along with 200 anti-terror law accused through Sinha?s efforts.

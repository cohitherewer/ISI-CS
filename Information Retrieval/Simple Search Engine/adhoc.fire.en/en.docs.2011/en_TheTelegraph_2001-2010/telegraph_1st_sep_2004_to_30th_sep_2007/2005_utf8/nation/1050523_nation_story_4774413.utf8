 Annan bid for truce on UN council

 United Nations, May 22 (PTI): Kofi Annan has called a joint meeting of the Group of Four nations, including India, and another group led by Pakistan and Italy tomorrow in a bid to bring about a compromise on the expansion of the Security Council.

 The UN secretary-general, diplomats said, apparently decided to call the meeting of the G-4 nations that include India, Brazil, Germany and Japan, which are seeking permanent membership, and the Uniting for Consensus, led by Pakistan and Italy, after the latter sought his intervention to bring about a compromise.

 However, it was unclear whether the Pakistan-led group would be flexible on its demand that there should be no expansion in the permanent membership of the Security Council.

 A major concession by one of the groups would be needed for Annans efforts to succeed. The G-4 is seeking expansion in both permanent and non-permanent membership but the other group wants an expansion in the non-permanent category only.

 The G-4 framework resolution circulated last week calls for the enlargement of the Security Council from 15 to 25 members, including six more permanent members.

 Diplomats said envoys of the Pakistan-led group complained to Annan that the G-4 nations were using his name to promote their viewpoint. They were apparently referring to Annans remarks that consensus is preferable but should not be used as a means to block the expansion of the council.

 The G-4 advocates a similar position but the UFC wants the expansion to happen only on the basis of consensus. 

 Diplomats said Annan confirmed that his position was that the issue should be decided by the 191-member General Assembly by vote as the last resort.

 Earlier, assembly president Jean Ping had called the meeting of the two groups ? at the request of the UFC. 

 But the UFC now feels that the announcement of a timetable by the G-4 to move three resolutions on increasing permanent and non-permanent members has pre-empted the effort by Ping to bring about a compromise.

 After the meeting, Pakistans UN ambassador Munir Akram said Annan agreed that all possible efforts should be made to bring about an understanding between the groups.

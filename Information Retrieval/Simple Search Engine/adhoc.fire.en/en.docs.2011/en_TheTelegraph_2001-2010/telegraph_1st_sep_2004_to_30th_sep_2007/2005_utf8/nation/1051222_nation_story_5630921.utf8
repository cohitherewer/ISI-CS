The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bonfire of war medals

 GAJINDER SINGH 

 Chandigarh, Dec. 21: The burning torch at New Delhis Amar Jawan Jyoti is meant to honour just the sort of soldier that Capt C.S. Sidhu was, fighting the 1971 war with one arm.

 On December 28, the retired officer is likely to light a flame of his own before the monument ? by making a bonfire of the six medals he had won in the service of the nation.

 It will be the decorated war veterans protest against the armys refusal to hand him his disability pension dues.

 Two other disabled ex-soldiers, Capt (retd) K.J.S. Buttar and Capt (retd) Reet M.P. Singh ? a Vir Chakra winner in the 1965 conflict with Pakistan ? both facing pension problems, will accompany him.

 Sidhu, commissioned in the 5th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment on November 22, 1968, lost his arm in a landslide on the Tibet border in 1970 that killed his immediate senior and a driver. He continued to serve the army for eight more years with his certified 80 per cent disability, taking part in the Bangladesh war and manning posts in Jammu and Kashmir.

 But after his release in 1978, the army calculated my pension on the basis of just two years and five months of service ? the period before the accident, Sidhu told The Telegraph.

 He appealed to the authorities citing the Service Emolument Act. Section 7 of the act states that an emergency commission officer or short-service commission officer with a disability of 80 per cent or more should be considered on a par with regular officers in the matter of service emoluments and disability pension. But my pleas were ignored.

 In 2003, Sidhu approached Punjab and Haryana High Court, where a division bench ruled in his favour, directing the principal controller of defence accounts, Allahabad, to take his entire period of service in consideration. Sidhu was then informed by the army that the finance ministry had granted his pension.

 But the file went missing at Army headquarters. I filed a contempt petition in the high court after waiting for a year, following which the army informed me it had received the Presidents sanction to carry out the court order, he said.

 The army deposited Rs 3.62 lakh in my account, only to withdraw it four days later, having decided to file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the high court order.

 Sidhu wrote to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on November 26, but is yet to receive a reply.

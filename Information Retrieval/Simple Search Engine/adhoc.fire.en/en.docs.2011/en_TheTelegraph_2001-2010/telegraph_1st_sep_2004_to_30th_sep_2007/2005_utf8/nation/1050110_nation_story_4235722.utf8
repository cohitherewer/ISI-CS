TREMORS

 Hong Kong (AP): A Hong Kong-based Briton survived 

 the tsunami that devastated Thailand?s coastlines by abandoning 

 a pregnant woman clinging to him and later smashing his 

 knee cap when his leg was trapped underwater, a newspaper 

 reported on Sunday.

 Scotsman Andrew Keith, 35, was swept away by the waves that inundated the Thai resort island of Phra Thong and found himself weighed down by a pregnant Swedish woman who wrapped her arms around him, the South China Morning Post reported.

 ?It was like being in a washing machine. We were being tumbled over and over under the water. As the pressure of the water got more intense, her grip just kept getting tighter and tighter,? Keith said after returning to Hong Kong. He then pried her hands off and floated to the surface, says the report. 

 Keith said he?s still haunted by the decision. ?I still can?t really think about what happened. For the first few days, it played very heavily on my mind. But there wasn?t anything I could do.?

 The woman, identified as Thisbee Ander, and her husband Thomas were later found dead, the paper reports.

 Male (AFP): The Maldives has blamed scientists 

 for not sharing information that could have reduced the 

 tsunami destruction in Asia as UN secretary-general Kofi 

 Annan arrived here on the last leg of a tour to the affected 

 areas. Foreign minister Fathulla Jameel said the death and 

 damage could have been minimised if authorities had been 

 alerted when the tsunamis began after an undersea earthquake 

 near Indonesia. ?The research and information are there. 

 But unfortunately, the international scientific community 

 works in strange ways. They do not want to share their information 

 with us,? he said. ?No one told us about the tsunami. We 

 were hit one and half hours after Sri Lanka. No one alerted 

 us. Sri Lanka itself was hit several hours after the quake 

 and I presume no one told them either.?

 Nagapattinam (PTI): The sea has gone calm since 

 the tsunami took thousands of lives in this coastal district 

 of Tamil Nadu on December 26. But for the farmers here, 

 the after-effect of the tragedy is yet to unfold. Around 

 half-a-kilometre inside the coastline, about 9,567 hectares 

 of agricultural land have become unfit for cultivation as 

 sea water has flooded the paddy and groundnut fields. ?Beside 

 causing crop loss, it has adversely affected the horticulture 

 produce here, with more than 9,500 hectares being filled 

 up with sand and salt water brought in by the waves,? the 

 district collector said.

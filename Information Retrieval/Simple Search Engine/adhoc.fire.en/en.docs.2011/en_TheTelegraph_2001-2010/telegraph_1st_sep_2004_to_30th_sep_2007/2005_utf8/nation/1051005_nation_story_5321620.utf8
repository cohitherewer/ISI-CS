 Kanchi plea

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Kanchi acharya Jayendra Saraswati has appealed before the Supreme Court saying there are enough grounds to transfer the Shankar Raman murder case outside Tamil Nadu. The seer is the prime accused in the case.

 Senior counsel Fali Nariman today appeared for him and told the division bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur that chief minister Jayalalithaa was evincing keen interest in the case and this was prejudicial to a free and fair trial.

 Nariman cited an application from the Tamil Nadu government in which it had said the acharya should not be allowed to reside in any of the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh or in Pondicherry as he would tamper with evidence and influence witnesses. 

 The senior counsel asked that when the state government itself did not want the pontiff to remain anywhere in the south, how could the trial continue there?

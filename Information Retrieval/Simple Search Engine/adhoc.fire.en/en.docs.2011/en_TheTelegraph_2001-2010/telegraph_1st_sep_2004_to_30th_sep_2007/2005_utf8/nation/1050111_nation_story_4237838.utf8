 Dadan arrest after cop ?invite?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 10: Timing it well, state Samajwadi Party president Dadan Singh Pehalwan today ?invited? the police to arrest him and was subsequently taken into custody during an election rally at Dumraon in Buxar district.

 Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh was with Pehalwan during the arrest.

 The Independent Dumraon MLA, who later joined Mulayam Singh Yadav?s party, was wanted by the police in connection with a group clash with local Congress leader Munna Tiwari in October last year. He had been evading arrest and had even gone underground recently.

 Two days ago, Pehalwan had announced that he would ?surrender? in Dumraon today. The reason why he did so was a recent directive of Patna High Court on not permitting any ?absconder? to file nomination papers for next month?s Assembly elections.

 ?Today was the first day of nomination and he courted arrest so that he gets bail on time to campaign for the elections. Besides, the arrest in full public view will send the right signals to his supporters in the district,? sources close to the Samajwadi Party leader said.

 The party has been trying to cobble up a ?third front? in Bihar with the CPI-ML and some other smaller parties. Pehalwan, a popular Yadav leader of the Buxar-Bhojpur belt, is, however, not seen as a force that will make much difference in the Bihar elections, unless he aligns with any of the larger groups. 

 Dumraon goes to the polls during the first phase on February 3.

 The Samajwadi Party had garnered impressive votes in some constituencies in the Lok Sabha elections. ?The real reason why we have been trying to make inroads into Bihar is to counter Laloo Prasad Yadav in our own limited ways. We expect to win at least 10 seats in the elections,? a party leader said.

 Pehalwan was a minister in the Rabri Devi government but he was dropped after he contested the parliamentary elections from Buxar against Shivanand Tiwari, the RJD?s official nominee.

 Pehalwan has been overtly appealing to the Yadav voters of west Bihar, moving on a rath depicting Lorik, the mythological deity of the caste in that part of the state. 

 Even after arrest warrants had been issued against him, he managed to hold a few rallies in different parts of the state but turned cautious after the police sincerely went in his pursuit.

 The MLA has been spewing venom against the Rashtriya Janata Dal, while refraining from making personal attacks on party chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.

 Scanner on Jaya case clubbing

 New Delhi: The Supreme 

 Court has stayed trial in a disproportionate assets case 

 against Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa and her 

 friend N. Sasikala to decide whether it would be right to 

 club with it the case of buying a hotel in London, reports 

 our legal correspondent.

 DMK leader K. Anbazhagan had filed 

 a petition contending that the special court in Bangalore 

 trying the assets case could even pass an order discharging 

 them from the case and hence the trial should be stayed 

 and the issue of clubbing the cases should be decided first.

 A case involving a London hotel has been clubbed with the Rs 66.65-crore disproportionate assets case as the hotel purchased allegedly by ADMK leader Dhinakaran as a benami property of Jayalalithaa also constituted part of the assets disproportionate to the known sources of the accused, the petitioners counsel said.

 The Bangalore special court said: There 

 has to be one trial as the amassing of wealth is for the 

 same period.

 Seer for trial shift by Aug 

 16

 New Delhi: The Supreme 

 Court has asked Jayendra Saraswati to come with an ?appropriate 

 application? seeking transfer of his trial in the Shankar 

 Raman murder case and the Radhakrishnan assault case outside 

 Tamil Nadu, reports our legal correspondent. 

 The Kanchi acharyas counsel, R. Krishnakumar, told the court that the case should be transferred outside the state before August 16, when the Tamil Nadu court will resume his trial after the summer vacation. 

 In an earlier petition, the seer had complained that the Tamil Nadu chief minister was taking undue interest in and personally monitoring the way the prosecution was building up the case. 

 Punjabi plea

 Islamabad (PTI): An Indian 

 lawyer will file a petition in the Pakistan supreme court 

 to expunge remarks made by two British judges in 1925 casting 

 aspersions on the Punjabi community, after successfully 

 doing so in the Indian apex court.

 The judges had described Punjabis as prone to tell lies, while delivering a ruling in a murder case. 

 Film certificate

 Chennai: Madras High Court 

 has directed the censor board to ?revoke the certification? 

 of a Tamil film, New, starring Simran, as it conveyed nothing 

 but ?vulgarity?, reports our special correspondent. It was 

 released in 2004.

 Freedom fighters

 of the All India Freedom Fighters Organisation have urged 

 the Prime Minister to clear over 600 cases of pension lying 

 with the home ministry. They also sought an increase in 

 their honourary pension.

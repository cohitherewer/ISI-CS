 Home truths for American

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, March 12: Head clean-shaven, sporting round-rimmed glasses and clad in white dhoti, Bernie Mayer had tried to pay tribute to Gandhi in his own little way. But his good intentions all but made a joke of him.

 ?Abey, Gandhi kahaan se aa gaya (Hey, where?s Gandhi sprung up from)?? yelled a student of Lucknow University as the 67-year-old American stepped on to the campus yesterday afternoon, in time to address a workshop on Gandhi.

 ?Bhaiyya, agar Gandhi aaya ho to Godse ko bulao (Brother, if Gandhi?s landed, send for Godse too),? sneered another as the Roman Catholic priest walked past with a stick in hand, escorted by two students and a teacher of the history department.

 ?Haan, tabhi to tamaasha pura hoga (Yeah, only then will the circus be complete),? chipped in another, poking more fun at the priest who has been a staunch follower of Gandhi?s philosophy of non-violence and satyagraha since the sixties.

 The priest had flown all the way down to Gandhi?s own country to taste life first-hand and spread the teachings of the man he revered so much.

 BJP keeps hope alive on pact with Paswan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 2: The Bharatiya Janata Party today claimed that doors had yet not been slammed on the scope of the NDA aligning with Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party for the February Bihar election.

 Party vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi said the NDA has authorised senior Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar to hold talks with Paswan and ?positive progress? has been made in this regard.

 The LJP leader, a minister in the Manmohan Singh government, has held that it would not join any combination that has ?communal? BJP as a partner. Nominations for the three-phase election begin on January 10. Polling is to be held on February 3, 15 and 23.

 ?We expect the situation to become clear in two-three days,? Modi said, without specifying if there was any ?electoral formula? on which the NDA was working. 

 Modi also did not say how the seats would be distributed among the alliance partners.

 ?The final meeting of NDA?s central election committee will be held in Delhi on January 9. After that, we will be in a position to give out the total number of seats that the partners would contest,? he said.

 Modi said, party leaders Uma Bharti and Shatrughan Sinha would be among the ?intensive? campaigners for the election, although senior leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj would also move to the constituencies.

 Our effort is to ensure that at least one of the lead campaigners visits each block headquarters, he said.

 The BJP has decided to go to the poll with the twin slogans of Pandrah saal, bura haal (fifteen years of misrule) and Sarkar badaliye, Bihar badlega (change government to change Bihar) to counter Laloo Prasad?s call of ?now or never? with regard to the development of the state.

 ?Laloo Prasad is showing a dream to the people that a friendly government in Delhi would help in the development of Bihar. But a person, who could not do anything to change Bihar during 15 years of his party?s rule, would not be able to do any more,? Modi said. 

 ?Laloo Prasad could neither get an economic package for Bihar from the UPA government nor a special package for those affected by flood and drought. Only 624 km of rural roads could be constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana in Bihar, compared to 10,581 km in Uttar Pradesh and 8,746 km in Rajasthan. Despite the availability of Rs 750 crore, not one inch of rural road was built in the state after the formation of the UPA government,? he added.

 The BJP leader said the consumption of core fertilisers in the state had gone down by one-third during the past three years because the government failed to provide the necessary subsidies.

 ?The railway minister failed to implement his own announcements. Kulhars worth only Rs 68 lakh were procured by railway all over the country from June to November 2004.

 The refrigerated van for vegetables never made a second trip from Patna to Delhi. As many as 27 scrap items are still being auctioned by the railway despite Laloo Prasad?s promise to end the practice,? he added.

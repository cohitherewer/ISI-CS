 Dalmiya: Court hassles

 Chennai, March 28: Jagmohan Dalmiya, the former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, today claimed that he had attended a March 17 executive committee meeting of the International Cricket Council in New Delhi ?as a director of the ICC?.

 Dalmiya?s submission in the sixth city civil court came in the backdrop of contempt proceedings initiated against him for attending the ICC meeting.

 Civil court judge Mohideen Pitachi had on March 18 issued notices returnable today to Dalmiya and BCCI secretary S.K. Nair following contempt petitions filed by the Sir Thyagaraya Recreation Club. The Chennai-based club contended that Dalmiya had, by attending the ICC meeting, violated a January 25 court order restraining the BCCI from nominating him as its representative to any meeting of the world cricket body.

 On Thursday, the court also issued notices to ICC chief Ehsan Mani and BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra.

 The judge posted the matter for hearing on April 12 after Siddhartha Shankar Ray, who as senior counsel of Dalmiya and the ICC, prayed for time as the cricket body had received the notice only yesterday.

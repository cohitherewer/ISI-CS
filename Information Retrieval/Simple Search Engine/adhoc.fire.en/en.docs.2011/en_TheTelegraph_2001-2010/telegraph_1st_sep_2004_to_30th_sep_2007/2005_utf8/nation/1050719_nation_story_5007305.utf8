 Mohali fans still missing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shimla, July 18: After the militant attack in Ayodhya this month, security agencies have suddenly woken up to the fact that 55 Pakistanis who had come to watch the India-Pakistan Test match at Mohali from March 8 are still missing.

 Top-level Himachal Pradesh government sources said the Intelligence Bureau, in a letter to the government, has warned that some Pakistanis could have sneaked in from Chandigarh.

 A total number of 3,798 Pakistani nationals were given visas to watch the cricket match in Mohali. A number of Pakistanis were reported missing during the match but were traced later. 

 But 55 Pakistanis are still missing and India has no knowledge of their whereabouts, a source said.

 During the match, eyebrows were also raised on the conduct of some Pakistanis who were found selling foreign cigarettes and dry fruits at throwaway prices in Chandigarh. 

 Security agencies then had warned the Himachal government about the possibility of Pakistanis sneaking into tourist places like Shimla. Now, four months after their disappearance, the agencies are still in the dark about how the 55 people from across the border vanished.

 According to intelligence reports, the missing Pakistanis could hide themselves in Shimla, Kullu and Kinnaur districts, which are inter-connected.

 What could make the work of vigilance forces tougher is the resemblance of appearance between Pakistanis and Kashmiris. One estimate says about 12,000 Kashmiri porters and hawkers live in various parts of Himachal. The missing Pak citizens could easily operate under the garb of hawkers or porters, the source said.

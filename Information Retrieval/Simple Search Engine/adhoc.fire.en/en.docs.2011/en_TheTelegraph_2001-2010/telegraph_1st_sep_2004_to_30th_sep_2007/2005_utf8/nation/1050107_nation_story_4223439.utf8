 Modi: Tug at purse strings

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 6: Narendra Modi today packaged Gujarat as a state where ?if you invest Re 1, you earn a dollar? in the run-up to an investment summit here next week.

 The Global Investors? Summit 2005 will be held on January 12 and 13 and ?will showcase the real capability and potential of the people, industry and the state?, the chief minister said at a news conference here.

 Many non-resident Indians, including Gujaratis, whom Modi and his cabinet colleagues had lobbied on a recent tour of some countries, are expected to attend to explore the state?s potential as an ?investment destination?.

 Several global institutions and multinationals will also attend the summit, jointly sponsored by the Centre, the Ficci, and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation.

 Modi claimed that the last summit, held in September 2003, was a big success as memoranda of understanding worth Rs 66,000 crore were signed, of which Rs 56,000 crore worth of projects are being implemented.

 ?We want to take advantage of India?s enhanced position as an investment destination,? the chief minister said. 

 The summit will highlight the emerging potential of Gujarat, which has already been recognised as the country?s ?engine of growth?, he said.

 Modi added that the state has acquired a ?brand image? after his government started the ?Vibrant Gujarat? campaign two years ago. It is one of the fastest growing states with ?robust infrastructure, quality workforce, proactive policies, rich natural resources?, he claimed.

 The summit?s inauguration will coincide with the kite festival, Uttarayan, on January 11, because the state wants to combine business with pleasure ?to boost the local kite industry?. 

 About 70 kites-flyers from 30 countries are expected to participate.

 Modi said ?it makes strong business sense to be in Gujarat? and this will be his message to potential investors.

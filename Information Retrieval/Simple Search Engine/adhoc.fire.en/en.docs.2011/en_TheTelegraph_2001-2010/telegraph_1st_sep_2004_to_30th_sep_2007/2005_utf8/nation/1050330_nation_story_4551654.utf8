 Stung Aman in court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 29: Television personality Aman Verma, on whom India TV carried out a sting operation, has filed a criminal complaint against the channel.

 The complaint was lodged yesterday at the metropolitan magistrate?s court against India TV, its head Rajat Sharma, the producer of the programme India?s Most Wanted, Suhaib Ilyasi, and ?Ruchi?, the woman who posed as an aspirant actor in the sting operation. 

 Verma said Sharma, Ilyasi and ?Ruchi? on behalf of the channel had entered into a ?criminal conspiracy to commit an offence of extortion under the guise of sting operations?.

 The complaint added that on December 17, 2004, ?Ruchi? met Verma at his residence after repeatedly making calls on his mobile, ?wearing a black colour frock-type dress?. 

 The actor and the woman had a formal introduction after which ?she suggested to continue their conversation in the bedroom?, it said. After ?15-20? minutes of conversation, Verma was shocked to see Ilyasi at the entrance to his flat, the complaint said.

 The actor has alleged that in the past three months, he has received ?frequent calls and disturbing threats of extortion and blackmail? from the persons he named.

 Verma added he had filed a police complaint on March 16 and the video featuring him was telecast the next day.

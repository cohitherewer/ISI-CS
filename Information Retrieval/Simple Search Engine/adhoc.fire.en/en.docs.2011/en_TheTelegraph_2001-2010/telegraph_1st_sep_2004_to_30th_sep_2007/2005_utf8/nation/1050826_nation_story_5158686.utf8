 Harappan find

 Muzaffarnagar, Aug. 25 (PTI): A mummified body, wearing copper bracelets, some pottery and other artefacts dating back to the Harappan civilisation 3,000 years ago, have been found at a village in Baghpat district.

 The body, caked in mud and dirt, was found by the Archaeological Survey of India during an excavation at Sinoli.

 Archaeologist Dharamveer Sharma, who is supervising the dig, said the shape of the artefacts and the inscriptions they bore indicated that they could be 3,000 years old, though tests like radio-carbon dating had yet to be conducted.

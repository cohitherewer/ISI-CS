 Delhi sop for Bodo outfit

 New Delhi, May 24: The Centre tonight agreed to suspend operations against the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), ending the outfits long wait, reports our correspondent. 

 This will pave the way for negotiations between Delhi and the Bodo militant organisation for ending the 18-year-old armed rebellion. 

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil is likely to make a formal announcement on the decision tomorrow. 

 A home ministry official revealed that the Centre made the move following bilateral talks with representatives of the outfit here. 

 However, ground rules on the cessation of hostilities are yet to be finalised. These are likely to be framed in the days to come, said the official. 

 The talks were held between home ministry officials and NDFB representatives. The Assam government was not involved as the outfit had earlier rejected deals with Dispur.

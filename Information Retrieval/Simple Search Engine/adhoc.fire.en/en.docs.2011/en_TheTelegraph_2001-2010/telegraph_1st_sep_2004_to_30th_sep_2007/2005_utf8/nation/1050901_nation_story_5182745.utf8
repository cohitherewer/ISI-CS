 sparks fly around Sheila

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: A day after Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit was forced to agree to roll back an unpopular power tariff hike, her detractors in the Congress have demanded her resignation.

 Led by Lok Sabha members Ajay Maken and former Union minister Jagdish Tytler, local Congress leaders today opposed the state governments offer to subsidise private power companies in lieu of the rollback and asserted that the only way out of the mess was her exit. 

 Dikshits troubles were compounded with lieutenant governor B.L. Joshi, considered close to 10 Janpath, refusing to approve her move to offer subsidy to the power companies. The Delhi cabinet passed the proposal later in the day, but the issue is expected to kick up more dust in the coming days.

 According to the rollback formula, the distribution companies will offer a 5 per cent rebate and the government will offer a 5 per cent subsidy amounting to Rs 187 crore to the private companies.

 The governments subsidy decision goes against the grain of power reforms. At a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh before the tariff hike was announced earlier this year, the chief minister had proposed a subsidy but this was shot down.

 Dikshit, who defended the power tariff hike till Monday, was criticised by Parliaments standing committee on energy, which felt that the tariff hike was proposed at the request of one of the poorly performing power companies.

 Once a public backlash against the now-aborted hike gained momentum, the Congress leadership, too, virtually left Dikshit to fend for herself. Her failure to submit a report on the steps to clean up the mess on the power and water front in Delhi to the party high command last week has also not gone down well in the AICC.

 Besides, she was also accused of not publicising a clause in the privatisation memorandum of understanding that made tariff hikes mandatory.

 At a closed-door meeting this morning, Ajay Maken and Jagdish Tytler are learnt to have demanded the resignation of the chief minister while opposing her rollback formula involving a subsidy payment to the power companies.

 The meeting was attended by party MPs R.K. Anand, Krishna Tirath and Sajjan Kumar.

 Like the MLAs at the Congress legislature party meeting on Tuesday, the MPs expressed strong reservations about Dikshits rollback formula.

 Sources said none of the 10 Congress leaders who attended the meeting defended the chief minister in the face of the demand to remove her.

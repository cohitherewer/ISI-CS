The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Final lists exchanged for next bus trip

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, April 16: Designated authorities from the two sides of divided Kashmir have exchanged the final lists of prospective passengers for the second bus journey between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad on April 21.

 John Shilshi, regional passport officer, Kashmir, who is the designated authority for the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad journey, visited Kaman Post yesterday and met Muzaffarabad deputy commissioner Liaqat Hussain for the first time.

 A meeting between Shilshi and Hussain, who is the Pakistan-designated authority, was held later in the day at Kaman Bridge on the Line of Control.

 ?We have cleared the entire list of 47 prospective passengers received from Muzaffarabad while only 32 out of the 119 prospective passengers have been cleared by my counterpart so far,? Shilshi told The Telegraph.

 ?Only 30 passengers would travel in the second bus and the other cleared passengers would have to wait and would travel in the third bus after 15 days,? Shilshi said.

 The buses from Srinagar and Muzaffarabad would roll on April 21 according to the programme agreed between India and Pakistan to run the service initially on a fortnightly basis.

 Renewed militant threats have once again focused on the peace bus. The combine of four militant groups that owned up the attack on the Kashmir Tourist Reception Centre on April 6 on the eve of the starting of the bus service has again warned people not to undertake the journey, which would ?endanger the lives of both the travellers and their families?.

 FM catches foreign fund signal

 New Delhi, June 30 (PTI): The government today allowed 20 per cent foreign direct investment in private FM radio services and decided on a revenue share regime against the existing licence fee structure to allow 330 stations in 90 cities.

 The Union cabinet, which met here to thrash out the policy framework for the second phase of FM radio licensing, however, decided to continue the ban on news and current affairs on FM stations.

 The time has come for revival of radio in the country and the government has planned a huge expansion of the private FM radio network, which will lead to generation of employment and opportunities and encourage talent, said information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy.

 Even as we have decided to allow FDI at the existing 20 per cent cap for FIIs (foreign institutional investors), OCBs (overseas corporate bodies) and NRIs, there will be no news permitted on private FM channels under the present regime, the minister added.

 Industry chambers welcomed the governments decision. The governments fresh radio package would energise the expansion of FM radio in the country. The regulatory corrections would result in more growth, more revenue, new employment, the Confederation of Indian Industry said.

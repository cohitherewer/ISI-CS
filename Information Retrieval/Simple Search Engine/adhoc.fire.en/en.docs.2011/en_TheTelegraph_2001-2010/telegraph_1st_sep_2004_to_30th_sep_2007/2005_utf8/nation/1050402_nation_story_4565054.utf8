 Naxalite attack on Orissa Congman

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 1: The residence of a senior Congress leader in Rayagada district was severely damaged after suspected Naxalites tried to blow it up with gelatine sticks. They also attacked the business establishments of the Congressman before fleeing.

 The Naxalites arrived at Jamadeipentha village around 2.20 am and knocked on the door of district Congress committee president Doki Satyanarayan?s house, said Rayagada superintendent of police Sanjay Kumar. 

 The Congress leader and his family members, including about 15 children, were called outside and tied up. Satyanarayan, who is also the vice-chairman of Rayagada zilla parishad, and his family members were beaten up before his house was attacked. 

 The rebels then turned their attention to the business establishments of Satyanarayan. They blew up a rice mill and destroyed a shop owned by the Congressman. 

 They also looted valuables, including jewellery, from the residence. Such was the impact of the explosion that some houses in the neighbourhood developed cracks. 

 While the Naxalites carried out the attack, none of Satyanarayan?s neighbours mustered courage to come outside. The rebels did not leave behind any literature or pamphlets, as they normally do, but the police said to have found a letter.

 This is the second attack on the district Congress leader. Three years ago, Naxalites had damaged Satyanarayan?s rice mill by detonating explosives.

 Rayagada police said they are examining the letter left behind at the spot. They are also conducting a combing operation, in collaboration with Andhra Pradesh police, to arrest the culprits.

 Tracker for foreign funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: An elaborate mechanism to keep tabs on the millions of dollars that come in as foreign assistance to non-government organisations is taking shape in North Block.

 The home ministry has already finalised amendments to the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), which governs foreign assistance to NGOs and charitable institutions. Once the amendments are incorporated, the government would be able to overhaul the rules and create the infrastructure to help the administration keep a close watch on the movement of foreign funds in the country, right from the time the money is deposited in banks, officials said.

 ?We are going to make it mandatory for banks to submit information on foreign assistance channelled through them,? a home ministry official said, pointing out that there would be a penalty clause to ensure that banks passed on this information within a reasonable period of time.

 At present, NGOs and other charitable institutions have to register with the home ministry in Delhi to be able to receive assistance from foreign sources and have to keep the government posted on the extent of assistance received and the purposes for which the funds were deployed.

 There is a time lag of nearly a year before the government learns of the amount of foreign assistance that has come into the country. The home ministry is still compiling details of foreign assistance received in 2003-04. More than 16,000 NGOs had got foreign assistance worth Rs 5,046 crore the previous year, according to the ministry.

 The government also intends to introduce a fee for registration of NGOs under the FCRA and plans to limit the validity of the registration to five years. Currently, FCRA registration is valid for the lifetime of the organisation and even NGOs that have not received foreign funds for years remain on the home ministry?s records.

 However, the UPA government has decided against empowering district collectors to monitor the use of funds. This proposal, which had been floated when the Sangh parivar had made an issue of conversions by Christian organisations, was perceived to be aimed at harassing minority institutions. Non-religious NGOs had also protested tighter controls, saying it would create too much red tape and government control in the NGO sector.

 Instead, the home ministry has decided to decentralise decision-making. It has set up five regional centres of the home ministry?s foreigners? division, each of them headed by a middle-ranking bureaucrat, which would be responsible for registering NGOs and keeping a tab on the use of foreign funds. The ministry, sources said, came up with this concept in view of fears of arbitrary action by the district administration or state governments.

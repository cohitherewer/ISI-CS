 Deal on Dhaka joint panels

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, June 21: India and Bangladesh today agreed on a series of steps, including revival of a joint river commission and working groups on border management and commerce, to take bilateral relations forward.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has expressed his desire to improve ties with Bangladesh. He has also indicated that he would like to invite Bangladesh counterpart Begum Khaleda Zia to Delhi before the Saarc summit in Dhaka later this year.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran and his Bangladesh counterpart Hemayatuddin today reviewed the gamut of bilateral relations. Their talks extended far beyond the scheduled time, leading to a joint statement which will be issued tomorrow.

 The two sides agreed that commerce minister Kamal Nath would visit Bangladesh for talks on narrowing the trade gap. The joint working group on trade and commerce will meet soon to chalk out the agenda for the visit.

 Hemayatuddin said Dhaka had started taking action against Indian insurgents and would not allow its territory to be used by any group or individuals for anti-Indian activities. He also proposed three bus routes from Dhaka to Siliguri, Guwahati and Shillong.

 The two sides agreed the joint working group on border management would meet soon and try to implement simultaneous and coordinated patrolling along the border.

 Although the meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere with both sides trying to take forward discussions in a constructive manner, border fencing remained an area of disagreement.

 India has undertaken a programme to fence 3,200 km of its 4,096-km border with Bangladesh. So far, nearly 40 per cent of the border has been fenced. But Dhaka has objected, saying this violated the 1975 agreement that no defensive structures would be constructed within 150 yards of the zero line.

 The Indian position is the fence would be beneficial in that it would stop the flow of criminals from Bangladesh into India. By the end of the day, the two sides agreed on a number of areas, including a revised trade agreement and one on protecting bilateral investments.

 The proposed interlinking of major rivers in India has been a cause of concern in Bangladesh for some years. A feasibility study on linking peninsula rivers has been carried out but no decision has been taken on the Himalayan rivers. Dhaka insists no decision on river-linking can be taken without consulting it.

 In view of the difference of opinion, the two countries have decided to revive the joint river commission, which has not met since September 2003. 

 Among other things, the commission will discuss sharing of river water between the two countries.

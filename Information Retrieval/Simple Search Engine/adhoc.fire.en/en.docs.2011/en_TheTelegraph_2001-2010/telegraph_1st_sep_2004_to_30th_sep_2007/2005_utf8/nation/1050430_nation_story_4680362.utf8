 Tourist returns to fight rapists

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Varanasi, April 29: A German tourist has returned to Varanasi after four years in search of justice.

 Thirty-two-year-old Claudia Pocker had been drawn to the temple town on her first visit to India in July 2001 by Mark Twain?s quote: ?Benaras is older than history?.?

 But on the second day of her stay, she was drugged and raped by the owner of the hotel where she had put up and a guide. Claudia, a nurse who was doing research in homoeopathy and herbal medicine, went back traumatised, but not before she had filed an FIR and undergone a medical test to prove she was raped.

 Four years later, she is back to testify against her rapists, as a guest of the Uttar Pradesh government. Claudia arrived on Wednesday and appeared in court yesterday. She identified the accused and faced cross-examination by the defence counsel.

 ?I have come here with a mission. I hope that it will get fulfilled. I want the two rapists to be punished under Indian law. If rape had traumatised me in 2001, I am impressed by the sincerity of the prosecution team,? she told her lawyers.

 The state government had sent messages through the German embassy urging her to come to Varanasi to testify, but she had refused. ?I was too scared to say yes,? she says. Then the government promised her security and bought her a return air ticket.

 Senior superintendent of police S.. Sabat said the reason for bringing Claudia back was to send across the message that people cannot get away with crime against foreign tourists. ?The general perception is that once a tourist leaves the country with a taste of violence in the city, no one bothers to come back for the trial,? he said. 

 Claudia broke down yesterday when she was taken to the hotel by the Ganga, where owner Maniraj Singh and guide Vinod Singh had assaulted her after serving her lassi spiked with an intoxicant on July 2, 2001, but she has recovered, an assistant prosecutor said. She will be here for two more days to complete the legal formalities, sources said.

 The rape had caused a furore in the town and the government had introduced a tourist police force that was, however, withdrawn in 2003. 

 After the FIR was filed on July 3, 2001, both the accused were arrested. The case moved from one court to another before it was handed over to a fast-track court this year. The accused are now out on bail.

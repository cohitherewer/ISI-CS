 No-booze hardliner makes rivals edgy

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Chauhan: Tough nut?

 Bhopal, Nov. 27: Khushwant Singh had once in jest described L.K. Advani as a dangerous man for his simple lifestyle and non-indulgence in human vices. The description could well be true for Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Madhya Pradeshs chief minister -designate. 

 The 46-year-old BJP leader is feared for his hardliner image and no-nonsense approach.

 When Chauhan was 16, he took out a rally against his father seeking better wages for farmers working in his familys fields at the village of Jait, 70 km from here, in Hoshangabad district. 

 Father Prem Singh Chauhan used to pay 75 paise a day to the farmers instead of the prevailing rate of Rs 1.25. In the end, he had to yield. 

 In his college days, Chauhan once threatened to walk out of students union election when his supporters and colleagues got together late one night to unwind over liquor. His friends at Bhopals Hamidiya College recalled how they threw away liquor bottles to keep Chauhan in the fray.

 The chief minister-designates thrust on purity and his uncompromising nature is making the Opposition Congress edgy. Chauhans predecessors Uma Bharti and Babulal Gaur have declared over half-a-dozen cities in Madhya Pradesh holy, where sale of liquor, meat and eggs is banned. We wonder if Chauhan will continue with the same agenda or bring some change, said state Congress leader Manak Aggarwal. 

 The Congress has more reasons to worry. Chauhan has virtually no friends in the main Opposition party. 

 In his political career spanning over two decades, Chauhan has not enjoyed friendly ties with any notable Congress leader from the state ? a contrast to earlier BJP chief ministers who had friends in the Congress camp. 

 Arjun Singh was known for his ties with Sunderlal Patwa while Digvijay Singh was more than friendly with Vikram Verma. Uma was known to be soft on Arjun Singh and Gaur struck a rapport with almost the entire Congress leadership. 

 Chauhan, therefore, could prove to be a tough nut. 

 Today, outgoing chief minister Gaur sent his resignation to BJP chief Advani. 

 The BJP legislature party is meeting here tomorrow to elect Chauhan its leader. He is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday. An unhappy Uma camp is still trying to force a contest at tomorrows meeting but BJP functionaries said they would not let it happen. 

 Gaur has offered to quit his Assembly seat in favour of Chauhan, who is an MP.

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Narendra Modi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani today watched their governments roles in the Gujarat riots come under fire at the National Integration Council meeting, attended by the political whos who and eminent citizens.

 After Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stressed the need to fight communalism, extremism and regional and linguistic chauvinism, the Left speakers, led by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, made the Gujarat violence virtually the core issue. 

 They pressed the Centre to punish the guilty and table the Communal Harmony Bill as soon as it can so that similar flare-ups can be dealt with firmly.

 It was the Centres responsibility to see that justice is done to the victims of the post-Godhra communal riots as normal police and judicial procedures have been found wanting in the state.... It would be unwise to ignore the meaning of such mass violence with state sponsorship for the future of communal harmony and national unity, Karat said.

 The meeting was attended by former Prime Ministers V.P. Singh and I.K. Gujral, ruling alliance chief Sonia Gandhi, all the Union ministers and chief ministers, eminent academics, judges, social activists and journalists.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil later told reporters the final draft of the harmony bill will be ready in a week and placed before the council of ministers soon.

 When Modis turn came, he argued that national integration cannot be achieved unless forcible conversions stop. He asked the Centre to do something about the fast-spreading Naxalite menace. He accused the government of bias for its refusal to allow Gujarat a special law to fight organised crime.

 The Prime Minister asked the home ministry to form a team of officials who will examine reports on communal violence and work out ways to strengthen the administration, police and the judicial machinery.

 Former Chief Justice of India A.H. Ahmadi said as the Centre and states never agree on which areas should be declared disturbed, the harmony bill should consider an independent authority to decide these issues. He also spoke of the ghettoisation of Muslims in cities like Ahmedabad, saying this could spell trouble.

 Karat also mentioned the violence in the Northeast, blaming it on the governments failure to reach development to the common man.

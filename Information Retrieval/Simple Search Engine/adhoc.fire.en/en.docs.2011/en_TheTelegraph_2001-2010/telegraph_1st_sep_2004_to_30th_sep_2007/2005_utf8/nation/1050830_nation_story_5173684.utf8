 Princess wins, not Mittal palace

 Mittal: Privacy problem

 London, Aug. 29: He may be Britains richest man, and may even have the ear of the Prime Minister, but none of that has stopped Lakshmi Mittal losing a long-running dispute with his neighbours.

 Despite his complaint that a new block of flats would overlook his property and have a negative effect on the appearance of the street, the local council has given the go-ahead for a development next door to the steel billionaire in Hampstead, north London.

 Mittal lives with his family on The Bishops Avenue, nicknamed Billionaires Row, in a ?9-million property called the Summer Palace. 

 It is in an area coyly termed the Superhouses, where size is definitely more and style somewhat less, or in council terminology: The houses are of varying designs and highly contemporary. They are bold, impressive and compete for attention, they pay little regard for the characteristic vernacular architecture and do not use traditional materials.

 The neighbour in question is Princess Samerah bin Mokhtar al-Saadawy of the Saudi Arabian royal family, and the property she is planning to knock down in favour of the flats is barely more appealing.

 An extension was started to her house in the mid-1980s but construction stopped a few years later and it has remained semi-derelict.

 The princess has won approval for two buildings on the site of three and four storeys, linked at basement level, and with car parking and a swimming pool underneath and a ballroom at the back. There will be 12 exclusive apartments with balconies ? with, the Mittals fear, excellent views of their back garden.

 In an objection lodged on the Mittals behalf by the consultants, Macfarlanes, they claim the property does not represent high-quality design and fails to preserve or enhance local character.

 They object to replacing a detached house with flats and add that neither the height nor the appearance of the new buildings will be compatible with the special character of The Bishops Avenue and they will have a significant adverse visual impact.

 Furthermore, there will be a large number of new windows which would severely reduce their privacy.

 Another neighbour, the tea entrepreneur, N.K. Sethia, went further, saying the development would turn the street into a concrete jungle, ruining its tidy and serene atmosphere by allowing what amounts to a block of flats.

 If Mittal finds the building work too noisy, he can always stay at his other home in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London. 

 The new block of flats received a glowing appraisal from council planners who pointed out it had an architectural approach which was evolving, post-modern neo-Jacobean and of considerable interest. The development, they added, has been conceived as an English country manor, set upon a terrace with the surrounding outhouses, which refer to barns, stables and agricultural buildings in more vernacular style, which contrast with the main house.

 Yesterday Mittal and Princess al-Saadawy were unavailable for comment.

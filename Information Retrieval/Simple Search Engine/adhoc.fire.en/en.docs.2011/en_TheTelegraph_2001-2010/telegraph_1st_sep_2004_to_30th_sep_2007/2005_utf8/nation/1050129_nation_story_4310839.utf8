The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nizam opens his palace gates, for Rs 50

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 28: The last Nizam of Hyderabad, Prince Mukaram Jah, threw open the doors of a palace this evening to give commoners a peek into royal life. For a price, of course.

 The Chow Mohalla Palace, with its long corridors woven around four bungalows, stands in the heart of the walled city of Hyderabad, a stone?s throw from Charminar and Mecca Mosque.

 ?The rich heritage of my ancestors and the Deccan lie hidden in the closed vaults of my palaces,? said the prince. But necessity could well have been the mother of his move to allow outsiders into the palace precinct. 

 Jah lost a case to retain the entire Chiran Palace at Jubilee Hills, about 15 km from Chow Mohalla, and is burdened with heavy wealth tax and income tax dues. 

 The government took over a large portion of the palace and converted it to a garden.

 Visitors to Chow Mohalla during the day will have to pay Rs 50 for entry and Rs 100 in the evenings. Foreigners would be charged Rs 150.

 The prince, who has made Australia his home, however, said on his arrival here: ?My objective is to open them (the palaces) up? with the objective that (the) cultural heritage of my people is better understood and assessed.? 

 Accompanied by his fourth wife, Princess Esra, and children Azmath Jah and Shekyr, Mukaram Jah formally launched a grand exhibition at the palace this evening.

 But whatever the reason behind the opening of the palace doors, what is on offer is tantalising. 

 At the centre of the complex is Khilawat Mubarak, the durbar hall on which flutters the Nizam?s flag and the marble throne replete with gold and silver work.

 Nawab Iqbal Wali Khan, the present protector of the Nizam?s properties, lamented that ?what was a 45-acre palace complex 30 years ago, is now around 12?. 

 Most of the encroachments have political backing, he added. 

 ?The palace had a vast garden giving a clear view of the Charminar and Mecca Mosque.? Not any longer. 

 On display at Chow Mohalla from today would be gold and silver-embroidered dresses that the Nizams and their wives wore. ?Some of them weigh over 10 kg,? says Rahul Mehrotra, one of the curators involved in restoring the palace.

 Art historian Martand Singh worked with Mehrotra since 2000 to breathe life into the palace. 

 ?We have been able to catalogue, clean and preserve a portion of the palace collection. Only a few of them are on display and the rest in protected environs ? vaults and cellars,? said one of them.

 The total value of the paintings, crockery, arms, costumes, furniture and automobiles in the palace is conservatively assessed at over Rs 220 crore.

 At a programme attended by members of the family and top officials, the princess hinted that Falaknuma Palace, nestled on a hillock about 5 km from Charminar, is also likely to be thrown open. A part of the palace is now in the custody of the Taj group of hotels and another portion with the government, where official dinners are hosted for foreign dignitaries.

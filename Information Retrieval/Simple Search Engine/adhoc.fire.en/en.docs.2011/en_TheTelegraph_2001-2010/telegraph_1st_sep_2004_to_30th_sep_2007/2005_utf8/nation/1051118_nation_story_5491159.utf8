 RSS population pill

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 K.S. Sudarshan

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: Wanted, Hindu mothers who can produce 10 children.

 If you thought that was a joke, ask K.S. Sudarshan.

 The RSS chief has come up with a population management formula that can give policymakers nightmares. 

 Forget the two-child norm. Produce three at the very least; more than that are more than welcome, he said today at the release of Religious Demography of India, compiled by the Centre for Policy Research.

 The punchline came a while later. We have, in fact, instituted awards for our mothers who produce 10 children, he said.

 The stunning declaration came after the discussions focused on the border areas ? Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast ? where, according to the policy research centre, growth in Muslim and Christian populations has reduced Hindus to a minority.

 Sudarshan, whose organisation dreads such a day, then seized centre-stage. 

 If you had three children, after 120 years there will be 38 left, he said, citing a formula. But if you have only one, nothing will remain of you after 120 years.

 For the Sangh, firm action translates as a direct attack on people believing in religions that came from outside. You can pray at the Vatican and Mecca-Medina, Sudarshan said. 

 But you will live and die for this country.

 Lunch with Vajpayee

 Sudarshan called on Atal Bihari Vajpayee this afternoon as part of the exercise to choose BJP chief L.K. Advanis successor. Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav termed the lunch meeting routine.

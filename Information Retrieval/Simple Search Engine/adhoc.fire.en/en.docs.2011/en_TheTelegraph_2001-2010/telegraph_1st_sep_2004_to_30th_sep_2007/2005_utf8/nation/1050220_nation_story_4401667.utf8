 Night crowd thins at Taj

 Taj Mahal: Quiet at dusk

Lucknow, Feb. 19: The Supreme Court?s ?Valentine?s Day gift? of extending night viewing of the Taj Mahal by a year has not brought cheer to the show organisers.

 The number of night viewers of the marble monument to love has been steadily declining a month after the show began in November last year.

 The revenue has failed to break even despite a high entry fee and the cost of running the show is proving a cause for concern, especially because of the spiralling security costs.

 The authorities fear a further decline in viewers as a proposal has been mooted to hike the entry fee.

 ?We have been trying to make the show popular through our publicity staff and travel agents. But in the initial few months, there have not been as many viewers as we expected,? Uttar Pradesh tourism minister Hameed Khokab said.

 The restriction, he said, on the number of people to be allowed in for the night viewing may not make it immediately financially rewarding.

 In keeping with apex court directives, the state tourism department and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have been allowing in a maximum of 400 people a night.

 They are allowed in in batches of 40 on five nights a month ? a full moon night and two nights before and after it ? at Rs 500 for domestic tourists and Rs 750 for foreigners.

 The show drew 400 people on each of the five nights after its inaugural in November, according to sources. The next month, the number dipped to 200-350 a night, they said.

 There was a further decline in January. Only one of the five nights drew 350 tourists; the rest managed 100 each.

 Khokab attributed the lower turnout from December onwards to the cold wave and fog. ?In early summer, when the sky is clear, we want to make the most of the available tourists and make it more viable. This will continue till July and then later in October-December,? he said.

 But till then the state will be continuing to spend over Rs 1 lakh a night on security arrangements ? manned by the Central Industrial Security Force ? for the show even as the revenue dips.

 The apex court had found the arrangements satisfactory enough to extend night viewing by a year on February 14, which was Valentine?s Day.

 ?We are not immediately looking at the show from a profit-loss point of view. The show will surely have a long-term impact on the local economy,? said Raj Kamal Gupta, special secretary, tourism, Uttar Pradesh. 

 ?This is bound to boost the hotel industry and help the guides and other sectors of tourism,? he added.

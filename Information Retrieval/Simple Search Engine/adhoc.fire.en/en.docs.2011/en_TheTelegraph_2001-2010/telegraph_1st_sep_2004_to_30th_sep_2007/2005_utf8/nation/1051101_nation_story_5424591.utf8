The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No news of Calcutta boy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: With no news about 13-year-old Sayan Mukherjee, who was caught in the Sarojini Nagar bomb blast on Saturday, his grandparents in Kalighat were fast losing hope of seeing him again. 

 Our relatives have looked for him in every hospital in Delhi, but have drawn a blank. Although time is running out, we are still hopeful, was all a close relative could say on Monday. 

 Sayan, along with father Satyabrata, a banker, and mother Supriya, was shopping in Sarojini Nagars Babu Market when the bomb went off. 

 The mutilated bodies of Supriya and Satyabrata were later traced by their relatives in a mortuary but Sayan was nowhere to be found. They loved to visit Delhi and this year was no different. I have no words to express my grief, a close relative said. 

 According to information available with us, the bodies of Supriya and Satyabrata will be cremated in Delhi, said N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south). 

 Today, the Mukherjees spent most of the time behind closed doors and occasionally checked with the police station for any news of Sayans possible survival. The Class VII student of a city-based English medium school and the darling of Kali Lane, where the Mukherjees live, was to return on Monday with lots of crackers.

 We dont have any information on the boys fate. No one from Delhi police has got in touch, a Kalighat police station officer said.

 Raveena, portal row

 Raveena: No Net link?

 Mumbai, Nov. 1 (PTI): Bombay High Court today restrained shaditimes.com, a marriage portal, from using pictures of Raveena Tandon to promote itself.

 Shaditimes.com had claimed that the actor had met her husband Anil Thadani through the portal as disclosed by her in an interview to them.

 Hearing a petition filed by her, Justice S.U. Kamdar asked the portal not to use Raveenas photograph on its website.

 Raveena had also asked for Rs 60 lakh in damages, saying the portal had wrongly mentioned that she met her husband through the portal and was, therefore, misleading its viewers. The court, however, did not grant her damages.

 Laloo party calls for quota

 Prasad, Tandon

 Patna, May 9: The Rashtriya Janata Dal today demanded that the Election Commission, which it has accused of caste bias, should be constituted on the basis of reservations.

 ?A similar policy should also be introduced in the judiciary to ensure that these constitutional positions are bereft of any caste bias. The issue should be thoroughly debated,? party spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary said.

 ?Perhaps, of the three election commissioners, one can be from the general category, another from the Scheduled Castes and the third from the OBC (Other Backward Classes).?

 RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had alleged yesterday that election commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy had last year got a repoll ordered in Chhapra, from where he had won, just to spite him and his fellow Yadavs.

 Tiwary claimed that the conduct of the poll panels special team of K.J. Rao and Ananth Kumar, which investigated the rigging charges in Chhapra, also smacked of caste bias.

 The election observer for the constituency, Bengal cadre IAS officer L.V. Saptharishi, has written to Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj that though ?there was no particular problem? in Chhapra, Tandon and Gopalaswamy made ?every attempt? to get the poll countermanded.

 Saptharishi alleged that one of the two commissioners had said at a meeting that he wanted to ?teach a lesson to Laloo Prasad Yadavs and all Yadavs?.

 ?We are not merely talking about Saptharishis letter to the Union law minister,? Tiwary said. ?In his report to the EC, Saptharishi had not favoured countermanding the poll. Then Saran district magistrate-cum-returning officer B.B. Pradhan had written a similar letter to the poll panel on May 5 last year.? He demanded that the panel make public both reports. 

 The BJP said the panel could not have acted merely on those reports. ?It had sent its own team to probe the matter. There were visual clippings and media reports that established large-scale irregularities in Chhapra,? vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi said.

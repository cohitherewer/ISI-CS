 Naga truce 

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, July 30: For the first time in eight years, an angry NSCN (I-M) leadership put Delhi on notice and insisted on extending the Naga ceasefire only by six months. This is a setback to the government, but it agreed to this arrangement reluctantly in Amsterdam today. 

 NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah has also decided that he would not return to India in the immediate future but go to Bangkok instead. 

 The NSCN (I-M) leaders will hold consultations in Bangkok with various Naga groups, who would be invited there before taking any decision to come to India for further peace talks. Thirteen rounds of peace parleys have already been held in New Delhi since last December before Muivah left for Amsterdam on July 4.

 A joint statement issued after two days of talks this evening in Amsterdam said both sides reaffirmed the need to extend the ceasefire and to intensify the peace process. But it also noted: As the NSCN intends to hold extensive consultations with the people, the ceasefire is formally extended for a period of six months, whereafter it will be extended further.

 Central representatives, who met Muivah in Amsterdam, were willing to extend the ceasefire by another year but were met with Muivahs anger fuelled by the developments in the Naga hill districts of Manipur. The Nagas of Manipur have blockaded Imphal Valley in protest against the Ibobi Singh government celebrating state integrity day. They see it as an affront to their demand for a unified Naga homeland.

 On our part, we were prepared to extend the ceasefire by one more year as usual. But then the NSCN (I-M) leadership felt that it wanted to consult various shades of Naga opinion. So they said in the first instance they would agree to extend the ceasefire only by six months, K. Padmanabhaiah, Delhis special representative for the peace talks, said from Amsterdam. 

 Muivah said on telephone from Amsterdam that he consciously wanted a limited extension of the ceasefire. If the government of India uses force against the Naga people as it has been doing in Manipur, how can we accept it? Is the ceasefire meant for attacking our people and torturing them to please the Meiteis? How can we agree to extending the ceasefire for one year as if everything was normal? he asked.

 Muivah said he had wanted to restrict the ceasefire extension to only three months. But the government representatives felt that would be interpreted as a deadline for a solution. There could then be additional problems at the end of three months. However, it is not as if we agreed to six months because of their fears. We wanted to give ourselves enough time for wide-ranging consultations, he insisted.

 Muivah said he had told the Indian negotiators that the situation in Manipur encompasses all Nagas and not only those living in the hill districts of the state. He suggested that the issue should be resolved through dialogue but the venue for talks should be New Delhi and not Manipur.

 Muivah, meanwhile is expected to proceed to Bangkok by the end of the second week of August. He will then begin consultations with invited groups of Nagas first in Bangkok and later, in Dimapur and Camp Hebron in Nagaland. 

 Minister of state for programme implementation and the leader of the ministerial group negotiating with the NSCN (I-M), Oscar Fernandes, was also present in Amsterdam. Oscar met me twice but he was not part of the formal ceasefire extension talks, Muivah said. The formal talks were led by K. Padmanabhaiah and joint director of the Intelligence Bureau Ajit Lal on behalf of New Delhi. Muivah and his special assistant Railung Nsarangbe represented the NSCN (I-M).

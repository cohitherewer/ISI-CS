 Soldiers killed in convoy ambush

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Sept. 10: Militants ambushed an army convoy on the strategic Srinagar-Jammu highway this morning, killing five soldiers.

 The convoy was proceeding from Srinagar to Jammu when it was targeted at Awantipora town, 40 km from here, in Pulwama district of south Kashmir.

 The militants first hurled two grenades at the army convoy and later employed heavy automatic fire, a senior police officer said.

 Three soldiers were killed on the spot while six were injured, three critically. Two of the injured succumbed to injuries in a nearby security force hospital.

 After the ambush, the militants moved into an adjacent residential area in Awantipora and started firing at troops stationed there, from among whom reinforcements had been rushed to the ambush site.

 Exchange of fire continued for nearly an hour before the militants escaped from the encounter site.

 Traffic on the highway, the lifeline for civil supplies and security requirements, was suspended for nearly two hours.

 The Lashkar-e-Toiba claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman phoned newspaper offices in Srinagar and said a four-member squad had carried out the attack against the army convoy.

 The ambush comes two days after militants attacked guards near the rear entrance of the city civil secretariat. Both militants and a policeman were killed.

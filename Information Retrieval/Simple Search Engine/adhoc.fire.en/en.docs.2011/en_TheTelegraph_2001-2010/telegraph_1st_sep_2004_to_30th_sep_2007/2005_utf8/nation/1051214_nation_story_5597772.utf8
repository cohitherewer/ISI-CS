 AC coach suits rat at work 

 New Delhi, Dec. 13 (PTI): A retired bank manager whose belongings were shredded by a rat during an air-conditioned train journey has said he will sue Indian Railways.

 A rodent tore through 65-year-old Tarkeshwar Prasads airbag and left his expensive suit in tatters in the reserved AC bogey of the Vikramshila Express. The New Delhi-bound train was from Patna.

 Despite the tall claims by railway minister Lalu Prasad, nothing has been done to ensure the comfort of the paying customer, Prasad, who earlier worked for State Bank of India, said. 

 He is planning to sue the railways in a consumer court.

 The retired bank manager realised what had happened only when he took down his luggage at the New Delhi railway station. 

 Initially, I thought it was the handiwork of some thief but soon I realised to my horror a rat had been at it, he said.

 The suit, which had been bought recently, was completely spoilt, he added.

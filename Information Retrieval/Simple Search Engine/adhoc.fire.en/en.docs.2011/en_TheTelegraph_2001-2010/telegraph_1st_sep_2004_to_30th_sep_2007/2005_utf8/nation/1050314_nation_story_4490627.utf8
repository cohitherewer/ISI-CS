 New life after dark spell

 GAUTAM SARKAR

 Bhagalpur, March 13: Tears rolled down their cheeks as Kari Kumari, Shabnam, Pinki Kumari and Chatni Kumari said goodbye to their mothers.

 Condemned to years of darkness, the four minor girls ? all daughters of women serving life terms ? today stepped out of Bhagalpur Central Jail with the hope of a brighter future at Holy Family, a home for children.

 Though the jail manual does not allow children above five years to stay with their guardians and relatives inside the jail, administrative red tape prevented the transfer of the girls for years. 

 The children were shunned by their fathers and relatives and forced to stay with their mothers in the jail.

 Kari, then nine months old, arrived in the jail on March 19, 1992 with her mother Shanichara Devi. A native of Demotard village under Mufassil police station in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand, Shanichara was awarded life sentence for the murder of her brother. ?Since there was nobody to look after the infant, she stayed with me. After spending years inside behind bars, she does not know anything about her relatives. Hope they properly look after her at the children?s home?, she said. 

 Kari, known as a serious student of the school in the jail, is keen to continue her studies. ?I will finish my studies and bring my innocent mother out of jail. She was imprisoned because she was illiterate and could not fight the legal battle,? she said. 

 Shabnam came to the jail with her mother Tazman Khatun on January 1, 1997 when she was only eight months old. Tazman, who hails from Dhanbari village under Sohodar police station in West Champaran district, was sent to jail over her involvement in a smuggling racket. ?I will see the free world and continue my studies,? Shabnam said today. 

 The two other girls, Pinki (9) and Chatni (11), had similar tales to tell. 

 With the administration taking the first step in the right direction with the transfer of the four girls today, there is hope for 24 others who are languishing in the jails of Bhagalpur, Purnea and Koshi divisions. 

 There are 230 women serving life terms in these jails. Of the 24 girls, seven are in the Bhagalpur jail, 11 in Purnea, two in Araria and four in Kishanganj. 

 ?We try hard to take the children out of jail. The problem is these children do not have anybody to look after them except their mothers. We approached their fathers and other family members but they were not willing to take the children away, especially the girls. We bend the rules, on humanitarian grounds, to give them food, clothes and shelter,? a senior jail official said. 

 ?I don?t know when my mother and I will be released from here. Karididi is lucky,? six-year-old Phool Kumari said. 

 Md Farukh Ali, coordinator of a local voluntary organisation, said: ?There should be a policy to protect the lives of innocent girls who live like prisoners here.?

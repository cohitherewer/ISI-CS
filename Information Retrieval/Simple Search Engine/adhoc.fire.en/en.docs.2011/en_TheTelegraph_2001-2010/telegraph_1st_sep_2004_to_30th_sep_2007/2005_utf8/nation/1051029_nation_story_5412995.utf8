The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No room for second hotel 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 28: Top hotel chains like the Oberoi group, Taj and ITC have stayed out of the Great Eastern Hotel bidding because Calcutta is not that big a market yet where they can justify owning two properties, an industry source said.

 All three already have a property each in the city. Although ITC was among the companies that was expected, along with Park Hotels ? which too already has a presence here ? to submit bids today, both recorded no-show.

 S.S. Mukherjee, the vice-chairman and managing director of the Oberoi group, explained why the top groups might have opted out. He said current business prospects did not justify a second investment in the city. 

 A company will look at the return on investment. There are better opportunities in Bangalore, Delhi or Mumbai, he said.

 Among the three which put in bids today is Unitech, a Delhi-based real estate developer owning two hotel properties, the Delhi and Varanasi Radissons, the brand of the international Carlson Hospitality group.

 The second is Ramuk AB, a Scandinavian company owned by an NRI, Bicky Chakrabarty, with hotels under it carrying the brand Elite. Chakrabarty also owns Bishops Arm pubs and some restaurants in Sweden. 

 He has invested in healthcare in Bengal ? Westbank Hospital in Howrah and two district hospitals ? but does not own any hotels in India.

 The third is the Lalit Suri-owned Bharat Hotels with properties that include the flagship InterContinental The Grand in Delhi and six Grand hotels in Mumbai, Goa, Bangalore, Srinagar, Udaipur and Khajuraho.

 Chains which do not have a presence here may like to buy into Great Eastern since they, as we, believe it has potential. This is why ITC and Hyatt have set up five-star hotels, Mukherjee added.

 The average room rent in five-star properties in Calcutta is hovering between Rs 4,000 and 4,500, not only the lowest among the metros and less than a third of Bangalores, but also below Hyderabads at Rs 7,500. 

 The occupancy rate is also lower (57-60 per cent) than all other metros. 

 Of late, Calcutta has seen an increase in the number of mid-level tourists, but they do not stay in five-star hotels. 

 One has to understand that a hotelier cannot create business in the place he operates. He can only extend his business volume by offering better products and services, Mukherjee said.

 Glam goes out of NRI fest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Green-eyed Aishwarya Rai was the star of the show when it premiered in 2003. This time, the matinee marquee names were supposed to be Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherjee and glam doll Priyanka Chopra. 

 Sadly, none of them will be around. Not even the musical triad Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. 

 Blame it all on the tsunami. Bollywood won?t be represented at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas ? the three-day annual jamboree for non-resident Indians which is organised by the Centre and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 

 They had plans to splash out approximately Rs 6 crore on the annual beanfeast for the Great Indian Diaspora ? a showcase event that was launched by the Vajpayee government in 2003. 

 There were two reasons why this year?s show was significant: first, it would show whether the Congress government could cosy up to the NRIs as the Vajpayee regime had been able to do. Second, it was the first time that the show would leave Delhi and go to the capital of the tinsel world. The expectations of glam and glitz were high; the tsunami has put paid to that.

 It will be a sombre affair with all cultural programmes being axed in keeping with the shroud of gloom that has fallen since the tsunami tragedy.

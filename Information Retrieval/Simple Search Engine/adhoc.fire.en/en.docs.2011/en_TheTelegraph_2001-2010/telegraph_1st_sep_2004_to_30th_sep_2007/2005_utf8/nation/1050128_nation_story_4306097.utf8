 Student protest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 27: Schoolchildren here will take their protest to the governor?s doorsteps tomorrow even as more reports of ?missing? students poured in.

 Anjali Kumari, a Class V student, is missing since Monday, when she left for a coaching class near her home in Hajipur. Her brother, Ashok Kumar, has filed a complaint with the police that she might have been kidnapped.

 But a schoolboy missing since Tuesday has returned. Sumit Kumar, a Class VII student of the capital?s St Paul?s Residential School, came back this afternoon, police said. The son of a newspaper vendor had been reported missing after he did not return home from school on Tuesday. 

 A team under deputy superintendent (town) Rakesh Dubey was formed to look into the case. The family received an anonymous call for ransom last night, raising fears that the boy could have been abducted. But the police said Sumit had gone to New Delhi and came back by train today.

 Deepak Kumar, a Class IX student of Bhagalpur DAV School, has also been missing since Tuesday.

 The current saga began on January 19 when Kislay Kaushal, a student of Delhi Public School here, was kidnapped while he was on his way to school. Then, Ravi Kant, a student of DAV School, Bhagalpur, went missing on January 24.

 Though the police have claimed that they are on the right track, they seem to have made little progress till now. 

 Students observed a low-key Republic Day yesterday and relay fast and prayers continued today.

 Tax glare on Jaya crown

 KAY BENEDICT

 Jayalalithaa 

New Delhi, Jan. 13: The income-tax department is pushing for a physical assessment of offerings made by Jayalalithaa, including a diamond-studded gold crown, to the Guruvayoor Sree Krishna temple in June 2001 in the face of opposition from the temple authorities and the Kerala government. 

 The Tamil Nadu chief minister visited the temple in Kerala, one of the richest shrines in the south, and offered the crown which, her rivals say, is valued at Rs 6.5 crore as ?thanksgiving? for her resounding victory in the Assembly elections. 

 The income-tax authorities have been trying since July 7, 2001, to lay their hands on the offerings and the related documents. Jayalalithaa had told them that whatever she gifted to the temple was given to her by her supporters and devotees of Guruvayoorappan, the presiding deity of the shrine. 

 The case was in a limbo during the Jayalalithaa-friendly NDA regime. Now, the income-tax department is pursuing it with renewed vigour. The Chennai zone income-tax commissioner wrote to the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee last week, seeking a fresh date between January 21 and 24 for the assessment. 

 Tax inspectors were scheduled to visit the temple last Saturday, but dropped the plan after the temple authorities rejected the plea for inspection. 

 Sources said the ADMK suspects the hand of an anti-Jayalalithaa Union minister ? among finance minister P. Chidambaram (Congress), his deputy S. Palanimanickam, IT minister Dayanidhi Maran and surface transport minister T.R. Baalu (all of the DMK) ? behind the income-tax department?s drive.

 On the other hand, the party is thankful to the Congress-led government in Kerala for opposing the entry of income-tax officials into the temple on the ground that it will set a precedent and trample religious sentiments of the people.

 Devaswom minister K.C. Venugopal last week summoned the commissioner of the temple board to Thiruvananthapuram for talks. Later, the minister said the government is opposed to the demand of the income-tax officials. 

 For now, the Devaswom board has declined permission to the taxmen on the ground that the custodian of the temple, who holds one of the keys to the locker, cannot enter the temple till January 15 as there has been a death in his family. 

 In the meantime, it is weighing the legal aspects of such a visit and the impact it would have on the sentiments of devotees. 

 The Kerala government?s stand is that the offerings belong to the temple and tax authorities had no business in a place of worship. The popular belief is that once an offering is made, it becomes the property of Guruvayoorappan. 

 It was also being said that the richest temple in the country, the Tirupati shrine, which gets offerings worth crores every day, also did not allow taxmen on its premises. 

 Sources said the Kerala minister was warned by officials not to get involved in a controversy as he would not only have to contend with Jayalalithaa?s wrath, but also religious sentiments and the Sangh parivar, waiting in the wings to make capital of any issue.

 Mhatre arrest plea

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 30: The grandson of one of the two women mowed down by Ravindra Mhatre?s Ford Ikon has demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh and his re-arrest under non-bailable offences.

 Leela Mashelkar?s grandson Manish, an automobile engineer, made these demands in a written memorandum submitted to the office of chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

 Mhatre, the personal assistant of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, was released on bail within a few hours after his car rammed into four pedestrians on Saturday, killing the two women and injuring two men who were waiting at a bus stop. His blood test report showed an alcohol level higher than the permissible limit. Police yesterday added two more sections to the case against Mhatre for drunk driving, but all are bailable offences.

 ?I have demanded that Mhatre?s bail be cancelled and that he should be arrested under non-bailable offences as required by the law. I have also demanded a Rs 50 lakh compensation,? Mashelkar said.

 He has also demanded legal action against joint commissioner (law and order) Ahmad Javed and deputy commissioner of police Bipin Kumar Singh for suppressing facts.

 ?I have demanded that the phone calls made and received from their mobile numbers be traced which will show if they were behaving under directions from any powerful politicians,? Mashelkar said.

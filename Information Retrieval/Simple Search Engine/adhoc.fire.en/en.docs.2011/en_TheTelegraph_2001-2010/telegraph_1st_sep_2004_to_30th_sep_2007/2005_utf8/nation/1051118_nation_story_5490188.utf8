 HC upholds sanctity of varsity exam rules

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 17: Calcutta High Court today set aside the judgment of its trial bench that asked Calcutta University to change rules so that a students answer scripts could be re-examined.

 The student had failed in the BCom Part-I honours examinations in 2003.

 A division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Mitra also struck down the order of the trial judge, Justice Pratap Roy, allowing the petitioner to sit for the Part-II examinations, which she did this year.

 The bench cancelled the examinees candidature on the ground that she had not attended the required number of classes in the third year. 

 The petitioner had appeared in the Part-II exams on the basis of the trial bench order. But going by the university rules, it is compulsory for a student to attend a stipulated number of classes. But she had not done so. So, her examination stands cancelled, it ruled.

 The judges said Roy had gone beyond his jurisdiction by asking the university authorities to change its existing rules concerning re-examination of answer scripts.

 The petitioner in her appeal had not sought changes in re-examination rules. So the question of asking the authorities to change the re-examination rules does not arise, the judges said.

 When the girl found that she had failed in mathematics and economics in her Part-I examinations, the student applied for post-publication scrutiny of her answer scripts. After the scrutiny, she got pass marks in mathematics but her economics score remained the same.

 She them moved the trial court, asking that her scripts be re-examined by an examiner appointed by the court. 

 The trial court directed CU to produce the students answer scripts. After going through them, the court ruled that her allegation was valid. It ordered the university to get the scripts re-checked by its head examiner and allow the student to appear in the Part-II examinations in 2004. It also directed CU to change its rules concerning re-examination of answer scripts.

 Dipankar Dutta, the lawyer representing the university, challenged the trial courts order before the division bench and the case came up for final hearing today.

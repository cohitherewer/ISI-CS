 Tears flow at airport

 Patna, Jan. 21: The city airport witnessed a poignant drama today.

 A group of Class IX students from Delhi Public School had gathered there to meet railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav. Their mission: request the strongman to help rescue their schoolmate Kislay Kaushal, who was abducted from the city on Wednesday morning.

 But all that they got in return was a wave from the man they had pinned their hopes on. The RJD chief?s helicopter took off, breaking tender hearts at the terminal.

 ?Lalooji had already boarded the chopper when the students arrived there. It was not possible for him to meet them,? an RJD source said. 

 Disappointment soon gave way to anger and frustration. Shouting slogans, the students wiped their tears and headed for the governor?s residence. But Governor Buta Singh was not there to listen to their grievances. The only consolation: his secretary received the students? memorandum and promised all possible help.

 ?I don?t feel like going to school any more. Why should we study if this is our fate? Kislay was one of the brightest students of our class, and very kind-hearted too,? said Nupur, a student of class IX.

 Yesterday, several public school students vowed not to carry food till Kaushal is rescued. The Bihar Public School and Children Welfare Association too stepped in by giving the government a 48-hour ultimatum. The association has appealed to the authorities of all public schools to observe January 24 as a ?black day? and threatened to launch an agitation. 

 At Kaushal?s Patel Nagar residence, it is an unbearable wait for his father Krishnakant Gupta, mother Manju and sister Kriti. ?Give back my child. I don?t want anything else,? Gupta said. The family is worried because the abductors are yet to make a single call. 

 Police have detained about a dozen people for interrogation. ?We have raided several possible hideouts of the abductors in and around Patna. Our team has made some progress and we hope to rescue the boy soon,? senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan said.

 Laloo Prasad is understood to have met the students in the evening and assured the rescue of Kaushal.

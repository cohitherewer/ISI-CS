 Submarine cost

 Cherbourg (France), July 10 (PTI): France today offered to absorb the increase in costs due to inflation in the much-delayed multi-billion deal to make Scorpene submarines in India.

 French defence major Armaris also assured expertise if the Indian Navy wanted to carry out significant changes in the design of the submarine to install an air independent propulsion system, called the Mesma, and to add a new weapons system in the submarine, billed as the worlds most silent killer machine.

 We are offering revisable and adjustable rates to level off cost escalation caused by delay in finalisation of the deal, said Pierre Legros, the chairman of Armaris.

 Legros also indicated that the company was open to making adjustments in the pricing, estimated to run into seven billion euros. He said the inflation level in Europe was down to its lowest level and the price escalation problem could be sorted out amicably.

 Nation at a Glance

 Family comes first for Indians

 London (PTI): An overwhelming 92 

 per cent of the people in India feel family is extremely 

 important and has influenced them most, a new poll indicated 

 today. 

 The BBC World Service-Gallup International poll found that while 18 per cent of Pakistanis said friends have had the most important influence and 12 per cent said religious leaders influenced them most, only 4 per cent of Indian respondents put friends first and less than 1 per cent said the same about religious leaders. 

 People in India are most likely to identify themselves as Indians ? 34 per cent identified this as being the most important to them? rather than their local area, state or city (26 per cent) or religion (19 per cent). 

 In Pakistan, 59 per cent identified themselves by their religion and only 8 per cent did so by nationality. 

 In India, only 9 per cent trust politicians, compared to 13 per cent globally. This is significantly higher in Pakistan with a level of trust in politicians of 31 per cent. 

 Actor amp; model in sex racket

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi police arrested 

 an upcoming actor, a model and two college girls from a 

 hotel in the heart of the city, unearthing one of the most 

 high-profile prostitution rackets of recent times. 

 A pimp, Naveen Jain, was also arrested with them last night, police said. 

 The budding actor and the model were based in Mumbai and frequently visited Delhi to work for the pimp. The actor had recently featured in a hit music video while the model was seen in a TV advertisement for a prominent shoe company. The two college girls were attracted to prostitution for easy money.

 The police said Jain worked for one of the citys biggest pimps, whose network spread to several cities in India and even abroad. 

 Blast deaths

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Five persons were killed 

 in an explosion in a hutment colony near a military base 

 in Bhuj on Sunday morning. 

 The victims ? including three children and two women ? were labourers working at a scrap yard. The exact cause of the explosion is yet to be known, police said. 

 MPs booked

 Sant Kabir Nagar (PTI): A case has been 

 registered against BSP MPs Balchandra Yadav and Lalmani 

 Prasad for obstructing traffic on the Gorakhpur-Faizabad 

 highway and misbehaving with police on Thursday. 

 They had organised a sit-in protest against the misrule 

 of Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh government. 

 Rapist cop

 Jammu (PTI): A police head constable 

 has been charged with raping a minor, who worked at his 

 house here as a domestic help. Abdul Hanief had allegedly 

 raped the girl, who had been working there for the last 

 six months, on Sunday. Hanief is absconding and a hunt has 

 been launched for him, officials said. 

 Computer graduate-turned-hairstylist Nadeem 

 Ahmed of Chandigarh has entered the Limca Book of Records 

 by cutting hair blindfolded, using candle flames, paper 

 cutters and glass for the job.

 Rains upset volcano survey

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 31: An unexpected downpour, the heaviest of the season, kept Barren Island out of bounds for geologists and government officials even as volcanic activity continued unabated on the tiny island in the tsunami-scarred Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.

 It has been raining very heavily, upsetting all our plans. We have decided to make a fresh attempt to reach Barren Island on Thursday, said D.S. Negi, chief secretary of the Island administration.

 A team is expected to fly to the island, 140-km north-east of Port Blair, for a detailed study after Indias lone active volcano erupted after 11 years.

 Reports reaching Port Blair from Coast Guard ships revealed that a pale brownish gas and white smoke were oozing out of the second crater, inactive for centuries, until a few days ago.

 There is no immediate danger to marine life as the lava flow is far away from the coastline, Negi said.

 Officials were hoping the downpour would cool temperatures and stop the flow of molten lava. Instead, the rains have turned out to be the biggest impediment for scientists, who are impatient to find out whether the latest volcanic eruption had anything to do with the tsunami that hit the Andaman coastline on December 26 last year.

 So far, there does not seem to be any indication that the tsunami has anything to do with the lava flow, but the scientists would be able to give a better picture, Negi added.

 Barren Island first breathed fire in 1787. The last was on December 20, 1994.

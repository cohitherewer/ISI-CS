 Chatterjee: Charity at home

 New Delhi, May 12: Charity truly begins at home for Somnath Chatterjee.

 Alarmed by reports of the water crisis plaguing the country, the Lok Sabha Speaker today offered the Parliament premises, his official residence on 20 Akbar Road and his Calcutta home to harvest rainwater, reports our special correspondent.

 A 12-year-old boy was recently crushed to death in a mad scramble for a few litres of water from a tanker in the capital, an incident that mirrored the alarming dip in groundwater level across the country.

 I am going to ask the concerned ministries to take up the project of providing facilities for harvesting rainwater in all the residential and official premises under the Speakers control, Chatterjee said. 

 In the House, the Speaker announced his decision to constitute a parliamentary forum on water and said he would be writing to the urban development ministry to take up such projects in government accommodation. Let us hope the system of rain harvesting will be in place before the onset of monsoon, he said amid thumping of desks by members.

 Chatterjee said he would take up the matter with the government for inclusion of rainwater harvesting systems under the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme.

 The Speaker expressed hope that MPs from all parties would extend active support and carry the message to their constituencies so that the conservation of water does not remain a slogan.

 Fall in the level of groundwater table at an alarming rate is adding to our difficulties, he said.

 Chatterjee is hoping his move will inspire people all over the country to take up similar initiatives.

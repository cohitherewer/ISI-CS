 Rebels loot cash train

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec. 25: Maoist rebels stormed a train carrying salaries of railway employees, killing four policemen and injuring six persons.

 When the Vijayawada-Raigada passenger train pulled into the remote Koneru railway station in Vizianagaram district this afternoon, the gang of 60 barged into its special coach carrying cash boxes containing Rs 50 lakh meant for year-end salaries of railway staff of Raigarh division in Orissa.

 Armed with guns and grenades, the rebels rained bullets on the coach. They decamped with several cash boxes and eight rifles and ammunition, said Vizianagaram police superintendent Bhavana Saxena.

 Three constables of the Railway Protection Force were killed on the spot and an assistant sub-inspector died on the way to hospital. The injured include civilians caught in the crossfire between the police and the Maoists.

 The rebels were returning to their hideout in the forests of Orissa after an abortive attempt to raid Sileru police station in Visakhapatnam. 

 Over 100 Maoists, armed with rocket launchers and AK-47 rifles, had attacked the police station on the Andhra Pradesh-Orissa border late last night. The rebels launched six rockets of which only four exploded, that too off target, V.V. Srinivas Rao, the Visakhapatnam SP, said.

 Before raiding the train, the rebels blew up a guesthouse used by officers of the police station.

 Last night in Andhras Warangal district, Maoists killed a former sarpanch, 50-year-old K. Bhaskar, after branding him a police informer. In the same district, a rebel was killed in an encounter, the police said. 

 Naxalite violence has been on the rise ever since the rebels walked out of peace talks with the Andhra government in January. They have killed nearly 198 persons, including policemen? and 150 Maoists have been killed by policemen during the year, state home minister K. Jana Reddy said.

 In November, the rebels attacked another police station near Hyderabad and took away rifles and ammunition. 

 Last week, they blew up a remote police outpost in Khammam district on the border with Chhattisgarh.

 Cells give iPods a run for survival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In safe hands?

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Mobile phones are giving iPods a run for their money, a survey of 15 countries has revealed.

 About 13 per cent of all cellphone users surveyed said they listen to music on their mobile daily or weekly, the study by TNS, a global provider of market information, found.

 And now the worrying news for iPods: mobile users who are already listening to music on their phones seem to choose it over other options. While about 16 per cent of all music they listen to daily is on their phones, 15 per cent is on a hi-fi or stereo system at home and just 10 per cent on a personal digital music player, such as an iPod.

 The survey, Global Tech Insight 2005, covered 6,800 people aged 16-49 who own a cellphone, PDA or laptop and who access the Net every week. It was conducted between July and August 2005 in 15 countries: Australia, Brazil (Metro), China (Metro), France, Germany, Hong Kong, India (Metro), Japan, Korea, Holland, New Zealand, Russia (Metro), Sweden, the UK and the US.

 Indians beat Americans and everyone else but the Koreans in the mobile music race. About 9 per cent of mobile owners in India listen to music on their phones, which is far behind South Korea at 26 per cent but well ahead of the US at 4 per cent.

 Many tune in at home in addition to when they are on the move. About a quarter ? 23 per cent ? do it in bed, 21 per cent at home at weekends and 16 per cent at home before and after work.

 This is compared to nearly half ? 47 per cent ? on public transport, and 32 per cent while waiting for an appointment or meeting.

 Hanis Harun, regional director for Asia Pacific TNS Technology, said: The TNS study confirms a significant interest in listening to music using mobile phones, with considerable potential for mobiles to take a greater share of the market in the future.

 About 4 in 10 mobile users chose music as the application they would like to start using or use more of. Again, Indians (26 per cent) were second only to Koreans (60 per cent).

 The pricing of downloads is still probably the greatest single barrier?. However, all the evidence points towards mobile music becoming increasingly competitive with personal digital music players such as iPods, the survey, which did not go into the question of quality, concludes.

 Shuffle date at hand

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: A shuffle of the Union cabinet, which has been hanging in the balance for the past five months, could finally take place next week, said highly-placed official sources. 

 The dates being considered are between September 29, when the inauspicious period of pitrapaksha ends, and October 7, when the Congress chief ministers will hold a conclave in Chandigarh. Sources indicated Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may settle for a fill-in-the-blanks approach rather than a major overhaul, which he was initially keen on.

 The blanks which require to be filled are in the ministries of sports and youth affairs, caused by Sunil Dutts death, coal and NRI affairs, caused by the resignations of Shibu Soren and Jagdish Tytler. 

 Sources said while Sorens comeback was almost certain, the nominees for the other two berths, which fall in the Congresss quota, are still under consideration.

 Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi are likely to meet on Friday to give the finishing touches to the much-awaited shuffle. 

 Asked what the criteria would be, sources said caste and regional considerations would be the main ones. For instance, Dutt was from Maharashtra and so his post could go to somebody from that state, preferably Mumbai. But since there is no immediate election to be fought in Maharashtra, political logic dictated the post could be claimed by one of the election-bound states, that is, Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Assam and Kerala. 

 There was a feeling that in the case of Andhra Pradesh, the upper castes (the Reddys and Kammas) were represented but there was no member from the backward castes who traditionally formed the Congresss backbone in the state. But sources said the question was since Andhra had its share, would it be proper to add one more minister or should an upper-caste minister be dropped to make way from one from the backward castes?

 Murder stench in car arson

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Powalipathar (Dibrugarh), May 8: A 43 -year-old-man and his four-year-old son were charred to death inside a Tata Indigo vehicle last night under mysterious circumstances. The duo was returning to Dibrugarh from Duliajan.

 Police did not rule out murder, pointing out that ?the positions in which their bodies were found look suspicious. They could have been first killed and then set ablaze to make it look as if the vehicle caught fire?.

 The police also found a container, which might have been used to bring some inflammable liquid to the spot.

 Dibrugarh superintendent of police Pradip Chandra Saloi said 43-year-old Dipak Tamuli and his son Sushant left Duliajan at around 7.30 pm yesterday. 

 Both of them were found dead in their black Tata Indigo car (AS 06 D 9090) around 8 pm in the Powalipather area, some 4 km from Duliajan police station.

 ?He had left Duliajan after making some payments at his office at around 7.30 pm. At that time, he was driving the car and his son was asleep in the front seat,? a source close to Tamuli said.

 Tamuli was a first class contractor with Oil India Ltd and Indian Railways.

 Pranab kayoes Left defence funds cut plea

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: The government has shot down a plea by the Left to cut allocations on defence expenditure.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee put his foot down during a discussion on budget proposals yesterday and made it clear that he was not willing to debate the subject of allocations for the armed forces and security establishments.

 The only compromise the United Progressive Alliance government was willing to make, Mukherjee told the Left leaders, was to ensure that defence allocations as a proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP) did not go up.

 Defence allocations in the last budget accounted for about 2.5 per cent of the GDP.

 The breakfast meeting at 7 Race Course Road was attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, P. Chidambaram and Mukherjee for the government as well as H.S. Surjeet and Sitaram Yechury of the CPM, A.B. Bardhan and D. Raja of the CPI, Debabrata Biswas of the Forward Bloc and the RSP?s Abani Roy.

 The Left was understood to have given up the expectation that its demand to divert funds from defence expenditure to the social sector will be met. After Mukherjee made the government?s standpoint clear, there was no questioning from the Left leaders.

 With the defence minister making it clear that the UPA government was in effect taking the same course as its predecessor ? of not compromising on security compulsions ? a hike of about Rs 6,000 crore in the allocations for 2004-05 seems likely.

 In a note to the government, the Left had pointed out that defence allocations had increased by almost Rs 12,000 crore in the last budget and this had to be pared down. Finance minister Chidambaram had allocated about Rs 77,000 crore for defence in 2004-05 ? up from Rs 65,300 crore in the previous year.

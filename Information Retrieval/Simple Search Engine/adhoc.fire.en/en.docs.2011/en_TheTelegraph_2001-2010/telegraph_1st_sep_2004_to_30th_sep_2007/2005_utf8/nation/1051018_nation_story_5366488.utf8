 US nuke envoy on clear-air mission

 PRANAY SHARMA

 Burns: Twin missions

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: Washington 

 is sending over its lead negotiator of the Indo-US nuclear 

 deal, Nicholas Burns, to assure Delhi that the agreement 

 to transfer dual-use and sophisticated nuclear technologies 

 to India is on track. The pact had been reached between 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President George Bush 

 in Washington in July.

 The US under-secretary is also likely to try and ascertain Indias stand on next months meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors, which will decide whether to refer Iran to the UN Security Council for its alleged nuclear weapons programme.

 Burns might try to get a commitment that if Iran refuses to stop its nuclear programme, Delhi will vote to bring the matter before the Security Council.

 Burnss October 21-22 visit to Delhi will follow the October 19-20 meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in Vienna. During that meeting, Washington is likely to make its first serious efforts to change American and international laws to allow India to acquire restricted nuclear materials.

 India is neither a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) nor a member of the NSG and, therefore, is not entitled to any of the sophisticated nuclear technologies it has been seeking for many years.

 Burns will be able to inform the Indians about the exact steps the Americans have taken at the domestic level and at the NSG to ensure the deal stays on track.

 Burnss most important meeting will be with foreign secretary Shyam Saran, but he is also likely to hold talks with foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and other senior officials.

 The US officials visit comes barely a week after a meeting between Natwar Singh and Iranian ambassador S.Z. Yaghoubi in Delhi. The two sides had then discussed Irans nuclear programme as well as the steps Tehran could take to avoid a confrontation with the US-led western bloc.

 Delhis vote on the IAEAs September 23 resolution against Iran has been widely seen in India as an attempt to please Washington and ensure that the US Congress passes the civilian nuclear deal with India.

 But before India can be given the restricted technologies, the Bush administration and its European allies will have to cross a crucial hurdle at the NSG meeting later this week.

 Agency reports from Washington said many have raised questions about the Indo-US deal and expressed fears that it would undermine non-proliferation standards.

 US Congressmen have been concerned about the growing strategic partnership between India and Iran. They have also wondered whether Delhi will ultimately vote on a resolution that takes the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council.

 The agency reports suggested the Bush administration is expected this week to begin laying out in more detail its plans to change US and international rules so that India can acquire restricted nuclear materials.

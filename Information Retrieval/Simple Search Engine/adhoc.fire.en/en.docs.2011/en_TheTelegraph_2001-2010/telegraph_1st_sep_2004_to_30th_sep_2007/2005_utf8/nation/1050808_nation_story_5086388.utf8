 Buddha doubts on FDI in retail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Buddhadeb: Unsure

Chennai, Aug. 7: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted there are pressures to allow global retail chains like Wal-Mart and Metro to set up shop in the state but said his government is not convinced about allowing foreign direct investment in retail marketing.

 Sending roses from Calcutta to the Netherlands is a matter of pride for Bengal, but about exporting fruits and vegetables, I have some serious doubts, Bhattacharjee said at the 15th foundation day celebrations of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation here.

 The chief minister sought agriculture scientist Swaminathans advice on the export of fruits and vegetables so that they do not go waste in orchards and fields, especially as the state lacks post-harvest technologies such as a cold storage chain and a marketing mechanism.

 Bhattacharjee also sought Swaminathans opinion on allowing FDI participation in the retail market of our agricultural products.

 Another priority area, he said, is the development of the Sunderbans ? famous for its mangrove forests ? and developing eco-tourism even while protecting the delta.

 The chief minister emphasised that with Unesco having recognised the Sunderbans as a heritage site, the conservation of its biodiversity and natural heritage now poses a bigger challenge. I cannot prevent foreigners from visiting the Sunderbans to see the Royal Bengal tigers, he quipped, drawing laughter from the audience.

 Bhattacharjee appreciated the Rs 100 crore earmarked by the 12th finance commission for the development of the Sunderbans.

 The chief minister said his government always gets cooperation and guidance from Swaminathan, who has played a key role in advancing the cause of sustainable development. He urged the agriculture scientist, who also heads the National Commission on Farmers, to set up a branch of his foundation in Calcutta.

 Bhattacharjee asserted that the rice production in Bengal is the highest in the country and said his government has identified a place for setting up the proposed rice park for research and work on value addition from the crops byproducts, like the husk.

 However, the state is deficient in edible oils and we are not being complacent about our performance, he said. We have identified a farm house for him (Swaminathan), not to stay but for doing research work, he said.

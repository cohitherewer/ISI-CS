 Foreigner death in farmhouse

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: A 21-year-old Israeli woman was found dead today at a well-known Delhi builders farmhouse with injury marks on her head and forehead.

 Police are not ruling out foul play in the death of Adichakad, who had been staying as a guest for the past eight days at Sudarshan Kohlis sprawling mansion near Vasant Kunj.

 Kohlis son Ankush, also in his early twenties, had befriended the woman during a recent trip to Almora barely 10 days ago. He is being questioned by police.

 The body was found around 3 pm on the stairs leading to the house and facing the main gate. She was wearing cotton trousers and a top.

 The Israeli embassy has been informed and the body taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The post-mortem will be done tomorrow.

 It could be suicide, accident or murder. We are not ruling out anything, said deputy commissioner of police Dipender Pathak.

 Built like a fort, the Kohli farmhouse at 4 Shivaji Marg is located close to Radisson Hotel, the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the posh suburb of Vasant Kunj.

 Kohli is credited with having developed the farmhouse area of Vasant Kunj.

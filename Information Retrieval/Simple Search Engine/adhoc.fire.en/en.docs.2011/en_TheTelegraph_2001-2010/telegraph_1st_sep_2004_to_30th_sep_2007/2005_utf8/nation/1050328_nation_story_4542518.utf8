 Kids carry tsunami load

 Velankanni, March 27 (Reuters): Bhagyaraj has stopped waiting for authorities to help rebuild his utensil kiosk that was washed away by the tsunami three months ago.

 Instead, the hawker in Tamil Nadu now waits for a middleman who has promised to get his 14-year-old daughter a job as a maid in a house in the big city after another daughter, 16, was taken away similarly this month.

 ?I can?t feed them here. The relief is irregular and there is no sign of any help to rebuild my shop,? said the 46-year-old father, who lost two other daughters to the giant waves. ?At least, they will be fed regularly in the city.?

 Bhagyaraj is not the only tsunami survivor in the area sending away his children to ease his burden.

 Arul Mani, a community activist, reels out instances of many more children who have been sent away from Bhagyaraj?s relief camp in the town of Velankanni. ?Two other girls, 13 and 14, have gone to work as maids, one 14-year-old boy has gone to a stone quarry, three boys were taken to work in Bangalore, two went to aluminium factories,? he said.

 Relief volunteers say a few dozen children from villages in Nagapattinam, the country?s worst tsunami-hit district, have been lured by labour contractors to work not just as domestic help but also at garment factories, stone quarries and utensil manufacturers.

 Although trafficking in children and the use of child labour are known to be widely prevalent in Tamil Nadu, the district had been largely immune to the problem.

 The district?s lucrative fishing industry gave financial comfort to rural communities to educate their children and not send them away to work, the volunteers say.

 But the tsunami has changed that. ?I am afraid we are on the verge of an explosion in child trafficking and child labour in Nagapattinam,? said R. Somasundaram, chairman of the Avvai Village Welfare Society, a local voluntary group coordinating relief and rehabilitation for over a dozen global agencies.

 With authorities busy providing relief, labour contractors descended even on relief camps and lured children away. ?Lots of people came looking to employ us. I went to work in a garment factory with six others where we dyed clothes,? said Gunashekar, 15, who lives in a camp in Nagapattinam.?We missed our families and came back after 10 days.?

 Trafficking in children and child labour are illegal in the country. But these have flourished nevertheless.

 The alarm in Nagapattinam comes as the US warned India this month that it could face economic sanctions for not doing enough to stop trafficking of women and children, newspaper reports said last week. 

 Washington is expected to decide in June if it should impose sanctions and vote against loans to India from global financial institutions under the US Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, the reports said.
